His absence is being <a href="kayfabe" title="wikilink">portrayed on television</a> as the result of a serious <a href="concussion" class="uri" title="wikilink">concussion</a> inflicted by <a href="Randy_Orton" title="wikilink">Randy Orton</a>.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>As of 2007, Hickenbottom is one of the longest-tenured performers in WWE, having joined in 1987. He is one of only two wrestlers to have appeared on the very first episode of RAW is WAR who are still with the company today. The other is <a href="The_Undertaker" title="wikilink">The Undertaker</a>. However, he was inactive in the company from 1998-2002 due to a severe back injury.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>Before coming to World Wrestling Entertainment, Hickenbottom began his career in Mid-South Wrestling in 1984. He then went on to Texas All-Star Wrestling. He made his national debut with the <a href="American_Wrestling_Association" title="wikilink">American Wrestling Association</a> in 1986.

<h2 id="career">Career</h2>
<h3 id="early-career">Early career</h3>
<p>Michaels was born on <a href="July_22" title="wikilink">July 22</a> <a href="1965" class="uri" title="wikilink">1965</a> in <a href="Chandler,_Arizona" title="wikilink">Chandler, Arizona</a>. The last of four children - Randy, Scott and Shari. He was raised in a military family, he spent a brief part of his early years in <a href="Reading,_Berkshire" title="wikilink">Reading, Berkshire</a>, <a href="England" class="uri" title="wikilink">England</a>, but mainly grew up in <a href="San_Antonio,_Texas" title="wikilink">San Antonio, Texas</a>. He knew he wanted to become a professional wrestler at the age of 12. He was already an athlete; his career began at the age of 6 when he started playing <a href="American_football" title="wikilink">Football</a>, becoming a stand-out <a href="Linebacker" class="uri" title="wikilink">Linebacker</a>; he attended <a href="Randolph_High_School_(Texas)" title="wikilink">Randolph High School</a><a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> and eventually becoming Captain of the football team. After graduating he attended <a href="Southwest_Texas_State_University" title="wikilink">Southwest Texas State University</a> in <a href="San_Marcos,_Texas" title="wikilink">San Marcos, Texas</a>. But soon he realized that the college life was not for him. Then he began pursuing the career of a professional wrestler.</p>
<p>He was then trained by <a href="Mexico" title="wikilink">Mexican</a> professional wrestler <a href="Jose_Lothario" title="wikilink">Jose Lothario</a>, Michaels debuted in <a href="1984" class="uri" title="wikilink">1984</a>, working with Mid-South Wrestling and later Texas All-Star Wrestling <a href="professional_wrestling_promotion" title="wikilink">promotion</a>, where he and <a href="Paul_Diamond" title="wikilink">Paul Diamond</a> were awarded the TAW Tag Team Championship by <a href="Chavo_Guerrero" title="wikilink">Chavo Guerrero, Sr.</a><a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p>Michaels also wrestled for <a href="Heart_of_America_Sports_Attractions" title="wikilink">Central States Championship Wrestling</a>. There, he and tag team partner <a href="Marty_Jannetty" title="wikilink">Marty Jannetty</a> defeated <a href="The_Batten_Twins" title="wikilink">The Batten Twins</a> for the Central States Tag Team Championship,<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> later losing it back to the Battens. Michaels also made several appearances in the <a href="Dallas,_Texas" title="wikilink">Dallas, Texas</a>-based <a href="World_Class_Championship_Wrestling" title="wikilink">World Class Championship Wrestling</a> throughout 1985.</p>
<h3 id="american-wrestling-association-1986-1988">American Wrestling Association (1986-1988)</h3>
<p>Michaels made his national-level debut in 1986 in the <a href="American_Wrestling_Association" title="wikilink">American Wrestling Association</a> (AWA), once again teaming with Jannetty. The pair were billed as &quot;<a href="The_Rockers" title="wikilink">The Midnight Rockers</a>&quot; and won the <a href="AWA_World_Tag_Team_Championship" title="wikilink">AWA World Tag Team Championship</a> twice.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> They also appeared in the Mid-South on loan at this point. In a raid of AWA talent in 1987, The Rockers were signed by a competing promotion: the <a href="World_Wrestling_Entertainment" title="wikilink">World Wrestling Federation</a>. However, they were fired two weeks later for &quot;partying too hard&quot; (a misunderstanding, according to Michaels' autobiography). They returned to the AWA, but were re-signed by the WWF a year later.</p>

<h4 id="section">1988-1991</h4>

<p>They redebuted at a <a href="house_show" title="wikilink">house show</a> on <a href="July_7" title="wikilink">July 7</a> <a href="1988" class="uri" title="wikilink">1988</a>.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> Because of WWF chairman <a href="Vince_McMahon" title="wikilink">Vince McMahon</a>'s desire to have his performers carry WWF-exclusive monikers, they were repackaged as just &quot;<a href="The_Rockers" title="wikilink">The Rockers</a>&quot;.</p>
<p>The team proved popular with both children and women, as well as 'smart' fans who appreciated technical wrestling. The team were mid-card stalwarts of TV and pay-per-view shows for the next two years, but never seemed to get a fair chance at the WWF's Tag Team Championships.</p>
<p>Their chance belatedly came in October 1990: The Rockers were scheduled to win the <a href="World_Tag_Team_Championship_(WWE)" title="wikilink">WWF Tag Team Championship</a> from <a href="The_Hart_Foundation" title="wikilink">The Hart Foundation</a>. Jim Neidhart, half of the championship team, was in the process of negotiating his release from the company. The match was taped with The Rockers fairly winning the belts, but soon after, Neidhart came to a stopgap agreement with management and was rehired. The belts were returned to the Harts, while the change was never broadcast or even acknowledged on TV. When news spread, WWF explained that the original result was void due to a collapsed turnbuckle in the ring during the bout. A buckle had indeed broken, but not to a noticeable or dangerous extent during the match. The duo plodded along, eventually splitting on <a href="December_2" title="wikilink">December 2</a> <a href="1991" class="uri" title="wikilink">1991</a> during an incident on <a href="Edward_Leslie" title="wikilink">Brutus &quot;The Barber&quot; Beefcake's</a> televised &quot;Barber Shop&quot; talk show segment. Michaels superkicked Jannetty and <a href="Defenestration" title="wikilink">threw him</a> through a <a href="Sugar_glass" title="wikilink">glass</a> window on the &quot;shop&quot; set. Jannetty vanished from the WWF and Michaels turned heel as &quot;The Boy Toy&quot;.</p>
<h4 id="section-1">1992-1993</h4>
<p>His nickname was later changed to &quot;The Heartbreak Kid&quot;, at <a href="Curt_Hennig" title="wikilink">Curt Hennig</a>'s suggestion.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<p>In his new <a href="List_of_professional_wrestling_slang#G" title="wikilink">gimmick</a> as a vain, cocky heel named <strong>The Heartbreak Kid</strong>, he was put together with mirror-carrying <a href="manager_(professional_wrestling)" title="wikilink">manager</a> <a href="Sherri_Martel" title="wikilink">&quot;Sensational&quot; Sherri</a>, who, according to the storyline, had become infatuated with him. Sherri even sang the first version of his new <a href="theme_music" title="wikilink">theme music</a> &quot;Sexy Boy.&quot; During that period, Michaels normally wrestled during the first half of house shows, and had his departure announced with the words &quot;Shawn Michaels has left the building&quot; (alluding to the phrase &quot;<a href="Elvis_Presley" title="wikilink">Elvis</a> has left the building&quot;).</p>
<p>Michaels failed to win the <a href="WWE_Intercontinental_Championship" title="wikilink">WWF Intercontinental Championship</a> from <a href="Bret_Hart" title="wikilink">Bret Hart</a> in July 1992, even losing the WWF's first ever <a href="Ladder_match" title="wikilink">Ladder match</a> against him at a <a href="House_show" title="wikilink">House show</a>. Still, Michaels was beginning to get over as a heel. He won the <a href="WWE_Intercontinental_Championship" title="wikilink">WWF Intercontinental Championship</a> from <a href="Davey_Boy_Smith" title="wikilink">&quot;The British Bulldog&quot;</a> during <em><a href="WWE_Saturday_Night&#39;s_Main_Event" title="wikilink">Saturday Night's Main Event</a></em> on <a href="October_27" title="wikilink">October 27</a> <a href="1992" class="uri" title="wikilink">1992</a>. Shortly thereafter, he was in a PPV main event for the first time, facing &lt;U+2014&gt; and losing to &lt;U+2014&gt; future nemesis Bret Hart, for the <a href="WWE_Championship" title="wikilink">WWF Championship</a> at the <em><a href="Survivor_Series_(1992)" title="wikilink">1992 Survivor Series</a></em>.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> They were moved to the main event after <a href="Warrior_(wrestler)" title="wikilink">The Ultimate Warrior</a> left WWF suddenly, leaving his tag-team match with <a href="Randy_Savage" title="wikilink">Randy Savage</a> against <a href="Ric_Flair" title="wikilink">Ric Flair</a> and <a href="Scott_Hall" title="wikilink">Razor Ramon</a> hanging. The &quot;Champion vs. Champion&quot; match stole the show.</p>
<p>Michaels and Sherri split at this point, and Jannetty quickly reappeared, leading to several memorable matches. After sneaking past <a href="Chris_Chavis" title="wikilink">Tatanka</a> in early 1993, Michaels lost his Intercontinental Championship to Jannetty on <em><a href="WWE_Raw" title="wikilink">Monday Night RAW</a></em> on <a href="May_17" title="wikilink">May 17</a> <a href="1993" class="uri" title="wikilink">1993</a>.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> He then regained it on <a href="June_6" title="wikilink">June 6</a> <a href="1993" class="uri" title="wikilink">1993</a> with the help of his debuting &quot;<a href="bodyguard" class="uri" title="wikilink">bodyguard</a>&quot; (and off-air friend) <a href="Kevin_Nash" title="wikilink">Diesel</a>.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<p>After a much-hyped but ultimately disappointing feud with <a href="Curt_Hennig" title="wikilink">Mr. Perfect</a>, Michaels quit the WWF in September <a href="1993" class="uri" title="wikilink">1993</a>. It was announced that Michaels had failed to defend his belt enough times during a set period; in reality, he had been suspended for testing positive for <a href="steroid" title="wikilink">steroids</a> &lt;U+2014&gt; a charge that Michaels denies to this day. After turning down <a href="World_Championship_Wrestling" title="wikilink">WCW's</a> advances, Michaels returned to the <a href="World_Wrestling_Entertainment" title="wikilink">WWF</a> and made several appearances in the <a href="United_States_Wrestling_Association" title="wikilink">United States Wrestling Association</a> during a WWF/USWA cross-promotion. He returned to WWF television for November's <em><a href="Survivor_Series_(1993)" title="wikilink">Survivor Series</a></em>, substituting for the arrested <a href="Jerry_Lawler" title="wikilink">Jerry Lawler</a> in a match pitting himself and three of Lawler's &quot;Knights&quot; against Bret, <a href="Bruce_Hart_(wrestler)" title="wikilink">Bruce</a>, <a href="Keith_Hart_(wrestler)" title="wikilink">Keith</a>, and <a href="Owen_Hart" title="wikilink">Owen Hart</a>.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<h4 id="section-2">1994-1995</h4>
<p>He soon entered a feud with <a href="Scott_Hall" title="wikilink">Razor Ramon</a>, who had won the vacated Intercontinental Title during Michaels' absence. Since Michaels had never been defeated in the ring for the title, he claimed to be the rightful champion and even carried around his old title belt. This feud culminated in a <a href="ladder_match" title="wikilink">ladder match</a> between the two at <em><a href="WrestleMania_X" title="wikilink">WrestleMania X</a></em>. Michaels lost the match, which featured both his and Ramon's belts suspended above a ladder in the ring.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> This match won &quot;Match of the Year&quot; awards from <em>Pro Wrestling Illustrated</em><a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> and the <em><a href="Dave_Meltzer#Wrestling_Observer_Newsletter" title="wikilink">Wrestling Observer Newsletter</a></em>. It also earned Michaels a reputation of being the &quot;Innovator of the Ladder Match&quot; when, in reality, it was Bret Hart who brought in the idea two years previously from his experience in <a href="Stampede_Wrestling" title="wikilink">Stampede Wrestling</a> where the Ladder Match had been used since the 1970s.</p>
<p>Michaels battled various injuries over the next few months and soon launched the &quot;Heartbreak Hotel&quot; TV talk show segment, mainly shown on <em><a href="WWF_Superstars_of_Wrestling" title="wikilink">WWF Superstars</a></em>.</p>
<p>On <a href="August_28" title="wikilink">August 28</a> <a href="1994" class="uri" title="wikilink">1994</a>, Michaels and his ever more popular sidekick, Diesel, captured the WWF World Tag Team Championship from <a href="The_Headshrinkers" title="wikilink">The Headshrinkers</a>. During their brief time as a tag team, they used a variation of the Headshrinkers' finishing move, where Michaels finished off their opponent by climbing on Diesel's shoulders and <a href="professional_wrestling_aerial_techniques#splash" title="wikilink">splashing</a> on their opponents. The next day, at <em><a href="SummerSlam_(1994)" title="wikilink">SummerSlam</a></em>, Diesel lost the Intercontinental Title to Ramon when Michaels accidentally <a href="Superkick" title="wikilink">Superkicked</a> his bodyguard.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> This triggered a Michaels-Diesel split, drawn out until the <em><a href="Survivor_Series_(1994)" title="wikilink">Survivor Series</a></em> that November due to Michaels' hand injury at the time.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> Michaels went on to win the <em><a href="Royal_Rumble_(1995)" title="wikilink">1995 Royal Rumble</a></em>, where he was the first <a href="Royal_Rumble" title="wikilink">Royal Rumble</a> participant to win the match from the No.1 spot.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> This set up a championship/grudge match at <em><a href="WrestleMania_XI" title="wikilink">WrestleMania XI</a></em> against Diesel. Michaels recruited <a href="Sid_Eudy" title="wikilink">Sid</a> as his bodyguard for the build-up, lost the match,<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> and was attacked by Sid the following night. Michaels took time off.</p>
<p>He returned to the ring as a 'babyface' in June <a href="1995" class="uri" title="wikilink">1995</a> and defeated <a href="Jeff_Jarrett" title="wikilink">Jeff Jarrett</a> in July for his third Intercontinental Title. This led to a title defense against Razor Ramon at <em><a href="SummerSlam_(1995)" title="wikilink">SummerSlam</a></em>, in a Ladder Match, which Michaels won.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> Around this time, Michaels became the alleged leader of a backstage group known as <a href="Clique_(professional_wrestling)" title="wikilink">The Clique/Kliq</a>, which others perceived had sufficient clout with WWF owner <a href="Vince_McMahon" title="wikilink">Vince McMahon</a>, to become the dominant wrestling figures in the promotion for several years in the mid-1990s. Michaels disputes the perception, saying that McMahon pushed only deserving wrestlers. Michaels fan base was later nicknamed &quot;The Kliq&quot; as an inside reference to the real &quot;Clique.&quot;</p>
<p>In October 1995, he was <a href="Legit_(professional_wrestling)" title="wikilink">legitimately</a> attacked by several men outside a bar in <a href="Syracuse,_New_York" title="wikilink">Syracuse, New York</a>. Shortly afterwards, at the <em><a href="In_Your_House#In_Your_House_4:_Great_White_North" title="wikilink">In Your House: Great White North</a></em> PPV, Michaels forfeited the Intercontinental Title to rival <a href="Shane_Douglas" title="wikilink">Dean Douglas</a> because he was, according to the WWF, unable to compete. However, Douglas lost the title immediately to Clique member Razor Ramon.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> Douglas maintained that Michaels could have wrestled that night and simply did not want to put him <a href="List_of_professional_wrestling_slang#O" title="wikilink">over</a>.</p>
<p>The next month, during a match with Owen Hart on <em>Monday Night RAW</em>, Owen nailed Michaels with an <a href="Professional_wrestling_attacks#Enzuigiri" title="wikilink">Enzuigiri</a> kick to the back of Michaels' head. They continued to wrestle, but Michaels collapsed in the ring, supposedly because he had suffered a concussion in the Syracuse incident.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> The concussion was a <a href="Work_(professional_wrestling)" title="wikilink">work</a>, skillfully kept from most fans at the time.</p>
<h4 id="section-3">1996-1997</h4>
<p>After teasing a retirement, Michaels announced that he would be returning to the WWF at the <em><a href="Royal_Rumble_(1996)" title="wikilink">1996 Royal Rumble</a></em> match, which he won for the second year in a row.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> Around this time, <a href="Jose_Lothario" title="wikilink">Jose Lothario</a>, Michaels' original trainer, became his on-screen manager.</p>
<p>Michaels won his first WWF Championship at <em><a href="WrestleMania_XII" title="wikilink">WrestleMania XII</a></em> in March 1996, pinning Bret Hart in the 'sudden death' overtime of their a sixty minute <a href="Iron_Man_match" title="wikilink">Iron Man match</a>, which had ended in a 0-0 tie.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> As WCW gained momentum due to the signings of Michaels' friends <a href="Scott_Hall" title="wikilink">Scott Hall</a> and <a href="Kevin_Nash" title="wikilink">Kevin Nash</a>, Michaels soldiered on as champion for most of the year, notably overcoming <a href="Mick_Foley" title="wikilink">Mankind</a>,<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> <a href="Leon_White" title="wikilink">Vader</a>,<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> and <a href="Davey_Boy_Smith" title="wikilink">The British Bulldog</a><a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> in pay-per-view battles.</p>
<p>Michaels' title reign ended at the <em><a href="Survivor_Series_(1996)" title="wikilink">1996 Survivor Series</a></em> in November, where he lost to <a href="Sid_Eudy" title="wikilink">Sycho Sid</a>, his former bodyguard, at <a href="Madison_Square_Garden" title="wikilink">Madison Square Garden</a> in a face vs. face match. This match was notable for the <a href="New_York_City" title="wikilink">New York</a> fans cheering for Sid when he hit both Michaels and Jose Lothario with a television camera and cheering again when he won the match and championship.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> A flu-ridden Michaels recaptured the belt from Sid in January at the <em><a href="Royal_Rumble_(1997)" title="wikilink">1997 Royal Rumble</a></em> in front of his hometown fans in San Antonio.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a></p>
<p>On a special episode of <em>RAW</em> dubbed <em>Thursday RAW Thursday</em>,<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> Michaels vacated the WWF title;<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> he explained to the fans that he was informed by doctors that a knee injury was bad enough that he had to retire. His speech was regarded as controversial, as Michaels was allegedly unwilling to lose to Bret Hart at WrestleMania 13 (since it was noted that he was going to have a rematch with Hart at WrestleMania). Michaels contemplated thoughts of retirement and stated that he &quot;had to find his smile again&quot;, which he had &quot;lost&quot; somewhere down the line.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a></p>
<p>After knee surgery by Dr. <a href="James_Andrews_(physician)" title="wikilink">James Andrews</a>, he returned a few months later, briefly teaming with <a href="Stone_Cold_Steve_Austin" title="wikilink">Steve Austin</a> to win the WWF Tag Team Titles.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> However, after a real life backstage fight with Bret Hart, Michaels quit the WWF, until Vince McMahon convinced Michaels otherwise, and gave him the role of a heel.</p>
<p>At <em><a href="SummerSlam_(1997)" title="wikilink">SummerSlam 1997</a></em>, Michaels officiated the WWF title match between WWF Champion <a href="The_Undertaker" title="wikilink">The Undertaker</a> and Bret Hart. The match ended in controversial fashion, with Michaels nailing Undertaker with a chair (unintentionally, as he was aiming for Hart after he spat in his face). Michaels was then forced to award the title to his nemesis, Bret Hart. At <a href="WWF_One_Night_Only" title="wikilink">WWF One Night Only</a>, held in <a href="Birmingham,_England" title="wikilink">Birmingham, England</a> in September, Michaels defeated <a href="Davey_Boy_Smith" title="wikilink">The British Bulldog</a> to capture the <a href="WWF_European_Championship" title="wikilink">WWF European Championship</a> when he passed out in the Figure Four Leg Lock.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> The fans at the event were so appalled at the result of the match they almost rioted and booed Michaels out of the building to the extent that they littered the ring with rubbish.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> Michaels' striking of the Undertaker with a chair began a feud between the two men. In October, at <em><a href="WWE_Bad_Blood#1997" title="wikilink">In Your House: Badd Blood</a></em>, Michaels and Undertaker participated in the very first <a href="Hell_in_a_Cell" title="wikilink">Hell in a Cell</a> match, which saw Michaels falling off the side of the 15-foot high structure through a table. Michaels won the match with the help of the Undertaker's brother <a href="Glen_Jacobs" title="wikilink">Kane</a>, who made his debut.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a></p>
<p>In the summer, Michaels joined forces with real-life friend, <a href="Triple_H" title="wikilink">Hunter Hearst Helmsley</a> and Hunter's then-girlfriend, <a href="Joanie_Laurer" title="wikilink">Chyna</a> to form <strong><a href="D-Generation_X" title="wikilink">D-Generation X</a></strong>. The group engaged in rebellious behavior, such as using the DX slogan &quot;Suck it!&quot;, in addition to the <a href="D-Generation_X#Crotch_chop" title="wikilink">crotch chop</a> towards other wrestlers, and sometimes fans. Moving away from the family-oriented product, this marked the beginning of the WWF Attitude Era. Michaels also began re-feuding with <a href="Bret_Hart" title="wikilink">Bret Hart</a>'s reformed <a href="The_Hart_Foundation#The_(New)_Hart_Foundation" title="wikilink">Hart Foundation</a>, which was now a pro-<a href="Canada" class="uri" title="wikilink">Canada</a> <a href="Stable_(professional_wrestling)" title="wikilink">stable</a>. Michaels taunted The Hart Foundation and Canada by engaging in acts, such as blowing his nose with and humping the <a href="Flag_of_Canada" title="wikilink">Canadian Flag</a>. In his book, <em><a href="Heartbreak_and_Triumph" title="wikilink">Heartbreak &amp; Triumph</a></em>, Michaels claims the flag desecration was Bret Hart's idea.</p>
<p>Michaels' feud with the Hart Foundation culminated in a title shot at the <em><a href="Survivor_Series_(1997)" title="wikilink">1997 Survivor Series</a></em> against Bret Hart in what is thought to be the most controversial match in wrestling history. Michaels came out of this match, dubbed by fans the &quot;<a href="Montreal_Screwjob" title="wikilink">Montreal Screwjob</a>&quot;, as the WWF World Champion.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> Michaels thus became the only wrestler to hold both the World Championship and the European Championship at the same time. However, he had Triple H pin him in December in a <a href="farce" title="wikilink">farcical</a> match, making Hunter the European Champion.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a></p>
<h4 id="injury">1998-Injury</h4>
<p>In 1998, Michaels received a back injury in the <a href="List_of_professional_wrestling_match_types#Container-based_variations" title="wikilink">Casket match</a> against the Undertaker at the <em><a href="Royal_Rumble_(1998)" title="wikilink">Royal Rumble</a></em><a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a>; Michaels took a back body drop to the outside and smashed his lower back on the casket, causing him to herniate two discs and crush one completely. This forced Michaels into retirement after losing the WWF Championship to <a href="Stone_Cold_Steve_Austin" title="wikilink">Steve Austin</a> at <em><a href="WrestleMania_XIV" title="wikilink">WrestleMania XIV</a></em>.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> Prior to losing the belt, Michaels, along with DX allies, made regular appearances much like Steve Austin did the previous year after injuring his neck at SummerSlam. Wrestlers such as <a href="Bret_Hart" title="wikilink">Bret Hart</a>, as Michaels reveals in his autobiography, did interviews on live television claiming that Michaels was faking his whole injury. Bret later apologized for these events.</p>
<p>Michaels returned to the WWF on <a href="November_23" title="wikilink">November 23</a> <a href="1998" class="uri" title="wikilink">1998</a>, but not as a wrestler; instead, he replaced <a href="Sgt._Slaughter" title="wikilink">Sgt.

In early 1999, Michaels turned face and re-joined D-Generation X, but disappeared from WWF television for a few months, and by the time he had returned DX had broken up.</p>
<p>Michaels made occasional appearances on WWF television as commissioner as a face during the spring and summer of 1999. He was supposed to turn heel once again during the premiere episode of <a href="WWE_Friday_Night_SmackDown!" title="wikilink"><em>SmackDown!</em></a> on <a href="August_26" title="wikilink">August 26</a> <a href="1999" class="uri" title="wikilink">1999</a> when, while serving as a special guest referee, he superkicked <a href="The_Rock_(entertainer)" title="wikilink">The Rock</a>, allowing Triple H to retain the <a href="WWE_Championship" title="wikilink">WWF Championship</a>.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> However, Michaels did not appear on WWF television until <a href="May_21" title="wikilink">May 21</a> <a href="2000" class="uri" title="wikilink">2000</a>, as a face, to officiate the <a href="Iron_Man_match" title="wikilink">Iron Man match</a> between the Rock and <a href="Triple_H" title="wikilink">Triple H</a>.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> He made one last appearance a month later, when he handed over the role of commissioner to <a href="Mick_Foley" title="wikilink">Mick Foley</a>, becoming the official spokesperson for the WWF. Michaels then disappeared from WWF television for nearly a year.</p>
<p>Michaels' prolonged absences were the result of his opening of the <a href="Texas_Wrestling_Academy" title="wikilink">Shawn Michaels Wrestling Academy</a> in early 1999. In February 2001, Michaels signed a multi year contract extension with the WWF.</p>

When they were about to do their trademark &quot;Suck It&quot; taunt, Triple H nailed Michaels with the <a href="Facebuster#Double_underhook_facebuster" title="wikilink">Pedigree</a>.<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> A week later, Triple H attacked Michaels from behind in a parking lot and put his head through a car window.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a> Michaels surprised everyone by challenging Triple H to &quot;a fight&quot; (a non-sanctioned match) at <a href="SummerSlam_(2002)" title="wikilink">SummerSlam</a>, which Triple H accepted.</p>
<p>Michaels returned to the ring to wrestle a match against Triple H at SummerSlam 2002, laying the foundation for a feud that lasted for years. This match was noted for Michaels' emotional in-ring return after more than four years on the shelf. Michaels won at SummerSlam but was attacked with a sledgehammer by Triple H after the match.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a></p>

<li>The song <em>Sexy Boy</em> was originally written for Michaels by <a href="Jimmy_Hart" title="wikilink">Jimmy Hart</a>. Hart thanked Michaels personally for continuing to use the song as his entrance music when he was inducted into the <a href="WWE_Hall_of_Fame" title="wikilink">WWE Hall of Fame</a> in 2005. Michaels' entrance music was originally performed by <a href="Sherri_Martel" title="wikilink">Sherri Martel</a> until she became a babyface, and then the second version was performed by Shawn Michaels himself with traces of Sherri in the chorus portion of the song. The current version of the song in use today is the version Michaels sung himself. Michaels says that the song was the product of &quot;magic&quot; because how it originally sounded right after recording was simply &quot;brutal.&quot;</li>
<li>Since the return of <a href="D-Generation_X" title="wikilink">DX</a>, Michaels mostly used the DX entrance <em>Break It Down,</em> by <a href="Chris_Warren_(musician)" title="wikilink">The Chris Warren Band</a>, even when wrestling in singles competition, but then went back to using <em>Sexy Boy</em>.</li>

<p>Growing up, Michaels was never called &quot;Michael&quot; because he hated the name, so his family and friends just called him &quot;Shawn&quot;. Ever since, he's been referred to as Shawn.<a href="#fn146" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref146"><sup>146</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1996, Michaels posed in a non-nude layout for <a href="Playgirl" class="uri" title="wikilink">Playgirl</a> <a href="magazine" class="uri" title="wikilink">magazine</a>.<a href="#fn147" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref147"><sup>147</sup></a></p>
<p>Michaels' marriage to his first wife, Theresa, was brief and ended in divorce.<a href="#fn148" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref148"><sup>148</sup></a> He is now married to former WCW <a href="Nitro_Girls" title="wikilink">Nitro Girl</a>, <a href="Rebecca_Curci" title="wikilink">Whisper (Rebecca Curci)</a>. They were married on <a href="March_31" title="wikilink">March 31</a> <a href="1999" class="uri" title="wikilink">1999</a> at the Graceland Wedding Chapel in <a href="Las_Vegas,_Nevada" title="wikilink">Las Vegas, Nevada</a>.<a href="#fn149" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref149"><sup>149</sup></a> It was a very small wedding ceremony. The only people present were Michaels, Rebecca Curci, and an <a href="Elvis_Presley" title="wikilink">Elvis</a> impersonator. Michaels and Curci have a son, Cameron Kade (born on <a href="January_5" title="wikilink">January 5</a> <a href="2000" class="uri" title="wikilink">2000</a>)<a href="#fn150" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref150"><sup>150</sup></a> and a daughter, Cheyenne Michelle (born on <a href="August_19" title="wikilink">August 19</a> <a href="2004" class="uri" title="wikilink">2004</a>)<a href="#fn151" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref151"><sup>151</sup></a></p>
<p>Michaels has several tattoos. He has a tattoo of a heart with a sword through it with what appears to be a snake around it in the shape of an &quot;S&quot;. He has one on his wedding finger, that has an <em>R</em> for his wife Rebecca. Another in his left wrist, it's a bracelet design that says: <strong>Cameron</strong> for his son. On his left leg he has a picture of his wife, the other leg has a picture of the state of Texas. Finally, he has a small broken heart with the letters &quot;HBK&quot; above it, tattooed on his right hip.</p>
<p>Michaels' return to the WWE at <a href="SummerSlam_(2002)" title="wikilink">SummerSlam 2002</a> was supposed to be a 'one night only' show; Jim Ross even informed the audience that &quot;Michaels is gonna leave us with something to remember him by&quot; and &quot;this is a one night performance from Shawn Michaels&quot;. However, after discovering he could still perform 100% in the ring, he gradually went back into wrestling full-time.</p>
<p>Michaels is <a href="cross-dominance" title="wikilink">ambidextrous</a>. He uses his right hand to draw and color and his left hand to write. He typically uses his right leg to deliver Sweet Chin Music, but sometimes uses his left leg for an <a href="Professional_wrestling_attacks#Enzuigiri" title="wikilink">enzuigiri kick</a>.</p>
<p>Michaels is a <a href="Born_again_Christianity" title="wikilink">born again Christian</a>. His ring attire often incorporates cross symbols, and while on the way to the ring, he normally gets down on his knees and mouths a prayer while his pyrotechnics go off. He has been seen in the congregation during a televised service of Cornerstone Church in his hometown of San Antonio. He also appeared on a <a href="Trinity_Broadcasting_Network" title="wikilink">Trinity Broadcasting Network</a> program along with <a href="Sting_(wrestler)" title="wikilink">Sting</a>.<a href="#fn152" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref152"><sup>152</sup></a><a href="#fn153" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref153"><sup>153</sup></a><a href="#fn154" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref154"><sup>154</sup></a></p>
<p>He is a fan of the <a href="San_Antonio_Spurs" title="wikilink">San Antonio Spurs</a>. He has been seen wearing Spurs merchandise and attending Spurs games. JBL made a reference to Michaels being a season ticket holder during the 2007 Royal Rumble Match.</p>
<p>Michaels is the cousin of former TNA talent <a href="Matt_Bentley" title="wikilink">Matt Bentley</a>.</p>
