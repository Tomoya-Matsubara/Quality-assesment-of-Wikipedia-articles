<p><strong><em>Who's Next</em></strong> is the fifth studio album by English rock band <a href="the_Who" title="wikilink">the Who</a>, released on 14 August 1971. Its origins lie in an abortive multi-media <a href="rock_opera" title="wikilink">rock opera</a> written by chief songwriter <a href="Pete_Townshend" title="wikilink">Pete Townshend</a> called <em><a href="Lifehouse_(rock_opera)" title="wikilink">Lifehouse</a></em>. The album was commercially and critically successful, and became the only one by the group to top the UK charts.</p>
<p>Townshend had begun to consider a follow-up to <em><a href="Tommy_(album)" title="wikilink">Tommy</a></em> (1969) during the latter half of 1970, and came up with <em>Lifehouse</em> as a means of integrating the band and audience together, using rock music as a means of enlightenment. The group played a series of concerts at the <a href="Young_Vic" title="wikilink">Young Vic</a> theatre in London, and recorded material at the <a href="Record_Plant" title="wikilink">Record Plant</a> studios in <a href="New_York" title="wikilink">New York</a>, before abandoning the project due to its complexity and manager <a href="Kit_Lambert" title="wikilink">Kit Lambert</a>'s addiction to hard drugs. Following the cancellation of <em>Lifehouse</em>, Townshend was persuaded to record the songs as a straightforward studio album, with assistance from recording engineer <a href="Glyn_Johns" title="wikilink">Glyn Johns</a>. After recording &quot;<a href="Won&#39;t_Get_Fooled_Again" title="wikilink">Won't Get Fooled Again</a>&quot; at <a href="Mick_Jagger" title="wikilink">Mick Jagger</a>'s house <a href="Stargroves" class="uri" title="wikilink">Stargroves</a> using the <a href="Rolling_Stones_Mobile_Studio" title="wikilink">Rolling Stones Mobile Studio</a>, the group relocated to <a href="Olympic_Studios" title="wikilink">Olympic Studios</a> where most of the material was recorded and mixed. The album makes prominent use of the <a href="synthesizer" class="uri" title="wikilink">synthesizer</a>, particularly on the tracks &quot;<a href="Baba_O&#39;Riley" title="wikilink">Baba O'Riley</a>&quot; and &quot;Won't Get Fooled Again&quot;.</p>
<p>The album was an immediate success when it was released, and has been <a href="Music_recording_sales_certification" title="wikilink">certified 3&lt;U+00D7&gt; platinum</a> by the <a href="Recording_Industry_Association_of_America" title="wikilink">RIAA</a>. It continues to be critically acclaimed, including being cited by <a href="Time_(magazine)" title="wikilink"><em>Time</em> magazine</a> as one of the best 100 albums of all time, and has been reissued on <a href="compact_disc" title="wikilink">CD</a> several times with additional material intended for <em>Lifehouse</em>. The cover artwork, featuring the group members urinating against a monolith found on a <a href="slag_heap" title="wikilink">slag heap</a>, has also achieved critical recognition and was listed as one of <a href="VH1" class="uri" title="wikilink">VH1</a>'s greatest album covers of all time.</p>
<h2 id="background-and-lifehouse">Background and Lifehouse</h2>

<p>By 1970, the Who had obtained significant critical and commercial success, but they had started to become detached from their original audience. The <a href="mod_(subculture)" title="wikilink">mod movement</a> had vanished, and the original followers from <a href="Shepherd&#39;s_Bush" title="wikilink">Shepherd's Bush</a> had grown up and acquired jobs and families. The group had started to drift apart from manager <a href="Kit_Lambert" title="wikilink">Kit Lambert</a> due to his preoccupation with their label, <a href="Track_Records" title="wikilink">Track Records</a>. They had been touring since the release of <em><a href="Tommy_(album)" title="wikilink">Tommy</a></em> the previous May, with a set that contained most of that album, but realized that millions had now seen their live performances, and <a href="Pete_Townshend" title="wikilink">Pete Townshend</a> in particular recognized that they needed to do something new. A single, &quot;<a href="The_Seeker_(The_Who_song)" title="wikilink">The Seeker</a>&quot;, and a live album, <em><a href="Live_at_Leeds" title="wikilink">Live at Leeds</a></em> were released in 1970, and an EP of new material (&quot;Water&quot;, &quot;Naked Eye&quot;, &quot;I Don't Even Know Myself&quot;, &quot;Postcard&quot; and &quot;Now I'm a Farmer&quot;) was recorded, but not released as the band felt it would not be a satisfactory follow-up to <em>Tommy</em>.</p>
<p>The album had its roots in a project called <em><a href="Lifehouse_(rock_opera)" title="wikilink">Lifehouse</a></em>. This evolved from a series of columns Townshend wrote for <em><a href="Melody_Maker" title="wikilink">Melody Maker</a></em> in August 1970, in which he discussed the importance of rock music, and in particular what the audience could do. Of all the group, he was the most keen to use music as a communication device, and wanted to branch out into other media, including film, to get away from the traditional album / tour cycle. Townshend has variously described <em>Lifehouse</em> as a futuristic <a href="rock_opera" title="wikilink">rock opera</a>, a live-recorded <a href="concept_album" title="wikilink">concept album</a> and as the music for a scripted film project. The basic plot was outlined in an interview Townshend gave to <em>Disc and Music Echo</em> on 24 October 1970. <em>Lifehouse</em> is set in the near future in a society in which music is banned and most of the population live indoors in government-controlled &quot;experience suits&quot;. A rebel, Bobby, broadcasts rock music into the suits, allowing people to remove them and become more enlightened. Some elements accurately describe future technology; for example, The Grid resembles <a href="the_internet" title="wikilink">the internet</a> and &quot;grid sleep&quot; <a href="virtual_reality" title="wikilink">virtual reality</a>.</p>
<p><img src="G-6120_2.jpg" title="fig:Pete Townshend was given a Gretsch 6120 guitar from Joe Walsh in early 1971, and it became his main electric instrument for Who&#39;s Next." alt="Pete Townshend was given a Gretsch 6120 guitar from Joe Walsh in early 1971, and it became his main electric instrument for Who&#39;s Next." width="130" /> The group held a press conference on 13 January 1971, explaining that they would be giving a series of concerts at the <a href="Young_Vic" title="wikilink">Young Vic</a> theatre, where they would develop the fictional elements of the proposed film along with the audience. After <a href="Keith_Moon" title="wikilink">Keith Moon</a> had completed his work on the film <em><a href="200_Motels" title="wikilink">200 Motels</a></em>, the group performed their first Young Vic concert on 15 February. The show included a new quadrophonic <a href="public_address_system" title="wikilink">public address system</a> which cost &lt;U+00A3&gt;30,000 and the audience was mainly invited from various organisations such as youth clubs, with only a few tickets on sale to the general public.</p>
<p>After the initial concerts, the group flew to New York's <a href="Record_Plant_Studios" title="wikilink">Record Plant Studios</a> at Lambert's suggestion, for studio recordings. The group were joined by guests <a href="Al_Kooper" title="wikilink">Al Kooper</a> on <a href="Hammond_organ" title="wikilink">Hammond organ</a>, <a href="Ken_Ascher" title="wikilink">Ken Ascher</a> on piano and <a href="Leslie_West" title="wikilink">Leslie West</a> on guitar. Townshend used a 1957 <a href="Gretsch" class="uri" title="wikilink">Gretsch</a> guitar, given to him by <a href="Joe_Walsh" title="wikilink">Joe Walsh</a>, during the session and it went on to become his main guitar for studio recording. Lambert's participation in the recording was minimal, and he proved to be unable to mix the final recordings. He had started taking hard drugs, while Townshend was drinking brandy regularly. After returning to Britain, engineer <a href="Glyn_Johns" title="wikilink">Glyn Johns</a> made safety copies of the Record Plant material but decided that it would be better to re-record it from scratch at <a href="Olympic_Sound_Studios" title="wikilink">Olympic Sound Studios</a> in <a href="Barnes,_London" title="wikilink">Barnes</a>.</p>
<p>The group gave a further series of concerts at the Young Vic on 25 and 26 April, which were recorded on the <a href="Rolling_Stones_Mobile_Studio" title="wikilink">Rolling Stones Mobile Studio</a> by <a href="Andy_Johns" title="wikilink">Andy Johns</a>, but Townshend grew disillusioned with <em>Lifehouse</em> and further shows were cancelled. The project proved to be intractable on several levels and caused stress within the band as well as a major falling out between Townshend and Lambert. Years later, in the liner notes to the remastered CD, Townshend wrote that the failure of the project led him to the verge of a <a href="nervous_breakdown" title="wikilink">nervous breakdown</a>. Audiences at the Young Vic gigs were not interested in interacting with the group to create new material, but simply wanted the Who to play &quot;<a href="My_Generation" title="wikilink">My Generation</a>&quot; and smash a guitar. At the time, <a href="Roger_Daltrey" title="wikilink">Roger Daltrey</a> said the Who &quot;were never nearer to breaking up&quot;.</p>
<p>Although the <em>Lifehouse</em> concept was abandoned, scraps of the project remained in the final album, including the use of synthesizers and computers. An early concept for <em>Lifehouse</em> featured the feeding of personal data from audience members into the controller of an early <a href="Analog_signal" title="wikilink">analogue</a> synthesizer to create a &quot;universal chord&quot; that would have ended the proposed film. Abandoning <em>Lifehouse</em> gave the group extra freedom due to the absence of an overriding musical theme or storyline (which had been the basis of <em>Tommy</em>). This allowed the band to concentrate on maximising the impact of individual tracks, and providing a unifying sound for them.</p>
<p>Although he gave up his original intentions for the <em>Lifehouse</em> project, Townshend continued to develop the concepts, revisiting them in later albums, including a 6-CD set, <em><a href="The_Lifehouse_Chronicles" title="wikilink">The Lifehouse Chronicles</a></em> in 1999. In 2007 he opened a website called <a href="The_Lifehouse_Method" title="wikilink">The Lifehouse Method</a> to accept personal input from applicants that would be turned into musical portraits.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="recording">Recording</h2>
<p><img src="Olympic_Studios,_London.jpg" title="fig:Most of Who&#39;s Next was recorded at Olympic Studios, Barnes with Glyn Johns." alt="Most of Who&#39;s Next was recorded at Olympic Studios, Barnes with Glyn Johns." /> The first session for what became <em>Who's Next</em> was at <a href="Mick_Jagger" title="wikilink">Mick Jagger</a>'s house, <a href="Stargroves" class="uri" title="wikilink">Stargroves</a>, at the start of April 1971, using the Rolling Stones Mobile. The final backing track of &quot;<a href="Won&#39;t_Get_Fooled_Again" title="wikilink">Won't Get Fooled Again</a>&quot; was recorded there. The band decided to relocate recording to Olympic at Johns' suggestion; the first session there was on 9 April, attempting a basic take of &quot;<a href="Bargain_(song)" title="wikilink">Bargain</a>&quot;. The bulk of the sessions occurred during May, when the group recorded &quot;Time is Passing&quot;, &quot;<a href="Pure_and_Easy" title="wikilink">Pure and Easy</a>&quot;, &quot;<a href="Love_Ain&#39;t_for_Keeping" title="wikilink">Love Ain't for Keeping</a>&quot; (which had been reworked from a rock track into an acoustic arrangement), &quot;<a href="Behind_Blue_Eyes" title="wikilink">Behind Blue Eyes</a>&quot;, &quot;<a href="The_Song_Is_Over" title="wikilink">The Song Is Over</a>&quot;, &quot;<a href="Let&#39;s_See_Action" title="wikilink">Let's See Action</a>&quot; and &quot;<a href="Baba_O&#39;Riley" title="wikilink">Baba O'Riley</a>&quot;. <a href="Nicky_Hopkins" title="wikilink">Nicky Hopkins</a> guested on piano, while <a href="Dave_Arbus" title="wikilink">Dave Arbus</a> was invited by Moon to play violin on &quot;Baba O'Riley&quot;. <a href="John_Entwistle" title="wikilink">John Entwistle</a>'s &quot;My Wife&quot; was added to the album at the last minute late in the sessions, and was originally intended for a solo album.</p>
<p>In contrast to the Record Plant and Young Vic sessions, recording with Johns went well as he was primarily concerned about creating a good sound, whereas Lambert had always been more preoccupied about the group's image. Townshend recalled, &quot;we were just getting astounded at the sounds Glyn was producing&quot;. Townshend used the early synthesizers and modified keyboard sounds in several modes: as a <a href="drone_(music)" title="wikilink">drone</a> effect on several songs, notably &quot;Baba O'Riley&quot; and &quot;Won't Get Fooled Again&quot;, as well as on &quot;Bargain&quot;, &quot;Going Mobile&quot; and &quot;The Song Is Over&quot;. The synthesizer was used as an integral part of the sound, as opposed to providing gloss as was the case on other artists' albums up to this point.  Moon's drumming had a distinctly different style from earlier albums, being more formal and less reliant on long drum fills &lt;U+2013&gt; partly due to the synthesizer backing, but also due to the no-nonsense production techniques of Johns, who insisted on a good recording performance that only used flamboyancy when truly necessary. Johns was instrumental in convincing the Who that they should simply put a single studio album out, believing the songs to be excellent. The group gave him free rein to assemble a single album of whatever songs he wanted in any order. Despite Johns' key contributions, he only received an associate producer credit on the finished album, though he maintained he acted mainly in an engineering capacity and based most of the arrangements on Townshend's original demos.</p>
<p><img src="ARP_2500.jpg" title="fig:An ARP synthesizer similar to the one used on Who&#39;s Next" alt="An ARP synthesizer similar to the one used on Who&#39;s Next" /> The album opened with &quot;Baba O'Riley&quot;, featuring piano and synthesizer-processed <a href="Lowrey_organ" title="wikilink">Lowrey organ</a> by Townshend. The song's title pays homage to Townshend's guru, Meher Baba, and <a href="minimalism" title="wikilink">minimalist</a> composer <a href="Terry_Riley" title="wikilink">Terry Riley</a> (and is informally known as &quot;Teenage Wasteland&quot; from a line in the lyrics). The organ track came from a longer demo by Townshend, portions of which were later included on a Baba tribute album <em>I Am</em>, that was edited down for the final recording. Townshend later said this part had &quot;two or three thousand edits to it&quot;. The opening lyrics to the next track, &quot;Bargain&quot;, &quot;I'd gladly lose me to find you&quot;, came from a phrase used by Baba. Entwistle wrote &quot;My Wife&quot; after having an argument with his wife and exaggerating the conflict in the lyrics. The track features several overdubbed brass instruments recorded in a single half-hour session. &quot;Pure and Easy&quot;, a key track from <em>Lifehouse</em>, did not make the final track selection, but the opening line was included as a coda to &quot;The Song is Over&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;Behind Blue Eyes&quot; featured three-part harmony by Daltrey, Townshend and Entwistle and was written for the main antagonist in <em>Lifehouse</em>, Brick. Moon, uncharacteristically, did not appear on the first half of the track, which was later described by Who biographer Dave Marsh as &quot;the longest time Keith Moon was still in his entire life.&quot; The closing track, &quot;Won't Get Fooled Again&quot;, was critical of revolutions. Townshend explained, &quot;a revolution is only a revolution in the long run and a lot of people are going to get hurt&quot;. The song features the Lowrey organ fed through an <a href="ARP_Instruments" title="wikilink">ARP</a> synthesizer, which came from Townshend's original demo and was re-used for the finished track.</p>

<p>The <a href="cover_artwork" title="wikilink">cover artwork</a> shows a photograph, taken at <a href="Easington_Colliery" title="wikilink">Easington Colliery</a>, of the band apparently having just urinated on a large concrete piling protruding from a <a href="slag_heap" title="wikilink">slag heap</a>. According to photographer <a href="Ethan_Russell" title="wikilink">Ethan Russell</a>, most of the band members were unable to urinate, so rainwater was tipped from an empty film canister to achieve the desired effect. The rear cover showed the band backstage at <a href="De_Montfort_Hall" title="wikilink">De Montfort Hall</a>, <a href="Leicester" class="uri" title="wikilink">Leicester</a>, amongst a debris of furniture.  In 2003, the television channel <a href="VH1" class="uri" title="wikilink">VH1</a> named <em>Who's Next</em>'s cover one of the greatest album covers of all time.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>Other suggestions for the cover included the group urinating against a <a href="Marshall_Stack" title="wikilink">Marshall Stack</a> and an overweight nude woman with the Who's faces in place of her genitalia. An alternative cover featuring Moon dressed in black <a href="lingerie" class="uri" title="wikilink">lingerie</a> and a brown wig, holding a whip, was later used for the inside art for the 1995 and 2003 CD releases. Some of the photographs taken during these sessions were later used as part of Decca's United States promotion of the album.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="release">Release</h2>
<p>The opening single, &quot;Won't Get Fooled Again&quot; (edited down to three and a half minutes), was released on 25 June 1971 in the UK and 17 July in the US ahead of the album. It reached #9 and #15 in the charts respectively. The album was released on 14 August in the US and 27 August in the UK. It became the only album by the Who to top the UK charts.</p>
<p><img src="The_Who_at_Charlotte,_NC_(1971).jpg" title="fig:The Who playing in Charlotte, North Carolina, shortly after Who&#39;s Next was released" alt="The Who playing in Charlotte, North Carolina, shortly after Who&#39;s Next was released" /> The Who starting touring the US just before the album was released. The group used the <em>Lifehouse</em> PA, though soundman <a href="Bob_Pridden" title="wikilink">Bob Pridden</a> found the technical requirements of the equipment to be over-complicated. The set list was revamped, and while it included a smaller selection of numbers from <em>Tommy</em>, several new numbers from the new album such as &quot;My Wife&quot;, &quot;Baba O'Riley&quot; and &quot;Won't Get Fooled Again&quot; became live favourites. The latter two songs involved the band playing to a <a href="backing_track" title="wikilink">backing track</a> containing the synthesizer parts. The tour moved to the UK in September, including a show at <a href="The_Oval" title="wikilink">The Oval</a>, <a href="Kennington" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kennington</a> in front of 35,000 fans, and the opening gig at the <a href="Rainbow_Theatre" title="wikilink">Rainbow Theatre</a> in Finsbury Park, before going back to the US, ending in <a href="Seattle" class="uri" title="wikilink">Seattle</a> on December 15. The group then took eight months off touring, the longest break of their career at that point.</p>
<p>Several additional songs recorded at the <em>Who's Next</em> sessions were released later as singles or on compilations. &quot;Let's See Action&quot; was released as a single in 1971, followed by &quot;Join Together&quot; in June 1972 and &quot;Relay&quot; in November. &quot;Pure and Easy&quot;, &quot;Put The Money Down&quot; and &quot;Too Much of Anything&quot; were released on the album <em><a href="Odds_&amp;_Sods" title="wikilink">Odds &amp; Sods</a></em>, while &quot;Time is Passing&quot; was added to the 1998 CD version.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> A cover of &quot;Baby Don't You Do It&quot; was recorded and the longest version currently available is on the deluxe edition of the album.</p>
<p>The album has been re-issued remastered several times using tapes from different sessions. The master tapes for the Olympic sessions are believed to be lost, as <a href="Virgin_Records" title="wikilink">Virgin Records</a> threw out a substantial number of old recordings when they purchased the studio in the 1980s. Video game publisher <a href="Harmonix" class="uri" title="wikilink">Harmonix</a> wanted to release <em>Who's Next</em> as downloadable, playable content for the <a href="music_video_game" title="wikilink">music video game</a> series <em><a href="Rock_Band" title="wikilink">Rock Band</a></em>, but were unable to do so due to difficulty finding the original <a href="multi_track_recording" title="wikilink">multi track recordings</a>. Instead, a compilation of Who songs dubbed &quot;The Best of The Who,&quot; which includes three of the album's songs (&quot;Behind Blue Eyes&quot;, &quot;Baba O'Riley&quot;, and &quot;Going Mobile&quot;), was released as downloadable content, in lieu of the earlier-promised <em>Who's Next</em> album.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> The 16-track tapes to &quot;Won't Get Fooled Again&quot; and the 8-track tapes to the other material except &quot;Bargain&quot; and &quot;Getting In Tune&quot; have since been discovered.</p>
