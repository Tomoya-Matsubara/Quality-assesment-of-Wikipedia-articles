<p><strong>Stuyvesant High School</strong> (commonly <strong>Stuy</strong>) is a <a href="public_high_school" title="wikilink">public high school</a> in <a href="New_York_City" title="wikilink">New York City</a> that specializes in <a href="mathematics" title="wikilink">math</a> and <a href="science" class="uri" title="wikilink">science</a>. It is one of several <a href="Specialized_High_Schools_of_New_York_City" title="wikilink">specialized schools</a> run by the <a href="New_York_City_Department_of_Education" title="wikilink">New York City Department of Education</a>. The school opened in 1904 on <a href="Manhattan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Manhattan</a>'s East Side, and it only admitted boys for 65 years. Since 1969, Stuyvesant has been a <a href="coeducation" title="wikilink">coeducational</a> school, and after moving to its <a href="Battery_Park_City,_Manhattan" title="wikilink">Battery Park City</a> building, the facilities for girls were put on par with those for boys.</p>
<p>Admission to Stuyvesant is by <a href="Specialized_High_Schools_Admissions_Test" title="wikilink">competitive examination</a> and is open to all residents of New York City with no <a href="tuition" class="uri" title="wikilink">tuition</a> fee. The school is noted for its <a href="List_of_Stuyvesant_High_School_people" title="wikilink">famous alumni</a>, its academics, and the large number of its graduates attending prestigious universities. There has been a friendly long-standing rivalry between Stuyvesant and the <a href="Bronx_High_School_of_Science" title="wikilink">Bronx High School of Science</a> over students' awards from the <a href="Intel_Science_Talent_Search" title="wikilink">Intel Science Talent Search</a>, with both schools claiming dominance at various times.</p>
<p>Classes were in session at Stuyvesant when a terrorist attack destroyed the nearby <a href="World_Trade_Center" title="wikilink">World Trade Center</a> towers, and the school building served as a command post for several weeks afterwards. The school was temporarily relocated and shared facilities with <a href="Brooklyn_Technical_High_School" title="wikilink">Brooklyn Technical High School</a> until it could return to its own building. The special issue of the <em>The Stuyvesant Spectator</em> on the tragedy was reprinted in <em><a href="The_New_York_Times" title="wikilink">The New York Times</a></em>.</p>
<p>Stuyvesant High School routinely engages well-known cultural, academic, and political figures to speak at its annual <a href="graduation" title="wikilink">commencement ceremonies</a>. Former U.S. President <a href="Bill_Clinton" title="wikilink">Bill Clinton</a> addressed the Class of 2002; United Nations Secretary General <a href="Kofi_Annan" title="wikilink">Kofi Annan</a> addressed the Class of 2004; and late night talk show host <a href="Conan_O&#39;Brien" title="wikilink">Conan O'Brien</a> addressed the Class of 2006.</p>
<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<p><img src="Old-stuy-building-1909.gif" title="fig:Postcard art featuring the 15th Street Stuyvesant building" alt="Postcard art featuring the 15th Street Stuyvesant building" /> Stuyvesant High School is named after <a href="Peter_Stuyvesant" title="wikilink">Peter Stuyvesant</a>, the last <a href="Netherlands" title="wikilink">Dutch</a> governor of <a href="New_Netherland" title="wikilink">New Netherland</a> before the ownership of the colony was transferred to <a href="England" class="uri" title="wikilink">England</a> in 1664.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>The school was established in 1904 as a <a href="Vocational_education" title="wikilink">manual training</a> school for boys, hosting 155 students and 12 teachers. In 1907, it moved from its original location at 225 East <a href="23rd_Street_(Manhattan)" title="wikilink">23rd Street</a> to 345 East 15th Street, where it remained for the following 85 years. Its reputation for excellence in math and science continued to grow, and enrollment was restricted based on previous scholastic achievement starting in 1919.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>The school went on a double session plan in 1919 to accommodate the rising number of students. The practice allowed double use of classroom space, with some students attending in the morning and others in the afternoon and early evening. All students still studied a full set of courses. Double sessions would run until 1956.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> <a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>In the 1930s, entrance examinations were implemented, making admission to the school even more competitive. During the 1950s, the building underwent a $2 million renovation to update its classrooms, shops, libraries and cafeterias.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1969, 14 girls enrolled at Stuyvesant, marking the school's first co-educational year. Now, approximately 43% of students are female.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1957, a team of 50 students began construction of a <a href="cyclotron" class="uri" title="wikilink">cyclotron</a>, a project sponsored by the physics department. By 1962, a low-power test of the device succeeded. Matt Deming '62 remembered that a later attempt at full-power operation &quot;tanked the electrical system for the building and surrounding area&quot;.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> <a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> According to Abraham Baumel, Stuyvesant principal from 1983 to 1994, &quot;... I can tell you with certainty that the cyclotron never worked at Stuyvesant any more than it did for <a href="Ernest_Lawrence" title="wikilink">Ernest Lawrence</a>, and he was awarded a Nobel Prize for his invention of the cyclotron. The Russians never succeeded in getting one to work, either&quot;.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> <img src="Bender_with_cyclotron.jpg" title="fig:Teacher Alfred Bender with the cyclotron" alt="Teacher Alfred Bender with the cyclotron" /> In 1972, Brooklyn Tech, Bronx Science, Stuyvesant and <a href="Fiorello_H._LaGuardia_High_School_of_Music_&amp;_Art_and_Performing_Arts" title="wikilink">Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School of Music &amp; Art and Performing Arts</a> were chosen by the New York State Legislature as specialized high schools of New York City. The act called for a uniform exam to be administered for admission to Brooklyn Tech, Bronx Science and Stuyvesant High School. The exam, named the <a href="Specialized_High_Schools_Admissions_Test" title="wikilink">Specialized High Schools Admissions Test</a> (SHSAT), tested students in math and science. Admission to LaGuardia High School was by audition rather than examination, in keeping with its artistic mission.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<p>In the late 1980s and early 1990s, at least four Stuyvesant teachers died from <a href="AIDS" class="uri" title="wikilink">AIDS</a>.</p>
<p>In 1992, a new, waterfront building was constructed to house the high school (see <a href="Stuyvesant_High_School#School_facilities" title="wikilink">school facilities</a>).</p>
<p>Stuyvesant is a quarter-mile (approx. 400 metres) from <a href="World_Trade_Center_site" title="wikilink">the former site</a> of the World Trade Center, which was destroyed on <a href="September_11,_2001_attacks" title="wikilink">September 11, 2001</a>. The school was evacuated during the ordeal and the students were temporarily relocated to Brooklyn Tech starting <a href="September_21" title="wikilink">September 21</a> while the Stuyvesant building was used as one of several bases of operations by rescue and recovery workers. This caused serious congestion at Brooklyn Tech and required the students to go to school in two shifts. Normal classes resumed three weeks later on <a href="October_9" title="wikilink">October 9</a>. <img src="Spectator_9-11.jpg" title="fig:The 9/11 issue of The Spectator." alt="The 9/11 issue of The Spectator." width="150" /> Because of Stuyvesant's close proximity to <a href="Ground_zero#World_Trade_Center" title="wikilink">Ground Zero</a>, some were initially concerned about the possibility of <a href="asbestos" class="uri" title="wikilink">asbestos</a> exposure to Stuyvesant. Indeed, the Stuyvesant High School Parents' Association has contested that the <a href="United_States_Environmental_Protection_Agency" title="wikilink">US Environmental Protection Agency</a>'s (EPA) initial suggestion that the area was safe is not accurate.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> However, the EPA indicated at that time that Stuyvesant was safe from asbestos. Some problems have been reported, including respiratory problems of former teacher Mark Bodenheimer, who accepted a transfer to The Bronx High School of Science after having difficulty continuing his work at Stuyvesant. Other isolated cases similar to Bodenheimer's have been reported. Nonetheless, there is no definite evidence that such cases relate to Stuyvesant at all, and current exposure to asbestos at Stuyvesant is improbable. </p>
<p>Alumni who were killed during the September 11 attack on the World Trade Center include Daniel D. Bergstein '80 <a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a>, Alan Wayne Friedlander '67 <a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a>, Marina R. Gertsberg '93 <a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a>, Aaron J. Horwitz '94 <a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a>, David S. Lee '82 <a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a>, Arnold A. Lim '90 <a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a>, Gregory D. Richards '88 <a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a>, <a href="sep11:Maurita_Tam" title="wikilink">Maurita Tam</a> '97 <a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> and Michael Warchola '68 <a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a>. <a href="Richard_Ben-Veniste" title="wikilink">Richard Ben-Veniste</a> '60 was on the <a href="9/11_Commission" title="wikilink">9/11 Commission</a>.</p>
<p>On <a href="October_2" title="wikilink">October 2</a> <a href="2001" class="uri" title="wikilink">2001</a>, the school paper, <em>The Spectator</em>, included a special full-color 9/11 insert containing student photos, reflections and stories. The insert was reprinted in the <a href="November_20" title="wikilink">November 20</a> <a href="2001" class="uri" title="wikilink">2001</a> issue of <em><a href="The_New_York_Times" title="wikilink">The New York Times</a></em>. <img src="With_their_eyes.jpg" title="fig:With Their Eyes" alt="With Their Eyes" width="150" /> In the months after 9/11, Annie Thoms, an English teacher at Stuyvesant, a 1993 alumna, and the theater adviser at the time, suggested that the students take accounts of staff and students' reactions during and after 9/11 and turn them into a series of monologues. Thoms then published these monologues as <em>With Their Eyes: September 11th &lt;U+2013&gt; The View from a High School at Ground Zero</em> (ISBN 0060517182). Alexander Epstein of <em>The Stuyvesant Standard</em> <a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a>, an independent newspaper serving the school's community, contributed the section <em>Out of the Blue</em> to the book <em>At Ground Zero: Young Reporters Who Were There Tell Their Stories</em> (ISBN 1560254270).</p>
<p>In the early 2000s, Gary He '02 started the now-defunct stuynet.com, a website where students could rate their teachers, although he later shut down the evaluation section after mathematics teacher Bruce Winokur threatened a libel suit. Words left on the website read &quot;Teacher Evaluations is currently down but will soon be back better than ever. The vox populi must be heard&quot;.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> <a href="image:Stuy100logo.jpg" title="wikilink">right|90px|Stuyvesant centennial logo</a> When Stuyvesant's official web site crashed on <a href="September_11" title="wikilink">September 11</a> <a href="2001" class="uri" title="wikilink">2001</a>, and during the days right after, Gary He's website was the only online source of information and moral support for the distraught Stuyvesant community. Stuynet.com now lives on under its new alias, stuycom.net.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a></p>
<p>During the 2003-2004 school year, Stuyvesant celebrated the 100th anniversary of its founding with a full year of activities. Events included a parade from the 15<sup>th</sup> Street building to the Chambers Street one; a meeting of the <a href="National_Consortium_for_Specialized_Secondary_Schools_of_Mathematics,_Science_and_Technology" title="wikilink">National Consortium for Specialized Secondary Schools of Mathematics, Science and Technology</a>; an all-class reunion; and visits and speeches from notable alumni. <a href="United_Nations_Secretary-General" title="wikilink">United Nations Secretary General</a> <a href="Kofi_Annan" title="wikilink">Kofi Annan</a> spoke at the graduation of Stuyvesant's class of 2004.<br />
</p>
<h2 id="enrollment">Enrollment</h2>
<p>Stuyvesant has a total enrollment of about 3,200 and is open to residents of New York City entering either <a href="ninth_grade" title="wikilink">ninth</a> or <a href="tenth_grade" title="wikilink">tenth grade</a>. Enrollment is based solely on performance on the <a href="Specialized_High_Schools_Admissions_Test" title="wikilink">Specialized High School Admission Test</a> (SHSAT).<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> The list of schools using the SHSAT has since grown to include all of New York's specialized high schools except LaGuardia High School, where entry is by audition rather than examination. Since its relocation to its <a href="Battery_Park_City,_Manhattan" title="wikilink">Battery Park City</a> campus, the test score necessary for admission to Stuyvesant has been higher than that needed for admission to the other schools using the test.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> Admission is currently based on an individual's score on the examination and his or her pre-submitted ranking of Stuyvesant among the other specialized schools. Each year, about 22,000 of New York City's 90,000 <a href="eighth_grade" title="wikilink">eighth-graders</a> sit for the test, with only approximately 800 highest scoring applicants are admitted to their first choice school. Ninth and rising tenth graders are also eligible to take the test for enrollment, though far fewer students are admitted this way.</p>

<p>Those who score in the second-highest score bracket are offered admission to their second-choice school, while those who score in the third-highest bracket are offered admission to their third choice school. According to Article 12 of New York education law, &quot;Admissions to the Bronx High School of Science, Stuyvesant High School, and Brooklyn Technical High School shall be solely and exclusively by taking a competitive, objective, and scholastic achievement examination, which shall be open to each and every child in the city of New York&quot;.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> The current admission policy is available from the NYC Department of Education.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> According to the Department of Education, Stuyvesant accepts students solely based on their performance on the SHSAT, although former Mayor <a href="John_Lindsay" title="wikilink">John Lindsay</a> and community activist group <a href="Association_of_Community_Organizations_for_Reform_Now" title="wikilink">ACORN</a> have argued that the exam may be biased against <a href="African_American" title="wikilink">African</a> and <a href="Hispanic" title="wikilink">Hispanic Americans</a>. <a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a></p>
<p>Stuyvesant has contributed to the education of several <a href="Nobel_Prize" title="wikilink">Nobel</a> laureates, winners of the <a href="Fields_Medal" title="wikilink">Fields Medal</a> and the <a href="Wolf_Prize" title="wikilink">Wolf Prize</a>, and a host of other accomplished alumni. It consistently leads the nation in the number of <a href="National_Merit_Scholarship_Program" title="wikilink">National Merit Scholarships</a> awarded and regularly trades off the leading position in the number of Intel Science Talent Search Semi-Finalists and Finalists with Bronx Science.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a><a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a><a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a><a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a><a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a><a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a><a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> Stuyvesant sends nearly all its students off to four year universities, and around 15 percent go on to the <a href="Ivy_League" title="wikilink">Ivy League</a>. Stuyvesant graduates have an average <a href="SAT" class="uri" title="wikilink">SAT</a> score of about 1400 (685 verbal, 723 math).<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> Recently, there were two students who achieved perfect scores on their SAT I and SAT II tests, an unusual accomplishment. Stuyvesant also was the high school with the highest number of <a href="Advanced_Placement_Program" title="wikilink">Advanced Placement</a> exams taken, and also the highest number of students reaching the mastery level.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="school-facilities">School facilities</h2>
<p><img src="Stuyvesant-library-interior.jpg" title="fig:Interior of the library, showing the new computers that were installed in late 2005." alt="Interior of the library, showing the new computers that were installed in late 2005." /> <img src="Stuyescalator.JPG" title="fig:The seventh-to-ninth floor escalators." alt="The seventh-to-ninth floor escalators." /> <img src="Danny-Jaye---Rothenberg-mem.jpg" title="fig:The Rothenberg memorial." alt="The Rothenberg memorial." /> By the 1980s, the East 15th Street building was no longer a quality educational facility by modern standards, and the number of students had also increased to several thousand and could not be accommodated by the five-story building. The New York City Board of Education secured an agreement with the Battery Park City Authority for a new building, and construction began in 1989. The new ten-floor building, located near lower Manhattan's <a href="Financial_District,_Manhattan" title="wikilink">financial district</a>, was constructed at a cost of about $148 million, and included 65 classrooms with about 450 computers on 13 networks, 7 pairs of <a href="escalator" title="wikilink">escalators</a>, various indoor sporting facilities including two <a href="gym" title="wikilink">gymnasiums</a> and a pool built to <a href="PSAL" title="wikilink">Public Schools Athletic League</a> standards, a theater with acoustics and lighting to accommodate music and drama productions, two lecture halls with movable partitions, a skylit <a href="cafeteria" class="uri" title="wikilink">cafeteria</a> overlooking the <a href="Hudson_River" title="wikilink">Hudson River</a>, 12 science laboratories (including a <a href="molecular_biology" title="wikilink">molecular biology</a> lab and an <a href="analytical_chemistry" title="wikilink">analytical chemistry</a> lab) and special shops for instruction in <a href="ceramics_(art)" title="wikilink">ceramics</a>, <a href="photography" class="uri" title="wikilink">photography</a>, <a href="Woodworking" title="wikilink">wood</a>, <a href="plastic" title="wikilink">plastics</a>, <a href="metalworking" title="wikilink">metal work</a>, <a href="robot" title="wikilink">robotics</a> and energy studies. One room in the Stuyvesant building, called the &quot;Museum Room&quot;, was built as a replica of a room in the 15<sup>th</sup> Street Stuyvesant building, with desks, chairs, a table and blackboard brought from there, as well as paint and flooring in its style. The room was dedicated to teacher Dr. A. Edward Stefanacci, who died in 1993. The school's library has a capacity of 40,000 volumes and overlooks Battery Park City.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a></p>
<p>The New York City Department of Education reports that public per student spending at Stuyvesant is slightly lower than the city average.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> However, Stuyvesant also receives some private contributions.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> Shortly after the new building was completed, the $10 million TriBeCa Bridge was built to allow students to enter the building without having to cross the busy West Street.</p>
<p>The new building is one of the 5 additional sites of P721M, a school for older (aged 15-21) students with multiple <a href="disability" title="wikilink">disabilities</a> and <a href="mental_retardation" title="wikilink">mental retardation</a>. Wheelchair-bound students can sometimes be seen throughout the building. Some teachers remark on the unusual <a href="juxtaposition" class="uri" title="wikilink">juxtaposition</a> of the <a href="gifted" class="uri" title="wikilink">gifted</a> with the disabled.</p>
<p>Glass boxes set into various places in the building's wall hold mementos from the year of each graduating class. Items displayed include water from most large rivers, mud from the <a href="Dead_Sea" title="wikilink">Dead Sea</a>, a <a href="American_Revolutionary_War" title="wikilink">Revolutionary War</a> button, pieces of the 15<sup>th</sup> Street Stuyvesant building and of monuments around the world, and various chemical compounds. In 1997, the eastern end of the mathematics floor (in which the math department office is located) was dedicated to Dr. Richard Rothenberg, the math department chairman before his death from a sudden heart attack in 1997. The Rothenberg memorial, commissioned in his honor, is a wall made up of 49 of these boxes, each featuring a concept in mathematics.</p>
<h2 id="academics">Academics</h2>
<p>Stuyvesant students undergo a <a href="university-preparatory_school" title="wikilink">college preparatory</a> curriculum including four years of <a href="English_language" title="wikilink">English</a>, <a href="history" class="uri" title="wikilink">history</a>, and a laboratory-based <a href="science" class="uri" title="wikilink">science</a>, three years of <a href="mathematics" title="wikilink">math</a> (though most students opt to take four years) and foreign language, a semester each of introductory <a href="art" class="uri" title="wikilink">art</a>, <a href="music" class="uri" title="wikilink">music</a>, <a href="health" class="uri" title="wikilink">health</a>, <a href="computer_science" title="wikilink">computer science</a>, and two lab-based technology courses (although there are several exemptions by which students may be excused from technology education in their senior years).<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a><a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a></p>
<p>Stuyvesant offers students a broad selection of elective courses. Some of the more unusual offerings include robotics, <a href="musical_acoustics" title="wikilink">physics of music</a>, <a href="astronomy" class="uri" title="wikilink">astronomy</a>, and the mathematics of <a href="financial_market" title="wikilink">financial markets</a>.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> Most students take <a href="calculus" class="uri" title="wikilink">calculus</a>, and the school offers math courses through <a href="differential_equation" title="wikilink">differential equations</a> and <a href="linear_algebra" title="wikilink">linear algebra</a>. A year of <a href="technical_drawing" title="wikilink">technical drawing</a> used to be required; students learned how to draft by hand in its first semester and how to draft using a computer (CAD) in the second. Now, students take a one-semester class called Technology Graphic Communications (equivalent to the former year of drafting), and a semester of introductory computer science in order to introduce the mainly science-oriented students to computer programming early in their careers.</p>

<p>A variety of Advanced Placement courses (31 are available at Stuyvesant <a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a>) offer students the chance to earn college credits. A few students earn enough college credit to start college as sophomores. In 2004, Stuyvesant began complying with Department of Education regulations mandating that <a href="Advanced_Placement_Program" title="wikilink">Advanced Placement</a> courses be weighted by a factor of 1.1 in <a href="grade_(education)#United_States" title="wikilink">grade point averages</a>. However, this caused widespread outcry among students, faculty, and teachers, and in 2005, Stuyvesant was granted special permission to revert the weight of AP courses back to 1. </p>
<p>Computer science enthusiasts can take two additional computer programming courses after the completion of advanced placement computer science: systems level programming and <a href="computer_graphics" title="wikilink">computer graphics</a>. There is also a 2 year <a href="computer_networking" title="wikilink">computer networking</a> sequence which can earn students <a href="Cisco_Career_Certifications" title="wikilink">Cisco Certified Network Associate</a> (CCNA) certification.</p>
<p>Stuyvesant's foreign language offerings rival those of many colleges, including the basics like <a href="French_language" title="wikilink">French</a> and <a href="Spanish_language" title="wikilink">Spanish</a> as well as <a href="German_language" title="wikilink">German</a>, <a href="Latin" class="uri" title="wikilink">Latin</a>, <a href="Hebrew_language" title="wikilink">Hebrew</a>, <a href="Japanese_language" title="wikilink">Japanese</a>, and <a href="Italian_language" title="wikilink">Italian</a>. In 2000, <a href="Chinese_language" title="wikilink">Mandarin Chinese</a> and <a href="Korean_language" title="wikilink">Korean</a> for native speakers were introduced in response to Stuyvesant's burgeoning <a href="Asian_American" title="wikilink">Asian American</a> population. Courses are also offered in <a href="Arabic_language" title="wikilink">Arabic</a> and <a href="Greek_language" title="wikilink">Greek</a>, but these courses, along with Korean, may only be taken as electives.</p>
<p>Stuyvesant's <a href="Biology" class="uri" title="wikilink">Biology</a> and Geo-science department offers courses in molecular biology (a course sequence comprised of a molecular science class in the Fall and a molecular genetics class in the Spring), <a href="human_physiology" title="wikilink">human physiology</a>, <a href="medical_ethics" title="wikilink">medical ethics</a>, medical and veterinary diagnosis, human disease, <a href="anthropology" class="uri" title="wikilink">anthropology</a> and <a href="sociobiology" class="uri" title="wikilink">sociobiology</a>, <a href="vertebrate_zoology" title="wikilink">vertebrate zoology</a>, <a href="laboratory" class="uri" title="wikilink">laboratory</a> techniques, medical human <a href="genetics" class="uri" title="wikilink">genetics</a>, <a href="botany" class="uri" title="wikilink">botany</a>, the molecular basis of cancer, nutrition science, and <a href="psychology" class="uri" title="wikilink">psychology</a>.

<p>Stuyvesant has recently entered into an agreement with <a href="City_College_of_New_York" title="wikilink">City College of New York</a>, in which the college funds advanced after-school courses that are taken for college credit but taught by Stuyvesant teachers. Some of these courses include physical chemistry, linear algebra, advanced Euclidean geometry, and women's history. <a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> <a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a></p>
<p>Grade point averages at Stuyvesant are calculated to two decimal places; some argue that the distinction is overly fine and encourages excessive grade competition, while others use the theory of <a href="significant_figures" title="wikilink">significant digits</a> to argue that they are irrelevant. Nevertheless, the practice continues. The practice is not entirely unprecedented; in calculations for honors and other designations, the <a href="University_of_Chicago" title="wikilink">University of Chicago</a> calculates grade point averages to four decimal places. <br />

<p>Stuyvesant fields 26 <a href="varsity_team" title="wikilink">varsity teams</a>, including a <a href="swimming" class="uri" title="wikilink">swimming</a> team, as well as <a href="golf" class="uri" title="wikilink">golf</a>, <a href="bowling" class="uri" title="wikilink">bowling</a>, <a href="volleyball" class="uri" title="wikilink">volleyball</a>, <a href="football_(soccer)" title="wikilink">soccer</a>, <a href="basketball" class="uri" title="wikilink">basketball</a>, <a href="gymnastics" class="uri" title="wikilink">gymnastics</a>, <a href="amateur_wrestling" title="wikilink">wrestling</a>, <a href="fencing" class="uri" title="wikilink">fencing</a>, <a href="baseball" class="uri" title="wikilink">baseball</a>/<a href="softball" class="uri" title="wikilink">softball</a>, <a href="team_handball" title="wikilink">handball</a>, <a href="tennis" class="uri" title="wikilink">tennis</a>, <a href="Athletics" title="wikilink">track</a>/<a href="Cross_country_running" title="wikilink">cross country</a>, <a href="cricket" class="uri" title="wikilink">cricket</a> and <a href="American_football" title="wikilink">football</a> teams. In addition, Stuyvesant club teams include boys' varsity and junior varsity, and girls' varsity <a href="Ultimate_(sport)" title="wikilink">Ultimate</a> teams. The Stuyvesant Track and Field team were <a href="PSAL" title="wikilink">Public Schools Athletic League</a> Cross Country City Champions in 2004 and 2005. The Stuyvesant Swimming Team, the Pirates, have been PSAL City Champions consecutively since 2000 and Opens champions since 1995. The Stuyvesant Bowling Team has been the PSAL Manhattan Borough Champion consecutively since 1990. The girls soccer team, the Mimbas, brought home the City Championship title in 2001, 2004, and 2005, despite a severe lack of practice space and lack of a home field. </p>
<p>Unlike most American high schools, every sports team at Stuyvesant has its own name, like the Peaches (softball), the Ballers (boys soccer), the Penguins (girls swimming), the Phoenix (girls basketball), and the Mimbas (girls soccer). These names tend to change with time and lend each Stuyvesant team a unique flavor.</p>
<p>In 2000, Stuyvesant added a varsity ice hockey team, the first public school in New York City to do so. The team was run by students without administrative assistance for several years. There is also an annual alumni game, where notable Stuyvesant alumni hockey players such as Tim Robbins and Len Berman often appear. The team has been in first place in its 8-team <a href="Chelsea_Piers" title="wikilink">Chelsea Piers</a> league every year, though it often plays teams from outside the league. Stuyvesant is also a powerhouse in fencing with a string of city championships from 1986 through 1989. Stuyvesant does not, however, have a football field, baseball field, or tennis court, though the new building does have a pool. <a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="clubs">Clubs</h3>
<p>Stuyvesant offers clubs, publications, teams and other opportunities under a system similar to that of many colleges.

Other debating clubs include <a href="Junior_State_of_America" title="wikilink">Junior State of America</a> (a political debate club) and <a href="Model_United_Nations" title="wikilink">Model United Nations</a>. The Stuyvesant Theater Community puts on three student-run productions a year (a fall <a href="musical_theatre" title="wikilink">musical</a>, a winter <a href="drama" class="uri" title="wikilink">drama</a>, and a spring <a href="comedy" class="uri" title="wikilink">comedy</a>) as well as a one-act festival and several smaller studio productions. <a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a></p>

<h4 id="the-spectator">The Spectator</h4>
<p><em>The Spectator</em> is Stuyvesant's official school <a href="newspaper" class="uri" title="wikilink">newspaper</a>. It contains 11 sections: news, features, <a href="editorial" title="wikilink">op-ed</a>, arts &amp; entertainment, sports, photography, art, layout, copy, business, and web. The departments are each headed by at least two editors, all of whom encompass the editorial board of the paper. The editorial board meets daily in the Spectator <a href="journalism" class="uri" title="wikilink">journalism</a> class and is headed by the Editor in Chief and Managing Editor. At the start of their term, the Editor in Chief and Managing Editor select four editors to be members of the Managing Board, a group that advises the Editor in Chief and Managing Editor on matters relating to the paper. There are over 250 total staff members who help to produce the bi-weekly publication. The Spectator is independent from the school, but it remains the prime news source for students, teachers, and adminstrators.</p>
<p>The Spectator, founded in 1915, is one of Stuyvesant's oldest publications.<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a> It has a long-standing connection with its older namesake, <a href="Columbia_University" title="wikilink">Columbia University's</a> <em><a href="Columbia_Daily_Spectator" title="wikilink">Columbia Daily Spectator</a></em>, and it has been recognized by the <a href="Columbia_University_Graduate_School_of_Journalism" title="wikilink">Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism's</a> <a href="Columbia_Scholastic_Press_Association" title="wikilink">Columbia Scholastic Press Association</a> on several occasions, most recently in 2002.<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a></p>
<h4 id="the-stuyvesant-standard">The Stuyvesant Standard</h4>
<p>Founded in 2001, <em>The Stuyvesant Standard</em> is a bi-weekly, independent newspaper published by Stuyvesant students for the community in and around the school. It covers news at school, city, state, national and international levels and contains &quot;interest sections&quot; such as Business, Science, Literary and Puzzle (Leisure), alongside the standard departments of Opinions, Sports, and Arts &amp; Entertainment. Always a laboratory for innovative columns, its current columns include: &quot;Meet This Teacher,&quot; &quot;The Critical Lens,&quot; a space on students' opinions, &quot;Sports Beat&quot; and &quot;Tomorrow's Technology Today.&quot; The Standard is distributed within Stuyvesant and throughout the surrounding community.</p>
<p>Despite its youth, The Standard is now one of the largest organizations at Stuyvesant. Its alumni remain close to the current staff and are very active in the paper.</p>

The entire production is written, produced, and funded by students. Their involvement ranges from cast, chorus, Irish Jig, Step, Bollywood Dance, Latin Dance, and tech crews. SING! begins in late November and culminates in final performances on three nights in March/April. The show sells out all three nights, raising over $30,000 for Stuyvesant's Clubs and Pubs via the Student Union Budget. </p>

<p>Jeffrey Hart wrote for the <em><a href="The_Dartmouth_Review" title="wikilink">Dartmouth Review</a></em>, &quot;When I went to Stuyvesant [in 1944], it was about 85% Jewish.

<p>New York City Department of Education statistics reveal that as of 2005, the student body was approximately 51% Asian and 38% Caucasian, with Blacks and Hispanics each constituting roughly three percent of the population. <a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a> Russian and Indian students are well-represented, and Jews continue to maintain a strong presence.

<h4 id="accusations-of-bias-in-admission-tests">Accusations of bias in admission tests</h4>
<p><img src="ACORNlogo.gif" title="fig:ACORN argued that the SHSAT was biased against minorities." alt="ACORN argued that the SHSAT was biased against minorities." /> The school's off-center demographic profile and relative paucity of Black and Hispanic students have often been a source of consternation for some city administrators. John Lindsay, mayor of New York City from 1966 to 1973, argued that the test was culturally biased against Black and Hispanic students and sought to implement an <a href="affirmative_action" title="wikilink">affirmative action</a> program. At the protest of parents, however, the plan was scrapped and led to the passage of Article 12, stating that admissions would continue to be by examination only. Despite this, however, a small number of students judged to be economically disadvantaged and who come within a few points of the cut-off score may be given an extra chance to pass the test. <a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1996 community activist group ACORN published two reports called &quot;Secret Apartheid&quot; and &quot;Secret Apartheid II&quot;, calling the SHSAT &quot;permanently suspect&quot; and a &quot;product of an institutional racism&quot;, and claiming that Black and Hispanic students did not have access to proper test preparation materials. <a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a>Along with Schools Chancellor Rudy Crew, they began an initiative for more diversity in NY's gifted and specialized schools, in particular demanding that since only a few districts send the majority of Stuyvesant's and Bronx Sciences's students, that the SHSAT be suspended altogether &quot;until the Board of Education can show that the students of each middle school in the system have had access to curricula and instruction that would prepare them for this test regardless of their color or economic status&quot;. Jesse Shapiro, Stuyvesant valedictorian, and Micah C. Lasher, then a sophomore, published several editorials in response, and the outcome was averted. <a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a> <a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a></p>

On the 6th floor is the Asian <a href="clique" class="uri" title="wikilink">clique</a>. The 5th floor is Blacks and Hispanics. Whites hang out on the 2nd and 4th floors and outside at the wall.&quot;<a href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a> Most students prefer to socialize within their own ethnic groups, and like many ethnically diverse colleges and universities in the U.S., Stuyvesant has developed into a &quot;<a href="Salad_bowl_(cultural_idea)" title="wikilink">salad bowl</a>&quot; — with different sections of the Stuyvesant building being implicitly reserved for members of particular ethnic groups. A series of <em>Spectator</em> editorials titled &quot;Race @ Stuy&quot; have also attempted to tackle the subject.</p>
<p>An Asian Students Association and a Black Students' League exist, although a 2000 request for a White Students' League was denied, with administration claiming the name connoted racism. <a href="#fn67" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="student-profile">Student profile</h3>
<p>As it is a public school, Stuyvesant students attend tuition-free. Although poor students abound, the dominant social group is upper-middle class, split largely between the White Manhattanites, the Brooklynite Jews, a few African Americans and Asians from <a href="Queens" class="uri" title="wikilink">Queens</a>.</p>
<p>Stuyvesant is like most high schools in that many pay attention to fashion; perennial favorites for girls include <a href="bell-bottoms" title="wikilink">flares</a>, either denim or nylon, while the boys' preferences are more fickle, ranging from <em><a href="JNCO" title="wikilink">JnCos</a></em> during the mid-1990s to smaller jeans and <em>North Face</em> jackets in the later 1990s. Beat up sneakers &lt;U+00E0&gt; la <em><a href="Moby" class="uri" title="wikilink">Moby</a></em> and brightly colored clothing are popular among Stuy's Manhattan &quot;raver&quot; contingent, while a few clad themselves in black gothic apparel. Fishnet stockings and thigh-high boots are not uncommon. Stuyvesant has no dress code, save the physical education department, which allows students to wear shorts and t-shirts of their choice.</p>
<h2 id="notable-people">Notable people</h2>

<p>Stuyvesant has produced a steady stream of professional mathematicians, including more leading figures in the field than are associated with most major universities.

<p>The Stuyvesant High School building in Battery Park City was one of the main settings of the film <em><a href="Hackers_(film)" title="wikilink">Hackers</a></em>, although it was not mentioned by name. As in the film, Stuyvesant has no pool on the roof, despite a long history of seniors selling &quot;rooftop pool passes&quot; to new freshmen. It does, however, have an Olympic-sized pool on the groud floor and a roof deck for its technology classes. In an episode of <em><a href="Law_&amp;_Order:_Criminal_Intent" title="wikilink">Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent</a></em>, a female Stuyvesant student is murdered.
