<p><strong>Michael Gordon &quot;Mike&quot; Oldfield</strong> (born 15 May 1953, <a href="Reading,_Berkshire" title="wikilink">Reading</a>, <a href="Berkshire" class="uri" title="wikilink">Berkshire</a>) is an <a href="England" title="wikilink">English</a> <a href="multi-instrumentalist" class="uri" title="wikilink">multi-instrumentalist</a> <a href="musician" class="uri" title="wikilink">musician</a> and <a href="composer" class="uri" title="wikilink">composer</a>, working a style that blends <a href="progressive_rock" title="wikilink">progressive rock</a>, <a href="folk_music" title="wikilink">folk</a>, ethnic or <a href="world_music" title="wikilink">world music</a>, <a href="European_classical_music" title="wikilink">classical music</a>, <a href="electronic_music" title="wikilink">electronic music</a>, <a href="New_Age_music" title="wikilink">New Age</a> and more recently <a href="dance_music" title="wikilink">dance</a>. His music is often elaborate and complex in nature. He is best known for his hit 1973 album <em><a href="Tubular_Bells" title="wikilink">Tubular Bells</a></em>, which broke new ground as an instrumental album and launched <a href="Virgin_Records" title="wikilink">Virgin Records</a>, and for his 1983 hit single &quot;<a href="Moonlight_Shadow" title="wikilink">Moonlight Shadow</a>&quot;. He is also well known for his hit rendition of the <a href="Christmas" class="uri" title="wikilink">Christmas</a> piece, &quot;<a href="In_Dulci_Jubilo_(Mike_Oldfield)" title="wikilink">In Dulci Jubilo</a>&quot;.</p>
<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<p>Oldfield's parents are Maureen and Raymond Oldfield, a nurse and <a href="general_practitioner" title="wikilink">general practitioner</a>, respectively. His sister <a href="Sally_Oldfield" title="wikilink">Sally</a> and brother <a href="Terry_Oldfield" title="wikilink">Terry</a> are successful musicians in their own right and have appeared on several of his albums. Mike Oldfield was born in the <a href="Battle_Hospital" title="wikilink">Battle Hospital</a>, <a href="Reading,_Berkshire" title="wikilink">Reading, Berkshire</a> and he attended <a href="St_Joseph&#39;s_Convent_School" title="wikilink">St Joseph's Convent School</a>, Highlands Junior School in <a href="Tilehurst" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tilehurst</a>, St Edward's <a href="Preparatory_School_(UK)" title="wikilink">Preparatory School</a> <a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> and <a href="Presentation_College,_Reading" title="wikilink">Presentation College</a> in Reading. When Oldfield was 13 he moved with his parents to <a href="Harold_Wood" title="wikilink">Harold Wood</a> where he attended <a href="Hornchurch" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hornchurch</a> Grammar School. He only stayed there long enough to take one <a href="General_Certificate_of_Education" title="wikilink">GCE</a> examination in English as he had already begun his music career.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="early-career">Early career</h3>
<p>Oldfield's career began fairly early in his life, playing <a href="acoustic_guitar" title="wikilink">acoustic guitar</a> in local <a href="folk_club" title="wikilink">folk clubs</a>. At this time, he already had two fifteen-minute instrumental pieces in which he would &quot;go through all sorts of moods&quot;, a precursor to his landmark 1970s compositions. In his early teens, Oldfield was involved in a 'beat group' playing <a href="The_Shadows" title="wikilink">The Shadows</a> style music (he has often cited <a href="Hank_Marvin" title="wikilink">Hank Marvin</a> as a major influence, and would later cover The Shadows' song &quot;<a href="Wonderful_Land" title="wikilink">Wonderful Land</a>&quot;). In 1967 he and his sister <a href="Sally_Oldfield" title="wikilink">Sally</a> formed the folk duo <a href="The_Sallyangie" title="wikilink">The Sallyangie</a> and were signed to <a href="Transatlantic_Records" title="wikilink">Transatlantic Records</a> after exposure in the local folk scene. An album, <em><a href="Children_of_the_Sun_(album)" title="wikilink">Children of the Sun</a></em> was issued in 1968. After Sallyangie disbanded, he formed another duo with his brother <a href="Terry_Oldfield" title="wikilink">Terry</a>, called <a href="Barefoot_(band)" title="wikilink">Barefoot</a>, which took him back to <a href="rock_music" title="wikilink">rock music</a>.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1970 he joined ex-<a href="Soft_Machine" title="wikilink">Soft Machine</a> vocalist <a href="Kevin_Ayers" title="wikilink">Kevin Ayers</a>' backing group The Whole World playing <a href="bass_guitar" title="wikilink">bass guitar</a>. The band also included <a href="Electronic_keyboard" title="wikilink">keyboardist</a> and <a href="composer" class="uri" title="wikilink">composer</a> <a href="David_Bedford" title="wikilink">David Bedford</a>, who quickly befriended Oldfield and encouraged him in his composition of an early version of <em>Tubular Bells</em>. Bedford would later arrange and conduct an orchestral version of that album. With Ayers, Oldfield recorded two albums, <em><a href="Whatevershebringswesing" class="uri" title="wikilink">Whatevershebringswesing</a></em> and <em><a href="Shooting_at_the_Moon_(album)" title="wikilink">Shooting at the Moon</a></em>. Both albums featured early versions of what would become his trademark sound.</p>
<p>Having recorded a demo version of <em>Tubular Bells</em>, Oldfield attempted to convince someone in the music industry to take the project on, but was told the project was unmarketable. However, in 1972 he met the young <a href="Richard_Branson" title="wikilink">Richard Branson</a> who was setting up his own record label, <a href="Virgin_Records" title="wikilink">Virgin Records</a>, and after playing the demo to engineers <a href="Tom_Newman_(musician)" title="wikilink">Tom Newman</a> and <a href="Simon_Heyworth" title="wikilink">Simon Heyworth</a>, he began recording the 1973 version of the album.</p>
<h3 id="u2013-1991-virgin-years">1973 &lt;U+2013&gt; 1991: Virgin years</h3>
<p><em><a href="Tubular_Bells" title="wikilink">Tubular Bells</a></em> became Oldfield's most famous work. The instrumental composition was recorded in 1972 and launched on 25 May 1973 as the inaugural album of <a href="Richard_Branson" title="wikilink">Richard Branson</a>'s <a href="Virgin_Records" title="wikilink">Virgin Records</a> label. The album was groundbreaking, as Oldfield played more than twenty different instruments in the <a href="Overdubbing" title="wikilink">multi-layered recording</a> made in Branson's <a href="The_Manor_Studio" title="wikilink">Manor studios</a>, and its style progressed continuously, covering many diverse musical genres. The album quickly reached the Top 10 of the <a href="UK_album_chart" title="wikilink">UK album chart</a> and has spent 279 weeks on the chart to date, a figure bettered by only ten other albums. Its 2,630,000 UK sales put it at No.34 on the list of the best selling albums in the UK. In the <a href="U.S." class="uri" title="wikilink">U.S.</a>, it received attention chiefly by appearing in the soundtrack to <em><a href="The_Exorcist_(film)" title="wikilink">The Exorcist</a></em>. The title track subsequently became a Top 10 hit single in the US as well and is today considered to be a forerunner of the New Age movement. In the autumn of 1974, the follow-up LP, <em><a href="Hergest_Ridge_(album)" title="wikilink">Hergest Ridge</a></em>, was No.1 in the UK for three weeks before being dethroned by <em>Tubular Bells</em>. Although <em>Hergest Ridge</em> was released over a year after <em>Tubular Bells</em>, it reached No.1 first. <em>Tubular Bells</em> spent 11 weeks (10 of them consecutive) at No.2 before its one week at the top. In 1979, <em>Tubular Bells</em> was used as the main musical score for <em><a href="The_Space_Movie" title="wikilink">The Space Movie</a></em>, a Virgin movie that celebrated the 10th anniversary of the <a href="Apollo_11" title="wikilink">Apollo 11</a> mission. The <em>Exorcist</em> track is the score used for the landing sequence of the Apollo flights.</p>
<p>Like <em>Tubular Bells</em>, <em>Hergest Ridge</em> is a two-movement instrumental piece, this time evoking scenes from Oldfield's <a href="Herefordshire" class="uri" title="wikilink">Herefordshire</a> country retreat. This was followed in 1975 with the pioneering <a href="world_music" title="wikilink">world music</a> piece <em><a href="Ommadawn" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ommadawn</a></em>, and 1978's <em><a href="Incantations_(album)" title="wikilink">Incantations</a></em> which introduced more diverse choral performances from <a href="Sally_Oldfield" title="wikilink">Sally Oldfield</a>, <a href="Maddy_Prior" title="wikilink">Maddy Prior</a> and the <a href="Queen&#39;s_College,_London" title="wikilink">Queen's College</a> Girls Choir. Oldfield's 1976 rendition of &quot;<a href="Portsmouth_(Mike_Oldfield_single)" title="wikilink">Portsmouth</a>&quot; remains his highest charting single on the <a href="UK_Singles_Chart" title="wikilink">UK Singles Chart</a>, reaching number three.</p>
<p>In 1976 Oldfield and <a href="Sally_Oldfield" title="wikilink">Sally Oldfield</a> joined his friend and band member <a href="Pekka_Pohjola" title="wikilink">Pekka Pohjola</a> to play on his album <em>Mathematician's Air Display</em> which was released in 1977. The album was recorded and edited at Oldfield's <a href="Througham_Slad_Manor" title="wikilink">Througham Slad Manor</a> in <a href="Gloucestershire" class="uri" title="wikilink">Gloucestershire</a> by Oldfield and Paul Lindsay.</p>
<p>Around the time of <em>Incantations</em>, Oldfield underwent a controversial self-assertiveness therapy course known as <a href="Exegesis_(group)" title="wikilink">Exegesis</a>.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> Possibly as a result, the formerly reclusive musician staged a major <a href="Tour_of_Europe_1979" title="wikilink">European tour</a> to promote the album, chronicled in his live album <em><a href="Exposed_(Mike_Oldfield_album)" title="wikilink">Exposed</a></em>, much of which was recorded at the <a href="National_Exhibition_Centre" title="wikilink">National Exhibition Centre</a> near Birmingham, the first-ever concert there.</p>
<p>In 1975, Oldfield received a <a href="Grammy_Awards_of_1975" title="wikilink">Grammy award</a> for <a href="Grammy_Award_for_Best_Instrumental_Composition" title="wikilink">Best Instrumental Composition</a> in &quot;Tubular Bells &lt;U+2013&gt; Theme from <em>The Exorcist</em>&quot;. In 1979, he recorded a version of the <a href="Blue_Peter_(Mike_Oldfield_single)" title="wikilink">signature tune</a> of the popular British Children's Television programme, <em><a href="Blue_Peter" title="wikilink">Blue Peter</a></em>, which was used by the show for 10 years.</p>
<p>The early 1980s saw Oldfield make a transition to &quot;mainstream&quot; popular music, beginning with the inclusion of shorter instrumental tracks and contemporary cover versions on <em><a href="Platinum_(Mike_Oldfield_album)" title="wikilink">Platinum</a></em> and <em><a href="QE2_(album)" title="wikilink">QE2</a></em> (the latter named after the <a href="RMS_Queen_Elizabeth_2" title="wikilink">cruise ship</a>). Soon afterwards he turned to songwriting, with a string of collaborations featuring various lead vocalists alongside his characteristic searing guitar solos. The best known of these is &quot;<a href="Moonlight_Shadow" title="wikilink">Moonlight Shadow</a>&quot;, his 1983 hit with <a href="Maggie_Reilly" title="wikilink">Maggie Reilly</a>. This song has been covered by various other artists, including <a href="Aselin_Debison" title="wikilink">Aselin Debison</a> (<a href="Canada" title="wikilink">Canadian</a> <a href="Folk_music" title="wikilink">folk</a> singer), German duo <a href="Groove_Coverage" title="wikilink">Groove Coverage</a> (<a href="electronic_music" title="wikilink">electronic</a>/<a href="techno_music" title="wikilink">techno</a>) and <a href="DJ_Mystic" title="wikilink">DJ Mystic</a> (<a href="electronic_music" title="wikilink">electronic</a>/<a href="techno_music" title="wikilink">techno</a>). In 2002 it was a number one hit in central Europe for the German dance act <a href="Groove_Coverage" title="wikilink">Groove Coverage</a>. The most successful Oldfield composition on the US pop charts during this period was actually a cover version &lt;U+2014&gt; <a href="Hall_&amp;_Oates" title="wikilink">Hall &amp; Oates</a>'s remake of Oldfield's &quot;<a href="Family_Man_(song)" title="wikilink">Family Man</a>&quot; for their 1982 album <a href="H2O_(Hall_&amp;_Oates_album)" title="wikilink"><em>H<sub>2</sub>O</em></a>. Released as the album's third single, it hit the Top 10 during the spring of 1983 and was a hugely popular <a href="MTV" class="uri" title="wikilink">MTV</a> music video.</p>
<p>Oldfield later turned to film and video, writing the <a href="The_Killing_Fields_(album)" title="wikilink">score</a> for <a href="Roland_Joff&lt;U+00E9&gt;" title="wikilink">Roland Joff&lt;U+00E9&gt;</a>'s acclaimed film <em><a href="The_Killing_Fields_(movie)" title="wikilink">The Killing Fields</a></em> and producing substantial video footage for his album <em><a href="Islands_(Mike_Oldfield_album)" title="wikilink">Islands</a></em>. <em>Islands</em> continued what Oldfield had been doing on the past couple of albums, with an instrumental piece on one side and rock/pop singles on the other. Of these, &quot;<a href="Islands_(Mike_Oldfield_song)" title="wikilink">Islands</a>&quot;, sung by <a href="Bonnie_Tyler" title="wikilink">Bonnie Tyler</a> and &quot;<a href="Magic_Touch" title="wikilink">Magic Touch</a>&quot;, with vocals by <a href="Max_Bacon" title="wikilink">Max Bacon</a> (US version) and Southside Jimmy, a vocalist from <a href="Glasgow" class="uri" title="wikilink">Glasgow</a> (under his real name - Jim Price),<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> (UK/rest of the World) were the major hits. In the USA, Virgin America promoted the song &quot;Magic Touch&quot; to a large extent, making it a success, reaching the top 10 on the <a href="Billboard_charts" title="wikilink">Billboard album rock charts</a>. During the 1980s Oldfield's then partner, Norwegian singer <a href="Anita_Hegerland" title="wikilink">Anita Hegerland</a>, appeared his album and contributed vocals to many songs including &quot;<a href="Pictures_in_the_Dark" title="wikilink">Pictures in the Dark</a>&quot;.</p>
<p><em><a href="Earth_Moving" title="wikilink">Earth Moving</a></em> was released in July 1989, and was a moderate success. The album was the first to feature rock/pop songs on both sides. Several were released as singles: &quot;Innocent&quot; and &quot;<a href="(One_Glance_Is)_Holy" title="wikilink">Holy</a>&quot; in Europe, and &quot;Hostage&quot; in the USA for album rock stations. This was, however, a time of much friction with his record label. <a href="Virgin_Records" title="wikilink">Virgin Records</a> reportedly insisted that any future instrumental album should be billed as <em>Tubular Bells 2</em>. Oldfield's rebellious response was <em><a href="Amarok_(album)" title="wikilink">Amarok</a></em>, an hour-long work featuring rapidly changing themes (supposedly devised to make cutting a single from the album impossible), unpredictable bursts of noise, and a very cleverly hidden <a href="Morse_code" title="wikilink">Morse code</a> insult directed at Richard Branson. Although regarded by many fans as his greatest work, it was not a commercial success. His parting shot from the Virgin label was <em><a href="Heaven&#39;s_Open" title="wikilink">Heaven's Open</a></em>, which continued the veiled attacks on Branson but was notable for being the first time Oldfield had contributed all the lead vocals himself, it was the only album that Oldfield released as Michael Oldfield, not Mike Oldfield.</p>
<h3 id="u2013-2003-warner-years">1992 &lt;U+2013&gt; 2003: Warner years</h3>
<p>The very first thing Oldfield did when arriving at this new label, <a href="Warner_Bros._Records" title="wikilink">Warner Bros. Records</a>, and as his final insult to his former label, was to write and release <em><a href="Tubular_Bells_II" title="wikilink">Tubular Bells II</a></em> (the sequel to the first record released by Virgin), which was premiered at a <a href="Tubular_Bells_II_Live" title="wikilink">live concert</a> at <a href="Edinburgh_Castle" title="wikilink">Edinburgh Castle</a>. He then continued to embrace new musical styles, with <em><a href="The_Songs_of_Distant_Earth_(album)" title="wikilink">The Songs of Distant Earth</a></em> (based on <a href="Arthur_C._Clarke" title="wikilink">Arthur C. Clarke</a>'s <a href="Songs_of_Distant_Earth" title="wikilink">novel of the same name</a>) exhibiting a softer &quot;<a href="New_Age_music" title="wikilink">New Age</a>&quot; sound. In 1994 he also had an <a href="asteroid" class="uri" title="wikilink">asteroid</a> named after him, <a href="5656_Oldfield" title="wikilink">5656 Oldfield</a>.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a><a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1995 Oldfield further continued to embrace new musical styles by producing a <a href="celtic_music" title="wikilink">Celtic</a> themed album, <em><a href="Voyager_(Mike_Oldfield_album)" title="wikilink">Voyager</a></em>. In 1992 Oldfield met <a href="Luar_na_Lubre" title="wikilink">Luar na Lubre</a>, a galician Celtic-folk band (from <a href="A_Coru&lt;U+00F1&gt;a" title="wikilink">A Coru&lt;U+00F1&gt;a</a>, <a href="Spain" class="uri" title="wikilink">Spain</a>). The bands popularity grew after Oldfield heard their song &quot;O son do ar&quot; (&quot;The sound of the air&quot;), which he covered on his <em>Voyager</em> album.</p>
<p>In 1998 he produced the third <em>Tubular Bells</em> album, <em><a href="Tubular_Bells_III" title="wikilink">Tubular Bells III</a></em> (also premiered at a <a href="Tubular_Bells_III_Live" title="wikilink">concert</a>, this time in <a href="Horse_Guards_Parade" title="wikilink">Horse Guards Parade</a>, <a href="London" class="uri" title="wikilink">London</a>), drawing from the <a href="dance_music" title="wikilink">dance music</a> scene at his then new home on the island of <a href="Ibiza" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ibiza</a>. This album was still inspired by themes from <em>Tubular Bells</em>, but differed in lacking a clear two part layout.</p>
<p>During 1999 Oldfield released two albums. The first, <em><a href="Guitars_(Mike_Oldfield_album)" title="wikilink">Guitars</a></em>, used guitars as the source for all the sounds on the album, including percussion. The second, <em><a href="The_Millennium_Bell" title="wikilink">The Millennium Bell</a></em>, consisted of pastiches of a number of styles of music that represented various historical stages over the past millennium. The work was <a href="The_Art_in_Heaven_Concert" title="wikilink">performed live</a> in <a href="Berlin" class="uri" title="wikilink">Berlin</a> for the city's millennium celebrations in 1999&lt;U+2013&gt;2000.</p>
<p>He added to his repertoire the <a href="MusicVR" class="uri" title="wikilink">MusicVR</a> project, combining his music with a <a href="virtual_reality" title="wikilink">virtual reality</a>-based computer game. His first work on this project is <em><a href="Tres_Lunas" title="wikilink">Tr3s Lunas</a></em> launched in 2002, a virtual game where the player can interact with a world full of new music. This project appeared as a double CD, one with the music, and the other with the <a href="MusicVR#Tres_Lunas" title="wikilink">game</a>.</p>
<p>In 2003 he released <em><a href="Tubular_Bells_2003" title="wikilink">Tubular Bells 2003</a></em>, a re-recording of the original <em>Tubular Bells</em>, on CD, and <a href="DVD-Audio" class="uri" title="wikilink">DVD-Audio</a>. This was done to &quot;fix&quot; many &quot;imperfections&quot; in the original due to the recording technologies of the early 1970s and limitations in time that he could spend in the recording studio. It celebrated the 30th anniversary of <em>Tubular Bells</em>, Oldfield's 50th birthday and his marriage to Fanny in the same year. The DVD-Audio version has the same content as the CD version in surround, and some demos of the original <a href="Tubular_Bells" title="wikilink">Tubular Bells</a>. At around the same time Virgin released an <a href="Super_Audio_CD" title="wikilink">SACD</a> version containing both the original stereo album and the 1975 <a href="quadraphonic" class="uri" title="wikilink">quadraphonic</a> mix by <a href="Phil_Newell" title="wikilink">Phil Newell</a>. In the 2003 version, the original voice of the '<a href="Master_of_Ceremonies" title="wikilink">Master of Ceremonies</a>' (<a href="Viv_Stanshall" title="wikilink">Viv Stanshall</a>) was replaced by the voice of <a href="John_Cleese" title="wikilink">John Cleese</a>, Stanshall having died in the interim.</p>

The games have since been made available free of charge on Oldfield's website. A double album, <em><a href="Light_+_Shade" title="wikilink">Light + Shade</a></em>, was released on <a href="Mercury_Records" title="wikilink">Mercury Records</a>, with whom Mike had recently signed a three album deal. The two discs contain music of contrasting moods, one relaxed (<em>Light</em>) and the other more edgy and moody (<em>Shade</em>). The album was released on 26 September 2005. <em>Light</em> includes a selection of tracks from the album in <a href="U-MYX" class="uri" title="wikilink">U-MYX</a> format, which allows listeners to create their own remixes.

In the 2000s, he married Fanny Oldfield (n&lt;U+00E9&gt;e Vandekerckhove, born 1977), whom he met during his time in Ibiza; they have two sons together (Jake and Eugene).<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
<p>Oldfield is a motorcycle fan, and has five bikes. These include a <a href="BMW_R1200GS" title="wikilink">BMW R1200GS</a>, a <a href="Suzuki_GSX-R750" title="wikilink">Suzuki GSX-R750</a>, a <a href="Suzuki_GSX-R1000" title="wikilink">Suzuki GSX-R1000</a> and a <a href="Yamaha_R1" title="wikilink">Yamaha R1</a>. He also says that some of his inspiration for composing comes from riding them.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> Throughout his life Oldfield has also had a passion for aircraft and building model aircraft.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> He is also a licensed pilot<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> and has flown fixed wing aircraft, the first of which was a <a href="Beechcraft_Musketeer" title="wikilink">Beechcraft Sierra</a> and helicopters including the <a href="Bell_47" title="wikilink">Agusta Bell 47G</a> which featured on the sleeve of his cover-version of the <a href="ABBA" class="uri" title="wikilink">ABBA</a> song <a href="Arrival_(song)" title="wikilink">&quot;Arrival&quot;</a> as a parody of their <a href="Arrival_(ABBA_album)" title="wikilink">album artwork</a>. He is also interested in cars and has owned a <a href="Ferrari" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ferrari</a> and a <a href="Bentley" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bentley</a> which was a gift from Richard Branson as an incentive for him to give his first live performance of <em>Tubular Bells</em>.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> He has endorsed the <a href="Mercedes-Benz_S-Class" title="wikilink">Mercedes-Benz S-Class</a> in the Mercedes UK magazine. Oldfield also considers himself to be a <a href="Trekkie" class="uri" title="wikilink">Trekkie</a> (fan of the popular science fiction television series <em><a href="Star_Trek" title="wikilink">Star Trek</a></em>).<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> He also noted in an interview in 2008 that he had two boats.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a></p>
<p>In November 2006, fellow musician <a href="Noel_Gallagher" title="wikilink">Noel Gallagher</a> won a <a href="Spain" title="wikilink">Spanish</a> court case against Oldfield. Gallagher had bought an <a href="Ibiza" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ibiza</a> villa for &lt;U+00A3&gt;2.5 million from Oldfield in 1999, but quickly discovered that part of the cliff-top property was falling into the sea. The resulting court case awarded Gallagher a six-figure sum in compensation. Suspicion abounds in the music industry that the law-suit was initiated because of embarrassment that Gallagher brought on himself by not having a proper survey done on the property before buying it. This included making an immediate and noisy complaint about someone's yacht tied up at the villa's jetty before it was pointed out that the yacht came with the villa and was, in fact, his.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a></p>
<p>In 2007 Oldfield caused a minor stir in the British press by criticizing Britain for being too controlling and over protective, specifically, concentrating on the smoking ban, which England and Wales introduced that year. Oldfield then moved from his <a href="Gloucestershire" class="uri" title="wikilink">Gloucestershire</a> home to <a href="Palma_de_Mallorca" title="wikilink">Palma de Mallorca</a>, <a href="Spain" class="uri" title="wikilink">Spain</a>.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a><a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> Oldfield has lived outside the UK in the past, including living in <a href="Los_Angeles" title="wikilink">Los Angeles</a> and <a href="Ibiza" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ibiza</a> in the 1990s and <a href="Switzerland" class="uri" title="wikilink">Switzerland</a> in the mid-1980s, for tax reasons. Oldfield also currently has a home in <a href="Monaco" class="uri" title="wikilink">Monaco</a>. In 2009 Oldfield decided to move to <a href="the_Bahamas" title="wikilink">the Bahamas</a>, and put his home in Mallorca up for sale; the asking price is around &lt;U+20AC&gt;3.5 million.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a><a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a></p>
