<p><strong>The Flat Hat Club</strong> (as it was known outside its membership) or <strong>F.H.C. Society</strong> was the first of the collegiate <a href="secret_societies" title="wikilink">secret societies</a> or fraternities founded in the present <a href="United_States_of_America" title="wikilink">United States</a>, at <a href="the_College_of_William_and_Mary" title="wikilink">the College of William and Mary</a> in <a href="Williamsburg,_Virginia" title="wikilink">Williamsburg, Virginia</a>, on <a href="November_11" title="wikilink">November 11</a>, <a href="1750" class="uri" title="wikilink">1750</a>.</p>

<p>The initials of the F.H.C. Society stand for a Latin phrase, likely &quot;Fraternitas, Humanitas, et Cognitio&quot; or &quot;Fraternitas Humanitas Cognitioque&quot; (two renderings of &quot;brotherhood, humaneness, and knowledge&quot;). As members of the first American collegiate fraternity in the modern sense, the &quot;brothers&quot; of the F.H.C. devised and employed a secret handshake, wore a silver membership medal, issued certificates of membership, and met regularly for discussion and fellowship. The Society became publicly known as the &quot;Flat Hat Club&quot; in probable allusion to the <a href="mortarboard_cap" title="wikilink">mortarboard caps</a> then commonly worn by all students at the College (now worn at graduation by students at most American universities).</p>
<p>William &amp; Mary alumnus and third U.S. President, <a href="Thomas_Jefferson" title="wikilink">Thomas Jefferson</a>, is perhaps the most famous member of the Flat Hat Club.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> Other notable members of the original Society included Col. James Innes, St. George Tucker, and George Wythe.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> Jefferson noted that &quot;When I was a student of Wm. &amp; Mary college of this state, there existed a society called the F.H.C. society, confined to the number of six students only, of which I was a member, but it had no useful object, nor do I know whether it now exists.&quot;<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>A second Latin-letter fraternity, the P.D.A. Society (publicly known as &quot;Please Don't Ask&quot;), was founded at William and Mary in March, 1773, in imitation of the F.H.C. Society. <a href="John_Heath_(politician)" title="wikilink">John Heath</a>, a student at William and Mary who in 1776 sought but was refused admission to the P.D.A., later established the first Greek-letter fraternity, the <a href="Phi_Beta_Kappa_Society" title="wikilink">Phi Beta Kappa Society</a>.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>The student members of the F.H.C. suspended the activities of the Society in 1781, probably as a result of the suspension of academic exercises at the university (which the College of William and Mary had become in 1779) as the contending armies of the <a href="American_Revolution" title="wikilink">American Revolution</a> approached Williamsburg during the Yorktown campaign. The name of the Society was revived in the twentieth century by application to a select group of twelve undergraduate men and several professors which had been founded in 1916 as the Spotswood Club (it thus differed markedly from the original Society, a fraternity of six undergraduate men with alumnus members &quot;in urbe&quot;). The Society again suspended its activities in 1943 as the number of men enrolled at the College steeply declined because of American involvement in World War II.</p>
<p>The modern F.H.C. Society was revived in May, 1972.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> It remains an all-male fraternity, with most of its activities comparatively secret within the university.</p>
<p><em><a href="The_Flat_Hat" title="wikilink">The Flat Hat</a></em>, the twice-weekly student newspaper of The College of William and Mary, took its name from the public nickname of the Society.</p>
