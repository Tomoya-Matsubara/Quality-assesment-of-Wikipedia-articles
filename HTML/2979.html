</figure>
<p>Prior to <a href="European" class="uri" title="wikilink">European</a> settlement the area had been inhabited by the <a href="Whadjuk" class="uri" title="wikilink">Whadjuk</a> <a href="Noongar" class="uri" title="wikilink">Noongar</a> people for 40,000 years, as evidenced by archaeological findings on the Upper Swan River.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> These <a href="Indigenous_Australian" title="wikilink">Aborigines</a> occupied the southwest corner of Western Australia, living as hunter-gatherers. The lakes on the coastal plain were particularly important to them, providing both spiritual and physical sustenance.</p>
<p><a href="Rottnest_Island" title="wikilink">Rottnest</a>, <a href="Carnac_Island" title="wikilink">Carnac</a> and <a href="Garden_Island_(Western_Australia)" title="wikilink">Garden</a> Islands were also important to the Noongar. About 5,000 years ago the sea levels were low enough that they could walk to the limestone outcrops.</p>
<p>The area where Perth now stands was called Boorloo by the Aboriginals living there at the time of their first contact with Europeans in <a href="1827" class="uri" title="wikilink">1827</a>. Boorloo formed part of Mooro, the tribal lands of the Yellagonga, one of several groups based around the Swan River and known collectively as the <a href="Whadjuk" class="uri" title="wikilink">Whadjuk</a>. The Whadjuk were part of a larger group of thirteen or more tribes which formed the south west socio-linguistic block known as the <a href="Noongar" class="uri" title="wikilink">Noongar</a> (<em>The People</em>), also sometimes called the <em><a href="Bibbulmun" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bibbulmun</a></em>.</p>
<h3 id="early-european-sightings">Early European sightings</h3>
<p>The first documented European sighting of the region was made by the <a href="Flemish_people" title="wikilink">Flemish</a> Captain <a href="Willem_de_Vlamingh" title="wikilink">Willem de Vlamingh</a> and his crew on <a href="January_10" title="wikilink">January 10</a> <a href="1697" class="uri" title="wikilink">1697</a>. Subsequent sightings between this date and 1829 were made by other Europeans, but as in the case of the sighting and observations made by Vlamingh, the area was considered to be inhospitable and unsuitable for the agriculture which would be needed to sustain a settlement.</p>

<p>Although the <a href="British_Army" title="wikilink">British Army</a> had established a base at <a href="Albany,_Western_Australia" title="wikilink">King George Sound</a> (later Albany) on the south coast of western Australia in 1826 in response to rumours that the area would be annexed by <a href="France" class="uri" title="wikilink">France</a>, Perth was the first full scale settlement by Europeans in the western third of the continent. The colony itself would be officially designated Western Australia in 1832, but was known informally for many years as the Swan River Colony after the area's major watercourse.</p>
<p>On <a href="4_June" title="wikilink">4 June</a> <a href="1829" class="uri" title="wikilink">1829</a>, newly arriving colonists had their first view of the mainland and Western Australia's Foundation Day has since been recognised by a public holiday on the first Monday in June each year. Captain <a href="James_Stirling_(Australian_governor)" title="wikilink">James Stirling</a>, aboard the <a href="Parmelia_(barque)" title="wikilink"><em>Parmelia</em></a>, said that Perth was &quot;as beautiful as anything of this kind I had ever witnessed.&quot; On 12 August that year, Mrs. Helen Dance, wife of the Captain of the second ship <em>Sulphur</em>, cut down a tree to mark the founding of the town.</p>
<p>The name <em>Perth</em> was chosen by <a href="James_Stirling_(Australian_governor)" title="wikilink">James Stirling</a> for the new town. Stirling, a Scot, acted in accordance with the wish of <a href="George_Murray_(Lieutenant-Governor)" title="wikilink">Sir George Murray</a>, <a href="Secretary_of_State_for_War_and_the_Colonies" title="wikilink">Secretary of State for War and the Colonies</a>, that the town be named after <a href="Perth,_Scotland" title="wikilink">Perth</a>, <a href="Scotland" class="uri" title="wikilink">Scotland</a>, which was Murray's birthplace and parliamentary seat in the <a href="British_House_of_Commons" title="wikilink">British House of Commons</a>.</p>
<p>Beginning in 1831, hostile encounters between European settlers and Aborigines of the local Noongar tribe &lt;U+2013&gt; both large-scale land users with conflicting land value systems &lt;U+2013&gt; increased considerably as the colony grew. This violent phase of the region's history culminated in a series of events in which the Europeans overcame the indigenous people, including the execution of Whadjuk tribal chief Midgegooroo, the murder of his son <a href="Yagan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Yagan</a> in 1833, and the one-sided <a href="Battle_of_Pinjarra" title="wikilink">Battle of Pinjarra</a> in 1834.</p>
<p>By 1843, when the tribal chief Yellagonga died, his tribe had begun to disintegrate after having been dispossessed of the land around the main settlement area of Perth. They retreated to the swamps and lakes north of the settlement area including Third Swamp, known to them as Boodjamooling. The oral history of the area as related by a Noongar elder, <a href="Fred_Collard" title="wikilink">Fred Collard</a>, likens Boodjamooling prior to white settlement to a supermarket for the aboriginal people, where there was a bountiful, self-sustaining, and varied supply of food.</p>
<p>Boodjamooling continued to be a main campsite for the remaining Noongar people in the Perth region, and was also used by travellers, itinerants, and homeless people. By the goldrush days of the 1890s they were joined by miners who were en-route to the goldfields.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1850, Western Australia was opened to <a href="convicts" class="uri" title="wikilink">convicts</a> at the request of farming and business people looking for cheap labour.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> Queen Victoria announced the city status of Perth in 1856.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>After a referendum in 1900, Western Australia joined the <a href="Federation_of_Australia" title="wikilink">Federation of Australia</a> in 1901. It was the last of the Australian colonies to agree to join the Federation, and did so only after the other colonies had offered several concessions, including the construction of a rail line to Perth (via <a href="Kalgoorlie,_Western_Australia" title="wikilink">Kalgoorlie</a>) from the eastern states.</p>
<p>In 1933, Western Australia voted in a referendum to leave the Australian union, with a majority of two to one in favor of independence. However, an election held shortly before the referendum had turned out the incumbent &quot;pro-independence&quot; government, replacing it with a government which did not support the independence movement.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> Respecting the result of the referendum, the new government nonetheless petitioned the United Kingdom for independence, where the request was simply ignored.</p>
<p>Perth has prospered by becoming a key service centre for the natural resource industries, being the closest city to huge reserves of <a href="gold" class="uri" title="wikilink">gold</a>, <a href="iron" title="wikilink">iron ore</a>, <a href="nickel" class="uri" title="wikilink">nickel</a>, <a href="alumina" class="uri" title="wikilink">alumina</a>, <a href="manganese" class="uri" title="wikilink">manganese</a>, <a href="diamond" title="wikilink">diamonds</a>, <a href="mineral_sands" title="wikilink">mineral sands</a>, <a href="coal" class="uri" title="wikilink">coal</a>, <a href="oil" class="uri" title="wikilink">oil</a>, and <a href="natural_gas" title="wikilink">natural gas</a>.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> Most of the world's major resource and engineering companies have offices in Perth. Partially as a result of this influx, Perth has become highly ethnically diverse, with over 27% of inhabitants having been born overseas (495,240 persons) and a further 414,000 having an overseas born parent (2001 census). 11% speak a language other than English at home. Perth also has a larger alternative sexuality community than would have been expected from a town of its traditional roots. Two thirds of the Perth population are of the Christian faith, with other major religions including Buddhism and Islam.The proportion of the population that has no religious affiliation has remained consistent since 1991.</p>

<p><img src="perth_wa.jpg" title="fig:Perth, Western Australia (Jan 2005)" alt="Perth, Western Australia (Jan 2005)" width="400" /> Traditionally, Perth and the Swan River have usually been viewed and photographed from <a href="Kings_Park,_Western_Australia" title="wikilink">Kings Park</a>, situated on Mount Eliza to the near south-west of the city centre or from the South Perth foreshore. The historical record of the view shows clear river banks close to the city and a low skyline through to the 1960s. Since then, the filling in of the northern side of Perth Water and crowding of the skyline have continued unabated. Perth's city skyline displays the economic prosperity the city currently enjoys. The tallest building in the city is <a href="Central_Park_(skyscraper)" title="wikilink">Central Park</a>, which is the sixth tallest building in Australia.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="central-business-district">Central Business District</h3>
<p>The <a href="central_business_district" title="wikilink">central business district</a> of Perth is bounded by the Swan River to the south and east, with Kings Park on the western end, while the railway lines form a northern border. <a href="St_Georges_Terrace,_Perth" title="wikilink">St Georges Terrace</a> is the prominent street of the area with more than two thirds of the 1.3 million m&lt;U+00B2&gt; of office space in the CBD.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> <a href="Hay_Street,_Perth" title="wikilink">Hay Street</a> and <a href="Murray_Street,_Perth" title="wikilink">Murray Street</a> have most of the retail and entertainment facilities.</p>

<p>Perth is set on the <a href="Swan_River_(Western_Australia)" title="wikilink">Swan River</a>, so named because of the native <a href="black_swans" title="wikilink">black swans</a>. Traditionally, this water body has been known by local inhabitants as <em>Derbal Yerrigan</em>.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> A Dutch expedition in 1697 captained by <a href="Willem_de_Vlamingh" title="wikilink">Willem de Vlamingh</a> led to Vlamingh naming the river after the <a href="Black_Swan" title="wikilink">black swans</a>.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> The city centre and most of the suburbs are located on the sandy and relatively flat <a href="Swan_Coastal_Plain" title="wikilink">Swan Coastal Plain</a>, which lies between the <a href="Darling_Scarp" title="wikilink">Darling Scarp</a> and the <a href="Indian_Ocean" title="wikilink">Indian Ocean</a>. The metropolitan area extends to <a href="Yanchep,_Western_Australia" title="wikilink">Yanchep</a> in the north, <a href="Mandurah" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mandurah</a> in the south, total distance of approximately 125 <a href="kilometre" title="wikilink">kilometres</a> (78 <a href="mile" title="wikilink">mi</a>) by road. From the Coast in the west to <a href="Mundaring" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mundaring</a> in the east, a total distance of approximately 50 kilometres (30 mi) by road. This means that the area of Perth is over 1.5 million acres.</p>
<p>The coastal suburbs take advantage of Perth's oceanside location and clean <a href="beaches" class="uri" title="wikilink">beaches</a>. To the east, the city is bordered by a low escarpment called the <a href="Darling_Scarp" title="wikilink">Darling Scarp</a>. Perth is on generally flat, rolling land - largely due to the high amount of sandy soils and deep bedrock. The Perth metropolitan area has two major river systems, the first is made up of the Swan and <a href="Canning_River_(Western_Australia)" title="wikilink">Canning Rivers</a>. The second is that of the <a href="Serpentine_River_(Western_Australia)" title="wikilink">Serpentine</a> and Murray Rivers, which discharge into the Peel Estuary at Mandurah.</p>
<h3 id="climate">Climate</h3>
<p>Perth summers are hot and dry, summer lasts from late December to late February, with February generally being the hottest month of the year. The hottest ever recorded temperature in Perth was 46.2 &lt;U+00B0&gt;<a href="Celsius" title="wikilink">C</a> (115 &lt;U+00B0&gt;<a href="Fahrenheit" title="wikilink">F</a>) on <a href="23_February" title="wikilink">23 February</a> <a href="1991" class="uri" title="wikilink">1991</a>. Winters are cool and moist, though winter rainfall has been declining in recent years. This is an example of a <a href="Mediterranean_climate" title="wikilink">Mediterranean climate</a>. The coldest temperature recorded was -0.7 &lt;U+00B0&gt;C (30.7 &lt;U+00B0&gt;F) on <a href="17_June" title="wikilink">17 June</a> <a href="2006" class="uri" title="wikilink">2006</a>, and the only temperature ever recorded below the <a href="freezing_point" title="wikilink">freezing point</a>. Even in mid-winter, maximum daytime temperatures only occasionally fall below 16 &lt;U+00B0&gt;C (60 &lt;U+00B0&gt;F). Though most rainfall occurs during winter, the wettest ever day was on <a href="9_February" title="wikilink">9 February</a> <a href="1992" class="uri" title="wikilink">1992</a> when 121 millimetres (4.75 <a href="inch" title="wikilink">in</a>) fell. On most summer afternoons a <a href="sea_breeze" title="wikilink">sea breeze</a>, also known as &quot;<a href="Fremantle_doctor" title="wikilink">The Fremantle Doctor</a>&quot;, blows from the south-west cooling the city. Snow does not fall in Perth, and whilst being recorded in the hills adjacent to the city, this hasn't occurred since 1956.</p>

<p>Perth's earliest European settlers were <a href="British_people" title="wikilink">British</a> and <a href="Irish_people" title="wikilink">Irish</a>, and Britain and Ireland remained the city's primary source countries for the first century of its existence. However, by the mid-twentieth century significant numbers of <a href="Italian_people" title="wikilink">Italians</a> and <a href="Greek_people" title="wikilink">Greeks</a> had settled. As <a href="Fremantle,_Western_Australia" title="wikilink">Fremantle</a> was the first landfall in Australia for many migrant ships coming from Europe in the 1950s and 1960s, Perth started to experience a diverse influx which included <a href="Dutch_people" title="wikilink">Dutch</a>, <a href="German_people" title="wikilink">Germans</a>, <a href="Croatian_people" title="wikilink">Croats</a> and <a href="Macedonian_people" title="wikilink">Macedonians</a> and many others. The names of many of these migrants are listed on the honour board outside the Maritime Museum.</p>
<p>More recently, large-scale immigration to Perth by air from Britain has continued, giving Perth the highest-proportion of British-born residents of any Australian city — according to the 2001 census, 23.5 per cent of residents in the Joondalup North statistical subdivision in the north of the city were born in Britain, closely followed by Rockingham in the south with 19.8 per cent. The proportion of British-born in the Perth metropolitan area as a whole in 2001 was 12.4 per cent, or 164,488 persons. This is significantly higher than the national proportion of 5.5 per cent.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<p>Whilst no other community approaches the demographic weight of those born in Britain, many migrants — 32,544 or 2.5 per cent in 2001 — are from <a href="New_Zealand" title="wikilink">New Zealand</a>, due to the fact that New Zealanders, unlike other foreign nationals, are eligible for 'special category' visas, which allow them to live and work in Australia with little restriction. For this reason, the New Zealand-born community in Perth is increasing proportionately faster than any other birthplace group.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<p>Perth also has substantial immigrant communities from Europe — <a href="Italians" class="uri" title="wikilink">Italians</a> are the third largest migrant group, numbering 20,611 or 1.6 per cent in 2001. <a href="Irish_people" title="wikilink">Irish</a> and <a href="Croats" class="uri" title="wikilink">Croats</a> are also well represented.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<p>In the last three decades, South East Asia has become an increasingly important source of migrants, with communities from <a href="Malaysia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Malaysia</a>, <a href="Vietnam" class="uri" title="wikilink">Vietnam</a>, <a href="Singapore" class="uri" title="wikilink">Singapore</a>, <a href="Hong_Kong" title="wikilink">Hong Kong</a>, <a href="Indonesia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Indonesia</a>, <a href="China" class="uri" title="wikilink">China</a>, <a href="Pakistan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Pakistan</a>, <a href="India" class="uri" title="wikilink">India</a> and <a href="Sri_Lanka" title="wikilink">Sri Lanka</a> all now well-established. The Indian community includes a substantial number of <a href="Parsi" title="wikilink">Parsees</a> who emigrated from <a href="Mumbai" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mumbai</a> — Perth being the closest Australian city to India.</p>
<p>Another more recent source has been <a href="Southern_Africa" title="wikilink">Southern Africa</a>, with many white <a href="South_Africa" title="wikilink">South Africans</a> and <a href="Zimbabwe" title="wikilink">Zimbabweans</a> settling in the city in the latter half of the 1990s. Perth nowadays also has the largest population of <a href="Anglo-Burmese" class="uri" title="wikilink">Anglo-Burmese</a> in the world, in addition to a substantial <a href="Anglo-Indian" class="uri" title="wikilink">Anglo-Indian</a> and <a href="Eurasian_(mixed_ancestry)" title="wikilink">Eurasian</a> community.</p>
<h3 id="metropolitan-regional-scheme">Metropolitan Regional Scheme</h3>

<p><img src="MASB.gif" title="fig:Area of the Perth Metropolitan Region Scheme" alt="Area of the Perth Metropolitan Region Scheme" width="180" /> The Metropolitan Region Scheme (MRS) is the legal land plan covering the Perth metropolitan region. It classifies land into broad zones and reservations. As the regions develop, so the schemes must be amended.</p>
<p>It is a large town planning scheme for land use in the Perth metropolitan area which defines the future use of land, dividing it into broad zones and reservations. It requires local government town planning schemes to provide detailed plans for their part of the region. These schemes must be consistent with the MRS.</p>
<p>Deriving from Prof. Gordon Stephenson's 1955 <em>Plan for the Metropolitan Region, Perth and Fremantle</em> (&quot;Corridor Plan&quot;), the MRS has been in operation since 1963 and provides the legal basis for planning in the Perth metropolitan region.</p>

<p>The <a href="Perth_Concert_Hall,_Western_Australia" title="wikilink">Perth Concert Hall</a> is the city's main concert venue and hosts theatre, ballet, opera and orchestral performances. Other theatres include the new (2005) Perth Convention Center, the historic His Majesty's, Burswood Dome (no longer available for musical events due to its poor design and complaints from locals about noise polution) hosts rock and popular music concerts. Outdoor concerts are held in Kings Park and Subiaco Oval and the New Convention Centre on the foreshore replaces the Burswood Dome until a more satisfactory building is established.</p>
<p>In 2005, the construction of the Convention Centre completed, and is now an integral feature of Perth city. Many exhibits and programs occur here, including last year's Human Body Exhibit; showing on display the human structures of Asian donors. It has been said that the Convention Centre was designed to appear to be a leaf and gum nut from a bird's eye view. However, there is still debate amongst residents as to whether or not it looks like it.</p>
<h3 id="sport">Sport</h3>

<p>The climate of Perth allows for extensive outdoor sport activity, and this is reflected in the wide variety of <a href="sport" title="wikilink">sports</a> available to citizens of the city.

<p>Perth is relatively isolated from other Australian cities so overseas artists often exclude it from their tour schedules. This isolation however has often be cited as the cause of Perth's original and alternative music. It is also for this reason that Perth is frequently called the &quot;new Seattle&quot;, as it was <a href="Seattle" class="uri" title="wikilink">Seattle</a>'s isolation from the rest of the USA that contributed to it spawning the ground breaking <a href="grunge" class="uri" title="wikilink">grunge</a> sound of the early 90's. The more popular <a href="rock_concert" title="wikilink">rock concerts</a> held in Perth are the <a href="Big_Day_Out" title="wikilink">Big Day Out</a> (nationwide) and <a href="Rock-It" class="uri" title="wikilink">Rock-It</a> (Perth only).

<p>Perth has a very changeable and, at times, energetic <a href="Folk_music" title="wikilink">Folk music</a> culture.

A favourite spot was the Hayloft in West Perth - home of WA Folk music in the 1970s and later moving to the Peninsula hotel in <a href="Maylands,_Western_Australia" title="wikilink">Maylands</a>. Perth is also home to a vibrant alternative sexuality music scene, focused especially around such nightclubs as &quot;the court&quot; and &quot;connections&quot;.</p>

<p>On 19 September 2006, the <a href="Federal_Court_of_Australia" title="wikilink">Federal Court of Australia</a> brought down a judgment recognising Noongar <a href="native_title" title="wikilink">native title</a> over the Perth metropolitan area, in the case of <em>Bennell v State of Western Australia</em> [2006] FCA 1243.</p>
<p>This is the first judgment giving a positive determination of native title over a capital city and its surrounds. Justice Wilcox found that native title continues to exist within an area in and around Perth; this is part of a larger area included in the Single Noongar Claim. It was determined separately by the Federal Court at the request of the Commonwealth and State Government in order to obtain certainty about whether Native Title exists in the Perth metropolitan area.</p>
<p>An appeal was subsequently lodged and is expected to be heard in April 2007. The remainder of the larger &lt;U+201C&gt;Single Noongar Claim&lt;U+201D&gt; remains outstanding; but it will hinge on the outcome of this appeal process.</p>
