The riot, between Chinese immigrant miners and white, mostly immigrant, miners, was the result of racial tensions and an ongoing labor dispute over the <a href="Union_Pacific_Coal_Department" title="wikilink">Union Pacific Coal Department</a>'s policy of paying Chinese miners lower wages than white miners. When the rioting ended, 28 Chinese miners were dead and 15 were wounded. Rioters burned 75 Chinese homes resulting in about $150,000 property damage.</p>
<p>Tension between <a href="Caucasian_race" title="wikilink">whites</a> and <a href="Chinese_immigration_to_the_United_States" title="wikilink">Chinese immigrants</a> in the late 19th century <a href="American_West" title="wikilink">American West</a> was particularly high, especially in the decade preceding the violence. The massacre in Rock Springs was the violent outburst of years of anti-&quot;<a href="coolie" class="uri" title="wikilink">coolie</a>&quot; sentiment in the <a href="United_States" title="wikilink">United States</a>. The 1882 <a href="Chinese_Exclusion_Act" title="wikilink">Chinese Exclusion Act</a> suspended Chinese immigration for ten years, but not before thousands of immigrants came to the American West. Most Chinese immigrants to <a href="Wyoming_Territory" title="wikilink">Wyoming Territory</a> took jobs with the railroad at first, but many ended up employed in coal mines owned by the <a href="Union_Pacific_Railroad" title="wikilink">Union Pacific Railroad</a>. As Chinese immigration increased, so did anti-Chinese sentiment from whites. The <a href="Knights_of_Labor" title="wikilink">Knights of Labor</a>, one of the foremost voices against Chinese immigrant labor, formed a chapter in Rock Springs in 1883, and most rioters were members of that organization. No connection was ever established between the riot and the national Knights of Labor organization.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>In the immediate aftermath of the riot, <a href="United_States_Army" title="wikilink">federal troops</a> were deployed in Rock Springs. The troops escorted the surviving Chinese miners, most of whom had fled to <a href="Evanston,_Wyoming" title="wikilink">Evanston, Wyoming</a>, back to Rock Springs a week after the riot. Reaction came swiftly from the era's publications. In Rock Springs, the local newspaper endorsed the outcome of the riot, while in other Wyoming newspapers, support for the riot was limited to sympathy for the causes of the white miners. The massacre in Rock Springs touched off a wave of anti-Chinese violence, especially in the <a href="Puget_Sound" title="wikilink">Puget Sound</a> area of <a href="Washington_Territory" title="wikilink">Washington Territory</a>. Rioting and mob actions broke out in <a href="Seattle" class="uri" title="wikilink">Seattle</a>, <a href="Tacoma" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tacoma</a>, and <a href="Issaquah,_Washington" title="wikilink">Issaquah, Washington</a>, in the months following the Rock Springs Massacre.</p>

J.R. Tucker, writing for <em><a href="The_North_American_Review" title="wikilink">The North American Review</a></em> in 1884, stated that the vast majority of the nearly 100,000 Chinese immigrants resided within the <a href="American_West" title="wikilink">American West</a>: <a href="California" class="uri" title="wikilink">California</a>, <a href="Nevada" class="uri" title="wikilink">Nevada</a>, <a href="Oregon" class="uri" title="wikilink">Oregon</a>, and <a href="Washington_Territory" title="wikilink">Washington Territory</a>.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> The U.S. Minister to <a href="China" class="uri" title="wikilink">China</a>, <a href="George_Seward" title="wikilink">George Seward</a>, had asserted similar numbers in <em><a href="Scribner&#39;s_Magazine" title="wikilink">Scribner's Magazine</a></em> five years earlier.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>The first jobs Chinese laborers took in Wyoming were on the railroad, working for the <a href="Union_Pacific_Railroad" title="wikilink">Union Pacific company</a> (UP) as <a href="right-of-way_(railroad)" title="wikilink">maintenance–of–the–way</a> workers.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> Chinese workers soon became an asset to Union Pacific and were found along UP lines and in UP coal mines from <a href="Laramie,_Wyoming" title="wikilink">Laramie</a> to Evanston. Most Chinese workers in Wyoming ended up working in <a href="Sweetwater_County" title="wikilink">Sweetwater County</a>, but a large number settled in <a href="Carbon_County,_Wyoming" title="wikilink">Carbon County</a> and <a href="Uinta_County" title="wikilink">Uinta County</a>. Most or all Chinese people in the area were men working in the mine.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a><a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> <a href="Racism" class="uri" title="wikilink">Racism</a> against Chinese immigrants was widespread and largely uncontroversial at the time. J.R. Tucker, in the aforementioned 1884 article, referred to Asian immigrants as &quot;...the Asiatic race, alien in blood, habits, and civilization.&quot; He also noted, &quot;Chinese are the chief element in this Asiatic population.&quot;</p>
<p>In 1874–1875, after labor unrest disrupted coal production, the Union Pacific Coal Department hired Chinese laborers to work in their coal mines throughout southern Wyoming. Even so, Chinese population rose slowly at first; however, where there were Chinese immigrants, they were generally concentrated in one area.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a><a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> At Red Desert, a remote section camp in Sweetwater county, there were 20 inhabitants, of whom 12 were Chinese. All 12 were laborers who worked under an American foreman. To the east of Red Desert was another remote section camp, Washakie. An American section foreman lived there amongst 23 others, including 13 Chinese laborers and an Irish crew foreman.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> In the various section camps along the main line of the Union Pacific Railroad, Chinese workers far outnumbered any other nationality.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> Though the 79 Chinese in Sweetwater county in 1870 represented only 4% of the total population, they were, again, concentrated. In Rock Springs and Green River, the largest towns along the UP line, there were no Chinese residents reported in 1870.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<p>Throughout the 1870s, the Chinese population in Sweetwater County and all of Wyoming steadily increased. During the decade, Wyoming's total population rose from 9,118 to 20,789.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> In the 1870 <a href="U.S._Census" title="wikilink">U.S. Census</a>, what the government today calls &quot;Asian and Pacific Islander&quot; represented only 143 members of the population of Wyoming. The increase during the decade 1870–1880 was the largest percentage increase in the Asian population of Wyoming of any decade since; the increase represented a 539% jump in the Asian population.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> By 1880, most Chinese residents in Sweetwater County lived in Rock Springs. At that time, Wyoming was home to 914 &quot;Asians;&quot; that number fell significantly in the years 1880–1890, to 465.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<p><img src="Chinese_camp_rock_springs.JPG" title="fig:A typical 19th century Chinese–American mining camp." alt="A typical 19th century Chinese–American mining camp." /> Although most Chinese workers in 1880 were employed in the <a href="coal_mine" title="wikilink">coal mines</a> around Wyoming and Sweetwater County, the Chinese in Rock Springs worked mostly in occupations outside of mining. In addition to Chinese laborers and miners, a professional gambler, a priest, a cook, and a barber resided in the city.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> In <a href="Green_River,_Wyoming" title="wikilink">Green River, Wyoming</a>, there was a Chinese doctor.

In <a href="Atlantic_City,_Wyoming" title="wikilink">Atlantic City, Wyoming</a>, <a href="Miner&#39;s_Delight,_Wyoming" title="wikilink">Miner's Delight, Wyoming</a>, and Red Canyon, Wyoming, Chinese gold miners were employed. However, the majority of the 193 Chinese residing in Sweetwater County by 1880 worked in the coal mines or on the railroad.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="causation">Causation</h2>
<p>The riot was the result of a combination of race prejudice and general resentment against Union Pacific.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> In 1882, the <a href="Chinese_Exclusion_Act" title="wikilink">Chinese Exclusion Act</a> required that &quot;…from and after the expiration of ninety days next after the passage of this act, and until the expiration of ten years next after the passage of this act, the coming of Chinese laborers to the United States be, and the same is hereby, suspended; and during such suspension it shall not be lawful for any Chinese laborer to come.&quot;<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> In the years preceding the Rock Springs Massacre, the importation of Chinese labor was seen as a &quot;system worse than slavery.&quot;<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> The white miners at Rock Springs felt that Chinese laborers, in accepting lower wages, drove wages down for the white miners, comprised of mostly <a href="Sweden" title="wikilink">Swedish</a>, <a href="Wales" title="wikilink">Welsh</a>, <a href="Ireland" title="wikilink">Irish</a> and <a href="Cornwall" title="wikilink">Cornish</a>.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a><a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a><a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a><a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a><a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a><a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a></p>
<p>According to a deposition taken by the <a href="Qing_Dynasty" title="wikilink">Chinese government</a> and signed by 559 Chinese from Rock Springs, the Chinese there knew of ill–will from the white miners. They had never taken any precautions, as no prior events led them to believe a race riot would be the end result.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> Underlying the outbreak of violence were racism and resentment of the policies of the Union Pacific Coal Department. Until 1875, the mines in Rock Springs were worked by whites; in that year, a strike occurred, and the strikers were replaced with Chinese <a href="strikebreaker" title="wikilink">strikebreakers</a> less than two weeks after the strike began.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> The company resumed <a href="mining" class="uri" title="wikilink">mining</a> with 50 white miners and 150 Chinese miners in its employ. As more Chinese arrived in Rock Springs, bitterness from the white miners increased.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> At the time of the massacre, there were about 150 white miners and 331 Chinese miners in Rock Springs.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a></p>
<p>In the two years before the massacre, a &quot;Whitemen's Town&quot; was established in Rock Springs.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> By 1883, the Knights of Labor organized a chapter in Rock Springs.

<p><img src="Editorial,_harpers_weekly_1885.jpg" title="fig:This 1885 editorial cartoon by Thomas Nast depicts the Rock Springs Riot." alt="This 1885 editorial cartoon by Thomas Nast depicts the Rock Springs Riot." /> At 7:00 a.m. on <a href="September_2" title="wikilink">September 2</a>, <a href="1885" class="uri" title="wikilink">1885</a>, ten white men, in ordinary garb and miner's uniforms, arrived at coal pit number six at the Rock Springs mine. They declared that the Chinese laborers had no right to work in a particularly desirable &quot;room&quot; in the mine; miners were paid by the ton, so it was important where in the mine one worked.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> A fight broke out, and two Chinese workers at pit number six were badly beaten. The white miners, most of whom were members of the <a href="Knights_of_Labor" title="wikilink">Knights of Labor</a>, then walked out of the mine.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a></p>
<p>After the work stoppage at pit number six, more white miners assembled near the town. They marched to Rock Springs by way of the railroad, carrying firearms.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> At about 10:00 a.m., the bell in the Knights of Labor meeting hall tolled, and the miners inside the building joined the group, which by this time had grown quite large.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> There were white miners who opted to go to saloons instead of joining the gathering mob, but by 2:00 p.m., the saloons and grocers were persuaded by a Union Pacific official to close.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a></p>
<p>With the saloons and grocers closed, the mob of 150 men, armed with <a href="Winchester_rifle" title="wikilink">Winchester rifles</a>, moved toward <a href="Chinatown" class="uri" title="wikilink">Chinatown</a> in Rock Springs.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a><a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> The mob moved in two groups and entered Chinatown by crossing separate bridges. The larger group entered by way of the railroad bridge and was divided into squads, a few of which remained standing on the opposite side of the bridge outside Chinatown. The smaller group entered by way of the town's plank bridge.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a></p>
<p>Squads from the larger group broke off and moved up the hill toward coal pit number three. One squad took up a position at the pit number three coal shed; another, at the <a href="pump_house" title="wikilink">pump house</a>. The first gunshots were fired by the squad at the pump house, according to Chinese miners' claims, followed by a volley from those at the coal shed. Lor Sun Kit, a Chinese laborer, was shot and fell to the ground, but the Chinese did not flee the scene.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a></p>
<p>As the group at coal pit number three rejoined the mob, the crowd pressed on toward Chinatown, some men firing their weapons as they went.<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> The smaller group of white miners at the plank bridge divided itself into squads and surrounded Chinatown. One squad stayed at the plank bridge to cut off any Chinese escape.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a> As the white miners moved into Chinatown, the Chinese became aware of the riot and that two Chinese, Leo Dye Bah and Yip Ah Marn, residents from the west and east sides of Chinatown, had already been killed. As the news of the murders spread, the Chinese fled in fear and confusion. They ran in every direction: up the hill behind coal pit number three; others, along the base of the hill at coal pit number four; others still, from the eastern end of town, fled across <a href="Bitter_Creek_(Wyoming)" title="wikilink">Bitter Creek</a> to the opposite hill; and more fled the western end of Chinatown across the base of the hill to the right of coal pit number five. The mob came from three directions by this time, from the east and west ends of town and from the wagon road.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a> The Chinese immigrants present at the Rock Springs Massacre presented their own grisly account of the <a href="m&lt;U+00EA&gt;l&lt;U+00E9&gt;e" class="uri" title="wikilink">m&lt;U+00EA&gt;l&lt;U+00E9&gt;e</a> to the Chinese <a href="consul" class="uri" title="wikilink">consul</a> in <a href="New_York_City" title="wikilink">New York</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Whenever the mob met a Chinese they stopped him and, pointing a weapon at him, asked him if he had any revolver, and then approaching him they searched his person, robbing him of his watch or any gold or silver that he might have about him, before letting him go. Some of the rioters would let a Chinese go after depriving him of all his gold and silver, while another Chinese would be beaten with the butt ends of the weapons before being let go. Some of the rioters, when they could not stop a Chinese, would shoot him dead on the spot, and then search and rob him. Some would overtake a Chinese, throw him down and search and rob him before they would let him go. Some of the rioters would not fire their weapons, but would only use the butt ends to beat the Chinese with. Some would not beat a Chinese, but rob him of whatever he had and let him go, yelling to him to go quickly. Some, who took no part either in beating or robbing the Chinese, stood by, shouting loudly and laughing and clapping their hands.&quot;<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a></p>

<p>The massacre was in full swing by a little past 3:30 p.m.<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a> The women in Rock Springs had gathered in a group at the plank bridge, where they stood and cheered the rampage on. Two women present even fired shots at the Chinese.<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a> As the riot wore on into the night, the Chinese miners scattered into the hills, lying in the grass to hide. Between four and nine p.m., rioters set fire to the camp houses belonging to the coal company. By nine p.m., all but one Chinese camp house was burned completely. In all, 79 Chinese homes were destroyed by fire.<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a> Damage to Chinese–owned property was estimated at around $147,000.<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a><a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a><a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a></p>

After the riot, the <a href="U.S._government" title="wikilink">U.S. government</a> hesitated to make amends to the Chinese for the massacre.<a href="#fn92" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref92"><sup>92</sup></a> In <a href="China" class="uri" title="wikilink">China</a>, the <a href="governor-general" title="wikilink">governor–general</a> of the <a href="Guangdong" class="uri" title="wikilink">Guangdong</a> region suggested that Americans in China might be the target of revenge for the action in Rock Springs.<a href="#fn93" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref93"><sup>93</sup></a> Indeed, the American envoy to China, <a href="Charles_Harvey_Denby" title="wikilink">Charles Harvey Denby</a>, and others in the diplomatic corps reported rising anti–American sentiment in <a href="Hong_Kong" title="wikilink">Hong Kong</a> and in <a href="Canton_(city)" title="wikilink">Canton</a>, <a href="Guangdong" class="uri" title="wikilink">Guangdong</a>, following the riot.<a href="#fn94" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref94"><sup>94</sup></a> The American diplomats warned their government that the backlash from the massacre could ruin U.S. trade with China; they also reported that <a href="British_Empire" title="wikilink">British</a> merchants and newspapers in China were encouraging the Chinese to &quot;stand up for their oppressed countrymen in America.&quot;<a href="#fn95" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref95"><sup>95</sup></a> Denby advised that <a href="U.S._Secretary_of_State" title="wikilink">U.S. Secretary of State</a> <a href="Thomas_F._Bayard" title="wikilink">Thomas Bayard</a> obtain compensation for the victims of the massacre.<a href="#fn96" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref96"><sup>96</sup></a></p>

In a letter to the minister of China's Washington legation dated <a href="February_18" title="wikilink">February 18</a>, <a href="1886" class="uri" title="wikilink">1886</a>, he expressed a personal view that the violence against Chinese immigrants was precipitated by their resistance to <a href="cultural_assimilation" title="wikilink">cultural assimilation</a>, and that racism against Chinese was typically found among other minorities rather than the majority of the populace:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Chinese immigrants... segregate themselves from the rest of the residents and citizens of the United States and... refuse to mingle with the mass of population... As a consequence, race prejudice has been more excited against them, notably among aliens of other nationalities...<a href="#fn98" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref98"><sup>98</sup></a></p>

<p>However, Denby's predictions caused him to seek a Congressional appropriation.

He blamed lax law enforcement, not those involved in the riots, for the attacks at Rock Springs. Powderly wrote that the U.S. Congress should stop &quot;winking at violations of this statute&quot; and reform the laws which barred Chinese immigration, which he believed could have prevented incidents such as &quot;the recent assault upon the Chinese at Rock Springs&quot;.<a href="#fn113" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref113"><sup>113</sup></a></p>

Many letters supported him, including one from UP President <a href="Charles_Francis_Adams,_Jr." title="wikilink">Charles Francis Adams, Jr.</a>, but there were many letters from political enemies which depicted him as &quot;so deeply involved in business that he could not properly attend to the duties of his position.&quot; In the end, letters from two Wyoming lawyers charged that Warren illegally used federal funds when he appointed business associates to political positions. They also charged that he used his position to further his business interests in Wyoming. Warren nearly resigned his office as early as March 1886 but rescinded his resignation before it reached Cleveland; regardless Cleveland suspended him as governor on <a href="November_5" title="wikilink">November 5</a>, <a href="1886" class="uri" title="wikilink">1886</a> and appointed George W.
