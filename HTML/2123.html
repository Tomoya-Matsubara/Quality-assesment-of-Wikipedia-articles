<p><strong>Rachel Chiesley</strong>, usually known as <strong>Lady Grange</strong> (1679–1745), was the wife of <a href="James_Erskine,_Lord_Grange" title="wikilink">James Erskine, Lord Grange</a>, a <a href="Scottish_people" title="wikilink">Scottish</a> lawyer with <a href="Jacobitism" title="wikilink">Jacobite</a> sympathies. After 25 years of marriage and nine children, the Granges separated acrimoniously. When Lady Grange produced letters that she claimed were evidence of his <a href="treason" title="wikilink">treasonable</a> plottings against the <a href="House_of_Hanover" title="wikilink">Hanoverian</a> government in London, her husband had her kidnapped in 1732. She was incarcerated in various remote locations on the western seaboard of Scotland, including the <a href="Monach_Isles" title="wikilink">Monach Isles</a>, <a href="Skye" class="uri" title="wikilink">Skye</a> and the distant islands of <a href="St_Kilda,_Scotland" title="wikilink">St Kilda</a>.</p>
<p>Lady Grange's father was convicted of murder and she is known to have had a violent temper; initially her absence seems to have caused little comment. News of her plight eventually reached her home town of <a href="Edinburgh" class="uri" title="wikilink">Edinburgh</a> however, and an unsuccessful rescue attempt was effected by her lawyer, Thomas Hope of Rankeillor. She died in captivity, after being in effect imprisoned for 13 years. Her life has been remembered in poetry, prose and a play.</p>

<p>Rachel Chiesley was one of ten children born to John Chiesley of <a href="Dalry,_Edinburgh" title="wikilink">Dalry</a> and Margaret Nicholson. The marriage was unhappy and Margaret took her husband to court for <a href="alimony" class="uri" title="wikilink">alimony</a>.

<h2 id="acrimony-and-separation">Acrimony and separation</h2>
<p>There was evidently an element of discord in the marriage that eventually became public knowledge. In late 1717 or early 1718, Erskine received warnings from a friend that he had enemies in the government. At about the same time one of the children's tutors recorded in his diary that Lady Grange was &quot;imperious with an unreasonable temper&quot;.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> Her outbursts were evidently also capable of frightening her younger daughters and after Lady Grange's kidnapping, no action was ever taken on her behalf by any of her children, the eldest of whom would have been in their early twenties when she was abducted. Macauley writes that &quot;[t]he calm acceptance by the family of their mother's disappearance would persuade many that it need not be a matter of concern to them either&quot;.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a>{{#tag:ref|Macauley also poignantly notes that &quot;no hue and cry was ever raised on behalf of Lady Grange by the daughter [Mary] she had called her angel&quot;.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a>|group=&quot;Note&quot;}} This restraint may have been influenced by the fact their mother had previously disinherited all of them when the youngest were still infants, an outcome described as &quot;unnatural&quot; by the <a href="Sobieski_Stuarts" title="wikilink">Sobieski Stuarts</a>,<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a><a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a>(two English brothers who claimed descent from Prince Charles Edward Stuart).{{#tag:ref|Although taken seriously by <a href="Lord_Lovat" title="wikilink">Lord Lovat</a>, the Sobieski Stuarts' claims were eventually exposed and the <em><a href="Collins_Encyclopaedia_of_Scotland" title="wikilink">Collins Encyclopaedia of Scotland</a></em> states that their publication on the history of clan <a href="tartan" title="wikilink">tartans</a>, <em>Vestiarium Scoticum</em> &quot;is as bogus as its author's descent&quot;.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a>|group=&quot;Note&quot;}}</p>
<p>As the Erskines' marriage trouble increased, Lady Grange's behaviour became increasingly unpredictable. In 1730, the factorship of the Preston estate was removed from her, further increasing her angst. Her discovery of an affair her husband was conducting with coffeehouse owner Fanny Lindsay can only have made matters worse. In April of that year, she threatened suicide and to run naked through the streets of Edinburgh. She may have kept a razor under her pillow and attempted to intimidate her husband by reminding him whose daughter she was. On 27 July, she signed a formal letter of separation from James Erskine but things did not improve.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> For example, she <a href="wikt:jeer" title="wikilink">barracked</a> her husband in the street and in church and he and one of their children were forced to hide from her in a tavern for two hours or more on one occasion. She intercepted one of his letters and took it to the authorities alleging it was evidence of treason. She is also said to have stood outside the house in Niddry's Wynd, waving the letter and shouting obscenities on at least two occasions. In January 1732 she booked a <a href="stagecoach" class="uri" title="wikilink">stagecoach</a> to London and James Erskine and his friends, afraid her presence there would cause them further trouble, decided it was time to take decisive action.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a></p>

After a bloody struggle, she was taken out of the city in a <a href="litter_(vehicle)" title="wikilink">sedan chair</a> and then on horseback to Wester Polmaise near <a href="Falkirk" class="uri" title="wikilink">Falkirk</a>, where she was held until 15 August on the ground floor of an uninhabited tower.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> She was by now over fifty years old. </p>
<p>From there she was taken west by Peter Fraser (a page of <a href="Simon_Fraser,_11th_Lord_Lovat" title="wikilink">Lord Lovat</a>) and his men through Perthshire. At <a href="Balquhidder" class="uri" title="wikilink">Balquhidder</a>, according to <a href="Clan_Gregor" title="wikilink">MacGregor</a> tradition, she was entertained in the great hall, provided with a meal of venison, and slept on a heather bed covered with deerskins.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> The existence of <a href="Fillan" title="wikilink">St Fillan's</a> Pool on the River Fillan near <a href="Tyndrum" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tyndrum</a> would have provided useful cover for her captors: it was regularly used as a cure for insanity, which would have helped to explain her presence to the curious.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> The details of the onward route from there are not clear but it is likely she was taken through <a href="Glen_Coe" title="wikilink">Glen Coe</a> to <a href="Loch_Ness" title="wikilink">Loch Ness</a> and then through Glen Garry to <a href="Loch_Hourn" title="wikilink">Loch Hourn</a> on the west coast.

She was in the company of men whose loyalty was to clan chieftains rather than the law, and few of them spoke any English at all. Their native <a href="Scottish_Gaelic" title="wikilink">Gaelic</a> would have been incomprehensible to her, although as her years of captivity wore on she slowly learned something of the language.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> She complained that young members of the local aristocracy visited her as she waited by the shores of Loch Hourn, but that &quot;they came with design to see me, but not to relieve me&quot;.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a></p>

She lived in isolation for two years, not even being told the name of the island where she was living, and it took her some time to find out who her landlord was. She was there until June 1734, when John and Norman MacLeod from North Uist arrived to move her on. They told her they were taking her to <a href="Orkney" class="uri" title="wikilink">Orkney</a>, but instead set sail for the Atlantic outliers of St Kilda.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a><a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a></p>

<p>One of the more poignant ruins on the island of <a href="Hirta" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hirta</a> in the St Kilda archipelago is the site of Lady Grange's House.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a> The &quot;house&quot; is in fact a large cleit or stone storage hut in the Village meadows that is said to resemble &quot;a giant Christmas pudding&quot;.<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> Some authorities believe it was rebuilt on the site of a larger <a href="black_house" title="wikilink">black house</a> where she lived during her incarceration,<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a> although in 1838 the grandson of a St Kildan who had assisted her quoted the dimensions as being &quot;20 feet by 10 feet&quot; (7 metres by 3 metres), which is roughly the size of the cleit.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a>{{#tag:ref|According to the <a href="National_Trust_for_Scotland" title="wikilink">National Trust for Scotland</a> the cleit is &quot;traditionally said to be the house where she was held prisoner, but this is unlikely to be true&quot;.<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a> Quine (2000) states that it is the &quot;possible site&quot; of the house where Lady Grange lived, but that the house itself was destroyed prior to 1876.<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a> Maclean (1977) refers to the structure as a &quot;two roomed cottage&quot;.<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a> Fleming (2005) notes the various suggestions on record about the site of the dwelling but concludes that &quot;there is no reason to believe there was any break in the islander's oral traditions in the period since the 1730s&quot;.<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a>|group=&quot;Note&quot;}} <img src="Village_Bay_St_Kilda10.jpg" title="fig:A cleit on Hirta" alt="A cleit on Hirta" /> Hirta is an order of magnitude more remote than the Monach Isles, lying  west-northwest of <a href="Benbecula" class="uri" title="wikilink">Benbecula</a> in the <a href="North_Atlantic_Ocean" title="wikilink">North Atlantic Ocean</a><a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a> and the predominant theme of life on St Kilda was isolation.

The source is Clerk (1845) and Macauley (2009) states that no letter referring to her life on Skye has ever been found, there is no record of any such sailing by a government vessel and that &quot;nor indeed does learning to spin sound quite like Lady Grange's style.&quot;<a href="#fn73" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref73"><sup>73</sup></a>|group=&quot;Note&quot;}} Local folklore suggests she may have been kept for 18 months in a cave either at <a href="Uig,_Skye" title="wikilink">Idrigill</a> on the <a href="Trotternish" class="uri" title="wikilink">Trotternish</a> peninsula<a href="#fn74" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref74"><sup>74</sup></a> or on the <a href="Duirinish,_Skye" title="wikilink">Duirinish</a> coast near the <a href="stack_(geology)" title="wikilink">stacks</a> known as a &quot;Macleod's Maidens&quot;.<a href="#fn75" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref75"><sup>75</sup></a> She was certainly later housed with Rory MacNeil at <a href="Trumpan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Trumpan</a> in Waternish. She died there on 12 May 1745, and MacNeil had her &quot;decently interred&quot; the following week in the local churchyard. For reasons unknown a second funeral was held at nearby Duirinish some time thereafter, where a large crowd gathered to watch the burial of a coffin filled with turf and stones.<a href="#fn76" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref76"><sup>76</sup></a></p>

<h2 id="motivations">Motivations</h2>
<p>Lady Grange's story is a remarkable one{{#tag:ref|Boswell (1785) wrote: &quot;The true story of this lady, which happened In this century, is as frightfully romantick as if it had been the fiction of a gloomy fancy.&quot;<a href="#fn81" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref81"><sup>81</sup></a>|group=&quot;Note&quot;}} and various issues have been raised by Macauley (2009) as requiring explanation. These include: what drove James Erskine to these extraordinary lengths?;<a href="#fn82" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref82"><sup>82</sup></a> why were so many individuals willing to participate in this illegal and dangerous kidnapping of his wife?;<a href="#fn83" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref83"><sup>83</sup></a> and how was she held for so long without rescue?<a href="#fn84" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref84"><sup>84</sup></a></p>
<p>The first and second of these issues are related. Erskine's brother had already been exiled for his support of the Jacobites. Simon Fraser, Lord Lovat, a key figure in Lady Grange's abduction was himself executed for his part in the <a href="Jacobite_Rising_of_1745" title="wikilink">Jacobite Rising of 1745</a>.<a href="#fn85" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref85"><sup>85</sup></a> No concrete evidence of Erskine's plotting against the crown or government has ever emerged, but any threat of such exposure, whether based in fact or fantasy would certainly have been taken very seriously by all concerned. It was thus relatively easy for Erskine to find accomplices amongst the Highland gentry. In addition to Simon Fraser and Alexander Macdonald of Sleat, the Sobieski Stuarts listed <a href="Norman_MacLeod_(The_Wicked_Man)" title="wikilink">Norman MacLeod of Dunvegan</a><a href="#fn86" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref86"><sup>86</sup></a>—who became known as &quot;The Wicked Man&quot;—<a href="#fn87" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref87"><sup>87</sup></a>as the senior accomplices.<a href="#fn88" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref88"><sup>88</sup></a> Erskine himself was a &quot;singular compound of good and bad qualities&quot;.<a href="#fn89" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref89"><sup>89</sup></a> In addition to his legal career he was elected to Parliament in 1734 and he survived the vicissitudes of the Jacobite rebellions unscathed.<a href="#fn90" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref90"><sup>90</sup></a> He was a philanderer and over-partial to <a href="claret" class="uri" title="wikilink">claret</a>, whilst at the same time deeply religious.<a href="#fn91" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref91"><sup>91</sup></a> This last quality would have been instrumental in any decision not to have his wife assassinated,<a href="#fn92" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref92"><sup>92</sup></a> and he did not marry his long-term partner Fanny Lindsay until after he had heard of the first Lady Grange's death.<a href="#fn93" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref93"><sup>93</sup></a> <img src="Blaeu_-_Atlas_of_Scotland_1654_-_&lt;U+00C6&gt;BUD&lt;U+00C6&gt;_INSUL&lt;U+00C6&gt;_-_The_Hebrides.jpg" title="fig:Johan Blaeu&#39;s 1654 map of &quot;&lt;U+00C6&gt;bud&lt;U+00E6&gt; Insul&lt;U+00E6&gt;&quot; &lt;U+2013&gt; The Hebrides &lt;U+2013&gt; was the best available of the area in the mid-18th century." alt="Johan Blaeu&#39;s 1654 map of &quot;&lt;U+00C6&gt;bud&lt;U+00E6&gt; Insul&lt;U+00E6&gt;&quot; &lt;U+2013&gt; The Hebrides &lt;U+2013&gt; was the best available of the area in the mid-18th century." /> The reason why no successful rescue was ever effected lies in the remoteness of the <a href="Hebrides" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hebrides</a> from the <a href="English-speaking_world" title="wikilink">anglophone</a> world in the early 18th century. No reliable naval charts of the area became available until 1776.{{#tag:ref|The failure of the British navy to capture <a href="Charles_Edward_Stuart" title="wikilink">Bonnie Prince Charlie</a> after the <a href="Battle_of_Culloden" title="wikilink">Battle of Culloden</a> in 1745 was a major factor in the creation of a new <a href="Nautical_chart" title="wikilink">rutter</a> by <a href="Murdoch_Mackenzie_(cartographer)" title="wikilink">Murdoch Mackenzie</a>, Hydrographer to the Admiralty, called <em>A Nautical Description</em> researched from 1748 to 1757 and published in 1776. <a href="Johan_Blaeu" title="wikilink">Johan Blaeu</a>'s 1654 map was the best chart of the area at the time, but even this was not available to the Hanoverian government and military at the time.<a href="#fn94" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref94"><sup>94</sup></a>|group=&quot;Note&quot;}} Without local assistance and knowledge, finding a captive in this wilderness would have required a significant expeditionary force. Nonetheless, the lack of action taken by Edinburgh society in general and her children in particular to retrieve one of their own is remarkable. The <a href="Church_of_Scotland" title="wikilink">Kirk</a> hierarchy, for example, made no attempt to contact her or convey news of her condition to the capital, yet they could easily have done so. Whatever the call of morality and natural justice may have suggested, John Chiesley's daughter evidently did not command a sympathetic audience in her home town.<a href="#fn95" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref95"><sup>95</sup></a></p>
<p>In her account of the affair, Margaret Macauley explores 18th-century attitudes to women in general as a significant factor<a href="#fn96" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref96"><sup>96</sup></a> and notes that although numerous documents from the hands of Lord Grange's friends and supporters are still extant, not a single contemporary female view of the affair has survived, save that of Lady Grange herself.<a href="#fn97" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref97"><sup>97</sup></a> <a href="Divorce" title="wikilink">Divorces</a> were complex and divorced mothers were rarely given custody of children.<a href="#fn98" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref98"><sup>98</sup></a>{{#tag:ref|The <a href="Scots_law" title="wikilink">Scottish legal system</a> of the day was &quot;fundamentally different&quot;<a href="#fn99" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref99"><sup>99</sup></a> from its <a href="English_law" title="wikilink">English equivalent</a> in these matters. For example, Lady Grange could have sued for divorce in Scotland as husbands and wives were treated alike in this matter, although in England at the time &quot;adultery by the husband was generally regarded as a regrettable but understandable foible&quot;.<a href="#fn100" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref100"><sup>100</sup></a>|group=&quot;Note&quot;}} Furthermore, Lord Grange's powerful friends in both the church and the legal profession might have made this a risky endeavour.<a href="#fn101" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref101"><sup>101</sup></a> Something of James Erskine's attitude to these matters may perhaps be gleaned from the fact that for his first speech in the <a href="House_of_Commons_of_Great_Britain" title="wikilink">House of Commons</a> he chose to oppose the repeal of various laws relating to <a href="witchcraft" class="uri" title="wikilink">witchcraft</a>. Even in his day this appeared unduly conservative and his perorations were met with laughter, which effectively ended his political career before it had begun.<a href="#fn102" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref102"><sup>102</sup></a> Writing in the mid-19th century the Sobieski Stuarts told the tale from the perspective of the descendants of the Highland aristocrats who had been responsible for Chiesley's kidnap and imprisonment. They emphasise Lady Grange's personal shortcomings, although to modern sensibilities these hardly seem good reasons for a judge and <a href="Member_of_Parliament" title="wikilink">Member of Parliament</a> and his wealthy friends to organise an illegal kidnapping and life sentence.<a href="#fn103" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref103"><sup>103</sup></a></p>
<p>As for Lady Grange herself, her vituperative outbursts and indulgence in alcohol were clearly important factors in her undoing.<a href="#fn104" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref104"><sup>104</sup></a> <a href="Alexander_Carlyle" title="wikilink">Alexander Carlyle</a> described her as &quot;stormy and outrageous&quot;, whilst noting that it was in her husband's interests to exaggerate the nature of her violent emotions.<a href="#fn105" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref105"><sup>105</sup></a> Macauley (2009) takes the view that the ultimate cause of her troubles was her reaction to her husband's infidelity. In an attempt to end his relationship with Mrs Lindsay, (who owned a coffee house in <a href="Haymarket,_Edinburgh" title="wikilink">Haymarket, Edinburgh</a>), Rachel threatened to expose him as a Jacobite sympathiser. Perhaps she did not understand the magnitude of this accusation and the danger it posed to her husband and his friends, or how ruthless their instincts of self-preservation were likely to be.<a href="#fn106" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref106"><sup>106</sup></a><a href="#fn107" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref107"><sup>107</sup></a></p>

For some mysterious reasons, which have never been discovered, she was seized and carried off in the dark, she knew not by whom, and by nightly journies was conveyed to the Highland shores, from whence she was transported by sea to the remote rock of St Kilda, where she remained, amongst its few wild inhabitants, a forlorn prisoner, but had a constant supply of provisions, and a woman to wait on her. No inquiry was made after her, till she at last found means to convey a letter to a confidential friend, by the daughter of a Catechist who concealed it in a clue of yarn.
