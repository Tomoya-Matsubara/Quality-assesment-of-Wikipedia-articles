<p><strong><em>Dark Magus</em></strong> is a live <a href="double_album" title="wikilink">double album</a> by American <a href="jazz" class="uri" title="wikilink">jazz</a> composer and trumpeter <a href="Miles_Davis" title="wikilink">Miles Davis</a>. It was recorded on March 30, 1974, at <a href="Carnegie_Hall" title="wikilink">Carnegie Hall</a> in <a href="New_York_City" title="wikilink">New York City</a>. Davis' group at the time included bassist <a href="Michael_Henderson" title="wikilink">Michael Henderson</a>, drummer <a href="Al_Foster" title="wikilink">Al Foster</a>, percussionist <a href="James_Mtume" title="wikilink">James Mtume</a>, saxophonist <a href="Dave_Liebman" title="wikilink">Dave Liebman</a>, and guitarists <a href="Pete_Cosey" title="wikilink">Pete Cosey</a> and <a href="Reggie_Lucas" title="wikilink">Reggie Lucas</a>. He also used the show to audition saxophonist <a href="Azar_Lawrence" title="wikilink">Azar Lawrence</a> and guitarist <a href="Dominique_Gaumont" title="wikilink">Dominique Gaumont</a>. <em>Dark Magus</em> was produced by <a href="Teo_Macero" title="wikilink">Teo Macero</a> and featured four two-part recordings titled after <a href="Swahili_language" title="wikilink">Swahili</a> names for the numbers one through four.</p>
<p><em>Dark Magus</em> was released after Davis' 1975 retirement, after which his label, <a href="Columbia_Records" title="wikilink">Columbia Records</a>, issued several albums of various outtakes. After releasing the live recordings <em><a href="Agharta_(album)" title="wikilink">Agharta</a></em> (1975) and <em><a href="Pangaea_(album)" title="wikilink">Pangaea</a></em> (1976), Columbia found they did not approve of the albums and released <em>Dark Magus</em> only in Japan. It was issued in 1977 by <a href="Sony_Music_Entertainment_Japan" title="wikilink">CBS-Sony</a>. The label's A&amp;R executive Tatsu Nosaki suggested the album's title, which referred to the <a href="Zoroastrianism" title="wikilink">Zoroastrian</a> religious figure <a href="Magus" class="uri" title="wikilink">Magus</a>.</p>
<p>Along with Davis' other albums during the 1970s, <em>Dark Magus</em> was received ambivalently by contemporary <a href="music_journalism" title="wikilink">music critics</a>, but it inspired <a href="noise_rock" title="wikilink">noise rock</a> acts during the late 1970s and the experimental <a href="funk" class="uri" title="wikilink">funk</a> artists of the 1980s. The album was not released in the United States until July 1997, when it was <a href="reissue" title="wikilink">reissued</a> by <a href="Sony_Records" title="wikilink">Sony Records</a> and <a href="Legacy_Records" title="wikilink">Legacy Records</a>. In retrospective reviews, critics praised its <a href="jazz-rock" class="uri" title="wikilink">jazz-rock</a> aesthetic and the group members' performances, and felt that parts of the music foreshadowed <a href="oldschool_jungle" title="wikilink">jungle music</a>. In 2001, <em><a href="Q_(magazine)" title="wikilink">Q</a></em> magazine named <em>Dark Magus</em> one of the 50 Heaviest Albums of All Time.</p>

<p>Davis was 47 years old when he was asked to play <a href="Carnegie_Hall" title="wikilink">Carnegie Hall</a> in 1974, which followed four years of relentless touring. He had played the venue numerous times before and recorded a live album there in 1961. By 1974, Davis had been dealing with depression, cocaine and sex addictions, and several health problems, including <a href="osteoarthritis" class="uri" title="wikilink">osteoarthritis</a>, <a href="bursitis" class="uri" title="wikilink">bursitis</a>, and <a href="sickle-cell_anemia" title="wikilink">sickle-cell anemia</a>. He had also lost respect with both critics and his contemporaries because of his musical explorations into more <a href="rock_music" title="wikilink">rock</a> and <a href="funk" class="uri" title="wikilink">funk</a>-oriented sounds.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> Influenced by <a href="Karlheinz_Stockhausen" title="wikilink">Karlheinz Stockhausen</a>, Davis wanted to avoid individual songs and instead record extended <a href="movement_(music)" title="wikilink">movements</a> that developed into a different composition.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> He played his trumpet sparsely and became less of the focal point for his band, whom he allowed more freedom to improvise and with whom he rarely rehearsed, so that the young musicians he enlisted would be tested to learn and play together onstage.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>

<p>The March 30 concert featured an ethnically and age-diverse audience that included young hippies and old, wealthy attendees. According to <em><a href="Magnet_(magazine)" title="wikilink">Magnet</a></em> magazine's Bryan Bierman, &quot;the hip, 'with it' kids [sat] side-by-side with middle-aged tuxedoed couples, expecting to hear '<a href="My_Funny_Valentine" title="wikilink">My Funny Valentine</a>.'&quot;<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> Although he lived 15 minutes away, Davis arrived at the venue more than an hour late. When the band walked out onstage, he followed with his back turned to the audience.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> He casually strolled onstage while the band was setting up and began to play, to which they responded by playing a dense rhythm in unison. Saxophonist <a href="Dave_Liebman" title="wikilink">Dave Liebman</a>, who wrote the <a href="liner_notes" title="wikilink">liner notes</a> for <em>Dark Magus</em>,<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> later said of how the show began: &quot;It <em>is</em> his whim .. That's the thing! ... Miles can do that and have three thousand musicians follow him. Right? So what I learned in that respect from Miles was to be able to watch him and be on his case&quot;.</p>
<p>Davis also used the show to audition two new members&lt;U+2014&gt;tenor saxophonist <a href="Azar_Lawrence" title="wikilink">Azar Lawrence</a> and guitarist <a href="Dominique_Gaumont" title="wikilink">Dominique Gaumont</a>. Lawrence was the most highly regarded young saxophonist at the time; Davis enlisted Gaumont in response to incumbent guitarist <a href="Reggie_Lucas" title="wikilink">Reggie Lucas</a>'s demand for a pay raise. Although it was unexpected, Liebman later characterized the move as typical of Davis:</p>

<h2 id="composition">Composition</h2>

<p><em>Dark Magus</em> features four two-part compositions that average a length of 25 minutes.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> The album's music was unrehearsed and eschewed melody for improvisations around funk rhythms and <a href="groove_(music)" title="wikilink">grooves</a>. According to <a href="Allmusic" class="uri" title="wikilink">Allmusic</a>'s Thom Jurek, rhythms, <a href="color_(music)" title="wikilink">colors</a>, and <a href="key_(music)" title="wikilink">keys</a> &quot;would <a href="shift_(music)" title="wikilink">shift</a> and change on a whim from Davis.&quot;<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> Davis eschewed his previous performances' keyboardists for a three-guitar line-up of Reggie Lucas, Dominique Gaumont, and Pete Cosey, who had a penchant for guitar wails and pedal effects.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> Davis often stopped the band with hand signals and created empty spaces, which were longer than traditional jazz <a href="break_(music)" title="wikilink">breaks</a> and encouraged the soloists to fill them with exaggerated <a href="cadenza" title="wikilink">cadenzas</a>.</p>
<p>Davis only soloed intermittently or played his Yamaha <a href="organ_(music)" title="wikilink">organ</a>.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> He played trumpet on &quot;Moja&quot; and both trumpet and organ on the other pieces. The second half of &quot;Moja&quot; is distinguished by a long ballad sequence introduced by Liebman and continued by Lucas and Davis. &quot;Moja&quot; also included a <a href="theme_(music)" title="wikilink">theme</a> from &quot;Nne&quot;. On &quot;Tatu&quot;, Gaumont followed Lucas's solo with a long passage characterized by fuzzy wah-wah effects, and Lawrence played briefly with Liebman in a duet before his own disjointed solo. &quot;Tatu&quot; ended with a rendition of &quot;Calypso Frelimo&quot;. During the first part of &quot;Nne&quot;, they played the Davis-penned composition &quot;Ife&quot;. Near the end of &quot;Nne&quot;, Davis played a short <a href="blues" class="uri" title="wikilink">blues</a>.</p>
<p>Music journalist <a href="Robert_Christgau" title="wikilink">Robert Christgau</a> described the aesthetic on <em>Dark Magus</em> as a culmination of Davis' previous albums and &quot;bifurcated, like <a href="jazz-rock" class="uri" title="wikilink">jazz-rock</a> again.&quot;<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> He argued that Davis left the two elements&lt;U+2014&gt;jazz and rock&lt;U+2014&gt;&quot;distinct and recognizable&quot;, whereas &quot;pure funk&quot; would have subsumed them both &quot;in a new conception, albeit one that&quot; favors rock. Christgau attributed the album's jazz input to Lawrence's &quot;<a href="John_Coltrane" title="wikilink">Coltranesque</a>&quot; saxophone, and the rock elements to guitarists Lucas and Gaumont, who &quot;<a href="Wah-wah_(music)" title="wikilink">wah</a>-riff[ed] the rhythm&quot;, and <a href="Pete_Cosey" title="wikilink">Pete Cosey</a>, who produced &quot;his own wah-wah-inflected noise into the <a href="arena_rock" title="wikilink">arena-rock</a> stratosphere.&quot; Music journalist <a href="Erik_Davis" title="wikilink">Erik Davis</a> compared Davis' trumpet sound to &quot;a mournful but pissed-off <a href="banshee" class="uri" title="wikilink">banshee</a>&quot;, and Cosey, Lucas, and Gaumont to &quot;somewhere between and beyond <a href="James_Brown" title="wikilink">James Brown</a> and <a href="Can_(band)" title="wikilink">Can</a>&quot;, amid &quot;quiet percussion <a href="passage_(music)" title="wikilink">passages</a> [that] emerge like moonlit clearings&quot;.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="release">Release</h2>
<p><em>Dark Magus</em> was released after Davis' retirement, upon which his label, <a href="Columbia_Records" title="wikilink">Columbia Records</a>, issued several albums of various outtakes. They released his live albums <em><a href="Agharta_(album)" title="wikilink">Agharta</a></em> (1975) and <em><a href="Pangaea_(album)" title="wikilink">Pangaea</a></em> (1976), but did ultimately did not approve of Davis' live recordings and chose to issue <em>Dark Magus</em> only in Japan.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> It was released in 1977 by <a href="Sony_Music_Entertainment_Japan" title="wikilink">CBS-Sony</a>, who used several <a href="Fade_(audio_engineering)" title="wikilink">engineering fades</a> in the album's production to shorten the original concert for the final release. The album's four tracks were titled after Swahili names for the numbers one through four.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> Its title was suggested by Tatsu Nosaki, an <a href="A&amp;R" class="uri" title="wikilink">A&amp;R</a> executive from <a href="Sony_Music_Entertainment_Japan" title="wikilink">CBS-Sony</a>, who were producing the album. According to Nosaki, &quot;<a href="Magus" class="uri" title="wikilink">Magus</a> ... is the founder of the ancient Persian religion, <a href="Zoroastrianism" class="uri" title="wikilink">Zoroastrianism</a>.&quot;</p>
<p>The album was not released in the United States until July 1997, when it was <a href="reissue" title="wikilink">reissued</a> by <a href="Sony_Records" title="wikilink">Sony Records</a> and <a href="Legacy_Records" title="wikilink">Legacy Records</a>. It was part of the labels' reissue of five two-disc live albums by Davis, including <em><a href="Black_Beauty:_Live_at_the_Fillmore_West" title="wikilink">Black Beauty: Live at the Fillmore West</a></em> (1970), <em><a href="Miles_Davis_at_Fillmore" title="wikilink">Miles Davis at Fillmore</a></em> (1970), <em><a href="Live-Evil_(Miles_Davis_album)" title="wikilink">Live-Evil</a></em> (1971), and <em><a href="In_Concert_(Miles_Davis_album)" title="wikilink">In Concert</a></em> (1973).

<h2 id="reception-and-legacy">Reception and legacy</h2>

<p>Along with Davis' other 1970s albums, <em>Dark Magus</em> was received ambivalently by <a href="music_journalism" title="wikilink">music critics</a> upon its release, but became an inspiration to late 1970s <a href="noise_rock" title="wikilink">noise rock</a> acts and the experimental funk artists of the 1980s.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> Its 1997 reissue was ranked by Robert Christgau as the 10th best album of the year in his list for <em><a href="The_Village_Voice" title="wikilink">The Village Voice</a></em>{{'}}s annual <a href="Pazz_&amp;_Jop" title="wikilink">Pazz &amp; Jop</a> critics' poll.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> In 2001, <em><a href="Q_magazine" title="wikilink">Q</a></em> magazine included it on their list of the 50 Heaviest Albums of All Time and called it &quot;a maelstrom of uncut improvisational fury ... arguably the furthest out Miles ever got&quot;.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> <a href="David_Keenan" title="wikilink">David Keenan</a> placed it in his all-time 105 best albums list for the <em><a href="Sunday_Herald" title="wikilink">Sunday Herald</a></em> and said that, by ornamenting his heavy grooves with tribal percussive instruments, wah-wah effects, and otherworldly trumpet bursts, Davis had instinctively fused the most advanced elements of contemporary <a href="African-American_music" title="wikilink">African-American music</a>.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> According to <em><a href="CODA_(magazine)" title="wikilink">CODA</a></em> magazine's Greg Masters, Davis created among the most darkest and radical auras, feelings, and moods in 20th century music on <em>Dark Magus</em>.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>
<p>In a retrospective review for <em><a href="JazzTimes" class="uri" title="wikilink">JazzTimes</a></em>, <a href="Tom_Terrell_(journalist)" title="wikilink">Tom Terrell</a> said that the album's kind of music would never be heard again and described it as &quot;tomorrow's sound yesterday ... a terrifyingly exhilarating aural asylum of wails, howls, clanks, chanks, telltale heartbeats, wah wah quacks, <a href="white_noise" title="wikilink">white noise</a> and loud silences.&quot;<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> <a href="Pitchfork_Media" title="wikilink">Pitchfork Media</a>'s Jason Josephes viewed it as a highly valued Davis album that invokes a sense of <a href="Cool_(aesthetic)" title="wikilink">coolness</a> in listeners: &quot;Just when you think the shit can't get much higher, Miles comes in and hits the <a href="Wah-wah_pedal" title="wikilink">wah-wah</a> down hard on the horn and the next thing you know, you're slappin' five to the man upstairs.&quot;<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> <a href="Erik_Davis" title="wikilink">Erik Davis</a>, writing in <em><a href="Spin_(magazine)" title="wikilink">Spin</a></em>, found its anguished, ferocious music extremely impressive, especially when played loud, and particularly praised the group improvisation on songs such as &quot;Wili&quot;, which he felt foreshadowed <a href="drum_&#39;n&#39;_bass" title="wikilink">drum 'n' bass</a>: &quot;Miles was invoking the primordial powers of the electronic urban jungle&quot;.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> <em><a href="Down_Beat" title="wikilink">Down Beat</a></em> credited the frantic burbles of congas on &quot;Moja&quot; and &quot;Tatu&quot; for predating <a href="oldschool_jungle" title="wikilink">oldschool jungle</a> by 20 years.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a></p>
<p>In <em><a href="The_Penguin_Guide_to_Jazz" title="wikilink">The Penguin Guide to Jazz</a></em> (1998), <a href="Richard_Cook_(journalist)" title="wikilink">Richard Cook</a> and <a href="Brian_Morton_(Scottish_writer)" title="wikilink">Brian Morton</a> wrote that each performance on the album comprises only &quot;shadings and sanations of sound, and as one gets to know these recordings better one becomes almost fixated on the tiniest inflexions.&quot; In <em><a href="The_Rolling_Stone_Album_Guide" title="wikilink">The Rolling Stone Album Guide</a></em> (2004), <a href="J._D._Considine" title="wikilink">J. D. Considine</a> viewed <em>Dark Magus</em> as an improvement over 1973's <em>In Concert</em>, because it expressed the band's surging rhythms better and offered a balance between their affinity for improvisation and their desire to rock. Jeff McCord of <em><a href="The_Austin_Chronicle" title="wikilink">The Austin Chronicle</a></em> found the performances impassioned, enduring, and highlighted by effectively competitive playing between each duo of saxophonists and guitarists.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> According to <a href="John_Szwed" title="wikilink">John Szwed</a>, it has moments when all three guitarists and two saxophonists are &quot;in dense and exalted <a href="free_improvisation" title="wikilink">free improvisation</a> together, and Pete Cosey's <a href="musical_tuning" title="wikilink">tunings</a>, effects, excess, and sheer inventiveness took the guitar to the point where <a href="Hendrix" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hendrix</a>, <a href="free_jazz" title="wikilink">free jazz</a>, and <a href="rhythm_and_blues" title="wikilink">rhythm and blues</a> proudly merged together.&quot; By contrast, Don Heckman of the <em><a href="Los_Angeles_Times" title="wikilink">Los Angeles Times</a></em> was not fond of the band's repetitive funk rhythms, Davis' limited, unexceptional playing, the presence of <a href="tabla" title="wikilink">tablas</a>, <a href="electric_sitar" title="wikilink">electric sitar</a>, and multiple guitars, and the music's similarity to Hendrix, <a href="Sly_Stone" title="wikilink">Sly Stone</a>, and James Brown.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> Allmusic's Thom Jurek called it an exaggerated and excessive showcase of Davis' disoriented psyche and felt that, although the rhythm section is historically captivating, the other musicians' playing is inconsistent, albeit enthralling.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a></p>
