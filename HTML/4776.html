<p>Actress and dancer Zo&lt;U+00EB&gt; Lister was cast in the role of Zoe.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> On 8 June 2009, media entertainment website <a href="Digital_Spy" title="wikilink">Digital Spy</a> revealed that Lister had quit the soap and would leave towards the end of the year.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> Speaking of her decision to quit, Lister stated: &quot;It's scary but also very, very exciting. I think three years in a soap is enough to do and you get to a point where you either make a decision that this is what you do or you want to try something different.&quot;<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> She also revealed that she had been planning to leave the series one year prior to announcement.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> Lister's decision to quit matched that of co-star <a href="Loui_Batley" title="wikilink">Loui Batley</a> (<a href="Sarah_Barnes" title="wikilink">Sarah Barnes</a>).<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> <em>Hollyoaks</em> officially announced on 23 July 2009 that both Lister and Batley would leave towards the end of the year in a storyline that would see &quot;A tragic curtain call for one of them&quot;,<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> later revealing that either Sarah or Zoe would be killed off in a dramatic storyline.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> Lister also revealed in an interview with <em><a href="Heat_(magazine)" title="wikilink">Heat</a></em> magazine that she was &quot;nervous&quot;, but &quot;very excited&quot; about leaving the show.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p>Almost a year after filming her final scenes, Lister explained that she felt her exit was the right choice, saying: &quot;It felt it was time to go so I just ran with my instincts. Looking back, I was nervous but now I know I've done the right thing. I love theatre work. It gives me such a buzz. [<em>Hollyoaks</em>] was the break I'd been praying for. I threw myself into the part and enjoyed every minute of it. I had three superb years and it was brilliant.&quot;<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="characterisation">Characterisation</h3>
<p>Zoe is a former student at <a href="Hollyoaks_Community_College" title="wikilink">Hollyoaks Community College</a>, where she studied <a href="Film_theory" title="wikilink">Film Studies</a>. Channel 4 publicity describe Zoe as &quot;the bubbly student&quot; and make note of her many bad choices in life and failed relationships.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> Discussing these failed relationships, Lister commented during an interview in June 2009 that she believed her character was having a break from men in order to sort out her problems: &quot;I think she's been in and out of so many relationships and her life is at a bit of a juncture; she probably needs to sort her head out, sort her career, knuckle down really and not get bogged down into a relationship because everything takes a backseat when you're in one.&quot;<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<p>Zoe is also portrayed as having a <a href="tomboy" class="uri" title="wikilink">tomboy</a> persona.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> Lister was asked about this &quot;tomboy&quot; personality during an interview with <a href="Maxim_(magazine)" title="wikilink">Maxim</a> magazine, agreeing with the label and stating her character doesn't &quot;glam up&quot; as much as the other <em>Hollyoaks</em> characters.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> Maxim also noted the character was &quot;pretty popular with the boys&quot;.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> Lister has also commented that her character is not a stereotypical dizzy blonde, reiterated her character's tomboy status and added that she is a &quot;very street-smart type of woman.&quot;<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="early-storylines">Early storylines</h3>
<p>One of Zoe's first and main storylines was being stalked by fellow student <a href="Will_Hackett" title="wikilink">Will Hackett</a> (Oliver Farnworth). Lister later commented on the storyline, deciding it was her most memorable: &quot;The most memorable for me was the one with my weird boyfriend Will who stalked me. Like I said, it was a bit weird, but I quite liked it as a storyline.&quot;<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> During a fire safety promotion undertaken with co-star Lena Kaur (who plays <a href="Leila_Roy" title="wikilink">Leila Roy</a>), Lister referenced the storyline, commenting: &quot;It's much easier to test your smoke alarm once a week and plan your escape from fire than it is to escape from a psycho!&quot;.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
<p>In early 2008 during an interview with the <em><a href="Daily_Mail" title="wikilink">Daily Mail</a></em>, Lister expressed her feelings on the subject of lesbian storylines, stating: &quot;I'd definitely do a lesbian love scene in <em>Hollyoaks</em>. That would be a really good story.&quot;<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a><a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> It was later confirmed by Channel 4 that Lister's character would be involved in a sexual relationship with Sarah during the new late night series <em><a href="Hollyoaks_Later" title="wikilink">Hollyoaks Later</a></em>. After the screening of the scenes, Lister explained: &quot;It was quite nerve-wracking actually as I'm good friends with Loui &lt;U+2014&gt; it's quite a strange thing to smooch a really good friend so we had to get over the giggles and think 'right, just do it!'&quot;<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> Also commenting on her worries about the scenes, she said: &quot;I thought it was hilarious! I thought it'd be interesting, though. I was obviously quite worried about them. Loui [Batley] and I chatted a lot when we found out that it was going to be in the late-night eps and we were wondering 'oh no, what does this mean?!' But in the end, they weren't graphic or anything like that, so it was fine.&quot;<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> She continued: &quot;It was completely mental filming them. Loui and I just had a massive attack of the giggles. I think the crew were more embarrassed than we were! We were kind of ignored for the day.&quot;<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a></p>
<p>Speaking to entertainment news website <a href="Digital_Spy" title="wikilink">Digital Spy</a> about Sarah and Zoe's relationship, Lister explained: &quot;I don't think they do have feelings for each other in that way. Last year happened and Zoe put it down to history and experience &lt;U+2014&gt; one of those things that teenagers get up to occasionally and she was quite happy to leave it there. They've got through a lot and their relationship is really quite special. There's a lot of love there but Zoe's not got anything sexual for Sarah &lt;U+2014&gt; it's purely a deep friendship.&quot;<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> Meanwhile, Batley said: &quot;I think that for Sarah, Zoe's the best friend she's ever had &lt;U+2014&gt; a lot of people in her life have let her down but Zoe's her rock. Even though they've had their fall-outs, she's always been there for her and she loves her as a friend. I think Zoe feels the same. But for Sarah it's something more &lt;U+2014&gt; she completely relies on her and that turns into love for her as well.&quot;<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="imprisonment-and-exit">Imprisonment and exit</h3>

<p>After the announcement of Lister's departure, it was that revealed <a href="Loui_Batley" title="wikilink">Loui Batley</a>, who played <a href="Sarah_Barnes" title="wikilink">Sarah Barnes</a>, would also leave the show in a tragic <a href="skydiving" class="uri" title="wikilink">skydiving</a> death, caused by a jealous <a href="Lydia_Hart" title="wikilink">Lydia Hart</a> (Lydia Kelly).<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> Before the skydiving plot aired, Lister explained the storyline during an interview with Sky TV, stating that at the time Lydia severed a parachute to end her own life, later deciding to cut Zoe's parachute so she could have Sarah to herself, further explaining that viewers were not permitted to know who would have parachute after they became mixed up in the storyline's dramatic twist.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> Speaking on how Zoe's relationship with Sarah causes Lydia to commit her actions, Lister stated:</p>

<p>Lister explained that she and her fellow cast members filmed on many locations, including army barracks.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> They filmed at <a href="Tatenhill_Airfield" title="wikilink">Tatenhill Airfield</a>, where staff had been told to remain secretive about the storyline.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> She also revealed that she was the only cast member out of her, Batley and Kelly who performed the aired skydiving for real.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> A <em>Hollyoaks</em> producer released two pictures of funeral wreaths, one reading 'Zoe' and the other 'Sarah', in order to confuse viewers further as to whom the victim would be.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> On-screen after the skydive and Sarah's subsequent death, Lydia framed Zoe for the murder she committed, leading to her arrest.</p>
<p>Speaking of Sarah's death and Zoe's false imprisonment, Lister stated: &quot;She's in a very difficult place. She's lost her best friend and there's so much history there and she's finished her degree &lt;U+2014&gt; well she didn't even finish her degree, she failed that &lt;U+2014&gt; so she's in a limbo land anyway. She's working silly jobs and she's not in a very good place at all in any aspect of her life. Oh, and she's in prison on suspicion of murder...&quot;<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> When asked during another interview with Digital Spy about how the character is coping with being in prison, Lister stated: &quot;Not very well! It's all completely overwhelming for her. She can't get her head around the fact that her best friend's dead and the fact that she's being accused of murdering her is ridiculous. She's worried that because it's got this far its ludicrous, so who's to say that she won't be sent down?&quot;<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a></p>
<p>When the character was ultimately found not guilty and was released, Lister stated in an interview with <a href="E4_(channel)" title="wikilink">E4</a>: &quot;I think this is a great storyline, I've really enjoyed doing it. When Zoe's obviously released, it's like a whole new scenario for her because there are people who haven't really trusted her or believed in her. People that have really let her down, and plus the fact she hasn't got over Sarah [...] being killed yet either. She hasn't had the chance to deal with that, so that's really interesting, and she still wants Lydia to go down!&quot;<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> The character of Zoe then set out to expose Lydia as Sarah's killer. She befriended her, and even seduced her in order to gain a confession. During an interview about Zoe's new scheme, Lister said:</p>

</figure>
<p>Lister continued, &quot;It all gets really messy from here! Because Lydia's really deranged, Lydia starts thinking that because she loved Sarah and Sarah loved Zoe, if she gets with Zoe, that'll be the final piece in the puzzle and it'll all work out.&quot;<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> She explained: &quot;Lydia starts becoming obsessed with Zoe and to keep control, Zoe has to go with it. There's a point where Lydia kisses her! And then Mike walks in and kicks Zoe out.&quot;<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a></p>
<p>Lydia discovered Zoe's true intentions for befriending her, and set out to take revenge. In a second interview with E4, Lister stated: &quot;I was really surprised when I learned about Zoe's 'master plan' to get Lydia to confess because I think after everything that Zoe's been through [...] the last thing she wants to do is ever see Lydia again, let alone try and make friends with her! But that is her only way, so I think it's really interesting.&quot; She continued: &quot;The fight and the chase stuff with Lydia in the graveyard was really good, we filmed it at night. I was dressed as <a href="Madonna_(entertainer)" title="wikilink">Madonna</a>. We were in a cemetery, it was brilliant!...&quot;<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a></p>
<p>The culmination of the plot saw Lydia stab Zoe.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> The storyline was described as a &quot;brutal attack&quot; and at the time producers refused to reveal if Zoe would survive.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> Describing the terror Lydia causes for Zoe, a spokesperson for the serial stated: &quot;Zoe can&lt;U+2019&gt;t believe it when Lydia admits the parachute was meant for her. As soon as she realises Lydia wanted her dead she tries to run. That&lt;U+2019&gt;s when Lydia pulls out a knife and stabs her.&quot;<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> This led to a fight between Lydia and Charlotte who arrives with <a href="Dave_Colburn" title="wikilink">Dave Colburn</a> (Elliot James Langridge). They both fight to grab the knife while an unconscious Zoe bleeds, ultimately leading to the arrest of Lydia when the police arrive. She is later charged with the murder of Sarah and the attempted murder of Zoe.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> Several weeks after the character was stabbed, she was seen feeling as if no one wanted to be in her company. After three of her longtime friends snubbed her ideas to make a fresh start elsewhere, ultimately she was she went travelling with her former boyfriend <a href="Mike_Barnes_(Hollyoaks)" title="wikilink">Mike Barnes</a> (<a href="Tony_Hirst" title="wikilink">Tony Hirst</a>) and <a href="Gilly_Roach" title="wikilink">Gilly Roach</a> (<a href="Anthony_Quinlan" title="wikilink">Anthony Quinlan</a>).<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a></p>
