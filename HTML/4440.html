<p><strong>Typhoon Nelson</strong> was the worst <a href="tropical_cyclone" title="wikilink">tropical cyclone</a> to affect <a href="Southern_China" title="wikilink">Southern China</a> in 16 years. Typhoon Nelson, which developed on August 16, originated from an area of thunderstorm activity well east of the <a href="Philippines" class="uri" title="wikilink">Philippines</a>. It gradually intensified over the next several days while moving northwest. Nelson reached typhoon intensity early on August 20 and two days later, attained peak intensity before turning west. The cyclone brushed northern <a href="Taiwan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Taiwan</a> early on August 23 after weakening slightly. Nelson then briefly restrengthened to peak intensity. During the afternoon of August 23, it made <a href="landfall_(meteorology)" title="wikilink">landfall</a> in eastern <a href="China" class="uri" title="wikilink">China</a> before dissipating on August 25.</p>
<p>Nelson brought heavy rains to Taiwan. Approximately 900,000 families were left without power and 100,000 telephone lines lost service. More than 20,000 trees were uprooted. Across the country, five people were killed. Affecting a country already inundated by summer rains, Typhoon Nelson brought additional flooding and significant damage to much of Southern China. There, the storm killed 48 individuals and hurt 329 others. More than 5,000 homes were destroyed while another 6,000 were damaged. Around 2,000 travelers were stranded due to flooding. Throughout China, losses from the storm totaled to $53 million (1985 <a href="United_States_Dollar" title="wikilink">USD</a>).</p>
<h2 id="meteorological-history">Meteorological history</h2>

<p>The origins of Nelson can be traced back to a small and disorganized, but persistent area of disturbed weather, which was first observed on August 15. At this time, the convection was located  northwest of <a href="Saipan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Saipan</a>. Initially, the system was located near the <a href="Intertropical_Convergence_Zone" title="wikilink">Intertropical Convergence Zone</a> (ITCZ), which enhanced the disturbance's convection. The disturbance was also located near a cold core <a href="upper-level_low" title="wikilink">upper-level low</a> and a <a href="tropical_upper-tropospheric_trough" title="wikilink">tropical upper-tropospheric trough</a> (TUTT). By 0300 <a href="UTC" class="uri" title="wikilink">UTC</a> on August 15, the system had become slightly more organized. Three hours later, the <a href="Joint_Typhoon_Warning_Center" title="wikilink">Joint Typhoon Warning Center</a> (JTWC) started watching the system. Thereafter, a dramatic increase in convection occurred over the northeast quadrant of the system.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> As such, the <a href="Japan_Meteorological_Agency" title="wikilink">Japan Meteorological Agency</a> (JMA) started watching the system early on August 16.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a>{{#tag:ref|The <a href="Japan_Meteorological_Agency" title="wikilink">Japan Meteorological Agency</a> is the official <a href="Regional_Specialized_Meteorological_Center" title="wikilink">Regional Specialized Meteorological Center</a> for the western Pacific Ocean.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a>|group=&quot;nb&quot;}} Several hours later, a <a href="Tropical_Cyclone_Formation_Alert" title="wikilink">Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert</a> (TCFA) was issued, even though a <a href="Hurricane_Hunter" title="wikilink">Hurricane Hunter</a> aircraft did not locate a <a href="atmospheric_circulation" title="wikilink">surface circulation</a>. Early on August 17, the TCFA was re-issued. That afternoon, the disturbance became more organized, with classifications via the <a href="Dvorak_technique" title="wikilink">Dvorak technique</a> yielding winds of . Based on this, both the JTWC and the JMA upgraded the disturbance into Tropical Storm Nelson.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>During the evening, a Hurricane Hunter aircraft reported a <a href="barometric_pressure" title="wikilink">barometric pressure</a> of ; however, they noted that the strongest winds were  north-northwest from the center. Early on August 18, data from another aircraft also noted that a <a href="subtropical_ridge" title="wikilink">subtropical ridge</a> had extended west of Nelson; consequently, the JTWC correctly anticipated Nelson to move west-northwest.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> At midday, the JMA upgraded Nelson to a <a href="tropical_cyclone_scales" title="wikilink">severe tropical storm</a>.
