<p><strong>The Metacomet Ridge</strong> or <strong>Metacomet Range</strong> of southern <a href="New_England" title="wikilink">New England</a> is a narrow and steep <a href="fault-block" class="uri" title="wikilink">fault-block</a> mountain ridge known for its extensive cliff faces, scenic vistas, <a href="microclimate" class="uri" title="wikilink">microclimate</a> ecosystems, and communities of plants considered rare or endangered. An important recreation resource located within  of a population corridor of over 2.5 million people, the ridge is home to four long distance <a href="hiking" class="uri" title="wikilink">hiking</a> trails and over a dozen parks and recreation areas including several state and nationally recognized historic sites. Because of its natural, historic, and recreational value, the ridge has been the focus of ongoing conservation efforts involving municipal, state, and national agencies as well as nearly two dozen <a href="non-profit_organization" title="wikilink">non-profit organizations</a>.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a><a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>The Metacomet Ridge extends from <a href="Long_Island_Sound" title="wikilink">Long Island Sound</a> in southern <a href="New_Haven_County,_Connecticut" title="wikilink">New Haven County, Connecticut</a>, through the <a href="Connecticut_River_Valley" title="wikilink">Connecticut River Valley</a> region of <a href="Massachusetts" class="uri" title="wikilink">Massachusetts</a>, to northern <a href="Franklin_County,_Massachusetts" title="wikilink">Franklin County</a>, , short of the <a href="Vermont" class="uri" title="wikilink">Vermont</a> and <a href="New_Hampshire" title="wikilink">New Hampshire</a> borders, a distance of . Younger and geologically distinct from the nearby <a href="Appalachian_Mountains" title="wikilink">Appalachian Mountains</a> and surrounding uplands, the Metacomet Ridge is composed of volcanic <a href="basalt" class="uri" title="wikilink">basalt</a>, also known as <em>traprock</em>, and <a href="sedimentary_rock" title="wikilink">sedimentary rock</a> in faulted and tilted layers many hundreds of feet thick. In most, but not all cases, the basalt layers are dominant, prevalent, and exposed. Although only  above sea level at its highest, with an average summit elevation of , the Metacomet Ridge rises dramatically from much lower valley elevations, making it a prominent landscape feature.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a><a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>

<p>North of the Holyoke Range, the apparent ridgeline of the Metacomet Ridge is broken by a discontinuity in the once dominant traprock strata. Underlying sedimentary layers remain but lack the same profile. Between the Holyoke Range and the <a href="Pocumtuck_Ridge" title="wikilink">Pocumtuck Ridge</a>, a  stretch, the Metacomet Ridge exists only as a series of mostly nondescript rises set among flat plains of sedimentary bedrock. Mount Warner, , in <a href="Hadley,_Massachusetts" title="wikilink">Hadley, Massachusetts</a>, the only significant peak in the area, is a geologically unrelated <a href="metamorphic_rock" title="wikilink">metamorphic rock</a> landform that extends west into the sedimentary strata.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> <img src="Mount_Tom_Massachusetts.jpg" title="fig:View from Mount Tom, Massachusetts, highest traprock peak of the Metacomet Ridge" alt="View from Mount Tom, Massachusetts, highest traprock peak of the Metacomet Ridge" width="120" /> The Metacomet Ridge picks up elevation again with the Pocumtuck Ridge, beginning on <a href="Sugarloaf_Mountain_(Franklin_County,_Massachusetts)" title="wikilink">Sugarloaf Mountain</a> and the parallel massif of <a href="Mount_Toby" title="wikilink">Mount Toby</a>, ,<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> the high point of the Metacomet Ridge geography. Both Sugarloaf Mountain and Mount Toby are composed of erosion-resistant sedimentary rock.

From Greenfield north to  short of the Vermont&lt;U+2013&gt;New Hampshire&lt;U+2013&gt;Massachusetts tri&lt;U+2013&gt;border, the profile of the Metacomet Ridge diminishes into a series of nondescript hills and low, wooded mountain peaks composed of sedimentary rock with dwindling traprock outcrops.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a><a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a><a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a></p>

However, low parallel hills and related strata along much of the range often make the actual geologic breadth of the Metacomet Ridge wider than the more noticeable ridgeline crests, up to  across in some areas.

Defunct quarry, Plainville Connecticut" /><img src="Bare_mountain_talus.jpg" title="fig:Talus slope on Bare Mountain of the Holyoke Range, Massachusetts" alt="Talus slope on Bare Mountain of the Holyoke Range, Massachusetts" /> The Metacomet Ridge is the result of <a href="rift" title="wikilink">continental rifting</a> processes that took place 200 million years ago during the <a href="Triassic" class="uri" title="wikilink">Triassic</a> and <a href="Jurassic" class="uri" title="wikilink">Jurassic</a> periods. The <a href="basalt" class="uri" title="wikilink">basalt</a> (also called traprock) crest of the Metacomet Ridge is the product of a series of massive <a href="lava" class="uri" title="wikilink">lava</a> flows hundreds of feet deep that welled up in faults created by the rifting apart of the <a href="North_America" title="wikilink">North American</a> continent from <a href="Eurasia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Eurasia</a> and <a href="Africa" class="uri" title="wikilink">Africa</a>. Essentially, the area now occupied by the Metacomet Ridge is a prehistoric <a href="rift_valley" title="wikilink">rift valley</a> which was once a branch of (or a parallel of) the major rift to the east that become the <a href="Atlantic_Ocean" title="wikilink">Atlantic Ocean</a>.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a></p>
<p>Basalt is an <a href="extrusive" class="uri" title="wikilink">extrusive</a> <a href="volcanic_rock" title="wikilink">volcanic rock</a>, dark in color, but the <a href="iron" class="uri" title="wikilink">iron</a> within it weathers to a rusty brown when exposed to the air, lending it a distinct reddish or purple&lt;U+2013&gt;red hue. Basalt frequently breaks into octagonal and pentagonal columns, creating a unique &quot;postpile&quot; appearance. Extensive slopes made of fractured basalt <a href="Scree" title="wikilink">talus</a> are visible at the base of many of the cliffs along the Metacomet Ridge.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a></p>
<p>The basalt floods of lava that now form much of the Metacomet Ridge took place over 20 million years. <a href="Erosion" class="uri" title="wikilink">Erosion</a> and <a href="Deposition_(geology)" title="wikilink">deposition</a> occurring between the eruptions deposited layers of sediment between the lava flows, some of it several miles thick, which eventually lithified into <a href="sedimentary_rock" title="wikilink">sedimentary rock</a>. The resulting &quot;layer cake&quot; of basalt and sedimentary rock eventually faulted and tilted upward (see <a href="fault-block" class="uri" title="wikilink">fault-block</a>). Subsequent erosion wore away many of the weaker sedimentary layers at a faster rate than the basalt layers, leaving the abruptly tilted edges of the basalt sheets exposed, creating the distinct linear ridge and dramatic cliff faces visible today.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> It is possible to envision this by imagining a layer cake tilted slightly up with some of the frosting (the sedimentary layer) removed in between. Evidence of this layer-cake structure is visible on <a href="Mount_Norwottuck" title="wikilink">Mount Norwottuck</a> of the <a href="Holyoke_Range" title="wikilink">Holyoke Range</a> in Massachusetts. The summit of Norwottuck is made of basalt; directly beneath the summit are the Horse Caves, a deep overhang where the weaker sedimentary layer has worn away at a more rapid rate than the basalt layer above it. <a href="Sugarloaf_Mountain_(Franklin_County,_Massachusetts)" title="wikilink">Mount Sugarloaf</a>, <a href="Pocumtuck_Ridge" title="wikilink">Pocumtuck Ridge</a>, and <a href="Mount_Toby" title="wikilink">Mount Toby</a>, also in Massachusetts, together present a larger &quot;layer cake&quot; example. The bottom layer is composed of <em><a href="arkose" title="wikilink">arkose sandstone</a>,</em> visible on Mount Sugarloaf. The middle layer is composed <em><a href="basalt" title="wikilink">volcanic traprock</a>,</em> most visible on the Pocumtuck Ridge. The top layer is composed of a sedimentary <a href="Conglomerate_(geology)" title="wikilink">conglomerate</a> known as <em>Mount Toby Conglomerate.</em> Faulting and <a href="earthquake" title="wikilink">earthquakes</a> during the period of continental rifting tilted the layers diagonally; subsequent erosion and glacial activity exposed the tilted layers of sandstone, basalt, and conglomerate visible today as three distinct mountain masses. Although Mount Toby and Mount Sugarloaf are not composed of <a href="traprock" class="uri" title="wikilink">traprock</a>, they are part of the Metacomet Ridge by virtue of their origin via the same rifting and uplift processes.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a></p>
<p>Of all the summits that make up the Metacomet Ridge, <a href="West_Rock" title="wikilink">West Rock</a>, in <a href="New_Haven,_Connecticut" title="wikilink">New Haven, Connecticut</a>, bears special mention because it was not formed by the volcanic flooding that created most of the traprock ridges. Rather, it is the remains of an enormous <a href="dike_(geology)" title="wikilink">volcanic dike</a> through which the basalt lava floods found access to the surface.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a></p>
<p>While the traprock cliffs remain the most obvious evidence of the prehistoric <em>geologic</em> processes of the Metacomet Ridge, the sedimentary rock of the ridge and surrounding terrain has produced equally significant evidence of prehistoric life in the form of Triassic and Jurassic <a href="fossil" title="wikilink">fossils</a>, in particular, <a href="dinosaur" class="uri" title="wikilink">dinosaur</a> tracks. At one site in <a href="Rocky_Hill,_Connecticut" title="wikilink">Rocky Hill, Connecticut</a>, more than 2,000 well preserved late Jurassic prints have been excavated.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> Other sites in Holyoke and Greenfield have likewise produced significant finds.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a><a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="ecosystem">Ecosystem</h2>
<p><img src="Agkistrodon_contortrix_mokasen_CDC.png" title="fig:Northern copperhead" alt="Northern copperhead" width="120" /> The Metacomet Ridge hosts a combination of <a href="microclimate" title="wikilink">microclimates</a> unusual to the region. Dry, hot upper ridges support <a href="oak_savanna" title="wikilink">oak savannas</a>, often dominated by <a href="chestnut_oak" title="wikilink">chestnut oak</a> and a variety of understory grasses and ferns. <a href="Juniperus_virginiana" title="wikilink">Eastern red cedar</a>, a dry-loving species, clings to the barren edges of cliffs. Backslope plant communities tend to be similar to the adjacent upland plateaus and nearby <a href="Appalachian_Mountains" title="wikilink">Appalachians</a>, containing species common to the <a href="northern_hardwood_forest" title="wikilink">northern hardwood</a> and <a href="oak-hickory_forest" title="wikilink">oak-hickory forest</a> ecosystem types. <a href="Tsuga_canadensis" title="wikilink">Eastern hemlock</a> crowds narrow ravines, blocking sunlight and creating damp, cooler growing conditions with associated cooler climate plant species. Talus slopes are especially rich in nutrients and support a number of calcium-loving plants uncommon in the region. Miles of high cliffs make ideal <a href="Bird_of_prey" title="wikilink">raptor</a> habitat, and the Metacomet Ridge is a seasonal raptor migration corridor. <img src="Ram&#39;s-Head_Lady&#39;s-Slipper_(Cypripedium_arietinum).jpg" title="fig:Ram&#39;s-head lady&#39;s slipper" alt="Ram&#39;s-head lady&#39;s slipper" width="100" />Because the topography of the ridge offers such varied terrain, many species reach the northern or southern limit of their range on the Metacomet Ridge; others are considered rare nationally or globally. Examples of rare species that live on the ridge include the <a href="prickly_pear" title="wikilink">prickly pear cactus</a>, <a href="peregrine_falcon" title="wikilink">peregrine falcon</a>, <a href="Agkistrodon_contortrix_mokasen" title="wikilink">northern copperhead</a>, <a href="Cypripedium_reginae" title="wikilink">showy lady's slipper</a>, <a href="Corydalis_lutea" title="wikilink">yellow corydalis</a>, <a href="Cypripedium_arietinum" title="wikilink">ram&lt;U+2019&gt;s&lt;U+2013&gt;head lady's slipper</a>, <a href="Pycnanthemum_clinopodioides" title="wikilink">basil mountain mint</a>, and <a href="Chamaelirium_luteum" title="wikilink">devil's bit lilly</a>.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a><a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a></p>

Major tribal groups active in the area included the <a href="Quinnipiac" class="uri" title="wikilink">Quinnipiac</a>, <a href="Niantic_(tribe)" title="wikilink">Niantic</a>, <a href="Pequot" class="uri" title="wikilink">Pequot</a>, <a href="Pocomtuc" class="uri" title="wikilink">Pocomtuc</a>, and <a href="Mohegan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mohegan</a>. <a href="Traprock" class="uri" title="wikilink">Traprock</a> was used to make tools and arrowheads. Natives hunted game, gathered plants and fruits, and fished in local bodies of water around the Metacomet Ridge. Tracts of woodland in the river bottoms surrounding the ridges were sometimes burned to facilitate the cultivation of crops such as <a href="Maize" title="wikilink">corn</a>, <a href="Squash_(plant)" title="wikilink">squash</a>, <a href="tobacco" class="uri" title="wikilink">tobacco</a>, and <a href="bean" title="wikilink">beans</a>.<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a><a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a> Native beliefs incorporated the natural features of the ridgeline and surrounding geography. Many Native American stories were in turn incorporated into regional colonial folklore. The giant stone spirit Hobbomock (or Hobomock), a prominent figure in many stories, was credited with diverting the course of the <a href="Connecticut_River" title="wikilink">Connecticut River</a> where it suddenly swings east in <a href="Middletown,_Connecticut" title="wikilink">Middletown, Connecticut</a> after several hundred miles of running due south. Hobbomuck is also credited with slaying a giant human-eating <a href="beaver" class="uri" title="wikilink">beaver</a> who lived in a great lake that supposedly existed in the <a href="Connecticut_River_Valley" title="wikilink">Connecticut River Valley</a> of Massachusetts. According to native beliefs as retold by European settlers, the corpse of the beaver remains visible as the Pocumtuck Ridge portion of the Metacomet Ridge.
