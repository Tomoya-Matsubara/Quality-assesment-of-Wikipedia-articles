<p><strong>David Bowie</strong> ( ;<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> born <strong>David Robert Jones</strong>, 8 January 1947) is an English <a href="rock_music" title="wikilink">rock</a> musician, who has also worked as an actor, record producer and <a href="Arrangement" title="wikilink">arranger</a>. A major figure for five decades in the world of <a href="popular_music" title="wikilink">popular music</a>, Bowie is widely regarded as an innovator, particularly for his work in the 1970s, and is known for his distinctive voice and the intellectual depth of his work.</p>
<p>Although he released an album (<em><a href="David_Bowie_(album)" title="wikilink">David Bowie</a></em>) and several singles earlier, Bowie first caught the eye and ear of the public in July 1969, when the song &quot;<a href="Space_Oddity_(song)" title="wikilink">Space Oddity</a>&quot; reached the top five of the <a href="UK_Singles_Chart" title="wikilink">UK Singles Chart</a>. After a three-year period of experimentation he re-emerged in 1972 during the <a href="glam_rock" title="wikilink">glam rock</a> era as the flamboyant, <a href="androgynous" class="uri" title="wikilink">androgynous</a> <a href="alter_ego" title="wikilink">alter ego</a> Ziggy Stardust, spearheaded by the hit single &quot;<a href="Starman_(song)" title="wikilink">Starman</a>&quot; and the album <em><a href="The_Rise_and_Fall_of_Ziggy_Stardust_and_the_Spiders_from_Mars" title="wikilink">The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars</a></em>. Bowie's impact at that time, as described by biographer David Buckley, &quot;challenged the core belief of the rock music of its day&quot; and &quot;created perhaps the biggest cult in popular culture.&quot;<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> The relatively short-lived Ziggy persona proved merely one facet of a career marked by continual reinvention, musical innovation and striking visual presentation.</p>
<p>In 1975, Bowie achieved his first major American crossover success with the number-one single &quot;<a href="Fame_(David_Bowie_song)" title="wikilink">Fame</a>&quot;, co-written with <a href="John_Lennon" title="wikilink">John Lennon</a>, and the hit album <em><a href="Young_Americans_(album)" title="wikilink">Young Americans</a></em>, which the singer characterised as &quot;<a href="plastic_soul" title="wikilink">plastic soul</a>&quot;. The sound constituted a radical shift in style that initially alienated many of his UK devotees. He then confounded the expectations of both his record label and his American audiences by recording the <a href="minimalist_music" title="wikilink">minimalist</a> album <em><a href="Low_(album)" title="wikilink">Low</a></em> (1977)&lt;U+2014&gt;the first of three collaborations with <a href="Brian_Eno" title="wikilink">Brian Eno</a> over the next two years. The so-called &quot;<a href="Berlin_Trilogy" title="wikilink">Berlin Trilogy</a>&quot; albums all reached the UK top five and garnered lasting critical praise.</p>
<p>After uneven commercial success in the late 1970s, Bowie had UK number ones with the 1980 single &quot;<a href="Ashes_to_Ashes_(David_Bowie_song)" title="wikilink">Ashes to Ashes</a>&quot; and its parent album, <em><a href="Scary_Monsters_(and_Super_Creeps)" title="wikilink">Scary Monsters (and Super Creeps)</a></em>. He paired with <a href="Queen_(band)" title="wikilink">Queen</a> for the 1981 UK chart-topping single &quot;<a href="Under_Pressure" title="wikilink">Under Pressure</a>&quot;, then reached a new commercial peak in 1983 with the album <em><a href="Let&#39;s_Dance_(David_Bowie_album)" title="wikilink">Let's Dance</a></em>, which yielded the hit singles &quot;<a href="Let&#39;s_Dance_(David_Bowie_song)" title="wikilink">Let's Dance</a>&quot;, &quot;<a href="China_Girl_(song)" title="wikilink">China Girl</a>&quot;, and &quot;<a href="Modern_Love_(song)" title="wikilink">Modern Love</a>&quot;. Throughout the 1990s and 2000s, Bowie continued to experiment with musical styles, including <a href="blue-eyed_soul" title="wikilink">blue-eyed soul</a>, <a href="industrial_music" title="wikilink">industrial</a>, <a href="adult_contemporary_music" title="wikilink">adult contemporary</a>, and <a href="drum_and_bass" title="wikilink">jungle</a>. His last recorded album was <em><a href="Reality_(David_Bowie_album)" title="wikilink">Reality</a></em> (2003), which was supported by the 2003&lt;U+2013&gt;2004 <a href="A_Reality_Tour" title="wikilink">Reality Tour</a>.</p>
<p>Buckley says of Bowie, &quot;His influence has been unique in popular culture&lt;U+2014&gt;he has permeated and altered more lives than any comparable figure.&quot;<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> In the BBC's 2002 poll of the <a href="100_Greatest_Britons" title="wikilink">100 Greatest Britons</a>, Bowie was placed at number 29. Throughout his career, he has sold an estimated 136Â million albums. In the United Kingdom, he has been awarded 9 Platinum album certifications, 11 Gold and 8 Silver, and in the United States, 5 Platinum and 7 Gold certifications. In 2004, <em><a href="Rolling_Stone" title="wikilink">Rolling Stone</a></em> ranked him 39th on their list of the &quot;100 Greatest Rock Artists of All Time&quot;, and 23rd on their list of the best singers of all-time.</p>

<h3 id="u201362-early-years">1947&lt;U+2013&gt;62: Early years</h3>
<p>David Bowie was born David Robert Jones in <a href="Brixton" class="uri" title="wikilink">Brixton</a>, London on 8 January 1947. His mother, Margaret Mary &quot;Peggy&quot; (n&lt;U+00E9&gt;e Burns), of Irish descent, worked as a cinema usherette, while his father, Haywood Stenton &quot;John&quot; Jones, was a promotions officer for <a href="Barnardo&#39;s" class="uri" title="wikilink">Barnardo's</a>. The family lived at 40 Stansfield Road, located near the border of the south London suburbs of Brixton and <a href="Stockwell" class="uri" title="wikilink">Stockwell</a>. A neighbour recalled that in a world still feeling the effects of <a href="Great_depression" title="wikilink">post-war depression</a>, &quot;London in the forties was the worst possible place, and the worst possible time for a child to grow up in.&quot; Bowie attended Stockwell Infants School until he was six years old, acquiring a reputation as a gifted and single-minded child&lt;U+2014&gt;and a defiant brawler.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a><a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>The family moved in 1953 to another nearby suburb, <a href="Bromley" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bromley</a>, where, two years later, Bowie progressed to Burnt Ash Junior School. His singing voice was considered &quot;adequate&quot; by the school choir, and his recorder playing judged to demonstrate above-average musical ability.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> At the age of nine, his dancing during the newly introduced <a href="music_and_movement" title="wikilink">music and movement</a> classes was strikingly imaginative: teachers called his interpretations &quot;vividly artistic&quot; and his poise &quot;astonishing&quot; for a child.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> The same year, his interest in music was further stimulated when his father brought home a collection of American <a href="Gramophone_record" title="wikilink">45s</a> by artists including <a href="Frankie_Lymon_and_the_Teenagers" title="wikilink">Frankie Lymon and the Teenagers</a>, <a href="The_Platters" title="wikilink">The Platters</a>, <a href="Fats_Domino" title="wikilink">Fats Domino</a>, <a href="Elvis_Presley" title="wikilink">Elvis Presley</a> and <a href="Little_Richard" title="wikilink">Little Richard</a>.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a><a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> Upon listening to &quot;<a href="Tutti_Frutti_(song)" title="wikilink">Tutti Frutti</a>&quot;, Bowie would later say, &quot;I had heard God&quot;.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> Presley's impact on him was likewise emphatic: &quot;I saw a cousin of mine dance to ... '<a href="Hound_Dog_(song)" title="wikilink">Hound Dog</a>' and I had never seen her get up and be moved so much by anything. It really impressed me, the power of the music. I started getting records immediately after that.&quot;<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> By the end of the following year he had taken up the <a href="ukelele" class="uri" title="wikilink">ukelele</a> and <a href="tea-chest_bass" title="wikilink">tea-chest bass</a> and begun to participate in <a href="skiffle" class="uri" title="wikilink">skiffle</a> sessions with friends, and had started to play the piano; meanwhile his stage presentation of numbers by both Presley and <a href="Chuck_Berry" title="wikilink">Chuck Berry</a>&lt;U+2014&gt;complete with gyrations in tribute to the original artists&lt;U+2014&gt;to his local <a href="Cub_Scout" title="wikilink">Wolf Cub</a> group was described as<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> Failing his <a href="eleven_plus_exam" title="wikilink">eleven plus exam</a> at the conclusion of his Burnt Ash Junior education, Bowie joined <a href="Ravens_Wood_School" title="wikilink">Bromley Technical High School</a>.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<p>It was an unusual technical school, as biographer Christopher Sandford writes: </p>
<p>Bowie studied art, music and design, including layout and typsetting. After Terry Burns, his half-brother, introduced him to modern <a href="jazz" class="uri" title="wikilink">jazz</a>, his enthusiasm for players like <a href="Charles_Mingus" title="wikilink">Charles Mingus</a> and <a href="John_Coltrane" title="wikilink">John Coltrane</a> led his mother to give him a plastic <a href="alto_saxophone" title="wikilink">alto saxophone</a> in 1961; he was soon receiving lessons from a local musician.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> He received a serious injury at school in 1962 when his friend George Underwood, wearing a ring on his finger, punched him in the left eye during a fight over a girl. Doctors feared he would lose the sight of the eye, and he was forced to stay out of school for a series of operations during a four-month hospitalisation.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> The damage could not be fully repaired, leaving him with faulty <a href="depth_perception" title="wikilink">depth perception</a> and a permanently <a href="mydriasis" title="wikilink">dilated pupil</a> (the latter producing Bowie's appearance of having <a href="Heterochromia" title="wikilink">different coloured eyes</a>, though each iris has the same blue colour). Despite their fisticuffs, Underwood and Bowie remained good friends, and Underwood went on to create the artwork for Bowie's early albums.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="u201368-the-kon-rads-to-the-riot-squad">1962&lt;U+2013&gt;68: The Kon-rads to the Riot Squad</h3>
<p>Graduating from his plastic saxophone to a real instrument in 1962, Bowie formed his first band at the age of 15. Playing guitar-based <a href="rock_and_roll" title="wikilink">rock and roll</a> at local youth gatherings and weddings, the Kon-rads had a varying line-up of between four and eight members, Underwood among them.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> When Bowie left the technical school the following year, he informed his parents of his intention to become a pop star. His mother promptly arranged his employment as an electrician's mate. Frustrated by his band-mates' limited aspirations, Bowie left the Kon-rads and formed another band, the King Bees. He wrote to the newly successful washing-machine entrepreneur <a href="John_Bloom_(businessman)" title="wikilink">John Bloom</a> inviting him to &quot;do for us what Brian Epstein has done for the Beatles&lt;U+2014&gt;and make another million.&quot; Bloom did not respond to the offer, but his referral to <a href="Dick_James" title="wikilink">Dick James</a>'s partner Leslie Conn led to Bowie's first personal management contract.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
<p>Conn quickly began to promote Bowie. The singer's debut single, &quot;<a href="Liza_Jane_(David_Bowie_song)" title="wikilink">Liza Jane</a>&quot;, credited to Davie Jones and the King Bees, had no commercial success. Dissatisfied with the King Bees and their repertoire of <a href="Howlin&#39;_Wolf" title="wikilink">Howlin' Wolf</a> and <a href="Willie_Dixon" title="wikilink">Willie Dixon</a> blues numbers, Bowie quit the band less than a month later to join the Manish Boys, another blues outfit, who incorporated folk and soul&lt;U+2014&gt;&quot;I used to dream of being their <a href="Mick_Jagger" title="wikilink">Mick Jagger</a>&quot;, Bowie was to recall.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> &quot;<a href="I_Pity_the_Fool" title="wikilink">I Pity the Fool</a>&quot; was no more successful than &quot;Liza Jane&quot;, and Bowie soon moved on again to join the Lower Third, a blues trio strongly influenced by <a href="The_Who" title="wikilink">The Who</a>. &quot;<a href="You&#39;ve_Got_a_Habit_of_Leaving" title="wikilink">You've Got a Habit of Leaving</a>&quot; fared no better, signalling the end of Conn's contract. Declaring that he would exit the pop world &quot;to study mime at <a href="Sadler&#39;s_Wells_Theatre" title="wikilink">Sadler's Wells</a>&quot;, Bowie nevertheless remained with the Lower Third. His new manager, Ralph Horton, later instrumental in his transition to solo artist, soon witnessed Bowie's move to yet another group, the Buzz, yielding the singer's fifth unsuccessful single release, &quot;<a href="Do_Anything_You_Say" title="wikilink">Do Anything You Say</a>&quot;. While with the Buzz, Bowie also joined the <a href="The_Riot_Squad" title="wikilink">Riot Squad</a>; their recordings, which included a Bowie number and <a href="The_Velvet_Underground" title="wikilink">Velvet Underground</a> material, went unreleased. Ken Pitt, introduced by Horton, took over as Bowie's manager.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>
<p>Dissatisfied with his stage name as Davy (and Davie) Jones, which in the mid-1960s invited confusion with <a href="Davy_Jones_(actor)" title="wikilink">Davy Jones</a> of <a href="The_Monkees" title="wikilink">The Monkees</a>, Bowie re-named himself after the 19th century American <a href="Frontiersman#American_frontier" title="wikilink">frontiersman</a> <a href="Jim_Bowie" title="wikilink">Jim Bowie</a> and <a href="Bowie_knife" title="wikilink">the knife he had popularised</a>.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> His April 1967 solo single, &quot;<a href="The_Laughing_Gnome" title="wikilink">The Laughing Gnome</a>&quot;, utilising sped-up <a href="The_Chipmunks" title="wikilink">Chipmunk</a>-style vocals, failed to chart. Released six weeks later, his album debut, <em><a href="David_Bowie_(album)" title="wikilink">David Bowie</a></em>, an amalgam of pop, <a href="psychedelic_rock" title="wikilink">psychedelia</a>, and <a href="music_hall" title="wikilink">music hall</a>, met the same fate. It would be his last release for two years.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a></p>
<p>Bowie's fascination with the bizarre was fuelled when he met dancer <a href="Lindsay_Kemp" title="wikilink">Lindsay Kemp</a>: &quot;He lived on his emotions, he was a wonderful influence. His day-to-day life was the most theatrical thing I had ever seen, ever. It was everything I thought Bohemia probably was. I joined the circus.&quot;<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> Kemp, for his part, recalled, &quot;I didn't really teach him to be a mime artiste but to be more of himself on the outside, ... I enabled him to free the angel and demon that he is on the inside.&quot;<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> Studying the dramatic arts under Kemp, from <a href="avant-garde" class="uri" title="wikilink">avant-garde</a> theatre and <a href="mime_artist" title="wikilink">mime</a> to <a href="Commedia_del_Arte" title="wikilink">Commedia dell'arte</a>, Bowie became immersed in the creation of personae to present to the world. Satirising life in a British prison, meanwhile, the Bowie-penned &quot;Over the Wall We Go&quot; became a 1967 single for <a href="Paul_Nicholas" title="wikilink">Oscar</a>; another Bowie composition, &quot;Silly Boy Blue&quot;, was released by <a href="Billy_Fury" title="wikilink">Billy Fury</a> the following year.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> After Kemp cast Bowie with Hermione Farthingale for a poetic minuet, the pair began dating; they soon moved into a London flat together. Playing acoustic guitar, she formed a group with Bowie and bassist John Hutchinson; between September 1968 and early 1969, when Bowie and Farthingale broke up, the trio gave a small number of concerts combining folk, <a href="Beat_music" title="wikilink">Merseybeat</a>, poetry and mime.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a></p>

<h4 id="space-oddity-to-hunky-dory"><em>Space Oddity</em> to <em>Hunky Dory</em></h4>
<p>Because of his lack of commercial success, Bowie was forced to try to earn a living in different ways. He featured in a <a href="Lyons_Maid" title="wikilink">Lyons Maid</a> ice cream commercial, but was rejected for another by <a href="Kit_Kat" title="wikilink">Kit Kat</a>.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> Intended as a vehicle to promote the singer, a 30-minute film featuring performances from his repertoire, <em><a href="Love_You_till_Tuesday_(film)" title="wikilink">Love You till Tuesday</a></em>, was made. Although not released until 1984, the filming sessions in January 1969 led to unexpected success when Bowie told the producers, &quot;That film of yours&lt;U+2014&gt;I've got a new song for it.&quot; He then demoed the song that would provide his commercial breakthrough. &quot;<a href="Space_Oddity_(song)" title="wikilink">Space Oddity</a>&quot; was released later in the year to coincide with the first moon landing.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> Breaking up with Farthingale shortly after completion of the film, Bowie moved in with Mary Finnigan as her lodger.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> Continuing the divergence from rock and roll and blues begun by his work with Farthingale, Bowie joined forces with Finnigan, Christina Ostrom and Barrie Jackson to run a folk club on Sunday nights at the Three Tuns <a href="public_house" title="wikilink">pub</a> in <a href="Beckenham" class="uri" title="wikilink">Beckenham</a> High Street.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> This soon morphed into the Beckenham Arts Lab, and became extremely popular. The Arts Lab hosted a free festival in a local park, later immortalised by Bowie in his song &quot;<a href="Memory_of_a_Free_Festival" title="wikilink">Memory of a Free Festival</a>&quot;.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> &quot;Space Oddity&quot; was released on 11 July, five days ahead of the <a href="Apollo_11" title="wikilink">Apollo 11</a> launch, to become a UK top five hit. Bowie's second album, <em><a href="Space_Oddity_(album)" title="wikilink">Space Oddity</a></em>, followed in November; originally issued in the UK as <em>David Bowie</em>, it caused some confusion with its predecessor of the same name, and the early US release was instead titled <em>Man of Words/Man of Music</em>. Featuring philosophical post-hippie lyrics on peace, love and morality, its acoustic folk rock occasionally fortified by harder rock, the album was not a commercial success at the time of its release.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a></p>

<p>Bowie met <a href="Angela_Bowie" title="wikilink">Angela Barnett</a> in April 1969. They would marry within a year. Her impact on him was immediate, and her involvement in his career far-reaching, leaving Pitt with limited influence.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> Having established himself as a solo artist with &quot;Space Oddity&quot;, Bowie now began to sense a lack: &quot;a full-time band for gigs and recording&lt;U+2014&gt;people he could relate to personally&quot;.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> The shortcoming was underlined by his artistic rivalry with <a href="Marc_Bolan" title="wikilink">Marc Bolan</a>, who was at the time acting as his session guitarist.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> A band was duly assembled. John Cambridge, a drummer Bowie met at the Arts Lab, was joined by <a href="Tony_Visconti" title="wikilink">Tony Visconti</a> on bass and <a href="Mick_Ronson" title="wikilink">Mick Ronson</a> on electric guitar. After a brief and disastrous manifestation as the Hype, the group reverted to a configuration presenting Bowie as a solo artist.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> Their initial studio work was marred by a heated disagreement between Bowie and Cambridge over the latter's drumming style; matters came to a head when Bowie, enraged, accused, &quot;You're fucking up my album.&quot; Cambridge summarily quit and was replaced by <a href="Mick_Woodmansey" title="wikilink">Mick Woodmansey</a>.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> Not long after, in a move that would result in years of litigation, at the conclusion of which Bowie would be forced to pay Pitt compensation, the singer fired his manager, replacing him with <a href="Tony_Defries" title="wikilink">Tony Defries</a>.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a></p>
<p>The studio sessions continued and resulted in Bowie's third album, <em><a href="The_Man_Who_Sold_the_World_(album)" title="wikilink">The Man Who Sold the World</a></em> (1970). Characterised by the heavy rock sound of his new backing band, it was a marked departure from the acoustic guitar and folk rock style established by <em>Space Oddity</em>. To promote it in the United States, <a href="Mercury_Records" title="wikilink">Mercury Records</a> financed a coast-to-coast publicity tour in which Bowie, between January and February 1971, was interviewed by radio stations and the media. Exploiting his <a href="androgyny" title="wikilink">androgynous</a> appearance, the original cover of the UK version unveiled two months later would depict the singer wearing a dress: taking the garment with him, he wore it during interviews&lt;U+2014&gt;to the approval of critics, including <em>Rolling Stone</em>{{'}}s John Mendelsohn who described him as &quot;ravishing, almost disconcertingly reminiscent of <a href="Lauren_Bacall" title="wikilink">Lauren Bacall</a>&quot;&lt;U+2014&gt;and in the street, to mixed reaction including laughter and, in the case of one male pedestrian, producing a gun and telling Bowie to &quot;kiss my ass&quot;.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a><a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> During the tour Bowie's observation of two seminal American proto-punk artists led him to develop a concept that would eventually find form in the Ziggy Stardust character: a melding of the persona of <a href="Iggy_Pop" title="wikilink">Iggy Pop</a> with the music of <a href="Lou_Reed" title="wikilink">Lou Reed</a>, producing &quot;the ultimate pop idol&quot;.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> A girlfriend recalled his &quot;scrawling notes on a cocktail napkin about a crazy rock star named Iggy or Ziggy&quot;, and on his return to England he declared his intention to create a character &quot;who looks like he's landed from Mars.&quot;<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a></p>
<p><em><a href="Hunky_Dory" title="wikilink">Hunky Dory</a></em> (1971) found Visconti, Bowie's producer and bassist, supplanted in both roles, by <a href="Ken_Scott" title="wikilink">Ken Scott</a> and <a href="Trevor_Bolder" title="wikilink">Trevor Bolder</a> respectively. The album saw the partial return of the fey pop singer of &quot;Space Oddity&quot;, with light fare such as &quot;<a href="Kooks_(song)" title="wikilink">Kooks</a>&quot;, a song written for his son, <a href="Duncan_Jones" title="wikilink">Duncan Zowie Haywood Jones</a>, born on 30 May.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> (His parents chose &quot;his kooky name&quot;&lt;U+2014&gt;he would be known as Zowie for the next 12 years&lt;U+2014&gt;after the Greek word <em>zoe</em>, life.)<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> Elsewhere, the album explored more serious themes, and found Bowie paying unusually direct homage to his influences with &quot;<a href="Song_for_Bob_Dylan" title="wikilink">Song for Bob Dylan</a>&quot;, &quot;<a href="Andy_Warhol_(David_Bowie_song)" title="wikilink">Andy Warhol</a>&quot;, and &quot;<a href="Queen_Bitch" title="wikilink">Queen Bitch</a>&quot;, a <a href="Velvet_Underground" title="wikilink">Velvet Underground</a> pastiche.

The album, which would remain in the chart for two years, was soon joined there by the six-month-old <em>Hunky Dory</em>. At the same time the non-album single &quot;<a href="John,_I&lt;U+2019&gt;m_Only_Dancing" title="wikilink">John, I&lt;U+2019&gt;m Only Dancing</a>&quot;, and &quot;<a href="All_the_Young_Dudes_(song)" title="wikilink">All the Young Dudes</a>&quot;, a song he wrote and produced for <a href="Mott_the_Hoople" title="wikilink">Mott the Hoople</a>, became UK hits.

<p>Bowie contributed backing vocals to Reed's 1972 solo breakthrough <em><a href="Transformer_(album)" title="wikilink">Transformer</a></em>, co-producing the album with Ronson.<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a> His own <em><a href="Aladdin_Sane" title="wikilink">Aladdin Sane</a></em> (1973) topped the UK chart, his first number one album. Described by Bowie as &quot;Ziggy goes to America&quot;, it contained songs he wrote while travelling to and across the United States during the earlier part of the Ziggy tour, which now continued to Japan to promote the new album. <em>Aladdin Sane</em> spawned the UK top five singles &quot;<a href="The_Jean_Genie" title="wikilink">The Jean Genie</a>&quot; and &quot;<a href="Drive-In_Saturday" title="wikilink">Drive-In Saturday</a>&quot;.<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a><a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a></p>
<p>Bowie's love of acting led his total immersion in the characters he created for his music. &quot;Offstage I'm a robot. Onstage I achieve emotion. It's probably why I prefer dressing up as Ziggy to being David.&quot; With satisfaction came severe personal difficulties: acting the same role over an extended period, it became impossible for him to separate Ziggy Stardust&lt;U+2014&gt;and, later, the Thin White Duke&lt;U+2014&gt;from his own character offstage. Ziggy, Bowie said, &quot;wouldn't leave me alone for years. That was when it all started to go sour ... My whole personality was affected. It became very dangerous. I really did have doubts about my sanity.&quot;<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a> His later Ziggy shows, which included songs from both <em>Ziggy Stardust</em> and <em>Aladdin Sane</em>, were ultra-theatrical affairs filled with shocking stage moments, such as Bowie stripping down to a <a href="sumo" title="wikilink">sumo wrestling</a> loincloth or simulating <a href="oral_sex" title="wikilink">oral sex</a> with Ronson's guitar.<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a> Bowie toured and gave press conferences as Ziggy before a dramatic and abrupt on-stage &quot;retirement&quot; at London's <a href="Hammersmith_Odeon" title="wikilink">Hammersmith Odeon</a> on 3 July 1973. Footage from the final show was released in 1983 for the film <em><a href="Ziggy_Stardust_and_the_Spiders_from_Mars_(film)" title="wikilink">Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars</a></em>.<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a></p>

<p>After breaking up the Spiders from Mars, Bowie attempted to move on from his Ziggy persona. His back catalogue was now highly sought: <em>The Man Who Sold the World</em> had been re-released in 1972 along with <em>Space Oddity</em>. &quot;<a href="Life_on_Mars_(song)" title="wikilink">Life on Mars?</a>&quot;, from <em>Hunky Dory</em>, was released in June 1973 and made number three in the UK singles chart. Entering the same chart in September, Bowie's novelty record from 1967, &quot;<a href="The_Laughing_Gnome" title="wikilink">The Laughing Gnome</a>&quot;, would reach number four.<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a> <em><a href="Pin_Ups" title="wikilink">Pin Ups</a></em>, a collection of covers of his 1960s favourites, followed in October, producing a UK number three hit in &quot;<a href="Sorrow_(David_Bowie_song)" title="wikilink">Sorrow</a>&quot; and itself peaking at number one, making David Bowie the best-selling act of 1973 in the UK.

<p><img src="Bowie-DD-1974-3.jpg" title="fig:Bowie performing during the 1974 Diamond Dogs Tour" alt="Bowie performing during the 1974 Diamond Dogs Tour" width="200" /> Bowie moved to the United States in 1974, initially staying in <a href="New_York_City" title="wikilink">New York City</a> before settling in <a href="Los_Angeles" title="wikilink">Los Angeles</a>.<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a> <em><a href="Diamond_Dogs" title="wikilink">Diamond Dogs</a></em> (1974), parts of which found him heading towards <a href="soul_(music)" title="wikilink">soul</a> and <a href="funk" class="uri" title="wikilink">funk</a>, was the product of two distinct ideas: a musical based on a wild future in a post-<a href="apocalypse" title="wikilink">apocalyptic</a> city, and setting <a href="George_Orwell" title="wikilink">George Orwell</a>'s <em><a href="Nineteen_Eighty-Four" title="wikilink">1984</a></em> to music.<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a> The album went to number one in the UK, spawning the hits &quot;<a href="Rebel_Rebel" title="wikilink">Rebel Rebel</a>&quot; and &quot;<a href="Diamond_Dogs_(song)" title="wikilink">Diamond Dogs</a>&quot;, and number five in the US. To promote it, Bowie launched the <a href="Diamond_Dogs_Tour" title="wikilink">Diamond Dogs Tour</a>, visiting cities in North America between June and December 1974. Choreographed by <a href="Toni_Basil" title="wikilink">Toni Basil</a>, and lavishly produced with theatrical special effects, the high-budget stage production was filmed by <a href="Alan_Yentob" title="wikilink">Alan Yentob</a>. The resulting documentary, <em><a href="Cracked_Actor" title="wikilink">Cracked Actor</a></em>, featured a pasty and emaciated Bowie: the tour coincided with the singer's slide from heavy <a href="cocaine" class="uri" title="wikilink">cocaine</a> use into addiction, producing severe physical debilitation, <a href="paranoia" class="uri" title="wikilink">paranoia</a> and emotional problems.<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a> He later commented that the accompanying live album, <em><a href="David_Live" title="wikilink">David Live</a></em>, ought to have been titled &quot;David Bowie Is Alive and Well and Living Only In Theory&quot;. <em>David Live</em> nevertheless solidified Bowie's status as a superstar, charting at number two in the UK and number eight in the US. It also spawned a UK number ten hit in Bowie's cover of &quot;<a href="Knock_on_Wood_(song)" title="wikilink">Knock on Wood</a>&quot;. After a break in <a href="Philadelphia,_Pennsylvania" title="wikilink">Philadelphia</a>, where Bowie recorded new material, the tour resumed with a new emphasis on soul.<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a></p>
<p>The fruit of the Philadelphia recording sessions was <em><a href="Young_Americans_(album)" title="wikilink">Young Americans</a></em> (1975). Biographer Christopher Sandford writes, &quot;Over the years, most British rockers had tried, one way or another, to become black-by-extension. Few had succeeded as Bowie did now.&quot;<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a> The album's sound, which the singer identified as &quot;<a href="plastic_soul" title="wikilink">plastic soul</a>&quot;, constituted a radical shift in style that initially alienated many of his UK devotees.<a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a> <em>Young Americans</em> yielded Bowie's first US number one, &quot;<a href="Fame_(David_Bowie_song)" title="wikilink">Fame</a>&quot;, co-written with <a href="John_Lennon" title="wikilink">John Lennon</a>, who contributed backing vocals, and <a href="Carlos_Alomar" title="wikilink">Carlos Alomar</a>. Earning the distinction of being one of the first white artists to appear on the US variety show <em><a href="Soul_Train" title="wikilink">Soul Train</a></em>, Bowie mimed &quot;Fame&quot;, as well as &quot;<a href="Golden_Years_(song)" title="wikilink">Golden Years</a>&quot;, his October single.<a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a> <em>Young Americans</em> was a commercial success in both the US and the UK, and a re-issue of the 1969 single &quot;Space Oddity&quot; became Bowie's first number one hit in the UK a few months after &quot;Fame&quot; achieved the same in the US.<a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a></p>
<p>Despite his by now well established superstardom, Bowie, in the words of biographer Christopher Sandford, &quot;for all his record sales (over a million copies of <em>Ziggy Stardust</em> alone), existed essentially on loose change.&quot;<a href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a> In 1975, in a move echoing Pitt's acrimonious dismissal 15 years earlier, Bowie fired his manager. At the culmination of the ensuing months-long legal dispute, he watched, as described by Sandford, &quot;millions of dollars of his future earnings being surrendered&quot; in what were &quot;uniquely generous terms for Defries&quot;, then &quot;shut himself up in West 20th Street, where for a week his howls could be heard through the locked attic door.&quot;<a href="#fn67" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a> Michael Lippman, Bowie's lawyer during the negotiations, became his new manager; Lippman in turn would be awarded substantial compensation when Bowie fired him the following year.<a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a></p>
<p><img src="David_Bowie_1976.jpg" title="fig:Bowie at the O&#39;Keefe center, Toronto 1976" alt="Bowie at the O&#39;Keefe center, Toronto 1976" width="250" /> <em><a href="Station_to_Station" title="wikilink">Station to Station</a></em> (1976) introduced a new Bowie persona, the &quot;Thin White Duke&quot; of its title track. Visually, the character was an extension of Thomas Jerome Newton, the extraterrestrial being he portrayed in the film <em><a href="The_Man_Who_Fell_to_Earth_(film)" title="wikilink">The Man Who Fell to Earth</a></em> the same year.<a href="#fn69" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref69"><sup>69</sup></a> Developing the funk and soul of <em>Young Americans</em>, <em>Station to Station</em> also prefigured the <a href="Krautrock" class="uri" title="wikilink">Krautrock</a> and synthesiser music of his next releases. The extent to which drug addiction was now affecting Bowie was made public when <a href="Russell_Harty" title="wikilink">Russell Harty</a> interviewed the singer for his <a href="London_Weekend_Television" title="wikilink">London Weekend Television</a> talk show in anticipation of the album's supporting tour. Shortly before the satellite-linked interview was scheduled to commence, the death of the Spanish dictator <a href="Francisco_Franco" title="wikilink">General Franco</a> was announced. Bowie was asked to relinquish the satellite booking, to allow the Spanish Government to put out a live newsfeed. This he refused to do, and his interview went ahead. In the ensuing conversation with Harty, as described by biographer David Buckley, &quot;the singer made hardly any sense at all throughout what was quite an extensive interview. [...] Bowie looked completely disconnected and was hardly able to utter a coherent sentence.&quot;<a href="#fn70" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a> His sanity&lt;U+2014&gt;by his own later admission&lt;U+2014&gt;became twisted from cocaine; he overdosed several times during the year, and was withering physically to an alarming degree.<a href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a><a href="#fn72" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref72"><sup>72</sup></a></p>
<p><em>Station to Station</em>{{'}}s January 1976 release was followed in February by a three-and-a-half-month concert tour of Europe and North America. Featuring a starkly lit set, the <a href="Isolar_&lt;U+2013&gt;_1976_Tour" title="wikilink">Isolar &lt;U+2013&gt; 1976 Tour</a> highlighted songs from the album, including the dramatic and lengthy <a href="Station_to_Station_(song)" title="wikilink">title track</a>, the ballads &quot;<a href="Wild_Is_the_Wind_(song)" title="wikilink">Wild Is the Wind</a>&quot; and &quot;<a href="Word_on_a_Wing" title="wikilink">Word on a Wing</a>&quot;, and the funkier &quot;<a href="TVC_15" title="wikilink">TVC 15</a>&quot; and &quot;<a href="Stay_(David_Bowie_song)" title="wikilink">Stay</a>&quot;.

The tour was highly successful but mired in political controversy. Bowie was quoted in <a href="Stockholm" class="uri" title="wikilink">Stockholm</a> as saying that &quot;Britain could benefit from a Fascist leader&quot;, and detained by <a href="customs" class="uri" title="wikilink">customs</a> on the Russian/Polish border for possessing <a href="Nazism" title="wikilink">Nazi</a> paraphernalia.<a href="#fn73" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref73"><sup>73</sup></a> Matters came to a head in London in May in what became known as the &quot;<a href="London_Victoria_station" title="wikilink">Victoria Station</a> incident&quot;. Arriving in an open-top <a href="Mercedes-Benz" title="wikilink">Mercedes</a> <a href="convertible" class="uri" title="wikilink">convertible</a>, the singer waved to the crowd in a gesture that some alleged was a Nazi salute, which was captured on camera and published in <em><a href="NME" class="uri" title="wikilink">NME</a></em>. Bowie said the photographer simply caught him in mid-wave.<a href="#fn74" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref74"><sup>74</sup></a> He later blamed his pro-Fascism comments and his behaviour during the period on his addictions and the character of the Thin White Duke.<a href="#fn75" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref75"><sup>75</sup></a> &quot;I was out of my mind, totally crazed.

In the new environment, his cocaine use increased; so too did his interest in pursuits outside his musical career. He took up painting, producing a number of post-modernist pieces. When on tour, he took to sketching in a notebook, and photographing scenes for later reference. Visiting galleries in <a href="Geneva" class="uri" title="wikilink">Geneva</a> and the <a href="Br&lt;U+00FC&gt;cke_Museum" title="wikilink">Br&lt;U+00FC&gt;cke Museum</a> in <a href="Berlin" class="uri" title="wikilink">Berlin</a>, Bowie became, in the words of biographer Christopher Sandford, &quot;a prolific producer and collector of contemporary art. [...] Not only did he become a well-known patron of expressionist art: locked in Clos des MÃ©sanges he began an intensive self-improvement course in classical music and literature, and started work on an autobiography&quot;.<a href="#fn78" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref78"><sup>78</sup></a></p>
<p>Before the end of 1976, Bowie's interest in the burgeoning German music scene, as well as his drug addiction, prompted him to move to <a href="West_Berlin" title="wikilink">West Berlin</a> to clean up and revitalise his career. Working with <a href="Brian_Eno" title="wikilink">Brian Eno</a> while sharing an apartment in <a href="Sch&lt;U+00F6&gt;neberg" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sch&lt;U+00F6&gt;neberg</a> with Iggy Pop, he began to focus on minimalist, ambient music for the first of three albums, co-produced with Tony Visconti, that would become known as his <a href="Berlin_Trilogy" title="wikilink">Berlin Trilogy</a>.<a href="#fn79" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref79"><sup>79</sup></a> During the same period, Pop, with Bowie as a co-writer and musician, completed his solo album debut, <em><a href="The_Idiot_(album)" title="wikilink">The Idiot</a></em>, and its follow-up, <em><a href="Lust_for_Life_(album)" title="wikilink">Lust for Life</a></em>, touring the UK, Europe, and the US in March and April 1977.<a href="#fn80" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref80"><sup>80</sup></a> <em><a href="Low_(album)" title="wikilink">Low</a></em> (1977), partly influenced by the <a href="Krautrock" class="uri" title="wikilink">Krautrock</a> sound of <a href="Kraftwerk" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kraftwerk</a> and <a href="Neu!" class="uri" title="wikilink">Neu!</a>, evidenced a move away from narration in Bowie's songwriting to a more abstract musical form in which lyrics were sporadic and optional. It received considerable negative criticism upon its release&lt;U+2014&gt;a release which RCA, anxious to maintain the established commercial momentum, did not welcome, and which Bowie's ex-manager, Tony Defries, who still maintained a significant financial interest in the singer's affairs, tried to prevent. Despite these forebodings, <em>Low</em> yielded the UK number three single &quot;<a href="Sound_and_Vision" title="wikilink">Sound and Vision</a>&quot;, and its own performance surpassed that of <em>Station to Station</em> in the UK chart, where it reached number two. Leading contemporary composer <a href="Phillip_Glass" title="wikilink">Phillip Glass</a> described <em>Low</em> as &quot;a work of genius&quot; in 1992, when he used it as the basis for his <a href="Symphony_No._1_(Glass)" title="wikilink"><em>Symphony No. 1 &quot;Low&quot;</em></a>; subsequently, Glass used Bowie's next album as the basis for his 1996 <a href="Symphony_No._4_(Glass)" title="wikilink"><em>Symphony No. 4 &quot;Heroes&quot;</em></a>.<a href="#fn81" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref81"><sup>81</sup></a><a href="#fn82" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref82"><sup>82</sup></a> Glass has praised Bowie's gift for creating &quot;fairly complex pieces of music, masquerading as simple pieces&quot;.<a href="#fn83" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref83"><sup>83</sup></a></p>

<p>Echoing <em>Low</em>{{'}}s minimalist, instrumental approach, the second of the trilogy, <em><a href="&quot;Heroes&quot;" class="uri" title="wikilink">&quot;Heroes&quot;</a></em> (1977), incorporated pop and rock to a greater extent, seeing Bowie joined by guitarist <a href="Robert_Fripp" title="wikilink">Robert Fripp</a>. Like <em>Low</em>, <em>&quot;Heroes&quot;</em> evinced the <a href="zeitgeist" class="uri" title="wikilink">zeitgeist</a> of the Cold War, symbolised by the divided city of Berlin.<a href="#fn84" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref84"><sup>84</sup></a> Incorporating ambient sounds from a variety of sources including white noise generators, synthesizers and <a href="koto_(musical_instrument)" title="wikilink">koto</a>, the album was another hit, reaching number three in the UK. Its <a href="&quot;Heroes&quot;_(song)" title="wikilink">title track</a>, though only reaching number 24 in the UK singles chart, gained lasting popularity, and within months had been released in both German and French.<a href="#fn85" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref85"><sup>85</sup></a> Towards the end of the year, Bowie performed the song for Marc Bolan's television show <em>Marc</em>, and again two days later for <a href="Bing_Crosby" title="wikilink">Bing Crosby</a>'s televised Christmas special, when he joined Crosby in &quot;<a href="Peace_on_Earth/Little_Drummer_Boy" title="wikilink">Peace on Earth/Little Drummer Boy</a>&quot;, a version of &quot;<a href="The_Little_Drummer_Boy" title="wikilink">The Little Drummer Boy</a>&quot; with a new, <a href="contrapuntal" class="uri" title="wikilink">contrapuntal</a> verse. Five years later, the duet would prove a worldwide seasonal hit, charting in the UK at number three on Christmas Day, 1982.<a href="#fn86" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref86"><sup>86</sup></a></p>
<p>After completing <em>Low</em> and <em>&quot;Heroes&quot;</em>, Bowie spent much of 1978 on the <a href="Isolar_II_&lt;U+2013&gt;_The_1978_World_Tour" title="wikilink">Isolar II world tour</a>, bringing the music of the first two Berlin Trilogy albums to almost a million people during 70 concerts in 12 countries. By now he had broken his drug addiction; biographer David Buckley writes that Isolar II was &quot;Bowie's first tour for five years in which he had probably not anaesthetised himself with copious quantities of cocaine before taking the stage. [...] Without the oblivion that drugs had brought, he was now in a healthy enough mental condition to want to make friends.&quot;<a href="#fn87" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref87"><sup>87</sup></a> Recordings from the tour made up the live album <em><a href="Stage_(David_Bowie_album)" title="wikilink">Stage</a></em>, released the same year.<a href="#fn88" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref88"><sup>88</sup></a></p>
<p>The final piece in what Bowie called his &quot;<a href="triptych" class="uri" title="wikilink">triptych</a>&quot;, <em><a href="Lodger_(album)" title="wikilink">Lodger</a></em> (1979), eschewed the minimalist, ambient nature of the other two, making a partial return to the drum and guitar based rock and pop of his pre-Berlin era. The result was a complex mixture of <a href="New_Wave_music" title="wikilink">New Wave</a> and <a href="World_Music" title="wikilink">World Music</a>, in places incorporating <a href="Hejaz" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hejaz</a> <a href="Musical_scale#Non-Western_scales" title="wikilink">non-Western scales</a>. Some tracks were composed using Eno and <a href="Peter_Schmidt_(artist)" title="wikilink">Peter Schmidt</a>'s <a href="Oblique_Strategies" title="wikilink">Oblique Strategies</a> cards: &quot;Boys Keep Swinging&quot; entailed band members swapping instruments, &quot;Move On&quot; used the chords from Bowie's early composition &quot;All the Young Dudes&quot; played backwards, and &quot;Red Money&quot; took backing tracks from &quot;Sister Midnight&quot;, a piece previously composed with Iggy Pop.<a href="#fn89" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref89"><sup>89</sup></a> The album was recorded in Switzerland.

<h2 id="acting-career">Acting career</h2>

<p>Biographer David Buckley writes, &quot;The essence of Bowie's contribution to popular music can be found in his outstanding ability to analyse and select ideas from outside the mainstreamâfrom art, literature, theatre and filmâand to bring them inside, so that the currency of pop is constantly being changed.&quot;<a href="#fn144" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref144"><sup>144</sup></a> Buckley says &quot;Just one person took glam rock to new rarefied heights and invented character-playing in pop, marrying theatre and popular music in one seamless, powerful whole.&quot;<a href="#fn145" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref145"><sup>145</sup></a> Bowie's career has also been punctuated by various roles in film and theatre productions, earning him some acclaim as an actor in his own right.</p>

Another musician, <a href="Ryuichi_Sakamoto" title="wikilink">Ryuichi Sakamoto</a>, played the camp commandant who begins to be undermined by Celliers' bizarre behaviour. Bowie had a cameo in <em><a href="Yellowbeard" class="uri" title="wikilink">Yellowbeard</a></em>, a 1983 pirate comedy created by <a href="Monty_Python" title="wikilink">Monty Python</a> members, and a small part as Colin, the <a href="hitman" class="uri" title="wikilink">hitman</a> in the 1985 film <em><a href="Into_the_Night_(film)" title="wikilink">Into the Night</a></em>.

<h2 id="sexual-orientation">Sexual orientation</h2>
<p>Buckley writes, &quot;If Ziggy confused both his creator and his audience, a big part of that confusion centred on the topic of sexuality.&quot;<a href="#fn156" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref156"><sup>156</sup></a> Bowie declared himself <a href="bisexuality" title="wikilink">bisexual</a> in an interview with <em><a href="Melody_Maker" title="wikilink">Melody Maker</a></em> in January 1972, a move coinciding with the first shots in his campaign for stardom as <a href="The_Rise_and_Fall_of_Ziggy_Stardust_and_the_Spiders_from_Mars" title="wikilink">Ziggy Stardust</a>.<a href="#fn157" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref157"><sup>157</sup></a> In a September 1976 interview with <em><a href="Playboy" class="uri" title="wikilink">Playboy</a></em>, Bowie said: &quot;It's true&lt;U+2014&gt;I am a bisexual.

<p>In a 1983 interview with <em>Rolling Stone</em>, Bowie said his public declaration of bisexuality was &quot;the biggest mistake I ever made&quot;, and on other occasions he said his interest in homosexual and bisexual culture had been more a product of the times and the situation in which he found himself than his own feelings; as described by Buckley, he said he had been driven more by &quot;a compulsion to flout moral codes than a real biological and psychological state of being&quot;.<a href="#fn159" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref159"><sup>159</sup></a><a href="#fn160" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref160"><sup>160</sup></a></p>
<p>Asked in 2002 by <em><a href="Blender_(magazine)" title="wikilink">Blender</a></em> whether he still believed his public declaration was the biggest mistake he ever made, he replied:</p>

<p>Buckley's view of the period is that Bowie, &quot;a taboo-breaker and a dabbler ... mined sexual intrigue for its ability to shock&quot;,<a href="#fn161" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref161"><sup>161</sup></a> and that &quot;it is probably true that Bowie was never gay, nor even consistently actively bisexual ... he did, from time to time, experiment, even if only out of a sense of curiosity and a genuine allegiance with the 'transgressional'.&quot;<a href="#fn162" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref162"><sup>162</sup></a> Biographer Christopher Sandford says that according to Mary Finnigan, with whom Bowie had an affair in 1969, the singer and his first wife Angie &quot;lived in a fantasy world [...] and they created their bisexual fantasy.&quot;<a href="#fn163" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref163"><sup>163</sup></a> Sandford tells how, during the marriage, Bowie &quot;made a positive fetish of repeating the quip that he and his wife had met while 'fucking the same bloke' [...] Gay sex was always an anecdotal and laughing matter. That Bowie's actual tastes swung the other way is clear from even a partial tally of his affairs with women.&quot;<a href="#fn164" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref164"><sup>164</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="musicianship">Musicianship</h2>
<p>A man of many voices, Bowie, from the time of his earliest recordings in the 1960s, has employed a wide variety of musical styles. His early compositions and performances were strongly influenced not only by rock and rollers like <a href="Little_Richard" title="wikilink">Little Richard</a> and <a href="Elvis_Presley" title="wikilink">Elvis Presley</a> but also by the wider world of show business. He particularly strove to emulate the British musical theatre singer-songwriter and actor <a href="Anthony_Newley" title="wikilink">Anthony Newley</a>, whose vocal style he frequently adopted, and made prominent use of for his 1967 debut release, <em><a href="David_Bowie_(album)" title="wikilink">David Bowie</a></em> (to the disgust of Newley himself, who destroyed the copy he received from Bowie's publisher).<a href="#fn165" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref165"><sup>165</sup></a><a href="#fn166" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref166"><sup>166</sup></a> Bowie's <a href="music_hall" title="wikilink">music hall</a> fascination continued to surface sporadically alongside such diverse styles as hard rock and heavy metal, soul, psychedelic folk and pop.<a href="#fn167" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref167"><sup>167</sup></a></p>
<p><img src="David_Bowie_holywood.jpg" title="fig:David Bowie on the Hollywood Walk of Fame" alt="David Bowie on the Hollywood Walk of Fame" width="240" /> Musicologist James Perone observes Bowie's use of octave switches for different repetitions of the same melody, exemplified in his commercial breakthrough single, &quot;<a href="Space_Oddity_(song)" title="wikilink">Space Oddity</a>&quot;, and later in the song &quot;<a href="&quot;Heroes&quot;_(song)" title="wikilink">Heroes</a>&quot;, to dramatic effect; Perone notes that &quot;in the lowest part of his vocal register [...] his voice has an almost crooner-like richness.&quot;<a href="#fn168" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref168"><sup>168</sup></a></p>
<p>Voice instructor Jo Thompson describes Bowie's vocal vibrato technique as &quot;particularly deliberate and distinctive&quot;.<a href="#fn169" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref169"><sup>169</sup></a> Schinder and Schwartz call him &quot;a vocalist of extraordinary technical ability, able to pitch his singing to particular effect.&quot;<a href="#fn170" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref170"><sup>170</sup></a> Here, too, as in his stagecraft and songwriting, the singer's chamaeleon-like nature is evident: historiographer Michael Campbell says that Bowie's lyrics &quot;arrest our ear, without question.

<h2 id="legacy">Legacy</h2>
<p>Bowie's innovative songs and stagecraft brought a new dimension to popular music in the early 1970s, strongly influencing both its immediate forms and its subsequent development. A pioneer of glam rock, Bowie, according to music historians Schinder and Schwartz, has joint responsibility with Marc Bolan for creating the genre.<a href="#fn176" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref176"><sup>176</sup></a> At the same time, he inspired the innovators of the punk rock music movement&lt;U+2014&gt;historiographer Michael Campbell calls him &quot;one of punk's seminal influences&quot;. While punk musicians trashed the conventions of pop stardom, Bowie moved on againâinto a more abstract style of music making that would in turn become a transforming influence. Biographer David Buckley writes, &quot;At a time when punk rock was noisily reclaiming the three-minute pop song in a show of public defiance, Bowie almost completely abandoned traditional rock instrumentation.&quot;<a href="#fn177" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref177"><sup>177</sup></a><a href="#fn178" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref178"><sup>178</sup></a> Bowie's record company sought to convey his unique status in popular music with the slogan, &quot;There is old wave, there is new wave, and there is Bowie...&quot;<a href="#fn179" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref179"><sup>179</sup></a> Musicologist James Perone credits him with having &quot;brought sophistication to rock music&quot;, and critical reviews frequently acknowledge the intellectual depth of his work and influence.<a href="#fn180" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref180"><sup>180</sup></a><a href="#fn181" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref181"><sup>181</sup></a><a href="#fn182" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref182"><sup>182</sup></a></p>
<p>Buckley writes that, in an early 1970s pop world that was &quot;Bloated, self-important, leather-clad, self-satisfied, [...] Bowie challenged the core belief of the rock music of its day.&quot; As described by <a href="John_Peel" title="wikilink">John Peel</a>, &quot;The one distinguishing feature about early-70s progressive rock was that it didn't progress. Before Bowie came along, people didn't want too much change.&quot; Buckley says that Bowie &quot;subverted the whole notion of what it was to be a rock star&quot;, with the result that &quot;After Bowie there has been no other pop icon of his stature, because the pop world that produces these rock gods doesn't exist any more. [...] The fierce partisanship of the cult of Bowie was also uniqueâits influence lasted longer and has been more creative than perhaps almost any other force within pop fandom.&quot; Buckley concludes that &quot;Bowie is both star and icon. The vast body of work he has produced [...] has created perhaps the biggest cult in popular culture. [...] His influence has been unique in popular cultureâhe has permeated and altered more lives than any comparable figure.&quot;<a href="#fn183" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref183"><sup>183</sup></a></p>
<p>Bowie was inducted into the <a href="Rock_and_Roll_Hall_of_Fame" title="wikilink">Rock and Roll Hall of Fame</a> in 1996.<a href="#fn184" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref184"><sup>184</sup></a> Through perpetual reinvention, he has seen his influence continue to broaden and extend: music reviewer Brad Filicky writes that over the decades, &quot;Bowie has become known as a musical chameleon, changing and dictating trends as much as he has altered his style to fit&quot;, influencing fashion and pop culture to a degree &quot;second only to Madonna&quot;.<a href="#fn185" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref185"><sup>185</sup></a> Biographer Thomas Forget adds, &quot;Because he has succeeded in so many different styles of music, it is almost impossible to find a popular artist today that has not been influenced by David Bowie.&quot;<a href="#fn186" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref186"><sup>186</sup></a></p>
