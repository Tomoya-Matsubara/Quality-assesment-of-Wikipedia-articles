<p><strong>Emeric</strong>, also known as <strong>Imre</strong> (, , ; 117430 November 1204), was <a href="King_of_Hungary" title="wikilink">King of Hungary</a> and <a href="King_of_Croatia" title="wikilink">Croatia</a> between 1196 and 1204. In 1184, his father, <a href="B&lt;U+00E9&gt;la_III_of_Hungary" title="wikilink">B&lt;U+00E9&gt;la III of Hungary</a>, ordered that he be crowned king, and appointed him as ruler of <a href="Kingdom_of_Croatia_(1102&lt;U+2013&gt;1526)" title="wikilink">Croatia</a> and <a href="Dalmatia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Dalmatia</a> around 1195. Emeric ascended the throne after the death of his father. During the first four years of his reign, he fought his rebellious brother, <a href="Andrew_II_of_Hungary" title="wikilink">Andrew</a>, who forced Emeric to make him ruler of Croatia and Dalmatia as an <a href="appanage" class="uri" title="wikilink">appanage</a>.</p>
<p>Emeric cooperated with the <a href="Holy_See" title="wikilink">Holy See</a> against the <a href="Bosnia" title="wikilink">Bosnian</a> <a href="Bosnian_Church" title="wikilink">Patarenes</a>, whom the Catholic Church considered to be heretics. Taking advantage of a civil war, Emeric expanded his <a href="suzerainty" class="uri" title="wikilink">suzerainty</a> over <a href="Serbia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Serbia</a>. He failed to prevent the <a href="Republic_of_Venice" title="wikilink">Republic of Venice</a>, which was assisted by crusaders of the <a href="Fourth_Crusade" title="wikilink">Fourth Crusade</a>, from seizing <a href="Zadar" class="uri" title="wikilink">Zadar</a> in 1202. He also could not impede the rise of <a href="Second_Bulgarian_Empire" title="wikilink">Bulgaria</a> along the southern frontiers of his kingdom. Emeric was the first Hungarian monarch to use the &quot;<a href="&lt;U+00C1&gt;rp&lt;U+00E1&gt;d_stripes" title="wikilink">&lt;U+00C1&gt;rp&lt;U+00E1&gt;d stripes</a>&quot; as his personal coat of arms and to adopt the title of <a href="King_of_Serbia" title="wikilink">King of Serbia</a>. Before his death, Emeric had his four-year-old son, <a href="Ladislaus_III_of_Hungary" title="wikilink">Ladislaus III</a>, crowned king.</p>
<h2 id="early-life-1174u20131196">Early life (1174&lt;U+2013&gt;1196)</h2>
<p>Emeric was the eldest child of <a href="B&lt;U+00E9&gt;la_III_of_Hungary" title="wikilink">B&lt;U+00E9&gt;la III of Hungary</a> and B&lt;U+00E9&gt;la's first wife, <a href="Agnes_of_Antioch" title="wikilink">Agnes of Antioch</a>. His tutor was an Italian priest, <a href="Bernard,_Archbishop_of_Spalato" title="wikilink">Bernard</a>. <a href="Nicholas,_Archbishop_of_Esztergom" title="wikilink">Nicholas, Archbishop of Esztergom</a> crowned the eight-year-old Emeric king on 16 May 1182, which confirmed Emeric's right to succeed his father. Emeric was betrothed to a daughter of <a href="Frederick_I,_Holy_Roman_Emperor" title="wikilink">Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor</a>, but she died in 1184. B&lt;U+00E9&gt;la III appointed Emeric to administer <a href="Kingdom_of_Croatia_(1102&lt;U+2013&gt;1526)" title="wikilink">Croatia</a> and <a href="Dalmatia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Dalmatia</a> around 1195.</p>

<p>Emeric succeeded his father, who died on 23 April 1196. B&lt;U+00E9&gt;la III had bequeathed estates and money to Emeric's younger brother, <a href="Andrew_II_of_Hungary" title="wikilink">Andrew</a>, under the condition that Andrew should lead a crusade to the Holy Land. Instead, Andrew turned against Emeric, demanding a separate duchy for himself in 1197. <a href="Leopold_VI,_Duke_of_Austria" title="wikilink">Leopold VI, Duke of Austria</a>, intervened on behalf of Andrew, and at the end of the year, their combined forces routed Emeric's troops at <a href="Ma&lt;U+010D&gt;ki,_Slavonia" title="wikilink">Ma&lt;U+010D&gt;ki, Slavonia</a>. In early 1198, Emeric was forced to make Andrew Duke of Croatia and Dalmatia as an <a href="appanage" class="uri" title="wikilink">appanage</a>.</p>
<p>Andrew continued to conspire against Emeric, although <a href="Pope_Innocent_III" title="wikilink">Pope Innocent III</a> continued urging Andrew to launch a crusade. On 10 March 1199, Emeric forced <a href="Boleslaus,_Bishop_of_V&lt;U+00E1&gt;c" title="wikilink">Boleslaus, Bishop of V&lt;U+00E1&gt;c</a>, who was a supporter of Andrew, to give him documents that proved the conspiracy against him. In the summer of that year, Emeric defeated Andrew's army near <a href="Lake_Balaton" title="wikilink">Lake Balaton</a>, which made Andrew flee to <a href="Duchy_of_Austria" title="wikilink">Austria</a>. A <a href="papal_legate" title="wikilink">papal legate</a> named Gregory arrived in Hungary to mediate a reconciliation between the two brothers. According to the brothers' treaty, Emeric once again granted Croatia and Dalmatia to Andrew in the summer of 1200.</p>

<p>From around 1200, Emeric was deeply involved in the affairs of the <a href="Balkan_Peninsula" title="wikilink">Balkan Peninsula</a>. On 11 October 1200, Pope Innocent urged him to take measures to liquidate the <a href="Church_of_Bosnia" title="wikilink">&quot;heretics&quot; in Bosnia</a>. Upon Emeric's request, the Pope refused to send a royal crown to <a href="Stephen_Nemanji&lt;U+0107&gt;" title="wikilink">Stephen Nemanji&lt;U+0107&gt;</a>, <a href="Grand_Prince_of_Serbia" title="wikilink">Grand Prince of Serbia</a>. Emeric invaded Serbia in 1201 or 1202, and helped Stephen Nemanji&lt;U+0107&gt;'s brother, <a href="Vukan_Nemanji&lt;U+0107&gt;_of_Serbia" title="wikilink">Vukan</a> seize the throne. As a token of his <a href="suzerainty" class="uri" title="wikilink">suzerainty</a> over Serbia, Emeric became the first Hungarian monarch to adopt the title of <a href="King_of_Serbia" title="wikilink">King of Serbia</a> in 1202. He was also the first king to use a royal seal depicting the so-called &quot;<a href="&lt;U+00C1&gt;rp&lt;U+00E1&gt;d_stripes" title="wikilink">&lt;U+00C1&gt;rp&lt;U+00E1&gt;d stripes</a>&quot;, which eventually became part of the <a href="Coat_of_arms_of_Hungary" title="wikilink">Coat of arms of Hungary</a> in that year.</p>
<p>In the summer of 1202, <a href="Enrico_Dandolo" title="wikilink">Enrico Dandolo</a>, <a href="Doge_of_Venice" title="wikilink">Doge of Venice</a>, signed a treaty with the leaders of the <a href="Fourth_Crusade" title="wikilink">Fourth Crusade</a>, who agreed to help the Venetians recapture <a href="Zadar" class="uri" title="wikilink">Zadar</a>, a town in Dalmatia, which had accepted the Hungarian monarchs' suzerainty since 1186. Even though Pope Innocent III forbade the crusaders to besiege Zadar, <a href="Siege_of_Zara" title="wikilink">they seized the town</a> on 24 November and gave it to the Venetians. Although the Pope excommunicated the Venetians and the crusaders upon Emeric's demand, Zadar remained under Venetian rule.</p>
<p>In fear of a crusade by Emeric, <a href="Ban_Kulin" title="wikilink">Kulin</a>, <a href="Ban_of_Bosnia" title="wikilink">Ban of Bosnia</a>, held a synod of the <a href="Church_of_Bosnia" title="wikilink">Church of Bosnia</a> at <a href="Zenica" title="wikilink">Bilino Polje</a> on 6 April 1203. The synod acknowledged <a href="papal_primacy" title="wikilink">papal primacy</a> and ordered the reform of the rites. Ban Kulin also acknowledged Emeric's suzerainty. In a letter written in 1203, <a href="Kaloyan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kaloyan</a>, <a href="Tzar_of_Bulgaria" title="wikilink">Tzar of Bulgaria</a>, informed Pope Innocent that Emeric had occupied five districts in <a href="Second_Bulgarian_Empire" title="wikilink">Bulgaria</a>, and Kaloyan demanded the Pope's intervention.</p>
<h3 id="last-years-1203u20131204">Last years (1203&lt;U+2013&gt;1204)</h3>
<p>Duke Andrew once again rose up in open rebellion against Emeric in the autumn of 1203. Their armies met at Vara&lt;U+017E&gt;din on the river <a href="Dr&lt;U+00E1&gt;va" class="uri" title="wikilink">Dr&lt;U+00E1&gt;va</a> in October. Emeric walked into his brother's camp unarmed, stating, &quot;Now I shall see who will dare to raise a hand to shed the blood of the royal lineage!&quot;,<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> according to the nearly contemporaneous <a href="Thomas_the_Archdeacon" title="wikilink">Thomas the Archdeacon</a>. Nobody ventured to stop the king; thus, he approached Andrew and seized him without resistance. Duke Andrew was held in captivity for months, but his supporters released him in early 1204.</p>
<p>Taking advantage of the civil war in Hungary, Kaloyan invaded and captured <a href="Belgrade" class="uri" title="wikilink">Belgrade</a>, <a href="Brani&lt;U+010D&gt;evo_(Golubac)" title="wikilink">Barancs</a> (now Brani&lt;U+010D&gt;evo in Serbia), and other fortresses. Emeric made preparations for a campaign against Bulgaria, but he disbanded his army upon Pope Innocent's demand. The Pope, who had been negotiating a <a href="church_union" title="wikilink">church union</a> with Kaloyan, sent a royal crown to him, but Emeric imprisoned the papal legate who was delivering the crown to Bulgaria when the legate was passing through Hungary.</p>
<p>Having fallen seriously ill, Emeric had his four-year-old son, <a href="Ladislaus_III_of_Hungary" title="wikilink">Ladislaus</a>, crowned king on 26 August 1204. He also released the papal legate. He reconciled with his brother, &quot;entrusting to him the guardianship of his son and the administration of the entire kingdom until the ward should reach the age of majority&quot;,<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> according to Thomas the Archdeacon. Emeric died on 30 November, according to the <em><a href="Illuminated_Chronicle" title="wikilink">Illuminated Chronicle</a></em>. Emeric was buried in the cathedral of <a href="Eger" class="uri" title="wikilink">Eger</a>.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>

<p>Emeric's wife, <a href="Constance_of_Aragon,_Holy_Roman_Empress" title="wikilink">Constance</a>, was the daughter of King <a href="Alfonso_II_of_Aragon" title="wikilink">Alfonso II of Aragon</a>. Their marriage took place between 1196 and 1200. Their only known child, Ladislaus, was born around 1200 and died on 7 May 1205. Queen Constance, who outlived both her husband and their son, eventually became the first wife of the future <a href="Frederick_II,_Holy_Roman_Emperor" title="wikilink">Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor</a>.</p>
