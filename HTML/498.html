<p>Watts was born in <a href="Eufaula,_Oklahoma" title="wikilink">Eufaula, Oklahoma</a>. After graduating from high school in <a href="1976" class="uri" title="wikilink">1976</a>, Watts was recruited by and attended college at the <a href="University_of_Oklahoma" title="wikilink">University of Oklahoma</a>. Chosen to play the <a href="quarterback" class="uri" title="wikilink">quarterback</a> position, Watts led the OU Sooners college football team to consecutive <a href="Big_Eight_Conference" title="wikilink">Big Eight Conference</a> titles and <a href="Orange_Bowl_(game)" title="wikilink">Orange Bowl</a> championships under the leadership of head coach <a href="Barry_Switzer" title="wikilink">Barry Switzer</a>.

<p>Between <a href="1981" class="uri" title="wikilink">1981</a> to <a href="1986" class="uri" title="wikilink">1986</a>, Watts played professional football in the <a href="Canadian_Football_League" title="wikilink">Canadian Football League</a> for the <a href="Ottawa_Rough_Riders" title="wikilink">Ottawa Rough Riders</a>, receiving the <a href="Grey_Cup_Most_Valuable_Player" title="wikilink">Grey Cup Most Valuable Player</a> award during his <a href="rookie" class="uri" title="wikilink">rookie</a> season in a Grey Cup loss to <a href="Warren_Moon" title="wikilink">Warren Moon</a> and the <a href="Edmonton_Eskimos" title="wikilink">Edmonton Eskimos</a>. Watts continued to play the quarterback position (which had brought him success at OU). After his retirement, Watts was replaced ultimately, several years later, by <a href="Damon_Allen" title="wikilink">Damon Allen</a> as quarterback for the eastern Riders.

Watts served as a Southern Baptist youth <a href="Religious_minister" title="wikilink">minister</a> and <a href="pastor" title="wikilink">associate pastor</a> in <a href="Del_City,_Oklahoma" title="wikilink">Del City, Oklahoma</a> from <a href="1987" class="uri" title="wikilink">1987</a> to <a href="1994" class="uri" title="wikilink">1994</a>.</p>
<h2 id="political-career">Political career</h2>
<p>Watts was approached by several prominent <a href="Oklahoma_Republican_Party" title="wikilink">Oklahoma Republicans</a> and asked to run for a seat on the <a href="Oklahoma_Corporation_Commission" title="wikilink">Oklahoma Corporation Commission</a>. After defeating several other candidates in the state Republican primary, Watts won in <a href="November" class="uri" title="wikilink">November</a>, <a href="1990" class="uri" title="wikilink">1990</a>, and was the first <a href="African-American" class="uri" title="wikilink">African-American</a> elected to statewide office in Oklahoma. Many Oklahoma African-Americans who would have probably voted for the <a href="Democratic_party_(United_States)" title="wikilink">Democratic</a> candidate instead crossed over to vote for Watts (helping him to win).</p>
<p>Four years later, Watts was again approached by prominent Oklahoma Republican leaders and asked to consider running for an open seat for <a href="United_States_Congress" title="wikilink">Congress</a> (Oklahoma's 4th Congressional district, being vacated by Congressman <a href="Dave_McCurdy" title="wikilink">Dave McCurdy</a>). Watts agreed and in November, <a href="1994" class="uri" title="wikilink">1994</a>, was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives. He garnered attention soon after his election by declining to join the <a href="Congressional_Black_Caucus" title="wikilink">Congressional Black Caucus</a>, saying it was &quot;infested&quot; with &quot;Democratic liberals who betray black people in America.&quot;</p>
<p>Watts captured national attention in <a href="1996" class="uri" title="wikilink">1996</a> with a speech before the Republican national convention, when he said, &quot;You see character does count. For too long we have gotten by in a society that says the only thing right is to get by and the only thing wrong is to get caught. Character is doing what's right when nobody is looking. &quot; <a href="http://www.northerncityjournal.com/files/vol01_26.html">1</a></p>
<p>Continuing to be a rising star for the national Republican Party, Watts was selected in <a href="1997" class="uri" title="wikilink">1997</a> to deliver the Republican response to <a href="President_of_the_United_States" title="wikilink">President</a> <a href="Bill_Clinton" title="wikilink">Bill Clinton</a>'s <a href="State_of_the_Union_Address" title="wikilink">State of the Union Address</a>. Later that year, Watts stirred up <a href="controversy" class="uri" title="wikilink">controversy</a> when he branded some unnamed black Democrats and <a href="civil_rights" title="wikilink">civil rights</a> leaders as &quot;race-hustling poverty pimps.&quot; <a href="http://www.alternet.org/story.html?StoryID=13545">2</a>.</p>
<p>In <a href="1998" class="uri" title="wikilink">1998</a>, Watts was chosen by the Republican House Leadership to be the <a href="chairman" class="uri" title="wikilink">chairman</a> of the <a href="House_Republican_Conference" title="wikilink">House Republican Conference</a>, the 4th highest position of leadership in the House of Representatives (behind the <a href="Speaker_of_the_U.S._House_of_Representatives" title="wikilink">Speaker</a>, the <a href="Majority_Leader_of_the_U.S._House_of_Representatives" title="wikilink">Majority Leader</a>, and the <a href="Majority_Whip_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives" title="wikilink">Majority Whip</a>).</p>
<p>Although elected on a pledge to serve no more than two terms, Watts sought and won a fourth term in <a href="2000" class="uri" title="wikilink">2000</a>. In <a href="2002" class="uri" title="wikilink">2002</a> he decided not to run for re-election, publicly citing a desire to spend more time with his family.</p>
<p>Watts then became chaiman of <a href="GOPAC" class="uri" title="wikilink">GOPAC</a> <a href="http://www.gopac.com/gopac_about.php">3</a> until he was succeeded <a href="February_1," title="wikilink">February 1,</a> <a href="2007" class="uri" title="wikilink">2007</a> by <a href="Maryland" class="uri" title="wikilink">Maryland</a>'s former Lt.

GOPAC was founded by <a href="Delaware" class="uri" title="wikilink">Delaware</a> Governor <a href="Pierre_S._du_Pont" title="wikilink">Pierre S. du Pont</a> in 1978 in &quot;an effort to build a farm team of Republican officeholders who could then run for congress or higher state offices later.&quot; <a href="http://www.gopac.com/gopac_chairmans_corner.php">5</a>.
