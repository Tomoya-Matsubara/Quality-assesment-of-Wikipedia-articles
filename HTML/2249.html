<p><strong>JC's Girls</strong> (short for <strong>Jesus Christ's Girls</strong>, also called the <strong>JC's Girls Girls Girls Ministry</strong>) is an American <a href="Evangelicalism" title="wikilink">evangelical</a> organization of <a href="Christian" class="uri" title="wikilink">Christian</a> women who <a href="Evangelism" title="wikilink">evangelize</a> to female workers in the <a href="sex_industry" title="wikilink">sex industry</a>. The organization supports women wishing to leave the industry, but does not try to persuade them to do so. The group does not focus upon <a href="Conversion_to_Christianity" title="wikilink">conversion</a> but on communicating its message that Christians exist who are not judging female sex workers and are willing to accept them. The organization also helps people seeking to overcome <a href="pornography_addiction" title="wikilink">pornography addiction</a>.</p>
<p>The organization was founded by <a href="Heather_Veitch" title="wikilink">Heather Veitch</a>, who worked as a <a href="stripper" class="uri" title="wikilink">stripper</a> for four years before converting to Christianity in 1999 and eventually leaving the sex industry. She founded JC's Girls on <a href="Good_Friday" title="wikilink">Good Friday</a> in March 2005; it was based at <a href="Sandals_Church" title="wikilink">Sandals Church</a> in <a href="Riverside,_California" title="wikilink">Riverside, California</a> with the support of the <a href="California_Southern_Baptist_Convention" title="wikilink">California Southern Baptist Convention</a>. In January 2006, JC's Girls went to <a href="Las_Vegas_Valley" title="wikilink">Las Vegas</a> to operate a booth at the <a href="AVN_Adult_Entertainment_Expo" title="wikilink">AVN Adult Entertainment Expo</a> that received much traffic and news coverage. Veitch eventually moved to Las Vegas and based the organization at <a href="Central_Christian_Church_(Henderson,_Nevada)" title="wikilink">Central Christian Church</a> in nearby <a href="Henderson,_Nevada" title="wikilink">Henderson, Nevada</a>. Former stripper and <a href="call_girl" title="wikilink">call girl</a> Theresa Scher and social worker Sheri Brown founded the <a href="San_Diego" title="wikilink">San Diego</a> chapter of JC's Girls at <a href="The_Rock_Church_(San_Diego)" title="wikilink">The Rock Church</a> in 2007. Veitch and Scher resigned from JC's Girls in 2011 and 2012 respectively, leaving the leadership of the organization to Brown. As of 2014, the sole chapter of JC's Girls is in San Diego.</p>
<p>When JC's Girls was first founded, <a href="pornographic_film" title="wikilink">pornographic film</a> director James DiGiorgio took glamour photographs of three JC's Girls members for the organization's original website without asking for payment. DiGiorgio was not a Christian, but said that he was helping JC's Girls because the sex industry is &quot;always trying to preach freedom of speech [so] anyone in this industry who has a problem with [JC's Girls'] message is a fucking hypocrite.&quot;<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> Reverend Ray Turner of Temple Missionary Baptist Church criticized JC's Girls for not explicitly encouraging women in the sex industry to quit. In response, Veitch said, &quot;Do we ask gluttons to stop eating too much before they come to church?&quot;<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> Philip Sherwell of the <em><a href="Calgary_Herald" title="wikilink">Calgary Herald</a></em> called the evangelism of JC's Girls &quot;America's most unusual Christian outreach operation&quot;.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>

<p>On <a href="Good_Friday" title="wikilink">Good Friday</a> in March 2005, Veitch, Albee and six other women went to a strip club and paid for <a href="lap_dance" title="wikilink">lap dances</a>. Instead of accepting the dances, they talked with the strippers, telling them that they were loved and accepted by God, that churches were composed entirely of sinners, and that they would be welcome there.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> One of the lap dancers cried and told Albee she had often wanted to go to a church but had never done so because she had thought that she would be rejected.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> Albee offered the woman a prayer and she eagerly accepted and hugged Albee.

<p>Veitch became the head of JC's Girls and the 17,000-member Sandals Church became the organization's base of operations.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> The church is part of the <a href="California_Southern_Baptist_Convention" title="wikilink">California Southern Baptist Convention</a>, which supports JC's Girls.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> The church gave JC's Girls a $10,000 budget in its first year.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> The organization's members continued visiting strip clubs across California, paying for private dances, and then evangelizing the strippers instead of receiving the dances. Within six months of its founding, the organization's members had persuaded several strippers to start attending a church and were only once asked to stop. By December 2005, Veitch, Albee, and teacher Tanya Huerter had become the organization's leaders.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a> Huerter, who also had no experience with the sex industry, said, &quot;I have a heart for these girls.

The article prompted additional media coverage from other newspapers, television programs, and radio stations. Veitch began dividing her time between managing JC's Girls, appearing in the media, and serving as a caregiver for her <a href="Terminal_illness" title="wikilink">terminally-ill</a> husband.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a> She said that working with JC's Girls helped keep her mind off of her husband's <a href="Brain_tumor" title="wikilink">brain cancer</a>.<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a></p>
<p>In January 2006,<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a> JC's Girls went to Las Vegas to operate a booth at the <a href="AVN_Adult_Entertainment_Expo" title="wikilink">AVN Adult Entertainment Expo</a><a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a>the largest trade fair for <a href="pornography_in_the_United_States" title="wikilink">pornography in the United States</a>.<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a> The booth was decorated to look like one of the booths advertising strip clubs. The women at the booth wore sleeveless shirts with the organization's name in sequins. When men attending the convention visited the booth thinking that JC's Girls was a strip club, the women asked them to guess what &quot;JC&quot; meant and gave attendees a sticker that said, &quot;I've been booby-trapped by JC's Girls.&quot;<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a> At the convention, JC's Girls distributed more than 200 Bibles wrapped in t-shirts reading &quot;Holy Hottie&quot;.<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a> They also distributed DVDs of a sermon by Brown about pornography addiction.<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a> The booth became very popular; many convention attendees wished to take pictures with the JC's Girls volunteers. Veitch was interviewed for a variety of media, including a <a href="CNN" class="uri" title="wikilink">CNN</a> news broadcast and a documentary film by <a href="Bill_Day_(filmmaker)" title="wikilink">Bill Day</a>, who had previously made the film <em>Missionary Positions</em> about <a href="XXXchurch.com" class="uri" title="wikilink">XXXchurch.com</a>, another Christian organization that was operating a booth at the trade fair.<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a> By the end of the convention, the JC's Girls booth had received visits from thousands of men who heard about the gospel there.<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a></p>
<p>Also in January 2006, Brown approved a $50,000 budget for JC's Girls for the year. By April, seven strippers had attended Sandals Church because of JC's Girls and various strippers across the United States had contacted the organization looking for local churches to attend. Within a year of founding JC's Girls, Veitch had lost 25 pounds and become more physically fit to show that the organization's message is not motivated by jealousy.<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a> She said, &quot;I want them to know that if I wanted to, I could be a stripper again, but I choose to live my life for the Lord.&quot;<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a></p>

<p>Based on Veitch's work with Celebrate Community Church, JC's Girls started a program called &quot;One Church for One Girl&quot;, which encourages churches to help women to leave the sex industry once the women have expressed an interest in doing so.<a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a> In July 2011, Veitch resigned from JC's Girls so she could spend more time with her family.<a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a></p>

<p>In San Diego, Theresa Scher, a former stripper and call girl, was looking for a way out of the sex industry when she watched a CNN interview with Albee about her work with JC's Girls in Riverside. Scher contacted Albee, who allowed Scher to establish a new chapter of JC's Girls in San Diego. Sher founded the chapter in 2007<a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a> with Sheri Brown, a former social worker.<a href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a> Brown had previously hated strippers, but, once she had accepted a job helping <a href="Teenage_pregnancy#Mother" title="wikilink">teenage mothers</a> finish <a href="high_school" title="wikilink">high school</a> and the first four teens she worked with were strippers, she said that she developed &quot;an overwhelming passion to reach out to these precious women in love and without condemnation.&quot; She had been <a href="Sexual_abuse" title="wikilink">sexually abused</a> when she was a child and she had also been a teenage mother; Brown found that both of these experiences helped her to relate to strippers, as many of the strippers she encountered also had those experiences.<a href="#fn67" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a> The San Diego chapter of JC's Girls is based at <a href="The_Rock_Church_(San_Diego)" title="wikilink">The Rock Church</a>, a 10,000-member church with a majority of members under the age of 30. In the first year, several strippers left the sex industry and began volunteering with the chapter. Many of the chapter's members do not personally visit strip clubs but help in other ways. Scher said the former strippers were the most effective JC's Girls volunteers because they understand from personal experience the situations of the women they are trying to help.<a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a> Twice each month, members of the San Diego chapter of JC's Girls visit strip clubs.<a href="#fn69" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref69"><sup>69</sup></a> They pray before, during, and after each visit and a prayer team prays for them while they are out.<a href="#fn70" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a></p>

Let the Holy Spirit draw them out.&quot;<a href="#fn82" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref82"><sup>82</sup></a> Brown and Donewald also visited the strip club and spoke with the strippers, two of whom converted to Christianity while continuing to work at the club.<a href="#fn83" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref83"><sup>83</sup></a> The peace treaty received much publicity, but the church's members resumed picketing once Brown had returned to San Diego,<a href="#fn84" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref84"><sup>84</sup></a> and George and his club's strippers returned to their counter-protesting.<a href="#fn85" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref85"><sup>85</sup></a></p>
<p>By 2011, several of the strippers JC's Girls members had spoken with in San Diego had begun attending a Bible study hosted by the organization and the chapter had helped one stripper become a Christian, leave the sex industry, and gain unrelated employment. In March 2011, the chapter sent a delegation to <a href="Adultcon" class="uri" title="wikilink">Adultcon</a> at the <a href="Los_Angeles_Convention_Center" title="wikilink">Los Angeles Convention Center</a>, where Scher and Brown spoke with conference attendees and offered them prayer.<a href="#fn86" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref86"><sup>86</sup></a> That July, Veitch left the organization and handed the leadership to Sher and Brown. In June 2012,<a href="#fn87" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref87"><sup>87</sup></a> Sher gave up her co-leadership of the organization to focus on her family, leaving the leadership to Brown.<a href="#fn88" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref88"><sup>88</sup></a> By 2013, the organization had established guidelines regulating the transition of women from the sex industry into participation in the evangelistic activities of JC's Girls. The woman must consistently attend a <a href="Bible_study_(Christian)" title="wikilink">Bible study</a> for four months, read <a href="Francine_Rivers" title="wikilink">Francine Rivers</a>' book <em><a href="Redeeming_Love" title="wikilink">Redeeming Love</a></em>, and be interviewed by the chapter's leaders, who then decide whether the woman should join the organization's outreach team. These guidelines were established because some women who had quickly gone from working in the sex industry to evangelizing with JC's Girls soon left the organization and returned to the sex industry.<a href="#fn89" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref89"><sup>89</sup></a></p>

<p>Within the first few months of founding JC's Girls, Veitch and Albee launched the organization's first official website, which initially received little traffic.<a href="#fn90" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref90"><sup>90</sup></a> Three months later, it had received 40,000 hits.<a href="#fn91" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref91"><sup>91</sup></a> By December 2005, the organization had received messages through its website from pornographic film actors and men with pornography addiction who said that JC's Girls had changed their lives.<a href="#fn92" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref92"><sup>92</sup></a> Without asking for payment,<a href="#fn93" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref93"><sup>93</sup></a> Veitch's friend,<a href="#fn94" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref94"><sup>94</sup></a> pornographic film director James DiGiorgio, took glamour photographs<a href="#fn95" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref95"><sup>95</sup></a> of Veitch, Albee, and Huerter<a href="#fn96" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref96"><sup>96</sup></a> for the JC's Girls website.

<h2 id="reception">Reception</h2>
<p>When JC's Girls first started receiving funds from Sandals Church, some of the church's members were displeased that their <a href="Alms#Christianity" title="wikilink">tithes and offerings</a> were going towards lap dances. Brown said that funding the activities of JC's Girls was worthwhile because the sex industry &quot;has been largely ignored by the evangelical church&quot; and the budget allotted to JC's Girls is small compared to the money made by the sex industry.<a href="#fn102" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref102"><sup>102</sup></a> Sandals Church members were also concerned that ministering to strippers would be ineffective. Brown responded by appealing to Veitch's conversion, suggesting that other strippers could have similar experiences.<a href="#fn103" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref103"><sup>103</sup></a> Because of this controversy, Brown nearly lost his church facility on the <a href="California_Baptist_University" title="wikilink">California Baptist University</a> campus, but the church united in support of JC's Girls and the church's location remained unchanged.<a href="#fn104" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref104"><sup>104</sup></a> Terry Barone, spokesman of the California Southern Baptist Convention, said that JC's Girls members &quot;are doing what Jesus did ... He ministered to prostitutes and tax collectors.&quot; Barone said that members of the convention might find viewing the JC's Girls website awkward, but that it was not intended for them.<a href="#fn105" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref105"><sup>105</sup></a> Stephen Clark of the <em><a href="Los_Angeles_Times" title="wikilink">Los Angeles Times</a></em> called it &quot;an edgy website [with] provocative appeals.&quot;<a href="#fn106" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref106"><sup>106</sup></a></p>

<p>In its first year, JC's Girls was criticized for asking DiGiorgio to take glamour photographs<a href="#fn107" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref107"><sup>107</sup></a> of Veitch, Albee, and Huerter<a href="#fn108" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref108"><sup>108</sup></a> for their website. Veitch responded to this criticism by saying, &quot;it is not a sin to be attractive or dress cute,&quot; and that the photographs were intended to persuade women in the sex industry to dismiss the idea that Christianity is about &quot;being locked up in a house with a Bible.&quot;<a href="#fn109" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref109"><sup>109</sup></a> DiGiorgio said that JC's Girls is correct in believing that many women in the sex industry need to be rescued from self-destructive behavior, but he did not think that encouraging the women to become Christians would necessarily be helpful.<a href="#fn110" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref110"><sup>110</sup></a> At the end of 2005, Veitch said that she had expected that someone would have shouted at JC's Girls members or ejected them from a strip club at some point, but no one had.<a href="#fn111" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref111"><sup>111</sup></a> In 2006, Reverend Ray Turner of Temple Missionary Baptist Church criticized JC's Girls for not explicitly encouraging women in the sex industry to quit.<a href="#fn112" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref112"><sup>112</sup></a> He said, &quot;How can you stay in the industry and have a relationship with God?&quot;<a href="#fn113" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref113"><sup>113</sup></a> In response, Veitch said, &quot;Do we ask gluttons to stop eating too much before they come to church?&quot;<a href="#fn114" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref114"><sup>114</sup></a> At the 2006 AVN Adult Entertainment Expo, photographer Michael Grecco photographed Veitch, Albee, and Huerter and included the image in his 2007 book <em><a href="Naked_Ambition:_An_R_Rated_Look_at_an_X_Rated_Industry" title="wikilink">Naked Ambition: An R Rated Look at an X Rated Industry</a></em>. In the image caption, he called the trio a &quot;devout Christian trinity&quot;.<a href="#fn115" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref115"><sup>115</sup></a> Philip Sherwell of the <em><a href="Calgary_Herald" title="wikilink">Calgary Herald</a></em> called the organization's evangelism &quot;America's most unusual Christian outreach operation&quot;.<a href="#fn116" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref116"><sup>116</sup></a></p>
<p>Pat Sherman of <em>Pacific San Diego Magazine</em> said that the members of the San Diego chapter of JC's Girls &quot;have the looks to land jobs working the pole.&quot;<a href="#fn117" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref117"><sup>117</sup></a> Documentary filmmaker Bill Daly said that JC's Girls are like <em><a href="Charlie&#39;s_Angels" title="wikilink">Charlie's Angels</a></em>, but in real life. He said that members of the organization are &quot;fighting false glamour with real spiritual beauty.&quot;<a href="#fn118" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref118"><sup>118</sup></a> In his book <em>Evangelicals and the Arts in Fiction</em>, John Weaver writes that science fiction writer <a href="Robert_A._Heinlein" title="wikilink">Robert A. Heinlein</a> conceived of evangelicals as being sexually repressed, but would eventually undergo a <a href="sexual_revolution" title="wikilink">sexual revolution</a>. Weaver offers JC's Girls and XXXchurch.com as evidence that Heinlein's prediction would be fulfilled.<a href="#fn119" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref119"><sup>119</sup></a> Adherents of <a href="UFO_religion" title="wikilink">UFO religion</a> <a href="Ra&lt;U+00EB&gt;lism" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ra&lt;U+00EB&gt;lism</a> founded an organization called &quot;Ra&lt;U+00EB&gt;l's Girls&quot; in reaction against the practices of JC's Girls in the same way that Ra&lt;U+00EB&gt;lians founded <a href="Clitoraid" class="uri" title="wikilink">Clitoraid</a> in reaction against the practice of <a href="female_genital_mutilation" title="wikilink">female genital mutilation</a>. Like JC's Girls, Ra&lt;U+00EB&gt;l's Girls is an organization of women who engage with female sex workers and their clients. The two organizations differ primarily in their message; Ra&lt;U+00EB&gt;lians hold that sexual pleasure is intrinsically valuable, so members of Ra&lt;U+00EB&gt;l's Girls teach women in the sex industry how to maximize their own sexual pleasure while servicing clients.<a href="#fn120" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref120"><sup>120</sup></a> A journalist for <em><a href="The_Observer" title="wikilink">The Observer</a></em> compared JC's Girls to XXXchurch.com, writing that both of &quot;these ministries are in some way reforming the church as well as their would-be followers.&quot;<a href="#fn121" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref121"><sup>121</sup></a></p>
