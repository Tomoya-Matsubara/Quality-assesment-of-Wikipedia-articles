<p><strong>Mikhail Alexandrovich Bakunin</strong> (;  &lt;U+2013&gt; 1 July 1876) was a <a href="Russia" title="wikilink">Russian</a> <a href="revolutionary" class="uri" title="wikilink">revolutionary</a>, philosopher, and theorist of <a href="collectivist_anarchism" title="wikilink">collectivist anarchism</a>. He has also often been called the father of <a href="anarchist" class="uri" title="wikilink">anarchist</a> theory in general.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> Bakunin grew up in Premukhino, a family estate near Moscow, where he moved to study philosophy and began to read the French <a href="encyclop&lt;U+00E9&gt;distes" class="uri" title="wikilink">encyclop&lt;U+00E9&gt;distes</a>, leading to enthusiasm for the philosophy of <a href="Fichte" class="uri" title="wikilink">Fichte</a>. From Fichte, Bakunin went on to immerse himself in the works of <a href="Hegel" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hegel</a>, the most influential thinker among German intellectuals at the time. That led to his wholehearted embrace of Hegelianism, as he became bedazzled by Hegel's famous maxim; &quot;Everything that exists is rational&quot;. In 1840 Bakunin traveled to <a href="St._Petersburg" title="wikilink">St. Petersburg</a> and <a href="Berlin" class="uri" title="wikilink">Berlin</a>, preparing himself for a professorship in philosophy or history at the <a href="University_of_Moscow" title="wikilink">University of Moscow</a>.</p>
<p>Bakunin moved from <a href="Berlin" class="uri" title="wikilink">Berlin</a>, in 1842, to <a href="Dresden" class="uri" title="wikilink">Dresden</a>. Eventually he arrived in <a href="Paris" class="uri" title="wikilink">Paris</a>, where he met <a href="George_Sand" title="wikilink">George Sand</a>, <a href="Pierre-Joseph_Proudhon" title="wikilink">Pierre-Joseph Proudhon</a> and <a href="Karl_Marx" title="wikilink">Karl Marx</a>. He was eventually deported from France for speaking against Russia's oppression of <a href="Poland" class="uri" title="wikilink">Poland</a>. In 1849 he was apprehended in Dresden for his participation in the <a href="Revolutions_of_1848" title="wikilink">Czech rebellion of 1848</a>. He was turned over to Russia where he was imprisoned in <a href="Peter_and_Paul_Fortress" title="wikilink">Peter-Paul Fortress</a> in <a href="Saint_Petersburg" title="wikilink">Saint Petersburg</a>. He remained there until 1857, when he was <a href="exile" title="wikilink">exiled</a> to a work camp in <a href="Siberia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Siberia</a>. Escaping to <a href="Japan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Japan</a>, the <a href="USA" class="uri" title="wikilink">USA</a> and finally ending up in <a href="London" class="uri" title="wikilink">London</a> for a short time, he worked with Herzen on the journal <em>Kolokol</em> (&quot;<em>The Bell</em>&quot;). In 1863, he left to join the <a href="January_Uprising" title="wikilink">insurrection in Poland</a>, but he failed to reach his destination and spent some time in <a href="Switzerland" class="uri" title="wikilink">Switzerland</a> and <a href="Italy" class="uri" title="wikilink">Italy</a>. Despite his criminal status, Bakunin gained great influence with the youth in Russia, and all of Europe. In 1870, he was involved in the insurrection in <a href="Lyon" class="uri" title="wikilink">Lyon</a>, which foreshadowed the <a href="Paris_Commune" title="wikilink">Paris Commune</a>.</p>
<p>In 1868, Bakunin joined the <a href="International_Working_Men&#39;s_Association" title="wikilink">International Working Men's Association</a>, a federation of <a href="trade_union" title="wikilink">trade union</a> organizations with sections in most European countries. The 1872 <a href="Hague_Congress_(1872)" title="wikilink">Hague Congress</a> was dominated by a struggle between Marx and his followers who argued for parliamentary electoral participation and a faction around Bakunin who opposed it. Bakunin's faction lost the vote, and he was eventually expelled for supposedly maintaining a secret organisation within the international. The anarchists insisted the congress was rigged, and so held their own conference of the International at Saint-Imier in Switzerland in 1872. From 1870 to 1876, he wrote much of his seminal work such as <em><a href="Statism_and_Anarchy" title="wikilink">Statism and Anarchy</a></em> and <em><a href="God_and_the_State" title="wikilink">God and the State</a></em>. Despite his declining health, he tried to take part in an insurrection in <a href="Bologna" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bologna</a>, but was forced to return to Switzerland in disguise, and settled in <a href="Lugano" class="uri" title="wikilink">Lugano</a>. He remained active in the worker's movement of Europe until further health problems caused him to be moved to a hospital in <a href="Bern" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bern</a>, where he died in 1876.</p>

<p>In the spring of 1814, Mikhail Alexandrovich Bakunin &quot;was born to a noble family of only modest means&quot;,<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> the family owned only 500 serfs,<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> in the village of <a href="Pryamukhino" class="uri" title="wikilink">Pryamukhino</a> (&lt;U+041F&gt;&lt;U+0440&gt;&lt;U+044F&gt;&lt;U+043C&gt;&lt;U+0443&gt;&lt;U+0445&gt;&lt;U+0438&gt;&lt;U+043D&gt;&lt;U+043E&gt;) between <a href="Torzhok" class="uri" title="wikilink">Torzhok</a> (&lt;U+0422&gt;&lt;U+043E&gt;&lt;U+0440&gt;&lt;U+0436&gt;&lt;U+043E&gt;&lt;U+043A&gt;) and <a href="Kuvshinovo" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kuvshinovo</a> (&lt;U+041A&gt;&lt;U+0443&gt;&lt;U+0432&gt;&lt;U+0448&gt;&lt;U+0438&gt;&lt;U+043D&gt;&lt;U+043E&gt;&lt;U+0432&gt;&lt;U+043E&gt;), in <a href="Tver" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tver</a> <a href="guberniya" class="uri" title="wikilink">guberniya</a>, northwest of <a href="Moscow" class="uri" title="wikilink">Moscow</a>. His father was a career diplomat who, as a young attache, had lived for years in <a href="Florence" class="uri" title="wikilink">Florence</a> and <a href="Naples" class="uri" title="wikilink">Naples</a>. Upon his return to Russia, he settled down on his paternal estate where at the age of forty, he married an eighteen-year-old girl from the prominent <a href="Muraviev" class="uri" title="wikilink">Muraviev</a> family. Given to liberal ideas, he was for a while platonically involved with one of the <a href="Decembrist" class="uri" title="wikilink">Decembrist</a> clubs. After <a href="Nicolas_I" title="wikilink">Nicolas I</a> became Tsar, however, Bakunin senior gave up politics and devoted himself to the care of his estate and the education of his children, five girls and five boys, the oldest of whom was Mikhail (Michael).</p>
<p>At the age of 14 Michael left for <a href="Saint_Petersburg" title="wikilink">Saint Petersburg</a>, receiving military training at the Artillery University, &quot;a rigid, anti-Western military school, where he chafed at the arbitrary discipline and the narrow curriculum&lt;U+2014&gt;much less encompassing than the homeschooling he had experienced before.&quot;<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> He was &quot;expelled from school in 1834 for poor grades and assigned to barracks on the Polish frontier.&quot;<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> He was commissioned a junior officer in the <a href="Russian_Imperial_Guard" title="wikilink">Russian Imperial Guard</a> and sent to <a href="Minsk" class="uri" title="wikilink">Minsk</a> and <a href="Hrodna" title="wikilink">Gardinas</a> in <a href="Lithuania" class="uri" title="wikilink">Lithuania</a> (now <a href="Belarus" class="uri" title="wikilink">Belarus</a>). That summer, Bakunin became embroiled in a family row, taking his sister&lt;U+2019&gt;s side in rebellion to an unhappy marriage. Though his father wished him to continue in either the military or the civil service, Bakunin abandoned both in 1835, and made his way to Moscow, hoping to study <a href="philosophy" class="uri" title="wikilink">philosophy</a>.</p>
<h3 id="interest-in-philosophy">Interest in philosophy</h3>
<p>In Moscow, Bakunin soon became friends with a group of former university students, and engaged in the systematic study of <a href="Idealist" class="uri" title="wikilink">Idealist</a> philosophy, grouped around the poet <a href="Nikolay_Stankevich" title="wikilink">Nikolay Stankevich</a>, <em>&lt;U+201C&gt;the bold pioneer who opened to Russian thought the vast and fertile continent of German metaphysics&lt;U+201D&gt;</em> (<a href="E._H._Carr" title="wikilink">E. H. Carr</a>). The philosophy of <a href="Kant" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kant</a> initially was central to their study, but then progressed to <a href="Friedrich_Wilhelm_Joseph_Schelling" title="wikilink">Schelling</a>, <a href="Fichte" class="uri" title="wikilink">Fichte</a>, and <a href="Hegel" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hegel</a>. By autumn of 1835, Bakunin had conceived of forming a philosophical circle in his home town of Pryamukhino; a passionate environment for the young people involved. For example, <a href="Vissarion_Belinsky" title="wikilink">Vissarion Belinsky</a> fell in love with one of Bakunin&lt;U+2019&gt;s sisters. Moreover, by early 1836, Bakunin was back in Moscow, where he published translations of Fichte&lt;U+2019&gt;s <em>Some Lectures Concerning the Scholar's Vocation</em> and <em>The Way to a Blessed Life</em>, which became his favorite book. With Stankevich he also read <a href="Goethe" class="uri" title="wikilink">Goethe</a>, <a href="Schiller" class="uri" title="wikilink">Schiller</a>, and <a href="E.T.A._Hoffmann" title="wikilink">E.T.A. Hoffmann</a>.</p>
<p>He became increasingly influenced by <a href="Hegel" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hegel</a> and provided the first <a href="Russian_language" title="wikilink">Russian</a> translation of his work. During this period he met <a href="slavophile" class="uri" title="wikilink">slavophile</a> <a href="Konstantin_Aksakov" title="wikilink">Konstantin Aksakov</a>, <a href="Pyotr_Chaadayev" title="wikilink">Piotr Tschaadaev</a> and the socialists <a href="Alexander_Herzen" title="wikilink">Alexander Herzen</a> and <a href="Nikolay_Ogarev" title="wikilink">Nikolay Ogarev</a>. In this period he began to develop his <a href="pan-slavism" title="wikilink">panslavic</a> views. After long wrangles with his father, Bakunin went to <a href="Berlin" class="uri" title="wikilink">Berlin</a> in 1840. His stated plan at the time was still to become a university professor (a &lt;U+201C&gt;priest of truth,&lt;U+201D&gt; as he and his friends imagined it), but he soon encountered and joined students of the &quot;Young Hegelians&quot; and the <a href="socialism" title="wikilink">socialist</a> movement in Berlin. In his 1842 essay <em>The Reaction in Germany</em>, he argued in favor of the revolutionary role of negation, summed up in the phrase &quot;the passion for destruction is a creative passion.&quot;<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p>After three semesters in Berlin, Bakunin went to <a href="Dresden" class="uri" title="wikilink">Dresden</a> where he became friends with <a href="Arnold_Ruge" title="wikilink">Arnold Ruge</a>. Here he also read <a href="Lorenz_von_Stein" title="wikilink">Lorenz von Stein</a>'s <em>Der Sozialismus und Kommunismus des heutigen Frankreich</em> and developed a passion for <a href="socialism" class="uri" title="wikilink">socialism</a>. He abandoned his interest in an academic career, devoting more and more of his time to promoting <a href="revolution" class="uri" title="wikilink">revolution</a>. The Russian government, becoming aware of this activity, ordered him to return to Russia. On his refusal his property was confiscated. Instead he went with <a href="Georg_Herwegh" title="wikilink">Georg Herwegh</a> to <a href="Z&lt;U+00FC&gt;rich" class="uri" title="wikilink">Z&lt;U+00FC&gt;rich</a>, <a href="Switzerland" class="uri" title="wikilink">Switzerland</a>.</p>
<h3 id="switzerland-brussels-prague-dresden-and-paris">Switzerland, Brussels, Prague, Dresden and Paris</h3>
<p><img src="Young_Bakunin.jpg" title="fig:The young Mikhail Bakunin, illustrated in 1843." alt="The young Mikhail Bakunin, illustrated in 1843." /> During his six month stay in Z&lt;U+00FC&gt;rich, he became closely associated with <a href="Germany" title="wikilink">German</a> <a href="communist" class="uri" title="wikilink">communist</a> <a href="Wilhelm_Weitling" title="wikilink">Wilhelm Weitling</a>. Until 1848 he remained on friendly terms with the German communists, occasionally calling himself a communist and writing articles on communism in the <em>Schweitzerische Republikaner</em>. He moved to <a href="Geneva" class="uri" title="wikilink">Geneva</a> in western Switzerland shortly before Weitling's arrest. His name had appeared frequently in Weitling's correspondence seized by the police. This led to reports being circulated to the imperial police. The Russian ambassador in Bern ordered Bakunin to return to Russia, but instead he went to <a href="Brussels" class="uri" title="wikilink">Brussels</a>, where he met many leading <a href="Poland" title="wikilink">Polish</a> nationalists, such as <a href="Joachim_Lelewel" title="wikilink">Joachim Lelewel</a>, co-member with <a href="Karl_Marx" title="wikilink">Karl Marx</a> and <a href="Friedrich_Engels" title="wikilink">Friedrich Engels</a> at Brussels. Lelewel greatly influenced him, however he clashed with the Polish nationalists over their demand for a historic <a href="Poland" class="uri" title="wikilink">Poland</a> based on the borders of 1776 (before the <a href="Partitions_of_Poland" title="wikilink">Partitions of Poland</a>) as he defended the right of autonomy for the non-Polish peoples in these territories. He also did not support their <a href="clericalism" class="uri" title="wikilink">clericalism</a> and they did not support his calls for the emancipation of the <a href="peasantry" class="uri" title="wikilink">peasantry</a>.</p>
<p>In 1844 Bakunin went to Paris, then a centre of the European political current. He established contacts with <a href="Karl_Marx" title="wikilink">Karl Marx</a> and the anarchist <a href="Pierre-Joseph_Proudhon" title="wikilink">Pierre-Joseph Proudhon</a>, who greatly impressed him and with whom he formed a personal bond. In December 1844, Emperor Nicholas issued a decree stripping Bakunin of his privileges as a <a href="nobility" title="wikilink">noble</a>, denying him civil rights, confiscating his land in Russia, and condemning him to lifelong exile in <a href="Siberia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Siberia</a> should the Russian authorities ever get their hands on him. He responded with a long letter to <em>La R&lt;U+00E9&gt;forme</em>, denouncing the Emperor as a despot and calling for democracy in Russia and Poland (Carr, p. 139). In March 1846 in another letter to the <em>Constitutionel</em> he defended <a href="Poland" class="uri" title="wikilink">Poland</a>, following the repression of <a href="Roman_Catholicism" title="wikilink">Catholics</a> there. Some Polish refugees from <a href="Krak&lt;U+00F3&gt;w" class="uri" title="wikilink">Krak&lt;U+00F3&gt;w</a>, following the defeat of the <a href="Krak&lt;U+00F3&gt;w_Uprising" title="wikilink">uprising</a> there, invited him to speak<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> at the meeting in November 1847 commemorating the Polish <a href="November_Uprising" title="wikilink">November Uprising</a> of 1830.</p>
<p>In his speech, Bakunin called for an alliance between the Polish and Russian peoples against the Emperor, and looked forward to &quot;the definitive collapse of despotism in Russia.&quot; As a result, he was expelled from France and went to Brussels. Bakunin's attempt to draw <a href="Alexander_Herzen" title="wikilink">Alexander Herzen</a> and <a href="Vissarion_Belinsky" title="wikilink">Vissarion Belinsky</a> into conspiratorial action for revolution in Russia fell on deaf ears. In <a href="Brussels" class="uri" title="wikilink">Brussels</a>, Bakunin renewed his contacts with revolutionary Poles and Karl Marx. He spoke at a meeting organised by Lelewel in February 1848 about a great future for the Slavs, whose destiny was to rejuvenate the <a href="West" title="wikilink">Western</a> world. Around this time the Russian embassy circulated rumours that Bakunin was a Russian agent who had exceeded his orders.</p>
<p>As the <a href="revolutions_of_1848" title="wikilink">revolutionary movement of 1848</a> broke out, Bakunin was ecstatic, despite disappointment that little was happening in Russia. Bakunin obtained funding from some socialists in the Provisional Government, <a href="Ferdinand_Flocon" title="wikilink">Ferdinand Flocon</a>, <a href="Louis_Blanc" title="wikilink">Louis Blanc</a>, <a href="Alexandre_Auguste_Ledru-Rollin" title="wikilink">Alexandre Auguste Ledru-Rollin</a> and <a href="Albert_L&#39;Ouvrier" title="wikilink">Albert L'Ouvrier</a>, for a project for a Slav federation liberating those under the rule of <a href="Prussia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Prussia</a>, <a href="Austro-Hungary" class="uri" title="wikilink">Austro-Hungary</a> and <a href="Turkey" class="uri" title="wikilink">Turkey</a>. He left for Germany travelling through <a href="Baden" class="uri" title="wikilink">Baden</a> to <a href="Frankfurt" class="uri" title="wikilink">Frankfurt</a> and <a href="K&lt;U+00F6&gt;ln" class="uri" title="wikilink">K&lt;U+00F6&gt;ln</a>.</p>
<p>Bakunin supported the <a href="German_Democratic_Legion" title="wikilink">German Democratic Legion</a> led by Herwegh in an abortive attempt to join <a href="Friedrich_Hecker" title="wikilink">Friedrich Hecker</a>'s insurrection in <a href="Baden" class="uri" title="wikilink">Baden</a>. He broke with Marx over the latter's criticism of Herwegh. Much later in 1871 Bakunin was to write: <em>&lt;U+201C&gt;I must openly admit that in this controversy Marx and Engels were in the right. With characteristic insolence, they attacked Herwegh personally when he was not there to defend himself. In a face-to-face confrontation with them, I heatedly defended Herwegh, and our mutual dislike began then.&lt;U+201D&gt;</em><a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p>Bakunin went on to Berlin, but was stopped from going to <a href="Pozna&lt;U+0144&gt;" title="wikilink">Posen</a> by the police, which was part of <a href="Poland" title="wikilink">Polish</a> territories gained by <a href="Prussia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Prussia</a> in the <a href="Partitions_of_Poland" title="wikilink">Partitions of Poland</a>, where a nationalist <a href="Wielkopolska_Uprising_(1848)" title="wikilink">insurrection</a> was taking place. Instead Bakunin went to <a href="Leipzig" class="uri" title="wikilink">Leipzig</a> and <a href="Breslau" class="uri" title="wikilink">Breslau</a>, then to <a href="Prague" class="uri" title="wikilink">Prague</a> where he participated in the First Pan Slav Congress. The Congress was followed by an <a href="May_Conspiracy" title="wikilink">abortive insurrection</a> that Bakunin had sought to promote and intensify but which was violently suppressed. He returned to Breslau, where Marx republished the allegation that Bakunin was an imperial agent, claiming that <a href="George_Sand" title="wikilink">George Sand</a> had proof. Marx retracted the statement after George Sand came to Bakunin's defense.</p>
<p>Bakunin published his <em>Appeal to the Slavs</em><a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> in the fall of 1848, in which he proposed that Slav revolutionaries unite with Hungarian, Italian and German revolutionaries to overthrow the three major European autocracies, the Russian Empire, the Austro-Hungarian Empire, and the Kingdom of Prussia.</p>
<p>Bakunin played a leading role in the <a href="May_Uprising_in_Dresden" title="wikilink">May Uprising in Dresden</a> in 1849, helping to organize the defense of the barricades against Prussian troops with <a href="Richard_Wagner" title="wikilink">Richard Wagner</a> and <a href="Wilhelm_Heine" title="wikilink">Wilhelm Heine</a>. He was captured in <a href="Chemnitz" class="uri" title="wikilink">Chemnitz</a> and held for thirteen months before being condemned to death by the government of <a href="Saxony" class="uri" title="wikilink">Saxony</a>. As the governments of Russia and Austria were also after him, his sentence was commuted to life. In June 1850, he was handed over to the Austrian authorities. Eleven months later he received a further death sentence, but this too was commuted to life imprisonment. Finally, in May 1851, Bakunin was handed over to the Russian authorities.</p>
<p><a href="Richard_Wagner" title="wikilink">Richard Wagner</a> wrote in his diary about Bakunin's visit:<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>

<h3 id="imprisonment-confession-and-exile">Imprisonment, &quot;confession&quot;, and exile</h3>
<p>Bakunin was taken to the notorious <a href="Peter_and_Paul_Fortress" title="wikilink">Peter and Paul Fortress</a>. At the beginning of his captivity, Count <a href="Orlov" class="uri" title="wikilink">Orlov</a>, an emissary of the Emperor, visited Bakunin and told him that the Emperor requested a written <a href="confession" class="uri" title="wikilink">confession</a><a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> hoping that the confession would place Bakunin spiritually as well as physically in the power of the Russian state. Since all his acts were known, he had no secrets to reveal, and so he decided to write to the Emperor:</p>

<p>After three years in the underground dungeons of the Fortress of St Peter and St Paul, he spent another four years in the castle of <a href="Shlisselburg" class="uri" title="wikilink">Shlisselburg</a>. It was here that he suffered from <a href="scurvy" class="uri" title="wikilink">scurvy</a> and all his teeth fell out as a result of the appalling diet. He later recounted that he found some relief in mentally re-enacting the legend of <a href="Prometheus" class="uri" title="wikilink">Prometheus</a>. His continuing imprisonment in these awful conditions led him to entreat his brother to supply him with poison. <img src="Mikhail_Bakunin_and_Antonia.jpg" title="fig:Mikhail Bakunin and Antonia Kwiatkowska, circa 1861" alt="Mikhail Bakunin and Antonia Kwiatkowska, circa 1861" /></p>
<p>Following the death of Nicholas I, the new Emperor <a href="Alexander_II_of_Russia" title="wikilink">Alexander II</a> personally struck Bakunin's name off the amnesty list. In February 1857 his mother's pleas to the Emperor were finally heeded and he was allowed to go into permanent exile in the western Siberian city of <a href="Tomsk" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tomsk</a>. Within a year of arriving in Tomsk, Bakunin married Antonia Kwiatkowska, the daughter of a Polish merchant. He had been teaching her French. In August 1858 Bakunin received a visit from his second cousin, General Count <a href="Nikolay_Muravyov-Amursky" title="wikilink">Nikolay Muravyov-Amursky</a>, who had been governor of Eastern <a href="Siberia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Siberia</a> for ten years.</p>
<p>Muravyov was a liberal and Bakunin, as his relative, became a particular favourite. In the spring of 1859 Muravyov helped Bakunin with a job for Amur Development Agency which enabled him to move with his wife to <a href="Irkutsk" class="uri" title="wikilink">Irkutsk</a>, the capital of <a href="Eastern_Siberia" title="wikilink">Eastern Siberia</a>. This enabled Bakunin to be part of the circle involved in political discussions centred on Muravyov's colonial headquarters. Resenting the treatment of the colony by the Saint Petersburg bureaucracy, including its use as a dumping ground for malcontents, a proposal for a <em>United States of Siberia</em> emerged, independent of Russia and federated into a new <em>United States of Siberia and America</em>, following the example of the <a href="United_States_of_America" title="wikilink">United States of America</a>. The circle included Muravyov's young Chief of Staff, Kukel &lt;U+2013&gt; who <a href="Peter_Kropotkin" title="wikilink">Kropotkin</a> related had the complete works of <a href="Alexander_Herzen" title="wikilink">Alexander Herzen</a> &lt;U+2013&gt; the civil governor Izvolsky , who allowed Bakunin to use his address for correspondence, and Muravyov's deputy and eventual successor, General <a href="Alexander_Dondukov-Korsakov" title="wikilink">Alexander Dondukov-Korsakov</a>.</p>
<p>When Herzen criticised Muravyov in <em>The Bell</em>, Bakunin wrote vigorously in his patron's defence.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> Bakunin tired of his job as a commercial traveller, but thanks to Muravyov's influence, was able to keep his sinecure (worth 2,000 roubles a year) without having to perform any duties. Muravyov was forced to retire from his post as governor general, partly because of his liberal views and partly due to fears he might take Siberia towards independence. He was replaced by Korsakov, who perhaps was even more sympathetic to the plight of the Siberian exiles. Korsakov was also related to Bakunin, Bakunin's brother Paul having married his cousin. Taking Bakunin's word, Korsakov issued him with a letter giving him passage on all ships on the <a href="Amur_River" title="wikilink">Amur River</a> and its tributaries as long as he was back in Irkutsk when the ice came.</p>
<h3 id="escape-from-exile-and-return-to-europe">Escape from exile and return to Europe</h3>
<p>On June 5, 1861, Bakunin left <a href="Irkutsk" class="uri" title="wikilink">Irkutsk</a> under cover of company business, ostensibly employed by a Siberian merchant to make a trip to <a href="Nikolaevsk" class="uri" title="wikilink">Nikolaevsk</a>. By July 17 he was on board the Russian warship <em>Strelok</em> bound for <a href="Kastri" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kastri</a>. However, in the port of <a href="Olga,_Russia" title="wikilink">Olga</a>, Bakunin managed to persuade the American captain of the <em>SS Vickery</em> to take him on board. Despite bumping into the Russian Consul on board, Bakunin was able to sail away under the nose of the <a href="Russian_Imperial_Navy" title="wikilink">Russian Imperial Navy</a>. By August 6 he had reached <a href="Hakodate" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hakodate</a> in the northernmost Japanese island of <a href="Hokkaid&lt;U+014D&gt;" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hokkaid&lt;U+014D&gt;</a> and was soon in <a href="Yokohama" class="uri" title="wikilink">Yokohama</a>. In Japan Bakunin met by chance <a href="Wilhelm_Heine" title="wikilink">Wilhelm Heine</a>, one of his comrades-in arms from Dresden. He also met the German botanist <a href="Philipp_Franz_von_Siebold" title="wikilink">Philipp Franz von Siebold</a> who had been involved in opening up Japan to <a href="Europe" title="wikilink">Europeans</a> (particularly Russians and the <a href="Netherlands" title="wikilink">Dutch</a>) and was a friend of Bakunin's patron Muraviev.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> Von Siebold's son wrote some 40 years later:</p>

<p>In <a href="Boston" class="uri" title="wikilink">Boston</a>, Bakunin visited <a href="Karol_Forster" title="wikilink">Karol Forster</a>, a partisan of <a href="Ludwik_Mieroslawski" title="wikilink">Ludwik Mieroslawski</a> during the 1848 Revolution in Paris, and caught up with other &quot;<a href="Forty-Eighters" class="uri" title="wikilink">Forty-Eighters</a>&quot;, veterans of the 1848 revolutions in Europe, such as <a href="Friedrich_Kapp" title="wikilink">Friedrich Kapp</a>.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> He then sailed for <a href="Liverpool" class="uri" title="wikilink">Liverpool</a> arriving on December 27.

<h3 id="relocation-to-italy">Relocation to Italy</h3>
<p>Having re-entered Western Europe, Bakunin immediately immersed himself in the revolutionary movement. In 1860, while still in <a href="Irkutsk" class="uri" title="wikilink">Irkutsk</a> Bakunin and his political associates had been greatly impressed by <a href="Giuseppe_Garibaldi" title="wikilink">Giuseppe Garibaldi</a> and his expedition to <a href="Two_Sicilies" title="wikilink">Sicily</a>, during which he declared himself <a href="dictator" class="uri" title="wikilink">dictator</a> in the name of <a href="Victor_Emmanuel_II" title="wikilink">Victor Emmanuel II</a>. Following his return to London, he wrote to Garibaldi on 31 January 1862:</p>
<dl>

<dd>If you could have seen as I did the passionate enthusiasm of the whole town of Irkutsk, the capital of Eastern Siberia, at the news of your triumphal march across the possession of the mad king of <a href="Naples" class="uri" title="wikilink">Naples</a>, you would have said as I did that there is no longer space or frontiers.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a>

</dl>
<p>Bakunin asked Garibaldi to participate in a movement encompassing Italians, Hungarians and <a href="South_Slavs" title="wikilink">South Slavs</a> against both <a href="Austria" class="uri" title="wikilink">Austria</a> and <a href="Turkey" class="uri" title="wikilink">Turkey</a>. Garibaldi was then engaged in preparations for the <a href="Giuseppe_Garibaldi#Expedition_against_Rome" title="wikilink">Expedition against Rome</a>. By May Bakunin's correspondence was focussing on Italian-Slavic unity and the developments in <a href="Poland" class="uri" title="wikilink">Poland</a>. By June, he had resolved to move to Italy, but was waiting for his wife to join him. When he left for Italy in August, <a href="Mazzini" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mazzini</a> wrote to Maurizio Quadrio, one of his key supporters that Bakunin was a good and dependable person. However, with the news of the failure at <a href="Battle_of_Aspromonte" title="wikilink">Aspromonte</a> Bakunin paused in Paris where he was briefly involved with <a href="Ludwik_Mieros&lt;U+0142&gt;awski" title="wikilink">Ludwik Mieros&lt;U+0142&gt;awski</a>. However Bakunin rejected Mieroslawski's chauvinism and refusal to grant any concessions to the peasants. Bakunin returned to England in September and focussed on Polish affairs. When the Polish insurrection broke out in January 1863, he sailed to <a href="Copenhagen" class="uri" title="wikilink">Copenhagen</a> where he hoped to join the <a href="Polish_Legion" title="wikilink">Polish Legion</a>. They planned to sail across the <a href="Baltic_Sea" title="wikilink">Baltic</a> in the <em>SS Ward Jackson</em> to join the insurrection. This attempt failed, and Bakunin met his wife in <a href="Stockholm" class="uri" title="wikilink">Stockholm</a> before returning to London. Now he focussed again on going to Italy and his friend Aurelio Saffi wrote him letters of introduction for <a href="Florence" class="uri" title="wikilink">Florence</a>, <a href="Turin" class="uri" title="wikilink">Turin</a> and <a href="Milan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Milan</a>. Mazzini wrote letters of commendation to <a href="Frederico_Campanella" title="wikilink">Frederico Campanella</a> in <a href="Genoa" class="uri" title="wikilink">Genoa</a> and <a href="Giuseppe_Dolfi" title="wikilink">Giuseppe Dolfi</a> in Florence. Bakunin left London in November 1863 travelling by way of <a href="Brussels" class="uri" title="wikilink">Brussels</a>, Paris and <a href="Vevey" class="uri" title="wikilink">Vevey</a> (Switzerland) arriving in Italy on 11 January 1864. It was here that he first began to develop his anarchist ideas.</p>
<p>He conceived the plan of forming a secret organization of revolutionaries to carry on propaganda work and prepare for direct action. He recruited Italians, Frenchmen, Scandinavians, and Slavs into the International Brotherhood, also called the Alliance of Revolutionary Socialists.</p>
<p>By July 1866 Bakunin was informing Herzen and Ogarev about the fruits of his work over the previous two years. His secret society then had members in Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Belgium, England, France, Spain, and Italy, as well as Polish and Russian members. In his <em><a href="Catechism_of_a_Revolutionary" title="wikilink">Catechism of a Revolutionary</a></em> of 1866, he opposed religion and the state, advocating the &quot;absolute rejection of every authority including that which sacrifices freedom for the convenience of the state.&quot;<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> <img src="Bakunin_Membership_Card.jpg" title="fig:Bakunin&#39;s membership card of the League of Peace and Freedom" alt="Bakunin&#39;s membership card of the League of Peace and Freedom" /></p>
<p>During the 1867&lt;U+2013&gt;1868 period, Bakunin responded to <a href="Emile_Acollas" title="wikilink">Emile Acollas</a>'s call and became involved in the <a href="League_of_Peace_and_Freedom" title="wikilink">League of Peace and Freedom</a> (LPF), for which he wrote a lengthy essay <em>Federalism, Socialism, and Anti-Theologism</em><a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> Here he advocated a federalist socialism, drawing on the work of Proudhon. He supported freedom of association and the right of secession for each unit of the federation, but emphasized that this freedom must be joined with socialism for: &quot;Liberty without socialism is privilege, injustice; socialism without liberty is slavery and brutality.&quot;.....</p>
<p>Bakunin played a prominent role in the Geneva Conference (September 1867), and joined the Central Committee. The founding conference was attended by 6,000 people. As Bakunin rose to speak:</p>

<p>At the <a href="Bern" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bern</a> Congress of the League (1868) he and other socialists (<a href="&lt;U+00C9&gt;lis&lt;U+00E9&gt;e_Reclus" title="wikilink">&lt;U+00C9&gt;lis&lt;U+00E9&gt;e Reclus</a>, <a href="Aristide_Rey" title="wikilink">Aristide Rey</a>, Jaclard, <a href="Giuseppe_Fanelli" title="wikilink">Giuseppe Fanelli</a>, N. Joukovsky, V. Mratchkovsky and others) found themselves in a minority. They seceded from the League establishing their own <a href="International_Alliance_of_Socialist_Democracy" title="wikilink">International Alliance of Socialist Democracy</a> which adopted a revolutionary socialist program.</p>

<p>In 1868, Bakunin joined the Geneva section of the <a href="First_International" title="wikilink">First International</a>, in which he remained very active until he was expelled from the International by <a href="Karl_Marx" title="wikilink">Karl Marx</a> and his followers at the <a href="Hague_Congress_(1872)" title="wikilink">Hague Congress</a> in 1872. Bakunin was instrumental in establishing branches of the International in Italy and Spain.</p>
<p>In 1869, the <a href="International_Alliance_of_Socialist_Democracy" title="wikilink">Social Democratic Alliance</a> was refused entry to the First International, on the grounds that it was an international organisation in itself, and only national organisations were permitted membership in the International. The Alliance dissolved and the various groups which it comprised joined the International separately.</p>
<p>Between 1869 and 1870, Bakunin became involved with the Russian revolutionary <a href="Sergey_Nechayev" title="wikilink">Sergey Nechayev</a> in a number of clandestine projects. However, Bakunin broke with Nechaev over what he described as the latter&lt;U+2019&gt;s &lt;U+201C&gt;<a href="Jesuit" class="uri" title="wikilink">Jesuit</a>&lt;U+201D&gt; methods, by which all means were justified to achieve revolutionary ends.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1870 Bakunin led a failed uprising in <a href="Lyon" class="uri" title="wikilink">Lyon</a> on the principles later exemplified by the <a href="Paris_Commune" title="wikilink">Paris Commune</a>, calling for a general uprising in response to the collapse of the French government during the <a href="Franco-Prussian_War" title="wikilink">Franco-Prussian War</a>, seeking to transform an imperialist conflict into social revolution. In his <em>Letters to A Frenchman on the Present Crisis</em>, he argued for a revolutionary alliance between the working class and the peasantry and set forth his formulation of what was later to become known as <a href="propaganda_of_the_deed" title="wikilink">propaganda of the deed</a>:</p>

<p>Bakunin was a strong supporter of the <a href="Paris_Commune" title="wikilink">Paris Commune</a> of 1871, which was brutally suppressed by the French government. He saw the Commune as above all a &lt;U+201C&gt;rebellion against the State,&lt;U+201D&gt; and commended the Communards for rejecting not only the State but also revolutionary dictatorship.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> In a series of powerful pamphlets, he defended the Commune and the First International against the Italian nationalist <a href="Giuseppe_Mazzini" title="wikilink">Giuseppe Mazzini</a>, thereby winning over many Italian republicans to the International and the cause of revolutionary socialism.</p>
<p>Bakunin&lt;U+2019&gt;s disagreements with Marx, which led to Bakunin&lt;U+2019&gt;s expulsion from the International in 1872 after being outvoted by the <a href="Marx_party" title="wikilink">Marx party</a> at the Hague Congress, illustrated the growing divergence between the &quot;anti-authoritarian&quot; sections of the International, which advocated the direct revolutionary action and organization of the workers in order to abolish the state and capitalism, and the <a href="social_democratic" title="wikilink">social democratic</a> sections allied with Marx, which advocated the conquest of political power by the working class. Bakunin was &quot;Marx&lt;U+2019&gt;s flamboyant chief opponent&quot; at the Hague meeting, and &quot;presciently warned against the emergence of a communist authoritarianism that would take power over working people.&quot;<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a></p>
<p>The anti-authoritarian sections created their own International at the <a href="Saint-Imier" title="wikilink">St. Imier</a> <a href="Anarchist_St._Imier_International" title="wikilink">Congress</a> and adopted a revolutionary anarchist program.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> Although Bakunin accepted Marx&lt;U+2019&gt;s <a href="class_analysis" title="wikilink">class analysis</a> and economic theories regarding capitalism, acknowledging &quot;Marx&lt;U+2019&gt;s genius&quot;, he thought Marx was arrogant, and that his methods would compromise the social revolution. More importantly, Bakunin criticized &quot;<a href="authoritarianism" title="wikilink">authoritarian socialism</a>&quot; (which he associated with Marxism) and the concept of <a href="dictatorship_of_the_proletariat" title="wikilink">dictatorship of the proletariat</a> which he adamantly refused.</p>

<p>Bakunin retired to <a href="Lugano" class="uri" title="wikilink">Lugano</a> in 1873 and died in <a href="Bern" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bern</a> on July 1, 1876.</p>
<h2 id="thought">Thought</h2>
<p>Bakunin&lt;U+2019&gt;s political beliefs rejected governing systems in every name and shape, from the idea of God downwards, and every form of external <a href="authority" class="uri" title="wikilink">authority</a>, whether emanating from the will of a <a href="sovereignty" title="wikilink">sovereign</a> or from universal suffrage. He wrote in <em>Dieu et l&lt;U+2019&gt;Etat</em> (<em>God and the State</em>):<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a></p>

<p>Bakunin similarly rejected the notion of any privileged position or class, since</p>

<p>Bakunin's political beliefs were based on several interrelated concepts: (1) <a href="liberty" class="uri" title="wikilink">liberty</a>; (2) <a href="socialism" class="uri" title="wikilink">socialism</a>; (3) <a href="federalism" class="uri" title="wikilink">federalism</a>; (4) <a href="anti-theism" class="uri" title="wikilink">anti-theism</a>; and (5) <a href="materialism" class="uri" title="wikilink">materialism</a>. He also developed a (resultantly prescient)<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> critique of Marxism, predicting that if the Marxists were successful in seizing power, they would create a party dictatorship &quot;all the more dangerous because it appears as a sham expression of the people's will.&quot;<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="liberty">Liberty</h3>
<p>By &quot;liberty&quot;, Bakunin did not mean an abstract ideal but a concrete reality based on the equal liberty of others. In a positive sense, liberty consists of &quot;the fullest development of all the faculties and powers of every human being, by education, by scientific training, and by material prosperity.&quot; Such a conception of liberty is &quot;eminently social, because it can only be realized in society,&quot; not in isolation. In a negative sense, liberty is &quot;the revolt of the individual against all divine, collective, and individual authority.&quot;<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="collectivist-anarchism">Collectivist anarchism</h3>

<p>Bakunin's socialism was known as &quot;<a href="collectivist_anarchism" title="wikilink">collectivist anarchism</a>&quot;, in which the workers would directly manage the means of production through their own productive associations. There would be &quot;equal means of subsistence, support, education, and opportunity for every child, boy or girl, until maturity, and equal resources and facilities in adulthood to create his own well-being by his own labor.&quot;<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="federalism">Federalism</h3>
<p>By federalism Bakunin meant the organization of society &quot;from the base to the summit&lt;U+2014&gt;from the circumference to the center&lt;U+2014&gt;according to the principles of free association and federation.&quot;<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> Consequently, society would be organized &quot;on the basis of the absolute freedom of individuals, of the productive associations, and of the communes,&quot; with &quot;every individual, every association, every commune, every region, every nation&quot; having &quot;the absolute right to self-determination, to associate or not to associate, to ally themselves with whomever they wish.&quot;<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="anti-theologism">Anti-theologism</h3>
<p>Bakunin argued that &quot;the idea of God implies the abdication of human reason and justice; it is the most decisive negation of human liberty, and necessarily ends in the enslavement of mankind, in theory and practice.&quot; Consequently, Bakunin reversed <a href="Voltaire" class="uri" title="wikilink">Voltaire</a>'s famous aphorism that if God did not exist, it would be necessary to invent Him, writing instead that &quot;if God really existed, it would be necessary to abolish Him.&quot;<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="materialism">Materialism</h3>
<p>Bakunin denied religious concepts of &quot;<a href="free_will" title="wikilink">free will</a>&quot; and advocated a materialist explanation of natural phenomena: &quot;the manifestations of organic life, chemical properties and reactions, electricity, light, warmth and the natural attraction of physical bodies, constitute in our view so many different but no less closely interdependent variants of that totality of real beings which we call matter&quot; (<em>Selected Writings</em>, page 219). The &quot;mission of science is, by observation of the general relations of passing and real facts, to establish the general laws inherent in the development of the phenomena of the physical and social world.&quot; However, Bakunin rejected the notion of &quot;scientific socialism,&quot; writing in <em>God and the State</em> that a &quot;scientific body to which had been confided the government of society would soon end by devoting itself no longer to science at all, but to quite another affair... its own eternal perpetuation by rendering the society confided to its care ever more stupid and consequently more in need of its government and direction.&quot;<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="social-revolution">Social revolution</h3>
<p>Bakunin&lt;U+2019&gt;s methods of realizing his revolutionary program were consistent with his principles. The workers and peasants were to organize on a federalist basis, &quot;creating not only the ideas, but also the facts of the future itself.&quot;<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> The worker's trade union associations would &quot;take possession of all the tools of production as well as buildings and capital.&quot;<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> The peasants were to &quot;take the land and throw out those landlords who live by the labor of others.&quot;<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> Bakunin looked to &quot;the rabble,&quot; the great masses of the poor and exploited, the so-called &quot;lumpenproletariat,&quot; to &quot;inaugurate and bring to triumph the Social Revolution,&quot; as they were &quot;almost unpolluted by bourgeois civilization.&quot;<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="critique-of-marxism">Critique of Marxism</h3>
<p>The dispute between Mikhail Bakunin and Karl Marx highlighted the differences between <a href="anarchism" class="uri" title="wikilink">anarchism</a> and <a href="Marxism" class="uri" title="wikilink">Marxism</a>. Bakunin argued&lt;U+2014&gt;against certain ideas of a number of Marxists&lt;U+2014&gt;that not all revolutions need be violent. He also strongly rejected Marx's concept of the &quot;<a href="dictatorship_of_the_proletariat" title="wikilink">dictatorship of the proletariat</a>&quot;, a concept that Vanguardist socialism and Marxist-Leninism incorrectly use to mean what would be described as a &quot;workers democracy&quot;, but which also maintains the party as the state during the transition to the Marxist economical system of &quot;anarchism&quot;.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> Bakunin, &quot;who had now abandoned his ideas of revolutionary dictatorship&quot;,<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> insisted that revolutions must be led by the people directly while any &quot;enlightened elite&quot; must only exert influence by remaining &quot;<a href="invisible_dictatorship" title="wikilink">invisible</a>...not imposed on anyone...[and] deprived of all official rights and significance&quot;.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> He held that the state should be immediately abolished because all forms of government eventually lead to oppression.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> Libertarian Marxists argue Marx used the phrase to mean the worker control at the point of production, not a party, would still be a state until society is reorganized according to socialist principles.</p>

<p>While both social anarchists and Marxists share the same final goal, the creation of a free, <a href="egalitarian" class="uri" title="wikilink">egalitarian</a> society without <a href="classlessness" title="wikilink">social classes</a> and government, they strongly disagree on how to achieve this goal. Anarchists believe that the classless, stateless society should be established by the <a href="direct_action" title="wikilink">direct action</a> of the masses, culminating in <a href="social_revolution" title="wikilink">social revolution</a>, and refuse any intermediate stage such as the <a href="dictatorship_of_the_proletariat" title="wikilink">dictatorship of the proletariat</a>, on the basis that such a dictatorship will become a self-perpetuating fundament. For Bakunin, the fundamental contradiction is that for the Marxists, &quot;anarchism or freedom is the aim, while the state and dictatorship is the means, and so, in order to free the masses, they have first to be enslaved.&quot;<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a></p>
<p>However, Bakunin also wrote of meeting Marx in 1844 that: </p>
<p>Bakunin found Marx's economic analysis very useful and began the job of translating <em><a href="Das_Kapital" title="wikilink">Das Kapital</a></em> into Russian. In turn Marx wrote of the rebels in the Dresden insurrection of 1848 that &quot;In the Russian refugee Michael Bakunin they found a capable and cool headed leader.&quot;<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> Marx wrote to Engels of meeting Bakunin in 1864 after his escape to Siberia saying &quot;On the whole he is one of the few people whom I find not to have retrogressed after 16 years, but to have developed further.&quot;<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a></p>
<p>Bakunin was perhaps the first theorist of the &quot;<a href="new_class" title="wikilink">new class</a>&quot;, the intellectuals and administrators forming the bureaucratic apparatus of the state. Bakunin argued that the &quot;State has always been the patrimony of some privileged class: a priestly class, an aristocratic class, a bourgeois class. And finally, when all the other classes have exhausted themselves, the State then becomes the patrimony of the bureaucratic class and then falls&lt;U+2014&gt;or, if you will, rises&lt;U+2014&gt;to the position of a machine.&quot;<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="the-revolutionary-potential-of-the-proletariat-and-the-lumpenproletariat">The revolutionary potential of the proletariat and the <em>lumpenproletariat</em></h3>
<p>Bakunin had a view almost opposite of Marx's on the revolutionary potential of the <em><a href="lumpenproletariat" class="uri" title="wikilink">lumpenproletariat</a></em> and the <a href="proletariat" class="uri" title="wikilink">proletariat</a><a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> Bakunin &quot;considers workers' integration in capital as destructive of more primary revolutionary forces. For Bakunin, the revolutionary archetype is found in a peasant milieu (which is presented as having longstanding insurrectionary traditions, as well as a communist archetype in its current social form&lt;U+2014&gt;the peasant commune) and amongst educated unemployed youth, assorted marginals from all classes, brigands, robbers, the impoverished masses, and those on the margins of society who have escaped, been excluded from, or not yet subsumed in the discipline of emerging industrial work...in short, all those whom Marx sought to include in the category of the lumpenproletariat.&quot;<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="influence">Influence</h2>
<p>Bakunin is remembered as a major figure in the history of anarchism and an opponent of Marxism, especially of Marx's idea of <a href="dictatorship_of_the_proletariat" title="wikilink">dictatorship of the proletariat</a>. He continues to be an influence on modern-day anarchists, such as <a href="Noam_Chomsky" title="wikilink">Noam Chomsky</a>.<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> Bakunin biographer <a href="Mark_Leier" title="wikilink">Mark Leier</a> has asserted that &quot;Bakunin had a significant influence on later thinkers, ranging from <a href="Peter_Kropotkin" title="wikilink">Peter Kropotkin</a> and <a href="Enrico_Malatesta" title="wikilink">Enrico Malatesta</a> to the <a href="Wobblies" class="uri" title="wikilink">Wobblies</a> and Spanish anarchists in the <a href="Spanish_Civil_War" title="wikilink">Civil War</a> to <a href="Herbert_Marcuse" title="wikilink">Herbert Marcuse</a>, <a href="E.P._Thompson" title="wikilink">E.P.

<h3 id="violence-revolution-and-invisible-dictatorship">Violence, revolution, and &quot;Invisible dictatorship&quot;</h3>

<p>Bakunin has been accused of being a closet authoritarian.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a> In his letter to Albert Richard, he wrote that  However, Bakunin's supporters argue that this &quot;invisible dictatorship&quot; is not a dictatorship in any conventional sense of the word, as Bakunin was careful to point out that its members would not exercise any official political power:  Charles A. Madison claimed that: </p>
<p>Bakunin was also criticized by Marx<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a> and the delegates of the <a href="International_Workingmen&#39;s_Association" title="wikilink">International</a> specifically because his methods of organization were similar to those of <a href="Sergey_Nechayev" title="wikilink">Sergey Nechayev</a>, with whom Bakunin was closely associated.<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a> While Bakunin rebuked Nechayev upon discovery of his duplicity towards him, he did not break completely with Nechayev, as indicated by a June 2, 1870 letter: &quot;Lies, cunning [and] entanglement [are] a necessary and marvelous means for demoralising and destroying the enemy, though <em>certainly not</em> a useful means of obtaining and attracting new friends.&quot; Bakunin continued to defend the young radical he called &quot;my tiger cub,&quot; and even advised Nechayev to form a secret society which used &quot;Jesuit methods or even entanglement&quot; against enemy societies and the government. As Bakunin wrote, &quot;societies whose aims are near to ours <em>must be forced to merge with our society or, at least, must be subordinated to it without their knowledge</em>, while harmful people must be removed from them. Societies which are inimical or positively harmful must be dissolved, and finally the government must be destroyed. All this cannot be achieved only by propagating the truth; <em>cunning, diplomacy, deceit are necessary.</em>&quot;<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a> Nevertheless, Bakunin began warning friends about Nechayev's behavior.</p>
<p>Others insist, however, that Bakunin never sought to take personal control of the International, that his secret organisations were not subject to his autocratic power, and that he condemned terrorism as counter-revolutionary.<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a> Robert M. Cutler goes further, pointing out that it is impossible fully to understand either Bakunin's participation in the <a href="League_of_Peace_and_Freedom" title="wikilink">League of Peace and Freedom</a> or the <a href="International_Alliance_of_Socialist_Democracy" title="wikilink">International Alliance of Socialist Democracy</a>, or his idea of a secret revolutionary organisation that is immanent in the people, without seeing that they derive from his interpretation of Hegel's dialectic from the 1840s. The script of Bakunin's dialectic, Cutler argues, gave the Alliance the purpose of providing the International with a real revolutionary organisation.</p>

<h3 id="anti-semitism">Anti-semitism</h3>
<p>Bakunin was an outspoken <a href="Anti-Semitism" title="wikilink">anti-semite</a> and has been severely criticized for this part of his writing.<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a> Bakunin used anti-Jewish sentiments during his argument with Karl Marx; he claimed that Marxian <a href="communism" class="uri" title="wikilink">communism</a>, along with international banking cartels associated with <a href="Rothschild_family" title="wikilink">Rothschild</a>, was part of Jewish system of global exploitation;</p>

<p>He has also commented that:</p>

<h3 id="eurocentrism">Eurocentrism</h3>
<p>His <a href="Eurocentrism" class="uri" title="wikilink">Eurocentrism</a> manifested itself in his support for Russian <a href="Colonialism" class="uri" title="wikilink">Colonialism</a>, particularly as practised by his relative and patron Count <a href="Nikolay_Muravyov-Amursky" title="wikilink">Nikolay Muravyov-Amursky</a> and his indifference to Japan and <a href="Japan" title="wikilink">Japanese</a> peasants during and after his brief stay in <a href="Yokohama" class="uri" title="wikilink">Yokohama</a>.<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a> (Japan was regarded as the most prominent revolutionary country in Asia following the <a href="Meiji_Restoration" title="wikilink">Meiji Restoration</a> of 1866&lt;U+2013&gt;1869.) He also advocated a <a href="United_States_of_Europe" title="wikilink">United States of Europe</a>. All these aspects of his thought however date from before he became an anarchist. Bakunin's conversion to anarchism came in 1865, towards the end of his life, and four years after his time in Japan.<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="nationalism">Nationalism</h3>
<p>Bakunin stated:</p>
<p>&quot;I feel myself always the patriot of all oppressed fatherlands. . . Nationality. . . is a historic, local fact which, like all real and harmless facts, has the right to claim general acceptance. . . Every people, like every person, is involuntarily that which it is and therefore has a right to be itself. . . Nationality is not a principle; it is a legitimate fact, just as individuality is. Every nationality, great or small, has the incontestable right to be itself, to live according to its own nature. This right is simply the corollary of the general principal of freedom.&quot; -Bukunin [quoted by Alfredo M. Bonanno in Anarchism and the National Liberation Struggle, pp. 19&lt;U+2013&gt;20]</p>
