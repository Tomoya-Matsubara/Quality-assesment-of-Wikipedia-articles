<p><strong>Isaac Shelby</strong> (December 11, 1750 &lt;U+2013&gt; July 18, 1826) was the <a href="List_of_Governors_of_Kentucky" title="wikilink">first and fifth</a> <a href="Governor_of_Kentucky" title="wikilink">Governor</a> of the <a href="U.S._state" title="wikilink">U.S. state</a> of <a href="Kentucky" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kentucky</a> and served in the state legislatures of <a href="Virginia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Virginia</a> and <a href="North_Carolina" title="wikilink">North Carolina</a>. He was also a soldier in <a href="Lord_Dunmore&#39;s_War" title="wikilink">Lord Dunmore's War</a>, the <a href="American_Revolutionary_War" title="wikilink">Revolutionary War</a>, and the <a href="War_of_1812" title="wikilink">War of 1812</a>. While governor, he personally led the <a href="Kentucky" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kentucky</a> militia in the <a href="Battle_of_the_Thames" title="wikilink">Battle of the Thames</a>, an action that was rewarded with a <a href="Congressional_Gold_Medal" title="wikilink">Congressional Gold Medal</a>. Counties in nine states, and several cities and military bases, have been named in his honor. His fondness for <a href="John_Dickinson_(delegate)" title="wikilink">John Dickinson</a>'s <em><a href="The_Liberty_Song" title="wikilink">The Liberty Song</a></em> is believed to be the reason Kentucky adopted the state motto &quot;<a href="United_we_stand,_divided_we_fall" title="wikilink">United we stand, divided we fall</a>&quot;.</p>
<p>Shelby's military service began when he served as second-in-command to his father at the <a href="Battle_of_Point_Pleasant" title="wikilink">Battle of Point Pleasant</a>, the only major battle of Lord Dunmore's War. He gained the reputation of an expert woodsman and surveyor, and spent the early part of the Revolutionary War gathering supplies for the <a href="Continental_Army" title="wikilink">Continental Army</a>. Later in the war, he and <a href="John_Sevier" title="wikilink">John Sevier</a> led expeditions over the <a href="Appalachian_Mountains" title="wikilink">Appalachian Mountains</a> against the <a href="Kingdom_of_Great_Britain" title="wikilink">British</a> forces in North Carolina. He played a pivotal role in the British defeat at the <a href="Battle_of_King&#39;s_Mountain" title="wikilink">Battle of King's Mountain</a>. For his service, he was presented with a ceremonial sword and a pair of pistols by the North Carolina legislature, and the nickname &quot;Old King's Mountain&quot; followed him the rest of his life.</p>
<p>Following the war, Shelby relocated to Kentucky on lands awarded to him for his military service and became involved in Kentucky's transition from a county of Virginia to an independent <a href="U.S._state" title="wikilink">state</a>. His heroism made him popular with the citizens of the state, and the state electoral college unanimously elected him governor in 1792. He secured the state from <a href="Native_Americans_in_the_United_States" title="wikilink">Indian</a> attacks and organized its first government. He leveraged the <a href="Citizen_Genet" title="wikilink">Citizen Genet</a> affair to convince the <a href="George_Washington" title="wikilink">Washington</a> administration to make an agreement with the <a href="Spain" title="wikilink">Spanish</a> for free trade on the <a href="Mississippi_River" title="wikilink">Mississippi River</a>.</p>
<p>At the end of his gubernatorial term, Shelby retired from public life, but he was called back into politics by the impending War of 1812. Kentuckians urged Shelby to run for governor again and lead them through the anticipated conflict. He was elected easily, and at the request of General <a href="William_Henry_Harrison" title="wikilink">William Henry Harrison</a>, commanded troops from Kentucky at the Battle of the Thames. At the conclusion of the war, he declined President <a href="James_Monroe" title="wikilink">James Monroe</a>'s offer to become <a href="United_States_Secretary_of_War" title="wikilink">Secretary of War</a>. In his last act of public service, he and <a href="Andrew_Jackson" title="wikilink">Andrew Jackson</a> acted as commissioners to negotiate the <a href="Jackson_Purchase_(U.S._historical_region)" title="wikilink">Jackson Purchase</a> from the <a href="Chickasaw" class="uri" title="wikilink">Chickasaw</a> Indian tribe. Shelby died at his estate in <a href="Lincoln_County,_Kentucky" title="wikilink">Lincoln County, Kentucky</a>, on July 18, 1826.</p>

<p>Isaac Shelby was born in the <a href="Province_of_Maryland" title="wikilink">Province of Maryland</a> on December 11, 1750, near <a href="Hagerstown,_Maryland" title="wikilink">Hagerstown</a> in <a href="Frederick_County,_Maryland" title="wikilink">Frederick</a> (now <a href="Washington_County,_Maryland" title="wikilink">Washington</a>) County.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a><a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> He was the third child and second son of Evan and Letitia (Cox) Shelby, who immigrated from <a href="Tregaron" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tregaron</a>, <a href="Wales" class="uri" title="wikilink">Wales</a>, in 1735.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> Though the family had historically been loyal to the <a href="Church_of_England" title="wikilink">Church of England</a>, they became <a href="Presbyterianism" title="wikilink">Presbyterians</a> after coming to <a href="British_America" title="wikilink">British America</a>; this was the denomination Isaac Shelby embraced during his life.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>

<p>After his unit was disbanded, Shelby surveyed for the <a href="Transylvania_Company" title="wikilink">Transylvania Company</a>, a land company that had purchased much of present-day Kentucky from the <a href="Cherokee" title="wikilink">Cherokees</a> in a deal that was later invalidated by the government of Virginia.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> After fulfilling his duties with the Transylvania Company, he rejoined his family in Virginia, but returned to Kentucky the following year to claim and improve land there for himself.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> While there, he fell ill, and went home to recover in July 1776.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> Back in Virginia, fighting in the <a href="American_Revolutionary_War" title="wikilink">American Revolutionary War</a> was underway, and Shelby found a commission from the Virginia Committee of Safety appointing him captain of a company of <a href="Minutemen" class="uri" title="wikilink">Minutemen</a>.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> In 1777, Virginia governor <a href="Patrick_Henry" title="wikilink">Patrick Henry</a> appointed Shelby to a position securing provisions for the army on the frontier.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> He served a similar role for units in the <a href="Continental_Army" title="wikilink">Continental Army</a> in 1778 and 1779.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> With his own money, Shelby purchased provisions for John Sevier's 1779 expedition against the <a href="Chickamauga_(tribe)" title="wikilink">Chickamauga</a>, a band of Cherokees who were resisting colonial expansion.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a></p>
<p>Shelby was elected to represent <a href="Washington_County,_Virginia" title="wikilink">Washington County</a> in the <a href="Virginia_House_of_Delegates" title="wikilink">Virginia House of Delegates</a> in 1779.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> Later that year, he was commissioned a major by Governor <a href="Thomas_Jefferson" title="wikilink">Thomas Jefferson</a> and charged with escorting a group of commissioners to establish a frontier boundary line between Virginia and North Carolina.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> Shortly after his arrival in the region, <a href="Governor_of_North_Carolina" title="wikilink">North Carolina Governor</a> <a href="Richard_Caswell" title="wikilink">Richard Caswell</a> elevated him to the rank of colonel and made him <a href="magistrate" class="uri" title="wikilink">magistrate</a> of newly-formed <a href="Sullivan_County,_Tennessee" title="wikilink">Sullivan County</a>.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a></p>
<p>Shelby was surveying lands in Kentucky in 1780 when he heard of the colonists' defeat at <a href="Siege_of_Charleston" title="wikilink">Charleston</a>.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> He hurried to North Carolina, where he found a request for aid from General Charles McDowell to defend the borders of North Carolina from the British.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> Shelby assembled three hundred militiamen and joined McDowell at Cherokee Ford in <a href="South_Carolina" title="wikilink">South Carolina</a>.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> On the morning of July 31, 1780, he surrounded the British stronghold at Thickety Fort on the <a href="Pacolet_River" title="wikilink">Pacolet River</a> with 600 men.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> He immediately demanded a surrender, but the British refused.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> Shelby brought his men within <a href="musket" class="uri" title="wikilink">musket</a> range and again demanded surrender.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> Though the fort likely would have withstood the attack, the British commander lost his nerve and capitulated.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> Without firing a shot, Shelby's men captured 94 prisoners.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a></p>
<p>Following the surrender of Thickety Fort, Shelby joined a band of <a href="Partisan_(military)" title="wikilink">partisans</a> under Lieutenant <a href="Elijah_Clarke" title="wikilink">Elijah Clarke</a>. This unit was pursued by British Major <a href="Patrick_Ferguson" title="wikilink">Patrick Ferguson</a>. On the morning of August 8, 1780, some of Shelby's men were gathering peaches from an orchard when they were surprised by some of Ferguson's men on a reconnaissance mission. Shelby's men quickly readied their arms and drove back the British patrol. Soon, however, the British were reinforced and the colonists fell back. The pattern continued, with one side being reinforced and gaining an advantage, followed by the other. Shelby's men were winning the battle when Ferguson's main force of 1,000 men arrived. Outmanned, they retreated to a nearby hill where British musket fire could not reach them. Now safe, they taunted the British, and Ferguson's force withdrew from the area. Thus ended the Battle of Cedar Springs.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a></p>
<p>General McDowell then ordered Shelby and Clarke to take Musgrove's Mill, a British encampment on the <a href="Enoree_River" title="wikilink">Enoree River</a>. They rode all night with two hundred men, reaching their location about dawn on August 18, 1780. The colonists had estimated that the enemy force was of comparable size, but an advance scout brought word that there were approximately 500 British soldiers in the camp who were preparing for battle. Shelby's men and horses were too tired for a retreat and they had lost the element of surprise. He ordered his men to construct a <a href="Breastwork_(fortification)" title="wikilink">breastwork</a> from nearby logs and brush. In half an hour the makeshift fortifications were complete, and twenty-five colonial riders charged the British camp to provoke the attack. The British pursued them back to the main colonial force. Despite being outnumbered, the colonists killed several British officers and put their army to flight.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a></p>

<p>Shelby and Clarke elected not to pursue the British fleeing the <a href="Battle_of_Musgrove_Mill" title="wikilink">Battle of Musgrove Mill</a>.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> Instead, they set their sights on a British fort at <a href="Ninety_Six,_South_Carolina" title="wikilink">Ninety Six, South Carolina</a>, where they were sure they would find Ferguson.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> However, while en route, Shelby and his men were met with news of General <a href="Horatio_Gates" title="wikilink">Horatio Gates</a>' defeat at the <a href="Battle_of_Camden" title="wikilink">Battle of Camden</a>.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> With the backing of General <a href="Charles_Cornwallis,_1st_Marquess_Cornwallis" title="wikilink">Cornwallis</a>, Ferguson could ride to meet Shelby with his entire force, so Shelby retreated over the Appalachian Mountains into North Carolina.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a></p>

<p>The combined force pursued Ferguson to <a href="Kings_Mountain,_North_Carolina" title="wikilink">King's Mountain</a>, where he had fortified himself, declaring that &quot;God Almighty and all the rebels out of hell&quot; could not move him from it.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a> The <a href="Battle_of_Kings_Mountain" title="wikilink">Battle of Kings Mountain</a> commenced October 7, 1780. Shelby had ordered his men to advance from tree to tree, firing from behind each one; he called this technique &quot;Indian play&quot; because he had seen the Indians use it in his previous battles with them. Ferguson ordered <a href="bayonet" class="uri" title="wikilink">bayonet</a> charges that forced Shelby's men to fall back on three separate occasions, but eventually the colonists dislodged Ferguson's men from their position. Seeing the battle was lost, Ferguson and his key officers attempted a retreat. The colonists were instructed to kill Ferguson. Simultaneous shots by Sevier's men broke both Ferguson's arms, fatally pierced his skull, and knocked him from his mount. Seeing their commander dead, the remaining British soldiers waved <a href="White_flag#Flag_of_surrender_or_truce" title="wikilink">white flags</a> of surrender.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a></p>
<p>King's Mountain was the high point of Shelby's military service, and from that point forward his men dubbed him &quot;Old King's Mountain&quot;.<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a> The North Carolina legislature passed a vote of thanks to Shelby and Sevier for their service and ordered that each be presented a pair of pistols and a ceremonial sword.<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a> (Shelby did not receive these items until he requested them from the legislature in 1813.)<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a></p>
<p>As the colonists and their prisoners began the march from King's Mountain, they learned that nine colonial prisoners had been hanged by the British at Fort Ninety-Six. This was not the first such incident in the region, and the enraged colonists vowed that they would now put a stop to the hangings in the Carolinas. Summoning a jury from their number &lt;U+2013&gt; which was legal because two North Carolina magistrates were present &lt;U+2013&gt; the colonists selected random prisoners and charged them with crimes ranging from theft to arson to murder. By evening, the jury had convicted thirty-six prisoners and sentenced them to hang. After the first nine hangings, however, Shelby ordered them stopped. He never gave a reason for this action, but his order was obeyed nonetheless, and the remaining &quot;convicts&quot; rejoined their fellow prisoners.<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a></p>
<p>The King's Mountain victors and their prisoners returned to McDowell's estate early on the morning of October 10, 1780. From there, the various commanders and their men went their separate ways. Shelby and his men joined General <a href="Daniel_Morgan" title="wikilink">Daniel Morgan</a> at New Providence, South Carolina. While there, Shelby advised Morgan to take Fort Ninety-Six and Augusta because he believed the British forces there were supplying the <a href="Cherokee" class="uri" title="wikilink">Cherokee</a> with weapons for their raids against colonial settlers. Morgan agreed to the plan, as did General <a href="Horatio_Gates" title="wikilink">Horatio Gates</a>, the supreme commander of colonial forces in the region. Assured that his plan would be carried out, Shelby returned home and promised to return the following spring with 300 men. On his way to Fort Ninety-Six, Morgan was attacked by <a href="Banastre_Tarleton" title="wikilink">Banastre Tarleton</a> and gained a decisive victory over him at the <a href="Battle_of_Cowpens" title="wikilink">Battle of Cowpens</a>. Shelby later lamented the fact that General <a href="Nathanael_Greene" title="wikilink">Nathanael Greene</a>, who relieved Gates only days after Shelby departed for home, claimed the lion's share of the credit for Cowpens when it was Shelby's plan that had put Morgan in the position to begin with.<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a></p>

<p>Upon his return home, Shelby and his father were named commissioners to negotiate a treaty between colonial settlers and the Chickamauga.<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a> This service delayed his return to Greene, but in October 1781 he and Sevier led 600 riflemen to join Greene in South Carolina.<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a> Greene had thought to use Shelby's and Sevier's men to prevent Cornwallis from returning to <a href="Charleston,_South_Carolina" title="wikilink">Charleston</a>.

<p>One of Shelby's chief concerns was securing federal aid to defend the frontier.<a href="#fn80" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref80"><sup>80</sup></a> Although Kentuckians were engaged in <a href="Northwest_Indian_War" title="wikilink">an undeclared war</a> with American Indians north of the <a href="Ohio_River" title="wikilink">Ohio River</a>, Shelby had been ordered by <a href="United_States_Secretary_of_War" title="wikilink">Secretary of War</a> <a href="Henry_Knox" title="wikilink">Henry Knox</a> not to conduct offensive military actions against the Indians.<a href="#fn81" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref81"><sup>81</sup></a> Furthermore, he was limited by federal regulations that restricted the service of state militiamen to thirty days, which was too short to be effective.<a href="#fn82" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref82"><sup>82</sup></a> With the meager resources of his fledgling state he was only able to defend the most vulnerable areas from Indian attack.<a href="#fn83" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref83"><sup>83</sup></a> Meanwhile, Kentuckians suspected that the Indians were being stirred up and supplied by the British.<a href="#fn84" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref84"><sup>84</sup></a></p>
<p>Shelby appealed to President Washington for help; Washington responded by appointing General &quot;Mad&quot; <a href="Anthony_Wayne" title="wikilink">Anthony Wayne</a> to the area with orders to push the Indians out of the <a href="Northwest_Territory" title="wikilink">Northwest Territory</a>. Wayne arrived at Fort Washington (present-day <a href="Cincinnati,_Ohio" title="wikilink">Cincinnati, Ohio</a>) in May 1793, but was prevented from taking any immediate action because federal commissioners were still attempting to negotiate a treaty with the Indians. He called for 1,000 volunteer troops from Kentucky, but few heeded the call and Shelby resorted to <a href="conscription" class="uri" title="wikilink">conscription</a>. By the time the soldiers arrived, winter had set in. He ordered the men to go home and return in the spring.<a href="#fn85" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref85"><sup>85</sup></a></p>
<p>After a winter filled with Indian attacks, including one which claimed the life of Shelby's younger brother Evan Shelby III, Kentucky militia units won some minor victories over the Indians in early 1794.<a href="#fn86" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref86"><sup>86</sup></a> In spring the response to Wayne's call for troops was more enthusiastic; 1,600 volunteers mustered at <a href="Greenville,_Ohio" title="wikilink">Fort Greenville</a> and were hastily trained.<a href="#fn87" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref87"><sup>87</sup></a> By August, 1794, Wayne was on the offensive against the Indians and dealt them a decisive blow at the August 20, 1794 <a href="Battle_of_Fallen_Timbers" title="wikilink">Battle of Fallen Timbers</a>.<a href="#fn88" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref88"><sup>88</sup></a> This victory, and the ensuing <a href="Treaty_of_Greenville" title="wikilink">Treaty of Greenville</a>, secured the territory, and although Shelby did not agree with some of the restrictions placed upon western settlers by this treaty, he abided by its terms and enforced those that were under his jurisdiction.<a href="#fn89" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref89"><sup>89</sup></a></p>
<p>Another major concern of the Shelby administration was free navigation on the <a href="Mississippi_River" title="wikilink">Mississippi River</a>, which was vital to the state's economic interests. For political reasons the Spanish had closed the port at <a href="New_Orleans,_Louisiana" title="wikilink">New Orleans</a> to the Americans. This would have been the natural market for the tobacco, flour and hemp grown by Kentucky farmers; overland routes were too expensive to be profitable. This made it difficult for land speculators to entice immigration to the area to turn a profit on their investments. Many Kentuckians felt the federal government was not acting decisively or quickly enough to remedy this situation.<a href="#fn90" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref90"><sup>90</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="citizen-genu00eat-affair">Citizen Gen&lt;U+00EA&gt;t affair</h3>
<p>While Kentuckians despised the British and Spanish, they had a strong affinity for the French. They admired the <a href="Republicanism" title="wikilink">republican</a> government that had arisen from the <a href="French_Revolution" title="wikilink">French Revolution</a>, and they had not forgotten France's aid during the Revolutionary War. When French Ambassador <a href="Edmond-Charles_Gen&lt;U+00EA&gt;t" title="wikilink">Edmond-Charles Gen&lt;U+00EA&gt;t</a>, popularly known as Citizen Gen&lt;U+00EA&gt;t, arrived in the United States in April 1793, <a href="George_Rogers_Clark" title="wikilink">George Rogers Clark</a> was already considering an expedition to capture Spanish lands in the west. Gen&lt;U+00EA&gt;t's agent, <a href="Andr&lt;U+00E9&gt;_Michaux" title="wikilink">Andr&lt;U+00E9&gt; Michaux</a>, was dispatched to Kentucky to assess the support of Kentuckians toward Clark's expedition. When he gained an audience with Governor Shelby, he did so with letters of introduction from <a href="United_States_Secretary_of_State" title="wikilink">Secretary of State</a> <a href="Thomas_Jefferson" title="wikilink">Thomas Jefferson</a> and Kentucky Senator <a href="John_Brown_(Kentucky)" title="wikilink">John Brown</a>.<a href="#fn91" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref91"><sup>91</sup></a></p>
<p><img src="Edmond-Charles_Gen&lt;U+00EA&gt;t.png" title="fig:Edmond-Charles Gen&lt;U+00EA&gt;t - Shelby was warned not to aid his schemes." alt="Edmond-Charles Gen&lt;U+00EA&gt;t - Shelby was warned not to aid his schemes." /> Jefferson had written a separate letter to Shelby warning him against aiding the French schemes and informing him that negotiations were under way with the Spanish regarding trade on the Mississippi. When the letter was sent on August 29, 1793, it was Jefferson's intent that it reach Shelby before Michaux did, but Shelby did not receive it until October 1793. On September 13, 1793, Michaux met with Shelby, but there is no evidence that Shelby agreed to help him. In his response to Jefferson's delayed letter, Shelby assured Jefferson that Kentuckians &quot;possess too just a sense of the obligation they owe the General Government, to embark in any enterprise that would be so injurious to the United States&quot;.<a href="#fn92" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref92"><sup>92</sup></a></p>
<p>In November 1793, Shelby received a letter from another of Gen&lt;U+00EA&gt;t's agents, Charles Delpeau. He confided to Shelby that he had been sent to secure supplies for an expedition against Spanish holdings, and inquired whether Shelby had been instructed to arrest individuals associated with such a scheme. Three days later Shelby responded by letter, relating Jefferson's warning against aiding the French. Despite having no evidence that Shelby was party to Gen&lt;U+00EA&gt;t's scheme, both Jefferson and Knox felt compelled to warn him a second time. Jefferson provided names and descriptions of the French agents believed to be in Kentucky and encouraged their arrest. Knox went a step further by suggesting Kentucky would be reimbursed for any costs incurred resisting the French by force, should such action become necessary. General Anthony Wayne informed him that his cavalry was at the state's disposal. <a href="Arthur_St._Clair" title="wikilink">Arthur St. Clair</a>, governor of the American <a href="Northwest_Territory" title="wikilink">Northwest Territory</a>, also admonished Shelby against cooperation with Gen&lt;U+00EA&gt;t.<a href="#fn93" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref93"><sup>93</sup></a></p>
<p>In his response to Jefferson, Shelby questioned whether he had the legal authority to intervene with force against his constituency and expressed his personal aversion to doing so.</p>

<p>Shelby tempered this lukewarm commitment by assuring Jefferson that &quot;I shall, at all times, hold it my duty to perform whatever may be constitutionally required of me, as Governor of Kentucky, by the President of the United States.&quot;<a href="#fn94" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref94"><sup>94</sup></a></p>
<p>In March 1794, perhaps in response to Shelby's concerns, Congress passed a measure granting the government additional powers in the event of an invasion or insurrection. Jefferson's successor <a href="Edmund_Randolph" title="wikilink">Edmund Randolph</a>, who actually received Shelby's letter, wrote Shelby to inform him of the new powers at his disposal, and informing him that the new regime in France had recalled Gen&lt;U+00EA&gt;t. Two months later Gen&lt;U+00EA&gt;t's agents ceased their operations in Kentucky and the potential crisis was averted.<a href="#fn95" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref95"><sup>95</sup></a> In 1795, President Washington negotiated an agreement with the Spanish that secured the right of Americans to trade on the river.<a href="#fn96" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref96"><sup>96</sup></a></p>
<p>Having successfully dealt with the major challenges and issues involved in forming a new state government, Shelby left the state safe and financially sound.<a href="#fn97" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref97"><sup>97</sup></a> Kentucky's constitution prevented a governor from serving consecutive terms, so Shelby retired to Traveler's Rest, his Lincoln County estate, at the conclusion of his term in 1796.<a href="#fn98" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref98"><sup>98</sup></a> For the next 15 years he tended to affairs on his farm.<a href="#fn99" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref99"><sup>99</sup></a> He was selected as a <a href="Electoral_College_(United_States)" title="wikilink">presidential elector</a> in six consecutive elections, but these were his only appearances in public life during this period.<a href="#fn100" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref100"><sup>100</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="second-term-as-governor">Second term as governor</h2>
<p><a href="Gabriel_Slaughter" title="wikilink">Gabriel Slaughter</a> was the favorite choice for governor of Kentucky in 1812. Only one impediment to his potential candidacy existed. Growing tensions between the United States, France, and Great Britain threatened to break into open war. With this prospect looming, Isaac Shelby's name began circulating as a possible candidate for governor. Slaughter, who lived near Shelby, visited him and asked whether he would run. Shelby assured him that he had no desire to do so unless a national emergency that required his leadership emerged. Satisfied with this answer, Slaughter began his campaign.<a href="#fn101" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref101"><sup>101</sup></a></p>
<p>The situation with the European powers grew worse, and on June 18, 1812 the United States declared war on Great Britain, beginning the <a href="War_of_1812" title="wikilink">War of 1812</a>. Cries grew louder for Shelby to return as Kentucky's chief executive. On July 18, 1812, less than a month before the election, Shelby acquiesced and announced his candidacy.<a href="#fn102" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref102"><sup>102</sup></a></p>
<p>During the campaign Shelby's political enemies, notably <a href="Humphrey_Marshall_(Senator)" title="wikilink">Humphrey Marshall</a>, criticized his response to Jefferson's second letter regarding the Gen&lt;U+00EA&gt;t affair and questioned his loyalty to the United States.<a href="#fn103" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref103"><sup>103</sup></a> Shelby contended that his noncommittal response to the letter was meant to draw the federal government's attention to the situation in the west.<a href="#fn104" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref104"><sup>104</sup></a> He cited the agreement between Washington and the Spanish as evidence that his ploy had worked.<a href="#fn105" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref105"><sup>105</sup></a> He also claimed to have known at the time he wrote the letter that the French scheme was destined to fail.<a href="#fn106" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref106"><sup>106</sup></a></p>
<p>Slaughter's supporters mocked Shelby's advanced age (he was almost 62), calling him &quot;Old Daddy Shelby&quot;. One Kentucky paper even printed an anonymous charge that Shelby had run from the Battle of King's Mountain. Though few even among Shelby's enemies believed the story, his supporters and Shelby himself responded through missives in the state's newspapers. One supporter typified these responses, writing &quot;It is reported that Colonel Shelby 'run [sic] at King's Mountain.' True he did. He first run [sic] up to the enemy... then after an action of about forty-seven minutes, he run [sic] again with 900 prisoners.&quot;<a href="#fn107" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref107"><sup>107</sup></a></p>
<p>As the canvass stretched into August, Shelby grew more confident of victory and began preparations to return to the state house. He predicted a victory of 10,000 votes; the final margin was more than 17,000.<a href="#fn108" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref108"><sup>108</sup></a> When he took the oath of office, Shelby became the first Kentucky governor to serve non-consecutive terms. (<a href="James_Garrard" title="wikilink">James Garrard</a> had been permitted to serve consecutive terms in 1796 and 1800 by special legislative exemption.)</p>

Two days before his inauguration, he and outgoing governor Charles Scott met at the state house to appoint William Henry Harrison commander of the Kentucky militia. This was done in violation of a constitutional mandate that the post be held by a native Kentuckian. Already commander of the militias of <a href="Indiana" class="uri" title="wikilink">Indiana</a> and <a href="Illinois" class="uri" title="wikilink">Illinois</a>, Harrison picked up Kentucky volunteers at <a href="Newport,_Kentucky" title="wikilink">Newport</a> before hurrying to the defense of <a href="Fort_Wayne" title="wikilink">Fort Wayne</a>.<a href="#fn109" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref109"><sup>109</sup></a></p>
