<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>Al Hajj was captured in Pakistan, on <a href="December_15" title="wikilink">December 15</a> <a href="2001" class="uri" title="wikilink">2001</a>.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> He was on his way to work in Afghanistan as a cameraman for <a href="Al_Jazeera" title="wikilink">Al Jazeera</a> and had a legitimate visa. But he is held as an &quot;<a href="enemy_combatant" title="wikilink">enemy combatant</a>&quot;.</p>
<p>A special report by BBC Radio 4 gave an exclusive glimpse of the world inside Guantanamo Bay detention centre, told through the letters of a Sami al-Hajj.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>British human rights lawyer <a href="Clive_Stafford_Smith" title="wikilink">Clive Stafford Smith</a> represents Al Hajj, and was able to visit him in 2005. According to Smith Al Hajj reported:</p>
<ul>
<li>He has been beaten. Smith said he had a huge scar on his face.</li>
<li>Al Hajj witnessed guards flushing a Koran down a toilet.</li>
<li>Al Hajj witnessed guards defacing a Koran with swear words.</li>
<li>He has been sexually assaulted.</li>
<li>He has been interrogated roughly 130 times.</li>
</ul>
<p>On <a href="23_November" title="wikilink">23 November</a> <a href="2005" class="uri" title="wikilink">2005</a>, Stafford-Smith reported that, during (125 of 130) interviews, U.S. officials had questioned Sami as to whether Al Jazeera was a front for <a href="al-Qaeda" class="uri" title="wikilink">al-Qaeda</a>.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>Smith offered the opinion:</p>
<dl>

<dd><em>&quot;He is completely innocent. He is about as much of a terrorist as my granddad. The only reason he has been treated like he has is because he is an Aljazeera journalist. The Americans have tried to make him an informant with the goal of getting him to say that Aljazeera is linked to al-Qaida.&quot;</em>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Al-Jazeera has responded that al-Hajj reported his <a href="passport" class="uri" title="wikilink">passport</a> stolen in Sudan in 1999, and that anything done with the passport after that date was likely the work of <a href="identity_theft" title="wikilink">identity thieves</a>.</p>
<p><a href="Reporters_Without_Borders" title="wikilink">Reporters Without Borders</a> have repeatedly expressed concern over Al-Haj's detention mentioned Al-Haj in their annual <a href="Reporters_Without_Borders#Worldwide_press_freedom_index" title="wikilink">worldwide press feedom Index</a>, and launched a petition for his release.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a><a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a><a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a><a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a><a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> Al Hajj has recently been on hunger strike along with a few other inmates in protest of their treatment in Guantanamo<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="combatant-status-review-tribunal">Combatant Status Review Tribunal</h2>

<p>Initially the Bush administration asserted that they could withhold all the protections of the <a href="Geneva_Conventions" title="wikilink">Geneva Conventions</a> to captives from the <a href="War_on_Terrorism" title="wikilink">War on Terror</a>. This policy was challenged before the Judicial branch. Critics argued that the USA could not evade its obligation to conduct <a href="competent_tribunal" title="wikilink">competent tribunals</a> to determine whether captives are, or are not, entitled to the protections of <a href="prisoner_of_war" title="wikilink">prisoner of war</a> status.</p>
<p>Subsequently the <a href="Department_of_Defense" title="wikilink">Department of Defense</a> instituted the <a href="Combatant_Status_Review_Tribunal" title="wikilink">Combatant Status Review Tribunals</a>. The Tribunals, however, were not authorized to determine whether the captives were <em>lawful combatants</em> -- rather they were merely empowered to make a recommendation as to whether the captive had previously been correctly determined to match the Bush administration's definition of an <a href="enemy_combatant" title="wikilink">enemy combatant</a>.</p>
<p>Although Clive Stafford Smith quotes from Al Hajj's Combatant Status Review Tribunal it does not seem to be present in the transcripts the DoD released on <a href="March_3" title="wikilink">March 3</a> <a href="2006" class="uri" title="wikilink">2006</a>.</p>
<h3 id="allegations">Allegations</h3>
<p>Stafford-Smith summarized the allegations from Al Hajj's <a href="Combatant_Status_Review_Tribunal" title="wikilink">Combatant Status Review Tribunal</a>:<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>

<dd>''&quot;...that he had allegedly run a website that supported terrorism, that he had trafficked in arms, that he entered Afghanistan illegally in October 2001 while US air strikes were under way, and that he interviewed Osama bin Laden.&quot;
</dd>
</dl>
<p>A biography of Al Hajj, by one of his Al-Jazeera colleagues, paraphrases five allegations from his CSRT:<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li>''&quot;The US says that Sami travelled to the middle East, the Balkans, and the Caucasus for clandestine purposes.</li>
<li>''&quot;The US says that Sami has an internet site that supports terrorists.</li>
<li>''&quot;The US says that Sami is a businessman who sold Stinger missiles to Chechen rebels.</li>
<li>''&quot;The US says that Sami was caught sneaking into Afghanistan.</li>
<li>''&quot;The US says Sami interviewed OBL.&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="Ahmad_Ibrahim" title="wikilink">Ahmad Ibrahim</a>, Al Hajj's colleague who wrote the biography, says all these allegations are false.</p>
<h2 id="administrative-review-board-hearing">Administrative Review Board hearing</h2>
<p>Prisoners who were determined to have been properly classified as &quot;enemy combatants&quot; were scheduled to have their dossier reviewed at annual <a href="Administrative_Review_Board" title="wikilink">Administrative Review Board</a> hearings. The Administrative Review Boards weren't authorized to review whether a prisoner qualified for POW status, and they weren't authorized to review whether a prisoner should have been classified as an &quot;enemy combatant&quot;.</p>
<p>They were authorized to consider whether a prisoner should continue to be detained by the United States, because they continued to pose a threat -- or whether they could safely be repatriated to the custody of their home country, or whether they could be set free.</p>
<p>Al Hajj chose to participate in his Administrative Review Board hearing.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="factors-for-and-against-al-hajjs-continued-detention">Factors for and against Al Hajj's continued detention</h3>

<h3 id="al-hajju2019s-initial-statement">Al Hajj&lt;U+2019&gt;s initial statement</h3>
<ul>
<li>Al Hajj first thanked the Board for meeting with him.</li>
<li>He then spoke about the pain of being separated from his wife and young children.</li>
<li>He then expressed confusion over how he came to be classified as an enemy combatant, but said he wasn&lt;U+2019&gt;t bitter, and hoped he could convince the Board that he was not a threat and should be set free.</li>
<li>Al Hajj then condemned terrorism in all its forms and assured the Board he had never taken part in or supported any terrorists or terrorist acts. He assured the Board that, according to his understanding of Islam, terrorist acts were strictly prohibited.</li>
<li>Al Hajj said he didn&lt;U+2019&gt;t think he should return to journalism, following his release, as it had proven too dangerous.</li>
<li>He expressed concern over his wife, he said remaining in Azerbaijan, the country of her birth would be dangerous to her.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="al-hajju2019s-answers-to-questions-posed-at-his-arb-hearing">Al Hajj&lt;U+2019&gt;s answers to questions posed at his ARB hearing</h3>
<p>In answer to questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Al Hajj said that mail to and from his wife was extremely intermittent. That during one period he went a full year without any word from her. Al Hajj&lt;U+2019&gt;s hearing was in late August 2005. He said his last letter from his wife was in May 2005. He said he was unaware of her receiving any financial support.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Al Hajj indicated that, on the advice of his lawyer, he was going to decline answering questions about his relationship to Al Haramayn, Abu Wafa, Mamdouh Mahmoud Saleem, SAMICO Services, his past travels. He did indicate that the <a href="Union_Beverage_Company" title="wikilink">Union Beverage Company</a> was a large company, with operations around the World.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>When Al Hajj was asked: if he had said that a true interpretation of Islam would not condone violence against innocent people, like the 9/11 attack, he answered in the affirmative.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>When Al Hajj was asked why his foot was in a cast, he said simply he fell down.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The Presiding Officer congratulated Al Hajj for being designated one of the compliant detainees who were allowed to wear white uniforms. He then asked Al Hajj what he would like to do if he were released. Al Hajj replied he would like to live in Sudan, where he would work in his family&lt;U+2019&gt;s business.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The Board Members seemed understanding about Al Hajj following his lawyer's advice not to answer questions. However, they also proposed that he would feel disappointed if he faced continued detention because of his declining to answer.</li>

<ul>
<li>Smith said Sami was not a clandestine financial courier. But: ''&quot;...he and his wife once carried $220,000 from Qatar to Azerbaijan for his boss at the beverage company - and that he even declared the cash to customs.</li>
