<p>Born 5 December 1928, in <a href="Buffalo,_New_York" title="wikilink">Buffalo, New York</a>,<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> Meyers attended public schools and in 1950 earned a <a href="Bachelor_of_Science" title="wikilink">Bachelor of Science</a> in <a href="engineering" class="uri" title="wikilink">engineering</a> and in 1954 a <a href="Master_of_Science" title="wikilink">Master of Science</a> <a href="Latin_honors" title="wikilink">magna cum laude</a> in business from <a href="Carnegie_Mellon_University" title="wikilink">Carnegie Mellon University</a>.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a><a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> He joined the <a href="Ford_Motor_Company" title="wikilink">Ford Motor Company</a> in 1950, but his work at the automaker was cut by military service.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> Meyers was an officer in the <a href="U.S._Air_Force" title="wikilink">U.S. Air Force</a> during the <a href="Korean_War" title="wikilink">Korean War</a>.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>

<p>In 1962 Meyers was appointed Director of Purchasing for <a href="American_Motors_Corporation" title="wikilink">American Motors Corporation</a> in <a href="Detroit" class="uri" title="wikilink">Detroit</a>. He was promoted to Director of Manufacturing, Vice-President of Manufacturing, Vice-President of the Product (Engineering) Group, and Executive Vice-President. In charge of product development, Meyers introduced AMC's innovative &quot;AMC Buyer Protection Plan&quot; that included the industry's first 12-month or  bumper-to-bumper <a href="warranty" class="uri" title="wikilink">warranty</a>.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> The number of models was reduced to remove basic, stripped versions, but the centerpiece was improved quality during the production, although Meyers said &quot;I don't claim we've magically and finally licked all the problems of the assembly line.&quot;<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> Other improvements included mechanical upgrades to increase durability and quality, as well as improved standard equipment levels.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> By 1973, Meyers was pushing the development of the <a href="Wankel_engine" title="wikilink">Wankel engine</a> for installation into an AMC car within two years, possibility of going independent of GM's rotary engineering work, but he ruled out AMC producing the new engine itself.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> While Meyers was AMC's top product man, he was &quot;given considerable, and justifiable, credit for pushing the AMX/3 project from inception through the design and prototype stages into testing.&quot;<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<p>A major management transition at AMC stated on 24 May 1977, then Meyers was named president and Chief Operating Officer, succeeding the retiring William Luneburg.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> Although, Meyers was the executive who had been against AMC's purchase of Jeep in 1970 (of which the press kept reminding him), he was now one of Jeep's biggest proponents.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<p>Upon the retirement of <a href="Roy_D._Chapin_Jr." title="wikilink">Roy D. Chapin Jr.</a> on 21 October 1977, Meyers became Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> At the time, Meyers was 49 years old and became the youngest top executive in the automobile industry bringing a wealth of manufacturing experience.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> &quot;The company was looking for a lot more than a steady hand on the tiller &lt;U+2014&gt; it was looking for a savior&quot; but Meyers disagreed and argued that the company could survive and remain a factor in the automobile industry by abandoning its policy of head-on competition and instead focusing on and revamping its four-wheel-drive vehicles, a market segment left untended by the large automakers, and by acquiring advanced technology.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
<p>For fiscal 1977, AMC's profits more than doubled compared to the previous year to a record $83.9 million on sales of $3.1 billion.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> The smallest U.S. automaker saw its car sales increase 37%, while they dropped 21% for the industry as a whole..<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> Meyers described AMC strategy as a &quot;three-legged stool&quot; of small cars, Jeeps, and steady government and military contracts.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> By 1979, the automaker's management team headed by Meyers, ... &quot;sharply cut back its money-losing car operations ... The perennially ailing baby of the auto industry suddenly looks healthy, and its new management team has a clear design for the future.&quot;<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1979, Meyers formed a partnership with the French state-owned <a href="Renault" class="uri" title="wikilink">Renault</a>, which bought 22.5 percent of AMC stock.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> However, the U.S. economy continued to decline through 1981, and AMC now held on to only two percent of the domestic market and lost about $300 million during the previous two years.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> Meyers had acknowledged that AMC had no hope of raising the $6 billion it needed to finance more competitive products, stating &quot;It would take dough that just isn't in the cards for us,&quot; so the company staked its future on help from Renault, which included development of the <a href="Renault_Alliance" title="wikilink">Renault Alliance</a> sub-compact for production in Kenosha, Wisconsin.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> In early 1982, AMC asked its 16,000 hourly workers for wage concessions that would save the automaker $150 million.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a></p>
<p>At age 53, Meyers retired from the company in February 1982, by which time Renault controlled 46 percent of American Motors.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> He was with the automaker 20 years and was noted for orchestrating &quot;the complicated linkup between AMC and Renault starting in 1979.&quot;<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> Meyers was succeeded as chairman by former AMC President W. Paul Tippett Jr.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> At the time, Tippett was a member of AMC management for only three years.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a></p>
