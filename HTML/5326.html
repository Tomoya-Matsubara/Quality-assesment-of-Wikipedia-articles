<p><strong><em>A Very Merry Unauthorized Children's Scientology Pageant</em></strong> is a <a href="satire" title="wikilink">satirical</a> <a href="musical_theatre" title="wikilink">musical</a> about <a href="Scientology" class="uri" title="wikilink">Scientology</a> and <a href="L._Ron_Hubbard" title="wikilink">L. Ron Hubbard</a>, written by <a href="Kyle_Jarrow" title="wikilink">Kyle Jarrow</a> from a concept by <a href="Alex_Timbers" title="wikilink">Alex Timbers</a>, the show's original director. The musical runs for an hour in duration, and consists of one act.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a><a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> Jarrow based the story of the musical on L. Ron Hubbard's writings and <a href="Church_of_Scientology" title="wikilink">Church of Scientology</a> literature. Early on in the production of the musical, the president of the Church of Scientology in New York sent a letter to the producer pointing out the <a href="Scientology_and_the_legal_system" title="wikilink">Church's history of litigation</a>. This led Timbers and Jarrow's attorneys to advise them to insert the word &quot;Unauthorized&quot; into the title of the play.</p>
<p>The musical follows the life of L. Ron Hubbard as he develops <a href="Dianetics" class="uri" title="wikilink">Dianetics</a> and then <a href="Scientology" class="uri" title="wikilink">Scientology</a>. Though the musical pokes fun at Hubbard's <a href="science_fiction" title="wikilink">science fiction</a> writing and personal beliefs, it has been called a &quot;deadpan presentation&quot; of his life story.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> Topics explored in the piece include Dianetics, the <a href="E-meter" class="uri" title="wikilink">E-meter</a>, <a href="Thetan" title="wikilink">Thetans</a>, and the story of <a href="Xenu" class="uri" title="wikilink">Xenu</a>. The show was originally presented by Les Freres Corbusier, an experimental theatrical troupe and debuted in November 2003 in <a href="New_York_City" title="wikilink">New York City</a>, where it had sold-out <a href="Off-Off-Broadway" class="uri" title="wikilink">Off-Off-Broadway</a> and <a href="Off-Broadway" class="uri" title="wikilink">Off-Broadway</a> productions. Later performances have included <a href="Los_Angeles,_California" title="wikilink">Los Angeles</a>, New York, <a href="Boston,_Massachusetts" title="wikilink">Boston</a>, <a href="Atlanta,_Georgia" title="wikilink">Atlanta</a> and <a href="Philadelphia,_Pennsylvania" title="wikilink">Philadelphia</a>. During the Los Angeles production, representatives of the Church of Scientology visited the production staff in the midst of rehearsals, and handed out documentation of prior successful litigation against <a href="Scientology_controversy" title="wikilink">critics of Scientology</a>. Parents of some of the Los Angeles cast members also received phone calls from Scientologists in the entertainment industry, asking them not to allow their children perform in the musical.</p>
<p>The productions of <em>A Very Merry Unauthorized Children's Scientology Pageant</em> in 2003, 2004 and 2006 were well received. The musical received an <a href="Obie_Award" title="wikilink">Obie Award</a> for the 2003 New York production, and director Alex Timbers received a Garland Award for the 2004 Los Angeles production. The play also received positive reviews in the press. <em><a href="The_New_York_Times" title="wikilink">The New York Times</a></em> characterized it as a &quot;<a href="cult_following" title="wikilink">cult-hit</a>,&quot; and <em><a href="The_Village_Voice" title="wikilink">The Village Voice</a></em> put the play on a par with <em><a href="The_Resistible_Rise_of_Arturo_Ui" title="wikilink">The Resistible Rise of Arturo Ui</a></em>. <em><a href="The_Los_Angeles_Times" title="wikilink">The Los Angeles Times</a></em> and <em><a href="The_Guardian" title="wikilink">The Guardian</a></em> gave the 2004 production favorable reviews, and <em><a href="Variety_(magazine)" title="wikilink">Variety</a></em> and <em><a href="The_Boston_Globe" title="wikilink">The Boston Globe</a></em> had kind words for the updated 2006 edition. A 2004 <a href="cast_recording" title="wikilink">cast recording</a> was released by <a href="Sh-K-Boom_Records" title="wikilink">Sh-K-Boom Records</a>, and the <a href="compact_disc" title="wikilink">CD</a> release received four out of five stars from <a href="All_Music_Guide" title="wikilink">All Music Guide</a> and positive mention in <em><a href="The_Los_Angeles_Daily_News" title="wikilink">The Los Angeles Daily News</a></em>.</p>
<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>Alex Timbers initially developed the concept and directed the play, while Kyle Jarrow wrote the accompanying book, music and lyrics.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> Jarrow's script was &quot;almost entirely based on Hubbard's own writings and the church's literature,&quot;<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> though Jarrow was also influenced by critical journalistic accounts.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> Timbers explained to <em><a href="Variety_(magazine)" title="wikilink">Variety</a></em> why they chose to stick to Church of Scientology primary source material for background on the script, stating: &quot;We thought that the best way to satirize the Church of Scientology was to let the Church speak for itself.&quot;<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> Jarrow was initially motivated to write the script by what he saw as a shift in religious teachings - from an old model involving <a href="hell" class="uri" title="wikilink">hell</a> and retribution, to a new system of thought promising money or peace.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> Jarrow commented on Timbers' initial idea of using children to tell a story about Scientology: &quot;I did a lot of work on cults in college, and what I learned is that they sort of turn you into a child by appealing to that part of you that wants to be taken care of and given answers. And so it all began to make sense to me.&quot;<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> During production, the producers were cognizant of the potential for ignorance about some of the content being depicted in the play, and the creative team worked with cast members to educate them about the background behind what they were performing. On preparing cast members for the play, Jarrow stated: &quot;Kids shouldn't just be saying things that they don't understand. That's what we're criticizing...people who just parrot behavior and language. We wanted to have an honest conversation with them.&quot;<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<p>The producers deliberately wanted the musical to appear like a &quot;corny and low-rent production.&quot;<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> The ensemble includes ten actors from ages eight to twelve.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a><a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> Though professionals, the child actors perform with a &quot;realistic lack of polish&quot;, as they are actually playing non-professional children of <a href="Scientologist" title="wikilink">Scientologists</a>, performing in a holiday <a href="pageant" class="uri" title="wikilink">pageant</a>.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> The chorus portrays <a href="Thetan" title="wikilink">Thetans</a>, and the reactive and analytical portions of the mind are depicted by two children who share a <a href="Conjoined_twins" title="wikilink">conjoined</a> <a href="right_brain" title="wikilink">right brain</a> costume.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a><a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> During the Xenu story the narrator is outfitted in a cardboard robot suit, and the actor portraying Xenu wears a &quot;tacky headdress.&quot;<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> Staging, costumes and <a href="set_design" title="wikilink">set design</a> are all made to appear to be the &quot;earnest work of schoolteachers and supportive parents trying to provide a colorful and cheery atmosphere on a small budget.&quot;<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> The stage design includes a &quot;colorful, crayon-colored backdrop of space age-like, semi-circular set pieces.&quot;<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> Costumes include white robes and rainbow-striped socks.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> Props used to denote locations include &quot;a waving cardboard palm frond for Hawaii, a street sign and cell phones for New York.&quot;<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> The play ends with a <a href="Tableau_vivant" title="wikilink">tableau vivant</a>, where the audience sees the cast standing at the back of the theater holding candles and singing cheerfully as a door closes and they are blocked from view.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a></p>
<p>Early in the production of the play, John Carmichael, president of the Church of Scientology in New York, found out that a theatrical production involving Scientology was in the works.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> After showing up unannounced to a rehearsal, Carmichael sent a letter to the play's New York producer, Aaron Lemon-Strauss, citing his concerns at the possibility of being ridiculed.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a><a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> In the letter, Carmichael also pointed out the church's many past lawsuits.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> Alex Timbers was quoted as saying: &quot;We've been told that the letter is a precursor to a lawsuit.&quot;<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> Carmichael visited the artistic staff a total of three times to voice his concerns before the play's debut.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> After this occurrence, Jarrow and Timbers' attorneys advised them to insert the word &quot;Unauthorized&quot; into the title of the play.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a><a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> This move was done in order to avoid potential <a href="Scientology_and_the_legal_system" title="wikilink">litigation from the Church of Scientology</a>.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a><a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> In an interview with <em>The New York Times</em>, Carmichael later stated: &quot;These folks have a right to write whatever play they want.. but they've sunk to cliches.&quot;<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a></p>

<p>The characters gather on a cold winter night to rejoice in telling the story of L. Ron Hubbard &quot;Hey!

<p>Hubbard thanks the analytical mind (portrayed by two characters) for helping him to find the answers he was searching for, and proclaims: &quot;Thinking rationally is the way to be happy and the key to learning more.&quot;<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> He announces to his followers, &quot;You'll operate with your analytical mind only....

<h2 id="musical-analysis">Musical analysis</h2>
<p>In developing the music for the play, Kyle Jarrow incorporated themes from <em><a href="The_Road_to_Freedom" title="wikilink">The Road to Freedom</a></em>, a 1986 <a href="pop_music" title="wikilink">pop</a> album which featured performances from <a href="John_Travolta" title="wikilink">John Travolta</a>, <a href="Leif_Garrett" title="wikilink">Leif Garrett</a>, <a href="Frank_Stallone" title="wikilink">Frank Stallone</a>, <a href="Chick_Correa" title="wikilink">Chick Correa</a>, and <a href="Karen_Black" title="wikilink">Karen Black</a>, because the lyrics to the album were written by <a href="L._Ron_Hubbard" title="wikilink">L. Ron Hubbard</a>.<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a> Jarrow also incorporated musical themes from <a href="Music_history_of_the_United_States_(1980s_to_the_present)" title="wikilink">1980s pop</a>, explaining: &quot;..the liturgical music of Scientology is 1980s pop, which seems strangely appropriate because of the science fiction books. So that's what we did [in the show]. It's a pastiche of synth-pop and pageant choir music.&quot;<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a> The song, &quot;Hey! It's a Happy Day!&quot; contains an excerpted quote from Hubbard's <em>Scientology: A New Slant On Life</em>.<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a></p>
<p>Songs are set to &quot;cheesy synth-keyboard backing&quot; and feature &quot;sublimely clunky dance breaks.&quot;<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a> An electronic score emphasizes the musical's &quot;loony conviction,&quot; and sleigh bells are incorporated into the music which give the play a feeling of a &quot;jazzed-up saint's play.&quot;<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a> The songs also incorporate <a href="video_game_music" title="wikilink">video game music</a>, and &quot;beats from a child's keyboard synthesizer with the otherworldly sound of the symphonic band Polyphonic Spree.&quot;<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a></p>

A review in the <em><a href="The_New_York_Times" title="wikilink">The New York Times</a></em> described the play as having a &quot;crude, faux-na&lt;U+00EF&gt;f sensibility&quot;, and stated that it &quot;provides a cult-hit blueprint for a young generation that prefers its irony delivered with not a wink but a blank stare.&quot;<a href="#fn90" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref90"><sup>90</sup></a> A 2003 review in New York City's <em><a href="The_Village_Voice" title="wikilink">The Village Voice</a></em> compared the play to <em><a href="The_Resistible_Rise_of_Arturo_Ui" title="wikilink">The Resistible Rise of Arturo Ui</a></em>, stating: &quot;Just as Ui doesn't explain the complex phenomenon of the Third Reich, Scientology Pageant doesn't probe the psychology of cults; instead, both demystify subjects whose appeal stems in no small part from the mystique their acolytes have attributed to them.&quot;<a href="#fn91" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref91"><sup>91</sup></a> Though most of the media reception of the play was positive, New York Church President John Carmichael did not have kind words for the production. Carmichael asserted that L. Ron Hubbard was portrayed in the play as &quot;an authoritarian demagogue whose methods create emotionless followers.&quot;<a href="#fn92" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref92"><sup>92</sup></a> Other critics complained that the young members of the cast were portraying characters and depicting content that they could not understand.<a href="#fn93" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref93"><sup>93</sup></a></p>
<p>The <em><a href="Los_Angeles_Times" title="wikilink">Los Angeles Times</a></em> reviewed the play in 2004, and stated that: &quot;The show found a New York audience willing to move from the tongue-in-cheek children's pageant concept to something that became startlingly adult.&quot;<a href="#fn94" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref94"><sup>94</sup></a> In a 2004 review in <em><a href="The_Guardian" title="wikilink">The Guardian</a></em>, the article cited notable quotes from other reviews, including <em>The New York Times</em>, <em>The Village Voice</em>, and <em>The New York Observer</em>. The review stated that audiences &quot;have a chance to witness a wide-eyed, straight-faced, scrappy and touching telling of the story of L Ron set to a cheesy electro-pop score. See the great man, clad in a white Plyphonic Spree-style gown, wander from inquisitive soul to wounded war veteran to writer of pulp science fiction to leader of world religion. Sort of.&quot;<a href="#fn95" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref95"><sup>95</sup></a></p>
<p>Of the updated 2006 version, <em><a href="Variety_(magazine)" title="wikilink">Variety</a></em> stated that &quot;..the breezy one-hour show is equal parts adorable and creepy, hilarious and unsettling, making it way more compelling than your average holiday entertainment.&quot;<a href="#fn96" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref96"><sup>96</sup></a> <em><a href="The_Boston_Globe" title="wikilink">The Boston Globe</a></em> also reviewed the 2006 edition of the play, and its review spent more time giving background on some of the cast and crew, particularly writer Kyle Jarrow, stating that &quot;..Jarrow has created a musical about L. Ron Hubbard that is, in its own sardonic way, much more funny and touching than any of Cruise's diatribes against Ritalin.&quot;<a href="#fn97" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref97"><sup>97</sup></a> <em><a href="The_New_York_Sun" title="wikilink">The New York Sun</a></em> described the production as an: &quot;ingenious musical account of L. Ron Hubbard's life and times,&quot; and compared the discomfort produced by watching the piece to the <a href="2006_in_film" title="wikilink">2006</a> <a href="documentary_film" title="wikilink">documentary</a> <em><a href="Jesus_Camp" title="wikilink">Jesus Camp</a></em>.<a href="#fn98" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref98"><sup>98</sup></a></p>

<p>A <a href="cast_recording" title="wikilink">cast recording</a> of the play was released by <a href="Kurt_Deutsch" title="wikilink">Kurt Deutsch</a>'s <a href="Sh-K-Boom_Records" title="wikilink">Sh-K-Boom Records</a>, on <a href="November_2" title="wikilink">November 2</a>, <a href="2004" class="uri" title="wikilink">2004</a>.<a href="#fn99" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref99"><sup>99</sup></a> &quot;Hey! It's a Happy Day!,&quot; &quot;Science of the Mind,&quot; &quot;Rain,&quot; and &quot;Finale&quot; are tracks from the original 2004 production.<a href="#fn100" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref100"><sup>100</sup></a> The other songs on the album were written by Jarrow &quot;.. to further explore the subjects and themes of the stage production.&quot;<a href="#fn101" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref101"><sup>101</sup></a> The first track on the album is entitled &quot;Disclaimer&quot;, and is a general announcement to the audience. The <em><a href="Los_Angeles_Daily_News" title="wikilink">Los Angeles Daily News</a></em> surmised that this disclaimer served to &quot;keep the creators of this acidic little send-up from getting hauled into court&quot;:<a href="#fn102" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref102"><sup>102</sup></a></p>

<p>The CD release received four out of five stars from <em><a href="All_Music_Guide" title="wikilink">All Music Guide</a></em>, where it was described as &quot;Funny, weird and wonderful&quot;, and &quot;the offbeat theater offering of the year.&quot; Specific tracks highlighted by <em>All Music Guide</em> included &quot;L. Ron Hubbard,&quot; in which the chorus centers on the question: &quot;What does the &quot;L.&quot; stand for?,&quot; and &quot;The Way <em>[sic]</em> It Began,&quot; which begins with the preface statement: &quot;The following is <em>completely secret</em> and <em>absolutely serious</em>. It is the story of the universe as described in the most sacred literature of the Church of Scientology.&quot; In the song &quot;Mister Auditor,&quot; the children actually sing some of the typical questions asked in Scientology <a href="Auditing_(Scientology)" title="wikilink">auditing</a>, and in the song &quot;Something Special,&quot; allegations that the Church of Scientology: &quot;preys on the weak and confused&quot; are discussed, but the narrator states that none of these allegations are true.<a href="#fn103" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref103"><sup>103</sup></a></p>
