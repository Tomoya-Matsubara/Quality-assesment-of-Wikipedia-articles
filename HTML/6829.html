<p><strong>Mount Toby</strong>, , is the highest summit of a sprawling collection of mostly wooded hills and knolls that rise from a distinct plateau-like upland in the towns of <a href="Sunderland,_Massachusetts" title="wikilink">Sunderland</a> and <a href="Leverett,_Massachusetts" title="wikilink">Leverett, Massachusetts</a>, just east of the <a href="Connecticut_River" title="wikilink">Connecticut River</a>. This mountain mass, part of the <a href="Metacomet_Ridge" title="wikilink">Metacomet Ridge</a> geology, is oval shaped and roughly three miles by two miles wide. Although three of the subordinate peaks have names of their own (Roaring Mountain, Ox Hill, Bull Hill), none of them are noteworthy on their own, and the designation &lt;U+201C&gt;Mount Toby&lt;U+201D&gt; is most often used (locally and formally) to describe the entire geologic mass.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a><a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> This article, therefore, describes the entire Mount Toby upland.</p>
<p>Mount Toby is notable for its high <a href="biodiversity" class="uri" title="wikilink">biodiversity</a>, attractive woodlands, <a href="waterfall" title="wikilink">waterfalls</a>, and its glacial <a href="kettle_pond" title="wikilink">kettle ponds</a> (most notably <em>Cranberry Pond</em>). Although the summit is wooded, there is a <a href="fire_tower" title="wikilink">fire tower</a>, open to the public, which provides 360-degree views of <a href="Amherst,_Massachusetts" title="wikilink">Amherst</a> and the <a href="Holyoke_Range" title="wikilink">Holyoke Range</a> in the south; the <a href="Connecticut_River" title="wikilink">Connecticut River</a> and <a href="Mount_Sugarloaf_(Massachusetts)" title="wikilink">Mount Sugarloaf</a> to the west; <a href="Mount_Snow" title="wikilink">Mount Snow</a>, <a href="Mount_Ascutney" title="wikilink">Mount Ascutney</a>, and <a href="Mount_Monadnock" title="wikilink">Mount Monadnock</a> in the north; and the nearby Peace Pagoda in Leverett to the east. Additionally, there are several cliffs located on the lower south and southwest facing slopes overlooking the <a href="Connecticut_River_Valley" title="wikilink">Connecticut River Valley</a> and the town of Sunderland.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<p>Mount Toby is named for Captain Elnathan Toby, a settler from colonial <a href="Springfield,_Massachusetts" title="wikilink">Springfield</a>, said to be the first <a href="Caucasian_race" title="wikilink">Caucasian</a> to summit the mountain. Like other peaks in the Connecticut River Valley in the 18th century, a resort hotel was built on the summit of Mount Toby, but it burned down a year after it was constructed, and was not rebuilt. The land was subsequently acquired by the Massachusetts Agricultural College (now the <a href="University_of_Massachusetts,_Amherst" title="wikilink">University of Massachusetts, Amherst</a>), and is currently part of the <em>Mount Toby State Demonstration Forest</em> managed by the University.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>

Unlike the surrounding region, Mount Toby was never cleared of its timber during New England&lt;U+2019&gt;s intensive agricultural period in the 18th and 19th centuries; it has remained wooded throughout, although timber harvesting has played a part in its history.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a><a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p>Geologically speaking, Mount Toby is composed of a sedimentary <a href="Conglomerate_(geology)" title="wikilink">conglomerate</a> base known as <em>Mount Toby Conglomerate</em>. It is associated with the geologic processes which created the <a href="Metacomet_Ridge" title="wikilink">Metacomet Ridge</a> that extends through <a href="New_England" title="wikilink">New England</a> from <a href="Long_Island_Sound" title="wikilink">Long Island Sound</a> to the <a href="Vermont" class="uri" title="wikilink">Vermont</a> border. Mount Toby is part of a larger geologic layer cake. The bottom layer is composed of <a href="arkose" class="uri" title="wikilink">arkose</a> sandstone, visible across the Connecticut River on <a href="Sugarloaf_Mountain_(Franklin_County,_Massachusetts)" title="wikilink">Sugarloaf Mountain</a> in <a href="Deerfield,_Massachusetts" title="wikilink">Deerfield, Massachusetts</a>. The middle layer is composed <a href="basalt" class="uri" title="wikilink">basalt</a>; it is most visible as the geology of the <a href="Pocumtuck_Ridge" title="wikilink">Pocumtuck Ridge</a>, to the north. The top (youngest) layer is composed of Mount Toby Conglomerate. About 200 million years ago, as the continent of <a href="North_America" title="wikilink">North America</a> began rifting apart from <a href="Africa" class="uri" title="wikilink">Africa</a> and <a href="Eurasia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Eurasia</a>, a series of <a href="erosion" class="uri" title="wikilink">erosion</a> and <a href="Deposition_(sediment)" title="wikilink">deposition</a> episodes interspersed with heavy basalt <a href="lava" class="uri" title="wikilink">lava</a> flows created this layer cake. Faulting and earthquakes tilted the layers diagonally; subsequent erosion and <a href="glacial" class="uri" title="wikilink">glacial</a> activity exposed the tilted &quot;layers&quot; of sandstone, basalt, and erosion-resistant conglomerate visible today. Although not composed of <a href="trap_rock" title="wikilink">trap rock</a>, Mount Toby is a closely associated with the trap rock Metacomet Ridge by virtue of its origin via the same rifting and uplift that created those mountains.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p>Mount Toby like many of the hills and mountains of New England was formed by volcanism.</p>
<p>The west and south sides of Mount Toby drain via a series of brooks into <a href="Connecticut_River" title="wikilink">Connecticut River</a>, thence <a href="Long_Island_Sound" title="wikilink">Long Island Sound</a>. The east side drains into Long Plain Brook, thence the Connecticut River. The north side drains into Cranberry Pond Brook, thence the Connecticut River.</p>

<p><a href="Image:Roaring_Falls.jpg" title="wikilink">rightleft|200px|thumb| Middle basin, Roaring Falls</a></p>
<p>Located on the east side of the mountain, is a series of waterfalls, pools, potholes, chutes, and cascades that plummet one hundred feet over rugged conglomerate ledges. The falls are most scenic in the spring and following periods of heavy precipitation; in the winter they are usually frozen over, and during dry periods the flow is often reduced to a trickle. Roaring Brook Falls is accessible by trail only. <em>Gunn Brook Falls</em>, located on the lower west side of the mountain, near the Connecticut River, and accessible via a short path from a public road, is smaller but has a more consistent flow. <em>Slatestone Brook Falls,</em> located on private property, is clearly visible from the road just north of Gunn Brook Falls. <em>Dogslip Falls</em> is located in the center of the Mount Toby geography, west of the main summit and furthest from road access. A fifth waterfall, <em>Green Swamp Brook Falls,</em> is located on the south side of the massif, between the south ledges, just north of Bull Hill Road.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a><a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="recreation">Recreation</h2>
<p><img src="Mttobyfiretower.jpg" title="fig:The Mount Toby Fire Tower" alt="The Mount Toby Fire Tower" width="160" /> Mount Toby and its subordinate peaks are a popular hiking destination; the mountain hosts a network of trails, and the  <a href="Robert_Frost_Trail_(Massachusetts)" title="wikilink">Robert Frost Trail</a> crosses the summit and upland from south to north. With the exception of the Robert Frost Trail, many of the trails are poorly <a href="trail_blazing" title="wikilink"> blazed</a>. Because the surrounding lands are an educational and research forest, trees may also be marked with additional markings that may confuse hikers. Hikers should utilize recent <a href="topographic_map" title="wikilink">topographic maps</a> and <a href="orienteering" class="uri" title="wikilink">orienteering</a> skills to navigate the trail system. <a href="Horseback_riding" title="wikilink">Horseback riding</a>, fishing, ice skating, <a href="snowshoeing" class="uri" title="wikilink">snowshoeing</a>, <a href="cross_country_skiing" title="wikilink">cross country skiing</a>, and <a href="mountain_biking" title="wikilink">mountain biking</a> are also enjoyed in the mountain's environs.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> Most of the public trailheads (on the east side of Mount Toby) are not directly accessible via public transportation. Sunderland is the closest bus stop via the <a href="Pioneer_Valley_Transit_Authority" title="wikilink">Pioneer Valley Transit Authority</a>; these buses allow the transportation of up to two bicycles.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="conservation">Conservation</h2>
<p>Although significant parcels on the mountain are protected&lt;U+2014&gt;part of the Mount Toby State Demonstration Forest and other Massachusetts state holdings, or under easement or direct stewardship of the <a href="Nature_Conservancy" title="wikilink">Nature Conservancy</a>, the <a href="Trustees_of_Reservations" title="wikilink">Trustees of Reservations</a>, the <a href="United_States_Fish_and_Wildlife_Service" title="wikilink">United States Fish and Wildlife Service</a>, and local conservation commissions&lt;U+2014&gt; the large proportion of the mountain is in private ownership, with the Cowl&lt;U+2019&gt;s Lumber Company the most significant landowner.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> {{-}}</p>
