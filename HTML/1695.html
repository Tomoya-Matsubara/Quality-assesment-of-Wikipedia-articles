<p>The <strong>AM</strong> (A Modified) type submarine was a large seaplane-carrying submarine of the <a href="Imperial_Japanese_Navy" title="wikilink">Imperial Japanese Navy</a>, with a hangar space for 2 aircraft. These giant submarines were originally of the A2 type, but their design was revised after construction started so that they could carry a second aircraft. The seaplanes were to be the <a href="Aichi_M6A" title="wikilink">Aichi M6A1</a>, bomber carrying 800 kg bombs.</p>
<p>The range and speed of these submarines was remarkable (21,000 nm at 16 knots), but their underwater performance was compromised, making them easy targets. I-13 was sunk on <a href="16_July" title="wikilink">16 July</a> <a href="1945" class="uri" title="wikilink">1945</a> by the destroyer escort <a href="USS_Lawrence_C._Taylor" title="wikilink">USS Lawrence C. Taylor</a> and aircraft action from escort carrier <a href="USS_Anzio_(CVE-57)" title="wikilink">USS Anzio</a> about 550 miles east of <a href="Yokosuka" class="uri" title="wikilink">Yokosuka</a>. I-14 surrendered at sea at the end of the war, and was later scuttled off Oahu in 1946.</p>
