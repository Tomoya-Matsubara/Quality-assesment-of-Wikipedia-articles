<p><img src="Magpie_lane.jpg" title="fig:Magpie Lane in Oxford, once known as Gropecunt Lane" alt="Magpie Lane in Oxford, once known as Gropecunt Lane" width="200" /> <strong>Gropecunt Lane</strong> () was a <a href="street_name" title="wikilink">street name</a> found in English towns and cities during the <a href="Middle_Ages" title="wikilink">Middle Ages</a>, believed to be a reference to the <a href="prostitution" class="uri" title="wikilink">prostitution</a> centred on those areas; it was normal practice for a medieval street name to reflect the street's function or the economic activity taking place within it. Gropecunt, the earliest known use of which is in about 1230, appears to have been derived as a compound of the words <em><a href="grope" class="uri" title="wikilink">grope</a></em> and <em><a href="cunt" class="uri" title="wikilink">cunt</a></em>.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> Streets with that name were often in the busiest parts of medieval towns and cities, and at least one appears to have been an important thoroughfare.</p>
<p>Although the name was once common throughout England,<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> changes in attitude resulted in its being replaced by more innocuous versions such as Grape Lane. Gropecunt was last recorded as a street name in 1561.</p>
<h2 id="toponymy">Toponymy</h2>
<p>Variations include Gropecunte, Gropecountelane, Gropecontelane, Groppecountelane, and Gropekuntelane. There were once many such street names in England, but all have now been <a href="Expurgation" title="wikilink">bowdlerised</a>.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> In the city of <a href="York" class="uri" title="wikilink">York</a>, for instance, Grapcunt Lane&lt;U+2014&gt;<em>gr&lt;U+0101&gt;p</em> is the <a href="Old_English" title="wikilink">Old English</a> word for grope<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a>&lt;U+2014&gt;was renamed as the more acceptable Grape Lane.</p>

<p>It was normal practice for <a href="Middle_Ages" title="wikilink">medieval</a> street names to reflect their function, or the economic activity taking place within them (especially the commodities available for sale), hence the frequency of names such as <a href="The_Shambles" title="wikilink">The Shambles</a>, Silver Street, Fish Street, and Swinegate (pork butchers) in cities with a medieval history.

<p><img src="GropeLane.jpg" title="fig:Grope Lane in Shrewsbury" alt="Grope Lane in Shrewsbury" /> The name was also used in other large medieval towns across England, including <a href="Bristol" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bristol</a>, <a href="York" class="uri" title="wikilink">York</a>, <a href="Shrewsbury" class="uri" title="wikilink">Shrewsbury</a>, <a href="Newcastle_upon_Tyne" title="wikilink">Newcastle upon Tyne</a>, <a href="Worcester" class="uri" title="wikilink">Worcester</a>, <a href="Hereford" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hereford</a>, and <a href="Oxford" class="uri" title="wikilink">Oxford</a>. <a href="Norwich" class="uri" title="wikilink">Norwich</a>'s Gropekuntelane (now Opie Street) was recorded in Latin as <em>turpis vicus</em>, the shameful street.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> In 1230 Oxford's <a href="Magpie_Lane,_Oxford" title="wikilink">Magpie Lane</a> was known as Gropecunt Lane, renamed Grope or Grape Lane in the 13th century, and then Magpie Lane in the mid-17th century. It was again renamed in 1850 as Grove Street, before once again assuming the name Magpie Lane in the 20th century.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> Newcastle and Worcester each had a Grope Lane close to their public <a href="quay" title="wikilink">quays</a>.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> In their 2001 study of medieval prostitution, using the <em>Historic Towns Atlas</em> as a source, historian Richard Holt and <a href="archaeologist" class="uri" title="wikilink">archaeologist</a> Nigel Baker of the University of Birmingham studied sexually suggestive street names around England.

<p>Streets named Gropecunt Lane are also recorded in several smaller market towns such as <a href="Banbury" class="uri" title="wikilink">Banbury</a> and <a href="Wells" class="uri" title="wikilink">Wells</a>, where a street of that name existed in 1300, regularly mentioned in legal documents of the time.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a><a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a><a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> Parsons Street in Banbury was first recorded as Gropecunt Lane in 1333, and may have been an important thoroughfare,<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> but by 1410 its name had been changed to Parsons Lane.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> Grape Lane in <a href="Whitby" class="uri" title="wikilink">Whitby</a> may once have been Grope Lane, or Grapcunt Lane.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a> A street called Grope Countelane existed in <a href="Shrewsbury" class="uri" title="wikilink">Shrewsbury</a> as recently as 1561, connecting the town's two principal marketplaces. At some date unrecorded the street was renamed Grope Lane, a name which it has since retained. In Thomas Phillips' <em>History and Antiquities of Shrewsbury</em> (1799) the author is explicit in his understanding of the origin of the name as &quot;... [a place of] scandalous lewdness and venery&quot;, but Archdeacon Hugh Owen's <em>Some account of the ancient and present state of Shrewsbury</em> (1808) describes it as &quot;called Grope, or the Dark Lane&quot;. As a result of these differing accounts, some local tour guides attribute the name to &quot;feeling one's way along a dark and narrow thoroughfare&quot;.<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a></p>
