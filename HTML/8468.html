Sandra Gonzalez of <em><a href="Entertainment_Weekly" title="wikilink">Entertainment Weekly</a></em> would go on to praise the musicals performed on the episode, stating that her favorite was &quot;<a href="Silly_Love_Songs" title="wikilink">Silly Love Songs</a>&quot; by <a href="Paul_McCartney" title="wikilink">Paul McCartney</a>.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a><a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> In a highly positive review of the performance, she wrote, &quot;This is much more Warbler-esque than &quot;<a href="When_I_Get_You_Alone" title="wikilink">When I Get You Alone</a>&quot;. I had also been worried we wouldn't get our weekly dose of dorky Warbler dance moves. Plus, major points for the blink-and-you'll-miss-it moment when Blaine sang the love &quot;won't come at all&quot; line to Santana. It was probably my personal biggest laugh-out-loud moment of the episode.&quot;<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> She gave the performance an A. She also praised performance of &quot;<a href="Fat_Bottomed_Girls" title="wikilink">Fat Bottomed Girls</a>&quot; by Puck, writing, &quot;In general, I'm in love with Mark Salling's voice. He's right up there with Artie [...] in my book. And this song was smothered in awesome sauce. Bonus points for Puck's sort-of-feminine head bob, Brittany's background groovin', the club's reactions to him singing to Lauren, and Mr. Schu's mild eye-roll.&quot;<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> She went on to give the performance an A-. Tara's cover of &quot;<a href="My_Funny_Valentine" title="wikilink">My Funny Valentine</a>&quot; was met with mixed reception from Gonzalez. She would go on to criticize the ending, writing, &quot;When she started sobbing, it got weird. Then weirder. Then downright uncomfortable.&quot;<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> However, Gonzalez would praise the other parts of the performance, writing, &quot;It was &lt;U+00FC&gt;bersweet when Tina started getting choked up during her song, because let's face it, it happens. You can love someone so much it hurts. If she would have continued the song with a mild lump in her throat, I think I might have gotten choked up with her.&quot;<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> Kristin Coachman of the <em><a href="Seattle_Post-Intelligencer" title="wikilink">Seattle Post-Intelligencer</a></em> was a bit more critical on Puck's cover of the song, writing &quot;This week Mark Salling [...] is singing Queen&lt;U+2019&gt;s &lt;U+201C&gt;Fat Bottomed Girls.&lt;U+201D&gt; I know this song fits in with Puck&lt;U+2019&gt;s storyline for the episode, but I feel like the song was in the wrong key for him. At times it sounded like he was straining to hit the higher notes. Because of this, I have to wonder if the backing vocals are purposely drowning his voice out. It seems depending on the song selection for him, Salling&lt;U+2019&gt;s vocal performances continue to be very hit or miss this season.&quot;<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> Rachel's cover of &quot;<a href="Firework_(song)" title="wikilink">Firework</a>&quot; by <a href="Katy_Perry" title="wikilink">Katy Perry</a> was met with negative reception from Coachman. She went on to write, &quot;I&lt;U+2019&gt;m not loving Michele&lt;U+2019&gt;s vocals on this track. It was like they wanted to purposely make her sound like Katy Perry. As much as I really like Katy Perry, Michele has more of a tremendous voice. There are parts where I thought she sounded really great, but for the most part this song just wasn&lt;U+2019&gt;t my cup of tea. Michele has such a beautiful voice; I wish she was given songs that would allow her to showcase it to her advantage.&quot;<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> Katie Morgan of <em><a href="Billboard_(magazine)" title="wikilink">Billboard</a></em> gave a positive from the performance of &quot;Silly Love Songs. She wrote, &quot;Not only do they sound great [...], but the song brings a sugary sweet end to a super-saccharine episode.&quot;<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> <a href="CNN" class="uri" title="wikilink">CNN</a> gave the musicals a positive review, writing, &quot;I just loved seeing The Warblers get their groove on amidst the jeans and cotton T-shirts. And Kurt was super gracious trying to be supportive of Blaine, in spite of his own feelings. I also totally loved the music [...] and overall this was one of my favorite episodes this season.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> Brett Berk of <em><a href="Vanity_Fair_(magazine)" title="wikilink">Vanity Fair</a></em> praised Salling's performance of &quot;Fat Bottomed Girls&quot;, as well as the casts' performances of &quot;<a href="P.Y.T._(Pretty_Young_Thing)" title="wikilink">P.Y.T.</a>&quot; by <a href="Michael_Jackson" title="wikilink">Michael Jackson</a> and &quot;When I get You Alone&quot; by <a href="Robin_Thicke" title="wikilink">Robin Thicke</a>.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> Erica Futterman of <em><a href="Rolling_Stone_(magazine)" title="wikilink">Rolling Stone</a></em> gave Salling's performance a positive review, writing, &quot;We were thoroughly entertained by Puck's attempt to win newbie Lauren Zizes over with his tribute to her larger figure. Only in Puck's world would Queen's raucous song qualify as a serenade &lt;U+2014&gt; and our horror-turned-amusement was mirrored on his fellow New Directions' faces. Puck is no <a href="Freddie_Mercury" title="wikilink">Freddie Mercury</a>, but he handles the melody well and makes up for lack of range with swagger.&quot;<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a></p>

<h3 id="critical-response">Critical response</h3>

<p>&quot;Silly Love Songs&quot; was met with critical acclaim from many television critics and fans alike upon its initial airing. Erica Futterman of <em><a href="Rolling_Stone_(magazine)" title="wikilink">Rolling Stone</a></em> gave a very positive review of the episode, writing, &quot;This was our favorite type of <em>Glee</em> episode. Though we enjoy over-the-top spectacles [...], the show's real cleverness shines when they take songs from across the board and fit them into a cohesive storyline. Sue Sylvester didn't make an appearance and &lt;U+2014&gt; dare we say it &lt;U+2014&gt; we didn't even miss her.&quot;<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> Bobby Hankinson of the <em><a href="Houston_Chronicle" title="wikilink">Houston Chronicle</a></em> enjoyed the episode, going on to write, &quot;I thought it was a strong showing, if a little disjointed. Well, at least it was honest. If this show is one thing, it's disjointed. It's part of its spazzy appeal.&quot;<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> Melissa Maerz of the <em><a href="Los_Angeles_Times" title="wikilink">Los Angeles Times</a></em> gave the episode a positive review, writing, &quot;On Tuesday night, <em>Glee</em> wasn&lt;U+2019&gt;t only back at its usual time, it was back to doing what it does best: giving us entertaining [...] storylines involving characters we care about who sing songs that emerge organically and advance the story. It was like a perfect heart-shaped bubble of an episode reminding the show&lt;U+2019&gt;s fans about all the things we&lt;U+2019&gt;ve missed about the show these last couple of months.&quot;<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> <img src="Paul_McCartney_live_in_Dublin.jpg" title="fig:The cover version for Paul McCartney&#39;s &quot;Silly Love Songs&quot; was met with general acclaim." alt="The cover version for Paul McCartney&#39;s &quot;Silly Love Songs&quot; was met with general acclaim." width="150" /> Robert Canning of <a href="IGN" class="uri" title="wikilink">IGN</a> gave the episode a positive review, writing, &quot;With the dissing of glee club temporarily put on hold, <em>Glee</em> the series was able to have a little fun with Tuesday night's episode. And fun it was, with the gang of New Directions taking on <a href="Valentine&#39;s_Day" title="wikilink">Valentine's Day</a>, with flirting, kissing and, of course, singing. Without the bullying, this was a much lighter episode of <em>Glee</em>, and the results gave way to a lot more laughs and story development.&quot;<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> He went on to praise Ashley Fink's performance as <a href="Lauren_Zizes" title="wikilink">Lauren Zizes</a>, as well as her script.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> Canning ultimately gave the episode an 8.5.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> Wyndham Wyeth of <em><a href="Paste_(magazine)" title="wikilink">Paste</a></em> went on to praise the episode for its depiction of relationships in high school, as well as the backing vocals for Salling's performance of &quot;<a href="Fat_Bottomed_Girls" title="wikilink">Fat Bottomed Girls</a>&quot; by <a href="Queen_(band)" title="wikilink">Queen</a>.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> Todd VanDerWerff of <em><a href="The_A.V._Club" title="wikilink">The A.V. Club</a></em> gave the episode a very positive review, writing, &quot;&quot;Silly Love Songs&quot; is a fine example of the show at what&lt;U+2019&gt;s very nearly its absolute best. There&lt;U+2019&gt;s nothing too heady here, but if the show has one tone that it&lt;U+2019&gt;s nailed almost completely consistently, it&lt;U+2019&gt;s the feeling of teenage <a href="romance" class="uri" title="wikilink">romance</a>, the sense that the person you&lt;U+2019&gt;re in love with is the only person you will ever be in love with [...] followed almost immediately by the crippling feeling of heartbreak, of losing that person too soon. Teenage life moves fast and is filled with heightened emotions. And like most musicals, <em>Glee</em> has always been at its best when it embraces those two sides of its characters&lt;U+2019&gt; lives. As such, &quot;Silly Love Songs&quot;, which is pretty much just an excuse to play around with the show&lt;U+2019&gt;s many romantic pairings among its <a href="glee_club" title="wikilink">glee club</a> characters, is a lot of fun without trying all that hard.&quot;<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> In conclusion of his review, he wrote, &quot;The best episodes play that elation and devastation off of each other. The worst episodes flounder about for some sort of emotional foothold. But when <em>Glee</em> just tells small, sweet stories about these kids and the ways they&lt;U+2019&gt;re trying to cope with being in high school when they know they&lt;U+2019&gt;re meant for bigger things, it can be terrific. Tonight was one of those episodes, and tonight&lt;U+2019&gt;s episode was terrific. Here&lt;U+2019&gt;s to a good February sweeps.&quot;<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> He went on to give the episode an A-. Matt Richenthal of <em>TV Fanatic</em> gave the episode a 4.6 out of 5 stars, and went on to write a very positive review for the episode. He wrote, &quot;A funny, touching, entertaining <em>Glee</em> episode that didn't feature a single line from <a href="Sue_Sylvester" title="wikilink">Sue Sylvester</a>?!? I never thought I'd see the day. But that's exactly what transpired on &quot;Silly Love Songs&quot;, as the show stopped feeling like a Public Service Announcement for a week and actually focused on well-paced, well-written relationship developments among its core characters.&quot;<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> Joel Keller of <em><a href="TV_Squad" title="wikilink">TV Squad</a></em> gave the episode a positive review, writing, &quot;&quot;Silly Love Songs&quot; strikes an interesting contrast to Sunday night's post-<a href="Super_Bowl" title="wikilink">Super Bowl</a> episode in that tonight was more about the kids and where they are in their stories than about big production numbers and Sue's cartoon evilness. It was also the funniest episode of the season, in no small part because we got some insight into the lives of two New Directions members we rarely get to hang out with for any length of time: Santana and Lauren.&quot;<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> James Poniewozik of <em><a href="Time_(magazine)" title="wikilink">Time Magazine</a></em> gave the episode a positive review, going on to praise the storyline and the musicals of the episode.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> However, Soraya Roberts of the <em><a href="Daily_News_(New_York)" title="wikilink">Daily News</a></em> gave the episode a negative episode, writing, &quot;This show sometimes sounds like it was written by a PIT, prime idiot TV writer. It's almost as bad as Tina breaking down into tears for no reason while singing &quot;My Funny Valentine&quot; to Mike and Blaine attempting to channel <a href="Frank_Sinatra" title="wikilink">Frank Sinatra</a> while singing Paul McCartney's &quot;Silly Love Songs&quot; in the middle of Breadsticks.&quot;<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> Lisa de Moraes of <em><a href="The_Washington_Post" title="wikilink">The Washington Post</a></em> praised the storyline, calling it cohesive.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a></p>
