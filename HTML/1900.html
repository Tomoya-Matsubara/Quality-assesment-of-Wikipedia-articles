<p><strong>Frank Abbott</strong> (September 5, 1836 – April 20, 1897) was president of the <a href="American_Dental_Association" title="wikilink">American Dental Association</a> (1888), president of the <strong>National Association of Dental Faculties</strong> (1895), a renowned <a href="dentist" class="uri" title="wikilink">dentist</a>, an author on dental subjects, and an <a href="inventor" class="uri" title="wikilink">inventor</a> of dental instruments such as various types of chisels, pluggers, excavators and scalers, some of which are still in use in the 21st century.</p>
<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>Born to a transplanted <a href="English_people" title="wikilink">English</a> family, he attended local schools in <a href="York_County,_Maine" title="wikilink">York County, Maine</a> and farmed in <a href="Shapleigh" class="uri" title="wikilink">Shapleigh</a>, <a href="Maine" class="uri" title="wikilink">Maine</a> until the age of 16, when he began to travel. Beginning in 1855, he studied dentistry under Dr. J.E. Ostrander in <a href="Oneida,_New_York" title="wikilink">Oneida, New York</a>. At the age of 22 he opened his own dental practice in <a href="Johnstown_(city),_New_York" title="wikilink">Johnstown, New York</a>, and married Catherine Ann Cuyler, with whom he would have three children.</p>
<p>Upon the outbreak of the <a href="American_Civil_War" title="wikilink">American Civil War</a>, he served as a <a href="lieutenant" class="uri" title="wikilink">lieutenant</a> of the <a href="115th_New_York_Volunteer_Infantry" title="wikilink">115th New York Volunteer Infantry</a>, and was captured at <a href="Harper&#39;s_Ferry,_West_Virginia" title="wikilink">Harper's Ferry, West Virginia</a>. He returned as a part of a prisoner exchange.</p>
<h2 id="dental-career">Dental career</h2>
<p>After the civil war he returned to his practice. A year later he <a href="matriculated" class="uri" title="wikilink">matriculated</a> as a medical student at the <a href="City_University_of_New_York" title="wikilink">City University of New York</a>. While there he was appointed as clinical <a href="lecturer" class="uri" title="wikilink">lecturer</a> in <a href="New_York_College_of_Dentistry" title="wikilink">New York College of Dentistry</a> (1866), as Professor of Operative Dentistry (1868) and as <a href="Dean_(education)" title="wikilink">dean</a>, (1869).</p>
<p>From 1894 - 1895 he failed in attempts to have the <a href="trustee" title="wikilink">trustees</a> there establish a Chair of <a href="Pathology" class="uri" title="wikilink">Pathology</a> and <a href="Microbiology" title="wikilink">Bacteriology</a> (with his son as incumbent) and to have the <a href="New_York_University" title="wikilink">University of New York</a> regents replace an act of incorporation of the college with a new regent-approved charter. </p>
<p>Other subsequent initiatives of his also later failed. In addition to the invented dental instruments mentioned above, he also invented the first authomatic <a href="hammer" title="wikilink">mallet</a> with an effective back-action. He also collected rare American history prints.</p>
