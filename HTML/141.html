<p>The <strong>Law School of Beirut</strong> was a center for the study of law in <a href="classical_antiquity" title="wikilink">classical antiquity</a>. It flourished under the patronage of the <a href="Roman_emperor" title="wikilink">Roman emperors</a> and functioned as the <a href="Roman_Empire" title="wikilink">Roman Empire</a>'s preeminent center of jurisprudence until its destruction in 551 CE.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a><a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a><a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>The law schools of the Roman Empire established organized repositories of imperial constitutions, and institutionalized the study and the practice of jurisprudence to relieve the busy royal courts. Jurisconsults began archiving imperial constitutions, thus facilitating the task of jurists in referring to legal precedents. The origins of the Law School of <a href="Beirut" class="uri" title="wikilink">Beirut</a> are obscure. The earliest written mention of the school dates to 239 CE, when its reputation had already been established. The school attracted young affluent Roman citizens, and its professors made major contributions to the <a href="Corpus_Juris_Civilis" title="wikilink">Codex of Justinian</a>. The school achieved such wide recognition throughout the empire that Beirut was known as the &quot;Mother of Laws&quot;. Beirut was one of the few schools allowed to continue teaching jurisprudence when <a href="List_of_Byzantine_emperors" title="wikilink">Byzantine Emperor</a> <a href="Justinian_I" title="wikilink">Justinian I</a> shut down other provincial law schools.</p>
<p>The course of study at Beirut lasted for five years and consisted of the revision and analysis of classical juridic texts and imperial constitutions in addition to case discussions. Justinian took a personal interest in the teaching process, and charged the teachers, the bishop of Beirut, and the governor of <a href="Phoenicia" title="wikilink">Phoenicia Maritima</a> with maintaining discipline in the school.</p>
<p>The school's facilities were destroyed in the aftermath of a <a href="551_Beirut_earthquake" title="wikilink">massive earthquake</a> that hit the <a href="Phoenicia" title="wikilink">Phoenician</a> coastline. It was moved to <a href="Sidon" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sidon</a>, but did not survive the <a href="Muslim_conquest_of_the_Levant" title="wikilink">Arab conquest</a> of 635 CE. Ancient texts attest that the school was located next to the ancient Anastasis church, vestiges of which lie beneath the <a href="Saint_George_Greek_Orthodox_Cathedral,_Beirut" title="wikilink">Saint George Orthodox Cathedral</a> in <a href="Beirut_Central_District" title="wikilink">Beirut's historic center</a>.</p>
<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>In his role as guarantor of justice, the <a href="Roman_emperor" title="wikilink">Roman emperor</a> was expected to devote substantial amounts of time to dealing with judicial matters; he was the <a href="Executive_magistrates_of_the_Roman_Empire" title="wikilink">chief magistrate</a> whose major prerogative <em>(<a href="Jus_(law)" title="wikilink">jus</a>)</em> was the ordering of all public affairs, for which he could demand assistance from anyone at any time.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>In dealing with legal appeals and petitions from subjects, and judicial queries of magistrates and <a href="Roman_governor" title="wikilink">governors</a>, the emperors were careful to consult with the jurisconsults (<em>iuris consulti</em>) who were usually secretaries drafted from the <a href="Roman_equestrian_order" title="wikilink">equestrian order</a>. From the reign of <a href="Augustus" class="uri" title="wikilink">Augustus</a> (27 BCE &lt;U+2013&gt; 14 CE) and onward, jurisconsults began compiling organized repositories of imperial <a href="edict" title="wikilink">edicts</a> <em>(constitutiones)</em>, and juristic scholarship became an imperially sponsored function of administration. These archives formed the foundation of every new judicial decision based on the archived <a href="legal_precedent" title="wikilink">legal precedents</a> and earlier deliberations. The repositories of edicts and the imperially sponsored juristic scholarship gave rise to the earliest law school system of the <a href="Western_world" title="wikilink">Occident</a> aimed specifically at training professional jurists.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>

It was chosen as a regional center instead of the more prominent <a href="Phoenicia" title="wikilink">Phoenician</a> cities of <a href="Tyre,_Lebanon" title="wikilink">Tyre</a> and <a href="Sidon" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sidon</a>, which had a history of belligerence against Rome.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a><a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p>Beirut was named as a major center for the study of law and jurisprudence in 239 CE,<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a><a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> in the writings of <a href="Gregory_Thaumaturgus" title="wikilink">Gregory Thaumaturgus</a>,<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> the bishop of <a href="Niksar" title="wikilink">Neo-Caesarea</a>. Other early written sources do not mention when the law school was established, and the date is much debated among later historians and scholars. <a href="Edward_Gibbon" title="wikilink">Edward Gibbon</a> suggested its founding may have been directed by locally born Emperor <a href="Alexander_Severus" title="wikilink">Alexander Severus</a>, who reigned from 222 to 235.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> In the early 17th century, the Italian jurist <a href="Scipione_Gentili" title="wikilink">Scipione Gentili</a> attributed the foundation of the school to Augustus, while the later 17th-century French scholar <a href="Gilles_M&lt;U+00E9&gt;nage" title="wikilink">Gilles M&lt;U+00E9&gt;nage</a> argued for <a href="Septimius_Severus" title="wikilink">Septimius Severus</a> (reigned from 193 to 211 CE). In the 19th century, <a href="Karl_Hase" title="wikilink">Karl Hase</a> thought the school was established shortly after the <a href="Battle_of_Actium" title="wikilink">victory at Actium</a> in 31 BCE,<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> Adolf Friedrich Rudorff dated it to the reign of <a href="Hadrian" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hadrian</a>,<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> and F.P.

<p><a href="Theodor_Mommsen" title="wikilink">Theodor Mommsen</a><a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> linked the establishment of the law school in Beirut with the need for jurists, since the city was chosen to serve as a repository for Roman imperial edicts dealing with the eastern provinces. Imperial <em>constitutiones</em> arriving in Beirut were translated to <a href="Ancient_Greek" title="wikilink">Greek</a>, published and then archived. This function is first recorded for 196 CE, the date of the earliest constitutions contained in the <a href="Codex_Gregorianus" title="wikilink">Gregorian Codex</a>, but the city is thought to have served as a depository since earlier times.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a><a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> The proximity of the repository to the law school gave the Beiruti jurists the opportunity to consult archived edicts and to keep the students updated with the most recent imperial constitutions&lt;U+2014&gt;an advantage that the law schools of <a href="Caesarea_Maritima" title="wikilink">Caesarea Maritima</a> and <a href="Alexandria" class="uri" title="wikilink">Alexandria</a> lacked.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
<p>The 3rd-century emperors <a href="Diocletian" class="uri" title="wikilink">Diocletian</a> and <a href="Maximian" class="uri" title="wikilink">Maximian</a> issued constitutions exempting the students of the Law School of Beirut from compulsory service in their hometowns.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> In the 4th century, the Greek rhetorician <a href="Libanius" class="uri" title="wikilink">Libanius</a> reported that the school attracted young students from affluent families, and deplored the school's instructional use of Latin, which was gradually abandoned in favor of Greek in the course of the century.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> By the 5th century, Beirut had established its leading position and repute among the empire's law schools; its teachers were highly regarded and played a chief role in the development of juristic learning in the East, to the point that they were dubbed the &quot;Oecumenical Masters&quot;.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a><a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> From 425 onward, <a href="Constantinople" class="uri" title="wikilink">Constantinople</a> became a rival center of law study and was the only school, along with Beirut, to be maintained after <a href="Justinian_I" title="wikilink">Justinian I</a> closed those of <a href="Alexandria" class="uri" title="wikilink">Alexandria</a>, <a href="Caesarea_Maritima" title="wikilink">Caesarea Maritima</a> and <a href="Athens" class="uri" title="wikilink">Athens</a> in 529 CE.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a></p>
<p>On July 9, 551, the <a href="Phoenicia" title="wikilink">Phoenician</a> coastal cities were devastated by a high magnitude <a href="551_Beirut_earthquake" title="wikilink">earthquake</a>. In Beirut the earthquake was followed by a <a href="tsunami" class="uri" title="wikilink">tsunami</a> and a fire that obliterated the city. 30,000 people lost their lives, including many students from abroad. Justinian allocated funds to rebuild Beirut, and the law school was temporarily moved to the southern Phoenician city of <a href="Sidon" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sidon</a>, pending reconstruction. The best teachers, however, moved to Constantinople. Misfortune hit Beirut again in 560 CE when a massive fire ravaged the recovering city. The law school was not reopened, and all prospect of its return was abandoned with the <a href="Muslim_conquest_of_the_Levant" title="wikilink">Arab conquest</a> in 635 CE.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a><a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a></p>

<p>The study course at the Law School of Beirut did not comprise the provincial laws of Phoenica;<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> it only included Roman law. Ancient texts provide an idea of the curriculum, the teaching method, the course languages and the duration of the study.</p>
<h3 id="preparatory-studies">Preparatory studies</h3>
<p>Future students at the Law School of Beirut were expected to have undergone grammar, <a href="rhetoric" class="uri" title="wikilink">rhetoric</a> and encyclopedic sciences studies. Another prerequisite was the mastery of Greek but also of the <a href="Latin" class="uri" title="wikilink">Latin</a> language, given that the classical juridic references and the imperial constitutions used in the teaching program were written in Latin. The aspirants could pursue their preparatory studies in public schools or have private tutors.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a></p>

<p><img src="Meister_von_San_Vitale_in_Ravenna_004.jpg" title="fig:Justinian I, who instigated the rewriting of Roman law" alt="Justinian I, who instigated the rewriting of Roman law" /> The study of the works of classical jurists and of the imperial constitutions provided the basis of legal education at Beirut's law school. The <em><a href="Scholia_Sinaitica" title="wikilink">Scholia Sinaitica</a></em> and the <em><a href="Scholia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Scholia</a></em> to the <em><a href="Basilika" class="uri" title="wikilink">Basilika</a></em> give glimpses of the school's <a href="teaching_method" title="wikilink">teaching method</a>, which is comparable to the one used in the rhetoric schools. Juridic texts were discussed and analyzed, and the lecturer would add his comments, consisting of references to analogous passages from imperial constitutions or from the works of prominent Roman jurists of the like of <a href="Ulpian" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ulpian</a>. He would then formulate the general legal principles and use these to resolve legal problems inspired from actual practical cases. This method differed from the scheme of classical times in which the student had to master the law basics before engaging in case studies in the later part of his education.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a><a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a><a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a></p>
<p>Jurisprudence was taught in Latin even in the law schools of the East, but towards the end of the 4th and the beginning of the 5th century, Latin was supplanted by <a href="Ancient_Greek" title="wikilink">Greek</a> at Beirut. A similar shift probably occurred at the school of Constantinople about the same time.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a><a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a></p>
<p>Little is known about the curriculum before the fifth century. Justinian's <em>Omnem</em> constitution at the beginning of the <a href="Digest_(Roman_law)" title="wikilink">Digest</a> is the only source of information about the existing system of study in the fifth century and up until the Justinian reforms of 533 CE. The old program was a four-year course to be completed before the age of 25. The courses were based on the works of <a href="Gaius_(jurist)" title="wikilink">Gaius</a>, Ulpian, <a href="Aemilius_Papinianus" title="wikilink">Papinian</a> and <a href="Julius_Paulus_Prudentissimus" title="wikilink">Paul the jurist</a>. Students attended lectures for three years and spent the fourth in private study of Paul's <em><a href="Responsa" class="uri" title="wikilink">Responsa</a></em>; they had the option to stay for a fifth year to study imperial constitutions. The students of each year were distinguished by special names: 1st year, <em>Dupondii</em>; 2nd, <em>Edictales</em>; 3rd, <em>Papinianistae</em>; 4th, <em>Lytae</em>.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a></p>
<p>After his 533 <em>Omnem</em> constitution, Justinian I fixed the duration of the legal course in the schools of Beirut and Constantinople at 5 years.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a><a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> The courses consisted of taught elements and self-study using materials advanced in his <a href="Corpus_Juris_Civilis" title="wikilink">Corpus Juris Civilis</a>, namely the Institutes, Digest and Code.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a><a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> First-year students were to be lectured on the <em><a href="Institutiones" class="uri" title="wikilink">Institutiones</a></em> and on the first part of the Digest.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> Second-year students were taught the greater part of the Digest.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> Third-year students had to learn various texts from Papinian and the <em>leges singulares</em>.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> There were no lectures during the fourth year of study, but the pupils studied the rest of the Digest up to Book 36.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> The students were still given cognomens according to their year of study but Justinian changed the name of the first-year students from the frivolous <em>dupondii</em>, which means &quot;two-pennies&quot;.

<p>Ancient texts reveal the names and deeds of some of the most notable law professors at the Beirut school; the scarce sources include historical accounts, juridic works, anthologies, ancient correspondences and funerary inscriptions.</p>
<p>Rhetoric teacher <a href="Libanius" class="uri" title="wikilink">Libanius</a> wrote many letters of correspondence to a fourth-century law school professor called Domninus (the Elder). In 360 CE, Libanius attempted to recruit Domninus in the school of Antioch where he taught, but Domninus apparently declined since later letters sent to him by Libanius between 361 and 364 CE served as recommendations for law school candidates.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a></p>
<p>The most brilliant era for the Law School of Beirut was that which became known as the era of the Ecumenical Masters (&lt;U+03C4&gt;&lt;U+1FC6&gt;&lt;U+03C2&gt; &lt;U+03BF&gt;&lt;U+1F30&gt;&lt;U+03BA&gt;&lt;U+03BF&gt;&lt;U+03C5&gt;&lt;U+03BC&gt;&lt;U+03AD&gt;&lt;U+03BD&gt;&lt;U+03B7&gt;&lt;U+03C2&gt; &lt;U+03B4&gt;&lt;U+03B9&gt;&lt;U+03B4&gt;&lt;U+03AC&gt;&lt;U+03C3&gt;&lt;U+03BA&gt;&lt;U+03B1&gt;&lt;U+03BB&gt;&lt;U+03BF&gt;&lt;U+03B9&gt;), spanning a century between 400 and 500 CE. The seven revered masters who were praised and cited by sixth-century scholars are Cyrillus, Patricius, Domninus, Demosthenes, Eudoxius, Leontius and Amblichus.<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a></p>
<p><a href="Cyrillus" class="uri" title="wikilink">Cyrillus</a> was the founder of the ecumenical school of jurists. He is believed to have taught from 400&lt;U+2013&gt;410 CE to 538 CE. He was styled &quot;the great&quot; because of his reputation as a teacher, and was known for his direct use of ancient sources of law and for interpreting jurists such as Ulpian and Papinian. Cyrillus wrote a precise treatise on definitions (&lt;U+03C5&gt;&lt;U+03C0&gt;&lt;U+03BF&gt;&lt;U+03BC&gt;&lt;U+03BD&gt;&lt;U+03B7&gt;&lt;U+03BC&gt;&lt;U+03B1&gt; &lt;U+03C4&gt;&lt;U+03C9&gt;&lt;U+03BD&gt; &lt;U+03B4&gt;&lt;U+03B5&gt;&lt;U+03C6&gt;&lt;U+03B9&gt;&lt;U+03BD&gt;&lt;U+03B9&gt;&lt;U+03C4&gt;&lt;U+03C9&gt;&lt;U+03BD&gt;) that supplied the materials for many important scholia appended to the first and second titles of the eleventh book of the <a href="Basilika" title="wikilink">Basilica</a>.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a><a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a></p>
<p><a href="Patricius_(jurist)" title="wikilink">Patricius</a> is a fifth-century teacher who garnered praise in the third preface of the Justinian Digest (<em>Tanta-Dedoken</em>) as a distinguished professor of the Beirut law school. Archaeological excavations done in Beirut at the turn of the 20th century revealed a funerary monument which is believed to belong to the deceased Patricius.<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a><a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a> Later came Domninus the Younger, Demosthenes and Eudoxius, who were coevals.</p>
<p><a href="Leontius_(jurist)" title="wikilink">Leontius</a> was another Ecumenical Master, a son of Eudoxius and the father of Anatolius, who was summoned by the imperial court to assist with the writing of the Justinian Code. <a href="Zacharias_Rhetor" title="wikilink">Zacharias Rhetor</a> wrote that Leontius had a great reputation in the legal field; Zacharias was Leontius' student in the first year of his legal course in the year 487 or 488 CE.

<p>Ecclesiastical historian <a href="Zacharias_Rhetor" title="wikilink">Zacharias Rhetor</a> studied law at Beirut between 487 and 492 and worked as a lawyer in Constantinople for a long time before his good imperial contacts won him the appointment as bishop of <a href="Mytilene" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mytilene</a>.

<p>Historically, Roman <em>stationes</em> or <em>auditoria</em> where teaching was done stood next to public libraries housed in temples; this arrangement was copied in the Roman colony at Beirut. The first mention of the school's premises dates to 350 AD,<a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a> but the description does not specify its location. In the fifth century, Zacharias Rhetor reported that the school stood next to the &quot;Temple of God&quot;, the description of which permitted its identification with the <a href="Byzantine" class="uri" title="wikilink">Byzantine</a> Anastasis cathedral.<a href="#fn69" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref69"><sup>69</sup></a></p>

The flow of students was abundant and persistent because of the affluence, honor and the secured employment offered by the profession.<a href="#fn74" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref74"><sup>74</sup></a> A degree in law became highly sought after following an edict issued in 460 CE by <a href="Leo_I_the_Thracian" title="wikilink">Emperor Leo I</a>. The edict ordered that candidates for the bar of the Eastern <a href="praetorian_prefect" title="wikilink">praetorian prefecture</a> had to produce certificates of proficiency from the law professors who instructed them at one of the recognized law schools of the empire.<a href="#fn75" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref75"><sup>75</sup></a><a href="#fn76" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref76"><sup>76</sup></a></p>
<p>The in-depth studies of the juridic classical works in Beirut and later in Constantinople gave an unprecedented scientific dimension to jurisprudence; this academic movement gave rise to the minds behind Justinian's juridic reforms. As a result of the new understanding of the classical juridic texts, the imperial laws of the late fifth and sixth centuries were more cognizable and of a superior style than those of the early <a href="Postclassical_Era" title="wikilink">Postclassical Era</a> according to legal historian George Mousourakis and other scholars.<a href="#fn77" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref77"><sup>77</sup></a><a href="#fn78" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref78"><sup>78</sup></a><a href="#fn79" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref79"><sup>79</sup></a><a href="#fn80" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref80"><sup>80</sup></a></p>
<p>Two professors from the Law School of Beirut, <a href="Dorotheus_(jurist)" title="wikilink">Dorotheus</a> and Anatolius were contributors to Tribonian in the writing of the <a href="Corpus_Juris_Civilis" title="wikilink">Codex of Justinian</a>,<a href="#fn81" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref81"><sup>81</sup></a> the empire's body of civil laws that was issued between 529 and 534 CE and which profoundly impacted the modern western legal system.<a href="#fn82" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref82"><sup>82</sup></a></p>
<p>The school garnered accolades throughout the course of its existence and was bestowed with the title <em>Berytus Nutrix Legum</em>, by <a href="Eunapius" class="uri" title="wikilink">Eunapius</a>, <a href="Libanius" class="uri" title="wikilink">Libanius</a> and <a href="Zacharias_Rhetor" title="wikilink">Zacharias Rhetor</a> and finally by <a href="Justinian_I" title="wikilink">Justinian I</a> himself in his 533 CE <em>Omnem</em> constitution; the constitution reads:<a href="#fn83" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref83"><sup>83</sup></a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>These three works which we have composed we desire should be put in their hands in royal cities as well as in the most fair city of Berytus, which may well be styled the nursing mother of law, as indeed previous Emperors have commanded, but in no other places which did not enjoy the same privilege in old times, as we have heard that even in the brilliant city of Alexandria, and in Caesarea and others, there have been ignorant men who, instead of doing their duty, conveyed spurious lessons to their pupils, and such as these we desire to make desist from that attempt by laying down the above limits, so that, if they should hereafter be guilty of such conduct and carry on their duties outside the royal cities and the metropolis Berytus, they may be punished by a fine of ten pounds of gold and be expelled from the city in which instead of teaching the law they transgress the law.<a href="#fn84" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref84"><sup>84</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>From the third century on, the school tolerated and assimilated <a href="Christianity" title="wikilink">Christian</a> teachings. It produced a number of students who would become influential church leaders and bishops such as <a href="Pamphilus_of_Caesarea" title="wikilink">Pamphilus of Caesarea</a>, <a href="Severus_of_Antioch" title="wikilink">Severus of Antioch</a> and <a href="Aphian" class="uri" title="wikilink">Aphian</a> who, along with his brother <a href="Aedesius_of_Alexandria" title="wikilink">Edesius</a>, converted to Christianity during their studies in Beirut. Under Cyrillus, the first of the Ecumenical Masters, the Christian faith was consolidated as an integral element of the jursitic training.<a href="#fn85" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref85"><sup>85</sup></a><a href="#fn86" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref86"><sup>86</sup></a></p>
