<p><strong>&quot;The Thriving Cult of Greed and Power&quot;</strong> is a <em><a href="TIME" class="uri" title="wikilink">TIME</a></em> magazine article highly critical of <a href="Scientology" class="uri" title="wikilink">Scientology</a> that was first published on <a href="May_6" title="wikilink">May 6</a>, <a href="1991" class="uri" title="wikilink">1991</a> as an eight-page cover story.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a><a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> Written by <a href="investigative_journalist" title="wikilink">investigative journalist</a> <a href="Richard_Behar" title="wikilink">Richard Behar</a>, the article was later published in <em><a href="Reader&#39;s_Digest" title="wikilink">Reader's Digest</a></em> in October 1991.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> Behar had previously published an article on Scientology in <em><a href="Forbes" class="uri" title="wikilink">Forbes</a></em> magazine. He stated that he was investigated by attorneys and private investigators affiliated with the <a href="Church_of_Scientology" title="wikilink">Church of Scientology</a> while researching the <em>TIME</em> article, and that investigators contacted his friends and family as well. Behar's article covers topics including: <a href="L._Ron_Hubbard" title="wikilink">L.

<p>After the article's publication, the Church of Scientology mounted a public relations campaign to inform the public of what it felt were falsehoods in the piece. It took out advertisements in <em><a href="USA_Today" title="wikilink">USA Today</a></em> for twelve weeks, and Church leader <a href="David_Miscavige" title="wikilink">David Miscavige</a> was interviewed by <a href="Ted_Koppel" title="wikilink">Ted Koppel</a> on <em><a href="Nightline" class="uri" title="wikilink">Nightline</a></em> about what he considered to be an objective bias by the article's author. Miscavige alleged that the article was actually driven by the company <a href="Eli_Lilly" title="wikilink">Eli Lilly</a>, because of Scientology's efforts against the drug <a href="Prozac" class="uri" title="wikilink">Prozac</a>. The Church of Scientology brought a <a href="libel" class="uri" title="wikilink">libel</a> suit against <a href="Time_Warner" title="wikilink">Time Warner</a> and Behar, and sued <em><a href="Reader&#39;s_Digest" title="wikilink">Reader's Digest</a></em> in multiple countries in <a href="Europe" class="uri" title="wikilink">Europe</a> in an attempt to stop the article's publication there. The suit against Time Warner was dismissed in 1996, and the Church of Scientology's petition for a writ of <a href="certiorari" class="uri" title="wikilink">certiorari</a> to the <a href="Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States" title="wikilink">Supreme Court of the United States</a> in the case was denied in 2001.</p>
<p>Behar received awards in honor of his work on the article, including the <a href="Gerald_Loeb_Award" title="wikilink">Gerald Loeb Award</a>, the <a href="Worth_Bingham_Prize" title="wikilink">Worth Bingham Prize</a>, and the <a href="Conscience-in-Media_Award" title="wikilink">Conscience-in-Media Award</a>. In commentary on the piece, the book <em>Let Them Eat Prozac</em> was critical, and the book <em>Unsecular Media</em> characterized one of the segments of the article an <a href="atrocity_tale" title="wikilink">atrocity tale</a>. The article has had ramifications in the current treatment of Scientology in the media, with some publications theorizing that journalists are wary of the litigation that Time Warner went through. The article has been cited by <a href="Anderson_Cooper" title="wikilink">Anderson Cooper</a> on <a href="CNN" class="uri" title="wikilink">CNN</a>, in a story on <em><a href="Panorama_(TV_series)" title="wikilink">Panorama</a></em>'s 2007 program &quot;<a href="Scientology_and_Me" title="wikilink">Scientology and Me</a>&quot; on the <a href="BBC" class="uri" title="wikilink">BBC</a>, and has been used as a reference for background on the history of Scientology, in books from both the <a href="cult" class="uri" title="wikilink">cult</a> and <a href="new_religious_movement" title="wikilink">new religious movement</a> perspectives.</p>

<p>The <a href="Church_of_Scientology" title="wikilink">Church of Scientology</a> responded to the publication of &quot;The Thriving Cult of Greed and Power&quot; by taking out color full-page ads in <em><a href="USA_Today" title="wikilink">USA Today</a></em> in May and June 1991, on every weekday for twelve weeks, protesting the <em>TIME</em> magazine cover article.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> Two official Church of Scientology responses were titled &quot;Facts vs. Fiction, A Correction of Falsehoods Contained in the May 6, 1991 Issues of <em>TIME Magazine</em>&quot;, and &quot;The Story That <em>TIME</em> Couldn't Tell&quot;.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> Prior to the advertising campaign, Scientologists distributed 88-page bound booklets which disputed points from Behar's article.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> The &quot;Fact vs. Fiction&quot; piece was a quarter-inch thick booklet, which criticized Behar's article and asserted &quot;Behar's article omits the information on the dozens of community service programs conducted by Scientologists ... which have been acknowledged by community officials&quot;.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> One of the advertisements in <em>USA Today</em> accused <em>TIME</em> of promoting <a href="Adolf_Hitler" title="wikilink">Adolf Hitler</a> and <a href="Nazi_Germany" title="wikilink">Nazi Germany</a>, and featured a 1936 issue of <em>TIME</em> which had Hitler's picture on the front cover.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> The Church of Scientology sent out a news release condemning <em>TIME</em>'s &quot;horrible history of supporting fascism,&quot; and said that the article was written because <em>TIME</em> had been pressured by &quot;vested interests&quot;.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> When asked by the <em>St. Petersburg Times</em> if this was the case, <em>TIME</em> Executive Editor Richard Duncan responded &quot;Good Lord, no&quot;.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> <a href="Heber_Jentzsch" title="wikilink">Heber Jentzsch</a>, at the time president of Church of Scientology International, released a four-page news release which stated &quot;Advertising is the only way the church could be assured of getting its message and its side of the story out to the public without the same vested interests behind the Time article distorting it&quot;.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a></p>
<p>After the advertising run critiquing <em>TIME</em> magazine in <em>USA Today</em> had completed, the Church of Scientology mounted a <a href="USD" title="wikilink">USD$</a>3 million public relations campaign about Scientology in <em>USA Today</em>, in June 1991.<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> The Church of Scientology placed a 48-page advertising supplement in 1.8 million copies of <em>USA Today</em>.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a> In a statement to the <em><a href="St._Petersburg_Times" title="wikilink">St. Petersburg Times</a></em>, Scientology spokesman Richard Haworth explained &quot;What we are trying to do is put the actual facts of dianetics and Scientology out there&quot;.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a></p>
<p>In response to the Church of Scientology's claims of inaccuracies in the article, a lawyer for <em>TIME</em> responded &quot;We've reviewed all of their allegations, and find nothing wrong with the Time story.&quot;<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a> In June 1991, <em><a href="Newsweek" class="uri" title="wikilink">Newsweek</a></em> reported that staffers for <em>TIME</em> said they had received calls from a man claiming to be a <a href="paralegal" class="uri" title="wikilink">paralegal</a> for <em>TIME</em>, who asked them if they had signed a confidentiality form about the article.<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a> <em>TIME</em> editors sent staffers a computer memo, warning them about calls related to the article, and staffers told <em>Newsweek</em> that &quot;sources named in the story say detectives have asked about their talks with Time&quot;.<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a> A Church of Scientology spokesman called the claims &quot;scurrillous&quot;.<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a></p>

Behar appeared on the program and gave his opinion of why individuals join Scientology, stating that the &quot;ulterior motive&quot; is really to get people to take high-priced <a href="Auditing_(Scientology)" title="wikilink">audit counseling</a>.<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a> Behar stated on the program that he had evidence that members of the Church of Scientology had obtained his personal phone records.<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a> Later in the program, Koppel questioned Miscavige on the Church of Scientology's response to the <em>TIME</em> magazine article, particularly the $3 million the church spent advertising in <em>USA Today</em>.<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a> Miscavige explained that the first three weeks of the advertising campaign was meant to correct falsehoods from the <em>TIME</em> article, and the rest of the twelve-week campaign was dedicated to informing the public about Scientology. Koppel asked Miscavige what specifically had upset him about the <em>TIME</em> article, and Miscavige called Behar &quot;a hater&quot;.<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a> Miscavige noted that Behar had written an article on Scientology and the Internal Revenue Service three years before he began work on the <em>TIME</em> piece, and made allegations that Behar had attempted to get two Scientologists kidnapped. When Koppel questioned Miscavige further on this, Miscavige said that individuals had contacted Behar after an earlier article, and Behar had told them to &quot;kidnap Scientologists out&quot;.<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a> Koppel pressed further, noting that this was a serious charge to make, and asked Miscavige if his allegations were accurate, why he had not pressed charges for attempted kidnapping. Miscavige said Koppel was &quot;missing the issue,&quot; and said that his real point was that he thought the article was not an objective piece.<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a></p>
<p>Miscavige alleged on <em>Nightline</em> that the article itself was published from a request by <a href="Eli_Lilly" title="wikilink">Eli Lilly</a>, due to &quot;the damage we had caused to their killer drug Prozac&quot;.<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a> When Koppel asked Miscavige if he had affidavits or evidence to this effect, Miscavige responded &quot;You think they'd admit it?&quot;<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a> Miscavige stated that &quot;Eli Lilly ordered a reprint of 750,000 copies of Time magazine before it came out,&quot; and that his attempts to investigate the matter with Eli Lilly and associated advertising companies were not successful.<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a></p>

<h2 id="analysis">Analysis</h2>
<p>Several secondary sources have commented on the article and used it as a reference for background on Scientology.<a href="#fn108" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref108"><sup>108</sup></a><a href="#fn109" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref109"><sup>109</sup></a> Not all analysis of the article has been positive. David Healy's book criticizing the <a href="pharmaceutical_industry" title="wikilink">pharmaceutical industry</a>, <em>Let Them Eat Prozac</em>, was critical of the <em>TIME</em> article, saying that &quot;Even Saddam Hussein was portrayed less badly&quot;. Healy addressed the article's claim that lawsuits were one of the Church's key tactics against enemies. He noted that the <a href="Citizens_Commission_on_Human_Rights" title="wikilink">Citizens Commission on Human Rights</a> (CCHR), a Church of Scientology affiliated group discussed in the article, had filed a petition with the <a href="Food_and_Drug_Administration" title="wikilink">Food and Drug Administration</a> inquiring what it was going to do about <a href="Prozac" class="uri" title="wikilink">Prozac</a>. Healy dismissed the notion that CCHR engaged in &quot;orchestrated campaigns,&quot; writing that very few of the fifty lawsuits filed against Prozac were related to the Church of Scientology.<a href="#fn110" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref110"><sup>110</sup></a> Mark Silk criticized Behar's article in his book <em>Unsecular Media: Making News of Religion in America</em>.<a href="#fn111" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref111"><sup>111</sup></a> Silk classified the work among what he referred to as the &quot;false-prophecy topos,&quot; and characterized Behar's account of Noah Lottick's suicide as an <a href="atrocity_tale" title="wikilink">atrocity tale</a>.<a href="#fn112" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref112"><sup>112</sup></a></p>
<p><em>Insane Therapy</em> noted that Scientology &quot;achieved more notoriety ... with the publication of the journalist Richard Behar's highly critical article&quot;.<a href="#fn113" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref113"><sup>113</sup></a> <em><a href="Larson&#39;s_Book_of_World_Religions_and_Alternative_Spirituality" title="wikilink">Larson's Book of World Religions and Alternative Spirituality</a></em> described the cover design of the article as it appeared in <em>TIME</em>, writing that it &quot;shouted&quot; the headline from the magazine cover.<a href="#fn114" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref114"><sup>114</sup></a> In a 2005 piece, <em><a href="Salon.com" class="uri" title="wikilink">Salon.com</a></em> magazine noted that for those interested in the Church of Scientology, the <em>TIME</em> article still remains a &quot;milestone in news coverage,&quot; and that those who back the Church believe it was &quot;an outrageously biased account&quot;.<a href="#fn115" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref115"><sup>115</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="legacy">Legacy</h2>
<p>The Church of Scientology's use of private investigators was cited in a 1998 article in <em><a href="The_Boston_Herald" title="wikilink">The Boston Herald</a></em>, and compared to Behar's experiences when researching &quot;The Thriving Cult of Greed and Power&quot;.<a href="#fn116" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref116"><sup>116</sup></a> After the paper ran a five-part series of critical articles in 1998, Church of Scientology President <a href="Heber_Jentzsch" title="wikilink">Heber Jentzsch</a> confirmed that a private investigative firm was hired to look into the personal life of Joseph Mallia, the reporter who wrote the articles.<a href="#fn117" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref117"><sup>117</sup></a> In a later piece titled &quot;Church of Scientology probes Herald reporter — Investigation follows pattern of harassment&quot; this investigation was likened to Behar's assertions of harassment, as well as other reporters' experiences from 1974, 1988, and 1997.<a href="#fn118" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref118"><sup>118</sup></a></p>
<p>Due to the controversial history between <em>Readers Digest</em> and Scientology, the writer of a 2005 cover story on <a href="Tom_Cruise" title="wikilink">Tom Cruise</a> agreed to certain demands, including giving Scientology issues equal play in the writer's profile of Cruise, submitting questions for Cruise to Church of Scientology handlers, and sending the writer of the article to a one-day Church immersion course.<a href="#fn119" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref119"><sup>119</sup></a> Also in 2005, an article in <em>Salon</em> questioned whether the tactics of the Church's litigation and private investigations of Time Warner and other media sources had succeeded in decreasing the amount of investigative journalism pieces on Scientology in the press.<a href="#fn120" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref120"><sup>120</sup></a> A 2005 article in <em><a href="The_Sunday_Times" title="wikilink">The Sunday Times</a></em> cited the article, and came to the determination that the Church of Scientology's lawsuit against Time Warner &quot;served to warn off other potential investigations,&quot; and that &quot;The chill evidently lingers still&quot;.<a href="#fn121" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref121"><sup>121</sup></a></p>
<p>&quot;The Thriving Cult of Greed and Power&quot; continues to be used today by journalists in the media, as a reference for historical information on the Church of Scientology.<a href="#fn122" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref122"><sup>122</sup></a><a href="#fn123" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref123"><sup>123</sup></a><a href="#fn124" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref124"><sup>124</sup></a><a href="#fn125" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref125"><sup>125</sup></a> In April 2007, <a href="CNN" class="uri" title="wikilink">CNN</a> anchor <a href="Anderson_Cooper" title="wikilink">Anderson Cooper</a> interviewed <a href="Office_of_Special_Affairs" title="wikilink">Office of Special Affairs</a> director <a href="Mike_Rinder" title="wikilink">Mike Rinder</a> live, in a piece on <em><a href="Anderson_Cooper_360" title="wikilink">Anderson Cooper 360</a></em> titled &quot;Inside Scientology&quot;.<a href="#fn126" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref126"><sup>126</sup></a> The CNN story was prompted by the May 2007 airing of a <a href="BBC" class="uri" title="wikilink">BBC</a> <em><a href="Panorama_(TV_series)" title="wikilink">Panorama</a></em> <a href="investigative_journalism" title="wikilink">investigative</a> program, &quot;<a href="Scientology_and_Me" title="wikilink">Scientology and Me</a>&quot;. In the interview, Anderson Cooper quoted directly from &quot;The Thriving Cult of Greed and Power&quot; article, when asking Rinder about the history of <a href="Operation_Snow_White" title="wikilink">Operation Snow White</a>, and if those tactics were currently used by the Church.<a href="#fn127" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref127"><sup>127</sup></a> Rinder answered by stating that the individuals involved with Operation Snow White were no longer involved in Church of Scientology activities, and that the incident was &quot;ancient history&quot;. Cooper then again referenced the <em>TIME</em> magazine article noting that Behar asserted that he was illegally investigated by Scientology contacts during research for his article.<a href="#fn128" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref128"><sup>128</sup></a> Cooper questioned Rinder on the dismissed lawsuit against <a href="Time_Warner" title="wikilink">Time Warner</a>, and Rinder acknowledged that all of the Church of Scientology's appeals against Time Warner were eventually thrown out.<a href="#fn129" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref129"><sup>129</sup></a></p>
