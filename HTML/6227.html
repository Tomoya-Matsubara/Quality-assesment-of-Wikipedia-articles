<p><strong>Charles Wade Barkley</strong> (born February 20, 1963) is a retired American professional <a href="basketball" class="uri" title="wikilink">basketball</a> player. Nicknamed &quot;<strong>Sir Charles</strong>&quot; for his aggressive and outspoken demeanor, and &quot;<strong>The Round Mound of Rebound</strong>&quot; for his unusual build and talent, Barkley established himself as one of the <a href="National_Basketball_Association" title="wikilink">National Basketball Association</a>'s (NBA's) most dominating <a href="Power_forward_(basketball)" title="wikilink">power forwards</a>. He was selected to the <a href="All-NBA" class="uri" title="wikilink">All-NBA</a> First Team five times, the All-NBA Second Team five times, and once to the All-NBA Third Team. He earned eleven <a href="NBA_All-Star_Game" title="wikilink">NBA All-Star Game</a> appearances and was named the <a href="NBA_All-Star_Game_Most_Valuable_Player_Award" title="wikilink">All-Star MVP</a> in 1991. In 1993, he was voted the league's <a href="NBA_Most_Valuable_Player_Award" title="wikilink">Most Valuable Player</a> and during the NBA's 50th anniversary, named one of the <a href="NBA&#39;s_50th_Anniversary_All-Time_Team" title="wikilink">50 Greatest Players in NBA History</a>. He competed in the <a href="Basketball_at_the_1992_Summer_Olympics" title="wikilink">1992</a> and <a href="Basketball_at_the_1996_Summer_Olympics" title="wikilink">1996</a> <a href="Basketball_at_the_Summer_Olympics" title="wikilink">Olympic games</a> and won two gold medals as a member of the <a href="United_States_men&#39;s_national_basketball_team" title="wikilink">United States</a>' <a href="United_States_men&#39;s_national_basketball_team#1992_The_Dream_Team" title="wikilink">Dream Team</a>.

<p>Barkley was popular with the fans and media and made the NBA's All-Interview Team for his last 13 seasons in the league.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> He was frequently involved in on- and off-court fights and sometimes stirred national controversy, as in March 1991 when he mistakenly spat on a young girl, and as in 1993 when he declared that sports figures should not be considered role models. Short for a power forward, Barkley used his strength and aggressiveness to become one of the NBA's most dominant <a href="rebound_(basketball)" title="wikilink">rebounders</a>. He was a versatile player who had the ability to score, create plays, and defend. In 2000, he retired as one of only four players in NBA history with 20,000 <a href="point_(basketball)" title="wikilink">points</a>, 10,000 rebounds and 4,000 <a href="Assist_(basketball)" title="wikilink">assists</a><a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a>, although a fifth player, Kevin Garnett, has since accomplished that feat.</p>
<p>Since retiring as a player, Barkley has had a successful career as a <a href="color_commentator" title="wikilink">color commentator</a> on basketball. He works with <a href="Turner_Network_Television" title="wikilink">Turner Network Television</a> (TNT) as a studio pundit for its coverage of NBA games.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> In addition, Barkley has written several books and has shown an interest in politics; in October 2008, he announced that he will be running for <a href="Governor_of_Alabama" title="wikilink">Governor of Alabama</a> in 2014.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="early-life">Early life</h2>
<p>Barkley was born and raised in suburban <a href="Leeds,_Alabama" title="wikilink">Leeds, Alabama</a>, ten miles (16 km) outside of <a href="Birmingham,_Alabama" title="wikilink">Birmingham</a>, and attended <a href="Leeds_High_School" title="wikilink">Leeds High School</a>. As a junior, Barkley stood 5'10&quot; (1.78 m) and weighed 220 pounds (99.8 kg). He failed to make the <a href="varsity_team" title="wikilink">varsity team</a> and was named as a reserve. However, during the summer Barkley grew to 6'4&quot; and earned a starting position on the varsity team in his senior year. He averaged 19.1 points and 17.9 rebounds per game and led his team to a 26&lt;U+2013&gt;3 record en route to the state semifinals.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> Despite his improvement, Barkley garnered no attention from college scouts until the state high school semifinals, where he scored 26 points against Alabama's most highly recruited player, <a href="Bobby_Lee_Hurt" title="wikilink">Bobby Lee Hurt</a>.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> An assistant to <a href="Auburn_University" title="wikilink">Auburn University's</a> head coach, <a href="Sonny_Smith" title="wikilink">Sonny Smith</a>, was at the game and reported seeing, &quot;a fat guy... who can play like the wind&quot;.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> Barkley was soon recruited by Smith and <a href="academic_major" title="wikilink">majored</a> in <a href="business_management" title="wikilink">business management</a> while attending Auburn University.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>

<p>Barkley played <a href="college_basketball" title="wikilink">collegiate basketball</a> at <a href="Auburn_University" title="wikilink">Auburn University</a> for three years. Although he struggled to control his weight, he excelled as a player and led the SEC in rebounding each year.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> He became a popular crowd-pleaser, exciting the fans with <a href="slam_dunk" title="wikilink">dunks</a> and <a href="Block_(basketball)" title="wikilink">blocked shots</a> that belied his lack of height and overweight frame. It was not uncommon to see the hefty Barkley grab a defensive rebound and, instead of passing, <a href="Dribble#Basketball" title="wikilink">dribble</a> the entire length of the court and finish at the opposite end with a two-handed dunk. His physical size and skills ultimately earned him the nickname &quot;The Round Mound of Rebound.&quot;<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<p>During his college career, Barkley played the <a href="center_(basketball)" title="wikilink">center</a> position, despite being shorter than the average center.

<p>Barkley left before his final year at Auburn and made himself eligible for the <a href="1984_NBA_Draft" title="wikilink">1984 NBA Draft</a>. He was selected with the fifth pick in the first round by the <a href="Philadelphia_76ers" title="wikilink">Philadelphia 76ers</a>, two slots after the <a href="Chicago_Bulls" title="wikilink">Chicago Bulls</a> drafted <a href="Michael_Jordan" title="wikilink">Michael Jordan</a>.

<p>During his career with the Suns, Barkley excelled as a player, earning All-NBA and All-Star honors in each of his four seasons. The always outspoken Barkley, however, continued to stir up controversy during the 1993 season, when he claimed that sports figures should not be role models.<a href="#fn93" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref93"><sup>93</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="role-model-controversy">Role model controversy</h3>
<p>Throughout his career, Barkley had been arguing that athletes should not be considered role models.<a href="#fn94" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref94"><sup>94</sup></a> He stated, &quot;A million guys can dunk a basketball in jail; should they be role models?&quot; In 1993, his argument prompted national news when he wrote the text for his &quot;I am not a role model&quot; Nike commercial. <a href="Dan_Quayle" title="wikilink">Dan Quayle</a>, the former <a href="Vice_President_of_the_United_States" title="wikilink">Vice President of the United States</a>, called it a &quot;family-values message&quot; for Barkley's oft-ignored call for parents and teachers to quit looking to him to &quot;raise your kids&quot; and instead be role models themselves.<a href="#fn95" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref95"><sup>95</sup></a></p>
<p>Barkley's message sparked a great public debate about the nature of role models. He argued,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I think the media demands that athletes be role models because there's some jealousy involved. It's as if they say, this is a young black kid playing a game for a living and making all this money, so we're going to make it tough on him. And what they're really doing is telling kids to look up to someone they can't become, because not many people can be like we are.

International rules which had previously prevented NBA players from playing in the Olympics were changed in 1992, allowing Barkley and fellow NBA players to compete in the Olympics for the first time.

<h2 id="player-profile">Player profile</h2>
<p>Barkley played the <a href="Power_forward_(basketball)" title="wikilink">power forward</a> position but on some occasions he would play the <a href="small_forward" title="wikilink">small forward</a> and <a href="Center_(basketball)" title="wikilink">center</a> positions. He was known for his unusual build as a basketball player, stockier than most small forwards, yet shorter than most power forwards he faced. However, Barkley was still capable of outplaying both taller and quicker opponents because of his strength and agility.<a href="#fn120" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref120"><sup>120</sup></a></p>
<p>Barkley was a prolific scorer who averaged 22.1 points-per-game for his season career and 23.0 points-per-game for his playoff career.<a href="#fn121" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref121"><sup>121</sup></a> He was one of the NBA's most versatile players and accurate scorers capable of scoring from anywhere on the court and established himself as one of the NBA's premier <a href="Clutch_(sports)" title="wikilink">clutch</a> players.<a href="#fn122" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref122"><sup>122</sup></a> During his NBA career, Barkley was a constant mismatch because he possessed a set of very uncommon skills and could play in a variety of positions. He would use all facets of his game in a single play; as a scorer, he had the ability to score from the perimeter and the post, using an array of spin moves and <a href="Fadeaway" title="wikilink">fadeaways</a>, or finishing a fast break with a powerful dunk. He was one of the most efficient scorers of all-time, scoring at 54.13% total <a href="field_goal_percentage" title="wikilink">field goal percentage</a> for his season career and 51.34% total <a href="field_goal_percentage" title="wikilink">field goal shooting</a> for his playoff career (including a career season high of 60% during the <a href="1989&lt;U+2013&gt;90_NBA_season" title="wikilink">1989&lt;U+2013&gt;90 NBA season</a>).<a href="#fn123" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref123"><sup>123</sup></a></p>

<p>Barkley also possessed considerable defensive talents led by an aggressive demeanor, foot speed and his capacity to read the floor to anticipate for steals, a reason why he established his career as the second All-Time leader in steals for the power forward position<a href="#fn130" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref130"><sup>130</sup></a> and leader of the highest all-time steal per game average for the power forward position.<a href="#fn131" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref131"><sup>131</sup></a> Despite being undersized for both the small forward and power forward positions, he also finished among the all-time leaders in blocked shots.<a href="#fn132" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref132"><sup>132</sup></a> His speed and leaping ability made him one of the few power forwards capable of running down court to block a faster player with a <a href="chase-down_block" title="wikilink">chase-down block</a>.<a href="#fn133" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref133"><sup>133</sup></a></p>

<h2 id="legacy">Legacy</h2>
<p>During his 16-year NBA career, Barkley was regarded as one of the most controversial, outspoken and dominating players in the history of basketball. His impact on the sport went beyond his rebounding titles, assists, scoring and physical play.<a href="#fn135" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref135"><sup>135</sup></a> His larger than life persona and confrontational mannerisms often led to <a href="technical_foul" title="wikilink">technical fouls</a> and fines and sometimes gave rise to national controversy, such as when he was featured in ads that rejected pro athletes as <a href="role_model" title="wikilink">role models</a> and declared, &quot;I am not a role model.&quot;<a href="#fn136" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref136"><sup>136</sup></a> Although his words often led to controversy, according to Barkley his mouth was never the cause because it always spoke the truth.<a href="#fn137" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref137"><sup>137</sup></a> He stated, &quot;I don't create controversies.

<p>Since 2000, Barkley has served as a studio analyst for <a href="Turner_Network_Television" title="wikilink">Turner Network Television</a> (TNT).<a href="#fn150" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref150"><sup>150</sup></a><a href="#fn151" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref151"><sup>151</sup></a> He appears on the network's NBA coverage during pre-game and halftime shows, in addition to special NBA events. He also appears on an original program for the network entitled <em><a href="Inside_the_NBA" title="wikilink">Inside the NBA</a></em>, a post-game show during which Barkley, <a href="Ernie_Johnson,_Jr." title="wikilink">Ernie Johnson Jr.</a> and <a href="Kenny_Smith" title="wikilink">Kenny Smith</a> recap and comment on NBA games that have occurred during the day and also on general NBA affairs.<a href="#fn152" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref152"><sup>152</sup></a></p>
<p>During the broadcast of a game, in which Barkley was courtside with <a href="Marv_Albert" title="wikilink">Marv Albert</a>, Barkley poked fun at NBA official <a href="Dick_Bavetta" title="wikilink">Dick Bavetta</a>'s age. Albert replied to Barkley, &quot;I believe Dick would beat you in a footrace.&quot; In response to that remark, Barkley went on to challenge Bavetta to a race at the <a href="2007_NBA_All-Star_Weekend" title="wikilink">2007 NBA All-Star Weekend</a> for $5,000. The winner was to choose a charity to which the money would be donated. The NBA agreed to pitch in an additional $50,000, and TNT threw in $25,000. The pair raced for three and a half lengths of the basketball court until Barkley ultimately won. After the event, the two embraced in a show of good sportsmanship.<a href="#fn153" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref153"><sup>153</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="gambling">Gambling</h3>
<p>Barkley is known for his <a href="compulsive_gambler" title="wikilink">compulsive gambling</a>. In an interview with <a href="ESPN" class="uri" title="wikilink">ESPN</a>'s <a href="Trey_Wingo" title="wikilink">Trey Wingo</a>, Barkley revealed that he lost approximately <a href="Dollar_sign" title="wikilink">$</a>10 million through <a href="gambling" class="uri" title="wikilink">gambling</a>.<a href="#fn154" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref154"><sup>154</sup></a> In addition, he also admitted to losing $2.5 million, &quot;in a six-hour period&quot;, while playing <a href="blackjack" class="uri" title="wikilink">blackjack</a>.<a href="#fn155" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref155"><sup>155</sup></a> Although Barkley openly admits to his problem, he claims it is not serious since he can afford to support the habit.<a href="#fn156" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref156"><sup>156</sup></a> When approached by fellow <a href="Turner_Sports" title="wikilink">TNT</a> broadcaster <a href="Ernie_Johnson_Jr." title="wikilink">Ernie Johnson</a> about the issue, Barkley replied, &quot;It's not a problem. If you're a drug addict or an alcoholic, those are problems. I gamble for too much money. As long as I can continue to do it I don't think it's a problem. Do I think it's a bad habit? Yes, I think it's a bad habit. Am I going to continue to do it? Yes, I'm going to continue to do it.&quot;<a href="#fn157" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref157"><sup>157</sup></a></p>
<p>Despite suffering big losses, Barkley also claims to have won on several occasions. During a trip to <a href="Las_Vegas_Strip" title="wikilink">Las Vegas</a>, he claims to have won $700,000 from playing <a href="blackjack" class="uri" title="wikilink">blackjack</a> and betting on the <a href="Indianapolis_Colts" title="wikilink">Indianapolis Colts</a> to defeat the <a href="Chicago_Bears" title="wikilink">Chicago Bears</a> in <a href="Super_Bowl_XLI" title="wikilink">Super Bowl XLI</a>.<a href="#fn158" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref158"><sup>158</sup></a> He went on to state, however, &quot;No matter how much I win it ain't a lot. It's only a lot when I lose. And you always lose. I think it's fun, I think it's exciting. I'm gonna continue to do it but I have to get to a point where I don't try to break the casino 'cause you never can.&quot;<a href="#fn159" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref159"><sup>159</sup></a></p>
<p>In May 2008, the <a href="Wynn_Las_Vegas" title="wikilink">Wynn Las Vegas</a> casino filed a civil complaint against Barkley, alleging that he had failed to pay a $400,000 debt stemming from October 2007. Barkley responded by taking blame for letting time lapse on the repayment of the debt and promptly paid the casino.<a href="#fn160" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref160"><sup>160</sup></a> After repaying his debt, Barkley stated during a pregame show on TNT, &quot;I've got to stop gambling...I am not going to gamble anymore. For right now, the next year or two, I'm not going to gamble... Just because I can afford to lose money doesn't mean I should do it.&quot;<a href="#fn161" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref161"><sup>161</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="politics">Politics</h3>
<p>Barkley spoke for many years of his <a href="Republican_Party_(United_States)" title="wikilink">Republican Party</a> affiliation. In 1995, he considered running as a Republican candidate for <a href="Alabama" class="uri" title="wikilink">Alabama</a>'s governorship in the <a href="Alabama_gubernatorial_election,_1998" title="wikilink">1998 election</a>.<a href="#fn162" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref162"><sup>162</sup></a> However, in 2006, he altered his political stance.<a href="#fn163" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref163"><sup>163</sup></a> At a July 2006 meeting of the Southern Regional Conference of the National School Boards Association in <a href="Destin,_Florida" title="wikilink">Destin, Florida</a>, Barkley lent credence to the idea of running for <a href="Governor_of_Alabama" title="wikilink">Governor of Alabama</a>, stating:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I'm serious. I've got to get people to realize that the government is full of it. Republicans and Democrats want to argue over stuff that's not important, like gay marriage or the war in Iraq or illegal immigration... When I run &lt;U+2014&gt; if I run &lt;U+2014&gt; we're going to talk about real issues like improving our schools, cleaning up our neighborhoods of drugs and crime and making Alabama a better place for all people.<a href="#fn164" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref164"><sup>164</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In September 2006, Barkley once again reiterated his desire to run for Governor. He noted, &quot;I can't run until 2014 ... I have to live there for seven years, so I'm looking for a house there as we speak.&quot;<a href="#fn165" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref165"><sup>165</sup></a> In July 2007, he made a video declaring his support for <a href="Barack_Obama" title="wikilink">Barack Obama</a> in the 2008 Presidential election.<a href="#fn166" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref166"><sup>166</sup></a> In September 2007, during a broadcast on <a href="Monday_Night_Football" title="wikilink">Monday Night Football</a>, Barkley announced that he bought a house in Alabama to satisfy residency requirements for a 2014 campaign for governor. In addition, Barkley declared himself an <a href="Independent_(politician)" title="wikilink">Independent</a> and not a <a href="Democratic_Party_(United_States)" title="wikilink">Democrat</a> as previously reported. &quot;The Republicans are full of it,&quot; Barkley said, &quot;The Democrats are a little less full of it.&quot;<a href="#fn167" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref167"><sup>167</sup></a></p>
<p>In February 2008, Barkley announced that he would be running for Governor of Alabama in 2014 as an Independent. On October 27, 2008, he officially announced his candidacy for Governor of Alabama in an interview with <a href="CNN" class="uri" title="wikilink">CNN</a>, stating that he planned to run in the 2014 election cycle,<a href="#fn168" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref168"><sup>168</sup></a> but he began to back off the idea in a November 24, 2009 interview on <em><a href="The_Jay_Leno_Show" title="wikilink">The Jay Leno Show</a></em>.<a href="#fn169" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref169"><sup>169</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="books">Books</h3>
<p>In 2000, Barkley wrote the <a href="foreword" class="uri" title="wikilink">foreword</a> for <em><a href="Sports_Illustrated" title="wikilink">Sports Illustrated</a></em> columnist <a href="Rick_Reilly" title="wikilink">Rick Reilly</a>'s book <em>The Life of Reilly.</em> In it, Barkley quipped, &quot;Of all the people in sports I'd like to throw through a plate glass window, Reilly's not one of them. It's a shame though, skinny white boys look <em>real</em> aerodynamic.&quot;<a href="#fn170" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref170"><sup>170</sup></a> In 2002, Barkley released the book <em><a href="I_May_Be_Wrong,_But_I_Doubt_It" title="wikilink">I May Be Wrong, But I Doubt It</a></em>, which included editing and commentary by close friend <a href="Michael_Wilbon" title="wikilink">Michael Wilbon</a>.<a href="#fn171" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref171"><sup>171</sup></a> Three years later, Barkley released <em>Who's Afraid of a Large Black Man?,</em> which is a collection of interviews with leading figures in entertainment, business, sports, and government. Michael Wilbon also contributed to this book and was present at many of the interviews.<a href="#fn172" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref172"><sup>172</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="dui-conviction">DUI conviction</h3>
<p>On December 31, 2008, Barkley was pulled over in <a href="Scottsdale,_Arizona" title="wikilink">Scottsdale</a>, <a href="Arizona" class="uri" title="wikilink">Arizona</a>, for initially running a stop sign.<a href="#fn173" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref173"><sup>173</sup></a> Officers smelled alcohol on Barkley's breath and proceeded to administer field sobriety tests, which he failed. He was arrested on drunk driving charges and had his vehicle impounded. Barkley refused to submit a breath test and was given a <a href="blood_test" title="wikilink">blood test</a>.<a href="#fn174" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref174"><sup>174</sup></a> He was then cited and released.<a href="#fn175" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref175"><sup>175</sup></a> Gilbert police noted Barkley was cooperative and respectful during the entire incident, adding that he was treated no differently than anyone arrested on DUI charges.<a href="#fn176" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref176"><sup>176</sup></a> The police report of the incident stated that Barkley told police he was in a hurry to receive oral sex from his female passenger when he ran through a stop sign early Wednesday.<a href="#fn177" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref177"><sup>177</sup></a> Test results released by police showed that Barkley had a blood-alcohol level at .149, nearly twice the legal limit of .08 in Arizona.<a href="#fn178" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref178"><sup>178</sup></a> Two months after his arrest, Barkley pleaded guilty to two DUI-related counts and one count of running a red light. He was sentenced to ten days in jail and fined $2,000.<a href="#fn179" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref179"><sup>179</sup></a> The sentence was later reduced to three days after Barkley entered an alcohol treatment program.<a href="#fn180" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref180"><sup>180</sup></a></p>
<p>As part of the fallout of his arrest, Barkley took a two-month <a href="Wikt:hiatus" title="wikilink">hiatus</a> from his commentating duties for <a href="Turner_Network_Television" title="wikilink">TNT</a>.<a href="#fn181" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref181"><sup>181</sup></a> During his absence, <a href="T-Mobile" class="uri" title="wikilink">T-Mobile</a> elected not to air previously scheduled ads that featured Barkley, stating, &quot;Given the recent developments, for the time being, we've replaced TV ads featuring Mr. Barkley with more general-market advertising.&quot;<a href="#fn182" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref182"><sup>182</sup></a> On February 19, 2009, Barkley returned to TNT and spent the first segment of the NBA pregame show discussing the incident and his experiences.<a href="#fn183" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref183"><sup>183</sup></a> Shortly after his return, T-Mobile once again began airing ads featuring Barkley.</p>
<h3 id="the-haney-project">The Haney Project</h3>
<p>Barkley is well known for his fondness of golf. However, his <a href="stroke_mechanics_(golf)" title="wikilink">swing</a> is often regarded as one of the most bizarre and broken swings in the sport.<a href="#fn184" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref184"><sup>184</sup></a> Barkley's swing unravels after he brings his club back. He starts to take it forward then jerks to a stop, throwing his body off balance, before wildly striking at the ball.<a href="#fn185" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref185"><sup>185</sup></a> Once a 10-<a href="Golf_handicap" title="wikilink">handicap</a> golfer who could break 80, Barkley can no longer break 100 and finished last at the American Century Celebrity Golf Championship in July 2008.<a href="#fn186" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref186"><sup>186</sup></a></p>
<p>A reality series known as &quot;The Haney Project&quot; premiered on <a href="The_Golf_Channel" title="wikilink">The Golf Channel</a> starring Charles Barkley and <a href="Hank_Haney" title="wikilink">Hank Haney</a>, one of the world's top golf instructors.<a href="#fn187" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref187"><sup>187</sup></a> The show centers on Hank Haney attempting to use his renowned expertise and teaching methods to fix Barkley's swing.<a href="#fn188" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref188"><sup>188</sup></a> Haney believes he can help Barkley lower his handicap and notes that Barkley's short game is strong and that his putting is even stronger.<a href="#fn189" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref189"><sup>189</sup></a></p>
