<p><strong><em>Chandralekha</em></strong> (also spelled <strong><em>Chandraleka</em></strong>) is a 1948 <a href="Indian_cinema" title="wikilink">Indian</a> <a href="Tamil_cinema" title="wikilink">Tamil</a> <a href="historical_fiction" title="wikilink">historical fiction</a> film directed and produced by <a href="S._S._Vasan" title="wikilink">S. S. Vasan</a>. Starring <a href="T._R._Rajakumari" title="wikilink">T. R. Rajakumari</a>, <a href="M._K._Radha" title="wikilink">M. K. Radha</a> and <a href="Ranjan_(actor)" title="wikilink">Ranjan</a> in the lead roles, the film follows two brothers named Veerasimhan and Sasankan, who fight with each other over ruling their father's kingdom and for marrying the village dancer Chandralekha.</p>
<p>The development of <em>Chandralekha</em> began in the early 1940s when, after two successive box office hits, Vasan announced that his next film would be titled <em>Chandralekha</em>. However, when he launched an advertising campaign for the film, he had only the name of the heroine from a storyline by <a href="Gemini_Studios" title="wikilink">Gemini Studios</a>' story department he had rejected. Veppathur Kittoo, one of his storyboard artists, eventually developed a story based on a chapter of <a href="George_W._M._Reynolds" title="wikilink">George W. M. Reynolds</a>' novel <em>Robert Macaire: or, The French bandit in England</em> (1848), which impressed Vasan. The original director T. G. Raghavachari directed more than half of the film, then left the project because of disagreements with Vasan, who took over the film in his directorial debut.</p>
<p>Originally made in Tamil and later in <a href="Hindi" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hindi</a>, <em>Chandralekha</em> was in production for five years from 1943 to 1948. It went through a number of changes to the script, cast and production, and ultimately became the most expensive film made in India at the time; the budget for a single sequence equalled that typical for an entire film of the period. Vasan mortgaged all of his property and even sold his jewellery to complete the film. Cinematography was by Kamal Ghosh and K. Ramnoth. The music was largely inspired by both Indian and Western classical music; it was composed by <a href="S._Rajeswara_Rao" title="wikilink">S. Rajeswara Rao</a> and by M. D. Parthasarathy, with lyrics by <a href="Papanasam_Sivan" title="wikilink">Papanasam Sivan</a> and <a href="Kothamangalam_Subbu" title="wikilink">Kothamangalam Subbu</a>.</p>
<p>After a massive publicity campaign, <em>Chandralekha</em> was released on 9 April 1948 to generally positive reviews, but was unable to recover its production costs. As a result, Vasan released the film in Hindi with some changes later the same year, and <em>Chandralekha</em> soon became a major box office success, as well as India's first nationwide hit. <a href="Cinema_of_South_India" title="wikilink">South Indian cinema</a> gained prominence throughout the country with the film's release. The film inspired South Indian film producers to market their Hindi films in North India. It was dubbed in English, Japanese, Danish and other foreign languages and was screened at Indian and international film festivals.</p>

</dl>
<p>Veerasimhan (<a href="M._K._Radha" title="wikilink">M. K. Radha</a>) and Sasankan (<a href="Ranjan_(actor)" title="wikilink">Ranjan</a>) are the sons of the king. While passing through a village on his horse, Veerasimhan meets a village dancer named Chandralekha (<a href="T._R._Rajakumari" title="wikilink">T. R. Rajakumari</a>) and they fall in love. At the palace, the king decides to <a href="abdication" title="wikilink">abdicate</a> in favour of Veerasimhan. This enrages the younger brother Sasankan; he forms a gang of thieves who embark on a crime spree. Chandralekha's father is injured in the ensuing chaos and dies soon after. Chandralekha, now orphaned, joins a band of travelling musicians, whose caravan is raided by Sasankan's men.</p>
<p>Sasankan orders Chandralekha to dance for him, which she does after being flogged. She later escapes. Later, Sasankan ambushes Veerasimhan and takes him prisoner. Chandralekha watches Sasankan's men trapping Veerasimhan in a cave and sealing its entrance with a boulder. She rescues him with the help of elephants from a passing circus troupe. Veerasimhan and Chandralekha join the circus to hide themselves from Sasankan's men. After returning to the palace, Sasankan imprisons his parents and declares himself king. He immediately sends a spy to find Chandralekha.</p>
<p>The spy sees Chandralekha performing at the circus; he tries to capture her but Veerasimhan saves her and they both escape and join a <a href="Banjara" title="wikilink">gypsy group</a>. When Veerasimhan leaves to seek help, Sasankan's men capture Chandralekha and take her to the palace. Sasankan tries to woo Chandralekha but she pretends to faint every time he approaches her. One of Chandralekha's friends from the circus comes to Sasankan disguised as a gypsy healer, claiming that she can cure Chandralekha of her &quot;illness&quot;. Behind locked doors, the two girls secretly talk. Sasankan is pleased to find Chandralekha miraculously cured and apparently ready to accept him as a bridegroom. In return, he agrees to Chandralekha's request for a drum dance to celebrate the royal wedding.</p>
<p>Huge drums are arranged in rows in front of the palace. Chandralekha joins the dancers, who dance on the drums. Sasankan is impressed with Chandralekha's performance but, unknown to him, Veerasimhan's soldiers are hiding inside the drums. As the dance ends, they rush out of the drums and attack Sasankan's men. Veerasimhan confronts Sasankan, and they have a long sword fight, which ends with Sasankan's defeat and imprisonment. Veerasimhan releases his parents and becomes the new king, while Chandralekha becomes his queen.</p>

<p>Producer <a href="S._S._Vasan" title="wikilink">S. S. Vasan</a> contemplated a story for his third film to follow <em><a href="Mangamma_Sapatham_(1943_film)" title="wikilink">Mangamma Sapatham</a></em> (1943) and <em><a href="Bala_Nagamma" title="wikilink">Bala Nagamma</a></em> (1942), which netted profits of . He wanted a film on a grand scale with no budgetary constraints. He asked <a href="Gemini_Studios" title="wikilink">Gemini Studios</a>' story department (consisting of K. J. Mahadevan, <a href="Kothamangalam_Subbu" title="wikilink">Kothamangalam Subbu</a>, Sangu, Naina and Veppathur Kittoo) to write a screenplay. They saw <em>Mangamma Sapatham</em> and <em>Bala Nagamma</em> as &quot;heroine-oriented stories&quot;, and suggested a similar story to Vasan. They told the story of Chandralekha, a tough woman who &quot;outwits a vicious bandit, delivers the final insult by slashing off his nose and, as a finishing touch, fills the bloodied gaping hole with hot, red chilli powder&quot;. Vasan disliked their story's gruesomeness and vulgarity, and rejected it but kept the character's name, Chandralekha.</p>
<p>Without waiting for the full story, Vasan announced that his next project would be titled <em>Chandralekha</em>, and he publicised it heavily in most major publications. Despite much work by Gemini's writers, the story was still not ready three months later. Vasan grew impatient and told the writers he would be shelving <em>Chandralekha</em> in favour of developing <em><a href="Avvaiyyar" class="uri" title="wikilink">Avvaiyyar</a></em>. After allowing the writers a final week, Kittoo discovered <a href="George_W._M._Reynolds" title="wikilink">George W. M. Reynolds</a>' novel <em>Robert Macaire: or, The French bandit in England</em> (1848). In the first chapter he read:</p>

<p>Vasan was impressed when Kittoo narrated a story based on this episode. He decided to continue with the film, naming the heroine Chandralekha. Although the story was still incomplete,<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> the rest of Gemini's story department later improvised Kittoo's ideas to give the story its final form.</p>

<p>The script had two major roles; both princes of a kingdomthe elder of whom was the hero and his brother the villain. M. K. Radha was offered the part of Sasankan, the younger prince. As he was then known for playing heroic roles, he was unwilling to play a negative role, and instead agreed to play the older prince Veerasimhan. Radha's wife had persuaded Vasan to cast Radha for the part. K. J. Mahadevan, who joined Gemini as a <a href="Production_equipment_control" title="wikilink">production controller</a>, was chosen to play Sasankan,<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> while T. G. Raghavachari agreed to direct the film.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> Some footage featuring Mahadevan was shot, but his performance was deemed &quot;too soft&quot; and he was dismissed from the part. He continued to serve as a scriptwriter and an assistant director.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> When Raghavachari suggested Ranjan for Sasankan, Vasan was reluctant, feeling he was too <a href="effeminacy" title="wikilink">effeminate</a> to play a &quot;steel-hard villain&quot;, but eventually agreed. By then, Ranjan was already committed to B. N. Rao's <em><a href="Saalivaahanan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Saalivaahanan</a></em> (1945), but Kittoo persuaded him to take a <a href="screen_test" title="wikilink">screen test</a> for <em>Chandralekha</em> and Rao gave Ranjan a few days off. The test was successful and Ranjan was officially cast.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>T. R. Rajakumari was chosen to play Chandralekha,<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> replacing Vasan's first choice K. L. V. Vasantha.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> Film historian <a href="Randor_Guy" title="wikilink">Randor Guy</a> believes Vasan chose Rajakumari over Vasantha because she was then leaving Gemini Studios permanently for <a href="Modern_Theatres" title="wikilink">Modern Theatres</a> in <a href="Salem_(India)" title="wikilink">Salem</a>.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> In April 1947, N. S. Krishnan was released from prison; Vasan recruited him and T. A. Madhuram to play the circus artists who help Veerasimhan rescue Chandralekha from Sasankan.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> The script was rewritten; new scenes were added to showcase the comedy duo.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> Actors Madurai Sriramulu Naidu and <a href="S._N._Lakshmi" title="wikilink">S.

<p>When a minor role of the hero's bodyguard was yet to be cast, the then struggling stage actor Villupuram Chinniah Pillai Ganeshamurthywho later became known as <a href="Sivaji_Ganesan" title="wikilink">Sivaji Ganesan</a>was interested; he grew his hair long for the role. Ganeshamurthy had contacted Kittoo several times asking for a role in the film. Eventually, Kittoo took Ganeshamurthy to Vasan, who had seen him perform on-stage. To Ganeshamurthy's dismay, Vasan rejected him, calling him &quot;totally unsuited for films&quot; and told him to choose another profession. This incident caused a permanent schism between Vasan and Ganeshamurthy.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> The role of the bodyguard was eventually given to N. Seetharaman, who later became known as <a href="Javar_Seetharaman" title="wikilink">Javar Seetharaman</a>.</p>
<p>Kothamangalam Subbu's wife M. S. Sundari Bai plays a circus performer who helps Chandralekha escape from Sasankan. T. A. Jayalakshmi, in one of her earliest film roles, appears briefly in one scene that lasted for a few minutes, as a dancer.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> L. Narayana Rao plays the circus manager. T. E. Krishnamachari plays the king and V. N. Janaki plays a gypsy dancer who gives Chandralekha and Veerasimhan shelter in the forest.

<h3 id="filming">Filming</h3>

<p><em>Chandralekha</em> began shooting in 1943.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> More than half of the film was directed by Raghavachari, but due to differences of opinion that arose between him and Vasan over the shooting of some scenes at the Governor's Estate (now <a href="Raj_Bhavan_(Chennai)" title="wikilink">Raj Bhavan, Guindy</a>), Raghavachari left the project and Vasan took over directing, making his directorial debut.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>
<p>Originally, the film did not include any circus scenes. Vasan decided to include them when the film was halfway through production, and the screenplay was altered.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> Kittoo travelled throughout South India and Ceylon (now <a href="Sri_Lanka" title="wikilink">Sri Lanka</a>) to see over 50 circuses<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> before choosing the Kamala Circus Company and Parasuram Lion Circus;<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> Vasan employed Kamala for a month. The circus scenes were shot by K. Ramnoth.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a><a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> In retrospect, Kittoo said about Ramnoth's work, &quot;In those days, we had no zoom lenses and yet Ramnoth did it. One night, while Chandralekha is performing on the flying trapeze, she notices the villain's henchman in the front row. She is on her perch high up and he is seated in a ringside chair. Shock hits her and to convey the shock the camera zooms fast from her to the man. Today, with a fast zoom shot it can be done very easily, but there was no such lens forty years ago. Ramnoth did it using the crane. He planned it well and rehearsed the shot for long. He took the shot 20 times and selected the best 'take'.&quot; The circus scenes lasted for 20 minutes; according to <a href="G._Dhananjayan" title="wikilink">G. Dhananjayan</a> these are &quot;the longest footage of scenes outside the main plot that one can see&quot;.</p>
<p>After Raghavachari's departure, one sequence he directedthe drum-dance sceneremained in the film.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a><a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> The scene involved 400 dancers and six months of daily rehearsals. It was designed by the chief art director A. K. Sekhar,<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> choreographed by Jayashankar<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> and was shot with four cameras by Ellapa, C. V. Ramakrishnan, S. Maruthi Rao and mainly Kamal Ghosh.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> The drum dance alone cost  (about US$105,000 in 1948), equal to the complete budget for a typical Indian film of the time.</p>
<p>During <a href="post-production" class="uri" title="wikilink">post-production</a>, Vasan asked Ramnoth his opinion of the scene in which hundreds of Veerasimhan's warriors storm the palace to rescue Chandralekha from Sasankan. Although everyone else praised the scene's photography, shots and action, Ramnoth remained quiet, finally saying that the suspense could be ruined if the scene was shown uncut, which sparked a discussion. Vasan advised the <a href="film_editing" title="wikilink">editor</a> Chandru to edit according to Ramnoth, and he was impressed with the result.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> C. E. Biggs worked as the <a href="sound_engineer" title="wikilink">sound engineer</a>.</p>
<p><em>Chandralekha</em> was in production for five years (from 1943 to 1948); it went through numerous changes to its story, cast, and filming. This caused substantial time and <a href="cost_overrun" title="wikilink">cost overruns</a>; the film ultimately cost 3 million (about US$600,000 in 1948), and became the most expensive Indian film at that time.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> Vasan had mortgaged all of his property, received financial assistance from <a href="K._Srinivasan" title="wikilink">Sreenivasa Iyengar</a>then the editor of <em><a href="The_Hindu" title="wikilink">The Hindu</a></em>and sold his jewellery to complete the film.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> Adjusted for inflation, the film would have cost  in 2010.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> According to film historian <a href="S._Muthiah" title="wikilink">S. Muthiah</a>, <em>Chandralekha</em>, considering the free-floating exchange rate at that time, became the first film with a budget of more than a million dollars to be made outside of the United States.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="themes-and-influences">Themes and influences</h2>
<p>Although a period film, <em>Chandralekha</em> is not based on historical fact; instead its plot is based on the first chapter of the novel <em>Robert Macaire: or, The French bandit in England</em>. Sasankan is based on the fictional bandit <a href="Robert_Macaire" title="wikilink">Robert Macaire</a>, and Chandralekha is based on a female dancer in the novel who Macaire flogs when she refuses to dance. The film enacts the incident from the novel.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> According to film historian B. D. Garga, the film also shows influences from other Western literary and cinematic sources, including the novel <em><a href="Sangre_y_arena" title="wikilink">Blood and Sand</a></em> (1908), and the films <em><a href="The_Mark_of_Zorro_(1920_film)" title="wikilink">The Mark of Zorro</a></em> (1920), <em><a href="Robin_Hood_(1922_film)" title="wikilink">Robin Hood</a></em> (1922), <em><a href="The_Thief_of_Bagdad_(1924_film)" title="wikilink">The Thief of Baghdad</a></em> (1924) and <em><a href="Ben-Hur_(1925_film)" title="wikilink">Ben-Hur</a></em> (1925). In December 1964, <a href="Jerzy_Toeplitz" title="wikilink">Jerzy Toeplitz</a> called <em>Chandralekha</em> an &quot;extension and development&quot; of the mythology genre. Toeplitz said, &quot;The characters are mortals but behave like heavenly beings, and their movements and gestures, like those of the gods and heroes of the <em><a href="Mahabharata" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mahabharata</a></em> are impregnated with the miraculous&quot;. He called the story a &quot;mere pretext to hold together the different episodes, each of which builds up like a circus turn: the tension mounts to a culminating point, whereupon the next episode immediately takes over&quot;.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> According to the book <em>Third World Film Making and the West</em> (1987) by Roy Armes, <a href="Uday_Shankar" title="wikilink">Uday Shankar</a>'s <em><a href="Kalpana_(1948_film)" title="wikilink">Kalpana</a></em> (1948), which was also shot at Gemini Studios, inspired Vasan to make <em>Chandralekha</em>. In the 2003 book <em>Encyclopaedia of Hindi Cinema</em>, <em>Chandralekha</em> is defined as a &quot;<a href="Ruritanian_romance" title="wikilink">Ruritanian</a> period extravaganza&quot;.</p>
<p>The climactic sword fight between Veerasimhan and Sasankan has often been compared to that in the 1894 novel <em><a href="The_Prisoner_of_Zenda" title="wikilink">The Prisoner of Zenda</a></em>. In 1976, American film historian <a href="William_K._Everson" title="wikilink">William K. Everson</a> compared the comedians in <em>Chandralekha</em> to the comedy duo <a href="Laurel_and_Hardy" title="wikilink">Laurel and Hardy</a>.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> Although G. Dhananjayan and Randor Guy consider the film's drum dance scene as the first of its kind in Indian cinema, the 1947 film <em><a href="Naam_Iruvar" title="wikilink">Naam Iruvar</a></em> includes a scene in which the lead actress' younger sister dances on drums to the Tamil poet <a href="Subramania_Bharati" title="wikilink">Subramania Bharati</a>'s song &quot;Kottu Murase&quot;;<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> French film historian Yves Thoraval said this &quot;prefigured the dance that <em>Chandralekha</em> made famous the very next year&quot;. According to American film critic <a href="Jonathan_Rosenbaum" title="wikilink">Jonathan Rosenbaum</a>, <em>Chandralekha</em> &quot;belongs to the same childhood continuum&quot; as <a href="Fritz_Lang" title="wikilink">Fritz Lang</a>'s 1959 films <em><a href="The_Tiger_of_Eschnapur_(1959_film)" title="wikilink">The Tiger of Eschnapur</a></em> and <em><a href="The_Indian_Tomb_(1959_film)" title="wikilink">The Indian Tomb</a></em> which were set in India.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> In his 2009 book '' 50 Indian Film Classics'', film critic M. K. Raghavendra states that <em>Chandralekha</em> is constructed in a manner that &quot;enables its narrative to incorporate elements drawn from virtually any kind of genre&quot;. According to Guy, the settings of the song &quot;Naattiya Kuthirai&quot; picturised on Sundari Bai's character, including the dance and the costume worn by Sundari Bai, are inspired by those seen in the 1943 musical film <em><a href="Coney_Island_(1943_film)" title="wikilink">Coney Island</a></em>.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a></p>

<p>The song &quot;Naattiya Kuthirai&quot; was not originally part of the script; it was added during the final stages of the film's production. Sundari Bai spent over a month rehearsing the song.<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> The songs &quot;Indrae Enathu Kuthukalam&quot; and &quot;Manamohana Saaranae&quot; were sung by T.

She was initially hesitant, feeling that &quot;these were beyond her capabilities&quot;, but she was supported by Rajeswara Rao who &quot;worked hard on her&quot;.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a> The music of <em>Chandralekha</em> helped it to become one of the most successful Indian musical films of the 1940s; it &quot;created an atmosphere for a number of music directors influenced by Western music&quot; in Tamil cinema.<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a></p>

Writing for <em><a href="Screen_(magazine)" title="wikilink">Screen</a></em> in April 1998, film historian M.

<p>The first advertisement for <em>Chandralekha</em> appeared on the back cover of the songbook for the film <em><a href="Dasi_Aparanji" title="wikilink">Dasi Aparanji</a></em> (1944). It featured Vasantha as the heroine, before she was replaced by Rajakumari.<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a> With <em>Chandralekha</em>, Gemini became the first Tamil studio to attempt to distribute a film throughout India.<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a> According to film scholar P.

Dhananjayan's book <em>The Best of Tamil Cinema</em> (2011) contradicts this, saying that Vasan spent close to 500,000 on publicity alone. <em>Chandralekha</em>'s publicity campaign was the most expensive for an Indian film at that time; the entire publicity budget of a typical Indian film a decade earlier was around 25,000. In the 1950s, the entire publicity for a &quot;top Indian film&quot; cost no more than 100,000, which is substantially less than the amount spent on <em>Chandralekha</em>.<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a> According to Guy, the publicity campaign &quot;made the nation sit up and take notice&quot;.</p>
<p>A. K. Shekhar designed the publicity material, which included posters, booklets and full-page newspaper advertisements. Gemini Studios, inspired by American cinema, also produced a publicity brochure for distribution to exhibitors and the press. It contained a synopsis of the film and a step pictorial account of the key points of the narrative. It provided text for use by local theatres. The booklet also had layouts for women's pages and a pictorial account of suggested marketing activities, such as &quot;How to drape an Indian sari: Theatre demonstrations have a big draw&quot;, and information about the film's costumeswhich were hand-woven garments of silk and gold; one gold-embroidered riding jacket is considered &quot;the most expensive piece of outfitting ever used in a motion picture&quot;.</p>

<p><em>Chandralekha</em> was released on 9 April 1948.<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a> It was released simultaneously in 40 theatres throughout South India and in another 10 within a week. In the 1940s, a typical Tamil film would be released in about 10 towns, but <em>Chandralekha</em> was released simultaneously in 120 towns.<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a></p>
<p><em>Chandralekha</em> was released in Japan as <em>Shakunetsu-no ketto</em> (&quot;Fight Under the Red Heat&quot;) in April 1954, where it was distributed by Nippon Cinema Corporation (NCC).<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a> It was the first Tamil film to be dubbed in Japanese,<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a> and the second Indian film to be released in Japanthe first was the 1952 <a href="Bollywood" title="wikilink">Hindi</a> film <em><a href="Aan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Aan</a></em>, which was released in Tokyo in January 1954. NCC later collapsed; no information about how <em>Chandralekha</em> came to be released in Japan survives. During the 1950s, when India was short of foreign currency, barter was a common means of exchange with overseas business partners. Japanese scholar Tamaki Matsuoka believes this to have been the case with <em>Chandralekha</em>. The pamphlet prepared by NCC for the film calls Vasan the &quot;<a href="Cecil_B._DeMille" title="wikilink">Cecil B.

<p>The film was a <a href="bellwether" class="uri" title="wikilink">bellwether</a> for its filming, production costs and publicity before, during and after its release. Other producers delayed releasing their films until after <em>Chandralekha</em>{{'}}s release to avoid competition. The film's entertainment value made it popular with audiences; however, it was unable to recover its production costs, and Vasan remade it in Hindi in order to do so.<a href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a><a href="#fn67" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a> The Hindi version was released the same year with over 600 prints and became a large commercial success, setting box-office records. <em>Chandralekha</em> thus became the first production from Madras (now <a href="Chennai" class="uri" title="wikilink">Chennai</a>) and the first Indian film to become a hit throughout India.<a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a> Vasan called the film &quot;a pageant for our peasants&quot; meant for &quot;the war-weary public that had been forced to watch insipid war propaganda pictures for years&quot;.

<p>Although exact figures for the film's box office earnings are not available, film trade websites provide estimates of its takings. According to Sharmishtha Gooptu's 2010 book <em>Bengali Cinema: An Other Nation</em>, <em>Chandralekha</em> grossed 10 million (about US$2,100,000 in 1948) in India alone. <a href="Box_Office_India" title="wikilink">Box Office India</a> gives the Hindi version's nett gross as 7 million and states that it was the second-highest-grossing Bollywood film of 1948 after <em><a href="Shaheed_(1948_film)" title="wikilink">Shaheed</a></em>.<a href="#fn70" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a> It gives its adjusted nett gross as 37,98,00,000.<a href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a> Film historian B.

<p><img src="Chandralekha_drum_dance_scene.jpg" title="fig:The drum dance scene is often considered the highlight of the film by critics." alt="The drum dance scene is often considered the highlight of the film by critics." width="250" /> <em>Chandralekha</em> received generally positive reviews from Indian critics. On 9 April 1948, <em>The Hindu</em> said, &quot;India has not witnessed a film of this magnitude in terms of making and settings so far&quot;. On 10 April, <em><a href="The_Indian_Express" title="wikilink">The Indian Express</a></em> said, &quot;<em>Chandralekha</em> is an entertaining film for everyone with elements like animals, rope dance, circus and comedy&quot;. The same day, the Tamil newspaper <em><a href="Dinamani" class="uri" title="wikilink">Dinamani</a></em> said, &quot;<em>Chandralekha</em> is not only a first rate Tamil film but also an international film&quot;.</p>
<p><a href="V._A._K._Ranga_Rao" title="wikilink">V. A. K. Ranga Rao</a> described the film as &quot;the most complete entertainer ever made&quot;. In their 1988 book <em>One Hundred Indian Feature Films: An Annotated Filmography</em>, Anil Srivastava and Shampa Banerjee praised nearly every aspect of the film, including its grandeur, the battle scenes and the drum dance, which they called the &quot;<em>raison d'etre</em>&quot; of the film. In 2003, journalist S. Muthiah called it &quot;an epic extravaganza worthy of Cecil B. de. Mille&quot; that was &quot;larger-than-life&quot;.<a href="#fn73" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref73"><sup>73</sup></a> In their 2008 book <em>Global Bollywood: Travels of Hindi Song and Dance</em>, Sangita Gopal and Sujata Moorti said, &quot;<em>Chandralekha</em> is a film that translates the aesthetic of Hollywood <a href="Orientalism" class="uri" title="wikilink">Orientalism</a> for an indigenous mass audience&quot;, calling its drum-dance sequence &quot;perhaps one of the most spectacular sequences in Indian cinema&quot;. In his 2009 book <em>50 Indian Film Classics</em>, M. K. Raghavendra said, &quot;Indian films are rarely constructed in a way that makes undistracted viewing essential to their enjoyment and <em>Chandralekha</em> is arranged as a series of distractions&quot;. He concluded by saying, &quot;<em>Chandralekha</em> apparently shows us that enjoyment and visual pleasure in the Indian context are not synonymous with edge-of-the-seat excitement but must permit absent-mindedness as a viewing condition&quot;.</p>
<p>In May 2010, Raja Sen of <a href="Rediff.com" class="uri" title="wikilink">Rediff.com</a> praised the film's &quot;grandly mounted setpieces&quot;, its &quot;memorable drum dance&quot; and the &quot;longest swordfight ever captured on film&quot;, calling <em>Chandralekha</em> &quot;just the kind of film, in fact, that would be best appreciated now after digital restoration&quot;.<a href="#fn74" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref74"><sup>74</sup></a> In an October 2010 review of <em>Chandralekha</em>, Randor Guy praised Rajakumari's performance, calling it &quot;her career-best&quot; and saying that she &quot;carried the movie on her shoulders&quot;. Guy praised Radha as his &quot;usual impressive self&quot;, saying the film would be &quot;remembered for: the excellent onscreen narration, the magnificent sets and the immortal drum dance sequence&quot;.<a href="#fn75" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref75"><sup>75</sup></a> In his 2011 book <em>The Best of Tamil Cinema, 1931 to 2010: 1931&lt;U+2013&gt;1976</em>, G. Dhananjayan called the film &quot;a delight to watch even after 50 years&quot;, though he criticised the script. In 2013, director Dhanapal Padmanabhan told K. Jeshi of <em>The Hindu</em>, &quot;<em>Chandralekha</em> had grandeur that was at par with Hollywood standards&quot;.<a href="#fn76" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref76"><sup>76</sup></a></p>
<h4 id="overseas">Overseas</h4>
<p><em>Chandralekha</em> was well received by critics overseas. Reviewing the English version, <em><a href="The_New_York_Times" title="wikilink">The New York Times</a></em> described Rajakumari as a &quot;buxom beauty&quot;. When <em>Chandralekha</em> was screened in New York City in 1976, William K. Everson said, &quot;It's a colorful, naive and zestful film in which the overall ingenuousness quite disarms criticism of plot absurdity or such production shortcomings as the too-obvious studio &quot;exteriors&quot;. [...] Last but far from least, <a href="Busby_Berkeley" title="wikilink">Busby Berkeley</a> would surely have been delighted to see his influence extending to the climactic drum dance.&quot;<a href="#fn77" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref77"><sup>77</sup></a></p>
<p>Jonathan Rosenbaum said in August 1981, &quot;The prospect of a three-hour Indian film in  with no subtitles is a little off-putting, I would saywouldn't you?&quot; However, he had &quot;surprisingly little trouble following the plot and action&quot; of the film, and added, &quot;this made-in-Madras costume drama makes for a pretty action-packed 186 minutes.&quot;<a href="#fn78" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref78"><sup>78</sup></a> In June 2009, K.

<h2 id="hindi-version">Hindi version</h2>
<p>The Hindi version of <em>Chandralekha</em> was Vasan's first Bollywood project. For this version, Vasan re-shot some scenes and included a slightly different cast. Among the notable differences between the Hindi and Tamil versions of the film, Pandit Indra and <a href="Aghajani_Kashmeri" title="wikilink">Agha Jani Kashmiri</a> wrote the dialogue only for the Hindi version.<a href="#fn81" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref81"><sup>81</sup></a> Indra was a lyricist for the Hindi version with <a href="Bharat_Vyas" title="wikilink">Bharat Vyas</a>, while Subbu and Papanasam Sivan were lyricists for the Tamil version.<a href="#fn82" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref82"><sup>82</sup></a> Rajeswara Rao, who composed the soundtrack for both versions, was assisted by Bal Krishna Kalla on the Hindi version. Parthasarathy and Vaidyanathan composed background music for the Hindi version without Das Gupta.<a href="#fn83" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref83"><sup>83</sup></a></p>
<p>Rajakumari, Radha and Ranjan reprised their roles in the Hindi version, but their charactersexcept for Rajakumari's character Chandralekhawere renamed.

S. Krishnan, T. A. Madhuram, T. E. Krishnamachari, Pottai Krishnamoorthy and N. Seetharaman appeared only in the Tamil version, whereas Yashodhara Katju and H. K.

<p>With the success of <em>Chandralekha</em>, Vasan became known as one of the best directors in Indian cinema.<a href="#fn87" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref87"><sup>87</sup></a> Randor Guy later called Vasan the &quot;Cecil B.

The film demonstrated that if a film was entertaining, it would be commercially successful. The success of the Hindi version gave opportunities to South Indian film producers to market their Hindi films in North India. The publicity campaign for <em>Chandralekha</em> created such an impact that film producers in Bombay (now <a href="Mumbai" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mumbai</a>) passed a resolution that there should be a limit imposed on advertisements for any film in periodicals. Vasan's <em><a href="Apoorva_Sagodharargal_(1949_film)" title="wikilink">Apoorva Sagodharargal</a></em> (1949) is often considered an unofficial sequel to <em>Chandralekha</em>; it was also a major commercial success.<a href="#fn92" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref92"><sup>92</sup></a></p>
<p><em>Chandralekha</em> enhanced Rajakumari's and Ranjan's careers; both became popular throughout India after the film's release.<a href="#fn93" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref93"><sup>93</sup></a> Its climactic sword-fight scene was well received,<a href="#fn94" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref94"><sup>94</sup></a> and is thought to be the longest sword fight in Indian cinema.
