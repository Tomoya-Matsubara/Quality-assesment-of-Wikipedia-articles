<p><img src="Mthomebrew_must.JPG" title="fig:Fermenting must." alt="Fermenting must." width="350" /> The process of <strong><a href="Fermentation" class="uri" title="wikilink">Fermentation</a> in <a href="wine" class="uri" title="wikilink">wine</a></strong> is the catalyst function that turns <a href="grape_juice" title="wikilink">grape juice</a> into an <a href="alcoholic_beverage" title="wikilink">alcoholic beverage</a>. During fermentation <a href="yeast" class="uri" title="wikilink">yeast</a> interact with <a href="sugar" title="wikilink">sugars</a> in the juice to create <a href="ethanol" class="uri" title="wikilink">ethanol</a> and <a href="carbon_dioxide" title="wikilink">carbon dioxide</a> (as a <a href="by-product" class="uri" title="wikilink">by-product</a>). In <a href="winemaking" class="uri" title="wikilink">winemaking</a> the <a href="temperature" class="uri" title="wikilink">temperature</a> and speed of fermentation is an important consideration as well as the levels of <a href="oxygen" class="uri" title="wikilink">oxygen</a> present in the <a href="must" class="uri" title="wikilink">must</a> at the start of the fermentation. The risk of <a href="stuck_fermentation" title="wikilink">stuck fermentation</a> and the development of several <a href="wine_fault" title="wikilink">wine faults</a> can also occur during this stage which can last anywhere from 5 to 14 days for <em>primary fermentation</em> and potentially another 5 to 10 days for a <em>secondary fermentation</em>. Fermentation may be done in stainless steel tanks, which is common with many white wines like <a href="Riesling" class="uri" title="wikilink">Riesling</a>, in an open wooden vat, inside a <a href="wine_barrel" title="wikilink">wine barrel</a> and inside the <a href="wine_bottle" title="wikilink">wine bottle</a> itself like in <a href="Sparkling_wine_production" title="wikilink">the production</a> of many <a href="sparkling_wine" title="wikilink">sparkling wines</a>.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> <a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="history">History</h2>

<p>While there may never be evidence to pinpoint the moment when fermentation was first observed-the natural occurrence of fermentation, with little need for human interaction, makes it likely that fermentation was observed quite early in human history.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> The earliest uses of the word &quot;Fermentation&quot; in relation to winemaking was in reference to the appearance &quot;boiling&quot; within the must that came from the <a href="anaerobic_respiration" title="wikilink">anaerobic reaction</a> of the yeast to the sugars in the grape juice and the release of carbon dioxide. The <a href="Latin" class="uri" title="wikilink">Latin</a> <em>fervere</em> means, literrally, <em>to boil</em>. In the mid-<a href="19th_century" title="wikilink">19th century</a>, <a href="Louis_Pasteur" title="wikilink">Louis Pasteur</a> noted the connection between yeast and the process of the fermentation in which the yeast act as catalyst and mediator through a series of a reaction that convert sugar into alcohol. The discovery of the <a href="Glycolysis" title="wikilink">Embden&lt;U+2013&gt;Meyerhof&lt;U+2013&gt;Parnas</a> pathway by <a href="Gustav_Embden" title="wikilink">Gustav Embden</a>, <a href="Otto_Fritz_Meyerhof" title="wikilink">Otto Fritz Meyerhof</a> and <a href="Jakub_Karol_Parnas" title="wikilink">Jakub Karol Parnas</a> in the early 20th century contributed more to the understanding of the complex chemical processes involved the conversion of sugar to alcohol.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="process">Process</h2>

<p><img src="Yeast_on_grapes.jpg" title="fig:Ambient yeast present as a dusting on the grapes or as a &quot;blush&quot;." alt="Ambient yeast present as a dusting on the grapes or as a &quot;blush&quot;." /> In winemaking there is distinctions made between <em>ambient yeast</em>s which are naturally present in wine cellars, vineyards and on the grapes themselves (sometimes known as a grape's &quot;blush&quot;) and <em>cultured yeast</em> which are specifically isolated and inoculated for use in winemaking. The most common <a href="genus" class="uri" title="wikilink">genus</a> of wild yeasts found in winemaking include <em><a href="Candida_(genus)" title="wikilink">Candida</a>, <a href="Kl&lt;U+00F6&gt;ckera/Hanseniaspora" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kl&lt;U+00F6&gt;ckera/Hanseniaspora</a>, <a href="Metschnikowiaceae" class="uri" title="wikilink">Metschnikowiaceae</a>, <a href="Pichia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Pichia</a></em> and <em><a href="Zygosaccharomyces" class="uri" title="wikilink">Zygosaccharomyces</a></em>. Wild yeasts are typically unpredictable and unstable and could introduce less desirable traits to the wine and even contribute to spoilage. While many traditional wine makers, particularly in Europe, advocate for the use of ambient as a characteristic of the region's <em><a href="terroir" class="uri" title="wikilink">terroir</a></em> many winemakers prefer to use cultured yeast that are much more predictable and controlled during fermentation. The cultured yeasts most commonly used in winemaking belong the <em><a href="Saccharomyces_cerevisiae" title="wikilink">Saccharomyces cerevisiae</a></em> (also known as &quot;sugar yeast&quot;) species. Within this species are several hundred different <a href="strain_(biology)" title="wikilink">strains</a> of yeast that be used during fermentation to affect the heat or vigor of the process and enhance or suppress certain flavor characteristics of the <a href="varietal" class="uri" title="wikilink">varietal</a>. The use of different strains of yeasts are a major contributor to the diversity of wine, even among the same grape variety.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>The addition of cultured yeast normally occurs with the yeast first in a dried or &quot;inactive&quot; state and needing to be reactivated in warm water or diluted grape juice prior to being added to the must. In order to thrive and be active in fermentation the yeast needs access to a continuous supply of <a href="carbon" class="uri" title="wikilink">carbon</a>, <a href="nitrogen" class="uri" title="wikilink">nitrogen</a>, <a href="sulfur" class="uri" title="wikilink">sulfur</a>, <a href="phosphorous" class="uri" title="wikilink">phosphorous</a> as well as access to various <a href="vitamins" class="uri" title="wikilink">vitamins</a> and <a href="Dietary_mineral" title="wikilink">minerals</a>. These components are naturally present in the grape must but their amount may be corrected by adding nutrient packets to the wine, in order to foster a more encouraging environment for the yeast. <a href="Oxygen" class="uri" title="wikilink">Oxygen</a> is needed as well but in winemaking the risk of <a href="oxidation" class="uri" title="wikilink">oxidation</a> and the lack of alcohol production from oxygenated yeast requires the exposure of oxygen to be kept at a minimum.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> <img src="Yeast_and_nutrients.JPG" title="fig:Dry winemaking yeast (left) and yeast nutrients used in the rehydration process to stimulate yeast cells." alt="Dry winemaking yeast (left) and yeast nutrients used in the rehydration process to stimulate yeast cells." /> Upon the introduction of active yeasts to the grape must, <a href="phosphate" title="wikilink">phosphates</a> are attached to the sugar and the six-carbon sugar <a href="molecule" title="wikilink">molecules</a> begin to be split into three-carbon pieces and go through a series of <a href="rearrangement_reaction" title="wikilink">rearrangement reactions</a>. During this process the <a href="carboxylic" class="uri" title="wikilink">carboxylic</a> carbon atom is released in the form of carbon dioxide with the remaining components becoming <a href="acetaldehyde" class="uri" title="wikilink">acetaldehyde</a>. The absence of oxygen in this <a href="anaerobic" class="uri" title="wikilink">anaerobic</a> process allows the acetaldehyde to be eventually converted to <a href="ethanol" class="uri" title="wikilink">ethanol</a> alcohol. During the conversion of acetaldehyde a small amount is converted in <a href="acetic_acid" title="wikilink">acetic acid</a> which, in excess, can contribute to the wine fault known as <a href="Volatile_acidity#Acetic_acid" title="wikilink">Volatile acidity</a>. After the yeast has exhausted its life cycle they fall to the bottom of the fermentation tank as sediment known as <a href="Lees_(fermentation)" title="wikilink">lees</a>.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>

This compounds can be considered &quot;<a href="Volatile_organic_compound" title="wikilink">Volatile</a>&quot; like <a href="aldehyde" title="wikilink">aldehydes</a>, <a href="ethyl_acetate" title="wikilink">ethyl acetate</a>, <a href="ester" class="uri" title="wikilink">ester</a>, <a href="fatty_acid" title="wikilink">fatty acids</a>, <a href="fusel_oils" title="wikilink">fusel oils</a>, <a href="hydrogen_sulfide" title="wikilink">hydrogen sulfide</a>, <a href="ketone" title="wikilink">ketones</a> and <a href="mercaptans" class="uri" title="wikilink">mercaptans</a>) or &quot;Non-volatile&quot; like <a href="glycerol" class="uri" title="wikilink">glycerol</a>, acetic acid and <a href="succinic_acid" title="wikilink">succinic acid</a>.

<h2 id="winemaking-considerations">Winemaking considerations</h2>
<p><img src="Fermenting.jpg" title="fig:Carbon dioxide is visible during the fermentation process in the form of bubbles in the must." alt="Carbon dioxide is visible during the fermentation process in the form of bubbles in the must." /> During fermentation there are several factors that winemakers take into consideration during the process. The most notable is that of the internal temperature of the must. The biochemical process of fermentation itself creates a lot of residual <a href="heat" class="uri" title="wikilink">heat</a> which can take the must out of the ideal temperature range for the wine. Typically white wine is fermented between 64-68 <a href="Fahrenheit" title="wikilink">&lt;U+00B0&gt;F</a> (18-20 <a href="Celsius" title="wikilink">&lt;U+00B0&gt;C</a>) though a wine maker may choose to use a higher temperature to bring out some of the complexity of the wine. Red wine is typically fermented at higher temperatures up to 85<a href="Fahrenheit" title="wikilink">&lt;U+00B0&gt;F</a> (29&lt;U+00B0&gt;C). Fermentation at higher temperatures may have adverse effect on the wine in stunning the yeast to inactivity and even &quot;boiling off&quot; some of the flavors of the wines. Some winemakers may ferment their red wines at cooler temperatures more typical of white wines in order to bring out more fruit flavors.</p>
<p>To control the heat generated during fermentation the winemaker has to choose a suitable vessel size or to use cooling devices of various sorts from the ancient <a href="Bordeaux_wine" title="wikilink">Bordeaux</a> traditions of placing the fermentation vat on top of blocks of ice to todays modern use of sophisticated fermentation tanks with built in cooling rings.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<p>A risk factor involved with fermentation is the development of chemical residue and spoilage which can be corrected with the addition of <a href="sulfur_dioxide" title="wikilink">sulfur dioxide</a> (SO<sub>2</sub>), although excess SO<sub>2</sub> can lead to a wine fault. A winemaker who wishes to make a wine with high levels of <a href="residual_sugar" title="wikilink">residual sugar</a> (like a <a href="dessert_wine" title="wikilink">dessert wine</a>) may stop fermentation early either by dropping the temperature of the must to stun the yeast or by adding a high level of alcohol (like <a href="brandy" class="uri" title="wikilink">brandy</a>) to the must to kill off the yeast and create a <a href="fortified_wine" title="wikilink">fortified wine</a>.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="other-types-of-fermentation">Other types of fermentation</h2>
<p>In winemaking there are different processes that fall under the title of &quot;Fermentation&quot; but might not follow the same procedure commonly associated with wine fermentation.</p>
<h3 id="bottle-fermentation">Bottle fermentation</h3>
<p>Bottle fermentation is a method of <a href="sparkling_wine_production" title="wikilink">sparkling wine production</a> originating in the <a href="Champagne_(wine_region)" title="wikilink">Champagne</a> region where after the <a href="cuvee" class="uri" title="wikilink">cuvee</a> has gone through a primary yeast fermentation the wine is then bottled and goes through a secondary fermentation where sugar and additional yeast known as <em>liqueur de tirage</em> is added to the wine. This secondary fermentation is what creates the carbon dioxide bubbles that sparkling wine is known for.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="carbonic-maceration">Carbonic maceration</h3>
<p>The process of <a href="Carbonic_maceration" title="wikilink">Carbonic maceration</a> is also known as <strong>whole cluster fermentation</strong> where instead of yeast being added to grape must fermentation is encouraged to take place inside the individual grape berries. This method is common in the creation of <a href="Beaujolais" class="uri" title="wikilink">Beaujolais</a> wine and involves whole clusters of grapes being stored in a closed container with the oxygen in the container being replaced with carbon dioxide. The wild ambient yeasts naturally present on the grape skins start the fermentation process and, with the pressure of the carbon dioxide gas, pass into the grape berry and cause this form of internal fermentation. The resulting wines are typically soft and fruity.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="malolactic-fermentation">Malolactic fermentation</h3>
<p>Instead of yeast, <a href="bacteria" class="uri" title="wikilink">bacteria</a> plays a fundamental role in <a href="Malolactic_fermentation" title="wikilink">Malolactic fermentation</a> which is essentially the conversion of <a href="Malic_acid" title="wikilink">Malic acid</a> into <a href="lactic_acid" title="wikilink">lactic acid</a>. This has the benefit of reducing some of the tartness and making the resulting wine taste softer. Depending on the style of wine that the winemaker is trying to produce, malolactic fermentation may take place at the same time as the yeast fermentation.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
