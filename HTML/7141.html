<p>Gaga's influence on modern culture and society has provoked the <a href="University_of_South_Carolina" title="wikilink">University of South Carolina</a> into offering a full-time course titled &quot;Lady Gaga and the Sociology of Fame&quot;<a href="#fn176" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref176"><sup>176</sup></a> in the objective of unravelling &quot;the sociologically relevant dimensions of the fame of Lady Gaga with respect to her music, videos, fashion, and other artistic endeavors&quot;.<a href="#fn177" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref177"><sup>177</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="criticism">Criticism</h3>
<p>Gaga's treatment of her fans as &quot;Little Monsters&quot; has inspired criticism, due to the highly commercial nature of her music and image.<a href="#fn178" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref178"><sup>178</sup></a> To some, this dichotomy contravenes the concept of outsider culture. Writing for <em>The Guardian</em>, <a href="Kitty_Empire" title="wikilink">Kitty Empire</a> opined that the dichotomy &quot;...allows the viewer to have a 'transgressive' experience without being required to think. At [her performance's] core, though, is the idea that Gaga is at one with the freaks and outcasts. The Monster Ball is where we can all be free. This is arrant nonsense, as the scads of people buying Gaga's cunningly commercial music are not limited to the niche worlds of <a href="drag_queen" title="wikilink">drag queens</a> and hip night creatures from which she draws her inspiration. But Gaga seems sincere.&quot;<a href="#fn179" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref179"><sup>179</sup></a> <a href="Camille_Paglia" title="wikilink">Camille Paglia</a> wrote a cover story &quot;Lady Gaga and the death of sex&quot; on September 12, 2010, in <em><a href="The_Sunday_Times" title="wikilink">The Sunday Times</a></em><a href="#fn180" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref180"><sup>180</sup></a> in which she asserts that Gaga &quot;is more an identity thief than an erotic taboo breaker, a mainstream manufactured product who claims to be singing for the freaks, the rebellious and the dispossessed when she is none of those.&quot;<a href="#fn181" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref181"><sup>181</sup></a></p>

<p>Besides her career in music, Gaga has enhanced her repertoire as a philanthropist who has contributed to various charities and <a href="humanitarianism" class="uri" title="wikilink">humanitarianism</a> works.</p>
<p>Although declining an invitation to record <a href="We_Are_the_World_25_for_Haiti" title="wikilink">a benefit song</a>,<a href="#fn184" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref184"><sup>184</sup></a> Gaga held a concert of The Monster Ball Tour following the <a href="2010_Haiti_earthquake" title="wikilink">2010 Haiti earthquake</a> and dedicated it to the country&lt;U+2019&gt;s reconstruction relief fund. This concert, held at the <a href="Radio_City_Music_Hall" title="wikilink">Radio City Music Hall</a>, New York, on January 24, 2010, donated any received revenue to the relief fund while, in addition, all profits from sales of products on Gaga&lt;U+2019&gt;s official online store on that same day were donated. Gaga announced that an estimated total of <a href="United_States_dollar" title="wikilink">$</a>500,000 was collected for the fund.<a href="#fn185" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref185"><sup>185</sup></a></p>

Titled Viva Glam Gaga and Viva Glam Cyndi for each contributor respectively, all net proceeds of the lipstick line were donated to the cosmetic company&lt;U+2019&gt;s campaign to prevent HIV and AIDS worldwide.<a href="#fn186" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref186"><sup>186</sup></a> In a press release, Gaga declared, &quot;I don't want Viva Glam to be just a lipstick you buy to help a cause.
