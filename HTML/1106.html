<p><strong>Ley</strong> is a <a href="Moon" title="wikilink">lunar</a> <a href="impact_crater" title="wikilink">impact crater</a> that is located across the southern rim of the much larger walled plain <a href="Campbell_(lunar_crater)" title="wikilink">Campbell</a>. Intruding into the south-southwestern rim of Ley is the slightly larger crater <a href="Von_Neumann_(crater)" title="wikilink">Von Neumann</a>.</p>
<p>The debris from the formation of Von Neumann has produced a bulging rampart that occupies the southwest interior floor of Ley. The outer rim of Ley has undergone impact erosion, and is marked by a number of small craterlets. The inner wall is also worn, and the interior floor is pock-marked by a number of tiny craterlets. There is a small, cup-shaped crater on the floor to the northwest of the mid-point. {{-}}</p>
