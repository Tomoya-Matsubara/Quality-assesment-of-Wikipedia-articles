<p><a href="Joseph-Armand_Bombardier" title="wikilink">Joseph-Armand Bombardier</a> was a mechanic who dreamed of building a vehicle that could &quot;float on snow.&quot; In 1937, he designed and produced his first <a href="snowmobile" class="uri" title="wikilink">snowmobile</a> in his small repair shop in <a href="Valcourt_(city),_Quebec" title="wikilink">Valcourt, Quebec</a>.</p>
<p>Bombardier's technological breakthrough in the design of bush vehicles came in the mid-1930s when he developed a drive system that revolutionized travel in snow and swampy conditions. In 1937, Bombardier sold 12 snowmobiles&lt;U+2014&gt;named the B7 and, in 1942, created l'Auto-Neige Bombardier Limit&lt;U+00E9&gt;e company.</p>
<p>The first snowmobiles were large, multi-passenger vehicles designed to help people get around during the long winter months. Snowmobiles were used in rural Quebec to take children to school, carry freight, deliver mail, and as ambulances. His invention filled a very particular need in the region and soon business was booming. In 1941, Armand opened a large new factory in Valcourt. Then a major setback hit the growing business: the <a href="World_War_II" title="wikilink">Second World War</a> was well underway and the Canadian government issued wartime rationing regulations. Bombardier customers had to prove that snowmobiles were essential to their livelihood in order to buy one. To keep his business going, Armand switched gears and developed vehicles for the military. After the war, Bombardier experienced another setback in his snowmobile business. In 1948, the Quebec government passed a law requiring all highways and local roads to be cleared of snow; the Bombardier company's sales fell by nearly half in one year. Armand Bombardier therefore decided to diversify his business, first by producing tracked snowplows sized specifically for use on municipal sidewalks (replacing horse-drawn devices), then by making all-terrain vehicles for the mining, oil and forestry industries.</p>
<p>Of note, the machines had removable front skis that could be replaced with front wheels for use on paved or hard surfaces, thus providing greater utility to his large snowmobiles. Production of these machines evolved over time. During 1951, the wooden bodies were replaced with sheet steel and these vehicles were powered by <a href="Chrysler" class="uri" title="wikilink">Chrysler</a> flathead six-cylinder engines and 3-speed manual transmissions. In the 1960s, V-8 engines began to appear and during the 1969/70 production years, the standard round &quot;porthole&quot;-style windows were replaced with larger rectangular windows which allowed more interior light and made them feel less claustrophobic. Following these changes came the switchover to more reliable <a href="Chrysler" class="uri" title="wikilink">Chrysler</a> Industrial 318 engines with the automatic Loadflite transmissions. Production of these machines continued into the mid-1970s.</p>
<p>Bombardier dreamed of developing a fast, lightweight snowmobile that could carry one or two people. In the early 1950s, Armand set aside his dream to focus on developing his company's other tracked vehicles, but by the end of the decade, smaller, more efficient engines had been developed and were starting to come onto the market. Bombardier resumed his efforts to build a &quot;miniature&quot; snowmobile. He worked alongside his eldest son Germain, who shared his father's mechanical talents. Armand and Germain developed several prototypes of the lightweight snowmobile and finally, the first Bombardier snowmobile went on sale in 1959.<img src="BR100+sidea.jpg" title="fig:Bombardier BR100+ Groomer, mid engine, hard cab model" alt="Bombardier BR100+ Groomer, mid engine, hard cab model" /></p>
<p>The <a href="snowmobile" title="wikilink">Ski-doo</a> was originally called the &quot;Ski-Dog&quot; because Bombardier meant it to be a practical vehicle to replace the dogsled for hunters and trappers. By an accident, a painter misinterpreted the name and painted &quot;Ski-Doo&quot; on the first prototype.  The public soon discovered that speedy vehicles that could zoom over snow were a lot of fun. Suddenly a new winter sport was born, centred in Quebec. In the first year, Bombardier sold 225 Ski-Doos; four years later, 8,210 were sold. But Armand was reluctant to focus too much on the Ski-Doo and move resources away from his all-terrain vehicles. He vividly remembered his earlier business setbacks that forced him to diversify. Armand slowed down promotion of the Ski-Doo line to prevent it from dominating the other company products but still dominate the entire snowmobile industry. The snowmobiles produced were of exceptional quality and performance, earning a better reputation than the rival <a href="Polaris_Industries" title="wikilink">Polaris</a> and <a href="Arctic_Cat" title="wikilink">Arctic Cat</a> brand of motosleds. In 1975 Bombardier completed the purchase of the <a href="Moto-Ski" class="uri" title="wikilink">Moto-Ski</a> company.</p>
<p>On February 18, 1964, J. Armand Bombardier died of cancer at age 56. He left behind a thriving business, but also one that had been focused on one person. Armand dominated his company, overseeing all areas of operation. He controlled the small research department, making all the drawings himself. By the time of his death sales of the company had reached <a href="Canadian_dollar" title="wikilink">C$</a>20 <a href="million" class="uri" title="wikilink">million</a>, which is the equivalent of C$160 million in 2004 dollars. The younger generation took over, led by Armand's sons and sons-in-law. The young team reorganized and decentralized the company, adopting modern business tactics. The company adopted the latest technological innovation&lt;U+2014&gt;the computer&lt;U+2014&gt;to handle inventory, accounts and billing. Distribution networks were improved and increased, and an incentive program was developed for sales staff.</p>
<p>In 1967, L'Auto-Neige Bombardier Limit&lt;U+00E9&gt;e was renamed <strong>Bombardier Limited</strong> and on January 23, 1969, the company went public, listing on the <a href="Montreal_Exchange" title="wikilink">Montreal</a> and <a href="Toronto_Stock_Exchange" title="wikilink">Toronto</a> <a href="stock_exchange" title="wikilink">stock exchanges</a>.</p>

<h3 id="recreational-products">Recreational products</h3>
<p><img src="Bombardier_old.svg" title="fig:|right|150px|Old Bombardier sprocket logo" alt="|right|150px|Old Bombardier sprocket logo" />  On 27 August 2003 &lt;U+2013&gt; Bombardier, Inc. announced the sale of its BRP (Recreational Products) unit to the Bombardier family for $875 million.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> As part of the deal, BRP retained rights to the sprocket logo, which they subsequently modified. Its <a href="snowcat" title="wikilink">snowcats</a> and <a href="snowmobile" title="wikilink">snowmobiles</a> dated back to the origins of the company; current brands are Ski-Doo and <a href="Lynx_(snowmobile)" title="wikilink">Lynx</a>. Bombardier Recreational Products has also become well known for its <a href="Sea-Doo" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sea-Doo</a> <a href="personal_watercraft" title="wikilink">personal watercraft</a> division which also features jet-powered sport boats. Bombardier also makes ATVs (<a href="all_terrain_vehicle" title="wikilink">all terrain vehicles</a>). In 2006, the Bombardier ATV was rebranded as Can-Am. Can-Am is the old name of the line of dirt bikes it produced in the 1980s which used high-tech engines featuring RAVE (Rotax Automatic Variable Exhaust) valving to create peak power at a wider range of RPMs. The bikes were shelved but technology tweaks re-emerged in the Company's Ski-Doo snowmobiles (beginning with the 1989 model year Ski-Doo Mach 1). Many of today's snowmobiles produced by the Company feature proprietary engineering by BRPs Rotax brand engine production plant located in Austria. BRP's Can-Am product is among the high tech recreational vehicles which specifically include the <a href="Can-Am_Spyder" title="wikilink">Can-Am Spyder</a>, a three-wheel roadster with a rear-drive wheel and featuring a vehicle stability system (VSS), anti-lock braking system (ABS) and other safety and electronic vehicle control enhancements as certified by the <a href="National_Highway_Traffic_Safety_Administration" title="wikilink">National Highway Traffic Safety Administration</a> (NHTSA).</p>
