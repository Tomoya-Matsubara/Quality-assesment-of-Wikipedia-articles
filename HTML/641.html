<p><strong>Derventio</strong> was a small <a href="town" class="uri" title="wikilink">town</a> in the <a href="Roman_province" title="wikilink">Roman province</a> of <a href="Britannia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Britannia</a>. Today it is known as <a href="Little_Chester" title="wikilink">Little Chester</a>, on the outskirts of <a href="Derby" class="uri" title="wikilink">Derby</a>, located in the <a href="England" title="wikilink">English</a> county of <a href="Derbyshire" class="uri" title="wikilink">Derbyshire</a>.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="description">Description</h2>
<p>The first <a href="Roman_fort" title="wikilink">Roman fort</a> in the area was built on the opposite bank of the <a href="River_Derwent,_Derbyshire" title="wikilink">River Derwent</a> at <a href="Strutts_Park_Roman_fort" title="wikilink">Strutts Park</a>. It was replaced about AD 80 by a fort on the present site, but this only lasted about forty years, then was decommissioned. There was extensive Roman activity prompted by the fort, which was connected westward by a road to the <a href="Icknield_Street" title="wikilink">Icknield Street</a>, and to the east by a road to Sawley on the <a href="River_Trent" title="wikilink">River Trent</a>. A <a href="Derby_Racecourse_Roman_settlement" title="wikilink">fort-vicus</a> which manufactured pottery and did ironworking was founded 600m to the east on the Sawley Road. The fort was later re-occupied and re-used for a further twenty five years. The defensive bank and timber <a href="palisade" class="uri" title="wikilink">palisade</a> were now remodelled and stone gates built. Then it lay unoccupied until the late 3rd century when a stone wall was built around the town. <a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> It did not outlive the end of the 4th century.</p>
<p>The modern <em>Old Chester Road</em> bisects the site of the fort, and in the nineteenth century it was cut by a line of the <a href="Midland_Railway" title="wikilink">Midland Railway</a>.</p>
<h2 id="history">History</h2>

<p><img src="Roman.Britain.campaigns.43.to.60.jpg" title="fig:The campaigns of Ostorius Scapula" alt="The campaigns of Ostorius Scapula" /> This part of Britannia was occupied by a tribe known as the <a href="Cornovii" class="uri" title="wikilink">Cornovii</a>. In AD 46-47 the Roman Army under the direction of governor <a href="Aulus_Plautius" title="wikilink">Aulius Plautius</a> had probably occupied the lands to the south of the <a href="River_Trent" title="wikilink">River Trent</a>, so in AD 50 this was the front line. There is a shortage of written documentation about these years so reliance is made on archaeological excavations.Late in 47 the new governor of Britain, <a href="Ostorius_Scapula" title="wikilink">Ostorius Scapula</a>, began a campaign against the tribes of modern day <a href="Wales" class="uri" title="wikilink">Wales</a>, and the <a href="Cheshire_Plain" title="wikilink">Cheshire Gap</a>. During these times <a href="Strutts_Park_Roman_fort" title="wikilink">Strutts Park Roman fort</a>, was one of the new forts built along the new supply road from <a href="Wroxeter" class="uri" title="wikilink">Wroxeter</a> to <a href="Rossington" class="uri" title="wikilink">Rossington</a>.</p>
<p>The campaign to conquer the Silures continued under the governor <a href="Quintus_Veranius" title="wikilink">Quintus Veranius</a> and his successor <a href="Gaius_Suetonius_Paulinus" title="wikilink">Gaius Suetonius Paulinus</a> but by now Strutt Park's r&lt;U+00F4&gt;le was to maintain the peace. Around AD 74, the lands north of the River Mersey became unstable, when Queen Cartimandus had to ask for Roman assistance to fight off a rebellion. Then in AD78, <a href="Gnaeus_Julius_Agricola" title="wikilink">Gnaeus Julius Agricola</a>, made famous through the highly laudatory biography of him written by his son-in-law, <a href="Tacitus" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tacitus</a>, was made governor. He consolidated the forts, improved the road infrastructure and led some now well documented campaigns- firstly in AD78, he reconquered North Wales, then in AD79 he conquered the <a href="Brigantes" class="uri" title="wikilink">Brigantes</a> and <a href="Parisii" class="uri" title="wikilink">Parisii</a> taking all of Northern England up to the present Scottish border. Strutt's Park fort was vacated in AD 80 when <a href="Derventio" class="uri" title="wikilink">Derventio</a> was built.</p>
<p>Derventio was occupied for 40 years until around 120AD. To put this in context, the Emperor <a href="Hadrian" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hadrian</a> visited Britannia in AD120 and ordered his <a href="Hadrian&#39;s_Wall" title="wikilink">wall</a> to be built. Though Britannia always had a large garrison, focus now changed to industrial production. Derby produced pottery and had access to the lead mining to the north in the Peak District, later it became a centre for metalworking. This continued for the next 200 years.</p>
