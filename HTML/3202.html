Like its competitors <a href="Iridium_(satellite)" title="wikilink">Iridium</a> and <a href="Globalstar" class="uri" title="wikilink">Globalstar</a>, it filed for <a href="Chapter_11,_Title_11,_United_States_Code" title="wikilink">Chapter 11 protection</a>, in September, <a href="2000" class="uri" title="wikilink">2000</a>.

Two disc-shaped solar panels articulate in 1-axis to track the sun and provide 160 watts of power. Data can be received at 2400 <a href="kbit/s" class="uri" title="wikilink">kbit/s</a> and transmitted at 4800  kbit/s.

<h2 id="amateur-reception">Amateur reception</h2>
<p>Data transmisions from Orbcomm satellites can be decoded by amateurs using a simple VHF radio receiver (scanner) tuned to the band between 137 and 138 MHz to pick up the strong signals from these satellites. With OrbcommPlotter Software, an amateur can decode the telemetry and find out the positions of the satellites, their operational status and their uplink and downlink channels. Unlike most satellite signals, there are so many Orbcomm satellites that there is likely to be one within range of almost any spot on Earth at any time of the day or night.</p>
