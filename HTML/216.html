<p><strong>Farm-to-School Week</strong><br />
During the week of November 8&lt;U+2013&gt;12, 2010, James River Day School participated in its first Farm-to-School week. Students ate produce from local farms and on the last day, parents were invited to a farmers' market held at the school. They were able to see what their children were learning and purchase foods directly from the farmers. <a href="http://www.vdacs.virginia.gov/marketing/farm.shtml">Farms-to-School</a> is a state wide program in Virginia that teaches kids about the importance of eating local foods, and exposing kids to healthy eating earlier in life.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
