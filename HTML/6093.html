In the same year the College was assessed at &lt;U+00A3&gt;1 for the weekly sum of &lt;U+00A3&gt;40 charged on the colleges and halls for the fortification of the city.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> When the <a href="Oxford_Parliament_(1644)" title="wikilink">Oxford Parliament</a> was assembled during the Civil War in 1644, Oriel housed the Executive Committee of the <a href="Privy_council" title="wikilink">Privy council</a>, Parliament being held at neighbouring <a href="Christ_Church,_Oxford" title="wikilink">Christ Church</a>.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> Following the defeat of the Royalist cause, the University was scrutinised by the Parliamentarians, and five of the eighteen Oriel Fellows were removed.

<p>In 1673 James Davenant, a Fellow since 1661, complained to <a href="William_Fuller_(bishop)" title="wikilink">William Fuller</a>, then Bishop of Lincoln, about Provost Say's conduct in the election of Thomas Twitty to a Fellowship. Bishop Fuller appointed a commission that included the <a href="Vice-Chancellor" class="uri" title="wikilink">Vice-Chancellor</a>, <a href="Peter_Mews" title="wikilink">Peter Mews</a>, the Dean of Christ Church, <a href="John_Fell_(clergyman)" title="wikilink">John Fell</a>, and the Principal of <a href="Brasenose_College,_Oxford" title="wikilink">Brasenose</a>, Thomas Yates.

<p>On <a href="24_January" title="wikilink">24 January</a> <a href="1674" class="uri" title="wikilink">1674</a>, Bishop Fuller issued a decree dealing with the recommendations of the commissioners &lt;U+2014&gt; a majority of all the Fellows should always be insisted on, so the Provost could not push an election in a thin meeting, and Fellows should be admitted immediately after their election. On <a href="28_January" title="wikilink">28 January</a> Provost Say obtained a recommendation for Twitty's election from the King, but it was withdrawn on <a href="13_February" title="wikilink">13 February</a>, following the Vice-Chancellor's refusal to swear Twitty into the University and the Bishop's protests at Court.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a></p>

In 1721, Henry Edmunds was elected as a Fellow by 9 votes to 3; his election was rejected by Provost George Carter, and on appeal, by the Visitor, <a href="Edmund_Gibson" title="wikilink">Edmund Gibson</a>, then Bishop of Lincoln. Rejections of candidates by the Provost continued, fuelling discontent amongst the Fellows, until a <a href="writ_of_attachment" title="wikilink">writ of attachment</a> against the Bishop of Lincoln was heard between 1724 and 1726. The opposing Fellows, led by Edmunds, appealed to the first set of statutes, claiming the Crown as Visitor, making Gibson's decisions invalid; Provost Carter, supported by Bishop Gibson, appealed to the second set, claiming the Bishop of Lincoln as Visitor. The jury decided for the Fellows, supporting the original charter of Edward II. <a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a></p>

<p>In the early 19th century, the reforming zeal of Provosts John Eveleigh and <a href="Edward_Copleston" title="wikilink">Edward Copleston</a> gained Oriel the reputation of being the most brilliant college of the day and the centre of the &quot;Oxford <a href="Noetic" title="wikilink">Noetics</a>&quot; &lt;U+2014&gt; clerical liberals such as <a href="Richard_Whately" title="wikilink">Richard Whately</a> and <a href="Thomas_Arnold" title="wikilink">Thomas Arnold</a> were Fellows,<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> and the during the <a href="1830s" class="uri" title="wikilink">1830s</a>, two intellectually eminent Fellows of Oriel, <a href="John_Keble" title="wikilink">John Keble</a> and <a href="John_Henry_Newman" title="wikilink">John Henry Newman</a>, supported by <a href="Edward_Bouverie_Pusey" title="wikilink">Canon Pusey</a> of <a href="Christ_Church,_Oxford" title="wikilink">Christ Church</a> and others, formed a group known as the <a href="Oxford_Movement" title="wikilink">Oxford Movement</a>, alternatively as the Tractarians, or familiarly as the Puseyites. The group were disgusted by the <a href="laziness" title="wikilink">indolence</a> prevailing in the Church, and they sought to revive the spirit of <a href="early_Christianity" title="wikilink">early Christianity</a>,<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> <a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> this caused tension in College as Provost Edward Hawkins was a determined opponent of the Movement.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a></p>

At this time Oxford separated male and female students as far as possible; <a href="Vera_Brittain" title="wikilink">Vera Brittain</a>, one of the Somerville students, recalled an amusing occurrence during her time there in her autobiography, <em><a href="Testament_of_Youth" title="wikilink">Testament of Youth</a></em>;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[...] the few remaining undergraduates in the still masculine section of Oriel not unnaturally concluded that it would be a first-rate &quot;rag&quot; to break down the wall which divided them from the carefully guarded young females in St. Mary Hall. Great perturbation filled the souls of the Somerville dons when they came down to breakfast one morning to find that a large gap had suddenly appeared in the protecting masonry, through which had been thrust a hilarious placard:</p>
<p>&quot;'OO MADE THIS 'ERE 'OLE?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;MICE!!!&quot;</p>
<p>Throughout that day and the following night the Senior <a href="Common_Room_(university)#Oxford" title="wikilink">Common Room</a>, from the Principal downwards, took it in turns to sit on guard beside the hole, for fear any unruly spirit should escape through it to the forbidden adventurous males on the other side.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In 1985, the college became the last all-male college in Oxford to admit women for <a href="matriculation" class="uri" title="wikilink">matriculation</a> as undergraduates. In 1984, the Senior Common Room voted 23-4 to admit women undergraduates from 1986. The Junior Common Room president believed that &quot;the distinctive character of the college will be undermined&quot;.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a></p>

The south and west ranges and the clock tower were built around 1620 to 1622; the north and east ranges and the chapel buildings date from 1637 to 1642.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a><a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> The fa&lt;U+00E7&gt;ade of the east range forms a classical E shape comprising the college chapel, hall and <a href="undercroft" class="uri" title="wikilink">undercroft</a>.

<h4 id="hall">Hall</h4>
<p>In the centre of the East range, the <a href="portico" class="uri" title="wikilink">portico</a> of the hall entrance commemorates its construction during the reign of <a href="Charles_I_of_England" title="wikilink">Charles I</a> with the legend &quot;REGNANTE CAROLO&quot;, <em>in the reign of Charles</em>, in pierced stonework. The portico was completely rebuilt in 1897, and above it are statues of two Kings: Edward II on the left, and probably either Charles I or <a href="James_I_of_England" title="wikilink">James I</a>, although this is disputed; above those is a statue of the <a href="Blessed_Virgin_Mary" title="wikilink">Blessed Virgin Mary</a> after whom the College is officially named.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a></p>
<p>The hall has a <a href="hammerbeam_roof" title="wikilink">hammerbeam roof</a>; the louvre in the centre is now <a href="glazing_in_architecture" title="wikilink">glazed</a>, but was originally the only means of escape for smoke rising from a fireplace in the centre of the floor. The wooden panelling was designed by <a href="Ninian_Comper" title="wikilink">Ninian Comper</a> and was erected in 1911 in place of some previous <a href="Gothic_Revival_architecture" title="wikilink">19th-century Gothic</a> type, though even earlier panelling, dating from 1710, is evident in the Buttery.</p>
<p>Behind the High Table is a portrait of Edward II; underneath is a <a href="longsword" class="uri" title="wikilink">longsword</a> brought to the college in 1902 after being preserved for many years on one of the college's estates at <a href="Swainswick" class="uri" title="wikilink">Swainswick</a>, near <a href="Bath,_Somerset" title="wikilink">Bath</a>. On either side are portraits of <a href="Walter_Raleigh" title="wikilink">Sir Walter Raleigh</a> and <a href="Joseph_Butler" title="wikilink">Joseph Butler</a>. The other portraits around the hall include other prominent members of Oriel such as <a href="Cecil_Rhodes" title="wikilink">Cecil Rhodes</a>, <a href="Matthew_Arnold" title="wikilink">Matthew Arnold</a>, <a href="Thomas_Arnold" title="wikilink">Thomas Arnold</a>, <a href="James_Anthony_Froude" title="wikilink">James Anthony Froude</a>, <a href="John_Keble" title="wikilink">John Keble</a>, <a href="John_Henry_Cardinal_Newman" title="wikilink">John Henry Newman</a>, <a href="Richard_Whately" title="wikilink">Richard Whately</a> and <a href="John_Robinson_(1650-1723)" title="wikilink">John Robinson</a>.</p>

<h4 id="chapel">Chapel</h4>
<p>The current chapel is Oriel's third, the first being built around 1373 on the north side of the front quadrangle. By 1566, the chapel was located on the south side of the quadrangle, as shown in a drawing made for <a href="Elizabeth_I_of_England" title="wikilink">Elizabeth I</a>'s visit to Oxford in that year. The present building was consecrated in 1642 and despite subsequent restorations it largely retains its original appearance.</p>
<p><img src="Oriel_College_St_Margaret.jpg" title="fig:In the gallery of the chapel is a late medieval stained glass image of St Margaret of Antioch." alt="In the gallery of the chapel is a late medieval stained glass image of St Margaret of Antioch." width="210" /> The bronze <a href="rostrum" title="wikilink">lectern</a> was given to the College in 1654. The black and white marble paving dates from 1677-78. Except for the <a href="pew" title="wikilink">pews</a> on the west, dating from 1884, the panelling, stalls and screens are all 17th-century, as are the altar and carved <a href="altar_rails" title="wikilink">communion rails</a>. Behind the altar is <a href="Bernard_van_Orley" title="wikilink">Bernard van Orley</a>'s <em><a href="Stations_of_the_Cross" title="wikilink">The Carrying of the Cross</a></em> &lt;U+2014&gt; a companion-piece to this painting is in the <a href="National_Gallery_of_Scotland" title="wikilink">National Gallery of Scotland</a>. The organ case dates from 1716; originally designed by Christopher Schreider for St Mary Abbots Church, Kensington, it was acquired by Oriel in 1884.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a></p>
<p>In the north-west window of the gallery there is a small piece of <a href="Late_Middle_Ages" title="wikilink">late medieval</a> glass, a figure of <a href="Saint_Margaret_the_Virgin" title="wikilink">St Margaret of Antioch</a>. In the south window of the gallery there is a painted window of &quot;<a href="Presentation_of_Jesus_at_the_Temple" title="wikilink">The Presentation of Christ in the Temple</a>&quot;, executed by William Peckitt of York. It was originally set in the east window in 1767; a later version of his work can be seen in <a href="New_College,_Oxford" title="wikilink">New College</a> Chapel. The rest of the <a href="stained_glass" title="wikilink">stained glass</a> is <a href="Victorian_era" title="wikilink">Victorian</a>: the earliest is on the easternmost part of the south side; the rest date from after the 1884 restorations by Powell.</p>
<p>Above the entrance to the chapel is an oriel that, until the <a href="1880s" class="uri" title="wikilink">1880s</a>, was a room on the first floor that formed part of a set of rooms that were occupied by <a href="Richard_Whately" title="wikilink">Richard Whately</a>, and later by <a href="John_Henry_Cardinal_Newman" title="wikilink">John Newman</a>. Whately is said to have used the space as a larder and Newman is said to have used it for his private prayers &lt;U+2014&gt; when the organ was installed in 1884, the space was used for the blower. The wall that once separated the room from the <a href="ante-chapel" class="uri" title="wikilink">ante-chapel</a> was removed, making it accessible from the chapel. The organ was built by J. W. Walker &amp; Sons in 1988;<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> in 1991 the space behind the organ was rebuilt as an oratory and memorial to Newman and the <a href="Oxford_Movement" title="wikilink">Oxford Movement</a>. A new stained glass window designed by Vivienne Haig and realised by Douglas Hogg was completed and installed in 2001.</p>
<p>During the late <a href="1980s" class="uri" title="wikilink">1980s</a>, the chapel was extensively restored with the assistance of donations from Lady Norma Dalrymple-Champneys. During this work, the chandelier, given in 1885 by Provost Shadwell while still a Fellow, was put back in place, the organ was restored, the painting mounted behind the altar, and the chapel repainted. A list of former chaplains and organ scholars was erected in the ante-chapel.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="second-quadrangle">Second quadrangle</h3>
<p>Originally a garden, the demand for more accommodation for undergraduates in the early 18th century resulted in two free-standing blocks being built. The first block erected was the Robinson Building on the east side, built in 1720 by <a href="John_Robinson_(1650-1723)" title="wikilink">Bishop Robinson</a> at the suggestion of his wife, as the inscription over the door records. Its twin block, the Carter Building, was erected on the west side in 1729, as a result of a benefaction by Provost Carter. The two buildings stood for nearly a hundred years as detached blocks in the garden, and the architectural elements of the First quad are repeated on them &lt;U+2014&gt; only here the seven gables are all alike. In the early 19th century they were joined up to the Front quad with their present, rather incongruous connecting links. In the link to the Robinson building, two purpose-built rooms have been incorporated - the Champneys Room, designed by Weldon Champneys, the nephew of <a href="Basil_Champneys" title="wikilink">Basil Champneys</a>, and the Benefactors Room, a panelled room honouring benefactors of the college.</p>

<h3 id="st-mary-hall-and-the-third-quadrangle">St Mary Hall and the third quadrangle</h3>
<p>The south, east and west ranges of third quadrangle contain elements of <a href="St_Mary_Hall,_Oxford" title="wikilink">St Mary Hall</a>, which was incorporated into Oriel in 1902; less than a decade later, the Hall's buildings on the northern side were demolished for the construction of the Rhodes Building. Bedel Hall in the south was formally amalgamated with St Mary Hall in 1505.</p>
<p>In the south range, parts of the medieval buildings survive and are incorporated into staircase ten &lt;U+2014&gt; the straight, steep flight of stairs and timber framed partitions date from a mid-15th century rebuilding of St Mary Hall. The former Chapel, Hall and Buttery of St Mary Hall, built in 1640, form part of the Junior Library and Junior Common Room. Viewed from the third quad, the Chapel, with its <a href="Gothic_architecture" title="wikilink">Gothic</a> windows, can be seen to have been built neatly on top of the Hall, a unique example in Oxford of such a plan.</p>
<p>On the east side of the quad is a simple rustic style timber-frame building; known as the &quot;the Dolls House&quot;, it was erected by Principal King in 1743.</p>
<p>In 1826 an ornate range was erected in the <a href="Gothic_Revival_architecture" title="wikilink">Gothic Revival</a> style, incorporating the old gate of St Mary Hall, on the west side of the quad. The large projecting window on the first floor, at the north end, was once the drawing room of the Principal of Hall. Parts of the street wall incorporated into this range show traces of blocked windows dating from the same period of rebuilding in the 15th century as staircase ten.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a></p>

It was designed by <a href="Basil_Champneys" title="wikilink">Basil Champneys</a> and stands on the site of the Principal's house, on the High Street. Champney's first proposal for the building included an open <a href="arcade_(architecture)" title="wikilink">arcade</a> to the High Street, a <a href="dome" title="wikilink">domed</a> central feature and <a href="baluster" title="wikilink">balustraded</a> <a href="parapet" class="uri" title="wikilink">parapet</a>. The left hand block and much of the centre was to be given up to a new Provost's Lodging, and the five windows on the first floor above the arcade were to light a gallery belonging to the Lodging. The college eventually decided to retain the existing Provost's Lodging and demanded detailing &quot;more in accordance with the style which has become traditional in Oxford&quot;. It became the last building of the <a href="Jacobethan" title="wikilink">Jacobean revival style</a> in Oxford.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> On the side facing the High Street, there is a statue of Rhodes over the main entrance, with <a href="Edward_VII_of_the_United_Kingdom" title="wikilink">Edward VII</a> and <a href="George_V_of_the_United_Kingdom" title="wikilink">George V</a> beneath. The inscription reads: &quot;e Larga MUnIfICentIa CaeCILII rhoDes&quot;, which, as well as acknowledging Rhodes' munificence, is a <a href="chronogram" class="uri" title="wikilink">chronogram</a> giving the date of construction, MDCCCLLVIIIIII. The building was not entirely well received; William Sherwood, Mayor of Oxford and Master of <a href="Magdalen_College_School,_Oxford" title="wikilink">Magdalen College School</a>, wrote:</p>

The south wall of the building, which survives, was partly of stone and contains a large two-light early 14th-century window. The cellar below is of the same date and is the best preserved medieval cellar in Oxford; originally entered by stone steps from the street, it has a stone <a href="vault_(architecture)" title="wikilink">vault</a> divided into four sections by two diagonal ribs, with carved <a href="corbel" title="wikilink">corbels</a>.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a></p>

The old shops on each side of the road were pulled down and rebuilt, and to preserve the continuity, the new shops were numbered 108 and 109&lt;U+2013&gt;112.

<h2 id="grace">Grace</h2>
<p>Before <a href="formal_(university)" title="wikilink">formal Hall</a> each evening, the following Latin <a href="grace_(prayer)" title="wikilink">grace</a> is recited by one of the student bible clerks.

<blockquote>
<p><em>Benedicte Deus, qui pascis nos a juventute nostra et praebes cibum omni carni, reple gaudio et laetitia corda nostra ut nos affatim quod satis est habentes abundemus in omne opus bonum, per Jesum Christum Dominum nostrum, cui, tecum et Spiritu Sancto, sit omnis honos, laus et imperium, in saecula saeculorum.</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Blessed God, who feeds us from our youth and provides food for all flesh, fill our hearts with joy and gladness, that we, having enough to satisfy us, may abound in every good work. Through Jesus Christ our Lord, to whom with You and the Holy Spirit, be all honour, praise, and power for all ages.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After the meal, the Provost, or a Fellow, usually recites a short Latin prayer [<em>Benedicto benedicatur, per Jesum Christum</em>, Let praise be given to/by the Blessed One] instead of the full <em>post cibum</em> grace:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Domine Deus, resurrection et vita credentium, qui semper es laudandus cum in viventibus tum in defunctis, agimus tibi gratias pro Eduardo secundo, Fundatore nostro, pro Adamo De Brome, praecipuo benefactore caeterisque benefactoribus nostris, quorum benficiis hic as pietatem et ad studia bonarum literarum alimur; rogantes ut nos his donis tuis recte utentes, ad resurrectionis gloriam immortalem perducamur, per Jesum Christum Dominum nostrum.</em></p>

<p>Accommodation is provided for all undergraduates, and for some graduates, though some accommodation is off-site. Members are generally expected to dine in hall, where there are two sittings every evening, one <a href="Informal_Hall" title="wikilink">informal</a> and one <a href="formal_(university)" title="wikilink">formal</a>, except on Saturdays, where there is only an informal sitting.<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a> The Bar, situated underneath the Hall, serves food from mid-morning and drinks in the evening; its LCD TV was installed prior to the <a href="2006_FIFA_World_Cup" title="wikilink">2006 football World Cup</a>.
