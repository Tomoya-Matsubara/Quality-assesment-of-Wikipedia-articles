<p>The son of <a href="Shoshenq_I" title="wikilink">Shoshenq I</a> and his chief consort, Karomat A, <strong>Sekhemkheperre Osorkon I</strong> was the second king of <a href="Egypt" class="uri" title="wikilink">Egypt</a>'s <a href="Twenty-second_dynasty_of_Egypt" title="wikilink">22nd Dynasty</a> and ruled around <a href="922_BC" title="wikilink">922 BC</a>-<a href="887_BC" title="wikilink">887 BC</a>. He succeeded his father <a href="Shoshenq_I" title="wikilink">Shoshenq I</a> who probably died within 2-3 years of his successful 925 BC campaign against the kingdoms of <a href="Kingdom_of_Israel" title="wikilink">Israel</a> and <a href="Kingdom_of_Judah" title="wikilink">Judah</a>. Osorkon I's reign is known for many <a href="temple" class="uri" title="wikilink">temple</a> building projects and was a long and prosperous period of Egypt's History. His highest known date is a &quot;Year 33 Second <a href="Sed_festival" title="wikilink">Heb Sed</a>&quot; inscription found on the bandage of Nakhtefmut's Mummy which held a bracellet inscribed with Osorkon I's <a href="Fivefold_Titulary" title="wikilink">praenomen</a>: <strong>Sekhemkheperre</strong>. This date can only belong to Osorkon I since no other early Dynasty 22 king ruled for close to 30 years until the time of <a href="Osorkon_II" title="wikilink">Osorkon II</a>. Other mummy linens which belong to his reign include three separate bandages dating to his Regnal Years 11, 12, and 23 on the mummy of Khonsmaakheru in Berlin. The bandages are anonymously dated but definitely belong to his reign because Khonsmaakheru wore leather bands that contained a <em><a href="Menat" title="wikilink">menat</a>-tab</em> naming Osorkon I (see Altenm&lt;U+00FC&gt;ller below). Secondly, no other king who ruled around Osorkon I's reign had a 23rd Regnal Year including <a href="Shoshenq_I" title="wikilink">Shoshenq I</a> who died in his Year 22.</p>
<p>While <a href="Manetho" class="uri" title="wikilink">Manetho</a> gives Osorkon I a reign of 15 Years in his <em>&lt;U+00C6&gt;gyptiaca</em>, this is most likely an error for 35 Years based on the evidence of the second Heb Sed bandage, as <a href="Kenneth_Kitchen" title="wikilink">Kenneth Kitchen</a> notes. Osorkon I's throne name--<strong>Sekhemkheperre</strong>--means &quot;Powerful are the Manifestations of Re.&quot; (Clayton: p.185)</p>
<h2 id="osorkon-is-successor">Osorkon I's successor</h2>
<p>Although Osorkon I is thought to have been directly succeeded by his son <a href="Takelot_I" title="wikilink">Takelot I</a>, it is possible that another ruler, Heqakheperre <a href="Shoshenq_II" title="wikilink">Shoshenq II</a>, intervened briefly between these two kings because Takelot I was a son of Osorkon I through Queen Tashedkhons, a secondary wife of this king. In contrast, Osorkon I's senior wife was Queen Maatkare B, who may have been Shoshenq II's mother. However, Shoshenq II could also have been another son of <a href="Shoshenq_I" title="wikilink">Shoshenq I</a> since the latter was the only other king to be mentioned in objects from Shoshenq II's intact royal tomb at <a href="Tanis,_Egypt" title="wikilink">Tanis</a> aside from Shoshenq II himself. These objects are inscribed with either Shoshenq I's praenomen <em>Hedjkheperre Shoshenq</em> (though this is not certain as it requires reading the objects as a massive hierogylyphic text), or <em>Shoshenq, Great Chief of the <a href="Meshwesh" class="uri" title="wikilink">Meshwesh</a></em>, which was Shoshenq I's title before he became king. Since Derry's forensic examination of his Mummy reveals him to be a Man in his fifties upon his death, Shoshenq II could have lived beyond Osorkon's 35 year reign and Takelot I's 13 year reign to assumed the throne for a few short years. Against this proposal is the fact that most kings of the period are named after their grandfathers, and not their fathers.</p>
<p>While <a href="Kenneth_Kitchen" title="wikilink">Kenneth A. Kitchen</a> (1996, &lt;U+00A7&gt;269) views Shoshenq II as the High Priest of Amun at Thebes <a href="Shoshenq_C" title="wikilink">Shoshenq C</a>, and a short-lived coregent of Osorkon I who predeceased his father, the well-respected German Egyptologist <a href="J&lt;U+00FC&gt;rgen_von_Beckerath" title="wikilink">J&lt;U+00FC&gt;rgen von Beckerath</a> in his seminal 1997 book, Chronologie des Pharaonischen &lt;U+00C4&gt;gypten, maintains that Shoshenq II was rather an independent king of Tanis who ruled the 22nd Dynasty in his own right for ca.2 Years. (Beckerath, Chronologie, pp.94-98) This hypothesis is supported by the fact that Shoshenq II employed a complete <a href="Fivefold_Titulary" title="wikilink">royal titulary</a> along with a distinct prenomen Heqakheperre and his intact tomb at Tanis was filled with numerous treasures including jewelled pectorals and bracellets, an impressive falconheaded silver coffin and a gold face maskâ€“items which indicate a genuine king of the 22nd Dynasty. More significantly, however, no mention of Osorkon I's name was preserved on any <a href="ushabti" title="wikilink">ushabtis</a>, jars, jewelry or other objects within Shoshenq II's tomb. This situation would be improbable if he was indeed Osorkon I's son, and was buried by his father, as Kitchen's Chronology suggests. These facts, taken together, imply that Sheshonq II ruled on his own accord at Tanis and was not a mere coregent.</p>
<p><a href="Manetho" class="uri" title="wikilink">Manetho</a>'s Epitome states that &quot;3 Kings&quot; separate Osorkon I from Takelot I. (Beckerath, Chronologie, p.95) This could be an error on Manetho's part or an allusion to Shoshenq II's reign. It may also be a reference to the recently discovered early Dynasty 22 king <a href="Tutkheperre_Shoshenq" title="wikilink">Tutkheperre Shoshenq</a>, whose existence is now corroborated by an architectural block from the Great Temple of Bubastis, where Osorkon I and Osorkon II are well attested monumentally. (Eva Lange, GM 203)</p>
<h2 id="aftermath">Aftermath</h2>
<p>Osorkon I's reign in Egypt was peaceful and uneventful; however, both his son and grandson, <a href="Takelot_I" title="wikilink">Takelot I</a> and <a href="Osorkon_II" title="wikilink">Osorkon II</a> respectively, later encountered difficulties controlling Thebes and <a href="Upper_and_Lower_Egypt" title="wikilink">Upper Egypt</a> within their own reigns since they had to deal with a rival king: <a href="Harsiese_A" title="wikilink">Harsiese A</a>. Osorkon I's tomb has never been found.</p>
