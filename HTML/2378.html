<h2 id="humor">Humor</h2>
<p>A popular Internet joke claims that William B. Spong of Virginia and <a href="Hiram_Fong" title="wikilink">Hiram Fong</a> of Hawaii sponsored a bill recommending the mass ringing of church bells to welcome the arrival in Hong Kong of the U.S. Table Tennis Team after its tour of Communist China. The bill failed to pass, cheating the Senate out of passing the Spong-Fong Hong Kong Ping Pong Ding Dong Bell Bill.</p>
<p>In fact, Senator Spong never sponsored such a bill, but he did have some fun with the press soon after arriving in Washington, D.C. As described in an article by his cousin, the Rt. Rev. <a href="John_Shelby_Spong" title="wikilink">John Shelby Spong</a>, Senator Spong</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;was invited with the other freshman senators to address the National Press Club. Fearful that someone on radio or television would call him Senator Sponge, he used his brief five-minute introductory speech to that body to secure proper name identification. His first act as a senator, he announced in his southern drawl, would be to introduce a bill to protect the rights of songwriters in Hong Kong. He would be joined in this effort by the senior senator of Louisiana, <a href="Russell_Long" title="wikilink">Russell Long</a>, and the junior senator from Hawaii, Hiram Fong, and together they would present the Long Fong Spong Hong Kong Song Bill. His name was never mispronounced by members of the media.&quot;</p>
