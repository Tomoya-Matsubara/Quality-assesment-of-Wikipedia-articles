<p>&quot;<strong>In a Mirror, Darkly</strong>&quot; is the 18th and 19th episodes of the fourth season of American <a href="science_fiction" title="wikilink">science fiction</a> television series <em><a href="Star_Trek:_Enterprise" title="wikilink">Star Trek: Enterprise</a></em>, and originally aired on April 22 and 29, 2005. The episode was developed to be a sequel to <em><a href="Star_Trek:_The_Original_Series" title="wikilink">The Original Series</a></em> episode &quot;<a href="The_Tholian_Web" title="wikilink">The Tholian Web</a>&quot; and a prequel to &quot;<a href="Mirror,_Mirror_(Star_Trek:_The_Original_Series)" title="wikilink">Mirror, Mirror</a>&quot;. The decision to set an <em>Enterprise</em> episode in the mirror universe originated with a pitch to enable <a href="William_Shatner" title="wikilink">William Shatner</a> to appear in the series. The teleplays for both parts of the episode were written by <a href="Mike_Sussman_(TV_series_writer/producer)" title="wikilink">Mike Sussman</a>, with <a href="Manny_Coto" title="wikilink">Manny Coto</a> contributing the story for the second part.</p>
<p>Set in the 22nd century, the series normally follows the adventures of the first <a href="Starfleet" class="uri" title="wikilink">Starfleet</a> starship <em><a href="Enterprise_(NX-01)" title="wikilink">Enterprise</a></em>, registration NX-01. However, these episodes feature a <a href="Mirror_Universe_(Star_Trek)" title="wikilink">mirror universe</a> <a href="Jonathan_Archer" title="wikilink">Jonathan Archer</a> (<a href="Scott_Bakula" title="wikilink">Scott Bakula</a>) and his crew. The mirror universe features evil duplicates of the normal universe characters, who instead of being part of the Federation, they instead serve the Terran Empire. In the first part, the ISS <em>Enterprise</em> encounters a Starfleet ship from the future of the main universe which is being stripped for parts by the <a href="Tholian" title="wikilink">Tholians</a>, and seeks to take the ship from the aliens. The second part sees the crew transferred to the USS <em>Defiant</em> and seeking to takeover Starfleet after dealing with an alien infiltrator.</p>
<p>The episode saw the re-use of footage from <em><a href="Star_Trek:_First_Contact" title="wikilink">Star Trek: First Contact</a></em> and the creation of an alternative opening credits sequence which included footage from other <a href="Paramount_Pictures" title="wikilink">Paramount</a> properties such as the film <em><a href="The_Hunt_for_Red_October_(film)" title="wikilink">The Hunt for Red October</a></em>. A three-quarters around bridge from <em>The Original Series</em> era was constructed, as well as other sets from a <a href="Constitution_class_starship" title="wikilink">Constitution class starship</a>. A <a href="Gorn_(Star_Trek)" title="wikilink">Gorn</a> and a Tholian were both created using <a href="Computer-generated_imagery" title="wikilink">CGI</a>, with the Gorn utilising <a href="motion_capture" title="wikilink">motion capture</a> techniques. The episode also saw the return of <a href="Vaughn_Armstrong" title="wikilink">Vaughn Armstrong</a> after his main universe character was killed on screen earlier in the season in the episode &quot;<a href="The_Forge_(Star_Trek:_Enterprise)" title="wikilink">The Forge</a>&quot;. The critical response to the episode was initially mixed, but it subsequently appeared in several lists of the best episodes of <em>Star Trek: Enterprise</em>. It was nominated for an <a href="Emmy_Award" title="wikilink">Emmy Award</a> for Outstanding Hairstyling For A Series in 2005.</p>
<h2 id="plot">Plot</h2>
<h3 id="part-i">Part I</h3>
<p>In 2063, a <a href="Vulcan_(Star_Trek)" title="wikilink">Vulcan</a> ship descends and lands on Earth, making first contact with humans (as previously seen in the film <em><a href="Star_Trek:_First_Contact" title="wikilink">Star Trek: First Contact</a></em>). However instead of peacefully greeting the aliens, <a href="Zefram_Cochrane" title="wikilink">Zefram Cochrane</a> (<a href="James_Cromwell" title="wikilink">James Cromwell</a>) shoots the lead Vulcan and the humans rush onto the ship to loot it. The episode jumps forward to 2155 aboard the ISS <em>Enterprise</em> as Dr <a href="Phlox_(Star_Trek)" title="wikilink">Phlox</a> (<a href="John_Billingsley" title="wikilink">John Billingsley</a>) and Major <a href="Malcolm_Reed" title="wikilink">Malcolm Reed</a> (<a href="Dominic_Keating" title="wikilink">Dominic Keating</a>) demonstrate the new torture device, the agony booth, to Captain <a href="Maxwell_Forrest" title="wikilink">Maximilian Forrest</a> (<a href="Vaughn_Armstrong" title="wikilink">Vaughn Armstrong</a>) and Commander <a href="Jonathan_Archer" title="wikilink">Jonathan Archer</a> (<a href="Scott_Bakula" title="wikilink">Scott Bakula</a>). Afterwards, Archer suggests to Forrest that travel into <a href="Tholian" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tholian</a> space, as he has heard rumours of a technology they might wish to steal. The two begin to argue, and Archer only backs down under the threat or torture. Forrest returns to his quarters where he is comforted by <a href="Hoshi_Sato" title="wikilink">Hoshi Sato</a> (<a href="Linda_Park" title="wikilink">Linda Park</a>) in her role as the &quot;Captain's woman&quot;. When he leaves, he is ambushed by Archer and several marines and sent to the <a href="brig" class="uri" title="wikilink">brig</a>. Archer travels to the bridge and announces over the communications system to the rest of the ship that he has taken command in a <a href="mutiny" class="uri" title="wikilink">mutiny</a>. He orders a change of course and tells <a href="T&#39;Pol" class="uri" title="wikilink">T'Pol</a> (<a href="Jolene_Blalock" title="wikilink">Jolene Blalock</a>) to help install a <a href="cloaking_device" title="wikilink">cloaking device</a> they had captured from the <a href="Suliban" class="uri" title="wikilink">Suliban</a>.</p>
<p>Archer promotes T'Pol to first officer and assigns Sergeant <a href="Travis_Mayweather" title="wikilink">Travis Mayweather</a> (<a href="Anthony_Montgomery" title="wikilink">Anthony Montgomery</a>) as his personal guard. Hoshi arrives as Mayweather departs, and she proposes that she continues the relationship she had with Forrest but instead with Archer in his new position. The <em>Enterprise</em> drops out of warp and attacks a Tholian vessel, capturing it's single inhabitant by <a href="Transporter_(Star_Trek)" title="wikilink">transporter beam</a>. Dr Phlox reveals that under torture the Tholian told of a Terran (the terminology for Humans in the mirror universe) vessel they had captured. When T'Pol and Chief Engineer <a href="Trip_Tucker" title="wikilink">Charles Tucker</a> attempt to install the cloaking device, it emits an electrical discharge suggesting <a href="sabotage" class="uri" title="wikilink">sabotage</a>. Archer questions Forrest, who denies all knowledge, and Reed tortures Tucker in the agony booth expecting him to be the saboteur. Archer has Hoshi send a criptic message to Starfleet command about their mission to free the captured Terran vessel.</p>
<p>T'Pol leads a team to successfully free Forrest from the brig, and afterwards takes back the bridge. However, Archer has locked helm controls onto their destination. Forrest subsequently has Archer tortured in the agony booth for ten hours, but orders his release after he received a message from Starfleet who agreed with Archer's plans. Forrest holds a staff briefing where Archer shows images of the captured Terran vessel which he purchased from a freed former slave of the Tholians. It is the USS <em>Defiant</em> (previously seen in &quot;<a href="The_Tholian_Web" title="wikilink">The Tholian Web</a>&quot;). Afterwards, Tucker threatens T'Pol after he finds out she used a series of <a href="Mind_meld" title="wikilink">mind melds</a> to make him sabotage the cloaking device in order to provide a distraction so she could free Forrest. The two successfully install the device and the ship goes under cloak prior to approaching the Tholian shipyard where the <em>Defiant</em> is located. An assault team including Archer, T'Pol and Tucker transport across to the <em>Defiant</em>. They make their way to the bridge, and Archer orders Tucker to begin powering up the vessel. Four Tholian vessels approach and attack the <em>Enterprise</em> encasing it in a Tholian web. Forrest orders the crew to abandon ship but remains behind as the <em>Enterprise</em> is destroyed.</p>
<h3 id="part-ii">Part II</h3>
<p>The crew on board the <em>Defiant</em> have difficulty releasing the docking clamps, and by the time they do, several Tholian ships have created a Tholian web over the opening of the dock to prevent the ship from leaving. T'Pol and Tucker restore power to the weapon systems, and the ship destroys the web and some of the Tholian ships. The <em>Defiant</em> manoeuvres out of the dock and Archer orders that the escape pods from the <em>Enterprise</em> be retrieved. Tucker is ordered to restore power to the <a href="warp_drive" title="wikilink">warp drive</a> with the help of the former Tholian slaves left on board the ship. After a staff meeting, Archer is angry at T'Pol for her betrayal, who pledges her loyalty to him once more. Hoshi goes to the captain's quarters and finds that Archer has changed into the uniform of the <em>Defiant</em>{{'s}} former captain. The two discuss the ship's records which includes information on themselves from the other universe for the next hundred years. Meanwhile Ensign Kelby (<a href="Derek_Magyar" title="wikilink">Derek Magyar</a>) is attacked while in a jefferies tube attempting to fix the warp drive systems. His body is found, and the crew discover after questioning one of the slaves that the assailant is a <a href="Gorn_(Star_Trek)" title="wikilink">Gorn</a> named Slar.</p>
<p>Archer begins to hallucinate that his other universe version is talking to him. He decides to communicate with the Gorn who offers to return some stolen components in return for being able to leave in a <a href="Shuttlecraft_(Star_Trek)" title="wikilink">shuttlecraft</a>. Archer decides to lead an assault team which includes Reed to take on the Gorn. Reed and three marines are killed by a trap left by the Gorn. Archer and the last marine track down the Gorn, and after a fight, the Gorn is killed. With the components retrieved, Tucker is able to repair the warp drive and the ship continues on its way. The <em>Defiant</em> saves the ISS <em>Avenger</em> from an attack by four rebel spacecraft. The <em>Avenger</em>{{'s}} commanding officer, Admiral Black (<a href="Gregory_Itzin" title="wikilink">Gregory Itzin</a>) comes aboard the <em>Defiant</em> for a tour accompanied by his first officer, <a href="Soval" class="uri" title="wikilink">Soval</a> (<a href="Gary_Graham" title="wikilink">Gary Graham</a>). After Black refuses Archer's request for a battlefield commission to Captain, Archer again hallucinates his other universe version. Archer pulls out a phaser and disintegrates Black.</p>
<p>Archer gives a speech to the officers of the <em>Defiant</em> and <em>Avenger</em> saying that they should move against Starfleet command using the advanced technology of the <em>Defiant</em>. Soval and T'Pol meet, sharing their fears that Archer will decimate the Vulcans and make a plan to sabotage the <em>Defiant</em>. Archer and Sato discuss his plan to transfer all non-humans off of the <em>Defiant</em> with the exception of Phlox. The Doctor is summoned to the <em>Avenger</em> where T'Pol and Soval convince him to join their movement. When T'Pol returns to the <em>Defiant</em>, she is captured by Sato and a team of marines, but Phlox manages to decrease the power settings on board the <em>Defiant</em>. This prompts Soval on the <em>Avenger</em> to launch an attack against the <em>Defiant</em>, but after Tucker finds Phlox and restores power, the <em>Defiant</em> destroys the other ship. Sato and Archer celebrate in the captain's quarters. Archer collapses to the floor, discovering too late that Sato has betrayed him and was working with Mayweather, whom she embraces. The <em>Defiant</em> enters orbit of Earth, and Sato contacts Admiral Gardner (<a href="John_Mahon_(actor)" title="wikilink">John Mahon</a>) and demands Earth's surrender or else the <em>Defiant</em> will attack. Gardner does not know who she is, and she advises him that he should address her as &quot;Empress Sato&quot;.</p>

<h3 id="writing-and-filming">Writing and filming</h3>
<p><a href="image:William_Shatner_at_Comic-Con_2012_cropped.jpg" title="wikilink">thumb|right|upright|The idea to include the mirror universe in <em>Enterprise</em> originated from a pitch which would have featured William Shatner.</a> The idea of returning to the mirror universe in <em>Enterprise</em> was first suggested by <a href="Judith_and_Garfield_Reeves-Stevens" title="wikilink">Judith and Garfield Reeves-Stevens</a>. In &quot;<a href="Mirror,_Mirror_(Star_Trek:_The_Original_Series)" title="wikilink">Mirror, Mirror</a>&quot;, the tantalus field was used on several occasions and was thought to be a <a href="Disintegrator_ray" title="wikilink">disintegrator</a>. The Reeves-Stevens proposed that it could be explained that instead of killing its victims, the field instead transported them back through time to a <a href="penal_colony" title="wikilink">penal colony</a> in the main universe. The <em>Enterprise</em> would then come across the penal colony, meeting <a href="James_T._Kirk" title="wikilink">Tiberius</a>, portrayed by <a href="William_Shatner" title="wikilink">William Shatner</a>.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>Tiberius would seek to use the transporter aboard the <em>Enterprise</em> to return to his own universe, but discovers that it has not yet diverged from the main universe and does not exist. The episode would then have explored the creation of the mirror universe through actions by Tiberius and Captain Archer. The storyline was pitched by Shatner, who had worked with the Reeves-Stevens on the <a href="Shatnerverse" class="uri" title="wikilink">Shatnerverse</a> series of <em>Star Trek</em> novels, to <a href="Manny_Coto" title="wikilink">Manny Coto</a>, <a href="Brannon_Braga" title="wikilink">Brannon Braga</a> and <a href="Rick_Berman" title="wikilink">Rick Berman</a>. However, Berman had already received a pitch by <a href="Mike_Sussman_(TV_series_writer/producer)" title="wikilink">Mike Sussman</a> which would have Shatner portray an ancestor of Captain Kirk, who happened to be the chef on the <em>Enterprise</em> (NX-01). The three pitched the idea to Shatner, but negotiations fell through and terms were not agreed for him to appear on the show.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> <a href="image:Enterprise_smithsonian.JPG" title="wikilink">thumb|left|The episode saw the re-appearance of an <em>The Original Series</em> era Constitution-class starship <em>(USS Enterprise model pictured)</em></a> Instead, Sussman began development on the script which saw the USS <em>Defiant</em> from &quot;The Tholian Web&quot; being brought back in time, instead of Tiberius.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> It was intended to be a sequel to that episode, as well as a prequel to &quot;Mirror, Mirror&quot;.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> Sussman developed the teleplays for both parts of the episode, with Coto contributing the story for the second half.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> It was decided to have the entire episode in the mirror universe in order to maintain the events of &quot;Mirror, Mirror&quot; as being first contact between the two universes.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> The mirror universe features evil duplicates of the characters from the normal universe.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> Sussman had previously sought to use the <em>Defiant</em> in the second series episode &quot;<a href="Future_Tense_(Star_Trek:_Enterprise)" title="wikilink">Future Tense</a>&quot;, but both costs and issues with the plot resulted in it being replaced with a previously unseen timeship.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p>The first part of &quot;In a Mirror, Darkly&quot; was the 700th live-action <em>Star Trek</em> episode broadcast.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> On the sixth day of filming the second part of the episode, news was received that <em>Star Trek: Enterprise</em> had been cancelled by <a href="UPN" class="uri" title="wikilink">UPN</a> as of the end of the series, which meant that &quot;In a Mirror, Darkly&quot; would be episodes 94 and 95 of <em>Enterprise</em>{{'s}} 98 episode run.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> &quot;In a Mirror, Darkly&quot; was Sussman's final contribution to the show, he had previously been a staff writer on <em><a href="Star_Trek:_Voyager" title="wikilink">Star Trek: Voyager</a></em> and worked in the <em>Star Trek</em> franchise for ten years. He later described it as his favourite episode of <em>Star Trek</em>, he said that &quot;I knew when I was writing them that they would almost certainly be the last episodes I would be writing for this particular incarnation of Star Trek, so I really treasured the experience.&quot;<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> Part of Manny Coto's plans for series five of <em>Enterprise</em> would have included a return to the mirror universe crew first seen in &quot;In a Mirror, Darkly&quot;.

<h3 id="visual-effects-and-costuming">Visual effects and costuming</h3>
<p>The opening sequence featured the re-use of footage from <em>Star Trek: First Contact</em>, where Zefram Cochrane makes first contact with the Vulcans, for which both James Cromwell and <a href="Cully_Fredricksen" title="wikilink">Cully Fredricksen</a> agreed to accept <a href="Screen_Actors_Guild" title="wikilink">Screen Actors Guild</a> minimum salaries. <a href="Herman_Zimmerman" title="wikilink">Herman Zimmerman</a> had kept the lower portion of the Vulcan vessel from that scene, and made it available to use for re-shoots.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> While <em>Enterprise</em> was normally shot in digital, the mirror-<em>First Contact</em> scenes were shot on film so that they would match the appearance of the original footage.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> An alternative opening credits sequence was created, which Sussman credited Coto for. It included footage used in other <a href="Paramount_Pictures" title="wikilink">Paramount Pictures</a> productions including <em>Konovalov</em> firing a <a href="torpedo" class="uri" title="wikilink">torpedo</a> from <em><a href="The_Hunt_for_Red_October_(film)" title="wikilink">The Hunt for Red October</a></em>.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> Other elements include an atomic explosion, battleships, tanks and fighter jets.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
<p>Zimmerman led the construction of a full three-quarters around set to represent the bridge of the USS <em>Defiant</em>, which was used from the final day of filming the first part of this episode. It was the first time that a bridge set of that scale from a Constitution-class starship from <em>The Original Series</em> had been used since the final episode &quot;<a href="Turnabout_Intruder" title="wikilink">Turnabout Intruder</a>&quot; was aired in 1969. Senior illustrator <a href="Doug_Drexler" title="wikilink">Doug Drexler</a> was involved in the design; he had previously worked on the research that went into re-creating parts of <em>The Original Series</em> era <a href="USS_Enterprise_(NCC-1701)" title="wikilink">USS <em>Enterprise</em></a> for the <em><a href="Star_Trek:_Deep_Space_Nine" title="wikilink">Star Trek: Deep Space Nine</a></em> episode &quot;<a href="Trials_and_Tribble-ations" title="wikilink">Trials and Tribble-ations</a>&quot;, as well as a set which was exhibited in <a href="Hyde_Park,_London" title="wikilink">Hyde Park</a> in London. Other designers included in the creation of the set were <a href="Ahna_Packard" title="wikilink">Ahna Packard</a>, <a href="Mike_Okuda" title="wikilink">Mike Okuda</a> and <a href="James_Van_Over" title="wikilink">James Van Over</a>.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> The actual construction of the set was in the hands of Tom Arp and his team.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> Sussman said of the set, &quot;I think the bridge set is remarkable. I hope fans will be thrilled to see that set again in all of its glory.

In the <em>Star Trek: The Next Generation</em> episode &quot;<a href="Relics_(Star_Trek:_The_Next_Generation)" title="wikilink">Relics</a>&quot;, only the engineering console was reconstructed, with the Captain's chair and the navigation consoles rented from a fan and the remaining consoles were edited in digitally using <a href="Chroma_key" title="wikilink">blue screens</a>.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> Incomplete sets were also recreated for the <em>Deep Space Nine</em> episode &quot;Trials and Tribble-ations&quot;, but these involved digitally inserting the actors into previous footage of <em>The Original Series</em> and so a full bridge set was not re-created.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a></p>
<p>Further sets for the <em>Defiant</em> were created for the second part of the episode, which included designs previously used in &quot;Trials and Tribble-ations&quot; for the <a href="Jefferies_tube" title="wikilink">Jefferies tube</a>. The other sets included the Rec Room, Captain's quarters and the briefing room. Classic <em>Original Series</em> style uniforms were worn by some the main cast in the second episode, although as each vessel of that era had a slightly different Starfleet logo, one had to be designed for the Defiant as it hadn't previously been seen on screen.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> Bakula wore the wrap-around green uniform previously worn by Shatner in several episodes including &quot;<a href="The_Trouble_With_Tribbles" title="wikilink">The Trouble With Tribbles</a>&quot;, while Trineer, Keating and Montgomery donned <a href="Redshirt_(character)" title="wikilink">red shirts</a>.

The Gorn in particular required an actor in a tracking suit to allow the actors to interact with the character and give the animators something to overlay the <a href="Computer-generated_imagery" title="wikilink">CGI</a> on. Stunt coordinator <a href="Vince_Deadrick,_Jnr" title="wikilink">Vince Deadrick, Jnr</a> wore the suit for scenes that required movement, while David Anderson wore it for static shots.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> Sussman also wrote biographies for Archer and Hoshi that would briefly appear on screen.

This means that it was seen by 2 percent of all households, and 3 percent of all of those watching television at the time of the broadcast.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> This placed UPN fifth out of the major networks during the episode's hour of broadcast, ahead of <a href="The_WB_Television_Network" title="wikilink">The WB</a>. This was the only time during the primetime hours that UPN placed ahead of The WB.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> The second part aired the following week on April 29.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> Ratings were similar to the first episode, with another 2.0/3% score recorded, and again placing fifth during the timeslot ahead of The WB.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a></p>

<p>David Bianculli at the <em><a href="Daily_News_(New_York)" title="wikilink">Daily News</a></em> thought that &quot;In a Mirror, Darkly&quot; was the best episode of <em>Enterprise</em> so far and enjoyed that the actors could play against type for their characters. He gave the episode a score of three and a half out of four and said that the episode was so much fun that &quot;had they adopted this attitude from the start, &quot;Enterprise&quot; probably would still be flying missions next season.&quot;<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> When reviewing the first part of the episode for <a href="TrekNation" class="uri" title="wikilink">TrekNation</a>, Michelle Erica Green said that her favourite part of the episode was the modified opening sequence, and described it as &quot;fun and lighthearted in a twisted sort of way&quot; but thought that the closing episodes of the series would have been better if they had concentrated on the real crew and ship.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> She thought that the second episode saw the series &quot;stretching a clever idea too thin&quot;,<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> and that a &quot;one-hour 'Mirror' would have made more sense in terms of the pacing and for Enterprise as a whole.&quot;<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a></p>
<p>Jamahl Epsicokhan at his website &quot;Jammer's Reviews&quot; gave the first episode a score of three out of four,<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a> and the second part a score of two and a half.<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> He described it as an &quot;evil comic book&quot;,<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a> and regarding the first part, &quot;To call this episode over-the-top would be an understatement. This is a go-for-broke hour of lunatic madness.&quot;<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a> His view on the second part was that while the re-created sets were impressive, but &quot;it goes so far over the top that it comes back around and kicks itself in its own ass. It's overplayed, overacted, and over-goofy.&quot;<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a></p>
<p>&quot;In a Mirror, Darkly&quot; has been featured in several &quot;Best of&quot; episode lists. In 2009, it was ranked the best episode of <em>Star Trek: Enterprise</em> by James Hunt at the website <em><a href="Den_of_Geek" title="wikilink">Den of Geek</a></em>.<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a> He said that &quot;although the novelty value of seeing the cast playing cartoonishly evil versions of themselves is a good enough reason to watch this 2-parter, In a Mirror, Darkly manages to include some of <em>Enterprise</em>{{'s}} most inventive moments, not least the revised opening credits&quot;.<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a> <em><a href="Empire_(film_magazine)" title="wikilink">Empire</a></em> magazine ranked it the second best episode behind another final season episode, &quot;<a href="Terra_Prime" title="wikilink">Terra Prime</a>&quot;.<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a> Jay Garmon at <a href="TechRepublic" class="uri" title="wikilink">TechRepublic</a> ranked it as the fifth best episode, saying that the writers managed to include a &quot;gleefully malicious and fatal series of unexpected double-crosses, but also work in some of the most satisfying and coherent mythology gags that <em>Enterprise</em> ever displayed&quot;.<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="awards-and-nominations">Awards and nominations</h3>
<p>Laura Connolly, Roma Goddard and Michael Moore were nominated for an <a href="Emmy_Award" title="wikilink">Emmy Award</a> for Outstanding Hairstyling For A Series for their work on this episode.<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a><a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a> The award instead went to an episode of <em><a href="Deadwood_(TV_series)" title="wikilink">Deadwood</a></em>.<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a></p>
