Originally a <a href="Danish_monarchy" title="wikilink">Danish prince</a>, when only 17-years old he was elected as King by the Greek National Assembly, which had deposed the former King <a href="Otto_of_Greece" title="wikilink">Otto</a>. His nomination was both suggested and supported by the <a href="Great_Powers" title="wikilink">Great Powers</a> (<a href="United_Kingdom_of_Great_Britain_and_Ireland" title="wikilink">United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland</a>, <a href="Second_French_Empire" title="wikilink">Second French Empire</a> and the <a href="Russian_Empire" title="wikilink">Russian Empire</a>).</p>
<p>As the first monarch of the new Greek dynasty, his 50-year reign (the longest in <a href="History_of_modern_Greece" title="wikilink">modern Greek history</a>) was characterized by territorial gains as Greece established its place in pre-<a href="World_War_I" title="wikilink">World War I</a> Europe. Two weeks short of the fiftieth anniversary of his accession, and during the <a href="First_Balkan_War" title="wikilink">First Balkan War</a>, he was <a href="Assassination" title="wikilink">assassinated</a>. In sharp contrast to his reign, the reigns of his successors would prove short and insecure.</p>
<h2 id="family-and-early-life">Family and early life</h2>
<p>He was born in <a href="Copenhagen" class="uri" title="wikilink">Copenhagen</a>, the second son of <a href="Christian_IX_of_Denmark" title="wikilink">King Christian IX of Denmark</a> and <a href="Louise_of_Hesse-Kassel" title="wikilink">Louise of Hesse-Kassel</a>.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> Until his accession in Greece, he was known as Prince Vilhelm (William), the namesake of his paternal and maternal grandfathers.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>His paternal grandparents were <a href="Friedrich_Wilhelm,_Duke_of_Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Gl&lt;U+00FC&gt;cksburg" title="wikilink">Friedrich Wilhelm, Duke of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Gl&lt;U+00FC&gt;cksburg</a> and <a href="Louise_Caroline_of_Hesse-Kassel" title="wikilink">Louise Caroline of Hesse-Kassel</a>. His maternal grandparents were <a href="Prince_William_of_Hesse" title="wikilink">Prince William of Hesse</a> and <a href="Princess_Louise_Charlotte_of_Denmark" title="wikilink">Princess Louise Charlotte of Denmark</a>.</p>
<p>He was a younger brother of <a href="Frederick_VIII_of_Denmark" title="wikilink">Frederick VIII of Denmark</a> and <a href="Alexandra_of_Denmark" title="wikilink">Alexandra of Denmark</a> (<a href="Queen_consort" title="wikilink">Queen consort</a> of <a href="Edward_VII_of_the_United_Kingdom" title="wikilink">King Edward VII of the United Kingdom</a>). He was also an older brother of <a href="Maria_Feodorovna_(Dagmar_of_Denmark)" title="wikilink">Maria Fyodorovna</a>, consort of <a href="Alexander_III_of_Russia" title="wikilink">Alexander III of Russia</a>, <a href="Princess_Thyra_of_Denmark" title="wikilink">Princess Thyra of Denmark</a> (wife to <a href="Prince_Ernest_Augustus,_3rd_Duke_of_Cumberland_and_Teviotdale" title="wikilink">Prince Ernest Augustus, 3rd Duke of Cumberland and Teviotdale</a>) and <a href="Prince_Valdemar_of_Denmark" title="wikilink">Prince Valdemar of Denmark</a>.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>He began his career in the <a href="Royal_Danish_Navy" title="wikilink">Royal Danish Navy</a>, and was elected King of the Hellenes on <a href="March_18" title="wikilink">March 18</a> (<a href="Julian_calendar" title="wikilink">Julian calendar</a>)/<a href="March_30" title="wikilink">March 30</a> (<a href="Gregorian_calendar" title="wikilink">Gregorian calendar</a>), <a href="1863" class="uri" title="wikilink">1863</a> following the deposition of King <a href="Otto_of_Greece" title="wikilink">Otto</a>. Ironically, he ascended a royal throne before his father.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> His father would not rise to the Danish throne until <a href="November_15" title="wikilink">November 15</a>, 1863.</p>
<p>George was part of a group of European royals of his day descended from several <a href="Byzantine_Empire" title="wikilink">Byzantine Emperors</a>; see <a href="Byzantine_descent_of_Danish_royals_of_Greece" title="wikilink">Byzantine descent of Danish royals of Greece</a>.</p>
<h2 id="another-candidate-for-the-crown">Another candidate for the Crown</h2>
<p>George was not the first choice of the Greek people. Upon the overthrow of Otto,<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> the Greek people had rejected his brother <a href="Luitpold,_Prince_Regent_of_Bavaria" title="wikilink">Leopold</a>, the <a href="heir_presumptive" title="wikilink">heir presumptive</a>, while adhering to the concept of a monarchy.</p>
<p>Many Greeks seeking closer ties to the preeminent world power, <a href="United_Kingdom_of_Great_Britain_and_Ireland" title="wikilink">Great Britain</a>, rallied around <a href="Alfred,_Duke_of_Saxe-Coburg_and_Gotha" title="wikilink">Alfred, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha</a>, second son of <a href="Victoria_of_the_United_Kingdom" title="wikilink">Victoria of the United Kingdom</a> and <a href="Albert,_Prince_Consort" title="wikilink">Albert, Prince Consort</a>.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> British Foreign Minister <a href="Henry_Temple,_3rd_Viscount_Palmerston" title="wikilink">Henry Temple, 3rd Viscount Palmerston</a> believed that the Greeks were &quot;panting for increase in territory&quot;,<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> hoping for a gift of the <a href="Ionian_Islands" title="wikilink">Ionian Islands</a>. The <a href="London_Conference_of_1832" title="wikilink">London Conference of 1832</a> prohibited any of the Great Powers' ruling families from accepting the crown, and, in any event, Queen Victoria was adamantly opposed. The Greeks nevertheless insisted on holding a plebiscite in which over 95% of the 240,000 votes went for Prince Alfred.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> There were 93 votes for a Republic and 6 for a Greek.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> King Otto received one vote.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<p>Eventually the Greeks and Great Powers winnowed their choice to Prince William of Denmark. There were two significant differences from the elevation of his predecessor: he was elected unanimously by the Greek Assembly, rather than imposed on the people by foreign powers and he was proclaimed 'King of the Hellenes' instead of King of Greece.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<p>At his enthronement in <a href="Copenhagen" class="uri" title="wikilink">Copenhagen</a> attended by a delegation of Greeks led by First Admiral and Prime Minister <a href="Constantine_Kanaris" title="wikilink">Constantine Kanaris</a> it was announced that the British government would cede the <a href="Ionian_Islands" title="wikilink">Ionian Islands</a> to Greece in honor of the new monarch.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="early-reign-1863-1870">Early reign (1863-1870)</h2>
<p>The new seventeen-year old king arrived in <a href="Athens" class="uri" title="wikilink">Athens</a> on <a href="18_October" title="wikilink">18 October</a> (<a href="Julian_calendar" title="wikilink">Julian calendar</a>)/<a href="30_October" title="wikilink">30 October</a> (<a href="Gregorian_calendar" title="wikilink">Gregorian calendar</a>), <a href="1863" class="uri" title="wikilink">1863</a>.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> He was determined not to make the mistakes of his predecessor, so he quickly learned <a href="Greek_language" title="wikilink">Greek</a> in addition to his native <a href="Danish_language" title="wikilink">Danish</a>. He adopted the motto, &quot;My strength is the love of my people.&quot; The new king was seen frequently and informally in the streets of Athens, where his predecessor had only appeared in pomp. King George found the palace in a state of disarray after the hasty departure of King Otto and took to putting it right and updating the 40 year old building. He also sought to ensure that he was not seen as too influenced by his Danish advisers, ultimately sending his uncle <a href="Julius_of_Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Gl&lt;U+00FC&gt;cksburg" title="wikilink">Julius of Glucksburg</a> back to Denmark with the words, &quot;I will not allow any interference with the conduct of my government.&quot;<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<p>Politically, the new king took steps to bring the protracted constitutional deliberations of the Assembly to conclusion. On <a href="October_19" title="wikilink">October 19</a>, <a href="1864" class="uri" title="wikilink">1864</a>, he sent a demand, countersigned by <a href="Constantine_Kanaris" title="wikilink">Constantine Kanaris</a>, to the Assembly explaining that he had accepted the crown on the understanding that a new constitution would be finalised, and that if it was not he would feel himself at &quot;perfect liberty to adopt such measures as the disappointment of my hopes may suggest.&quot;<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> It was unclear from the wording whether he meant to return to <a href="Denmark" class="uri" title="wikilink">Denmark</a> or impose a constitution, but as either event was undesirable the Assembly soon came to an agreement.</p>
<p>On <a href="November_28" title="wikilink">November 28</a>, <a href="1864" class="uri" title="wikilink">1864</a> he took the oath to defend the new <a href="Greek_Constitution_of_1864" title="wikilink">Constitution</a> which created a unicameral Assembly (<em>Vouli</em>) with representatives elected by direct, secret, universal male suffrage, a first in modern <a href="Europe" class="uri" title="wikilink">Europe</a>. A <a href="constitutional_monarchy" title="wikilink">constitutional monarchy</a> was set up with George always deferring to the legitimate authority of the elected officials whilst not unaware of the corruption present in elections, and the difficulty of ruling a mostly illiterate population.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> Between 1864 and 1910, there were twenty-one general elections and seventy different governments.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
<p>Maintaining a strong relationship with his brother-in-law, <a href="Edward_VII_of_the_United_Kingdom" title="wikilink">Edward, Prince of Wales</a> (eventually King Edward VII of the UK), King George sought his help in defusing the recurring issue of <a href="Crete" class="uri" title="wikilink">Crete</a>, an overwhelmingly Greek island which remained under <a href="Ottoman_Empire" title="wikilink">Ottoman</a> control. Since the reign of Otto, this desire to unite Greek lands in one nation had been a sore spot with <a href="Great_Britain" title="wikilink">Great Britain</a> and <a href="France" class="uri" title="wikilink">France</a>, which had embarrassed Otto by occupying the main port <a href="Piraeus" class="uri" title="wikilink">Piraeus</a> to dissuade Greek <a href="irredentism" class="uri" title="wikilink">irredentism</a> during the <a href="Crimean_War" title="wikilink">Crimean War</a>.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> When the Cretans rose in rebellion in 1866, the Prince of Wales sought the support of Foreign Secretary <a href="Edward_Stanley,_15th_Earl_of_Derby" title="wikilink">Edward Stanley, 15th Earl of Derby</a> in intervening in Crete on behalf of Greece.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> Ultimately, the Great Powers did not intervene and the Ottomans put down the rebellion.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>

<p>When alone with his wife, he usually conversed in <a href="German_language" title="wikilink">German</a>. Their children were taught <a href="English_language" title="wikilink">English</a> by their nannies, and when talking with his children he therefore spoke mainly English.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> Intent on not letting his subjects know of his missing his native land, he discreetly maintained a dairy at his palace at <a href="Tatoi" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tatoi</a>, which was managed by his former countrymen from Denmark as a bucolic reminder of his homeland.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> Queen Olga was far less careful in her expression of apostasy from her native Russia, often visiting Russian ships at anchor in <a href="Piraeus" class="uri" title="wikilink">Piraeus</a> two or three times before they weighed anchor.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a></p>
<p>The king was related by marriage to the rulers of Great Britain, Russia and Prussia, maintaining a particularly strong attachment to the Prince and Princess of Wales, who visited Athens in 1869.

<p>From 1864 to 1874, Greece had 21 governments, the longest of which lasted a year and a half.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> In July 1874, <a href="Charilaos_Trikoupis" title="wikilink">Charilaos Trikoupis</a> wrote an anonymous article in the newspaper <em>Kairoi</em> blaming King George and his advisors for the continuing political crisis caused by the lack of stable governments. In the article he accused the King of acting like an <a href="absolute_monarch" title="wikilink">absolute monarch</a> by imposing <a href="minority_government" title="wikilink">minority governments</a> on the people. If the King insisted, he argued, that only a politician commanding a majority in the <em>Vouli</em> could be appointed Prime Minister, then politicians would be forced to work together more harmoniously in order to construct a coalition government. Such a plan, he wrote, would end the political instability and reduce the large number of smaller parties. Trikoupis admitting to writing the article, after the supposed author was arrested, whereupon he himself was taken into custody. After a public outcry he was released and subsequently acquitted of the charge of &quot;undermining the constitutional order.&quot; The following year the King asked Trikoupis to form a government (ironically without a majority) and then read a speech from the throne declaring that in future the leader of the majority party in parliament would be appointed Prime Minister.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a></p>
<p>Throughout the <a href="1870s" class="uri" title="wikilink">1870s</a>, Greece kept pressure on the Ottoman Empire seeking territorial expansion into <a href="Epirus" class="uri" title="wikilink">Epirus</a> and <a href="Thessaly" class="uri" title="wikilink">Thessaly</a>. The <a href="Russo-Turkish_War_(1877&lt;U+2013&gt;1878)" title="wikilink">Russo-Turkish War</a> of 1877-1878 provided the first potential alliance for the Greek kingdom.

The next opportunity arose when in 1885 <a href="Bulgaria" title="wikilink">Bulgarians</a> rose in revolt of their Turkish overlords and declared themselves independent. Deliyannis rode to victory over Trikoupis in elections that year saying that if the Bulgarians could defy the <a href="Treaty_of_Berlin" title="wikilink">Treaty of Berlin</a>, so should the Greeks.</p>
<p>Deliyannis mobilized the <a href="Hellenic_Army" title="wikilink">Hellenic Army</a> and the British <a href="Royal_Navy" title="wikilink">Royal Navy</a> blockaded Greece. Ironically, the Admiral in charge of the blockade was <a href="Alfred,_Duke_of_Saxe-Coburg_and_Gotha" title="wikilink">Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh</a> who had been the first choice of the Greeks to be their king in 1863,<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> and the <a href="First_Lord_of_the_Admiralty" title="wikilink">First Lord of the Admiralty</a> at the time was <a href="George_Robinson,_1st_Marquess_of_Ripon" title="wikilink">George Robinson, 1st Marquess of Ripon</a> whose brother-in-law had been murdered in Greece 16 years before.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> This was not the last time that King George would discover that his family ties would not always be to his advantage. Deliyannis was forced to demobilize and Trikoupis regained the premiership. Between 1882 and 1897, Trikoupis and Deliyannis would alternate the premiership as their fortunes rose and fell.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a></p>

<p>Greece in the last decades of the <a href="19th_century" title="wikilink">19th century</a> was increasingly prosperous and developing a sense of its role on the European stage. In 1893, the <a href="Corinth_Canal" title="wikilink">Corinth Canal</a> was built by a French company cutting the sea journey from the Adriatic to <a href="Piraeus" class="uri" title="wikilink">Piraeus</a> by 150 miles. In 1896, the <a href="Olympic_Games" title="wikilink">Olympic Games</a> were revived in Athens and the Opening Ceremony of the <a href="1896_Summer_Olympics" title="wikilink">1896 Summer Olympics</a> was presided over by the King. When <a href="Spiridon_Louis" title="wikilink">Spiridon Louis</a>, a shepherd from just outside Athens, ran into the <a href="Panathinaiko" class="uri" title="wikilink">Panathinaiko</a> Stadium to win the Marathon event, the Crown Prince ran down onto the field to run the last thousand yards beside the Greek gold medalist, while the King stood and applauded.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a></p>
<p>The popular desire to unite all Greeks within the territory of their kingdom (<a href="Megali_Idea" title="wikilink">Megali Idea</a>) was never far below the surface and another revolt against Turkish rule in Crete erupted again. In February 1897, King George sent his son, <a href="Prince_George_of_Greece" title="wikilink">Prince George</a> to take possession of Crete.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a><a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> The Greeks refused an Ottoman offer of an autonomous administration and Deliyannis mobilized for war.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> The Great Powers refused the expansion of Greece and on <a href="February_25" title="wikilink">February 25</a>, <a href="1897" class="uri" title="wikilink">1897</a>, announced that Crete would be under an autonomous administration and ordered the Greek and Ottoman Turk militias to withdraw.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a></p>
<p>The Turks agreed, but Prime Minister Deliyannis refused and dispatched 1400 troops to Crete under the command of Colonel Timoleon Vassos. Whilst the Great Powers announced a blockade, Greek troops crossed the <a href="Macedonian" class="uri" title="wikilink">Macedonian</a> border and <a href="Abdul_Hamid_II" title="wikilink">Abdul Hamid II</a> declared <a href="Greco-Turkish_War_(1897)" title="wikilink">war</a>. Announcement that Greece was finally at war with the Turks was greeted by delirious displays of patriotism and spontaneous parades in honor of the king in Athens. Volunteers by the thousands streamed north to join the forces under the command of <a href="Constantine_I_of_Greece" title="wikilink">Crown Prince Constantine</a>.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a></p>
<p>The war went badly for the ill-prepared Greeks, the only saving grace being the swiftness with which the Hellenic Army was overrun. By the end of April 1897, the war was lost. The worst consequences of defeat for the Greeks were mitigated by the intervention of the king's relatives in Britain and Russia; nevertheless, the Greeks were forced to give up Crete to international administration, and agree to minor territorial concessions in favor of the Turks and an indemnity of 4,000,000 Turkish pounds.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a></p>
<p>The jubilation with which Greeks had hailed their king at the beginning of the war was reversed in defeat. For a time, he considered abdication. It was not until the king faced down an assassination attempt in February 1898 with great bravery that his subjects again held their monarch in high esteem.</p>
<p>Later that year after continued unrest in Crete, which included the murder of the British vice-consul,<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> the Great Powers proposed making <a href="Prince_George_of_Greece" title="wikilink">Prince George of Greece</a> Governor-General of Crete under the suzerainty of the Sultan, thus effectively putting Greece in day-to-day control of Crete for the first time in modern history.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a></p>

<p>The death of Britain's Queen <a href="Victoria_of_the_United_Kingdom" title="wikilink">Victoria</a> on <a href="January_22" title="wikilink">January 22</a>, <a href="1901" class="uri" title="wikilink">1901</a>, left King George as the second-longest reigning monarch in Europe.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> His always-cordial relations with his brother-in-law, the new King <a href="Edward_VII_of_the_United_Kingdom" title="wikilink">Edward VII of the United Kingdom</a> continued to tie Greece to Britain. This was abundantly important in Britain's support of the King's son, George as Governor-General of Crete. Nevertheless, George resigned in 1906 after a leader in the Cretan Assembly, <a href="Eleftherios_Venizelos" title="wikilink">Eleftherios Venizelos</a> campaigned to have him removed.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a></p>
<p>As a response to the <a href="Young_Turk_Revolution" title="wikilink">Young Turk Revolution</a> of 1908, Venizelos&lt;U+2019&gt; power base was further strengthened and on <a href="8_October" title="wikilink">8 October</a> <a href="1908" class="uri" title="wikilink">1908</a> the Cretan Assembly passed a resolution in favour of union despite both the reservations of the Athens government under <a href="Georgios_Theotokis" title="wikilink">Georgios Theotokis</a><a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> and the objections of the Great Powers.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> The muted reaction of the Athens Government to the news from Crete led to an unsettled state of affairs on the mainland.</p>
<p>A group of military officers formed a military league <a href="Stratiotikos_Syndesmos" title="wikilink">Stratiotikos Syndesmos</a> that demanded that the Royal family be stripped of their military commissions. To save the king the embarrassment of removing his sons from their commissions, they resigned them. The military league attempted a <a href="coup_d&#39;&lt;U+00E9&gt;tat" title="wikilink">coup d'&lt;U+00E9&gt;tat</a> called the <a href="Goudi_Pronunciamento" title="wikilink">Goudi Pronunciamento</a> and the king insisted on supporting the duly elected <a href="Hellenic_Parliament" title="wikilink">Hellenic Parliament</a> in response. Eventually, the military league joined forces with Venizelos in calling for a National Assembly to revise the constitution. King George gave way and new elections to the revising assembly were held. After some political maneuvering, Venizelos became Prime Minister of a minority government. Just a month later, Venizelos called new elections at which he won a colossal majority after most of the opposition parties declined to take part.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a></p>
<p>Venizelos and the King were united in their belief that the nation required a strong army to repair the damage of the humiliating defeat of 1897. Crown Prince Constantine was reinstated as Inspector-General of the army,<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> and later Commander-in-Chief. Under his and Venizelos&lt;U+2019&gt; close supervision the military was retrained and equipped with French and British help and new ships ordered for the <a href="Hellenic_Navy" title="wikilink">Hellenic Navy</a>. Meanwhile, through diplomatic means, Venizelos had united the Christian countries of the Balkans in opposition to the ailing Ottoman Empire.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a></p>
<p>On <a href="October_8" title="wikilink">October 8</a>, <a href="1912" class="uri" title="wikilink">1912</a>, <a href="Montenegro" class="uri" title="wikilink">Montenegro</a> declared war on Turkey followed quickly, after ultimata, by <a href="Serbia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Serbia</a>, <a href="Bulgaria" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bulgaria</a> and Greece in what was known as the <a href="First_Balkan_War" title="wikilink">First Balkan War</a>. This campaign was the polar opposite of <a href="Greco-Turkish_War_(1897)" title="wikilink">1897</a>. The well-trained Greek forces, 200,000 strong, won victory after victory. On <a href="9_November" title="wikilink">9 November</a> <a href="1912" class="uri" title="wikilink">1912</a>, Greek forces rode into <a href="Salonika" class="uri" title="wikilink">Salonika</a>, just a few hours ahead of a Bulgarian division. Followed by the Crown Prince and Venizelos in a parade a few days later, King George rode in triumph through the streets of the second largest Greek city.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a></p>
<p>Just as he did in Athens, the King went about <a href="Salonika" class="uri" title="wikilink">Salonika</a> without any meaningful protection force. While out on an afternoon walk near the <a href="White_Tower_of_Thessaloniki" title="wikilink">White Tower of Thessaloniki</a> on <a href="March_18" title="wikilink">March 18</a> <a href="1913" class="uri" title="wikilink">1913</a>, he was shot at close range in the back by <a href="socialist" class="uri" title="wikilink">socialist</a>-<a href="anarchist" class="uri" title="wikilink">anarchist</a> <a href="psychopath" class="uri" title="wikilink">psychopath</a> <a href="Alexandros_Schinas" title="wikilink">Alexandros Schinas</a>.<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a> The Greek government denied any political motive for the assassination, saying that Schinas was an alcoholic vagrant.<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a> Schinas was tortured in prison<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a> and six weeks later fell to his death from a police station window.<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a></p>
<p>For five days, the coffin of the King draped in Danish and Greek flags lay in the <a href="Metropolitan_Cathedral_of_Athens" title="wikilink">Metropolis</a> in Athens before his body was committed to the tomb at his palace in <a href="Tatoi" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tatoi</a>.
