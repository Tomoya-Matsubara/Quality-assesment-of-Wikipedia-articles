<p>Set in 2016 in <a href="Los_Angeles" title="wikilink">Los Angeles</a>, it is an <a href="interquel" class="uri" title="wikilink">interquel</a> that takes place between the events of <em><a href="Terminator_3:_Rise_of_the_Machines" title="wikilink">Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines</a></em> and <em><a href="Terminator_Salvation" title="wikilink">Terminator Salvation</a></em> and follows <a href="John_Connor" title="wikilink">John Connor</a> (<a href="Gideon_Emery" title="wikilink">Gideon Emery</a>), and his team, consisting of Angie Salter (<a href="Rose_McGowan" title="wikilink">Rose McGowan</a>), Barnes (<a href="Common_(entertainer)" title="wikilink">Common</a>) and Blair Williams (<a href="Moon_Bloodgood" title="wikilink">Moon Bloodgood</a>).<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> However, <a href="Christian_Bale" title="wikilink">Christian Bale</a> refused to lend his voice and likeness for the game.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a><a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> Rose McGowan is in the game as well, voicing the game-exclusive character Angie Salter, who is an ex-high school teacher.

<h2 id="gameplay">Gameplay</h2>

<p><em>Terminator Salvation</em> is a <a href="third_person_shooter" title="wikilink">third person shooter</a> where the player needs to &quot;constantly move, flank, cover and utilize their squad to progress.&quot;<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> The player must battle Skynet enemies from the <a href="Terminator_Salvation" title="wikilink">film of the same name</a> as well as new enemies specifically designed for the game.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p>The game features a campaign that can be played alone or cooperatively with one other local player via split-screen. The co-op version of the game enables players to play as both John Connor and his teammate Blair Williams.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<p>The game employs a cover and movement system not unlike those featured in <em><a href="Gears_of_War" title="wikilink">Gears of War</a></em> and <em><a href="Brothers_in_Arms:_Hell&#39;s_Highway" title="wikilink">Brothers in Arms: Hell's Highway</a></em>, wherein the player can quickly choose to dodge between different forms of cover, coming out only to fire shots at enemies. Staying in cover is advantageous, as the player only regenerates health when they have not received damage for a certain amount of time (as in the <em><a href="Halo_(series)" title="wikilink">Halo</a></em> and <em><a href="Call_of_Duty" title="wikilink">Call of Duty</a></em> games). Although players initially are only equipped with an <a href="M4_carbine" title="wikilink">M4 carbine</a>, other weapons such as the <a href="RPG-7" class="uri" title="wikilink">RPG-7</a> and <a href="M79_grenade_launcher" title="wikilink">M79 grenade launcher</a>, <a href="Remington_870" title="wikilink">Remington 870</a> shotgun, and <a href="M249_SAW" title="wikilink">M249 SAW</a> as well as various types of grenades (Flash and fragmentation) are acquired throughout the game. Enemy A.I. is relatively strong, both keeping track of the player's location realistically (that is, not omniscient but using sight and sound to locate the player) as well as actively pursing and flanking them when cover is sought by the player.</p>
<h2 id="plot">Plot</h2>

<p>John Connor reflects on the old days of preparing for the future battle. Returning to an evac point with Blair Williams and other soldiers, they battle their way through machines to discover that there are no helicopters waiting for them. Escaping in trucks instead, the group are attacked by a Hunter-Killer aircraft. After John Connor manages to destroy the H-K, a T-600 appears and kills a member of his team.</p>
<p>The team travels underground, then above again, battling machines. The surviving trio manages to reach the evacuation point, meeting soldiers. Aerostat drones attack, and Connor, Williams, and others go outside to take care of them. One is killed in the battle. A Resistance team led by soldier David Weston (Sean Cory Cooper) asks for help, but his transmission is lost. The team then tries to make a landing place for a helicopter. The chopper lands and rescues the team, but Connor and Williams stay behind to rescue Weston's team. The duo goes into the sewers.</p>
<p>A rescue team, Epsilon, has a helicopter going down, so the duo goes to its crash-site to check for survivors. They rescue four soldiers, Angie (Rose McGowan), an unknown, Deckard (Joe Camareno) and Dobkin (<a href="Nolan_North" title="wikilink">Nolan North</a>). They fight a legion of machines and then, afterwards, decide to head for an old Resistance outpost. Deckard is killed by a T-600, and the team is forced to retreat. They manage to destroy two T-600s. The have no choice but to retreat, but with no way out, the team is forced to destroy the T-600s.</p>
<p>The three continue to go to Skynet while defending themselves. They decide to go to a tower so they can observe Skynet patrols so as to plan a route to rescue Weston. They encounter T-600s with rubber skin, which the trio destroy. Connor warns the other two about the T-850, which has real, vat-grown skin. They reach the tower, where they encounter a Hunter-Killer, but Connor, Williams and Angie manage to destroy it. There are too many machines on a nearby street that they planned to go down, so the three decide to go to Union Station at the subway, following all tracks to Skynet.</p>
<p>They traverse their way to a hidden survivalist camp. The survivalists seem to, at first, not trust them (because of the T-600s with skin), but they manage to gain their trust. They say they have not encountered Skynet for a long time. The leader, named Warren (Ed O' Ross), leads him to Barnes (Common), who will supply them. Machines come, and Connor, Williams and Barnes fight off the machines while Warren and Angie evacuate the area. Barnes reveals to Connor that machines actually come every two months. They destroy the machines with detonators, and everybody evacuates by train. Connor and Williams defend the train by missile laucher. They stop to rescue other people from machines and succeed. They escape, but the train derails, so they go on foot to a truck depot, meeting up with other soldiers. Warren drives a school bus, while Connor and Williams defend it, eventually saving the bus. They go their separate ways, but Warren says they can visit them anytime. Warren still has doubts of their plan, saying that they could not communicate as long as a Skynet communications tower still stands. Barnes joins the three, saying he's tired of running and wishes to join the Resistance.</p>
<p>Battling numerous machines to infiltrate the Skynet compound, an alarm is accidentally triggered when Connor steals important documents. While Barnes sets up explosives, Connor, Angie and Blair hold off T-600s and T-7-Ts. While the explosives go off, they run into the elevator to escape. However, with the control panel located outside, Angie sacrifices herself so that Connor and the others can return to the surface. John is racked with guilt, but Blair explains that he had helped Angie fight, and she believed he could help humanity win.</p>
<p>Connor is fixing what appears to be a vehicle. He calls his base (answered by teammate Linda (Lupe)), saying he needs airpower to rescue Weston's team. Linda says it is going to be a problem, because of a harvester. &quot;That won't be a problem,&quot; Connor says, because Connor reprogrammed a Hunter-Killer tank, and programmed it to go straight to Skynet. He does not have control of the guns, though. Warren's team returns, and apologizes.</p>
<p>They first have to locate and destroy Skynet's anti-aircraft turrets. They destroy four areas of turrets and machines, but the tank took too much damage. Connor suggests that they could deactivate them on foot. Connor, Williams and Barnes are joined by three men to deactivate the turrets and to find Weston's men. Warren and the others cover Connor by destroying as many machines as possible.</p>
<p>They traverse Skynet and destroy all machines that they encounter, until they find Weston and his men. Warren's men agree to escort them to the vehicles, while Connor, Williams, Weston and Barnes go through the service tunnels to deactivate the turrets.</p>
<p>The four try to make it to the control room. Connor shuts down the machines for a few minutes, enough time to get them out of Skynet. The four attempt to escape Skynet before they destroy the base. With the four of them safe, they all return to their Resistance camp. Connor narrates, saying that he has gained faith by what he is about to create in the future, instead of the past.</p>
<h2 id="development">Development</h2>
<p>The game was first announced on November 15, 2007, when the Halcyon Company also announced the formation of Halcyon Games, the video game arm of the studio. It had already been in development for several months at GRIN and Halcyon Games, long before filming took place. Peter Levin, a former <a href="The_Walt_Disney_Company" title="wikilink">Disney</a> executive, will head up Halcyon Games as acting CEO. The CEO revealed that Halcyon decided to develop the game internally rather than contract another studio to create the game.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<p>Although a multiplayer mode was originally planned it was decidedly dropped to allow the game to be released on schedule. With Halcyon developments' VP Cos Lazouras stating &quot;It is my opinion to do less better, than more but mediocre. We did get local co-op in which is incredibly cool.&quot;<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>

<h2 id="reception">Reception</h2>

<p><em>Terminator Salvation</em> received mixed to negative reviews from critics. Game rankings gave the Xbox 360 version a 55.67%, the PS3 version a 51%, and the Windows version a 50%. <a href="GameSpot" class="uri" title="wikilink">GameSpot</a> reviewer Chris Watters rated it a 5 out of 10 citing the repetitive combat, mediocre visuals, short length, and that the lead actor of the movie, Christian Bale, did not do the voice acting for the game's John Connor.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> Hilary Goldstein of <a href="IGN" class="uri" title="wikilink">IGN</a> gave it a 6.3 out 10 for its passable visuals, good ally <a href="Artificial_intelligence" title="wikilink">A.I.</a>, and complete lack of replay value.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> He also criticized it because Bale's voice was missing. In the video review, IGN didn't like Bale not voicing or the short game, but liked the enemy A.I. and the cover system. Justin Haywald, a reviewer for 1up.com, rated it a D+ noting the lackluster visuals, the repetitive combat, and bland plot. Will Herring, a reviewer for Gamepro, awarded the game 2 out of 5 stars for its &quot;repetitive levels, incredibly frustrating health system, and mundane gameplay.&quot; X-play gave it a 2 out of 5. It ended up getting very high rental revenue from its infamously easy 'trophies' and 'achievements' for the PS3 and Xbox 360 versions.</p>
