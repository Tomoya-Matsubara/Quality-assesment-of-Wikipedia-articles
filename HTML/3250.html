<h2 id="production-history">Production history</h2>
<p>Farrell used <a href="Fort_Strong" title="wikilink">Fort Strong</a>, an abandoned post Civil War-era fort on <a href="Long_Island,_Boston" title="wikilink">Long Island</a> (an island in <a href="Boston_Harbor" title="wikilink">Boston Harbor</a>), as the location for this production. The fort lacked electricity and Farrell's production used torchlight to illuminate the scenes that were set inside the structure<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>Production took place between March and September 1987. However, the film went over its original $50,000 budget and Farrell was unable to secure financing to complete the production. As Farrell recalled in the book <em>The Encyclopedia of Underground Movies</em>: &quot;The original intent with <em>Richard the Second</em> was to shoot in broadcast 1&quot; format and transfer to 35mm. We shot with an Ikekami camera and used Sony reel-to-reel. I even did a test trailer in the edit suite which sent to a place in <a href="Los_Angeles" title="wikilink">Los Angeles</a> called Image Transform, which sent us back the trailer on 35 - this was when laser transfer was the new thing for video to film (no scan lines!).&quot;<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>The film was given a direct-to-video release in 2001.</p>
