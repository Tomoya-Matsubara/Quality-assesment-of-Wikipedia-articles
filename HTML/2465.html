<p><strong>Nathaniel Parker Willis</strong> (January 20, 1806 &lt;U+2013&gt; January 20, 1867), also known as <strong>N. P. Willis</strong>,<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> was an American <a href="author" class="uri" title="wikilink">author</a>, <a href="poet" class="uri" title="wikilink">poet</a> and <a href="editing" title="wikilink">editor</a> who worked with several notable American writers including <a href="Edgar_Allan_Poe" title="wikilink">Edgar Allan Poe</a> and <a href="Henry_Wadsworth_Longfellow" title="wikilink">Henry Wadsworth Longfellow</a>. He became the highest-paid magazine writer of his day. For a time, he was the employer of former slave and future writer <a href="Harriet_Jacobs" title="wikilink">Harriet Jacobs</a>. His brother was the composer <a href="Richard_Storrs_Willis" title="wikilink">Richard Storrs Willis</a> and his sister wrote under the name <a href="Fanny_Fern" title="wikilink">Fanny Fern</a>.</p>
<p>Born in <a href="Portland,_Maine" title="wikilink">Portland, Maine</a>, Willis came from a family of publishers. His grandfather <a href="Nathaniel_Willis_(1755&lt;U+2013&gt;1831)" title="wikilink">Nathaniel Willis</a> owned newspapers in Massachusetts and Virginia, and his father <a href="Nathaniel_Willis_(1780&lt;U+2013&gt;1870)" title="wikilink">Nathaniel Willis</a> was the founder of <em><a href="Youth&#39;s_Companion" title="wikilink">Youth's Companion</a></em>, the first newspaper specifically for children. Willis developed an interest in literature while attending <a href="Yale_College" title="wikilink">Yale College</a> and began publishing poetry. After graduation, he worked as an overseas correspondent for the <em><a href="New_York_Mirror" title="wikilink">New York Mirror</a></em>. He eventually moved to New York and began to build his literary reputation. Working with multiple publications, he was earning about US$100 per article and between $5,000<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> and $10,000 per year.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> In 1846, he started his own publication, the <em>Home Journal</em>, which was eventually renamed <em><a href="Town_&amp;_Country_(magazine)" title="wikilink">Town &amp; Country</a></em>. Shortly after, Willis moved to a home on the <a href="Hudson_River" title="wikilink">Hudson River</a> where he lived a semi-retired life until his death in 1867.</p>
<p>Willis embedded his own personality into his writing and addressed his readers personally, specifically in his <a href="travel_writing" title="wikilink">travel writings</a>, so that his reputation was built in part because of his character. Critics, including his sister in her novel <em><a href="Ruth_Hall" title="wikilink">Ruth Hall</a></em>, occasionally described him as being effeminate and Europeanized. Willis also published several poems, tales, and a play. Despite his intense popularity for a time, at his death Willis was nearly forgotten.</p>

<p>Nathaniel Parker Willis was born on January 20, 1806, in Portland, Maine.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> His father Nathaniel Willis was a newspaper proprietor there and his grandfather owned newspapers in <a href="Boston,_Massachusetts" title="wikilink">Boston, Massachusetts</a> and western Virginia.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> His mother was Hannah Willis (<em>n&lt;U+00E9&gt;e</em> Parker) from <a href="Holliston,_Massachusetts" title="wikilink">Holliston, Massachusetts</a> and it was her husband's offer to edit the <em>Eastern Argus</em> in Maine that caused their move to Portland.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> Willis's younger sister was Sara Willis Parton, who would later become a writer under the <a href="pseudonym" class="uri" title="wikilink">pseudonym</a> <a href="Fanny_Fern" title="wikilink">Fanny Fern</a>. His brother, <a href="Richard_Storrs_Willis" title="wikilink">Richard Storrs Willis</a>, became a musician and music journalist known for writing the melody for &quot;<a href="It_Came_Upon_the_Midnight_Clear" title="wikilink">It Came Upon the Midnight Clear</a>&quot;.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> His other siblings were Lucy Douglas (born 1804), Louisa Harris (1807), Julia Dean (1809), Mary Perry (1813), Edward Payson (1816), and Ellen Holmes (1821).<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1816, the family moved to Boston, where Willis's father established the <em>Boston Recorder</em> and, nine years later, the <em><a href="Youth&#39;s_Companion" title="wikilink">Youth's Companion</a></em>,<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> the world's first newspaper for children.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> The elder Willis's emphasis on religious themes earned him the nickname &quot;Deacon&quot; Willis.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> After attending a Boston grammar school and <a href="Phillips_Academy" title="wikilink">Phillips Academy</a> at <a href="Andover,_Massachusetts" title="wikilink">Andover</a>, Nathaniel Parker Willis entered <a href="Yale_College" title="wikilink">Yale College</a> in October 1823<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> where he roomed with <a href="Horace_Bushnell" title="wikilink">Horace Bushnell</a>.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> Willis credited Bushnell with teaching him the proper technique for sharpening a razor by &quot;drawing it from heel to point both waysÂ ... the two cross frictions correct each other&quot;.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> At Yale, he further developed an interest in literature, often neglecting his other studies.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> He graduated in 1827<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> and spent time touring parts of the United States and Canada. In <a href="Montreal" class="uri" title="wikilink">Montreal</a>, he met <a href="Chester_Harding_(painter)" title="wikilink">Chester Harding</a>, with whom he would become a lifelong friend. Years later, Harding referred to Willis during this period as &quot;the 'lion' of the town&quot;.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> Willis began publishing poetry in his father's <em>Boston Periodical</em>, often using one of two literary personalities under the <a href="pen_name" title="wikilink">pen names</a> &quot;Roy&quot; (for religious subjects) and &quot;Cassius&quot; (for more secular topics).<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> The same year, Willis published a volume of poetical <em>Sketches</em>.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="literary-career">Literary career</h3>
<p>In the latter part of the 1820s, Willis began contributing more frequently to magazines and periodicals. In 1829, he served as editor for the <a href="gift_book" title="wikilink">gift book</a> <em><a href="The_Token_and_Atlantic_Souvenir" title="wikilink">The Token</a></em>, making him the only person to be editor in the book's 15-year history besides its founder, <a href="Samuel_Griswold_Goodrich" title="wikilink">Samuel Griswold Goodrich</a>.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> That year, Willis founded the <em>American Monthly Magazine</em>,<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> which began publishing in April 1829 until it was discontinued in August 1831.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> He blamed its failure on the &quot;tight purses of Boston culture&quot;<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> and moved to Europe to serve as foreign editor and correspondent of the <em><a href="New_York_Mirror" title="wikilink">New York Mirror</a></em>.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> In 1832, while in <a href="Florence,_Italy" title="wikilink">Florence, Italy</a>, he met <a href="Horatio_Greenough" title="wikilink">Horatio Greenough</a>, who sculpted a bust of the writer.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> Between 1832 and 1836, Willis contributed a series of letters for the <em>Mirror</em>, about half of which were later collected as <em>Pencillings by the Way</em>, printed in London in 1835.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> The romantic descriptions of scenes and modes of life in Europe sold well despite the then high price tag of $7 a copy.

<p>Despite this popularity, he was censured by some critics for indiscretion in reporting private conversations. At one point he fought a bloodless duel with Captain <a href="Frederick_Marryat" title="wikilink">Frederick Marryat</a>, then editor of the <em>Metropolitan Magazine</em>, after Willis sent a private letter of Marryat's to <a href="George_Pope_Morris" title="wikilink">George Pope Morris</a>, who had it printed.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> Still, in 1835 Willis was popular enough to introduce <a href="Henry_Wadsworth_Longfellow" title="wikilink">Henry Wadsworth Longfellow</a> to important literary figures in England, including <a href="Ada_Lovelace" title="wikilink">Ada Byron</a>, daughter of <a href="George_Gordon_Byron,_6th_Baron_Byron" title="wikilink">Lord Byron</a>.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a></p>
<p>While abroad, Willis wrote to a friend, &quot;I should like to marry in England&quot;.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> He soon married Mary Stace, daughter of General William Stace of <a href="Woolwich" class="uri" title="wikilink">Woolwich</a>, on October 1, 1835, after a month-long engagement.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> The couple took a two-week <a href="honeymoon" class="uri" title="wikilink">honeymoon</a> in <a href="Paris" class="uri" title="wikilink">Paris</a>.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> The couple moved to London where, in 1836, Willis met <a href="Charles_Dickens" title="wikilink">Charles Dickens</a>, who was working for the <em>Morning Chronicle</em> at the time.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1837, Willis and his wife returned to the United States<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> and settled at a small estate on <a href="Owego_(town),_New_York" title="wikilink">Owego Creek</a> in <a href="New_York" title="wikilink">New York</a>, just above its junction with the <a href="Susquehanna_River" title="wikilink">Susquehanna River</a>.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> He named the home Glenmary and the  rural setting inspired him to write <em>Letters from under a Bridge</em>.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> On October 20, 1838, Willis began a series of articles called &quot;A New Series of Letters from London&quot;, one of which suggested an illicit relationship between writer <a href="Letitia_Elizabeth_Landon" title="wikilink">Letitia Elizabeth Landon</a> and editor William Jordan. The article caused some scandal, for which Willis's publisher had to apologize.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a></p>
<p>On June 20, 1839, Willis's play <em>Tortesa, the Usurer</em> premiered in Philadelphia at the Walnut Street Theatre.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> <a href="Edgar_Allan_Poe" title="wikilink">Edgar Allan Poe</a> called it &quot;by far the best play from the pen of an American author&quot;.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> That year, he was also editor of the short-lived periodical <em>The Corsair</em>, for which he enlisted <a href="William_Makepeace_Thackery" title="wikilink">William Makepeace Thackery</a> to write short sketches of France.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> Another major work, <em>Two Ways of Dying for a Husband</em>, was published in England during a short visit there in 1839&lt;U+2013&gt;1840. Shortly after returning to the United States, his personal life was touched with grief when his first child was <a href="stillbirth" title="wikilink">stillborn</a> on December 4, 1840. He and Stace had a second daughter, Imogen, who was born June 20, 1842.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a></p>
<p>Later that year, Willis attended a ball in honor of Charles Dickens in New York. After dancing with Dickens's wife, Willis and Dickens went out for &quot;<a href="hot_toddy" title="wikilink">rum toddy</a> and broiled oysters&quot;.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> By this time, his fame had grown enough that he was often invited to lecture and recite poetry, including his presentation to the <a href="Linonian_Society" title="wikilink">Linonian Society</a> at Yale on August 17, 1841.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> Willis was invited to submit a column to the each weekly issue of <em>Brother Johnathan</em>, a publication from New York with 20,000 subscribers, which he did until September 1841.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> By 1842, Willis was earning the unusually high salary of $4,800 a year. As a later journalist remarked, this made Willis &quot;the first magazine writer who was tolerably well paid&quot;.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1842, Willis employed <a href="Harriet_Jacobs" title="wikilink">Harriet Jacobs</a>, an escaped slave from <a href="North_Carolina" title="wikilink">North Carolina</a>, as a house servant and nanny. When her owners sought to have her returned to their plantation,<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> Willis's wife bought her freedom for $300.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a> Nearly two decades later, Jacobs would write in her fictionalized autobiography <em><a href="Incidents_in_the_Life_of_a_Slave_Girl" title="wikilink">Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl</a></em>, which she began composing while working for the Willis family,<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a> that she &quot;was convinced thatÂ ... Nathaniel Parker Willis was proslavery&quot;.<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a> Willis is depicted as &quot;Mr. Bruce&quot;, an unattractive Southern sympathizer in the book.<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a> One of Willis's tales, &quot;The Night Funeral of a Slave&quot;, featured an abolitionist who visits the South and regrets his anti-slavery views; <a href="Frederick_Douglass" title="wikilink">Frederick Douglass</a> later used the work to criticize Northerners who were pro-slavery.<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a></p>

<p><img src="NPWillis1879-cropped.jpg" title="fig:Willis became the highest-paid magazine writer in America." alt="Willis became the highest-paid magazine writer in America." /> Returning to <a href="New_York_City" title="wikilink">New York City</a>, Willis reorganized, along with George Pope Morris, the weekly <em>New York Mirror</em> as the daily <em>Evening Mirror</em><a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a> in 1844 with a weekly supplement called the <em>Weekly Mirror</em>, in part due to the rising cost of <a href="mail" title="wikilink">postage</a>.<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a> By this time, Willis was a popular writer (a joke was that <a href="Johann_Wolfgang_von_Goethe" title="wikilink">Johann Wolfgang von Goethe</a> was Germany's version of N. P. Willis) and one of the first commercially successful magazine writers in America.<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a> In the fall of that year, he also became the first editor of the annual gift book <a href="The_Opal_(annual)" title="wikilink"><em>The Opal</em></a> founded by <a href="Rufus_Wilmot_Griswold" title="wikilink">Rufus Wilmot Griswold</a>.<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a> During this time, he became the highest-paid magazine writer in America, earning about $100 per article and $5,000 per year,<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a> a number which would soon double. Even the popular poet Longfellow admitted his jealousy of Willis's salary.<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a></p>
<p>As a critic, Willis did not believe in including discussions of personalities of writers when reviewing their works. He also believed that, though publications should discuss political topics, they should not express party opinions or choose sides.<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a> The <em>Mirror</em> flourished at a time when many publications were discontinuing. Its success was due to the shrewd management of Willis and Morris and the two demonstrated that the American public could support literary endeavors.<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a> Willis was becoming an expert in American literature and so, in 1845, Willis and Morris issued an <a href="anthology" class="uri" title="wikilink">anthology</a>, <em>The Prose and Poetry of America</em>.<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a></p>
<p>While Willis was editor of the <em>Evening Mirror</em>, its issue for January 29, 1845, included the first printing of Poe's poem &quot;<a href="The_Raven" title="wikilink">The Raven</a>&quot; with his name attached. In his introduction, Willis called it &quot;unsurpassed in English poetry for subtle conception, masterly ingenuity of versification, and consistent, sustaining of imaginative liftÂ ... It will stick to the memory of everybody who reads it&quot;.<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a> Willis and Poe were close friends, and Willis helped Poe financially during his wife <a href="Virginia_Eliza_Clemm_Poe" title="wikilink">Virginia's</a> illness and while Poe was suing <a href="Thomas_Dunn_English" title="wikilink">Thomas Dunn English</a> for <a href="slander_and_libel" title="wikilink">libel</a>.<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a> Willis often tried to persuade Poe to be less destructive in his criticism and concentrate on his poetry.<a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a> Even so, Willis published many pieces of what would later be referred to as &quot;The Longfellow War&quot;, a literary battle between Poe and the supporters of Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, whom Poe called overrated and guilty of <a href="plagiarism" class="uri" title="wikilink">plagiarism</a>.<a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a> Willis also introduced Poe to <a href="Frances_Sargent_Osgood" title="wikilink">Fanny Osgood</a>; the two would later carry out a very public literary flirtation.<a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a></p>
<p>Willis's wife Mary Stace died in childbirth on March 25, 1845. Their daughter, Blanche, died as well and Willis wrote in his notebook that she was &quot;an angel without fault or foible&quot;.<a href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a> He brought his surviving daughter Imogen to England to be with her mother's family<a href="#fn67" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a> and left her behind when he returned to the United States.<a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a> In October 1846, he married Cornelia Grinnell, a wealthy Quaker from New Bedford<a href="#fn69" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref69"><sup>69</sup></a> and the adopted daughter of a local Congressman.<a href="#fn70" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a> She was two decades younger than Willis at the time and vocally disliked slavery, unlike her new husband.<a href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a> After the marriage, Willis's daughter Imogen came to live with the newlyweds in New York.<a href="#fn72" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref72"><sup>72</sup></a></p>

<p>In 1846, Willis and Morris left the <em>Evening Mirror</em> and attempted to edit a new weekly, the <em>National Press</em>, which was renamed the <em>Home Journal</em> after eight months.<a href="#fn73" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref73"><sup>73</sup></a> Their prospectus for the publication, published November 21, 1846, announced their intentions to create a magazine &quot;to circle around the family table&quot;.<a href="#fn74" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref74"><sup>74</sup></a> Willis intended the magazine for the middle and lower classes and included the message of upward social mobility, using himself as an example, often describing in detail his personal possessions.<a href="#fn75" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref75"><sup>75</sup></a> When discussing his own social climbing, however, he emphasized his frustrations rather than his successes, endearing him to his audience.<a href="#fn76" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref76"><sup>76</sup></a> He edited the <em>Home Journal</em> until his death in 1867.

Willis worked closely with the architect, <a href="Calvert_Vaux" title="wikilink">Calvert Vaux</a>, to carefully plan each gable and piazza to fully take advantage of the dramatic view of the river and mountains.<a href="#fn82" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref82"><sup>82</sup></a></p>
<p>Because of failing health Willis spent the remainder of his life chiefly in retirement at Idlewild.

Griswold also wrote the first biography of Poe in which he purposely set out to ruin the dead author's reputation. Willis was one of the most vocal of Poe's defenders, writing at one point: &quot;The indictment (for it deserves no other name) is not true. It is full of cruel misrepresentations. It deepens the shadows unto unnatural darkness, and shuts out the rays of sunshines that ought to relieve them&quot;.<a href="#fn88" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref88"><sup>88</sup></a></p>
<p>Willis was involved in the 1850 <a href="divorce" class="uri" title="wikilink">divorce</a> suit between the actor <a href="Edwin_Forrest" title="wikilink">Edwin Forrest</a> and his wife Catherine.<a href="#fn89" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref89"><sup>89</sup></a> In January 1849, Forrest had found a <a href="love_letter" title="wikilink">love letter</a> to his wife from fellow actor <a href="George_W._Jamieson" title="wikilink">George W. Jamieson</a>.<a href="#fn90" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref90"><sup>90</sup></a> As a result, he and Catherine separated in April 1849.

<p>Willis defended Catharine, who maintained her innocence, in the <em>Home Journal</em> and suggested that Forrest was merely jealous of her intellectual superiority.<a href="#fn93" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref93"><sup>93</sup></a> On June 17, 1850, shortly after Forrest had filed for divorce in the New York Supreme Court,<a href="#fn94" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref94"><sup>94</sup></a> Forrest beat Willis with a <a href="gutta-percha" class="uri" title="wikilink">gutta-percha</a> <a href="whip" class="uri" title="wikilink">whip</a> in New York's <a href="Washington_Square_Park,_New_York" title="wikilink">Washington Square</a>, shouting &quot;this man is the seducer of my wife&quot;.<a href="#fn95" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref95"><sup>95</sup></a> Willis, who was recovering from a <a href="rheumatic_fever" title="wikilink">rheumatic fever</a> at the time, was unable to fight back.<a href="#fn96" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref96"><sup>96</sup></a> His wife soon received an anonymous letter with an accusation that Willis was in an adulterous relationship with Catherine Forrest.<a href="#fn97" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref97"><sup>97</sup></a> Willis later sued Forrest for assault and, by March 1852, was awarded $2,500 plus court costs.<a href="#fn98" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref98"><sup>98</sup></a> Throughout the Forrest divorce case, which lasted six weeks, several witnesses made additional claims that Catherine Forrest and Nathaniel Parker Willis were having an affair, including a waiter who claimed he had seen the couple &quot;lying on each other&quot;.<a href="#fn99" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref99"><sup>99</sup></a> As the press reported, &quot;thousands and thousands of the anxious public&quot; awaited the court's verdict; ultimately, the court sided with Catherine Forrest and Willis's name was cleared.<a href="#fn100" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref100"><sup>100</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="ruth-hall">Ruth Hall</h3>
<p>Willis arbitrarily refused to print the work of his sister Sara Willis (&quot;<a href="Fanny_Fern" title="wikilink">Fanny Fern</a>&quot;) after 1854,<a href="#fn101" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref101"><sup>101</sup></a> though she previously had contributed anonymous book reviews to the <em>Home Journal</em>.<a href="#fn102" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref102"><sup>102</sup></a> She had recently been widowed, became destitute, and was publicly denounced by her abusive second husband.<a href="#fn103" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref103"><sup>103</sup></a> Criticizing what he perceived as her restlessness, Willis once made her the subject of his poem &quot;To My Wild Sis&quot;.<a href="#fn104" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref104"><sup>104</sup></a> As Fanny Fern, she had published <em>Fern Leaves</em>, which sold over 100,000 copies the year before.<a href="#fn105" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref105"><sup>105</sup></a> Willis, however, did not encourage his sister's writings. &quot;You overstrain the pathetic, and your humor runs into dreadful vulgarity sometimesÂ ...

<p>Among his later works, following in his traditional sketches about his life and people he has met, were <em>Hurry-Graphs</em> (1851), <em>Out-Doors at Idlewild</em> (1854), and <em>Ragbag</em> (1855). Willis had complained that his magazine writing prevented him from writing a longer work. He finally had the time in 1856, and he wrote his only novel, <em>Paul Fane</em>, which was published a year later.<a href="#fn110" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref110"><sup>110</sup></a> The character Bosh Blivins, who served as <a href="comic_relief" title="wikilink">comic relief</a> in the novel, may have been based on painter Chester Harding.<a href="#fn111" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref111"><sup>111</sup></a> His final work was <em>The Convalescent</em> (1859), which included a chapter on his time spent with <a href="Washington_Irving" title="wikilink">Washington Irving</a> at <a href="Sunnyside_(Tarrytown,_New_York)" title="wikilink">Sunnyside</a>.<a href="#fn112" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref112"><sup>112</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="final-years-and-death">Final years and death</h3>
<p><img src="NPWillis-Grave.jpg" title="fig:Grave of Nathaniel Parker Willis" alt="Grave of Nathaniel Parker Willis" /> In July 1860, Willis took his last major trip.

<p>Willis was very sick in these final years: he suffered from violent <a href="epileptic_seizure" title="wikilink">epileptic seizures</a> and, early in November 1866, fainted in the streets, prompting Harriet Jacobs to return to help his wife.<a href="#fn117" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref117"><sup>117</sup></a> Willis died on his sixty-first birthday, January 20, 1867, and was buried in <a href="Mount_Auburn_Cemetery" title="wikilink">Mount Auburn Cemetery</a> in Cambridge, Massachusetts.<a href="#fn118" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref118"><sup>118</sup></a> Four days later, the day of his funeral, all bookstores in the city were closed as a token of respect.<a href="#fn119" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref119"><sup>119</sup></a> His pallbearers included Longfellow, <a href="James_Russell_Lowell" title="wikilink">James Russell Lowell</a>, <a href="Oliver_Wendell_Holmes,_Sr." title="wikilink">Oliver Wendell Holmes</a>, <a href="Samuel_Gridley_Howe" title="wikilink">Samuel Gridley Howe</a>, and <a href="James_Thomas_Fields" title="wikilink">James Thomas Fields</a>.<a href="#fn120" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref120"><sup>120</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="reputation">Reputation</h2>
<p><img src="NPWillis-1857.gif" title="fig:Daguerreotype of Willis, circa 1857" alt="Daguerreotype of Willis, circa 1857" /> Throughout his literary career, Willis was well liked and known for his good nature amongst friends. Well traveled and clever, he had a striking appearance at six feet tall and was typically dressed elegantly. Many, however, remarked that Willis was effeminate, Europeanized, and guilty of &quot;Miss Nancyism&quot;. One editor called him &quot;an impersonal passive verb&lt;U+2014&gt;a pronoun of the feminine gender&quot;.<a href="#fn121" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref121"><sup>121</sup></a> A contemporary <a href="caricature" class="uri" title="wikilink">caricature</a> depicted him wearing a fashionable beaver hat and tightly closed coat and carrying a cane, reflecting Willis's wide reputation as a &quot;<a href="dandy" class="uri" title="wikilink">dandy</a>&quot;.<a href="#fn122" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref122"><sup>122</sup></a> Willis put considerable effort into his appearance and his fashion sense, presenting himself as a member of an upcoming American aristocracy.<a href="#fn123" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref123"><sup>123</sup></a> As <a href="Oliver_Wendell_Holmes,_Sr." title="wikilink">Oliver Wendell Holmes, Sr.</a> once said, Willis was &quot;something between a remembrance of <a href="Alfred_Guillaume_Gabriel,_Count_D&#39;Orsay" title="wikilink">Count D'Orsay</a> and an anticipation of <a href="Oscar_Wilde" title="wikilink">Oscar Wilde</a>&quot;.<a href="#fn124" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref124"><sup>124</sup></a> Publisher <a href="Charles_Frederick_Briggs" title="wikilink">Charles Frederick Briggs</a> once wrote that &quot;Willis was too Willisy&quot;.<a href="#fn125" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref125"><sup>125</sup></a> He described his writings as the &quot;novelty and gossip of the hour&quot; and was not necessarily concerned about facts but with the &quot;material of conversation and speculation, which may be mere rumor, may be the truth&quot;.<a href="#fn126" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref126"><sup>126</sup></a> Willis's behavior in social groups annoyed fellow poet Henry Wadsworth Longfellow. &quot;He is too artificial&quot;, Longfellow wrote to his friend <a href="George_Washington_Greene" title="wikilink">George Washington Greene</a>. &quot;And his poetry has now lost one of its greatest charms for me&lt;U+2014&gt;its sincerity&quot;.<a href="#fn127" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref127"><sup>127</sup></a> E. Burke Fisher, a journalist in <a href="Pittsburgh" class="uri" title="wikilink">Pittsburgh</a>, wrote that &quot;Willis is a kind of national pet and we must regard his faults as we do those of a spoiled stripling, in the hope that he will amend&quot;.<a href="#fn128" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref128"><sup>128</sup></a></p>
<p>Willis built up his reputation in the public at a time when readers were interested in the personal lives of writers.<a href="#fn129" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref129"><sup>129</sup></a> In his writings, he described the &quot;high life&quot; of the &quot;<a href="Upper_ten_thousand" title="wikilink">Upper Ten Thousand</a>&quot;, a phrase he coined.<a href="#fn130" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref130"><sup>130</sup></a> His travel writings in particular were popular for this reason<a href="#fn131" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref131"><sup>131</sup></a> as Willis was actually living the life he was describing and recommending to readers.<a href="#fn132" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref132"><sup>132</sup></a> Even so, he manufactured a humble and modest persona, questioned his own literary merit, and purposely used titles, such as <em>Pencillings by the Way</em> and <em>Dashes at Life With Free Pencil</em>, which downplayed their own quality.<a href="#fn133" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref133"><sup>133</sup></a> His informally toned editorials, which covered a variety of topics, were also very successful.<a href="#fn134" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref134"><sup>134</sup></a> Using whimsicality and humor, he was purposely informal to allow his personality to show in his writing.<a href="#fn135" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref135"><sup>135</sup></a> He addressed his readers personally, as if having a private conversation with them. As he once wrote: &quot;We would have youÂ ... indulge us in our innocent egotism as if it were all whispered in your private ear and over our iced <em><a href="Margaux" class="uri" title="wikilink">Margaux</a></em>&quot;.<a href="#fn136" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref136"><sup>136</sup></a> When women poets were becoming popular in the 1850s, he emulated their style and focused on sentimental and moral subjects.<a href="#fn137" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref137"><sup>137</sup></a></p>
<p>In the publishing world, Willis was known as a shrewd magazinist and an innovator who focused on appealing to readers' special interests while still recognizing new talent.<a href="#fn138" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref138"><sup>138</sup></a> In fact, Willis became the standard by which other magazinists were judged. According to writer <a href="George_William_Curtis" title="wikilink">George William Curtis</a>, &quot;His gayety [sic] and his graceful fluency made him the first of our proper 'magazinists'&quot;.<a href="#fn139" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref139"><sup>139</sup></a> For a time, it was said that Willis was the &quot;most-talked-about author&quot; in the United States.<a href="#fn140" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref140"><sup>140</sup></a> Poe questioned Willis's fame, however. &quot;Willis is <em>no</em> genius&lt;U+2013&gt;a graceful trifler&lt;U+2013&gt;no more&quot;, he wrote in a letter to James Russell Lowell. &quot;In me, at least, he never excites an emotion.&quot;<a href="#fn141" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref141"><sup>141</sup></a> Minor Southern writer Joseph Beckham Cobb wrote: &quot;No sane person, we are persuaded, can read his poetry&quot;.<a href="#fn142" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref142"><sup>142</sup></a> Future senator <a href="Charles_Sumner" title="wikilink">Charles Sumner</a> reported: &quot;I find Willis is much laughed at for his sketches&quot;.<a href="#fn143" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref143"><sup>143</sup></a> Even so, most contemporaries recognized how prolific he was as a writer and how much time he put into all of his writings. <a href="James_Parton" title="wikilink">James Parton</a> said of him:  By 1850 and with the publication of <em>Hurry-Graphs</em>, Willis was becoming a forgotten celebrity. In August 1853, future <a href="President_of_the_United_States" title="wikilink">President</a> <a href="James_A._Garfield" title="wikilink">James A. Garfield</a> discussed Willis's declining popularity in his diary: &quot;Willis is said to be a <a href="wikt:licentious" title="wikilink">licentious</a> man, although an unrivaled poet. How strange that such men should go to ruin, when they might soar perpetually in the heaven of heavens&quot;.<a href="#fn144" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref144"><sup>144</sup></a> After Willis's death, obituaries reported that he had outlived his fame.<a href="#fn145" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref145"><sup>145</sup></a> One remarked, &quot;the man who withdraws from the whirling currents of active life is speedily forgotten&quot;.<a href="#fn146" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref146"><sup>146</sup></a> This obituary also stated that Americans &quot;will ever remember and cherish Nathaniel P.
