<p><strong>Ramses Wissa Wassef</strong> (1911&lt;U+2013&gt;1974) was an <a href="Egyptians" title="wikilink">Egyptian</a> architect and professor of art and <a href="architecture" class="uri" title="wikilink">architecture</a> at the College of Fine Arts in Cairo and founder of the Ramses Wissa Wassef Art Centre.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="biography">Biography</h2>
<p>Ramses Wissa Wassef was born in Cairo. His father was a lawyer, a leader of Egypt's nationalist movement and an art patron who promoted the development of the arts in Egypt. After high school, Wassef wanted to become a <a href="sculpture" title="wikilink">sculptor</a> but changed his mind and studied architecture in <a href="France" class="uri" title="wikilink">France</a> at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts de Paris. His thesis project &quot;A Potter's House in Old Cairo&quot; received the first prize in 1935. He had a passion for beauty in form and believed &quot;one cannot separate beauty from utility, the form from the material, the work from its function, man from his creative art &quot;<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>After Wassef's death, his family donated his original architecture drawings to the <a href="http://library.aucegypt.edu/rbscl/">Rare Books and Special Collections Library</a> at the <a href="American_University_in_Cairo" title="wikilink">American University in Cairo</a>.</p>
<h2 id="architectural-and-design-career">Architectural and design career</h2>
<p>At the beginning of his career in 1935, Wassef was struck by the beauty of the medieval towns and the old quarters of Cairo. He felt that ancient craftsmen had managed to derive from their traditional heritage an infinite variety of expression and created effects distinguished by local character. He developed an architectural style that bore the stamp of his own strong personality and responded to the challenge of the times without breaking away from the past. Impressed as he was by the beauty of the Nubian houses in the villages around Aswan, which still preserved the domes and vaults, inherited form the earliest Pharaonic dynasties, he resolved to maintain their presence in his own architectural work for reasons of aesthetics, climate and economics. He made use of traditional craftsmen such as stonecutters, traditional carpenters, glass blowers and potters who had inherited the techniques and traditions of the Egyptian vernacular heritage. Wassef taught architecture and art at the Department of Architecture, College of Fine Arts, Cairo, which he also chaired.</p>

Collection of The Children&#39;s Museum of Indianapolis." width="325" /> Wissa Wassef founded the <strong>Ramses Wissa Wassef Art Centre</strong> in 1951, located in the Harrania district of <a href="Giza" class="uri" title="wikilink">Giza</a>, near the <a href="Giza_pyramids" title="wikilink">Giza pyramids</a> in the <a href="Greater_Cairo" title="wikilink">Greater Cairo</a> region. He established it to teach young Egyptian villagers how to create art, including <a href="tapestry" title="wikilink">tapestries</a>. He believed that children are endowed with creative power and potential.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> Wissa Wassef wanted to prove that artistic creativity is innate in everyone, and regardless of deadening influences from mass-produced objects, it can flourish within supportive settings such as the Art Centre.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>The Ramses Wissa Wassef Art Centre won the <a href="Aga_Khan_Award_for_Architecture" title="wikilink">Aga Khan Award for Architecture</a> from the <a href="Aga_Khan_Development_Network" title="wikilink">Aga Khan Development Network</a> in 1983.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a><a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> The Art Centre is open to the public, with an <a href="art_museum" title="wikilink">art museum</a> exhibiting its early tapestry works, and a museum shop selling contemporary tapestry works by Art Centre artists. Tours are available, upon contacting the Art Centre in advance to schedule.</p>
<p>The Ramses Wissa Wassef Art Centre has operated continuously since opening in 1951, with its artists creating tapestries there for over 60 years. The Centre's artists create the designs and weave the tapestries directly from their imaginations onto the looms. Pre-designed patterns have never been used, proving Wissa Wassef's belief that artistic creativity is intrinsic, and can be expressed when a supportive context is available.</p>
<p>The renowned <a href="textile_artist" title="wikilink">textile artists</a> Ali Selim and Karima Ali, who began as children at the Centre in the 1960s and 1970s, continue to weave tapestry masterworks, now up to  in width.</p>
<h2 id="exhibitions">Exhibitions</h2>
<p>The tapestries have been internationally recognized since the late 1950s. Many exhibitions have been held in Europe and the Smithsonian Institution organized a traveling exhibit in the USA in 1975-76. The most recent exhibition was at the Coningsby Gallery in London, UK, during November 2012. A simple paperback catalog was published for the 2006 for an exhibition at the School of Oriental and African Studies in the <a href="University_of_London" title="wikilink">University of London</a> to mark the center's 50th anniversary.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> &quot;Egyptian Landscapes&quot; is a book of photographs that highlights the work of the center.</p>
