He later fought during the <a href="Irish_War_of_Independence" title="wikilink">Irish War of Independence</a>. He fought throughout most of the War, including at O'Connell Street.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> Shortly after the War, Edward Byrne was employed by Guinness' <a href="St._James&#39;s_Gate_Brewery" title="wikilink">St. James's Gate Brewery</a> where he worked for most of the rest of his life. He worked on the barges that operated on the river Liffey, transporting wooden casks from St. James's Gate Brewery to ships at the <a href="North_Wall_(Dublin)" title="wikilink">North Wall</a>, <a href="Dublin" class="uri" title="wikilink">Dublin</a>.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> Edward Byrne was the son of Alexander Byrne, a coachman to the <a href="Earl_of_Meath" title="wikilink">Earl of Meath</a>, who lived at a lodge on the Earl's estate near <a href="Kilruddery" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kilruddery</a>, <a href="County_Wicklow" title="wikilink">County Wicklow</a>.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
<p>Byrne's father, Edward, married his mother, Annie Carroll (from <a href="Bray" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bray</a>), at <a href="Belfast" class="uri" title="wikilink">Belfast</a>, in 1917, when briefly home on leave from the War. The two had met near Bray just before the War began. Gay Byrne is the youngest of six children from that marriage. However, one child, his brother Joseph, died as a one-week old infant. Listed in descending order (according to age), the other children are Edward, Al, Ernest, and Mary.</p>
<p>Byrne was born and grew up in Dublin. He was born 5 August 1934.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a><a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> He first lived with his family at 17 Rialto Street, <a href="Rialto_(Dublin)" title="wikilink">Rialto</a>, Dublin, before his parents moved to 124 (later renumbered 512) <a href="South_Circular_Road_(Dublin)" title="wikilink">South Circular Road</a>, Dublin, in 1944.</p>

<p>After attending Synge Street CBS he worked at the North Strand cinema. He subsequently became a clerk in an insurance company. He then worked as a sales representative. He also met foreign dignitaries at Dublin Airport and welcomed them to Ireland. In 2009, whilst celebrating the 250th anniversary of Guinness, he revealed that he had once tried unsuccessfully to earn a job in the brewery near his childhood home.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a></p>

<p>Whilst young, Byrne was inspired by the broadcaster <a href="Eamonn_Andrews" title="wikilink">Eamonn Andrews</a>, who had a successful career on British television, and &quot;wanted to be what he was&quot;.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> Andrews was friendly with Byrne's eldest brother.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> In 1958 he moved over to broadcasting when he became a presenter on <a href="Raidi&lt;U+00F3&gt;_Teilif&lt;U+00ED&gt;s_&lt;U+00C9&gt;ireann" title="wikilink">Radio &lt;U+00C9&gt;ireann</a>.

<h3 id="radio-career">Radio career</h3>

<p>Byrne began his broadcasting career on radio.</p>
<p>Radio &lt;U+00C9&gt;ireann gave him a 15-minute slot on Monday nights which he used to play <a href="Jazz" class="uri" title="wikilink">Jazz</a>, his first broadcast for the station being in 1958.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a></p>
<p>He is now best remembered for his two hour morning show, <em>The Gay Byrne Hour</em>, which was later renamed <em><a href="The_Gay_Byrne_Show" title="wikilink">The Gay Byrne Show</a></em> (1972–1999). For many years the show was produced by <a href="John_Caden" title="wikilink">John Caden</a>. <a href="Joe_Duffy" title="wikilink">Joe Duffy</a> was a reporter on <em>The Gay Byrne Show</em> and subsequently succeeded him as presenter.</p>

<h3 id="television-career">Television career</h3>
<h4 id="the-late-late-show"><em>The Late Late Show</em></h4>


<p>On 5 July 1962, the first episode of <em>The Late Late Show</em> was aired on Irish television.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> Originally the show was scheduled as an eight-week summer filler. The programme, which is still broadcast, has become the world's longest running <a href="Talk_show" title="wikilink">chat show</a>. The show became a forum where controversial topics such as the influence of the <a href="Roman_Catholic_Church" title="wikilink">Roman Catholic Church</a>, <a href="Birth_control" title="wikilink">contraception</a>,<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> <a href="AIDS" class="uri" title="wikilink">AIDS</a>, <a href="unemployment" class="uri" title="wikilink">unemployment</a>, <a href="homosexuality" class="uri" title="wikilink">homosexuality</a>,<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> <a href="abortion" class="uri" title="wikilink">abortion</a>, <a href="divorce" class="uri" title="wikilink">divorce</a>, and other hitherto <a href="taboo" class="uri" title="wikilink">taboo</a> subjects were discussed openly in Ireland, alongside book reviews, celebrity visits, and music acts like <a href="The_Boomtown_Rats" title="wikilink">The Boomtown Rats</a>, <a href="U2" class="uri" title="wikilink">U2</a>, <a href="Sin&lt;U+00E9&gt;ad_O&#39;Connor" title="wikilink">Sin&lt;U+00E9&gt;ad O'Connor</a>, <a href="Elkie_Brooks" title="wikilink">Elkie Brooks</a>, <a href="Boyzone" class="uri" title="wikilink">Boyzone</a>, and <a href="Noel_Gallagher" title="wikilink">Noel Gallagher</a>.

<p>The show had much to do in shaping the new Ireland that was emerging from the 1960s. Indeed it was famously said by politician and <a href="Papal_Orders_of_Chivalry" title="wikilink">Papal Knight</a>, <a href="Oliver_J._Flanagan" title="wikilink">Oliver J. Flanagan</a> that, &quot;there was no sex<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> in Ireland until Teilif&lt;U+00ED&gt;s &lt;U+00C9&gt;ireann went on the air&quot;.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> Bishop of Galway Michael Browne called him &quot;a purveyor of filth&quot; after he asked a woman what colour nightie she wore on her wedding night and she had replied that she believed she'd worn nothing.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a><a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> However, Byrne saw himself as a presenter, not a radical social reformer, though his style was more challenging and less deferential than the style of his successor as presenter of <em>The Late Late Show</em>, <a href="Pat_Kenny" title="wikilink">Pat Kenny</a>.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a></p>
<p>More than a decade after departing his role as host of <em>The Late Late Show</em> Byrne is remembered for conducting memorable interviews with former politician <a href="P&lt;U+00E1&gt;draig_Flynn" title="wikilink">P&lt;U+00E1&gt;draig Flynn</a> and then <a href="Roman_Catholic_Diocese_of_Galway,_Kilmacduagh_and_Kilfenora" title="wikilink">Bishop of Galway</a> <a href="Eamon_Casey" title="wikilink">Eamon Casey</a>{{'}}s lover Annie Murphy, among others.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> Another memorable moment to occur on <em>The Late Late Show</em> was when he called the winner of a prize car live on air only to discover the woman's daughter had died since she had entered.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a></p>
<p>During the early years of Byrne's time hosting <em>The Late Late Show</em>, prior to about 1978 when the second national Irish TV channel was launched, he was employed by RT&lt;U+00C9&gt; on a continuously renewing 3-month contract, lest his employer might want to fire him any time they choose.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a></p>
<p>Byrne and <em>The Late Late Show</em> were central to the development of the careers of figures such as <a href="Mary_Coughlan_(singer)" title="wikilink">Mary Coughlan</a>.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a></p>

<p>On 21 May 1999, Byrne presented his last edition of <em>The Late Late Show</em>. He was presented with a <a href="Harley-Davidson" class="uri" title="wikilink">Harley-Davidson</a> motorcycle by <a href="Bono" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bono</a> and <a href="Larry_Mullen,_Jr." title="wikilink">Larry Mullen, Jr.</a><a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> <a href="Pat_Kenny" title="wikilink">Pat Kenny</a> succeeded Byrne as presenter in September 1999, subsequently succeeded by <a href="Ryan_Tubridy" title="wikilink">Ryan Tubridy</a> in September 2009. He gave Tubridy his blessing upon taking over the role, saying: &quot;He has all the qualities required, the light deft touch together with a serious mind. I think it's a great adventure that he's setting off on&quot;.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> Byrne returned to <em>The Late Late Show</em> as a guest twice during Tubridy's <a href="The_Late_Late_Show_(season_47)" title="wikilink">first season</a> as presenter, the latter appearance on the day of <a href="Death_of_Gerry_Ryan" title="wikilink">Gerry Ryan's death</a>.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a><a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a></p>

<p>In August 2011, Byrne was approached<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a> by the once dominant political party <a href="Fianna_F&lt;U+00E1&gt;il" title="wikilink">Fianna F&lt;U+00E1&gt;il</a> as a possible independent nominee<a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a> for that year's Irish presidential election. The media advised Byrne, who having enjoyed an avuncular relationship with the public as a performer over many decades, editorialised against such a move.
