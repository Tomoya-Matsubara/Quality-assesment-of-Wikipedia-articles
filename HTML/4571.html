<p><strong>U2</strong> are a <a href="rock_music" title="wikilink">rock</a> band formed in <a href="Dublin" class="uri" title="wikilink">Dublin</a>, <a href="Republic_of_Ireland" title="wikilink">Ireland</a>. The band consists of <a href="Bono" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bono</a> (<a href="singing" title="wikilink">vocals</a> and <a href="guitar" class="uri" title="wikilink">guitar</a>), <a href="The_Edge" title="wikilink">The Edge</a> (guitar, <a href="keyboards" class="uri" title="wikilink">keyboards</a>, and vocals), <a href="Adam_Clayton" title="wikilink">Adam Clayton</a> (<a href="bass_guitar" title="wikilink">bass guitar</a>), and <a href="Larry_Mullen,_Jr." title="wikilink">Larry Mullen, Jr.</a> (<a href="Drum_kit" title="wikilink">drums</a> and <a href="percussion_instrument" title="wikilink">percussion</a>).</p>
<p>The band formed in 1976 when the members were teenagers with limited musical proficiency. By the mid-1980s, the band had become a top international act. Their success as a live act was greater than their success as a record selling act until their 1987 album <em><a href="The_Joshua_Tree" title="wikilink">The Joshua Tree</a></em>,<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> which according to <em><a href="Rolling_Stone" title="wikilink">Rolling Stone</a></em>, elevated the band's stature &quot;from heroes to superstars&quot;.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> U2 responded to the <a href="Electronic_dance_music" title="wikilink">dance</a> and <a href="alternative_rock" title="wikilink">alternative rock</a> revolutions and their own sense of musical stagnation by reinventing themselves with their 1991 album <em><a href="Achtung_Baby" title="wikilink">Achtung Baby</a></em> and the accompanying <a href="Zoo_TV_Tour" title="wikilink">Zoo TV Tour</a>. Since 2000, U2 have pursued a more conventional rock sound that retains the influence of their previous musical explorations.</p>

Seven teenage boys attended the initial practice in Mullen's kitchen. It was, as Mullen put it, &quot;'The Larry Mullen Band' for about ten minutes, then Bono walked in and blew any chance I had of being in charge.&quot; The group featured Mullen on drums, <a href="Bono" title="wikilink">Paul Hewson (Bono)</a> on lead vocals, <a href="The_Edge" title="wikilink">Dave Evans (The Edge)</a> and his brother <a href="Dik_Evans" title="wikilink">Dik Evans</a> on guitar, <a href="Adam_Clayton" title="wikilink">Adam Clayton</a>, a friend of the Evans brothers on bass guitar, and initially Ivan McCormick and Peter Martin, two other friends of Mullen.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> Soon after, the group settled on the name &quot;Feedback&quot;, because it was one of the few technical terms they knew.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> Martin did not return after the first practice, and McCormick left the group within a few weeks. Most of the group's material initially consisted of cover versions, which the band said was not their forte.

During a farewell concert in the <a href="Presbyterianism" title="wikilink">Presbyterian</a> Church Hall in <a href="Howth" class="uri" title="wikilink">Howth</a>, which featured The Hype playing covers, Dik ceremoniously walked offstage.

<p><em><a href="The_Unforgettable_Fire" title="wikilink">The Unforgettable Fire</a></em> was released in 1984.

<p>Stung by criticism of <em>Rattle and Hum</em>, the band made a calculated change in musical and thematic direction for their seventh studio album, <em><a href="Achtung_Baby" title="wikilink">Achtung Baby</a></em>; the change was their most dramatic since <em>The Unforgettable Fire</em>.<a href="#fn79" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref79"><sup>79</sup></a> The band began work on <em>Achtung Baby</em> in East Berlin in October 1990 with producers Daniel Lanois and Brian Eno, seeking inspiration and renewal on the eve of <a href="German_reunification" title="wikilink">German reunification</a>.<a href="#fn80" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref80"><sup>80</sup></a> The sessions instead proved to be difficult. In Berlin, conflict arose within the band over the quality of material and musical direction.

The extravagant shows were intentionally in contrast to the austere staging of previous U2 tours, and mocked the excesses of rock and roll by appearing to embrace these very excesses. The shows were, in part, U2's way to represent the pervasive nature of cable television and its blurring of news, entertainment, and home shopping.<a href="#fn85" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref85"><sup>85</sup></a> Prank phone calls were made to <a href="George_H._W._Bush" title="wikilink">President Bush</a>, the <a href="United_Nations" title="wikilink">United Nations</a>, and others.

Brian Eno, producer of three previous U2 albums, contributed as a full partner, including writing and performing. For this reason, and due to the record's highly experimental nature, the band chose to release it under the moniker &quot;Passengers&quot; to distinguish it from U2's conventional albums.

The investigation of loss and anguish coupled with hopefulness and resiliency, which is central to <em>The Joshua Tree</em>,<a href="#fn139" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref139"><sup>139</sup></a> has motivated much of U2's songwriting and music. Some of this lyrical ideation has been amplified by Bono and the band's personal experiences during their youth in Ireland, as well as Bono's campaigning and activism later in his life. U2 have used tours such as <a href="Zoo_TV_Tour" title="wikilink">Zoo TV</a> and <a href="PopMart_Tour" title="wikilink">PopMart</a> to caricature social trends, such as media overload and consumerism, respectively.<a href="#fn140" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref140"><sup>140</sup></a></p>
<p>While the band and its fans often affirm the political nature of their music, U2's lyrics and music have been criticized as apolitical because of their vagueness and &quot;fuzzy imagery&quot;, and a lack of any specific references to actual people or characters.<a href="#fn141" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref141"><sup>141</sup></a></p>

<p>Since the early 1980s, the members of U2&lt;U+2014&gt;as a band and individually&lt;U+2014&gt;have collaborated with other musicians, artists, celebrities, and politicians to address issues concerning poverty, disease, and social injustice.</p>
<p>In 1984, Bono and Adam Clayton participated in <a href="Band_Aid_(band)" title="wikilink">Band Aid</a> to raise money for <a href="Ethiopia" title="wikilink">Ethiopian</a> <a href="famine_relief" title="wikilink">famine relief</a>. The initiative produced the hit charity single &quot;<a href="Do_They_Know_It&#39;s_Christmas?" title="wikilink">Do They Know It's Christmas?</a>&quot;, which would be the first among several collaborations between U2 and <a href="Bob_Geldof" title="wikilink">Bob Geldof</a>. In July 1985, U2 played <a href="Live_Aid" title="wikilink">Live Aid</a>, a follow-up to Band Aid's efforts. Bono and his wife Ali, invited by <a href="World_Vision" title="wikilink">World Vision</a>, later visited Ethiopia where they witnessed the famine first hand. Bono would later say this laid the groundwork for his Africa campaigning and some of his songwriting.<a href="#fn160" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref160"><sup>160</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1986, U2 participated in the <a href="A_Conspiracy_of_Hope" title="wikilink">A Conspiracy of Hope</a> tour in support of <a href="Amnesty_International" title="wikilink">Amnesty International</a> and in <a href="Self_Aid" title="wikilink">Self Aid</a> for unemployment in Ireland. The same year, Bono and Ali Hewson also visited <a href="Nicaragua" class="uri" title="wikilink">Nicaragua</a> and <a href="El_Salvador" title="wikilink">El Salvador</a> at the invitation of the <a href="Sanctuary_movement" title="wikilink">Sanctuary movement</a>, and saw the effects of the <a href="Salvadoran_Civil_War" title="wikilink">El Salvador Civil War</a>. These 1986 events greatly influenced <em>The Joshua Tree</em> album, which was being recorded at the time.</p>
<p>In 1992, the band participated in the &quot;Stop <a href="Sellafield" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sellafield</a>&quot; concert with <a href="Greenpeace" class="uri" title="wikilink">Greenpeace</a> during their Zoo TV tour.<a href="#fn161" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref161"><sup>161</sup></a> Events in Sarajevo during the <a href="War_in_Bosnia_and_Herzegovina" title="wikilink">Bosnian war</a> inspired the song &quot;<a href="Miss_Sarajevo" title="wikilink">Miss Sarajevo</a>&quot;, which premiered at a September 1995 <a href="Luciano_Pavarotti" title="wikilink">Pavarotti</a> and Friends show, and which Bono and the Edge performed at <a href="War_Child_(charity)" title="wikilink">War Child</a>.<a href="#fn162" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref162"><sup>162</sup></a> A promise made in 1993 was kept when the band played in Sarajevo as part of 1997's PopMart Tour.<a href="#fn163" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref163"><sup>163</sup></a> In 1998, they performed in <a href="Belfast" class="uri" title="wikilink">Belfast</a> days prior to the vote on the <a href="Belfast_Agreement" title="wikilink">Good Friday Agreement</a>, bringing <a href="Northern_Ireland" title="wikilink">Northern Irish</a> political leaders <a href="David_Trimble,_Baron_Trimble" title="wikilink">David Trimble</a> and <a href="John_Hume" title="wikilink">John Hume</a> on stage to promote the agreement.<a href="#fn164" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref164"><sup>164</sup></a> Later that year, all proceeds from the release of the &quot;<a href="Sweetest_Thing" title="wikilink">Sweetest Thing</a>&quot; single went towards supporting the <a href="Chernobyl_Children&#39;s_Project_International" title="wikilink">Chernobyl Children's Project</a>.</p>
<p>In 2001, the band dedicated &quot;<a href="Walk_On_(song)" title="wikilink">Walk On</a>&quot; to <a href="Burma" title="wikilink">Burma's</a> pro-democracy leader <a href="Aung_San_Suu_Kyi" title="wikilink">Aung San Suu Kyi</a>.<a href="#fn165" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref165"><sup>165</sup></a> In late 2003, Bono and the Edge participated in the South Africa HIV/AIDS awareness <a href="46664_(concerts)" title="wikilink">46664</a> series of concerts hosted by <a href="Nelson_Mandela" title="wikilink">Nelson Mandela</a>. The band played 2005's <a href="Live_8" title="wikilink">Live 8</a> concert in London. The band and manager Paul McGuinness were awarded <a href="Amnesty_International" title="wikilink">Amnesty International</a>'s <a href="Ambassador_of_Conscience_Award" title="wikilink">Ambassador of Conscience Award</a> for their work in promoting human rights.<a href="#fn166" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref166"><sup>166</sup></a></p>
<p>Since 2000, Bono's campaigning has included <a href="Jubilee_2000" title="wikilink">Jubilee 2000</a> with Bob Geldof, <a href="Muhammad_Ali" title="wikilink">Muhammad Ali</a>, and others to promote the cancellation of third world debt during the <a href="Great_Jubilee" title="wikilink">Great Jubilee</a>. In January 2002, Bono co-founded the multinational <a href="Non-governmental_organization" title="wikilink">NGO</a>, <a href="DATA" class="uri" title="wikilink">DATA</a>, with the aim of improving the social, political, and financial state of Africa. He continued his campaigns for debt and HIV/AIDS relief into June 2002 by making high-profile visits to Africa.<a href="#fn167" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref167"><sup>167</sup></a></p>
<p><a href="Product_Red" title="wikilink">Product Red</a>, a 2006 for-profit brand seeking to raise money for the <a href="The_Global_Fund_to_Fight_AIDS,_Tuberculosis_and_Malaria" title="wikilink">Global Fund</a>, was founded, in part, by Bono. The <a href="ONE_Campaign" title="wikilink">ONE Campaign</a>, the US counterpart of <a href="Make_Poverty_History" title="wikilink">Make Poverty History</a>, has been shaped by his efforts and vision. Bono has also teamed up with <a href="Yahoo!" class="uri" title="wikilink">Yahoo!</a> to promote the ONE Campaign, which Yahoo! has helped to re-develop.</p>
<p>In late 2005, following <a href="Hurricane_Katrina" title="wikilink">Hurricane Katrina</a> and <a href="Hurricane_Rita" title="wikilink">Hurricane Rita</a>, The Edge helped introduce <a href="Music_Rising" title="wikilink">Music Rising</a>, an initiative to raise funds for musicians who lost their instruments in the storm-ravaged <a href="Gulf_Coast_of_the_United_States" title="wikilink">Gulf Coast</a>.<a href="#fn168" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref168"><sup>168</sup></a> In 2006, U2 collaborated with <a href="punk_rock" title="wikilink">punk rock</a> band <a href="Green_Day" title="wikilink">Green Day</a> to record a cover version of the song &quot;<a href="The_Saints_Are_Coming" title="wikilink">The Saints Are Coming</a>&quot; by <a href="The_Skids" title="wikilink">The Skids</a> to benefit Music Rising.<a href="#fn169" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref169"><sup>169</sup></a></p>
<p>U2 and Bono's social activism have not been without its critics however. Several authors and activists who publish in politically left journals such as <a href="CounterPunch" class="uri" title="wikilink">CounterPunch</a> have decried Bono's support of political figures such as <a href="Paul_Wolfowitz" title="wikilink">Paul Wolfowitz</a>,<a href="#fn170" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref170"><sup>170</sup></a> as well as his &quot;essential paternalism&quot;.<a href="#fn171" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref171"><sup>171</sup></a> Other news sources have more generally questioned the efficacy of Bono's campaign to <a href="debt_relief" title="wikilink">relieve debt</a> and provide assistance to Africa.<a href="#fn172" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref172"><sup>172</sup></a> Tax and development campaigners have also criticized the band's move from Ireland to Netherlands to reduce its tax bill.<a href="#fn173" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref173"><sup>173</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="other-projects">Other projects</h2>
<p>The members of U2 have undertaken a number of side projects, sometimes in collaboration with some of their bandmates.
