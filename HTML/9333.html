<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<p>Before 1958, the entire State of Florida was under the jurisdiction of one diocese, the <a href="Roman_Catholic_Diocese_of_Saint_Augustine" title="wikilink">Roman Catholic Diocese of Saint Augustine</a>. In the 1950s and early 1960s, Saint Augustine archbishop <a href="Joseph_Patrick_Hurley" title="wikilink">Joseph Patrick Hurley</a> purchased land throughout South Florida in anticipation of a future population boom.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> Today, these once remote areas are thriving cities. Dozens of Catholic churches, schools and cemeteries built on the land purchased by Hurley dot these areas.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
<p>The Diocese of Miami was created on <a href="October_7" title="wikilink">October 7</a>, <a href="1958" class="uri" title="wikilink">1958</a>, with <a href="Coleman_Carroll" title="wikilink">Coleman Carroll</a> installed as <a href="bishop" class="uri" title="wikilink">bishop</a>. The diocese included the 16 southern counties in Florida, with a Catholic population of 200,000. It encompassed one half of the area of the state. Less than a year after the creation of the diocese, <a href="Fidel_Castro" title="wikilink">Fidel Castro</a> came to power in <a href="Cuba" class="uri" title="wikilink">Cuba</a>. This set off a mass exodus of <a href="Cuban_exile" title="wikilink">Cuban exiles</a> to South Florida. The Catholic Welfare Bureau, created by Carroll, played a significant part in helping these waves of Cuban immigrants. Between 1960 and 1962, 14,000 Cuban children were sent to the United States. <a href="Operation_Pedro_Pan" title="wikilink">Operation Pedro Pan</a>, created by Monsignor <a href="Bryan_O._Walsh" title="wikilink">Bryan O. Walsh</a>, placed them with friends, relatives or the Catholic Welfare Bureau. In 1996, the Catholic Welfare Bureau changed its name to Catholic Charities. Today it claims to be the largest non-governmental provider of social services in South Florida. It served over 17,000 families in the tri-county area of Broward, Dade and Monroe counties in 2006.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a><img src="Mariel_Refugees.jpg" title="fig:Cuban refugees arriving in crowded boats during the Mariel Boatlift crisis." alt="Cuban refugees arriving in crowded boats during the Mariel Boatlift crisis." width="300" /></p>

Eight counties became part of the <a href="Roman_Catholic_Diocese_of_St._Petersburg" title="wikilink">Diocese of St. Petersburg</a> and the new <a href="Roman_Catholic_Diocese_of_Orlando" title="wikilink">Diocese of Orlando</a>. Miami was made an Archdiocese by <a href="Pope_Paul_VI" title="wikilink">Pope Paul VI</a>, and was named Metropolitan See for all of Florida.

<p>In 1997, soon after becoming archbishop, John Favalora responded to these scandals by adopting the Charter for the Protection of Young People. This charter, which was adopted by all U.S. bishops several years later in response to similar abuse in other dioceses, requires all priests, employees, and volunteers of the Archdiocese to be fingerprinted and have a background check.<a href="#fn73" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref73"><sup>73</sup></a><a href="#fn74" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref74"><sup>74</sup></a> All allegations of sexual abuse are required to be reported to the police. Suspected offenders are suspended pending the outcome of an investigation. If the allegations are deemed by investigators to be credible, the suspected offender is relieved of duties and prosecuted. Counseling is offered for victims.</p>
