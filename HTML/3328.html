<p><strong>Ante Markovi&lt;U+0107&gt;</strong> (born <a href="November_25" title="wikilink">November 25</a>, <a href="1924" class="uri" title="wikilink">1924</a> in <a href="Konjic" class="uri" title="wikilink">Konjic</a>, <a href="Kingdom_of_Serbs,_Croats_and_Slovenes" title="wikilink">Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes</a> (now <a href="Bosnia_and_Herzegovina" title="wikilink">Bosnia and Herzegovina</a>)) was the last <a href="prime_minister" title="wikilink">prime minister</a> of the <a href="Socialist_Federal_Republic_of_Yugoslavia" title="wikilink">Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia</a>. He is a Bosnian <a href="Croat" class="uri" title="wikilink">Croat</a>.</p>
<p>He graduated from the Electrotechnical Department of the Technical Faculty of the <a href="University_of_Zagreb" title="wikilink">University of Zagreb</a> in <a href="1954" class="uri" title="wikilink">1954</a>.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1986. he became president of the Presidency of Socialist Republic of Croatia (thus becoming 7th Croatian president) replacing Ema Derosi-Bjelajac. He held that position until 1988. when he was replaced by Ivo Latin.</p>
<p>He became prime minister in March of <a href="1989" class="uri" title="wikilink">1989</a> following the resignation of <a href="Branko_Mikuli&lt;U+0107&gt;" title="wikilink">Branko Mikuli&lt;U+0107&gt;</a>. At the end of the year, Markovi&lt;U+0107&gt; launched a new and ambitious program of unprecedented economic reforms, including stabilization of <a href="currency" class="uri" title="wikilink">currency</a> and <a href="privatization" class="uri" title="wikilink">privatization</a> by giving employees company shares. The result of his monetary reform was a halt to inflation, which had plagued Yugoslavia in previous decades, and a short-lived but spectacular rise in the standard of living. This made Markovi&lt;U+0107&gt; one of the most popular politicians in Yugoslav history.</p>
<p>Markovi&lt;U+0107&gt; owed his popularity to the image of new, modern Western-style politician who doesn't shy away from applying make-up before television appearances or starring in television commercials. As such, he quickly became the darling of liberal circles who wanted Yugoslavia to be transformed into modern, democratic federation. Markovi&lt;U+0107&gt; also maintained popularity by staying out of increasingly virulent quarrels within the leadership of <a href="Communist_Party_of_Yugoslavia" title="wikilink">Yugoslav Communist Party</a> or trying to act as mediator between various republics.</p>
<p>When CPY broke up in January <a href="1990" class="uri" title="wikilink">1990</a>, Markovi&lt;U+0107&gt; had only his popularity and apparent success of his programme on his side. In July 1990, he formed the <a href="Union_of_Reform_Forces" title="wikilink">Union of Reform Forces</a> (<em>Savez reformskih snaga</em>), a political party supporting reformed Yugoslavian federation. According to a poll conducted by the Federal Executive Council (SIV), this party had support of 14% of people in <a href="Bosnia_and_Herzegovina" title="wikilink">Bosnia</a>, and less than 5% in other republics<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Later, his programme was sabotaged by <a href="Slobodan_Milo&lt;U+0161&gt;evi&lt;U+0107&gt;" title="wikilink">Slobodan Milo&lt;U+0161&gt;evi&lt;U+0107&gt;</a> and Serbian government, and the authority of federal government was diminished by secessionist moves in <a href="Slovenia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Slovenia</a> and <a href="Croatia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Croatia</a>. Last months of his tenure Markovi&lt;U+0107&gt; tried to find compromise between secessionists and those demanding that Yugoslavia remains as single entity. His efforts, although favoured by new democratic governments in Bosnia and <a href="Republic_of_Macedonia" title="wikilink">Macedonia</a>, ultimately failed, because <a href="Yugoslav_People&#39;s_Army" title="wikilink">army</a> - which was supposed to be his greatest ally - sided with Milo&lt;U+0161&gt;evi&lt;U+0107&gt; and Serb nationalists.</p>
<p>In 1991, the <a href="USA" class="uri" title="wikilink">USA</a> cut off all financial aid to Yugoslavia until all 6 republics held free elections (<em>1991 Foreign Operations Appropriations Law 101-513</em>), contributing to another destabilization of the economy, along the with already big <a href="foreign_debt" title="wikilink">foreign debt</a> of the country<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Markovi&lt;U+0107&gt; remained in office even after the start of the war, only to resign in December 1991, insulated and without any authority.</p>
<p>After that, Markovi&lt;U+0107&gt; disappeared from the public eye. In <a href="1993" class="uri" title="wikilink">1993</a> he was rumoured to be <a href="Franjo_Tu&lt;U+0111&gt;man" title="wikilink">Tu&lt;U+0111&gt;man</a>'s choice for <a href="Prime_Minister_of_Croatia" title="wikilink">Croatian prime minister</a>, apparently due to his economic expertise. The post ultimately fell to <a href="Nikica_Valenti&lt;U+0107&gt;" title="wikilink">Nikica Valenti&lt;U+0107&gt;</a>, who had used some of Markovi&lt;U+0107&gt;'s recipes to halt inflation.</p>
<p>Markovi&lt;U+0107&gt; instead dedicated himself to a business career. In the early 2000s he worked as an economic advisor to the <a href="Republic_of_Macedonia" title="wikilink">Macedonian</a> government.</p>
<p>He appeared as a witness at <a href="Slobodan_Milo&lt;U+0161&gt;evi&lt;U+0107&gt;" title="wikilink">Milo&lt;U+0161&gt;evi&lt;U+0107&gt;'s</a> trial at the <a href="ICTY" class="uri" title="wikilink">ICTY</a> in <a href="2003" class="uri" title="wikilink">2003</a>. This appearance broke his 12 years of silence; after that testimony, he gave an interview to the <a href="Zagreb" class="uri" title="wikilink">Zagreb</a>-based <a href="Globus_(weekly)" title="wikilink">Globus</a> news magazine. In his testimony he stated that both Milo&lt;U+0161&gt;evi&lt;U+0107&gt; and <a href="Franjo_Tu&lt;U+0111&gt;man" title="wikilink">Tu&lt;U+0111&gt;man</a> confirmed to him that in March 1991 in <a href="Kara&lt;U+0111&gt;or&lt;U+0111&gt;evo" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kara&lt;U+0111&gt;or&lt;U+0111&gt;evo</a> they made an agreement to get himself out of politics. <a href="http://www.vecernji-list.hr/newsroom/news/international/687849/index.do" class="uri" title="wikilink">http://www.vecernji-list.hr/newsroom/news/international/687849/index.do</a><a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a>.</p>
