<p>Robert H. Hewsen shows the region where today's Hemshin is located to be populated by a people with different designations throughout the ancient and early medieval history. He indicates thereby that some designations may have alternative forms and partially presents the names used with question marks. In summary from 13th century to 6th century BC Kolkhians,<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> 550 to 330 BC Kolkhiansa and Makrones,<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> 180 BC to 14 AD Laz (Chanian tribes),<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> in the Arsacid Period (63 AD&lt;U+2013&gt;298 AD) Heniokhians, Makhelones, Heptakometians, <a href="Mossynoeci" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mossynoeci</a><a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> as well as Sannians, Drilles and Makrones<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> are mentioned.</p>
<p>The Hemshin region is shown as part of <a href="Colchis" class="uri" title="wikilink">Colchis</a> (299 AD&lt;U+2013&gt;387 AD),<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> <a href="Tzans" title="wikilink">Tzanica</a> ( 387 AD&lt;U+2013&gt;591 AD)<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> and <a href="Chaldia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Chaldia</a> ( 654 AD&lt;U+2013&gt;750 AD).<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> The specific location of Hem&lt;U+015F&gt;in is indicated as Tambur/Hamama&lt;U+0161&gt;en as a fort and town for the first time in the map covering the period 654&lt;U+2013&gt;750.</p>
<p>Those two names (Tambur and Hamama&lt;U+0161&gt;en ) are included in the History of Taron by Pseudo John Mamikonian in a short passage<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> about a war between the ruler of Tambur, Hamam, and his maternal uncle the Georgian Prince, which resulted in the destruction of the town to be rebuild by Hamam and be named after him namely Hamamshen. This event is declared by Mamikonian to have taken place in early seventh century. Hamamashen became with time Hamshen. Simonian who conveys this story reports also that the date given by the author may be wrong.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
<p>Two other Armenian chronicles Ghewond and Stephen Asoghik of Taron, report in short passages in their histories about a migration from Armenia/Oshakan led by prince Shaspuh <a href="Amatuni" class="uri" title="wikilink">Amatuni</a> and his son Hamam. Ghewond conveys this immigration to be to avoid heavy taxes imposed on Armenians by the Arab rulers. The <a href="Amatuni" class="uri" title="wikilink">Amatuni</a> lords are offered fertile land to settle down by the Byzantine Emperor, after they crossed the Corukh river. This migration is dated to be after 789 by Ghewond and as 750 by Stephen Asoghik of Taron.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a><a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>
<p>Benninghaus specifies &lt;U+201C&gt;Tambur&lt;U+201D&gt; as the destination of the migration led by Hamam and his father Shapuh Amaduni and says that they have seemingly met people there who were already Christians, possibly Greeks.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> Redgate informs about possible symbolism used in the Ghewond&lt;U+2019&gt;s history and possible garbling in Mamikonian&lt;U+2019&gt;s history, and cautions not to take everything at face value.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> Hachikian states &lt;U+201C&gt;There is no clue as to where Tambur, the legendary capital of Hamshen, was located. The only certain thing about it is that it clearly belonged to a much earlier time- if it existed at all&lt;U+201D&gt;.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> He also mentions in the footnote the name similarity between Tambur and a yayla known as Tahpur or Tagpur, in the heights of Kaptanpasa. Simonian states that Tambur is probably in the vicinity of Varo&lt;U+015F&gt;kale (altitude 1800 m).<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> <img src="Elevit_hem&lt;U+015F&gt;inliler_hemshin.jpg" title="fig:Traditional Hemshin bagpipe, &lt;U+00C7&gt;aml&lt;U+0131&gt;hem&lt;U+015F&gt;in, Rize, Turkey." alt="Traditional Hemshin bagpipe, &lt;U+00C7&gt;aml&lt;U+0131&gt;hem&lt;U+015F&gt;in, Rize, Turkey." width="250" /></p>
<p>A description of &quot;Haynsen&quot; in the Kingdom of Georgia, its inhabitants and history is contained in &quot;La Fleur des histoires de la terre d'Orient&quot; by Hetu'm of Corycos, written around 1307, translated into English in 1520, and later reproduced in the travellers' tales of Samuel Purchas published in 1614. Purrchas uses the term &quot;Hamsem&quot; to designate the region and concludes that this is the place of the original Cimmerian gloom of <a href="Homer" class="uri" title="wikilink">Homer</a>'s <a href="Odyssey" class="uri" title="wikilink">Odyssey</a><a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a><a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> The translation of He'tum's related passage to modern English uses the term Hamshen.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> He'tum describes the region to be &quot;miraculous and strange place&quot; unbelievable unless seen by own eyes, dark and without roads. Signs of human settlement are that &quot;...Â People in those parts say that one frequently hears the sounds of men bellowing, of cocks crowing, of horses neighing in the forest,&quot; Those people are described by He'tum, leaning upon Georgian and Armenian Histories, to be the descendants of the men of the &quot;wicked&quot; Iranian Emperor Shaworeos who had chased and harassed Christian people. The referenced translation suggests this Emperor could be Shapuhr II, [AD 309&lt;U+2013&gt;379].<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a></p>
<p>Simonian considers the so described difficulty in access not to imply total isolation. On the contrary, he reports, Hamshen served sometimes as a transit route between the coastal regions and the Armenian plateau.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a></p>
<p>Further theories of medieval settlement to Hamshen are that</p>
<ul>
<li>following the Seljuk Turks occupation, Ani Armenians have fled to Hemshin which had never seen any human face before;</li>
<li>there has been continuous influx of Armenians from the South following the initial settlement; resulting in an armenisation of the area through expelling local <a href="Tzans" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tzans</a> population and</li>
<li>the armenization of the Tzan people took place through ruling dynasties in the South.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a></li>
</ul>
<p>Sources of the ruling powers in the region, (Byzantine Trapezuntine, Georgian, Armenian and Turkish) are silent about Hemshin; until the conquest by the Ottomans.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> It is deduced that Hem&lt;U+015F&gt;in has been governed by local lords under the umbrella of the greater regional powers changing by the time namely the Bagratid Armenian kingdom, the Byzantine Empire, its successor the Empire of Trebizond, the Georgian Kingdom, the Kara Koyunlu and Ak Koyunlu Turkmen Confederations<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> until it was annexed by the Ottoman Empire which collapsed as a result of the WW1 and gave birth to the Republic of Turkey.</p>
<p>The Ottoman conquest of Hemshin occurred sometime in the 1480s: an Ottoman register dated around 1486 calls it <em>Hemshin</em> and mentions it as being an Ottoman possession.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="turkish-dominance-and-division">Turkish dominance and division</h3>
<p><a href="Turkish_people" title="wikilink">Turkish</a> influence was firmly established in the region after the <a href="Battle_of_Manzikert" title="wikilink">Battle of Manzikert</a> in 1071, after which the <a href="Seljuk_Turks" title="wikilink">Seljuk Turks</a> and other <a href="Anatolian_Turkish_Beyliks" title="wikilink">Turkish tribes</a> gained a strong foothold in <a href="Central_Anatolia" title="wikilink">Central Anatolia</a> and Western <a href="Armenian_Highlands" title="wikilink">Armenian Highlands</a>, often referred to as <a href="Eastern_Anatolia" title="wikilink">Eastern Anatolia</a>, bringing the local population in contact with the religion of <a href="Islam" class="uri" title="wikilink">Islam</a>. In 15th century, the region of Hamshen was incorporated into the <a href="Ottoman_Empire" title="wikilink">Ottoman Empire</a>. During the Turkish rule, two most important developments are <a href="human_migration" title="wikilink">human migrations</a> and <a href="Religious_conversion" title="wikilink">conversions</a>.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a><a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> Most sources agree that prior to Ottoman era majority of the residents of Hemshin were <a href="Christianity" title="wikilink">Christian</a> and members of the Armenian Apostolic Church. The details and the accompanying circumstances for the migrations and the <a href="Religious_conversion" title="wikilink">conversions</a> during the Ottoman era are not clearly known or documented.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a><a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a></p>
<p>As a result of those developments, distinctive communities with the same generic name have also appeared in the vicinity of <a href="Hopa" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hopa</a>, <a href="Turkey" class="uri" title="wikilink">Turkey</a> as well as in the <a href="Caucasus" class="uri" title="wikilink">Caucasus</a>.

<h2 id="demographics">Demographics</h2>
<p>Two major developments in the Hemshin region during the Ottoman era: Islamization and population movements.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a><a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a><a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a> Islam may have begun to spread prior to the Ottoman rule, but it did not become the general religion before the end of the 16th century. A number of population movements (both into and out of the region) also happened during the Ottoman era. Even though detailed information regarding the nature of these movements is missing, in summary:</p>
<ul>
<li>some Hemshinli who were members of the Armenian Orthodox Church emigrated to other countries on the eastern Black Sea during the early centuries of Ottoman rule;</li>
<li>some Muslim Hemshinli migrated to western Anatolia and the Caucasus as a result of the Turco-Russian wars and related hardships during the 19th century;</li>
<li>some immigration into the area have occurred during Ottoman rule.</li>
</ul>
<p>The present community of Hemshinli is exclusively Muslim and Turkish speaking. This goes for the people living in Hemshin or people maintaining links to the area and living elsewhere in Turkey.<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a><a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a><a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a></p>
<p>A distinct community settled about 50Â km east of Hem&lt;U+015F&gt;in in villages around Hopa and Bor&lt;U+00E7&gt;ka also call themselves &lt;U+201C&gt;Hem&lt;U+015F&gt;inli&lt;U+201D&gt;. They are often referred to as the &lt;U+201C&gt;Hopa Hem&lt;U+015F&gt;inli&lt;U+201D&gt;. Professor of Linguistics Bert Vaux at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee refers to this group as the &lt;U+201C&gt;Eastern Hamshenis&lt;U+201D&gt;. Hem&lt;U+015F&gt;inli and Hopa Hem&lt;U+015F&gt;inli are separated not only by geography but also by language and some features of culture. The two groups are almost oblivious to one another's existence. Simonian reports various theories regarding the appearance of the Hope Hemshinli group. Those theories relate to whether the groups migrated from Hemshin or they were settled by the Ottoman authorities, whether the migration/settlement was in the early 16th or late 17th centuries, and whether the migration took place in one step or two waves. The Hopa Hem&lt;U+015F&gt;inli are exclusively Muslim as well. Simonian reports that there is a controversy regarding whether they arrived in the Hopa region as Muslims or converted to Islam after arrival.<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a></p>
<p>The Hopa Hem&lt;U+015F&gt;inli speak a language called &quot;Hem&lt;U+015F&gt;ince&quot; or (&lt;U+201C&gt;Hom&lt;U+015F&gt;etsi&lt;U+201D&gt; and/or Homshetsma in some sources) as well as Turkish. Recent studies by Hovann Simonian (Author: The Hemshin: A Handbook (Caucasus World)) suggest that this language is an archaic dialect of Armenian subject to influence from Turkish and Laz.<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a> Vaux also reports that &quot;Hem&lt;U+015F&gt;ince&quot; has been subject to influence from Turkish to a much greater extent than other Armenian dialects.<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a> Hem&lt;U+015F&gt;ince and Armenian are generally mutually not intelligible.<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a></p>
<p>In addition to these two groups there are people speaking Hem&lt;U+015F&gt;ince / Homshetsma in the countries of the former USSR whose ancestors probably originated from Hem&lt;U+015F&gt;in and/or Hopa Hem&lt;U+015F&gt;in in course of the various population movements to the Caucasus. Many of the Muslim Hem&lt;U+015F&gt;ince speakers in the former USSR were deported from the Adjara area of Georgia during the Stalin era to Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan. Since 1989, a considerable number of these deportees have moved to Krasnodar Krai since 1989, along with the <a href="Meskhetian_Turks" title="wikilink">Meskhetian Turks</a>.</p>
<p>Most Christian Hem&lt;U+015F&gt;ince speakers currently live in Abkhazia and in the Krasnodar Krai region of Russia, concentrated in the Sochi area and Adygeya.</p>
<h2 id="culture">Culture</h2>
<p>Hemshinli are well known for the clever jokes, riddles, and stories that they tell. Some of the anecdotes that the Muslim Hemshinli tell are actually based on older Armenian ones. They accompany dances with their own brand of music using the <em><a href="tulum_(bagpipe)" title="wikilink">tulum</a></em> (the <a href="Pontus" title="wikilink">Pontic</a> <a href="bagpipe" class="uri" title="wikilink">bagpipe</a>) (for the Western group), the <em>&lt;U+015F&gt;im&lt;U+015F&gt;ir kaval</em> (<a href="flute" class="uri" title="wikilink">flute</a> made of <a href="buxus" class="uri" title="wikilink">buxus</a>) (for the Eastern group) or the <em>Hamshna-Zurna</em> (Hamsheni <a href="zurna" class="uri" title="wikilink">zurna</a>) (for the Northern group). The traditional occupations of the Turkish Hemshinli are cultivating <a href="tea" class="uri" title="wikilink">tea</a> and <a href="maize" class="uri" title="wikilink">maize</a>, breeding <a href="livestock" class="uri" title="wikilink">livestock</a>, and <a href="beekeeping" class="uri" title="wikilink">beekeeping</a>. The Northern Hamshenis of Russia and Georgia, meanwhile, are primarily known as citrus, corn, tobacco and tea growers as well as <a href="fishery" title="wikilink">fishermen</a>.

<h3 id="hamshenis-in-russia-and-the-former-soviet-union">Hamshenis in Russia and the former Soviet Union</h3>
<p>Interest in Hamshen heritage is rising among Christian Hamshenis in the former Soviet Union. In 2006, the first music album in Homshetsma by the Ensemble Caravan was released in Krasnodar. Hamshen Scientific, Information and Cultural Centre began to work on exclusive projects in order to recover the cultural heritage of the Hamshenis living in the region. The Armenian newspaper published in <a href="Sukhumi" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sukhumi</a> carries the name <em>Hamshen</em>.</p>
<p>During the <a href="Mikhail_Gorbachev" title="wikilink">Mikhail Gorbachev</a> period of the <a href="Soviet_Union" title="wikilink">Soviet Union</a> in the late 1980s, the Hamshenis of Kazakhstan began petitioning for the government to move them to the <a href="Armenian_SSR" title="wikilink">Armenian SSR</a>. However, this move was denied by Moscow because of fears that the Muslim Hamshenis might spark ethnic conflicts with their Christian Armenian brothers.<a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a></p>
<p>After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, most Hamshenis lived relatively undisturbed. However, those in the Abkhazia region of Georgia had trouble coping with day-to-day life during the <a href="Georgian_Civil_War" title="wikilink">Georgian Civil War</a>.</p>
<p>Since 2000, several hundred of the Muslim Hamshenis in Russia who have resettled from Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan to <a href="Krasnodar_Krai" title="wikilink">Krasnodar Krai</a> (about 1000 total) have repeatedly attempted to formally receive registration from the local authorities. This is similar and related to the problem of the <a href="Meskhetian_Turks" title="wikilink">Meskhetians</a>. These actions have been made difficult by the attitude of the Krasnodar officials. In defiance of the authorities an organisation of their co-ethnics in Armenia have appealed to the Russian ambassador in <a href="Yerevan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Yerevan</a> to get <a href="Moscow" class="uri" title="wikilink">Moscow</a> to intervene in this case and overrule the regional officials who seem intent on preventing Hamshenis from gaining a status of permanent residency.<a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a> <img src="Hemshin_Women.jpg" title="fig:Hemshinli woman Rize, Turkey" alt="Hemshinli woman Rize, Turkey" width="250" /> In the 2002 Russian Federation census, 1,542 people identified themselves as Hamshenis, two-thirds of whom were living in Krasnodar Krai.</p>

<p>Whether Christian or Muslim, most Armenians are willing to work with and try to understand their ethnic cousins. From October 13 to 15, 2005, a Hamsheni international scientific convention was held in Sochi. The conference was organized under the Institute of History of the Academy of Sciences of Armenia, Russian-Armenian Commonwealth Organization of Moscow (commissioned by the <a href="Armenian_Revolutionary_Federation" title="wikilink">Armenian Revolutionary Federation</a>) with help from the Armenian Scientific Informational and Cultural Center, &quot;Hamshen&quot; (Krasnodar, Russia) and Russian Armenian newspaper <a href="Yerkramas" class="uri" title="wikilink">Yerkramas</a>. It involved scholars from Armenia, Russia, the <a href="United_States" title="wikilink">United States</a>, <a href="Germany" class="uri" title="wikilink">Germany</a>, and <a href="Iran" class="uri" title="wikilink">Iran</a> to discuss the past of the Hamshenis.</p>

He immediately wrote a letter to Vashdean reprimanding him for his plot. Vashdean grew angry and had Hamam's feet and hands loped off. Then, taking the Iranians, [Vashdean] crossed the Chorox river and went to Hamam's city, named Tambur, which he attacked with fire and sword and enslaved. Now the blessed bishop of the city, Manknos, severely cursed the prince. [Vashdean] ordered the Iranians to kill the priests in the church named Holy Zion. The bishop had silently prayed to God to ask only that the city be turned into a desert and a ruin and that for all eternity no one reside there. He threw himself on the altar and [the Iranlans] sacrificed him on Pentecost before mass was offered to Christ. On the next day there was a cloudburst and [Vashdean] was consumed by fire as he sat by the city gates of Tambur. Hamam subsequently [re]built this [city] calling it after himself, Hamamashen. And Mangnos' prayer was realized. In one night 3,000 men died, others fled, and the city remained a ruin.&quot;<a href="#fnref17" class="footnote-back">â©</a></li>

For even if they gave all that they possessed, it was not enough to save themselves. This same Sulaiman sent to the city of Dwin his son-in-law, a certain Ibn Ducas (Ibndoke'), an impious and malevolent man, son of one of his maid-servants, who was of Greek nationality. He imposed unendurably heavy taxes on the residents of our land. All the lords, common folk, bishops and the kat'oghikos Esayi [Esayi I Eghipatrushets'i, 775-788] came and pleaded with [Ibn Ducas] to reduce the onerous level of taxation, but it was of no avail. For the wrath of the Lord had delivered the Christians into merciless hands. [Ibn Ducas instead] sent tax collectors to the different parts of the land with the order to double the yearly collection and to take it immediately, and they implemented the command. Once this was accomplished, this son of satan devised another wicked scheme. He had lead seals put around the necks of everyone, demanding many zuzas for each [seal]. Thus did this wicked executioner reduce everyone to the worst extremes of bankruptcy through his intolerant measures. [g167].&quot;<a href="#fnref20" class="footnote-back">â©</a></li>

<li id="fn28">There is a miraculous and strange place in the realm of Georgia whichâhad I not seen it with by own eyesâI would neither dare to speak about it nor to believe in it. But since I was there in person and saw it, I shall discuss it. There is a district named Hamshen in that area, its circumference being a three day's journey. And despite the district's extent, the place is so foggy and dark that no one can see anything. For no road goes through it. People in those parts say that one frequently hears the sounds of men bellowing, of cocks crowing, of horses neighing in the forest, and the murmuring of a river which flows thence. These are all regarded as trustworthy signs there that a settlement of people exists in the area. This much is true: [g15] in the histories of the kingdoms of Armenia and Georgia it may be read that a certain wicked Emperor Shaworeos [?Shapuhr II, A.D. 309-79], an idolator and ferocious persecutor of Christians, one day ordered that all the inhabitants of Asia come and worship the idols. Those who ignored the command were to be burned with fire. Whereupon it transpired that some of the Christians chose martyrdom to worshipping the idols. Some chose to convert temporarily and, out of fear, worshipped the idols, so that they not be deprived of their lives and worldly goods. Meanwhile others took to the mountains and deserted places and somehow kept themselves alive. The group of the best Christians who lived in the Moghon [Mughan] plain thought to leave their belongings and to pass to Greece [Byzantium]. While they were so resolved, the [Persian] Emperor arose before them, ordering that those refusing to sacrifice to the idols should be pulled apart, limb by limb. Now the people cried out to the Lord Jesus Christ and, going by the straight path, they survived. However, the infidels have resided in that gloomy valley to the present. [And then the Christians made a great cry to Our Lord God, and soon after came this great darkness that blinded the Emperor and all his men; and so the Christian men escaped, and the Emperor with his men tarried in the darkness. oe15] And they must stay there until the end of the world. So it is believed by everyone, and so it is related.<a href="#fnref28" class="footnote-back">â©</a></li>
