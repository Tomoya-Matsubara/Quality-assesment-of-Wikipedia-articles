<p>The <strong>currencies of Puerto Rico</strong> closely follow the historic development of <a href="Puerto_Rico" title="wikilink">Puerto Rico</a>. As a colony of <a href="Spain" class="uri" title="wikilink">Spain</a> and the <a href="United_States" title="wikilink">United States</a>, Puerto Rico was granted the use of both foreign and provincial currencies. Following the <a href="Spanish_colonization_of_the_Americas" title="wikilink">Spanish colonization</a> in 1502, Puerto Rico became an important port, with its own supply of gold. However, as the mineral reserves ran empty within the century, the archipelago's economy suffered. The <a href="Monarchy_of_Spain" title="wikilink">Spanish Crown</a> issued the <em>Situado Mexicano</em>, which meant that a semi-regular shipment of gold from the <a href="Viceroyalty_of_New_Spain" title="wikilink">Viceroyalty of New Spain</a> would be sent to the island, as a way to provide economic support. Between 1636 and 1637, <a href="Philip_IV_of_Spain" title="wikilink">Philip IV of Spain</a> imposed a tax which had to be paid using a <a href="revenue_stamp" title="wikilink">revenue stamp</a>. Inspired by this, Puerto Rico began producing <a href="banknote" title="wikilink">banknotes</a> in 1766, becoming the first colony to print 8-<em><a href="Spanish_real" title="wikilink">real</a></em> banknotes in the Spanish Empire and which in the Spanish government's approval of subsequent issues.</p>
<p>The <em>situado</em> was discontinued during the 19th century, creating an economic crisis, as a result of <a href="Mexican_War_of_Independence" title="wikilink">Mexico gaining its independence</a> from Spain. <a href="List_of_Governors_of_Puerto_Rico#Governors_under_Spanish_Crown" title="wikilink">Salvador Mel&lt;U+00E9&gt;ndez Bruna</a>, the colonial governor in office, ordered the issue of provincial banknotes, creating the <strong>Puerto Rican peso</strong>. However, printing of these banknotes ceased after 1815. During the following decades, foreign <a href="coin" title="wikilink">coins</a> became the widespread currency. In the 1860s and 1870s, banknotes reemerged. On February 1, 1890, the <em>Banco Espa&lt;U+00F1&gt;ol de Puerto Rico</em> was inaugurated and began issuing banknotes. The bank designed four series and placed three in circulation under Spanish rule. In 1895, a Royal <a href="Decree" class="uri" title="wikilink">Decree</a> ordered the production of provincial <em><a href="peso" class="uri" title="wikilink">peso</a></em> coins.</p>
<p>On August 13, 1898, the <a href="Spanish-American_War" title="wikilink">Spanish-American War</a> ended with Spain ceding Puerto Rico to the United States. The <em>Banco Espa&lt;U+00F1&gt;ol de Puerto Rico</em> was renamed Bank of Porto Rico and issued bills equivalent to the <a href="United_States_dollar" title="wikilink">United States dollar</a>, creating the <strong>Puerto Rican dollar</strong>. In 1902, the First National Bank of Porto Rico issued banknotes in a parallel manner. Two more series were issued until 1913. After Puerto Rico's economy and monetary system was fully integrated into the United States' economic and monetary system, the Puerto Rican dollars were redeemed for those issued by the <a href="United_States_Treasury" title="wikilink">United States Treasury</a>. The peso and dollar have been followed by other contemporary issues, including commemorative banknotes, private currency, and a <a href="Quarter_(United_States_coin)" title="wikilink">quarter</a> coin designed with <a href="Fort_San_Felipe_del_Morro" title="wikilink">Fort San Felipe del Morro</a> in the face.</p>

<p>After <a href="Juan_Ponce_de_Le&lt;U+00F3&gt;n" title="wikilink">Juan Ponce de Le&lt;U+00F3&gt;n</a> began the colonization process of Puerto Rico, the archipelago became an strategic military location, used by Spain to protect its colonies and possessions in America.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> Vessels used it as a main point for resupplying before attempting long voyages and trading became a key part of economy. However, when the mines and rivers in the main island of Puerto Rico, then known as San Juan Bautista, were depleted Puerto Rico began suffering from shortage of gold and its income was reduced drastically, precipitating a recession.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> Beginning in the 16th century, the Spanish Crown was forced to issue a monetary support decree to the archipelago known as <em>situado</em>, which was supplied by the Royal banks in Central America, particularly Mexico.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> However, this aid failed to arrive often, contributing to the economical instability. This was exacerbated by other factors, including the costs of running an efficient military and a lack of commercial prosperity. Natural conditions and disasters also contributed, multiplying the costs of maintaining fortresses while hurricanes damaged haciendas, destroying crops and shortening the amount of laborers.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>Municipalities suffered most, being forced to implement taxes, including the <em>alcaba del viento</em> (lit. &quot;wind tax&quot;), which was imposed on foreign suppliers. However, these taxes barely helped, this was because each one had to receive a Royal certification, a bureaucratic procedure which usually lasted several years. Once they reached an established deadline, the process would have to be repeated, taking an extended amount of time. From January 1, 1636, to December 15, 1637, <a href="Philip_IV_of_Spain" title="wikilink">Philip IV of Spain</a> imposed a obligatory payment to the treasuries in Puerto Rico. The debt was to be paid with currency symbolized by legalized papers bearing a Royal seal.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> Researchers believe that the use of these documents had an impact in the production of banknotes in Puerto Rico. In due time, these documents would be short in supply upon their arrival, in such cases the government officials would stamp the current date into old papers.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> Pedro Tom&lt;U+00E1&gt;s de Cordova and Humberto Burzio claim in their research that Puerto Rico was the first place in America to print 8-<em><a href="Spanish_real" title="wikilink">real</a></em>, establishing 1766 as the date for this achievement.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> Thus, putting Puerto Rico ahead by two decades before <a href="Cuba" class="uri" title="wikilink">Cuba</a> (1781), <a href="Hispaniola" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hispaniola</a> (1782) and even Spain (1783).<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> Both researchers divided the first two types of banknotes issued, the two varieties were classified as &quot;issued&quot; and &quot;printed&quot;. Although both were manufactured using the same method, those referred to as &quot;printed&quot; bore stamps listing numbers and letters.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> In 1767, the Spanish Crown approved subsequent issues, conditioning that they should be collected once <em>situado</em> shipped. When this was lacking, paper money was used in a widespread manner throughout the main island. These requirements were met when possible, an example of this was in 1769, when 88,000 banknotes were reclaimed by the authorities.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="birth-of-the-puerto-rican-peso">Birth of the Puerto Rican peso</h2>
<p>In the 19th century, the issuing of <em>situado</em> concluded, with two last deliveries of 500,000 and 100,000 between 1809 and 1810.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> This brought forth a critical economical crisis to Puerto Rico. At the moment, Salvador Mel&lt;U+00E9&gt;ndez Bruna, the colonial governor in office, ordered the production of provincial paper money. The decree was officially enacted on August 31, 1812. These banknotes used the <em>peso</em> being used as equivalent to Spanish <em>reales</em>.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> Produced by hand, these banknotes featured quantities in the thousands, with 1 <em>peso</em> being worth 8 <em>reales</em>.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> Mechanical printing had arrived to Puerto Rico years earlier, but up until 1813, part of the issued notes were being produced by hand and stamped. Between 1812 and 1813, the tradition of collecting paper money continued, which reduced the amount of surviving banknotes drastically.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> The other notes printed between 1813 and 1814, featured a combination of printed types and stamps, the printing was done by Puerto Rico's National Printing Office and featured patterns to prevent the production of counterfeits.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> Those featuring denominations in <em>reales</em>, were adorned by Spain's Royal Seal, with the color varying depending on the date of issue, the 1813 8-<em>real</em> banknotes featured a lamb on the obverse.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> However, these security measures were ineffective against counterfeiting, eventually copies of several denominations were circulating in a widespread manner, forcing cities outside of San Juan, Arecibo and Loiza to discontinue their use. Mel&lt;U+00E9&gt;ndez Bruna decided that the only way to prevent forgery was by asking Spain to produce sealed paper for the printing of the banknotes.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> The first issue beared the signatures of treasurers or accountants, but this was dropped the subsequent year.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>

<p>On February 11, 1813, Alejandro Ram&lt;U+00ED&gt;rez arrived to Puerto Rico and almost immediately was named to the office of Intendant, eventually establishing a Consulate of Commerce to control trade in Puerto Rico.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> Originally from <a href="Guatemala" class="uri" title="wikilink">Guatemala</a>, where he had served in various political positions, Ram&lt;U+00ED&gt;rez was also a member of the Philadelphia Philosophical Society. The <em>Diario Econ&lt;U+00F3&gt;mico de Puerto Rico</em>, a newspaper specialized in the archipelago's economy, noted that during the time banknotes of all denominations were still being forged in large quantities.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> The publication claimed that the counterfeits were most likely produced in other locations of the Caribbean, this was based on the fact that only one royal press existed in Puerto Rico.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> However, modern researchers maintain that the copies could have been produced locally in a clandestine manner. This is based on a report that emphasizes that the designs of false 8-<em>real</em> notes were crude and that the ink used spread when touched, something that wouldn't be possible if produced elsewhere, particularly because the ink would dry in the voyage between countries.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> During this time, paper notes began disappearing and the stated recurred to renewing old pieces.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1814, <a href="Ferdinand_VII_of_Spain" title="wikilink">Ferdinand VII</a> refused to renew the <a href="Spanish_Constitution_of_1812" title="wikilink">Spanish Constitution of 1812</a>, returning the Empire to an absolutist method of government. Consequently, Ram&lt;U+00ED&gt;rez contacted some of his allies in Philadelphia and commissioned the production of banknotes in denominations of 3 and 5 <em>reales</em>.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> The issues were printed by <a href="American_Bank_Note_Company#History" title="wikilink">Murray, Draper, Fairham &amp; Company</a> and featured the signatures of treasurer Jos&lt;U+00E9&gt; Bacener and Ram&lt;U+00ED&gt;rez.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> The designs featured the Spanish Crown and Ferdinand VII's profile in the two varieties and were numbered manually.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> No official documentation, letter or decree from the Spanish Crown related to the creation of these notes have surfaced.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> These issues were collected and destroyed with extreme efficacy in 1866, leaving only a few dozen intact.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="reemergence-of-paper-money">Reemergence of paper money</h2>
<p>The negative perception created by the issue of paper money between 1813 and 1815, brought the production of banknotes to a halt, while only coins circulated in the archipelago.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> In 1865, the Spanish Civil Code was imposed in Puerto Rico. Meanwhile, the <em>Caja de Ahorros</em> was founded in San Juan, a small bank, which provided an annual interest of up to 6% to its subscribers.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> The institution was bankrupted in 1879, but its business model was followed by other banks founded in the southern region of Puerto Rico. The <em>Caja de Ahorros de Ponce</em> (lit. &quot;Ponce Savings Bank&quot;) was founded in 1873 and continued in business until 1879.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> The institution issued notes in denominations of 1, 3, 5 and 50 <em>pesos</em> which were printed by the P.W.

These bills were only printed in one side and were signed by members of the bank's board of directors, which was composed by eminent Puerto Rican citizens.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> These were redeemed mostly in Ponce and co-existed along tokens issued by local business entities.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1868, the Central Republican Board of Cuba and Puerto Rico was founded. The group organized expeditions to Cuba, offering supplies to movements that supported the independence of Puerto Rico and Cuba.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> Founded by Jos&lt;U+00E9&gt; Francisco Basora, a Puerto Rican revolutionary and friend of <a href="Ram&lt;U+00F3&gt;n_Emeterio_Betances" title="wikilink">Ram&lt;U+00F3&gt;n Emeterio Betances</a>, the group had connections within the wealthy sugar industry in the larger antille. Bonds for quantities of 100, 500 and 1,000 pesos were printed between June 1 and November 1, 1869, in order to cover the expenses of the two planned revolutions. On August 17, 1869, the board issued notes in denominations of 1, 5, 10 and 20 <em>pesos</em>, these were produced to establish an affordable alternative to the bonds.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> All of these issues circulated throughout North and South America as well as the Caribbean.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> Although they were widespread in the Spanish processions, their use was kept clandestine to avoid imprisonment by the royal authorities.

<h3 id="the-provincial-coin">The provincial coin</h3>
<p>Due to its strategic location, currencies from several countries began circulating in Puerto Rico and used as trade. The government often ordered the collection of these coins in exchange for exchange notes. The first of these took place in 1857, when a royal decree ordered the gathering of <em><a href="Currency_of_Venezuela#Pre-independence_currency" title="wikilink">macuquina</a></em> coins.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> These arrived to Puerto Rico in 1813, originally produced by Spain in <a href="Venezuela" class="uri" title="wikilink">Venezuela</a>. Due to Spanish manufacture, the exchange notes issued for the <em>macuquina</em> featured a 12.5 % discount, which left a significant deficit in the government's budget.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> A decade later, coins were brought from the <a href="Dominican_Republic" title="wikilink">Dominican Republic</a> to Puerto Rico. Consequently, the distribution of foreign coins received authorization.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> In 1879, the circulation of Mexican silver was approved in government and official entities, eventually allowing public distribution in 1881. However, some saw an opportunity for profit in this and bought <a href="Mexican_peso" title="wikilink">Mexican pesos</a> outside of Puerto Rico before importing them, in the process gaining an profit of up to 40 <em>centavos</em> per peso.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> In 1884, a number of different coins were countermarked with a <a href="fleur-de-lis" class="uri" title="wikilink">fleur-de-lis</a> for circulation on Puerto Rico. Spanish 2, 4 and 8 <em>reales</em>, and 5 and 10 centimos, <a href="Twenty-cent_piece_(United_States_coin)" title="wikilink">United States' 20 cents</a>, quarters, <a href="Half_dollar_(United_States_coin)" title="wikilink">halves</a> and <a href="Dollar_(United_States_coin)" title="wikilink">dollars</a> were all countermarked and used until they were redeemed in 1894. By 1895, the coins circulating in Puerto Rico were mostly Mexican silver, creating a shortage of currency. To resolve this, Spain issued a Royal Decree stating that the Mexican coins were to be replaced by ones minted in Madrid, with special coins created exclusively for Puerto Rico.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a> To execute this move, exchange notes in one-<em>peso</em> denomination were created. Once the exchange concluded in 1896, the provincial coin was already in circulation.<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> Silver 20 centavos and 1 peso coins were introduced in 1895, followed in 1896 by silver 5, 10 and 40 centavos. The 1 peso coins bore the denomination as &quot;1 PESO = 5 P.TAS&quot;. These exchanges heavily affected the government's economy.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a> Some years later, Ceredo Mill&lt;U+00E1&gt;n a commercial firm in San Juan obtained some of the now-obsolete Exchange Notes, which were converted into souvenirs and offered as gifts to their clients.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a></p>

<p>On May 23, 1887, Maria Christina of Austria and Victor Balaguer, Spain's Overseas Minister, signed a royal decree proposing the creation of a royal bank in Puerto Rico.<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a> A waiting period of three months was imposed to those interested in pursuing the project, who had to present a business proposal as dictated by the order.

<p>On May 5, 1888, a second royal decree was issue, officializing the creation of the <em>Banco Espa&lt;U+00F1&gt;ol de Puerto Rico</em>, which received a charter validity of 25 years. This grant of authority was awarded to Enrique Vijande y Loredo, Jos&lt;U+00E9&gt; Caldas y Caldas and Pablo Ubarri, the members composing this partnership.<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a> The bank wasn't established immediately, this was because the currency being used in Puerto Rico was Mexican silver, which created problems and delayed the establishment date until early 1890.

The requirements for establishing a bank under this grant of authority, demanded that at least three-fourths of the board of directors lived in Puerto Rico at least for a year.<a href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a> It took the group two years to meet these regulations, but in 1902 the First National Bank of Porto Rico was inaugurated, with Andr&lt;U+00E9&gt;s Crosas from San Juan serving as its president. The bank began issuing notes in denominations of 10, 20, 50 and 100 dollars which were manufactured by October 27, 1902, even before all of the requirements were met.<a href="#fn72" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref72"><sup>72</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="collection-value-and-numismatic-study">Collection value and numismatic study</h2>
<p>The remaining exemplars of Puerto Rican currency have gathered significant value with the years, particularly in the United States.<a href="#fn73" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref73"><sup>73</sup></a> The value of them within the collectors of that country is due to the special nature of the post-1898 issues. Since they were issued under the same Spanish provincial charter, the <a href="Bureau_of_Engraving_and_Printing" title="wikilink">Bureau of Engraving and Printing</a> classifies them as &quot;territorial&quot; currency, this being the only unit of exchange of this kind that is recognized by the <a href="United_States_Department_of_the_Treasury" title="wikilink">United States Department of the Treasury</a>.<a href="#fn74" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref74"><sup>74</sup></a></p>
<p>Objects from Puerto Rico are constantly featured in specialized magazines, in both national and international distribution.<a href="#fn75" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref75"><sup>75</sup></a> The Puerto Rican dollars that were collected by the government, were burned between January 16 - 24, 1925, drastically reducing the amount of surviving notes from the Bank of Puerto Rico.<a href="#fn76" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref76"><sup>76</sup></a> The <a href="Great_Depression" title="wikilink">Great Depression</a> reduced their numbers further, since necessity prevented the collection of <em>pesos</em> in large denominations.<a href="#fn77" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref77"><sup>77</sup></a> Thus less than five exemplars are known to exist of the 100 and 200 <em>peso</em> banknotes issued by <em>El Banco Espa&lt;U+00F1&gt;ol de Puerto Rico</em> and the 5 and 10 dollars Series F bills published by the Bank of Puerto Rico.<a href="#fn78" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref78"><sup>78</sup></a></p>
<p>Similarly, the other notes issued by this banks range from scarce to rare.<a href="#fn79" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref79"><sup>79</sup></a> The banknotes from the First National Bank of Porto Rico are particularly scarce, this is because the institution's issues didn't even reach quantities of 20. Only two bills from the $100 denomination have been known to survive, similarly two from the $20 issue are left, with one of them being acquired by <a href="Amon_G._Carter" title="wikilink">Amon G. Carter</a> before his death.<a href="#fn80" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref80"><sup>80</sup></a> Carter was known to exhibit the piece, but didn't make it available for sale. More than a dozen $10 banknotes survived, seldomly appearing at auctions.<a href="#fn81" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref81"><sup>81</sup></a> Other extremely rare banknotes include the 2 and 4 <em>real</em> notes of 1813 and all of the denominations issued by the <em>Caja de Ahorros de Ponce</em>.<a href="#fn82" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref82"><sup>82</sup></a> In contrast, the paper money used by the Puerto Rico Railroad Company is still known to appear occasionally in the market. Outside of these, the clandestine bills issued by the Central Republican Board of Cuba and Puerto Rico, range from scarce (5-<em>peso</em> bill) to extremely rare (20-<em>peso</em> notes).<a href="#fn83" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref83"><sup>83</sup></a></p>
<p>In Puerto Rico, the <em>Sociedad Numism&lt;U+00E1&gt;tica de Puerto Rico</em> (lit. &quot;Numismatic Society of Puerto Rico&quot;) was founded in 1949.<a href="#fn84" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref84"><sup>84</sup></a> The society is usually composed of 25 to 50 members and it focuses in collecting and distributing both coins and banknotes from Puerto Rico to interested collectors. An annual exhibition along the <em>Sociedad Filatelica de Puerto Rico</em> (lit. &quot;Philatelic Society of Puerto Rico&quot;) has been held in <a href="Plaza_Las_Am&lt;U+00E9&gt;ricas" title="wikilink">Plaza Las Am&lt;U+00E9&gt;ricas</a> since the commercial center's inauguration.<a href="#fn85" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref85"><sup>85</sup></a> Outside of this activity, Puerto Rican currency can be found locally in philatelic and numismatic as well as flea markets.<a href="#fn86" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref86"><sup>86</sup></a> At auctions, banknotes have been known to surpass bid that are up to 70,000 dollars. The collection of cardboard samples given by banks to numismatic merchants, has also been noted among enthusiasts.<a href="#fn87" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref87"><sup>87</sup></a></p>
