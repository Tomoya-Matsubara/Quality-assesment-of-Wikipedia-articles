<p>The <strong>Great Pyramid of <a href="Giza" class="uri" title="wikilink">Giza</a></strong> () is the oldest and last remaining of the <a href="Seven_Wonders_of_the_World" title="wikilink">Seven Wonders of the World</a>. Most Egyptologists agree the pyramid was constructed over a 20 year period concluding around 2560 <a href="Before_Christ" title="wikilink">BC</a>.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> It is generally believed the Great Pyramid was built as the tomb of <a href="Fourth_dynasty_of_Egypt" title="wikilink">Fourth dynasty</a> <a href="ancient_Egypt" title="wikilink">Egyptian</a> pharaoh <a href="Khufu_(pharaoh)" title="wikilink">Khufu</a> (<strong>Cheops</strong>), after whom it is sometimes called <strong>Khufu's Pyramid</strong> or the <strong>Pyramid of Khufu</strong>.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> Khufu's <a href="vizier" class="uri" title="wikilink">vizier</a>, <a href="Hemon" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hemon</a>, is credited as the architect of the Great Pyramid.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="historical-context">Historical context</h2>
<p>Believed by mainstream Egyptologists to have been constructed in approximately 20 years, the most widely accepted estimate for its date of completion is c. 2560 BCE.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> This date is loosely supported by archaeological findings which have yet to reveal a civilization (of sufficient population size or technical ability) older than the fourth dynasty in the area.</p>
<p>The Great Pyramid is the oldest and largest of the three pyramids in the <a href="Giza_Necropolis" title="wikilink">Giza Necropolis</a> bordering what is now <a href="Cairo" class="uri" title="wikilink">Cairo</a>, <a href="Egypt" class="uri" title="wikilink">Egypt</a> in Africa. It is the main part of a complex setting of buildings that included two mortuary temples in honor of Khufu (one close to the pyramid and one near the Nile), three smaller pyramids for Khufu's wives, an even smaller &quot;satellite&quot; pyramid, a raised causeway connecting the two temples, and small mastaba tombs surrounding the pyramid for nobles. One of the small pyramids contains the tomb of queen <a href="Hetepheres" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hetepheres</a> (discovered in 1925), sister and wife of Sneferu and the mother of Khufu. There was a town for the workers, including a cemetery, bakeries, a beer factory and a copper smelting complex. More buildings and complexes are being discovered by The Giza Mapping Project.</p>
<p>A few hundred meters south-west of the Great Pyramid lies the slightly smaller <a href="Pyramid_of_Khafre" title="wikilink">Pyramid of Khafre</a>, one of Khufu's successors who is believed to have built the <a href="Great_Sphinx_of_Giza" title="wikilink">Great Sphinx</a>, and a few hundred metres further south-west is the <a href="Pyramid_of_Menkaure" title="wikilink">Pyramid of Menkaure</a>, Khafre's successor, which is about half as tall. In modern day, the pyramid of Khafre is the tallest of the three pyramids since the Great Pyramid has lost about 30 feet of material from its tip. In ancient times, Khufu's pyramid was indeed taller, but even then, Khafre's pyramid appeared taller because its sides are at a steeper angle than Khufu's pyramid and it was constructed on higher ground.</p>

<h3 id="materials-and-workforce">Materials and workforce</h3>
<p>Many varied estimates have been made regarding the workforce needed to construct the Great Pyramid. <a href="Herodotus" class="uri" title="wikilink">Herodotus</a>, the <a href="Greece" title="wikilink">Greek</a> historian in the 5th century BC, estimated that construction may have required 20,000 workers for 20 years. Recent evidence has been found that suggests the workforce was in fact paid, which would require accounting and bureaucratic skills of a high order. <a href="Poland" title="wikilink">Polish</a> <a href="architect" class="uri" title="wikilink">architect</a> Wieslaw Kozinski believed that it took as many as 25 men to transport a 1.5-ton stone block. Based on this, he estimated the workforce to be 300,000 men on the construction site, with an enormous additional 60,000 off-site. 19th century Egyptologist <a href="William_Flinders_Petrie" title="wikilink">William Flinders Petrie</a> proposed that the workforce was largely composed not of slaves but of the rural Egyptian population, working during periods when the <a href="Nile" class="uri" title="wikilink">Nile</a> river was flooded and <a href="agriculture" title="wikilink">agricultural</a> activity suspended.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p><a href="Egyptology" title="wikilink">Egyptologist</a> <a href="Miroslav_Verner" title="wikilink">Miroslav Verner</a> posited that the labor was organized into a <a href="hierarchy" class="uri" title="wikilink">hierarchy</a>, consisting of two <em>gangs</em> of 1000 men, divided into five <em>zaa</em> or <em>phyle</em> of 200 men each, which may have been further divided according to the skills of the workers.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> Some research suggests alternate estimates to the accepted workforce size. For instance, <a href="mathematics" title="wikilink">mathematician</a> <a href="Kurt_Mendelssohn" title="wikilink">Kurt Mendelssohn</a> calculated that the workforce may have been 50,000 men at most, while <a href="Ludwig_Borchardt" title="wikilink">Ludwig Borchardt</a> and <a href="Louis_Croon" title="wikilink">Louis Croon</a> placed the number at 36,000. According to Verner, a workforce of no more than 30,000 was needed in the Great Pyramid's construction.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p>A construction management study carried out by the firm <a href="http://www.dmjmhn.aecom.com/">Daniel, Mann, Johnson, &amp; Mendenhall</a> in association with <a href="Mark_Lehner" title="wikilink">Mark Lehner</a> and other Egyptologists, estimates that the total project required an average workforce of 13,200 people and a peak workforce of 40,000. Without the use of pulleys, wheels, or iron tools, they surmise the Great Pyramid was completed from start to finish in approximately 10 years.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> Their critical path analysis study reveals estimates that the number of blocks used in construction was between 2-2.8 million (an average of 2.4 million), but settles on a reduced finished total of 2 million after subtracting the estimated area of the hollow spaces of the chambers and galleries.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> Most sources agree on this number of blocks somewhere above 2 million.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> The Egyptologists' calculations suggest the workforce could have sustained a rate of 180 blocks per hour (3 stones/minute) with ten hour work days for putting each individual block in place. They derived these estimates from construction projects that did not use modern machinery.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> This study fails to take into account however, especially when compared to modern third world construction projects, the logistics and craftsmanship time inherent in constructing a building of nearly unparalleled magnitude with such precision, or among other things, the use of up to 60-80 ton stones being quarried and transported a distance of over 500 miles.</p>
<p>In contrast, a Great Pyramid feasibility study relating to the quarrying of the stone was performed in 1978 by Technical Director Merle Booker of the Indiana Limestone Institute of America. Consisting of 33 quarries, the Institute is considered by many architects to be one of the world&lt;U+2019&gt;s leading authorities on limestone. Using modern equipment, the study concludes:</p>
<dl>

<dd>&lt;U+201C&gt;Utilizing the entire Indiana Limestone industry&lt;U+2019&gt;s facilities as they now stand [for 33 quarries], and figuring on tripling present average production, it would take approximately 27 years to quarry, fabricate and ship the total requirements.&lt;U+201D&gt;
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Booker points out the time study assumes sufficient quantities of railroad cars would be available without delay or downtime during this 27 year period and does not factor in the increasing costs of completing the work.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<p>The entire <a href="Giza_Plateau" title="wikilink">Giza Plateau</a> is believed to have been constructed over the reign of five pharaohs in less than a hundred years. Beginning with king Djoser who ruled from 2687-2667 BC, three other massive pyramids were built - the <a href="Step_pyramid" title="wikilink">Step pyramid</a> of Saqqara (believed to be the first Egyptian pyramid), the <a href="Bent_Pyramid" title="wikilink">Bent Pyramid</a>, and the <a href="Red_Pyramid" title="wikilink">Red Pyramid</a>. Also during this period (between 2686 and 2498 BC) the Wadi Al-Garawi dam which used an estimated 100,000 cubic meters of rock and rubble was built.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> Beginning with Saqqara, Egyptologist Barbara Mertz estimates nearly 700 pyramids were constructed in Egypt during a roughly 500 year period .<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<p>The accepted values by Egyptologists bear out the following result: 2,400,000 stones used &lt;U+00F7&gt; 20 years &lt;U+00F7&gt; 365 days per year &lt;U+00F7&gt; 10 work hours per day &lt;U+00F7&gt; 60 minutes per hour = 0.55 stones laid per minute.</p>
<p>Thus no matter how many workers were used or in what configuration, 1.1 blocks would have to be put in place every 2 minutes, ten hours a day, 365 days a year for twenty years to complete the Great Pyramid within this time frame. To use the same equation, but instead assuming the time of completion to be one hundred years instead of twenty, it would require 1.1 blocks to be set every ten minutes. This equation, however, does not include the time and labor required to design, plan, survey, and level the 13 acre site the Great Pyramid sits on. Nor does it include the construction time for the two other main pyramids on the site, the Sphinx, the temples, networks of causeways, several square miles of paving stones, the leveling of the entire Giza Plateau, the 35 boat pits carved out of solid bedrock, or several other highly laborious features.</p>

<p>There is good information concerning the location of the quarries, tools used to cut stone, transportation of the stone to the monument, leveling the foundation, and leveling the subsequent tiers of the developing superstructure. Workmen used copper chisels, drills, and saws to cut softer stone, such as most of the limestone. On the harder stones, such a granite, granodiorite, syenite, and basalt, could not be cut with copper tools alone; instead they were worked with time consuming methods like pounding with dolerite, drilling, and sawing with the aid of an abrasive, like quartzite sand. Blocks were transported by sledge lubricated by water. Leveling the foundation was accomplished by the use of water filled trenches.</p>
<p>The unknowns of pyramid construction revolve around the question of how the blocks were moved up the superstructure. There is no known accurate historical or archaeological evidence that definitively resolves this question. Therefore, most discussion on construction methods involves functional possibilities that are supported by limited historical and archaeological evidence.</p>
<p>Historical accounts for the construction of the Egyptian pyramids do little to point directly to definitive methods to lift the blocks; yet most Egyptologists refer to these accounts when discussing this portion of pyramid construction. The first historical accounts of the construction of these monuments come centuries after the era of pyramid construction, by <a href="Herodotus" class="uri" title="wikilink">Herodotus</a> in the 5th century BC and <a href="Diodorus_Siculus" title="wikilink">Diodorus Siculus</a> in the 1st century BC. <a href="Herodotus" class="uri" title="wikilink">Herodotus</a>' account states that <a href="http://alkestis.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text.jsp?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0126:book=2:chapter=125">1</a>.</p>

<dd>This pyramid was made like stairs, which some call steps and others, tiers. [2] When this, its first form, was completed, the workmen used short wooden logs as levers to raise the rest of the stones1 ; they heaved up the blocks from the ground onto the first tier of steps; [3] when the stone had been raised, it was set on another lever that stood on the first tier, and the lever again used to lift it from this tier to the next. [4] It may be that there was a new lever on each tier of steps, or perhaps there was only one lever, quite portable, which they carried up to each tier in turn; I leave this uncertain, as both possibilities were mentioned. [5] But this is certain, that the upper part of the pyramid was finished off first, then the next below it, and last of all the base and the lowest part. [6]

<dd>And &lt;U+2018&gt;tis said the stone was transported a great distance from Arabia, and that the edifices were raised by means of earthen ramps, since machines for lifting had not yet been invented in those days; and most surprising it is, that although such large structures were raised in an area surrounded by sand, no trace remains of either ramps or the dressing of the stones, so that it seems not the result of the patient labor of men, but rather as if the whole complex were set down entire upon the surrounding sand by some god. Now Egyptians try to make a marvel of these things, alleging that the ramps were made of salt and natron and that, when the river was turned against them, it melted them clean away and obliterated their every trace without the use of human labor. But in truth, it most certainly was not done this way! Rather, the same multitude of workmen who raised the mounds returned the entire mass again to its original place; for they say that three hundred and sixty thousand men were constantly employed in the prosecution of their work, yet the entire edifice was hardly finished at the end of twenty years (Murphy 1990)

<p><img src="Giza_pyramid_complex_(map).svg" title="fig:Map of Giza pyramid complex." alt="Map of Giza pyramid complex." width="500" /> Both <a href="Herodotus" class="uri" title="wikilink">Herodotus</a> and <a href="Diodorus_Siculus" title="wikilink">Diodorus Siculus</a>' writings are known to contain gross errors of fact and Siculus is routinely accused of borrowing from <a href="Herodotus" class="uri" title="wikilink">Herodotus</a>. <a href="Herodotus" class="uri" title="wikilink">Herodotus</a>' description of slave labor is one of the most persistent myths of the construction process, and <a href="Diodorus_Siculus" title="wikilink">Diodorus Siculus</a>' description of the shipment of the stone from Arabia is wildly incorrect. Since both accounts are known to be both false and true, it is impossible to select either technique from historical documents. However, these documents do give credit to both the levering and ramp methods.</p>
<p>Most Egyptologists acknowledge that ramps are the most tenable of the methods to raise the blocks, yet they acknowledge that it is an incomplete method which needs to be supplemented by another device. The method most accepted for assisting ramps is levering <a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> (Lehner 1997: 222). The archaeological record gives evidence of only small ramps and inclined causeways, not something that could have been used to construct even a majority of the monument. To add to the uncertainty, there is considerable evidence demonstrating that non-standardized or <em><a href="ad_hoc" title="wikilink">ad hoc</a></em> construction methods were used in pyramid construction (Arnold 1991: 98 <a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a>, Lehner 1997: 223).</p>
<p>Therefore, there are many proposed ramps and there is a considerable amount of discrepancy regarding what type of ramp was used to build the pyramids.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> One of the widely discredited ramping methods is the large straight ramp, and it is routinely discredited on functional grounds for its massive size, lack of archaeological evidence, huge labor cost, and other problems (Arnold 1991: 99, Lehner 1997: 215, Isler 2001: 213<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> However, the large straight ramp, seen in the picture above, is the only ramp design that can effectively build the entire monument. Other ramps serve to correct these problems of ramp size, yet either run into critiques of functionality, limited archaeological evidence, or the inability to construct the entire monument, mostly due to the limited space available at the top of the monument. There are zig-zagging ramps, Straight ramps utilizing the incomplete part of the superstructure (Arnold 1991), Spiraling ramps supported by the superstructure and spiraling ramps leaning on the monument as a large accretion, and spiraling ramps supported by the superstructure. <a href="Mark_Lehner" title="wikilink">Mark Lehner</a> speculated that a spiraling ramp, beginning in the stone <a href="quarry" class="uri" title="wikilink">quarry</a> to the southeast and continuing around the exterior of the pyramid, may have been used.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> The stone blocks may have been drawn on sleds along the ramps lubricated by water or milk.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> Yet each of these ramps are criticized for their inability to construct the entire monument. In other words, ramping methods work fine for most of the superstructure, but cannot create the top or the entire monument.</p>
<p>Levering methods are considered to be the most tenable solution to complement ramping methods, partially due to Herodotus' description; and partially to the <a href="Shadoof" class="uri" title="wikilink">Shadoof</a>; an irrigation device first depicted in Egypt during the New Kingdom, and found concomitantly with the Old Kingdom in Mesopotamia. In Lehner's (1997: 222) point of view, levers should be employed to lift the top 3% of the material of the superstructure. It is important to note that the top 4% of this material comprises of 1/3rd of the total height of the monument. In other words, in Lehner's view, levers should be employed to lift a small amount of material and a great deal of vertical height of the monument.</p>
<p>In the milieu of levering methods, there are those which lift the block incrementally, as in repeatedly prying up alternating sides of the block and inserting a wooden or stone shims to gradually move the stone up one course; and there are other methods that use a larger lever to move the block up one course in one lifting procedure. Since the discussion of construction techniques to lift the blocks attempts to resolve a gap in the archaeological and historical record with a plausible functional explanation, the following examples by Isler, Keable, and Hussey-Pailos <a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> list experimentally tested methods. Isler's method (1985, 1987) is an incremental method and, in the Nova experiment (1992), used wooden shims or cribbing. Isler <a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> was able to lift a block up one tier in approximately one hour and 30 minutes. Peter Hodges&lt;U+2019&gt; and Julian Keable&lt;U+2019&gt;s<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> method is similar to Isler's method and instead small manufactured concrete blocks as shims, wooden pallets, and a pit where their experimental tests were performed. Keable was able to perform his method in approximately 2 minutes. Scott Hussey-Pailos's (2005) method <a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> uses a simple levering device to lift a block up course in one movement. This method was tested with materials of less strength than historical analogs (tested with materials weaker than those available in ancient Egypt), a factor of safety of 2, and lifted a 2500 pound block up one course in under a minute. This method is presented as a levering device to work complimentary with Mark Lehner's idea of a combined ramp and levering techniques.</p>
<p>It has also been suggested that Egyptians might have moved the stones with wind power, relying on kites and pulleys rather than huge numbers of slaves. On <a href="June_23" title="wikilink">June 23</a>, <a href="2001" class="uri" title="wikilink">2001</a>, <a href="Caltech" class="uri" title="wikilink">Caltech</a> <a href="aeronautics" class="uri" title="wikilink">aeronautics</a> professor <a href="Mory_Gharib" title="wikilink">Mory Gharib</a> and a small team of undergraduates working in the <a href="California" class="uri" title="wikilink">California</a> desert raised a 6900 lb (3.1 tonne), 3 metre tall obelisk into a vertical position in 22 mph (35 km/h) winds in under 25 seconds. They used only a kite, a pulley system, and a support frame to demonstrate that <a href="wind_power" title="wikilink">wind power</a> can be harnessed to create large lifting forces. Maureen Clemmons first thought of this idea after seeing an image in <em><a href="Smithsonian_(magazine)" title="wikilink">Smithsonian</a></em> of some men raising an obelisk. Clemmons also found a <a href="frieze" class="uri" title="wikilink">frieze</a> that showed an unidentifiable wing pattern directly above some men and possible ropes.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="limestone-concrete-theory">Limestone concrete theory</h3>
<p><a href="Materials_Science" title="wikilink">Materials scientist</a> <a href="Joseph_Davidovits" title="wikilink">Joseph Davidovits</a> has posited that the blocks of the pyramid are not carved stone, but mostly a form of <a href="limestone" class="uri" title="wikilink">limestone</a> <a href="concrete" class="uri" title="wikilink">concrete</a> and that they 'cast' as with modern <a href="cement" class="uri" title="wikilink">cement</a><a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a>. According to this theory, soft limestone with a high <a href="kaolinite" class="uri" title="wikilink">kaolinite</a> content was quarried in the <a href="wadi" class="uri" title="wikilink">wadi</a> on the south of the Giza Plateau. The limestone was then dissolved in large, Nile-fed pools until it became a watery slurry. Lime (found in the ash of cooking fires) and <a href="natron" class="uri" title="wikilink">natron</a> (also used by the Egyptians in <a href="mummification" class="uri" title="wikilink">mummification</a>) was mixed in. The pools were then left to evaporate, leaving behind a moist, clay-like mixture. This wet &quot;concrete&quot; would be carried to the construction site where it would be packed into reusable wooden moulds and in a few days would undergo a chemical reaction similar to the 'setting' of cement. New blocks, he suggests, could be cast in place, on top of and pressed against the old blocks. Proof-of-concept tests using similar compounds were carried out at a <a href="geopolymer" class="uri" title="wikilink">geopolymer</a> institute in northern France and it was found that a crew of ten, working with simple hand tools, could build a structure of fourteen, 1.3- to 4.5-ton blocks in a couple of days. <a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a></p>
<p>Davidovits' method is not accepted by the academic mainstream. His method does not account for the stones in the monument not made from limestone: such as granite stones weighing well over 50 tons. Geologists have heavily scrutinized Davidovits results and concluded that his came from natural limestone quarried in the Mokattam Formation. <a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> The evidence is overwhelming that the stones used in the monument come from natural formations.</p>
<h2 id="layout">Layout</h2>
<p>Papyrus documents and existing cubit measuring rods give us the units of measure used to specify the plan of the pyramid and so it is thought that, at construction, the Great Pyramid was 280 Egyptian <a href="Ancient_Egyptian_weights_and_measures" title="wikilink">Old Royal Cubits</a> tall (146.6 <a href="metres" class="uri" title="wikilink">metres</a> or 481 <a href="feet" class="uri" title="wikilink">feet</a>), but with <a href="erosion" class="uri" title="wikilink">erosion</a> and the theft of its topmost stone (the <a href="pyramidion" class="uri" title="wikilink">pyramidion</a>) its current height is 455.21 feet approximately 138.8 m and that each base side was 440 (20.63 inch) royal <a href="cubit" title="wikilink">cubits</a>.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> Thus, the base was originally 231 m on a side and covered approximately <a href="1_E4_m&lt;U+00B2&gt;" title="wikilink">53,000 square metres</a> with an angle of 51.50.40 degrees (<a href="Ancient_Egyptian_units_of_measurement" title="wikilink">seked</a> = 5&lt;U+00BD&gt;)—close to the ideal for a stable pyramidal structure. Today each side has an approximate length of about 230.4 meters(755.8 feet). The reduction in size and area of the structure into its current rough-hewn appearance is due to the absence of its original polished casing stones, some of which measured up to two and a half metres thick and weighed more than 15 tonnes.</p>
<p>In the 14th century (1301 AD), a massive earthquake loosened many of the outer casing stones, which were then carted away by <a href="Bahri_dynasty" title="wikilink">Bahri Sultan</a> An-Nasir Nasir-ad-Din al-Hasan in 1356 in order to build mosques and fortresses in nearby Cairo; the stones can still be seen as parts of these structures to this day. Later explorers reported massive piles of rubble at the base of the pyramids left over from the continuing collapse of the casing stones which were subsequently cleared away during continuing excavations of the site. Nevertheless, many of the casing stones around the base of the Great Pyramid can be seen to this day in situ displaying the same workmanship and precision as has been reported for centuries.</p>
<p>The first precision measurements of the pyramid were done by <a href="William_Matthew_Flinders_Petrie" title="wikilink">Sir Flinders Petrie</a> in 1880&lt;U+2013&gt;82 and published as &quot;The Pyramids and Temples of Gizeh&quot;.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> Almost all reports are based on his measurements. Petrie found the pyramid is oriented 4' West of North and the second pyramid is similarly oriented. Petrie also found a different orientation in the core and in the casing ( &lt;U+2013&gt; 5 ft 16 in &lt;U+00B1&gt; 10&quot;). Petrie suggested a redetermination of north was made after the construction of the core, but a mistake was made, and the casing was built with a different orientation. This deviation from the north in the core, corresponding to the position of the stars b-Ursae Minoris and z-Ursae Majoris about 3,000 years ago, takes into account the precession of the axis of the Earth. A study by egyptologist Kate Spence, shows how the changes in orientation of 8 pyramids corresponds with changes of position of those stars through time. This would date the start of the construction of the pyramid at 2467 BC.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a></p>
<p>For four <a href="millennia" class="uri" title="wikilink">millennia</a> it was the <a href="World&#39;s_tallest_structures" title="wikilink">world's tallest building</a>, unsurpassed until the 160 metre tall spire of <a href="Lincoln_Cathedral" title="wikilink">Lincoln Cathedral</a> was completed c. 1300 AD. The accuracy of the pyramid's workmanship is such that the four sides of the base have a mean error of only 58 mm in length, and 1 <a href="arcminute" title="wikilink">minute</a> in <a href="angle" class="uri" title="wikilink">angle</a> from a perfect square.

<p>The pyramid was constructed of cut and dressed blocks of <a href="limestone" class="uri" title="wikilink">limestone</a>, <a href="basalt" class="uri" title="wikilink">basalt</a> or <a href="granite" class="uri" title="wikilink">granite</a>. The core was made mainly of rough blocks of low quality limestone taken from a quarry at the south of Khufu&lt;U+2019&gt;s Great Pyramid. These blocks weighed from two to four <a href="tonne" title="wikilink">tonnes</a> on average, with the heaviest used at the base of the pyramid. An estimated 2.4 million blocks were used in the construction. High quality limestone was used for the outer casing, with some of the blocks weighing up to 15 tonnes. This limestone came from Tura, about 8 miles away on the other side of the Nile. Granite quarried nearly 500 miles away in Aswan with blocks weighing as much as 60-80 tonnes, was used for the portcullis doors and relieving chambers.</p>
<p>The total mass of the pyramid is estimated at 5.9 million tonnes with a volume (including an internal hillock) believed to be <a href="1_E6_m&lt;U+00B3&gt;" title="wikilink">2,600,000 cubic metres</a>. The pyramid is the largest in Egypt and the tallest in the world. It is surpassed only by the <a href="Great_Pyramid_of_Cholula" title="wikilink">Great Pyramid of Cholula</a> in <a href="Puebla" class="uri" title="wikilink">Puebla</a>, <a href="Mexico" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mexico</a>, which, although much lower in height, occupies a greater volume.</p>
<p>At completion, the Great Pyramid was surfaced by white 'casing stones' – slant-faced, but flat-topped, blocks of highly polished white limestone. These caused the monument to shine brightly in the sun, making it visible from a considerable distance. Visibly all that remains is the underlying step-pyramid core structure seen today, but several of the casing stones can still be found around the base. The casing stones of the Great Pyramid and <a href="Khafre&#39;s_Pyramid" title="wikilink">Khafre's Pyramid</a> (constructed directly beside it) were cut to such optical precision as to be off true plane over their entire surface area by only 1/50th of an inch. They were fitted together so perfectly that the tip of a knife cannot be inserted between the joints even to this day.</p>
<p>The Great Pyramid differs in its internal arrangement from the other pyramids in the area. The greater number of passages and chambers, the high finish of parts of the work, and the accuracy of construction all distinguish it. The walls throughout the pyramid are totally bare and uninscribed, but there are inscriptions — or to be more precise, graffiti — believed to have been made by the workers on the stones before they were assembled. All the five relieving chambers are inscribed. The most famous inscription is one of the few that mentions the name of Khufu; it says &quot;year 17 of Khufu's reign&quot;. Although alternative theorists have suggested otherwise, given its precarious location it is hard to believe it could have been inscribed after construction; even Graham Hancock<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> accepted this, after Dr Hawass let him examine the inscription. Another inscription refers to &quot;the friends of Khufu&quot;, and probably was the name of one of the gangs of workers<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a>. Though this doesn't offer indisputable proof Khufu originated the construction of the Great Pyramid or when building began, it does appear however to clear any doubt he at least took part in some phase of its construction (or later repairs to an existing building) during his reign.</p>
<p>There are three known chambers inside the Great Pyramid. These are arranged centrally, on the vertical axis of the pyramid. The lowest chamber (the &quot;unfinished chamber&quot;) is cut into the bedrock upon which the pyramid was built. This chamber is the largest of the three, but totally unfinished, only rough-cut into the rock.</p>
<p>The middle chamber, or <em>Queen's Chamber</em>, is the smallest, measuring approximately 5.74 by 5.23 <a href="metre" title="wikilink">metres</a>, and 4.57 metres in height. Its eastern wall has a large angular doorway or niche, and two narrow shafts, about 20 centimeters wide, extending from the chamber towards the outer surface of the pyramid. These shafts were explored using a robot, <a href="Upuat_2" title="wikilink">Upuat 2</a>, created by <a href="Rudolph_Gattenbrink" title="wikilink">Rudolph Gattenbrink</a>. Upuat 2 discovered that these shafts were blocked by limestone &quot;doors&quot;. During <a href="http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2002/09/0910_020913_egypt_1.html">Pyramids Live: Secret Chambers Revealed</a>, National Geographic filmed the drilling of a small hole in the southern door only to find another larger door behind it. The northern passage (which was harder to navigate due to twists and turns) was <a href="http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2002/09/0923_020923_egypt.html">also found to have a door</a>. Egyptologist <a href="Mark_Lehner" title="wikilink">Mark Lehner</a> believes that the Queen's chamber was intended as a <em>serdab</em>—a structure found in several other Egyptian pyramids—and that the niche would have contained a statue of the interred. The Ancient Egyptians believed that the statue would serve as a &quot;back up&quot; vessel for the <a href="Egyptian_soul#Ka_.28corporal_presence.2Flife_force.29" title="wikilink">Ka</a> of the Pharaoh, should the original mummified body be destroyed. The true purpose of the chamber, however, remains a mystery.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a></p>
<p>At the end of the lengthy series of entrance ways leading into the pyramid interior is the structure's main chamber, the <em>King's Chamber</em>. This chamber was originally 10 x 20 x 5V5 cubits, or about 17 x 34 x 19 ft, roughly a double cube.</p>
<p>The other main features of the Great Pyramid consist of the Grand Gallery, the sarcophagus found in the King's Chamber, both ascending and descending passages, and the lowest part of the structure mentioned above, what is dubbed the &quot;unfinished chamber&quot;.</p>
<p>The Grand Gallery (49 x 3 x 11 m) features an ingenious corbel halloed design and several cut &quot;sockets&quot; spaced at regular intervals along the length of each side of its raised base with a &quot;trench&quot; running along its center length at floor level. What purpose these sockets served is unknown. The Red Pyramid of Dashur also exhibits grand galleries of similar design.</p>
<p>The sarcophagus of the King's chamber was hollowed out of a single piece of Red Aswan granite and has been found to be too large to fit through the passageway leading to the King's chamber. Whether the sarcophagus was ever intended to house a body is unknown, but it is too short to accommodate a medium height individual without the bending of the knees (a technique not practised in Egyptian burial) and no lid was ever found.</p>
<p>The &quot;unfinished chamber&quot; lies 90 ft below ground level and is rough-hewn, lacking the precision of the other chambers. This chamber is dismissed by Egyptologists as being nothing more than a simple change in plans in that it was intended to be the original burial chamber but later King Khufu changed his mind wanting it to be higher up in the pyramid.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> Given the extreme precision and planning given to every other phase of the Great Pyramid's construction, this conclusion seems surprising.</p>
<p>Two French amateur Egyptologists, Gilles Dormion and Jean-Yves Verd'hurt, claimed in August 2004 that they had discovered a previously unknown chamber inside the pyramid underneath the Queen's Chamber using ground-penetrating radar and architectural analysis. The believe the chamber to be unviolated and could contain the king's remains. They believe the King's Chamber, the chamber generally assumed to be Khufu's original resting place, was not constructed to be a burial chamber.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="dating-evidence">Dating evidence</h2>
<p>The <a href="Edgar_Cayce" title="wikilink">Edgar Cayce</a> Foundation, researching claims that the pyramids were at least 10,000 years old, funded the &quot;David H. Koch Pyramids Radiocarbon Project&quot; in 1984. The project took samples of organic material (such as ash and charcoal deposits) from several locations within the Great Pyramid, and other pyramids and monuments from the <a href="Old_Kingdom" title="wikilink">Old Kingdom</a> period (ca. <a href="3rd_millennium_BC" title="wikilink">3rd millennium BC</a>). These samples were subjected to <a href="radiocarbon_dating" title="wikilink">radiocarbon dating</a> to produce <a href="Before_Present" title="wikilink">calibrated date-equivalent</a> estimates of their age. This yielded results averaging 374 years earlier than the estimated historical date accepted by Egyptologists (2589 — 2504 BC) but still more recent than 10,000 years ago.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> An astronomical study by Kate Spence suggests the pyramid dates to 2467 BC.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a></p>
<p>A second dating in 1995 with new but similar material obtained dates ranging between 100-400 years earlier than those indicated by the historic record. This raised questions concerning the origin and date of the wood. Massive quantities of wood were used and burned, so to reconcile the earlier dates the authors of the study theorized that possibly &quot;old wood&quot; was used, assuming that wood was harvested from any source available, including old construction material from all over Egypt. It is also known, given the poor quality and relative scarcity of native Egyptian woods, that King Sneferu (and later Egyptian pharohs) imported fine woods from Lebanon and other countries such as Nubia for the creation of decorative furniture, royal boats (as found buried around the Giza Plateau), or other luxuries generally reserved for royalty<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a>. Mark Lehner points out that this was not without &quot;great cost&quot;<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a>. It is unknown, given the expense, effort, and value of such woods, if they were ever imported as an expendable source of industrial fuel, especially on such a large scale.</p>
<p>Project scientists based their conclusions on the evidence that some of the material in the 3rd Dynasty pyramid of Pharaoh Djoser and other monuments had been recycled, concluding that the construction of the pyramids marked a major depletion of Egypt's exploitable wood. Dating of more short-lived material around the pyramid (cloth, small fires, etc) yielded dates nearer to those indicated by historical records. As of yet the full data of the study has yet to be released<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> in which the authors insist more evidence is needed to settle this issue. In the absence of the &quot;old wood&quot; theory, the study admits &quot;The 1984 results left us with too little data to conclude that the historical chronology of the Old Kingdom was in error by nearly 400 years, but we considered this at least a possibility.&quot; <a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a></p>
<p>In his book <em>Voyages of the Pyramid Builders</em> <a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a>, <a href="Boston_University" title="wikilink">Boston University</a> geology professor <a href="Robert_M._Schoch" title="wikilink">Robert Schoch</a> details key anomalies in both radiocarbon studies; most notably that samples taken in 1984 from the upper courses of the Great Pyramid gave upper dates of 3809 B.C. (&lt;U+00B1&gt; 160yrs), nearly 1400yrs before the time of Khufu, while the lower courses provided dates ranging from 3090-2723 B.C (&lt;U+00B1&gt; 100-400yrs) which correspond much more closely to the time Khufu is believed to have reigned. Given that the data imply the pyramid was built (impossibly) from the top down, Dr. Schoch argues that if the information provided by the study is correct, it makes sense if it is assumed the pyramid was built and rebuilt in several stages suggesting later Pharaohs such as Khufu were only inheritors of an existing monument, not the original builders, and merely rebuilt or repaired previously constructed sections.</p>
<h2 id="alternative-theories">Alternative theories</h2>
<p>In common with many other monumental structures from antiquity, the Great Pyramid has over time been the subject of a great number of speculative or alternative theories, which put forward a variety of explanations about its origins, dating, construction and purpose. In support of these claims such accounts either rely upon novel reinterpretations of the available data from fields such as archaeology, history and astronomy, or appeal to <a href="mythology" title="wikilink">mythological</a>, <a href="mysticism" title="wikilink">mystical</a>, <a href="numerology" title="wikilink">numerological</a>, <a href="astrology" title="wikilink">astrological</a> and other <a href="esotericism" title="wikilink">esoteric</a> sources of knowledge, or some combination of these.</p>
<p>Such ideas have been part of popular culture since at least the turn of the 20th century and can be traced back among others to such figures as the early-twentieth century American <a href="psychic" class="uri" title="wikilink">psychic</a> <a href="Edgar_Cayce" title="wikilink">Edgar Cayce</a>, whose &quot;psychic channeling&quot; of &quot;Ra Ta&quot; purports to have conveyed that the pyramids were built by refugees from <a href="Atlantis" class="uri" title="wikilink">Atlantis</a>, and even to his predecessor <a href="Ignatius_Donnelly" title="wikilink">Ignatius Donnelly</a>. In recent years, some of the more widely-publicized writers of alternative theories include <a href="Graham_Hancock" title="wikilink">Graham Hancock</a>, <a href="Robert_Bauval" title="wikilink">Robert Bauval</a>, <a href="Adrian_Gilbert" title="wikilink">Adrian Gilbert</a> and Boston University geology professor <a href="Robert_M._Schoch" title="wikilink">Robert M. Schoch</a>. These have written extensive alternate theories about the age and origin of the Giza pyramids and the <a href="Great_Sphinx" title="wikilink">Sphinx</a>. While many Egyptologists and field scientists tend to dismiss such accounts out of hand as being a form of <a href="pseudoarchaeology" class="uri" title="wikilink">pseudoarchaeology</a> if only because the subject material does not conform to conventional wisdom, other specialists such as astronomy professor <a href="Ed_Krupp" title="wikilink">Ed Krupp</a> who have been involved in debate surrounding their ideas have attempted (though his claims have been rebutted by the authors and several others <a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> <a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a><a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a>) to offer astronomical refutations based on analyses of the presented evidence for several of their claims. <a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a></p>
<p>A common theme found in many of the alternative theories put forward concerning the Giza pyramids and many other megalithic sites around the world, is the suggestion that these are not the products of the civilizations and cultures known to conventional history, but are instead the much older remnants of some hitherto unknown advanced ancient culture. This progenitor civilization is supposed to have been destroyed in antiquity by some devastating catastrophe brought about by the end of the last ice age, according to most of these accounts sometime around 10,500 BC. For the Great Pyramid of Giza in particular, it is maintained (depending on the theorist) that either it was ordained and built by this now-vanished civilization, or else that its construction was somehow influenced by knowledge (now lost) acquired from this civilization. The latter point of view is more common among recent theorists such as Hancock and Bauval, who have acknowledged that the Great Pyramid incorporates star shafts 'locked in' to Orion's Belt and Sirius at around 2450 BC, though they argue the Giza ground-plan was laid out in 10,450 BC. <a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a></p>
<p>The <em>a priori</em> existence of such a civilization is postulated by such theorists who believe this is the only reasonable explanation how the most advanced of ancient historical cultures, such as Egypt and Sumer, were able to reach such high levels of unequaled technological advancement from their very beginnings with what might appear to be little or no precedent. This precedent they argue is not unknown, but found all over the globe in the form of megalithic ruins discovered at the beginnings of history but too complex they argue to have been constructed by the cultures they are ascribed to by the mainstream. As another of these theorists John Anthony West writes in reference to Egypt in particular: &quot;How does a complex civilization spring full blown into being? Look at a 1905 automobile and compare it to a modern one. There is no mistaking the process of 'development'. But in Egypt there are no parallels. Everything is right there from the start.&quot;<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a></p>
