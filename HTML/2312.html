<p><strong>Wappocomo</strong> is a late 18th century <a href="Georgian_architecture" title="wikilink">Georgian</a> mansion and associated <a href="farm" class="uri" title="wikilink">farm</a> overlooking the <a href="Potomac_River#South_Branch_Potomac_River" title="wikilink">South Branch Potomac River</a> north of <a href="Romney,_West_Virginia" title="wikilink">Romney</a> in the U.S. state of <a href="West_Virginia" title="wikilink">West Virginia</a>. Wappocomo is located along Cumberland Road (<a href="West_Virginia_Route_28" title="wikilink">West Virginia Route 28</a>) and the <a href="South_Branch_Valley_Railroad" title="wikilink">South Branch Valley Railroad</a>.</p>
<p>The original section of the mansion at Wappocomo was built in 1774 by Nicholas Casey (1745&lt;U+2013&gt;1833), using bricks that had been used as <a href="ballast" class="uri" title="wikilink">ballast</a> to stabilize ships loading tobacco in the <a href="James_River" title="wikilink">James River</a>. The Wappocomo property had been a part of the &quot;South Branch Survey&quot; of <a href="Thomas_Fairfax,_6th_Lord_Fairfax_of_Cameron" title="wikilink">Thomas Fairfax, 6th Lord Fairfax of Cameron</a>'s <a href="Northern_Neck_Proprietary" title="wikilink">Northern Neck Proprietary</a>. The Parsons family, prominent in <a href="Virginia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Virginia</a> and West Virginia politics in the 18th and 19th centuries, acquired Wappocomo and continue to maintain ownership of the property into the 21st century.</p>
<p>Wappocomo was involved in two slavery-related disputes that caused friction between the governments of <a href="Pennsylvania" class="uri" title="wikilink">Pennsylvania</a> and Virginia. In 1788, Nicholas Casey purchased a freed slave by the name of John, who had been kidnapped in Pennsylvania and returned into slavery in Virginia. <a href="List_of_Governors_of_Pennsylvania" title="wikilink">Pennsylvania Governor</a> <a href="Thomas_Mifflin" title="wikilink">Thomas Mifflin</a> demanded that the <a href="Governor_of_Virginia" title="wikilink">Governor of Virginia</a> punish the three Virginia residents responsible for the abduction and re-enslavement of a <a href="freedman" class="uri" title="wikilink">freedman</a>, however, Virginia's governor cited the absence of such a clause in the <a href="United_States_Constitution" title="wikilink">United States Constitution</a>. In August 1855, a <a href="fugitive_slave" title="wikilink">fugitive slave</a> named Jacob Green escaped from Wappocomo with several other slaves to Pennsylvania. Col. <a href="Isaac_Parsons_(American_military_officer)" title="wikilink">Isaac Parsons</a> (1814&lt;U+2013&gt;62) and his nephews went north to pursue the escapees, resulting in the arrest of his nephew, James &quot;Zip&quot; Parsons III (1831&lt;U+2013&gt;93). Parsons' trial caused a further dispute between the states of Virginia and Pennsylvania over the latter's refusal to execute the <a href="Fugitive_Slave_Act_of_1850" title="wikilink">Fugitive Slave Act of 1850</a>.</p>
<p>The mansion at Wappocomo is unique among the historic residences along the South Branch Potomac River, in that its formal <a href="facade" title="wikilink">fa&lt;U+00E7&gt;ade</a> faces toward the road and the western flanks of <a href="South_Branch_Mountain" title="wikilink">South Branch Mountain</a> rather than toward the river. The original 1774 portion of the mansion is a square two-story Georgian-style structure, an architectural style prevalent in Virginia at the time of Wappocomo's construction. The bricks used to build the 1774 structure were manufactured in <a href="England" class="uri" title="wikilink">England</a>, and used as <a href="ballast" class="uri" title="wikilink">ballast</a> to stabilize ships loading tobacco in the <a href="James_River" title="wikilink">James River</a>. The interior of the 1774 structure contains a grand stairway in the center hall and all the original handmade woodworking. A stone addition to the mansion with two stories of deep <a href="veranda" title="wikilink">verandas</a> was completed in 1861. The principal <a href="Train_station" title="wikilink">passenger depot</a> for the <a href="Potomac_Eagle_Scenic_Railroad" title="wikilink">Potomac Eagle Scenic Railroad</a>, Wappocomo Station, is located at the farm.</p>

<p>The original 1774 portion of the mansion is a square two-story <a href="Georgian_architecture" title="wikilink">Georgian</a>-style structure with a basement and attic, an architectural style prevalent in Virginia at the time of Wappocomo's construction.<a href="#fn121" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref121"><sup>121</sup></a> This part of the mansion is built of large weighted ballast bricks, with walls that measure  in depth, allowing for deep inset windows.<a href="#fn122" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref122"><sup>122</sup></a> It also features two inside chimneys on either side, which once stood higher above its steep roof.<a href="#fn123" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref123"><sup>123</sup></a> The mansion's formal entrance is covered by a small <a href="portico" class="uri" title="wikilink">portico</a> supported with wooden columns and <a href="engaged_column" title="wikilink">engaged columns</a> at the wall.<a href="#fn124" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref124"><sup>124</sup></a></p>
<p>Other historic homes located along the South Branch Potomac River face the river; the mansion at Wappocomo is unique in that its formal <a href="facade" title="wikilink">fa&lt;U+00E7&gt;ade</a> faces toward Cumberland Road (<a href="West_Virginia_Route_28" title="wikilink">West Virginia Route 28</a>) and the western flanks of <a href="South_Branch_Mountain" title="wikilink">South Branch Mountain</a>. This may be due in part to the house's distance from the river, approximately .

<p>The home's wooden <a href="sill_plate" title="wikilink">sill plates</a> and <a href="joists" class="uri" title="wikilink">joists</a> were sawed by hand and the &quot;rot nails&quot; used for their construction were manufactured in the blacksmith shop on the Wappocomo plantation.<a href="#fn126" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref126"><sup>126</sup></a> The residence at Wappocomo also features unusually high fireplace mantelpieces, wide grooved window <a href="Molding_(decorative)" title="wikilink">moldings</a> and casings with base panels, solid paneled doors, and interior woodworking throughout, all of which were handmade.<a href="#fn127" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref127"><sup>127</sup></a> Every room of the main structure originally contained a corner fireplace.<a href="#fn128" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref128"><sup>128</sup></a></p>

<p>The 1861 stone addition's two floors consisted of two large rooms on each floor, with  ceilings.
