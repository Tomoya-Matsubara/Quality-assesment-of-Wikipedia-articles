<p><strong>Charles Stoneham &quot;Chub&quot; Feeney</strong> (August 31, 1921 &lt;U+2014&gt; January 10, 1994) was an <a href="United_States" title="wikilink">American</a> front office executive in <a href="Major_League_Baseball" title="wikilink">Major League Baseball</a> and president of the <a href="National_League" title="wikilink">National League</a> (NL) during a 40-plus year career in <a href="baseball" class="uri" title="wikilink">baseball</a>.</p>
<p>Born in <a href="Orange,_New_Jersey" title="wikilink">Orange, New Jersey</a>, into a baseball family, Feeney was the grandson of <a href="Charles_Stoneham" title="wikilink">Charles Stoneham</a>, principal owner of the <a href="San_Francisco_Giants" title="wikilink">New York Giants</a> until his death in <a href="1936_in_baseball" title="wikilink">1936</a>, and the nephew of <a href="Horace_Stoneham" title="wikilink">Horace Stoneham</a>, who owned the team from 1936 through <a href="1976_in_baseball" title="wikilink">1976</a>. Feeney began his association with the Giants as a <a href="batboy" class="uri" title="wikilink">batboy</a>, and after his graduation from <a href="Dartmouth_College" title="wikilink">Dartmouth College</a> and military service during <a href="World_War_II" title="wikilink">World War II</a> he joined the team's front office at the age of 24 as vice president in <a href="1946_in_baseball" title="wikilink">1946</a>. Although he never held the official title of <a href="general_manager_(baseball)" title="wikilink">general manager</a>, Feeney would function as head of the Giants' baseball operations department for almost 24 years.</p>

<p>The postwar Giants were a second-division team of slow-footed sluggers with poor fielding and mediocre pitching. On July 16, 1948, Stoneham and Feeney made a dramatic change. They replaced <a href="manager_(baseball)" title="wikilink">manager</a> <a href="Mel_Ott" title="wikilink">Mel Ott</a>, a popular, <a href="Baseball_Hall_of_Fame" title="wikilink">Hall of Fame</a> hitter and lifelong Giant, with the controversial and abrasive <a href="Leo_Durocher" title="wikilink">Leo Durocher</a>, who had been managing their interborough rivals, the <a href="Los_Angeles_Dodgers" title="wikilink">Brooklyn Dodgers</a>. Asked by Stoneham to evaluate his new team, Durocher, no sentimentalist, reportedly replied: &quot;Back up the truck&quot; &lt;U+2014&gt; meaning wholesale changes were needed. Within 1&lt;U+00BD&gt; years &lt;U+2014&gt; and with the decision to follow Brooklyn in breaking the <a href="baseball_color_line" title="wikilink">color line</a> &lt;U+2014&gt; Durocher, Stoneham and Feeney's front office had built the Giants into a hard-playing, balanced team of pitching, hitting, speed and defense.</p>
<p>In <a href="1951_in_baseball" title="wikilink">1951</a>, the Giants battled back from a 13&lt;U+00BD&gt; game deficit on August 11, winning 37 of their last 44 games to force a best-of-three pennant playoff with Brooklyn. After splitting the first two games, the Giants overcame one last hurdle &lt;U+2014&gt; a 4-1, ninth-inning Brooklyn lead in Game 3 &lt;U+2014&gt; to beat the Dodgers on <a href="Bobby_Thomson" title="wikilink">Bobby Thomson</a>'s three-run <a href="home_run" title="wikilink">home run</a>, baseball's version of the &quot;<a href="Shot_Heard_&#39;Round_the_World_(baseball)" title="wikilink">Shot Heard 'Round the World</a>.&quot; The Giants had won their first National League pennant since <a href="1937_in_baseball" title="wikilink">1937</a>, but they dropped the <a href="1951_World_Series" title="wikilink">1951 World Series</a> in six games to the <a href="New_York_Yankees" title="wikilink">New York Yankees</a>.</p>
<p>Brooklyn dominated the NL for the next two seasons, but, in <a href="1954_in_baseball" title="wikilink">1954</a>, Durocher's Giants &lt;U+2014&gt; led by <a href="batting_average" title="wikilink">batting champion</a> <a href="Willie_Mays" title="wikilink">Willie Mays</a> and the runner-up, <a href="Don_Mueller" title="wikilink">Don Mueller</a> &lt;U+2014&gt; emerged as champions, winning the pennant by five games. They drew the <a href="Cleveland_Indians" title="wikilink">Cleveland Indians</a>, who had set an <a href="American_League" title="wikilink">American League</a> record by winning 111 games, as their opponents in the <a href="1954_World_Series" title="wikilink">1954 World Series</a>. But the Giants won in four straight games, highlighted by Mays' <a href="The_Catch_(baseball)" title="wikilink">game-saving catch</a> of <a href="Vic_Wertz" title="wikilink">Vic Wertz</a>' long drive in Game 1, the clutch hitting of obscure <a href="outfielder" class="uri" title="wikilink">outfielder</a> and <a href="pinch_hitter" title="wikilink">pinch hitter</a> <a href="Dusty_Rhodes_(baseball_player)" title="wikilink">Dusty Rhodes</a>, and effective pitching from four different starters.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the 1954 Fall Classic was the last highlight of the Giants' 70-plus year history in <a href="New_York_City" title="wikilink">New York</a>. Attendance plunged in the years that immediately followed, and after Durocher's resignation in <a href="1955_in_baseball" title="wikilink">1955</a> to become a &quot;Game of the Week&quot; baseball broadcaster, the team played poorly. By <a href="1957_in_baseball" title="wikilink">1957</a>, owner Stoneham had decided to leave for greener pastures, ultimately choosing <a href="San_Francisco,_California" title="wikilink">San Francisco</a> as the team's destination to preserve its historic rivalry with the Dodgers, who simultaneously moved to <a href="Los_Angeles,_California" title="wikilink">Los Angeles</a>.</p>
<h2 id="contenders-and-mainly-bridesmaids-in-san-francisco">Contenders, and mainly bridesmaids, in San Francisco</h2>
<p>The Giants returned to the first division upon moving to the <a href="West_Coast_of_the_United_States" title="wikilink">West Coast</a>, led by players produced by the club's <a href="Farm_team" title="wikilink">farm system</a>. Feeney and the team's farm director, <a href="Carl_Hubbell" title="wikilink">Carl Hubbell</a>, the Hall of Fame <a href="pitcher" class="uri" title="wikilink">pitcher</a>, had stocked the team with outstanding young talent &lt;U+2014&gt; especially <a href="African-American" class="uri" title="wikilink">African-American</a> and <a href="Latin-American" class="uri" title="wikilink">Latin-American</a> players, exploiting lingering prejudice by most other major league clubs. The Giants were the first team to sign players from the <a href="Dominican_Republic" title="wikilink">Dominican Republic</a>, bringing to San Francisco stars such as <a href="Juan_Marichal" title="wikilink">Juan Marichal</a>, <a href="Felipe_Alou" title="wikilink">Felipe Alou</a> and <a href="Matty_Alou" title="wikilink">Matty Alou</a>. The Giants also were the first MLB team to sign a player from <a href="Japan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Japan</a>, <a href="Masanori_Murakami" title="wikilink">Masanori Murakami</a>, who debuted in <a href="1964_in_baseball" title="wikilink">1964</a>.</p>
<p>In <a href="1962_in_baseball" title="wikilink">1962</a>, the Giants and Dodgers engaged in a West Coast-version of the 1951 pennant chase. Los Angeles built an early lead, but began to fall to earth when ace left-hander <a href="Sandy_Koufax" title="wikilink">Sandy Koufax</a> was sidelined for the season by a finger ailment. By season's end, the teams were deadlocked, at 101 wins and 61 defeats. Again, a best-of-three playoff would determine the champion, and &lt;U+2014&gt; again &lt;U+2014&gt; the Giants would rally in the ninth inning of Game 3 to beat the Dodgers. But the deciding game was played in Los Angeles, thus the winning run &lt;U+2014&gt; forced in by a bases-loaded walk &lt;U+2014&gt; was not a &quot;walk-off&quot; situation and lacked the drama of Thomson's home run. The Giants, as in '51, faced the Yankees in the <a href="1962_World_Series" title="wikilink">1962 World Series</a> and lost, this time in seven games.</p>
<p>Although San Francisco remained a first-division team, and frequent contender, during the rest of the 1960s, it did not win another pennant in the decade; in fact, the team won one division championship from 1969 through 1986 (<a href="1971_National_League_Championship_Series" title="wikilink">1971</a>), and did not appear in the World Series again until <a href="1989_World_Series" title="wikilink">1989</a>. It finished in second place for four successive seasons (1965&lt;U+2013&gt;1968). By <a href="1969_in_baseball" title="wikilink">1969</a>, the team was showing signs of age and decline. Concurrently, Feeney was being considered for prominent positions within Major League Baseball's hierarchy. After his candidacy for <a href="Commissioner_of_Baseball" title="wikilink">Commissioner of Baseball</a> fell short, Feeney succeeded <a href="Warren_Giles" title="wikilink">Warren Giles</a> as NL president late in 1969.</p>
<h2 id="president-of-the-national-league">President of the National League</h2>
<p>During his 17-year (1969&lt;U+2013&gt;86) presidency, the National League continued its dominance of the <a href="Major_League_Baseball_All-Star_Game" title="wikilink">All-Star Game</a>, losing only in <a href="1971_in_baseball" title="wikilink">1971</a>, <a href="1983_in_baseball" title="wikilink">1983</a> and <a href="1986_in_baseball" title="wikilink">1986</a> and winning 14 times, although the AL prevailed in the World Series, 9-8, during this period. Feeney rallied NL owners to resist adoption of the <a href="designated_hitter" title="wikilink">designated hitter</a> and presided over a period of stability, as the league neither expanded nor moved a franchise during his term. (Ironically, the NL team that came closest to moving was Stoneham's Giants, which were nearly sold to a <a href="Toronto" class="uri" title="wikilink">Toronto</a> consortium in 1976. The owner who saved the Giants for San Francisco in 1976, <a href="Bob_Lurie" title="wikilink">Bob Lurie</a>, nearly moved the team to <a href="St._Petersburg,_Florida" title="wikilink">St. Petersburg, Florida</a> in <a href="1992_in_baseball" title="wikilink">1992</a>.)</p>
<p>Just before his tenure as NL president ended, he made an appearance on <em><a href="Jeopardy!" class="uri" title="wikilink">Jeopardy!</a></em> in the show's second season in 1986.</p>
<p>As he passed his 65th birthday, Feeney was succeeded as NL president by <a href="A._Bartlett_Giamatti" title="wikilink">A. Bartlett Giamatti</a>. His baseball career concluded with a 15-month tour as president of the <a href="San_Diego_Padres" title="wikilink">San Diego Padres</a> (1987&lt;U+2013&gt;88), which ended with his resignation the day after he made an obscene gesture to hecklers on Fan Appreciation Night in San Diego on September 24, 1988.</p>
<p>He died in January 1994 of a <a href="myocardial_infarction" title="wikilink">heart attack</a> in San Francisco at the age of 72.</p>
