<p><strong>Alan Mathison Turing</strong>, <a href="Order_of_the_British_Empire" title="wikilink">OBE</a> (<a href="June_23" title="wikilink">June 23</a>, <a href="1912" class="uri" title="wikilink">1912</a> – <a href="June_7" title="wikilink">June 7</a>, <a href="1954" class="uri" title="wikilink">1954</a>) was an <a href="England" title="wikilink">English</a> <a href="mathematician" class="uri" title="wikilink">mathematician</a>, <a href="logician" class="uri" title="wikilink">logician</a>, and <a href="cryptographer" class="uri" title="wikilink">cryptographer</a>.</p>
<p>Turing is often considered to be the father of modern <a href="computer_science" title="wikilink">computer science</a>. Turing provided an influential formalisation of the concept of the <a href="algorithm" class="uri" title="wikilink">algorithm</a> and computation with the <a href="Turing_machine" title="wikilink">Turing machine</a>, formulating the now widely accepted &quot;Turing&quot; version of the <a href="Church&lt;U+2013&gt;Turing_thesis" title="wikilink">Church&lt;U+2013&gt;Turing thesis</a>, namely that any practical computing model has either the equivalent or a subset of the capabilities of a Turing machine. With the <a href="Turing_test" title="wikilink">Turing test</a>, he made a significant and characteristically provocative contribution to the debate regarding <a href="artificial_intelligence" title="wikilink">artificial intelligence</a>: whether it will ever be possible to say that a machine is <a href="consciousness" title="wikilink">conscious</a> and can <a href="thought" title="wikilink">think</a>. He later worked at the <a href="National_Physical_Laboratory,_UK" title="wikilink">National Physical Laboratory</a>, creating one of the first designs for a stored-program computer, although it was never actually built. In 1947 he moved to the <a href="Victoria_University_of_Manchester" title="wikilink">University of Manchester</a> to work, largely on software, on the <a href="Manchester_Mark_I" title="wikilink">Manchester Mark I</a>, then emerging as one of the world's earliest true computers.</p>
<p>During the <a href="World_War_II" title="wikilink">Second World War</a>, Turing worked at <a href="Bletchley_Park" title="wikilink">Bletchley Park</a>, Britain's <a href="cryptanalysis" title="wikilink">codebreaking</a> centre, and was for a time head of <a href="Hut_8" title="wikilink">Hut 8</a>, the section responsible for German naval cryptanalysis. He devised a number of techniques for breaking German ciphers, including the method of the <a href="bombe" class="uri" title="wikilink">bombe</a>, an electromechanical machine that could find settings for the <a href="Enigma_machine" title="wikilink">Enigma machine</a>.</p>
<p>In 1952, Turing was convicted of &quot;acts of gross indecency&quot; after admitting to a sexual relationship with a man in Manchester. He was placed on probation and required to undergo <a href="hormone_therapy" title="wikilink">hormone therapy</a>. Turing died after eating an apple laced with <a href="cyanide" class="uri" title="wikilink">cyanide</a> in 1954. His death was ruled as suicide.</p>
<h2 id="childhood-and-youth">Childhood and youth</h2>
<p>Turing was conceived in 1911 in Chatrapur, Orissa <a href="India" class="uri" title="wikilink">India</a>. His father, Julius Mathison Turing, was a member of the <a href="Indian_civil_service" title="wikilink">Indian civil service</a>. Julius and wife Sara (<em>n&lt;U+00E9&gt;e</em> Stoney; 1881&lt;U+2013&gt;1976, daughter of Edward Waller Stoney, chief engineer of the Madras Railways) wanted Alan to be brought up in <a href="England" class="uri" title="wikilink">England</a>, so they returned to <a href="Maida_Vale" title="wikilink">Maida Vale</a>,<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> <a href="London" class="uri" title="wikilink">London</a>, where Alan Turing was born <a href="June_23" title="wikilink">June 23</a>, <a href="1912" class="uri" title="wikilink">1912</a>, as recorded by a <a href="blue_plaque" title="wikilink">blue plaque</a> on the outside of the building, now the Colonnade Hotel.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a>&lt;ref name=&quot;turingorguk&gt;</ref> He had an elder brother, John. His father's civil service commission was still active, and during Turing's childhood years his parents travelled between <a href="Guildford" class="uri" title="wikilink">Guildford</a>, England and India, leaving their two sons to stay with friends in England, rather than risk their health in the British colony. Very early in life, Turing showed signs of the genius he was to display more prominently later. </p>
<p>His parents enrolled him at St Michael's, a day school, at the age of six. The headmistress recognised his genius early on, as did many of his subsequent educators. In 1926, at the age of 14, he went on to <a href="Sherborne_School" title="wikilink">Sherborne School</a> in <a href="Dorset" class="uri" title="wikilink">Dorset</a>. His first day of term coincided with a <a href="general_strike" title="wikilink">general strike</a> in England, and so determined was he to attend his first day that he rode his bike unaccompanied more than 60 miles from <a href="Southampton" class="uri" title="wikilink">Southampton</a> to school, stopping overnight at an inn &lt;U+2014&gt; a feat reported in the local press.</p>
<p>Turing's natural inclination toward mathematics and science did not earn him respect with the teachers at Sherborne, a famous and expensive <a href="public_school_(England)" title="wikilink">public school</a>, whose definition of education placed more emphasis on the <a href="classics" class="uri" title="wikilink">classics</a>. His headmaster wrote to his parents: &quot;I hope he will not fall between two schools. If he is to stay at public school, he must aim at becoming <em>educated</em>. If he is to be solely a <em>Scientific Specialist</em>, he is wasting his time at a public school&quot;.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>Despite this, Turing continued to show remarkable ability in the studies he loved, solving advanced problems in 1927 without having even studied elementary <a href="calculus" class="uri" title="wikilink">calculus</a>. In 1928, aged 16, Turing encountered <a href="Albert_Einstein" title="wikilink">Albert Einstein</a>'s work; not only did he grasp it, but he extrapolated Einstein's questioning of <a href="Newton&#39;s_laws_of_motion" title="wikilink">Newton's laws of motion</a> from a text in which this was never made explicit.</p>

</figure>
<p>Turing's hopes and ambitions at school were raised by his strong feelings for his friend Christopher Morcom, with whom he fell in love, though the feeling was not reciprocated. Morcom died suddenly only a few weeks into their last term at Sherborne, from complications of <a href="bovine" class="uri" title="wikilink">bovine</a> <a href="tuberculosis" class="uri" title="wikilink">tuberculosis</a>, contracted after drinking infected cow's milk as a boy.</p>
<h2 id="university-and-his-work-on-computability">University and his work on computability</h2>
<p>Turing's unwillingness to work as hard on his classical studies as on science and mathematics meant he failed to win a scholarship to <a href="Trinity_College,_Cambridge" title="wikilink">Trinity College, Cambridge</a>, and went on to the college of his second choice, <a href="King&#39;s_College,_Cambridge" title="wikilink">King's College, Cambridge</a>. He was an undergraduate from 1931 to 1934, graduating with a distinguished degree, and in 1935 was elected a fellow at King's on the strength of a dissertation on the Gaussian <a href="error_function" title="wikilink">error function</a>.</p>
<p><img src="Turingbus.jpg" title="fig:Alan Turing, on the steps of the bus, with members of the Walton Athletic Club, 1946." alt="Alan Turing, on the steps of the bus, with members of the Walton Athletic Club, 1946." width="320" /> In his momentous paper &quot;On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the <em><a href="Entscheidungsproblem" class="uri" title="wikilink">Entscheidungsproblem</a></em>&quot; (submitted on <a href="May_28" title="wikilink">May 28</a>, <a href="1936" class="uri" title="wikilink">1936</a>), Turing reformulated <a href="Kurt_G&lt;U+00F6&gt;del" title="wikilink">Kurt G&lt;U+00F6&gt;del</a>'s 1931 results on the limits of proof and computation, substituting G&lt;U+00F6&gt;del's universal arithmetic-based formal language by what are now called <a href="Turing_machine" title="wikilink">Turing machines</a>, formal and simple devices. He proved that such a machine would be capable of performing any conceivable mathematical problem if it were representable as an <a href="algorithm" class="uri" title="wikilink">algorithm</a>, even if no actual Turing machine would be likely to have practical applications, being much slower than alternatives.</p>
<p>Turing machines are to this day the central object of study in <a href="computation" title="wikilink">theory of computation</a>. He went on to prove that there was no solution to the <em><a href="Entscheidungsproblem" class="uri" title="wikilink">Entscheidungsproblem</a></em> by first showing that the <a href="halting_problem" title="wikilink">halting problem</a> for Turing machines is <a href="undecidable" class="uri" title="wikilink">undecidable</a>: it is not possible to decide algorithmically whether a given Turing machine will ever halt. While his proof was published subsequent to <a href="Alonzo_Church" title="wikilink">Alonzo Church</a>'s equivalent proof in respect to his <a href="lambda_calculus" title="wikilink">lambda calculus</a>, Turing's work is considerably more accessible and intuitive. It was also novel in its notion of a &quot;Universal (Turing) Machine&quot;, the idea that such a machine could perform the tasks of any other machine. The paper also introduces the notion of <a href="definable_number" title="wikilink">definable numbers</a>.</p>
<p>Most of 1937 and 1938 he spent at <a href="Princeton_University" title="wikilink">Princeton University</a>, studying under Alonzo Church. In 1938 he obtained his <a href="Doctor_of_Philosophy" title="wikilink">Ph.D.</a> from Princeton; his dissertation introduced the notion of relative computing where Turing machines are augmented with so-called <a href="oracle_machine" title="wikilink">oracles</a>, allowing a study of problems that cannot be solved by a Turing machine.</p>
<p>Back in Cambridge in 1939, he attended lectures by <a href="Ludwig_Wittgenstein" title="wikilink">Ludwig Wittgenstein</a> about the <a href="foundations_of_mathematics" title="wikilink">foundations of mathematics</a>.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> The two argued and disagreed, with Turing defending <a href="formalism" class="uri" title="wikilink">formalism</a> and Wittgenstein arguing that mathematics is overvalued and does not discover any absolute truths.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="cryptanalysis">Cryptanalysis</h2>
<p><img src="Turing_flat.jpg" title="fig:Two cottages in the stable yard at Bletchley Park. Turing worked here from 1939&lt;U+2013&gt;1940 until he moved to Hut 8." alt="Two cottages in the stable yard at Bletchley Park. Turing worked here from 1939&lt;U+2013&gt;1940 until he moved to Hut 8." width="240" /> During the <a href="Second_World_War" title="wikilink">Second World War</a>, Turing was a main participant in the efforts at <a href="Bletchley_Park" title="wikilink">Bletchley Park</a> to break German ciphers. Building on cryptanalysis work carried out in Poland before the war, he contributed several insights into breaking both the <a href="Enigma_machine" title="wikilink">Enigma machine</a> and the <a href="Lorenz_SZ_40/42" title="wikilink">Lorenz SZ 40/42</a> (a teletype cipher attachment codenamed &quot;Tunny&quot; by the British), and was, for a time, head of <a href="Hut_8" title="wikilink">Hut 8</a>, the section responsible for reading German naval signals.</p>
<p>Since September 1938, Turing had been working part-time for the <a href="Government_Code_and_Cypher_School" title="wikilink">Government Code and Cypher School</a> (GCCS), the British codebreaking organisation. He worked on the problem of the German Enigma machine, and collaborated with <a href="Dilly_Knox" title="wikilink">Dilly Knox</a>, a senior GCCS codebreaker.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> On <a href="4_September" title="wikilink">4 September</a> <a href="1939" class="uri" title="wikilink">1939</a>, the day after Britain declared war on Germany, Turing reported to <a href="Bletchley_Park" title="wikilink">Bletchley Park</a>, the wartime station of GCCS.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>

<h3 id="the-turing-welchman-bombe">The Turing-Welchman bombe</h3>
<p>Within weeks of arriving at Bletchley Park,<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> Turing had devised an electromechanical machine which could help break Enigma: the <a href="bombe" class="uri" title="wikilink">bombe</a>, named after the Polish-designed <em><a href="Bomba_(cryptography)" title="wikilink">bomba</a></em>. The bombe, with an enhancement suggested by mathematician <a href="Gordon_Welchman" title="wikilink">Gordon Welchman</a>, became the primary tool used to read Enigma traffic.</p>
<p>The bombe searched for the correct settings of the Enigma rotors, and required a suitable &quot;<a href="crib_(cryptanalysis)" title="wikilink">crib</a>&quot;: a piece of matching <a href="plaintext" class="uri" title="wikilink">plaintext</a> and <a href="ciphertext" class="uri" title="wikilink">ciphertext</a>. For each possible setting of the rotors, the bombe performed a chain of logical deductions based on the crib, implemented electrically. The bombe detected when a contradiction had occurred, and ruled out that setting, moving onto the next. Most of the possible settings would cause contradictions and be discarded, leaving only a few to be investigated in detail. Turing's bombe was first installed on <a href="18_March" title="wikilink">18 March</a> <a href="1940" class="uri" title="wikilink">1940</a>.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> Over 200 bombes were in operation by the end of the war.</p>
<h3 id="hut-8-and-naval-enigma">Hut 8 and Naval Enigma</h3>
<p>In December 1940, Turing solved the naval Enigma indicator system, which was more complex than the indicator systems used by the other services. Turing also invented a <a href="Bayesian" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bayesian</a> statistical technique termed &quot;<a href="Banburismus" class="uri" title="wikilink">Banburismus</a>&quot; to assist in breaking Naval Enigma. Banburismus could rule out certain orders of the Enigma rotors, reducing time needed to test settings on the bombes.</p>
<p>In the spring of 1941, Turing proposed marriage to Hut 8 co-worker Joan Clarke, although the engagement was broken off by mutual agreement in the summer.</p>
<p>In July 1942, Turing devised a technique termed <em>Turingismus</em> or <em>Turingery</em> for use against the &quot;Fish&quot; Lorenz cipher. He also introduced the Fish team to <a href="Tommy_Flowers" title="wikilink">Tommy Flowers</a>, who went on to design the <a href="Colossus_computer" title="wikilink">Colossus computer</a>.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> A frequent misconception is that Turing was a key figure in the design of Colossus; this was not the case.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<p>Turing travelled to the United States in November 1942 and worked with US Navy cryptanalysts on Naval Enigma and bombe construction in Washington, and assisted at <a href="Bell_Labs" title="wikilink">Bell Labs</a> with the development of <a href="secure_speech" title="wikilink">secure speech</a> devices. He returned to Bletchley Park in March 1943. During his absence, <a href="Conel_Hugh_O&#39;Donel_Alexander" title="wikilink">Hugh Alexander</a> had officially assumed the position of head of Hut 8, although Alexander had been <em>de facto</em> head for some time&lt;U+2014&gt;Turing having little interest in the day-to-day running of the section. Turing became a general consultant for cryptanalysis at Bletchley Park.</p>
<p>In the latter part of the war, teaching himself electronics at the same time, Turing undertook (assisted by engineer <a href="Donald_Bayley" title="wikilink">Donald Bayley</a>) the design of a portable machine codenamed <em><a href="Delilah_(secure_speech)" title="wikilink">Delilah</a></em> to allow <a href="secure_voice" title="wikilink">secure voice</a> communications. Intended for different applications, Delilah lacked capability for use with long-distance radio transmissions, and was completed too late to be used in the war. Though Turing demonstrated it to officials by encrypting/decrypting a recording of a <a href="Winston_Churchill" title="wikilink">Winston Churchill</a> speech, Delilah was not adopted for use.</p>
<p>In 1945, Turing was awarded the <a href="Order_of_the_British_Empire" title="wikilink">OBE</a> for his wartime services, but his work remained secret for many years. A biography published by the Royal Society shortly after his death recorded:</p>
<dl>

<dd>&quot;Three remarkable papers written just before the war, on three diverse mathematical subjects, show the quality of the work that might have been produced if he had settled down to work on some big problem at that critical time. For his work at the Foreign Office he was awarded the OBE.&quot;<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a>

His best time of 2 hours, 46 minutes, 3 seconds, was only 11 minutes slower than the winner in the 1948 Olympic Games." /> From 1945 to 1947 he was at the <a href="National_Physical_Laboratory,_UK" title="wikilink">National Physical Laboratory</a>, where he worked on the design of the <a href="ACE_(computer)" title="wikilink">ACE</a> (Automatic Computing Engine). He presented a paper on <a href="February_19" title="wikilink">February 19</a>, <a href="1946" class="uri" title="wikilink">1946</a>, which was the first complete design of a <a href="Von_Neumann_architecture" title="wikilink">stored-program computer</a> in Britain. Although he succeeded in designing the ACE, there were delays in starting the project and he became disillusioned. In late 1947 he returned to Cambridge for a sabbatical year. While he was at Cambridge, ACE was completed in his absence and executed its first program on <a href="May_10" title="wikilink">May 10</a>, <a href="1950" class="uri" title="wikilink">1950</a>. In 1948 he was appointed Reader in the <a href="School_of_Mathematics,_University_of_Manchester" title="wikilink">Mathematics Department</a> at <a href="Victoria_University_of_Manchester" title="wikilink">Manchester</a> and in 1949 became deputy director of the computing laboratory at the <a href="Victoria_University_of_Manchester" title="wikilink">University of Manchester</a>, and worked on software for one of the earliest true computers &lt;U+2014&gt; the <a href="Manchester_Mark_I" title="wikilink">Manchester Mark I</a>. During this time he continued to do more abstract work, and in &quot;<a href="Computing_machinery_and_intelligence" title="wikilink">Computing machinery and intelligence</a>&quot; (Mind, October 1950), Turing addressed the problem of <a href="artificial_intelligence" title="wikilink">artificial intelligence</a>, and proposed an experiment now known as the <a href="Turing_test" title="wikilink">Turing test</a>, an attempt to define a standard for a machine to be called &quot;sentient&quot;.</p>
<p>In 1948, Turing, working with his former undergraduate colleague, <a href="D.G._Champernowne" title="wikilink">D.G. Champernowne</a>, began writing a chess program for a computer that did not yet exist. In 1952, lacking a computer powerful enough to execute the program, Turing played a game in which he simulated the computer, taking about half an hour per move. <a href="http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1356927">The game</a> was recorded; the program lost to Turing's colleague <a href="Alick_Glennie" title="wikilink">Alick Glennie</a>, although it is said that it won a game against Champernowne's wife.</p>
<h2 id="pattern-formation-and-mathematical-biology">Pattern formation and mathematical biology</h2>

He published one paper on the subject called &quot;The Chemical Basis of Morphogenesis&quot; in 1952, putting forth the Turing hypothesis of pattern formation.<sup><a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2006/11/061128093244.htm">1</a></sup> His central interest in the field was understanding <a href="Leonardo_of_Pisa" title="wikilink">Fibonacci</a> <a href="phyllotaxis" class="uri" title="wikilink">phyllotaxis</a>, the existence of <a href="Fibonacci_number" title="wikilink">Fibonacci numbers</a> in plant structures.

<h2 id="prosecution-for-homosexual-acts-and-turings-death">Prosecution for homosexual acts and Turing's death</h2>
<p>Turing was a homosexual<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> during a period when homosexual acts were illegal in England and homosexuality was regarded as a mental illness. In 1952, Arnold Murray, a 19-year-old recent acquaintance of his<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> helped an accomplice to break into Turing's house, and Turing went to the police to report the crime. As a result of the police investigation, Turing acknowledged a sexual relationship with Murray, and they were charged with gross indecency under <a href="Criminal_Law_Amendment_Act_of_1885#Section_11" title="wikilink">Section 11</a> of the Criminal Law Amendment Act of 1885. Turing was unrepentant and was convicted. He was given the choice between imprisonment and probation, conditional on him undergoing <a href="hormone" title="wikilink">hormonal</a> <a href="chemical_castration" title="wikilink">treatment</a> designed to reduce <a href="libido" class="uri" title="wikilink">libido</a>. In order to avoid going to jail, he accepted the <a href="estrogen" title="wikilink">oestrogen</a> hormone injections, which lasted for a year, with side effects including the <a href="gynecomastia" title="wikilink">development of breasts</a>. His conviction led to a removal of his security clearance and prevented him from continuing consultancy for <a href="GCHQ" class="uri" title="wikilink">GCHQ</a> on cryptographic matters.</p>
<p>On <a href="June_8" title="wikilink">June 8</a>, <a href="1954" class="uri" title="wikilink">1954</a>, his cleaner found his lifeless body; the previous day, he had died of <a href="cyanide" class="uri" title="wikilink">cyanide</a> <a href="poisoning" class="uri" title="wikilink">poisoning</a>, apparently from a cyanide-laced apple he left half-eaten beside his bed. The apple itself was never tested for contamination with cyanide, and cyanide poisoning as a cause of death was established by a post-mortem. Most believe that his death was intentional, and the death was ruled a <a href="suicide" class="uri" title="wikilink">suicide</a>. His mother, however, strenuously argued that the ingestion was accidental due to his careless storage of laboratory chemicals. Biographer Andrew Hodges suggests that Turing may have killed himself in this ambiguous way quite deliberately, to give his mother some plausible deniability.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> Because Turing's homosexuality would have been perceived as a security risk, the possibility of assassination has also been suggested.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> His remains were cremated at <a href="Woking" class="uri" title="wikilink">Woking</a> crematorium on <a href="June_12" title="wikilink">June 12</a>, <a href="1954" class="uri" title="wikilink">1954</a>.</p>

<p>Various tributes to Turing have been made in Manchester, the city where he worked towards the end of his life. In 1994 a stretch of the <a href="Manchester" class="uri" title="wikilink">Manchester</a> city inner ring road was named Alan Turing Way. <img src="Alan_Turing_Memorial_Closer.jpg" title="fig:Alan Turing memorial statue in Sackville Park" alt="Alan Turing memorial statue in Sackville Park" width="200" /> A <a href="Alan_Turing_Memorial" title="wikilink">statue of Turing</a> was unveiled in <a href="Manchester" class="uri" title="wikilink">Manchester</a> on <a href="June_23" title="wikilink">June 23</a>, <a href="2001" class="uri" title="wikilink">2001</a>.
