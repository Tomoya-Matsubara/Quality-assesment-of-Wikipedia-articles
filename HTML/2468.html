<p>The <strong>Commonwealth War Graves Commission</strong> (<strong>CWGC</strong>) is an <a href="intergovernmental_organization" title="wikilink">intergovernmental organization</a> of six independent <a href="member_states" title="wikilink">member states</a> whose principal function is to mark, record and maintain the graves and places of commemoration of <a href="Commonwealth_of_Nations" title="wikilink">Commonwealth of Nations</a> military service members who died in the two World Wars. The Commission is also responsible for commemorating Commonwealth civilians who died as a result of enemy action during the <a href="Second_World_War" title="wikilink">Second World War</a>. The Commission was founded by <a href="Fabian_Ware" title="wikilink">Fabian Ware</a> and constituted through <a href="Royal_Charter" title="wikilink">Royal Charter</a> in 1917 as the <strong>Imperial War Graves Commission</strong>. The change to the present name took place in 1960.</p>
<p>The Commission, as part of its mandate, is responsible for commemorating all Commonwealth war dead individually and equally. To this end, the war dead are commemorated by name on a headstone, at an identified site of a burial, or on a memorial. War dead are commemorated uniformly and equally, irrespective of military or civil rank, race or creed.</p>
<p>The Commission is currently responsible for the continued commemoration of 1.7 million deceased Commonwealth military service members in 153 countries. Since its inception, the Commission has constructed approximately 2,500 war cemeteries and numerous memorials. The Commission is currently responsible for the care of war dead at over 23,000 separate burial sites and the maintenance of more than 200 memorials worldwide. In addition to commemorating Commonwealth military service members, the Commission maintains, under arrangement with applicable governments, over 40,000 non-Commonwealth war graves and over 25,000 non-war military and civilian graves.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> The Commission operates through the continued financial support of the member states: United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, India and South Africa. The current President of the Commonwealth War Graves Commission is <a href="Prince_Edward,_Duke_of_Kent" title="wikilink">Prince Edward, Duke of Kent</a>.</p>

<p>On the outbreak of the First World War in 1914, <a href="Fabian_Ware" title="wikilink">Fabian Ware</a>, a director of the <a href="Rio_Tinto_Group" title="wikilink">Rio Tinto Company</a>, found that at 45 years old he was too old to join the British Army.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> He used the influence of Rio Tinto chairman, <a href="Alfred_Milner,_1st_Viscount_Milner" title="wikilink">Viscount Milner</a>, to become the commander of a mobile unit of the <a href="British_Red_Cross" title="wikilink">British Red Cross</a>. He arrived in France in September 1914 and whilst there was struck by the lack of any official mechanism for documenting or marking the location of graves of those who had been killed and felt compelled to create an organization within the Red Cross for this purpose. In March 1915, with the support of <a href="Nevil_Macready" title="wikilink">Nevil Macready</a>, Adjutant-General of the <a href="British_Expeditionary_Force_(World_War_I)" title="wikilink">British Expeditionary Force</a>, Ware's work was given official recognition and support by the Imperial War Office and the unit was transferred to the British Army as the Graves Registration Commission.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> The new Graves Registration Commission had over 31,000 graves of British and Imperial soldiers registered by October 1915 and 50,000 registered by May 1916.</p>
<p>When municipal graveyards began to overfill Ware began negotiations with various local authorities to acquire land for further cemeteries. Ware began with an agreement with France to build joint British and French cemeteries under the understanding that these would be maintained by the French government. Ware eventually concluded that it was not prudent to leave the maintenance responsibilities solely to the French government and subsequently arranged for France to purchase the land, grant it in perpetuity, and leave the management and maintenance responsibilities to the British. The French government agreed under the condition that cemeteries respected certain dimensions,<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> were accessible by public road, were in the vicinity of medical aid stations and were not too close to towns or villages. Similar negotiations were started with the Belgian government.</p>
<p>As reports of the grave registration work became public, the Commission began to receive letters of enquiry and requests for photographs of graves from relatives of deceased soldiers. By 1917, 17thousand photographs had been dispatched to relatives.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> In March 1915, the Commission, with the support of the Red Cross, began to dispatch photographic prints and cemetery location information in answer to the requests. The Graves Registration Commission became the Directorate of Graves Registration and Enquiries in the spring of 1916 in recognition of the fact that the scope of work began to extend beyond simple grave registration and began to include responding to enquiries from relatives of those killed. The directorate's work was also extended beyond the <a href="Western_Front_(World_War_I)" title="wikilink">Western Front</a> and into other theatres of war, with units deployed in Greece, Egypt and Mesopotamia.</p>

<p>As the war continued, Ware and others became concerned about the fate of the graves in the post-war period. Following a suggestion by the British Army, the National Committee for the Care of Soldiers Graves was appointed by the British government in January 1916, with <a href="Edward_VIII" title="wikilink">Edward, Prince of Wales</a> agreeing to serve as president. The National Committee for the Care of Soldiers' Graves was created with the intention of taking over the work of the Directorate of Graves Registration and Enquiries after the war.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></ref> The government felt that it was more appropriate to entrust the work to a specially appointed body rather than to any existing government department.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> By early 1917 a number of members of the committee believed a formal imperial organization would be needed to care for the graves. With the help of <a href="Edward_VIII" title="wikilink">Edward, Prince of Wales</a>, Ware submitted a memorandum to the <a href="Imperial_War_Conference" title="wikilink">Imperial War Conference</a> in 1917 suggesting that an imperial organization be constituted.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> The suggestion was accepted and on 21 May 1917 the Imperial War Graves Commission was established by Royal Charter, with Edward, Prince of Wales serving as president, <a href="Secretary_of_State_for_War" title="wikilink">Secretary of State for War</a> <a href="Edward_Stanley,_17th_Earl_of_Derby" title="wikilink">Lord Derby</a> as chairman and Ware as vice-chairman. The Commission's undertakings began in earnest at the end of the First World War. Once land for cemeteries and memorials had been guaranteed, the enormous task of recording the details of the dead could begin. By 1918, some 587,000 graves had been identified and a further 559,000 casualties were registered as having no known grave.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<p>The scale, and associated high number of casualties, of the First World War produced an entirely new attitude towards the commemoration of war dead. Previous to the First World War, individual commemoration of war dead was often on an ad hoc basis and was almost exclusively limited to commissioned officers. However, the war required mobilization of a significant percentage of the population, either as volunteers or through <a href="conscription" class="uri" title="wikilink">conscription</a>. An expectation had consequently arisen that individual soldiers would expect to be commemorated, even if they were low ranking members of the military. A committee under <a href="Frederic_Kenyon" title="wikilink">Frederic Kenyon</a>, Director of the <a href="British_Museum" title="wikilink">British Museum</a>, presented a report to the Commission in November 1918 detailing how it envisioned the development of the cemeteries.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> Two key elements of this report were that bodies should not be repatriated and that uniform memorials should be used to avoid class distinctions. Beyond the logistical nightmare of returning home so many corpses, it was felt that repatriation would conflict with the feeling of brotherhood that had developed between all serving ranks.</p>
<p><img src="The_Graves_of_the_Fallen_-_cover_page.jpg" title="fig:Cover page of Graves of the Fallen" alt="Cover page of Graves of the Fallen" /> The Commission's proposal was brought to a wider audience through an article in <em><a href="The_Times_of_London" title="wikilink">The Times</a></em> on 17 February 1919 by <a href="Rudyard_Kipling" title="wikilink">Rudyard Kipling</a>, in which he described what the graves would look like. The article titled <em>War Graves: Work of Imperial Commission: Mr. Kipling's Survey</em> was quickly republished as an illustrated booklet, <em>Graves of the Fallen</em>. The illustrated booklet was intended to soften the impact of Kenyon's report as it included illustrations of cemeteries with mature trees and shrubs; contrasting the bleak landscapes depicted in published battlefield photos. There was an immediate public outcry following the publication of the reports, particularly with regards to the decision to not repatriate the bodies of the dead. The reports generated considerable discussion in the press which ultimately led to a heated debate in Parliament on 4 May 1920.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> Sir <a href="James_Remnant" title="wikilink">James Remnant</a> started the debate, followed by speeches by <a href="William_Burdett-Coutts" title="wikilink">William Burdett-Coutts</a> in favour of the Commission's principles and <a href="Robert_Cecil,_1st_Viscount_Cecil_of_Chelwood" title="wikilink">Robert Cecil</a> speaking for those desiring repatriation and opposing uniformity of grave markers. The debate was closed by <a href="Winston_Churchill" title="wikilink">Winston Churchill</a> who asked that the issue not proceed to a vote.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> Remnant withdrew his motion, allowing the Commission to carry out its work assured of support for its principles.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="first-cemeteries-and-memorials-to-the-missing">First cemeteries and memorials to the missing</h3>
<p>Three of the most eminent architects of their day, <a href="Herbert_Baker" title="wikilink">Sir Herbert Baker</a>, <a href="Reginald_Blomfield" title="wikilink">Sir Reginald Blomfield</a>, and <a href="Edwin_Lutyens" title="wikilink">Sir Edwin Lutyens</a> were commissioned to design the cemeteries and memorials. Rudyard Kipling was appointed literary advisor for the language used for memorial inscriptions.</p>
<p><img src="Site_plan_for_the_Forceville_Communal_Cemetery_Extension.jpg" title="fig:The site plan for the Forceville Communal Cemetery and Extension" alt="The site plan for the Forceville Communal Cemetery and Extension" /> In 1920 the Commission built three experimental cemeteries at <a href="Le_Treport" title="wikilink">Le Treport</a>, <a href="Forceville" class="uri" title="wikilink">Forceville</a> and <a href="Louvencourt" class="uri" title="wikilink">Louvencourt</a>, following the principles outlined in the Kenyon report. Of these, the Forceville Communal Cemetery and Extension was agreed to be the most successful. Having consulted with garden designer <a href="Gertrude_Jekyll" title="wikilink">Gertrude Jekyll</a>, the architects created a walled cemetery with uniform headstones in a garden setting, augmented by Blomfield's <a href="Cross_of_Sacrifice" title="wikilink">Cross of Sacrifice</a> and Lutyens' <a href="Stone_of_Remembrance" title="wikilink">Stone of Remembrance</a>. After some adjustments, Forceville became the template for the Commission's building program. Adjustments were required because all three experimental cemeteries went over budget. To ensure future cemeteries remained within their budget the Commission decided to not build shelters in cemeteries that contained less than 200 graves, to not place a Stone of Remembrance in any cemetery with less than 400 graves, and to limit the height of cemetery walls to one metre.</p>
<p>At the end of 1919, the Commission had spent &lt;U+00A3&gt;7,500, and this figure rose to &lt;U+00A3&gt;250,000 in 1920 as construction of cemeteries and memorials increased. By 1921, the Commission had established 1,000 cemeteries which were ready for headstone erections, and burials. Between 1920 and 1923, the Commission was shipping 4,000 headstones a week to France. In many cases small cemeteries were closed and the graves concentrated in larger ones. By 1927, when the majority of construction had been completed, over 500 cemeteries had been built, with 400,000 headstones, a thousand Crosses of Sacrifice, and 400 Stones of Remembrance.</p>
<p><img src="Ieper_Menenpoort_R01.jpg" title="fig:The Menin Gate at night" alt="The Menin Gate at night" /> The Commission had also been mandated to individually commemorate each soldier who had no known grave, which amounted to 315,000 in France and Belgium alone. The Commission initially decided to build 12 monuments on which to commemorate the missing; each memorial being located at the site of an important battle along the Western Front. After resistance from the French committee responsible for the approvals of memorials on French territory, the Commission revised their plan and reduced the number of memorials, and in some cases built memorials to the missing in existing cemeteries rather than as separate structures.</p>
<p>Reginald Blomfield's <a href="Menin_Gate" title="wikilink">Menin Gate</a> was the first memorial to the missing located in Europe to be completed, and was unveiled on 24 July 1927.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> The Menin Gate was found to have insufficient space to contain all the names as originally planned and 34,984 names of the missing were instead inscribed on Herbert Baker's <a href="Tyne_Cot_Cemetery" title="wikilink">Tyne Cot Memorial to the Missing</a>. Other memorials followed: the <a href="Helles_Memorial" title="wikilink">Helles Memorial</a> in <a href="Gallipoli" class="uri" title="wikilink">Gallipoli</a> designed by <a href="John_James_Burnet" title="wikilink">John James Burnet</a>; the <a href="Thiepval_Memorial" title="wikilink">Thiepval Memorial</a> on the <a href="Somme" class="uri" title="wikilink">Somme</a> and the <a href="Arras_Memorial" title="wikilink">Arras Memorial</a> designed by Edwin Lutyens; and the <a href="Basra_Memorial" title="wikilink">Basra Memorial</a> in Iraq designed by <a href="Edward_Prioleau_Warren" title="wikilink">Edward Prioleau Warren</a>. The Dominions and India also erected memorials on which they commemorated their missing: the <a href="Neuve-Chapelle_Memorial" title="wikilink">Neuve-Chapelle Memorial</a> for the forces of India, the <a href="Vimy_Memorial" title="wikilink">Vimy Memorial</a> by Canada, the <a href="Villers-Bretonneux_Memorial" title="wikilink">Villers-Bretonneux Memorial</a> by Australia, the <a href="Delville_Wood_Memorial" title="wikilink">Delville Wood Memorial</a> by South Africa and the <a href="Beaumont-Hamel_Memorial" title="wikilink">Beaumont-Hamel Memorial</a> by Newfoundland. The programme of commemorating the dead of the Great War was considered essentially complete with the inauguration of the Thiepval Memorial in 1932, though the Vimy Memorial would not be finished until 1936, the Villers-Bretonneux Memorial until 1938 and stonemasons were still conducting work on the Menin Gate when Germany invaded Belgium in 1940.</p>

<p>From the start of the Second World War in 1939, the Commission organized grave registration units and, planning ahead based on the experience gained from the First World War, earmarked land for use as cemeteries.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> When the war began turning in favour of the Allies, the Commission was able to begin restoring its First World War cemeteries and memorials. It also began the task of commemorating the 600,000 Commonwealth casualties from the Second World War. In 1949, the Commission completed <a href="Dieppe_Canadian_War_Cemetery" title="wikilink">Dieppe Canadian War Cemetery</a>, the first of 559 new cemeteries and 36 new memorials.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a><a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a><a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> Eventually, over 350,000 new headstones were erected. Many were made from <a href="Hopton_Wood_stone" title="wikilink">Hopton Wood stone</a>. The wider scale of the Second World War, coupled with manpower shortages and unrest in some countries, meant that the construction and restoration programs took much longer. Following the Second World War, the Commission implemented a five-year horticultural renovation program. The horticultural neglect was largely addressed by 1950 but there were necessary structural repairs to be made. These, together with the backlog of maintenance tasks from before the war, took a further 10 years to complete and the program was not completed until the 1960s.</p>
<p>With the increased number of civilian casualties compared with the First World War, <a href="Winston_Churchill" title="wikilink">Winston Churchill</a> agreed to Ware's proposal that the Commission also maintain a record of Commonwealth civilian war deaths. A supplemental chapter was added to the Imperial War Graves Commission's charter on 7 February 1941, empowering the organization to collect and record the names of civilians who died from enemy action during the Second World War, which resulted in the creation of the Civilian War Dead Roll of Honour.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> The roll eventually contained the names of nearly 67,000 civilians. The Commission and the <a href="Dean_of_Westminster" title="wikilink">Dean of Westminster</a> reached an agreement that the roll would eventually be placed in <a href="Westminster_Abbey" title="wikilink">Westminster Abbey</a> but not until the roll was complete and hostilities had ended. The Commission handed over the first six volumes to the Dean of Westminster on 21 February 1956; the final volume was added to the showcase in 1958.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="post-second-world-war">Post Second World War</h3>
<p><img src="Graves_at_Fromelles_(Pheasant_Wood)_Miltary_Cemetery.JPG" title="fig:|Fromelles (Pheasant Wood) Military Cemetery, the most recently dedicated cemetery." alt="|Fromelles (Pheasant Wood) Military Cemetery, the most recently dedicated cemetery." /> Following the Second World War the Commission recognized that the word 'Imperial' within its name was no longer appropriate. In the spirit of strengthening national and regional feelings the organization's name was changed to Commonwealth War Graves Commission in 1960. In 2008, an exploratory excavation discovered <a href="mass_grave" title="wikilink">mass graves</a> on the edge of Pheasant Wood outside of <a href="Fromelles" class="uri" title="wikilink">Fromelles</a>. Two-hundred and fifty British and Australian bodies were excavated from five mass graves which were interred in the newly constructed <a href="Fromelles_(Pheasant_Wood)_Military_Cemetery" title="wikilink">Fromelles (Pheasant Wood) Military Cemetery</a>. This was the first new Commonwealth War Graves Commission cemetery in more than 50 years, the last such cemeteries having been built after the Second World War.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a><a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a></p>
<p>More recent conflicts have sometimes made it impossible for the Commission to care for cemeteries in a given region or resulted in the destruction of sites altogether. Zehrensdorf Indian Cemetery in Germany was unkempt after the end of the Second World War and until the <a href="German_reunification" title="wikilink">German reunification</a> because it was located in an area occupied by Russian forces and was not entirely rebuilt until 2005. The <a href="Six-Day_War" title="wikilink">Six-Day War</a> and <a href="War_of_Attrition" title="wikilink">War of Attrition</a> resulted in the destruction of <a href="Port_Tewfik_Memorial" title="wikilink">Port Tewfik Memorial</a> and Aden Memorial, and the death of a Commission gardener at Suez War Memorial Cemetery.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> During the <a href="Lebanese_Civil_War" title="wikilink">Lebanese Civil War</a> two cemeteries in Beirut were destroyed and had to be rebuilt. The maintenance of war graves and memorials in Iraq has remained difficult since <a href="Iran-Iraq_War" title="wikilink">Iran-Iraq War</a> in the 1980s, with regular maintenance being impractical since after the <a href="Gulf_War" title="wikilink">Gulf War</a>.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a><a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a></p>
<p>The Commission has, and continues to, also provide support for war graves outside its traditional mandate. In 1982, the British Ministry of Defence requested the Commission's assistance to design and construct cemeteries in the <a href="Falkland_Islands" title="wikilink">Falkland Islands</a> for those killed during the <a href="Falklands_War" title="wikilink">Falklands War</a>. Although these cemeteries are not Commonwealth War Graves Commission cemeteries, the Commission manages the administrative responsibilities of these cemeteries.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> Since 2005, the Commission has carried out similar management duties on behalf of the British Ministry of Defence for cemeteries and graves of British and Imperial soldiers who died during the <a href="Second_Boer_War" title="wikilink">Second Boer War</a>.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> In 2003, <a href="Veterans_Affairs_Canada" title="wikilink">Veterans Affairs Canada</a> employed the Commission to develop an approach to locate grave markers for which the Canadian Minister of Veterans Affairs has responsibility. As of 2011, the Commission conducts a twelve-year cyclical inspection programme of Canadian Veterans' markers installed at the expense of the government of Canada.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="burial-sites-and-memorials">Burial sites and memorials</h2>

<p>The Commission is currently responsible for the continued commemoration of 1.7 million deceased Commonwealth military service members in 153 countries and approximately 67,000 civilians who died as a result of enemy action during the Second World War.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> Commonwealth military service members are commemorated by name on either a headstone, at an identified site of a burial, or on a memorial. As a result, the Commission is currently responsible for the care of war dead at over 23,000 separate burial sites and maintenance of more than 200 memorials worldwide. The vast majority of burial sites are pre-existing communal or municipal cemeteries and parish churchyards located in the United Kingdom, however the Commission has itself constructed approximately 2,500 war cemeteries worldwide.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> The Commission has also constructed or commissioned memorials to commemorate the dead who have no known grave; the largest of these is the <a href="Thiepval_Memorial" title="wikilink">Thiepval Memorial</a>.</p>
<h3 id="qualifications-for-inclusion">Qualifications for inclusion</h3>
<p>The Commission only commemorates those who have died during the designated war years, while in Commonwealth military service or of causes attributable to service. The applicable periods of consideration are 4 August 1914 to 31 August 1921 for the First World War and 3 September 1939 to 31 December 1947 for the Second World War.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> The end date for the First World War period is the official end of the war, while for the Second World War the Commission selected a date approximately the same period after <a href="VE_Day" title="wikilink">VE Day</a> as the official end of the First World War was after the 1918 Armistice.</p>
<p>Civilians who died as a result of enemy action during the Second World War are commemorated differently than those that died as a result of military service. They are commemorated by name through the Civilian War Dead Roll of Honour located in St George's Chapel in Westminster Abbey.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> In addition to its mandated duties, the Commission maintains, under arrangement with applicable governments, over 40,000 non-Commonwealth war graves and over 25,000 non-war military and civilian graves.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a></p>

<p><img src="Herbert_Baker00.jpg" title="fig:Herbert Baker, one of the original Principal Architects of the Commission" alt="Herbert Baker, one of the original Principal Architects of the Commission" /> As well as the main Principal Architects for France and Belgium (Baker, Blomfield and Lutyens), there were Principal Architects appointed for other regions as well. Sir <a href="Robert_Lorimer" title="wikilink">Robert Lorimer</a> was Principal Architect for Italy, Macedonia and Egypt, while Sir John James Burnet was Principal Architect for Palestine and Gallipoli, assisted by <a href="Thomas_Smith_Tait" title="wikilink">Thomas Smith Tait</a>. The Principal Architect for Mesopotamia was Edward Prioleau Warren.</p>
<p>As well as these senior architects, there was a team of Assistant Architects who were actually responsible for many of the cemetery and memorial designs. These architects were younger, and many of them had served in the war. The Assistant Architects were: George Esselmont Gordon Leith, <a href="Wilfred_Clement_von_Berg" title="wikilink">Wilfred Clement von Berg</a>, <a href="Charles_Henry_Holden" title="wikilink">Charles Henry Holden</a> (who in 1920 became a Principal Architect), <a href="William_Harrison_Cowlishaw" title="wikilink">William Harrison Cowlishaw</a>, <a href="William_Bryce_Binnie" title="wikilink">William Bryce Binnie</a>, George Hartley Goldsmith, Frank Higginson, Arthur James Scott Hutton, Noel Ackroyd Rew, and John Reginald Truelove.

" alt="The Cross of Sacrifice.|alt=a stone cross with a metal longsword in the middle on an octagonal stone base. " /> Structural design has always played an important part in the Commission's cemeteries. Apart from a few exceptions, due to local geological conditions, the cemeteries follow the same design and uniform aesthetic all over the world. This makes the cemeteries easily recognizable and distinguishes them from war graves administered by other groups or countries. </p>
<p>A typical cemetery is surrounded by a low wall or hedge and with a wrought-iron gate entrance.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a> For cemeteries in France and Belgium, a land tablet near the entrance or along a wall identifies the cemetery grounds as having been provided by the French or Belgian governments. All but the smallest cemeteries contain a register with an inventory of the burials, a plan of the plots and rows, and a basic history of the cemetery. The register is located within a metal cupboard that is marked with a cross located in either the wall near the cemetery entrance or in a shelter within the cemetery.<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a> More recently, in larger sites, a stainless steel notice gives details of the respective military campaign.<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a> The headstones within the cemetery are of a uniform size and design and mark plots of equal size.</p>
<p>The cemetery grounds are, except in drier climates, grass covered with a floral border around the headstones. There is also an absence of any paving between the headstone rows which is intended to make the cemetery feel like a traditional walled garden where visitors could experience a sense of peace. However, Carter and Jackson argue that the uniform aesthetics are designed to evoke a positive experience which deliberately masks and sanitizes the nature of the war deaths.</p>

<p>Typically, cemeteries of more than 40 graves contain a <a href="Cross_of_Sacrifice" title="wikilink">Cross of Sacrifice</a> designed by architect <a href="Reginald_Blomfield" title="wikilink">Reginald Blomfield</a>. This cross was designed to imitate medieval crosses found in cemeteries in England with proportions more commonly seen in the Celtic cross. The cross is normally a freestanding four-point <a href="limestone" class="uri" title="wikilink">limestone</a> <a href="Latin_cross" title="wikilink">Latin cross</a>, mounted on an octagonal base, and ranging in height from 14 to 32 feet.<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a>  A <a href="bronze" class="uri" title="wikilink">bronze</a> <a href="longsword" class="uri" title="wikilink">longsword</a>, blade down, is embedded on the face of the cross. This cross represents the faith of the majority of the dead and the sword represents the military character of the cemetery, intended to link British soldiers and the Christian concept of self-sacrifice.</p>
<p>Cemeteries with more than 1000 burials typically have a <a href="Stone_of_Remembrance" title="wikilink">Stone of Remembrance</a>, designed by <a href="Edwin_Lutyens" title="wikilink">Edwin Lutyens</a> with the inscription <em>&quot;Their Name Liveth for Evermore&quot;</em>. The concept of the Stone of Remembrance stone was developed by Rudyard Kipling to commemorate those of all faiths and none respectively. In contrast to the Cross of Sacrifice, the design for the stone deliberately avoided &quot;shapes associated with particular religions&quot;.<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a> The geometry of the structure was based on studies of the <a href="Parthenon" class="uri" title="wikilink">Parthenon</a>.<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a> Each stone is 3.5 metres long and 1.5 metres high.<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a> The shape of the stone has been compared both to that of a <a href="sarcophagus" class="uri" title="wikilink">sarcophagus</a><a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a> and an <a href="altar" class="uri" title="wikilink">altar</a>. The feature was designed using the principle of <a href="entasis" class="uri" title="wikilink">entasis</a>.<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a> The subtle curves in the design, that if extended, would form a sphere 1,801 feet and 8 inches in diameter.</p>
<h4 id="headstones">Headstones</h4>

<p>Every grave is marked with a <a href="headstone" class="uri" title="wikilink">headstone</a>. Each headstone contains the national emblem or regimental badge, rank, name, unit, date of death and age of each casualty inscribed above an appropriate religious symbol and a more personal dedication chosen by relatives. The headstones use a standard <a href="upper_case" title="wikilink">upper case</a> lettering designed by <a href="MacDonald_Gill" title="wikilink">MacDonald Gill</a>. Individual graves are arranged, where possible, in straight rows and marked by uniform headstones, the vast majority of which are made of <a href="Portland_stone" title="wikilink">Portland stone</a>. The original headstone dimensions were 76 cm tall, 38 cm wide, and 7.6 cm thick.</p>
<p>Most headstones are inscribed with a cross, except for those deceased known to be atheist or non-Christian. In the case of burials of <a href="Victoria_Cross" title="wikilink">Victoria Cross</a> recipients, the regimental badge is replaced by the Victoria Cross emblem. Sometimes a soldier employed a pseudonym because they were too young to serve or were sought by law enforcement; in such cases their second name is shown along with the notation &quot;<em>served as&quot;</em>. Many headstones are for unidentified casualties; they consequently bear only what could be discovered from the body. The epitaph, developed by Rudyard Kipling, that appears on the graves of unidentified soldiers for which no details are known is <em>&quot;A Soldier of the Great War known unto God&quot;</em>. Some headstones contain the text &quot;<em>believed to be buried in this cemetery</em>&quot; when they are believed to be buried in the cemetery but the exact location of the grave within the cemetery is not known.  In some cases soldiers were buried in collective graves and distinguishing one body from another was not possible and thus one headstone covers more than one grave. The headstone does not denote any specific details of the death except for its date, and even then only if it is known, and are deliberately ambiguous about the cause of death.</p>
<p>Due to local conditions it was sometimes necessary for the Commission to deviate from its standard design. In places prone to extreme weather or earthquakes, such as Thailand and Turkey, stone-faced pedestal markers are used instead of the normal headstones. These measures are intended to prevent masonry being damaged during earthquakes or sinking into sodden ground.<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a> In Italy headstones were carved from Chiampo Perla limestone because it was in more plentiful supply. In Struma Military Cemetery, in Greece, to avoid risk of earthquake damage, small headstones are laid flat on the ground.<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a> The smaller size of the markers mean that they often lack unit insignia.<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a></p>
<h4 id="horticulture">Horticulture</h4>

<p>Commission cemeteries are distinctive in treating <a href="floriculture" class="uri" title="wikilink">floriculture</a> as an integral part of the cemetery design. Originally, the horticultural concept was to create an environment where visitors could experience a sense of peace in a setting, in contrast to traditionally bleak graveyards.<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a> Recommendations given by <a href="Arthur_William_Hill" title="wikilink">Arthur William Hill</a>, the Assistant Director of the <a href="Royal_Botanical_Gardens_at_Kew" title="wikilink">Royal Botanical Gardens at Kew</a> enabled the Commission to develop cemetery layouts and architectural structures that took into account the placement of suitable plant life. Combining structural and horticultural elements was not unfamiliar to the Commission's architects. Sir Edwin Lutyens furthered his long-standing working relationship with horticulturist <a href="Gertrude_Jekyll" title="wikilink">Gertrude Jekyll</a>, whose devotion to traditional cottage garden plants and roses greatly influenced the appearance of the cemeteries.<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a> Where possible, indigenous plants were utilized to enhance sentimental associations with the gardens of home.<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a></p>
<p>Variety in texture, height and timing of floral display were equally important horticultural considerations. The beds around each headstone are planted with a mixture of <a href="floribunda_rose" title="wikilink">floribunda roses</a> and <a href="herbaceous_perennial" title="wikilink">herbaceous perennials</a>.<a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a> Low-growing plants are chosen for areas immediately in front of headstones, ensuring that inscriptions are not obscured and preventing soil from splashing back during rain. In cemeteries where there are pedestal grave markers, dwarf varieties of plants are used instead.<a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a></p>
<p>The absence of any form of paving between the headstone rows contributes to the simplicity of the cemetery designs. Lawn paths add to the garden ambiance, and are irrigated during the dry season in countries where there is insufficient rain. Where irrigation is inappropriate or impractical, dry landscaping is an ecological alternative favoured by the Commission's horticulturists, as is the case in Iraq. Drier areas require a different approach not only for lawns, but also to plants and styles of planting. Similarly, there are separate horticultural considerations in tropical climates. When many cemeteries are concentrated within a limited area, like along the <a href="Western_Front_(World_War_I)" title="wikilink">Western Front</a> or <a href="Gallipoli_peninsula" title="wikilink">Gallipoli peninsula</a>, mobile teams of gardeners operate from a local base. Elsewhere, larger cemeteries have their own dedicated staff while small cemeteries are usually tended by a single gardener working part-time.</p>

<p><img src="Pallbearers_carry_the_coffin_to_the_grave.jpg" title="fig:Reburial of a New Zealand soldier in February 2012" alt="Reburial of a New Zealand soldier in February 2012" /> Immediately following the First World War, the British Army remained responsible for the exhumation of remains. The Western Front was divided into sectors and combed for bodies by 12-man exhumation units. Between the Armistice and September 1921, The exhumation units reburied 204,695 bodies. After 1921, no further widespread search for bodies was undertaken and in February 1921 responsibility of the centimetres was transferred to the Commission. Despite the rigorous searches, bodies continued to be discovered in numbers. In the three years following the conclusion of the general search 38,000 bodies were discovered. In the mid 1920s, 20 to 30 bodies were being discovered weekly. The discovery of remains of First and Second World War casualties remains a common occurrence with approximately 30 bodies discovered annually. For example, In March 2014, The remains of 20 Commonwealth and 30 German soldiers were discovered in <a href="Vendin-le-Vieil" class="uri" title="wikilink">Vendin-le-Vieil</a>, France with the commonwealth soldiers being subsequently reburied at Loos British Cemetery.<a href="#fn70" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a><a href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a> In April 2013, the remains of four British soldiers discovered by a French farmer clearing land with metal detector in 2009 were re-interred at H.A.C.

<h3 id="vandalism">Vandalism</h3>
<p>Cemeteries, including those of war dead, are targets for vandalism. The gravestones, cemeteries and buildings of the Commission are no exception.  The Commission believes that graffiti and damage to stonework are normally activities favoured by young people, noting there is a rise in the number of incidents during the school holidays.<a href="#fn75" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref75"><sup>75</sup></a> Determined thieves will also steal the bronze off the Cross of Sacrifice, which are now replaced with identical ones made in fibreglass.</p>
