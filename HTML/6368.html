<p>The <strong>Roman Empire</strong> () was the post-<a href="Roman_Republic" title="wikilink">Republican</a> period of the <a href="Ancient_Rome" title="wikilink">ancient Roman civilization</a>, characterised by an <a href="autocracy" title="wikilink">autocratic</a> form of government and large territorial holdings around the <a href="Mediterranean_Sea" title="wikilink">Mediterranean</a> in <a href="Europe" class="uri" title="wikilink">Europe</a>, <a href="Africa" class="uri" title="wikilink">Africa</a>, and <a href="Asia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Asia</a>.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> The 500-year-old <a href="Roman_Republic" title="wikilink">Roman Republic</a>, which preceded it, had been destabilized through a series of <a href="Roman_civil_wars" title="wikilink">civil wars</a>. Several events marked the transition from Republic to Empire, including <a href="Julius_Caesar" title="wikilink">Julius Caesar</a>'s appointment as perpetual <a href="Roman_dictator" title="wikilink">dictator</a> (44 BC); the <a href="Battle_of_Actium" title="wikilink">Battle of Actium</a> ( 31 BC); and the granting of the <a href="honorific" class="uri" title="wikilink">honorific</a> <em><a href="Augustus_(honorific)" title="wikilink">Augustus</a></em> to <a href="Octavian" class="uri" title="wikilink">Octavian</a> by the <a href="Roman_Senate" title="wikilink">Roman Senate</a> ( 27 BC).</p>
<p>The first two centuries of the Empire were a period of unprecedented stability and prosperity known as the <a href="Pax_Romana" title="wikilink">Pax Romana</a> (&quot;Roman Peace&quot;).<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> It reached its greatest expanse during the reign of <a href="Trajan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Trajan</a> (98&lt;U+2013&gt;117 AD). In the 3rd century, the Empire underwent a <a href="Crisis_of_the_Third_Century" title="wikilink">crisis</a> that threatened its existence, but was reunified and stabilized under the emperors <a href="Aurelian" class="uri" title="wikilink">Aurelian</a> and <a href="Diocletian" class="uri" title="wikilink">Diocletian</a>. Christians rose to power in the 4th century, during which time a system of dual rule was developed in the <a href="Greek_East_and_Latin_West" title="wikilink">Latin West and Greek East</a>. After the <a href="Fall_of_the_Western_Roman_Empire" title="wikilink">collapse of central government in the West</a> in the 5th century, the eastern half of the Roman Empire continued as what would later be known as the <a href="Byzantine_Empire" title="wikilink">Byzantine Empire</a>.</p>
<p>Because of the Empire's vast extent and long endurance, the institutions and culture of Rome had a profound and lasting influence on the development of language, religion, architecture, philosophy, law, and forms of government in the territory it governed, particularly Europe, and by means of European expansionism throughout the modern world.</p>
<h2 id="history">History</h2>


<p>Rome had begun <a href="Annexation" title="wikilink">annexing</a> <a href="Roman_province" title="wikilink">provinces</a> in the 3rd century BC, four centuries before reaching its greatest territorial extent, and in that sense was an &quot;empire&quot; while still governed as a republic.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> Republican provinces were administered by former <a href="Roman_consul" title="wikilink">consuls</a> and <a href="praetor" title="wikilink">praetors</a>, who had been elected to one-year terms and held <em><a href="imperium" class="uri" title="wikilink">imperium</a></em>, &quot;right of command&quot;.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> The amassing of disproportionate wealth and military power by a few men through their provincial commands was a major factor in the transition from republic to imperial autocracy.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> Later, the position of power held by the emperor was expressed as <em>imperium</em>.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> The Latin word is the origin of English &quot;empire,&quot; a meaning it began to acquire only later in Rome's history.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p><img src="Statue-Augustus.jpg" title="fig:The Augustus of Prima Porta (early 1st century AD)" alt="The Augustus of Prima Porta (early 1st century AD)" /> As the first emperor, <a href="Augustus" class="uri" title="wikilink">Augustus</a> took the official position that he had saved the Republic, and carefully framed his powers within <a href="Constitution_of_the_Roman_Republic" title="wikilink">republican constitutional principles</a>. He rejected titles that Romans associated with monarchy, and instead referred to himself as the <em><a href="princeps" class="uri" title="wikilink">princeps</a></em>, &quot;leading citizen&quot;. <a href="Consul" title="wikilink">Consuls</a> continued to be elected, <a href="tribune" title="wikilink">tribunes of the people</a> continued to put forth legislation, and senators still debated in the <a href="curia" class="uri" title="wikilink">curia</a>. It was Augustus, however, who established the precedent that the emperor controlled the final decisions, backed up by military force.</p>
<p>The reign of Augustus, lasting more than 40 years, was portrayed in <a href="Augustan_literature_(ancient_Rome)" title="wikilink">Augustan literature</a> and art as a new &quot;<a href="Golden_Age" title="wikilink">Golden Age</a>.&quot; Augustus laid out an enduring ideological foundation for the three centuries of the Empire known as the <a href="Principate" class="uri" title="wikilink">Principate</a> (27 BC&lt;U+2013&gt;284 AD), the first 200 years of which is traditionally regarded as the <a href="Pax_Romana" title="wikilink">Pax Romana</a>. During this period, the cohesion of the Empire was furthered by participation in civic life, economic ties, and shared cultural, legal and religious norms. Uprisings in the provinces were infrequent, but put down &quot;mercilessly and swiftly&quot; when they occurred,<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> as in <a href="Roman_Britain" title="wikilink">Britain</a> and <a href="Gaul" class="uri" title="wikilink">Gaul</a>. The sixty years of <a href="Jewish&lt;U+2013&gt;Roman_wars" title="wikilink">Jewish&lt;U+2013&gt;Roman wars</a> in the first half of the 2nd century were exceptional in their duration and violence.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<p>The success of Augustus in establishing principles of dynastic succession was limited by his outliving a number of talented potential heirs: the <a href="Julio-Claudian_dynasty" title="wikilink">Julio-Claudian dynasty</a> lasted for four more emperors&lt;U+2014&gt;<a href="Tiberius" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tiberius</a>, <a href="Caligula" class="uri" title="wikilink">Caligula</a>, <a href="Claudius" class="uri" title="wikilink">Claudius</a>, and <a href="Nero" class="uri" title="wikilink">Nero</a>&lt;U+2014&gt;before it yielded in 69 AD to the strife-torn <a href="Year_of_Four_Emperors" title="wikilink">Year of Four Emperors</a>, from which <a href="Vespasian" class="uri" title="wikilink">Vespasian</a> emerged as victor.</p>
<p>Vespasian became the founder of the brief <a href="Flavian_dynasty" title="wikilink">Flavian dynasty</a>, to be followed by the <a href="Nerva&lt;U+2013&gt;Antonine_dynasty" title="wikilink">Nerva&lt;U+2013&gt;Antonine dynasty</a> which produced the &quot;<a href="Five_Good_Emperors" title="wikilink">Five Good Emperors</a>&quot;: <a href="Nerva" class="uri" title="wikilink">Nerva</a>, <a href="Trajan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Trajan</a>, <a href="Hadrian" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hadrian</a>, <a href="Antoninus_Pius" title="wikilink">Antoninus Pius</a> and the philosophically inclined <a href="Marcus_Aurelius" title="wikilink">Marcus Aurelius</a>. In the view of the Greek historian <a href="Dio_Cassius" title="wikilink">Dio Cassius</a>, a contemporary observer, the accession of the emperor <a href="Commodus" class="uri" title="wikilink">Commodus</a> in 180 AD marked the descent &quot;from a kingdom of gold to one of rust and iron&quot;<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a>&lt;U+2014&gt;a famous comment which has led some historians, notably <a href="Edward_Gibbon" title="wikilink">Edward Gibbon</a>, to take Commodus' reign as the beginning of the <a href="decline_of_the_Roman_Empire" title="wikilink">decline of the Roman Empire</a>.</p>
<p>In 212, during the reign of <a href="Caracalla" class="uri" title="wikilink">Caracalla</a>, <a href="Roman_citizenship" title="wikilink">Roman citizenship</a> was granted to all freeborn inhabitants of the Empire.

The emaciated illusion of the old Republic was sacrificed for the sake of imposing order: <a href="Diocletian" class="uri" title="wikilink">Diocletian</a> (reigned 284&lt;U+2013&gt;305) brought the Empire back from the brink, but declined the role of <em>princeps</em> and became the first emperor to be addressed regularly as <em>domine</em>, &quot;master&quot; or &quot;lord&quot;.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> Diocletian's reign also brought the Empire's most concerted effort against the perceived threat of <a href="early_Christianity" title="wikilink">Christianity</a>, the <a href="Diocletianic_Persecution" title="wikilink">&quot;Great Persecution&quot;</a>.The state of <a href="Absolute_monarchy" title="wikilink">autocratic absolutism</a> that began with Diocletius as the <a href="Dominate" class="uri" title="wikilink">Dominate</a> endured till the fall of the <a href="Western_Roman_Empire" title="wikilink">Western Roman Empire</a> in 476.</p>
<p>The unity of the Roman Empire was from this point a fiction, as graphically revealed by Diocletian's division of authority among four &quot;co-emperors&quot;, the <a href="Tetrarchy" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tetrarchy</a>.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> Order was shaken again soon after, but was restored by <a href="Constantine_I" title="wikilink">Constantine</a>, who became the first emperor to <a href="Constantine_the_Great_and_Christianity" title="wikilink">convert to Christianity</a>, and who established <a href="Constantinople" class="uri" title="wikilink">Constantinople</a> as the new capital of the eastern empire. During the decades of the <a href="Constantinian_dynasty" title="wikilink">Constantinian</a> and <a href="Valentinian_dynasty" title="wikilink">Valentinian dynasties</a>, the Empire was divided along an east-west axis, with dual power centres in Constantinople and Rome. The reign of <a href="Julian_the_Apostate" title="wikilink">Julian</a>, who attempted to restore <a href="Religion_in_ancient_Rome" title="wikilink">Classical Roman</a> and <a href="Hellenistic_religion" title="wikilink">Hellenistic religion</a>, only briefly interrupted the succession of Christian emperors. <a href="Theodosius&amp;nbsp;I" class="uri" title="wikilink">Theodosius&amp;nbsp;I</a>, the last emperor to rule over both East and West, died in 395 AD after making Christianity the <a href="State_church_of_the_Roman_Empire" title="wikilink">official state religion</a>.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<p>The Roman Empire began to <a href="Fall_of_the_Western_Roman_Empire" title="wikilink">disintegrate</a> in the late 4th century as <a href="Migration_Period" title="wikilink">invasions</a> overwhelmed the capacity of the Empire to govern and mount a coordinated defense. <a href="Decline_of_the_Roman_Empire" title="wikilink">Most chronologies</a> place the end of the Western empire in 476, when <a href="Romulus_Augustulus" title="wikilink">Romulus Augustulus</a> was <a href="Deposition_of_Romulus_Augustulus" title="wikilink">forced to abdicate</a> to the <a href="Germanic_peoples" title="wikilink">Germanic</a> warlord <a href="Odoacer" class="uri" title="wikilink">Odoacer</a>.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> The empire in the East&lt;U+2014&gt;known today as the <a href="Byzantine_Empire" title="wikilink">Byzantine Empire</a>, but referred to in its time as the &quot;Roman Empire&quot; or by various other names&lt;U+2014&gt;ended in 1453 with the death of <a href="Constantine_XI_Palaiologos" title="wikilink">Constantine XI</a> and the <a href="fall_of_Constantinople" title="wikilink">fall of Constantinople</a> to the <a href="Ottoman_Turks" title="wikilink">Ottoman Turks</a>.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="geography">Geography</h2>
<p>The Roman Empire was <a href="List_of_largest_empires" title="wikilink">one of the largest</a> in history, with contiguous territories throughout <a href="Europe" class="uri" title="wikilink">Europe</a>, <a href="North_Africa" title="wikilink">North Africa</a>, and the <a href="Middle_East" title="wikilink">Middle East</a>.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a><a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> The Latin phrase <em>imperium sine fine</em> (&quot;empire without end&quot;<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a>) expressed the ideology that neither time nor space limited the Empire. In <a href="Vergil" class="uri" title="wikilink">Vergil</a>'s epic poem the <em><a href="Aeneid" class="uri" title="wikilink">Aeneid</a>,</em> limitless empire is said to be granted to the Romans by their supreme deity <a href="Jupiter_(mythology)" title="wikilink">Jupiter</a>.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> This claim of universal dominion was renewed and perpetuated when the Empire came under Christian rule in the 4th century.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a></p>
<p>In reality, <a href="Campaign_history_of_the_Roman_military" title="wikilink">Roman expansion</a> was mostly accomplished under the <a href="Roman_Republic" title="wikilink">Republic</a>, though parts of northern Europe were conquered in the 1st century AD, when Roman control in Europe, Africa and Asia was strengthened.

<p>The dominance of Latin among the literate elite may obscure the continuity of spoken languages, since all cultures within the Roman Empire were predominantly oral.<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a> In the West, Latin, referred to in its spoken form as <a href="Vulgar_Latin" title="wikilink">Vulgar Latin</a>, gradually replaced <a href="Celtic_languages" title="wikilink">Celtic</a> and <a href="Italic_languages" title="wikilink">Italic</a> languages that were related to it by a shared <a href="Proto-Indo-European" title="wikilink">Indo-European origin</a>.

<h3 id="legal-status">Legal status</h3>

<p>According to the <a href="Gaius_(jurist)" title="wikilink">jurist Gaius</a>, the essential distinction in the Roman &quot;<a href="legal_personality" title="wikilink">law of persons</a>&quot; was that all human beings were either free <em>(liberi)</em> or slaves <em>(servi)</em>.<a href="#fn76" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref76"><sup>76</sup></a> The legal status of free persons might be further defined by their citizenship. In the early Empire, only a relatively limited number of men held full rights of Roman citizenship that allowed them to vote, run for office, and enter state priesthoods. Most citizens held limited rights (such as the <em><a href="ius_Latinum" title="wikilink">ius Latinum</a>,</em> &quot;Latin right&quot;), but were entitled to legal protections and privileges not enjoyed by those who lacked citizenship. Free people not considered citizens, but living within the Roman world, held status as <em><a href="peregrinus_(Roman)" title="wikilink">peregrini</a></em>, non-Romans.<a href="#fn77" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref77"><sup>77</sup></a> In 212 AD, by means of the edict known as the <em><a href="Constitutio_Antoniniana" title="wikilink">Constitutio Antoniniana</a></em>, the emperor <a href="Caracalla" class="uri" title="wikilink">Caracalla</a> extended citizenship to all freeborn inhabitants of the empire. This legal egalitarianism would have required a far-reaching revision of existing laws that had distinguished between citizens and non-citizens.<a href="#fn78" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref78"><sup>78</sup></a></p>
<h4 id="women-as-legal-entities">Women as legal entities</h4>

<p>Freeborn Roman women were considered citizens throughout the Republic and Empire, but did not vote, hold political office, or serve in the military. A mother's citizen status determined that of her children, as indicated by the phrase <em>ex duobus civibus Romanis natos</em> (&quot;children born of two Roman citizens&quot;).<a href="#fn79" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref79"><sup>79</sup></a> A Roman woman kept her own <a href="Roman_naming_conventions" title="wikilink">family name</a> <em>(nomen)</em> for life. Children most often took the father's name, but in the Imperial period sometimes made their mother's name part of theirs, or even used it instead.<a href="#fn80" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref80"><sup>80</sup></a></p>
<p><img src="Bronze_young_girl_reading_CdM_Paris.jpg" title="fig:Bronze statuette (1st century AD) of a young woman reading" alt="Bronze statuette (1st century AD) of a young woman reading" /> The archaic form of <a href="manus_marriage" title="wikilink"><em>manus</em> marriage</a> in which the woman had been subject to her husband's authority was largely abandoned by the Imperial era, and a married woman retained ownership of any property she brought into the marriage. Technically she remained under her father's legal authority, even though she moved into her husband's home, but when her father died she became legally emancipated.<a href="#fn81" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref81"><sup>81</sup></a> This arrangement was one of the factors in the degree of independence Roman women enjoyed relative to those of many other ancient cultures and up to the modern period:<a href="#fn82" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref82"><sup>82</sup></a> although she had to answer to her father in legal matters, she was free of his direct scrutiny in her daily life,<a href="#fn83" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref83"><sup>83</sup></a> and her husband had no legal power over her.<a href="#fn84" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref84"><sup>84</sup></a> Although it was a point of pride to be a &quot;one-man woman&quot; <em>(univira)</em> who had married only once, there was little stigma attached to <a href="Marriage_in_ancient_Rome#Divorce" title="wikilink">divorce</a>, nor to speedy remarriage after the loss of a husband through death or divorce.<a href="#fn85" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref85"><sup>85</sup></a></p>
<p>Girls had equal inheritance rights with boys if their father died without leaving a will.<a href="#fn86" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref86"><sup>86</sup></a> A Roman mother's right to own property and to dispose of it as she saw fit, including setting the terms of her own will, gave her enormous influence over her sons even when they were adults.<a href="#fn87" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref87"><sup>87</sup></a></p>
<p>As part of the Augustan programme to restore traditional morality and social order, <a href="Leges_Iuliae" title="wikilink">moral legislation</a> attempted to regulate the conduct of women as a means of promoting &quot;<a href="family_values" title="wikilink">family values</a>&quot;. <a href="Marriage_in_ancient_Rome#Adultery" title="wikilink">Adultery</a>, which had been a private family matter under the Republic, was criminalized,<a href="#fn88" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref88"><sup>88</sup></a> and defined broadly as an illicit sex act <em>(<a href="stuprum" class="uri" title="wikilink">stuprum</a>)</em> that occurred between a male citizen and a married woman, or between a married woman and any man other than her husband.<a href="#fn89" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref89"><sup>89</sup></a> Childbearing was encouraged by the state: a woman who had given birth to three children was granted symbolic honors and greater legal freedom (the <em><a href="ius_trium_liberorum" title="wikilink">ius trium liberorum</a>)</em>.</p>
<p>Because of their legal status as citizens and the degree to which they could become emancipated, women could own property, enter contracts, and engage in business,<a href="#fn90" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref90"><sup>90</sup></a> including shipping, manufacturing, and lending money. Inscriptions throughout the Empire honor women as benefactors in funding public works, an indication they could acquire and dispose of considerable fortunes; for instance, the <a href="Arch_of_the_Sergii" title="wikilink">Arch of the Sergii</a> was funded by Salvia Postuma, a female member of the family honored, and the largest building in the forum at <a href="Pompeii" class="uri" title="wikilink">Pompeii</a> was funded by <a href="Eumachia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Eumachia</a>, a priestess of <a href="Venus_(mythology)" title="wikilink">Venus</a>.<a href="#fn91" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref91"><sup>91</sup></a></p>
<h4 id="slaves-and-the-law">Slaves and the law</h4>

<p>At the time of Augustus, as many as 35 percent of the people in <a href="Italy_(Roman_Empire)" title="wikilink">Italy</a> were slaves,<a href="#fn92" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref92"><sup>92</sup></a> making Rome one of five historical &quot;slave societies&quot; in which slaves constituted at least a fifth of the population and played a major role in the economy.<a href="#fn93" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref93"><sup>93</sup></a> Slavery was a complex institution that supported traditional Roman social structures as well as contributing economic utility.<a href="#fn94" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref94"><sup>94</sup></a> In urban settings, slaves might be professionals such as teachers, physicians, chefs, and accountants, in addition to the majority of slaves who provided trained or unskilled labor in households or workplaces. <a href="Roman_agriculture" title="wikilink">Agriculture</a> and industry, such as milling and mining, relied on the exploitation of slaves. Outside Italy, slaves made up on average an estimated 10 to 20 percent of the population, sparse in <a href="Roman_Egypt" title="wikilink">Roman Egypt</a> but more concentrated in some Greek areas. Expanding Roman ownership of arable land and industries would have affected preexisting practices of slavery in the provinces.<a href="#fn95" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref95"><sup>95</sup></a> Although the institution of slavery has often been regarded as waning in the 3rd and 4th centuries, it remained an integral part of Roman society until the 5th century. Slavery ceased gradually in the 6th and 7th centuries along with the decline of urban centers in the West and the disintegration of the complex Imperial economy that had created the demand for it.<a href="#fn96" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref96"><sup>96</sup></a></p>

A slave could not as a matter of law be raped, since rape could be committed only against people who were free; a slave's rapist had to be prosecuted by the owner for property damage under the <a href="Lex_Aquilia" title="wikilink">Aquilian Law</a>.<a href="#fn98" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref98"><sup>98</sup></a> Slaves had no right to the form of legal marriage called <em><a href="Marriage_in_ancient_Rome" title="wikilink">conubium</a></em>, but their unions were sometimes recognized, and if both were freed they could marry.<a href="#fn99" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref99"><sup>99</sup></a> Following the <a href="Servile_Wars" title="wikilink">Servile Wars</a> of the Republic, legislation under Augustus and his successors shows a driving concern for controlling the threat of rebellions through limiting the size of work groups, and for hunting down fugitive slaves.<a href="#fn100" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref100"><sup>100</sup></a></p>
<p>Technically, a slave could not own property,<a href="#fn101" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref101"><sup>101</sup></a> but a slave who conducted business might be given access to an individual account or fund <em>(peculium)</em> that he could use as if it were his own. The terms of this account varied depending on the degree of trust and cooperation between owner and slave: a slave with an aptitude for business could be given considerable leeway to generate profit, and might be allowed to bequeath the <em>peculium</em> he managed to other slaves of his household.<a href="#fn102" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref102"><sup>102</sup></a> Within a household or workplace, a hierarchy of slaves might exist, with one slave in effect acting as the master of other slaves.<a href="#fn103" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref103"><sup>103</sup></a></p>
<p>Over time slaves gained increased legal protection, including the right to file complaints against their masters. A bill of sale might contain a clause stipulating that the slave could not be employed for prostitution, as <a href="Prostitution_in_ancient_Rome" title="wikilink">prostitutes in ancient Rome</a> were often slaves.<a href="#fn104" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref104"><sup>104</sup></a> The burgeoning trade in <a href="eunuch" class="uri" title="wikilink">eunuch</a> slaves in the late 1st century AD prompted legislation that prohibited the <a href="Sexuality_in_ancient_Rome#Castration_and_circumcision" title="wikilink">castration</a> of a slave against his will &quot;for lust or gain.&quot;<a href="#fn105" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref105"><sup>105</sup></a></p>
<p>Roman slavery was not based on &quot;<a href="Race_(human_classification)" title="wikilink">race</a>&quot; in the modern sense.<a href="#fn106" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref106"><sup>106</sup></a> During the period of Republican expansionism when slavery had become pervasive, war captives were a main source of slaves. The range of ethnicities among slaves to some extent reflected that of the armies Rome defeated in war, and the <a href="Roman_Greece" title="wikilink">conquest of Greece</a> brought a number of highly skilled and educated slaves into Rome. Slaves were also traded in markets, and sometimes sold by <a href="Cilician_pirates" title="wikilink">pirates</a>. <a href="Child_abandonment" title="wikilink">Infant abandonment</a> and self-enslavement among the poor were other sources.<a href="#fn107" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref107"><sup>107</sup></a> <em>Vernae</em>, by contrast, were &quot;homegrown&quot; slaves born to female slaves within the urban household or on a country estate or farm.

<p>Talented slaves with a knack for business might accumulate a large enough <em>peculium</em> to justify their freedom, or be <a href="manumission" title="wikilink">manumitted</a> for services rendered. Manumission had become frequent enough that in 2 BC a law <em>(<a href="Lex_Fufia_Caninia" title="wikilink">Lex Fufia Caninia</a>)</em> limited the number of slaves an owner was allowed to free in his will.<a href="#fn109" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref109"><sup>109</sup></a></p>

After manumission, a slave who had belonged to a Roman citizen enjoyed not only passive freedom from ownership, but active political freedom <em>(libertas)</em>, including the right to vote.<a href="#fn110" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref110"><sup>110</sup></a> A slave who had acquired <em>libertas</em> was a <em>libertus</em> (&quot;freed person,&quot; <a href="grammatical_gender" title="wikilink">feminine</a> <em>liberta</em>) in relation to his former master, who then became his patron <em>(<a href="Patronage_in_ancient_Rome" title="wikilink">patronus</a>)</em>: the two parties continued to have customary and legal obligations to each other. As a social class generally, freed slaves were <em>libertini</em>, though later writers used the terms <em>libertus</em> and <em>libertinus</em> interchangeably.<a href="#fn111" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref111"><sup>111</sup></a></p>
<p>A <em>libertinus</em> was not entitled to hold public office or the highest state priesthoods, but he could play a <a href="Augustales" title="wikilink">priestly role</a> in the <a href="Imperial_cult_(ancient_Rome)" title="wikilink">cult of the emperor</a>. He could not marry a woman from a family of senatorial rank, nor achieve legitimate senatorial rank himself, but during the early Empire, freedmen held key positions in the government bureaucracy, so much so that <a href="Hadrian" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hadrian</a> limited their participation by law.<a href="#fn112" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref112"><sup>112</sup></a> Any future children of a freedman would be born free, with full rights of citizenship.</p>
<p>The rise of successful freedmen&lt;U+2014&gt;through either political influence in imperial service, or wealth&lt;U+2014&gt;is a characteristic of early Imperial society. The prosperity of a high-achieving group of freedmen is attested by <a href=":Commons:Category:Liberti_and_libertae_in_Ancient_Roman_inscriptions" title="wikilink">inscriptions throughout the Empire</a>, and by their ownership of some of the most lavish houses at <a href="Pompeii" class="uri" title="wikilink">Pompeii</a>, such as the <a href="House_of_the_Vettii" title="wikilink">House of the Vettii</a>.

<h3 id="census-rank">Census rank</h3>

<p>The Latin word <em>ordo</em> (plural <em>ordines</em>) refers to a social distinction that is translated variously into English as &quot;class, order, rank,&quot; none of which is exact. One purpose of the <a href="Roman_census" title="wikilink">Roman census</a> was to determine the <em>ordo</em> to which an individual belonged. The two highest <em>ordines</em> in Rome were the senatorial and equestrian. Outside Rome, the <a href="decurion_(administrative)" title="wikilink">decurions</a>, also known as <em><a href="curiales" class="uri" title="wikilink">curiales</a></em> (Greek <em>bouleutai</em>), were the top governing <em>ordo</em> of an individual city.</p>

A senator also had to meet a minimum property requirement of 1 million <em><a href="sestertii" class="uri" title="wikilink">sestertii</a>,</em> as determined by the <a href="Roman_census" title="wikilink">census</a>.<a href="#fn113" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref113"><sup>113</sup></a> Nero made large gifts of money to a number of senators from old families who had become too impoverished to qualify.

<p>Senators had an aura of prestige and were the traditional governing class who rose through the <em><a href="cursus_honorum" title="wikilink">cursus honorum</a></em>, the political career track, but equestrians of the Empire often possessed greater wealth and political power. Membership in the equestrian order was based on property; in Rome's early days, <em>equites</em> or knights had been distinguished by their ability to serve as mounted warriors (the &quot;public horse&quot;), but cavalry service was a separate function in the Empire.<a href="#fn120" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref120"><sup>120</sup></a> A census valuation of 400,000 sesterces and three generations of free birth qualified a man as an equestrian.<a href="#fn121" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref121"><sup>121</sup></a> The census of 28 BC uncovered large numbers of men who qualified, and in 14 AD, a thousand equestrians were registered at <a href="Cadiz" class="uri" title="wikilink">Cadiz</a> and <a href="Padua" class="uri" title="wikilink">Padua</a> alone.<a href="#fn122" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref122"><sup>122</sup></a> Equestrians rose through a military career track <em>(<a href="tres_militiae" title="wikilink">tres militiae</a>)</em> to become highly placed <a href="prefect" title="wikilink">prefects</a> and <a href="procurator_(Roman)" title="wikilink">procurators</a> within the Imperial administration.<a href="#fn123" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref123"><sup>123</sup></a></p>

In antiquity, a city depended on its leading citizens to fund public works, events, and services <em>(munera)</em>, rather than on tax revenues, which primarily supported the military. Maintaining one's rank required massive personal expenditures.<a href="#fn126" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref126"><sup>126</sup></a> Decurions were so vital for the functioning of cities that in the later Empire, as the ranks of the town councils became depleted, those who had risen to the Senate were encouraged by the central government to give up their seats and return to their hometowns, in an effort to sustain civic life.<a href="#fn127" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref127"><sup>127</sup></a></p>

<p>The three major elements of the Imperial Roman state were the central government, the military, and provincial government.<a href="#fn137" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref137"><sup>137</sup></a> The military established control of a territory through war, but after a city or people was brought under treaty, the military mission turned to policing: protecting Roman citizens (after 212 AD, all freeborn inhabitants of the Empire), the agricultural fields that fed them, and religious sites.<a href="#fn138" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref138"><sup>138</sup></a> Without modern instruments of either mass communication or mass destruction, the Romans lacked sufficient manpower or resources to impose their rule through force alone. <a href="Local_government_(ancient_Roman)" title="wikilink">Cooperation with local power elites</a> was necessary to maintain order, collect information, and extract revenue.

<p>Communities with demonstrated loyalty to Rome retained their own laws, could collect their own taxes locally, and in exceptional cases were exempt from Roman taxation.

<h3 id="central-government">Central government</h3>

<p>The dominance of the emperor was based on the consolidation of certain powers from several republican offices, including the inviolability of the <a href="Plebeian_Tribune" title="wikilink">tribunes of the people</a> and the authority of the <a href="Roman_Censors" title="wikilink">censors</a> to manipulate the hierarchy of Roman society.<a href="#fn142" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref142"><sup>142</sup></a> The emperor also made himself the central religious authority as <a href="Pontifex_Maximus" title="wikilink">Pontifex Maximus</a>, and centralized the right to declare war, ratify treaties, and negotiate with foreign leaders.<a href="#fn143" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref143"><sup>143</sup></a> While these functions were clearly defined during the <a href="Principate" class="uri" title="wikilink">Principate</a>, the emperor's powers over time became less constitutional and more monarchical, culminating in the <a href="Dominate" class="uri" title="wikilink">Dominate</a>.<a href="#fn144" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref144"><sup>144</sup></a></p>

<p>The emperor was the ultimate authority in policy- and decision-making, but in the early Principate he was expected to be accessible to individuals from all walks of life, and to deal personally with official business and petitions. A bureaucracy formed around him only gradually.<a href="#fn145" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref145"><sup>145</sup></a> The Julio-Claudian emperors relied on an informal body of advisors that included not only senators and equestrians, but trusted slaves and freedmen.<a href="#fn146" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref146"><sup>146</sup></a> After Nero, the unofficial influence of the latter was regarded with suspicion, and the emperor's council <em>(consilium)</em> became subject to official appointment for the sake of greater <a href="Open_government" title="wikilink">transparency</a>.<a href="#fn147" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref147"><sup>147</sup></a> Though the senate took a lead in policy discussions until the end of the <a href="Antonine_dynasty" title="wikilink">Antonine dynasty</a>, equestrians played an increasingly important role in the <em>consilium.</em><a href="#fn148" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref148"><sup>148</sup></a> The women of the emperor's family often intervened directly in his decisions. <a href="Plotina" class="uri" title="wikilink">Plotina</a> exercised influence on both her husband Trajan and his successor Hadrian.

<p>Access to the emperor by others might be gained at the daily reception <em>(salutatio)</em>, a development of the traditional homage a client paid to his patron; public banquets hosted at the palace; and religious ceremonies. The common people who lacked this access could manifest their general approval or displeasure as a group at the games held in large venues.<a href="#fn150" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref150"><sup>150</sup></a> By the 4th century, as urban centers decayed, the Christian emperors became remote figureheads who issued general rulings, no longer responding to individual petitions.<a href="#fn151" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref151"><sup>151</sup></a></p>
<p>Although the senate could do little short of assassination and open rebellion to contravene the will of the emperor, it survived the Augustan restoration and the turbulent Year of Four Emperors to retain its symbolic political centrality during the Principate.<a href="#fn152" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref152"><sup>152</sup></a> The senate legitimated the emperor's rule, and the emperor needed the experience of senators as legates <em>(<a href="legatus" title="wikilink">legati</a>)</em> to serve as generals, diplomats, and administrators.<a href="#fn153" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref153"><sup>153</sup></a> A successful career required competence as an administrator and remaining in favor with the emperor, or over time perhaps multiple emperors.<a href="#fn154" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref154"><sup>154</sup></a></p>
<p>The practical source of an emperor's power and authority was the military. The legionaries were paid by the Imperial treasury, and swore an annual military oath of loyalty to the emperor <em>(<a href="Sacramentum_(oath)" title="wikilink">sacramentum</a>)</em>.<a href="#fn155" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref155"><sup>155</sup></a> The death of an emperor led to a crucial period of uncertainty and crisis. Most emperors indicated their choice of successor, usually a close family member or <a href="Adoption_in_ancient_Rome" title="wikilink">adopted</a> heir. The new emperor had to seek a swift acknowledgement of his status and authority in order to stabilize the political landscape. No emperor could hope to survive, much less to reign, without the allegiance and loyalty of the <a href="Praetorian_Guard" title="wikilink">Praetorian Guard</a> and of the legions. To secure their loyalty, several emperors paid the <em><a href="donativum" class="uri" title="wikilink">donativum</a></em>, a monetary reward. In theory, the Senate was entitled to choose the new emperor, but did so mindful of acclamation by the army or Praetorians.<a href="#fn156" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref156"><sup>156</sup></a></p>

The transition to a professional military had begun during the late Republic, and was one of the many profound shifts away from republicanism, under which an army of <a href="conscripts" class="uri" title="wikilink">conscripts</a> had exercised their responsibilities as citizens in defending the homeland in a campaign against a specific threat. For Imperial Rome, the military was a full-time career in itself.<a href="#fn157" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref157"><sup>157</sup></a></p>
<p>The primary mission of the Roman military of the early empire was to preserve the <a href="Pax_Romana" title="wikilink">Pax Romana</a>.<a href="#fn158" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref158"><sup>158</sup></a> The three major divisions of the military were:</p>

<li>the provincial army, comprising the <a href="Roman_legions" title="wikilink">Roman legions</a> and the auxiliaries provided by the provinces <em>(<a href="auxilia" class="uri" title="wikilink">auxilia</a></em>);</li>
<li>the <a href="Roman_navy" title="wikilink">navy</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The pervasiveness of military garrisons throughout the Empire was a major influence in the process of cultural exchange and <a href="cultural_assimilation" title="wikilink">assimilation</a> known as &quot;<a href="Romanization_(cultural)" title="wikilink">Romanization</a>,&quot; particularly in regard to politics, the economy, and religion.<a href="#fn159" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref159"><sup>159</sup></a> Knowledge of the Roman military comes from a wide range of sources: Greek and Roman literary texts; coins with military themes; <a href="papyri" class="uri" title="wikilink">papyri</a> preserving military documents; monuments such as <a href="Trajan&#39;s_Column" title="wikilink">Trajan's Column</a> and <a href="triumphal_arch" title="wikilink">triumphal arches</a>, which feature artistic depictions of both fighting men and military machines; the archaeology of military burials, battle sites, and camps; and inscriptions, including <a href="Roman_military_diploma" title="wikilink">military diplomas</a>, epitaphs, and dedications.<a href="#fn160" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref160"><sup>160</sup></a></p>
<p>Through his military reforms, which included consolidating or disbanding units of questionable loyalty, Augustus changed and regularized the legion, down to the <a href="hobnail" class="uri" title="wikilink">hobnail</a> pattern on the soles of army boots.<a href="#fn161" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref161"><sup>161</sup></a> A legion was organized into ten <a href="Cohort_(military_unit)" title="wikilink">cohorts</a>, each of which comprised six <a href="centuria" title="wikilink">centuries</a>, with a century further made up of ten squads <em>(<a href="contubernium" title="wikilink">contubernia</a>)</em>; the exact size of the Imperial legion, which is most likely to have been determined by <a href="military_logistics" title="wikilink">logistics</a>, has been estimated to range from 4,800 to 5,280.<a href="#fn162" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref162"><sup>162</sup></a></p>
<p>In AD 9, Germanic tribes wiped out three full legions in the <a href="Battle_of_the_Teutoburg_Forest" title="wikilink">Battle of the Teutoburg Forest</a>.

No more than 2 percent of adult males living in the Empire served in the Imperial army.<a href="#fn164" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref164"><sup>164</sup></a></p>
<p><img src="Praetorian_GuardSoldiers_basrelief_med.jpg" title="fig:Praetorian guards (1st century AD relief)" alt="Praetorian guards (1st century AD relief)" /> Augustus also created the <a href="Praetorian_Guard" title="wikilink">Praetorian Guard</a>: nine cohorts, ostensibly to maintain the public peace, which were garrisoned in Italy.

<p>The <em><a href="Auxiliaries_(Roman_military)" title="wikilink">auxilia</a></em> were recruited from among the non-citizens. Organized in smaller units of roughly cohort strength, they were paid less than the legionaries, and after 25 years of service were rewarded with <a href="Roman_citizenship" title="wikilink">Roman citizenship</a>, also extended to their sons. According to <a href="Tacitus" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tacitus</a><a href="#fn166" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref166"><sup>166</sup></a> there were roughly as many auxiliaries as there were legionaries.

<p>The <a href="Roman_navy" title="wikilink">Roman navy</a> (Latin: <em>classis,</em> &quot;fleet&quot;) not only aided in the supply and transport of the legions, but also helped in the protection of the <a href="limes" title="wikilink">frontiers</a> along the rivers <a href="Rhine" class="uri" title="wikilink">Rhine</a> and <a href="Danube" class="uri" title="wikilink">Danube</a>.

<p>The programme of urban renewal under Augustus, and the growth of Rome's population to as many as 1 million people, was accompanied by a nostalgia for rural life expressed in the arts. Poetry praised the idealized lives of farmers and shepherds. The interiors of houses were often decorated with painted gardens, fountains, landscapes, vegetative ornament,<a href="#fn310" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref310"><sup>310</sup></a> and animals, especially birds and marine life, rendered accurately enough that modern scholars can sometimes identify them by species.<a href="#fn311" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref311"><sup>311</sup></a> The Augustan poet <a href="Horace" class="uri" title="wikilink">Horace</a> gently satirized the dichotomy of urban and rural values in his fable of <a href="The_Town_Mouse_and_the_Country_Mouse" title="wikilink">the city mouse and the country mouse</a>, which has often been retold as a children's story.<a href="#fn312" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref312"><sup>312</sup></a></p>

<h3 id="clothing">Clothing</h3>

<p>In a status-conscious society like that of the Romans, clothing and personal adornment gave immediate visual clues about the etiquette of interacting with the wearer.<a href="#fn403" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref403"><sup>403</sup></a> Wearing the correct clothing was supposed to reflect a society in good order.<a href="#fn404" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref404"><sup>404</sup></a> The <a href="toga" class="uri" title="wikilink">toga</a> was the distinctive national garment of the Roman male citizen, but it was heavy and impractical, worn mainly for conducting political business and religious rites, and for going to court.<a href="#fn405" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref405"><sup>405</sup></a> Contrary to popular perception, the clothing Romans wore ordinarily was dark or colorful, and the most common male attire seen daily throughout the provinces would have been tunics, cloaks, and in some regions <a href="braccae" title="wikilink">trousers</a>.<a href="#fn406" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref406"><sup>406</sup></a> The study of how Romans dressed in daily life is complicated by a lack of direct evidence, since portraiture may show the subject in clothing with symbolic value, and surviving textiles from the period are rare.<a href="#fn407" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref407"><sup>407</sup></a></p>

The length differed by wearer: a man's reached mid-calf, but a soldier's was somewhat shorter; a woman's fell to her feet, and a child's to its knees.<a href="#fn408" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref408"><sup>408</sup></a> The tunics of poor people and laboring slaves were made from coarse wool in natural, dull shades, with the length determined by the type of work they did. Finer tunics were made of lightweight wool or linen. A man who belonged to the senatorial or equestrian order wore a tunic with two purple stripes <em>(clavi)</em> woven vertically into the fabric: the wider the stripe, the higher the wearer's status.<a href="#fn409" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref409"><sup>409</sup></a> Other garments could be layered over the tunic.</p>
<p>The Imperial toga was a &quot;vast expanse&quot; of semi-circular white wool that could not be put on and draped correctly without assistance.<a href="#fn410" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref410"><sup>410</sup></a> In his work on oratory, <a href="Quintilian" class="uri" title="wikilink">Quintilian</a> describes in detail how the public speaker ought to orchestrate his gestures in relation to his toga.<a href="#fn411" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref411"><sup>411</sup></a> In art, the toga is shown with the long end dipping between the feet, a deep curved fold in front, and a bulbous flap at the midsection.<a href="#fn412" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref412"><sup>412</sup></a> The drapery became more intricate and structured over time, with the cloth forming a tight roll across the chest in later periods.<a href="#fn413" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref413"><sup>413</sup></a> The <em>toga praetexta</em>, with a <a href="Tyrian_purple" title="wikilink">purple or purplish-red</a> stripe representing inviolability, was worn by children who had not come of age, <a href="Executive_magistrates_of_the_Roman_Empire" title="wikilink">curule magistrates</a>, and state priests.<a href="#fn414" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref414"><sup>414</sup></a> Only the emperor could wear an all-purple toga <em>(toga picta)</em>.<a href="#fn415" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref415"><sup>415</sup></a></p>

<p>In the 2nd century, emperors and men of status are often portrayed wearing the <a href="pallium" class="uri" title="wikilink">pallium</a>, an originally Greek mantle <em>(<a href="himation" class="uri" title="wikilink">himation</a>)</em> folded tightly around the body.

<p>Despite the high value placed on works of art, even famous artists were of low social status among the Greeks and Romans, who regarded artists, artisans, and craftsmen alike as manual laborers.

<h3 id="portraiture">Portraiture</h3>


<p>Portraiture, which survives mainly in the medium of sculpture, was the most copious form of imperial art.

<p>Temples housed the cult images of deities, often by famed sculptors.<a href="#fn435" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref435"><sup>435</sup></a> The religiosity of the Romans encouraged the production of decorated altars, small representations of deities for the household shrine or votive offerings, and other pieces for dedicating at temples.

In addition to decorative borders and panels with geometric or vegetative motifs, wall painting depicts scenes from mythology and the theatre, landscapes and gardens, <a href="#Recreation_and_spectacles" title="wikilink">recreation and spectacles</a>, work and everyday life, and <a href="Erotic_art_in_Pompeii_and_Herculaneum" title="wikilink">frank pornography</a>.

<p><a href="Figurative_art" title="wikilink">Figurative</a> mosaics share many themes with painting, and in some cases portray subject matter in almost identical <a href="Composition_(visual_arts)" title="wikilink">compositions</a>. Although geometric patterns and mythological scenes occur throughout the Empire, regional preferences also find expression.

Ovid's erotic poetry was enormously popular, but ran afoul of the Augustan moral programme; it was one of the ostensible causes for which the emperor exiled him to Tomis (present-day <a href="Constan&lt;U+0163&gt;a" class="uri" title="wikilink">Constan&lt;U+0163&gt;a</a>, Romania), where he remained to the end of his life.

The Romans thought of themselves as highly religious, and attributed their success as a world power to their collective piety <em>(<a href="pietas" class="uri" title="wikilink">pietas</a>)</em> in maintaining good relations with the gods <em>(<a href="pax_deorum" title="wikilink">pax deorum</a>)</em>. The archaic religion believed to have been handed down from the earliest <a href="kings_of_Rome" title="wikilink">kings of Rome</a> was the foundation of the <em><a href="mos_maiorum" title="wikilink">mos maiorum</a></em>, &quot;the way of the ancestors&quot; or &quot;tradition&quot;, viewed as central to Roman identity. There was no principle analogous to &quot;<a href="separation_of_church_and_state" title="wikilink">separation of church and state</a>&quot;. The priesthoods of the state religion were filled from the same social pool of men who held public office, and in the Imperial era, the <a href="Pontifex_Maximus" title="wikilink">Pontifex Maximus</a> was the emperor.</p>
<p>Roman religion was practical and contractual, based on the principle of <em><a href="do_ut_des" title="wikilink">do ut des</a></em>, &quot;I give that you might give.&quot; Religion depended on knowledge and the <a href="orthopraxy" title="wikilink">correct practice</a> of prayer, ritual, and sacrifice, not on faith or dogma, although Latin literature preserves learned speculation on the nature of the divine and its relation to human affairs. For ordinary Romans, religion was a part of daily life.<a href="#fn562" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref562"><sup>562</sup></a> Each home had a household shrine at which prayers and <a href="libation" title="wikilink">libations</a> to the family's domestic deities were offered. Neighborhood shrines and sacred places such as springs and groves dotted the city. <a href="Apuleius" class="uri" title="wikilink">Apuleius</a> (2nd century) described the everyday quality of religion in observing how people who passed a cult place might make a vow or a fruit offering, or merely sit for a while.<a href="#fn563" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref563"><sup>563</sup></a> The <a href="Roman_calendar" title="wikilink">Roman calendar</a> was structured around religious observances. In the Imperial era, as many as 135 days of the year were devoted to <a href="Roman_festivals" title="wikilink">religious festivals</a> and games (<em><a href="ludi" class="uri" title="wikilink">ludi</a>)</em>.<a href="#fn564" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref564"><sup>564</sup></a> Women, slaves, and children all participated in a range of religious activities.</p>
<p>In the wake of the <a href="Collapse_of_the_Roman_Republic" title="wikilink">Republic's collapse</a>, state religion had adapted to support the new regime of the emperors. As the first Roman emperor, Augustus justified the novelty of one-man rule with a vast program of religious revivalism and reform. <a href="Vota_pro_salute_rei_publicae" title="wikilink">Public vows</a> formerly made for the security of the republic now were directed at the wellbeing of the emperor. So-called &quot;emperor worship&quot; expanded on a grand scale the traditional Roman <a href="Roman_funerals_and_burial" title="wikilink">veneration of the ancestral dead</a> and of the <em><a href="Genius_(mythology)" title="wikilink">Genius</a></em>, the divine <a href="tutelary_deity" title="wikilink">tutelary</a> of every individual. Upon death, an emperor could be made a state divinity (<em><a href="divus" class="uri" title="wikilink">divus</a></em>) by vote of the Senate. <a href="Imperial_cult_(ancient_Rome)" title="wikilink">Imperial cult</a>, influenced by <a href="Hellenistic_ruler_cult" title="wikilink">Hellenistic ruler cult</a>, became one of the major ways Rome advertised its presence in the provinces and cultivated shared cultural identity and loyalty throughout the Empire.

<p><a href="Mystery_religions" title="wikilink">Mystery religions</a>, which offered initiates salvation in the afterlife, were a matter of personal choice for an individual, practiced in addition to carrying on one's <a href="sacra_gentilicia" title="wikilink">family rites</a> and participating in public religion. The mysteries, however, involved exclusive oaths and secrecy, conditions that conservative Romans viewed with suspicion as characteristic of &quot;<a href="Magic_in_the_Greco-Roman_world" title="wikilink">magic</a>&quot;, conspiracy (<em>coniuratio</em>), and subversive activity. Sporadic and sometimes brutal attempts were made to suppress religionists who seemed to threaten traditional morality and unity. In Gaul, the power of the <a href="druid" title="wikilink">druids</a> was checked, first by forbidding Roman citizens to belong to the order, and then by banning druidism altogether. At the same time, however, Celtic traditions were <a href="interpretatio_romana" title="wikilink">reinterpreted</a> within Imperial theology, and a new <a href="Gallo-Roman_religion" title="wikilink">Gallo-Roman religion</a> coalesced, with its capital at the <a href="Sanctuary_of_the_Three_Gauls" title="wikilink">Sanctuary of the Three Gauls</a> in <a href="Lugdunum" class="uri" title="wikilink">Lugdunum</a> (present-day Lyon, France).
