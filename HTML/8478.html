<p><strong>Alexis Bachelot</strong> (born <strong>John Augustine Bachelot</strong>, February 22, 1796 &lt;U+2013&gt; December 5, 1837) was a <a href="Roman_Catholic_priest" title="wikilink">Roman Catholic priest</a> best known for his tenure as the first <a href="Prefecture_Apostolic_of_the_Sandwich_Islands" title="wikilink">Prefect Apostolic of the Sandwich Islands</a>. In that role, he led the first permanent Catholic <a href="Mission_(Christianity)" title="wikilink">mission</a> to the <a href="Kingdom_of_Hawaii" title="wikilink">Kingdom of Hawaii</a>. Bachelot was raised in France, where he attended the <a href="Irish_College_in_Paris" title="wikilink">Irish College in Paris</a>, and was ordained a priest in 1820. He led the first Catholic mission to Hawaii, arriving in 1827. Although he had expected the approval of then Hawaiian King <a href="Kamehameha&amp;nbsp;II" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kamehameha&amp;nbsp;II</a>, he learned upon arrival that Kamehameha II had died and a new government that was hostile towards Catholic missionaries had been installed. Bachelot, however, was able to convert and then quietly minister to a small group of Hawaiians for four years before being deported in 1831 on the orders of <a href="Ka&lt;U+02BB&gt;ahumanu" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ka&lt;U+02BB&gt;ahumanu</a>, the <em><a href="Kuhina_Nui" title="wikilink">Kuhina Nui</a></em> (a position similar to <a href="regent" title="wikilink">queen regent</a>) of Hawaii.</p>
<p>Bachelot then traveled to California, where he served as an assistant minister while pastoring and teaching. In 1837, having learned of Queen Ka&lt;U+02BB&gt;ahumanu's death and King <a href="Kamehameha&amp;nbsp;III" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kamehameha&amp;nbsp;III</a>'s willingness to allow Catholic priests on the island, Bachelot returned to Hawaii, intending to continue his missionary work. However, by Bacehlot's arrival, Kamehameha III had again changed his mind and Bachelot was removed from the island and confined to a ship for several months. He was freed only after the French and British navies imposed a naval blockade on the Honolulu harbor. Although he was later able to secure passage on a ship to <a href="Micronesia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Micronesia</a>, he died en route and was buried on an islet near <a href="Pohnpei" class="uri" title="wikilink">Pohnpei</a>. His treatment in Hawaii prompted the <a href="July_Monarchy" title="wikilink">government of France</a> to dispatch a frigate to the island; the resulting intervention is known as <a href="French_Incident_(Hawaii)" title="wikilink">The French Incident</a> and led to the emancipation of Catholics in Hawaii.</p>

<p>Jean Augustin Bachelot was born in <a href="Saint-Cyr-la-Rosi&lt;U+00E8&gt;re" class="uri" title="wikilink">Saint-Cyr-la-Rosi&lt;U+00E8&gt;re</a>, <a href="Orne" class="uri" title="wikilink">Orne</a>, France on February 22, 1796.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> In 1806, he left home for Paris, where he enrolled in the Preparatory <a href="Seminary" class="uri" title="wikilink">Seminary</a> of Piepus to pursue priesthood. In 1813, he <a href="Profession_(religious)" title="wikilink">professed</a> at the <a href="Congregation_of_the_Sacred_Hearts_of_Jesus_and_Mary" title="wikilink">Congregation of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary</a>,<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> taking the name Alexis.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> He studied at the Irish College in Paris before being <a href="Holy_Orders" title="wikilink">ordained</a> as a priest in 1820. As a priest, he initially served as the College's <a href="rector" class="uri" title="wikilink">rector</a> and later led the preparatory seminary at <a href="Tours" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tours</a>.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="hawaiian-mission">Hawaiian mission</h2>
<p>In the early 1820s, <a href="Jean_Baptiste_Rives" title="wikilink">Jean Baptiste Rives</a>, a French adviser to the Hawaiian king <a href="Kamehameha&amp;nbsp;II" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kamehameha&amp;nbsp;II</a>, traveled to Europe to attempt to convince European Catholics to organize a mission to Hawaii. Members of the Congregation of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary were receptive to his idea,<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> and in 1825, <a href="Pope_Leo&amp;nbsp;XII" title="wikilink">Pope Leo&amp;nbsp;XII</a> assigned them the task of evangelizing Hawaii.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> Bachelot was appointed the Prefect Apostolic of the Sandwich Islands, and in this role led the first permanent mission to Hawaii.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p>The expedition was organized by the influential <a href="Monneron_family" title="wikilink">Monneron family</a> and funded by the <a href="Bourbon_Restoration" title="wikilink">government of France</a>. Bachelot was assisted in his new position by fellow priests <a href="Patrick_Short" title="wikilink">Patrick Short</a> and <a href="Abraham_Armand" title="wikilink">Abraham Armand</a>, as well as several <a href="lay_brother" title="wikilink">lay brothers</a>. The mission sailed from <a href="Bordeaux" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bordeaux</a> on the <em>La Com&lt;U+00E8&gt;te</em> in November 1826. The missionaries were initially accompanied by a group that planned to explore commercial trading opportunities<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> but returned to France after reaching Mexico.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> <img src="Cathedral_of_Our_Lady_of_Peace_east.jpg" title="fig:Cathedral of Our Lady of Peace in 2006" alt="Cathedral of Our Lady of Peace in 2006" /> Unbeknownst to Bachelot, political changes occurred in Hawaii prior to the mission's arrival. King  died in 1824 and his younger brother  became king.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> Because  was young at the time of his ascension, Queen Ka&lt;U+02BB&gt;ahumanu (their stepmother) ruled as <em>Kuhina Nui</em>.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> On the advice of <a href="Hiram_Bingham_I" title="wikilink">Hiram </a>&lt;U+2014&gt;a Protestant missionary who had converted the Hawaiian royalty four years previously&lt;U+2014&gt;Queen Ka&lt;U+02BB&gt;ahumanu took a hard stance against Catholicism. Rives' influence on the Hawaiian government had faded,<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> and he never returned to Hawaii.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<p>The <em>La Com&lt;U+00E8&gt;te</em> arrived in <a href="Honolulu" class="uri" title="wikilink">Honolulu</a> on July 7, 1827. The priests were faced with a situation of dire poverty owing to the absence of Rives' patronage.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> Furthermore, they had promised the <em>La Com&lt;U+00E8&gt;te's</em> captain that Rives would pay for their passage after they arrived in Hawaii, but by the time of their arrival, Rives had already left Hawaii.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> Queen Ka&lt;U+02BB&gt;ahumanu refused to allow the missionaries to stay in Hawaii, suspecting them to be covert agents of the government of France.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> She instructed the <em>La Com&lt;U+00E8&gt;te's</em> captain to take the mission with him when he departed.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> The captain, however, refused to do so because he did not receive payment for their passage, so the party was able to remain.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> The priests began their missionary work, but encountered suspicion from most chiefs. The members of the party had great difficulty defending themselves, as none of them were fluent in English or Hawaiian.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> The group received a favorable response, however, when they met high chief <a href="Boki_(Hawaiian_chief)" title="wikilink">Boki</a>,<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> the royal governor of Oahu, and his wife <a href="Kuini_Liliha" title="wikilink">Kuini Liliha</a>. (The couple were Catholic converts and rivals of Queen Ka&lt;U+02BB&gt;ahumanu.) Boki welcomed the party and gave its members permission to stay.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a></p>
<p>For several months, Bachelot and his fellow missionaries lived in three small rented structures,<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> saying their first mass on the island in a grass hut.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> They later built a chapel on a small plot of land they purchased,<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> where the <a href="Cathedral_of_Our_Lady_of_Peace" title="wikilink">Cathedral of Our Lady of Peace</a><a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> was dedicated in 1843.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> After settling on the island, the group avoided drawing attention to themselves and studied the <a href="Hawaiian_language" title="wikilink">Hawaiian language</a>.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> During their mission's first two years, the group converted 65 Hawaiians<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> and ministered to Hawaiians who had already been converted.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> They often held surreptitious night-time meetings with converts who feared persecution.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> The priests' vestments and rituals made their evangelism efforts more effective because they reminded Hawaiians of native religious customs.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a></p>
<p>Bachelot introduced two plant species to Hawaii: <em><a href="Prosopis_humilis" title="wikilink">Prosopis humilis</a></em><a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> and the <em><a href="Bougainvillea" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bougainvillea</a></em>.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> <em>Prosopis humilis</em> trees later covered thousands of acres there.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> He had obtained the seeds, which were originally gathered by Catholic missionaries in California, from the Royal Conservatory in Paris.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> Bachelot translated a prayer book into Hawaiian (<em>O Ke A'o Ana Kristiano</em>, &quot;Christian Doctrine&quot;, c. 1831),<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> authored a <a href="catechism" class="uri" title="wikilink">catechism</a> in Hawaiian (<em>He &lt;U+014C&gt;lelo Ho'ona'auao</em>, &quot;A Word of Instruction&quot;, 1831),<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> and wrote an introduction to Hawaiian grammar in French (<em>Notes Gramaticales</em>, &quot;Grammatical Notes&quot;, 1834).<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a></p>

<p>The news of Bachelot and Short's expulsion caused controversy in the United States, where it was viewed as a violation of the rights appertaining to foreigners in the 1826 treaty signed by Commodore <a href="Thomas_ap_Catesby_Jones" title="wikilink">Thomas ap Catesby Jones</a> of the <a href="United_States_Navy" title="wikilink">United States Navy</a> and King .
