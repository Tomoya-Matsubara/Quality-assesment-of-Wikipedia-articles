<p><strong>J&lt;U+00E6&gt;nberht</strong> (also <strong>Jambert</strong>, <strong>Jaenbeorht</strong>,<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> <strong>J&lt;U+00E6&gt;nbert</strong>, <strong>Jaenberht</strong>, <strong>Jaenbert</strong>, or <strong>Jaenberht</strong>; died 792) was a medieval <a href="monk" class="uri" title="wikilink">monk</a>, and later the <a href="abbot" class="uri" title="wikilink">abbot</a>, of <a href="Canterbury" title="wikilink">St Augustine's Abbey, Canterbury</a> who was named <a href="Archbishop_of_Canterbury" title="wikilink">Archbishop of Canterbury</a> in 765. As archbishop, he had a difficult relationship with King <a href="Offa_of_Mercia" title="wikilink">Offa of Mercia</a>, who at one point confiscated lands from the archbishopric. By 787, some of the bishoprics under Canterbury's supervision were transferred to the control of the newly-created <a href="Archbishop_of_Lichfield" title="wikilink">Archbishopric of Lichfield</a>, although it is not clear if J&lt;U+00E6&gt;nberht ever recognized its legitimacy. Besides the issue with Lichfield, J&lt;U+00E6&gt;nberht also presided over church councils in England. He died in 792 and was considered a saint after his death.</p>
<h2 id="early-life">Early life</h2>
<p>J&lt;U+00E6&gt;nberht was a monk at St Augustine's Abbey, Canterbury before being selected as abbot of that monastic house.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> He came from a prominent family in the kingdom of Kent, and a kinsman of his, Eadhun, was the <a href="Reeve_(England)" title="wikilink">reeve</a> of King <a href="Egbert_II_of_Kent" title="wikilink">Egbert II of Kent</a>. J&lt;U+00E6&gt;nberht himself was on good terms with Egbert.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="archbishop-of-canterbury">Archbishop of Canterbury</h2>
<p>J&lt;U+00E6&gt;nberht was consecrated Archbishop of Canterbury on 2 February 765,<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> at the court of King Offa of Mercia; this location implies that his election was acceptable to the king.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> In 766, he received a <a href="pallium" class="uri" title="wikilink">pallium</a>, the symbol of an archbishop's authority given by the papacy. At this time, Kent had been subjected by Offa; in 776, perhaps at the urging of J&lt;U+00E6&gt;nberht, Kent rebelled and secured its freedom.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> In 780 and 781, J&lt;U+00E6&gt;nberht attended church councils at Brentford that were led by King Offa. Although initially on good terms with Offa, J&lt;U+00E6&gt;nberht's ties to Egbert were also strong: after the <a href="Battle_of_Otford" title="wikilink">Battle of Otford</a>, Egbert granted a number of estates to Christ Church. When Offa reasserted control over Kent, which occurred by 785 at the latest, he confiscated these lands and regranted to some of his thegns.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="elevation-of-lichfield">Elevation of Lichfield</h2>
<p>During J&lt;U+00E6&gt;nberht's term of office, a dispute arose between the <a href="see_of_Canterbury" title="wikilink">see of Canterbury</a> and Offa which led in 787 to the creation of the rival <a href="Bishop_of_Lichfield" title="wikilink">Archdiocese of Lichfield</a> under <a href="Hygberht" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hygberht</a>.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> Originally, Offa attempted to bring the southern archbishopric of Canterbury to London, but when the papacy refused permission, Offa secured the creation of a third archbishopric in the British Isles. Lichfield was the main Mercian bishopric, and thus the new archbishopric was under Offa's control.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> There were several reasons for the conflict between J&lt;U+00E6&gt;nberht and Offa. J&lt;U+00E6&gt;nberht's opposed Offa's deposition of the Kentish dynasty. They conflicted over land which they both claimed as theirs, and J&lt;U+00E6&gt;nberht refused to crown Offa's son <a href="Ecgfrith_of_Mercia" title="wikilink">Ecgfrith</a>.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> Problems were also caused by the archbishop minting his own coins at Canterbury.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> <a href="Matthew_Paris" title="wikilink">Matthew Paris</a>, writing in the thirteenth century, stated that J&lt;U+00E6&gt;nberht conspired to admit <a href="Charlemagne" class="uri" title="wikilink">Charlemagne</a> to Canterbury if he invaded Britain. This story may reflect a genuine tradition recorded at <a href="St_Albans_Abbey" title="wikilink">St Albans Abbey</a>, where Paris was based, or it may be a fabrication to fill in details of J&lt;U+00E6&gt;nberht's life where Paris had no other information.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> A rumour during J&lt;U+00E6&gt;nberht's reign also falsely claimed that Offa was plotting with Charlemagne to depose Pope <a href="Pope_Hadrian_I" title="wikilink">Hadrian I</a>; at least one modern historian, <a href="Simon_Keynes" title="wikilink">Simon Keynes</a>, believes it possible J&lt;U+00E6&gt;nberht was behind the rumour.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> Offa's eventual successor later admitted to the papacy that Offa's actions had been motivated by hatred of J&lt;U+00E6&gt;nberht and the Kentish people.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<p>In 787, Pope Hadrian sent a <a href="pallium" class="uri" title="wikilink">pallium</a> to Hygberht of Lichfield, elevating Lichfield to an archbishopric, and Ecgfrith was crowned. There is no extant contemporary evidence, however, that J&lt;U+00E6&gt;nberht ever recognized Hygberht as an archbishop.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a>{{#tag:ref|The archbishopric at Lichfield was abolished after Offa's death, and was no longer an archdiocese by 803.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a>|group=notes}} Canterbury retained as suffragans the bishops of Winchester, Sherborne, Selsey, Rochester, and London. The dioceses of Worcester, Hereford, Leicester, Lindsey, Dommoc and Elmham were transferred to Lichfield.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="later-life">Later life</h2>
<p>J&lt;U+00E6&gt;nberht presided at a council held at London, sometime after the elevation of Lichfield, attended by most of the bishops from southern Britain.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> J&lt;U+00E6&gt;nberht died on 12 August 792.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a><a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> J&lt;U+00E6&gt;nberht was buried in the abbey church of St Augustine's Abbey in Canterbury.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a><a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> J&lt;U+00E6&gt;nberht has since been revered as a saint, with a feast day of 12 August.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a></p>
