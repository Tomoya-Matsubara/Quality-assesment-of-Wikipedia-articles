He is a member of the <a href="Basketball_Hall_of_Fame" title="wikilink">Basketball Hall of Fame</a> as both a player (class of 1961) and as a coach (class of 1973).

<p>After graduating in 1928, he attended <a href="Purdue_University" title="wikilink">Purdue University</a> and was coached by <a href="Ward_Lambert" title="wikilink">Ward &quot;Piggy&quot; Lambert</a>. He helped lead the <a href="Purdue_Boilermakers_men&#39;s_basketball" title="wikilink">Boilermakers</a> to the 1932 National Championship, as determined by a panel vote rather than the NCAA tournament, which did not begin until 1939.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> John Wooden was named All-Big Ten and All-Midwestern (1930–32) while at Purdue, and he was the first player ever to be named a three-time consensus All-American.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> He was also selected for membership in the <a href="Beta_Theta_Pi" title="wikilink">Beta Theta Pi</a> fraternity.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> Wooden is also an honorary member of the International Co-Ed Fraternity <a href="Alpha_Phi_Omega" title="wikilink">Alpha Phi Omega</a>.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> Wooden was nicknamed &quot;The Indiana Rubber Man&quot; for his suicidal dives on the hardcourt.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> He graduated from Purdue in 1932 with a degree in English.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>

<h2 id="family-and-faith">Family and faith</h2>
<p>Wooden is the son of Roxie Anna and Joshua Hugh Wooden.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> He had three brothers:<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> Maurice, Daniel, and William.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> His two sisters died before reaching the age of three. One was unnamed and died in infancy,<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> while Cordelia died from diphtheria when she was two.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a></p>
<p>Wooden met his future wife, Nellie Riley, at a carnival in July 1926.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> They married in a small ceremony in <a href="Indianapolis" class="uri" title="wikilink">Indianapolis</a> in August 1932. Afterwards, they attended a <a href="Mills_Brothers" title="wikilink">Mills Brothers</a> concert at the Circle Theatre to celebrate.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> John and his wife had a son, James Hugh Wooden, and a daughter, Nancy Anne Muehlhausen.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> Nellie died on March 21, 1985<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> from cancer.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a></p>
<p>Wooden has remained devoted to Nellie, even decades after her death. Since her death, he has kept to a monthly ritual (health permitting)&lt;U+2014&gt;on the 21st, he visits her grave, and then writes a love letter to her. After completing the letter, he places it in an envelope and adds it to a stack of similar letters that has accumulated over the years on the pillow she slept on during their life together.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a></p>
<p>In mourning Nellie's death, Wooden has been comforted by his faith.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> He has been a Christian for many years and his beliefs are more important to him than basketball, &quot;I have always tried to make it clear that basketball is not the ultimate. It is of small importance in comparison to the total life we live. There is only one kind of life that truly wins, and that is the one that places faith in the hands of the Savior.&quot;<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> Wooden's faith has strongly influenced his life. He reads the Bible daily and attends the First Christian Church.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> He has said that he hopes his faith is apparent to others, &quot;If I were ever prosecuted for my religion, I truly hope there would be enough evidence to convict me.&quot;<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="coaching-career">Coaching career</h2>
<h3 id="high-school">High school</h3>
<p>Wooden coached two years at <a href="Dayton,_Kentucky" title="wikilink">Dayton</a> High School in <a href="Kentucky" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kentucky</a>. His first year at Dayton marked the only time he had a losing record (6–11) as a coach.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> After Dayton, he returned to Indiana, teaching English and coaching basketball at <a href="South_Bend_Community_School_Corporation" title="wikilink">South Bend Central High School</a><a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> until entering the <a href="United_States_Armed_Forces" title="wikilink">Armed Forces</a>.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> His high school coaching record over 11 years, two at Dayton and nine at Central, was 218–42.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="indiana-state-university">Indiana State University</h3>
<p>After World War II, Wooden coached at Indiana Teacher's College (now named <a href="Indiana_State_University" title="wikilink">Indiana State University</a>) in <a href="Terre_Haute,_Indiana" title="wikilink">Terre Haute, Indiana</a>, from 1946 to 1948,<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> succeeding his high school coach, <a href="Glenn_Curtis" title="wikilink">Glenn Curtis</a>.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a> In addition to his duties as basketball coach, Wooden also coached baseball and served as athletic director,<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a><a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a> all while teaching and completing his master's degree in Education.<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a><a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a> In 1947, Wooden's basketball team won the <a href="Indiana_Collegiate_Conference" title="wikilink">Indiana Collegiate Conference</a> title and received an invitation to the <a href="National_Association_of_Intercollegiate_Basketball" title="wikilink">National Association of Intercollegiate Basketball</a> (NAIB) National Tournament in Kansas City. Wooden refused the invitation, citing the NAIB's policy banning <a href="African_American" title="wikilink">African American</a> players.<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a><a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a> One of Wooden's players on the team was Clarence Walker, an African-American athlete from <a href="East_Chicago,_Indiana" title="wikilink">East Chicago, Indiana</a>.<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a></p>
<p>That same year, Wooden's alma mater Purdue University wanted him to return to campus and serve as an assistant to then-head coach <a href="Mel_Taube" title="wikilink">Mel Taube</a> until Taube's contract expired. Then, at that time, Wooden would take over the program. Citing his loyalty to Taube, Wooden declined, as this would have effectively made Taube a <a href="Lame_duck_(politics)" title="wikilink">lame-duck</a> coach.</p>
<p>In 1948, Wooden again led Indiana State to the conference title. The NAIB had reversed its policy banning African-American players that year,<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a> and Wooden coached his team to the NAIB National Tournament final, losing to <a href="University_of_Louisville" title="wikilink">Louisville</a>. This was the only championship game ever lost by a Wooden-coached team. That year, Walker became the first African-American to play in any post-season intercollegiate basketball tournament.<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a> John Wooden was inducted into the Indiana State University Athletic Hall of Fame on February 3, 1984.<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="ucla">UCLA</h3>
<p>After the 1947–48 season, Wooden became the head coach at UCLA, after negotiating for a three-year contract. UCLA had actually been his second choice for a coaching position in 1948. He had also been pursued for the head coaching position at the <a href="Minnesota_Golden_Gophers_men&#39;s_basketball" title="wikilink">University of Minnesota</a>, and it was his and his wife's desire to remain in the <a href="Midwestern_United_States" title="wikilink">Midwest</a>. But inclement weather in Minnesota prevented Wooden from receiving the scheduled phone offer from the Golden Gophers. Thinking that they had lost interest, Wooden accepted the head coaching job with the Bruins instead. Officials from the University of Minnesota contacted Wooden right after he accepted the position at UCLA, but he declined their offer because he had given his word to the Bruins.<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a><a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a></p>
<p>Wooden immediately displayed the rarest quality a coach can effect: &quot;instant turnaround&quot; for an undistinguished, faltering program. In 1948 he took a UCLA team that had a 12–13 losing season the previous year and transformed it into a <a href="Pacific_Coast_Conference" title="wikilink">PCC</a> Southern Division Champion with a 22–7 record,<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a> the most wins for a UCLA season since it started playing basketball in 1919.<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a> He surpassed that number the next season with 24–7 and a second Southern Division Championship and won a third and fourth straight Southern Division Championship his first four years. Up to that time, UCLA had collected a total of two such championships the previous 30 years. By 1956, he guided UCLA to its first undefeated PCC conference title and 17 straight wins until finally falling to the indomitable USF team lead by <a href="Bill_Russell" title="wikilink">Bill Russell</a> in the NCAA Tournament.</p>
<p>In spite of success, Wooden reportedly didn't initially enjoy the position and his wife did not favor living in <a href="Los_Angeles" title="wikilink">Los Angeles</a>. As such, once Mel Taube left Purdue in 1950, Wooden's inclination was to return and finally accept the head coaching job there. He was ultimately dissuaded when UCLA officials reminded him that it was he who insisted upon a three-year commitment during negotiations in 1948. With that in mind, Wooden felt that leaving UCLA prior to the expiration of his contract would be tantamount to breaking his word and thus decided to again pass on the job at Purdue.<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a></p>
<p>During his tenure with the Bruins, Wooden became known as the &quot;Wizard of <a href="Westwood,_Los_Angeles,_California" title="wikilink">Westwood</a>&quot; (although he personally disdained the nickname)<a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a> and gained lasting fame with UCLA by winning 620 games in 27 seasons and 10 NCAA titles during his last 12 seasons, including seven in a row from 1967 to 1973.<a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a> His UCLA teams also had a record winning streak of 88 games<a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a><a href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a> and four perfect 30–0 seasons.<a href="#fn67" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a> They also won 38 straight games in NCAA Tournaments<a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a> and a record 98 straight home game wins at <a href="Pauley_Pavilion" title="wikilink">Pauley Pavilion</a>. Wooden was named NCAA College Basketball's &quot;Coach of the Year&quot; in 1964,1967, 1969, 1970,1971, 1972, 1973, In 1967, he was named the <a href="Henry_Iba_Award" title="wikilink">Henry Iba Award</a> USBWA College Basketball Coach of the Year. In 1973, he received Sports Illustrated magazine's &quot;Sports' Man of the Year&quot; award. Wooden coached his final game in Pauley Pavilion on March 1, 1975, in a 93–59 victory over <a href="Stanford_Cardinal_men&#39;s_basketball" title="wikilink">Stanford</a>. Four weeks later he surprisingly announced his retirement following a 75–74 NCAA semi-final victory, over <a href="Louisville_Cardinals_men&#39;s_basketball" title="wikilink">Louisville</a> and before his 10th national championship game victory over <a href="Kentucky_Wildcats_men&#39;s_basketball" title="wikilink">Kentucky</a>. He was named to the Basketball Hall of Fame as a coach in 1973,<a href="#fn69" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref69"><sup>69</sup></a> becoming the first to be honored as both a player and a coach.<a href="#fn70" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a><a href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a></p>
<p>&quot;He never made more than $35,000 a year salary (not including camps and speaking engagements), including 1975, the year he won his 10th national championship, and never asked for a raise,&quot; wrote <a href="Rick_Reilly" title="wikilink">Rick Reilly</a> of <a href="ESPN" class="uri" title="wikilink">ESPN</a>. He was given a Bruin powder blue Mercedes that season as a retirement gift <a href="#fn72" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref72"><sup>72</sup></a> According to his own writings, Wooden turned down an offer to coach the <a href="Los_Angeles_Lakers" title="wikilink">Los Angeles Lakers</a> from owner <a href="Jack_Kent_Cooke" title="wikilink">Jack Kent Cooke</a> that may have been ten times what UCLA was paying him.</p>

<h2 id="following-wooden">Following Wooden</h2>
<p>Four coaches left UCLA in the nine years following Wooden. One former UCLA head coach, <a href="ESPN" class="uri" title="wikilink">ESPN</a> analyst <a href="Steve_Lavin" title="wikilink">Steve Lavin</a> (fired from UCLA in 2003), has said &quot;The mythology and <a href="pathology" class="uri" title="wikilink">pathology</a> of UCLA basketball isn't going to change&quot; due to Wooden's legacy and believes that every basketball coach will eventually be fired or forced out from UCLA.<a href="#fn106" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref106"><sup>106</sup></a></p>
<p>Wooden's immediate successor at UCLA, <a href="Gene_Bartow" title="wikilink">Gene Bartow</a>, went 28–5 in 1976, but was blown out twice by eventual national champ Indiana, the second time in the '76 Final Four, and lost 76–75 in the 1977 West Region semi-finals to <a href="Idaho_State_University" title="wikilink">Idaho State University</a> Bartow won 85.2% of his games (compared to Wooden's 80.8%) in two years, yet supposedly received death threats from unsatisfied UCLA <a href="Fan_(aficionado)" title="wikilink">fans</a>. Wooden himself has often joked about being a victim of his own success, calling his successors on the phone and playfully identifying himself ominously as &quot;we the <a href="alumni" class="uri" title="wikilink">alumni</a>...&quot;<a href="#fn107" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref107"><sup>107</sup></a> In his autobiography, Wooden recounts walking off the court after his last game coaching in 1975, having just won his tenth title, only to have a UCLA fan walk up and say, &quot;Great win coach, this makes up for letting us down last year&quot; (UCLA had lost in the semi-finals double overtime in 1974)<a href="#fn108" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref108"><sup>108</sup></a>Bartow's successor, Wooden's protege, Gary Cunningham, posted an even better two year record after Bartow, .862 (50-8) and #2 rankings each year, but could not proceed past 2 wins in the NCAA's, and left citing &quot;physical reasons.&quot; Larry Brown came next, racking up more losses, 17, in two years than UCLA had experienced the previous 4, yet with a near magical end season run typical of his career, he managed to coach UCLA into the finals of the Final 4 in 1980. He left citing, among other complaints, he couldn't get his office painted.  After Brown, UCLA basketball commenced a seven year downward spiral with decidedly cheap, uninspired hirings of near unqualified novices Larry Farmer and former star player Walt Hazzard. UCLA went 20 years after Wooden's retirement before winning another national basketball championship, finally hanging a <a href="Pauley_Pavilion#UCLA_Championship_banners" title="wikilink">banner</a> again in 1995 under coach <a href="Jim_Harrick" title="wikilink">Jim Harrick</a>.

<li>Help others.</li>

<li>Make friendship a fine art.</li>
<li>Build a shelter against a rainy day.</li>
<li>Pray for guidance and give thanks for your blessings every day.</li>

<p>Wooden also has authored a lecture and a book about the Pyramid of Success.<a href="#fn115" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref115"><sup>115</sup></a> The Pyramid of Success consists of philosophical building blocks for winning at basketball and at life. In his later years he has been hired by corporations to deliver inspirational lectures and has even appeared in commercials for Hartford Insurance and the NCAA. It is generally known that he receives lecture fees now that exceed salaries he was paid as a coach. Wooden proudly claims these late in life windfalls have allowed him to set up education accounts for all of his grandchildren. In a 2009 interview, John Wooden described himself politically as a &quot;liberal democrat,&quot; who had voted for some republican presidential candidates.&quot;</p>
<p>Wooden is also the author of several other books about basketball and life.</p>
<p>Among Wooden&lt;U+2019&gt;s maxims:</p>

<li>Failing to prepare is preparing to fail.</li>
<li>Flexibility is the key to stability.</li>
