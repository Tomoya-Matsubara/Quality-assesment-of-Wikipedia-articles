He has gained prominence for his <a href="Right-libertarianism" title="wikilink">libertarian</a> positions on many political issues, often clashing with both Republican and Democratic Party leaders. Paul has run for <a href="President_of_the_United_States" title="wikilink">President of the United States</a> twice, first in 1988 as the nominee of the <a href="Libertarian_Party_(United_States)" title="wikilink">Libertarian Party</a> and again in 2008 as a candidate for the <a href="Republican_Party_(United_States)_presidential_candidates,_2008" title="wikilink">Republican nomination</a>.</p>

According to a 1998 study published in the <em><a href="American_Journal_of_Political_Science" title="wikilink">American Journal of Political Science</a></em>, Paul has the most conservative voting record of any member of Congress since 1937.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> His son <a href="Rand_Paul" title="wikilink">Rand Paul</a> was sworn in as a <a href="United_States_Senate" title="wikilink">Senator</a> for <a href="Kentucky" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kentucky</a> in 2011, making the elder Paul the first Representative in history to serve alongside a son or daughter in the Senate.</p>

<h2 id="early-congressional-career">Early congressional career</h2>
<p>While still a medical resident in the 1960s, Paul was influenced by <a href="Friedrich_Hayek" title="wikilink">Friedrich Hayek</a>&lt;U+2019&gt;s <em><a href="The_Road_to_Serfdom" title="wikilink">The Road to Serfdom</a></em>, which led him to read many works of <a href="Ayn_Rand" title="wikilink">Ayn Rand</a> and <a href="Ludwig_von_Mises" title="wikilink">Ludwig von Mises</a>. He came to know economists <a href="Hans_Sennholz" title="wikilink">Hans Sennholz</a> and <a href="Murray_Rothbard" title="wikilink">Murray Rothbard</a> well, and credits to them his interest in the study of economics. He came to believe that what the <a href="Austrian_school" title="wikilink">Austrian school</a> economists wrote was coming true on August 15, 1971, when President <a href="Richard_Nixon" title="wikilink">Richard Nixon</a> <a href="Nixon_Shock" title="wikilink">closed the &quot;gold window&quot;</a> by implementing the <a href="U.S._dollar" title="wikilink">U.S. dollar</a>'s complete departure from the <a href="gold_standard" title="wikilink">gold standard</a>.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> That same day, the young physician decided to enter politics, saying later, &quot;After that day, all money would be political money rather than money of real value. I was astounded.&quot;<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>

<p>Inspired by his belief that the monetary crisis of the 1970s was predicted by the <a href="Austrian_School" title="wikilink">Austrian School</a> and caused by excessive government spending on the <a href="Vietnam_War" title="wikilink">Vietnam War</a><a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> and <a href="welfare_state" title="wikilink">welfare</a>,<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> Paul became a delegate to the Texas Republican <a href="political_convention" title="wikilink">convention</a> and a Republican candidate for the <a href="United_States_Congress" title="wikilink">United States Congress</a>. In 1974, incumbent <a href="Robert_R._Casey" title="wikilink">Robert R. Casey</a> defeated him in the <a href="TX-22" title="wikilink">22nd district</a>. When President <a href="Gerald_Ford" title="wikilink">Gerald Ford</a> appointed Casey to head the <a href="Federal_Maritime_Commission" title="wikilink">Federal Maritime Commission</a>, Paul won an April 1976 <a href="special_election" title="wikilink">special election</a> to fill the empty seat.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> Paul lost some months later in the <a href="general_election" title="wikilink">general election</a>, to <a href="Democratic_Party_(United_States)" title="wikilink">Democrat</a> <a href="Robert_Gammage" title="wikilink">Robert Gammage</a>, by fewer than 300 votes (0.2%), but defeated Gammage in a 1978 rematch, and was reelected in 1980 and 1982.</p>
<p>Paul was the first Republican representative from the area; he also led the Texas Reagan delegation at the national Republican convention.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> His successful campaign against Gammage surprised local Democrats, who had expected to retain the seat easily in the wake of the <a href="Watergate_scandal" title="wikilink">Watergate scandal</a>. Gammage underestimated Paul's support among local mothers: &quot;I had real difficulty down in Brazoria County, where he practiced, because he'd delivered half the babies in the county. There were only two obstetricians in the county, and the other one was his partner.&quot;<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="house-of-representatives">House of Representatives</h3>
<p>Paul proposed <a href="term_limit" title="wikilink">term-limit</a> legislation multiple times, at first in the 1970s in the House<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> where he also declined to attend junkets or register for a Congressional pension while serving four terms.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> His chief of staff (1978&lt;U+2013&gt;1982) was <a href="Lew_Rockwell" title="wikilink">Lew Rockwell</a>.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> In 1980, when a majority of Republicans favored President <a href="Jimmy_Carter" title="wikilink">Jimmy Carter</a>'s proposal to reinstate draft registration, Paul argued that their views were inconsistent, stating they were more interested in registering their children than they were their guns.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> He also proposed legislation to decrease Congressional pay by the rate of inflation; he was a regular participant in the annual <a href="Congressional_Baseball_Game" title="wikilink">Congressional Baseball Game</a>;<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> and he continued to deliver babies on Mondays and Saturdays during his entire 22nd district career.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a></p>
<p>During his first term, Paul founded a <a href="think_tank" title="wikilink">think tank</a>, the <a href="Foundation_for_Rational_Economics_and_Education" title="wikilink">Foundation for Rational Economics and Education</a> (FREE).<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> Also in 1976, the foundation began publication of the first monthly newsletter connected with Paul, <em>Dr. Ron Paul's Freedom Report</em><a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> (or <em>Special Report</em>). It also publishes <a href="monographs" class="uri" title="wikilink">monographs</a>, books, radio spots, and (since 1997) a new series of the monthly newsletter, <em>Ron Paul's Freedom Report</em>, which promote the principles of limited government.</p>
<p>On the <a href="House_Banking_Committee" title="wikilink">House Banking Committee</a>, Paul blamed the Federal Reserve for inflation,<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> and spoke against the banking mismanagement that led to the <a href="savings_and_loan_crisis" title="wikilink">savings and loan crisis</a>.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> The U.S. Gold Commission created by Congress in 1982 was his and <a href="Jesse_Helms" title="wikilink">Jesse Helms</a>'s idea, and Paul's commission minority report was published by the <a href="Cato_Institute" title="wikilink">Cato Institute</a> in <em>The Case for Gold</em>;<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> it is now available from the <a href="Ludwig_von_Mises_Institute" title="wikilink">Ludwig von Mises Institute</a>, to which Paul is a distinguished counselor.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1984, Paul chose to run for the <a href="U.S._Senate" title="wikilink">U.S. Senate</a> instead of re-election to the House, but lost the Republican primary to <a href="Phil_Gramm" title="wikilink">Phil Gramm</a>.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> Another candidate in the senatorial primary was <a href="Henry_Grover" title="wikilink">Henry Grover</a>, a conservative former state legislator who had lost the 1972 gubernatorial general election to the Democrat <a href="Dolph_Briscoe" title="wikilink">Dolph Briscoe, Jr.</a> Paul then returned to full-time medical practice<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> and was succeeded by former state representative <a href="Tom_DeLay" title="wikilink">Tom DeLay</a>.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> In his House <a href="farewell_address" title="wikilink">farewell address</a>, Paul said, &quot;Special interests have replaced the concern that the <a href="Founding_Fathers_of_the_United_States" title="wikilink">Founders</a> had for general welfare. <a href="Vote_trading" title="wikilink">Vote trading</a> is seen as good politics. The errand-boy mentality is ordinary, the defender of liberty is seen as bizarre.

<p>In 2009, Paul was featured by <a href="CBS" class="uri" title="wikilink">CBS</a> on <em><a href="Up_to_the_Minute" title="wikilink">Up to the Minute</a></em> as one of two members of the U.S. Congress that have pledged not to receive pension from the <a href="United_States_government" title="wikilink">United States government</a>.

<h2 id="presidential-campaign">1988 presidential campaign</h2>

<p>According to Paul, his presidential run was about more than reaching office; he sought to spread his libertarian ideas, often to school and university groups regardless of vote eligibility. He said, &quot;We're just as interested in the future generation as this election. These kids will vote eventually, and maybe, just maybe, they'll go home and talk to their parents.&quot;<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> He traveled the country for a year speaking about issues such as <a href="free_market" title="wikilink">free market</a> economics and the rising government deficits:<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> &quot;That's why we talk to a lot of young people.

<p>After the election, Paul continued his medical practice until he returned to Congress.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a><a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> He also co-owned a coin dealership, Ron Paul Coins, for twelve years with <a href="Burt_Blumert" title="wikilink">Burt Blumert</a>, who continued to operate it after Paul returned to office.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a><a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a> He spoke multiple times at the <a href="American_Numismatic_Association" title="wikilink">American Numismatic Association</a>'s 1988 convention.<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a> He worked with FREE on such projects as establishing the <a href="National_Endowment_for_Liberty" title="wikilink">National Endowment for Liberty</a>, producing the <em>At Issue</em> public policy series that aired on <a href="Discovery_Channel" title="wikilink">Discovery Channel</a> and <a href="CNBC" class="uri" title="wikilink">CNBC</a>,<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a> and continuing publication of <em>Dr. Ron Paul's Freedom Report</em>.</p>

<p>Ron Paul &amp; Associates (RP&amp;A), Inc. was founded in 1984 by Paul, who served as President.

<p>After his unsuccessful presidential bid in 1988, Paul returned to private medical practice and continued to allow the newsletters to be published bearing his name.

<h3 id="campaigns">Campaigns</h3>

<h4 id="campaign">1996 campaign</h4>
<p>In 1996, Paul was re-elected to Congress after the toughest campaign race he had faced since the 1970s. As Republicans had taken over both houses of Congress in the <a href="United_States_House_elections,_1994" title="wikilink">1994 election</a>, Paul entered the race hopeful that his <a href="Constitutionalist" class="uri" title="wikilink">Constitutionalist</a> policies of tax cuts, closing federal agencies, and curbing the U.N. would have broader support than in the past.<a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a> The <a href="Republican_National_Committee" title="wikilink">Republican National Committee</a> focused instead on encouraging Democrats to switch parties, as Paul's primary opponent, incumbent <a href="Greg_Laughlin" title="wikilink">Greg Laughlin</a>, had done in 1995. The party threw its full weight behind Laughlin, including support from House Speaker <a href="Newt_Gingrich" title="wikilink">Newt Gingrich</a>, Texas Governor <a href="George_W._Bush" title="wikilink">George W. Bush</a>, and the <a href="National_Rifle_Association" title="wikilink">National Rifle Association</a>. Paul responded by running newspaper ads quoting Gingrich's harsh criticisms of Laughlin's Democratic voting record 14 months earlier.<a href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a> Paul won the primary with support from baseball pitcher, constituent, and friend <a href="Nolan_Ryan" title="wikilink">Nolan Ryan</a> (as honorary campaign chair and ad spokesman), as well as tax activist <a href="Steve_Forbes" title="wikilink">Steve Forbes</a><a href="#fn67" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a> and conservative commentator <a href="Pat_Buchanan" title="wikilink">Pat Buchanan</a> (both of whom had run presidential campaigns that year).</p>
<p>Paul's Democratic opponent in the fall general election, <a href="trial_lawyer" title="wikilink">trial lawyer</a> <a href="Charles_&quot;Lefty&quot;_Morris" title="wikilink">Charles &quot;Lefty&quot; Morris</a>, received assistance from the <a href="AFL-CIO" class="uri" title="wikilink">AFL-CIO</a>, but Paul's wider contributor base out-raised Morris two-to-one, giving the third-highest amount of individual contributions received by any House member (behind Gingrich and <a href="Bob_Dornan" title="wikilink">Bob Dornan</a>).<a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a> While Paul was able to paint Morris as a tool of <a href="trial_lawyer" title="wikilink">trial lawyers</a> and <a href="big_labor" title="wikilink">big labor</a>, Morris ran numerous ads about Paul's advocacy of federal drug law repeal.</p>
<p>Morris also accused Paul of authoring questionable statements in past newsletters,<a href="#fn69" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref69"><sup>69</sup></a> some of which were characterized as racially charged.<a href="#fn70" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a><a href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a> Paul's congressional campaign countered the statements were taken out of context.<a href="#fn72" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref72"><sup>72</sup></a> and that voters might not understand the &quot;tongue-in-cheek, academic&quot; quotes out of context. Further, the campaign rejected Morris' demand to release all back issues.</p>
<p>Paul went on to win the election in a close margin. It became the third time Paul had been elected to Congress as a non-incumbent.<a href="#fn73" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref73"><sup>73</sup></a> Upon his returning to Washington, Paul quickly discovered &quot;there was no sincere effort&quot; by Republicans toward their declared goal of <a href="small_government" title="wikilink">small government</a>.<a href="#fn74" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref74"><sup>74</sup></a></p>

Sneary's aides said he had voted to raise all county employees' pay by five percent in a <a href="cost-of-living_increase" title="wikilink">cost-of-living increase</a>. Paul countered that he had never voted to raise Congressional pay.<a href="#fn77" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref77"><sup>77</sup></a><a href="#fn78" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref78"><sup>78</sup></a> In both campaigns, the national Democratic Party and major unions continued to spend heavily on targeting Paul.<a href="#fn79" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref79"><sup>79</sup></a></p>
<p>An online <a href="grassroots" class="uri" title="wikilink">grassroots</a> petition to <a href="Political_draft" title="wikilink">draft</a> Paul for the <a href="United_States_presidential_election,_2004" title="wikilink">2004 presidential election</a> garnered several thousand signatures.<a href="#fn80" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref80"><sup>80</sup></a> On December 11, 2001, he told the independent movement that he was encouraged by the fact that the petition had spread the message of Constitutionalism, but did not expect a White House win at that time.<a href="#fn81" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref81"><sup>81</sup></a> Further prompting in early 2007 led him to enter the <a href="United_States_presidential_election,_2008" title="wikilink">2008 race</a>.</p>
<p>Unlike many political candidates, Paul receives the overwhelming majority of his campaign contributions from individuals<a href="#fn82" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref82"><sup>82</sup></a> (97 percent in the 2006 cycle), and receives much less from <a href="political_action_committee" title="wikilink">political action committees</a> (PAC's) than others, ranging from two percent (2002) to six percent (1998).<a href="#fn83" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref83"><sup>83</sup></a> The group Clean Up Washington, analyzing from 2000 to mid-2006, listed Paul as seventh-lowest in PAC receipts of all House members; one of the lowest in lobbyist receipts; and fourth-highest in small-donor receipts.<a href="#fn84" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref84"><sup>84</sup></a> He had the lowest PAC receipts percentage of all the <a href="2008_Republican_presidential_candidates" title="wikilink">2008 Republican presidential candidates</a>.<a href="#fn85" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref85"><sup>85</sup></a><a href="#fn86" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref86"><sup>86</sup></a></p>

Even so, Paul opposes programs like <a href="National_Flood_Insurance_Program" title="wikilink">federally funded flood insurance</a> (typically supported by coastal and rural representatives) because it requires those outside flood zones to subsidize those within, but prohibits those within from choosing their own insurers.

<p>Paul adds his own <a href="earmark_(politics)" title="wikilink">earmarks</a>, such as for Texas shrimp promotion, but he routinely votes against most spending bills returned by committee.<a href="#fn98" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref98"><sup>98</sup></a><a href="#fn99" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref99"><sup>99</sup></a> Earmarks permit members of Congress, rather than <a href="executive_branch" title="wikilink">executive branch</a> <a href="civil_servants" title="wikilink">civil servants</a>, to designate spending priorities<a href="#fn100" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref100"><sup>100</sup></a> for previously authorized funds directed otherwise.<a href="#fn101" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref101"><sup>101</sup></a> Paul compared his practice to objecting to the tax system yet taking all one's <a href="tax_credit" title="wikilink">tax credits</a>: &quot;I want to get their money back for the people.&quot;<a href="#fn102" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref102"><sup>102</sup></a> In <em><a href="The_Revolution:_A_Manifesto" title="wikilink">The Revolution: A Manifesto</a></em>, Paul states his views on earmarks this way: &quot;The real problem, and one that was unfortunately not addressed in the 2007's earmark dispute, is the size of the federal government and the amount of money we are spending in these appropriations bills. Cutting even a million dollars from an appropriations bill that spends hundreds of billions will make no appreciable difference in the size of government, which is doubtless why politicians and the media are so eager to have us waste our time on [earmarks].&quot;<a href="#fn103" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref103"><sup>103</sup></a></p>
<p>Paul also spends extra time in the district to compensate for &quot;violat[ing] almost every rule of political survival you can think of,&quot;<a href="#fn104" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref104"><sup>104</sup></a> traveling over  daily<a href="#fn105" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref105"><sup>105</sup></a> to attend civic ceremonies for veterans, graduates, and <a href="Boy_Scouts_of_America" title="wikilink">Boy Scouts</a>, often accompanied by his grandchildren. His staff helps senior citizens obtain free or low-cost prescription drugs through a little-known drug company program; procures lost or unreceived medals for war veterans, holding dozens of medal ceremonies annually; is known for its effectiveness in tracking down <a href="Social_Security_(United_States)" title="wikilink">Social Security</a> checks; and sends out birthday and condolence cards.<a href="#fn106" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref106"><sup>106</sup></a><a href="#fn107" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref107"><sup>107</sup></a></p>

Paul's speech, 35 &quot;Questions That Won't Be Asked About Iraq&quot;,<a href="#fn115" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref115"><sup>115</sup></a> was translated and published in <a href="German_language" title="wikilink">German</a>, <a href="French_language" title="wikilink">French</a>, <a href="Russian_language" title="wikilink">Russian</a>, <a href="Italian_language" title="wikilink">Italian</a>, and <a href="Swiss_language" title="wikilink">Swiss</a> periodicals before the <a href="Iraq_War" title="wikilink">Iraq War</a> began.<a href="#fn116" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref116"><sup>116</sup></a></p>

<p>Paul was on a <a href="bipartisan" class="uri" title="wikilink">bipartisan</a> coalition of 17 members of Congress that sued President <a href="Bill_Clinton" title="wikilink">Bill Clinton</a> in 1999 over his conduct of the <a href="Kosovo_war" title="wikilink">Kosovo war</a>. They accused Clinton of failing to inform Congress of the action's status within 48 hours as required by the <a href="War_Powers_Resolution" title="wikilink">War Powers Resolution</a>, and of failing to obtain Congressional declaration of war. Congress had voted 427&lt;U+2013&gt;2 against a declaration of war with <a href="Yugoslavia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Yugoslavia</a>, and had voted to deny support for the air campaign in Kosovo. A federal judge dismissed the lawsuit, ruling that since Congress had voted for funding after Clinton had actively engaged troops in the war with Kosovo, legislators had sent a confusing message about whether they approved of the war. Paul said that the judge's decision attempted to circumvent the Constitution and to authorize the president to conduct a war without approval from Congress.<a href="#fn127" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref127"><sup>127</sup></a></p>

<p>At the end of 2007, both the <em><a href="New_York_Sun" title="wikilink">New York Sun</a></em> and the <em><a href="New_York_Times_Magazine" title="wikilink">New York Times Magazine</a></em> reprinted passages from early 1990s publications of Paul's newsletters, attacking them for content deemed racist.<a href="#fn164" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref164"><sup>164</sup></a> These were the same newsletters that had been used against Paul in his 1996 congressional campaign.</p>

<p>Shortly afterwards, <em><a href="The_New_Republic" title="wikilink">The New Republic</a></em> released many previously unpublicized quotations attributed to Paul in James Kirchick's &quot;Angry White Man&quot; article.<a href="#fn167" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref167"><sup>167</sup></a> Kirchick accused Paul of having made racist, sexist, and derogatory comments geared towards African Americans, women, and the <a href="LGBT" class="uri" title="wikilink">LGBT</a> community.<a href="#fn168" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref168"><sup>168</sup></a> Kircheck also accused Paul of possessing &quot;an obsession with <a href="conspiracy_theory" title="wikilink">conspiracies</a>, sympathy for the right-wing <a href="militia" class="uri" title="wikilink">militia</a> movement, and deeply held bigotry.&quot;<a href="#fn169" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref169"><sup>169</sup></a> Paul's presidential campaign<a href="#fn170" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref170"><sup>170</sup></a> took the position that the Kirchick story was simply a &quot;rehash&quot; of a political attack received during his <a href="Ron_Paul#1996_campaign" title="wikilink">1996 campaign</a>.</p>
<p>Responding to the charges in a CNN interview, Paul denied any involvement in authoring the passages. Additionally, Paul's campaign claimed through a press release that the quotations had come from an unnamed ghostwriter and without Paul's consent. Paul again denounced and disavowed the &quot;small-minded thoughts,&quot; citing his 1999 House speech praising <a href="Rosa_Parks" title="wikilink">Rosa Parks</a> for her courage; he said the charges simply &quot;rehashed&quot; the decade-old Morris attack.<a href="#fn171" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref171"><sup>171</sup></a> CNN anchor <a href="Wolf_Blitzer" title="wikilink">Wolf Blitzer</a> that the writing &quot;Didn't sound like the Ron Paul I've come to know.&quot;<a href="#fn172" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref172"><sup>172</sup></a> Later, Nelson Linder, president of the <a href="Austin,_Texas" title="wikilink">Austin</a> chapter of the <a href="NAACP" class="uri" title="wikilink">NAACP</a>, also defended Paul.<a href="#fn173" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref173"><sup>173</sup></a></p>

Paul also believes the longterm erosion of the U.S. dollar's purchasing power through <a href="inflation" class="uri" title="wikilink">inflation</a> is attributable to its lack of any commodity backing.
