<p><strong>John Elmer &quot;Jack&quot; Stivetts</strong> (March 31, 1868 &lt;U+2013&gt; April 18, 1930), was a professional baseball <a href="pitcher" class="uri" title="wikilink">pitcher</a> who played 11 seasons in <a href="Major_League_Baseball" title="wikilink">Major League Baseball</a> (MLB) spanning from 1889 to 1899. He played in the <a href="American_Association_(19th_century)" title="wikilink">American Association</a> (AA) with the <a href="St._Louis_Cardinals" title="wikilink">St. Louis Browns</a>, and in the <a href="National_League" title="wikilink">National League</a> (NL) with the <a href="Atlanta_Braves" title="wikilink">Boston Beaneaters</a> and <a href="Cleveland_Spiders" title="wikilink">Cleveland Spiders</a>. &quot;Happy Jack&quot; (nicknamed due to his pleasant demeanor} was born to German immigrants and raised in <a href="Ashland,_Pennsylvania" title="wikilink">Ashland, Pennsylvania</a>.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a><a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> He initially followed his father into the coal mining industry before playing professional baseball. After playing two and half seasons in <a href="minor_league_baseball" title="wikilink">minor league baseball</a> (MiLB), he was signed to the Browns. Over the next few seasons, he was regarded as one of the best pitchers in baseball.</p>
<p>In his first season, he led the AA in <a href="earned_run_average" title="wikilink">earned run average</a> (ERA), and in <a href="strikeout" title="wikilink">strikeouts</a> two seasons later. In the years spanning from 1890 through 1896, he posted 20 or more victories in a season six times; two of which he won more than 30. In 1892, he won a career-high 35 games, and on August 6, he threw a <a href="no-hitter" class="uri" title="wikilink">no-hitter</a>. During his seven seasons with the Beaneaters, he was part of four league championships, and pitched along-side future <a href="National_Baseball_Hall_of_Fame_and_Museum" title="wikilink">Hall of Fame</a> members <a href="John_Clarkson" title="wikilink">John Clarkson</a> and <a href="Kid_Nichols" title="wikilink">Kid Nichols</a>. He was among the best hitting pitchers of his era, and was often used at other positions when he was not pitching. He became the first pticher to hit two home runs in one game, and his season total of seven in 1890 stood as the record for pitchers until 1931. He compiled a .298 lifetime <a href="batting_average" title="wikilink">batting average</a>, hit 35 <a href="home_run" title="wikilink">home runs</a>, and delivered 357 <a href="run_batted_in" title="wikilink">runs batted in</a> (RBIs).</p>
<p>His last season in the major leagues, he played for the Spiders, widely considered to be one of the worst teams in MLB history. After his baseball career, he returned to his hometown of Ashland. He worked for the area coal mines as a brewery wagon driver and carpenter, and died there at 62 years of age.</p>

Ultimately, the deal did not transpire, and each pitcher reported to their respective teams.<a href="#fn88" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref88"><sup>88</sup></a> One rule change implemented for the 1893 season changed the distance between the <a href="pitching_mound" title="wikilink">pitching mound</a> and <a href="home_plate" title="wikilink">home plate</a> from 50 feet to 60 feet 6 inches.<a href="#fn89" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref89"><sup>89</sup></a> The change intended to even the competetive balance between the pitchers and hitters. In addition to the distance, pitchers were to pitch from a rubber slab, and not allowed to take a running start before they delivered the ball to the batter.<a href="#fn90" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref90"><sup>90</sup></a></p>
<p>Stivetts struggled with the new distance initially; his first four starts of the season were largely ineffective.<a href="#fn91" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref91"><sup>91</sup></a> On April 29, with the weather cold and rainy, he issued bases on balls to ten <a href="San_Francisco_Giants" title="wikilink">New York Giants</a> batters, and surrendered 15 <a href="run_(baseball)" title="wikilink">runs</a>.<a href="#fn92" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref92"><sup>92</sup></a> The next two starts were against Baltimore and he allowed seven runs to score the first game depite gaining the victory, and another 16 runs in a loss in the second game.<a href="#fn93" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref93"><sup>93</sup></a> Another ten runs scored on May 10, in a loss versus the <a href="Washington_Senators_(1891&lt;U+2013&gt;1899)" title="wikilink">Washington Senators</a>.<a href="#fn94" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref94"><sup>94</sup></a></p>
<p>His troubles adjusting to the new rules, and his athletic conditioning during June and July, prompted the team to sign <a href="Hank_Gastright" title="wikilink">Hank Gastright</a> for added pitching strength.<a href="#fn95" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref95"><sup>95</sup></a> He struck out just 61 batter in 283 2/3 for a 1.6 K/9, and his ERA increased from 3.03 in 1892 to 4.41. Despite this, he helped Boston claim their third consecutive NL championship with a 20&lt;U+2013&gt;12 W&lt;U+2013&gt;L record.<a href="#fn96" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref96"><sup>96</sup></a><a href="#fn97" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref97"><sup>97</sup></a></p>
<h4 id="season-5">1894 season</h4>
<p>With the previous season's inconsistencies behind him, he was re-signed and was the team's starting pitcher for Boston season-opening game on April 19; a 13&lt;U+2013&gt;2 victory versus Bridegrooms of Brooklyn.<a href="#fn98" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref98"><sup>98</sup></a><a href="#fn99" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref99"><sup>99</sup></a> He then lost his next eight starts, however, before beginning a ten-game winning streak that lasted into mid-July.<a href="#fn100" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref100"><sup>100</sup></a> On August 21, he started and gained complete game victories in both ends of a doubleheader versus the <a href="Cincinnati_Reds" title="wikilink">Cincinnati Reds</a>.<a href="#fn101" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref101"><sup>101</sup></a> Two days later, on August 23, he pitched Boston to 12&lt;U+2013&gt;10 victory against the Spiders. That same day in Ashland, his father was killed in a coal mining accident when a load of coal fell on top on him.<a href="#fn102" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref102"><sup>102</sup></a><a href="#fn103" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref103"><sup>103</sup></a></p>
<p>Boston finished in third place among the 12 NL teams in 1894, and Stivetts' won 26 games, though most of his numbers in important statistical categories failed to improve or became worse.<a href="#fn104" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref104"><sup>104</sup></a> His ERA rose to 4.90, and his K/9 moved up slightly to 2.0 when he struck out 76 in 338 innings pitched.<a href="#fn105" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref105"><sup>105</sup></a> He issued 127 bases on balls, and surrendered a league-leading 27 home runs.<a href="#fn106" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref106"><sup>106</sup></a> It was his hitting skills that was his biggest success in 1894. Beginning on July 5, Boston played a three-game series against Cleveland. While alternating game to game from pitching and playing in right field, Stivetts hit one home run in each game, the last one coming in the sixth inning off of Cy Young, completing the <a href="sweep#sports" title="wikilink">sweep</a>.<a href="#fn107" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref107"><sup>107</sup></a> He hit a career-high season total of eight home runs for the season. He also achieved career-highs with 64 RBIs, seven <a href="triple_(baseball)" title="wikilink">triples</a>, and 55 runs scored, while batting .328 in 68 games played.<a href="#fn108" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref108"><sup>108</sup></a></p>
<h4 id="season-6">1895 season</h4>
<p>In early November, due to the threat that a new American Association was near formation, the National League clubs were quick to sign their players without much negotiating. Many of the players' salary demands were met, including Stivetts'.<a href="#fn109" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref109"><sup>109</sup></a> In March, shortly before the 1895 season began, Stivetts claimed he was in &quot;excellent phycial condition&quot;, and that he was &quot;many pounds lighter than he was at this period last year.&quot;<a href="#fn110" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref110"><sup>110</sup></a> The season opener was on April 19 against Brooklyn, and Stivetts got the start over Nichols for the second consecutive season.<a href="#fn111" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref111"><sup>111</sup></a> Despite being down early in the game, Boston won the game 11&lt;U+2013&gt;6 behind a seven-run seventh inning. Stivetts scored thrice and gathered two hits in the game, including a <a href="double_(baseball)" title="wikilink">double</a>.<a href="#fn112" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref112"><sup>112</sup></a></p>
<p>During the 1893 season, Stivetts (a protestant) involved himself in a dispute between two catholic players, <a href="Tommy_Tucker_(baseball)" title="wikilink">Tommy Tucker</a> and <a href="Hugh_Duffy" title="wikilink">Hugh Duffy</a>, and their manager <a href="Frank_Selee" title="wikilink">Frank Selee</a>. The resulting rift caused strife, on occasion, among team members. Factions formed, with Duffy, Tucker, and McCarthy on one side and <a href="Herman_Long_(baseball)" title="wikilink">Herman Long</a>, <a href="Bobby_Lowe" title="wikilink">Bobby Lowe</a> taking the side of Stivetts. These disagreements, in part, led to an incident a <a href="Louisville,_Kentucky" title="wikilink">Louisville, Kentucky</a> hotel dining room between Stivetts and McCarthy. In repsonse to something Stivetts had said, McCarthy retaliated by punching him once in the face and then calmly left the restaurant.<a href="#fn113" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref113"><sup>113</sup></a><a href="#fn114" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref114"><sup>114</sup></a></p>
<p>His W&lt;U+2013&gt;L record slid to 17&lt;U+2013&gt;17, while his ERA improved to 4.64 in 291 inning pitched, as Boston fell to fifth place, 16.5 games behind the NL champions from Baltimore.<a href="#fn115" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref115"><sup>115</sup></a> His hitting suffered as well; his batting average dropped to a career-low .190, and he failed to hit a home run for the first time since his rookie season.<a href="#fn116" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref116"><sup>116</sup></a> Shortly after Boston has completed its schedule, Stivett re-signed for the 1896 season.<a href="#fn117" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref117"><sup>117</sup></a></p>
<h4 id="season-7">1896 season</h4>
<p>During the off-season, trade talks were conducted, but not completed, between the Beaneaters and the <a href="Philadelphia_Phillies" title="wikilink">Philadelphia Quakers</a>. The deal reportedly involved Stivetts and Tucker, two players involved in Boston's religious quarrel from the previous season.<a href="#fn118" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref118"><sup>118</sup></a> As the season progress, the press noted that his season had begun better than the previous season.<a href="#fn119" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref119"><sup>119</sup></a> Stivetts claimed that it was his weight loss (now just over 200 lbs), that was the main reason why he had been more of an asset to the team than in past years.<a href="#fn120" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref120"><sup>120</sup></a></p>
<p>Though he lost his first start of season, the rebounded to win six starts in seuccession from April 25 though May 20, including a 7&lt;U+2013&gt;0 shutout victory on May 8 versus Louisville.<a href="#fn121" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref121"><sup>121</sup></a> On June 12, he pitched Boston to a 15-3 victory over the Reds at home, and connected for two home runs against <a href="Chauncey_Fisher" title="wikilink">Chauncey Fisher</a>.<a href="#fn122" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref122"><sup>122</sup></a><a href="#fn123" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref123"><sup>123</sup></a> This was the third, and last, time he hit two home runs in a single game.<a href="#fn124" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref124"><sup>124</sup></a> Hit three home runs total for the season, as well as improving his batting average to .347 in 222 at bats. He increased his win total to 22, and his 4.10 ERA was the lowest since 1892.<a href="#fn125" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref125"><sup>125</sup></a></p>
<p>On October 3, it was reported that he was reserved by Boston under the <a href="reserve_clause" title="wikilink">reserve clause</a>.<a href="#fn126" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref126"><sup>126</sup></a> When interviewed during the off-season, Stivetts claimed that he would like to quit pitching and play <a href="first_baseman" title="wikilink">first</a> if a team would give him the opportunity. Selee, Boston's manager, disagreed and claimed that the team needed Stivetts' in the pitching rotation instead.<a href="#fn127" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref127"><sup>127</sup></a> It was also likely that he would have received less salary playing at first.<a href="#fn128" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref128"><sup>128</sup></a></p>
<h4 id="season-8">1897 season</h4>
<p>Boston re-signed Stivetts for $2100 depite the view of some in the press who believed Boston would continue to sink in the standings if they didn't rid themselves of him and the team's manager.<a href="#fn129" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref129"><sup>129</sup></a><a href="#fn130" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref130"><sup>130</sup></a> Shortly after Stivetts' first start of the season, a 10&lt;U+2013&gt;5 loss on April 23 in Baltimore, Selee was quoted as saying that Stivetts will not be pitching much into the future, saying that &quot;he is growing rather stiff, and will not let himself out as he did when he was at his best, some years ago.&quot;<a href="#fn131" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref131"><sup>131</sup></a><a href="#fn132" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref132"><sup>132</sup></a> His weight was now at 217 lbs, so as the team departed on May 10 for a western road trip, Selee sent him back to Ashland to get back into proper game condition.<a href="#fn133" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref133"><sup>133</sup></a> Although he was told not to report back to the team until his weight was below 200 lbs, he had re-joined the team and played <a href="right_fielder" title="wikilink">right field</a> in the second game of a doubleheader on May 15.<a href="#fn134" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref134"><sup>134</sup></a><a href="#fn135" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref135"><sup>135</sup></a> His place in the rotation fell behind Nichols, <a href="Fred_Klobedanz" title="wikilink">Fred Klobedanz</a>, and <a href="Edward_M._Lewis" title="wikilink">Ted Lewis</a>.<a href="#fn136" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref136"><sup>136</sup></a> He made a relief appearance on May 18, before having to take some time off for a sore arm.<a href="#fn137" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref137"><sup>137</sup></a><a href="#fn138" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref138"><sup>138</sup></a> His next start occured on May 31, when Boston defeated St. Louis by a 25&lt;U+2013&gt;5 score.<a href="#fn139" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref139"><sup>139</sup></a> He earned his second consecutive victory on June 11, in his third start, this time a 12&lt;U+2013&gt;4 win versus Louisville.<a href="#fn140" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref140"><sup>140</sup></a></p>
<p>While he only pitched 129 1/3 innings in 18 games during the season, he fared well, and helped Boston re-claim the NL championship. He had an 11&lt;U+2013&gt;4 W&lt;U+2013&gt;L record, and his ERA dropped to 3.41. As a hitter, he continued to flourish, with .367 batting average, hit a career-high nine triples, and added two more home runs. At the conclusion of the regular season, Boston faced faced the second place Orioles in a post-season series; the <a href="Temple_Cup" title="wikilink">Temple Cup</a>. This was the last year the cup series was to take place, and was Boston's first appearance.</p>
<h4 id="season-9">1898 season</h4>
<p>Stivetts was again reserved by Boston, and later re-signed for $2000. It was now expected that he play as an extra outfielder, due to the Beaneaters' solid, four-man starting pitching rotation of Nichols, Klobedanz, Lewis, and rookie <a href="Vic_Willis" title="wikilink">Vic Willis</a>.<a href="#fn141" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref141"><sup>141</sup></a><a href="#fn142" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref142"><sup>142</sup></a><a href="#fn143" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref143"><sup>143</sup></a> Stivetts claimed that he had never felt better in life and outlook about the coming season was positive.<a href="#fn144" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref144"><sup>144</sup></a></p>
