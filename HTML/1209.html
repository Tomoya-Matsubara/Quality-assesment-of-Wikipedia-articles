It is owned by <a href="Cognita" class="uri" title="wikilink">Cognita</a>, an independent schools company chaired by <a href="Chris_Woodhead" title="wikilink">Chris Woodhead</a>. The school prides itself on a &quot;very special family atmosphere&quot;<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>School's homepage introduction.</ref>, although the takeover by Cognita has been considered controversial in this aspect.</p>
<p>The school accommodates pupils aged 3-18 albeit not on the same site - stretching efforts across three separate schools; a junior, lower and senior. There are approximately 900 pupils across the sites.</p>
<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<p>Akeley Wood School was originally named Hillcrest School, and located in <a href="Frinton-on-Sea" class="uri" title="wikilink">Frinton-on-Sea</a>. Hillcrest School moved, avoiding the <a href="World_War_II" title="wikilink">war</a>, to <a href="Wales" class="uri" title="wikilink">Wales</a>; and, in <a href="1946" class="uri" title="wikilink">1946</a>, to Akeley Wood, where it was renamed. In 1972 the school changed from a boy's <a href="Boarding_School" title="wikilink">boarding</a> to a co-educational day school.</p>
<p>A junior division of the school was introduced, and in 1976 provision was also made for those pupils who wanted to remain at the school to take their Ordinary Levels (subsequently <a href="GCSEs" class="uri" title="wikilink">GCSEs</a>). The school expanded in 1987 to accommodate a sixth form.</p>
<p>The school grew rapidly, requiring a new site, and in <a href="1988" class="uri" title="wikilink">1988</a> Wicken Park was purchased to run a junior school. In <a href="1998" class="uri" title="wikilink">1998</a> Charmandean was purchased and the lower school was taken off site.</p>
