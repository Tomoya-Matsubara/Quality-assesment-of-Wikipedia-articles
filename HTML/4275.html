<p>Never Say Never}}  <strong><em>Never Say Never Again</em></strong>, released in 1983 by <a href="Warner_Bros." title="wikilink">Warner Bros.</a>, is an adaptation of the <a href="James_Bond" title="wikilink">James Bond</a> novel <a href="Thunderball_(novel)" title="wikilink"><em>Thunderball</em></a>, which was previously filmed in 1965 as the <a href="spy_film" title="wikilink">spy film</a> <a href="Thunderball_(film)" title="wikilink"><em>Thunderball</em></a>. The film, like the original, stars <a href="Sean_Connery" title="wikilink">Sean Connery</a> as British Secret Service agent James Bond 007. Connery had been the first actor to portray Bond in a motion picture, in 1962's <em><a href="Dr._No_(film)" title="wikilink">Dr. No</a></em>, but he left the franchise in 1971 after his participation in the string of commercially successful films, interrupted by <a href="George_Lazenby" title="wikilink">George Lazenby's</a> brief portrayal of Bond in <a href="On_Her_Majesty&#39;s_Secret_Service_(film)" title="wikilink"><em>On Her Majesty's Secret Service</em></a>.</p>
<p>Unlike <a href="James_Bond_(film_series)" title="wikilink">the majority of Bond films</a>, <em>Never Say Never Again</em> was not produced by <a href="Eon_Productions" title="wikilink">Eon Productions</a>, but by an independent production company, one of whose members was <a href="Kevin_McClory" title="wikilink">Kevin McClory</a>, one of the original writers of the <em>Thunderball</em> storyline with <a href="Ian_Fleming" title="wikilink">Ian Fleming</a> and <a href="Jack_Whittingham" title="wikilink">Jack Whittingham</a>. Following a <a href="Thunderball_(novel)#Controversy" title="wikilink">long legal battle</a> dating from the 1960s, McClory had been a producer on the original film and had retained rights which allowed him to re-make the story separately from Eon.</p>
<p>The title is based on a conversation between Sean Connery and his second wife, Micheline Roquebrune. After initially retiring from the role following <em><a href="Diamonds_Are_Forever_(film)" title="wikilink">Diamonds Are Forever</a></em> (1971) he told the press he would &quot;never&quot; play James Bond; her response was that he should never say <em>&quot;never again&quot;</em>: she is credited at the end of the film for her contribution. As a result, it was the first Bond film to use a non-Ian Fleming originated title. The film opened in the autumn of 1983 to positive critic reviews and was a commercial success, grossing $160 million at the box office, although this was less overall than the official Bond released in June of the same year, <em><a href="Octopussy" class="uri" title="wikilink">Octopussy</a></em>.</p>
<h2 id="plot">Plot</h2>
<p>After <a href="MI6" class="uri" title="wikilink">MI6</a> agent James Bond, 007 fails a routine training exercise, his superior, <a href="M_(James_Bond)" title="wikilink">M</a>, orders Bond to enrol in a health clinic in London to get back into shape. While there, Bond witnesses a mysterious nurse named <a href="Fatima_Blush" title="wikilink">Fatima Blush</a> giving a <a href="Sadomasochism" title="wikilink"> sadomasochistic</a> beating of her patient in a nearby room. The man's face is bandaged and after Fatima finishes her beating, Bond sees the patient using a machine which <a href="Retinal_scan" title="wikilink">scans his eye</a>. Bond is seen by Blush and an attempt is subsequently made to kill him in the clinic gym: however Bond manages to defeat the assassin by using a sample of his own <a href="urine" class="uri" title="wikilink">urine</a>.</p>
<p>Blush and her charge, a United States Air Force pilot named Jack Petachi, are operatives of <a href="SPECTRE" class="uri" title="wikilink">SPECTRE</a>, a criminal organisation run by <a href="Ernst_Stavro_Blofeld" title="wikilink">Ernst Stavro Blofeld</a>. Petachi has undergone an operation on his right eye to make it match the <a href="retinal" class="uri" title="wikilink">retinal</a> pattern of the US President, which he uses to circumvent security at an <a href="USAFE#Operating_bases" title="wikilink">American military base in</a> England. Whilst doing so, he replaces the dummy <a href="Nuclear_warhead" title="wikilink">warheads</a> in two <a href="cruise_missile" title="wikilink">cruise missiles</a> with live <a href="W80_(nuclear_warhead)" title="wikilink">nuclear warheads</a>; SPECTRE then obtains the warheads to extort billions of dollars from <a href="NATO" class="uri" title="wikilink">NATO</a> governments. Blush subsequently murders Petachi.</p>
<p>Under orders from the <a href="Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Kingdom" title="wikilink">Prime Minister</a>, M reluctantly reactivates the double-0 section and Bond is assigned the task of tracking down the missing weapons. Before leaving, he is outfitted with several gadgets by <a href="Q_(James_Bond)" title="wikilink">Q Branch</a>, including a fountain pen that shoots an explosive dart. He meets <a href="Domino_Petachi" title="wikilink">Domino Petachi</a>, the pilot's sister, and her wealthy lover, <a href="Maximillian_Largo" title="wikilink">Maximillian Largo</a>, another SPECTRE agent. Bond follows Largo and his yacht to the <a href="Bahamas" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bahamas</a>, where he spars with Fatima Blush and Largo.</p>
<p>Bond is informed by Nigel Small-Fawcett of the British Consulate that Largo's yacht is now heading for <a href="Nice,_France" title="wikilink">Nice</a>, France. There, Bond joins forces with his <a href="Central_Intelligence_Agency" title="wikilink">CIA</a> counterpart, <a href="Felix_Leiter" title="wikilink">Felix Leiter</a>. Bond goes to a beauty salon where he poses as an employee and, whilst giving Domino a massage, is informed by her that Largo is hosting an event at a casino that evening. At the charity event, Largo and Bond play a 3-D video game called <em>Domination</em>, which Bond ultimately wins; Bond then informs Domino of her brother's death. Bond returns to his villa to find Nicole, his French contact, dead, having been killed by Blush. After a vehicle chase on his motorbike, Blush captures Bond. Forced to write his memoirs putting her as his &quot;Number One&quot; sexual partner, Bond uses his MI6-issue fountain pen to shoot Blush.</p>
<p>Bond and Felix then attempt to board Largo's motor yacht, the <a href="Disco_Volante_(ship)" title="wikilink"><em>Flying Saucer</em></a>, in search of the missing nuclear warheads. Bond becomes trapped and is taken, with Domino, to Palmyra, Largo's base of operations in <a href="North_Africa" title="wikilink">North Africa</a>. Largo punishes Domino for betraying him by auctioning her off to some passing <a href="Arab" title="wikilink">Arabs</a>. Bond subsequently escapes and rescues Domino.</p>
<p>After her rescue, Domino and Bond reunite with Felix on a <a href="United_States_Navy" title="wikilink">US Navy</a> submarine and track Largo to a location known as The Tears of Allah, below a desert <a href="oasis" class="uri" title="wikilink">oasis</a>. Bond and Leiter infiltrate the underground facility and a gun battle erupts between Felix's team and Largo's men in the temple. In the confusion Largo makes a getaway with one of the warheads. Bond catches and fights Largo underwater. Just as Largo tries to detonate the last bomb, he is killed by Domino, taking revenge for her brother's death. Bond then returns to the Bahamas with Domino.</p>

<h2 id="production">Production</h2>
<p><em>Never Say Never Again</em> had its origins in the early 1960s following the controversy over the 1961 <a href="Thunderball_(novel)#Controversy" title="wikilink">Thunderball novel</a>. Fleming, along with independent producer Kevin McClory and scriptwriter <a href="Jack_Whittingham" title="wikilink">Jack Whittingham</a> had worked together on a script for a potential Bond film, to be called Longitude 78 West,<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> which was subsequently abandoned because of the costs involved. Fleming, &quot;always reluctant to let a good idea lie idle&quot;, turned this into the novel <em>Thunderball</em> which did not credit either McClory or Whittingham; McClory then took Fleming to the <a href="High_Court_of_Justice" title="wikilink">High Court</a> in London for breach of copyright and the matter was settled in 1963.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> (When Fleming left the Court in 1963 he said: &quot;I feel Bond would have done something to liven it up...like shooting the judge.&quot;)<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> After Eon Productions started producing the Bond films, they subsequently made a deal with McClory to make the film <em>Thunderball</em> (with McClory as a producer) with McClory agreeing not to make any further version of <em>Thunderball</em> for a period of ten years following the release of the Eon-produced version in 1965.</p>
<p>In the mid-1970s McClory again started working on a project to bring the film to production and, with the working title <em>Warhead</em> he brought writer <a href="Len_Deighton" title="wikilink">Len Deighton</a> together with Sean Connery to work on a script. The script ran into difficulties after accusations from Eon Productions that the project had gone beyond copyright restrictions, which confined McClory to a film based on the <em>Thunderball</em> novel only, and once again the project was deferred. Towards the end of the 1970s developments were reported on the project under the name <em>James Bond of the Secret Service</em>, but when producer <a href="Jack_Schwartzman" title="wikilink">Jack Schwartzman</a> became involved and cleared a number of the legal issues that still surrounded the project he brought on board scriptwriter <a href="Lorenzo_Semple_Jr" title="wikilink">Lorenzo Semple Jr</a> to work on the screenplay. Connery was unhappy with some aspects of the work and asked British television writers <a href="Dick_Clement" title="wikilink">Dick Clement</a> and <a href="Ian_La_Frenais" title="wikilink">Ian La Frenais</a><a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> to undertake re-writes, although they went uncredited for their efforts because of a restriction by the <a href="Writers_Guild_of_America" title="wikilink">Writers Guild of America</a>. The film underwent one final change in title: after Connery had finished filming <em>Diamonds are Forever</em> he had pledged that he would &quot;never&quot; play Bond again. Connery's wife, Micheline, suggested the title <em>Never Say Never Again</em>, referring to her husband's vow.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> She is mentioned in the final credits of the film with &quot;Title &quot;<em>Never Say Never Again</em>&quot; By: Micheline Connery&quot;. A final attempt by Fleming's trustees to block the film was made in the High Courts in London in the spring of 1983, but these were thrown out by the court and <em>Never Say Never Again</em> was permitted to proceed.</p>
<h3 id="cast-and-crew">Cast and crew</h3>
<p>When producer Kevin McClory had first planned the film in 1964 he held initial talks with <a href="Richard_Burton" title="wikilink">Richard Burton</a> for the part of Bond,<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> although the project came to nothing because of the legal issues involved. When the <em>Warhead</em> project was launched in the late 1970s, a number of actors were mentioned in the trade press, including <a href="Orson_Welles" title="wikilink">Orson Welles</a> for the part of Blofeld, <a href="Trevor_Howard" title="wikilink">Trevor Howard</a> to play M and <a href="Richard_Attenborough" title="wikilink">Richard Attenborough</a> as director. In 1978 the working title <em>James Bond of the Secret Service</em> was being used and Connery was in the frame once again, potentially going head-to-head with the next Eon Bond film, <a href="Moonraker_(film)" title="wikilink"><em>Moonraker</em></a>.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> By 1980, with legal issues again causing the project to founder, Connery thought himself unlikely to play the role, as he stated in an interview in the <em><a href="Sunday_Express" title="wikilink">Sunday Express</a></em> &quot;when I first worked on the script with Len I had no thought of actually being in the film&quot;.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> When producer Jack Schwartzman became involved, he asked Connery to play Bond: Connery agreed, asking (and getting) a fee of $3 million, ($ million in  dollars) a percentage of the profits, as well as casting and script approval. Subsequent to Connery reprising the role, the script has several references to Bond's advancing years &lt;U+2013&gt; playing on Connery being 52 at the time of filming &lt;U+2013&gt; and academic Jeremy Black has pointed out that there are other aspects of age and disillusionment in the film, such as the Shrubland's porter referring to Bond's car (&quot;they don't make them like that any more&quot;), the new M having no use for the 00 section and Q with his reduced budgets.</p>
<p>For the main villain in the film, Maximillian Largo, Connery suggested Klaus Maria Brandauer, the lead of the 1981 <a href="Academy_Award" title="wikilink">Academy Award</a>-winning Hungarian film <a href="Mephisto_(1981_film)" title="wikilink"><em>Mephisto</em></a>. Through the same route came <a href="Max_von_Sydow" title="wikilink">Max von Sydow</a> as Ernst Stavro Blofeld, although he still retained his Eon-originated white cat in the film. For the <a href="femme_fatale" title="wikilink">femme fatale</a>, Director Irvin Kershner selected former model and <em><a href="Playgirl" class="uri" title="wikilink">Playgirl</a></em> cover girl Barbara Carrera to play Fatima Blush &lt;U+2013&gt; the name coming from one of the early scripts of <a href="Thunderball_(novel)" title="wikilink"><em>Thunderball</em></a>. Carrera was nominated for a <a href="Golden_Globe_Award" title="wikilink">Golden Globe Award</a><a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> at the <a href="Golden_Globe_Award_for_Best_Supporting_Actress_&lt;U+2013&gt;_Motion_Picture#1980s" title="wikilink">1984 awards</a> for her portrayal of Fatima Blush, losing out to <a href="Cher" class="uri" title="wikilink">Cher</a> for her role in <em><a href="Silkwood" class="uri" title="wikilink">Silkwood</a></em>.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<p>Micheline Connery, Sean's wife, had met up-and-coming actress Kim Basinger at a hotel in London and suggested her to Connery, which he agreed upon. For the role of Felix Leiter, Connery spoke with Bernie Casey, saying that as the Leiter role was never remembered by audiences, using a black Leiter may make him more memorable. Others cast included comedian <a href="Rowan_Atkinson" title="wikilink">Rowan Atkinson</a>, who would later parody Bond in his role of <em><a href="Johnny_English" title="wikilink">Johnny English</a></em>.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<p>Former Eon Production's editor and director of <em><a href="On_Her_Majesty&#39;s_Secret_Service_(film)" title="wikilink">On Her Majesty's Secret Service</a></em>, <a href="Peter_R._Hunt" title="wikilink">Peter R. Hunt</a>, was approached to direct the film but declined due to his previous work with Eon.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> <a href="Irvin_Kershner" title="wikilink">Irvin Kershner</a>, who had achieved success in 1980 with <a href="Star_Wars_Episode_V:_The_Empire_Strikes_Back" title="wikilink"><em>The Empire Strikes Back</em></a> was then hired. A number of the crew from the 1981 film <em><a href="Raiders_of_the_Lost_Ark" title="wikilink">Raiders of the Lost Ark</a></em> were also appointed, including <a href="second_unit" title="wikilink">second unit</a> director <a href="David_Tomblin" title="wikilink">David Tomblin</a>; <a href="Cinematographer" title="wikilink">director of photography</a> <a href="Douglas_Slocombe" title="wikilink">Douglas Slocombe</a> and <a href="production_designer" title="wikilink">production designers</a> <a href="Philip_Harrison" title="wikilink">Philip Harrison</a> and <a href="Stephen_B._Grimes" title="wikilink">Stephen Grimes</a>.</p>

The Spanish city of <a href="Almer&lt;U+00ED&gt;a" class="uri" title="wikilink">Almer&lt;U+00ED&gt;a</a> was also used as a location.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> For Largo's ship, the <em>Flying Saucer</em>, the yacht <em>Nabila</em>, owned by Saudi billionaire, <a href="Adnan_Khashoggi" title="wikilink">Adnan Khashoggi</a>, was used. The boat, now owned by Prince <a href="Al-Waleed_bin_Talal" title="wikilink">Al-Waleed bin Talal</a>, has subsequently been re-named the <em>Kingdom 5KR</em>.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> Principal photography finished at <a href="Elstree_Studios" title="wikilink">Elstree Studios</a> where interior shots where filmed. Elstree also housed the 'Tears of Allah' underwater cavern, which took three months to construct. Most of the filming was completed in the spring of 1983, although there was some additional shooting during the summer of 1983.</p>
<p>Production on the film was troubled with Connery taking on many of the production duties with assistant director David Tomblin. Director Irvin Kershner was critical of producer Jack Schwartzman, saying that whilst he was a good businessman &quot;he didn't have the experience of a film producer&quot;. After the production ran out of money, Schwartzman had to fund further production out of his own pocket and later admitted he had underestimated the amount the film would cost to make.</p>
<p>Many of the elements of the Eon-produced Bond films were not present in <em>Never Say Never Again</em> for legal reasons. These included the <a href="Gun_barrel_sequence_(James_Bond)" title="wikilink">gunbarrel sequence</a>, where a screen full of 007 symbols appeared instead, and similarly there was no 'James Bond Theme' to use, although no effort was made to supplement another tune. <em>Never Say Never Again</em> did not use a pre-credits sequence, which was filmed but not used; instead the film opens with the credits run over the top of the opening sequence of Bond on a training mission.</p>
<h3 id="music">Music</h3>
<p>The music for <em>Never Say Never Again</em> was scored by <a href="Michel_Legrand" title="wikilink">Michel Legrand</a> who had worked on the 1968 film <a href="The_Thomas_Crown_Affair_(1968_film)" title="wikilink"><em>The Thomas Crown Affair</em></a>, winning an <a href="Academy_Award" title="wikilink">Academy Award</a> for <a href="The_Windmills_of_Your_Mind" title="wikilink">The Windmills of Your Mind</a>.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> The score has been criticised as &quot;anachronistic and misjudged&quot;, &quot;bizzarely intermittent&quot; and &quot;the most disappointing feature of the film&quot;. Legrand also wrote the main theme 'Never Say Never Again', which carried the lyrics of <a href="Alan_Bergman" title="wikilink">Alan</a> and <a href="Marilyn_Bergman" title="wikilink">Marilyn Bergman</a>, who had also won the Academy Award with Legrand for The Windmills of Your Mind.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> 'Never Say Never Again' was sung by <a href="Lani_Hall" title="wikilink">Lani Hall</a>.</p>

<p><em>Never Say Never Again</em> was broadly welcomed and praised by the critics: <a href="Ian_Christie_(film_scholar)" title="wikilink"> Ian Christie</a>, writing in the <em><a href="Daily_Express" title="wikilink">Daily Express</a></em>, said that <em>Never Say Never Again</em> was &quot;one of the better Bonds&quot;,<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> finding the film &quot;superbly witty and entertaining, &lt;U+2026&gt;the dialogue is crisp and the fight scenes imaginative.&quot;<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> Christie also thought that &quot;Connery has lost none of his charm and, if anything, is more appealing than ever as the stylish resolute hero.&quot;<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> <a href="David_Robinson_(film_critic)" title="wikilink">David Robinson</a>, writing in <em><a href="The_Times" title="wikilink">The Times</a></em> also concentrated on Connery, saying that: &quot;Connery...is back, looking hardly a day older or thicker, and still outclassing every other exponent of the role, in the goodnatured throwaway with which he parries all the sex and violence on the way&quot;.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> For Robinson, the presence of Connery and Klaus Maria Brandauer as Maximillian Largo &quot;very nearly make it all worthwhile.&quot;<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> The reviewer for <a href="Time_Out_(company)" title="wikilink"><em>Time Out</em></a> summed up <em>Never Say Never Again</em> saying &quot;The action's good, the photography excellent, the sets decent; but the real clincher is the fact that Bond is once more played by a man with the right stuff.&quot;<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a></p>
<p><a href="Derek_Malcolm" title="wikilink">Derek Malcolm</a> in <em><a href="The_Guardian" title="wikilink">The Guardian</a></em> showed himself to be a fan of Connery's Bond, saying the film contains &quot;the best Bond in the business&quot;,<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> but nevertheless did not find <em>Never Say Never Again</em> any more enjoyable than the recently released <em>Octopussy</em> (starring Roger Moore), or &quot;that either of them came very near to matching <a href="Dr._No_(film)" title="wikilink"><em>Dr. No</em></a> or <a href="From_Russia_with_Love_(film)" title="wikilink"><em>From Russia with Love</em></a>.&quot;<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> Malcolm's main issue with the film was that he had a &quot;feeling that a constant struggle was going on between a desire to make a huge box-office success and the effort to make character as important as stunts.&quot;<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> Malcolm summed up that &quot;the mix remains obstinately the same-up to scratch but not surpassing it.&quot;<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> Writing in <em>The Guardian</em>'s sister paper, <em><a href="The_Observer" title="wikilink">The Observer</a></em>, <a href="Philip_French" title="wikilink">Philip French</a> noted that &quot;this curiously muted film ends up making no contribution of its own and inviting damaging comparisons with the original, hyper-confident <em>Thunderball</em>&quot;.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> French concluded that &quot;like an hour-glass full of damp sand, the picture moves with increasing slowness as it approaches a confused climax in the Persian Gulf.&quot;<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a></p>
<p>Writing for <em><a href="Newsweek" class="uri" title="wikilink">Newsweek</a></em>, critic <a href="Jack_Kroll" title="wikilink">Jack Kroll</a> thought the early part of the film was handled &quot;with wit and style&quot;,<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> although he went on to say that the director was &quot;hamstrung by Lorenzo Semple's script&quot;.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> <a href="Richard_Schickel" title="wikilink">Richard Schickel</a>, writing in <a href="Time_(magazine)" title="wikilink"> <em>Time</em></a> magazine was praising of the film and its cast. He wrote that Klaus Maria Brandauer was &quot;played with silky, neurotic charm&quot;,<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> whilst Barbara Carrera, playing Fatima Blush, &quot;deftly parodies all the fatal femmes who have slithered through Bond's career&quot;.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> Schickel&lt;U+2019&gt;s highest praise was saved for the return of Connery, observing &quot;it is good to see Connery's grave stylishness in this role again. It makes Bond's cynicism and opportunism seem the product of genuine worldliness (and world weariness) as opposed to Roger Moore's mere twirpishness.&quot;<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a></p>
<p><a href="Janet_Maslin" title="wikilink">Janet Maslin</a>, writing in <em><a href="The_New_York_Times" title="wikilink">The New York Times</a></em>, was broadly praising of the film, saying she thought that <em>Never Say Never Again</em> &quot;has noticeably more humor and character than the Bond films usually provide. It has a marvelous villain in Largo.&quot;<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> Maslin also thought highly of Connery in the role, observing that &quot;in <em>Never Say Never Again</em>, the formula is broadened to accommodate an older, seasoned man of much greater stature, and Mr. Connery expertly fills the bill.&quot;<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> Writing in <em><a href="The_Washington_Post" title="wikilink">The Washington Post</a></em>, Gary Arnold was fulsome in his praise, saying that <em>Never Say Never Again</em> is &quot;one of the best James Bond adventure thrillers ever made&quot;,<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> going on to say that &quot;this picture is likely to remain a cherished, savory example of commercial filmmaking at its most astute and accomplished.&quot;<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> Arnold went further, saying that &quot;<em>Never Say Never Again</em> is the best acted Bond picture ever made, because it clearly surpasses any predecessors in the area of inventive and clever character delineation&quot;.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a></p>
<p>The critic for <em><a href="The_Globe_and_Mail" title="wikilink">The Globe and Mail</a></em>, <a href="Jay_Scott" title="wikilink">Jay Scott</a>, also praised the film, saying that <em>Never Say Never Again</em> &quot;may be the only instalment of the long-running series that has been helmed by a first-rate director&quot;.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a> According to Scott, the director, with high quality support cast, resulted in the &quot;classiest of all the Bonds&quot;.<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> <a href="Roger_Ebert" title="wikilink">Roger Ebert</a> gave the film 3&lt;U+00BD&gt; out of 4 stars, and wrote that <em>Never Say Never Again</em>, while consisting of a basic &quot;Bond plot&quot;, was different from other Bond films: &quot;For one thing, there's more of a human element in the movie, and it comes from Klaus Maria Brandauer, as Largo.&quot;<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a> Ebert went on to add, &quot;there was never a Beatles reunion...but here, by God, is Sean Connery as Sir James Bond. Good work, 007.&quot;<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="reflective-reviews">Reflective reviews</h3>
<p>Because <em>Never Say Never Again</em> is not an Eon-produced film, it has not been included in a number of subsequent reviews. Norman Wilner of <a href="MSN" class="uri" title="wikilink">MSN</a> said that 1967's <a href="Casino_Royale_(1967_film)" title="wikilink"><em>Casino Royale</em></a> and <em>Never Say Never Again</em> &quot;exist outside the 'official' continuity, [and] are excluded from this list, just as they&lt;U+2019&gt;re absent from MGM&lt;U+2019&gt;s megabox. But take my word for it; they&lt;U+2019&gt;re both pretty awful.&quot;<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a> Of the more recent reviews, opinion on <em>Never Say Never Again</em> is still mixed: film review aggregator <a href="Rotten_Tomatoes" title="wikilink">Rotten Tomatoes</a> lists the film with a positive 65% &lt;U+2018&gt;fresh&lt;U+2019&gt; rating from 34 reviews; among the reviewers listed in &quot;Top Critics&quot; the score rises to 71% from 7 reviews.<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a> The score is still more positive than some of the Eon films, with Rotten Tomatoes ranking <em>Never Say Never Again</em> 16th among all Bond films in 2008.<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a> <em><a href="Empire_(magazine)" title="wikilink">Empire</a></em> gives the film three of a possible five stars, observing that &quot;Connery was perhaps wise to call it quits the first time round&quot;.<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a> <a href="IGN" class="uri" title="wikilink">IGN</a> gave <em>Never Say Never Again</em> a score of 5 out of ten, claiming that the film is &quot;is more miss than hit&quot;.<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a> The review also thought that the film was &quot;marred with too many clunky exposition scenes and not enough moments of Bond being Bond&quot;.<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1995 Michael Sauter of <em><a href="Entertainment_Weekly" title="wikilink">Entertainment Weekly</a></em> rated <em>never Say Never Again</em> as the ninth best Bond film to that point, after seventeen films had been released. Sauter thought the film &quot;is successful only as a portrait of an over-the-hill superhero.&quot;<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a> He did admit, however that &quot;even past his prime, Connery proves that nobody does it better&quot;.<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a> <a href="James_Berardinelli" title="wikilink">James Berardinelli</a>, in his review of '' Never Say Never Again'', thinks the re-writing of the <em>Thunderball</em> story has led to a film which has &quot;a hokey, jokey feel, [it] is possibly the worst-written Bond script of all&quot;.<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a> Berardinelli concludes that &quot;it's a major disappointment that, having lured back the original 007, the film makers couldn't offer him something better than this drawn-out, hackneyed story.&quot;<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a> Critic <a href="Danny_Peary" title="wikilink">Danny Peary</a> wrote that &quot;it was great to see Sean Connery return as James Bond after a dozen years&quot;. He also thought the supporting cast was good, saying that Klaus Maria Brandauer&lt;U+2019&gt;s Largo was &quot;neurotic, vulnerable&lt;U+2026&gt;one of the most complex of Bond&lt;U+2019&gt;s foes&quot; and that Barbara Carrera and Kim Basinger &quot;make lasting impressions.&quot; Peary also wrote that the &quot;film is exotic, well acted, and stylishly directed&lt;U+2026&gt;It would be one of the best Bond films if the finale weren't disappointing. When will filmmakers realize that underwater fight scenes don't work because viewers usually can&lt;U+2019&gt;t tell the hero and villain apart and they know doubles are being used?&quot;</p>

<p>In the 1990s, McClory announced plans to make another adaption of the <em>Thunderball</em> story, <em>Warhead 2000 AD</em>, with <a href="Timothy_Dalton" title="wikilink">Timothy Dalton</a> in the lead role, but this was eventually scrapped.<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a> In 1997 the Sony Corporation acquired all or some of McClory's rights in an undisclosed deal,<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a> and subsequently announced that it intended to make a series of Bond films, as the company also held the rights to <em><a href="Casino_Royale_(novel)" title="wikilink">Casino Royale</a></em>.<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a> This move prompted a round of litigation from MGM, which was settled in an out-of-court settlement in which Sony gave up all claims on Bond, although McClory still claimed he would proceed with another Bond film,<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a> and continued his case against MGM and Danjaq;<a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a> on 27 August 2001 the court rejected McClory's suit.<a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a> McClory died in 2006.<a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a></p>
<p>On 4 December 1997, MGM announced that the company had purchased the rights to <em>Never Say Never Again</em> from Schwartzman's company Taliafilm.<a href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a><a href="#fn67" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a> The company has since handled the release of both the DVD and Blu-Ray editions of the film.<a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a></p>
