Large-scale Japanese immigration to the islands occurred in the 1920s and 1930s, when Japan encouraged immigration to the islands in the <a href="South_Pacific_Mandate" title="wikilink">South Pacific Mandate</a> to offset demographic and economic problems which the country faced.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>

<p>The first recorded contact between the Japanese and Pacific Islanders (believed to be Micronesians) was reflected in the <em>Kokon Chomon Jyu</em>,{{#tag:ref|A Japanese historical chronicle.|group=fn}} when eight men arrived at Okinoshima (an ancient town in modern-day <a href="Izu_Province" title="wikilink">Izu Province</a>) in July 1171. They were described to be tall, having dark-brown and tattooed skin, wearing ornaments as well as having coarse hair. The Japanese served them some millet and sake, and left the town after a hostile encounter when the men attempted to take the bows and spears.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> Japanese contact was also suggested by some anthorpologists in the 19th century, and at least one, James McKinney Alexander suggested that Micronesians may have intermarried with Japanese fishermen who were strayed off course and stranded in the islands. In a 1895 study, Alexander noted similarities between the cultural traditions, vocabulary and the pre-Christian beliefs between <a href="Pohnpei" title="wikilink">Pohnpeian</a> and <a href="Kosrae" title="wikilink">Kosraeans</a>.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> Studies done by other Japanese anthropologists in the 19th and 20th centuries noted that at least 60 Japanese vessels drifted into the <a href="Pacific_Ocean" title="wikilink">Pacific Ocean</a> between the 17th and 19th centuries and could have made windfalls in the Pacific Islands.{{#tag:ref|One Japanese anthropologist, Yosihiko Sinoto, supports this possibility.

<p>In 1890, two Japanese businessmen, Ukichi Taguchi and Tsunenori Suzuki formed the <em>Nanto Shokai</em> (South Seas Trading Company) with the aim of developing Japanese commerical interests in Micronesia. They bought a sailing ship, <em>Tenyu Maru</em> and sailed for <a href="Yap" class="uri" title="wikilink">Yap</a> in June and befriended a shipwrecked <a href="Irish_American" title="wikilink">Irish American</a> missionary, Daniel O'Keefe, but set sail for Pohnpei after two days. They set up a small store peddling Japanese wares under strict conditions imposed by the Spanish, and returned to Japan in December because of a dwindling funds. The ship was later sold to the Ichiya company which established two trading stations at Chuuk and Pohnpei. More Japanese businessmen arrived in Chuuk in 1892 under the charge of Mizutani and established a store at Chuuk in 1892.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> A few Japanese, notably <a href="Koben_Mori" title="wikilink">Koben Mori</a>, began socialising with the Chuukese and led semi-nomadic lifestyles until 1896 before gaining the protection of Spanish guards. Mori lived with a few Japanese compatriots, and became the resident agent for <em>Hiki Shokai</em>, another Japanese trading company that had set up that came to set up a shop at <a href="Moen_(island)" title="wikilink">Moen</a>.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
<p>The Japanese businessmen that were based at Moen were repatriated from Micronesia in 1900, a year after Spain ceded its sovereignty to Germany.

Japanese settlers also started to come in small numbers to Chuuk to engage in farming or fishing activities.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> The German colonial administration granted the Japanese settlers equal rights with other European settlers in German-mandated territories, by justifying them as citizens of an imperialist power.

<p>The <a href="First_World_War" title="wikilink">First World War</a> saw many nations leap to take Germany's overseas possessions for themselves, and Micronesia was no exception. A Japanese warship sailed into <a href="Truk_Lagoon" title="wikilink">Truk Lagoon</a> in October 1914; it was greeted by Japanese settlers living in the nearby islands.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> The navy set up its regional headquarters at Chuuk and stationed a garrison at Pohnpei until 1922, where the region's administrative capital <a href="Kolonia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kolonia</a> was established under the <a href="South_Pacific_Mandate" title="wikilink">South Pacific Mandate</a>. When a civilian government was established in March 1922, there were about 150 Japanese living in Pohnpei, which consisted of traders and government officials. Another seventy Japanese immigrated to Pohnpei until 1930, and a few individuals also settled in neighbouring Chuuk, Kosrae and Yap.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> In Chuuk, another hundred Japanese businessmen settled at Toloas by the late 1920s to cater to governmental business intetests. A few elementary schools were also built to cater to the local Japanese and Chuukese populace.{{#tag:ref|Of particular note was Koben Mori's influence to Chuuk's affairs in the 1920s. He was hired as a civilian affairs adviser by the military in 1916, and had a copra plantation and business interests in Chuuk by the 1920s. Mori was respected by both Japanese and the Chuukese alike and was elected as a communal chief by the Chuukese in the late 1920s.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a>|group=fn}}<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a></p>
<p>The majority of the settlers who came before 1930 consisted of <a href="Ryukyuan_people" title="wikilink">Okinawans</a>. A tuna canning factory was set up at Pohnpei in 1930, and Japanese settlers from the <a href="T&lt;U+014D&gt;hoku_region" title="wikilink">T&lt;U+014D&gt;hoku region</a> and <a href="Hokkaido" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hokkaido</a> later came in greater numbers after that. Some of whom also became fishermen, while others organised farming communes. The civilian government persuaded twenty-four families to establish a farming commune at <a href="Palikir" class="uri" title="wikilink">Palikir</a> in 1931, but the settlers faced problems adapting to the tropical climate and bringing their vegetable produce to Kolonia for sale. The civilian government moved in to quickly improve the transport network and electrical supplies throughout Pohnpei. In addition, they also granted larger tracts of land to the settlers, and the settlers also went into rice cultivation. More settlers followed suit, and an anthropologist, Umesao Tadao reported that the farming settlement in Pohnpei was well-established by 1941.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a></p>
<p>The Japanese populace at the other islands grew at a slower rateâ€“although less so for <a href="Chuuk" class="uri" title="wikilink">Chuuk</a>, and Japanese tend to prefer to settle in low-lying areas like <a href="Tomil" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tomil</a> and <a href="Tol_(island)" title="wikilink">Tol</a>.

<p>Intermarriage between Japanese men and Micronesian women were encouraged, especially in Pohnpei and Chuuk where there are large Japanese populations.

<p>The Japanese population were repatriated back to Japan after the war, but most people of mixed Japanese-Micronesian remained in the islands and constituted a substantial percentage in the islands' percentages. They became assimiliated with the Micronesians,<a href="#fn78" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref78"><sup>78</sup></a> and in all official census they are identified by their Micronesian heritage.<a href="#fn79" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref79"><sup>79</sup></a> In 2001, the director of Japan's Institute for Pacific Studies, Izumi Kobayashi estimated that at least 23% of FSM's population had Japanese ancestry.<a href="#fn80" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref80"><sup>80</sup></a> An official estimate in 2006 puts the number a little below 20%.<a href="#fn81" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref81"><sup>81</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="religion">Religion</h2>
<p>Japanese settlers were generally followers of <a href="Shinto" class="uri" title="wikilink">Shinto</a> and <a href="Buddhism" class="uri" title="wikilink">Buddhism</a>. In the central and eastern Carolines, religious activities were less widely publicised than in the Marianas or Palau. In towns with a sizeable Japanese populace, the civilian government would fund the construction of at least one public shrine in each town, and in smaller Japanese settlements, community leaders would direct the construction of a small shrine for communal purposes.<a href="#fn82" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref82"><sup>82</sup></a> Two Buddhist temples were also constructed during the Japanese colonial era, one at Dublon in Pohnpei and another in Chuuk.<a href="#fn83" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref83"><sup>83</sup></a></p>
<p>Christian missionary activitiesâ€“particularly <a href="Protestant" class="uri" title="wikilink">Protestant</a>â€“were more commonly seen in the central and eastern Carolines than in the other mandated islands. Four <a href="Congregationalist" class="uri" title="wikilink">Congregationalist</a> missionaries were sent to the Chuuk and Pohnpei in 1920 and received partial funding from the government.<a href="#fn84" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref84"><sup>84</sup></a> Although Christian missionary activities were intended to cater to the spiritual needs of Micronesians, a few Japanese settlers and government officials also patronised the missionaries. Missionary and church services were suppressed from the late-1930s, but the continued presence of Japanese Christians prompted the civilian government to permit private church services until the Japanese surrender.<a href="#fn85" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref85"><sup>85</sup></a> After the Japanese settlers were repatriated, the Shinto shrines and Buddhist temples were either abandoned or demolished. People of mixed Japanese-Micronesian heritage adopted Christianity in favour of Shinto and Buddhism.<a href="#fn86" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref86"><sup>86</sup></a><a href="#fn87" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref87"><sup>87</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="language">Language</h2>
<p>Early Japanese settlers taught their children to speak in the Japanese language. Some also learnty to speak some Micronesian languages, especially for traders and settlers who took Micronesian wives.<a href="#fn88" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref88"><sup>88</sup></a> Japanese replaced the Micronesian languages as the <a href="lingua_franca" title="wikilink">lingua franca</a> for day-to-day communication and administrative purposes, and both Japanese and Micronesians.<a href="#fn89" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref89"><sup>89</sup></a> Day-to-day use of Japanese was discouraged when Micronesia came under <a href="United_Nation" title="wikilink">United Nation</a> trusteeship, and people of mixed Japanese-Micronesian heritage switched to using English and various Micronesian languages in their daily lives.<a href="#fn90" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref90"><sup>90</sup></a> Japan's economic influence in Micronesia has prompted cultural organisations to promote the learning of Japanese language among FSM citizens.<a href="#fn91" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref91"><sup>91</sup></a> Elementary Japanese had been offered as a foreign language in some schools, notably in the <a href="College_of_Micronesia-FSM" title="wikilink">College of Micronesia-FSM</a>.<a href="#fn92" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref92"><sup>92</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="economy">Economy</h2>
<p>A few Japanese trading companies established businesses at Chuuk and Pohnpei in the 1890s, and Koben Mori acted as its resident agent, helping to facilitate trade with the islanders. The early Japanese businessmen traded on alocholic products, explosives and Chinaware.<a href="#fn93" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref93"><sup>93</sup></a> Contraband products like alcohol and weapons were also illegally traded illegally, and the Spanish administration made futile attempts to suppress these activities.<a href="#fn94" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref94"><sup>94</sup></a> The Japanese traders were expelled from Chuuk and Pohnpei in 1900 when the Germans purchased the islands from <a href="Spain" class="uri" title="wikilink">Spain</a>, but Japanese traders returned to Chuuk in 1907 and set up a trading firm dealing with copra production.<a href="#fn95" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref95"><sup>95</sup></a> After the Japanese annexed Micronesia from <a href="Germany" class="uri" title="wikilink">Germany</a> in 1914, they gained a monopoly over the shipping routes in all of the mandated islands.<a href="#fn96" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref96"><sup>96</sup></a> The rate of copra production reached twelve thousand tons per year by the 1920s, and had an export value of two million yen.<a href="#fn97" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref97"><sup>97</sup></a> In the late 1920s, an Okinawan fisherman, Tamashiro established a <a href="tuna" class="uri" title="wikilink">tuna</a> production factory at <a href="Wonei" class="uri" title="wikilink">Wonei</a>. The Japanese government provided incentives for fishermen to open new fishery production factories, and in 1937 there were at least 1500 Okinawans and Japanese who were employed in the fishery industry.<a href="#fn98" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref98"><sup>98</sup></a> Japanese settlers introduced commercial agriculture in Pohnpei and to a smaller extent in Chuuk and Yap. A few Japanese businessmen also set up firms to oversee the plantatation of cash crops, including <a href="copra" class="uri" title="wikilink">copra</a>, <a href="rice" class="uri" title="wikilink">rice</a> and pineapples. They constituted the main exports in the central and eastern Carolines.<a href="#fn99" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref99"><sup>99</sup></a></p>
<p>After the Japanese surrender in 1945, the Allied occupation authorities scrapped all organisations pertaining to overseas trade, banking, finance and colonisation, and effectively led to an end on Japanese influence in Micronesia.<a href="#fn100" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref100"><sup>100</sup></a> Trade restrictions were then enforced between Japan and Micronesia in the first two decades after the war, but were gradually removed in stages between 1973 and 1983.<a href="#fn101" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref101"><sup>101</sup></a> Japanese tourists began to visit the islands from the 1960s onwards, and private businesses were allowed to invest in hotel construction and fisheries.<a href="#fn102" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref102"><sup>102</sup></a> Tourists from Japan could become one of the Federated States of Micronesia's principal economic driving forces, and the country would like to attract a greater share of the 30 million Japanese visiting foreign destinations annually.<a href="#fn103" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref103"><sup>103</sup></a> Sites of historical interests such as the sunken Japanese ships at Chuuk lagoon received the highest concentration of Japanese visitors.<a href="#fn104" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref104"><sup>104</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="interethnic-relations-in-society">Interethnic relations in society</h2>
<p>Racial segregation was practiced from the early days of civilian rule, and policies were enforced to restrict Micronesians in the education, work force, health care benefits and civil service to inferior positions as compared to their Japanese counterparts. The local populace was classified according to ethnicity, with the Japanese at the top of the social strata, followed by Okinawans, Koreans and the Micronesians at the bottom, although some scholars argued that the Micronesians were accorded a more privileged position than the Koreans, who often subjected to abuse by the Japanese authorities.<a href="#fn105" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref105"><sup>105</sup></a> In the education sector, Micronesian children attended public schools (<em>logakko</em> in Japanese) that emphasised on teaching vocational skills, self-discipline and a basic command of the Japanese language. Japanese, Okinawan and Korean children attended primary schools (<em>shogakko</em>) with lessons that were based on the mainstream Japanese curriculum.<a href="#fn106" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref106"><sup>106</sup></a> Very few Micronesians progressed beyond the elementary level, and those who did usually had family connections with influential Japanese figures.<a href="#fn107" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref107"><sup>107</sup></a> Micronesians were generally accorded lower-ranking jobs, and most were employed as language interpreters, administrative assistants or jobs that required menial labour.<a href="#fn108" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref108"><sup>108</sup></a></p>
<p>The Japanese actively discouraged the practice of Micronesian customs and religions, which they had viewed it as &quot;primitive&quot; and &quot;barbaric&quot;. Christian missionary activity among the Micronesians was encouraged by the civilian government during the <a href="Interwar_period" title="wikilink">Interwar period</a>, with the hope that they could facilitate Micronesians to adopt modern cultural practices.<a href="#fn109" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref109"><sup>109</sup></a> Japanese cultural practices were actively encouraged; many Micronesians learnt to speak Japanese fluently and adopted Japanese manners and customs.<a href="#fn110" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref110"><sup>110</sup></a> On the other hand, many Koreans did not speak Japanese well, and eagerness of Okinawans to engage in manual labour occassionally motivated Micronesians to make critical remarks on the actual nature of the Japanese culture that Japanese administrators advocated to the Micronesians.<a href="#fn111" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref111"><sup>111</sup></a> Japanese cultural influences were the strongest in Chuuk and Pohnpei, and in most towns by the 1920s, most Micronesians were dressed in Western or Japanese style-clothing.<a href="#fn112" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref112"><sup>112</sup></a> Micronesians in these two states were also very receptive to promiscuous liaisons between Japanese men and Micronesian women; the first brothels appeared in both states in the 1910s. Separate brothels were established for Japanese and Micronesian men, although women in both types of brothels were mainly Micronesian women.<a href="#fn113" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref113"><sup>113</sup></a></p>
<p>In Kosrae and Yap, the Japanese administration had to contend with considerable resistance from the islanders to accept Japanese political and cultural influences. Anti-Japanese sentiment was developed from the early days of Japanese rule in Kosrae, when a Japanese sergeant who was placed in-charge of the island's administrative affairs often threatened the islanders with physical abuse when dealing with conflicts.<a href="#fn114" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref114"><sup>114</sup></a> Japanese customs were also frowned upon by Kosraeans as the practice of cremation for the dead and the administrators' indifference towards nudity clashed with the Christian moral values that the islanders held to.<a href="#fn115" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref115"><sup>115</sup></a> Similarly in Yap, the islanders' negative attitudes towards the Japanese was developed as a result of incidences of cultural insensitivity from the Japanese administrators. In particular, the introduction of <a href="Chamorro_people" title="wikilink">Chamorros</a> by the Japanese administration to work as policemen in the island incited racial hatred of Yapese chiefs against the Japanese. As a consequence, few Japanese immigrants chose to settle in Yap or Kosrae.<a href="#fn116" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref116"><sup>116</sup></a>{{#tag:ref|In 1935, only 25 Japanese lived among 1,189 Kosraeans.<a href="#fn117" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref117"><sup>117</sup></a>|group=fn}}</p>
