<p>Following Bad Blood, Raw <a href="WWE_Raw#Commentators" title="wikilink">commentator</a> <a href="Jim_Ross" title="wikilink">Jim Ross</a> tried making amends between Shawn Michaels and Triple H by making them shake hands. Michaels and Triple H extended their hands to shake, but Kane came out and attacked Michaels, which resulted in Kane <a href="kayfabe" title="wikilink">crushing</a> Michaels <a href="larynx" title="wikilink">throat</a> with a wedged chair.<a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a> Michaels was then taken out in an ambulance for medical attention.<a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a> That same episode, Lita revealed that she was pregnant. On the June 21 episode of <em>Raw</em>, it appeared that Lita's, boyfriend at that time, <a href="Matt_Hardy" title="wikilink">Matt Hardy</a> was going to propose to Lita, but he was interrupted by Kane, who claimed to be the father of Lita's child, as Lita had slept with Kane to persuade him to stop attacking Hardy.<a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a><a href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a> Two months later, it was revealed that Kane was, in fact, the father.<a href="#fn67" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a><a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a> Hardy and Kane feuded for several months, culminating in a &quot;Till Death Do Us Part&quot; match at <a href="SummerSlam_(2004)" title="wikilink">SummerSlam</a>, with the stipulation that Lita would be obliged to marry Kane should Hardy lose.<a href="#fn69" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref69"><sup>69</sup></a><a href="#fn70" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a> Kane won the match,<a href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a> leading to he and a reluctant Lita marrying one another on the August 23 episode of <em>Raw</em>.<a href="#fn72" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref72"><sup>72</sup></a><a href="#fn73" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref73"><sup>73</sup></a> On the August 30 edition of <em>Raw</em>, Kane stated that Eric Bischoff's wedding gift to him and Lita was to name any match he wanted for <a href="Unforgiven_(2004)" title="wikilink">Unforgiven</a>.<a href="#fn74" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref74"><sup>74</sup></a><a href="#fn75" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref75"><sup>75</sup></a> Lita then informed Kane that Bischoff's present was for <em>both</em> of them, where they were able to pick Kane's opponent for Unforgiven, which resulted in Shawn Michaels being picked.<a href="#fn76" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref76"><sup>76</sup></a><a href="#fn77" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref77"><sup>77</sup></a> At Unforgiven, Michaels defeated Kane in a <a href="Professional_wrestling_match_types#No_Disqualification_match" title="wikilink">No Disqualification match</a>.<a href="#fn78" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref78"><sup>78</sup></a></p>
<p>Eric Bischoff informed Triple H that if he could defeat Eugene, for the following week's episode, that he would be Number one contender to face Chris Benoit for the World Heavyweight title.<a href="#fn79" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref79"><sup>79</sup></a><a href="#fn80" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref80"><sup>80</sup></a> The following week on <em>Raw</em>, the match between Triple H and Eugene ended in a No Contest, after Chris Benoit ran down to save Eugene from a chair assault by Triple H.<a href="#fn81" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref81"><sup>81</sup></a><a href="#fn82" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref82"><sup>82</sup></a> On the June 28 edition of <em>Raw</em>, a rematch for the World Heavyweight championship between Benoit and Kane took place. A stipulation was placed that Benoit had to win the match by a submission, as Kane could win by pinfall, submission, disqualification or count out.<a href="#fn83" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref83"><sup>83</sup></a><a href="#fn84" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref84"><sup>84</sup></a> It was also announced that the winner of the match would face Triple H at <a href="Vengeance_(2004)" title="wikilink">Vengeance</a>, in which the World Heavyweight title would be on the line.<a href="#fn85" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref85"><sup>85</sup></a><a href="#fn86" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref86"><sup>86</sup></a> Benoit won the match, after he made Kane submit to an arm trap crossface.<a href="#fn87" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref87"><sup>87</sup></a><a href="#fn88" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref88"><sup>88</sup></a> The following week, Bischoff scheduled a handicap match between Triple H, Ric Flair and Eugene versus Benoit and Edge.

<p>On the June 21 edition of <em>Raw</em>, a confrontation between Randy Orton and The Rock (<a href="Dwayne_Johnson" title="wikilink">Dwayne Johnson</a>) took place. After the Rock assaulted Orton, Bischoff sent security guards to escort the Rock out of the arena. Orton demanded that they stop playing the Rock's theme music. Edge, however, sneaked behind Orton and <a href="Professional_wrestling_attacks#Spear" title="wikilink">speared</a> him.<a href="#fn92" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref92"><sup>92</sup></a><a href="#fn93" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref93"><sup>93</sup></a> That same episode, a tag team match was booked between Edge and Chris Jericho versus Orton and Batista. During the match, Jericho took a shot to the head and was unconscious as they went to commercial break. Several referees went to ringside, and took Jericho to the back, leaving Edge by himself against Orton and Batista. The match saw the team of Orton and Batista defeat Edge.<a href="#fn94" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref94"><sup>94</sup></a><a href="#fn95" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref95"><sup>95</sup></a> The following week, it was announced that Orton would defend the Intercontinental championship against Edge at Vengeance.<a href="#fn96" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref96"><sup>96</sup></a><a href="#fn97" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref97"><sup>97</sup></a> Later that night, per the week before, a similar tag team match between Orton and Batista versus Edge and Jericho took place. This time, Edge and Jericho won the match, after Batista accidentally hit Orton with a <a href="Professional_wrestling_attacks#Lariat" title="wikilink">lariat</a> and Edge spearing Batista, thus allowing Jericho to pin Batista for the win.<a href="#fn98" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref98"><sup>98</sup></a><a href="#fn99" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref99"><sup>99</sup></a> At Vengeance, Orton lost the Intercontinental title to Edge.<a href="#fn100" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref100"><sup>100</sup></a></p>
