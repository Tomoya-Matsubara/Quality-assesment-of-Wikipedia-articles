<p><strong>Asperger syndrome</strong> or <strong>Asperger's syndrome</strong> is an <a href="autism_spectrum" title="wikilink">autism spectrum</a> disorder that is characterized by significant difficulties in social interaction, along with restricted and repetitive patterns of behavior and interests. It differs from other autism spectrum disorders by its relative preservation of <a href="language_development" title="wikilink">linguistic</a> and <a href="cognitive_development" title="wikilink">cognitive development</a>. Although not required for diagnosis, physical clumsiness and atypical use of language are frequently reported.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a><a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>Asperger syndrome is named for the Austrian pediatrician <a href="Hans_Asperger" title="wikilink">Hans Asperger</a> who, in 1944, described children in his practice who lacked <a href="nonverbal_communication" title="wikilink">nonverbal communication</a> skills, demonstrated limited <a href="empathy" class="uri" title="wikilink">empathy</a> with their peers, and were physically clumsy.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> Fifty years later, it was standardized as a <a href="medical_diagnosis" title="wikilink">diagnosis</a>, but many questions remain about aspects of the disorder.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> For example, there is doubt about whether it is distinct from <a href="high-functioning_autism" title="wikilink">high-functioning autism</a> (HFA);<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> partly because of this, its <a href="prevalence" class="uri" title="wikilink">prevalence</a> is not firmly established.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> The diagnosis of Asperger's has been proposed to be eliminated, replaced by a diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder on a severity scale.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>

<h2 id="classification">Classification</h2>
<p>Asperger syndrome (AS) is one of the <a href="autism_spectrum_disorder" title="wikilink">autism spectrum disorders</a> (ASD) or <a href="pervasive_developmental_disorder" title="wikilink">pervasive developmental disorders</a> (PDD), which are a <a href="spectrum_disorder" title="wikilink">spectrum of psychological conditions</a> that are characterized by abnormalities of <a href="social_interaction" title="wikilink">social interaction</a> and communication that pervade the individual's functioning, and by restricted and repetitive interests and behavior. Like other psychological development disorders, ASD begins in infancy or childhood, has a steady course without remission or relapse, and has impairments that result from maturation-related changes in various systems of the brain.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> ASD, in turn, is a subset of the broader autism <a href="phenotype" class="uri" title="wikilink">phenotype</a> (BAP), which describes individuals who may not have ASD but do have <a href="Autism" title="wikilink">autistic</a>-like <a href="Trait_(biology)" title="wikilink">traits</a>, such as social deficits.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> Of the other four ASD forms, <a href="autism" class="uri" title="wikilink">autism</a> is the most similar to AS in signs and likely causes but its diagnosis requires impaired communication and allows delay in <a href="cognitive_development" title="wikilink">cognitive development</a>; <a href="Rett_syndrome" title="wikilink">Rett syndrome</a> and <a href="childhood_disintegrative_disorder" title="wikilink">childhood disintegrative disorder</a> share several signs with autism but may have unrelated causes; and <a href="PDD_not_otherwise_specified" title="wikilink">pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS)</a> is diagnosed when the criteria for a more specific disorder are unmet.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>

<h2 id="characteristics">Characteristics</h2>
<p>A <a href="pervasive_developmental_disorder" title="wikilink">pervasive developmental disorder</a>, Asperger syndrome is distinguished by a pattern of symptoms rather than a single symptom. It is characterized by qualitative impairment in social interaction, by stereotyped and restricted patterns of behavior, activities and interests, and by no clinically significant delay in cognitive development or general delay in language.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> Intense preoccupation with a narrow subject, one-sided verbosity, restricted <a href="Prosody_(linguistics)" title="wikilink">prosody</a>, and physical clumsiness are typical of the condition, but are not required for diagnosis.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="social-interaction">Social interaction</h3>

<p>The lack of demonstrated <a href="empathy" class="uri" title="wikilink">empathy</a> is possibly the most dysfunctional aspect of Asperger syndrome.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> Individuals with AS experience difficulties in basic elements of social interaction, which may include a failure to develop friendships or to seek shared enjoyments or achievements with others (for example, showing others objects of interest), a lack of social or emotional <a href="Reciprocity_(social_psychology)" title="wikilink">reciprocity</a>, and impaired <a href="Nonverbal_communication" title="wikilink">nonverbal behaviors</a> in areas such as <a href="eye_contact" title="wikilink">eye contact</a>, <a href="facial_expression" title="wikilink">facial expression</a>, posture, and gesture.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a></p>
<p>Unlike those with autism, people with AS are not usually withdrawn around others; they approach others, even if awkwardly. For example, a person with AS may engage in a one-sided, long-winded speech about a favorite topic, while misunderstanding or not recognizing the listener's feelings or reactions, such as a need for privacy or haste to leave.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> This social awkwardness has been called &quot;active but odd&quot;.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> This failure to react appropriately to social interaction may appear as disregard for other people's feelings, and may come across as insensitive.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a><br />
However, not all individuals with AS will approach others. Some of them may even display <a href="selective_mutism" title="wikilink">selective mutism</a>, speaking not at all to most people and excessively to specific people. Some may choose to talk only to people they like.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a></p>
<p>The cognitive ability of children with AS often allows them to articulate <a href="social_norms" title="wikilink">social norms</a> in a laboratory context,<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> where they may be able to show a theoretical understanding of other people's emotions; however, they typically have difficulty acting on this knowledge in fluid, real-life situations.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> People with AS may analyze and distill their observation of social interaction into rigid behavioral guidelines, and apply these rules in awkward ways, such as forced eye contact, resulting in a demeanor that appears rigid or socially naive. Childhood desire for companionship can become numbed through a history of failed social encounters.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a></p>
<p>The <a href="hypothesis" class="uri" title="wikilink">hypothesis</a> that individuals with AS are predisposed to violent or criminal behavior has been investigated but is not supported by data.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a><a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> More evidence suggests children with AS are victims rather than victimizers.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> A 2008 review found that an overwhelming number of reported violent criminals with AS had coexisting <a href="psychiatric_disorders" title="wikilink">psychiatric disorders</a> such as <a href="schizoaffective_disorder" title="wikilink">schizoaffective disorder</a>.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="restricted-and-repetitive-interests-and-behavior">Restricted and repetitive interests and behavior</h3>
<p>People with Asperger syndrome often display behavior, interests, and activities that are restricted and repetitive and are sometimes abnormally intense or focused. They may stick to inflexible routines, move in <a href="Stereotypy" title="wikilink">stereotyped</a> and repetitive ways, or preoccupy themselves with parts of objects.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a></p>
<p>Pursuit of specific and narrow areas of interest is one of the most striking features of AS.<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> Individuals with AS may collect volumes of detailed information on a relatively narrow topic such as weather data or star names, without necessarily having genuine understanding of the broader topic.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a><a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a> For example, a child might memorize camera model numbers while caring little about photography.<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a> This behavior is usually apparent by grade school, typically age 5 or 6 in the United States.<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a> Although these special interests may change from time to time, they typically become more unusual and narrowly focused, and often dominate social interaction so much that the entire family may become immersed. Because narrow topics often capture the interest of children, this symptom may go unrecognized.<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a></p>
<p>Stereotyped and repetitive motor behaviors are a core part of the diagnosis of AS and other ASDs.<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a> They include hand movements such as flapping or twisting, and complex whole-body movements.<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a> These are typically repeated in longer bursts and look more voluntary or ritualistic than <a href="tic" title="wikilink">tics</a>, which are usually faster, less rhythmical and less often symmetrical.<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="speech-and-language">Speech and language</h3>
<p>Although individuals with Asperger syndrome acquire language skills without significant general delay and their speech typically lacks significant abnormalities, <a href="language_acquisition" title="wikilink">language acquisition</a> and use is often atypical.<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a> Abnormalities include <a href="verbosity" class="uri" title="wikilink">verbosity</a>, abrupt transitions, literal interpretations and miscomprehension of <a href="nuance" class="uri" title="wikilink">nuance</a>, use of <a href="metaphor" class="uri" title="wikilink">metaphor</a> meaningful only to the speaker, <a href="Auditory_processing_disorder" title="wikilink">auditory perception deficits</a>, unusually <a href="pedant" title="wikilink">pedantic</a>, <a href="Register_(linguistics)" title="wikilink">formal</a> or <a href="Idiosyncrasy#Psychiatry" title="wikilink">idiosyncratic</a> speech, and oddities in <a href="loudness" class="uri" title="wikilink">loudness</a>, <a href="Tone_(linguistics)" title="wikilink">pitch</a>, <a href="Intonation_(linguistics)" title="wikilink">intonation</a>, <a href="Prosody_(linguistics)" title="wikilink">prosody</a>, and <a href="rhythm" class="uri" title="wikilink">rhythm</a>.<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a></p>
<p>Three aspects of communication patterns are of clinical interest: poor <a href="Prosody_(linguistics)" title="wikilink">prosody</a>, tangential and circumstantial speech, and marked verbosity. Although <a href="inflection" class="uri" title="wikilink">inflection</a> and intonation may be less rigid or monotonic than in autism, people with AS often have a limited range of intonation: speech may be unusually fast, jerky or loud. Speech may convey a sense of <a href="Coherence_(linguistics)" title="wikilink">incoherence</a>; the conversational style often includes monologues about topics that bore the listener, fails to provide <a href="Context_(language_use)" title="wikilink">context</a> for comments, or fails to suppress internal thoughts. Individuals with AS may fail to monitor whether the listener is interested or engaged in the conversation. The speaker's conclusion or point may never be made, and attempts by the listener to elaborate on the speech's content or logic, or to shift to related topics, are often unsuccessful.<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a></p>
<p>Children with AS may have an unusually sophisticated vocabulary at a young age and have been colloquially called &quot;little professors&quot;, but have difficulty understanding <a href="figurative_language" title="wikilink">figurative language</a> and tend to use language literally.<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a> Children with AS appear to have particular weaknesses in areas of nonliteral language that include humor, irony, and teasing. Although individuals with AS usually understand the cognitive basis of <a href="humor" class="uri" title="wikilink">humor</a> they seem to lack understanding of the intent of humor to share enjoyment with others.<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a> Despite strong evidence of impaired humor appreciation, anecdotal reports of humor in individuals with AS seem to challenge some psychological theories of AS and autism.<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="other">Other</h3>
<p>Individuals with Asperger syndrome may have signs or symptoms that are independent of the diagnosis, but can affect the individual or the family.<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a> These include differences in perception and problems with motor skills, sleep, and emotions.</p>
<p>Individuals with AS often have excellent <a href="Auditory_perception" title="wikilink">auditory</a> and <a href="visual_perception" title="wikilink">visual perception</a>.<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a> Children with ASD often demonstrate enhanced perception of small changes in patterns such as arrangements of objects or well-known images; typically this is domain-specific and involves processing of fine-grained features.<a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a> Conversely, compared to individuals with high-functioning autism, individuals with AS have deficits in some tasks involving visual-spatial perception, auditory perception, or <a href="visual_memory" title="wikilink">visual memory</a>.<a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a> Many accounts of individuals with AS and ASD report other unusual sensory and perceptual skills and experiences. They may be unusually sensitive or insensitive to sound, light, and other stimuli;<a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a> these sensory responses are found in other developmental disorders and are not specific to AS or to ASD. There is little support for increased <a href="fight-or-flight_response" title="wikilink">fight-or-flight response</a> or failure of <a href="habituation" class="uri" title="wikilink">habituation</a> in autism; there is more evidence of decreased responsiveness to sensory stimuli, although several studies show no differences.<a href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a></p>
<p>Hans Asperger's initial accounts<a href="#fn67" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a> and other diagnostic schemes<a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a> include descriptions of physical clumsiness. Children with AS may be delayed in acquiring skills requiring motor dexterity, such as riding a bicycle or opening a jar, and may seem to move awkwardly or feel &quot;uncomfortable in their own skin&quot;. They may be poorly coordinated, or have an odd or bouncy gait or posture, poor handwriting, or problems with visual-motor integration.<a href="#fn69" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref69"><sup>69</sup></a><a href="#fn70" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a> They may show problems with <a href="proprioception" class="uri" title="wikilink">proprioception</a> (sensation of body position) on measures of <a href="apraxia" class="uri" title="wikilink">apraxia</a> (motor planning disorder), balance, <a href="tandem_gait" title="wikilink">tandem gait</a>, and finger-thumb apposition. There is no evidence that these motor skills problems differentiate AS from other high-functioning ASDs.<a href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a></p>
<p>Children with AS are more likely to have sleep problems, including difficulty in falling asleep, frequent <a href="middle-of-the-night_insomnia" title="wikilink">nocturnal awakenings</a>, and early morning awakenings.<a href="#fn72" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref72"><sup>72</sup></a><a href="#fn73" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref73"><sup>73</sup></a> AS is also associated with high levels of <a href="alexithymia" class="uri" title="wikilink">alexithymia</a>, which is difficulty in identifying and describing one's emotions.<ref>Alexithymia and AS:</p>

</ul>
<p>As with other forms of ASD, parents of children with AS have higher levels of stress.<a href="#fn75" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref75"><sup>75</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="causes">Causes</h2>

<p>Hans Asperger described common symptoms among his patients' family members, especially fathers, and research supports this observation and suggests a genetic contribution to Asperger syndrome. Although no specific gene has yet been identified, multiple factors are believed to play a role in the <a href="Expressivity" title="wikilink">expression</a> of autism, given the <a href="phenotype" title="wikilink">phenotypic</a> variability seen in children with AS.<a href="#fn76" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref76"><sup>76</sup></a><a href="#fn77" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref77"><sup>77</sup></a> Evidence for a genetic link is the tendency for AS to run in families and an observed higher <a href="Incidence_(epidemiology)" title="wikilink">incidence</a> of family members who have behavioral symptoms similar to AS but in a more limited form (for example, slight difficulties with social interaction, language, or reading).<a href="#fn78" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref78"><sup>78</sup></a> Most research suggests that all <a href="Heritability_of_autism" title="wikilink">autism spectrum disorders have shared genetic mechanisms</a>, but AS may have a stronger genetic component than autism.<a href="#fn79" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref79"><sup>79</sup></a> There is probably a common group of genes where particular <a href="allele" title="wikilink">alleles</a> render an individual vulnerable to developing AS; if this is the case, the particular combination of alleles would determine the severity and symptoms for each individual with AS.<a href="#fn80" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref80"><sup>80</sup></a></p>
<p>A few ASD cases have been linked to exposure to <a href="teratogen" title="wikilink">teratogens</a> (agents that cause <a href="birth_defect" title="wikilink">birth defects</a>) during the first eight weeks from <a href="Human_fertilization" title="wikilink">conception</a>. Although this does not exclude the possibility that ASD can be initiated or affected later, it is strong evidence that it arises very early in development.<a href="#fn81" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref81"><sup>81</sup></a> Many <a href="environmental_factors" title="wikilink">environmental factors</a> have been hypothesized to act after birth, but none has been confirmed by scientific investigation.<a href="#fn82" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref82"><sup>82</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="mechanism">Mechanism</h2>

<p>Asperger syndrome appears to result from developmental factors that affect many or all functional brain systems, as opposed to localized effects.<a href="#fn83" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref83"><sup>83</sup></a> Although the specific underpinnings of AS or factors that distinguish it from other ASDs are unknown, and no clear pathology common to individuals with AS has emerged,<a href="#fn84" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref84"><sup>84</sup></a> it is still possible that AS's mechanism is separate from other ASD.<a href="#fn85" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref85"><sup>85</sup></a> <a href="Neuroanatomy" title="wikilink">Neuroanatomical</a> studies and the associations with <a href="Teratology" title="wikilink">teratogens</a> strongly suggest that the mechanism includes alteration of brain development soon after conception.<a href="#fn86" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref86"><sup>86</sup></a> Abnormal migration of embryonic cells during <a href="fetal_development" title="wikilink">fetal development</a> may affect the final structure and connectivity of the brain, resulting in alterations in the neural circuits that control thought and behavior.<a href="#fn87" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref87"><sup>87</sup></a> Several theories of mechanism are available; none is likely to provide a complete explanation.<a href="#fn88" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref88"><sup>88</sup></a></p>
<p><img src="FMRI.jpg" title="fig:Functional magnetic resonance imaging provides some evidence for both underconnectivity and mirror neuron theories." alt="Functional magnetic resonance imaging provides some evidence for both underconnectivity and mirror neuron theories." /> The underconnectivity theory hypothesizes underfunctioning high-level neural connections and synchronization, along with an excess of low-level processes.<a href="#fn89" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref89"><sup>89</sup></a> It maps well to general-processing theories such as <a href="weak_central_coherence_theory" title="wikilink">weak central coherence theory</a>, which hypothesizes that a limited ability to see the big picture underlies the central disturbance in ASD.<a href="#fn90" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref90"><sup>90</sup></a> A related theory&lt;U+2014&gt;enhanced perceptual functioning&lt;U+2014&gt;focuses more on the superiority of locally oriented and <a href="perceptual" class="uri" title="wikilink">perceptual</a> operations in autistic individuals.<a href="#fn91" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref91"><sup>91</sup></a></p>
<p>The <a href="Mirror_neuron" title="wikilink">mirror neuron system</a> (MNS) theory hypothesizes that alterations to the development of the MNS interfere with imitation and lead to Asperger's core feature of social impairment.<a href="#fn92" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref92"><sup>92</sup></a><a href="#fn93" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref93"><sup>93</sup></a> For example, one study found that activation is delayed in the core circuit for imitation in individuals with AS.<a href="#fn94" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref94"><sup>94</sup></a> This theory maps well to <a href="social_cognition" title="wikilink">social cognition</a> theories like the <a href="theory_of_mind" title="wikilink">theory of mind</a>, which hypothesizes that autistic behavior arises from impairments in ascribing mental states to oneself and others,<a href="#fn95" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref95"><sup>95</sup></a> or <a href="EQ_SQ_theory" title="wikilink">hyper-systemizing</a>, which hypothesizes that autistic individuals can systematize internal operation to handle internal events but are less effective at <a href="Empathy" title="wikilink">empathizing</a> by handling events generated by other agents.<a href="#fn96" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref96"><sup>96</sup></a></p>

<p><a href="Lorna_Wing" title="wikilink">Lorna Wing</a> popularized the term <em>Asperger syndrome</em> in the English-speaking medical community in her 1981 publication<a href="#fn204" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref204"><sup>204</sup></a> of a series of case studies of children showing similar symptoms,<a href="#fn205" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref205"><sup>205</sup></a> and <a href="Uta_Frith" title="wikilink">Uta Frith</a> translated Asperger's paper to English in 1991.<a href="#fn206" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref206"><sup>206</sup></a> Sets of diagnostic criteria were outlined by Gillberg and Gillberg in 1989 and by Szatmari <em>et al.</em> in the same year.<a href="#fn207" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref207"><sup>207</sup></a> AS became a standard diagnosis in 1992, when it was included in the tenth edition of the <a href="World_Health_Organization" title="wikilink">World Health Organization</a>'s diagnostic manual, <em>International Classification of Diseases</em> (<a href="ICD-10" class="uri" title="wikilink">ICD-10</a>); in 1994, it was added to the fourth edition of the <a href="American_Psychiatric_Association" title="wikilink">American Psychiatric Association</a>'s diagnostic reference, <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</em> (<a href="DSM-IV" class="uri" title="wikilink">DSM-IV</a>).<a href="#fn208" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref208"><sup>208</sup></a></p>

<h2 id="cultural-aspects">Cultural aspects</h2>

<p>People with Asperger syndrome may refer to themselves in casual conversation as <em>aspies</em>, coined by <a href="Liane_Holliday_Willey" title="wikilink">Liane Holliday Willey</a> in 1999.<a href="#fn212" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref212"><sup>212</sup></a> The word <em><a href="neurotypical" class="uri" title="wikilink">neurotypical</a></em> (abbreviated <em>NT</em>) describes a person whose neurological development and state are typical, and is often used to refer to non-autistic people. The <a href="Internet" class="uri" title="wikilink">Internet</a> has allowed individuals with AS to communicate and <a href="Autistic_Pride_Day" title="wikilink">celebrate</a> with each other in a way that was not previously possible because of their rarity and geographic dispersal. A <a href="Sociological_and_cultural_aspects_of_autism" title="wikilink">subculture of aspies</a> has formed. Internet sites like <a href="Wrong_Planet" title="wikilink">Wrong Planet</a> have made it easier for individuals to connect.<a href="#fn213" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref213"><sup>213</sup></a></p>
<p>Autistic people have advocated a shift in perception of autism spectrum disorders as complex <a href="syndrome" title="wikilink">syndromes</a> rather than diseases that must be cured. Proponents of this view reject the notion that there is an &quot;ideal&quot; brain configuration and that any deviation from the norm is <a href="Anatomical_pathology" title="wikilink">pathological</a>; they promote tolerance for what they call <a href="neurodiversity" class="uri" title="wikilink">neurodiversity</a>.<a href="#fn214" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref214"><sup>214</sup></a> These views are the basis for the <a href="Autism_rights_movement" title="wikilink">autistic rights</a> and <a href="Sociological_and_cultural_aspects_of_autism#Autistic_pride" title="wikilink">autistic pride</a> movements.<a href="#fn215" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref215"><sup>215</sup></a> There is a contrast between the attitude of adults with self-identified AS, who typically do not want to be cured and are proud of their identity, and parents of children with AS, who typically seek assistance and a cure for their children.<a href="#fn216" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref216"><sup>216</sup></a></p>
<p>Some researchers have argued that AS can be viewed as a different cognitive style, not a disorder or a disability,<a href="#fn217" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref217"><sup>217</sup></a> and that it should be removed from the standard <em><a href="Diagnostic_and_Statistical_Manual" title="wikilink">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual</a></em>, much as <a href="homosexuality" class="uri" title="wikilink">homosexuality</a> was removed.<a href="#fn218" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref218"><sup>218</sup></a> In a 2002 paper, <a href="Simon_Baron-Cohen" title="wikilink">Simon Baron-Cohen</a> wrote of those with AS, &quot;In the social world there is no great benefit to a precise eye for detail, but in the worlds of maths, computing, cataloguing, music, linguistics, engineering, and science, such an eye for detail can lead to success rather than failure.&quot; Baron-Cohen cited two reasons why it might still be useful to consider AS to be a disability: to ensure provision for legally required special support, and to recognize emotional difficulties from reduced empathy.<a href="#fn219" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref219"><sup>219</sup></a> It has been argued that the genes for Asperger's combination of abilities have operated throughout recent <a href="human_evolution" title="wikilink">human evolution</a> and have made remarkable contributions to human history.<a href="#fn220" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref220"><sup>220</sup></a></p>
