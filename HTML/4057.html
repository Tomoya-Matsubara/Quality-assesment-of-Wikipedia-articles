<p><strong>John Marshall Harlan</strong> (May 20, 1899 &lt;U+2013&gt; December 29, 1971) was an American jurist who served as an <a href="Associate_Justice_of_the_United_States_Supreme_Court" title="wikilink">Associate Justice</a> of the <a href="Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States" title="wikilink">Supreme Court</a> from 1955 to 1971. His namesake was his grandfather <a href="John_Marshall_Harlan" title="wikilink">John Marshall Harlan</a>, another associate justice who served from 1877 to 1911.</p>
<p>Harlan was a student at <a href="Upper_Canada_College" title="wikilink">Upper Canada College</a> and <a href="Appleby_College" title="wikilink">Appleby College</a> and then at <a href="Princeton_University" title="wikilink">Princeton University</a>.

Later he served as Assistant <a href="U.S._Attorney_for_the_Southern_District_of_New_York" title="wikilink">U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York</a> and as Special Assistant Attorney General of New York. In 1954 Harlan was appointed to the <a href="United_States_Court_of_Appeals_for_the_Second_Circuit" title="wikilink">United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit</a>, and a year later president <a href="Dwight_Eisenhower" title="wikilink">Dwight Eisenhower</a> nominated Harlan to the United States Supreme Court following the death of Justice <a href="Robert_H._Jackson" title="wikilink">Robert H.

<p>Harlan is often characterized as a member of the conservative wing of the <a href="Earl_Warren" title="wikilink">Warren Court</a>. He advocated a limited role for the judiciary, remarking that the Supreme Court should not be considered &quot;a general haven for reform movements&quot;.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> In general, Harlan adhered more closely to <a href="precedent" class="uri" title="wikilink">precedent</a>, and was more reluctant to overturn legislation, than many of his colleagues on the Court.

At the firm, he served as chief assistant for senior partner <a href="Emory_Buckner" title="wikilink">Emory Buckner</a> and followed him into public service when Buckner was appointed United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York. As one of &quot;Buckner's Boy Scouts&quot;, eager young Assistant United States Attorneys, Harlan worked on Prohibition cases, and swore off drinking except when the prosecutors visited the Harlan family fishing camp in <a href="Quebec" class="uri" title="wikilink">Quebec</a>, where Prohibition did not apply.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> Harlan remained in public service until 1930, and then returned to his firm.

<p>As a trial lawyer Harlan was involved in a number of famous cases.

However a number of claimants, filed suits in state and federal courts demanding a part of her fortune. Most of the claimants were imposters; Harlan acted as the main defender of her estate and will as well as the chief negotiator. Eventually a settlement among lawful claimants was reached in 1933.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> In the following years Harlan specialized in corporate law dealing with the cases like <em>Randall v.

<p>In 1937, Harlan was one of five founders of the controversial <a href="Pioneer_Fund" title="wikilink">Pioneer Fund</a>, a group associated with <a href="eugenics" class="uri" title="wikilink">eugenics</a> advocacy, and served on its board for long time. He, however, never played any significant role in the fund.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a></p>
<p>During World War II, Harlan volunteered for military duty, serving as a <a href="colonel" class="uri" title="wikilink">colonel</a> in the <a href="United_States_Air_Force" title="wikilink">United States Army Air Force</a> from 1943 to 1945.

<h2 id="supreme-court-career">Supreme Court career</h2>
<p>On January 13, 1954, United States President <a href="Dwight_D._Eisenhower" title="wikilink">Dwight D.

He was confirmed by the <a href="United_States_Senate" title="wikilink">United States Senate</a> on February 9, and took office on February 10.<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a> Harlan knew this court well, as he had often appeared before it and was friendly with many of the judges.<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a> However, his stay on the court only lasted for a year. On January 10, 1955, President Eisenhower nominated Harlan to the United States Supreme Court following the death of Justice <a href="Robert_H._Jackson" title="wikilink">Robert H. Jackson</a>.<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a> On being nominated, the reticent Harlan called reporters into his chambers in New York, and stated, in full, &quot;I am very deeply honored.&quot;<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a> Despite the brevity of his stay on the Second Circuit, Harlan would serve as the <a href="Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States#Justices_as_Circuit_Justices" title="wikilink">Circuit Justice</a> responsible for the Second Circuit throughout his Supreme Court capacity, and, in that capacity, would enjoyably attend the Circuit's annual conference, bringing his wife and catching up on the latest gossip.<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a></p>
<p><img src="John_Marshall_Harlan_II.jpg" title="fig:Portrait of Harlan" alt="Portrait of Harlan" /> Harlan's nomination came shortly after the Supreme Court handed down its landmark decision in <em><a href="http://supreme.justia.com/us/347/483/case.html">Brown v. Board of Education</a></em>,<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a> declaring segregation in public schools unconstitutional. Chairman of the <a href="United_States_Senate_Committee_on_the_Judiciary" title="wikilink">United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary</a>, James Eastland, and several southern senators delayed his confirmation, because they (correctly) believed that he would support desegregation of the schools and <a href="civil_rights" title="wikilink">civil rights</a>.<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a> Unlike almost all previous Supreme Court nominees, Harlan appeared before the Senate Judiciary Committee to answer questions relating to his judicial views. Every Supreme Court nominee since Harlan has been questioned by the Judiciary Committee before confirmation.<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a> The Senate finally confirmed him on March 17, 1955 by a vote of 71&lt;U+2013&gt;11.<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a> He took seat on March 28, 1955.<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a> Of the eleven senators who voted against his appointment, nine were from the South.

<p>On the Supreme Court, Harlan often voted alongside Justice <a href="Felix_Frankfurter" title="wikilink">Felix Frankfurter</a>,<a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a> who was his principal mentor on the court.<a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a> Some legal scholars even viewed him as &quot;Frankfurter without mustard&quot;, though others recognize his own important contributions to the evolution of the legal thought.<a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a> Harlan was an ideological adversary&lt;U+2014&gt;but close personal friend&lt;U+2014&gt;of Justice <a href="Hugo_Black" title="wikilink">Hugo Black</a>,<a href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a> with whom he disagreed on a variety of issues, including the applicability of the Bill of Rights to the states, the Due Process Clause, and the <a href="Equal_Protection_Clause" title="wikilink">Equal Protection Clause</a>.<a href="#fn67" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a></p>
<p>Justice Harlan was very close to the <a href="law_clerks" title="wikilink">law clerks</a> whom he hired, and continued to take an interest in them after they left his chambers to continue their legal careers. The justice would advise them on their careers, hold annual reunions, and place pictures of their children on his chambers' walls. He would say to them of the Warren Court, &quot;We must consider this only temporary,&quot; that the Court had gone astray, but would soon right itself.<a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a></p>
<p>Justice Harlan is remembered by people, who worked with him, for his tolerance and civility. He treated his fellow Justices, clerks and attorneys representing parties with respect and consideration. While Justice Harlan often strongly objected to certain conclusions and arguments, he never criticized other justices or anybody else personally, and never said any disparaging words about someone's motivations and capacity.<a href="#fn69" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref69"><sup>69</sup></a> Harlan was reluctant to show emotion, and was never heard to complain about anything.<a href="#fn70" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a> Harlan was one of the intellectual leaders of the Warren Court. Harvard Constitutional law expert <a href="Paul_Freund" title="wikilink">Paul Freund</a> said of him:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>His thinking threw light in a very introspective way on the entire process of the judicial function. His decisions, beyond just the vote they represented, were sufficiently philosophical to be of enduring interest. He decided the case before him with that respect for its particulars, its special features, that marks alike the honest artist and the just judge.<a href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="jurisprudence">Jurisprudence</h2>
<p>Harlan's jurisprudence is often characterized as conservative. He held <a href="precedent" class="uri" title="wikilink">precedent</a> to be of great importance, adhering to the principle of <em><a href="stare_decisis" title="wikilink">stare decisis</a></em> more closely than many of his Supreme Court colleagues.<a href="#fn72" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref72"><sup>72</sup></a> Unlike Justice Black, he eschewed strict <a href="textualism" class="uri" title="wikilink">textualism</a>. While he believed that the original intention of the Framers should play an important part in constitutional adjudication, he also held that broad phrases like &quot;liberty&quot; in the Due Process Clause could be given an evolving interpretation.<a href="#fn73" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref73"><sup>73</sup></a></p>
<p>Harlan believed that most problems should be solved by the <a href="political_process" title="wikilink">political process</a>, and that the judiciary should play only a limited role.<a href="#fn74" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref74"><sup>74</sup></a> In his dissent to <em><a href="Reynolds_v._Sims" title="wikilink">Reynolds v. Sims</a></em>,<a href="#fn75" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref75"><sup>75</sup></a> he wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>These decisions give support to a current mistaken view of the Constitution and the constitutional function of this court. This view, in short, is that every major social ill in this country can find its cure in some constitutional principle and that this court should take the lead in promoting reform when other branches of government fail to act. The Constitution is not a panacea for every blot upon the public welfare nor should this court, ordained as a judicial body, be thought of as a general haven of reform movements.<a href="#fn76" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref76"><sup>76</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="equal-protection-clause">Equal Protection Clause</h3>
<p>The Supreme Court decided several important equal protection cases during the first years of Harlan's career. In these cases, Harlan regularly voted in favor of civil rights&lt;U+2014&gt;similar to his grandfather, the only dissenting justice in the infamous <em><a href="Plessy_v._Ferguson" title="wikilink">Plessy v. Ferguson</a></em> case.<a href="#fn77" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref77"><sup>77</sup></a></p>

Moreover, he joined the unanimous decision in <em><a href="Loving_v._Virginia" title="wikilink">Loving v.

<h3 id="due-process-clause">Due Process Clause</h3>
<p>Justice Harlan advocated a broad interpretation of the <a href="Fourteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution" title="wikilink">Fourteenth Amendment</a>'s Due Process Clause. He subscribed to the doctrine that the clause not only provided procedural guarantees, but also protected a wide range of fundamental rights, including those that were not specifically mentioned in the text of the Constitution.<a href="#fn81" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref81"><sup>81</sup></a> (See <a href="Due_process#Substantive_due_process" title="wikilink">substantive due process</a>.)

East Cleveland</a></em>, &quot;no one was more sensitive than Mr. Justice Harlan to any suggestion that his approach to the Due Process Clause would lead to judges 'roaming at large in the constitutional field.'&quot;<a href="#fn82" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref82"><sup>82</sup></a> Under Harlan's approach, judges would be limited in the Due Process area by &quot;respect for the teachings of history, solid recognition of the basic values that underlie our society, and wise appreciation of the great roles that the doctrines of <a href="federalism" class="uri" title="wikilink">federalism</a> and <a href="separation_of_powers" title="wikilink">separation of powers</a> have played in establishing and preserving American freedoms.&quot;<a href="#fn83" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref83"><sup>83</sup></a></p>
<p>Harlan set forth his interpretation in an often cited dissenting opinion to <em><a href="Poe_v._Ullman" title="wikilink">Poe v. Ullman</a></em>,<a href="#fn84" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref84"><sup>84</sup></a> which involved a challenge to a <a href="Connecticut" class="uri" title="wikilink">Connecticut</a> law banning the use of <a href="contraceptive" title="wikilink">contraceptives</a>. The Supreme Court dismissed the case on technical grounds, holding that the case was not <a href="ripeness" title="wikilink">ripe</a> for adjudication. Justice Harlan dissented from the dismissal, suggesting that the Court should have considered the merits of the case. Thereafter, he indicated his support for a broad view of the due process clause's reference to &quot;liberty.&quot; He wrote, &quot;This 'liberty' is not a series of isolated points pricked out in terms of the taking of property; the freedom of speech, press, and religion; the <a href="right_to_keep_and_bear_arms" title="wikilink">right to keep and bear arms</a>; the freedom from unreasonable <a href="searches_and_seizures" title="wikilink">searches and seizures</a>; and so on. It is a rational continuum which, broadly speaking, includes a freedom from all substantial arbitrary <a href="impositions" class="uri" title="wikilink">impositions</a> and purposeless <a href="Prior_restraint" title="wikilink">restraints</a>.&quot;<a href="#fn85" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref85"><sup>85</sup></a> He suggested that the due process clause encompassed a right to privacy, and concluded that a prohibition on contraception violated this right.<a href="#fn86" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref86"><sup>86</sup></a></p>
<p>The same law was challenged again in <em><a href="Griswold_v._Connecticut" title="wikilink">Griswold v. Connecticut</a></em>.<a href="#fn87" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref87"><sup>87</sup></a> This time, the Supreme Court agreed to consider the case, and concluded that the law violated the Constitution. However, the decision was based not on the due process clause, but on the argument that a right to privacy was found in the &quot;<a href="penumbra" title="wikilink">penumbras</a>&quot; of other provisions of the Bill of Rights. Justice Harlan concurred in the result, but criticized the Court for relying on the Bill of Rights in reaching its decision. &quot;The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment stands,&quot; he wrote, &quot;on its own bottom.&quot;<a href="#fn88" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref88"><sup>88</sup></a> The Supreme Court would later adopt Harlan's approach, relying on the due process clause rather than the penumbras of the Bill of Rights in right to privacy cases such as <em><a href="Roe_v._Wade" title="wikilink">Roe v. Wade</a></em><a href="#fn89" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref89"><sup>89</sup></a> and <em><a href="Lawrence_v._Texas" title="wikilink">Lawrence v. Texas</a></em>.<a href="#fn90" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref90"><sup>90</sup></a></p>
<p>Harlan's interpretation of the Due Process Clause attracted the criticism of Justice Black, who rejected the idea that the Clause included a &quot;substantive&quot; component, considering this interpretation unjustifiably broad and historically unsound. The Supreme Court has agreed with Harlan, and has continued to apply the doctrine of substantive due process in a wide variety of cases.<a href="#fn91" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref91"><sup>91</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="incorporation">Incorporation</h3>

<p>Justice Harlan was strongly opposed to the theory that the Fourteenth Amendment &quot;incorporated&quot; the Bill of Rights&lt;U+2014&gt;that is, made the provisions of the Bill of Rights applicable to the states.<a href="#fn92" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref92"><sup>92</sup></a> His opinion on the matter was opposite to that of his grandfather, who supported the full incorporation of the Bill of Rights.<a href="#fn93" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref93"><sup>93</sup></a> When it was originally ratified, the Bill of Rights was binding only upon the federal government, as the Supreme Court ruled in the 1833 <em><a href="Barron_v._Baltimore" title="wikilink">Barron v. Baltimore</a></em>.<a href="#fn94" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref94"><sup>94</sup></a> Some jurists argued that the Fourteenth Amendment made the entirety of the Bill of Rights binding upon the states as well. Harlan, however, rejected this doctrine, which he called &quot;historically unfounded&quot; in his <em>Griswold</em> concurrence.<a href="#fn95" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref95"><sup>95</sup></a></p>
<p>Instead, Justice Harlan believed that the Fourteenth Amendment's due process clause only protected &quot;fundamental&quot; rights. Thus, if a guarantee of the Bill of Rights was &quot;fundamental&quot; or &quot;implicit in the concept of ordered liberty,&quot; Harlan agreed that it applied to the states as well as the federal government.<a href="#fn96" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref96"><sup>96</sup></a> Thus, for example, Harlan believed that the <a href="First_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution" title="wikilink">First Amendment</a>'s <a href="free_speech" title="wikilink">free speech</a> clause applied to the states,<a href="#fn97" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref97"><sup>97</sup></a> but that the <a href="Fifth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution" title="wikilink">Fifth Amendment</a>'s self incrimination clause did not.<a href="#fn98" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref98"><sup>98</sup></a></p>
<p>Harlan's approach was largely similar to that of Justices <a href="Benjamin_Cardozo" title="wikilink">Benjamin Cardozo</a> and <a href="Felix_Frankfurter" title="wikilink">Felix Frankfurter</a>.<a href="#fn99" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref99"><sup>99</sup></a> It drew criticism from Justice Black, a proponent of the total incorporation theory.<a href="#fn100" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref100"><sup>100</sup></a> Black claimed that the process of identifying some rights as more &quot;fundamental&quot; than others was largely arbitrary, and depended on each Justice's personal opinions.<a href="#fn101" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref101"><sup>101</sup></a></p>
<p>The Supreme Court has eventually adopted some elements of Harlan's approach, holding that only some Bill of Rights guarantees were applicable against the states&lt;U+2014&gt;the doctrine known as selective incorporation. However, under Chief Justice Earl Warren during the 1960s, an increasing number of rights were deemed sufficiently fundamental for incorporation. (Harlan regularly dissented from these rulings.) Hence, majority of provisions of the Bill of Rights have been extended to the states; the exceptions are the <a href="Third_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution" title="wikilink">Third Amendment</a>, the grand jury clause of the Fifth Amendment, the <a href="Seventh_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution" title="wikilink">Seventh Amendment</a>, the excessive bail provision of the Eighth Amendment, the <a href="Ninth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution" title="wikilink">Ninth Amendment</a>, and the <a href="Tenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution" title="wikilink">Tenth Amendment</a>. Thus, although the Supreme Court has agreed with Harlan's general reasoning, the end result of its jurisprudence is very different from what Harlan advocated.<a href="#fn102" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref102"><sup>102</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="first-amendment">First Amendment</h3>
<p>Justice Harlan supported many of the Warren Court's landmark decisions relating to the <a href="separation_of_church_and_state" title="wikilink">separation of church and state</a>. For instance, he voted in favor of the Court's ruling that the states could not use religious tests as qualifications for public office in <em><a href="Torcaso_v._Watkins" title="wikilink">Torcaso v. Watkins</a></em>.<a href="#fn103" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref103"><sup>103</sup></a> He joined in <em><a href="Engel_v._Vitale" title="wikilink">Engel v. Vitale</a></em>,<a href="#fn104" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref104"><sup>104</sup></a> which declared that it was unconstitutional for states to require the recitation of official <a href="prayer_in_school" title="wikilink">prayers in public schools</a>. In <em><a href="http://supreme.justia.com/us/393/97/case.html#114">Epperson v.

<p>In many cases, Harlan took a fairly broad view of First Amendment rights such as the freedom of speech and of the press, although he thought that the First Amendment applied directly only to the federal government.<a href="#fn106" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref106"><sup>106</sup></a> According to Harlan the freedom of speech was among the &quot;fundamental principals of liberty and justice&quot; and therefore applicable also to states, but less stringently than to the national government. Moreover, Justice Harlan believed that federal laws censoring &quot;obscene&quot; publications violated the free speech clause.<a href="#fn107" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref107"><sup>107</sup></a> Thus, he dissented from <em><a href="Roth_v._United_States" title="wikilink">Roth v. United States</a></em>,<a href="#fn108" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref108"><sup>108</sup></a> in which the Supreme Court upheld the validity of a federal obscenity law. At the same time, Harlan did not believe that the Constitution prevented the states from censoring obscenity.<a href="#fn109" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref109"><sup>109</sup></a> He explained in his <em>Roth</em> dissent:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The danger is perhaps not great if the people of one State, through their legislature, decide that <em><a href="Lady_Chatterley&#39;s_Lover" title="wikilink">Lady Chatterley's Lover</a></em> goes so far beyond the acceptable standards of candor that it will be deemed offensive and non-sellable, for the State next door is still free to make its own choice. At least we do not have one uniform standard. But the dangers to free thought and expression are truly great if the Federal Government imposes a blanket ban over the Nation on such a book. [...] The fact that the people of one State cannot read some of the works of <a href="D._H._Lawrence" title="wikilink">D. H. Lawrence</a> seems to me, if not wise or desirable, at least acceptable. But that no person in the United States should be allowed to do so seems to me to be intolerable, and violative of both the letter and spirit of the First Amendment.<a href="#fn110" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref110"><sup>110</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Harlan concurred in <em><a href="New_York_Times_Co._v._Sullivan" title="wikilink">New York Times Co. v. Sullivan</a></em>,<a href="#fn111" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref111"><sup>111</sup></a> which required public officials suing newspapers for <a href="slander_and_libel" title="wikilink">libel</a> to prove that the publisher had acted with &quot;<a href="actual_malice" title="wikilink">actual malice</a>.&quot; This stringent standard made it much more difficult for public officials to win libel cases. He did not, however, go as far as Justices Hugo Black and <a href="William_O._Douglas" title="wikilink">William O. Douglas</a>, who suggested that all libel laws were unconstitutional. In <em>Street v. New York</em>,<a href="#fn112" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref112"><sup>112</sup></a> Harlan wrote the opinion of the court, ruling that the government could not punish an individual for insulting the <a href="American_flag" title="wikilink">American flag</a>. In 1969 he noted that the Supreme Court had consistently &quot;rejected all manner of prior restraint on publication.&quot;<a href="#fn113" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref113"><sup>113</sup></a></p>
<p>When Harlan was a Circuit Judge in 1955,<a href="#fn114" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref114"><sup>114</sup></a> he authorized the decision upholding conviction of leaders of the <a href="communist_party" title="wikilink">communist party</a> (including <a href="Elizabeth_Gurley_Flynn" title="wikilink">Elizabeth Gurley Flynn</a>) under the <a href="Smith_Act" title="wikilink">Smith Act</a>.

<p>During the 1960s the Warren Court made a series of rulings expanding the rights of criminal <a href="defendant" title="wikilink">defendants</a>. In some instances, Justice Harlan concurred in the result,<a href="#fn126" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref126"><sup>126</sup></a> while in many other cases he found himself in dissent.

<h3 id="voting-rights">Voting rights</h3>

<p>Justice Harlan rejected the theory that the Constitution enshrined the so-called &quot;<a href="one_man,_one_vote" title="wikilink">one man, one vote</a>&quot; principle, or the principle that legislative districts must be roughly equal in population.<a href="#fn137" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref137"><sup>137</sup></a> In this regard, he shared the views of Justice Felix Frankfurter, who in <em><a href="Colegrove_v._Green" title="wikilink">Colegrove v.

The Supreme Court, however, disagreed with Harlan in a series of rulings during the 1960s. The first case in this line of rulings was <em><a href="http://supreme.justia.com/us/369/186/case.html#266">Baker v.

Harlan vigorously dissented, writing, &quot;I had not expected to witness the day when the Supreme Court of the United States would render a decision which casts grave doubt on the constitutionality of the composition of the House of Representatives. It is not an exaggeration to say that such is the effect of today's decision.&quot;<a href="#fn142" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref142"><sup>142</sup></a> He proceeded to argue that the Court's decision was inconsistent with both the history and text of the Constitution; moreover, he claimed that only Congress, not the judiciary, had the power to require congressional districts with equal populations.<a href="#fn143" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref143"><sup>143</sup></a></p>

He suggested, in addition, that the problem of malapportionment was one that should be solved by the political process, and not by litigation. He wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This Court, limited in function in accordance with that premise, does not serve its high purpose when it exceeds its authority, even to satisfy justified impatience with the slow workings of the political process.
