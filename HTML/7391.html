<p>As a young artist in 1920s <a href="London" class="uri" title="wikilink">London</a>, he painted models who came to be known as 'The Petman Girls', serialized in <a href="The_Illustrated_London_News" title="wikilink">The Illustrated London News</a>, <a href="The_Sketch" title="wikilink">The Sketch</a> and <a href="Bystander_(magazine)" title="wikilink">Bystander (magazine)</a>. The drawings were considered risque in a prudish post-Edwardian era, and could be considered as precursors to the modern 'Page 3 Girls' of The Sun Newspaper of today.</p>
<p>These drawings clearly reflect his trademark long necks in all his models, and was to become his signature in later works.</p>
<p>Prints of these drawings are classified as vintage erotica, and can be purchased off the web. It is unclear where the original artworks reside, but, by any standard they remain highly collectible, signifying a rare genre of its time.</p>
<p>Copies of these pastel drawings can be searched and viewed at the Mary Evans Picture Library<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>

<p>Hal Bevan-Petman painted many landscapes during this era and on one occasion was commissioned by the India Tourism Office for a 'See India' poster.

This included the <a href="Nawab_of_Bahawalpur" title="wikilink">Nawab of Bahawalpur</a>, who corresponded with Hal on a regular basis. Such commissions have remained very private,elusive and very rarely displayed.</p>

<p>During his time in <a href="Pakistan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Pakistan</a> he painted practically every notable personality and/or their spouses, ranging from <a href="Mohammad_Ali_Jinnah" title="wikilink">Mohammad Ali Jinnah</a>, the founder of Pakistan, various subsequent Presidents and Military Commanders.

<h2 id="death">Death</h2>

<h2 id="art">Art</h2>
<p>He is known to have built a considerable reputation in the art scene and was commissioned by the <a href="Pakistan_Army" title="wikilink">Pakistan Army</a> to paint many Generals, Commanders and Battle Scenes. Most of the portraits are held in Private Collections, and many adorn various Pakistan Army's Educational Institutions, Messes and Regimental Headquarters. The Ladies portraits of various socialites and influential personalities are considered romanticized renditions with almost hazily surreal backgrounds.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> Queen Elizabeth II was presented four paintings by the Government of Pakistan in 1961. These paintings are on display at <a href="Sandringham_House" title="wikilink">Sandringham House</a> and are part of the Royal Collection.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<p>According to an article published in The News by Chris Cork,<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> who in his article remarked, &quot;He was a quick painter, three or four sittings and the work was done. Looking at his pictures today they are almost ephemeral. Not for him the heavy brushstroke but instead a hint of a smile, a slightly raised and querulent eyebrow and those Petman eyes, all so different but identifiably Petman eyes no matter who they belonged to in the first place.&quot;</p>
<h2 id="documentary">Documentary</h2>
<p>Given the limited credit he received after his demise within the art circles in <a href="Pakistan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Pakistan</a>, several private collectors and enthusiasts are now gathering momentum to celebrate the art of Hal Bevan-Petman. A privately funded documentary project was incepted to produce a snapshot of the artist, his work, and features some of his models giving their views on the experience they had with him whilst being painted. A preview of the production, called 'Discovering Petman', can by viewed on Vimeo.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> The documentary is directed by Taqi Shaheen, with research by Romano Karim Yusuf. The documentary in rough cut was premiered at Kuch Khaas on 4 September 2012, receiving positive reviews. Kuch Khaas,<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> is a non-profit organization promoting local art, artists and literary events in <a href="Islamabad" class="uri" title="wikilink">Islamabad</a>. This rough cut also featured in 'Migration Stories', a British Council Pakistan roadshow in 2013.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a><a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="book">Book</h2>
