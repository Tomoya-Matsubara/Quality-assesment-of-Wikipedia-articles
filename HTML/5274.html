<p><strong>George Harrison</strong>,  (25 February 1943 &lt;U+2013&gt; 29 November 2001) was an English musician, singer, and songwriter who achieved international fame as the lead guitarist of <a href="the_Beatles" title="wikilink">the Beatles</a>. <a href="Lennon&lt;U+2013&gt;McCartney" title="wikilink">John Lennon and Paul McCartney</a> were the band's primary songwriters, but most of their albums included at least one Harrison composition, including &quot;<a href="While_My_Guitar_Gently_Weeps" title="wikilink">While My Guitar Gently Weeps</a>&quot;, &quot;<a href="Here_Comes_the_Sun" title="wikilink">Here Comes the Sun</a>&quot; and &quot;<a href="Something" class="uri" title="wikilink">Something</a>&quot;, the Beatles' second <a href="cover_version" title="wikilink">most-covered</a> song.</p>
<p>Harrison's earliest musical influences included <a href="George_Formby" title="wikilink">George Formby</a>, <a href="Django_Reinhardt" title="wikilink">Django Reinhardt</a> and <a href="Big_Bill_Broonzy" title="wikilink">Big Bill Broonzy</a>; <a href="Chet_Atkins" title="wikilink">Chet Atkins</a>, <a href="Chuck_Berry" title="wikilink">Chuck Berry</a> and <a href="Ry_Cooder" title="wikilink">Ry Cooder</a> were significant later influences. By 1965 Harrison had begun to lead the other Beatles into <a href="folk_rock" title="wikilink">folk rock</a> through his interest in <a href="the_Byrds" title="wikilink">the Byrds</a> and <a href="Bob_Dylan" title="wikilink">Bob Dylan</a>, and towards <a href="Indian_classical_music" title="wikilink">Indian classical music</a> through his use of the <a href="sitar" class="uri" title="wikilink">sitar</a> on &quot;<a href="Norwegian_Wood_(This_Bird_Has_Flown)" title="wikilink">Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)</a>&quot;. He became interested in the <a href="Hare_Krishna_movement" title="wikilink">Hare Krishna movement</a> and an admirer of <a href="Culture_of_India" title="wikilink">Indian culture</a> and mysticism, introducing them to the other Beatles and their Western audience by incorporating Indian instrumentation in their music. Following <a href="The_Beatles&#39;_break-up" title="wikilink">the band's break-up</a> in 1970, Harrison released the triple album <em><a href="All_Things_Must_Pass" title="wikilink">All Things Must Pass</a></em>, from which two hit singles originated. He also organized the 1971 <a href="The_Concert_for_Bangladesh" title="wikilink">Concert for Bangladesh</a> with <a href="Ravi_Shankar" title="wikilink">Ravi Shankar</a>, a precursor for later <a href="benefit_concert" title="wikilink">benefit concerts</a> such as <a href="Live_Aid" title="wikilink">Live Aid</a>. Harrison was a music and film producer as well as a musician; he founded <a href="Dark_Horse_Records" title="wikilink">Dark Horse Records</a> in 1974 and co-founded <a href="HandMade_Films" title="wikilink">HandMade Films</a> in 1978.</p>
<p>Harrison released several best-selling singles and albums as a solo performer, and in 1988 co-founded the <a href="RIAA_certification" title="wikilink">platinum-selling</a> <a href="Supergroup_(music)" title="wikilink">supergroup</a> the <a href="Traveling_Wilburys" title="wikilink">Traveling Wilburys</a>. A prolific recording artist, he was featured as a guest guitarist on tracks by <a href="Badfinger" class="uri" title="wikilink">Badfinger</a>, <a href="Ronnie_Wood" title="wikilink">Ronnie Wood</a> and <a href="Billy_Preston" title="wikilink">Billy Preston</a>, and collaborated on songs and music with Bob Dylan, <a href="Eric_Clapton" title="wikilink">Eric Clapton</a> and <a href="Tom_Petty" title="wikilink">Tom Petty</a>, among others. <em><a href="Rolling_Stone" title="wikilink">Rolling Stone</a></em> magazine ranked him number 11 in their list of the &quot;100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time&quot;.</p>
<p>Harrison's first marriage, to <a href="Pattie_Boyd" title="wikilink">Pattie Boyd</a>, ended in divorce in 1977. The following year he married <a href="Olivia_Harrison" title="wikilink">Olivia Trinidad Arias</a>, with whom he had one son, <a href="Dhani_Harrison" title="wikilink">Dhani</a>. Harrison died in 2001, aged 58, from lung cancer. He was cremated and his ashes were scattered in the <a href="Ganges" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ganges</a> and <a href="Yamuna" class="uri" title="wikilink">Yamuna</a> rivers in India, in a private ceremony according to <a href="Ganges_in_Hinduism" title="wikilink">Hindu tradition</a>. He left almost &lt;U+00A3&gt;100 million in his will.</p>

<p>Born in <a href="Liverpool" class="uri" title="wikilink">Liverpool</a>, Lancashire, England, on 25 February 1943, Harrison was the youngest of four children of Harold Hargreaves Harrison and his wife Louise (n&lt;U+00E9&gt;e French). He had one sister, Louise, and two brothers, Harry and Peter. His mother was a shop assistant from a <a href="Catholic_Church" title="wikilink">Catholic</a> family with Irish roots, and his father was a bus conductor who had worked as a ship's steward on the <a href="White_Star_Line" title="wikilink">White Star Line</a>.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> His future wife, model Pattie Boyd, described Harrison's parents as &quot;quite short and very Liverpudlian&quot;. According to Boyd, Harrison's mother was particularly supportive: &quot;All she wanted for her children is that they should be happy, and she recognized that nothing made George quite as happy as making music.&quot; An enthusiastic music fan, she was known among friends for her loud singing voice, which at times startled visitors by rattling the Harrisons' windows. While pregnant with George, she often listened to the weekly broadcast, Radio India. Harrison biographer Joshua Greene wrote: &quot;Every Sunday she tuned in to mystical sounds evoked by sitars and <a href="tabla" title="wikilink">tablas</a>, hoping that the exotic music would bring peace and calm to the baby in the womb.&quot;</p>
<p>Harrison was born and lived for the first six years of his life at <a href="12_Arnold_Grove" title="wikilink">12 Arnold Grove</a>, <a href="Wavertree" class="uri" title="wikilink">Wavertree</a>, Liverpool, in a <a href="terraced_house" title="wikilink">terraced house</a> in a <a href="cul-de-sac" class="uri" title="wikilink">cul-de-sac</a>. The home had an outdoor toilet and its only heat came from a single coal fire. In 1949 the family was offered a <a href="council_house" title="wikilink">council house</a> and moved to 25 Upton Green, <a href="Speke" class="uri" title="wikilink">Speke</a>. In 1948, at the age of five, Harrison enrolled at Dovedale Primary School. He passed his <a href="11-plus" class="uri" title="wikilink">11-plus</a> examination and attended the prestigious <a href="Liverpool_Institute_High_School_for_Boys" title="wikilink">Liverpool Institute</a> from 1954 to 1959.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>Harrison's earliest musical influences included George Formby, <a href="Cab_Calloway" title="wikilink">Cab Calloway</a>, <a href="Django_Reinhardt" title="wikilink">Django Reinhardt</a>, <a href="Hoagy_Carmichael" title="wikilink">Hoagy Carmichael</a>, and <a href="Big_Bill_Broonzy" title="wikilink">Big Bill Broonzy</a>. In early 1956 he had an epiphany; while riding his bicycle, he heard <a href="Elvis_Presley" title="wikilink">Elvis Presley</a>'s &quot;<a href="Heartbreak_Hotel" title="wikilink">Heartbreak Hotel</a>&quot; playing from a nearby house, and the song piqued his interest in <a href="rock_and_roll" title="wikilink">rock and roll</a>.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> He often sat at the back of the class drawing guitars in his schoolbooks; he commented: &quot;I was totally into guitars&quot;.</p>
<p>Although apprehensive about his son's interest in pursuing a music career, in late 1956 Harrison's father bought him a Dutch Egmond flat top acoustic guitar.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> A friend of his father's taught Harrison how to play &quot;<a href="Whispering_(song)" title="wikilink">Whispering</a>&quot;, &quot;Sweet Sue&quot;, and &quot;<a href="Dinah_(song)" title="wikilink">Dinah</a>&quot;, and inspired by the music of <a href="Lonnie_Donegan" title="wikilink">Lonnie Donegan</a>, Harrison formed a skiffle group called the Rebels with his brother Peter and a friend, <a href="Arthur_Kelly_(actor)" title="wikilink">Arthur Kelly</a>.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> On the bus to school Harrison met <a href="Paul_McCartney" title="wikilink">Paul McCartney</a>, who became a member of <a href="John_Lennon" title="wikilink">John Lennon</a>'s band <a href="the_Quarrymen" title="wikilink">the Quarrymen</a>, and the pair bonded over their shared love of music.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>

<p>In March 1958 Harrison auditioned for the Quarrymen at <a href="Rory_Storm" title="wikilink">Rory Storm</a>'s Morgue Skiffle Club, playing &quot;<a href="Guitar_Boogie_(song)" title="wikilink">Guitar Boogie Shuffle</a>&quot;, but Lennon felt that Harrison, then 14, was too young to join the band. During a second meeting, arranged by McCartney, he performed the lead guitar part for the instrumental &quot;<a href="Raunchy_(song)" title="wikilink">Raunchy</a>&quot; on the upper deck of a Liverpool bus. Soon after he began socializing with the group, filling in on guitar as needed, and by the time he turned 15 they had accepted him as a member. Although his father wanted him to continue his education, Harrison left school at 16 and worked for several months as an apprentice electrician at <a href="Blacklers" class="uri" title="wikilink">Blacklers</a>, a local department store.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1960 <a href="Allan_Williams" title="wikilink">Allan Williams</a> arranged for the band, now calling themselves the Beatles, to play at the <a href="Kaiserkeller" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kaiserkeller</a> club in <a href="Hamburg" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hamburg</a>, owned by <a href="Bruno_Koschmider" title="wikilink">Bruno Koschmider</a>. The impromptu musical education Harrison received while playing long hours with the Beatles, as well as the guitar lessons he took from <a href="Tony_Sheridan" title="wikilink">Tony Sheridan</a> while they briefly served as his backing group, laid the foundations of his sound and of his quiet, professional role within the group; he was later known as &quot;the quiet Beatle&quot;.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> The band's first residency in Hamburg ended prematurely when Harrison was deported for being too young to work in nightclubs. When <a href="Brian_Epstein" title="wikilink">Brian Epstein</a> became their manager in December 1961, he polished their image and secured them a recording contract with <a href="EMI" class="uri" title="wikilink">EMI</a>.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> The group's first single, &quot;<a href="Love_Me_Do" title="wikilink">Love Me Do</a>&quot;, peaked at number seventeen on the <em><a href="Record_Retailer" title="wikilink">Record Retailer</a></em> chart, and by the time their debut album, <em><a href="Please_Please_Me" title="wikilink">Please Please Me</a></em> was released in early 1963, <a href="Beatlemania" class="uri" title="wikilink">Beatlemania</a> had arrived.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> Their second album, <em><a href="With_the_Beatles" title="wikilink">With the Beatles</a></em> (1963), included &quot;<a href="Don&#39;t_Bother_Me" title="wikilink">Don't Bother Me</a>&quot;, Harrison's first solo writing credit.</p>

<p>By 1965's <em><a href="Rubber_Soul" title="wikilink">Rubber Soul</a></em>, Harrison had begun to lead the other Beatles into <a href="folk_rock" title="wikilink">folk rock</a> through his interest in the Byrds and Bob Dylan, and towards Indian classical music through his use of the sitar on &quot;<a href="Norwegian_Wood_(This_Bird_Has_Flown)" title="wikilink">Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)</a>&quot;.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> He later called <em>Rubber Soul</em> his &quot;favourite [Beatles] album&quot;. <em><a href="Revolver_(album)" title="wikilink">Revolver</a></em> (1966) included three of his compositions: &quot;<a href="Taxman" class="uri" title="wikilink">Taxman</a>&quot;, &quot;<a href="Love_You_To" title="wikilink">Love You To</a>&quot; and &quot;<a href="I_Want_to_Tell_You" title="wikilink">I Want to Tell You</a>&quot;.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> His introduction of the drone-like <a href="Tanpura_(instrument)" title="wikilink">tambura</a> part on Lennon's &quot;<a href="Tomorrow_Never_Knows" title="wikilink">Tomorrow Never Knows</a>&quot; exemplified the band's ongoing exploration of non-Western instruments. The <a href="tabla" class="uri" title="wikilink">tabla</a>-driven &quot;Love You To&quot; was the Beatles' first genuine foray into Indian music. According to <a href="ethnomusicology" title="wikilink">ethnomusicologist</a> David Reck, the song set a precedent in popular music as an example of Asian culture being represented by Westerners respectfully and without parody.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<p>By late 1966 Harrison's interests had moved away from the Beatles, as reflected in his choice of Eastern <a href="guru" title="wikilink">gurus</a> and religious leaders for inclusion on the album cover for <em><a href="Sgt._Pepper&#39;s_Lonely_Hearts_Club_Band" title="wikilink">Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band</a></em> in 1967. His sole composition on the album was the Indian-inspired &quot;<a href="Within_You_Without_You" title="wikilink">Within You Without You</a>&quot;, to which no other Beatle contributed.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> He played sitar and tambura on the track, backed by musicians from the London Asian Music Centre on <a href="dilruba" class="uri" title="wikilink">dilruba</a>, <a href="swarmandal" class="uri" title="wikilink">swarmandal</a> and tabla. In November 1967, <a href="Juan_Mascar&lt;U+00F3&gt;" title="wikilink">Juan Mascar&lt;U+00F3&gt;</a>, a <a href="University_of_Cambridge" title="wikilink">University of Cambridge</a> academic, and an authority on ancient <a href="Hinduism" title="wikilink">Hindu</a> texts, wrote to him: &quot;['Within You Without You'] is a moving song and may it move the souls of millions; and there is more to come, as you are only beginning on the great journey.&quot;<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> Harrison continued to develop his interest in non-Western instrumentation, playing swarmandal on &quot;<a href="Strawberry_Fields_Forever" title="wikilink">Strawberry Fields Forever</a>&quot;. He later commented on the <em>Sgt Pepper</em> album: &quot;It was a millstone and a milestone in the music industry ... There's about half the songs I like and the other half I can't stand.&quot;</p>
<p>In 1968 his song &quot;<a href="The_Inner_Light_(song)" title="wikilink">The Inner Light</a>&quot; was recorded at the EMI Studios location in <a href="Mumbai" title="wikilink">Bombay</a>, featuring a group of local musicians playing traditional Indian instruments. Released as the B-side to McCartney's &quot;<a href="Lady_Madonna" title="wikilink">Lady Madonna</a>&quot;, it was the first Harrison composition to appear on a Beatles single. Derived from a quotation from the <em><a href="Tao_Te_Ching" title="wikilink">Tao Te Ching</a></em> supplied to Harrison by Mascar&lt;U+00F3&gt;, the song's lyric reflected Harrison's deepening interest in Hinduism and <a href="Transcendental_meditation" title="wikilink">meditation</a>, while musically it embraced the <a href="Carnatic_music" title="wikilink">Karnatak</a> discipline of Indian music, rather than the <a href="Hindustani_classical_music" title="wikilink">Hindustani</a> style of his previous work in the genre.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
<p>Dylan and <a href="the_Band" title="wikilink">the Band</a> were a major musical influence on Harrison at the end of his career with the Beatles. He established a friendship with Dylan and found himself drawn to the Band's sense of communal music-making and to the creative equality among the band members, in contrast with Lennon and McCartney's domination of the Beatles' songwriting and creative direction. This coincided with a prolific period in his songwriting and his growing desire to assert his independence from the band. During the recording of <em><a href="The_Beatles_(album)" title="wikilink">The Beatles</a></em> in 1968, tensions ran high, with drummer <a href="Ringo_Starr" title="wikilink">Ringo Starr</a> briefly quitting. Harrison's songwriting contributions to the album included &quot;<a href="While_My_Guitar_Gently_Weeps" title="wikilink">While My Guitar Gently Weeps</a>&quot;, which featured <a href="Eric_Clapton" title="wikilink">Eric Clapton</a> on lead guitar, &quot;<a href="Piggies" class="uri" title="wikilink">Piggies</a>&quot;, &quot;<a href="Long,_Long,_Long" title="wikilink">Long, Long, Long</a>&quot;, and &quot;<a href="Savoy_Truffle" title="wikilink">Savoy Truffle</a>&quot;.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> Tensions among the Beatles surfaced again during the filming of rehearsals at <a href="Twickenham_Studios" title="wikilink">Twickenham Studios</a> in January 1969 for what became the album <em><a href="Let_It_Be" title="wikilink">Let It Be</a></em>. Frustrated by the poor working conditions in the cold and sterile film studio, as well as by what he perceived as Lennon's creative disengagement from the Beatles and a domineering attitude from McCartney, Harrison left the band on 10 January. Following negotiations with the band, he agreed to return twelve days later.</p>
<p>Relations among the Beatles were more cordial, though still strained, during sessions for <em><a href="Abbey_Road" title="wikilink">Abbey Road</a></em>, their final recorded album. The LP included two of Harrison's most respected Beatles compositions: &quot;Here Comes the Sun&quot; and &quot;<a href="Something" class="uri" title="wikilink">Something</a>&quot;, which became one half of the Beatles' first <a href="A-side_and_B-side" title="wikilink">double-sided</a> number one single, Harrison's first A-side, and his first chart topper.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> In 1969, <a href="Frank_Sinatra" title="wikilink">Frank Sinatra</a> recorded &quot;Something&quot;, and later dubbed it &quot;the greatest love song of the past fifty years&quot;. Lennon considered it the best song on <em>Abbey Road</em>, and it became the Beatles' second most covered song after &quot;<a href="Yesterday" class="uri" title="wikilink">Yesterday</a>&quot;.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> By 1969, Harrison had matched Lennon and McCartney's songwriting abilities. Author Peter Lavezzoli wrote: &quot;Harrison would finally achieve equal songwriting status ... with his two classic contributions to the final Beatles' LP&quot;.</p>
<p>In April 1970 when Harrison's &quot;<a href="For_You_Blue" title="wikilink">For You Blue</a>&quot; was released in America as a double A-side with McCartney's &quot;<a href="The_Long_and_Winding_Road" title="wikilink">The Long and Winding Road</a>&quot;, it became the band's second chart-topping double A-side and &quot;For You Blue&quot; became Harrison's second number one hit. His increased productivity and the Beatles' reluctance to include his songs on their albums meant that by the time of <a href="Break-up_of_the_Beatles" title="wikilink">their break-up</a> he had amassed a stockpile of unreleased compositions. While Harrison grew as a songwriter, his compositional presence on Beatles albums remained limited to two or three songs, increasing his frustration, and significantly contributing to the band's <a href="Break-up_of_the_Beatles" title="wikilink">break-up</a>. Harrison's last recording session with the Beatles was on 4 January 1970, when he, McCartney and Starr recorded the Harrison song &quot;<a href="I_Me_Mine" title="wikilink">I Me Mine</a>&quot;.</p>

<h3 id="early-solo-work">Early solo work</h3>
<p>Before the Beatles' break-up Harrison had already recorded and released two solo albums: <em><a href="Wonderwall_Music" title="wikilink">Wonderwall Music</a></em> and <em><a href="Electronic_Sound" title="wikilink">Electronic Sound</a></em>, both of which include mainly instrumental compositions. <em>Wonderwall Music</em>, a soundtrack to the 1968 film <em><a href="Wonderwall_(film)" title="wikilink">Wonderwall</a></em>, blends Indian and Western sounds, while <em>Electronic Sound</em> is an experimental album that prominently features a <a href="Moog_synthesizer" title="wikilink">Moog synthesizer</a>.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> Released in November 1968, <em>Wonderwall Music</em> was the first solo album by a Beatle and the first LP released by <a href="Apple_Records" title="wikilink">Apple Records</a>.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> Indian musicians <a href="Aashish_Khan" title="wikilink">Aashish Khan</a> and <a href="Shivkumar_Sharma" title="wikilink">Shivkumar Sharma</a> performed on the album, which contains the experimental <a href="sound_collage" title="wikilink">sound collage</a> &quot;Dream Scene&quot;, recorded several months before Lennon's &quot;<a href="Revolution_9" title="wikilink">Revolution 9</a>&quot;.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a></p>
<p>In December 1969 Harrison joined the American group <a href="Delaney_&amp;_Bonnie" title="wikilink">Delaney &amp; Bonnie and Friends</a> for a brief tour of Europe. During the tour that included Clapton, <a href="Bobby_Whitlock" title="wikilink">Bobby Whitlock</a>, drummer <a href="Jim_Gordon_(musician)" title="wikilink">Jim Gordon</a> and band leaders <a href="Delaney_Bramlett" title="wikilink">Delaney</a> and <a href="Bonnie_Bramlett" title="wikilink">Bonnie Bramlett</a>, Harrison began to write &quot;<a href="My_Sweet_Lord" title="wikilink">My Sweet Lord</a>&quot;, which became his first single as a solo artist. Delaney Bramlett inspired Harrison to learn slide guitar, significantly influencing his later music.</p>
<h3 id="all-things-must-pass"><em>All Things Must Pass</em></h3>

<p>After years of being restricted in his songwriting contributions to the Beatles, Harrison released <em>All Things Must Pass</em>. It was a <a href="triple_album" title="wikilink">triple album</a>, with two discs of his songs and the third of recordings of Harrison <a href="Jam_session" title="wikilink">jamming</a> with friends. Regarded by many as his best work, the album topped the charts on both sides of the Atlantic. The LP produced the number-one <a href="hit_single" title="wikilink">hit single</a> &quot;My Sweet Lord&quot; and the top-ten single &quot;<a href="What_Is_Life" title="wikilink">What Is Life</a>&quot;. Dylan proved a significant influence on the album, which begins with the Dylan-Harrison collaboration &quot;<a href="I&#39;d_Have_You_Anytime" title="wikilink">I'd Have You Anytime</a>&quot;. The album was co-produced by <a href="Phil_Spector" title="wikilink">Phil Spector</a> using his &quot;<a href="Wall_of_Sound" title="wikilink">Wall of Sound</a>&quot; approach, and the musicians included Starr, Clapton, <a href="Gary_Wright" title="wikilink">Gary Wright</a>, Preston, <a href="Klaus_Voormann" title="wikilink">Klaus Voormann</a>, the whole of Delaney and Bonnie's Friends band and the Apple group <a href="Badfinger" class="uri" title="wikilink">Badfinger</a>. Ben Gerson of <em>Rolling Stone</em> described <em>All Things Must Pass</em> as being &quot;of classic Spectorian proportions, <a href="Richard_Wagner" title="wikilink">Wagnerian</a>, <a href="Anton_Bruckner" title="wikilink">Brucknerian</a>, the music of mountain tops and vast horizons.&quot;<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> Leng called &quot;<a href="Isn&#39;t_It_a_Pity" title="wikilink">Isn't It a Pity</a>&quot; Harrison's <a href="magnum_opus" title="wikilink">magnum opus</a>, and stated that the song &quot;captures the album's struggle between gospel ecstasy and the failure of human relationships.&quot; Author and <a href="musicology" title="wikilink">musicologist</a> Ian Inglis considered the lyrics of <a href="All_Things_Must_Pass_(song)" title="wikilink">the album's title track</a> &quot;a recognition of the impermanence of human existence ... a simple and poignant conclusion&quot; to Harrison's former band. In 1971 Bright Tunes sued Harrison for <a href="copyright_infringement" title="wikilink">copyright infringement</a> over &quot;My Sweet Lord&quot; owing to its similarity to the 1963 <a href="The_Chiffons" title="wikilink">Chiffons</a> hit &quot;<a href="He&#39;s_So_Fine" title="wikilink">He's So Fine</a>&quot;. He denied deliberately plagiarizing the song, but lost the court case in 1976 as the judge ruled that he had done so subconsciously.</p>
<p>In 2000 Apple Records released a thirtieth anniversary edition of the album and Harrison actively participated in its promotion, giving an interview during which he reflected on the work: &quot;It's just something that was like my continuation from the Beatles, really. It was me sort of getting out of the Beatles and just going my own way ... it was a very happy occasion.&quot; He commented on the production: &quot;Well, in those days it was like the <a href="Reverberation" title="wikilink">reverb</a> was kind of used a bit more than what I would do now. In fact, I don't use reverb at all. I can't stand it ... You know, it's hard to go back to anything thirty years later and expect it to be how you would want it now.&quot;</p>
<h3 id="the-concert-for-bangladesh">The Concert for Bangladesh</h3>

<p>Responding to a request from Ravi Shankar, Harrison organized a charity event, the Concert for Bangladesh, which took place on 1 August 1971, drawing over 40,000 people to two shows in New York's <a href="Madison_Square_Garden" title="wikilink">Madison Square Garden</a>.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> The goal of the event was to raise money to aid starving refugees during the <a href="Bangladesh_Liberation_War" title="wikilink">Bangladesh Liberation War</a>. Shankar opened the show, along with fellow Indian musicians <a href="Ali_Akbar_Khan" title="wikilink">Ali Akbar Khan</a> and <a href="Alla_Rakha" title="wikilink">Alla Rakha</a>. The concert featured popular musicians such as Dylan, who rarely appeared live in the early 1970s, Clapton, <a href="Leon_Russell" title="wikilink">Leon Russell</a>, Badfinger, Preston and Starr. A triple album, <em><a href="The_Concert_for_Bangladesh_(album)" title="wikilink">The Concert for Bangladesh</a></em>, was released by <a href="Apple_Corps" title="wikilink">Apple Corps</a> that year, followed by a <a href="The_Concert_for_Bangladesh_(film)" title="wikilink">concert film</a> in 1972. Tax troubles and questionable expenses later tied up many of the proceeds, but Harrison commented: &quot;Mainly the concert was to attract attention to the situation ... The money we raised was secondary, and although we had some money problems ... they still got plenty ... even though it was a drop in the ocean. The main thing was, we spread the word and helped get the war ended.&quot;<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> The event has been described as an innovative precursor for the high-profile charity rock shows that followed, including <a href="Live_Aid" title="wikilink">Live Aid</a>.</p>
<h3 id="living-in-the-material-world-to-george-harrison"><em>Living in the Material World</em> to <em>George Harrison</em></h3>
<p><em><a href="Living_in_the_Material_World" title="wikilink">Living in the Material World</a></em> (1973) held the number one spot on the <em>Billboard</em> album chart for five weeks, and the album's single, &quot;<a href="Give_Me_Love_(Give_Me_Peace_on_Earth)" title="wikilink">Give Me Love (Give Me Peace on Earth)</a>&quot;, also reached number one in the US.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> In the UK, the LP achieved number two, spending 12 weeks on the charts with the single peaking at number 8. The album was lavishly produced and packaged, and its dominant message was Harrison's Hindu beliefs. In Greene's opinion it &quot;contained many of the strongest compositions of his career&quot;. <em>Rolling Stone</em>{{'s}} <a href="Stephen_Holden" title="wikilink">Stephen Holden</a> declared the album &quot;vastly appealing&quot; and &quot;profoundly seductive ... [it] stands alone as an article of faith, miraculous in its radiance.&quot; Other reviewers were less enthusiastic, describing the release as awkward, sanctimonious and overly sentimental, a reaction that left Harrison despondent.</p>
<p>In November 1974 Harrison began his a 45-date Dark Horse Tour, becoming the first ex-Beatle to tour North America. In addition to performances by Harrison with an ensemble of musicians such as Preston, <a href="Tom_Scott" title="wikilink">Tom Scott</a>, <a href="Willie_Weeks" title="wikilink">Willie Weeks</a>, <a href="Andy_Newmark" title="wikilink">Andy Newmark</a> and <a href="Jim_Horn" title="wikilink">Jim Horn</a>, the tour also included traditional and contemporary Indian music performed by &quot;Ravi Shankar, Family and Friends&quot;.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> Despite numerous positive reviews the consensus reaction to the tour was negative, with complaints about the content, structure, and length; the show's duration of two and a half hours was seen as excessive at the time.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> Some fans found Shankar's significant presence a bizarre disappointment, having expected to see only Harrison perform, and many were affronted by what Inglis described as Harrison's &quot;sermonizing&quot;. Further, he reworked the lyrics to several Beatles songs, and some of the substitutions were seen as &quot;gratuitously offensive&quot;. His <a href="laryngitis" class="uri" title="wikilink">laryngitis</a>-affected vocals also disappointed fans and critics, who began calling the tour &quot;dark hoarse&quot;.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> He was so deeply bothered by the caustic backlash that he did not tour again until the 1990s. Author Robert Rodriguez commented: &quot;While the Dark Horse tour might be considered a noble failure, there were a number of fans who were tuned-in to what was being attempted. They went away ecstatic, conscious that they had just witnessed something so uplifting that it could never be repeated.&quot; Leng called the tour &quot;groundbreaking&quot; and &quot;revolutionary in its presentation of Indian Music&quot;.</p>
<p>In December he released <em><a href="Dark_Horse_(George_Harrison_album)" title="wikilink">Dark Horse</a></em>, an album that earned Harrison the least favourable reviews of his career. <em>Rolling Stone</em> called it &quot;the chronicle of a performer out of his element, working to a deadline, enfeebling his overtaxed talents by a rush to deliver a new 'LP product', rehearse a band, and assemble a cross-country tour, all within three weeks.&quot; The album reached number 4 on the <em><a href="Billboard_(magazine)" title="wikilink">Billboard</a></em> chart and the single &quot;<a href="Dark_Horse_(song)" title="wikilink">Dark Horse</a>&quot; reached number 15, but they failed to make an impact in the UK.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> Music critic <a href="Mikal_Gilmore" title="wikilink">Mikal Gilmore</a> described <em>Dark Horse</em> as &quot;one of Harrison's most fascinating works &lt;U+2013&gt; a record about change and loss&quot;.</p>
<p>Harrison's final studio album for EMI and Apple Records was the <a href="soul_music" title="wikilink">soul music</a>-inspired <em><a href="Extra_Texture_(Read_All_About_It)" title="wikilink">Extra Texture (Read All About It)</a></em> (1975). He considered it the least satisfactory of the three he had recorded since <em>All Things Must Pass</em>. Leng identified &quot;bitterness and dismay&quot; in many of the album's tracks; long-time Harrison friend Klaus Voormann commented: &quot;He wasn't up for it ... It was a terrible time because I think there was a lot of cocaine going around, and that's when I got out of the picture ... I didn't like his frame of mind&quot;. He released two singles from the LP: &quot;<a href="You_(George_Harrison_song)" title="wikilink">You</a>&quot;, which reached the <em>Billboard</em> top 20, and &quot;<a href="This_Guitar_(Can&#39;t_Keep_from_Crying)" title="wikilink">This Guitar (Can't Keep from Crying)</a>&quot;, Apple's final original single release.</p>
<p><em><a href="Thirty_Three_&amp;_1/3" title="wikilink">Thirty Three &amp; 1/3</a></em> (1976), Harrison's first album release on his own Dark Horse Records label, produced the hit singles &quot;<a href="This_Song" title="wikilink">This Song</a>&quot; and &quot;<a href="Crackerbox_Palace" title="wikilink">Crackerbox Palace</a>&quot;, both of which reached the top 25 in the US. The <a href="surreal_humour" title="wikilink">surreal humour</a> of &quot;Crackerbox Palace&quot; reflected Harrison's association with <a href="Monty_Python" title="wikilink">Monty Python</a>'s <a href="Eric_Idle" title="wikilink">Eric Idle</a>, who directed a comical music video for the song. With an emphasis on melody and musicianship, and a more subtle subject matter than the pious message of his earlier works, <em>Thirty Three &amp; 1/3</em> earned Harrison his most favourable critical notices in the US since <em>All Things Must Pass</em>.</p>
<p>In 1979, following his second marriage and the birth of his son <a href="Dhani_Harrison" title="wikilink">Dhani</a>, he released <em><a href="George_Harrison_(album)" title="wikilink">George Harrison</a></em>. The album and the single &quot;<a href="Blow_Away" title="wikilink">Blow Away</a>&quot; both made the <em>Billboard</em> top 20.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> The album marked the beginning of Harrison's gradual retreat from the music business, and the fruition of ideas introduced on <em>All Things Must Pass</em>. In 1978 the death of his father in May and the birth of his son in August had influenced his decision to devote more time to his family than to his career. Leng described the album as &quot;melodic and lush ... peaceful ... the work of a man who had lived the rock and roll dream twice over and was now embracing domestic as well as spiritual bliss.&quot;</p>

<p>The <a href="Death_of_John_Lennon" title="wikilink">murder of Lennon</a> on 8 December 1980 disturbed Harrison and reinforced his decades-long concerns about <a href="stalking" title="wikilink">stalkers</a>. It was also a deep personal loss, although unlike McCartney and Starr, Harrison had had little contact with Lennon in the years before his death.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> Following the murder, Harrison commented: &quot;After all we went through together I had and still have great love and respect for John Lennon.

<p>Harrison modified the lyrics of a song he had written for Starr to make it a tribute song to Lennon. &quot;<a href="All_Those_Years_Ago" title="wikilink">All Those Years Ago</a>&quot;, which included vocal contributions from Paul and Linda McCartney, as well as Starr's original drum part, peaked at number two in the US charts. The single was included on the album <em><a href="Somewhere_in_England" title="wikilink">Somewhere in England</a></em> in 1981. Harrison did not release any new albums for five years after 1982's <em><a href="Gone_Troppo" title="wikilink">Gone Troppo</a></em> received little notice from critics or the public.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a></p>

In March 1986 he made a surprise appearance during the finale of the <a href="Birmingham_Heart_Beat_Charity_Concert_1986" title="wikilink">Birmingham Heart Beat Charity Concert</a>, an event organized to raise money for the <a href="Birmingham_Children&#39;s_Hospital" title="wikilink">Birmingham Children's Hospital</a>. The following year, he appeared at <a href="The_Prince&#39;s_Trust" title="wikilink">The Prince's Trust</a> concert at London's <a href="Wembley_Arena" title="wikilink">Wembley Arena</a>, performing &quot;While My Guitar Gently Weeps&quot; and &quot;Here Comes the Sun&quot;. In February 1987 he joined Dylan, <a href="John_Fogerty" title="wikilink">John Fogerty</a> and <a href="Jesse_Ed_Davis" title="wikilink">Jesse Ed Davis</a> on stage for a two-hour performance with blues musician, <a href="Taj_Mahal_(musician)" title="wikilink">Taj Mahal</a>. Harrison recalled: &quot;Bob rang me up and asked if I wanted to come out for the evening and see Taj Mahal ... So we went there and had a few of these Mexican beers &lt;U+2013&gt; and had a few more ... Bob says, 'Hey, why don't we all get up and play, and you can sing?' But every time I got near the microphone, Dylan comes up and just starts singing this rubbish in my ear, trying to throw me.&quot;</p>
<p>In November 1987 Harrison released the platinum album <em><a href="Cloud_Nine_(George_Harrison_album)" title="wikilink">Cloud Nine</a></em>.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> Co-produced with <a href="Jeff_Lynne" title="wikilink">Jeff Lynne</a> of <a href="Electric_Light_Orchestra" title="wikilink">Electric Light Orchestra</a>, the LP included Harrison's rendition of <a href="James_Ray_(singer)" title="wikilink">James Ray's</a> &quot;<a href="Got_My_Mind_Set_on_You" title="wikilink">Got My Mind Set on You</a>&quot;, which went to number one in the US and number two in the UK.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a><a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> The accompanying music video received substantial airplay,<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> and another single, &quot;<a href="When_We_Was_Fab" title="wikilink">When We Was Fab</a>&quot;, a retrospective of the Beatles' career, earned two <a href="MTV_Music_Video_Awards" title="wikilink">MTV Music Video Awards</a> nominations in 1988.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> Recorded at his estate in Friar Park, Harrison's slide guitar playing featured prominently on the album, which included several of his long-time musical collaborators, including Clapton, Keltner, and Jim Horn, who recalled Harrison's relaxed and friendly demeanour during the sessions: &quot;George made you feel at home, in his home ...

<p>In 1988 Harrison formed the Traveling Wilburys with Jeff Lynne, <a href="Roy_Orbison" title="wikilink">Roy Orbison</a>, Bob Dylan and Tom Petty. The group had gathered in Dylan's garage to record a song for a projected Harrison European single release.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> Harrison's record company decided the track, &quot;<a href="Handle_with_Care_(song)" title="wikilink">Handle with Care</a>&quot;, was too good for its original purpose as a B-side and asked for a full album. The LP, <em><a href="Traveling_Wilburys_Vol._1" title="wikilink">Traveling Wilburys Vol. 1</a></em>, was released in October 1988 and recorded under pseudonyms as half-brothers, supposed sons of Charles Truscott Wilbury, Sr.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> Harrison's pseudonym on the first album was &quot;Nelson Wilbury&quot;; he used the name &quot;Spike Wilbury&quot; for their second album.</p>
<p>After Orbison's death in December 1988 the group recorded as a four-piece. Their second release, issued in October 1990, was mischievously titled <em><a href="Traveling_Wilburys_Vol._3" title="wikilink">Traveling Wilburys Vol. 3</a></em>. According to Lynne, &quot;That was George's idea. He said, 'Let's confuse the buggers.'&quot;<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> It reached number 14 in the UK, where it went <a href="RIAA_certification" title="wikilink">platinum</a> with certified sales of more than 3,000,000 units.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> The Wilburys never performed live and the group did not record together again following the release of their second album.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a></p>

<h3 id="the-beatles-anthology"><em>The Beatles Anthology</em></h3>

<p>In 1994 Harrison began a collaboration with the surviving former Beatles and Traveling Wilburys producer Jeff Lynne for the <em>Beatles Anthology</em> project. This included the recording of two new Beatles songs built around solo vocal and piano tapes recorded by Lennon as well as lengthy interviews about the Beatles' career. Released in December 1995, &quot;<a href="Free_as_a_Bird" title="wikilink">Free as a Bird</a>&quot; was the first new Beatles single since 1970.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a> In March 1996, they released a second single, &quot;<a href="Real_Love_(The_Beatles_song)" title="wikilink">Real Love</a>&quot;.

<p>Following the <em>Anthology</em> project, Harrison collaborated with Ravi Shankar on the latter's <em>Chants of India</em>. Harrison's final television appearance was a <a href="VH1" title="wikilink">VH-1</a> special to promote the album, taped in May 1997.

<h2 id="musicianship">Musicianship</h2>
<h3 id="songwriting">Songwriting</h3>

<p>Harrison wrote his first song, &quot;Don't Bother Me&quot; while sick in a hotel bed in Bournemouth during August 1963, as &quot;an exercise to see if I <em>could</em> write a song&quot;, as he remembered. &quot;Don't Bother Me&quot; appeared on the band's second album, <em><a href="With_the_Beatles" title="wikilink">With the Beatles</a></em>, later that year, then on <em><a href="Meet_the_Beatles!" title="wikilink">Meet the Beatles!</a></em> in the US in early 1964. In 1965, he contributed &quot;<a href="I_Need_You_(The_Beatles_song)" title="wikilink">I Need You</a>&quot; and &quot;<a href="You_Like_Me_Too_Much" title="wikilink">You Like Me Too Much</a>&quot; to the album <em><a href="Help!_(album)" title="wikilink">Help!</a></em>.</p>
<p>Harrison's songwriting ability improved through the years, but his material did not earn full respect from his fellow Beatles until near the group's break-up. In 1969, McCartney told Lennon: &quot;Until this year, our songs have been better than George's. Now this year his songs are at least as good as ours&quot;.<a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a> Harrison often had difficulty getting the band to record his songs. Most Beatles albums contain at least two Harrison compositions, and there are three of his songs on the 1966 <em><a href="Revolver_(album)" title="wikilink">Revolver</a></em> LP, &quot;the album on which Harrison came of age as a songwriter&quot;, according to musicologist and author Ian Inglis.</p>

<p>Of the 1967 Harrison song &quot;<a href="Within_You_Without_You" title="wikilink">Within You Without You</a>&quot;, author Gerry Farrell claimed that Harrison had created a &quot;new form&quot;, calling the composition: &quot;a quintessential fusion of pop and Indian music.&quot; Lennon called the song one of Harrison's best: &quot;His mind and his music are clear. There is his innate talent, he brought that sound together.&quot; Beatles biographer Bob Spitz described &quot;Something&quot; as a masterpiece: &quot;an intensely stirring romantic ballad that would challenge 'Yesterday' and 'Michelle' as one of the most recognizable songs they ever produced.&quot; According to author Kenneth Womack: 'Harrison comes into his own on <em>Abbey Road</em> ... &quot;Here Comes the Sun&quot; is matched&lt;U+2014&gt;indeed, surpassed&lt;U+2014&gt;only by &quot;Something&quot;, his crowning achievement'. Inglis considered <em>Abbey Road</em> a turning point in Harrison's development as a songwriter and musician. He described Harrison's contributions to the LP as &quot;exquisite&quot;, declaring them equal to any previous Beatles songs. During the album's recording, Harrison asserted more creative control than before, proactively rejecting suggestions for changes to his music or lyrics, particularly from McCartney.</p>
<p>His interest in Indian music proved a strong influence on his songwriting and contributed to his innovation within the Beatles. According to <em>Rolling Stone</em>: &quot;Harrison's openness to new sounds and textures cleared new paths for his rock and roll compositions. His use of dissonance on ... 'Taxman' and 'I Want to Tell You' was revolutionary in popular music &lt;U+2013&gt; and perhaps more originally creative than the avant-garde mannerisms that Lennon and McCartney borrowed from the music of <a href="Karlheinz_Stockhausen" title="wikilink">Karlheinz Stockhausen</a>, <a href="Luciano_Berio" title="wikilink">Luciano Berio</a>, <a href="Edgar_Varese" title="wikilink">Edgar Varese</a> and <a href="Igor_Stravinsky" title="wikilink">Igor Stravinsky</a>&quot;. In 1997, author Gerry Farrell commented: &quot;It is a mark of Harrison's sincere involvement ... that, nearly thirty years on, the Beatles' 'Indian' songs remain the most imaginative and successful examples of this type of fusion.&quot;</p>
<h3 id="guitar-work">Guitar work</h3>

<p><em>Rolling Stone</em> founder <a href="Jann_Wenner" title="wikilink">Jann Wenner</a> described Harrison as &quot;a guitarist who was never showy but who had an innate, eloquent melodic sense. He played exquisitely in the service of the song&quot;. Harrison's friend and former bandmate, Tom Petty agreed: &quot;He just had a way of getting right to the business, of finding the right thing to play.&quot; The <a href="guitar_picking" title="wikilink">guitar picking</a> style of <a href="Chet_Atkins" title="wikilink">Chet Atkins</a> and <a href="Carl_Perkins" title="wikilink">Carl Perkins</a> influenced Harrison, giving a <a href="country_music" title="wikilink">country music</a> feel to many of the Beatles' recordings. He identified <a href="Chuck_Berry" title="wikilink">Chuck Berry</a> as an early influence and <a href="Ry_Cooder" title="wikilink">Ry Cooder</a> as an important later influence.<a href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1961 the Beatles recorded &quot;<a href="Cry_for_a_Shadow" title="wikilink">Cry for a Shadow</a>&quot;, a blues-inspired instrumental co-written by Lennon and Harrison, who is credited with composing the song's lead guitar part, building on unusual chord voicings and imitating the style of other English groups such as <a href="the_Shadows" title="wikilink">the Shadows</a>. Musicologist Walter Everett noted that while early Beatles compositions typically held close to the conventional patterns in rock music at the time, he also identified significant variations in their rhythm and tonal direction. Harrison's liberal use of the <a href="diatonic_scale" title="wikilink">diatonic scale</a> in his guitar playing reveals the influence of <a href="Buddy_Holly" title="wikilink">Buddy Holly</a>, and his interest in Berry inspired him to compose songs based on the <a href="blues_scale" title="wikilink">blues scale</a> while incorporating a <a href="rockabilly" class="uri" title="wikilink">rockabilly</a> feel in the style of Perkins. Within this framework he often utilized <a href="syncopation" class="uri" title="wikilink">syncopation</a>, such as during his guitar solos for the Beatles' covers of Berry's &quot;<a href="Roll_Over_Beethoven" title="wikilink">Roll Over Beethoven</a>&quot; and &quot;<a href="Too_Much_Monkey_Business" title="wikilink">Too Much Monkey Business</a>&quot;. Another musical technique used by Harrison was the use of guitar lines written in <a href="octave" title="wikilink">octaves</a>, as on &quot;<a href="I&#39;ll_Be_on_My_Way" title="wikilink">I'll Be on My Way</a>&quot;. He was the first person to own a <a href="Rickenbacker_360/12" title="wikilink">Rickenbacker 360/12</a>, a guitar that featured twelve strings, six of which are tuned one octave higher than the previous string, producing distinct overtones. His use of one during the recording of <em><a href="A_Hard_Day&#39;s_Night_(album)" title="wikilink">A Hard Day's Night</a></em> helped to popularize the model, and the jangly sound became so prominent that <em><a href="Melody_Maker" title="wikilink">Melody Maker</a></em> termed it the Beatles' &quot;secret weapon&quot;.<a href="#fn67" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a></p>
<p>Harrison wrote the <a href="chord_progression" title="wikilink">chord progression</a> of his first published song, &quot;Don't Bother Me&quot; (1963), almost exclusively in <a href="Dorian_mode" title="wikilink">Dorian mode</a>, demonstrating an interest in exotic tones that eventually culminated in his embrace of Indian music. The dark <a href="timbre" class="uri" title="wikilink">timbre</a> of his guitar playing on the track was accentuated by his use of uncomplicated yet effective C+9 <a href="Chord_(music)" title="wikilink">chord</a> voicings, performing a solo in the <a href="Pentatonic_scale#Minor_pentatonic_scale" title="wikilink">minor pentatonic scale</a>. By 1964 he had begun to develop a distinctive personal style as a guitarist, writing parts that featured the use of nonresolving tones, as with the ending chord arpeggios on &quot;<a href="A_Hard_Day&#39;s_Night_(song)" title="wikilink">A Hard Day's Night</a>&quot;. In 1965 he used an <a href="Expression_pedal#Guitars_and_digital_effects" title="wikilink">expression pedal</a> to control his guitar's volume on &quot;<a href="I_Need_You_(The_Beatles_song)" title="wikilink">I Need You</a>&quot;, creating a syncopated <a href="String_instrument#Contact_points_along_the_string" title="wikilink">flautando</a> effect with the melody resolving its <a href="Consonance_and_dissonance#Dissonance" title="wikilink">dissonance</a> through tonal displacements. He used the same volume-swell technique on &quot;<a href="Yes_It_Is" title="wikilink">Yes It Is</a>&quot;, applying what Everett described as &quot;ghostly articulation&quot; to the song's <a href="Harmonic" title="wikilink">natural harmonics</a>.</p>
<p>Of <em>Rubber Soul</em>{{'}}s &quot;<a href="If_I_Needed_Someone" title="wikilink">If I Needed Someone</a>&quot;, Harrison said: &quot;it's like a million other songs written around the D chord. If you move your fingers about, you get various little melodies ... it amazes me that people still find new permutations of the same notes.&quot; His other contribution to the album, &quot;<a href="Think_For_Yourself" title="wikilink">Think For Yourself</a>&quot; features what Everett described as &quot;ambiguous tonal coloring&quot;, utilizing <a href="chromaticism" class="uri" title="wikilink">chromaticism</a> in <a href="Major_chord" title="wikilink">G major</a> with a &quot;strange&quot; mixture of the Dorian mode and the minor pentatonic; he called it a &quot;tour de force of altered scale degrees&quot;.<a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a> In 1966 Harrison contributed innovative musical ideas to <em>Revolver</em>. He played <a href="Backmasking" title="wikilink">backwards</a> guitar on Lennon's composition &quot;<a href="I&#39;m_Only_Sleeping" title="wikilink">I'm Only Sleeping</a>&quot; and a guitar <a href="counter-melody" class="uri" title="wikilink">counter-melody</a> on &quot;<a href="And_Your_Bird_Can_Sing" title="wikilink">And Your Bird Can Sing</a>&quot; that moved in parallel octaves above McCartney's bass downbeats. His guitar playing on &quot;<a href="I_Want_to_Tell_You" title="wikilink">I Want to Tell You</a>&quot; exemplified the pairing of altered chordal colours with descending chromatic lines and his guitar part for <em>Sgt Pepper's</em> &quot;<a href="Lucy_in_the_Sky_with_Diamonds" title="wikilink">Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds</a>&quot; mirrors Lennon's vocal line in much the same way that a <a href="sarangi" class="uri" title="wikilink">sarangi</a> player accompanies a <a href="khyal" class="uri" title="wikilink">khyal</a> singer in a Hindu <a href="bhajan" title="wikilink">devotional song</a>.<a href="#fn69" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref69"><sup>69</sup></a></p>

<p>Everett described Harrison's guitar solo from &quot;<a href="Old_Brown_Shoe" title="wikilink">Old Brown Shoe</a>&quot; as &quot;stinging [and] highly Claptonesque&quot;. He identified two of the composition's significant <a href="Motif_(music)" title="wikilink">motifs</a>: a bluesy <a href="trichord" class="uri" title="wikilink">trichord</a> and a <a href="diminished_triad" title="wikilink">diminished triad</a> with roots in A and E. Huntley called the song &quot;a sizzling rocker with a ferocious ... solo.&quot; In Greene's opinion, Harrison's <a href="Demo_(music)" title="wikilink">demo</a> for the song contains &quot;one of the most complex lead guitar solos on any Beatles song.&quot;</p>
<p>Harrison's playing on <em>Abbey Road</em>, and in particular on &quot;Something&quot;, marked a significant moment in his development as a guitarist. The song's guitar solo shows a varied range of influences, incorporating the blues guitar style of Clapton and the styles of Indian <a href="Gamaka_(music)" title="wikilink">gamakas</a>. According to author and musicologist Kenneth Womack: &quot;'Something' meanders toward the most unforgettable of Harrison's guitar solos ... A masterpiece in simplicity, [it] reaches toward the sublime&quot;. Harrison received an Ivor Novello award in July 1970 for &quot;Something&quot;, as &quot;The Best Song Musically and Lyrically of the Year&quot;.</p>
<p>After <a href="Delaney_Bramlett" title="wikilink">Delaney Bramlett</a> inspired him to learn slide guitar, Harrison began to incorporate it into his solo work, which allowed him to mimic many traditional Indian instruments, including the <a href="sarangi" class="uri" title="wikilink">sarangi</a> and the <a href="dilruba" class="uri" title="wikilink">dilruba</a>. Leng described Harrison's slide guitar solo on Lennon's &quot;<a href="How_Do_You_Sleep?_(John_Lennon_song)" title="wikilink">How Do You Sleep?&quot;</a> as a departure for &quot;the sweet soloist of 'Something'&quot;, calling his playing &quot;rightly famed ... one of Harrison's greatest guitar statements.&quot; Lennon commented: &quot;That's the best he's ever fucking played in his life.&quot;</p>
<p>A <a href="Hawaiian_music" title="wikilink">Hawaiian</a> influence is notable in much of Harrison's music, ranging from his slide guitar work on <em>Gone Troppo</em> (1982) to his televised performance of the <a href="Cab_Calloway" title="wikilink">Cab Calloway</a> standard &quot;<a href="Between_the_Devil_and_the_Deep_Blue_Sea_(song)" title="wikilink">Between the Devil and the Deep Blue Sea</a>&quot; on <a href="ukulele" class="uri" title="wikilink">ukulele</a> in 1992.<a href="#fn70" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a> Lavezzoli described Harrison's slide playing on the Grammy-winning instrumental &quot;Marwa Blues&quot; (2002) as demonstrating Hawaiian influences while comparing the melody to an Indian <a href="sarod" class="uri" title="wikilink">sarod</a> or <a href="Veena_(Instrument)" title="wikilink">veena</a>, calling it &quot;yet another demonstration of Harrison's unique slide approach&quot;. Harrison was an admirer of <a href="George_Formby" title="wikilink">George Formby</a> and a member of the Ukulele Society of Great Britain, and played a ukulele solo in the style of Formby at the end of &quot;Free as a Bird&quot;. He performed at a Formby convention in 1991, and served as the honorary president of the George Formby Appreciation Society. Harrison played bass guitar on numerous tracks, including the Beatles' songs &quot;<a href="Drive_My_Car" title="wikilink">Drive My Car</a>&quot;, &quot;<a href="She_Said_She_Said" title="wikilink">She Said She Said</a>&quot;, &quot;<a href="Golden_Slumbers" title="wikilink">Golden Slumbers</a>&quot;, &quot;<a href="Birthday_(The_Beatles_song)" title="wikilink">Birthday</a>&quot; and &quot;<a href="Honey_Pie" title="wikilink">Honey Pie</a>&quot;.<a href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a> He also played bass on several solo recordings, including &quot;<a href="Faster_(George_Harrison_song)" title="wikilink">Faster</a>&quot;, &quot;<a href="Wake_Up_My_Love" title="wikilink">Wake Up My Love</a>&quot; and &quot;<a href="Bye_Bye_Love_(The_Everly_Brothers_song)#George_Harrison&#39;s_version" title="wikilink">Bye Bye Love</a>&quot;.</p>

<p>When Harrison joined the Quarrymen in 1958 his main guitar was a <a href="H&lt;U+00F6&gt;fner" class="uri" title="wikilink">H&lt;U+00F6&gt;fner</a> President Acoustic, which he soon traded for a H&lt;U+00F6&gt;fner Club 40 model. His first solid-body electric guitar was a Czech-built Jolana Futurama/Grazioso. The guitars he used on early recordings were mainly <a href="Gretsch" class="uri" title="wikilink">Gretsch</a> models, played through a <a href="Vox_AC30" title="wikilink">Vox amplifier</a>, including a <a href="Gretsch_Duo_Jet" title="wikilink">Gretsch Duo Jet</a> that he bought secondhand in 1961, and posed with on the album cover for <em>Cloud Nine</em> (1987).<a href="#fn72" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref72"><sup>72</sup></a> He also bought a Gretsch Tennessean and a Gretsch Country Gentleman, which he played on &quot;<a href="She_Loves_You" title="wikilink">She Loves You</a>&quot;, and during the Beatles' 1964 appearance on <em><a href="The_Ed_Sullivan_Show" title="wikilink">The Ed Sullivan Show</a></em>. In 1963, he bought a <a href="Rickenbacker" class="uri" title="wikilink">Rickenbacker</a> 425 Fireglo, and in 1964, he acquired a Rickenbacker 360/12 guitar.<a href="#fn73" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref73"><sup>73</sup></a> Harrison obtained his first <a href="Fender_Stratocaster" title="wikilink">Fender Stratocaster</a> in 1965, using it to record <em>Rubber Soul</em>, notably on the song &quot;<a href="Nowhere_Man_(song)" title="wikilink">Nowhere Man</a>&quot;.</p>

Harrison also used a <a href="Gibson_J-160E" title="wikilink">Gibson J-160E</a> and a <a href="Gibson_SG" title="wikilink">Gibson SG</a> Standard while recording the album. He later painted his Stratocaster in a psychedelic design that included the word &quot;<a href="Be-Bop-A-Lula" title="wikilink">Bebopalula</a>&quot; above the pickguard and the guitar's nickname, &quot;Rocky&quot;, on the headstock. He played this guitar in the <em><a href="Magical_Mystery_Tour_(film)" title="wikilink">Magical Mystery Tour</a></em> film and throughout his solo career. In mid-1968 he acquired a <a href="Gibson_Les_Paul" title="wikilink">Gibson Les Paul</a> that he nicknamed &quot;<a href="Lucy_(guitar)" title="wikilink">Lucy</a>&quot;.

<p>During the Beatles' American tour in August 1965 Harrison's friend <a href="David_Crosby" title="wikilink">David Crosby</a> of the Byrds introduced him to <a href="Indian_classical_music" title="wikilink">Indian classical music</a> and the work of <a href="sitar" class="uri" title="wikilink">sitar</a> maestro Ravi Shankar. Harrison became fascinated with the instrument, immersed himself in Indian music, and played a pivotal role in expanding the emerging interest in the sitar and <a href="Music_of_India" title="wikilink">Indian music</a> in the West. According to Lavezzoli, Harrison's introduction of sitar: &quot;opened the floodgates for Indian instrumentation in rock music, triggering what Shankar would call 'The Great Sitar Explosion' of 1966&lt;U+2013&gt;67.&quot; Lavezzoli described Harrison as &quot;the man most responsible for this phenomenon ... the tidal wave of Western infatuation with Indian music&quot;.</p>
<p>In June 1966 Harrison met Shankar at the home of Mrs Angadi of the Asian Music Circle, asked to be his student, and was accepted. Later, Shankar and <a href="Alla_Rakha" title="wikilink">Alla Rakha</a> gave a private concert at Harrison's house that Starr and Lennon attended.<a href="#fn79" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref79"><sup>79</sup></a> On 6 July, Harrison travelled to India to buy a sitar from Rikhi Ram &amp; Sons in New Delhi. Lavezzoli described Harrison's sitar playing on the <em>Revolver</em> track &quot;<a href="Love_You_To" title="wikilink">Love You To</a>&quot; as an &quot;astonishing improvement&quot; over &quot;Norwegian Wood&quot; and &quot;the most accomplished performance on sitar by any rock musician.&quot; In September, he returned to India to study sitar with Shankar. He initially stayed in Bombay, then moved to a houseboat on a remote lake where Shankar taught him for six weeks. After Shankar, he received tutelage from Shambhu Das. He studied the instrument until 1968, when an encounter with Clapton and Hendrix at a hotel in New York convinced him to put down the instrument and return to guitar playing. He commented: &quot;I decided ... I should get back to the guitar because I'm not getting any better at it, and I'm not going to be a great sitar player ... because I should have started at least fifteen years earlier.&quot; <a href="#fn80" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref80"><sup>80</sup></a></p>
<p>In addition to popularizing Indian music in general, Harrison's befriending of Shankar helped to raise the Indian musician's profile in the West. &quot;I was known very well and quite famous in the classical sense,&quot; Shankar later said, &quot;but meeting George ... that created such a tremendous [interest] all over the world ... Which helped me to become like a pop star&quot;.<a href="#fn81" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref81"><sup>81</sup></a> Harrison was influential in the decision to have Shankar included on the bill at the <a href="Monterey_Pop_Festival" title="wikilink">Monterey Pop Festival</a> in 1967, and at <a href="Woodstock" class="uri" title="wikilink">Woodstock</a> in 1969. The Concert for Bangladesh in 1971 led to Indian classical music reaching a larger audience than it had before. Leng called Harrison the &quot;single-handed catalyst for a generation's interest in Indian culture.&quot;</p>

<p>Over time Harrison became an admirer of <a href="Culture_of_India" title="wikilink">Indian culture</a> and mysticism, introducing it to the other Beatles. During the filming of <em><a href="Help!_(film)" title="wikilink">Help!</a></em> in the <a href="Bahamas" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bahamas</a>, they met the founder of <a href="Sivananda_Yoga" title="wikilink">Sivananda Yoga</a>, <a href="Swami_Vishnu-devananda" title="wikilink">Swami Vishnu-devananda</a>, who gave each of them a signed copy of his book, <em>The Complete Illustrated Book of Yoga</em>. Between the end of the last Beatles tour in 1966 and the beginning of the <em>Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band</em> recording sessions, he took a pilgrimage to <a href="Mumbai" title="wikilink">Bombay</a> with his wife Pattie, where he studied sitar, met several <a href="guru" title="wikilink">gurus</a>, and visited various holy places. The <a href="Self-Realization_Fellowship" title="wikilink">Self-Realization Fellowship</a> gurus <a href="Mahavatar_Babaji" title="wikilink">Mahavatar Babaji</a>, <a href="Lahiri_Mahasaya" title="wikilink">Lahiri Mahasaya</a>, <a href="Sri_Yukteswar" title="wikilink">Sri Yukteswar</a> and <a href="Paramahansa_Yogananda" title="wikilink">Paramahansa Yogananda</a> appear on the <em>Sgt Pepper</em> cover at his request. In 1968 he travelled to <a href="Rishikesh" class="uri" title="wikilink">Rishikesh</a> in northern India with the other Beatles to study meditation with <a href="Maharishi_Mahesh_Yogi" title="wikilink">Maharishi Mahesh Yogi</a>. Harrison's use of <a href="psychedelic_drug" title="wikilink">psychedelic drugs</a> encouraged his path to meditation and Hinduism. He commented: &quot;For me, it was like a flash. The first time I had <a href="Lysergic_acid_diethylamide" title="wikilink">acid</a>, it just opened up something in my head that was inside of me, and I realized a lot of things. I didn't learn them because I already knew them, but that happened to be the key that opened the door to reveal them. From the moment I had that, I wanted to have it all the time&lt;U+2014&gt;these thoughts about the yogis and the Himalayas, and Ravi's music.&quot;</p>
<p>Harrison became a vegetarian in the late 1960s, and a devotee of the Indian mystic Paramahansa Yogananda.<a href="#fn82" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref82"><sup>82</sup></a> In mid-1969, he produced the single &quot;<a href="Hare_Krishna_Mantra" title="wikilink">Hare Krishna Mantra</a>&quot;, performed by members of the London <a href="Radha" class="uri" title="wikilink">Radha</a> <a href="Krishna" class="uri" title="wikilink">Krishna</a> Temple. Soon after, Harrison embraced the Hare Krishna tradition, particularly <em><a href="Japa" title="wikilink">japa-yoga</a></em> chanting with beads, and became a lifelong devotee. He respected people of other faiths and once remarked: &quot;All religions are branches of one big tree. It doesn't matter what you call Him just as long as you call.&quot; He commented on his beliefs:</p>

<p><em>Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna</em>{{'}}, asking Krishna to come and take over the chariot.}}</p>
<p>Prior to his religious conversion, the only British performer known for similar activities had been <a href="Cliff_Richard" title="wikilink">Cliff Richard</a>, whose conversion to Christianity in 1966 had gone largely unnoticed by the public. &quot;By contrast,&quot; wrote Inglis, &quot;Harrison's spiritual journey was seen as a serious and important development that reflected popular music's increasing maturity ... what he, and the Beatles had managed to overturn was the paternalistic assumption that popular musicians had no role other than to stand on stage and sing their hit songs.&quot;</p>

<p>Harrison married model <a href="Pattie_Boyd" title="wikilink">Pattie Boyd</a> on 21 January 1966, with McCartney as <a href="Groomsman#Best_man" title="wikilink">best man</a>. Harrison and Boyd had met in 1964 during the production of the film <em>A Hard Day's Night</em>, in which the 19-year-old Boyd had been cast as a schoolgirl. They separated in 1974 and their divorce was finalized in 1977.<a href="#fn83" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref83"><sup>83</sup></a> Boyd said her decision to end their marriage and leave Harrison was based largely on his repeated infidelities, culminating in an affair with Starr's wife <a href="Maureen_Starkey_Tigrett" title="wikilink">Maureen</a>, which Boyd called &quot;the final straw&quot;. She characterized the last year of their marriage as &quot;fuelled by alcohol and cocaine&quot;, and she stated: &quot;George used coke excessively, and I think it changed him ... it froze his emotions and hardened his heart.&quot; She subsequently moved in with Clapton, and they married in 1979.</p>
<p>Harrison married Dark Horse Records secretary <a href="Olivia_Harrison" title="wikilink">Olivia Trinidad Arias</a> on 2 September 1978. They had met at the Dark Horse offices in Los Angeles in 1974, and together had one son, Dhani Harrison, born on 1 August 1978.<a href="#fn84" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref84"><sup>84</sup></a></p>
<p>Harrison described Ravi Shankar as: &quot;the first person who ever impressed me in my life ... and he was the only person who didn't try to impress me.&quot; Harrison had formed a close friendship with Clapton in the late 1960s, and he wrote one of his compositions for the <em>Abbey Road</em> album, &quot;<a href="Here_Comes_the_Sun" title="wikilink">Here Comes the Sun</a>&quot;, in Clapton's back garden.<a href="#fn85" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref85"><sup>85</sup></a> Harrison developed a dry sense of humour as a youth, influenced by the <a href="Surreal_humour" title="wikilink">surreal comedy</a> of <em><a href="The_Goon_Show" title="wikilink">The Goon Show</a></em>. Through his appreciation of Monty Python he met Eric Idle and the two became close friends; Idle performed Python's &quot;<a href="The_Lumberjack_Song" title="wikilink">Lumberjack Song</a>&quot; at the <a href="Concert_for_George" title="wikilink">Concert for George</a> in 2002 to commemorate Harrison. Idle described him as &quot;one of the few morally good people that rock and roll has produced&quot;.</p>
<p>He restored the English manor house and grounds of Friar Park, his home in <a href="Henley-on-Thames" class="uri" title="wikilink">Henley-on-Thames</a>, where several of his music videos were filmed including &quot;<a href="Crackerbox_Palace" title="wikilink">Crackerbox Palace</a>&quot;; the grounds also served as the background for the cover of <em>All Things Must Pass</em>. He employed ten workers to maintain the  garden. Harrison commented on gardening as a form of <a href="escapism" class="uri" title="wikilink">escapism</a>: &quot;Sometimes I feel like I'm actually on the wrong planet, and it's great when I'm in my garden, but the minute I go out the gate I think: 'What the hell am I doing here?'&quot; His autobiography, <em><a href="I,_Me,_Mine_(book)" title="wikilink">I, Me, Mine</a></em>, is dedicated &quot;to gardeners everywhere&quot;.<a href="#fn86" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref86"><sup>86</sup></a> Former Beatles publicist <a href="Derek_Taylor" title="wikilink">Derek Taylor</a> helped Harrison write the book, which said little about the Beatles, focusing instead on Harrison's hobbies, music and lyrics.<a href="#fn87" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref87"><sup>87</sup></a> Taylor commented: &quot;George is not disowning the Beatles ... but it was a long time ago and actually a short part of his life.&quot;</p>
<p>Harrison had an interest in <a href="sports_car" title="wikilink">sports cars</a> and <a href="motor_racing" title="wikilink">motor racing</a>; he was one of the 100 people who purchased the <a href="McLaren_F1" title="wikilink">McLaren F1</a> road car. He had collected photos of racing drivers and their cars since he was young; at 12 he had attended his first race, the <a href="1955_British_Grand_Prix" title="wikilink">1955 British Grand Prix</a> at <a href="Aintree_Racecourse#Motor_racing" title="wikilink">Aintree</a>.<a href="#fn88" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref88"><sup>88</sup></a> He wrote &quot;<a href="Faster_(George_Harrison_song)" title="wikilink">Faster</a>&quot; as a tribute to the <a href="Formula_One" title="wikilink">Formula One</a> racing drivers <a href="Jackie_Stewart" title="wikilink">Jackie Stewart</a> and <a href="Ronnie_Peterson" title="wikilink">Ronnie Peterson</a>. Proceeds from its release went to the <a href="Gunnar_Nilsson" title="wikilink">Gunnar Nilsson</a> cancer charity, set up following the Swedish driver's death from the disease in 1978. Harrison's first extravagant car, a 1964 <a href="Aston_Martin_DB5" title="wikilink">Aston Martin DB5</a>, sold at auction on 7 December 2011 in London. An anonymous Beatles collector paid &lt;U+00A3&gt;350,000 for the vehicle that Harrison had bought new in January 1965.<a href="#fn89" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref89"><sup>89</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="relationships-with-the-other-beatles">Relationships with the other Beatles</h3>
<p>For most of the Beatles' career the relationships in the group were close. According to <a href="Hunter_Davies" title="wikilink">Hunter Davies</a>, &quot;the Beatles spent their lives not living a communal life, but communally living the same life. They were each other's greatest friends.&quot; Harrison's wife Pattie Boyd described how the Beatles &quot;all belonged to each other&quot; and admitted, &quot;George has a lot with the others that I can never know about. Nobody, not even the wives, can break through or even comprehend it.&quot;</p>
<p>Starr said, &quot;We really looked out for each other and we had so many laughs together. In the old days we'd have the biggest hotel suites, the whole floor of the hotel, and the four of us would end up in the bathroom, just to be with each other&quot;. He added, &quot;there were some really loving, caring moments between four people: a hotel room here and there &lt;U+2013&gt; a really amazing closeness. Just four guys who loved each other. It was pretty sensational.&quot;</p>
<p>Lennon stated that his relationship with Harrison was &quot;one of young follower and older guy ... [he] was like a disciple of mine when we started.&quot; The two later bonded over their <a href="Lysergic_acid_diethylamide" title="wikilink">LSD</a> experiences, finding common ground as seekers of spirituality. They took radically different paths thereafter, Harrison finding God and Lennon coming to the conclusion that people are the creators of their own lives. Harrison said that Lennon &quot;was both a saint and a bastard&quot;.</p>
<p>McCartney and Harrison were the first of the Beatles to meet, having shared a school bus, and often learned and rehearsed new guitar chords together. McCartney stated that he and Harrison usually shared a bedroom while touring.<a href="#fn90" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref90"><sup>90</sup></a> McCartney was best man at Harrison's wedding in 1966, and was the only Beatle in attendance. McCartney has referred to Harrison as his &quot;baby brother&quot;.<a href="#fn91" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref91"><sup>91</sup></a> In a 1974 BBC radio interview with <a href="Alan_Freeman" title="wikilink">Alan Freeman</a>, Harrison stated: &quot;[McCartney] ruined me as a guitar player&quot;. Perhaps the most significant obstacle to a Beatles reunion after the death of Lennon was Harrison and McCartney's personal relationship, as both men admitted that they often got on each other's nerves. Author Robert Rodriguez commented: &quot;even to the end of George's days, theirs was a volatile relationship&quot;.</p>
<h3 id="humanitarian-work">Humanitarian work</h3>
<p>Harrison was involved in humanitarian and political <a href="activism" class="uri" title="wikilink">activism</a> throughout his life. In the 1960s, the Beatles supported the <a href="civil_rights_movement" title="wikilink">civil rights movement</a> and protested against the Vietnam War. Following the band's break-up, Ravi Shankar consulted Harrison about how to provide aid to the people of Bangladesh after the <a href="1970_Bhola_Cyclone" title="wikilink">1970 Bhola Cyclone</a> and the <a href="Bangladesh_Liberation_War" title="wikilink">Bangladesh Liberation War</a>.<a href="#fn92" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref92"><sup>92</sup></a> Harrison recorded the song &quot;<a href="Bangla_Desh_(song)" title="wikilink">Bangla Desh</a>&quot;, and pushed Apple Records to release his song alongside Shankar's &quot;Joy Bangla&quot; in an effort to raise funds.<a href="#fn93" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref93"><sup>93</sup></a> Shankar then asked for Harrison's advice about planning a small charity event in the US. Harrison responded by organizing <a href="the_Concert_for_Bangladesh" title="wikilink">the Concert for Bangladesh</a>, which raised more than $240,000.<a href="#fn94" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref94"><sup>94</sup></a> In June 1972, <a href="UNICEF" class="uri" title="wikilink">UNICEF</a> honoured Harrison and Shankar with the &quot;Child Is the Father of Man&quot; award at an annual ceremony in recognition of their fundraising efforts for Bangladesh.</p>
<p>The George Harrison Humanitarian Fund for UNICEF is a joint effort between the Harrison family and the US Fund for UNICEF, that aims to support programmes to help children caught in humanitarian emergencies.<a href="#fn95" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref95"><sup>95</sup></a> In December 2007, they donated $450,000 to help the victims of Cyclone Sidr in Bangladesh.<a href="#fn96" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref96"><sup>96</sup></a> On 13 October 2009, the first George Harrison Humanitarian Award went to Ravi Shankar for his efforts in saving the lives of children, and his involvement with the Concert for Bangladesh.<a href="#fn97" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref97"><sup>97</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="handmade-films">HandMade Films</h2>

<p>In 1973 <a href="Peter_Sellers" title="wikilink">Peter Sellers</a> introduced Harrison to <a href="Denis_O&#39;Brien_(producer)" title="wikilink">Denis O'Brien</a>. Soon after, the two went into business together. In 1978, in an effort to produce <em><a href="Monty_Python&#39;s_Life_of_Brian" title="wikilink">Monty Python's Life of Brian</a></em>, they formed the film production and distribution company HandMade Films.<a href="#fn98" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref98"><sup>98</sup></a> Harrison explained: &quot;The name of the company came about as a bit of a joke. I'd been to Wooky Hole in Somerset ... [near] an old paper mill where they show you how to make old underpants into paper. So I bought a few rolls, and they had this watermark 'British Handmade Paper' ... So we said ... we'll call it Handmade Films.&quot;</p>
<p>Their opportunity for investment came after <a href="EMI_Films" title="wikilink">EMI Films</a> withdrew funding at the demand of their Chief Executive, <a href="Bernard_Delfont" title="wikilink">Bernard Delfont</a>. Harrison financed the production of <em>Life of Brian</em> in part by mortgaging his home, which Idle later called &quot;the most anybody's ever paid for a cinema ticket in history.&quot; The film grossed $21 million at the box office in the US. The first film distributed by HandMade Films was <em><a href="The_Long_Good_Friday" title="wikilink">The Long Good Friday</a></em> (1980), and the first they produced was <em><a href="Time_Bandits" title="wikilink">Time Bandits</a></em> (1981), a co-scripted project by <a href="Monty_Python" title="wikilink">Monty Python</a>{{'}}s <a href="Terry_Gilliam" title="wikilink">Terry Gilliam</a> and <a href="Michael_Palin" title="wikilink">Michael Palin</a>. The film featured a new song by Harrison, &quot;<a href="Dream_Away" title="wikilink">Dream Away</a>&quot;, in the closing credits. <em>Time Bandits</em> became one of HandMade's most successful and acclaimed efforts; with a budget of $5 million, it earned $35 million in the US within ten weeks of its release.</p>
<p>Harrison served as <a href="Film_producer" title="wikilink">executive producer</a> for 23 films with HandMade, including <em><a href="Mona_Lisa_(movie)" title="wikilink">Mona Lisa</a></em>, <em><a href="Shanghai_Surprise" title="wikilink">Shanghai Surprise</a></em> and <em><a href="Withnail_and_I" title="wikilink">Withnail and I</a></em>. He made several <a href="cameo_appearance" title="wikilink">cameo appearances</a> in these films, including a role as a nightclub singer in <em>Shanghai Surprise</em>, for which he recorded five new songs. According to author and musicologist Ian Inglis, Harrison's &quot;executive role in HandMade Films helped to sustain British cinema at a time of crisis, producing some of the country's most memorable movies of the 1980s.&quot; A series of <a href="box_office_bomb" title="wikilink">box office bombs</a> in the late 1980s caused HandMade to cease operations in 1991 and in 1994, the company was sold.</p>
<h2 id="legacy">Legacy</h2>
<p>In 1965 Harrison and the other Beatles were appointed Members of the Order of the British Empire (<a href="Order_of_the_British_Empire" title="wikilink">MBE</a>). They received their insignia from <a href="Elizabeth_II" title="wikilink">the Queen</a> at an investiture at Buckingham Palace on 26 October.

<p>In 2002, on the first anniversary of his death, the <a href="Concert_for_George" title="wikilink">Concert for George</a> was held at the <a href="Royal_Albert_Hall" title="wikilink">Royal Albert Hall</a>. Clapton organized the concert, which included performances by many of Harrison's friends and musical collaborators, including McCartney and Starr. The profits from the concert went to Harrison's charity, the Material World Charitable Foundation.</p>
<p>Harrison was posthumously inducted into the <a href="Rock_and_Roll_Hall_of_Fame" title="wikilink">Rock and Roll Hall of Fame</a> as a solo artist on 15 March 2004 by his former bandmates Lynne and Petty,<a href="#fn102" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref102"><sup>102</sup></a> and into the Madison Square Garden Walk of Fame on 1 August 2006 for the Concert for Bangladesh.<a href="#fn103" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref103"><sup>103</sup></a> On 14 April 2009, the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce awarded Harrison a star on the <a href="Hollywood_Walk_of_Fame" title="wikilink">Walk of Fame</a> in front of the <a href="Capitol_Records_Building" title="wikilink">Capitol Records Building</a>. McCartney, Lynne and Petty were present when the star was unveiled. Harrison's widow Olivia, actor <a href="Tom_Hanks" title="wikilink">Tom Hanks</a> and comedian Eric Idle made speeches at the ceremony, and Harrison's son Dhani uttered the Hare Krishna mantra.<a href="#fn104" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref104"><sup>104</sup></a></p>
