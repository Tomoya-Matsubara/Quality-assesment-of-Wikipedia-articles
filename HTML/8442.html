<h3 id="fianna-fu00e1il">Fianna F&lt;U+00E1&gt;il</h3>
<p>For the first time in any presidential election, Fianna F&lt;U+00E1&gt;il is neither running a candidate nor supporting the nomination of a candidate. The decision was made at a meeting of the parliamentary party on 31 August 2011, and was in line with the recommendations of the six-person subcommittee formed by the party leader <a href="Miche&lt;U+00E1&gt;l_Martin" title="wikilink">Miche&lt;U+00E1&gt;l Martin</a> to consider the matter.<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a></p>
<p>In June 2011 press reports had indicated that the party was unlikely to run a candidate both for financial reasons and also because it was unlikely that a Fianna F&lt;U+00E1&gt;il nominee could be successful.<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a><a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a><a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a> In early August 2011 there was press speculation that <a href="RT&lt;U+00C9&gt;" class="uri" title="wikilink">RT&lt;U+00C9&gt;</a> broadcaster <a href="Gay_Byrne" title="wikilink">Gay Byrne</a> might seek a nomination. On 6 August Miche&lt;U+00E1&gt;l Martin rang Byrne at his holiday home to indicate that Fianna F&lt;U+00E1&gt;il Oireachtas members would facilitate his nomination.<a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a> Byrne indicated that he had yet to make a decision on whether to put his name forward, but said that if he did so he would not run under the Fianna F&lt;U+00E1&gt;il banner but as an independent, albeit with the assistance of the party's organisation. &quot;Fianna F&lt;U+00E1&gt;il are convinced no matter who they put up will be unelectable, so they're giving me their support&quot; he told the <em><a href="Irish_Independent" title="wikilink">Irish Independent</a></em>.<a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a><a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a> &lt;U+00C9&gt;amon &lt;U+00D3&gt; Cu&lt;U+00ED&gt;v, the party's deputy leader and member of the committee tasked with deciding on their strategy for the election stated that &quot;I know of no approach to Gay Byrne...

He stated that the idea of running had been &quot;foisted on him and he had not known anything about it and what it would involve&quot;.<a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a> This followed unease among Fianna F&lt;U+00E1&gt;il parliamentary party Oireachtas members, with a number unhappy that a candidate was being imposed by the leadership without discussion.<a href="#fn69" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref69"><sup>69</sup></a></p>
<p>On 16 August 2011, the <em><a href="Irish_Examiner" title="wikilink">Irish Examiner</a></em> reported that Miche&lt;U+00E1&gt;l Martin had moved to pull the party out of the presidential race over the fallout from the approach to Gay Byrne, the cost involved and the slim chance of a candidate being elected.<a href="#fn70" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a> On 24 August, however, the party's deputy leader &lt;U+00C9&gt;amon &lt;U+00D3&gt; Cu&lt;U+00ED&gt;v told <a href="Raidi&lt;U+00F3&gt;_na_Gaeltachta" title="wikilink">Raidi&lt;U+00F3&gt; na Gaeltachta</a> that he believed the party should put forward a candidate.<a href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a> Several members had expressed an interest in the a party nomination:</p>

<p>Following the decision by Fianna F&lt;U+00E1&gt;il not to run their own candidate, there was speculation that some party members might be prepared to nominate an independent candidate. However, on 11 September the party's <a href="Chief_Whip" title="wikilink">chief whip</a>, <a href="Se&lt;U+00E1&gt;n_&lt;U+00D3&gt;_Fearghail" title="wikilink">Se&lt;U+00E1&gt;n &lt;U+00D3&gt; Fearghail</a>, made it clear that individual TDs and senators would not be permitted to sign the nomination papers of independent candidates. He said that if the party decided to support a candidacy it would be done collectively.<a href="#fn78" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref78"><sup>78</sup></a></p>
<p>A meeting of the parliamentary party was held on 15 September at which the issue of the presidential election was raised.

Senator &lt;U+00D3&gt; Murch&lt;U+00FA&gt; withdrew his request for a nomination and a motion was passed that the party's Oireachtas members would not nominate or endorse any candidate. The decision was seen as a severe blow to the attempts to secure a nomination by David Norris and Dana Rosemary Scallon who were expected to need signatures from individual Fianna F&lt;U+00E1&gt;il members.<a href="#fn82" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref82"><sup>82</sup></a></p>
