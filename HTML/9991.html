<p><strong>Stigand</strong> (died <a href="1072" class="uri" title="wikilink">1072</a>) was an <a href="Anglo-Saxon_England" title="wikilink">English</a> churchman of pre-<a href="Norman_conquest_of_England" title="wikilink">Conquest</a> England. He served as <a href="archbishop_of_Canterbury" title="wikilink">archbishop of Canterbury</a>, <a href="bishop_of_Winchester" title="wikilink">bishop of Winchester</a> and was twice <a href="bishop_of_Elmham" title="wikilink">bishop of Elmham</a>. Stigand acted as an adviser to several members of both the <a href="Anglo-Saxon" class="uri" title="wikilink">Anglo-Saxon</a> and <a href="Norman" class="uri" title="wikilink">Norman</a> lines of English royalty.</p>
<p>Five successive popes, including <a href="Pope_Nicholas_II" title="wikilink">Pope Nicholas II</a> and <a href="Pope_Alexander_II" title="wikilink">Pope Alexander II</a>, all excommunicated Stigand for holding both the see of Winchester and the see of Canterbury at the same time. Stigand submitted to <a href="William_I_of_England" title="wikilink">William the Conqueror</a> and assisted at his coronation on Christmas Day, 1066. In <a href="1070" class="uri" title="wikilink">1070</a> he was deposed by the papal legate and was imprisoned at Winchester. At the time of the death of <a href="Edward_the_Confessor" title="wikilink">Edward the Confessor</a>, only the royal estates and the estates of Harold had been larger and wealthier than those held by Stigand.</p>
<h2 id="early-life">Early life</h2>
<p>Stigand first appears in the historical record in 1020 when, as a royal chaplain to <a href="Canute_the_Great" title="wikilink">Canute</a>, he was appointed to the church that Canute built at <a href="Ashingdon" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ashingdon</a> to honor the souls of those killed in Canute's coming to power in 1016.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a><a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> After Canute's death he served Canute's son, <a href="Harold_Harefoot" title="wikilink">Harold Harefoot</a>. His name was Norwegian and he was born in <a href="East_Anglia" title="wikilink">East Anglia</a>, possibly born a native of Norwich.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> He was definitely of mixed English and Scandanavian stock.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> After the death of <a href="Harthacanute" class="uri" title="wikilink">Harthacanute</a>, Stigand appears to have acted as the chief adviser of Canute's widow, <a href="Emma_of_Normandy" title="wikilink">Emma of Normandy</a> mother of both Harthacanute and <a href="Edward_the_Confessor" title="wikilink">Edward the Confessor</a>.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="bishop-of-elmham-and-winchester">Bishop of Elmham and Winchester</h2>
<p><img src="British.Library.MS.Add.33241.jpg" title="fig:Emma of Normandy, seated with sons Harthacanute and Edward the Confessor, in this manuscript copy of the Encomium Emmae from circa 1042." alt="Emma of Normandy, seated with sons Harthacanute and Edward the Confessor, in this manuscript copy of the Encomium Emmae from circa 1042." width="300" /> Shortly after Edward the Confessor's coronation, Stigand was appointed to the <a href="Bishop_of_Norwich" title="wikilink">see of Elmham</a>, almost assuredly on Emma's advice.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> Elmham was the diocese that covered East Anglia. On <a href="April_3" title="wikilink">April 3</a> <a href="1043" class="uri" title="wikilink">1043</a><a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> he was consecrated bishop.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> Edward, however, deposed Stigand in late 1043 and deprived him of his wealth. The deposition was short lived, as Edward returned Stigand to the episcopal chair by 1044.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> The reasons for the deposition are unknown, but it was probably connected to the similar fall from grace of the king's mother Emma that occurred at the same time. Rumors of the time included one that had Emma and Stigand having an affair, which led to both of them being deprived of the king's favor.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1047 he was translated to the <a href="Bishop_of_Winchester" title="wikilink">see of Winchester</a>.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a><a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> He retained at Elmham, however, until 1052.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> Some have held that he supported Earl <a href="Godwin,_Earl_of_Wessex" title="wikilink">Godwin of Wessex</a> in his quarrel with <a href="Edward_the_Confessor" title="wikilink">Edward the Confessor</a>,<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> others hold that he was neutral.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> Whatever the case, in 1052 there was arranged a peace between the earl and the king.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="archbishop-of-canterbury">Archbishop of Canterbury</h2>
<p>In 1052 the archbishop of Canterbury, <a href="Robert_of_Jumieges" title="wikilink">Robert of Jumieges</a>, was outlawed and driven from England. Stigand was then appointed to the archbishopric.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> This was either a reward from Godwin, for siding with Godwin's family in the crisis of 1051–1052, or one from King Edward for successfully negotiating a peaceful conclusion to the situation in 1052 when Godwin returned.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> <a href="Pope_Leo_IX" title="wikilink">Pope Leo IX</a> and his two successors refused to recognize him, regarding Robert as the rightful archbishop. Stigand released Elmham to his brother <a href="&lt;U+00C6&gt;thelmaer" class="uri" title="wikilink">&lt;U+00C6&gt;thelmaer</a>, but retained the bishopric of Winchester at the same time he was archbishop.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> He was the first non-monk to be named to either the Archbishopric of Canterbury or of York since before the days of <a href="Dunstan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Dunstan</a>.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> He was later accused of <a href="simony" class="uri" title="wikilink">simony</a>, or the buying of ecclesiastical office, but all such accusations date to after 1066, and are thus suspect due to the post-<a href="Norman_conquest_of_England" title="wikilink">Conquest</a> desire to vilify Stigand and the English Church as corrupt and backward.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> Stigand may have been behind the effort to locate <a href="Edward_the_Exile" title="wikilink">Edward the Atheling</a> and his brother Edmund after 1052, possibly to secure a more acceptable heir to King Edward.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="excommunicated">Excommunicated</h2>
<p><img src="Papaalessandro.jpg" title="fig:Pope Alexander II was one pope who excommunicated the archbishop." alt="Pope Alexander II was one pope who excommunicated the archbishop." width="150" /> In 1058, however, <a href="Pope_Benedict_X" title="wikilink">Benedict X</a> gave him the <a href="pallium" title="wikilink">pall</a>,<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> but this pope was deposed in the following year. At this time, there was a growing movement in the church to reform itself and, being a <a href="benefice#Before_the_Reformation" title="wikilink">pluralist</a>, or the holding of more than one <a href="benefice" class="uri" title="wikilink">benefice</a> at the same time, came under scrutiny. Since Stigand retained Winchester, he was definitely a pluralist, which <a href="Pope_Nicholas_II" title="wikilink">Pope Nicholas II</a> had in 1061 declared to be uncannoical unless approved by the pope, when he declared the <a href="Aldred" title="wikilink">Aldred of Worcester</a> must give up <a href="see_of_Worcester" title="wikilink">Worcester</a> in order to be consecrated <a href="Archbishop_of_York" title="wikilink">Archbishop of York</a>.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> Five successive popes (<a href="Pope_Leo_IX" title="wikilink">Pope Leo IX</a>, <a href="Pope_Victor_II" title="wikilink">Pope Victor II</a>, <a href="Pope_Stephen_IX" title="wikilink">Pope Stephen IX</a>, <a href="Pope_Nicholas_II" title="wikilink">Pope Nicholas II</a> and <a href="Pope_Alexander_II" title="wikilink">Pope Alexander II</a>)<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> excommunicated Stigand for holding both Winchester and Canterbury at the same time. Not only did Stigand hold Winchester along with Canterbury, but he held the <a href="Gloucester_Cathedral" title="wikilink">abbey of Gloucester</a> and the <a href="Ely_Cathedral" title="wikilink">abbey of Ely</a> and perhaps others.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> His position was such that even bishops in England were leery of being consecrated by him.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> Both <a href="Giso_of_Wells" title="wikilink">Giso of Wells</a> and <a href="Walter_of_Lorraine" title="wikilink">Walter of Hereford</a> travelled to Rome to be consecrated by the Pope in 1061, rather than be consecrated by Stigand.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> The position of Stigand as head of the church in England was used to good effect by the Normans in their propaganda before, during and after the Conquest.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> During the brief period that he held a pallium, however, Stigand did consecrate <a href="&lt;U+00C6&gt;thelric_II" title="wikilink">Aethelric of Selsey</a> and <a href="Siward,_Bishop_of_Rochester" title="wikilink">Siward of Rochester</a>.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a></p>
<p>Due to Stigand's issues with the papacy, the <a href="Archbishop_of_York" title="wikilink">diocese of York</a> was able to encroach on the suffragan bishops normally subject to Canterbury. York had long been held in common with <a href="Bishop_of_Worcester" title="wikilink">Worcester</a>, but during the period when Stigand was excommunicated, the see of York also claimed <a href="Bishop_of_Lichfield" title="wikilink">Lichfield</a> and <a href="Bishop_of_Lincoln" title="wikilink">Dorcester</a> as part of its archiepiscopal diocese.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> In 1062, however, papal legates of <a href="Pope_Alexander_II" title="wikilink">Alexander II</a> came to England. They did not depose Stigand, and even consulted with him and treated him as archbishop.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> He was allowed to attend the council they held and was an active participant with the legates in the business of the council.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a></p>

<p><img src="William1.jpg" title="fig:William I, shown here from the Bayeux Tapestry, eventually deposed Stigand." alt="William I, shown here from the Bayeux Tapestry, eventually deposed Stigand." width="220" /> Stigand is said by Norman writers to have crowned <a href="Harold_Godwinson" title="wikilink">King Harold II</a> in January of 1066<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> and is depicted at that coronation in the <a href="Bayeux_tapestry" title="wikilink">Bayeux tapestry</a>, but current historical research has shown that this ceremony was performed by <a href="Aldred" class="uri" title="wikilink">Aldred</a>, <a href="Archbishop_of_York" title="wikilink">Archbishop of York</a> due to the controversy about Stigand's position.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a><a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a><a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> Stigand did support Harold and was present at Edward the Confessor's deathbed.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> The English sources claim that Aldred crowned Harold, while the Norman sources claim that Stigand did so, with the conflict between the various sources probably tracing to the post-Conquest desire to vilify Harold and depict his coronation as unlawful.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a></p>
<p>After the death of Harold, Stigand worked with <a href="Edwin,_Earl_of_Mercia" title="wikilink">Earl Edwin</a> and <a href="Morcar_of_Northumbria" title="wikilink">Earl Morcar</a>, as well as <a href="Aldred" title="wikilink">Archbishop Aldred of York</a>, to put <a href="Edgar_&lt;U+00C6&gt;theling" title="wikilink">Edgar Atheling</a> on the throne.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> This plan did not come to fruition, however, as the northern earls and some of the other bishops were against it.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> Stigand submitted to <a href="William_I_of_England" title="wikilink">William</a> at <a href="Wallingford" class="uri" title="wikilink">Wallingford</a> in early December of 1066,<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> and assisted at his coronation on Christmas Day, 1066.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> William took Stigand in his train to <a href="Normandy" class="uri" title="wikilink">Normandy</a> in 1067.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> After the first rebellions broke out, William adopted a policy of conciliating the church and gave Stigand a place at court, as well as giving administrative positions to Aldred of York and Aethelwig, abbot of <a href="Evesham_Abbey" title="wikilink">Evesham</a>.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a> Once the danger of rebellion was past, however, William had no further need of Stigand.<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> At a Council held at <a href="Winchester" class="uri" title="wikilink">Winchester</a> at Easter,<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a> the bishops met with papal legates from <a href="Pope_Alexander_II" title="wikilink">Alexander II</a>.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a> On <a href="April_11" title="wikilink">April 11</a> <a href="1070" class="uri" title="wikilink">1070</a> he was deposed<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a> by the papal legate, Ermenfrid, bishop of Sion<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a> and was imprisoned at Winchester.
