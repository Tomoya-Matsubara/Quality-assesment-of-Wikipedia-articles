<p><strong>Percy George Herbert Fender</strong> (22 August 1892 &lt;U+2013&gt; 15 June 1985) was an English <a href="cricket" title="wikilink">cricketer</a> who played 13 <a href="Test_cricket" title="wikilink">Tests</a> and was captain of <a href="Surrey_County_Cricket_Club" title="wikilink">Surrey</a> between 1921 and 1931. An <a href="all-rounder" class="uri" title="wikilink">all-rounder</a>, he was a middle-order batsman who bowled mainly <a href="leg_spin" title="wikilink">leg spin</a>, and completed the cricketer's <a href="Double_(cricket)" title="wikilink">double</a> seven times. Noted as a belligerent batsman, in 1920 he hit the fastest recorded first-class <a href="Century_(cricket)" title="wikilink">century</a>, reaching three figures in 35 minutes which remains a record in 2013. On the basis of his Surrey captaincy, contemporaries judged him the best captain in England.</p>
<p>As early as 1914 Fender was named one of <a href="Wisden_Cricketers&#39;_Almanack" title="wikilink"><em>Wisden's</em></a> <a href="Wisden_Cricketer_of_the_Year" title="wikilink">Cricketers of the Year</a>. After <a href="First_World_War" title="wikilink">war service</a> in the <a href="Royal_Flying_Corps" title="wikilink">Royal Flying Corps</a> he re-established himself in the Surrey team and became captain in 1921. His captaincy inspired the team to challenge strongly for the <a href="County_Championship" title="wikilink">County Championship</a> over the course of several seasons, despite a shortage of effective bowlers. Alongside his forceful though occasionally controversial leadership, Fender was an effective performer with bat and ball, although he lacked support as a bowler. From 1921, he played occasionally in Tests for <a href="England_cricket_team" title="wikilink">England</a> but was never particularly successful. Despite press promptings, he was not appointed captain of England, and following a clash with the highly influential <a href="George_Harris,_4th_Baron_Harris" title="wikilink">Lord Harris</a> in 1924, his England career was effectively ended. Further disagreements between Fender and the Surrey committee over his approach and tactics led the county to replace him as captain in 1932 and to end his career in 1935.</p>
<p>A very recognisable figure, Fender was popular with his team and with supporters. Cartoonists enjoyed caricaturing his distinctive appearance, but he was also well known outside cricket for his presence in <a href="High_society_(group)" title="wikilink">society</a>. In addition to his cricket career, Fender worked in the wine trade, had a successful career in journalism, and wrote several well-received books on cricket tours. He worked well into the 1970s, even after going blind. He died in 1985.</p>
<h2 id="early-life">Early life</h2>
<p>Fender was the elder son of Percy Robert Fender, the director of a firm of <a href="Stationery" title="wikilink">stationers</a>, and Lily, n&lt;U+00E9&gt;e Herbert.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> Born in <a href="Balham" class="uri" title="wikilink">Balham</a>, <a href="Surrey" class="uri" title="wikilink">Surrey</a> in 1892, he was encouraged to play cricket by his mother's family who were involved in <a href="Brighton" class="uri" title="wikilink">Brighton</a> club cricket,<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> and from the age of eight he attended cricket matches to watch <a href="Sussex_County_Cricket_Club" title="wikilink">Sussex</a> when visiting them.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> First educated at <a href="St_George&#39;s_College,_Weybridge" title="wikilink">St George's College, Weybridge</a>, then at <a href="St_Paul&#39;s_School,_London" title="wikilink">St Paul's School, London</a>,<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> Fender did not excel academically, but was proficient in many sports.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>At St Paul's, Fender began to attract attention as a cricketer.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> Awarded his <a href="school_colours" title="wikilink">school colours</a> in 1908, he remained in the school team for three years.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> In 1909, he topped the school's <a href="Batting_average_(cricket)" title="wikilink">batting averages</a>,<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> scoring a century in one match against <a href="Bedford_School" title="wikilink">Bedford School</a>. In the same game, he was criticised by his schoolmaster for bowling <a href="Lob_bowling" title="wikilink">lobs</a>.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> Fender's success led to his selection for a representing <a href="Public_school_(United_Kingdom)" title="wikilink">Public Schools</a> XI against the <a href="Marylebone_Cricket_Club" title="wikilink">Marylebone Cricket Club</a> (MCC) at <a href="Lord&#39;s_Cricket_Ground" title="wikilink">Lord's</a>. His success for St Paul's continued in 1910, but his school career came to an abrupt end following an argument between his father and the <a href="High_Master_(academic)" title="wikilink">High Master</a> of the school. The dispute concerned a cricket match which Fender had played without his parent's permission, and his father was unhappy that cricket was taking precedence over academic studies.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> Fender was removed from the school immediately; he still came top of the batting averages for 1910 but although selected, he was not allowed to play at Lord's that summer as he was no longer a schoolboy.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> Despite his successes, St Paul's cricket masters did not consider him a reliable cricketer; he was criticised for taking too many risks when batting and for experimenting with too many different styles while bowling. Fender's biographer, Richard Streeton, observes that &quot;Fender's experiments were frowned upon from his earliest days but that already there was never any shortage of ideas in his cricket thinking.&quot;<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>

<p>While at school, Fender spent his summers with his grandparents in Brighton,<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> which qualified him to play County Cricket for Sussex.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> When he left school in 1910, he attracted the interest of the club and, after success in both local cricket and second-team matches, he made his first-class debut on 21 July as an <a href="Amateur_status_in_first-class_cricket" title="wikilink">amateur</a> in Sussex's <a href="County_Championship" title="wikilink">County Championship</a> match against <a href="Nottinghamshire" class="uri" title="wikilink">Nottinghamshire</a>.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a><a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> He played one other game that season, against <a href="Worcestershire_County_Cricket_Club" title="wikilink">Worcestershire</a>, where he was shaken by the pace of two opposing bowlers.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> In the two games, Fender scored 19 runs and took one wicket.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
<p>After the 1910 cricket season, Fender worked in a paper mill in <a href="Horwich" class="uri" title="wikilink">Horwich</a>, Lancashire, to experience paper manufacturing&lt;U+2014&gt;his father's line of business&lt;U+2014&gt;at first hand. While feeding paper into a machine, his left hand was trapped in the mechanism and injured. Three of his fingers were crushed at the tips; upon healing, they remained stiff and numb for the rest of his life.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> Fender remained in Horwich at the start of the 1911 cricket season and played several times for <a href="Manchester_Cricket_Club" title="wikilink">Manchester Cricket Club</a>. He was on the verge of selection for <a href="Lancashire_County_Cricket_Club" title="wikilink">Lancashire</a> when he had to return to Brighton. That season he played twice for Sussex;<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> the following year, in his second match for the county, he scored his maiden first-class century, against <a href="Oxford_University_Cricket_Club" title="wikilink">Oxford University</a>. He followed this by taking five for 42 (five wickets taken and 42 runs conceded) against <a href="Surrey_County_Cricket_Club" title="wikilink">Surrey</a>. After these successes, Fender played regularly for the remainder of the 1912 season.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> In total, he scored 606 runs at an <a href="Batting_average_(cricket)" title="wikilink">average</a> of 24.24,<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> and, bowling <a href="Fast_bowling#Categorisation_of_fast_bowling" title="wikilink">medium pace</a>,<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> took 16 wickets at an <a href="Bowling_average" title="wikilink">average</a> of 25.50.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1913, Fender was a regular member of the Sussex county side. In the first two months of the season, he made a considerable impact; in 21 innings with the bat, he scored six fifties and one century.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> His reputation as an exciting, big-hitting batsman grew quickly,<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> and he was chosen in the representative <a href="Gentlemen_v_Players" title="wikilink">Gentlemen v Players</a> matches at Lord's and <a href="The_Oval" title="wikilink">The Oval</a>. His performances for the Gentlemen, a team of amateurs, were unsuccessful, and the failure affected his form for the rest of the season.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> <em><a href="Wisden_Cricketers&#39;_Almanack" title="wikilink">Wisden Cricketers' Almanack</a></em> commented that he was not worth his place in the team in these latter months.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> Even so, he reached 1,000 first-class runs in a season for the first time: 1,163 runs at an average of 23.73. He also took 34 wickets at 35.08.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a><a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="move-to-surrey">Move to Surrey</h3>
<p>Fender initially wanted to be a barrister, but his family could not afford the costs.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> By 1914, he was working for the firm of paper manufacturers and stationers of which his father was managing director. Although permitting Fender to play cricket, his father believed that sport and a business career were incompatible. Fender disagreed, suggesting that the contacts made in county cricket offset the lost working time.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> To aid his business career, Fender moved to London during the winter of 1913&lt;U+2013&gt;14. Fender was qualified by his birthplace to play for Surrey, and the county was happy to register him for the County Championship.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a><a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> Fender attended to business matters before and after each day's play, and often combined Surrey's trips to away matches with business meetings.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> Socially, Fender became a familiar figure in <a href="Gentlemen&#39;s_club" title="wikilink">clubs</a> and the theatre. He became friends with the actor <a href="Jack_Hulbert" title="wikilink">Jack Hulbert</a> and developed an interest in musical theatre, for which he provided financial support; he also wrote lyrics for some songs.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> By the end of the 1914 season, Fender had convinced his father that he could successfully combine cricket and business.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> His improvement as a cricketer was recognised when was chosen as one of <em>Wisden's</em> <a href="Wisden_Cricketers_of_the_Year" title="wikilink">Cricketers of the Year</a> for 1914.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a></p>
<p>As a player, Fender quickly made an impact for Surrey. He took a <a href="Hat_trick#Cricket" title="wikilink">hat-trick</a> in his second game, and scored a century in his fifth, to establish his popularity with the Surrey crowds.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> During the season Fender scored 820 runs, often very quickly, and took 83 wickets including some through experimenting with <a href="leg_spin" title="wikilink">leg spin</a> bowling.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a><a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a><a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> According to <em>Wisden</em> his worth was measured by more than figures: &quot;As a match winning factor he is a far greater force on a side than his records would suggest.&quot;<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> In a powerful Surrey side he batted aggressively, bowled more frequently than at Sussex&lt;U+2014&gt;mainly as a support bowler to the main attack&lt;U+2014&gt;and established a reputation as a <a href="Slip_(cricket)" title="wikilink">slip fielder</a>.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> A team-mate judged that Fender was the &quot;making&quot; of the team, and <em>Wisden</em> commented that &quot;he always seemed the right man in the right place&quot;.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a> A late replacement in the Gentlemen v Players game at Lord's, Fender was not particularly successful but made a good impression on critics.<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> The season ended prematurely because of the outbreak of war in August 1914. Surrey had established a commanding lead in the County Championship table; as their nearest challengers had no objection, the MCC declared them as county champions.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="career-in-wartime">Career in wartime</h3>
<p>Immediately following the cancellation of county cricket in 1914, Fender enlisted in the army, joining the <a href="Inns_of_Court_Regiment" title="wikilink">Inns of Court Regiment</a>. Commissioned as a <a href="lieutenant" class="uri" title="wikilink">lieutenant</a> in the <a href="Royal_Fusiliers" title="wikilink">Royal Fusiliers</a>, Fender disliked the routine of army life. With the help of the cricketer <a href="Pelham_Warner" title="wikilink">Pelham Warner</a>, who worked in the War Office, he was transferred to the <a href="Royal_Flying_Corps" title="wikilink">Royal Flying Corps</a> in 1915.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a> Fender was initially stationed in London, where he was involved in work repelling <a href="Zeppelin" class="uri" title="wikilink">Zeppelin</a> attacks, before being sent to India in 1916.<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a> Soon after his arrival, he became ill with <a href="dysentery" class="uri" title="wikilink">dysentery</a>, possibly <a href="cholera" class="uri" title="wikilink">cholera</a> and several other diseases. He returned to England to recover but was left weak for much of the following two years. Army doctors were unsure what exactly was wrong with Fender and he remained in their care until 1918. He played some charity cricket in 1917 and 1918, but did not return to light duties with the Royal Flying Corps until the latter year.<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a> Just as he seemed to have recovered fully, he fractured his left leg in five places playing <a href="Association_football" title="wikilink">football</a> at the end of 1918.<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a> He remained on crutches throughout the remainder of 1918 and 1919, missing the resumption of county cricket in 1919.{{#tag:ref|Fender played football regularly as a <a href="Goalkeeper_(association_football)" title="wikilink">goalkeeper</a>. He made appearances for several amateur clubs and in non-league games for <a href="Fulham_F.C." title="wikilink">Fulham</a>. In addition, he played while in Belgium. His most notable achievement was to play for the <a href="Casuals_F.C." title="wikilink">Casuals</a> in the <a href="AFA_Senior_Cup" title="wikilink">AFA Cup Final</a> in 1913, won 3&lt;U+2013&gt;2 by his team.<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a>|group=notes}}<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a> While incapacitated, Fender attempted to gain a place at <a href="Caius_College,_Cambridge" title="wikilink">Caius College, Cambridge</a> but was turned down owing to the restriction his injury placed upon his cricket, and his desire to concentrate on academic interests to further his business career&lt;U+2014&gt;the interviewing panel only wanted him as a cricketer.<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a> Although he recovered in time to play in the 1920 season, his leg troubled him for the remainder of his career; he was left with a minor limp, and long spells of fielding left him in pain.<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a></p>

<p>As an amateur, Fender was not paid for the tour, but some of his expenses were paid by the MCC. However, tours at the time often left many amateurs out of pocket. To offset their costs, Fender and his team-mate <a href="Rockley_Wilson" title="wikilink">Rockley Wilson</a> wrote for several newspapers and magazines during the tour. Their comments were criticised in Australia,<a href="#fn92" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref92"><sup>92</sup></a> particularly in the final Test when Wilson criticised the behaviour of the Australian spectators.<a href="#fn93" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref93"><sup>93</sup></a> Fender was barracked several times by the crowds when reports reached Australia of his newspaper columns;<a href="#fn94" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref94"><sup>94</sup></a> occasionally, the crowds chanted &quot;Please Go Home Fender&quot;, making a play on his initials; Fender made light of this, joining in by conducting the barrackers.<a href="#fn95" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref95"><sup>95</sup></a> In subsequent tours, the MCC forbade cricketers from writing about matches in which they were playing.<a href="#fn96" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref96"><sup>96</sup></a> On his way home, Fender wrote an account of the tour which was published as <em>Defending the Ashes</em>.

<p>Fender had greater success for Surrey in 1921. For the second year in succession Surrey played Middlesex in the final game of the season, to decide the County Championship, and again they lost. They finished second in the table, but were hampered by a lack of quality bowling. <em>Wisden</em> praised Fender's handling of his modest bowling resources, and stated that much of Surrey's success came from his captaincy.<a href="#fn106" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref106"><sup>106</sup></a> Several of Surrey's wins were very close, and came after Fender <a href="Declaration_and_forfeiture" title="wikilink">declared</a>.<a href="#fn107" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref107"><sup>107</sup></a> Fender included a <a href="Lob_bowling" title="wikilink">lob bowler</a>, <a href="Trevor_Molony" title="wikilink">Trevor Molony</a>, in three games; lob bowling had practically died out from first-class cricket, and Molony was the last specialist underarm bowler selected in county cricket.

Covering the tour as a journalist, Fender judged that Bradman &quot;was one of the most curious mixtures of good and bad batting I have ever seen&quot;,<a href="#fn179" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref179"><sup>179</sup></a> but was not convinced by his ability at the time.<a href="#fn180" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref180"><sup>180</sup></a> Bradman came to England with the Australian touring team in 1930, and was extremely successful;<a href="#fn181" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref181"><sup>181</sup></a> during the course of the season, Fender completely changed his mind&lt;U+2014&gt;not least when Bradman, particularly determined to succeed against Fender following his criticism, scored 252 against Surrey.<a href="#fn182" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref182"><sup>182</sup></a><a href="#fn183" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref183"><sup>183</sup></a> Fender played fewer matches than in previous seasons, as he was writing on the Tests for a newspaper;<a href="#fn184" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref184"><sup>184</sup></a><a href="#fn185" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref185"><sup>185</sup></a> in the 1930 season, he scored 700 runs and took 65 wickets.<a href="#fn186" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref186"><sup>186</sup></a><a href="#fn187" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref187"><sup>187</sup></a> Meanwhile, the Australian victory in the Test series owed much to Bradman, who scored 974 runs in seven innings, breaking several records in the process.<a href="#fn188" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref188"><sup>188</sup></a> His success, and the manner of it, concerned the English authorities,<a href="#fn189" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref189"><sup>189</sup></a> and Fender among others believed that success against Bradman was to be found in adopting new tactics.<a href="#fn190" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref190"><sup>190</sup></a> In his newspaper reports that summer, Fender was critical of Bradman's batting during one spell in the final Test when he batted unconvincingly against fast bowler <a href="Harold_Larwood" title="wikilink">Harold Larwood</a> on a pitch affected by rain.<a href="#fn191" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref191"><sup>191</sup></a> Fender passed this information on to his Surrey colleague <a href="Douglas_Jardine" title="wikilink">Douglas Jardine</a>, who was later named England captain for the MCC tour of 1932&lt;U+2013&gt;33.<a href="#fn192" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref192"><sup>192</sup></a> Over the following months, Australian journalists kept Fender informed of developments in batting in that country, information which he passed on to Jardine.<a href="#fn193" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref193"><sup>193</sup></a> Jardine later conceived the strategy of <a href="Bodyline" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bodyline</a>, where fast bowlers bowled at the batsmen's <a href="leg_stump" title="wikilink">leg stump</a>, frequently pitching the ball short and hitting him. The tactic was contentious, and created much ill-feeling between the players.<a href="#fn194" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref194"><sup>194</sup></a><a href="#fn195" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref195"><sup>195</sup></a> Fender did not cover the tour as a journalist, as his newspaper sent <a href="Jack_Hobbs" title="wikilink">Jack Hobbs</a> instead.<a href="#fn196" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref196"><sup>196</sup></a> However, during the tour Jardine wrote to inform Fender that much of his information had been correct and that he was adapting his tactics accordingly.<a href="#fn197" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref197"><sup>197</sup></a> Fender later insisted that his role was minor in creating the strategy, but he was close to both Jardine and Arthur Carr, who discussed the plans before the tour began; some writers suggested that the original idea was Fender's.<a href="#fn198" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref198"><sup>198</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="resignation-and-retirement">Resignation and retirement</h3>
<p>Early in 1931 Fender offered to resign as Surrey's captain, to give Jardine more experience of leadership before he assumed the England captaincy, but Surrey declined.<a href="#fn199" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref199"><sup>199</sup></a> Fender scored 916 runs and took 84 wickets that season.<a href="#fn200" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref200"><sup>200</sup></a><a href="#fn201" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref201"><sup>201</sup></a> However, the Surrey committee were becoming disillusioned with Fender as captain after he had missed matches in 1930 to work as a journalist.<a href="#fn202" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref202"><sup>202</sup></a> Another point of contention was that Fender, against the wishes of the committee, preferred to keep in-form professional players in the team instead of playing amateurs when they were available. There were disagreements over expenses, and the committee disapproved when Fender declared Surrey's innings closed after one ball, to make up time in a rain-affected match.<a href="#fn203" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref203"><sup>203</sup></a> A series of other controversial incidents further antagonised the committee.<a href="#fn204" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref204"><sup>204</sup></a> As a result, Fender was dismissed in January 1932, a move rumoured in the press for some time and which was quickly leaked.<a href="#fn205" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref205"><sup>205</sup></a> The club released a statement which said Fender would only stand down if a suitable replacement could be found, before Jardine was officially appointed in March.<a href="#fn206" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref206"><sup>206</sup></a> It is likely that the uncertainty arose because Jardine took his time in accepting the position.<a href="#fn207" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref207"><sup>207</sup></a> Fender supported Jardine's appointment, and pledged to continue playing under his captaincy.<a href="#fn208" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref208"><sup>208</sup></a></p>
<p>Fender played less frequently in the following seasons, as his appearances were restricted by journalistic and business requirements.<a href="#fn209" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref209"><sup>209</sup></a> He scored over 400 runs in each season between 1932 and 1935 and scored two centuries in that time, both in 1933.<a href="#fn210" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref210"><sup>210</sup></a> With the ball, he took over 60 wickets in each season, although with higher bowling averages than earlier in his career.<a href="#fn211" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref211"><sup>211</sup></a> Having played regularly for the Gentlemen against the Players throughout his career, he made his last appearance in the match in 1934.<a href="#fn212" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref212"><sup>212</sup></a> He continued to be an effective member of the county team,<a href="#fn213" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref213"><sup>213</sup></a> which he occasionally led when the regular captain&lt;U+2014&gt;initially Jardine, later, <a href="Errol_Holmes" title="wikilink">Errol Holmes</a>&lt;U+2014&gt;was absent.<a href="#fn214" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref214"><sup>214</sup></a><a href="#fn215" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref215"><sup>215</sup></a> Prior to the 1936 season Holmes suggested to Fender that he should play fewer games for Surrey that year. Rather than do so, Fender preferred not to play at all, and he informed the committee that he would no longer represent the county.<a href="#fn216" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref216"><sup>216</sup></a> The committee publicly thanked Fender, but the reasons for the sudden termination of his county career are unclear; rumours suggested that some factions at Surrey wanted Fender out of the club.<a href="#fn217" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref217"><sup>217</sup></a> In the event, Fender played two first-class matches in 1936, captaining MCC teams against Oxford and <a href="Cambridge_University_Cricket_Club" title="wikilink">Cambridge</a> universities;<a href="#fn218" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref218"><sup>218</sup></a> these were his final appearances in first-class cricket.<a href="#fn219" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref219"><sup>219</sup></a> In all first-class matches, he scored 19,034 runs at an average of 26.65, and took 1,894 wickets at 25.05.<a href="#fn220" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref220"><sup>220</sup></a> He continued to play minor cricket for some time, and maintained his association with cricket for many years. His most notable appearance came after the war, when he captained an &quot;Old England XI&quot;, featuring many former England players, against Surrey in 1946 in a match to celebrate Surrey's centenary.<a href="#fn221" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref221"><sup>221</sup></a></p>
<p>During the Second World War, Fender joined the <a href="Royal_Air_Force" title="wikilink">Royal Air Force</a>. He worked in southern England with a responsibility for moving men and equipment, and was mentioned in dispatches for his role in preparations for <a href="Operation_Overlord" title="wikilink">the Allied invasion of Europe</a>. Later, he was posted to various parts of the world in his role in movements.<a href="#fn222" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref222"><sup>222</sup></a></p>
<p>In the 1920s, Fender was approached four times to stand for <a href="Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom" title="wikilink">Parliament</a> as a <a href="Conservative_Party_(UK)" title="wikilink">Conservative Party candidate</a> and declined each time.<a href="#fn223" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref223"><sup>223</sup></a> Between 1952 and 1958, he served as a Conservative member on the <a href="London_County_Council" title="wikilink">London County Council</a> and later was appointed <a href="Deputy_Lieutenant" title="wikilink">Deputy Lieutenant</a> of London.<a href="#fn224" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref224"><sup>224</sup></a> In the late 1970s, Fender became blind, and moved in with his daughter, although continuing to run his business. He attended celebrations in Australia to mark 100 years of Test cricket and was the oldest man there.<a href="#fn225" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref225"><sup>225</sup></a><a href="#fn226" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref226"><sup>226</sup></a> In his final years, he moved into a nursing home and died there on 15 June 1985.<a href="#fn227" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref227"><sup>227</sup></a></p>

<p>Originally a fast-medium bowler&lt;U+2014&gt;a style to which he sometimes reverted when Surrey were short of bowlers&lt;U+2014&gt;Fender's main bowling style was wrist spin, and he could spin the ball effectively.<a href="#fn236" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref236"><sup>236</sup></a><a href="#fn237" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref237"><sup>237</sup></a> He gripped the ball differently from most wrist spinners, using his thumb and first two fingers, and would attempt any kind of unorthodox delivery if he thought it might be effective.<a href="#fn238" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref238"><sup>238</sup></a> To deceive the batsman he varied the position from which he bowled and the height of his arm, and occasionally bowled deliberate <a href="full_toss" title="wikilink">full tosses</a> or <a href="long_hop" title="wikilink">long hops</a> to surprise them.<a href="#fn239" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref239"><sup>239</sup></a> Fender hoped that, in his eagerness to score from an apparently innocuous ball, the batsman would mis-hit,<a href="#fn240" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref240"><sup>240</sup></a> a tactic he would often try when the batsman was playing defensively.<a href="#fn241" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref241"><sup>241</sup></a> Fender's love of experimentation and his surprise variations made him difficult for batsmen to face, but produced inconsistent results and he sometimes conceded many runs.<a href="#fn242" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref242"><sup>242</sup></a><a href="#fn243" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref243"><sup>243</sup></a> His <em>Wisden</em> obituary suggests that Fender would have been better employed as a &quot;fourth or fifth bowler in a strong bowling side&quot;, but Surrey's weakness in bowling meant that he had to do far more work than was ideal for his style and approach.<a href="#fn244" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref244"><sup>244</sup></a> Despite his experimentation, critics regarded him as a reliable bowler using his primary method,<a href="#fn245" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref245"><sup>245</sup></a> and <em>The Times</em> described him as &quot;subtle in flight and with artful variations&quot;.<a href="#fn246" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref246"><sup>246</sup></a></p>
<p>Fender fielded mainly at <a href="Slip_(cricket)" title="wikilink">slip</a>. He possessed quick reactions and could move quickly to catch balls hit some distance from him.<a href="#fn247" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref247"><sup>247</sup></a> His technique was unorthodox; he crouched low when waiting for the ball with one leg stretched behind him, like a sprinter ready to begin a race. Good catching was vital in a Surrey side which possessed weak bowling, making his contributions even more important,<a href="#fn248" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref248"><sup>248</sup></a> and critics regarded him as one of the best slip fielders in England.<a href="#fn249" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref249"><sup>249</sup></a></p>
<p>The journalist and cricket writer <a href="John_Arlott" title="wikilink">John Arlott</a> wrote of Fender: &quot;Unmistakable on the field, lanky, bespectacled, curly-haired, slouching along, hands deep in pockets and wearing a grotesquely long sweater, he was immortalised by cartoonist <a href="Tom_Webster_(cartoonist)" title="wikilink">Tom Webster</a>&quot;.<a href="#fn250" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref250"><sup>250</sup></a> This appearance made him a favourite of cartoonists generally,<a href="#fn251" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref251"><sup>251</sup></a> and Fender enjoyed this fame, particularly the cartoons of Webster who drew Fender in a long sweater before he ever wore one; Fender then adopted them to match his image. Similarly, he continued to wear glasses on the field after discovering that he did not need them.<a href="#fn252" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref252"><sup>252</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="captaincy">Captaincy</h3>
<p>Contemporary critics believed that Fender's handling of a limited bowling side while Surrey captain in the 1920s, and his achievements in taking the county to high positions in the County Championship,<a href="#fn253" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref253"><sup>253</sup></a> made him the best captain in England.<a href="#fn254" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref254"><sup>254</sup></a><a href="#fn255" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref255"><sup>255</sup></a> Team-mates and opponents praised his captaincy skills, and described him as the best they had known.<a href="#fn256" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref256"><sup>256</sup></a><a href="#fn257" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref257"><sup>257</sup></a> His <em>Times</em> obituary stated: &quot;[Fender] was a sharp captain, quick to observe the slightest opportunity of advantage and ready to gamble on his ability to exploit it. His keen eye for weakness in an opponent and ability to extract and employ the best powers of his own players caused him often, and with reason, to be described as the best county captain who never captained England. No more flexible thinker on cricket ever lived.&quot;<a href="#fn258" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref258"><sup>258</sup></a> Always willing to take risks in order to win,<a href="#fn259" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref259"><sup>259</sup></a> Fender's main objective was to surprise the opposition; legends grew of his successful ploys.<a href="#fn260" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref260"><sup>260</sup></a> Prior to Fender, few county captains displayed tactical imagination; Fender inspired his teams to play forceful, entertaining cricket which made him and his Surrey team very popular.<a href="#fn261" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref261"><sup>261</sup></a> His leadership was often specifically commented on by the press, an unusual occurrence in county cricket reports. In particular, his declarations often were the subject of attention and controversy&lt;U+2014&gt;he often declared, contrary to orthodox tactics at the time, before his side had built up a big lead or even before they reached the opposition's first innings total.<a href="#fn262" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref262"><sup>262</sup></a> One of his favoured approaches was for the batsmen in the <a href="Batting_order_(cricket)#Middle_order" title="wikilink">lower middle-order</a> to hit out at the bowling, no matter the state of the match; if successful, the team either quickly consolidated a position of strength or regained the initiative if earlier batsmen had failed.<a href="#fn263" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref263"><sup>263</sup></a> Fender also used non-regular bowlers in an attempt to unsettle batsmen.<a href="#fn264" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref264"><sup>264</sup></a> His innovative approach included the introduction of caps with larger peaks to shade his players' eyes from the sun, and he recruited a baseball coach to improve their throwing.<a href="#fn265" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref265"><sup>265</sup></a></p>
<p>Although often a candidate in the press to captain England, Fender was never chosen to do so. Rumours circulated at the time about the reasons. One suggestion was that he was overlooked because he was Jewish,<a href="#fn266" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref266"><sup>266</sup></a><a href="#fn267" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref267"><sup>267</sup></a> but Fender said he was not Jewish and in any case did not believe this would have been a problem. Other purported reasons included that he had not been to Oxford or Cambridge, and that he was in the wine trade, which was considered an unsuitable career for a gentleman, but in later life Fender dismissed these as potential factors.<a href="#fn268" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref268"><sup>268</sup></a> In fact, not everyone approved of Fender's captaincy. He was sometimes accused of gamesmanship, for example by persuading umpires that conditions were unfit for play until they favoured his team. He occasionally used negative tactics when he was unhappy with the approach of the opposition&lt;U+2014&gt;in one game where the opposition had not declared, he slowed down play to the extent that one over took 12 minutes to bowl.<a href="#fn269" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref269"><sup>269</sup></a> Opponents recalled other uses of time-wasting tactics, deliberate damaging of the pitch by Surrey players to assist their bowlers, and intimidation of both the opposition and umpires.<a href="#fn270" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref270"><sup>270</sup></a> The cricket writer Martin Williamson suggests that &quot;in an era where gentlemen played by the rules, Fender was adroit at stretching the Laws to snapping point.&quot;<a href="#fn271" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref271"><sup>271</sup></a> Fender's attitude towards amateurs also brought him into opposition with others. His disinclination to play amateurs in the Surrey team unless they were talented enough was opposed by the Surrey committee&lt;U+2014&gt;the Surrey president, <a href="H._D._G._Leveson_Gower" title="wikilink">H. D. G.

<h2 id="cricket-journalism">Cricket journalism</h2>
<p>While still a cricketer, Fender wrote for several London newspapers and magazines, and also broadcast on the radio.<a href="#fn286" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref286"><sup>286</sup></a> Although remaining in England, he commented on the 1924&lt;U+2013&gt;25 Ashes series for the <em><a href="Sunday_Express" title="wikilink">Sunday Express</a></em> and became involved in an argument which arose during the tour over the merits of professional captaincy; Fender believed professionals would make good captains.<a href="#fn287" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref287"><sup>287</sup></a> He also wrote about the 1926 series, and drew criticism from Australians when he called their sportsmanship into question.<a href="#fn288" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref288"><sup>288</sup></a> He later wrote regularly for the <a href="The_Evening_News_(London_newspaper)" title="wikilink"><em>Evening News</em></a> and <a href="The_Star_(London)" title="wikilink"><em>The Star</em></a>;<a href="#fn289" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref289"><sup>289</sup></a><a href="#fn290" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref290"><sup>290</sup></a> to the irritation of other journalists, he became the first man to use a typewriter in the press box.<a href="#fn291" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref291"><sup>291</sup></a></p>
<p>Fender wrote four books on cricket tours: his 1920&lt;U+2013&gt;21 account <em>Defending the Ashes</em>, an account of the 1928&lt;U+2013&gt;29 tour which he covered as a journalist, and books about the 1930 and 1934 Australian tours of England.

<p>Fender worked for his father up until the outbreak of war in 1914,<a href="#fn298" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref298"><sup>298</sup></a> but when he returned from active service found the business frustrating.

The business thrived, in part owing to Fender's wide range of connections, and he remained chairman and managing director until 1976.<a href="#fn299" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref299"><sup>299</sup></a> For a time, Fender produced his own whiskey brand, which he tried to sell when touring South Africa with the MCC in 1922&lt;U+2013&gt;23, but competition from the larger distilling companies meant that it was a short-lived success.<a href="#fn300" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref300"><sup>300</sup></a> After the Second World War, he had to rebuild his wine firm, which had suffered from wartime restrictions and hardships, this time assisted by his son.<a href="#fn301" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref301"><sup>301</sup></a> He and Robert also established a paper merchants called Fender Brothers, although he later relinquished his shares in the company. Meanwhile, he maintained his connections with Crescens Robinson and followed his father as chairman of the company from 1943 to 1968.<a href="#fn302" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref302"><sup>302</sup></a></p>
<p>The press closely followed Fender's activities in his personal life, reporting his activities at dances, races and <a href="Hunting#Shooting" title="wikilink">shooting</a>. As such, he had a high profile, and was easily recognisable to the general public.<a href="#fn303" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref303"><sup>303</sup></a> In September 1924, he married Ruth Clapham, a well-known figure in <a href="High_society_(group)" title="wikilink">society</a> and the daughter of a Manchester jeweller, whom he met in Monte Carlo in 1923.<a href="#fn304" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref304"><sup>304</sup></a> The couple had two children;<a href="#fn305" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref305"><sup>305</sup></a> Ruth died suddenly in 1937 from <a href="Bright&#39;s_disease" title="wikilink">Bright's disease</a>.<a href="#fn306" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref306"><sup>306</sup></a> Fender remarried in 1962, but his second wife, Susan Gordon, died in 1968.<a href="#fn307" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref307"><sup>307</sup></a></p>
