It incorporated parts of Western Armenia mainly, <a href="Erzurum" class="uri" title="wikilink">Erzurum</a>, <a href="Trabzon" class="uri" title="wikilink">Trabzon</a>, <a href="Bitlis" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bitlis</a>, and <a href="Van_Province" title="wikilink">Van Province</a>. Also extending the <a href="western_Armenia" title="wikilink">western Armenia</a> to the north in securing the <a href="Democratic_Republic_of_Armenia" title="wikilink">Democratic Republic of Armenia</a> an outlet to the <a href="Black_Sea" title="wikilink">Black Sea</a> at the port of <a href="Trabzon" class="uri" title="wikilink">Trabzon</a> was included. S&lt;U+00E8&gt;vres Treaty was recognized by both <a href="Armenia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Armenia</a> and <a href="Ottoman_Empire" title="wikilink">Ottoman Empire</a>, but was never put to motion. As it was replaced by <a href="Treaty_of_Lausanne" title="wikilink">Treaty of Lausanne</a> mainly after <a href="Turkish-Armenian_War" title="wikilink">Turkish-Armenian War</a>, which this treaty is still not accepted by <a href="Armenia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Armenia</a>.</p>
<h2 id="negotiations">Negotiations</h2>

<p>During the <a href="Conference_of_London" title="wikilink">Conference of London</a>, <a href="David_Lloyd_George" title="wikilink">David Lloyd George</a> encouraged Wilson to accept a mandate for Anatolia, and particularly with the support of <a href="Armenian_diaspora" title="wikilink">Armenian diaspora</a> for the provinces claimed by Administration for Western Armenia. Wilson send two commissions (<a href="King-Crane_Commission" title="wikilink">King-Crane Commission</a> and General <a href="James_Harbord" title="wikilink">James Harbord</a>) to understand what is behind the claims of <a href="Armenian_national_liberation_movement" title="wikilink">Armenian national liberation movement</a>, and if these claims fit to <a href="Fourteen_Points" title="wikilink">Fourteen Points</a>.</p>
<h3 id="historical-lands">Historical lands</h3>
<p><a href="King-Crane_Commission" title="wikilink">King-Crane Commission</a> tackled the issue of whether there should be an Armenian state, or if it should be under US mandate. <a href="James_Harbord" title="wikilink">James Harbord</a> hold the position that he would not recommend a division, which might bring other problems. Harbord's report stated that &quot;the temptation to reprisals for past wrongs&quot; would make it extremely difficult to maintain peace in the region. <a href="King-Crane_Commission" title="wikilink">King-Crane Commission</a> came to the conclusion that there should be one. While one explanation might be mere favoritism, the arguments used for an Armenian state are quite similar to later arguments for the existence of Israel after World War II.</p>
<h3 id="autonomous-development">Autonomous development</h3>
<p>The report noted that the Armenians had suffered a traumatic experience, that they couldn't trust the Ottoman Empire to respect their rights anymore, and that they were &quot;a people.&quot; Therefore, Armenian independence which was established under very hard conditions during the <a href="Caucasus_Campaign" title="wikilink">Caucasus Campaign</a> should be respected by international community and insured by the allies. Armenian independence should be respected as, <a href="Armenian_Resistance" title="wikilink">Armenian Resistance</a> and <a href="Administration_for_Western_Armenia" title="wikilink">Administration for Western Armenia</a> was already developed the mechanisms under the leadership of <a href="Aram_Manuguan" title="wikilink">Aram Manuguan</a>, that should be part of <a href="Democratic_Republic_of_Armenia" title="wikilink">Democratic Republic of Armenia</a>.</p>
<h2 id="treaty-of-su00e8vres">Treaty of S&lt;U+00E8&gt;vres</h2>

<p>The <a href="Woodrow_Wilson" title="wikilink">Woodrow Wilson</a> agreed to transfer what will be named as <strong>&quot;Wilsonian Armenia&quot;</strong> back to the Armenians in the <a href="Treaty_of_S&lt;U+00E8&gt;vres" title="wikilink">Treaty of S&lt;U+00E8&gt;vres</a>. Armenia claimed to be tolerant of minorities (Muslims). President Wilson&lt;U+2019&gt;s acceptance letter (for drawing the frontier), to the Paris Peace Conference in 1919 said: &quot;The world expects of them (the Armenians), that they give every encouragement and help within their power to those Turkish refugees who may desire to return to their former homes in the districts of <a href="Trabzon" title="wikilink">Trebizond</a>, <a href="Erzurum" title="wikilink">Erzerum</a>, <a href="Van" class="uri" title="wikilink">Van</a> and <a href="Bitlis" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bitlis</a> remembering that these peoples, too, have suffered greatly.&quot; <a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> Today, as a continuation of the initial goal, the creation of a free, independent, and united Armenia; all territories designated as <a href="Wilsonian_Armenia" title="wikilink">Wilsonian Armenia</a> by the <a href="Treaty_of_S&lt;U+00E8&gt;vres" title="wikilink">Treaty of S&lt;U+00E8&gt;vres</a> as well as the regions of Artsakh, Javakhk, and Nakhichevan, is the first goal of the <a href="Armenian_Revolutionary_Federation" title="wikilink">Armenian Revolutionary Federation</a><a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="aftermath">Aftermath</h2>
<p>As the coming months had shown, <a href="King-Crane_Commission" title="wikilink">King-Crane Commission</a> did not really analyze the situation. Some sources even claim they did not even spend enough time. The realities of the ground were different, and they were not included in the report. <a href="Treaty_of_Alexandropol" title="wikilink">Treaty of Alexandropol</a> and then the <a href="treaty_of_Kars" title="wikilink">treaty of Kars</a> were the first blockage to this idea and than with the following months <a href="Treaty_of_S&lt;U+00E8&gt;vres" title="wikilink">Treaty of S&lt;U+00E8&gt;vres</a> put to shelf as it was superseded by <a href="treaty_of_Lausanne" title="wikilink">treaty of Lausanne</a>. The <a href="Armenian_national_liberation_movement" title="wikilink">Armenian national liberation movement</a> fight for &quot;<a href="Administration_for_Western_Armenia" title="wikilink">Administration for Western Armenia</a>&quot; being somewhat part of the newly established republic droped from the table.</p>
