<p><strong>Nicholas John Griffin</strong> (born 1 March 1959) is a British politician, chairman of the <a href="far_right" title="wikilink">far right</a> <a href="British_National_Party" title="wikilink">British National Party</a> and a Member of the <a href="European_Parliament" title="wikilink">European Parliament</a> for <a href="North_West_England_(European_Parliament_constituency)" title="wikilink">North West England</a>. He is married with four children, and lives in Wales.</p>
<p>Griffin was born in Barnet, London, and was educated in Suffolk. He joined the <a href="British_National_Front" title="wikilink">National Front</a> aged 15, and following his graduation from <a href="Cambridge_University" title="wikilink">Cambridge University</a> became a political worker for the party. In 1980 he became a member of its governing body, and later wrote articles for right-wing magazines. He was the party's candidate for the seat of <a href="Croydon_North_West_(UK_Parliament_constituency)" title="wikilink">Croydon North West</a> in 1981 and 1983. Griffin left the National Front in 1989, and in 1995 joined the British National Party, becoming its leader in 1999. He stood as the party's candidate in several elections, and in 2009 was elected as a member of the European Parliament for North West England in the <a href="European_Parliament_election,_2009" title="wikilink">2009 European Elections</a>.</p>
<p>In 1998 Griffin was convicted of distributing material likely to incite racial hatred, for which he received a suspended prison sentence. He was charged in 2005 with inciting racial hatred, but following a retrial was cleared. Griffin has been criticised for his comments on political and religious matters, his <a href="Holocaust_denial" title="wikilink">Holocaust denial</a> and anti-semitic articles, although since becoming leader of the BNP he has distanced himself from these opinions. He is a strong critic of aspects of Islam. Over the years several educational institutions have invited him to speak on matters including political radicalism, multiculturalism, and BNP policy.</p>

<p>Following his graduation, Griffin became a political worker at the National Front headquarters.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> As a teenager he had accompanied his father to a <a href="British_National_Front" title="wikilink">National Front</a> meeting,<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a><a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> and by 1978, he was a national organiser for the party.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> He helped set up the White Noise Music Club in 1979,<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> and several years later worked with <a href="white_power_skinhead" title="wikilink">white power skinhead</a> band, <a href="Skrewdriver" class="uri" title="wikilink">Skrewdriver</a>.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> In 1980 he became a member of the party's governing body, the National Directorate, and in the same year launched <em>Nationalism Today</em> with the aid of <a href="Joseph_Pearce" title="wikilink">Joe Pearce</a>, then editor of the NF youth paper <em>Bulldog</em>.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a><a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> As a member of the National Front Griffin contested the seat of Croydon North West twice, in 1981 and 1983.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a></p>
<p>The National Front had, since the election of the <a href="Conservative_Party_(UK)" title="wikilink">Conservatives</a> under <a href="Margaret_Thatcher" title="wikilink">Margaret Thatcher</a>, seen a distinct drop in its membership. As a result the party became more radicalised, and a dissatisfied Griffin, along with fellow NF activists <a href="Derek_Holland" title="wikilink">Derek Holland</a> and <a href="Patrick_Harrington" title="wikilink">Patrick Harrington</a>, began to embrace the ideals of Italian fascist <a href="Roberto_Fiore" title="wikilink">Roberto Fiore</a> (Fiore had arrived in the UK in 1980). By 1983 the group had broken away to form the NF <a href="Political_Soldier" title="wikilink">Political Soldier</a> faction, which advocated a revival of country &quot;values&quot;, and a return to feudalism with the establishment of nationalist communes.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> Writing for <em>Bulldog</em> in 1985, Griffin praised the black separatist <a href="Louis_Farrakhan" title="wikilink">Louis Farrakhan</a>,<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> comments which were unpopular with some members of the party.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> He also attempted to form alliances with Libya's <a href="Colonel_Gadaffi" title="wikilink">Colonel Gadaffi</a>, and Iran's <a href="Ayatollah_Khomeini" title="wikilink">Ayatollah Khomeini</a>,<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> and praised the efforts of Welsh nationalist movement <a href="Meibion_Glynd&lt;U+0175&gt;r" title="wikilink">Meibion Glynd&lt;U+0175&gt;r</a>.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a></p>
<p>Following a disagreement with Harrington (who subsequently formed the <a href="Third_Way_(UK)" title="wikilink">Third Way</a>), and objections over the direction the party was headed, in 1989 Griffin left the National Front. Along with Holland and Fiore,<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> he helped form the <a href="International_Third_Position" title="wikilink">International Third Position</a> (ITP), a development of the Political Soldier movement,<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> but left the organisation in 1990.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> In the same year he lost his left eye in an accident caused by a discarded shotgun cartridge exploding in a pile of burning wood at his home,<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a><a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> since when he has worn a glass eye. The accident left him unable to work, and owing to other financial problems he subsequently declared bankruptcy (the accident occurred in France, where he later lost money in a failed business project).<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> For several years thereafter, he abstained from politics, his parents giving him financial support. He later stewarded a public <a href="Holocaust_denial" title="wikilink">Holocaust denial</a> meeting hosted by <a href="David_Irving" title="wikilink">David Irving</a>.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a><a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="section">1993â€“1999</h3>
<p>Griffin re-entered politics in 1993<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> and in 1995, at the behest of <a href="John_Tyndall_(politician)" title="wikilink">John Tyndall</a>, joined the <a href="British_National_Party" title="wikilink">British National Party</a>.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a><a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> He also became editor of two right-wing magazines owned by Tyndall, <em>Spearhead</em>, and <em>The Rune</em>.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> Referring to the election of the BNP's first councillor at a 1993 council by-election in <a href="Millwall" class="uri" title="wikilink">Millwall</a>, in the <a href="London_Borough_of_Tower_Hamlets" title="wikilink">London Borough of Tower Hamlets</a>, he wrote:</p>

<p>Although Tyndall had in 1982 founded the BNP, its links to extremism helped Griffin in his 1999 campaign to replace Tyndall as BNP leader. Griffin embarked on a campaign to make the party electable by taking it away from Tyndall's extremist agenda. He was helped by Tyndall's lack of familiarity with the mainstream media, and in the party's September election he defeated Tyndall to become head of the BNP. One of Griffin's changes included the party's strong emphasis on the removal of multiculturalism, a policy it claims has a destructive influence on both immigrant and British cultures.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a><a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> This realignment was designed to position the BNP alongside successful European far-right groups, such as the French <em><a href="National_Front_(France)" title="wikilink">Front National</a></em>. Street protests were replaced by electoral campaigning, and some policies were moderated (the compulsory repatriation of ethnic minorities was instead made voluntary). Other policies included the introduction of capital punishment for paedophiles, rapists, drug dealers and murderers, and corporal punishment for less serious crimes such as juvenile delinquency. Voters found his background as a Cambridge-educated family man more palatable than the extreme image presented by Tyndall.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="section-1">2000â€“2009</h3>
<p>In addition to his earlier candidacies for the National Front, Griffin has stood as the BNP candidate in several English elections. In 2000 he stood as the BNP candidate for the constituency of <a href="West_Bromwich_West_(UK_Parliament_constituency)" title="wikilink">West Bromwich West</a>, in a by-election triggered by the resignation of <a href="Betty_Boothroyd" title="wikilink">Betty Boothroyd</a>. He came in fourth place, with 794Â votes (4.21% of those cast).<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> Following the <a href="2001_Oldham_race_riots" title="wikilink">Oldham race riots</a> he was the BNP candidate for the constituency of <a href="Oldham_West_and_Royton_(UK_Parliament_constituency)" title="wikilink">Oldham West and Royton</a> in the <a href="United_Kingdom_general_election,_2001" title="wikilink">United Kingdom general election, 2001</a>. He received 6,552Â votes (16% of those cast), beating the <a href="Liberal_Democrats" title="wikilink">Liberal Democrats</a> to third place and running a close race for second place with the <a href="Conservative_Party_(UK)" title="wikilink">Conservatives</a>, who received 7,076Â votes.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a><a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> He again stood for election in the <a href="Oldham_Council_election,_2003" title="wikilink">Oldham Council election, 2003</a>, for a seat representing the <a href="Chadderton" class="uri" title="wikilink">Chadderton</a> North ward.

Griffin claimed that he knew the identity of the individual responsible, describing him as a hard-line senior employee who had left the party in the previous year. He welcomed the publicity that the story generated, using it to describe the common perception of the average BNP member as a &quot;skinhead <a href="wikt:oik#English" title="wikilink">oik</a>&quot; as untrue.<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a></p>
<p>He was elected as a member of the European Parliament for <a href="North_West_England" title="wikilink">North West England</a> in the <a href="European_Parliament_election,_2009" title="wikilink">2009 European Elections</a>.

A second venue was chosen on the following day, at a public house near Manchester. A line of police blocked a large group of protesters, who chanted &quot;No platform for Nazi Nick&quot; and &quot;Nazi scum off our streets&quot;. Griffin viewed the result as an important victory, claiming that his party had been demonised and blocked from holding public meetings. &quot;In Oldham alone there have been hundreds of thousands of pounds spent on employing bogus community workers to keep us out. To triumph against that level of pressure as a political party has never been done before.&quot;<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a></p>

The invitation prompted objections from several organisations and public figures, including the Mayor of London <a href="Boris_Johnson" title="wikilink">Boris Johnson</a>, and the anti-fascist organisation <a href="Searchlight" class="uri" title="wikilink">Searchlight</a>.<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a> Griffin later declined the invitation, saying he had &quot;no wish to embarrass the Queen&quot;.<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a></p>


<p>He recently appealed for &lt;U+00A3&gt;150,000 of extra funding for the BNP. In a letter written to party activists, he said that the party's ailing fortunes were a direct result of &quot;attacks on the party&quot;.<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a> He also defended questions by the <a href="Electoral_Commission" title="wikilink">Electoral Commission</a> about the transparency of BNP funding, as only donations in excess of &lt;U+00A3&gt;5,000 need to be registered.<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a></p>

<h3 id="section-2">1998</h3>
<p>In 1998, Griffin was convicted of violating section 19 of the <a href="Public_Order_Act_1986" title="wikilink">Public Order Act 1986</a>, relating to the offence of 'publishing or distributing racially inflammatory written material' in issue 12 of <em>The Rune</em>, published in 1996.

<h3 id="section-3">2004â€“2006</h3>
<p>On 14Â December 2004 Griffin was arrested at his home in Wales, on suspicion of incitement to racial hatred, over remarks he made about Islam in an undercover BBC documentary titled <em>The Secret Agent</em>.<a href="#fn70" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a><a href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a> He was questioned at a police station in <a href="Halifax,_West_Yorkshire" title="wikilink">Halifax, West Yorkshire</a>, before being freed on police bail. He said that the arrest was &quot;an electoral scam to get the Muslim block vote back to the Labour party&quot;,<a href="#fn72" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref72"><sup>72</sup></a> and also claimed that the Labour government was attempting to influence the results of the following year's general election.<a href="#fn73" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref73"><sup>73</sup></a></p>
<p>Griffin's arrest was preceded two days earlier by that of John Tyndall, and the arrests of several other people, over remarks they had made in the same programme.<a href="#fn74" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref74"><sup>74</sup></a> The police had begun an investigation into the contents of the programme the day after it was broadcast on 15Â July 2004. The following April he was charged with four offences of using words or behaviour intended or likely to stir up racial hatred.<a href="#fn75" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref75"><sup>75</sup></a> The trial began in January 2006. Griffin stood alongside fellow party activist <a href="Mark_Collett" title="wikilink">Mark Collett</a>, who faced similar charges. Prosecuting, Rodney Jameson QC told the jury of a total of six speeches that both accused had made in the Reservoir Tavern in Keighley on 19Â January 2004. Reading excerpts from them, he claimed that they included threatening, abusive and insulting words directed at &quot;people of Asian ethnicity&quot;, with the intention of &quot;stirring up racial hatred&quot;.<a href="#fn76" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref76"><sup>76</sup></a></p>
<p>Griffin was also accused of calling murdered black teenager <a href="Stephen_Lawrence" title="wikilink">Stephen Lawrence</a> a drug dealer and bully who stole younger pupils' dinner money, in an apparent rejection of the supposed racist nature of the teenager's death.<a href="#fn77" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref77"><sup>77</sup></a> In the witness box he defended himself by quoting passages from the Qur'an, backing his argument that his comments describing Islam as a &quot;vicious, wicked faith&quot; were attacking not a race, but a religion. During the two-week trial he also used a laptop to post daily updates on a blog on the BNP's website.<a href="#fn78" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref78"><sup>78</sup></a></p>

<h2 id="public-debates">Public debates</h2>
<p>Since his election as BNP leader, Griffin has been invited to participate in debates at several university institutions. In November 2002 the <a href="Cambridge_Union_Society" title="wikilink">Cambridge Union Society</a> invited him to take part in a debate the following January. Titled &quot;This house believes that Islam is a threat to the west&quot;, the move was controversial; amongst more moderate speakers, one of those invited was <a href="Abu_Hamza_al-Masri" title="wikilink">Abu Hamza al-Masri</a>, a fundamentalist Muslim cleric. Some of those invited then threatened to withdraw from the event, and several official bodies criticised the invitations.<a href="#fn82" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref82"><sup>82</sup></a> The two had met earlier in the year, in a debate chaired by <em><a href="Today_programme" title="wikilink">Today programme</a></em> editor <a href="Rod_Liddle" title="wikilink">Rod Liddle</a>.<a href="#fn83" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref83"><sup>83</sup></a> He was also invited by the Cambridge Forum to a debate on extremism in December 2002, with <a href="Liberal_Democrats" title="wikilink">Liberal Democrat</a> MP <a href="Lembit_Opik" title="wikilink">Lembit Opik</a>. The location of the venue was changed twice after protests from property owners, but the threat of a violent confrontation between the Anti-Nazi League and BNP supporters forced the president of the Cambridge Forum, Chris Paley, to cancel the event. Paley called the decision an &quot;own goal&quot; for the values of free speech, and Opik criticised the policy, emphasising his belief in &quot;people's right to make their own decisions in a democracy&quot;.<a href="#fn84" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref84"><sup>84</sup></a></p>
<p>In February 2005 Griffin was asked to take part in a debate on multiculturalism at the <a href="University_of_St_Andrews" title="wikilink">University of St Andrews</a> in <a href="Scotland" class="uri" title="wikilink">Scotland</a>. He was invited by the president of the students' debating society, who said &quot;We believe that the only way to get the truth of what the BNP are saying and to combat them is to do it in public in a debate.&quot;<a href="#fn85" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref85"><sup>85</sup></a> The move was attacked by various anti-racist groups, some of whom refused to participate in the discussion. Griffin said &quot;I am coming up because I was invited by the students at the university because they have a debate on an intelligent subject on which I have something to say. The people against it are the usual bunch of people who cannot win the argument and refuse to stand on a platform.&quot;<a href="#fn86" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref86"><sup>86</sup></a> The university later withdrew the invitation.<a href="#fn87" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref87"><sup>87</sup></a><a href="#fn88" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref88"><sup>88</sup></a></p>
<p>In May 2007 Griffin was invited to address a meeting at the <a href="University_of_Bath" title="wikilink">University of Bath</a> by politics student and BNP youth leader Danny Lake. Lake wanted Griffin to visit the university and explain the BNP's policies to lecturers and students. It was, however, viewed by some as an attempt by the party to establish a foothold on the university campus. Eleven union general secretaries wrote to the university's vice-chancellor and asked her to reconsider the decision to allow the meeting. A large protest was planned, and following students' concerns over their personal safety the invitation was withdrawn.<a href="#fn89" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref89"><sup>89</sup></a></p>
<p><img src="David_Irving.jpg" title="fig:David Irving" alt="David Irving" /> Several months later the <a href="Oxford_Union" title="wikilink">Oxford Union</a> invited Griffin to speak at a forum on the limits of free speech, along with other speakers including <a href="David_Irving" title="wikilink">David Irving</a>. The invitation was condemned by the president of the Oxford Students' Union, and race equalities watchdog <a href="Trevor_Phillips" title="wikilink">Trevor Phillips</a>, and MP Dr <a href="Julian_Lewis" title="wikilink">Julian Lewis</a> resigned his membership of the Union.<a href="#fn90" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref90"><sup>90</sup></a></p>
<p>A rally against the invitation was held at Oxford Town Hall on 20 November, and included the Oxford Students' Union president, the <a href="National_Union_of_Students_of_the_United_Kingdom" title="wikilink">National Union of Students</a> black students' officer, and the <a href="Trades_Union_Congress" title="wikilink">Trades Union Congress</a> south east regional secretary. Representatives of <a href="Unite_Against_Fascism" title="wikilink">Unite Against Fascism</a> also attended, as well as the University of Oxford's Jewish student chaplain. Several Holocaust survivors also spoke at the rally. Stephen Altmann-Richer, co-president of the Oxford University Jewish Society, said &quot;I don't think these people should be invited to the Oxford Union, by having them speak, it legitimises their views ...&quot;<a href="#fn91" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref91"><sup>91</sup></a> On the night of the debate, about 50 protesters forced their way into the venue, and a crowd of hundreds gathered outside carrying banners bearing anti-racist slogans and voicing anti-BNP chants. Police blocked the entrances to the building, and removed the protesters encamped inside. Griffin was accompanied into the premises by security guards. The event was eventually split between two rooms, with Griffin speaking in one, and Irving in the other; many Union Society members were unable to gain access, reducing the audience. Although many present found the debate objectionable, some were supportive of both Griffin and Irving's right to freedom of speech. The Oxford Union later endorsed the debate as a success.<a href="#fn92" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref92"><sup>92</sup></a></p>
<p>Griffin travelled to the United States and spoke at <a href="Clemson_University" title="wikilink">Clemson University</a> and <a href="Texas_A&amp;M_University" title="wikilink">Texas A&amp;M University</a>, but the reception he received in October 2007 at <a href="Michigan_State_University" title="wikilink">Michigan State University</a> was markedly different to that in the other venues. Intending to address the &quot;overpopulation of Islamists in Europe&quot;, he was repeatedly interrupted, to the point where the event became a question and answer session. He was repeatedly heckled by hostile elements of the audience, and at one point the fire alarm was activated.<a href="#fn93" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref93"><sup>93</sup></a></p>
<p>On 22Â October Griffin is to take part in a recording in London of the BBC's topical debate programme, <a href="Question_Time_(TV_series)" title="wikilink">Question Time</a>, as a representative of the BNP.<a href="#fn94" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref94"><sup>94</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="policies-and-views">Policies and views</h2>
<p>Griffin describes himself as a &quot;moderniser&quot;, and &quot;new nationalist&quot;, and upon his election as leader of the BNP spoke of his contempt for its traditional supporters.<a href="#fn95" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref95"><sup>95</sup></a> He has changed the BNP's traditional focus on immigration and race, to a defence of what it sees as &quot;our traditional principles against the politically correct agenda&quot;<a href="#fn96" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref96"><sup>96</sup></a> espoused by mainstream politicians. He has portrayed himself as a defender of free speech, and has repeatedly spoken about issues regarding multiculturalism.<a href="#fn97" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref97"><sup>97</sup></a> During 2000 he attempted to further the BNP's popular appeal by targeting specific groups, including lorry drivers&lt;U+2014&gt;some of whom were at the time engaged in mass protests against fuel prices&lt;U+2014&gt;and farmers. The BNP also produced a journal devoted to rural matters.<a href="#fn98" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref98"><sup>98</sup></a></p>
<p>The BNP's constitution grants its chairman full executive power over all party affairs, and Griffin thus carries sole responsibility for the party's legal and financial liabilities, and has the final say in all decisions affecting the party.<a href="#fn99" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref99"><sup>99</sup></a> Its policies include a halt to all immigration, the forced repatriation of all illegal immigrants, and the deportation of criminals whose original nationality was not British. The party is opposed to a single European currency, and supports British withdrawal from the EU. It promises to &quot;free the police and courts from the politically correct straitjacket that is stopping them from doing their job properly&quot;.<a href="#fn100" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref100"><sup>100</sup></a> It believes that British industry should be prioritised, that foreign imports should be strictly regulated, and that defence spending should be increased. <a href="Northern_Ireland" title="wikilink">Northern Ireland</a> and the <a href="Republic_of_Ireland" title="wikilink">Republic of Ireland</a> would be invited to join a &quot;federation of the nations of the British Isles.&quot;<a href="#fn101" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref101"><sup>101</sup></a> Its policy on education includes improving discipline in classrooms, and selective industry training for students. Greater production of home-grown food would be encouraged, and the party supports the <a href="National_Health_Service_(England)" title="wikilink">National Health Service</a>. It would restore the earnings link with pensions, and the decentralisation of government decision-making.<a href="#fn102" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref102"><sup>102</sup></a></p>
<p>Upon his election to the European Parliament he attempted to form a formal alliance with right-wing parties, which would have entitled them to extra funding, but was unsuccessful. He has also held talks with other far-right European parties, such as <a href="Vlaams_Belang" title="wikilink">Vlaams Belang</a> and <a href="Jobbik" class="uri" title="wikilink">Jobbik</a>.<a href="#fn103" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref103"><sup>103</sup></a> The BNP does however maintain ties with <a href="Roberto_Fiore" title="wikilink">Roberto Fiore</a>, and fascist groups across Europe.<a href="#fn104" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref104"><sup>104</sup></a><a href="#fn105" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref105"><sup>105</sup></a> He has criticised the current Labour government for its attitude toward the BNP, and what he perceives to be its treatment of party supporters as &quot;second-class citizens&quot;.<a href="#fn106" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref106"><sup>106</sup></a> Following his election, in a press conference held at a public house in Manchester, he criticised the privatisation of national industries, such as the railway network, and accused MPs generally of being involved in this &quot;&lt;U+2026&gt;Â giant looting of Britain&quot;.<a href="#fn107" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref107"><sup>107</sup></a> He accused private corporations and the &quot;ruling elite&quot; in Britain of building a &quot;Eurocratic state&quot;, a process he called &quot;<a href="Benito_Mussolini" title="wikilink">Mussolini</a> fascismÂ [&lt;U+2026&gt;]Â under Gordon Brown.&quot;<a href="#fn108" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref108"><sup>108</sup></a> He supported the <a href="Brigade_of_Gurkhas" title="wikilink">Gurkhas</a>, stating that the BNP would allow them and their families entry to the country for medical treatment &quot;for as long as they needed treatment, or for as long as they lived.&quot;<a href="#fn109" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref109"><sup>109</sup></a> He also suggested the removal of 100,000 Muslims &quot;disloyal to Britain&quot; and their replacement with the Gurkhas.<a href="#fn110" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref110"><sup>110</sup></a></p>
<p>Griffin has frequently expressed views on Judaism, Islam, and homosexuality. His comments on <a href="the_Holocaust" title="wikilink">the Holocaust</a> (which he once referred to as &quot;the Holohoax&quot;<a href="#fn111" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref111"><sup>111</sup></a>) made as an editor of <em>The Rune</em>, demonstrate <a href="Historical_revisionism_(negationism)" title="wikilink">revisionism</a>. He criticised Holocaust denier <a href="David_Irving" title="wikilink">David Irving</a> for admitting that up to four million Jews might have died in the Holocaust&lt;U+2014&gt;he wrote &quot;True Revisionists will not be fooled by this new twist to the sorry tale of <em><a href="The_Hoax_of_the_Twentieth_Century" title="wikilink">The Hoax of the Twentieth Century</a></em>.&quot;<a href="#fn112" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref112"><sup>112</sup></a> In 1997 he told an undercover journalist that he had updated <a href="Richard_Verrall" title="wikilink">Richard Verrall</a>'s booklet <em><a href="Did_Six_Million_Really_Die?" title="wikilink">Did Six Million Really Die?</a></em>, and in the same year he wrote <em>Who are the Mindbenders?</em>, a publication concerned with a perceived domination of the media by Jewish figures.<a href="#fn113" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref113"><sup>113</sup></a> The BNP however has a Jewish councillor, <a href="Patricia_Richardson_(politician)" title="wikilink">Patricia Richardson</a>,<a href="#fn114" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref114"><sup>114</sup></a> and spokesman Phil Edwards has stated that the party also has Jewish members.<a href="#fn115" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref115"><sup>115</sup></a> The BNP has stated that it does not deny the Holocaust, and that &quot;Dredging up quotes from 10, 15, 20 years ago is really pathetic and, in a sense, rather fascist.&quot;<a href="#fn116" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref116"><sup>116</sup></a></p>
<p>He has, since assuming control of the party, sought to move it away from its historic identity, although on the BBC's <em><a href="Newsnight" class="uri" title="wikilink">Newsnight</a></em> on 26Â June 2001 he stated that Hindus had been a target as well as whites in the &quot;Muslim&quot; riots of 2001, and in the August 2001 issue of <em>Identity</em> (a BNP publication) he claimed that radical Muslim clerics wanted &quot;... militant Muslims to take over British cities with AK-47 rifles&quot;.<a href="#fn117" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref117"><sup>117</sup></a> When interviewed in August 2009 for <a href="RT_(TV_network)" title="wikilink">RT</a> he distanced himself from the present-day National Front, which he claimed is &quot;... a group of skinheads running around with no political direction, other than that we suspect which their masters give them.&quot;<a href="#fn118" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref118"><sup>118</sup></a> On <em><a href="The_Politics_Show" title="wikilink">The Politics Show</a></em> on 9 March 2003 he appeared to accept the ethnic minorities who were legally already living in the country,<a href="#fn119" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref119"><sup>119</sup></a> but Griffin's court appearances in 2006 centred around his comment that Islam was a &quot;wicked and vicious faith&quot;.<a href="#fn120" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref120"><sup>120</sup></a> On 6 March 2008 he was again interviewed on <em>Newsnight</em>; when told of a poll which demonstrated that most working-class Britons were more concerned about drugs and alcohol than immigration, he linked the UK's drug problem with Islam, specifically Pakistani immigrants. His inclusion on the programme was criticised by contributor and radio presenter <a href="Jon_Gaunt" title="wikilink">Jon Gaunt</a>, who branded the decision as &quot;pathetic&quot;.<a href="#fn121" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref121"><sup>121</sup></a> When asked by <em><a href="The_Times" title="wikilink">The Times</a></em> about concerns that his recent success was presaged in <a href="Enoch_Powell" title="wikilink">Enoch Powell</a>'s <a href="Rivers_of_Blood_speech" title="wikilink">Rivers of Blood speech</a>, Griffin replied:</p>

<p>In a June 2009 interview with <a href="Channel_4_News" title="wikilink">Channel 4 News</a> Griffin claimed that &quot;There's no such thing as a black Welshman&quot;,<a href="#fn122" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref122"><sup>122</sup></a> which was criticised by <a href="Vaughan_Gething" title="wikilink">Vaughan Gething</a> (the first black president of the <a href="NUS_Wales" title="wikilink">Welsh NUS</a>, the first black president of the <a href="Wales_TUC" title="wikilink">Welsh TUC</a>, and the first black candidate for the <a href="Welsh_assembly" title="wikilink">Welsh assembly</a>). Commenting on Griffin's claim, he said &quot;On that basis, most white people wouldn't qualify. It's quite clear that Nick Griffin just doesn't accept that black British people or black Welsh people are entitled to call themselves proper, full citizens of the country.&quot;<a href="#fn123" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref123"><sup>123</sup></a> Griffin's interview with Channel 4 News was in response to a decision by the <a href="Equality_and_Human_Rights_Commission" title="wikilink">Equality and Human Rights Commission</a> to investigate the BNP's membership criteria.<a href="#fn124" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref124"><sup>124</sup></a> He rejected claims that the BNP was &quot;acting unlawfully&quot;<a href="#fn125" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref125"><sup>125</sup></a> and said &quot;... because we are here, as it was pointed out, for specific ethnic groups&lt;U+2014&gt;it's nothing to do with colour, your reporter there said that we'll only lift a finger for white people&lt;U+2014&gt;that's a simple lie&quot;.<a href="#fn126" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref126"><sup>126</sup></a> In an interview with the BBC on 8 July 2009, during a discussion on European immigration he proposed that the EU should sink boats carrying illegal immigrants, to prevent them from entering Europe. Although the interviewer (BBC Correspondent Shirin Wheeler) implied that Griffin may have wished the EU to &quot;murder people at sea&quot;, he quickly corrected her by saying &quot;I didn't say anyone should be murdered at seaâ€”I say boats should be sunk, they can throw them a life raft and they can go back to Libya&quot; (a staging post for migrants from Egypt and sub-Saharan Africa).<a href="#fn127" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref127"><sup>127</sup></a></p>
<p>Following the <a href="Admiral_Duncan_pub" title="wikilink">Admiral Duncan pub</a> bombing by former BNP member <a href="David_Copeland" title="wikilink">David Copeland</a>, Griffin stated &quot;The TV footage of dozens of 'gay' demonstrators flaunting their perversion in front of the world's journalists showed just why so many ordinary people find these creatures so repulsive.&quot;<a href="#fn128" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref128"><sup>128</sup></a> The BNP states that privately, homosexuality should be tolerated, but that it &quot;should not be promoted or encouraged&quot;.<a href="#fn129" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref129"><sup>129</sup></a> It opposed the introduction of civil partnerships and wishes to ban what it perceives as the promotion of homosexuality in schools and the media.<a href="#fn130" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref130"><sup>130</sup></a><a href="#fn131" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref131"><sup>131</sup></a></p>
<p>Writing for <em>The Rune</em>, Griffin praised the wartime <a href="Waffen_SS" title="wikilink">Waffen SS</a> and attacked the <a href="Royal_Air_Force" title="wikilink">Royal Air Force</a> for its bombing of <a href="Nazi_Germany" title="wikilink">Nazi Germany</a>,<a href="#fn132" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref132"><sup>132</sup></a> and in 1996 during a public demonstration at <a href="Coventry_Cathedral" title="wikilink">Coventry Cathedral</a>, he accused British airmen of &quot;mass murder&quot;.<a href="#fn133" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref133"><sup>133</sup></a> Although unconnected, on 9Â June 2009 the <a href="Royal_British_Legion" title="wikilink">Royal British Legion</a> wrote an open letter to Griffin asking him not to wear a poppy lapel badge.<a href="#fn134" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref134"><sup>134</sup></a></p>
<p>In a BBC interview on 8Â June 2009 Griffin claimed that &quot;global warming is essentially a hoax&quot; and that it &quot;is being exploited by the liberal elite as a means of taxing and controlling us and the real crisis is peak oil&quot;.<a href="#fn135" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref135"><sup>135</sup></a></p>
