<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<p>Lille was established as a coal mining town in 1901 by two representatives of a French company, United Gold Fields Ltd. The representatives, J. J. Fleutot and C. Remy, were looking for coal in the <a href="Crowsnest_Pass" title="wikilink">Crowsnest Pass</a> of <a href="Alberta" class="uri" title="wikilink">Alberta</a> when they happened upon a seam near the future site of Lille. The town was initially called 'French Camp', but the founders of the town changed its name to Lille after the <a href="Lille" title="wikilink">French town of the same name</a> where the mining venture's financial backers were located.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> The next year, the Frank-Grassy Mountain Railway was built, giving the town a strong connection to the outside world. Lille was built mostly by the company, which was renamed West Canadian Collieries in 1903. Approximately 20 residences existed, along with a doctor, a school room, a hospital and a hotel. The company also rented space for firms to conduct business. Although originally planned for nearby Frank, <a href="coke_(fuel)" title="wikilink">coke</a> ovens were established in Lille in 1903. In 1912, the local coal mine closed due to the collapse of the local coke industry. West Canadian Collieries suffered a loss of over $40,000, as wages exceeded revenue by that amount.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> Although Lille is a Provincial Historic Site, much of the town site has fallen prey to scavengers, and as such very little of Lille remains.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
