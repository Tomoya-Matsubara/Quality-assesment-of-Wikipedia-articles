<p><strong>Jack the Bulldog</strong> is the official <a href="mascot" class="uri" title="wikilink">mascot</a> of the <a href="Georgetown_University" title="wikilink">Georgetown University</a> <a href="Georgetown_Hoyas" title="wikilink">Hoyas</a> athletics teams. Jack has been the name of at least four live <a href="Bulldog" title="wikilink">Bulldogs</a> since 1962, when the name first came into use.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> The current incarnation of Jack is an English Bulldog born in 2003 whose full name is John S. Carroll. Jack is also portrayed by a <a href="costumed_character" title="wikilink">costumed character</a> Bulldog mascot, a tradition dating to 1977. Jack was not always the name of the Georgetown Hoyas' mascot, nor was the mascot always a bulldog, as other types of dogs, particularly <a href="Bull_Terrier" title="wikilink">bull terriers</a>, were associated with the sports teams before 1962. Today, Georgetown is among thirty-nine American universities to use a bulldog as their mascot.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<p>Dogs have been associated with the school's sports teams on an unofficial basis since the late nineteenth century. Early dog mascots may have included a mutt called Hoya, a <a href="Borzoi" class="uri" title="wikilink">Borzoi</a> named Richmond Jack in 1906, and a Boston <a href="Bull_Terrier" title="wikilink">Bull Terrier</a> in 1911.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> At this time, the mascot was primarily associated with the school's football team.</p>
<p><img src="StubbyTheGeorgetownTerrier.jpg" title="fig:Sergeant Stubby began as mascot in 1921" alt="Sergeant Stubby began as mascot in 1921" /> <a href="Sergeant_Stubby" title="wikilink">Sergeant Stubby</a>, a part bull terrier and a decorated <a href="World_War_I" title="wikilink">World War I</a> <a href="war_dog" title="wikilink">war dog</a>, came to campus in 1921 with J. Robert Conroy who was attending <a href="Georgetown_University_Law_Center" title="wikilink">Georgetown University Law Center</a> at the time. The school football team used Stubby as a popular <a href="halftime_show" title="wikilink">halftime show</a> where he would push a football across the field.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> After his death in 1926, he was replaced by the team with Jazz Bo, brought to campus by <a href="Georgetown_College_(Georgetown_University)" title="wikilink">Georgetown College</a> student Paul Van Laanen. Jazz Bo, another bull terrier, was called &quot;Hoya&quot; by the students, after the traditional &quot;Hoya Saxa&quot; school cheer. The athletic teams are possibly named, in turn, for this dog.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>Other bull terriers filled in as mascot until <a href="World_War_II" title="wikilink">World War II</a>, when athletics at the school paused during the war. After the war, a <a href="Great_Dane" title="wikilink">Great Dane</a> named Butch was the mascot.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> <a href="William_Peter_Blatty" title="wikilink">William Peter Blatty</a>, author of <em><a href="The_Exorcist" title="wikilink">The Exorcist</a></em>, was one of the students to care for Butch. A bull terrier costume was also briefly used by the school.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> From 1951 to 1962, the school suspended the football program as part of a larger backlash against university sports.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>

<p><img src="Hoya_mascot.jpg" title="fig:The costumed personification of Jack the Bulldog at a basketball game." alt="The costumed personification of Jack the Bulldog at a basketball game." /> In 1962, with the resumption of a football team, students Stan Samorajczyk and John Feldmann, editors of <em><a href="The_Hoya" title="wikilink">The Hoya</a></em> campus newspaper, founded a committee to raise money for the purchase of a new mascot dog in time for the first new games in 1964.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> This committee chose a <a href="purebred" class="uri" title="wikilink">purebred</a> English Bulldog as the dog which would represent Georgetown students because of their &quot;tenacity.&quot;<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> Samorajczyk also followed the sports team jerseys, which may have previously had an image of a bulldog on them.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> In this same year, 1962, the school adopted as the official logo of the athletics program a new drawing in blue and gray school colors of the bulldog. This logo dog wears a cap typical of the <a href="beanie" class="uri" title="wikilink">beanie</a> which other freshman at the time had to wear.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<p>For $150 the committee bought a two-year-old blue-ribbon-champion <a href="show_dog" title="wikilink">show dog</a> named &quot;Lil-Nan's Royal Jacket,&quot; named because the colors of his <a href="Coat_(dog)" title="wikilink">coat</a> looked like a jacket.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> This dog was to be renamed &quot;Hoya&quot; like his 1926 predecessor, but refused to respond to any name other than his call name &quot;Jack.&quot;<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> Jack lived outside <a href="New_South_Hall" title="wikilink">New South Hall</a> in a heated <a href="doghouse" class="uri" title="wikilink">doghouse</a>.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> In 1967, Royal Jacket retired and was replaced by a second bulldog who continued under the simple name &quot;Jack.&quot;<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> In 1977, the costumed mascot took over duties as Jack.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> The costume, first worn by student Pat Sheehan, has been updated numerous times, most recently in 2008.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a><a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> Other live bulldogs owned by students at times joined the costumed Jack, including one named Rocky from 1982-85 and one named Daisy in 1997.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a><a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1998, Michael Boyle, Austin Martin, and Kathleen Long, co-founders of the Hoya Blue fan club began a campaign to revive the tradition of an official live mascot with the assistance of English professor Father <a href="Scott_R._Pilarz" title="wikilink">Scott R. Pilarz</a>, S.J.<ref name=history> The &quot;Bring Back Jack&quot; Campaign initially sought to find a suitable dog among the students and faculty, as the university did not want to use school funds for the purchase.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> Ultimately, Hoya Blue raised $1500 to purchase a new puppy named Jack and placed in the care of Father Pilarz on <a href="February_16" title="wikilink">February 16</a>, <a href="1999" class="uri" title="wikilink">1999</a>.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> Pilarz left Georgetown in 2003 to be president of the <a href="University_of_Scranton" title="wikilink">University of Scranton</a> in <a href="Pennsylvania" class="uri" title="wikilink">Pennsylvania</a>, and took Jack with him. Donations from Hoya Blue, the Hoya Hoop Club, the Office of the President, and alumni allowed for the purchase of the current incarnation of Jack.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a></p>

<p><img src="Jack_the_Bulldog_bed.jpg" title="fig:Jack spends much of his days resting in Wolfington Hall Jesuit Residence." alt="Jack spends much of his days resting in Wolfington Hall Jesuit Residence." /> Jack was born <a href="May_3" title="wikilink">May 3</a>, <a href="2003" class="uri" title="wikilink">2003</a> at Brookhollow Kennel in <a href="Freehold,_New_Jersey" title="wikilink">Freehold, New Jersey</a>, son of champion bulldog Copper Kid and a relation of Rocky the 1983 bulldog.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> He was brought to campus on <a href="July_19" title="wikilink">July 19</a>, <a href="2003" class="uri" title="wikilink">2003</a> and placed in the care of Father Christopher Steck, S.J., a theology professor. His official name, as registered with the <a href="American_Kennel_Club" title="wikilink">American Kennel Club</a> is Brookhollow's John S. Carroll, which allows for the nickname Jack.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> This refers to Georgetown founder <a href="John_Carroll_(bishop)" title="wikilink">John Carroll</a>, while &quot;S.&quot; stands for Steck. Similarly the previous mascot was officially John P. Carroll, for Pilarz. He is also infrequently referred to as Jack IV, as the school is unsure of the exact number of dogs used as Jack in the 1970s.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a></p>
<p>Jack lives with Father Steck in <a href="New_South_Hall" title="wikilink">New South Hall</a> but spends time in Wolfington Hall Jesuit Residence.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> In 2007, Father Steck started the &quot;Jack Crew,&quot; a twenty-student organization of Jack's walkers and caretakers.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> He attends home basketball games at the <a href="Verizon_Center" title="wikilink">Verizon Center</a>, where he entertains fans by attacking a cardboard box decorated with opponents logos.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> Jack also occasionally wears a team jersey sporting the number one.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> On campus, Jack attends some student meetings can be booked for social functions.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> Jack has both an email address and <a href="Facebook" class="uri" title="wikilink">Facebook</a> profile, as well as a local phone number, and the campus directory lists him as a theology faculty, like Father Steck.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> He weighs 55 pounds and his color is described as &quot;red fawn.&quot;<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> Jack's personality is described as imperious and stubborn with &quot;a sense of entitlement.&quot;<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a></p>
