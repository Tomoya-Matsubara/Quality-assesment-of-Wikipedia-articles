<p><strong>Jerome David Kern</strong> (January 27, 1885 â€“ November 11, 1945) was an American <a href="composer" class="uri" title="wikilink">composer</a> of <a href="musical_theatre" title="wikilink">musical theatre</a> and popular music. One of the most important American theatre composers of the early 20th century, he wrote more than 700 songs, used in over 100 stage works, including such classics as &quot;<a href="Ol&#39;_Man_River" title="wikilink">Ol' Man River</a>&quot;, &quot;<a href="Can&#39;t_Help_Lovin&#39;_Dat_Man" title="wikilink">Can't Help Lovin' Dat Man</a>&quot;, &quot;<a href="A_Fine_Romance_(song)" title="wikilink">A Fine Romance</a>&quot;, &quot;<a href="Smoke_Gets_in_Your_Eyes" title="wikilink">Smoke Gets in Your Eyes</a>&quot;, &quot;<a href="All_the_Things_You_Are" title="wikilink">All the Things You Are</a>&quot;, &quot;<a href="The_Way_You_Look_Tonight" title="wikilink">The Way You Look Tonight</a>&quot;, &quot;<a href="Long_Ago_(and_Far_Away)" title="wikilink">Long Ago (and Far Away)</a>&quot; and &quot;<a href="Who?_(song)" title="wikilink">Who?</a>&quot;. He collaborated with many of the leading librettists and lyricists of his era, including <a href="George_Grossmith_Jr." title="wikilink">George Grossmith Jr.</a>, <a href="Guy_Bolton" title="wikilink">Guy Bolton</a>, <a href="P._G._Wodehouse" title="wikilink">P. G. Wodehouse</a>, <a href="Otto_Harbach" title="wikilink">Otto Harbach</a>, <a href="Oscar_Hammerstein_II" title="wikilink">Oscar Hammerstein II</a>, <a href="Dorothy_Fields" title="wikilink">Dorothy Fields</a>, <a href="Johnny_Mercer" title="wikilink">Johnny Mercer</a>, <a href="Ira_Gershwin" title="wikilink">Ira Gershwin</a> and <a href="E._Y._Harburg" title="wikilink">E. Y. Harburg</a>.</p>
<p>A native <a href="New_York_City" title="wikilink">New Yorker</a>, Kern created dozens of <a href="Broadway_theatre" title="wikilink">Broadway</a> musicals and <a href="musical_films" title="wikilink">Hollywood films</a> in a career that lasted for more than four decades. His musical innovations, such as 4/4 dance rhythms and the employment of syncopation and <a href="jazz" class="uri" title="wikilink">jazz</a> progressions, built on, rather than rejected, earlier musical theatre tradition. He and his collaborators also employed his melodies to further the action or develop characterization to a greater extent than in the other musicals of his day, creating the model for later musicals. Although dozens of Kern's musicals and <a href="musical_films" title="wikilink">musical films</a> were hits, only <em><a href="Show_Boat" title="wikilink">Show Boat</a></em> is now regularly revived. However, songs from his other shows are still frequently performed and adapted. Although Kern detested jazz arrangements of his songs, many have been adopted by jazz musicians to become <a href="jazz_standard" title="wikilink">standard tunes</a>.</p>

<h3 id="early-life">Early life</h3>
<p>Kern was born in New York City, on <a href="Sutton_Place,_Manhattan" title="wikilink">Sutton Place</a>, in what was then the city's brewery district.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> His parents were Henry Kern (1842&lt;U+2013&gt;1908), a Jewish German immigrant, and Fannie Kern <em>n&lt;U+00E9&gt;e</em> Kakeles (1852&lt;U+2013&gt;1907), who was an American Jew of <a href="Bohemia" title="wikilink">Bohemian</a> parentage.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> At the time of Kern's birth, his father ran a stable; later he became a successful merchant.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> Kern grew up on East 56th Street in <a href="Manhattan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Manhattan</a>, where he attended public schools. He showed an early aptitude for music and was taught to play the piano and organ by his mother, an accomplished player and teacher.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1897, the family moved to <a href="Newark,_New_Jersey" title="wikilink">Newark, New Jersey</a>, where Kern attended Newark High School (which became <a href="Barringer_High_School" title="wikilink">Barringer High School</a> in 1907). He wrote songs for a school musical (a <a href="minstrel_show" title="wikilink">minstrel show</a>), and for an amateur musical adaptation of <em><a href="Uncle_Tom&#39;s_Cabin" title="wikilink">Uncle Tom's Cabin</a></em> put on at the Newark Yacht Club in January 1902.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> In 1902, Kern's father insisted that his son work with him in business, instead of composing, but Kern, luckily, failed miserably in one of his earliest tasks: He was supposed to purchase two pianos for the store, but instead he ordered 200.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> His father relented, and later that year, he became a student at the <a href="New_York_College_of_Music" title="wikilink">New York College of Music</a>, studying the piano under Alexander Lambert and Paolo Galico, and harmony under Dr. Austin Pierce.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> His first published composition, a piano piece, <em>At the Casino</em>, appeared in the same year. Between 1903 and 1905, he continued his musical training under private tutors in <a href="Heidelberg" class="uri" title="wikilink">Heidelberg</a>, Germany, returning to New York via London.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a><a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="first-compositions">First compositions</h3>
<p>For a time, Kern worked as a rehearsal pianist in <a href="Broadway_theatre" title="wikilink">Broadway</a> theatres and as a <a href="song-plugger" class="uri" title="wikilink">song-plugger</a> for <a href="Tin_Pan_Alley" title="wikilink">Tin Pan Alley</a> music publishers. While in London, he secured a contract from the American impresario <a href="Charles_Frohman" title="wikilink">Charles Frohman</a> to provide songs for interpolation in Broadway versions of London shows. He began to provide these additions in 1904 to British scores for <em>An English Daisy</em>, by <a href="Seymour_Hicks" title="wikilink">Seymour Hicks</a> and <a href="Walter_Slaughter" title="wikilink">Walter Slaughter</a>, and <em>Mr. Wix of Wickham</em>, for which he wrote most of the songs.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>

G. Wodehouse</a>) and making valuable contacts, including <a href="George_Grossmith_Jr." title="wikilink">George Grossmith Jr.</a> and <a href="Seymour_Hicks" title="wikilink">Seymour Hicks</a>, who were the first to introduce Kern's songs to the London stage.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> Kern's parents died in 1907 and 1908.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> In 1909 during one of his stays in England, Kern took a boat trip on the <a href="River_Thames" title="wikilink">River Thames</a> with some friends, and when the boat stopped at <a href="Walton-on-Thames" class="uri" title="wikilink">Walton-on-Thames</a>, they went to an inn called the Swan for a drink. Kern was much taken with the proprietor's daughter, Eva Leale (1891&lt;U+2013&gt;1959), who was working behind the bar. He wooed her, and they were married at the <a href="Anglican" class="uri" title="wikilink">Anglican</a> church of St. Mary's in Walton on October 25, 1910. The couple then lived at the Swan when Kern was in England.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
<p><embed src="Mind_the_Paint.pdf" title="fig:Billie Burke, for whom Kern wrote stage and screen music" /> Kern is believed to have composed music for <a href="silent_film" title="wikilink">silent films</a> as early as 1912, but the earliest documented film music which he is known to have written was for a twenty-part serial, <em>Gloria's Romance</em> in 1916.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> This was one of the first starring vehicles for <a href="Billie_Burke" title="wikilink">Billie Burke</a>, for whom Kern had earlier written the song &quot;Mind the Paint&quot;, with lyrics by <a href="Arthur_Wing_Pinero" title="wikilink">A. W. Pinero</a>. The film is now considered <a href="lost_film" title="wikilink">lost</a>, but Kern's music survives. Another score for the silent movies, <em>Jubilo</em>, followed in 1919.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> Kern was one of the founding members of <a href="ASCAP" class="uri" title="wikilink">ASCAP</a>.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
<p>Kern's first complete score was Broadway's <em>The Red Petticoat</em> (1912), one of the first musical comedy Westerns. The libretto was by <a href="Rida_Johnson_Young" title="wikilink">Rida Johnson Young</a>. By <a href="World_War_I" title="wikilink">World War I</a>, more than a hundred of Kern&lt;U+2019&gt;s songs had been used in about thirty productions, mostly Broadway adaptations of West End and European shows. Kern contributed two songs to <em><a href="To-Night&#39;s_the_Night_(musical)" title="wikilink">To-Night's the Night</a></em> (1914), another Rubens musical. It opened in New York and went on to become a hit in London. The best known of Kern's songs from this period is probably &quot;<a href="They_Didn&#39;t_Believe_Me" title="wikilink">They Didn't Believe Me</a>&quot;, which was a hit in the New York version of the <a href="Paul_Rubens_(composer)" title="wikilink">Paul Rubens</a> and <a href="Sidney_Jones" title="wikilink">Sidney Jones</a> musical, <em><a href="The_Girl_from_Utah" title="wikilink">The Girl from Utah</a></em> (1914).<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> Kern's song, with four beats to a bar, departed from the customary <a href="waltz" class="uri" title="wikilink">waltz</a>-rhythms of European influence and fitted the new American passion for modern dances such as the <a href="fox-trot" class="uri" title="wikilink">fox-trot</a>. He was also able to use elements of American styles, such as ragtime, as well as syncopation, in his his lively dance tunes.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> In May 1915, Kern was due to sail with Charles Frohman from New York to London on board the <a href="RMS_Lusitania" title="wikilink">RMS Lusitania</a>, but Kern missed the boat, having overslept after staying up late playing poker.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> Frohman died in the sinking of the ship.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="the-princess-theatre-musicals">The Princess Theatre musicals</h3>
<p>Kern composed sixteen Broadway scores between 1915 and 1920 and also contributed songs to the London hit <em><a href="Theodore_&amp;_Co" title="wikilink">Theodore &amp; Co</a></em> (1916; most of the songs are by the young <a href="Ivor_Novello" title="wikilink">Ivor Novello</a>) and to revues like the <a href="Ziegfeld_Follies" title="wikilink">Ziegfeld Follies</a>. The most notable of his scores, however, were those for a series of shows written for the <a href="Princess_Theatre" title="wikilink">Princess Theatre</a>, a small (299-seat) house built by Ray Comstock. Theatrical agent <a href="Elisabeth_Marbury" title="wikilink">Elisabeth Marbury</a> asked Kern and librettist <a href="Guy_Bolton" title="wikilink">Guy Bolton</a> to create a series of intimate and low-budget, yet smart, musicals.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a></p>
<p><img src="An_Old-Fashioned_Wife_cover.jpg" title="fig:Sheet music cover" alt="Sheet music cover" /> The &quot;Princess Theatre shows&quot; were unique on Broadway not only for their small size, but their clever, coherent plots, integrated scores and naturalistic acting, which presented &quot;a sharp contrast to the large-scale <a href="Ruritania" title="wikilink">Ruritanian</a> operettas then in vogue&quot;<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> or the star-studded <a href="revue" title="wikilink">revues</a> and extravaganzas of producers like <a href="Florenz_Ziegfeld" title="wikilink">Florenz Ziegfeld</a>. Earlier <a href="Edwardian_musical_comedy" title="wikilink">musical comedy</a> had often been thinly plotted, gaudy pieces, marked by the insertion of songs into their scores with little regard to the plot. But Kern and Bolton followed the examples of <a href="Gilbert_and_Sullivan" title="wikilink">Gilbert and Sullivan</a> and French <em><a href="op&lt;U+00E9&gt;ra_bouffe" title="wikilink">op&lt;U+00E9&gt;ra bouffe</a></em> in integrating song and story. &quot;These shows built and polished the mold from which almost all later major musical comedies evolved. ... The characters and situations were, within the limitations of musical comedy license, believable and the humor came from the situations or the nature of the characters. Kern's exquisitely flowing melodies were employed to further the action or develop characterization.&quot;<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> The shows featured modern American settings and simple scene changes to suit the small theatre.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a></p>
<p>The team's first Princess Theatre show was an adaptation of Paul Rubens' 1905 London show, <em>Mr. Popple (of Ippleton)</em>, called <em>Nobody Home</em> (1915).<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> The piece ran for 135 performances and was a modest financial success.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> However, it did little to fulfill the new team's mission to innovate, except that Kern's song, &quot;The Magic Melody&quot;, was the first Broadway showtune with a basic <a href="jazz" class="uri" title="wikilink">jazz</a> progression.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> Kern and Bolton next created an original piece, <em><a href="Very_Good_Eddie" title="wikilink">Very Good Eddie</a></em>, which was a surprise hit, running for 341 performances, with additional touring productions that went on into the 1918-19 season.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> The British humorist, lyricist and librettist <a href="P._G._Wodehouse" title="wikilink">P. G. Wodehouse</a> joined the Princess team in 1917, adding his skill as a lyricist to the succeeding shows. <em><a href="Oh,_Boy!_(musical)" title="wikilink">Oh, Boy!</a></em> (1917) ran for an extraordinary 463 performances.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a><a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> Other shows written for the theatre were <em>Have a Heart</em> (1917), <em>Leave It to Jane</em> (1917) and <em><a href="Oh,_Lady!_Lady!!" title="wikilink">Oh, Lady! Lady!!</a></em> (1918).<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> The first opened at another theatre before <em>Very Good Eddie</em> closed. The second played elsewhere during the long run of <em>Oh Boy!</em><a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> An anonymous admirer wrote a verse in their praise<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> that begins: <img src="Not_Yet_cover.jpg" title="fig:Sheet music to Oh, Lady!

<p>In February 1918, <a href="Dorothy_Parker" title="wikilink">Dorothy Parker</a> wrote in <em><a href="Vanity_Fair_(American_magazine_1913-1936)" title="wikilink">Vanity Fair</a></em>: </p>
<p><em>Oh, Lady! Lady!!</em> was the last successful &quot;Princess Theatre show&quot;. Kern and Wodehouse disagreed over money, and the composer decided to move on to other projects.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> Kern's importance to the partnership was illustrated by the fate of the last musical of the series, <em>Oh, My Dear!</em> (1918), to which he contributed only one song: &quot;Go, Little Boat&quot;. The rest of the show was composed by <a href="Louis_Hirsch" title="wikilink">Louis Hirsch</a>, and ran for 189 performances: &quot;Despite a respectable run, everyone realized there was little point in continuing the series without Kern.&quot;<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="early-1920s">Early 1920s</h3>
<p><img src="Marilyn_Miller.jpg" title="fig:Marilyn Miller, the star of Sally" alt="Marilyn Miller, the star of Sally" /> The 1920s were an extremely productive period in American musical theatre, and Kern created at least one show every year for the entire decade. His first show of 1920 was <em>The Night Boat</em>, with book and lyrics by <a href="Anne_Caldwell" title="wikilink">Anne Caldwell</a>, which ran for more than 300 performances in New York and for three seasons on tour.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> Later in the same year, Kern wrote the score for <em><a href="Sally_(musical)" title="wikilink">Sally</a></em>, with a book by Bolton and lyrics by <a href="Otto_Harbach" title="wikilink">Otto Harbach</a>. This show, staged by <a href="Florenz_Ziegfeld" title="wikilink">Florenz Ziegfeld</a>, ran for 570 performances, one of the longest runs of any Broadway show in the decade, and popularized the song &quot;<a href="Look_for_the_Silver_Lining" title="wikilink">Look for the Silver Lining</a>&quot; (which had been written for an earlier show), performed by the rising star <a href="Marilyn_Miller" title="wikilink">Marilyn Miller</a>. It also had a long run in London in 1921, produced by <a href="George_Grossmith,_Jr." title="wikilink">George Grossmith, Jr.</a><a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> Kern's next shows were <em>Good Morning, Dearie</em> (1921, with Caldwell) which ran for 347 performances; followed in 1922 by a West End success, <em><a href="The_Cabaret_Girl" title="wikilink">The Cabaret Girl</a></em> in collaboration with Grossmith and Wodehouse;<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> another modest success by the same team, <em><a href="The_Beauty_Prize" title="wikilink">The Beauty Prize</a></em> (1923); and a Broadway flop, <em>The Bunch and Judy</em>, remembered, if at all, as the first time Kern and <a href="Fred_Astaire" title="wikilink">Fred Astaire</a> worked together.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a></p>
<p><em>Stepping Stones</em> (1923, with Caldwell) was a success, and in 1924 the Princess Theatre team of Bolton, Wodehouse and Kern reunited to write <em>Sitting Pretty</em>, but it did not recapture the popularity of the earlier collaborations.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> Its relative failure may have been partly due to Kern's growing aversion to having individual songs from his shows performed out of context on radio, in cabaret, or on record, although his chief objection was to jazz interpretations of his songs. He called himself a &quot;musical clothier &lt;U+2013&gt; nothing more or less,&quot; and said, &quot;I write music to both the situations and the lyrics in plays.&quot;<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> When <em>Sitting Pretty</em> was produced, he forbade any broadcasting or recording of individual numbers from the show, which limited their chance to gain popularity.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a></p>
<p><img src="Hammerstein.jpg" title="fig:Oscar Hammerstein II, one of Kern&#39;s chief collaborators" alt="Oscar Hammerstein II, one of Kern&#39;s chief collaborators" width="150" /> 1925 was a major turning point in Kern's career when he met <a href="Oscar_Hammerstein_II" title="wikilink">Oscar Hammerstein II</a>, with whom he would entertain a lifelong friendship and collaboration. As a young man, Kern had been an easy companion with great charm and humor, but he became less outgoing in his middle years, sometimes difficult to work with: he once introduced himself to a producer by saying, &quot;I hear you're a son of a bitch. So am I.&quot;<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> He rarely collaborated with any one lyricist for long. With Hammerstein, however, he remained on close terms for the rest of his life.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a> Their first show, written together with Harbach, was <em><a href="Sunny_(musical)" title="wikilink">Sunny</a></em>, which featured the song &quot;Who (Stole My Heart Away)?&quot; Marilyn Miller played the title role, as she had in <em>Sally</em>.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a> The show ran for 517 performances on Broadway, and the following year ran for 363 performances in the West End, starring <a href="Binnie_Hale" title="wikilink">Binnie Hale</a> and <a href="Jack_Buchanan" title="wikilink">Jack Buchanan</a>.<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="show-boat"><em>Show Boat</em></h3>
<p>Because of the strong success of <em>Sally</em> and <em>Sunny</em> and consistent good results with his other shows, Ziegfeld was willing to gamble on Kern's next project in 1927. Kern had been impressed by <a href="Edna_Ferber" title="wikilink">Edna Ferber</a>'s novel <em><a href="Show_Boat_(novel)" title="wikilink">Show Boat</a></em> and wished to present a musical stage version.<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a> He persuaded Hammerstein to adapt it and Ziegfeld to produce it. The story, dealing with racism, marital strife and alcoholism, was unheard of in the escapist world of musical comedy. Despite his doubts, Ziegfeld spared no expense in staging the piece to give it its full epic grandeur. According to the theatre historian <a href="John_Kenrick" title="wikilink">John Kenrick</a>: &quot;After the opening night audience filed out of the Ziegfeld Theatre in near silence, Ziegfeld thought his worst fears had been confirmed. He was pleasantly surprised when the next morning brought ecstatic reviews and long lines at the box office. In fact, <em>Show Boat</em> proved to be the most lasting accomplishment of Ziegfeld's career &lt;U+2013&gt; the only one of his shows that is regularly performed today.&quot;<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a> The score is, arguably, Kern's greatest and includes the well-known songs &quot;<a href="Ol&#39;_Man_River" title="wikilink">Ol' Man River</a>&quot; and &quot;<a href="Can&#39;t_Help_Lovin&#39;_Dat_Man" title="wikilink">Can't Help Lovin' Dat Man</a>&quot; as well as &quot;Make Believe&quot;, &quot;You Are Love&quot;, &quot;Life Upon the Wicked Stage&quot;, &quot;Why Do I Love You&quot;, and &quot;<a href="Bill_(Show_Boat)" title="wikilink">Bill</a>&quot;.

It is a staple of stock productions and has been revived numerous times on Broadway and in London. A 1946 revival integrated choreography into the show, in the manner of a <a href="Rodgers_and_Hammerstein" title="wikilink">Rodgers and Hammerstein</a> production, as did the 1994 <a href="Harold_Prince" title="wikilink">Harold Prince</a>&lt;U+2013&gt;<a href="Susan_Stroman" title="wikilink">Susan Stroman</a> revival, which was nominated for ten <a href="Tony_Awards" title="wikilink">Tony Awards</a>, winning five, including best revival. It was the first musical to enter a major opera company's repertory (New York City Opera, 1954), and the rediscovery of the 1927 score with <a href="Robert_Russell_Bennett" title="wikilink">Robert Russell Bennett</a>'s original orchestrations led to a large-scale <a href="EMI_Classics" title="wikilink">EMI</a> recording in 1987 and several opera-house productions.<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a> In 1941, the conductor <a href="Artur_Rodzi&lt;U+0144&gt;ski" title="wikilink">Artur Rodzi&lt;U+0144&gt;ski</a> wished to commission a symphonic suite from the score, but Kern considered himself a songwriter and not a symphonist. He never orchestrated his own scores, leaving that to musical assistants, principally Frank Saddler (until 1921) and Russell Bennett (from 1923).<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a> In response to the commission, Kern oversaw an arrangement by Charles Miller and Emil Gerstenberger of numbers from the show into the orchestral work <em>Scenario for Orchestra: Themes from Show Boat</em>, premiered in 1941 by the <a href="Cleveland_Orchestra" title="wikilink">Cleveland Orchestra</a> conducted by Rodzi&lt;U+0144&gt;ski.<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a><a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a></p>
<p>Kern's last Broadway show in the 1920s was <em><a href="Sweet_Adeline_(musical)" title="wikilink">Sweet Adeline</a></em> (1929), with a libretto by Hammerstein. It was a period piece, set in the Gay 90s, about a girl from <a href="Hoboken,_New_Jersey" title="wikilink">Hoboken, New Jersey</a> (near Kern's childhood home), who becomes a Broadway star. Opening just before the stock market crash, it received rave reviews, but the elaborate, old-fashioned piece was a step back from the innovations in <em>Show Boat</em>, or even the Princess Theatre shows.<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a> In January 1929, at the height of the <a href="Jazz_Age" title="wikilink">Jazz Age</a>, and with <em>Show Boat</em> still playing on Broadway, Kern made news on both sides of the Atlantic for reasons wholly unconnected with music. He sold at auction, at New York's Anderson Galleries, the collection of English and American literature that he had been building up for more than a decade. The collection, rich in inscribed first editions and manuscript material of eighteenth and nineteenth century authors, sold for a total of $1,729,462.50 &lt;U+2013&gt; a record for a single-owner sale that stood for over fifty years.

<p>In 1929 Kern made his first trip to <a href="Hollywood" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hollywood</a> to supervise the <a href="Sally_(1929_film)" title="wikilink">1929 film version of <em>Sally</em></a>, one of the first &quot;all-talking&quot; <a href="Technicolor" class="uri" title="wikilink">Technicolor</a> films. The following year, he was there a second time to work on <em><a href="Men_of_the_Sky" title="wikilink">Men of the Sky</a></em>, released in 1931 without his songs, and a <a href="Sunny_(1930_film)" title="wikilink">1930 film version of <em>Sunny</em></a>.<a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a> There was a public reaction against the early glut of film musicals after the advent of film sound; Hollywood released more than 100 musical films in 1930, but only 14 in 1931.<a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a> <a href="Warner_Bros." title="wikilink">Warner Bros.</a> bought out Kern's contract, and he returned to the stage.<a href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a> He collaborated with Harbach on the Broadway musical <em><a href="The_Cat_and_the_Fiddle_(musical)" title="wikilink">The Cat and the Fiddle</a></em> (1931), about a composer and an opera singer, featuring the songs &quot;<a href="She_Didn&#39;t_Say_Yes" title="wikilink">She Didn't Say Yes</a>&quot; and &quot;The Night Was Made for Love&quot;.

<p><em><a href="Music_in_the_Air" title="wikilink">Music in the Air</a></em> (1932) was another Kern-Hammerstein collaboration and another show-biz plot, best remembered today for &quot;<a href="The_Song_Is_You_(song)" title="wikilink">The Song Is You</a>&quot; and &quot;<a href="I&#39;ve_Told_Ev&#39;ry_Little_Star" title="wikilink">I've Told Ev'ry Little Star</a>&quot;. It was &quot;undoubtedly an operetta&quot;, set in the German countryside, but without the Ruritanian trimmings of the operettas of Kern's youth.<a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a> <em><a href="Roberta_(musical)" title="wikilink">Roberta</a></em> (1933) by Kern and Harbach included the songs &quot;<a href="Smoke_Gets_in_Your_Eyes" title="wikilink">Smoke Gets in Your Eyes</a>&quot;, &quot;<a href="Let&#39;s_Begin" title="wikilink">Let's Begin</a> and &quot;<a href="Yesterdays_(1933_song)" title="wikilink">Yesterdays</a>&quot; and featured, among others, <a href="Bob_Hope" title="wikilink">Bob Hope</a>, <a href="Fred_MacMurray" title="wikilink">Fred MacMurray</a>, <a href="George_Murphy" title="wikilink">George Murphy</a> and <a href="Sydney_Greenstreet" title="wikilink">Sydney Greenstreet</a> all in the early stages of their careers. Kern's <em>Three Sisters</em> (1934), was his last West End show, with a libretto by Hammerstein. The musical, depicting horse-racing, the circus, and class distinctions, was a failure, running for only two months, despite what seems to have been an excellent Kern score (it was never published and much of the original material is lost).<a href="#fn69" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref69"><sup>69</sup></a><a href="#fn70" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a> Some British critics objected to American writers essaying a British story;<a href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a> <a href="James_Agate" title="wikilink">James Agate</a>, doyen of London theatre critics of the day, dismissed it as &quot;American inanity,&quot;<a href="#fn72" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref72"><sup>72</sup></a> though both Kern and Hammerstein were strong and knowledgeable Anglophiles.<a href="#fn73" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref73"><sup>73</sup></a> Kern's last Broadway show (other than revivals) was <em><a href="Very_Warm_for_May" title="wikilink">Very Warm for May</a></em> (1939), another show-biz story and another disappointment, although the score included the Kern and Hammerstein classic &quot;<a href="All_The_Things_You_Are" title="wikilink">All The Things You Are</a>&quot;.<a href="#fn74" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref74"><sup>74</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="kern-in-hollywood">Kern in Hollywood</h3>
<p>In 1935, when musical films had become popular once again, thanks to <a href="Busby_Berkeley" title="wikilink">Busby Berkeley</a>,<a href="#fn75" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref75"><sup>75</sup></a> Kern returned to Hollywood, where he composed the scores to a dozen more films, although he also continued working on Broadway productions. He settled permanently in Hollywood in 1937. After suffering a heart attack in 1939, he was told by his doctors to concentrate on film scores, a less stressful task, as Hollywood songwriters were not as deeply involved with the production of their works as Broadway songwriters. This second phase of Kern's Hollywood career had considerably greater artistic and commercial success than the first. With Hammerstein, he wrote songs for the film versions of his recent Broadway shows <em>Music in the Air</em> (1934), which starred <a href="Gloria_Swanson" title="wikilink">Gloria Swanson</a> in a rare singing role, and <em>Sweet Adeline</em> (1935). With <a href="Dorothy_Fields" title="wikilink">Dorothy Fields</a>, he composed the new music for <em><a href="I_Dream_Too_Much" title="wikilink">I Dream Too Much</a></em> (1935), a musical melodrama about the opera world, starring the <a href="Metropolitan_Opera" title="wikilink">Metropolitan Opera</a> diva <a href="Lily_Pons" title="wikilink">Lily Pons</a>. Kern and Fields interspersed the opera numbers with their songs, including &quot;the swinging 'I Got Love,' the lullaby 'The Jockey on the Carousel,' and the entrancing title song.&quot;<a href="#fn76" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref76"><sup>76</sup></a> Also with Fields, he wrote two new songs, &quot;<a href="I_Won&#39;t_Dance" title="wikilink">I Won't Dance</a>&quot; and &quot;Lovely to Look At&quot;, for the Fred Astaire and <a href="Ginger_Rogers" title="wikilink">Ginger Rogers</a> film version of <em><a href="Roberta_(1935_film)" title="wikilink">Roberta</a></em> (1935), which was a hit. The show also included the song &quot;<a href="I&#39;ll_Be_Hard_to_Handle" title="wikilink">I'll Be Hard to Handle</a>&quot;. This was given a 1952 remake called <em><a href="Lovely_to_Look_At" title="wikilink">Lovely to Look At</a></em>.<a href="#fn77" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref77"><sup>77</sup></a></p>
<p>Their next film, <em><a href="Swing_Time" title="wikilink">Swing Time</a></em> (1936) included the song &quot;<a href="The_Way_You_Look_Tonight" title="wikilink">The Way You Look Tonight</a>&quot;, which won the <a href="Academy_Awards" title="wikilink">Academy Award</a> in 1936 for the best song. Other songs in <em>Swing Time</em> include &quot;<a href="A_Fine_Romance_(song)" title="wikilink">A Fine Romance</a>&quot;, &quot;<a href="Pick_Yourself_Up" title="wikilink">Pick Yourself Up</a>&quot; and &quot;<a href="Never_Gonna_Dance_(song)" title="wikilink">Never Gonna Dance</a>&quot;. <em>The Oxford Companion to the American Musical</em> calls <em>Swing Time</em> &quot;a strong candidate for the best of the Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers musicals&quot; and says that, although the screenplay is contrived, it &quot;left plenty of room for dance and all of it was superb. &lt;U+2026&gt; Although the movie is remembered as one of the great dance musicals, it also boasts one of the best film scores of the 1930s.&quot;<a href="#fn78" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref78"><sup>78</sup></a> For the <a href="Show_Boat_(1936_film)" title="wikilink">1936 film version of <em>Show Boat</em></a>, Kern and Hammerstein wrote three new songs, including &quot;I Have The Room Above Her&quot; and &quot;Ah Still Suits Me&quot;.<a href="#fn79" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref79"><sup>79</sup></a> <em><a href="High,_Wide,_and_Handsome" title="wikilink">High, Wide, and Handsome</a></em> (1937) was intentionally similar in plot and style to <em>Show Boat</em>&quot;, but it was a box-office failure. Kern songs were also used in the <a href="Cary_Grant" title="wikilink">Cary Grant</a> film, <em><a href="When_You&#39;re_in_Love_(film)" title="wikilink">When You're in Love</a></em> (1937), and the first <a href="Abbott_and_Costello" title="wikilink">Abbott and Costello</a> feature, <em><a href="One_Night_in_the_Tropics" title="wikilink">One Night in the Tropics</a></em> (1940). In 1940, Hammerstein wrote the lyric &quot;<a href="The_Last_Time_I_Saw_Paris_(song)" title="wikilink">The Last Time I Saw Paris</a>&quot;, in homage to the French capital, recently occupied by the Germans. Kern set it, the only time he set a pre-written lyric, and his only hit song not written as part of a musical.<a href="#fn80" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref80"><sup>80</sup></a> Originally a hit for <a href="Tony_Martin_(entertainer)" title="wikilink">Tony Martin</a> and later for <a href="No&lt;U+00EB&gt;l_Coward" title="wikilink">No&lt;U+00EB&gt;l Coward</a>, the song was used in the film <em><a href="Lady_Be_Good_(1941_film)" title="wikilink">Lady Be Good</a></em> (1941) and won Kern another Oscar for best song. Kern's second and last symphonic work was his '<a href="Mark_Twain" title="wikilink">Mark Twain</a> Suite'' (1942).<a href="#fn81" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref81"><sup>81</sup></a></p>
<p>In his last Hollywood musicals, Kern worked with several new and distinguished partners. With <a href="Johnny_Mercer" title="wikilink">Johnny Mercer</a> for <em><a href="You_Were_Never_Lovelier" title="wikilink">You Were Never Lovelier</a></em> (1942), he contributed &quot;a set of memorable songs to entertain audiences until the plot came to its inevitable conclusion&quot;.<a href="#fn82" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref82"><sup>82</sup></a> The film starred Astaire and <a href="Rita_Hayworth" title="wikilink">Rita Hayworth</a> and included the song &quot;<a href="I&#39;m_Old_Fashioned" title="wikilink">I'm Old Fashioned</a>&quot;. Kern's next collaboration was with <a href="Ira_Gershwin" title="wikilink">Ira Gershwin</a> on <em><a href="Cover_Girl_(film)" title="wikilink">Cover Girl</a></em> starring Hayworth and <a href="Gene_Kelly" title="wikilink">Gene Kelly</a> (1944) for which Kern composed &quot;Sure Thing&quot;,&quot;Put Me to the Test,&quot; &quot;Make Way for Tomorrow&quot; (lyric by <a href="E._Y._Harburg" title="wikilink">E.

<p>Kern composed his last film score, <em><a href="Centennial_Summer" title="wikilink">Centennial Summer</a></em> (1946) in which &quot;the songs were as resplendent as the story and characters were mediocre. &lt;U+2026&gt; Oscar Hammerstein, <a href="Leo_Robin" title="wikilink">Leo Robin</a>, and E. Y. Harburg contributed lyrics for Kern's lovely music, resulting in the soulful ballad 'All Through the Day,' the rustic 'Cinderella Sue,' the cheerful 'Up With the Lark,' and the <a href="Torch_song" title="wikilink">torchy</a> 'In Love in Vain.'&quot; &quot;All Through the Day&quot; was another Oscar nominee.<a href="#fn85" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref85"><sup>85</sup></a> The music of Kern's last two films is notable in the way it developed from his earlier work.

<p>Note: All shows listed are musical comedies for which Kern was the sole composer unless otherwise specified.</p>

During visits to London beginning in 1905, he also composed songs that were first performed in several London shows.
