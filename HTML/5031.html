From 1970 to 1972, he taught, coached, and served as principal in <a href="Marquette,_Nebraska" title="wikilink">Marquette</a>.

<p>In May 2004, a large <a href="2004_Hallam,_Nebraska_tornado" title="wikilink">tornado</a> destroyed the village of <a href="Hallam,_Nebraska" title="wikilink">Hallam</a> and then struck the Norris campus, causing $35 million in damage to the school.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a><a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> Baker took charge of reconstruction efforts, declaring &quot;In an extreme crisis such as this, authoritarian leadership is not only OK, it is most appropriate.&quot;<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> By expediting contracting and construction, and through the use of portable classrooms, the school was able to re-open for the fall semester shortly after <a href="Labor_Day" title="wikilink">Labor Day</a>. For his efforts, Baker was named Superintendent of the Year by the Nebraska Council of School Administrators.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a><a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a><a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>

<h3 id="election">2014 election</h3>
<p>In September 2013, Baker announced that he would run for the Nebraska Legislature from District 30. The district, consisting of <a href="Gage_County,_Nebraska" title="wikilink">Gage County</a> and part of southern <a href="Lancaster_County,_Nebraska" title="wikilink">Lancaster County</a>, included the cities of <a href="Beatrice,_Nebraska" title="wikilink">Beatrice</a> and <a href="Wymore,_Nebraska" title="wikilink">Wymore</a>, and portions of southern and western <a href="Lincoln,_Nebraska" title="wikilink">Lincoln</a>. Incumbent <a href="Norm_Wallman" title="wikilink">Norm Wallman</a>, a member of the <a href="Democratic_Party_(United_States)" title="wikilink">Democratic Party</a>, was barred by Nebraska's <a href="Term_limit" title="wikilink">term-limits</a> law from running for a third consecutive term.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a><a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a><a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a><a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a><a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a></p>
<p>A second candidate, like Baker a <a href="Republican_Party_(United_States)" title="wikilink">Republican</a>,<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> joined the race in February 2014. Bob Tiemann, the owner of a Beatrice construction firm,<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> had sought the District 30 seat twice before. In 1982,<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> he had come in last in a three-way primary, with 16.6% of the vote;<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> in the 2010 primary election, he had again placed third of three, this time with 26.2% of the vote.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a></p>
<p>In the nonpartisan primary election, Tiemann received 3720 of the 7167 votes cast, or 51.9% of the total. Baker obtained 3447 votes, or 48.1%.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a></p>
<h4 id="general-election">2014 general election</h4>
<p>Since only two candidates had run in the primary, both moved on to the general election. Baker declared &quot;I don't breathe partisan fire&quot;,<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> and stated that the Nebraska legislature was &quot;officially nonpartisan, and I think it ought to stay that way&quot;.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> Tiemann stated that the district needed to elect a businessman who knew how to budget, and that a Gage County resident would better represent the district; Baker asserted that he had learned to manage on a limited budget as a school superintendent, and that he would be one of the few legislators who understood Nebraska's state-aid-to-schools formula.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a></p>
<p>On specific issues, Baker supported the proposed expansion of <a href="Medicaid" class="uri" title="wikilink">Medicaid</a> in Nebraska under the provisions of the 2010 <a href="Patient_Protection_and_Affordable_Care_Act" title="wikilink">Affordable Care Act</a>; Tiemann was inclined to oppose the expansion, lest the federal government renege on its pledge to reimburse states for the increased costs.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> Baker supported retaining a state law offering in-state tuition rates to persons who were residing illegally in the United States after being brought into the country as children, and who were granted an exemption from deportation under the <a href="Barack_Obama" title="wikilink">Barack Obama</a> administration's <a href="Deferred_Action_for_Childhood_Arrivals" title="wikilink">Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals</a> (DACA) program; Tiemann opposed this tuition policy.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> Tiemann favored retaining the state's policy of denying driver's licenses to DACA beneficiaries; Baker opposed the policy.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> Both candidates supported capital punishment, with reservations;<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> both supported a ballot measure to increase the state's minimum wage.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a></p>
<p>Over the course of the whole campaign, Baker raised over $46,000 and spent over $50,000. Major contributors included the Nebraska State Education Association, which furnished $9,000; the Nebraska Hospital Association, which contributed $5,000; and the Associated General Contractors Highway Improvement PAC, which supplied $4,000.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> Tiemann raised almost $30,000 and spent the same. His major institutional contributors included the Nebraska Chamber of Commerce and Industry, which supplied over $5,000, and the Greater Omaha Chamber of Commerce, which furnished $1,000; the Nebraska Farm Bureau Federation, which contributed over $4,000; and the Nebraska Realtors, which provided $3,000. Tiemann also received $2,500 from Republican gubernatorial candidate <a href="Pete_Ricketts" title="wikilink">Pete Ricketts</a>.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> The Nebraska Bankers Association gave $2,500 to each campaign.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a><a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a></p>
<p>When the general election was held in November 2014, Baker received 6565 of the 11,712 votes cast, or 56.1% of the total. Tiemann obtained 5147 votes, or 43.9%.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="legislative-tenure">Legislative tenure</h3>
<p>In the 2015 session of the legislature, Baker was appointed to the Education Committee and the Health and Human Services Committee. He was one of three legislators named to represent Nebraska in the interstate <a href="Education_Commission_of_the_States" title="wikilink">Education Commission of the States</a>.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a></p>
