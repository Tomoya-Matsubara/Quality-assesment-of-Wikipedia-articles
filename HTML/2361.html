The Reina Victoria Eugenia class was to be based on them." /> The <strong><em>Reina Victoria Eugenia</em></strong> class was a class of three <a href="battleship" title="wikilink">battleships</a> of the <a href="Spanish_Navy" title="wikilink">Spanish Navy</a> authorized as the <em>Plan de la Segunda Escuadra</em> under the Navy Law of 1913. The class, as well as the lead ship, were named for <a href="King_Alfonso_XIII" title="wikilink">King Alfonso XIII</a>'s English <a href="Victoria_Eugenie_of_Battenberg" title="wikilink">queen consort</a>. The other two ships were classified as &quot;B&quot; and &quot;C&quot;. It was supposed to be designed by <a href="Vickers-Armstrongs" class="uri" title="wikilink">Vickers-Armstrongs</a>, and built by <a href="John_Brown_&amp;_Company" title="wikilink">John Brown</a>. The ships were never built due to Britain's involvement in <a href="World_War_I" title="wikilink">World War I</a>, which halted all foreign projects being constructed in British yards.</p>
<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>Following disastrous losses in the <a href="Spanish-American_War" title="wikilink">Spanish-American War</a> of 1898, Spain lacked the money to rebuild its navy, so it was not until the Navy Law of 7 January 1908 that a new program authorizing three new battleships, the  (<a href="Spanish_battleship_Espa&lt;U+00F1&gt;a_(1912)" title="wikilink"><em>Espa&lt;U+00F1&gt;a</em></a>, <a href="Spanish_battleship_Alfonso_XIII" title="wikilink"><em>Alfonso XIII</em></a>, and <a href="Spanish_battleship_Jaime_I" title="wikilink"><em>Jaime I</em></a>), along with other ships, was passed. The delay enabled Spain to take advantage of experience gained by Britain with the world's first commissioned <a href="dreadnought" class="uri" title="wikilink">dreadnought</a>, , and by the United States with its first dreadnought, . As Spain was incapable of building the <em>Espa&lt;U+00F1&gt;a</em> class herself due to a lack of resources,<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> Armstrongs were contracted for the design and <a href="John_Brown_&amp;_Company" title="wikilink">John Brown</a> for the construction of the shipyard and ships themselves.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>A second Navy Law was passed in 1912 named the <em>Plan de la Segunda Escuadra</em> (Second Squadron Plan). It called for, among several other ships, three dreadnoughts to supplement the <em>Espa&lt;U+00F1&gt;a</em> class. These dreadnoughts were named the <em>Reina Victoria Eugenia</em> class. They were to be in laid down in 1914 and 1915 and completed around 1920.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="design-history">Design history</h2>
<p>The class consisted of three ships, <em>Reina Victoria Eugenia</em>, the lead ship, and two others named <em>B</em> and <em>C</em>. The lead ship was named after King Alfonso's English wife.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> They were designed by Vickers-Armstrongs and were planned to displace  with a speed of .<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> Early plans for the type called for an armament of four twin  guns; however, financial difficulties resulted in the selection of an armament of four twin  guns instead, which still would have had a longer range than most contemporary ships.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> The secondary armament would have been 20  guns.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> Other specifications of the ships were never decided upon, although it is probable that they would have resembled contemporary British ships, with two closely spaced funnels along with super-imposed turrets fore and aft.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p>As with the <em>Espa&lt;U+00F1&gt;a</em>-class battleships, significant technical assistance from Britain would have been required. The outbreak of the First World War led to both the delay of the <em>Espa&lt;U+00F1&gt;a</em> class and the cancellation of the <em>Reina Victoria Eugenia</em> project. Since Spain did not sign the <a href="Washington_Naval_Treaty" title="wikilink">Washington Naval Treaty</a>, whose signatories were forced to limit their ships to no more than 35,000 tons, the class was available for future Spanish governments to construct, either as a main ship or as support to other planned designs, like a possible  or a ship based on the . However, the class was never constructed.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
