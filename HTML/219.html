<p><strong>Saint Joan of Arc</strong> or <strong>The Maid of Orl&lt;U+00E9&gt;ans</strong> (,<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> ; ca. 1412<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a>Â &lt;U+2013&gt; 30 May 1431) is considered a national <a href="hero" title="wikilink">heroine</a> of France and a <a href="Roman_Catholic" title="wikilink">Catholic</a> <a href="saint" class="uri" title="wikilink">saint</a>. A <a href="peasant" class="uri" title="wikilink">peasant</a> girl born in eastern France who claimed Divine guidance, she led the French army to several important victories during the <a href="Hundred_Years&#39;_War" title="wikilink">Hundred Years' War</a> which paved the way for the coronation of <a href="Charles_VII_of_France" title="wikilink">Charles VII</a>. She was captured by the <a href="Burgundian_(party)" title="wikilink">Burgundians</a>, sold to the English, tried by an <a href="Ecclesiology" title="wikilink">ecclesiastical</a> court, and burned at the stake when she was nineteen years old.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> Twenty-five years after the execution, <a href="Pope_Callixtus_III" title="wikilink">Pope Callixtus III</a> examined the trial, pronounced her innocent and declared her a <a href="martyr" class="uri" title="wikilink">martyr</a>.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> She was <a href="Beatification" title="wikilink">beatified</a> in 1909 and <a href="Canonization" title="wikilink">canonized</a> in 1920.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> She is, along with <a href="St._Denis" title="wikilink">St. Denis</a>, <a href="St._Martin_of_Tours" title="wikilink">St. Martin of Tours</a>, <a href="St._Louis_IX" title="wikilink">St. Louis IX</a>, and <a href="St._Theresa_of_Lisieux" title="wikilink">St. Theresa of Lisieux</a>, one of the <a href="patron_saint" title="wikilink">patron saints</a> of France.</p>
<p>Joan asserted that she had visions from God which instructed her to recover her homeland from <a href="Kingdom_of_England" title="wikilink">English</a> domination late in the <a href="Hundred_Years&#39;_War" title="wikilink">Hundred Years' War</a>. The uncrowned King Charles VII sent her to the <a href="siege_of_Orl&lt;U+00E9&gt;ans" title="wikilink">siege of Orl&lt;U+00E9&gt;ans</a> as part of a relief mission. She gained prominence when she overcame the dismissive attitude of veteran commanders and lifted the siege in only nine days. Several more swift victories led to Charles VII's coronation at <a href="Reims" class="uri" title="wikilink">Reims</a> and settled the disputed succession to the throne.</p>

<p>The historian <a href="Kelly_DeVries" title="wikilink">Kelly DeVries</a> describes the period preceding her appearance in the following terms: &quot;If anything could have discouraged her, the state of France in 1429 should have.&quot; The <a href="Hundred_Years&#39;_War" title="wikilink">Hundred Years' War</a> had begun in 1337 as a <a href="English_claims_to_the_French_throne" title="wikilink">succession dispute over the French throne</a> with intermittent periods of relative peace. Nearly all the fighting had taken place in France, and the English army's use of <em><a href="chevauch&lt;U+00E9&gt;e" class="uri" title="wikilink">chevauch&lt;U+00E9&gt;e</a></em> tactics (similar to <a href="scorched_earth" title="wikilink">scorched earth</a> strategies) had devastated the economy.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> The <a href="Medieval_demography" title="wikilink">French population</a> had not recovered from the <a href="Black_Death" title="wikilink">Black Death</a> of the previous century and its merchants were isolated from foreign markets. At the outset of her appearance, the English had nearly achieved their goal of a dual monarchy under English control and the French army had not achieved any major victories for a generation. In DeVries's words, &quot;the kingdom of France was not even a shadow of its thirteenth-century prototype.&quot;<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p>The French king at the time of Joan's birth, <a href="Charles_VI_of_France" title="wikilink">Charles VI</a>, suffered bouts of insanity<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> and was often unable to rule. The king's brother Duke <a href="Louis_of_Valois,_Duke_of_Orl&lt;U+00E9&gt;ans" title="wikilink">Louis of Orl&lt;U+00E9&gt;ans</a> and the king's cousin <a href="John_the_Fearless" title="wikilink">John the Fearless</a>, <a href="Duke_of_Burgundy" title="wikilink">Duke of Burgundy</a>, quarreled over the regency of France and the guardianship of the royal children. This dispute escalated to accusations of an extramarital affair with Queen <a href="Isabeau_of_Bavaria" title="wikilink">Isabeau of Bavaria</a> and the kidnappings of the royal children.. The matter climaxed with the assassination of the Duke of Orl&lt;U+00E9&gt;ans in 1407, on the orders of the Duke of Burgundy.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<p>The factions which were loyal to these two men became known as the <a href="Armagnac_(party)" title="wikilink">Armagnacs</a> and the <a href="Burgundian_(party)" title="wikilink">Burgundians</a>. <a href="Henry_V_of_England" title="wikilink">Henry V of England</a> took advantage of this turmoil to invade France, winning a dramatic <a href="Battle_of_Agincourt" title="wikilink">victory at Agincourt</a> in 1415, and capturing many northern French towns.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> The future French king, <a href="Charles_VII_of_France" title="wikilink">Charles VII</a>, assumed the title of <a href="Dauphin_of_France" title="wikilink">Dauphin</a> &lt;U+2013&gt; the heir to the throne &lt;U+2013&gt; at the age of fourteen, after all four of his older brothers died in succession.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> His first significant official act was to conclude a peace treaty with Burgundy in 1419. This ended in disaster when Armagnac partisans assassinated John the Fearless during a meeting under Charles's guarantee of protection. The new duke of Burgundy, <a href="Philip_III,_Duke_of_Burgundy" title="wikilink">Philip the Good</a>, blamed Charles for the murder and entered into an alliance with the English. Large sections of France were conquered.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1420, Queen Isabeau of Bavaria concluded the <a href="Treaty_of_Troyes" title="wikilink">Treaty of Troyes</a>, which granted the succession of the French throne to Henry V and his heirs instead of her son Charles. This agreement revived rumors about her alleged affair with the late duke of Orl&lt;U+00E9&gt;ans and raised fresh suspicions that the Dauphin was illegitimate rather than the son of the king.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> Henry V and Charles VI died within two months of each other in 1422, leaving an infant, <a href="Henry_VI_of_England" title="wikilink">Henry VI of England</a>, the nominal monarch of both kingdoms. Henry V's brother, John of Lancaster, 1st Duke of Bedford, acted as <a href="regent" class="uri" title="wikilink">regent</a>.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<p>By the beginning of 1429, nearly all of northern France and some parts of the southwest were under foreign control. The English controlled Paris while the Burgundians controlled Rheims, the latter city being the traditional site of French coronations. This was an important consideration since neither claimant to the throne of France had yet been officially crowned. The English had laid siege to Orl&lt;U+00E9&gt;ans, one of the few remaining loyal French cities and a strategic position along the <a href="Loire" class="uri" title="wikilink">Loire</a> River which made it the last obstacle to an assault on the remainder of the French heartland. In the words of one modern historian, &quot;On the fate of Orl&lt;U+00E9&gt;ans hung that of the entire kingdom.&quot;<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> No one was optimistic that the city could long withstand the siege.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>

Several local raids occurred during her childhood and on one occasion her village was burned.</p>
<p>Joan said she was about nineteen at her trial, so she must have been born around the year 1412. She later testified that she experienced her first vision around 1424 at the age of twelve years, when she was out alone in a field and saw visions of figures she identified as <a href="Michael_(archangel)" title="wikilink">Saint Michael</a>, <a href="Catherine_of_Alexandria" title="wikilink">Saint Catherine</a>, and <a href="Saint_Margaret_the_Virgin" title="wikilink">Saint Margaret</a>, who told her to drive out the English and bring the Dauphin to Rheims for his coronation. She said she cried when they left, as they were so beautiful.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>
<p>At the age of sixteen, she asked a kinsman, Durand Lassois, to bring her to nearby <a href="Vaucouleurs" class="uri" title="wikilink">Vaucouleurs</a> where she petitioned the garrison commander, Count <a href="Robert_de_Baudricourt" title="wikilink">Robert de Baudricourt</a>, for permission to visit the royal French court at <a href="Chinon" class="uri" title="wikilink">Chinon</a>.

<p>Robert de Baudricourt granted her an escort to visit Chinon after news from the front confirmed her prediction. She made the journey through hostile Burgundian territory in male disguise.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> Upon arriving at the Royal Court she impressed Charles VII during a private conference. During this time Charles's mother-in-law <a href="Yolande_of_Aragon" title="wikilink">Yolande of Aragon</a> was financing a relief expedition to <a href="Orl&lt;U+00E9&gt;ans" class="uri" title="wikilink">Orl&lt;U+00E9&gt;ans</a>. Joan asked for permission to travel with the army and wear the equipment of a knight. She depended on donated items for her armor, horse, sword, banner, and other items utilized by her entourage. Historian Stephen W. Richey explains her attraction to the Royal Court by pointing out that they may have viewed her as the only source of hope for a regime that was near collapse:</p>

<p>Upon her arrival, Joan effectively turned the longstanding Anglo-French conflict into a religious war.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> But this course of action was not without its risks. Charles' advisers were worried that unless Joan's orthodoxy could be established beyond doubt &lt;U+2014&gt; that she was not a heretic or a sorceress &lt;U+2014&gt; Charles' enemies could easily make the claim that his kingdom was a gift from the Devil. To circumvent this possibility, the Dauphin ordered background inquiries and a theological examination at <a href="Poitiers" class="uri" title="wikilink">Poitiers</a> to verify her morality. In April 1429, the commission of inquiry &quot;declared her to be of irreproachable life, a good Christian, possessed of the virtues of humility, honesty and simplicity.&quot;<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> The theologians at Poitiers did not pass judgment on her divine inspiration; rather, they informed the Dauphin that there was a 'favorable presumption' to be made on the divine nature of her mission. This was enough for Charles, but they put the ball back in his court by stating that he had an obligation to put Joan to the test. 'To doubt or abandon her without suspicion of evil would be to repudiate the Holy Spirit and to become unworthy of God's aid', they declared.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> The test for the truth of her claims would be the raising of the siege of <a href="Orl&lt;U+00E9&gt;ans" class="uri" title="wikilink">Orl&lt;U+00E9&gt;ans</a>.</p>
<p>She arrived at the <a href="siege_of_Orl&lt;U+00E9&gt;ans" title="wikilink">siege of Orl&lt;U+00E9&gt;ans</a> on 29 April 1429, but <a href="Jean_de_Dunois" title="wikilink">Jean d'Orl&lt;U+00E9&gt;ans</a>, the acting head of the Orl&lt;U+00E9&gt;ans ducal family, initially excluded her from war councils and failed to inform her when the army engaged the enemy.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> This did not prevent her from being present at most councils and battles. The extent of her actual military leadership is a subject of historical debate. Traditional historians such as &lt;U+00C9&gt;douard Perroy conclude that she was a standard bearer whose primary effect was on morale.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> This type of analysis usually relies on the condemnation trial testimony, where she stated that she preferred her standard to her sword. Recent scholarship that focuses on the nullification trial testimony asserts that the army's commanders esteemed her as a skilled tactician and a successful strategist. Stephen W. Richey's opinion is one example: <em>&quot;She proceeded to lead the army in an astounding series of victories that reversed the tide of the war.&quot;</em><a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> In either case, historians agree that the army enjoyed remarkable success during her brief career.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="leadership">Leadership</h3>
<p>She rejected the cautious strategy that had characterized French leadership during previous campaigns. During the five months of siege before her arrival, the defenders of Orl&lt;U+00E9&gt;ans had attempted only one aggressive move and that had ended in disaster. On 4 May the French attacked and captured the outlying fortress of Saint Loup, which she followed on 5 May with a march to a second fortress called Saint Jean le Blanc, which was found deserted. The next day she opposed Jean d'Orleans at a war council where she demanded another assault on the enemy. D'Orleans ordered the city gates locked to prevent another battle, but she summoned the townsmen and common soldiers and forced the mayor to unlock a gate. With the aid of only one captain she rode out and captured the fortress of Saint Augustins. That evening she learned she had been excluded from a war council where the leaders had decided to wait for reinforcements before acting again. Disregarding this decision, she insisted on attacking the main English stronghold called <em>&quot;les Tourelles&quot;</em> on 7 May.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> Contemporaries acknowledged her as the heroine of the engagement after she was wounded in the neck by an arrow but returned to lead the final charge.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a></p>

<p>The sudden victory at Orl&lt;U+00E9&gt;ans led to many proposals for further offensive action. The English expected an attempt to recapture Paris or an attack on Normandy.

The Duke of Alen&lt;U+00E7&gt;on agreed to all of Joan's decisions. Other commanders including Jean d'Orl&lt;U+00E9&gt;ans had been impressed with her performance at Orl&lt;U+00E9&gt;ans and became her supporters. Alen&lt;U+00E7&gt;on credited her with saving his life at Jargeau, where she warned him of an imminent artillery attack.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> During the same battle she withstood a blow from a stone cannonball to her helmet as she climbed a scaling ladder.

The <a href="Battle_of_Patay" title="wikilink">battle at Patay</a> might be compared to <a href="Battle_of_Agincourt" title="wikilink">Agincourt</a> in reverse. The French vanguard attacked before the English <a href="English_longbow" title="wikilink">archers</a> could finish defensive preparations. A rout ensued that decimated the main body of the English army and killed or captured most of its commanders.

Duke Philip the Good broke the agreement, using it as a stalling tactic to reinforce the defense of Paris.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> The French army marched through towns near Paris during the interim and accepted more peaceful surrenders. The Duke of Bedford headed an English force and confronted the French army in a standoff on 15 August. The French assault at Paris ensued on 8 September. Despite a wound to the leg from a crossbow bolt, Joan continued directing the troops until the day's fighting ended. The following morning she received a royal order to withdraw.

<p><span style="white-space:nowrap">It was customary</span> for a captive's family to ransom a <a href="prisoner_of_war" title="wikilink">prisoner of war</a>. Joan was in an unusual circumstance. Many historians condemn King <a href="Charles_VII_of_France" title="wikilink">Charles VII</a> for failing to intervene. She attempted several escapes, on one occasion jumping from her 70 foot (21 m) tower in <a href="Vermandois" class="uri" title="wikilink">Vermandois</a> to the soft earth of a dry moat, after which she was moved to the Burgundian town of <a href="Arras" class="uri" title="wikilink">Arras</a>.

Bishop <a href="Pierre_Cauchon" title="wikilink">Pierre Cauchon</a> of <a href="Beauvais" class="uri" title="wikilink">Beauvais</a>, an English partisan, assumed a prominent role in these negotiations and her later trial.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a></p>

<p>The trial for <a href="Christian_heresy" title="wikilink">heresy</a> was politically motivated. The Duke of Bedford claimed the throne of France on behalf of his nephew Henry VI. Joan had been responsible for the rival coronation, hence condemning her was an attempt to undermine her king's legitimacy. Legal proceedings commenced on 9 January 1431 at <a href="Rouen" class="uri" title="wikilink">Rouen</a>, the seat of the English occupation government.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a> The procedure was irregular on a number of points.</p>

<p>To summarize some major problems: Under ecclesiastical law, Bishop Cauchon lacked <a href="jurisdiction" class="uri" title="wikilink">jurisdiction</a> over the case.<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> He owed his appointment to his partisan support of the English government which financed the trial. Clerical notary Nicolas Bailly, commissioned to collect testimony against Joan, could find no adverse evidence.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a> Without such evidence the court lacked grounds to initiate a trial. Opening a trial anyway, the court also violated ecclesiastical law in denying her right to a legal adviser. Upon the opening of the first public examination Joan complained that those present were all partisans against her and asked for &quot;ecclesiastics of the French side&quot; to be invited.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a></p>
<p>The trial record demonstrates her remarkable intellect. The transcript's most famous exchange is an exercise in subtlety. &quot;Asked if she knew she was in God's grace, she answered: 'If I am not, may God put me there; and if I am, may God so keep me.'&quot;<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a> The question is a scholarly trap. Church doctrine holds that no one can be certain of being in God's grace. If she had answered yes, then she would have convicted herself of heresy. If she had answered no, then she would have confessed her own guilt. Notary Boisguillaume later testified that at the moment the court heard this reply, &quot;Those who were interrogating her were stupefied.&quot;<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a> In the twentieth century <a href="George_Bernard_Shaw" title="wikilink">George Bernard Shaw</a> found this dialogue so compelling that sections of his play <em><a href="Saint_Joan_(play)" title="wikilink">Saint Joan</a></em> are literal translations of the trial record.<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a></p>
<p>Several court functionaries later testified that significant portions of the transcript were altered in her disfavor. Many clerics served under compulsion, including the inquisitor, Jean LeMaitre, and a few even received death threats from the English. Under <a href="Inquisition" title="wikilink">Inquisitorial</a> guidelines, Joan should have been confined to an <a href="ecclesiology" title="wikilink">ecclesiastical</a> prison under the supervision of female guards (i.e., nuns). Instead, the English kept her in a <a href="Secularity_(non-religiosity)" title="wikilink">secular</a> prison guarded by their own soldiers. Bishop Cauchon denied Joan's appeals to the <a href="Council_of_Basel" title="wikilink">Council of Basel</a> and the pope, which should have stopped his proceeding.<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a></p>

<p><a href="Heresy" class="uri" title="wikilink">Heresy</a> was a capital crime only for a repeat offense. Joan agreed to wear feminine clothing when she abjured. A few days later she told a tribunal member that &quot;a great English lord had entered her prison and tried to take her by force.&quot;<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a> She resumed male attire either as a defense against molestation or, in the testimony of Jean Massieu, because her dress had been stolen and she was left with nothing else to wear.<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a> In terms of doctrine, she had been safe to disguise herself as a page during her journey through enemy territory and she was safe to wear armor during battle. The <em>Chronique de la Pucelle</em> states that it deterred molestation while she was camped in the field. Clergy who later testified at the posthumous rehabilitation trial affirmed that she continued to wear male clothing in prison to deter molestation and rape.<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a> Preservation of <a href="chastity" class="uri" title="wikilink">chastity</a> was another justifiable reason for cross-dressing: her apparel would have slowed an assailant, and men would be less likely to think of her as a sex object in any case.<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a> She referred the court to the Poitiers inquiry when questioned on the matter. The Poitiers record no longer survives but circumstances indicate the Poitiers clerics had approved her practice. In other words, she had a mission to do a man's work so it was fitting that she dress the part.<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a> She also kept her hair cut short through her military campaigns and while in prison. Her supporters, such as the theologian <a href="Jean_Gerson" title="wikilink">Jean Gerson</a>, defended her hairstyle, as did Inquisitor Brehal later during the Rehabilitation trial.<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a> Nonetheless, at the trial in 1431 she was condemned and sentenced to die.</p>
<p>Eyewitnesses described the scene of the <a href="Death_by_burning" title="wikilink">execution by burning</a> on 30 May 1431. Tied to a tall pillar in the Vieux-Marche in Rouen, she asked two of the clergy, Fr Martin Ladvenu and Fr Isambart de la Pierre, to hold a <a href="crucifix" class="uri" title="wikilink">crucifix</a> before her. A peasant also constructed a small cross which she put in the front of her dress. After she expired, the English raked back the coals to expose her charred body so that no one could claim she had escaped alive, then burned the body twice more to reduce it to ashes and prevent any collection of relics. They cast her remains into the <a href="Seine" class="uri" title="wikilink">Seine</a>.<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a> The executioner, Geoffroy Therage, later stated that he &quot;...greatly feared to be damned.&quot;<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a></p>

<p>The Hundred Years' War continued for twenty-two years after her death. Charles VII succeeded in retaining legitimacy as the king of France in spite of a rival coronation held for Henry VI in December 1431 on the boy's tenth birthday. Before England could rebuild its military leadership and force of longbowmen, lost in 1429, the country lost its alliance with Burgundy at the <a href="Treaty_of_Arras_(1435)" title="wikilink">Treaty of Arras</a> in 1435. The Duke of Bedford died the same year and Henry VI became the youngest king of England to rule without a regent; his weak leadership was probably the most important factor in ending the conflict. Kelly DeVries argues that Joan of Arc's aggressive use of artillery and frontal assaults influenced French tactics for the rest of the war.<a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1452, during the posthumous investigation into her execution, the Church declared that a religious play in her honor at Orl&lt;U+00E9&gt;ans would qualify as a <a href="pilgrimage" class="uri" title="wikilink">pilgrimage</a> meriting an <a href="indulgence" class="uri" title="wikilink">indulgence</a>.</p>
<h3 id="retrial">Retrial</h3>

<p>A posthumous retrial opened after the war ended. <a href="Pope_Callixtus_III" title="wikilink">Pope Callixtus III</a> authorized this proceeding, also known as the &quot;nullification trial&quot;, at the request of Inquisitor-General <a href="Jean_Brehal" title="wikilink">Jean Brehal</a> and Joan's mother Isabelle Rom&lt;U+00E9&gt;e. The aim of the trial was to investigate whether the trial of condemnation and its verdict had been handled justly and according to canon law. Investigations started with an inquest by a priest, Guillaume Bouille. Brehal conducted an investigation in 1452. A formal appeal followed in November 1455. The appellate process involved clergy from throughout Europe and observed standard court procedure. A panel of theologians analyzed testimony from 115 witnesses. Brehal drew up his final summary in June 1456, which describes Joan as a martyr and implicated the late Pierre Cauchon with heresy for having convicted an innocent woman in pursuit of a <a href="Secularism" title="wikilink">secular</a> vendetta. The technical reason for her execution had been a Biblical clothing law.<a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a> The nullification trial reversed the conviction in part because the condemnation proceeding had failed to consider the doctrinal exceptions to that stricture. The appellate court declared her innocent on 7 July 1456.<a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="canonization">Canonization</h2>

<p>She became a symbol of the <a href="Catholic_League_(French)" title="wikilink">Catholic League</a> during the 16th century. When <a href="F&lt;U+00E9&gt;lix_Dupanloup" title="wikilink">F&lt;U+00E9&gt;lix Dupanloup</a> was made bishop of Orl&lt;U+00E9&gt;ans in 1849, he pronounced a fervid panegyric on Joan of Arc, which attracted attention in England as well as France and he led the efforts which culminated in Joan of Arc's beatification in 1909. <a href="Pope_Benedict_XV" title="wikilink">Pope Benedict XV</a> canonized Joan on 16 May 1920. As Saint Joan of Arc, she has become one of the most popular saints of the Roman Catholic Church.<a href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="legacy">Legacy</h2>
<p>Joan of Arc became a semi-legendary figure for the next four centuries. The main sources of information about her were chronicles. Five original manuscripts of her condemnation trial surfaced in old archives during the 19th century. Soon historians also located the complete records of her rehabilitation trial, which contained sworn testimony from 115 witnesses, and the original French notes for the Latin condemnation trial transcript. Various contemporary letters also emerged, three of which carry the signature <em>&quot;Jehanne&quot;</em> in the unsteady hand of a person learning to write.<a href="#fn67" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a> This unusual wealth of primary source material is one reason DeVries declares, &quot;No person of the Middle Ages, male or female, has been the subject of more study&quot;.<a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a></p>

<p>Joan of Arc came from an obscure village and rose to prominence when she was a teenager, and she did so as an uneducated peasant. The French and English kings had justified the ongoing war through competing interpretations of the thousand-year-old <a href="Salic_law" title="wikilink">Salic law</a>. The conflict had been an inheritance feud between monarchs. She gave meaning to appeals such as that of squire Jean de Metz when he asked, &quot;Must the king be driven from the kingdom; and are we to be English?&quot;<a href="#fn69" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref69"><sup>69</sup></a> In the words of Stephen Richey, &quot;She turned what had been a dry dynastic squabble that left the common people unmoved except for their own suffering into a passionately popular war of national liberation.&quot;<a href="#fn70" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a> Richey also expresses the breadth of her subsequent appeal:</p>

<p>Joan of Arc was not a feminist. She operated within a religious tradition that believed an exceptional person from any level of society might receive a divine calling. She expelled women from the French army and may have struck one stubborn camp follower with the flat of a sword.<a href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a><a href="#fn72" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref72"><sup>72</sup></a> Nonetheless, some of her most significant aid came from women. King Charles VII's mother-in-law, Yolande of Aragon, confirmed Joan's virginity and financed her departure to Orl&lt;U+00E9&gt;ans. Joan of Luxembourg, aunt to the count of Luxembourg who held custody of her after Compi&lt;U+00E8&gt;gne, alleviated her conditions of captivity and may have delayed her sale to the English. Finally, <a href="Anne_of_Burgundy" title="wikilink">Anne of Burgundy</a>, the duchess of Bedford and wife to the regent of England, declared Joan a virgin during pretrial inquiries.<a href="#fn73" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref73"><sup>73</sup></a> For technical reasons this prevented the court from charging her with <a href="witchcraft" class="uri" title="wikilink">witchcraft</a>. Ultimately this provided part of the basis for her vindication and sainthood. From <a href="Christine_de_Pizan" title="wikilink">Christine de Pizan</a> to the present, women have looked to her as a positive example of a brave and active female.<a href="#fn74" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref74"><sup>74</sup></a></p>

<p>Joan of Arc has been a political symbol in France since the time of <a href="Napoleon" class="uri" title="wikilink">Napoleon</a>. <a href="Classical_liberalism" title="wikilink">Liberals</a> emphasised her humble origins. Early <a href="Conservatism" title="wikilink">conservatives</a> stressed her support of the <a href="monarchy" class="uri" title="wikilink">monarchy</a>. Later conservatives recalled her nationalism. During World War II, both the <a href="Vichy_France" title="wikilink">Vichy Regime</a> and the <a href="French_Resistance" title="wikilink">French Resistance</a> used her image: Vichy propaganda remembered her campaign against the English with posters that showed British warplanes bombing Rouen and the ominous caption: <em>&quot;They Always Return to the Scene of Their Crimes.&quot;</em> The resistance emphasised her fight against foreign occupation and her origins in the province of <a href="Moselle" title="wikilink">Lorraine</a>, which had fallen under <a href="Nazism" title="wikilink">Nazi</a> control.</p>
<p>Three separate vessels of the <a href="French_Navy" title="wikilink">French Navy</a> have been named after her, including a <a href="Jeanne_d&#39;Arc_(R_97)" title="wikilink">helicopter carrier</a> which was retired from active service on 7 June 2010. At present the controversial <a href="French_far-right" title="wikilink">French far-right</a> political party <a href="National_Front_(France)" title="wikilink">Front National</a> holds rallies at her statues, reproduces her likeness in party publications, and uses a tricolor flame partly symbolic of her martyrdom as its emblem. This party's opponents sometimes satirize its appropriation of her image.<a href="#fn75" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref75"><sup>75</sup></a> The French civic holiday in her honour is the second Sunday of May.</p>
<p><a href="Traditionalist_Catholic" title="wikilink">Traditionalist Catholics</a>, in France and elsewhere, also use her as a symbol of inspiration, often comparing the 1988 excommunication of Archbishop <a href="Marcel_Lefebvre" title="wikilink">Marcel Lefebvre</a> (founder of the <a href="Society_of_St._Pius_X" title="wikilink">Society of St. Pius X</a> and a dissident against the Vatican II reforms), to her excommunication.</p>
<p><a href="Philippe-Alexandre_Le_Brun_de_Charmettes" title="wikilink">Philippe-Alexandre Le Brun de Charmettes</a> is the first historian who wrote Joan of Arc's complete history<a href="#fn76" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref76"><sup>76</sup></a> in 1817, in an attempt to restore her family's reputation from Joan's status as a relapsed heretic. His interest in Joan came at a time when France was still struggling to define its new identity after the <a href="French_revolution" title="wikilink">Revolution</a> and the <a href="Napoleonic_wars" title="wikilink">Napoleonic wars</a>. The national <em><a href="ethos" class="uri" title="wikilink">ethos</a></em> was in search of non controversial heroes. A staunch supporter of King and country, Joan of Arc was an acceptable symbol to the monarchists. As a patriot and the daughter of commoners, she was seen as one prototype of the low-born volunteers (the <em>soldats de l'an II</em>) who had victoriously fought for revolutionary France in 1802 and as such could be claimed by the Republicans. As a religious martyr, she was also popular in the powerful Catholic community. De Charmette's <em>Orleanide</em>, today largely forgotten, was another attempt to magnify the national <em>ethos</em> as writers like <a href="Virgil" class="uri" title="wikilink">Virgil</a> (the <a href="Aeneid" class="uri" title="wikilink">Aeneid</a>), or <a href="Lu&lt;U+00ED&gt;s_de_Cam&lt;U+00F5&gt;es" title="wikilink">Camoens</a> (the <a href="Lusiad" class="uri" title="wikilink">Lusiad</a>) had done for Rome and Portugal.</p>

<p>Joan of Arc's religious visions have remained an ongoing topic of interest. The consensus among scholars is that her faith was sincere. She identified <a href="Saint_Margaret_the_Virgin" title="wikilink">Saint Margaret</a>, <a href="Catherine_of_Alexandria" title="wikilink">Saint Catherine</a>, and <a href="Michael_(archangel)" title="wikilink">Saint Michael</a> as the source of her <a href="revelation" title="wikilink">revelations</a> although there is some ambiguity as to which of several identically named saints she intended. Some Catholics regard her visions as divine inspiration.</p>
<p>Analysis of her visions is problematic since the main source of information on this topic is the condemnation trial transcript in which she defied customary courtroom procedure about a witness's oath and specifically refused to answer every question about her visions. She complained that a standard witness oath would conflict with an oath she had previously sworn to maintain confidentiality about meetings with her king. It remains unknown to what extent the surviving record may represent the fabrications of corrupt court officials or her own possible fabrications to protect state secrets.<a href="#fn77" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref77"><sup>77</sup></a> Some historians sidestep speculation about the visions by asserting that her belief in her calling is more relevant than questions about the visions' ultimate origin.<ref>In a parenthetical note to a military biography, DeVries asserts:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The visions, or their veracity, are not in themselves important for this study. What is important, in fact what is key to Joan's history as a military leader, is that <em>she</em> (author's emphasis) believed that they came from God,&quot; p. 35.</ref></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Documents from her own era and historians prior to the twentieth century generally assume that she was both healthy and sane.</p>
<p>A number of more recent scholars attempted to explain her visions in psychiatric or neurological terms.

Two experts who analyse a temporal lobe tuberculoma hypothesis in the medical journal <em>Neuropsychobiology</em> express their misgivings this way:</p>

<p>In response to another such theory alleging that she suffered from bovine tuberculosis as a result of drinking <a href="pasteurization" title="wikilink">unpasteurized</a> milk, historian R&lt;U+00E9&gt;gine Pernoud wrote that if drinking unpasteurized milk could produce such potential benefits for the nation, then the French government should stop mandating the pasteurization of milk.<a href="#fn79" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref79"><sup>79</sup></a></p>
<p>The fact that Joan of Arc gain favor in the court of King Charles VII has been suggested as evidence against mental illness hypotheses. The argument suggests that Charles VII would have been able to recognize &quot;madness&quot; because his own father, Charles VI, suffered from it. Charles VI popularly known as &quot;Charles the Mad&quot;, and much of the political and military decline that France had suffered during his reign could be attributed to the power vacuum that his episodes of insanity had produced. The previous king had believed he was made of glass, a delusion no courtier had mistaken for a religious awakening. Fears that King Charles VII would manifest the same insanity may have factored into the attempt to disinherit him at Troyes. This stigma was so persistent that contemporaries of the next generation would attribute to inherited madness the breakdown that England's King <a href="Henry_VI_of_England" title="wikilink">Henry VI</a> was to suffer in 1453: Henry VI was nephew to Charles VII and grandson to Charles VI. Upon her arrival at Chinon the royal counselor Jacques G&lt;U+00E9&gt;lu cautioned,</p>

<p>The court of Charles VII was shrewd and skeptical on the subject of mental health.<a href="#fn80" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref80"><sup>80</sup></a><a href="#fn81" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref81"><sup>81</sup></a></p>
<p>Also potentially relevant is the fact that she displayed none of the objective symptoms that can accompany the mental illnesses which have been suggested, such as Schizophrenia. She remained astute to the end of her life and the rehabilitation trial testimony frequently marvels at her astuteness:</p>

<p>Her subtle replies under interrogation even forced the court to stop holding public sessions.<a href="#fn82" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref82"><sup>82</sup></a></p>
<p>Although mental illness does not necessarily include severe cognitive impairment, nonetheless the various psychiatric conditions which have been specifically suggested to explain Joan's experiences would include certain detrimental symptoms which are among the diagnostic criteria. For example, in the case of Schizophrenia the American Psychiatric Association's &quot;Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders&quot; lists detrimental and noticeable side effects such as disorganized speech, disorganized or catatonic behavior, affective flattening, alogia, and avolition, among other effects.<a href="#fn83" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref83"><sup>83</sup></a> As noted farther above, these symptoms do not appear to have been present in Joan's case.</p>
<p>Some psychiatrists have also urged that a distinction should be made between different types of experiences. Ralph Hoffman, professor of psychology at Yale University, argues that visionary and creative states including <em>&quot;hearing voices&quot;</em> are not necessarily signs of mental illness. He lists Joan of Arc's case as a possible example of what Hoffman describes as an &quot;inspired voice&quot;, without elaborating on the term.<a href="#fn84" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref84"><sup>84</sup></a></p>

<p>In 1867, a jar was found in a Paris pharmacy with the inscription &quot;Remains found under the stake of Joan of Arc, virgin of Orleans&quot;. They consisted of a charred human rib, carbonized wood, a piece of linen and a cat femurÂ &lt;U+2014&gt; explained as the practice of throwing black cats onto the pyre of witches. They are now in the Museum of Art and History in Chinon museum. In 2006, <a href="w:fr:Philippe_Charlier" title="wikilink">Philippe Charlier</a>, a forensic scientist at <a href="w:fr:H&lt;U+00F4&gt;pital_Raymond-Poincar&lt;U+00E9&gt;_(Garches)" title="wikilink">Raymond Poincar&lt;U+00E9&gt; Hospital</a> (<a href="Garches" class="uri" title="wikilink">Garches</a>) was authorized to study the relics. <a href="Radiocarbon_dating" title="wikilink">Carbon-14 tests</a> and <a href="spectrometry" class="uri" title="wikilink">spectrometry</a> were performed, and the results<a href="#fn85" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref85"><sup>85</sup></a> show that the remains come from an <a href="Egypt" title="wikilink">Egyptian</a> <a href="mummy" class="uri" title="wikilink">mummy</a> from the sixth to the third century BC. The charred appearance comes from the embalming substances, not from combustion. Large amounts of pine pollen were also found, consistent with the presence of resin used in mummification and some unburned linen was found to be similar to that used to wrap mummies. The famous perfumers <a href="Guerlain" class="uri" title="wikilink">Guerlain</a> and <a href="Jean_Patou" title="wikilink">Jean Patou</a> said that they could smell vanilla in the remains, also consistent with mummification. Apparently the mummy was part of the ingredients of Medieval <a href="pharmacopoeia" class="uri" title="wikilink">pharmacopoeia</a> and it was relabeled in a time of French nationalism.</p>

<li id="fn1">Her name was written in a variety of ways, particularly prior to the mid-19th century. See Pernoud and Clin, pp. 220&lt;U+2013&gt;221. She reportedly signed her name as &quot;Jehanne&quot; (see <a href="http://www.stjoan-center.com/Album/part47.html">www.stjoan-center.com/Album/, parts 47</a> and <a href="http://www.stjoan-center.com/Album/part49.html">49</a>; it is also noted in Pernoud and Clin).<a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-back">â©</a></li>

<li id="fn5">Modern biographical summaries often assert a birthdate of 6 January for Joan. In fact, however, she could only estimate her own age. All of the rehabilitation-trial witnesses likewise estimated her age even though several of these people were her godmothers and godfathers. The 6 January claim is based on a single source: a letter from Lord Perceval de Boullainvilliers on 21 July 1429 (see Pernoud's <em>Joan of Arc By Herself and Her Witnesses</em>, p. 98: &quot;Boulainvilliers tells of her birth in Domr&lt;U+00E9&gt;my, and it is he who gives us an exact date, which may be the true one, saying that she was born on the night of Epiphany, 6 January&quot;). Boulainvilliers, however, was not from Domr&lt;U+00E9&gt;my. The event was probably not recorded. The practice of <a href="parish_register" title="wikilink">parish registers</a> for non-noble births did not begin until several generations later.<a href="#fnref5" class="footnote-back">â©</a></li>

<li id="fn17">Jacques d'Arc (1380&lt;U+2013&gt;1440) was a farmer in Domremy who held the post of <em>doyen</em> a local tax-collector and organizer of village defenses. He married Isabelle de Vouthon (1387&lt;U+2013&gt;1468), called Rom&lt;U+00E9&gt;e, in 1405. Their other children were Jacquemin, Jean, Pierre and Catherine. Charles VII ennobled Jacques and Isabelle's family on 29 December 1429; the Chamber of Accounts registered the family's designation to nobility on 20 January 1430. The grant permitted the family to change their surname to du Lys.<a href="#fnref17" class="footnote-back">â©</a></li>

<li id="fn28">Histories and fictional works often refer to this man by other names. Some call him count of Dunois in reference to a title he received years after Joan's death. During her lifetime he preferred Bastard of Orl&lt;U+00E9&gt;ans, which his contemporaries understood as an honor because it described him as a first cousin of King Charles VII. That name often confuses modern readers because <em>&quot;bastard&quot;</em> has become a popular insult. <em>&quot;Jean d'Orleans&quot;</em> is less precise but not anachronistic.
