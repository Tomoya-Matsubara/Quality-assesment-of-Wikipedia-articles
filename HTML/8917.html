<p><strong>Ara Raoul Parseghian</strong> (; born May 21, 1923) is a former <a href="American_football" title="wikilink">American football</a> player and coach of <a href="Armenian_American" title="wikilink">Armenian</a> and <a href="French_American" title="wikilink">French</a> descent who guided the <a href="University_of_Notre_Dame" title="wikilink">University of Notre Dame</a> to <a href="NCAA_Division_I_FBS_national_football_championship" title="wikilink">national championships</a> in <a href="1966_Notre_Dame_Fighting_Irish_football_team" title="wikilink">1966</a> and <a href="1973_Notre_Dame_Fighting_Irish_football_team" title="wikilink">1973</a>. He is noted for bringing Notre Dame's football program from years of futility back into a national contender in 1964 and is widely regarded alongside <a href="Knute_Rockne" title="wikilink">Knute Rockne</a>, <a href="Frank_Leahy" title="wikilink">Frank Leahy</a> and <a href="Lou_Holtz" title="wikilink">Lou Holtz</a> as one of the best coaches in Notre Dame history.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>Parseghian grew up in <a href="Akron,_Ohio" title="wikilink">Akron, Ohio</a> and played football starting in his junior year of high school. He enrolled at the <a href="University_of_Akron" title="wikilink">University of Akron</a>, but soon quit to join the <a href="United_States_Navy" title="wikilink">U.S. Navy</a> for two years during <a href="World_War_II" title="wikilink">World War II</a>. After the war, he finished his college career at <a href="Miami_University" title="wikilink">Miami University</a> in <a href="Ohio" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ohio</a>, and went on to play <a href="halfback_(American_football)" title="wikilink">halfback</a> for the <a href="Cleveland_Browns" title="wikilink">Cleveland Browns</a> of the <a href="All-America_Football_Conference" title="wikilink">All-America Football Conference</a> in 1948 and 1949. Cleveland won the league championship both of those years.</p>
<p>His playing career cut short by a hip injury, Parseghian left the Browns and took a job as an assistant coach at Miami. When head coach <a href="Woody_Hayes" title="wikilink">Woody Hayes</a> left in 1951 to coach at <a href="Ohio_State_University" title="wikilink">Ohio State University</a>, Parseghian took over his job. He stayed in that position until 1956, when he was hired as head coach at <a href="Northwestern_University" title="wikilink">Northwestern University</a> in <a href="Illinois" class="uri" title="wikilink">Illinois</a>. In eight seasons there, he amassed a <a href="winning_percentage" title="wikilink">win-loss-tie</a> record of 36&lt;U+2013&gt;35&lt;U+2013&gt;1 and helped turn a perennial loser into a consistent contender in the national polls. Parseghian's success attracted the interest of the <a href="University_of_Notre_Dame" title="wikilink">University of Notre Dame</a>, which had not posted a winning record in five straight seasons. He joined as coach in 1964 and quickly turned the program around, coming close to capturing a national championship in his first year. He proceeded to win two national titles in 11 seasons as coach of the <a href="Notre_Dame_Fighting_Irish_football" title="wikilink">Notre Dame Fighting Irish</a>, a period often referred to as &quot;the Era of Ara&quot;. He never had a losing season at Notre Dame and posted an overall record of 95&lt;U+2013&gt;17&lt;U+2013&gt;4, giving him the third-most wins of any coach in school history after Rockne and Holtz.</p>
<p>Parseghian quit coaching in 1974 and began a broadcasting career calling college football games for <a href="American_Broadcasting_Company" title="wikilink">ABC</a> and <a href="CBS" class="uri" title="wikilink">CBS</a>. He also dedicated himself to medical causes later in life after his daughter was diagnosed with <a href="multiple_sclerosis" title="wikilink">multiple sclerosis</a> and three of his grandchildren died of a rare genetic disease. Parseghian was inducted into the <a href="College_Football_Hall_of_Fame" title="wikilink">College Football Hall of Fame</a> as a coach in 1980. His career coaching record is 170&lt;U+2013&gt;58&lt;U+2013&gt;6.</p>
<h2 id="early-life-and-high-school">Early life and high school</h2>
<p>Parseghian was the youngest of three children born to an <a href="Armenians" title="wikilink">Armenian</a> father and a <a href="French_people" title="wikilink">French</a> mother in <a href="Akron,_Ohio" title="wikilink">Akron, Ohio</a>. His father, Michael, had come to the <a href="United_States" title="wikilink">United States</a> from <a href="Turkey" class="uri" title="wikilink">Turkey</a> in 1915, fleeing the <a href="Armenian_Genocide" title="wikilink">Armenian Genocide</a> during <a href="World_War_I" title="wikilink">World War I</a> and settling in part of the country where there was a large Armenian population. Despite his mother's protectiveness, Parseghian became involved in sports from an early age, and developed a reputation as the toughest kid in his class. He was hired by Akron's Board of Education in the eighth grade to patrol his school's grounds at night to deter vandals.</p>
<p>Parseghian played basketball at the local <a href="YMCA" class="uri" title="wikilink">YMCA</a>, but did not play organized football until his junior year at <a href="South_High_School_(Akron,_Ohio)" title="wikilink">South High School</a> in Akron because his mother would not allow him to participate in contact sports.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> He joined his high school team, coached by Frank &quot;Doc&quot; Wargo, initially without his parents' permission.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="college-and-professional-career">College and professional career</h2>
<p>After graduating in 1942, Parseghian enrolled at the <a href="University_of_Akron" title="wikilink">University of Akron</a>.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> American involvement in <a href="World_War_II" title="wikilink">World War II</a> had intensified after the <a href="Attack_on_Pearl_Harbor" title="wikilink">Attack on Pearl Harbor</a> in 1941, however, and he quit school to join the <a href="United_States_Navy" title="wikilink">U.S. Navy</a>.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> The Navy transferred him for training to <a href="Naval_Station_Great_Lakes" title="wikilink">Naval Station Great Lakes</a> near <a href="Chicago" class="uri" title="wikilink">Chicago</a>, where <a href="Paul_Brown" title="wikilink">Paul Brown</a> was coaching a service football team. Brown was a well-known high school coach in Ohio, having led his <a href="Massillon_Washington_High_School" title="wikilink">Massillon Washington High School</a> teams to a series of state championships. Parseghian was named the team's starting <a href="fullback_(American_football)" title="wikilink">fullback</a> before the 1944 season, but he was sidelined with an ankle injury and did not play in any games as Great Lakes amassed a 9&lt;U+2013&gt;2&lt;U+2013&gt;1 <a href="winning_percentage" title="wikilink">win-loss-tie record</a> and was ranked 17th in the nation in the <a href="AP_Poll" title="wikilink">AP Poll</a>.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> Parseghian later said that despite not playing, watching Brown's methodical and strict coaching methods &lt;U+2013&gt; and the ease with which he commanded players much larger than he was &lt;U+2013&gt; was a &quot;priceless&quot; experience.</p>
<p>After his military service, Parseghian enrolled at <a href="Miami_University" title="wikilink">Miami University</a> in Ohio and played <a href="halfback_(American_football)" title="wikilink">halfback</a> on the school's football team in 1946 and 1947 under coach <a href="Sid_Gillman" title="wikilink">Sid Gillman</a>. As with Brown, Parseghian paid close attention to Gillman, a post-war football pioneer who helped popularize deep downfield passes as the <a href="T_formation" title="wikilink">T formation</a> came into vogue. He was named an All-Ohio halfback and a Little <a href="All-America" title="wikilink">All-American</a> by sportswriters in 1947.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p>Parseghian was selected by the <a href="Pittsburgh_Steelers" title="wikilink">Pittsburgh Steelers</a> of the <a href="National_Football_League" title="wikilink">National Football League</a> in the 13th round of the <a href="1947_NFL_Draft" title="wikilink">1947 draft</a>.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> He was also selected by the <a href="Cleveland_Browns" title="wikilink">Cleveland Browns</a> of the rival <a href="All-America_Football_Conference" title="wikilink">All-America Football Conference</a> (AAFC), a team coached by Paul Brown, his old Great Lakes coach.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> Parseghian left Miami with six <a href="Course_credit" title="wikilink">semester credit hours</a> remaining and signed with the Browns.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<p>Parseghian played halfback and <a href="defensive_back" title="wikilink">defensive back</a> for the Browns starting in 1948. While he only started one game that season, he was part of a potent offensive backfield that featured <a href="quarterback" class="uri" title="wikilink">quarterback</a> <a href="Otto_Graham" title="wikilink">Otto Graham</a> and fullback <a href="Marion_Motley" title="wikilink">Marion Motley</a>. The Browns won all of their games and a third straight AAFC championship in 1948. Parseghian suffered a serious injury to his hip in the second game of the 1949 season against the <a href="Baltimore_Colts_(AAFC)" title="wikilink">Baltimore Colts</a>, however, ending his playing career.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> He stayed with the Browns for the rest of the season, and the team went on to win another AAFC championship. With the Browns he had 44 carries for 166 yards, three receptions for 33 yards, scored two touchdowns, and intercepted one pass.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>

<h3 id="miami-university">Miami University</h3>
<p>While his injury and the end of his professional career were a source of frustration, Parseghian soon got the chance to try coaching instead. <a href="Woody_Hayes" title="wikilink">Woody Hayes</a>, the head coach back at Miami, contacted him about a job as coach of the freshman team. He was recommended for the position by athletic director <a href="John_Brickels" title="wikilink">John Brickels</a>, who had been an assistant coach with the Browns in 1948. Parseghian led the freshmen to a 4&lt;U+2013&gt;0 record in the 1950 season, and was chosen the following year as Hayes's successor when Hayes departed to become head coach at <a href="Ohio_State_University" title="wikilink">Ohio State University</a>.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<p>Parseghian's teams at Miami consistently did well in the <a href="Mid-American_Conference" title="wikilink">Mid-American Conference</a>, posting a 7&lt;U+2013&gt;3 record in 1951 and improving to 8&lt;U+2013&gt;1 the following year.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> Miami's <a href="Miami_RedHawks_football" title="wikilink">RedHawks</a> were conference champions in 1954 and in 1955, when they went undefeated.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a><a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a><a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> Parseghian's success, which included two wins over larger <a href="Big_Ten_Conference" title="wikilink">Big Ten Conference</a> schools, raised his profile nationally as a head coaching prospect.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a><a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> In late 1955, he was hired to coach at <a href="Northwestern_University" title="wikilink">Northwestern University</a> in <a href="Evanston,_Illinois" title="wikilink">Evanston, Illinois</a>, one of the Big Ten schools Miami had beaten.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> Parseghian compiled a 39&lt;U+2013&gt;6&lt;U+2013&gt;1 record in five seasons at Miami.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="northwestern">Northwestern</h3>
<p>When Parseghian arrived at Northwestern, its football program was in transition. <a href="Bob_Voigts" title="wikilink">Bob Voigts</a> had quit as head coach in February 1955, leaving his assistant <a href="Lou_Saban" title="wikilink">Lou Saban</a> to guide the team.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> Under Saban, a former Browns teammate of Parseghian's, Northwestern finished at 0&lt;U+2013&gt;8&lt;U+2013&gt;1, the worst-ever record in its history at the time.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a><a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a><a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> Ted Payseur, the school's athletic director, resigned after the season under pressure from alumni and was replaced by <a href="Stu_Holcomb" title="wikilink">Stu Holcomb</a>.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> One of Holcomb's first moves was to fire Saban and replace him with Parseghian.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a></p>

<p>Parseghian was the 20th head coach of the <a href="Northwestern_Wildcats_football" title="wikilink">Northwestern Wildcats football</a> team, and was the youngest coach in the Big Ten when he took the job at 32 years old.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> His Northwestern career began in 1956 with just one win in his first six games.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> The Wildcats put together three wins at the end of the season, however, and finished with a 4&lt;U+2013&gt;4&lt;U+2013&gt;1 record.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> Northwestern proceeded to lose all nine of its games in the 1957 season.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> The string of losses was a low point for Parseghian, although many of the games were close, and the team improved the following year. Northwestern finished the 1958 season with a 5&lt;U+2013&gt;4 record that included victories over conference rivals <a href="Michigan_Wolverines_football" title="wikilink">Michigan</a> and <a href="Ohio_State_Buckeyes_football" title="wikilink">Ohio State</a>.</p>
<p>Northwestern began the 1959 season in the top ten in the <a href="AP_Poll" title="wikilink">AP Poll</a>, and began with a 45&lt;U+2013&gt;13 win over <a href="Oklahoma_Sooners_football" title="wikilink">Oklahoma</a>, then the top-ranked team in the country. It was the first of a string of victories that propelled Northwestern to the number-two spot in the AP Poll. Led by <a href="quarterback" class="uri" title="wikilink">quarterback</a> John Talley and star halfback <a href="Ron_Burton" title="wikilink">Ron Burton</a>, the team beat Michigan again and won a match-up in October against <a href="Notre_Dame_Fighting_Irish_football" title="wikilink">Notre Dame</a>, a school Northwestern had not played since 1948. Three straight losses at the end of the season ended the team's run at the conference championship, however.</p>
<p>The following four seasons brought a mix of success and challenges. Parseghian's best year at Northwestern was in 1962, when the team finished at 7&lt;U+2013&gt;2.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> Parseghian was a shrewd recruiter, using Northwestern's small budget to find versatile players overlooked by the bigger rival programs. In 1962, he put his faith in sophomore quarterback <a href="Tom_Myers_(quarterback)" title="wikilink">Tom Myers</a> to guide the team.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> Myers, aided by a big offensive line and by star receiver <a href="Paul_Flatley" title="wikilink">Paul Flatley</a>, led a passing attack that helped Northwestern to the top of the AP Poll in the middle of the season following wins against Ohio State and Notre Dame. Parseghian called the close win against Hayes and Ohio State &quot;one of Northwestern's greatest victories&quot;. The following week's Notre Dame game drew a 55,752 people, which remained the largest crowd ever to see a home game at Northwestern as of 2005. Despite those wins, late-season losses to <a href="Michigan_State_Spartans_football" title="wikilink">Michigan State</a> and <a href="Wisconsin_Badgers_football" title="wikilink">Wisconsin</a> cost the team a chance at the Big Ten championship.</p>
<p>At Northwestern, Parseghian developed a reputation as an affable, down-to-earth coach. While he took his job seriously, he cultivated an informal rapport with players, who called him &quot;Ara&quot; rather than &quot;coach&quot; or &quot;Mr. Parseghian&quot;.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> Given his closeness in age to many of the players, he &quot;empathizes with us well&quot;, Northwestern tackle <a href="Andy_Cvercko" title="wikilink">Andy Cvercko</a> said in 1959.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> Parseghian occasionally joined in practices with the players and organized games of touch football.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> He had other quirks, like lowering the intensity of practices as game day approached to let the players &quot;build up psychologically&quot;, something he learned from Paul Brown.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a></p>
<p>Parseghian remained at Northwestern for eight seasons, until 1963. His career coaching record there was 36&lt;U+2013&gt;35&lt;U+2013&gt;1.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> This ranks him third at Northwestern in total wins and ninth at Northwestern in winning percentage.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> Parseghian's teams beat Notre Dame four straight times after their annual series was renewed in 1959 following a decade-long hiatus.</p>
<p>Toward the end of his tenure at Northwestern, Parseghian grew frustrated by the school's limited financial resources, curbs on football scholarships and academic standards for athletes that were more stringent than at other Big Ten schools. He also clashed with Holcomb, the athletic director, who told him in 1963 that his contract would not be renewed after that season despite coaching the team to within two wins of a national championship the previous year. &quot;I took them to the top of the polls in 1962, and that was not good enough for Northwestern&quot;, Parseghian said many years later.</p>
<h3 id="notre-dame">Notre Dame</h3>
<p>As the end of his Northwestern career approached in November 1963, Parseghian called Father Edmund Joyce, the vice president and chairman of the athletics board at Notre Dame, a <a href="Catholic_Church" title="wikilink">Catholic</a> university near <a href="South_Bend,_Indiana" title="wikilink">South Bend, Indiana</a>. He asked whether <a href="Hugh_Devore" title="wikilink">Hugh Devore</a>, who was then interim head football coach, was going to be given the job on a longer-term basis. When Joyce said the university was searching for a new coach, Parseghian expressed interest in the job. Joyce did not immediately seem warm to the idea, however, and Parseghian explored an offer to coach at the <a href="University_of_Miami" title="wikilink">University of Miami</a>, where his old friend <a href="Andy_Gustafson" title="wikilink">Andy Gustafson</a> had been promoted from head coach to athletic director. Notre Dame was also considering <a href="Dan_Devine" title="wikilink">Dan Devine</a> for its coaching job, but ultimately offered it to Parseghian. Parseghian waffled at first, recalling his father's dislike of Catholics who had played a role in the <a href="Armenian_deportations" title="wikilink">Armenian deportations</a>, but accepted in December and was given a salary of about $20,000 a year ($ today).</p>
<p>Parseghian's candidacy for the head coaching job at Notre Dame was unusual because he was not a Notre Dame graduate, as every head coach since <a href="Knute_Rockne" title="wikilink">Knute Rockne</a> had been.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> Parseghian was also an Armenian <a href="Presbyterianism" title="wikilink">Presbyterian</a>, making him the first non-Catholic coach since Rockne, who converted in 1925.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> Joyce made it clear before his hiring that he did not care about Parseghian's religion, but simply wanted someone who could lead the football team to success.</p>
<p>As had been the case at Northwestern, Notre Dame's football program was in a state of flux when Parseghian arrived. While Notre Dame built a proud history under Rockne and <a href="Frank_Leahy" title="wikilink">Frank Leahy</a>, its two most successful coaches, the late 1950s and early 1960s had been a disaster. The team had finished 5&lt;U+2013&gt;5 in 1962 under <a href="Joe_Kuharich" title="wikilink">Joe Kuharich</a>, who lost the confidence of his players and Notre Dame's administrators during his four years as coach. Kuharich's surprise departure at the end of that season to become supervisor of officials in the <a href="National_Football_League" title="wikilink">National Football League</a>, a position created by his friend and NFL commissioner <a href="Pete_Rozelle" title="wikilink">Pete Rozelle</a>, left the program in disarray. Devore, a long-time Notre Dame employee who had played for Rockne and coached under Leahy, was brought in to lead the team on an interim basis in 1963. Notre Dame managed only a 2&lt;U+2013&gt;7 finish that year.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a></p>
<h4 id="turnaround-and-the-1964-season">Turnaround and the 1964 season</h4>
<p>Parseghian quickly turned things around in 1964, reestablishing a sense of confidence and team spirit that had been lost under Kuharich and Devore. Practices were carefully planned and organized with the help of a coaching staff that consisted of three assistants from Northwestern and four former Notre Dame players. Parseghian listened to players' concerns about the program and addressed them. He updated the team's offense by favoring passing and bringing in smaller and quicker players. A rule change allowing unlimited substitutions starting in 1964 helped make this strategy successful; fast-running receivers could now be taken out of the game and rested as others replaced them.</p>
<p>Parseghian also recognized talent in <a href="quarterback" class="uri" title="wikilink">quarterback</a> <a href="John_Huarte" title="wikilink">John Huarte</a> and <a href="End_(American_football)" title="wikilink">end</a> <a href="Jack_Snow_(American_football)" title="wikilink">Jack Snow</a>, who had been used only sparingly for two seasons by previous coaches. Huarte could throw far and accurately but was soft-spoken, a trait Parseghian and his staff helped change. Snow was large for a receiver of his era, but Parseghian thought his athleticism and sure hands would make him a good wideout. Still, expectations were muted for the 1964 season: Parseghian told his coaches that the team would have a 6&lt;U+2013&gt;4 record if they were lucky. <em><a href="Sports_Illustrated" title="wikilink">Sports Illustrated</a></em> predicted a 5&lt;U+2013&gt;5 record at best, and the team did not rank among the top 20 programs in the country in the pre-season AP Poll.</p>
<p>Notre Dame nonetheless opened the season with a 31&lt;U+2013&gt;7 victory over the heavily favored Wisconsin, a game in which Huarte threw for more yards than the team's leading passer had over the entire 1963 season. Notre Dame players carried Parseghian off the field after the win, which vaulted the team to ninth place in the polls. A string of victories followed, first against <a href="Purdue_Boilermakers_football" title="wikilink">Purdue</a> and then <a href="Air_Force_Falcons_football" title="wikilink">Air Force</a> and <a href="UCLA_Bruins_football" title="wikilink">UCLA</a>. Notre Dame rose to first place in the national polls following a 40&lt;U+2013&gt;0 win over <a href="Navy_Midshipmen_football" title="wikilink">Navy</a> in October. The team went undefeated until the last game of the year against <a href="USC_Trojans_Football" title="wikilink">USC</a>, who won 20&lt;U+2013&gt;17 in the final minutes on a touchdown pass from <a href="Craig_Fertig" title="wikilink">Craig Fertig</a> to <a href="Rod_Sherman" title="wikilink">Rod Sherman</a>. The loss unseated Notre Dame from the top ranking in the national polls, but the team still won the <a href="MacArthur_Bowl" title="wikilink">MacArthur Trophy</a>, a championship awarded by the <a href="National_Football_Foundation" title="wikilink">National Football Foundation</a>.</p>
<p>Huarte passed for 2,062 yards and set 12 school records in 1964, four of which still stood as of 2009. He also won the <a href="Heisman_Trophy" title="wikilink">Heisman Trophy</a>. Snow led the country in receptions, with 60. Parseghian, meanwhile, won numerous coach of the year awards for engineering the turnaround, including from the <a href="AFCA_Coach_of_the_Year" title="wikilink">American Football Coaches Association</a>, the <a href="Eddie_Robinson_Coach_of_the_Year" title="wikilink">Football Writers Association of America</a>, the Washington Touchdown Club, the Columbus Touchdown Club and <em><a href="College_Football_News" title="wikilink">Football News</a></em>.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a><a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a></p>
<p>Huarte and Snow graduated after the 1964 season, and Notre Dame felt their absence the following year, posting a 7&lt;U+2013&gt;2&lt;U+2013&gt;1 record. While the team did not contend for a national title, <a href="defensive_back" title="wikilink">defensive back</a> <a href="Nick_Rassas" title="wikilink">Nick Rassas</a> led the nation in <a href="punt_(gridiron_football)" title="wikilink">punt</a> returns and came in sixth in <a href="interception" title="wikilink">interceptions</a>; he was named a first-team <a href="All-America" title="wikilink">All-American</a> by sportswriters.</p>

<p>In 1966, Parseghian guided Notre Dame to its first <a href="College_football_national_championships_in_NCAA_Division_I_FBS" title="wikilink">national championship</a> since the Leahy era.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a> Led by quarterback <a href="Terry_Hanratty" title="wikilink">Terry Hanratty</a> and star receiver <a href="Jim_Seymour" title="wikilink">Jim Seymour</a>, the offense was best in the nation in scoring, with an average of 36.2 points per game.<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> The defense was second in the country in points allowed, thanks to strong performances by <a href="linebacker" class="uri" title="wikilink">linebacker</a> <a href="Jim_Lynch" title="wikilink">Jim Lynch</a> and <a href="defensive_end" title="wikilink">defensive end</a> <a href="Alan_Page" title="wikilink">Alan Page</a>.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a></p>
<p>The season began with eight straight victories, propelling Notre Dame to the top of the national polls.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a><a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a> The team then faced Michigan State, which ranked second in the polls and was also undefeated. The contest, one among a number referred to as the &quot;<a href="1966_Notre_Dame_vs._Michigan_State_football_game" title="wikilink">game of the century</a>&quot;, ended in a 10&lt;U+2013&gt;10 tie.<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a> Parseghian was criticized for winding down the clock instead of trying to score despite having the ball in the final seconds of the game.<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a> He defended his strategy by maintaining that several key starters had been knocked out of action early in the game and that he did not want to spoil a courageous comeback from a 10&lt;U+2013&gt;0 deficit by risking a turnover deep in his own territory late in the game.<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a><a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a> When Parseghian's team beat USC 51&lt;U+2013&gt;0 the following week, critics alleged that he ran up the score to impress poll voters who had split the number-one ranking between Notre Dame and Michigan State following the tie. Subsequent to the USC rout, the final wire service polls gave Parseghian's team the national championship.<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a> Nine members of the team were selected as All-Americans, and Parseghian was named <a href="Sporting_News_College_Football_Coach_of_the_Year" title="wikilink">coach of the year</a> by <em><a href="Sporting_News" title="wikilink">Sporting News</a></em>.<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a></p>
<p>Several winning seasons followed, but Notre Dame did not repeat as national champion in the late 1960s.<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a> The team finished with an 8&lt;U+2013&gt;2&lt;U+2013&gt;1 record in 1969 and was invited to play in the postseason <a href="1970_Cotton_Bowl_Classic" title="wikilink">Cotton Bowl</a>.<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a><a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a> The school had a long-standing policy in place forbidding the team from playing <a href="bowl_game" title="wikilink">bowl games</a>, but the university urgently needed funds for minority scholarships and decided to use the proceeds from the bowl to fund them.<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a> Parseghian's team lost the game 21&lt;U+2013&gt;17 to the eventual national champion <a href="1969_Texas_Longhorns_football_team" title="wikilink">Texas Longhorns</a>.<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a></p>

<p>During Parseghian's tenure at Notre Dame, the school's long-dormant <a href="Michigan&lt;U+2013&gt;Notre_Dame_football_rivalry" title="wikilink">football rivalry</a> with <a href="Michigan_Wolverines_football" title="wikilink">Michigan</a> was revived through an agreement signed in 1970. The schools, which had not met since 1943, agreed to restart the series starting in the 1978 season. Notre Dame athletic director <a href="Moose_Krause" title="wikilink">Moose Krause</a> orchestrated the deal with <a href="Don_Canham" title="wikilink">Don Canham</a>, his counterpart at Michigan, but Parseghian's friendship with Wolverine head coach <a href="Bo_Schembechler" title="wikilink">Bo Schembechler</a> also played a role. Parshegian and Schembechler were teammates at <a href="Miami_University" title="wikilink">Miami of Ohio</a> and Schembechler served on Parshegian's staff at Northwestern in 1956 and 1957. Schembechler told Parseghian in 1970 that he was looking forward to facing Notre Dame, but Parseghian replied that he would &quot;never have that opportunity&quot;.</p>
<p>While at Notre Dame, Parseghian did away with all ornamentation on players' uniforms, eliminating shamrocks and shoulder stripes, and switched the team's home jerseys to navy blue.<a href="#fn86" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref86"><sup>86</sup></a> The Irish never wore green jerseys during his tenure.<a href="#fn87" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref87"><sup>87</sup></a> His successful run at Notre Dame is sometimes referred to as the &quot;Era of Ara&quot;.</p>
