<p>In 2001, Brand faced a great amount of people, suggesting that he creates a similar programme for children, which gave birth to <a href="ClassiKid" class="uri" title="wikilink">ClassiKid</a>. Today, ClassiKid is a musical experience that is simultaneously entertaining and educational. Its main purpose is to help develop a child's own sense of self and then build on that individuality to encourage mutual respect and understanding of others and encourage <a href="teamwork" class="uri" title="wikilink">teamwork</a>. Throughohut the programme children are given a guided tour of the history of music with a variety of different classical musical styles and pieces being utilised within the classes to emphasise the lessons being imparted by the musician.<br />
Each year of the programme is based on 7 separate events, varying in size from those for each individual class to those for the whole school. Over 100,000 students have joined the programme so far, and the numbers are expected to get higher in the next few years.</p>
