<p><strong>Imperial War Museum Duxford</strong> (commonly referred to simply as &quot;Duxford&quot;) is a branch of the <a href="Imperial_War_Museum" title="wikilink">Imperial War Museum</a> near the village of <a href="Duxford" class="uri" title="wikilink">Duxford</a> in <a href="Cambridgeshire" class="uri" title="wikilink">Cambridgeshire</a>, England. Britain's largest <a href="aviation_museum" title="wikilink">aviation museum</a>,<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> Duxford houses the museum's large exhibits, including nearly 200 <a href="aircraft" class="uri" title="wikilink">aircraft</a>, military vehicles, artillery and minor naval vessels in seven main exhibitions buildings.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> The site also provides storage space for the museum's <a href="Imperial_War_Museum#Collections" title="wikilink">other collections</a> of material such as film, photographs, documents, books and artefacts. The site accommodates a number of <a href="British_Army" title="wikilink">British Army</a> regimental museums, including those of the <a href="Parachute_Regiment_(United_Kingdom)" title="wikilink">Parachute Regiment</a> (named <em><a href="Parachute_Regiment_and_Airborne_Forces_Museum" title="wikilink">Airborne Assault</a></em>) and the <a href="Royal_Anglian_Regiment" title="wikilink">Royal Anglian Regiment</a>.</p>
<p>Based on the historic <a href="Duxford_Aerodrome" title="wikilink">Duxford Aerodrome</a>, the site was originally operated by the <a href="Royal_Air_Force" title="wikilink">Royal Air Force</a> (RAF) during the <a href="First_World_War" title="wikilink">First World War</a>. During the <a href="Second_World_War" title="wikilink">Second World War</a> Duxford played a prominent role during the <a href="Battle_of_Britain" title="wikilink">Battle of Britain</a> and was later used by <a href="United_States_Army_Air_Forces" title="wikilink">United States Army Air Forces</a> fighter units in support of the <a href="Strategic_bombing_during_World_War_II#US_bombing_in_Europe" title="wikilink">daylight bombing</a> of Germany. Duxford remained an active RAF airfield until 1961. After the <a href="Ministry_of_Defence_(United_Kingdom)" title="wikilink">Ministry of Defence</a> declared the site surplus to requirements in 1969 the Imperial War Museum received permission to use part of the site for storage. The entirety of the site was transferred to the museum in February 1976.</p>
<p>In keeping with the site's history many of Duxford's original buildings, such as <a href="hangar" title="wikilink">hangars</a> used during the Battle of Britain, are still in use. Many of these buildings are of particular architectural or historic significance and over thirty have <a href="listed_building" title="wikilink">listed building</a> status,<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> Duxford &quot;retain[ing] the best-preserved technical fabric remaining from [a historic airfield] up to November 1918&quot; and being &quot;remarkably well-preserved&quot;.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> The site also features a number of purpose-built exhibition buildings, such as the <a href="Stirling_Prize" title="wikilink">Stirling Prize</a>-winning American Air Museum, designed by <a href="Norman_Foster_(architect)" title="wikilink">Sir Norman Foster</a>. The site remains an active airfield and is used by a number of civilian flying companies, and hosts regular <a href="air_show" title="wikilink">air shows</a>. The site is operated in partnership with <a href="Cambridgeshire_County_Council" title="wikilink">Cambridgeshire County Council</a> and the Duxford Aviation Society, a charity formed in 1975 to preserve <a href="civil_aircraft" title="wikilink">civil aircraft</a> and promote appreciation of British civil aviation history.</p>
<h2 id="museum-history">Museum history</h2>

<p>The Imperial War Museum originated during the First World War in 1917 as the National War Museum committee, formed by the British government to record the war effort and sacrifice of Britain and <a href="British_Empire" title="wikilink">her Empire</a>. The museum opened in 1920, by which point it had been renamed the <em>Imperial</em> War Museum.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> With the outbreak of the <a href="Second_World_War" title="wikilink">Second World War</a>, the museum's terms of reference were enlarged to include the conflict.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> The museum's terms of reference was broadened again in 1953 to include all modern conflicts in which British or <a href="Commonwealth_of_Nations" title="wikilink">Commonwealth</a> forces were engaged.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> The effect of these expansions of remit was to cause the museum's collections to expand enormously, to the point that many parts of the collection, especially those of aircraft, vehicles and artillery, could not be effectively stored or exhibited. Although the museum's south London home (a nineteenth century building in <a href="Southwark" class="uri" title="wikilink">Southwark</a> which was previously the <a href="Bethlem_Royal_Hospital" title="wikilink">Bethlem Royal Hospital</a>) had been extended in 1966, by the end of the decade the museum was seeking additional space.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p>RAF Duxford, a <a href="Royal_Air_Force" title="wikilink">Royal Air Force</a> fighter station had been declared surplus to requirements by the <a href="Ministry_of_Defence_(United_Kingdom)" title="wikilink">Ministry of Defence</a> in 1969, and the museum duly requested permission to use part of one of the airfield's hangars as temporary storage. Duxford featured three double bay hangars of First World War vintage, which together provided over 9000 m<sup>2</sup> of space. Within two years, ten of the museum's aircraft had been brought to Duxford, and were being restored by volunteers of the East Anglia Aviation Society. While the museum's own aircraft were not restored to flying condition, by cooperating with private groups the museum was able to mount its first airshow in 1973. Further air shows followed, with a display in June 1976 attracting an audience of 45,000 people. The runway was bought by <a href="Cambridgeshire_County_Council" title="wikilink">Cambridgeshire County Council</a> in 1977. The success of these shows provided a valuable source of revenue, and complemented the efforts of volunteers, so that the museum applied for the permanent transfer of the entire site to its use. Permission was received in February 1976 and Duxford became the first outstation of the Imperial War Museum. Initially open from March&lt;U+2013&gt;October, Duxford received 167,000 visitors in the 1977 season, and 340,000 in 1978. Two million visitors had been received by 1982<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> and Duxford welcomed its ten millionth visitor in August 2005.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>

From 1925 Duxford became a fighter airfield, a role it was to retain until the end of its operational life, and in August 1938 the Duxford-based <a href="No.19_Squadron_RAF" title="wikilink">No.19 Squadron RAF</a> became the first to operate the <a href="Supermarine_Spitfire" title="wikilink">Supermarine Spitfire</a>.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a><a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a><a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<p>With the outbreak of war in September 1939 Duxford was home to three RAF squadrons engaged on coastal patrol duties. From July 1940, Duxford saw considerable action during the Battle of Britain as a sector station of <a href="RAF_Fighter_Command" title="wikilink">RAF Fighter Command</a>'s <a href="No._12_Group_RAF" title="wikilink">No. 12 Group</a>. In the middle years of the war Duxford was home to a number of specialist units, such as the tacticians and engineers of the <a href="Air_Fighting_Development_Unit" title="wikilink">Air Fighting Development Unit</a>.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> In April 1942 the first <a href="Hawker_Typhoon" title="wikilink">Typhoon</a> Wing was formed at Duxford. Notable among the pilots of the Wing was Group Captain <a href="John_Grandy" title="wikilink">John Grandy</a> who would later rise to be <a href="Chief_of_the_Air_Staff_(United_Kingdom)" title="wikilink">Chief of the Air Staff</a> and also served as Chairman of the Trustees of the Imperial War Museum from 1978 to 1989.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>

The Group reequipped with <a href="P-51_Mustang" title="wikilink">P-51 Mustangs</a> in December 1944 and until the end of the war in Europe the Group remained at Duxford carrying out bomber escort and fighter sweeps, ground strafing and ground attack missions.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
<p>Duxford was officially returned to the RAF on 1 December 1945. It remained a fighter station but by 1958 changing defence priorities saw the RAF's fighter force move to more northerly bases. Duxford's last operational flight was made in July 1961. No longer operational, the site gradually became increasingly derelict and overgrown. In 1968 the American film studio <a href="United_Artists" title="wikilink">United Artists</a> obtained permission to use the site for the filming of <em><a href="Battle_of_Britain_(film)" title="wikilink">Battle of Britain</a></em>. During the shoot a single bay hangar, which had been built during the First World War, was demolished to simulate an air raid.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> After the <a href="Ministry_of_Defence_(United_Kingdom)" title="wikilink">Ministry of Defence</a> announced its intention to dispose of Duxford plans were drawn up for various developments including two <a href="Young_Offenders_Institute" title="wikilink">Young Offenders Institutes</a> but were not implemented.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> {{-}}</p>

<p>Duxford is operated in partnership between the Imperial War Museum, Cambridgeshire County Council and the Duxford Aviation Society. The Society is a <a href="Registered_charity#Charity_registration" title="wikilink">registered charity</a> (No. 285809) and states two objectives; to educate the public by collecting and exhibiting historic aircraft, military vehicles and boats, and to support the Imperial War Museum.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a></p>
<p>The Society was formed in 1975 from a divergence of members of the East Anglian Aviation Society,<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> which now operates the Bassingbourn Tower Museum at the former <a href="RAF_Bassingbourn" title="wikilink">RAF Bassingbourn</a>.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a></p>
<p>Duxford Aviation Society preserves and maintains the Civil Aviation Collection. Especially notable aircraft in the collection include a <a href="de_Havilland_Comet" title="wikilink">de Havilland Comet</a> which made the first eastbound jet-powered trans-Atlantic passenger flight on 4 October 1958, and <a href="Concorde" class="uri" title="wikilink">Concorde</a> G-AXDN 101, a pre-production aircraft which achieved the highest speed of any Concorde, making a westwards trans-Atlantic flight in two hours, 56 minutes.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a></p>
<p>In support of the Museum's goals, the DAS Military Vehicle Wing provides one of the world's leading teams of military vehicle restoration engineers<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> The Wing (or it's volunteers) own a number of the vehicles located at Duxford, and provide restoration services for vehicles within the museum's collection. The team also operate vehicles for demonstrations during the year. The wing's works have been featured in the Discovery Channel's <a href="Tank_Overhaul" title="wikilink">Tank Overhaul</a> programme, <a href="James_May&#39;s_20th_Century" title="wikilink">James May's 20th Century</a>,<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> and wide varety of magazines and other media.</p>
<p>Other elements of the society provide or support a range of functions at the Duxford site, including canteen, aircraft conservation, learning and interpretative activities and administrative tasks. An affiliated group, the Duxford Radio Society, collects, preserves, exhibits, and demonstrates historic military electronic equipment. This is housed in Buildings 177 and 178, close to the Gibraltar Gun.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a></p>
<p>Since January 1999, the Society have operated the Friends of Duxford membership scheme with the Museum.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a><a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a></p>

In October 2008, an agreement was reached between the council and the Imperial War Museum, under which the runways and  of surrounding grassland would be sold to the museum for approximately &lt;U+00A3&gt;1.6 million.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a></p>
<p>Since 1973, Duxford has held regular air shows. Duxford is the home of a number of private aviation companies, such as Classic Wings,<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> The Fighter Collection,<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> the Old Flying Machine Company<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> and The Aircraft Restoration Company.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> Between them these companies provide pleasure flights, historic aircraft for film or television work, and aircraft restoration services. Perhaps the most notable privately owned and operated aircraft based at Duxford is B-17 Preservation Ltd's <em><a href="Sally_B" title="wikilink">Sally B</a></em>, the only airworthy <a href="B-17_Flying_Fortress" title="wikilink">B-17 Flying Fortress</a> in Europe.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a></p>
<p>Major air shows held regularly include the Duxford Air Show, the <a href="Flying_Legends" title="wikilink">Flying Legends</a> show (organised by The Fighter Collection), and American Air Day, which is held in conjunction with units of the <a href="Third_Air_Force" title="wikilink">Third Air Force</a> (part of the <a href="United_States_Air_Forces_in_Europe" title="wikilink">United States Air Forces in Europe</a>), based at nearby <a href="RAF_Lakenheath" title="wikilink">RAF Lakenheath</a> and <a href="RAF_Mildenhall" title="wikilink">RAF Mildenhall</a>.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> The Duxford Air Show usually exhibits a wide range of aircraft, from vintage warbirds to contemporary jet aircraft, along with aerobatic flying by groups such as the <a href="Red_Arrows" title="wikilink">Red Arrows</a>.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> while the Flying Legends show focuses on historic aircraft, especially those of the Second World War.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> In 2008 it was reported that these displays generate up to &lt;U+00A3&gt;1.8 million, while the loss of up to &lt;U+00A3&gt;100,000 due to adverse weather is also budgeted for. The policing bill, necessary to manage the resulting road traffic, was reported as some &lt;U+00A3&gt;8,000.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> Recent major events have included the Battle of Britain 70th Anniversary airshow, held on 4&lt;U+2013&gt;5 September 2010. The show was attended by more than 40,000 people,<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> and featured formation displays by four <a href="Hawker_Hurricane" title="wikilink">Hawker Hurricanes</a> and sixteen <a href="Spitfire" title="wikilink">Spitfires</a>.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a></p>
<p>As an active civil airfield, operations at Duxford are regulated by the <a href="Civil_Aviation_Authority_(United_Kingdom)" title="wikilink">Civil Aviation Authority</a> (CAA). In 2002 a privately operated <a href="Aero_L-39_Albatros" title="wikilink">Aero L-39 Albatros</a> suffered a braking failure on landing, overran the runway and came to rest on the M11 motorway, a student pilot being killed after ejecting at ground level. An <a href="Air_Accidents_Investigation_Branch" title="wikilink">Air Accidents Investigation Branch</a> inquiry recommended a review of arrangements for aircraft taking off or landing towards the M11. As a result, the CAA and Duxford agreed to a reduction in the runway's 1500 m declared length, from 1350 m to 1200 m, in order to provide a greater margin of error.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a><a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a></p>
<p>As a licensed airfield Duxford has its own Fire Service,(currently five vehicles, and 16 fire fighters / officers) which operates as part of the Airfield &amp; Security department, the fire service was originally operated by voluntary crews who were part of Duxford Aviation Society, with the training officers coming from Stansted and other local airports, for the last few years it has been a wholetime operation.</p>

Visible on the right is the large AirSpace exhibition hall, Hangars 2, 3, 4 and 5, the American Air Museum and the eastern end of the runway." /> When originally planned in 1917, Duxford aerodrome was to occupy a  site divided by what is now the <a href="A505_road" title="wikilink">A505 road</a> which runs north-east from <a href="Royston,_Hertfordshire" title="wikilink">Royston</a> to <a href="Newmarket,_Suffolk" title="wikilink">Newmarket</a>. The area north of the road would be occupied by accommodation and administrative buildings with the airfield, hangars and technical buildings on the south side. Still divided by the A505, the museum's site is now bounded to the east by the <a href="M11_motorway" title="wikilink">M11 motorway</a>, which meets the A505 adjacent to the museum site at Junction 10. The construction of the M11 in 1977 forced the shortening of the runway by 300 m. In its role as a museum, the north side of the site is occupied by the Imperial War Museum's stored collections and is not generally open to the public, while the south side is occupied by various hangars and other historic buildings, purpose-built structures, and by two runways.</p>
<p>The south side visitor entrance, which now houses a shop and visitor facilities, was previously the airfield's armoury.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> The various buildings are arranged roughly parallel to the A505; AirSpace is furthest east, with Hangars 2, 3, 4 and 5 running westwards, followed by the American Air Museum and the Land Warfare Hall. The museum site is approximately 1800 m from one end to the other, and a visitor bus operates during opening hours.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a><a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a></p>
