<p><strong>Belfast</strong> ( or ; )<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> is the administrative capital and largest city of <a href="Northern_Ireland" title="wikilink">Northern Ireland</a>. Most of Belfast is in <a href="County_Antrim" title="wikilink">County Antrim</a>, but parts of East and South Belfast are in <a href="County_Down" title="wikilink">County Down</a>. It is on the <a href="flood_plain" title="wikilink">flood plain</a> of the <a href="River_Lagan" title="wikilink">River Lagan</a>.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>By population, Belfast is one of the largest cities in the United Kingdom and the second largest on the <a href="Ireland" title="wikilink">island of Ireland</a>. It is the seat of the <a href="Devolution#United_Kingdom" title="wikilink">devolved</a> <a href="Northern_Ireland_Executive" title="wikilink">government</a> and legislative <a href="Northern_Ireland_Assembly" title="wikilink">Northern Ireland Assembly</a>.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> At the time of the 2011 census, the city of Belfast had a population of 286,000<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> and lies at the heart of the Belfast Urban area, which has a population of 483,418<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> and the <a href="Belfast_Metropolitan_Area" title="wikilink">Belfast Metropolitan Area</a>, which had a population of 579,276 at the 2001 census.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> The <a href="Larger_Urban_Zone" title="wikilink">Larger Urban Zone</a>, as defined by the <a href="European_Union" title="wikilink">European Union</a>, has a total population 641,638. Belfast was granted <a href="City_status_in_the_United_Kingdom#Northern_Ireland" title="wikilink">city status</a> in 1888.</p>
<p>Historically, Belfast has been a centre for the Irish <a href="linen" class="uri" title="wikilink">linen</a> industry (earning the nickname &quot;<a href="Linenopolis" class="uri" title="wikilink">Linenopolis</a>&quot;), tobacco production, rope-making and shipbuilding: the city's main shipbuilders, <a href="Harland_and_Wolff" title="wikilink">Harland and Wolff</a>, which built the well-known <em><a href="RMS_Titanic" title="wikilink">RMS Titanic</a></em>, propelled Belfast on to the global stage in the early 20th century as the biggest and most productive shipyard in the world. Belfast played a key role in the <a href="Industrial_Revolution" title="wikilink">Industrial Revolution</a>, establishing its place as a global industrial centre until the latter half of the 20th century. Industrialisation and the inward migration it brought made Belfast, if briefly, the biggest city in Ireland at the beginning of the 20th century, and the city's industrial and economic success was cited by <a href="Unionism_in_Ireland" title="wikilink">unionist</a> opponents of <a href="Irish_Home_Rule" title="wikilink">Home Rule</a> as a reason why Ireland should shun devolution and later why <a href="Ulster_unionism" title="wikilink">Ulster unionists</a> in particular would fight to resist it.</p>
<p>Today, Belfast remains a centre for industry, as well as the arts, higher education, business, and law, and is the economic engine of Northern Ireland. The city suffered greatly during the period of conflict called &quot;<a href="the_Troubles" title="wikilink">the Troubles</a>&quot;, but latterly has undergone a sustained period of calm, free from the intense political violence of former years, and substantial economic and commercial growth. Additionally, <a href="Belfast_city_centre" title="wikilink">Belfast city centre</a> has undergone considerable expansion and regeneration in recent years, notably around <a href="Victoria_Square_(Belfast)" title="wikilink">Victoria Square</a>.</p>
<p>Belfast is served by two airports: <a href="George_Best_Belfast_City_Airport" title="wikilink">George Best Belfast City Airport</a> in the city, and <a href="Belfast_International_Airport" title="wikilink">Belfast International Airport</a>  west of the city. Belfast is also a major port, with commercial and industrial docks dominating the <a href="Belfast_Lough" title="wikilink">Belfast Lough</a> shoreline, including the famous Harland and Wolff shipyard. Belfast is a constituent city of the <a href="Dublin-Belfast_corridor" title="wikilink">Dublin-Belfast corridor</a>, which has a population of three million, or half the total population of the island of Ireland. Belfast is listed by the <a href="Globalization_and_World_Cities_Research_Network" title="wikilink">Globalization and World Cities Research Network (GaWC)</a> as a <a href="global_city" title="wikilink">global city</a>, with a ranking of 'Gamma'.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="name">Name</h2>
<p>The name <em>Belfast</em> is derived from the Irish <em>B&lt;U+00E9&gt;al Feirsde</em>, which was later spelled <em>B&lt;U+00E9&gt;al Feirste</em>.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> The word <em>b&lt;U+00E9&gt;al</em> means &quot;mouth&quot; or &quot;rivermouth&quot; while <em>feirsde/feirste</em> is the genitive singular of <em>fearsaid</em> and refers to a <a href="shoal" title="wikilink">sandbar</a> or tidal <a href="ford_(crossing)" title="wikilink">ford</a> across a river's mouth.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a><a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> The name would thus translate literally as &quot;(river) mouth of the sandbar&quot; or &quot;(river) mouth of the ford&quot;.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> This sandbar was formed at the confluence of two rivers at what is now Donegall Quay: the <a href="River_Lagan" title="wikilink">Lagan</a>, which flows into Belfast Lough, and its tributary the <a href="River_Farset" title="wikilink">Farset</a>. This area was the hub around which the original settlement developed.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> The Irish name <em>B&lt;U+00E9&gt;al Feirste</em> is shared by a <a href="townland" class="uri" title="wikilink">townland</a> in <a href="County_Mayo" title="wikilink">County Mayo</a>, whose name has been anglicised as <em>Belfarsad</em>.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<p>An alternative interpretation of the name is &quot;mouth of [the river] of the sandbar&quot;, an allusion to the River Farset, which flows into the Lagan where the sandbar was located. This interpretation was favoured by <a href="Edmund_Hogan" title="wikilink">Edmund Hogan</a> and <a href="John_O&#39;Donovan_(scholar)" title="wikilink">John O'Donovan</a>.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> It seems clear, however, that the river itself was also named after the tidal crossing.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
<p>In <a href="Ulster_Scots_dialects" title="wikilink">Ulster Scots</a> the name of the city is <em>Bilfawst</em><a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a><a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> or <em>Bilfaust</em>,<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> although &quot;Belfast&quot; is also used.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a><a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>

<p>The site of Belfast has been occupied since the <a href="Bronze_Age" title="wikilink">Bronze Age</a>. The <a href="Giants_Ring,_Belfast" title="wikilink">Giant's Ring</a>, a 5,000-year-old <a href="henge" class="uri" title="wikilink">henge</a>, is located near the city, and the remains of <a href="Iron_Age" title="wikilink">Iron Age</a> <a href="hill_fort" title="wikilink">hill forts</a> can still be seen in the surrounding hills. Belfast remained a small settlement of little importance during the <a href="High_Middle_Ages" title="wikilink">Middle Ages</a>. <a href="John_de_Courcy" title="wikilink">John de Courcy</a> built a castle on what is now Castle Street in the city centre in the 12th century, but this was on a lesser scale and not as strategically important as <a href="Carrickfergus_Castle" title="wikilink">Carrickfergus Castle</a> to the north, which was built by de Courcy in 1177. The <a href="O&#39;Neill_dynasty" title="wikilink">O'Neill</a> clan had a presence in the area.</p>
<p>In the 14th century, Cloinne Aodha Buidhe, descendants of Aodh Buidhe O'Neill built Grey Castle at Castlereagh, now in the east of the city.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> Conn O'Neill of the Clannaboy O'Neills owned vast lands in the area and was the last inhabitant of Grey Castle, one remaining link being the Conn's Water river flowing through east Belfast.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="growth">Growth</h3>
<p>Belfast became a substantial settlement in the 17th century after being established as a town by <a href="Arthur_Chichester,_1st_Baron_Chichester" title="wikilink">Sir Arthur Chichester</a>,<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> which was initially settled by Protestant English and Scottish migrants at the time of the <a href="Plantation_of_Ulster" title="wikilink">Plantation of Ulster</a>. (Belfast and County Antrim, however, did not form part of this particular Plantation scheme as they were privately colonised.) In 1791, the <a href="Society_of_United_Irishmen" title="wikilink">Society of United Irishmen</a> was founded in Belfast, after <a href="Henry_Joy_McCracken" title="wikilink">Henry Joy McCracken</a> and other prominent Presbyterians from the city invited <a href="Theobald_Wolfe_Tone" title="wikilink">Theobald Wolfe Tone</a> and <a href="Thomas_Russell_(rebel)" title="wikilink">Thomas Russell</a> to a meeting, after having read Tone's &quot;Argument on Behalf of the Catholics of Ireland&quot;.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> Evidence of this period of Belfast's growth can still be seen in the oldest areas of the city, known as the <a href="The_Belfast_Entries" title="wikilink">Entries</a>.</p>
<p>Belfast blossomed as a commercial and industrial centre in the 18th and 19th centuries and became Ireland's pre-eminent industrial city. Industries thrived, including linen, rope-making, tobacco, heavy engineering and shipbuilding, and at the end of the 19th century, Belfast briefly overtook Dublin as the largest city in Ireland. The Harland and Wolff shipyards became one of the largest shipbuilders in the world, employing up to 35,000 workers.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> In 1886 the city suffered intense <a href="1886_Belfast_riots" title="wikilink">riots</a> over the issue of home rule, which had divided the city.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1920&lt;U+2013&gt;22, Belfast became the capital of the new entity of Northern Ireland as the island of Ireland was partitioned. The accompanying conflict (the <a href="Irish_War_of_Independence" title="wikilink">Irish War of Independence</a>) cost up to 500 lives in Belfast, the bloodiest sectarian strife in the city until the Troubles of the late 1960s onwards.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a></p>
<p>Belfast was <a href="Belfast_Blitz" title="wikilink">heavily bombed</a> during <a href="World_War_II" title="wikilink">World War II</a>. In one raid, in 1941, German bombers killed around one thousand people and left tens of thousands homeless. Apart from London, this was the greatest loss of life in a night raid during the <a href="The_Blitz" title="wikilink">Blitz</a>.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a></p>

<p>Belfast has been the capital of Northern Ireland since its establishment in 1921 following the <a href="Government_of_Ireland_Act_1920" title="wikilink">Government of Ireland Act 1920</a>. It had been the scene of various episodes of sectarian conflict between its Catholic and Protestant populations. These opposing groups in this conflict are now often termed <a href="Irish_republicanism" title="wikilink">republican</a> and <a href="Ulster_loyalism" title="wikilink">loyalist</a> respectively, although they are also referred to as '<a href="Irish_nationalism" title="wikilink">nationalist</a>' and '<a href="Unionism_(Ireland)" title="wikilink">unionist</a>'. The most recent example of this conflict was known as the Troubles &lt;U+2013&gt; a civil conflict that raged from around 1969 to 1998.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a></p>
<p>Belfast saw some of the worst of the Troubles in Northern Ireland, particularly in the 1970s, with rival paramilitary groups formed on both sides. Bombing, assassination and street violence formed a backdrop to life throughout the Troubles. The <a href="Provisional_IRA" title="wikilink">Provisional IRA</a> detonated 22 bombs within the confines of Belfast city centre in 1972, on what is known as &quot;<a href="Bloody_Friday_(1972)" title="wikilink">Bloody Friday</a>&quot;, killing nine people. Loyalist paramilitaries including the <a href="Ulster_Volunteer_Force_(1966)" title="wikilink">Ulster Volunteer Force</a> (UVF) and the <a href="Ulster_Defence_Association" title="wikilink">Ulster Defence Association</a> (UDA) claimed that the killings they carried out were in retaliation for the <a href="Provisional_IRA_campaign_1969-1997" title="wikilink">IRA campaign</a>. Most of their victims were Catholics with no links to the Provisional IRA.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> A particularly notorious group, based on the <a href="Shankill_Road" title="wikilink">Shankill Road</a> in the mid-1970s, became known as the <a href="Shankill_Butchers" title="wikilink">Shankill Butchers</a>.</p>
<p>In all, over 1,600 people were killed in political violence in the city between 1969 and 2001.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> Due to the violence, even continuing today, Belfast is often referred to as the &quot;<em>European Capital of Terrorism</em>&quot;.</p>

<p>Belfast City Council is the <a href="Local_government_in_Northern_Ireland" title="wikilink">local council</a> with responsibility for the city. The city's elected officials are the <a href="Lord_Mayor_of_Belfast" title="wikilink">Lord Mayor of Belfast</a>, Deputy Lord Mayor and <a href="High_Sheriff" title="wikilink">High Sheriff</a> who are elected from among 51 <a href="councillors" class="uri" title="wikilink">councillors</a>.

<p>In 1997, <a href="Unionism_in_Ireland" title="wikilink">Unionists</a> lost overall control of Belfast City Council for the first time in its history, with the <a href="Alliance_Party_of_Northern_Ireland" title="wikilink">Alliance Party of Northern Ireland</a> gaining the balance of power between <a href="Irish_nationalism" title="wikilink">Nationalists</a> and Unionists. This position was confirmed in the three subsequent council elections, with mayors from Nationalist Sinn F&lt;U+00E9&gt;in and <a href="Social_Democratic_and_Labour_Party" title="wikilink">Social Democratic and Labour Party</a> (SDLP), and the cross-community Alliance Party regularly elected since. The first nationalist Lord Mayor of Belfast was Alban Maginness of the SDLP, in 1997.</p>
<p>The <a href="Northern_Ireland_local_government_elections,_2011" title="wikilink">last elections</a> to Belfast City Council were held on 5 May 2011, with the City's voters electing fifty-one councillors across <a href="Electoral_wards_of_Belfast" title="wikilink">nine district electoral areas</a>.

<p>The <a href="coat_of_arms" title="wikilink">coat of arms</a> of the city are blazoned as <em>Party per fesse argent and azure, in chief a pile vair and on a canton gules a bell argent, in base a ship with sails set argent on waves of the sea proper</em>. This heraldic language describes a shield that is divided in two horizontally (<em>party per fesse</em>). The top (<em>chief</em>) of the shield is silver (<em>argent</em>), and has a point-down triangle (<em>a pile</em>) with a repeating blue-and-white pattern that represents fur (<em>vair</em>). There is also a red square in the top corner (<em>a canton gules</em>) on which there is a silver bell. It is likely that the bell is an example here of &quot;canting&quot; (or punning) heraldry, representing the first syllable of Belfast. In the lower part of the shield (<em>in base</em>) there is a silver sailing ship shown sailing on waves coloured in the actual colours of the sea (<em>proper</em>).

<p>The city is flanked to the northwest by a series of hills, including <a href="Cavehill" class="uri" title="wikilink">Cavehill</a>. Belfast is located at the western end of Belfast Lough and at the mouth of the River Lagan making it an ideal location for the shipbuilding industry that once made it famous. When the <em><a href="RMS_Titanic" title="wikilink">Titanic</a></em> was built in Belfast in 1911/1912, Harland and Wolff had the largest shipyard in the world.<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a> Belfast is situated on Northern Ireland's eastern <a href="coast" class="uri" title="wikilink">coast</a> at . A consequence of this northern latitude is that it both endures short winter days and enjoys long summer evenings. During the <a href="winter_solstice" title="wikilink">winter solstice</a>, the shortest day of the year, local sunset is before 16:00 while sunrise is around 08:45. This is balanced by the <a href="Solstice" title="wikilink">summer solstice</a> in June, when the sun sets after 22:00 and rises before 05:00.<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1994, a <a href="Lagan_Weir" title="wikilink">weir</a> was built across the river by the <a href="Laganside_Corporation" title="wikilink">Laganside Corporation</a> to raise the average water level so that it would cover the unseemly mud flats which gave Belfast its name<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a> ().<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a> The area of Belfast Local Government District is .<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a></p>
<p>The <a href="River_Farset" title="wikilink">River Farset</a> is also named after this <a href="silt" class="uri" title="wikilink">silt</a> deposit (from the Irish <em>feirste</em> meaning &quot;sand spit&quot;). Originally a more significant river than it is today, the Farset formed a dock on High Street until the mid 19th century. Bank Street in the <a href="Belfast_City_Centre" title="wikilink">city centre</a> referred to the river bank and Bridge Street was named for the site of an early Farset bridge.<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a> Superseded by the River Lagan as the more important river in the city, the Farset now languishes in obscurity, under High Street. There are no less than eleven other minor rivers in and around Belfast, namely the Blackstaff, the Colin, the Connswater, the Cregagh, the Derriaghy, the Forth, the Knock, the Legoniel, the Milewater, the Purdysburn and the Ravernet.<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a></p>
<p>The city is flanked on the north and northwest by a series of hills, including <a href="Divis" title="wikilink">Divis Mountain</a>, <a href="Black_Mountain_(Belfast)" title="wikilink">Black Mountain</a> and Cavehill thought to be the inspiration for <a href="Jonathan_Swift" title="wikilink">Jonathan Swift</a>'s <em><a href="Gulliver&#39;s_Travels" title="wikilink">Gulliver's Travels</a></em>. When Swift was living at Lilliput Cottage near the bottom of the Limestone Road in Belfast, he imagined that the Cavehill resembled the shape of a sleeping giant safeguarding the city.<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a> The shape of the giant's nose, known locally as <em>Napoleon's Nose</em>, is officially called McArt's Fort probably named after Art O'Neill, a 17th-century chieftain who controlled the area at that time.<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a> The <a href="Castlereagh_(borough)" title="wikilink">Castlereagh</a> Hills overlook the city on the southeast.</p>
<h3 id="climate">Climate</h3>
<p>As with the rest of Ireland, Belfast has a <a href="temperate" class="uri" title="wikilink">temperate</a> climate, with a narrow range of temperatures and rainfall throughout the year. The climate of Belfast is significantly milder than some other locations in the world at a similar latitude, due to the warming influence of the Gulf Stream. There are currently 5 weather observing stations in the Belfast area: Helens Bay, Stormont, Newforge, Castlereagh, and Ravenhill Road. Slightly further afield is Aldergrove Airport.<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a> The highest temperature recorded at any official weather station in the Belfast area was  at Shaws Bridge on 12 July 1983.<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a> Belfast also holds the record for Northern Ireland's warmest night time minimum,  at Whitehouse on 14 August 2001.<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a></p>
<p>The city gets significant precipitation (greater than 1mm) on 157 days in an average year with an average annual rainfall of ,<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a> less than areas of northern England or most of <a href="Scotland" class="uri" title="wikilink">Scotland</a>,<a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a> but higher than <a href="Dublin" class="uri" title="wikilink">Dublin</a> or the south-east coast of Ireland.<a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a> As an urban and coastal area, Belfast typically gets snow on fewer than 10 days per year.<a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a> The absolute maximum temperature at the weather station at Stormont is , set during July 1983.<a href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a> In an average year the warmest day will rise to a temperature of <a href="#fn67" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a> with a day of  or above occurring roughly once every two in three years.<a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a> The absolute minimum temperature at Stormont is , during January 1982,<a href="#fn69" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref69"><sup>69</sup></a> although in an average year the coldest night will fall no lower than  with air frost being recorded on just 26 nights.<a href="#fn70" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a> The lowest temperature to occur in recent years was &lt;U+2212&gt;8.8 on 22 December 2010.<a href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a></p>

<p>Belfast expanded very rapidly from being a market town to becoming an industrial city during the course of the 19th century. Because of this, it is less an agglomeration of villages and towns which have expanded into each other, than other comparable cities, such as <a href="Manchester" class="uri" title="wikilink">Manchester</a> or <a href="Birmingham" class="uri" title="wikilink">Birmingham</a>. The city expanded to the natural barrier of the hills that surround it, overwhelming other settlements. Consequently, the arterial roads along which this expansion took place (such as the <a href="Falls_Road,_Belfast" title="wikilink">Falls Road</a> or the <a href="Newtownards_Road" title="wikilink">Newtownards Road</a>) are more significant in defining the districts of the city than nucleated settlements.

<p>When the population of Belfast town began to grow in the 17th century, its economy was built on commerce.<a href="#fn148" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref148"><sup>148</sup></a> It provided a market for the surrounding countryside and the natural inlet of <a href="Belfast_Lough" title="wikilink">Belfast Lough</a> gave the city its own port.

In the mid-17th century, Belfast exported beef, butter, hides, tallow and corn and it imported coal, cloth, wine, brandy, paper, timber and tobacco.<a href="#fn149" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref149"><sup>149</sup></a></p>
<p>Around this time, the linen trade in Northern Ireland blossomed and by the middle of the 18th century, one fifth of all the linen exported from Ireland was shipped from Belfast.<a href="#fn150" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref150"><sup>150</sup></a> The present city however is a product of the <a href="Industrial_Revolution" title="wikilink">Industrial Revolution</a>.<a href="#fn151" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref151"><sup>151</sup></a> It was not until industry transformed the linen and shipbuilding trades that the economy and the population boomed.

<p>The rise of mass-produced and cotton clothing following <a href="World_War_I" title="wikilink">World War I</a> were some of the factors which led to the decline of Belfast's international linen trade.<a href="#fn156" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref156"><sup>156</sup></a> Like many British cities dependent on traditional heavy industry, Belfast suffered serious decline since the 1960s, exacerbated greatly in the 1970s and 1980s by the Troubles.

<p>Like all areas of the island of Ireland outside of the <a href="Gaeltacht" class="uri" title="wikilink">Gaeltacht</a>, the Irish language in Belfast is not that of an unbroken intergenerational transmission.
