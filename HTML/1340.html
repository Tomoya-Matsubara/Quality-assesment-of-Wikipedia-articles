<h2 id="editorial-viewpoints-and-policies">Editorial viewpoints and policies</h2>
<p>Conservapedia has editorial policies designed to prevent what Schlafly sees as structural and ideological problems with Wikipedia and generalized vandalism.</p>
<h3 id="differences-from-wikipedia">Differences from Wikipedia</h3>
<p>Many editorial practices of Conservapedia differ from those of <a href="Wikipedia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Wikipedia</a>. Articles and other content on the site frequently include criticism of Wikipedia as well as criticism of its alleged liberal ideology.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> Launching the online encyclopedia project, Schlafly asserted the need for an alternative to Wikipedia due to editorial philosophy conflicts. The site's &quot;Conservapedia Commandments&quot;<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> differ from Wikipedia's editorial policies, which include following a neutral point of view<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> and avoiding <a href="original_research" title="wikilink">original research</a>.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a><a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> In response to Wikipedia's core policy of neutrality, Schlafly has stated: &quot;It's impossible for an encyclopedia to be neutral. I mean let's take a point of view, let's disclose that point of view to the reader&quot;,<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> and &quot;Wikipedia does not poll the views of its editors and administrators. They make no effort to retain balance. It ends up having all the neutrality of a <a href="lynch_mob" title="wikilink">lynch mob</a>&quot;.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a></p>
<p>In a March 2007 interview with <em><a href="The_Guardian" title="wikilink">The Guardian</a></em>, Schlafly stated, &quot;I've tried editing Wikipedia, and found it and the biased editors who dominate it censor or change facts to suit their views. In one case my factual edits were removed within 60 seconds&lt;U+2014&gt;so editing Wikipedia is no longer a viable approach&quot;.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> On March 7, 2007, Schlafly was interviewed on <a href="BBC_Radio_4" title="wikilink">BBC Radio 4</a>'s flagship morning show, <em><a href="Today_(BBC_Radio_4)" title="wikilink">Today</a></em>, opposite Wikipedia administrator Jim Redmond. Schlafly raised several concerns: that the article on the <a href="Renaissance" class="uri" title="wikilink">Renaissance</a> does not give any credit to Christianity, that Wikipedia articles apparently prefer to use non-American spellings even though most users are American, that the article on <a href="Philippine&lt;U+2013&gt;American_War" title="wikilink">American activities in the Philippines</a> has a distinctly anti-American bias, and that attempts to include pro-Christian or pro-American views are removed very quickly. In response to Schlafly's claim that the Wikipedia policy of allowing both Common Era and Anno Domini notation was anti-Christian bias,<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a><a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a><a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> Redmond argued that Wikipedia attracts contributors worldwide and so must use Common Era notation to be more neutral, since CE notation has only a nominal, not numerical, difference with the AD format. He also cited the Wikipedia policies regarding citation of sources and cooperation with other contributors as basis for allowing any factual information to be added.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="conflict-with-scientific-views">Conflict with scientific views</h3>
<p>Various Conservapedia articles have been challenged from a scientific perspective. Although not all contributors subscribe to a <a href="young_earth_creationist" title="wikilink">young earth creationist</a> point of view - senior administrator Terry Koeckritz stated to the <a href="LA_Times" title="wikilink">LA Times</a> that he does not take the Genesis creation account literally<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a> - sources have attributed the poor science coverage to an overall editorial support of the YEC perspective and an over-reliance on home schooling textbooks.<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a><a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a><a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a> In an analysis in early 2007, science writer <a href="Carl_Zimmer" title="wikilink">Carl Zimmer</a> found evidence that much of what appeared to be inaccurate or inadequate information about science and scientific theory could be traced back to an over-reliance on citations from the works of home-schooling textbook author Jay L. Wile.<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a></ref></p>
<p>Conservapedia's article on <a href="evolution" class="uri" title="wikilink">evolution</a> presents evolution as a <a href="scientific_theory" title="wikilink">scientific theory</a> that lacks support and conflicts with evidence in the fossil record that <a href="Creation_science" title="wikilink">creationists</a> perceive to support creationism.<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a><a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a> The entry also suggests that sometimes the <a href="Bible" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bible</a> has been more scientifically correct than the scientific community.<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a> Schlafly had defended the statement as presenting an alternative to evolution.<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a> An entry on the <a href="Pacific_Northwest_tree_octopus" title="wikilink">&quot;Pacific Northwest Arboreal Octopus&quot;</a> has received particular attention. Schlafly has asserted that the page was intended as a parody of environmentalism.<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a> As of March 4, 2007, the entry has been deleted.<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a> Another claim is that &quot;<a href="Albert_Einstein" title="wikilink">Einstein</a>'s work had nothing to do with the development of the <a href="atomic_bomb" title="wikilink">atomic bomb</a>&quot;, and that Einstein was only a minor contributor to the theory of relativity.<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a><a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a><a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a><a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a> Conservapedia asserts that there is a proven <a href="Abortion_&lt;U+2013&gt;_breast_cancer_hypothesis" title="wikilink">link between abortion and breast cancer</a>,<a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a><a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a> while the <a href="scientific_consensus" title="wikilink">scientific consensus</a> is that the best studies indicate that there is no such association for first-trimester abortion.<a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a><a href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a> On March 19, 2007, the British free newspaper <em><a href="Metro_(Associated_Metro_Limited)" title="wikilink">Metro</a></em> ran the article &quot;Weird, wild wiki on which anything goes&quot;, articulating the dismissal of Conservapedia by the <a href="Royal_Society" title="wikilink">Royal Society</a>, saying &quot;People need to be very careful about where they look for scientific information&quot;.<a href="#fn67" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a> A <em>Los Angeles Times</em> journalist voiced concern that children stumbling on the site may assume Conservapedia's scientific content is accurate.<a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a></p>
<p>Conservapedia has also received criticism for its articles regarding the <a href="theory_of_relativity" title="wikilink">theory of relativity</a>, particularly on their entry titled &quot;Counterexamples to relativity&quot;, an article that lists examples as to why the theory is incorrect. Attention was drawn to the article by a <em><a href="Talking_Points_Memo" title="wikilink">Talking Points Memo</a></em> posting, in which they reported on Conservapedia's entry and stated that Andy Schlafly, Conservapedia's founder, &quot;has found one more liberal plot: the theory of relativity&quot;.<a href="#fn69" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref69"><sup>69</sup></a> <em><a href="New_Scientist" title="wikilink">New Scientist</a></em>, a science magazine, criticized Conservapedia's views on relativity and responded to several of Conservapedia's arguments against it.<a href="#fn70" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a> Against Conservapedia's statements, <em>New Scientist</em> stated that one is unlikely to find a single physicist that would claim that the theory of general relativity is the whole answer to how the universe works, and claimed that the theory of relativity has passed every test that the theory has been put through.<a href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a></p>
<p><a href="University_of_Maryland" title="wikilink">University of Maryland</a> physics professor <a href="Robert_L._Park" title="wikilink">Robert L. Park</a> has also criticized Conservapedia's entry on the theory of relativity, arguing that its criticism of the principle as being &quot;heavily promoted by liberals who like its encouragement of relativism and its tendency to mislead people in how they view the world&quot; confuses a physical theory with a Christian-conservative moral value.<a href="#fn72" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref72"><sup>72</sup></a> In a similar statement, <em>New Scientist</em> stated at the end of their article that:<a href="#fn73" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref73"><sup>73</sup></a></p>

<p>In October 2010, <em><a href="Scientific_American" title="wikilink">Scientific American</a></em> criticized Conservapedia's attitude towards the Theory of Relativity, assigning them a zero score on their 0 to 100 fallacy-versus-fact &quot;Science Index&quot;, describing Conservapedia as &quot;the online encyclopedia run by conservative lawyer Andrew Schlafly, (which) implies that Einstein's theory of relativity is part of a liberal plot.&quot;<a href="#fn74" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref74"><sup>74</sup></a> </p>
<h3 id="political-and-religious-ideology">Political and religious ideology</h3>
<p>Many Conservapedia articles criticize values that its editors associate with &quot;liberal ideology&quot;. Schlafly said in an interview with <a href="National_Public_Radio" title="wikilink">National Public Radio</a> that Wikipedia's article on the history of the <a href="Democratic_Party_(United_States)" title="wikilink">Democratic Party</a> is an &quot;attempt to legitimize the modern Democratic Party by going back to <a href="Thomas_Jefferson" title="wikilink">Thomas Jefferson</a>&quot; and that it is &quot;specious and worth criticizing&quot;.<a href="#fn75" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref75"><sup>75</sup></a> He also has claimed that Wikipedia is &quot;six times more liberal than the American public&quot;, a claim that has been labeled &quot;sensational&quot; by Andrew Chung of the Canadian newspaper the <em><a href="Toronto_Star" title="wikilink">Toronto Star</a></em>.<a href="#fn76" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref76"><sup>76</sup></a></p>
<p>John Cotey of the <em><a href="St._Petersburg_Times" title="wikilink">St. Petersburg Times</a></em> observed that the Conservapedia article about the Democratic Party contained a criticism about the party's alleged support for <a href="same-sex_marriage" title="wikilink">same-sex marriage</a>, and associated the party with the &quot;<a href="homosexual_agenda" title="wikilink">homosexual agenda</a>&quot;.<a href="#fn77" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref77"><sup>77</sup></a> The Conservapedia entries on Secretary of State <a href="Hillary_Clinton" title="wikilink">Hillary Clinton</a> and President <a href="Barack_Obama" title="wikilink">Barack Obama</a> are critical of their respective subjects.<a href="#fn78" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref78"><sup>78</sup></a> During the <a href="United_States_presidential_election,_2008" title="wikilink">2008 presidential campaign</a>, its entry on Obama asserted that he &quot;has no clear personal achievement that cannot be explained as the likely result of <a href="affirmative_action" title="wikilink">affirmative action</a>&quot;. Some Conservapedia editors urged that it be changed or deleted, but Schlafly responded by asserting that the <em><a href="Harvard_Law_Review" title="wikilink">Harvard Law Review</a></em>, the Harvard University legal journal for which Obama was once an editor and president, uses racial quotas and stated: &quot;The statement about affirmative action is accurate and will remain in the entry&quot;.<a href="#fn79" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref79"><sup>79</sup></a> In addition, Hugh Muir of the British newspaper <em>The Guardian</em> mockingly referred to Conservapedia's assertion that Obama has links to radical <a href="Islam" class="uri" title="wikilink">Islam</a> as &quot;dynamite&quot; and an excellent resource for &quot;US rightwingers&quot;.<a href="#fn80" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref80"><sup>80</sup></a> In contrast, the articles about conservative politicians, such as <a href="Republican_Party_(United_States)" title="wikilink">Republican</a> former <a href="President_of_the_United_States" title="wikilink">US president</a> <a href="Ronald_Reagan" title="wikilink">Ronald Reagan</a> and former British <a href="Conservative_Party_(UK)" title="wikilink">Conservative</a> <a href="Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Kingdom" title="wikilink">Prime Minister</a> <a href="Margaret_Thatcher" title="wikilink">Margaret Thatcher</a> have been observed as praising their respective subjects.<a href="#fn81" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref81"><sup>81</sup></a><a href="#fn82" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref82"><sup>82</sup></a> Mark Sabbatini of the <em><a href="Juneau_Empire" title="wikilink">Juneau Empire</a></em> considered the Conservapedia entry on <a href="Sarah_Palin" title="wikilink">Sarah Palin</a>, the Republican vice-presidential candidate for the 2008 US presidential election a &quot;kinder, gentler&quot; and &quot;far shorter and less controversial&quot; reference for one wishing to learn about Palin in contrast with the corresponding Wikipedia entry, which Sabbatini found to be plagued by disputes over inclusion of potentially controversial details about her life.<a href="#fn83" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref83"><sup>83</sup></a></p>
<p>In July 2008, <em><a href="American_Prospect" title="wikilink">American Prospect</a></em> associate editor <a href="Ezra_Klein" title="wikilink">Ezra Klein</a> derided the Conservapedia article on <a href="atheism" class="uri" title="wikilink">atheism</a> in his weekly column: &quot;As Daniel DeGroot notes, you've got to wonder which 'unreasonable' explanations they rejected when formulating that entry&quot;.<a href="#fn84" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref84"><sup>84</sup></a></p>

It prefers that articles about the <a href="United_Kingdom" title="wikilink">United Kingdom</a> use British English, while articles about the <a href="United_States" title="wikilink">United States</a> use American English, to resolve editorial disputes.<a href="#fn88" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref88"><sup>88</sup></a> Initially, Schlafly<a href="#fn89" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref89"><sup>89</sup></a> and other Conservapedia editors<a href="#fn90" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref90"><sup>90</sup></a> considered Wikipedia's policy allowing British English spelling to be anti-American bias.</p>
<p>The &quot;Conservapedia Commandments&quot; also require edits to be &quot;family-friendly, clean, concise, and without gossip or foul language&quot; and that users make most edits on their site quality edits to articles; accounts that engage in what it considers &quot;unproductive activity, such as 90% talk and only 10% quality edits&quot; may be blocked.

Lenski replied again that the relevant data was already in the paper, that the &quot;raw data&quot; were living bacterial samples, which he would willingly share with qualified researchers at properly equipped biology labs, and that he felt insulted by letters and comments on Conservapedia which he saw as brusque and offensive, including claims of outright deceit.<a href="#fn134" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref134"><sup>134</sup></a> The Daily Telegraph later called Lenski's reply &quot;one of the greatest and most comprehensive put-downs in scientific argument&quot;. <a href="#fn135" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref135"><sup>135</sup></a></p>
