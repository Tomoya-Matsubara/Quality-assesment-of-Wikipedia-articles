<a href="DVD-ROM" class="uri" title="wikilink">DVD-ROM</a> (EU) | input = <a href="Game_controller" title="wikilink">Game controller</a> }}  is a 2001 <a href="Action-adventure_game" title="wikilink">action-adventure</a> <a href="video_game" title="wikilink">video game</a> published by <a href="Sony_Computer_Entertainment" title="wikilink">Sony Computer Entertainment</a> and released for the <a href="PlayStation_2" title="wikilink">PlayStation 2</a> video game console. It was designed and directed by <a href="Fumito_Ueda" title="wikilink">Fumito Ueda</a>, who wanted to create a minimalist game around a &quot;boy meets girl&quot; concept. Originally planned for the <a href="PlayStation" class="uri" title="wikilink">PlayStation</a>, <em>Ico</em> took approximately four years to develop. The team employed a &quot;subtracting design&quot; approach to reduce elements of gameplay that interfered with the game's setting and story in order to create a high level of <a href="Immersion_(virtual_reality)" title="wikilink">immersion</a>.</p>
<p>The titular protagonist is a young boy with horns whom his village considers a bad omen. Warriors lock Ico away in an abandoned fortress. During his explorations of the fortress, Ico encounters Yorda, the daughter of the castle's Queen, who plans to use Yorda's body to extend her own lifespan. Ico seeks to escape the castle with Yorda to prevent this fate from occurring, keeping her safe from the shadow-like creatures that attempt to draw her back. Throughout the game, the player controls Ico as he explores the castle, solves puzzles, and assists the less-agile Yorda across obstacles.</p>
<p><em>Ico</em> introduced several design and technical elements, including a story told with minimal dialog, <a href="bloom_(shader_effect)" title="wikilink">bloom lighting</a> and <a href="key_frame" title="wikilink">key frame</a> animation, that have influenced subsequent games. Though not a commercial success, it was critically acclaimed for its art and story elements and received several awards, including &quot;Game of the Year&quot; nominations and three <a href="Game_Developers_Choice_Awards" title="wikilink">Game Developers Choice Awards</a>. <em>Ico</em> is listed on several overall top game lists, and is often considered more a work of art than a video game. The game was reprinted in <a href="Europe" class="uri" title="wikilink">Europe</a> in 2006, in conjunction with the release of <em><a href="Shadow_of_the_Colossus" title="wikilink">Shadow of the Colossus</a></em>, the <a href="spiritual_successor" title="wikilink">spiritual successor</a> to <em>Ico</em>.</p>
<h2 id="plot">Plot</h2>
<p>The game's main protagonist is , a young boy with a pair of horns on his head&lt;U+2014&gt;considered a bad omen by his village. As part of the village's tradition, he is taken by a group of warriors to a castle surrounded by water and locked inside one of the <a href="sarcophagus" title="wikilink">sarcophagi</a> in a crypt.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> Some time after the warriors depart, a tremor runs through the castle, and Ico is able to take advantage of it to escape his confines. As he searches the castle, he comes across , a captive girl who speaks in an unknown language. Ico helps Yorda escape, but finds that she is hunted by shadow-like creatures (the souls of other horned children sacrificed to the fortress) that attempt to drag her body into the portals from which they emerged. Though Ico cannot be harmed by the shadows and is able to drive them away from Yorda, he finds he cannot defeat the enemies with his simple weapons. The pair make their way through the abandoned castle, eventually arriving at the bridge leading to land. As they cross, the Queen, ruler of the fortress and Yorda's mother, appears and tells Yorda that as her daughter she cannot leave the castle.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> Ico and Yorda attempt to flee, but the Queen destroys part of the bridge in their path; although Yorda tries to save him, Ico falls off the bridge and loses consciousness.</p>
<p>Ico awakes in the chambers below the castle, and travels back to the upper levels. During his explorations, he finds a magic sword that is able to dispel the shadow creatures. After discovering that Yorda has been turned to stone by the Queen, he seeks out the Queen in her throne room. The Queen reveals that she is preventing Yorda from leaving so that she may extend her own life, which she had previously done by draining the life of those placed in the sarcophagi. Now, she plans to restart her life anew by taking possession of Yorda's body.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> Ico and the Queen fight, Ico losing both of his horns in the process. Ico is able to slay the Queen with the magic sword, but with her death the castle begins to collapse around him, and he loses consciousness again from falling debris. The Queen's spell on Yorda is broken, and as a shadow creature Yorda carries Ico safely out of the castle and onto a boat, sending him to drift to the nearby shore and choosing not to accompany him. Ico awakes to find the castle in ruins and Yorda, in her human form, washed up beside him.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="gameplay">Gameplay</h2>
<p><img src="Ico_gameplay.jpg" title="fig:Ico (right) calls out to Yorda (left) while she waits on the ruined castle. The game&#39;s graphics feature a &quot;soft lightning&quot; technique that has influenced the graphics of future games." alt="Ico (right) calls out to Yorda (left) while she waits on the ruined castle. The game&#39;s graphics feature a &quot;soft lightning&quot; technique that has influenced the graphics of future games." /> <em>Ico</em> is primarily a <a href="3D_computer_graphics" title="wikilink">three dimensional</a> <a href="platform_game" title="wikilink">platform game</a>. The player controls Ico from a <a href="third-person_perspective" title="wikilink">third-person perspective</a> as he explores the castle and attempts to escape it with Yorda.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> The camera remains at a fixed point in each room or area but tracks Ico or Yorda as they move; the player can also <a href="Panning_(camera)" title="wikilink">pan</a> the view a small degree in other directions to observe more of the surroundings.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> The game includes many elements of platform games; for example, the player must have Ico jump, climb, push and pull objects, and perform other tasks such as solving puzzles, to progress within the castle.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> These actions are complicated by the fact that only Ico is able to carry out these actions; Yorda can only jump short distances and cannot climb over tall barriers. The player must use Ico so that he helps Yorda cross obstacles, such as by lifting her to a higher ledge, or by arranging the environment to allow Yorda to cross a larger gap herself. The player is able to tell Yorda to follow Ico, or to wait at a spot. The player can also have Ico take Yorda's hand and pull her along at a faster pace across the environment.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> Players are unable to progress in the game until they move Yorda to certain doors that only she is able to open.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<p>Escaping the castle is made difficult by shadow creatures sent by the Queen. These creatures attempt to drag Yorda into black vortexes if Ico leaves her for any a length of time, or if she is in certain areas of the castle. Ico can dispel these shadows using a stick or sword and pull Yorda free if she is drawn into a vortex.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> While the shadow creatures cannot harm Ico, the game is over if Yorda becomes fully engulfed by a vortex; the player restarts from a <a href="Saved_game#Saved_states" title="wikilink">save point</a>. The player will also restart from a save point if Ico falls from a large height. Save points in the game are represented by stone benches which Ico and Yorda rest on as the player saves the game.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="development">Development</h2>
<p><img src="Kaido_Kenji_And_Fumito_Ueda.jpg" title="fig:Kenji Kaido and Fumito Ueda, the creative team behind Ico" alt="Kenji Kaido and Fumito Ueda, the creative team behind Ico" /> Lead developer Fumito Ueda came up with the concept for <em>Ico</em> in 1997, envisioning a &quot;boy meets girl&quot; story where the two main characters would hold hands during their adventure, forming a bond between them without communication.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> Ueda's main inspiration for <em>Ico</em> was <a href="Eric_Chahi" title="wikilink">Eric Chahi</a>'s game <em><a href="Another_World_(video_game)" title="wikilink"> Another World</a></em> (<em>Outer World</em> in Japan), which used <a href="Cutaway_(filmmaking)" title="wikilink">cinematic cutscenes</a> and lacked any <a href="head-up_display" title="wikilink">head-up display</a> elements as to play like a movie. It also featured a emotional connection between two characters, despite the use of minimal dialog.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a><a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a><a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> Ueda also cited <em><a href="Lemmings_(video_game)" title="wikilink">Lemmings</a></em>, <em><a href="Flashback_(video_game)" title="wikilink">Flashback</a></em> and the original <em><a href="Prince_of_Persia" title="wikilink">Prince of Persia</a></em> games as influences, specifically regarding animation and gameplay style.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a><a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> With the help an assistant, Ueda created an animation in <a href="Lightwave" class="uri" title="wikilink">Lightwave</a> to get a feel for the final game and to better convey his vision.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> In the three-minute demonstration reel, Yorda had the horns instead of Ico, and flying robotic creatures were seen firing weapons to destroy the castle.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a><a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> Ueda stated that having this movie that represented his vision helped to keep the team on track for the long development process, and he reused this technique for the development of <em><a href="Shadow_of_the_Colossus" title="wikilink">Shadow of the Colossus</a></em>, the team's next effort.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a><a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a></p>
<p>Ueda began working with producer <a href="Kenji_Kaido" title="wikilink">Kenji Kaido</a> in 1998 to develop the idea and bring the game to the <a href="PlayStation" class="uri" title="wikilink">PlayStation</a>.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> <em>Ico</em>{{'}}s design aesthetics were guided by three key notions: to make a game that would be different from others in the genre, feature an aesthetic style that would be consistently artistic, and play out in an imaginary yet realistic setting.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> This was achieved through the use of &quot;subtracting design&quot;; they removed elements from the game which interfered with the game's reality.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> This included removing any form of interface elements, keeping the gameplay focused only on the escape from the castle, and reducing the number of types of enemies in the game to a single foe. An interim design of the game shows Ico and Yorda facing horned warriors similar to those that take Ico to the castle. The game originally focused on Ico's attempt to return Yorda to her room in the castle after she was kidnapped by these warriors.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> Ueda believed this version had too much detail for the graphics engine they had developed, and as part of the &quot;subtracting design&quot;, replaced the warriors with the shadow creatures.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> Ueda also brought in a number of people outside the video game industry to help with development. These consisted of two programmers, four artists, and one designer in addition to Ueda and Kaido, forming the base of what is now known as <a href="Team_ICO" title="wikilink">Team ICO</a>.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a><a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> On reflection, Ueda noted that the subtracting design may have taken too much out of the game, and did not go to as great an extreme with <em>Shadow of the Colossus</em>.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a></p>
<p>After two years of development, the team ran into limitations on the PlayStation hardware and faced a critical choice: either terminate the project altogether, alter their vision to fit the constraints of the hardware, or continue to explore more options. The team decided to remain true to Ueda's vision, and began to use the <a href="Emotion_Engine" title="wikilink">Emotion Engine</a> of the <a href="PlayStation_2" title="wikilink">PlayStation 2</a>, taking advantage of the improved abilities of the platform.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a><a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> Character animation was accomplished through <a href="key_frame" title="wikilink">key frame</a> animation instead of the more common <a href="motion_capture" title="wikilink">motion capture</a> technique.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> <em>Ico</em> is recognized as one of the first games to incorporate <a href="bloom_(shader_effect)" title="wikilink">bloom lighting</a> into video games, a feature that is common in later <a href="seventh_generation_consoles" title="wikilink">seventh generation console</a> video games.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> The game took about four years to create.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> Ueda purposely left the ending vague, not stating whether Yorda was alive, whether she would travel with Ico, or if it was simply the protagonist's dream.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a></p>
<p>The cover used for releases in Japan and <a href="PAL_region" title="wikilink">PAL regions</a> was drawn by Ueda himself, and was inspired by the <a href="surrealist" class="uri" title="wikilink">surrealist</a> artist <a href="Giorgio_de_Chirico" title="wikilink">Giorgio de Chirico</a> and his work, <em><a href="The_Nostalgia_of_the_Infinite" title="wikilink">The Nostalgia of the Infinite</a></em>. Ueda believed that &quot;the surrealistic world of de Chirico matched the allegoric world of Ico&quot;.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> The North American version lacks this cover as well as additional features that become available after the player completes the game once.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> The development team was unable to provide Ueda's cover or the additional features in time for Sony's planned North American release date, but included them for the later releases in Japan and PAL regions.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> For its original release, a limited edition of the game was available in PAL regions that included a cardboard wrapping displaying artwork from the game and four art cards inside the box.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> The game was re-released as a standard edition in 2006 across all PAL regions except France after the 2005 release of <em>Shadow of the Colossus</em>, <em>Ico</em>{{'}} <a href="spiritual_sequel" title="wikilink">spiritual sequel</a>, to allow players to &quot;fill the gap in their collection&quot;.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="audio">Audio</h3>
<p><em>Ico</em> uses minimal dialog in a fictional language to provide the story throughout the game.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> Voice actors included <a href="Kazuhiro_Shindou" title="wikilink">Kazuhiro Shindou</a> as Ico, <a href="Reiko_Takahashi" title="wikilink">Reiko Takahashi</a> as Yorda, and <a href="Misa_Watanabe" title="wikilink">Misa Watanabe</a> as the Queen.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> Ico and the Queen's words are presented in either English or Japanese subtitles depending on the release region, but Yorda's speech is presented in a symbolic language.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> Ueda opted not to provide the translation for Yorda's words as it would have overcome the language barrier between Ico and Yorda, and detracted from the &quot;holding hands&quot; concept of the game.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a> In the non-North American releases, playing through the game again after completing the game replaces the symbolic text with appropriate language subtitles.<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a></p>
<p>Ico's audio featured a limited amount of music and sound effects.

<p>Despite selling only 700,000 copies worldwide, the bulk in PAL regions,<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a> <em>Ico</em> received strong <a href="game_critic" title="wikilink">reviews</a>, and has become a cult hit among <a href="video_game_player" title="wikilink">gamers</a>.<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a> The game has received aggregate review scores of 90 out of 100 at <a href="MetaCritic" class="uri" title="wikilink">MetaCritic</a><a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a> and 90% at <a href="Game_Rankings" title="wikilink">Game Rankings</a>.<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a> The game is considered to be one of the top video games of all time; <em><a href="Edge_(magazine)" title="wikilink">Edge</a></em> ranked <em>Ico</em> as the 13th top game in a 2007 listing,<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a> while <a href="IGN" class="uri" title="wikilink">IGN</a> ranked the game at number 18 in 2005,<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a> and at number 57 in 2007.<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a> <em>Ico</em> is commonly considered more a work of art than a video game.<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a><a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a><a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a> Ueda commented that he purposely tried to distance <em>Ico</em> from conventional video games due to the negative image that video games were receiving at that time, in order to draw more people to the title.<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a></p>
<p>Reviewers likened <em>Ico</em> to older, simpler adventure games such as <em><a href="Prince_of_Persia" title="wikilink">Prince of Persia</a></em> or <em><a href="Tomb_Raider" title="wikilink">Tomb Raider</a></em>, but expressing the game through its mood and environments help to evoke an emotional experience from the player;<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a> <a href="IGN" class="uri" title="wikilink">IGN</a>{{'}}s David Smith commented that stripped down, the game's &quot;challenge is just to move from point A to point B&quot;, but the game as a whole was a near-indescribable experience.<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a> The game's graphics and sound contributed strongly to the positive reactions from critics; Smith continues that &quot;The visuals, sound, and original puzzle design come together to make something that is almost, if not quite, completely unlike anything else on the market, and feels wonderful because of it.&quot;<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a> Reviews were impressed with the expansiveness and the details given to the environments and animation used for the main characters despite their low polygon count, and the use of lighting effects.<a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a><a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a><a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a> <em>Ico</em>{{'}}s ambiance, created by the simple music and the small attention to detail in the voice work of the main characters, were also called out as strong points for the game. Charles Herold of the <em><a href="New_York_Times" title="wikilink">New York Times</a></em> summed up his review stating that &quot;Ico is not a perfect game, but it is a game of perfect moments.&quot;<a href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a></p>
<p>The game is noted for its simple combat system that would &quot;disappoint those craving sheer mechanical depth&quot;, as stated by <a href="Gamespot" class="uri" title="wikilink">Gamespot</a>{{'}}s Miguel Lopez.<a href="#fn67" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a> The puzzle design, while considered easy and at times repetitive,<a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a> was found to have a structure that prompts players to work through the challenges themselves, instead of relying on <a href="walkthrough" title="wikilink">walkthroughs</a>. Kristen Reed of <a href="Eurogamer" class="uri" title="wikilink">Eurogamer</a> said that &quot;you quietly, logically, willingly proceed, and the illusion is perfect: the game never tells you what to do, even though the game is always telling you what to do&quot;.<a href="#fn69" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref69"><sup>69</sup></a> <em>Ico</em> is also considered a short game, taking between seven and ten hours for a single play through, but compounded by the fact, as noted by <a href="G4_(TV_channel)" title="wikilink">G4TV</a>'s Matthew Keil, that &quot;the urge to press on further into the breathtaking world of the game is so strong, many will finish 'Ico' in one or two sittings&quot;.<a href="#fn70" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a> The lack of features in the North American release, which would become unlocked on subsequent playthroughs after completing the game, was said to reduce the replay value of the title.<a href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a></p>
