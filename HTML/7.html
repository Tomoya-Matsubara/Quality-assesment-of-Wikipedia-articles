<p>Erik Bradley Wilhelm was born November 16, 1965 in the American city of <a href="Dayton,_Ohio" title="wikilink">Dayton, Ohio</a>.</p>
<p>Wilhelm began playing high school football at <a href="Gladstone_High_School_(Oregon)" title="wikilink">Gladstone High School</a> in <a href="Gladstone,_Oregon" title="wikilink">Gladstone, Oregon</a>, located 12 miles south of <a href="Portland,_Oregon" title="wikilink">Portland</a>, the state's biggest city. The left-handed quarterback developed into a fledgling star, gaining honors as a junior in 1982 when he was named to the Class-AA Oregon All-State team.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>In the summer of 1983 Wilhelm's family moved to <a href="Lake_Oswego,_Oregon" title="wikilink">Lake Oswego, Oregon</a>, another Portland suburb, with Erik enrolling at <a href="Lakeridge_High_School" title="wikilink">Lakeridge High School</a> for his senior year.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> There he quickly won the role of starting quarterback, taking over for the school's recently-graduated Class-AAA All-State quarterback, Todd Beahm.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> The highly-touted Wilhelm's collegiate options were broad and he accepted a scholarship to <a href="Oregon_State_University" title="wikilink">Oregon State University</a> in <a href="Corvallis,_Oregon" title="wikilink">Corvallis, Oregon</a>, where he enrolled in the fall of 1984.</p>

<p>After being cut from the NFL, Wilhelm returned to the <a href="Pacific_Northwest" title="wikilink">Pacific Northwest</a>, settling in the Southwest <a href="Washington_(state)" title="wikilink">Washington</a> city of <a href="Vancouver,_Washington" title="wikilink">Vancouver</a>, just north of Portland, Oregon.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> There he worked in partnership with his mother as a residential <a href="property_manager" title="wikilink">property manager</a>.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>Wilhelm still aspired for a return to the National Football League, believing he still had a sufficient range of skills to play at that level, and for the next three years worked out with a view to returning to the professional game, playing flag football to stay in shape and regularly throwing balls to friend <a href="Chad_Carlson" title="wikilink">Chad Carlson</a>, a former player in the <a href="Canadian_Football_League" title="wikilink">Canadian Football League</a>.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> Carlson, who formerly played wide receiver for the short-lived <a href="Portland_Forest_Dragons" title="wikilink">Portland Forest Dragons</a> of the <a href="Arena_Football_League" title="wikilink">Arena Football League</a> (AFL), learned of a franchise coming to Portland as part of the new <a href="Indoor_Professional_Football_League" title="wikilink">Indoor Professional Football League</a> (IPFL) and he persuaded Wilhelm to join him in trying out for the team.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p>In 2000 Wilhelm joined the <a href="Portland_Prowlers" title="wikilink">Portland Prowlers</a> of the IPFL as the team's starting quarterback.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> Wilhelm found the camaraderie of the IPFL fulfilling, if not financially lucrative, noting in a 2000 interview:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;&quot;I'm enjoying it tremendously because it's guys coming together, bonding and going for a common goal to win games and to learn an offense together, to practice together, to get beat up by the other team. Whether you have success or fail, you do it together. There's nothing that can really replace something like that. It's why guys play football. No matter if it's the NFL and you're getting paid a whole bunch of money or this league where you're gettin' beer and pizza money.&quot;<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wilhelm moved to the better established Arena Football League for the 2001 season, joining the AFL's <a href="Los_Angeles_Avengers" title="wikilink">Los Angeles Avengers</a> for the 2001 season.</p>
