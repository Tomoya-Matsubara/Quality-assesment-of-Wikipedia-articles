He is remembered for his exploits in <a href="China" class="uri" title="wikilink">China</a> and northern <a href="Africa" class="uri" title="wikilink">Africa</a>.</p>
<h2 id="early-career">Early career</h2>
<p>Born in <a href="Woolwich" class="uri" title="wikilink">Woolwich</a>, the son of Major-General Henry William Gordon (1786-1865), by his wife Elizabeth, n&lt;U+00E9&gt;e Enderby (1792-1873), he was educated at the <a href="Royal_Military_Academy" title="wikilink">Royal Military Academy</a> in Woolwich, starting in <a href="1848" class="uri" title="wikilink">1848</a>. He was commissioned in <a href="1852" class="uri" title="wikilink">1852</a> as a 2nd Lieutenant in the <a href="Royal_Engineers" title="wikilink">Royal Engineers</a>, completing his training at the Royal Engineers' school at <a href="Chatham,_Kent" title="wikilink">Chatham</a>, and promoted to full Lieutenant in <a href="1854" class="uri" title="wikilink">1854</a>.</p>
<p>At first, he was assigned to the construction of fortifications in defence of <a href="Milford_Haven" title="wikilink">Milford Haven</a>. However, the <a href="Crimean_War" title="wikilink">Crimean War</a> broke out and Gordon was ordered on active service, arriving at <a href="Balaklava" class="uri" title="wikilink">Balaklava</a> in January <a href="1855" class="uri" title="wikilink">1855</a>. He was put to work in the siege of <a href="Sevastopol" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sevastopol</a> and took part in the assault of <a href="Redan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Redan</a> from <a href="18_June" title="wikilink">18 June</a> to <a href="8_September" title="wikilink">8 September</a>. He took part in the expedition to <a href="Kinburn" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kinburn</a>, and returned to Sevastopol at the end of the conflict. With <a href="Treaty_of_Paris_(1856)" title="wikilink">the peace</a>, Gordon was attached to an international commission delimiting the new boundary between <a href="Russia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Russia</a> and <a href="Turkey" class="uri" title="wikilink">Turkey</a> in <a href="Bessarabia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bessarabia</a>. He continued with the surveying work, extending the marking of the boundary into <a href="Asia_Minor" title="wikilink">Asia Minor</a>. He returned to the United Kingdom towards the end of <a href="1858" class="uri" title="wikilink">1858</a>, and was appointed as an instructor at Chatham and was promoted to captain in April <a href="1859" class="uri" title="wikilink">1859</a>.</p>
<h2 id="china">China</h2>
<p><img src="charlesgordon3.jpg" title="fig:Charles Gordon as a Celestial titu (generalissimo)" alt="Charles Gordon as a Celestial titu (generalissimo)" /> His stay in the United Kingdom was brief; in <a href="1860" class="uri" title="wikilink">1860</a> war broke out in <a href="Chinese_Empire" title="wikilink">China</a> (see the <a href="Second_Opium_War" title="wikilink">Second Opium War</a> and the <a href="Taiping_Rebellion" title="wikilink">Taiping Rebellion</a>). Gordon volunteered to go, arriving at <a href="Tianjin" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tianjin</a> in September. He missed the attack on the <a href="Dagu" class="uri" title="wikilink">Dagu</a> forts, but was present at the occupation of <a href="Beijing" class="uri" title="wikilink">Beijing</a> and destruction of the <a href="Summer_Palace" title="wikilink">Summer Palace</a>. He remained with the British forces occupying northern China until April <a href="1862" class="uri" title="wikilink">1862</a>, when the troops, under General <a href="William_Staveley" title="wikilink">William Staveley</a>, withdrew to <a href="Shanghai" class="uri" title="wikilink">Shanghai</a> to protect the European settlement from the <a href="Taiping_Rebellion" title="wikilink">rebel Taiping army</a> which was threatening the city.</p>
<p>Following the successes in the <a href="1850s" class="uri" title="wikilink">1850s</a> in the <a href="Provinces_of_China" title="wikilink">provinces</a> of <a href="Guangxi" class="uri" title="wikilink">Guangxi</a>, <a href="Hunan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hunan</a> and <a href="Hubei" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hubei</a>, and the capture of <a href="Nanjing" class="uri" title="wikilink">Nanjing</a> in <a href="1853" class="uri" title="wikilink">1853</a> the rebel advance had slowed. For some years, the Taipings gradually advanced eastwards, but eventually they came close enough to Shanghai to alarm the European inhabitants. The city raised a militia of Europeans and Asians for the defence of the town. This force was placed under the command of an <a href="United_States_of_America" title="wikilink">American</a>, <a href="Frederick_Townsend_Ward" title="wikilink">Frederick Townsend Ward</a>, and occupied the country to the west of Shanghai.</p>
<p>The British arrived at a crucial time, Staveley decided to clear the rebels from within 30 miles from Shanghai in cooperation with Ward and a small <a href="France" title="wikilink">French</a> force. Gordon was attached to his staff as engineer officer. <a href="Jiading" class="uri" title="wikilink">Jiading</a> (Kahding), <a href="Qingpu" class="uri" title="wikilink">Qingpu</a> (Singpo) and other towns were occupied, and the area was fairly cleared of rebels by the end of <a href="1862" class="uri" title="wikilink">1862</a>.</p>
<p>Ward was killed in the <a href="Battle_of_Cixi" title="wikilink">Battle of Cixi</a> and his successor was disliked by the Imperial Chinese authorities. <a href="Li_Hongzhang" title="wikilink">Li Hongzhang</a>, the governor of the <a href="Jiangsu" class="uri" title="wikilink">Jiangsu</a> province, requested Staveley to appoint a British officer to command the contingent. Staveley selected Gordon, who had been made a <a href="brevet_(military)" title="wikilink">brevet</a> major in December <a href="1862" class="uri" title="wikilink">1862</a> and the nomination was approved by the British government. In March <a href="1863" class="uri" title="wikilink">1863</a> Gordon took command of the force at <a href="Songjiang" class="uri" title="wikilink">Songjiang</a>, which had received the name of &quot;<a href="Ever_Victorious_Army" title="wikilink">Ever Victorious Army</a>&quot;. Without waiting to reorganize his troops, Gordon led them at once to the relief of <a href="Chansu" class="uri" title="wikilink">Chansu</a>, a town 40 miles north-west of Shanghai. The relief was successfully accomplished and Gordon had quickly won respect from his troops. His task was made easier by the highly innovative military ideas Ward had implemented in the Ever Victorious Army.</p>
<p>He then reorganised his force and advanced against <a href="Kunshan" title="wikilink">Kunshan (Quinsan)</a>, which was captured at considerable loss. Gordon then took his force through the country, seizing towns until, with the aid of Imperial troops, the city of <a href="Suzhou" class="uri" title="wikilink">Suzhou</a> was captured in November. Following a dispute with Li Hongzhang over the execution of rebel leaders, Gordon withdrew his force from Suzhou and remained inactive at Kunshan until February <a href="1864" class="uri" title="wikilink">1864</a>. Gordon then made a rapprochement with Li and visited him in order to arrange for further operations. The &quot;Ever-Victorious Army&quot; resumed its high tempo advance, culminating in the capture of <a href="Chanchufu" class="uri" title="wikilink">Chanchufu</a> in May, the principal military base of the Taipings in the region. Gordon then returned to Kunshan and disbanded his force.</p>
<p>The Emperor promoted Gordon to the rank of <em>titu</em>, the highest grade in the Chinese army, and decorated him with the Yellow Jacket. The British Army promoted Gordon to lieutenant-colonel and he was made a Companion of the Bath. He also gained the popular nickname 'Chinese' Gordon.</p>
<h2 id="africa">Africa</h2>
<p><img src="Charles_George_Gordon_-_Project_Gutenberg_eText_13103.jpg" title="fig:General Gordon" alt="General Gordon" /> Gordon returned to the United Kingdom and commanded the Royal Engineer efforts around <a href="Gravesend,_Kent" title="wikilink">Gravesend</a>, the erection of forts for the defence of the <a href="River_Thames" title="wikilink">Thames</a>. In October <a href="1871" class="uri" title="wikilink">1871</a>, he was appointed British representative on the international commission to maintain the navigation of the mouth of the <a href="Danube" title="wikilink">River Danube</a>, with headquarters at <a href="Galatz" class="uri" title="wikilink">Galatz</a>. In <a href="1872" class="uri" title="wikilink">1872</a> Gordon was sent to inspect the British military cemeteries in the Crimea, and when passing through <a href="Constantinople" class="uri" title="wikilink">Constantinople</a> he made the acquaintance of the prime minister of <a href="Egypt" class="uri" title="wikilink">Egypt</a>, who opened negotiations for Gordon to serve under the <a href="Ismail_Pasha" title="wikilink">khedive</a>. In <a href="1873" class="uri" title="wikilink">1873</a> Gordon received a definite offer from the khedive, which he accepted with the consent of the British government, and proceeded to Egypt early in <a href="1874" class="uri" title="wikilink">1874</a>. Gordon was made a colonel in the Egyptian army.</p>
<p>The Egyptian authorities had been extending their control southwards since the <a href="1820s" class="uri" title="wikilink">1820s</a>. An expedition was sent up the <a href="White_Nile" title="wikilink">White Nile</a>, under Sir <a href="Samuel_Baker" title="wikilink">Samuel Baker</a>, which reached <a href="Khartoum" class="uri" title="wikilink">Khartoum</a> in February <a href="1870" class="uri" title="wikilink">1870</a> and <a href="Gondokoro" class="uri" title="wikilink">Gondokoro</a> in June <a href="1871" class="uri" title="wikilink">1871</a>. Baker met with great difficulties and managed little beyond establishing a few posts along the <a href="Nile" class="uri" title="wikilink">Nile</a>. The khedive asked for Gordon to succeed Baker as governor of the region. After a short stay in <a href="Cairo" class="uri" title="wikilink">Cairo</a>, Gordon proceeded to Khartoum via Suakin and Berber. From Khartoum, he proceeded up the White Nile to Gondokoro.</p>
<p>Gordon remained in the Gondokoro provinces until October <a href="1876" class="uri" title="wikilink">1876</a>. He had succeeded in establishing a line of way stations from the Sobat confluence on the White Nile to the frontier of <a href="Uganda" class="uri" title="wikilink">Uganda</a>, where he proposed to open a route from <a href="Mombasa" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mombasa</a>. In <a href="1874" class="uri" title="wikilink">1874</a> he built the station at <a href="Dufile" class="uri" title="wikilink">Dufile</a> on the <a href="Albert_Nile" title="wikilink">Albert Nile</a> to reassemble steamers carried there past rapids for the exploration of <a href="Lake_Albert" title="wikilink">Lake Albert</a>. Considerable progress was made in the suppression of the <a href="Slavery" title="wikilink">slave</a> trade. However, Gordon had come into conflict with the Egyptian governor of Khartoum and <a href="Sudan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sudan</a>. The clash led to Gordon informing the khedive that he did not wish to return to the Sudan and he left for <a href="London" class="uri" title="wikilink">London</a>. Ismail Pasha wrote to him saying that he had promised to return, and that he expected him to keep his word. Gordon agreed to return to Cairo, but insisted that he be appointed governor-general of the entire Sudan. After some discussion the khedive agreed, and made him governor-general of the entire Sudan</p>
<p>As governor, Gordon faced a variety of challenges. Relations between Egypt and <a href="Abyssinia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Abyssinia</a> had become strained due to a dispute over the district of Bogos, and war broke out in <a href="1875" class="uri" title="wikilink">1875</a>. An Egyptian expedition was completely defeated near Gundet. A second and larger expedition, under Prince Hassan, was sent the following year and was routed at Gura. Matters then remained quiet until March <a href="1877" class="uri" title="wikilink">1877</a>, when Gordon proceeded to Massawa hoping to make peace with the Abyssinians. He went up to Bogos and wrote to the king proposing terms. However, he received no reply as the king had gone southwards to fight with the Shoa. Gordon, seeing that the Abyssinian difficulty could wait, proceeded to Khartoum.</p>
<p>An <a href="insurgent" title="wikilink">insurrection</a> had broken out in <a href="Darfur" class="uri" title="wikilink">Darfur</a> and Gordon went there. The insurgents were very numerous and he saw that diplomacy had a better chance of success. Gordon, accompanied only by an interpreter, rode into the enemy's camp to discuss the situation. This bold move proved successful, as many of the insurgents joined him, though the remainder retreated to the south. Gordon then visited the provinces of Berber and Dongola, and then returned to the Abyssinian frontier before ending up back in Khartoum in January <a href="1878" class="uri" title="wikilink">1878</a>. Gordon was summoned to Cairo, and arrived in March to be appointed president of a commission. The khedive was deposed in <a href="1879" class="uri" title="wikilink">1879</a> in favour of his son.</p>
<p>Gordon returned south. He proceeded to <a href="Harrar" class="uri" title="wikilink">Harrar</a>, south of Abyssinia, and, finding the administration in poor standing, dismissed the governor. He then returned to Khartoum, and went again into Darfur to suppress the slave traders. His subordinate, <a href="Romolo_Gessi" title="wikilink">Gessi Pasha</a>, fought with great success in the <a href="Bahr_el_Ghazal" title="wikilink">Bahr-el-Ghazal</a> district in putting an end to the revolt there. Gordon then tried another peace mission to Abyssinia. The matter ended with Gordon's imprisonment and transfer to Massawa. Thence he returned to Cairo and resigned his Sudan appointment. He was exhausted by the years of incessant work.</p>
<p>In March <a href="1880" class="uri" title="wikilink">1880</a> Gordon visited King Leopold in Brussels and was invited to take charge of the <a href="Congo_Free_State" title="wikilink">Congo Free State</a>. In April, the government of the <a href="Cape_Colony" title="wikilink">Cape Colony</a> offered him the position of commandant of the Cape local forces. In May the <a href="George_Robinson,_1st_Marquess_of_Ripon" title="wikilink">Marquess of Ripon</a>, who had been given the post of <a href="Governor-General_of_India" title="wikilink">Governor-General of India</a>, asked Gordon to go with him as private secretary. Gordon accepted the offer, but shortly after arriving in India he resigned. Hardly had he resigned when he was invited by <a href="Sir_Robert_Hart,_1st_Baronet" title="wikilink">Sir Robert Hart, 1st Baronet</a>, inspector-general of customs in China, to Beijing. He arrived in China in July and met Li Hongzhang, and learnt that there was risk of war with Russia. Gordon proceeded to Beijing and used all his influence to ensure peace. Gordon returned to the United Kingdom, but in April <a href="1881" class="uri" title="wikilink">1881</a> left for <a href="Mauritius" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mauritius</a> as Commanding Royal Engineer. He remained in Mauritius until March <a href="1882" class="uri" title="wikilink">1882</a>, when he was promoted to major-general. He was sent to the Cape to aid in settling affairs in <a href="Basutoland" class="uri" title="wikilink">Basutoland</a>. He returned to the United Kingdom after only a few months. Being unemployed, Gordon decided to go to Palestine, a country he had long desired to visit; he would remain there for a year. The king of the Belgians then asked him again to take charge of the Congo Free State. He accepted and returned to London to make preparations, but soon after his arrival the British requested that he proceed immediately to the Sudan, where the situation had declined badly after his departure -- another revolt had arisen, led by the self-proclaimed <a href="mahdi" class="uri" title="wikilink">mahdi</a>, <a href="Mahommed_Ahmed" title="wikilink">Mahommed Ahmed</a>.</p>
<p>The Egyptian forces in the Sudan were insufficient to cope with the rebels, and the northern government was occupied in the suppression of the <a href="Ahmed_Urabi" title="wikilink">Arabi</a> revolt. By September <a href="1882" class="uri" title="wikilink">1882</a> the Sudanese position had grown perilous. In December <a href="1883" class="uri" title="wikilink">1883</a>, the British government ordered Egypt to abandon the Sudan, but abandonment was difficult to carry out as it involved the withdrawal of thousands of Egyptian soldiers, civilian employees and their families. The British government asked Gordon to proceed to Khartoum to report on the best method of carrying out the evacuation.</p>
<p>Gordon started for Cairo in January <a href="1884" class="uri" title="wikilink">1884</a>, accompanied by <a href="John_Donald_Hamill_Stewart" title="wikilink">Lt Col J D H Stewart</a>. At Cairo, he received further instructions from <a href="Evelyn_Baring,_1st_Earl_of_Cromer" title="wikilink">Sir Evelyn Baring</a>, and was appointed governor-general with executive powers. Travelling through Korosko and Berber, he arrived at Khartoum on <a href="February_18" title="wikilink">February 18</a>. Gordon at once commenced the task of sending the women and children and the sick and wounded to Egypt, and about 2,500 had been removed before the Mahdi&lt;U+2019&gt;s forces closed in. Gordon hoped to have the influential local leader <a href="Zobeir" class="uri" title="wikilink">Zobeir</a> appointed to take control of Sudan, but the British government refused to support a former slaver.</p>
<p>The advance of the rebels against Khartoum was combined with a revolt in the eastern Sudan; the Egyptian troops at Suakin were repeatedly defeated. A British force was sent to Suakin under General Sir <a href="Gerald_Graham" title="wikilink">Gerald Graham</a>, and forced the rebels away in several hard-fought actions. Gordon urged that the road from Suakin to Berber be opened, but his request was refused by the government in London, and in April Graham and his forces were withdrawn and Gordon and the Sudan were abandoned. The garrison at Berber surrendered in May and Khartoum was completely isolated.</p>
<p><img src="gordonheston1.jpg" title="fig:Charlton Heston (right) as Gordon with Richard Johnson (left) as Colonel J.D.H. Stewart in the 1966 film Khartoum" alt="Charlton Heston (right) as Gordon with Richard Johnson (left) as Colonel J.D.H. Stewart in the 1966 film Khartoum" width="150" /> Gordon organized the defence of Khartoum, with a siege starting on <a href="March_18" title="wikilink">March 18</a>, <a href="1884" class="uri" title="wikilink">1884</a>. The British had decided to abandon the Sudan, but it was clear that Gordon had other plans, and the public increasingly called for his relief. It was not until August that the government decided to take steps to relieve Gordon, and only by November was the British relief force ready.</p>
<p>The force consisted of two groups, a &quot;flying column&quot; of camel-borne troops from <a href="Wadi_Halfa" title="wikilink">Wadi Halfa</a>. The troops reached Korti towards the end of December, and arrived at Metemma on <a href="January_20" title="wikilink">January 20</a>. There they found four gunboats which had been sent south by Gordon four months earlier, and prepared them for the trip back up the Nile. On the 24th, two of the steamers started for Khartoum, but on arriving there on the 28th, they found that the city had been captured and Gordon dead, having been killed two days previously (2 days before his 52nd birthday). After he had been beheaded by <a href="Mahdi" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mahdi</a> <a href="Mohammed_Ahmed" title="wikilink">Mohammed Ahmed</a>'s soldiers, his head was displayed on a spear.</p>
<h2 id="gordon-and-calvary">Gordon and Calvary</h2>
<p>After his visit to Palestine in 1882-83, Gordon suggested a different location for <a href="Golgotha" class="uri" title="wikilink">Golgotha</a>, the site of <a href="Christ" class="uri" title="wikilink">Christ</a>'s <a href="crucifixion" class="uri" title="wikilink">crucifixion</a>, to the traditional site to the north of the <a href="Holy_Sepulchre" title="wikilink">Holy Sepulchre</a>. This site, now known as &quot;The <a href="Garden_Tomb" title="wikilink">Garden Tomb</a>&quot;, and sometimes as &quot;Gordon's Calvary&quot;, is regarded by many as a logical location.</p>
<h2 id="remembered-as-a-hero">Remembered as a hero</h2>
<p><img src="Gordondeath.jpg" title="fig:Joy&#39;s portrayal of Gordon&#39;s death" alt="Joy&#39;s portrayal of Gordon&#39;s death" />The manner of his death is uncertain but it was romanticised in a popular painting by <a href="George_William_Joy" title="wikilink">George William Joy</a> - <em>General Gordon's Last Stand</em> (1885, currently in the Leeds City Art Gallery) - and again in the film <em><a href="Khartoum_(film)" title="wikilink">Khartoum</a></em> (<a href="1966" class="uri" title="wikilink">1966</a>) with <a href="Charlton_Heston" title="wikilink">Charlton Heston</a> as the British General.</p>
<p>General Gordon has also had a <a href="http://www.gordons.surrey.sch.uk/">school</a> dedicated to his memory situated in <a href="Woking" class="uri" title="wikilink">Woking</a>, <a href="Surrey" class="uri" title="wikilink">Surrey</a>. Gordon was supposedly Queen Victoria's favourite general, hence the fact that the school was commissioned by <a href="Victoria_of_the_United_Kingdom" title="wikilink">Queen Victoria</a>.</p>
<p>Gordon's memory (as well as his work in supervising the town's riverside fortifications) is commemorated in <a href="Gravesend,_Kent" title="wikilink">Gravesend</a>; the embankment of the Riverside Leisure Area is known as the Gordon Promenade, while Khartoum Place lies just to the south. In the town centre of his birthplace of Woolwich is General Gordon Square.</p>
<p>In <a href="1888" class="uri" title="wikilink">1888</a> a statue of Gordon by <a href="Hamo_Thornycroft" title="wikilink">Hamo Thornycroft</a> was erected in <a href="Trafalgar_Square" title="wikilink">Trafalgar Square</a>, <a href="London" class="uri" title="wikilink">London</a>, removed in 1943 and in 1953 relocated to the <a href="Victoria_Embankment" title="wikilink">Victoria Embankment</a>. An identical statue by Thornycroft is located in Gordon Reserve near <a href="Parliament_House,_Melbourne" title="wikilink">Parliament House</a> in <a href="Melbourne" class="uri" title="wikilink">Melbourne</a>, <a href="Australia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Australia</a> (a statue of his relative, <a href="Adam_Lindsay_Gordon" title="wikilink">Adam Lindsay Gordon</a>, lies in the same reserve). Funded by donations from 100,000 citizens, it was unveiled in <a href="1889" class="uri" title="wikilink">1889</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="Corps_of_Royal_Engineers" title="wikilink">Corps of Royal Engineers</a>, Gordon's own Corps, commissioned a statue of Gordon on a camel. It was exhibited at the <a href="Royal_Academy" title="wikilink">Royal Academy</a> in 1890 and then erected in Brompton Barracks, Chatham, the home of the Royal School of Military Engineering, where it still stands. Much later a second casting was made and installed at Khartoum. This is the figure which now stands at the Gordon School. The Royal Engineers Museum adjoining the Barracks has many artefacts relating to Gordon including personal possessions. There are also memorials to Gordon in the nearby <a href="Rochester_Cathedral" title="wikilink">Rochester Cathedral</a>.</p>
<p>A rather fine stained-glass portrait is to be found on the main stairs of the Booloominbah building at the <a href="University_of_New_England,_Australia" title="wikilink">University of New England</a>, in <a href="Armidale" class="uri" title="wikilink">Armidale</a>, NSW, Australia.</p>

<p>The City of <a href="Geelong,_Victoria" title="wikilink">Geelong, Victoria</a>, Australia erected a memorial in the form of the <a href="Gordon_Technical_College" title="wikilink">Gordon Technical College</a>, which was renamed the <a href="Gordon_Institute_of_Technology" title="wikilink">Gordon Institute of Technology</a>.
