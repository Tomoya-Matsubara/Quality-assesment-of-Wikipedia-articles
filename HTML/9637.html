The game was developed, published, and distributed by <a href="Electronic_Arts" title="wikilink">Electronic Arts</a>. It was released in North America in October 2007 and worldwide in November 2007. It features an original storyline written by <a href="Tim_Long" title="wikilink">Tim Long</a>, <a href="Matt_Selman" title="wikilink">Matt Selman</a>, and <a href="Matt_Warburton" title="wikilink">Matt Warburton</a>. In the <a href="meta-joke" title="wikilink">self-referential</a> plot, the family discovers that they are forced to participate in another <em>The Simpsons</em> video game. Similar to the show, the game pokes fun at <a href="popular_culture" title="wikilink">popular culture</a>, other video games, and Electronic Arts, its publisher.</p>
<p>The game follows the five Simpson family members&lt;U+2014&gt;<a href="Homer_Simpson" title="wikilink">Homer</a>, <a href="Marge_Simpson" title="wikilink">Marge</a> (with <a href="Maggie_Simpson" title="wikilink">Maggie</a>), <a href="Bart_Simpson" title="wikilink">Bart</a>, and <a href="Lisa_Simpson" title="wikilink">Lisa</a>&lt;U+2014&gt;who learn they are part of a video game and are given superpowers to resolve several situations. Eventually, they must save their <a href="history_of_video_game_consoles_(third_generation)" title="wikilink">8-bit</a> predecessors from <a href="Will_Wright_(game_designer)" title="wikilink">Will Wright</a>, the game's antagonist, and the creator of their video game character selves, <a href="Matt_Groening" title="wikilink">Matt Groening</a>. The Simpson family travels to four scenarios in parodies of other games to collect key cards used to infiltrate their creator's mansion and ultimately to save their predecessors from destruction.</p>
<p>Video game critics gave the game a mixed reaction. They praised its visuals and writing, which included many parodies of other video games, while they criticized its short length and poor <a href="camera_system" title="wikilink">camera system</a>, which did not always function properly. <em>The Simpsons Game</em> received the Best Game Based on a Movie or TV Show award at the 2007 <a href="Spike_Video_Game_Awards" title="wikilink">Spike Video Game Awards</a> and was nominated for Best Video Game Writing at the <a href="Writers_Guild_of_America_Awards_2007" title="wikilink">2007</a> <a href="Writers_Guild_of_America_Award" title="wikilink">Writers Guild of America Awards</a>. As of January 31, 2008, four million copies of the game have been sold worldwide.</p>

<h2 id="plot">Plot</h2>
<p>Bart goes to the video game store and coerces the clerk to let him buy the new and violent <em>Grand Theft Scratchy</em> game, only to have it confiscated by Marge. While Bart mopes, a video game manual crashes down from the sky in front of him. Reading through the manual, Bart discovers that he and the rest of his family have special powers. Later, Bart uses his Bartman powers to stop <a href="Jimbo_Jones" title="wikilink">Jimbo</a>, <a href="Kearney_Zzyzwicz" title="wikilink">Kearney</a>, and <a href="Dolph_(The_Simpsons)" title="wikilink">Dolph</a> from stealing from the Natural History Museum, Homer uses his ability to become a huge ball and win an eating contest, Lisa uses her powers of meditation to stop a <a href="deforestation" class="uri" title="wikilink">deforestation</a> project, and Marge uses her powers to influence crowds to stop the release of <em>Grand Theft Scratchy</em> in <a href="Springfield_(The_Simpsons)" title="wikilink">Springfield</a>, although Lisa points out it is ironic she used violence to stop a violent game.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a></p>
<p>During dinner, the family is euphoric with their new powers. However, it leads to an argument about what they should be doing with them. Aliens <a href="Kang_and_Kodos" title="wikilink">Kang and Kodos</a> see this as an opportunity to strike Earth, and an alien invasion unfolds. Realizing none of their powers are strong enough to defeat the aliens, Bart and Lisa visit <a href="Professor_Frink" title="wikilink">Professor Frink</a>. Frink gives them <em>The Simpsons Game</em>{{'}}s player's guide to teach them how to better use their powers as well as gain new ones, and the Simpson family soon sets out to try and stop the alien invasion. First, Bart and Lisa aid <a href="Captain_McCallister" title="wikilink">Captain McCallister</a> in beating back mind-controlled <a href="dolphin" title="wikilink">dolphins</a> that are attacking the city aquarium. Then, Bart and Homer defeat the Lard Lad statue which has come to life. Finally, they rescue <a href="Cletus_Spuckler" title="wikilink">Cletus</a> from the aliens.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a></p>
<p>In order to find out the truth, the family turns to the Internet to discover more about the powers they have in the game, but are accidentally sent to the <a href="game_engine" title="wikilink">game engine</a> when Homer spills beer over the keyboard. There, they discover <a href="Will_Wright_(game_designer)" title="wikilink">Will Wright</a>, who is destroying copies of an old <a href="History_of_video_game_consoles_(third_generation)" title="wikilink">8-bit</a> <em>The Simpsons</em> game and its characters. The family manages to save their 8-bit predecessors before they are destroyed by Wright, and discover that they will also become obsolete when the next <em>The Simpsons</em> game is released. The only way to prevent this is to talk to the creator of the games and convince him not to destroy them. In order to access his mansion, the family needs to acquire four key cards from four upcoming <em>Simpsons</em> games. First, Homer and Marge defeat a dragon in the <em>Neverquest</em> game. Next, Homer and Bart travel to <a href="France" class="uri" title="wikilink">France</a> during <a href="World_War_II" title="wikilink">World War II</a> to thwart Mr. Burns' plan to steal priceless French paintings, in the <em>Medal of Homer</em> game. Marge and Lisa then travel to <em>Grand Theft Scratchy</em>, eliminating all offensive material and replacing it with more family-friendly material. Lisa and Homer then travel to ancient <a href="Japan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Japan</a> to defeat the evil Mr. Dirt in the <em>Big Super Happy Fun Fun Game</em>.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a></p>
<p>Once they have all four key cards, Bart and Homer infiltrate the creator's mansion. They are greeted by <a href="Matt_Groening" title="wikilink">Matt Groening</a>, who sends <em><a href="Futurama" class="uri" title="wikilink">Futurama</a></em> characters <a href="Bender_(Futurama)" title="wikilink">Bender</a> and <a href="Dr._Zoidberg" title="wikilink">Dr. Zoidberg</a> after them. The family manages to defeat them, however, and Groening admits that he is only creating new games for the money, and destroys the game engine. The Simpsons, along with several other characters from the games escape to Springfield, where the aliens are still attacking. Lisa uses her power to create a stairway to heaven, and the family asks God for advice. After he is defeated in a game of <em><a href="Dance_Dance_Revolution" title="wikilink">Dance Dance Revolution</a></em>, God reveals that he dropped the video game manual by accident, thus endowing the family with superpowers. Realizing his misdemeanor, he promises to restore Springfield, and that no more <em>Simpsons</em> games will be released that would make the current characters obsolete.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a></p>

<p><em>The Simpsons Game</em> was published by <a href="Electronic_Arts" title="wikilink">Electronic Arts</a> and developed by its subsidiary, <a href="EA_Redwood_Shores" title="wikilink">EA Redwood Shores</a>; the company had signed a contract for the video game rights to <em>The Simpsons</em> in 2005.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> The game's lead designer, Greg Rizzer, said that when he asked his bosses if they could parody some Electronic Arts games including <em><a href="Medal_of_Honor_(series)" title="wikilink">Medal of Honor</a></em>, they were enthusiastic about it.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> <em>The Simpsons Game</em>, which parodies video games from 30 years ago to the present, was forced to have some of its content removed after several video game companies complained about it. Rizzer, however, was still pleased with the amount of parody in the game and considered <em>The Simpsons</em> the &quot;perfect vehicle to poke fun at the games industry&quot;.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> At the 2007 <a href="Games_Convention" title="wikilink">Games Convention</a> in <a href="Leipzig,_Germany" title="wikilink">Leipzig</a>, <a href="Germany" class="uri" title="wikilink">Germany</a>, a poster for &quot;Grand Theft Scratchy&quot;, one of the levels in <em>The Simpsons Game</em> and a parody of <em><a href="Grand_Theft_Auto_(series)" title="wikilink">Grand Theft Auto</a></em>, was asked to be taken down by an employee of <a href="Rockstar_Games" title="wikilink">Rockstar Games</a>, the company that develops the <em>Grand Theft Auto</em> series of video games. Several companies, however, embraced the game's parody of their video games, including developers from <a href="Harmonix" class="uri" title="wikilink">Harmonix</a>, who were pleased with the game's &quot;Sitar Hero&quot;, a parody of Harmonix's <em><a href="Guitar_Hero" title="wikilink">Guitar Hero</a></em> video game.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> In addition to game parodies, <em>The Simpsons Game</em> also features several cameos with satirical spins, including Matt Groening as himself and Will Wright as an antagonist.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a></p>
<p>The graphics for the game's characters are <a href="cel-shaded_animation" title="wikilink">cel-shaded</a>, and an implemented technique helps flatten the character models from any angle that the camera views them from, in order to recreate the 2D, hand-drawn look seen in the show.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> The development team found it particularly difficult to render Lisa's spiky hair as 2D in the game's 3D environment.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a> When working on the game for the <a href="Wii" class="uri" title="wikilink">Wii</a>, several compromises had to be made when compared to the game's versions for the <a href="Xbox_360" title="wikilink">Xbox 360</a> and the <a href="PlayStation_3" title="wikilink">PlayStation 3</a>. Because the Xbox 360 and the PlayStation 3 had greater processing power than the Wii, the graphics were decreased in quality in the Wii version of the game.<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="reception">Reception</h2>

<p>The game received mostly mixed to positive reaction, receiving an aggregated score of 71% on <a href="Metacritic" class="uri" title="wikilink">Metacritic</a> for the <a href="Xbox_360" title="wikilink">Xbox 360</a> &amp; <a href="PS3" class="uri" title="wikilink">PS3</a> version of the game.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a> Praise focused on the game's visuals and writing, which lampooned the gaming industry and the show itself. <em>The Simpsons Game</em> won the award for Best Game Based on a Movie or TV Show at the <a href="Spike_Video_Game_Awards" title="wikilink">Spike Video Game Awards</a> 2007,<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a> and was nominated for the first-ever award for Best Video Game Writing at the <a href="Writers_Guild_of_America_Awards_2007" title="wikilink">Writers Guild of America Awards 2007</a>.<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a> As of January 31, 2008, four million copies of the game have been sold.<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a> Peter Nowak of <a href="CBC_News" title="wikilink">CBC News</a> named it the third-best game of 2007 and described it as &quot;easily the best game starring the wacky residents of Springfield&quot;.<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a></p>
<p>The game's use of <em>The Simpsons</em>-style humor received a mixed reception. Both <a href="GameSpot" class="uri" title="wikilink">GameSpot</a> and <a href="GameTrailers" class="uri" title="wikilink">GameTrailers</a> said that the game delivered more than enough laughs to make it worth playing through at least once.<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a><a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a> It was considered enjoyable for both hardcore and casual <em>The Simpsons</em> fans by <a href="IGN" class="uri" title="wikilink">IGN</a> and <a href="GameDaily" class="uri" title="wikilink">GameDaily</a>, who also called it a particularly appealing game for diehard fans.<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a><a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a> Despite the few problems that the game had, <a href="GameSpy" class="uri" title="wikilink">GameSpy</a> said that it was worth it to see the humorous parodies.<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a> <a href="Eurogamer" class="uri" title="wikilink">Eurogamer</a>'s Tom Bramwell, however, believed that the game's humor could only carry it so far, and suggested that those interested in <em>The Simpsons</em> humor should purchase a <a href="box_set" title="wikilink">box set</a> of one of the television series' seasons instead.<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a> Joe Juba of <em><a href="Game_Informer" title="wikilink">Game Informer</a></em> called the game an average experience. He elaborated that the game would appeal primarily to fans of the television series, but would not be worth playing for people unfamiliar with it.<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a></p>
<p>Eurogamer praised the involvement of people from <em>The Simpsons</em> television series with the game's development,<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a> and <a href="GameZone" class="uri" title="wikilink">GameZone</a> enjoyed the two-character mechanics of the game and had fun collecting unlockable items.<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a> GameTrailers thought the graphics and animations looked great and appreciated the hand-drawn appearances, even though they found it obvious that the characters were &quot;never really meant to jump into the third dimension&quot; because of their second-dimension roots.<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a></p>
<p>Criticism of the game focused on its short, uninspiring gameplay and troublesome <a href="camera_system" title="wikilink">camera system</a>. GameSpot considered the gameplay &quot;nothing special&quot;,<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a> and GameZone called it a &quot;pretty shallow&quot; game that depended too much on repetitive jumping puzzles and a weak combat system.<a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a> The game disappointed IGN because it did not include an online feature and that it was too short.<a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a> The camera system was found to be problematic by both GameZone and GameSpy, who called it &quot;a pain&quot; and a &quot;busted&quot; feature;<a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a><a href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a> GameDaily also found it bothersome because it often got stuck.<a href="#fn67" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a></p>
<p>The DS version of the game, which was significantly different from the other versions, received praise for its unique gameplay but criticism for its short length. IGN lauded the DS version's unique gameplay experience,<a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a> and GameSpot proclaimed that is was satisfying from start to finish.<a href="#fn69" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref69"><sup>69</sup></a> GameSpot and GameZone, however, were both disappointed that the game was extremely brief.<a href="#fn70" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a><a href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a> 1UP found that even though <em>The Simpsons Game</em> parodied numerous 2D platform game conventions, it used them anyway, making it a pointless endeavor.<a href="#fn72" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref72"><sup>72</sup></a></p>
