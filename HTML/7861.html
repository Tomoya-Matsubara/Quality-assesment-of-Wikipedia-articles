<p>Georges Bizet</p>
</center>
<p>]] <strong>Georges Bizet</strong> () formally <strong>Alexandre C&lt;U+00E9&gt;sar L&lt;U+00E9&gt;opold Bizet</strong>, (25 October 18383Â June 1875) was a French composer, mainly of operas. In a career cut short by his early death, he achieved few successes before his final work, <em><a href="Carmen" class="uri" title="wikilink">Carmen</a></em>, became one of the most popular and frequently performed works in the entire opera repertory.</p>
<p>During a brilliant student career at the <a href="Conservatoire_de_Paris" title="wikilink">Conservatoire de Paris</a>, Bizet won many prizes, including the prestigious <a href="Prix_de_Rome" title="wikilink">Prix de Rome</a> in 1857. He was recognised as an outstanding pianist, though he chose not to capitalise on this skill and rarely performed in public. Returning to Paris after almost three years in Italy, he found that the main Parisian opera theatres preferred the established classical repertoire to the works of newcomers. His keyboard and orchestral compositions were likewise largely ignored; as a result, his career stalled, and he earned his living mainly by arranging and transcribing the music of others. Restless for success, he began many theatrical projects during the 1860s, most of which were abandoned. Neither of the two operas that reached the stage&lt;U+2014&gt;<em><a href="Les_p&lt;U+00EA&gt;cheurs_de_perles" title="wikilink">Les p&lt;U+00EA&gt;cheurs de perles</a></em> and <em><a href="La_jolie_fille_de_Perth" title="wikilink">La jolie fille de Perth</a></em>&lt;U+2014&gt;was immediately successful.</p>
<p>After the <a href="Franco-Prussian_War" title="wikilink">Franco-Prussian War</a> of 1870&lt;U+2013&gt;71, in which Bizet served in the National Guard, he had little success with his one-act opera <em><a href="Djamileh" class="uri" title="wikilink">Djamileh</a></em>, though an orchestral suite derived from his incidental music to <a href="Alphonse_Daudet" title="wikilink">Alphonse Daudet</a>'s play <em>L'Arl&lt;U+00E9&gt;sienne</em> was instantly popular. The production of Bizet's final opera <em>Carmen</em> was delayed through fears that its themes of betrayal and murder would offend audiences. After its premiere on 3 March 1875, Bizet was convinced that the work was a failure; he died of a heart attack three months later, unaware that it would prove a spectacular and enduring success.</p>
<p>Bizet's marriage to <a href="Genevi&lt;U+00E8&gt;ve_Hal&lt;U+00E9&gt;vy" title="wikilink">Genevi&lt;U+00E8&gt;ve Hal&lt;U+00E9&gt;vy</a> was intermittently happy and produced one son. After his death, his work, apart from <em>Carmen</em>, was generally neglected. Manuscripts were given away or lost, and published versions of his works were frequently revised and adapted by other hands. He founded no school and had no obvious disciples or successors. After years of neglect, his works began to be performed more frequently in the 20th century. Later commentators have acclaimed him as a composer of brilliance and originality whose premature death was a significant loss to French musical theatre.</p>

<p>Georges Bizet was born in Paris on 25 October 1838. He was registered as Alexandre C&lt;U+00E9&gt;sar L&lt;U+00E9&gt;opold, but baptised as &quot;Georges&quot; on 16 March 1840, and was known by this name for the rest of his life. His father, Adolphe Bizet, had been a hairdresser and wigmaker before becoming a singing teacher despite his lack of formal training.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> He also composed a few works, including at least one published song.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> In 1837 Adolphe married Aim&lt;U+00E9&gt;e Delsarte, against the wishes of her family who considered him a poor prospect; the Delsartes, though impoverished, were a cultured and highly musical family.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> Aim&lt;U+00E9&gt;e was an accomplished pianist, while her brother <a href="Fran&lt;U+00E7&gt;ois_Delsarte" title="wikilink">Fran&lt;U+00E7&gt;ois Delsarte</a> was a distinguished singer and teacher who performed at the courts of both <a href="Louis_Philippe_I" title="wikilink">Louis Philippe</a> and <a href="Napoleon_III" title="wikilink">Napoleon III</a>.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> Fran&lt;U+00E7&gt;ois Delsarte's wife Rosine, a musical prodigy, had been an assistant professor of <a href="solfeggio" title="wikilink">solf&lt;U+00E8&gt;ge</a> at the <a href="Conservatoire_de_Paris" title="wikilink">Conservatoire de Paris</a> at the age of 13.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>Georges, an only child,<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> showed early aptitude for music and quickly picked up the basics of musical notation from his mother, who probably gave him his first piano lessons.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> By listening at the door of the room where Adolphe conducted his classes, Georges learned to sing difficult songs accurately from memory, and developed an ability to identify and analyse complex <a href="chord_(music)" title="wikilink">chordal structures</a>. This precocity convinced his ambitious parents that he was ready to begin studying at the Conservatoire, even though he was still only nine years old (the minimum entry age was 10). Georges was interviewed by <a href="Joseph_Meifred" title="wikilink">Joseph Meifred</a>, the <a href="French_horn" title="wikilink">horn</a> virtuoso who was a member of the Conservatoire's Committee of Studies. Meifred was so struck by the boy's demonstration of his skills that he waived the age rule and offered to take him as soon as a place became available.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a><a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>

Zimmermann gave Bizet private lessons in <a href="counterpoint" class="uri" title="wikilink">counterpoint</a> and <a href="fugue" class="uri" title="wikilink">fugue</a>, which continued until the old man's death in 1853.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> Through these classes Bizet met Zimmermann's son-in-law, the composer <a href="Charles_Gounod" title="wikilink">Charles Gounod</a>, who became a lasting influence on the young pupil's musical style&lt;U+2014&gt;although their relationship was often strained in later years.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> Under the tuition of <a href="Antoine_Fran&lt;U+00E7&gt;ois_Marmontel" title="wikilink">Antoine Fran&lt;U+00E7&gt;ois Marmontel</a>, the Conservatoire's professor of piano, Bizet's pianism developed rapidly; he won the Conservatoire's second prize for piano in 1851, and first prize the following year. Bizet would later write to Marmontel: &quot;In your class one learns something besides the piano; one becomes a musician&quot;.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> <img src="Aged_Charles_Gounod.jpg" title="fig:Charles Gounod, depicted here in later life, was a mentor and inspiration to Bizet in the latter&#39;s Conservatoire years." alt="Charles Gounod, depicted here in later life, was a mentor and inspiration to Bizet in the latter&#39;s Conservatoire years." /> Bizet's first preserved compositions, two wordless songs for <a href="soprano" class="uri" title="wikilink">soprano</a>, date from around 1850. In 1853 he joined <a href="Fromental_Hal&lt;U+00E9&gt;vy" title="wikilink">Fromental Hal&lt;U+00E9&gt;vy</a>'s composition class, and began to produce works of increasing sophistication and quality.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> Two of his songs, &quot;Petite Marguerite&quot; and &quot;La Rose et l'abeille&quot;, were published in 1854.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> In 1855 he wrote an ambitious overture for a large orchestra,<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> and prepared four-hand piano versions of two of Gounod's works: the opera <em><a href="La_nonne_sanglante" title="wikilink">La nonne sanglante</a></em> and the Symphony in D. Bizet's work on the Gounod symphony inspired him, shortly after his seventeenth birthday, to write <a href="Symphony_in_C_(Bizet)" title="wikilink">his own symphony</a>, which bore a close resemblance to Gounod's&lt;U+2014&gt;note for note in some passages. Bizet's symphony was subsequently lost, rediscovered in 1933 and finally performed in 1935.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1856 Bizet competed for the prestigious <a href="Prix_de_Rome" title="wikilink">Prix de Rome</a>. His entry was not successful, but nor were any of the others; the musician's prize was not awarded that year.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> After this rebuff Bizet entered an opera competition which <a href="Jacques_Offenbach" title="wikilink">Jacques Offenbach</a> had organised for young composers, with a prize of 1,200 <a href="franc#French_franc" title="wikilink">francs</a>. The challenge was to set the one-act <a href="libretto" class="uri" title="wikilink">libretto</a> of <em><a href="Le_docteur_Miracle" title="wikilink">Le docteur Miracle</a></em> by L&lt;U+00E9&gt;on Battu and <a href="Ludovic_Hal&lt;U+00E9&gt;vy" title="wikilink">Ludovic Hal&lt;U+00E9&gt;vy</a>. The prize was awarded jointly to Bizet and <a href="Charles_Lecocq" title="wikilink">Charles Lecocq</a>,<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> a compromise which years later Lecocq criticised on the grounds of the jury's manipulation by Fromental Hal&lt;U+00E9&gt;vy in favour of Bizet.{{#tag:ref|Lecocq wrote: &quot;Bizet's score was not bad, but rather heavy, and he failed with almost all of the little couplets I was able to bring off&quot;. Mina Curtiss suggests that this pique reflected Lecocq's general disappointment with a career in which theatrical success largely eluded him.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a>|group= n}} As a result of his success Bizet became a regular guest at Offenbach's Friday evening parties, where among other musicians he met the aged <a href="Gioachino_Rossini" title="wikilink">Gioachino Rossini</a>, who presented the young man with a signed photograph.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a>{{#tag:ref|Although Bizet was initially flattered to be part of Offenbach's circle, and relished the contacts he made at the Friday gatherings, he became resentful of the hold which the older composer had established over French musical theatre, and grew contemptuous of his music. In a letter to <a href="Paul_Lacombe" title="wikilink">Paul Lacombe</a> in 1871 Bizet refers to &quot;the ever-increasing invasion of that infernal Offenbach&quot;, and dismisses Offenbach's work as &quot;trash&quot; and &quot;this obscenity&quot;.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a>|group= n}} Bizet was a great admirer of Rossini's music, and wrote not long after their first meeting that &quot;Rossini is the greatest of them all, because like Mozart, he has all the virtues&quot;.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a></p>
<p>For his 1857 Prix de Rome entry Bizet, with Gounod's enthusiastic approval, chose to set the <a href="cantata" class="uri" title="wikilink">cantata</a> <em>Clovis et Clotilde</em> by Am&lt;U+00E9&gt;d&lt;U+00E9&gt;e Burion. Bizet was awarded the prize after a ballot of the members of the <a href="Acad&lt;U+00E9&gt;mie_des_Beaux-Arts" title="wikilink">Acad&lt;U+00E9&gt;mie des Beaux-Arts</a> overturned the judges' initial decision, which was in favour of the oboist <a href="Charles_Colin" title="wikilink">Charles Colin</a>. Under the terms of the award, Bizet received a financial grant for five years, the first two to be spent in Rome, the third in Germany and the final two in Paris. The only other requirement was the submission each year of an &quot;envoi&quot;, a piece of original work to the satisfaction of the Acad&lt;U+00E9&gt;mie. Before his departure for Rome in December 1857, Bizet's prize cantata was performed at the Acad&lt;U+00E9&gt;mie to an enthusiastic reception.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a><a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="rome-1858u201360">Rome, 1858&lt;U+2013&gt;60</h3>
<p><img src="Villa_Medicis.jpg" title="fig:The Villa Medici, the official home of the French Acad&lt;U+00E9&gt;mie in Rome since 1803" alt="The Villa Medici, the official home of the French Acad&lt;U+00E9&gt;mie in Rome since 1803" /> On 27 January 1858 Bizet arrived at the <a href="Villa_Medici" title="wikilink">Villa Medici</a>, a 16th-century palace that since 1803 had housed the French Acad&lt;U+00E9&gt;mie in Rome and which he described in a letter home as &quot;paradise&quot;.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> Under its director, the painter <a href="Jean-Victor_Schnetz" title="wikilink">Jean-Victor Schnetz</a>, the villa provided an ideal environment in which Bizet and his fellow-laureates could pursue their artistic endeavours. Bizet relished the convivial atmosphere, and quickly involved himself in the distractions of its social life; in his first six months in Rome his only composition was a <em><a href="Te_Deum" title="wikilink">Te Deum</a></em> written for the Rodrigues Prize, a competition for a new religious work open to Prix de Rome winners. This piece failed to impress the judges, who awarded the prize to Adrien Barthe, the only other entrant.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> Bizet was discouraged to the extent that he vowed to write no more religious music. His <em>Te Deum</em> remained forgotten and unpublished until 1971.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a></p>
<p>Through the winter of 1858&lt;U+2013&gt;59 Bizet worked on his first envoi, an <a href="opera_buffa" title="wikilink">opera buffa</a> setting of Carlo Cambiaggio's libretto <em><a href="Don_Procopio" title="wikilink">Don Procopio</a></em>. Under the terms of his prize, Bizet's first envoi was supposed to be a mass, but following his <em>Te Deum</em> experience he was averse to writing religious music. He was apprehensive about how this breach of the rules would be received at the Acad&lt;U+00E9&gt;mie, but their response to <em>Don Procopio</em> was initially positive, with praise for the composer's &quot;easy and brilliant touch&quot; and &quot;youthful and bold style.&quot;<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a><a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> <img src="Young_Georges_Bizet.png" title="fig:Georges Bizet photographed in about 1860" alt="Georges Bizet photographed in about 1860" /> For his second envoi, not wishing to test the Acad&lt;U+00E9&gt;mie's tolerance too far, Bizet proposed to submit a quasi-religious work in the form of a secular mass on a text by <a href="Horace" class="uri" title="wikilink">Horace</a>. This work, entitled <em>Carmen Saeculare</em>, was intended as a song to <a href="Apollo" class="uri" title="wikilink">Apollo</a> and <a href="Diana_(mythology)" title="wikilink">Diana</a>. No trace exists, and it is unlikely that Bizet ever started it.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> A tendency to conceive ambitious projects, only to quickly abandon them, became a feature of Bizet's Rome years; in addition to <em>Carmen Saeculare</em> he considered and discarded at least five opera projects, two attempts at a symphony, and a symphonic ode on the theme of <a href="Odysseus#Journey_home_to_Ithaca" title="wikilink">Ulysses and Circe</a>.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> After <em>Don Procopio</em> Bizet completed only one further work in Rome, the symphonic poem <em>Vasco da Gama</em>. This replaced <em>Carmen Saeculare</em> as his second envoi, and was well received by the Acad&lt;U+00E9&gt;mie, though swiftly forgotten thereafter.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a></p>
<p>In the summer of 1859 Bizet and several companions travelled in the mountains and forests around <a href="Anagni" class="uri" title="wikilink">Anagni</a> and <a href="Frosinone" class="uri" title="wikilink">Frosinone</a>. They also visited a convict settlement at <a href="Anzio" class="uri" title="wikilink">Anzio</a>; Bizet sent an enthusiastic letter to Marmontel, recounting his experiences.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> In August he made an extended journey south to <a href="Naples" class="uri" title="wikilink">Naples</a> and <a href="Pompeii" class="uri" title="wikilink">Pompeii</a>, where he was unimpressed with the former but delighted with the latter: &quot;Here you live with the ancients; you see their temples, their theatres, their houses in which you find their furniture, their kitchen utensils...&quot;<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> Bizet began sketching a symphony based on his Italian experiences, but made little immediate headway; the project, which became his <a href="Roma_Symphony_(Bizet)" title="wikilink"><em>Roma</em> symphony</a>, was not finished until 1868.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> On his return to Rome Bizet successfully requested permission to extend his stay in Italy into a third year, rather than going to Germany, so that he could complete &quot;an important work&quot; (which has not been identified).<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> In September 1860, while visiting <a href="Venice" class="uri" title="wikilink">Venice</a> with his friend and fellow-laureate <a href="Ernest_Guiraud" title="wikilink">Ernest Guiraud</a>, Bizet received news that his mother was gravely ill in Paris, and made his way home.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a></p>

<p>Bizet's fourth and final envoi, which occupied him for much of 1862, was a one-act opera, <em>La guzla de l'&lt;U+00E9&gt;mir</em>. As a state-subsidised theatre, the Op&lt;U+00E9&gt;ra-Comique was obliged from time to time to stage the works of Prix de Rome laureates, and <em>La guzla</em> duly went into rehearsal in 1863. However, in April Bizet received an offer, which originated from <a href="Count_Alexandre_Joseph_Colonna-Walewski" title="wikilink">Count Walewski</a>, to write a three-act opera, <em><a href="Les_p&lt;U+00EA&gt;cheurs_de_perles" title="wikilink">Les p&lt;U+00EA&gt;cheurs de perles</a></em>, using a libretto by Michel Carr&lt;U+00E9&gt; and <a href="Eug&lt;U+00E8&gt;ne_Cormon" title="wikilink">Eug&lt;U+00E8&gt;ne Cormon</a>. Because a condition of the offer was that the opera should be the composer's first publicly staged work, Bizet hurriedly withdrew <em>La guzla</em> from production and incorporated parts of its music into the new opera.<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a> The first performance of <em>Les p&lt;U+00EA&gt;cheurs de perles</em>, by the Th&lt;U+00E9&gt;&lt;U+00E2&gt;tre Lyrique company, was on 30 September.

<h2 id="music">Music</h2>

<h3 id="early-works">Early works</h3>
<p>Bizet's earliest compositions, chiefly songs and keyboard pieces written as exercises, give early indications of his emergent power and his gifts as a melodist.<a href="#fn150" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref150"><sup>150</sup></a> Dean sees evidence in the piano work <em>Romance sans parole</em>, written before 1854, of &quot;the conjunction of melody, rhythm and accompaniment&quot; that is characteristic of Bizet's mature works.<a href="#fn151" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref151"><sup>151</sup></a> Bizet's first orchestral piece was an overture written in 1855 in the manner of Rossini's <em><a href="William_Tell_(opera)" title="wikilink">Guillaume Tell</a></em>. Critics have found it unremarkable, but the <a href="Symphony_in_C_(Bizet)" title="wikilink">Symphony in C</a> of the same year has been warmly praised by later commentators who have made favourable comparisons with Mozart and Schubert.<a href="#fn152" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref152"><sup>152</sup></a> In Dean's view the symphony has &quot;few rivals and perhaps no superior in the work of any composer of such youth&quot;.<a href="#fn153" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref153"><sup>153</sup></a> The critic <a href="Ernest_Newman" title="wikilink">Ernest Newman</a> suggests that Bizet may at this time thought that his future lay in the field of instrumental music, before an &quot;inner voice&quot; (and the realities of the French musical world) turned him towards the stage.<a href="#fn154" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref154"><sup>154</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="orchestral-piano-and-vocal-works">Orchestral, piano and vocal works</h3>
<p>After his early Symphony in C, Bizet's purely orchestral output is sparse. The <em>Roma</em> symphony over which he laboured for more than eight years compares poorly, in Dean's view, with its juvenile predecessor. The work, says Dean, owes something to Gounod, and contains passages that recall <a href="Carl_Maria_von_Weber" title="wikilink">Weber</a> and <a href="Felix_Mendelssohn" title="wikilink">Mendelssohn</a>. However, Dean contends that the work suffers from poor organisation and an excess of pretentious music; he calls it a &quot;misfire&quot;. Bizet's other mature orchestral work, the overture <em>Patrie</em>, is similarly dismissed: &quot;an awful warning of the danger of confusing art with patriotism&quot;.<a href="#fn155" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref155"><sup>155</sup></a> The musicologist <a href="Hugh_Macdonald" title="wikilink">Hugh Macdonald</a> argues that Bizet's best orchestral music is found in the suites that he derived respectively from the piano work <em>Jeux d'enfants</em> and the incidental music for <em>L'Arl&lt;U+00E9&gt;sienne</em>. In these he demonstrates a maturity of style that, had he lived longer, might have been the basis for future great orchestral works.<a href="#fn156" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref156"><sup>156</sup></a></p>
<p>Bizet's piano works have not entered the concert pianist's repertoire, and are generally too difficult for amateurs to attempt. An exception is the set of 12 pieces evoking the world of children's games, <em>Jeux d'enfants</em>, written for four hands. Here, Bizet avoided the virtuoso passages which tend to dominate his solo works.<a href="#fn157" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref157"><sup>157</sup></a> The earlier solo pieces bear the influence of Chopin; later works, such as the <em>Variations Chromatiques</em> and the <em>Chasse Fantastique</em>, owe more to Liszt.<a href="#fn158" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref158"><sup>158</sup></a> Most of Bizet's songs were written in the period 1866&lt;U+2013&gt;68. Dean defines the main weaknesses in these songs as an unimaginative repetition of the same music for each verse, and a tendency to write for the orchestra rather than the voice.<a href="#fn159" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref159"><sup>159</sup></a> Much of Bizet's larger-scale vocal music is lost; the early <em>Te Deum</em>, which survives in full, is rejected by Dean as &quot;a wretched work [that] merely illustrates Bizet's unfitness to write religious music.&quot;<a href="#fn160" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref160"><sup>160</sup></a></p>

Caruso is centre in the upper row, Farrar top left and bottom right." /> Bizet's early one-act opera <em>Le docteur Miracle</em> provides the first clear signs of his promise in this genre, its sparkling music including, according to Dean, &quot;many happy touches of parody, scoring and comic characterisation&quot;.<a href="#fn161" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref161"><sup>161</sup></a> Newman perceives evidence of Bizet's later achievements in many of his earliest works: &quot;[A]gain and again we light upon some touch or other in them that only a musician with a dramatic root of the matter in him could have achieved.&quot;<a href="#fn162" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref162"><sup>162</sup></a> Until <em>Carmen</em>, however, Bizet was not essentially an innovator in the musical theatre. He wrote most of his operas in the traditions of Italian and French opera established by such as <a href="Gaetano_Donizetti" title="wikilink">Donizetti</a>, Rossini, Berlioz, Gounod and Thomas. Macdonald suggests that, technically, he surpassed all of these, with a feeling for the human voice that compares with that of Mozart.<a href="#fn163" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref163"><sup>163</sup></a></p>
<p>In <em>Don Procopio</em> Bizet followed the stock devices of Italian opera as typified by Donizetti in <em><a href="Don_Pasquale" title="wikilink">Don Pasquale</a></em>, a work which it closely resembles. However, the familiar idiom is interspersed with original touches in which Bizet's fingerprints emerge unmistakably.<a href="#fn164" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref164"><sup>164</sup></a><a href="#fn165" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref165"><sup>165</sup></a> In his first significant opera, <em>Les p&lt;U+00EA&gt;cheurs de perles</em>, Bizet was hampered by a dull libretto and a laborious plot; nevertheless, the music in Dean's view rises at times &quot;far above the level of contemporary French opera&quot;.<a href="#fn166" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref166"><sup>166</sup></a> Its many original flourishes include the introduction to the <a href="cavatina" class="uri" title="wikilink">cavatina</a>'' Comme autrefois dans la nuit sombre'' played by two <a href="French_horns" title="wikilink">French horns</a> over a cello background, an effect which in the words of analyst Herv&lt;U+00E9&gt; Lacombe, &quot;resonates in the memory like a fanfare lost in a distant forest&quot;.<a href="#fn167" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref167"><sup>167</sup></a> While the music of <em>Les p&lt;U+00EA&gt;cheurs</em> is atmospheric and deeply evocative of the opera's Eastern setting, in <em>La jolie fille de Perth</em> Bizet made no attempt to introduce Scottish colour or mood,<a href="#fn168" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref168"><sup>168</sup></a> though the scoring includes highly imaginative touches such as a separate band of woodwind and strings during the opera's Act III seduction scene.<a href="#fn169" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref169"><sup>169</sup></a></p>
<p>From Bizet's unfinished works, Macdonald highlights <em>La coupe du roi de Thul&lt;U+00E9&gt;</em> as giving clear signs of the power that would reach a pinnacle in <em>Carmen</em>, and suggests that had <em>Clarissa Harlowe</em> and <em>Gris&lt;U+00E9&gt;lidis</em> been completed, Bizet's legacy would have been &quot;infinitely richer&quot;.<a href="#fn170" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref170"><sup>170</sup></a> As Bizet moved away from the accepted musical conventions of French opera he encountered critical hostility. In the case of <em>Djamileh</em>, the accusation of &quot;Wagnerism&quot; was raised again,<a href="#fn171" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref171"><sup>171</sup></a> as audiences struggled to understand the score's originality; many found the music pretentious and monotonous, lacking in both rhythm and melody.<a href="#fn172" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref172"><sup>172</sup></a> By contrast, modern critical opinion as expressed by Macdonald is that <em>Djamileh</em> is &quot;a truly enchanting piece, full of inventive touches, especially of chromatic colour.&quot;<a href="#fn173" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref173"><sup>173</sup></a></p>

<p>After Bizet's death many of his manuscripts were lost; works were revised by other hands, and published in these unauthorised versions so that it is often difficult to establish what is authentic Bizet.<a href="#fn180" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref180"><sup>180</sup></a> Even <em>Carmen</em> was altered into <a href="grand_opera" title="wikilink">grand opera</a> format by the replacement of its dialogue with recitatives written by Guiraud, and by other amendments to the score.<a href="#fn181" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref181"><sup>181</sup></a> The music world did not immediately acknowledge Bizet as a master and, apart from <em>Carmen</em> and the <em>L'Arl&lt;U+00E9&gt;sienne</em> suite, few of his works were performed in the years immediately following his death.<a href="#fn182" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref182"><sup>182</sup></a> However, the 20th century saw an increase of interest. <em>Don Procopio</em> was revived in <a href="Monte_Carlo" title="wikilink">Monte Carlo</a> in 1906;<a href="#fn183" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref183"><sup>183</sup></a> An Italian version of <em>Les p&lt;U+00EA&gt;cheurs de perles</em> was performed at the <a href="Metropolitan_Opera" title="wikilink">Metropolitan Opera</a> in New York on 13 November 1916, with <a href="Enrico_Caruso" title="wikilink">Caruso</a> in the leading tenor role;<a href="#fn184" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref184"><sup>184</sup></a> it has since become a staple at many opera houses.<a href="#fn185" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref185"><sup>185</sup></a> After its first performance in Switzerland in 1935, the Symphony in C entered the concert repertory, and has been recorded by, among many others, <a href="Sir_Thomas_Beecham" title="wikilink">Sir Thomas Beecham</a>.<a href="#fn186" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref186"><sup>186</sup></a><a href="#fn187" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref187"><sup>187</sup></a> Excerpts from <em>La coupe du roi de Thul&lt;U+00E9&gt;</em>, edited by Winton Dean, were broadcast by the <a href="BBC" class="uri" title="wikilink">BBC</a> on 12 July 1955,<a href="#fn188" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref188"><sup>188</sup></a> and <em>Le docteur Miracle</em> was revived in London on 8 December 1957 by the Park Lane Group.<a href="#fn189" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref189"><sup>189</sup></a> Items from <em>Vasco da Gama</em> and <em>Ivan IV</em> have been recorded, as have numerous songs and the complete piano music.{{#tag:ref|Numerous recordings of these works are available.<a href="#fn190" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref190"><sup>190</sup></a><a href="#fn191" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref191"><sup>191</sup></a><a href="#fn192" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref192"><sup>192</sup></a>|group= n}} <em>Carmen</em>, after its lukewarm initial Paris run of 45 performances, became a worldwide popular success after performances in Vienna (1875) and London (1878).<a href="#fn193" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref193"><sup>193</sup></a> It has been hailed as the first opera of the <a href="verismo" class="uri" title="wikilink">verismo</a> school, in which sordid and brutal subjects are emphasised, with art reflecting life&lt;U+2014&gt;&quot;not idealised life but life as actually lived.&quot;<a href="#fn194" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref194"><sup>194</sup></a><a href="#fn195" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref195"><sup>195</sup></a></p>

<p>Of Bizet's family circle, his father Adolphe died in 1886. Bizet's son Jacques committed suicide in 1922 after an unhappy love affair. Jean Reiter, Bizet's elder son, had a successful career as press director of <em><a href="Le_Temps_(Paris)" title="wikilink">Le Temps</a></em>, became an Officer of the Legion of Honour, and died in 1939 at the age of 77. In 1886 Genevi&lt;U+00E8&gt;ve married &lt;U+00C9&gt;mile Straus, a rich lawyer; she became a famous Parisian society hostess and a close friend of, among others, <a href="Marcel_Proust" title="wikilink">Marcel Proust</a>. She showed little interest in her first husband's musical legacy, made no effort to catalogue Bizet's manuscripts and gave many away as souvenirs. She died in 1926; in her will she established a fund for a Georges Bizet prize, to be awarded annually to a composer under 40 who had &quot;produced a remarkable work within the previous five years&quot;. Winners of the prize include <a href="Tony_Aubin" title="wikilink">Tony Aubin</a>, <a href="Jean-Michel_Damase" title="wikilink">Jean-Michel Damase</a>, <a href="Henri_Dutilleux" title="wikilink">Henri Dutilleux</a> and <a href="Jean_Martinon" title="wikilink">Jean Martinon</a>.<a href="#fn201" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref201"><sup>201</sup></a><a href="#fn202" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref202"><sup>202</sup></a></p>
