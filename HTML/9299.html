The electorate is named after the <a href="Tamaki_River" title="wikilink">Tamaki River</a> that runs immediately east of the seat. The electorate is represented by <a href="Simon_O&#39;Connor" title="wikilink">Simon O'Connor</a>, who became the <a href="New_Zealand_National_Party" title="wikilink">National Party</a> candidate after <a href="Allan_Peachey" title="wikilink">Allan Peachey</a> withdrew from the <a href="New_Zealand_general_election,_2011" title="wikilink">2011 election</a> for health reasons; Peachey died before the election.</p>
<h2 id="population-centres">Population centres</h2>
<p>The 1941 <a href="New_Zealand_Census_of_Population_and_Dwellings" title="wikilink">census</a> had been postponed due to World War II, so the 1946 electoral redistribution had to take ten years of population growth and movements into account. The <a href="North_Island" title="wikilink">North Island</a> gained a further two electorates from the <a href="South_Island" title="wikilink">South Island</a> due to faster population growth. The abolition of the <a href="country_quota" title="wikilink">country quota</a> through the <em>Electoral Amendment Act, 1945</em> reduced the number and increased the size of rural electorates. None of the existing electorates remained unchanged, 27 electorates were abolished, eight former electorates were re-established, and 19 electorates were created for the first time, including Tamaki.</p>
<p>T&lt;U+0101&gt;maki is based around <a href="Auckland_City" title="wikilink">Auckland City</a>'s wealthy eastern beaches, <a href="Mission_Bay,_New_Zealand" title="wikilink">Mission Bay</a>, <a href="Meadowbank,_New_Zealand" title="wikilink">Meadowbank</a>, <a href="Saint_Heliers,_New_Zealand" title="wikilink">Saint Heliers</a>, <a href="Kohimarama" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kohimarama</a> and <a href="Glendowie,_New_Zealand" title="wikilink">Glendowie</a>; it also contains the working-class suburb of <a href="Glen_Innes,_New_Zealand" title="wikilink">Glen Innes</a> on its southern fringe. T&lt;U+0101&gt;maki is the home of a selection of New Zealand's emblematic historical moments: <a href="Ngati_Whatua" title="wikilink">Ng&lt;U+0101&gt;ti Whatua</a> activism at <a href="Bastion_Point" title="wikilink">Bastion Point</a> (sparking a chain of events leading to the modern <a href="Treaty_of_Waitangi" title="wikilink">Treaty of Waitangi grievance settlement process</a>) occurred inside the seat's boundaries, a seat at the time represented by the contentious <a href="Robert_Muldoon" title="wikilink">Robert Muldoon</a>, the Prime Minister responsible for the Crown's response to the occupation of Bastion Point. Among other Ng&lt;U+0101&gt;ti Whatua land taken through governmental application of public works legislation is Paratai Drive, once New Zealand's most expensive street. The area around Mission Bay is also home to the Savage Memorial, a huge site dedicated to the memory of former Labour <a href="Michael_Joseph_Savage" title="wikilink">Michael Joseph Savage</a>, architect of the welfare state in New Zealand.</p>
<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<p>The <a href="New_Zealand_National_Party" title="wikilink">National Party</a> has held T&lt;U+0101&gt;maki in all its various incarnations since <a href="New_Zealand_general_election,_1960" title="wikilink">1960</a>, when future Prime Minister <a href="Robert_Muldoon" title="wikilink">Robert Muldoon</a> (later Sir Robert) began his parliamentary career by ousting long-time Labour stalwart <a href="Bob_Tizard" title="wikilink">Bob Tizard</a>, and staying firmly in place until his self-selected departure at the end of 1991. Muldoon's departure caused a <a href="Tamaki_by-election,_1992" title="wikilink">by-election in 1992</a>, where candidate <a href="Clem_Simich" title="wikilink">Clem Simich</a> won despite fierce competition in an environment where both major parties were out of favour with the electorate. Simich gave up his seat ahead of the <a href="New_Zealand_general_election,_2005" title="wikilink">2005 election</a> to high school principal Allan Peachey. Simich was returned to parliament from his party's list, having chosen to move from standing for one of his party's safest seats to instead contest <a href="M&lt;U+0101&gt;ngere_(New_Zealand_electorate)" title="wikilink">M&lt;U+0101&gt;ngere</a>, easily Labour's safest seat. Since 2005, T&lt;U+0101&gt;maki was represented by Allan Peachey, who announced his retirement at the end of the parliamentary term in 2011 for health reasons. <a href="Simon_O&#39;Connor" title="wikilink">Simon O'Connor</a> was chosen by the National Party to contest the electorate in the <a href="New_Zealand_general_election,_2011" title="wikilink">2011 general election</a>.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
