<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<p>The church originated in the 13th century. During the next century the north <a href="aisle" class="uri" title="wikilink">aisle</a>, the <a href="vestry" class="uri" title="wikilink">vestry</a> and the <a href="clerestory" class="uri" title="wikilink">clerestory</a> were added. In the 15th century the tower, porch and chapel were built. The chapel was a <a href="chantry" class="uri" title="wikilink">chantry</a> chapel founded by the Chambre family and dates from 1488&lt;U+2013&gt;89. In 1863 the <a href="chancel" class="uri" title="wikilink">chancel</a> was <a href="Victorian_restoration" title="wikilink">restored</a>, followed by the rest of the church in 1893. By this time the parish of All Saints had been united with that of St Peter's, Aldwincle, and All Saints subsequently became disused.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> It was declared redundant in 1976, and has been made into an architectural museum.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>

The tower is in four stages with <a href="buttress" title="wikilink">buttresses</a> at the corners. The stages are divided by <a href="Course_(architecture)#String_course" title="wikilink">string courses</a> carved with a variety of images. In the lowest stage is a west doorway. Above this, in the second stage and extending into the third stage, is a three-light window. Over this, in the third stage, is a small <a href="niche_(architecture)" title="wikilink">niche</a>. The top stage is the largest, and is almost completely filled by bell openings on each side. These are square-headed and double, each side containing two lights.
