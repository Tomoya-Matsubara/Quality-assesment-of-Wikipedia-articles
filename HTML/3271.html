<h3 id="may-4-2005">May 4, 2005</h3>
<p>Disneyland Park was actually closed to the public on this date, the first planned closure of the park in decades for a special media preview. Disney allowed guests staying at the three Disney owned hotels to become &quot;extras&quot; for the all the media filming going on, though they only were notified by a letter delivered in the middle of the night, so they had no advance notice.</p>
<h3 id="may-5-2005">May 5, 2005</h3>
<p>The Happiest Homecoming on Earth ceremony officially began with a dedication from then-Disney CEO <a href="Michael_Eisner" title="wikilink">Michael Eisner</a>. The ceremony included fireworks; speeches from <a href="Julie_Andrews" title="wikilink">Julie Andrews</a> (official <a href="List_of_Disney_Ambassadors" title="wikilink">ambassador</a> for the 50th anniversary celebrations), and <a href="Art_Linkletter" title="wikilink">Art Linkletter</a> (original TV anchor for the opening day broadcast); a performance of &quot;When You Wish Upon A Star&quot; by <a href="Christina_Aguilera" title="wikilink">Christina Aguilera</a>; and <a href="LeAnn_Rimes" title="wikilink">LeAnn Rimes</a> singing the 50th anniversary theme song &quot;Remember When&quot;, composed by <a href="Richard_Marx" title="wikilink">Richard Marx</a>. A video conference featured celebrities at the <a href="Magic_Kingdom" title="wikilink">Magic Kingdom</a> (the only live video conference, with <a href="Wayne_Brady" title="wikilink">Wayne Brady</a>, actor and former Walt Disney World Resort cast member), <a href="Tokyo_Disneyland" title="wikilink">Tokyo Disneyland</a>, <a href="Disneyland_Paris" title="wikilink">Disneyland Paris</a> and the construction site of <a href="Hong_Kong_Disneyland" title="wikilink">Hong Kong Disneyland</a>.</p>

<h3 id="july-17-2005">July 17, 2005</h3>
<p>The actual day of <a href="Disneyland" class="uri" title="wikilink">Disneyland</a>'s 50th Dedication Day/Press Preview was an event marked by fans' enthusiasm. The first person to enter the park that day was Madison Steigerwald, a 16-year old girl from Old Greenwich, CT. She and her grandmother, Mary Madison, began to line up at 3 p.m. the day before. Due to the thousands of fans that continued to line up through the night, <a href="Disney_California_Adventure_Park" title="wikilink">Disney California Adventure Park</a> was opened and housed everyone until the next morning. A second line formed outside the security checkpoints as thousands more arrived in the final hours before the park opened. <a href="Disneyland_Park_(Anaheim)" title="wikilink">Disneyland Park</a> opened at 7:00 a.m., although it took several hours to admit the crowds that showed up that morning.</p>
<h3 id="preparations">Preparations</h3>
<p>In 2004, Disneyland Resort President Matt Ouimet and hundreds of cast members posed for an aerial photo above Disneyland, with each person holding a nine square foot photograph of a Disneyland cast member. When seen from above the placards formed an image of <a href="Mickey_Mouse" title="wikilink">Mickey Mouse</a>, making it the largest photographic mosaic ever created. This initiated the <a href="Happiest_Faces_on_Earth" title="wikilink">Happiest Faces on Earth</a> in which over thirty giant mosaics of Disney tableaus were displayed at locations around Disneyland and California Adventure composed of photos submitted by guests from the past fifty years. All the mosaics were created by California artist Roy Feinson.</p>
<p>Many classic Disneyland attractions re-opened in 2005 after lengthy refurbishments, such as <a href="Walt_Disney&#39;s_Enchanted_Tiki_Room" title="wikilink">Walt Disney's Enchanted Tiki Room</a>, the <a href="Jungle_Cruise" title="wikilink">Jungle Cruise</a> and <a href="Space_Mountain_(Disneyland,_Anaheim)" title="wikilink">Space Mountain</a>. A new fireworks show, <em><a href="Remember..._Dreams_Come_True" title="wikilink">Remember... Dreams Come True</a></em>, replaced the former <em>Believe... There's Magic in the Stars</em>. <a href="Walt_Disney&#39;s_Parade_of_Dreams" title="wikilink">Walt Disney's Parade of Dreams</a> replaced the Parade of Stars and featured elaborate floats with lighting that allowed daytime or nighttime performances. <a href="Buzz_Lightyear_(attractions)" title="wikilink">Buzz Lightyear Astro Blasters</a> opened in Tomorrowland (at a ceremony with <a href="Tim_Allen" title="wikilink">Tim Allen</a>, the voice of <a href="Toy_Story" title="wikilink">Toy Story</a> character <a href="Buzz_Lightyear" title="wikilink">Buzz Lightyear</a>), and a new parade featuring <a href="Pixar" class="uri" title="wikilink">Pixar</a> characters, Block Party Bash was featured at <a href="Disney_California_Adventure_Park" title="wikilink">Disney California Adventure Park</a>. Comedian and ex-Disneyland cast member <a href="Steve_Martin" title="wikilink">Steve Martin</a> opened the <em><a href="Disneyland:_The_First_50_Magical_Years" title="wikilink">Disneyland: The First 50 Magical Years</a></em> exhibition and film, in which he features with <a href="Donald_Duck" title="wikilink">Donald Duck</a>. The original attractions which opened with the park also had one of their ride vehicles painted gold for the celebration. The park also contained <a href="Hidden_Mickey_50_Ears" title="wikilink">50 Hidden Mickeys</a>, golden Mickey Mouse heads with &quot;50&quot; displayed in the middle, sometimes disguised as part of the surrounding theme.</p>
<p>Other refurbishments took place around Disneyland with many areas being re-painted and refurbished to their former glory. The second phase of the re-paint of Tomorrowland commenced after the base silver and blue scheme was laid. <a href="Main_Street_USA" title="wikilink">Main Street USA</a> and <a href="Sleeping_Beauty_Castle" title="wikilink">Sleeping Beauty Castle</a> were repainted, and the castle was specially decorated for the celebration. Disneyland has always been known to display an amazing firework show and it didn't let down during the 50th anniversary celebration. The fireworks started what was a shooting between the ride Matterhorn and Splash Mountain. With Tinkerbell coming to the rescue and flying across the park, the celebration ended with what seemed as real snow, coming out of the light posts. It was definitely a beautiful sight to see. The celebration brought record numbers of guests to the parks, numbers unmatched since the fall of 1996, when mass crowds flooded the park to catch a glimpse of the <a href="Main_Street_Electrical_Parade" title="wikilink">Main Street Electrical Parade</a> before it went into permanent retirement.</p>
<h3 id="into-2006">Into 2006</h3>
<p>In the second half of the celebration, in 2006, <a href="Monsters,_Inc.:_Mike_and_Sully_to_the_Rescue" title="wikilink">Monsters, Inc.: Mike and Sully to the Rescue</a> opened at Disney's California Adventure. On July 7, 2006, <em><a href="Pirates_of_the_Caribbean:_Dead_Man&#39;s_Chest" title="wikilink">Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest</a></em> had its world premiere on the <a href="Rivers_of_America_(Disney)" title="wikilink">Rivers of America</a>, as did the first film in the trilogy in 2003. On the same day of <em>Dead Man's Chest</em> premiere, the <a href="Pirates_of_the_Caribbean" title="wikilink">Pirates of the Caribbean</a> attraction officially reopened after lengthy refurbishments to include characters from the movie trilogy in the attraction's storyline. The 50th anniversary celebration at Disneyland ended on September 30, 2006, and was succeeded by the <strong>Year of a Million Dreams</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="theme-song">Theme Song</h2>
<p>To commemorate the 50th Anniversary of Disneyland, the official anthem song was written by <a href="Richard_Marx" title="wikilink">Richard Marx</a>, and was performed for the first time live by <a href="Grammy" class="uri" title="wikilink">Grammy</a> Award winning artist, <a href="LeAnn_Rimes" title="wikilink">LeAnn Rimes</a>. The song reflects on how you can never be too old to enjoy life and childhood dreams you had. The song was played immediately after the &lt;U+201C&gt;<a href="Remember..._Dreams_Come_True" title="wikilink">Remember... Dreams Come True</a>&lt;U+201D&gt; fireworks spectacular presented throughout the 18-month anniversary celebration at Disneyland.</p>
