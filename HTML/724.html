<p><strong>Tilted Thunder Rail Birds</strong> (TTRB) is a <a href="Seattle,_Washington" title="wikilink">Seattle, Washington</a> based, all-female, banked track <a href="roller_derby" title="wikilink">roller derby</a> league. They are a <a href="501(c)3" class="uri" title="wikilink">501(c)3</a> nonprofit organization run by a volunteer force of skaters and league members committed to promoting and raising awareness of women's roller derby, especially banked track roller derby. TTRB is composed of strong, friendly, intelligent, enthusiastic women from all walks of life pursuing emotional growth and physical strength by challenging their perceived limits. As a league, they also wish to promote mental and physical empowerment, development of skills, loyalty on and off the track, individuality, and friendship - throughout the entire sport, both locally and nationally.</p>
<p>The modern reincarnation of community-based, Do-It-Yourself banked track roller derby is only just beginning to experience the kind of growth that flat-track roller derby saw only a few years ago. Not only is TTRB the only modern banked track league in the <a href="Pacific_Northwest" title="wikilink">Pacific Northwest</a>, it is one of only a small handful of modern DIY banked track leagues in the country. Modern, DIY leagues who have already built their banked tracks include: <a href="Los_Angeles_Derby_Dolls" title="wikilink">Los Angeles Derby Dolls</a>, <a href="San_Diego_Derby_Dolls" title="wikilink">San Diego Derby Dolls</a>, <a href="TXRD" class="uri" title="wikilink">TXRD</a> (Austin), Outwest Outlaws Roller Derby (<a href="Oklahoma_City" title="wikilink">Oklahoma City</a>), <a href="Arizona_Derby_Dames" title="wikilink">Arizona Derby Dames</a> (Phoenix), <a href="OC_Roller_Girls" title="wikilink">OC Roller Girls</a> (Orange County, CA), South Side Roller Derby (<a href="Houston,_TX" title="wikilink">Houston, TX</a>), and <a href="Reno" class="uri" title="wikilink">Reno</a> Roller Girls. Even though there are over 400 modern flat-track leagues in the United States, TTRB was only the 7th roller derby league to build a banked track in the nation. Even more unique, TTRB is the only one of these banked-track leagues who is a <a href="501(c)3" class="uri" title="wikilink">501(c)3</a> nonprofit organization!</p>
<p>Tilted Thunder has four home teams, an All Star travel team, and two junior derby programs: Peeps and Chicklets.</p>
