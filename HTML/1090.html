<p>&quot;<strong>Bart Gets Famous</strong>&quot; is the twelfth episode of <em><a href="The_Simpsons" title="wikilink">The Simpsons</a></em>' <a href="The_Simpsons_(season_5)" title="wikilink">fifth season</a>. It originally aired on the <a href="Fox_network" title="wikilink">Fox network</a> in the United States on February 3, 1994. In the episode, <a href="Bart_Simpson" title="wikilink">Bart</a> gets a job as <a href="Krusty_the_Clown" title="wikilink">Krusty the Clown</a>'s production assistant. However, he soon becomes sick of the job and comes close to quitting. One day, Krusty runs up and says he needs to use Bart in a sketch. Bart becomes an accidental star when he says, &quot;I didn't do it&quot; during the botched sketch. He becomes famous for his <a href="catchphrase" class="uri" title="wikilink">catchphrase</a> but soon becomes tired of being known for one line.</p>
<p>The episode was written by <a href="John_Swartzwelder" title="wikilink">John Swartzwelder</a> and was the first episode of the series to be directed by <a href="Susie_Dietter" title="wikilink">Susie Dietter</a>. Many characters from the show have catchphrases, and the episode mocks the use of catchphrase-based humor. The writers chose the phrase &quot;I didn't do it&quot; because they wanted a &quot;lousy&quot; phrase &quot;to point out how really crummy things can become really popular&quot;.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> <a href="Conan_O&#39;Brien" title="wikilink">Conan O'Brien</a>, a writer for <em>The Simpsons</em> during the fourth and early part of the fifth season, guest stars as himself. The writers decided to include him in the episode after he received an audition to replace <a href="David_Letterman" title="wikilink">David Letterman</a> as the host of <em><a href="Late_Night_with_Conan_O&#39;Brien" title="wikilink">Late Night</a></em>. In its original broadcast, &quot;Bart Gets Famous&quot; finished 40th in ratings with a <a href="Nielsen_ratings" title="wikilink">Nielsen rating</a> of 11.7, and was viewed in 10.74 million households.</p>
<h2 id="plot">Plot</h2>
<p><a href="Bart_Simpson" title="wikilink">Bart</a> goes on a dull class field trip to a box factory. He gets bored with the tour and escapes from the class to go to the Channel 6 TV studio nearby, where he encounters <a href="Krusty_the_Clown" title="wikilink">Krusty the Clown</a>. Krusty is angry that a stage hand has failed to get him a <a href="Danish_pastry" title="wikilink">Danish</a> (Bart having eaten it). Because of this, Bart steals a Danish from <a href="Kent_Brockman" title="wikilink">Kent Brockman</a> and gives it to Krusty who becomes grateful and asks him to become his assistant. Bart soon gets disillusioned with being Krusty's assistant because the cast members do not treat him well and he does not receive any credit for his work. However, before Bart decides to quit, Krusty offers to let him say one line in a sketch when <a href="Sideshow_Mel" title="wikilink">Sideshow Mel</a> is unavailable. Bart messes up his lines and stumbles, accidentally destroying all of the props on the stage. With the crowd and cameras focused on him, he exclaims &quot;I didn't do it&quot;, which causes the audience to laugh and applaud. Seeing this, Krusty immediately uses Bart and his &quot;I didn't do it&quot; catch phrase in later sketches, and eventually creates a franchise out of it.</p>
<p>Bart and his catchphrase continue to be popular, while Krusty creates a wide array of merchandise featuring Bart's likeness. Bart becomes sick of his fame and begins to fear that the fad will wear off, so he tries to expand his act and personality during an interview on <a href="Conan_O&#39;Brien" title="wikilink">Conan O'Brien</a>'s <a href="Late_Night_with_Conan_O&#39;Brien" title="wikilink">late-night talk show</a>, to no avail. Bart decides to stop performing, but <a href="Marge_Simpson" title="wikilink">Marge</a> convinces him that he should continue because he makes people happy. Bart arrives at Krusty's show and enthusiastically delivers his line, but the audience is bored with the line and does not react. With fans no longer interested in Bart, Krusty ditches him.</p>
<p>Marge gives Bart a box of items she kept during his stint as a celebrity to help him remember the event. <a href="Lisa_Simpson" title="wikilink">Lisa</a> says that she is glad that &quot;Bart can go back to just being himself, instead of a one-dimensional character with a silly catchphrase.&quot;</p>

The episode mocks the use of catchphrase-based humor.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> Many characters from <em>The Simpsons</em> have catchphrases, including Homer (&quot;<a href="D&#39;oh!" class="uri" title="wikilink">D'oh!</a>&quot;), Bart (&quot;Eat My Shorts&quot;, &quot;<a href="&lt;U+00A1&gt;Ay,_caramba!" title="wikilink">&lt;U+00A1&gt;Ay, caramba!</a>&quot; and &quot;<a href="Don&#39;t_have_a_cow" title="wikilink">Don't have a cow</a>, man!&quot;), Marge (her worried &quot;hmmmm&quot;) and Maggie (her pacifier suck).<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> The writers chose the phrase &quot;I didn't do it&quot; because they wanted a &quot;lousy&quot; phrase &quot;to point out how really crummy things can become really popular&quot;.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> It was also an intentional call back to the first season episode &quot;<a href="Krusty_Gets_Busted" title="wikilink">Krusty Gets Busted</a>&quot; where it was a catchphrase of <a href="Krusty_the_Clown" title="wikilink">Krusty the Clown</a>.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> The episode ends with a self-referential scene in which several characters say their catchphrases, including the Simpsons, <a href="Ned_Flanders" title="wikilink">Ned Flanders</a>, <a href="Nelson_Muntz" title="wikilink">Nelson Muntz</a>, <a href="Montgomery_Burns" title="wikilink">Mr. Burns</a> and <a href="Barney_Gumble" title="wikilink">Barney Gumble</a>. All of the characters gather around Lisa and stare at her with an anticipating look, and Lisa, displeased, finishes the episode by muttering &quot;If anyone wants me I'll be in my room&quot;, to which Homer says &quot;what kind of a catchphrase is that?&quot;</p>
<p>In the episode, Bart appears on the talk show <em><a href="Late_Night_with_Conan_O&#39;Brien" title="wikilink">Late Night with Conan O'Brien</a></em>. <a href="Conan_O&#39;Brien" title="wikilink">Conan O'Brien</a> was a writer for <em>The Simpsons</em> during the fourth and early part of the fifth seasons. During the production of the episode, he received an audition to replace <a href="David_Letterman" title="wikilink">David Letterman</a> as the host of <em>Late Night</em>. The writers decided that since the episode featured Bart getting famous, it would give them an opportunity to work in O'Brien's show. The part was written just after O'Brien's audition for <em>Late Night</em>, but before he knew he was going to be the host.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> O'Brien recorded his part shortly after <em>Late Night with Conan O'Brien</em> premiered, but he believed it would be canceled by the time the episode aired.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> He described being a guest star on the show as &quot;really delightful&quot;, adding that &quot;it's like being frozen in <a href="amber" class="uri" title="wikilink">amber</a>. I know people will be watching <em>The Simpsons</em> long after I'm dead.&quot;<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>

Bird wanted the design to be more lively but Dietter wanted it to be more boring to go with the story. Dietter's design was used in the finished episode.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> The box factory manager's voice, performed by <a href="Dan_Castellaneta" title="wikilink">Dan Castellaneta</a>, was based on Wally Ballou, a character portrayed by <a href="Bob_Elliott_(comedian)" title="wikilink">Bob Elliott</a> of the comedy duo <a href="Bob_and_Ray" title="wikilink">Bob and Ray</a>.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> <a href="Mayor_Quimby" title="wikilink">Mayor Quimby</a>'s wife <a href="List_of_recurring_characters_in_The_Simpsons#Martha_Quimby" title="wikilink">Martha</a> makes her first appearance in this episode.

<h2 id="reception">Reception</h2>
<p>In its original broadcast, &quot;Bart Gets Famous&quot; aired during the week of January 31-February 6, 1994, the first week of February sweeps.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> It finished 40th in ratings with a <a href="Nielsen_ratings" title="wikilink">Nielsen rating</a> of 11.7, and was viewed in 10.74 million households.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> It was the highest rated show on Fox that week.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
<p>The authors of the book <em>I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide</em>, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, wrote, &quot;even without that final sequence, this would still be one of the best episodes, with Bart at his very best. The scenes in the box factory are superb, as is <a href="Martin_Prince" title="wikilink">Martin</a> and <a href="Seymour_Skinner" title="wikilink">Skinner</a>'s joyful singing and, once again, <a href="Edna_Krabappel" title="wikilink">Edna</a> and Bart's enforced team-up.&quot;<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson wrote &quot;lots of great moments pop up in this excellent program. Bart&lt;U+2019&gt;s rise to fame sparkles via its deft parody of instant - and fleeting - fame, and many wacky bits show up along the way such as Homer&lt;U+2019&gt;s fear that Bart got turned into a box. [...] This might be Season Five&lt;U+2019&gt;s best show.&quot;<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> Patrick Bromley of DVD Verdict gave the episode a grade of A-<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> and Bill Gibron of <a href="DVD_Talk" title="wikilink">DVD Talk</a> gave the episode a score of 4 out of 5.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a></p>
