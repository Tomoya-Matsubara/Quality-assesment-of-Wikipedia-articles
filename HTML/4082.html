<p><strong><a href="Siemens_AG" title="wikilink">Siemens</a> C651 Cars</strong> form a type of <a href="rolling_stock" title="wikilink">rolling stock</a> that can be found on <a href="Singapore" title="wikilink">Singapore's</a> present <a href="Mass_Rapid_Transit_(Singapore)" title="wikilink">Mass Rapid Transit</a> system, which consists of the <a href="North_South_MRT_Line" title="wikilink">North South Line</a>, <a href="East_West_MRT_Line" title="wikilink">East West Line</a>, and <a href="North_East_MRT_Line" title="wikilink">North East MRT Line</a>. The North South Line and the East West line are both run by the same operator, <a href="SMRT" class="uri" title="wikilink">SMRT</a>. Both lines utilise the same signalling and track system, and trains along these lines are interchangeable, whereas the North East Line, is operated by <a href="SBS_Transit" title="wikilink">SBS Transit</a> and uses a completely different fully automated system.</p>
<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>The SMRT fleet currently consists of three kinds of <a href="rolling_stock" title="wikilink">rolling stock</a>, which are able to run on both the EWL and the NSL. Operating on the <a href="North_South_MRT_Line" title="wikilink">North South Line</a> and the <a href="East_West_MRT_Line" title="wikilink">East West Line</a> since the mid 1990s, the Siemens C651 trains are the second generation of train cars used on the SMRT network. They were bought mainly to complement the existing <a href="Kawasaki_Heavy_Industries_C151_Cars" title="wikilink">Kawasaki C151</a> trains due to the opening of the Woodlands extension.</p>
<p>These cars come with green-blue tinted glass windows. They look almost identical to the first generation train cars except that they make a very different sound when accelerating/braking. Although the volume of sound generated, in <a href="decibel" title="wikilink">decibels</a>, is louder than the Kawasaki C151 trains, it is of a lower pitch and more soothing to the ears. The train doors also make a different sound when they open or close due to the different types of systems used. The run number display on the front of each train is made up of electronic green <a href="flip-disc_display" title="wikilink">flip-dot</a> display, as opposed to the manual plastic rollers of the Kawasaki C151 trains, while the rubber strips between the doors are thicker. The trains have the same colour layout as their C151 counterparts, though of a slightly different shade. Cool white lighting, as opposed to warm white, has been used in this model. 19 trainsets of 6 cars each were purchased. The car numbers of the trains range from x201 to x238, where x depends on the carriage type. Similar to the Kawasaki Heavy Industries C151 trains, the Siemens C651 trains have no visual passenger information systems, but have a built-in audio announcement system that announces safety messages, which station the train is at, which station is next, messages for other events etc.</p>
<p>As the C151 trains are undergoing refurbishment, the C651 trains themselves are due to undergo the same procedure by <a href="2010" class="uri" title="wikilink">2010</a>.</p>
<h2 id="experimental-programs">Experimental Programs</h2>
<p>Some trains of this type were reconfigured to have more standing space and more grab poles in the late 1990s as part of an experimental programme. In particular, the second and fifth cars (the blue cars) were reconfigured to have more standing room at the door sides, after it was found that standing passengers liked to stand at the sides of the doors. The reconfigured layout allowed two passengers to stand in the same space, although this space was &quot;shrunk&quot; to one passenger only in the layout of later trains.</p>
<p>The third and fourth cars, coloured in green were even more radical in the reconfiguration, with all but eight seats, four at each ends of the car removed completely. In its place was standing room with upholstered cushion, in an attempt to provide a degree of comfort to passengers standing in that space. This design proved to be unpopular with the commuters, and it was eventually dropped. Only carriages 2237 and 2238 are seen to feature these upholstered cushions at the centre of these two cars. The original seats between the 1st and 2nd door, and the 3rd and 4th door on these cars have been replaced. The remaining upholstered seats would be replaced by May 2006.</p>
<h2 id="serial-number">Serial Number</h2>
<p>Individual cars are given a 4 digit serial number by the rail operator SMRT.</p>
<ul>
<li>The first digit depends upon whether the car is the first, second or third car from either end of the train, where the first car equals 3, the second equals 1 &amp; the third equals 2.</li>
<li>The other 3 digits is the train identification number. A full length train of 6 cars have 2 different identification number, one for the first 3 cars, and the same number plus 1, for the other three. The smaller number is always an odd number. For example, a train would consist of 6 cars with serial number 3209, 1209, 2209, 2210, 1210, 3210 respectively.</li>
