<h2 id="plot">Plot</h2>
<p><a href="Homer_Simpson" title="wikilink">Homer</a> gets a magazine loaded with <a href="personality_test" title="wikilink">personality tests</a> and quizzes his friends and family with them. Later on, he takes his own test and reveals that he will only live until 42, which is only three years away. <a href="Necrophobia#Thanatophobia" title="wikilink">Terrified</a> of his supposedly impending death, he develops <a href="insomnia" class="uri" title="wikilink">insomnia</a> and goes <a href="insane" class="uri" title="wikilink">insane</a>. Homer visits the <a href="Springfield_Nuclear_Power_Plant" title="wikilink">power plant</a>'s <a href="psychiatrist" class="uri" title="wikilink">psychiatrist</a>, who suggests that he go on a long vacation. The Simpsons go on a trip to <a href="Florida" class="uri" title="wikilink">Florida</a>, which Homer calls &quot;America's <a href="Penis" title="wikilink">Wang</a>&quot;. When the family arrives there, they find themselves in the middle of a raucous <a href="spring_break" title="wikilink">spring break</a>. <a href="Marge_Simpson" title="wikilink">Marge</a> wants Homer to stay in his hotel room, but he escapes to party and attend a <a href="Kid_Rock" title="wikilink">Kid Rock</a> concert. Homer becomes the life of the Spring Break party — until spring break ends and the wild college kids return to catch up on their studies.</p>
<p>Homer, who still wants to party, rents an airboat and forces the family to come with him. He races through the <a href="swamp" class="uri" title="wikilink">swamp</a>, killing the town's most famous resident and reptile, an <a href="alligator" class="uri" title="wikilink">alligator</a> named Captain Jack, whom Marge, <a href="Maggie_Simpson" title="wikilink">Maggie</a>, <a href="Lisa_Simpson" title="wikilink">Lisa</a> and <a href="Bart_Simpson" title="wikilink">Bart</a> had seen on a tour while Homer made a fool of himself at the concert. Despite the fact that Homer is the sole guilty culprit, the entire family is charged for killing the alligator, but they flee from the sheriff and are hit by an <a href="Amtrak" class="uri" title="wikilink">Amtrak</a> train. They escape to a restaurant and nearby trailer, where they become <a href="hillbilly" title="wikilink">hillbillies</a> and work until the sheriff tracks them down and kidnaps them while sleeping. For their crime (and the fact that Homer addressed the jury at their trial as &quot;drunken hicks&quot;), the family is put into forced labor. One night when they are working, the family encounters the alligator, who is not dead but was rather knocked out. The family is acquitted, but they are banned from returning to Florida. For their next trip (which is planned out on a map of the United States with nearly all of the continental states crossed out), the family plans to go to <a href="North_Dakota" title="wikilink">North Dakota</a>, the only state other than <a href="Arizona" class="uri" title="wikilink">Arizona</a> (which Homer complains &quot;smells funny&quot;) in which they are allowed to vacation.</p>

<h2 id="release">Release</h2>
<p>The episode originally aired on the <a href="Fox_network" title="wikilink">Fox network</a> in the United States on April 30, 2000.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a><a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> On October 7, 2008, it was released on DVD as part of the box set <em>The Simpsons &lt;U+2013&gt; The Complete Eleventh Season</em>. Staff members Mike Scully, George Meyer, Ian Maxtone-Graham, Matt Selman, Julie Thacker, Dan Castellaneta, and Steven Dean Moore, as well as guest star Diedrich Bader, participated in the DVD <a href="audio_commentary" title="wikilink">audio commentary</a> for the episode.

<p>According to <a href="Mike_Scully" title="wikilink">Mike Scully</a>, who was the <a href="show_runner" title="wikilink">show runner</a> of <em>The Simpsons</em> when the episode aired, &quot;Kill the Alligator and Run&quot; is often cited by fans of <em>The Simpsons</em> as one of the worst episodes in the history of the show.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> Annie Alleman of <em><a href="The_Herald_News" title="wikilink">The Herald News</a></em>, on the other hand, named it her eighth favorite <em>Simpsons</em> episode.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> While reviewing the eleventh season of <em>The Simpsons</em>, DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson commented on the episode, writing: &quot;Wow &lt;U+2013&gt; this may be the most jumbled <em>Simpsons</em> to date! The episode seems to suffer from <a href="Attention_deficit_hyperactivity_disorder" title="wikilink">ADD</a> as it can&lt;U+2019&gt;t focus on any topic for very long. It flits from one gag to another with abandon and rarely makes much sense &lt;U+2013&gt; or produces many laughs. Yeah, it has a few amusing moments, but it&lt;U+2019&gt;s too scattershot to succeed.&quot; <a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
