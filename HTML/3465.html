<h2 id="education-legislation">Education Legislation</h2>
<p>One of Tom Petri's top priorities since coming to Congress has been to improve education and student loan and grant programs. As a member of the Education Committee in Congress he has introduced several bills to help students get access to low cost loans.</p>
<p>In 2006 Petri introduced the Student Aid Reward (STAR) Act which encourage colleges and universities to voluntarily participate in the more cost-effective student loan programs and retain $10 billion in savings for increased <a href="Pell_Grant" title="wikilink">Pell Grant</a> aid for their students. <a href="http://peacecorpsonline.org/messages/messages/467/2093057.html">3</a> The legislation could boost Pell Grants by up to $800 per student while also devoting over $3 billion of the savings towards deficit reduction &lt;U+2014&gt; at no additional cost to taxpayers.</p>
<p>Petri plans to reintroduce his Income-Dependent Education Assistance (IDEA) Act in the 110th Congress. IDEA streamlines student loan repayment through an improved income-contingent loan repayment with direct IRS collection.</p>
<p>In 2005 Petri introduced the Direct Loan Reward Act to achieve savings of some $18 billion over the next 10 years in the federal student loan program. Petri says the present student loan program includes big subsidies for private banks that are unnecessary. &lt;U+201C&gt;If we stop subsidizing banks and just provide the loans directly form the U.S. Treasury, we could free up billions of dollars to be used for Pell scholarships,&lt;U+201D&gt; said Petri, vice-chairman of the Education and Workforce Committee.<a href="http://peacecorpsonline.org/messages/messages/467/2028192.html">4</a></p>
<p>According to the Reporter (the newspaper in <a href="Fond_du_Lac,_Wisconsin" title="wikilink">Fond du Lac, Wisconsin</a>), Petri has secured funds for the construction of the North Fond du Lac bridge overpassing the Canadian National Train Yard.</p>
