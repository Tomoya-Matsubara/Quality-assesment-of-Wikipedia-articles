<p><strong><em>Destiny Fulfilled</em></strong> is the fourth and final <a href="studio_album" title="wikilink">studio album</a> by American <a href="contemporary_R&amp;B" title="wikilink">R&amp;B</a> trio <a href="Destiny&#39;s_Child" title="wikilink">Destiny's Child</a>, released by <a href="Columbia_Records" title="wikilink">Columbia Records</a> on November 15, 2004 in <a href="North_America" title="wikilink">North America</a>.</p>
<p>The album's production began after each member completed solo album releases; the record saw each member active in songwriting and producing. The underlying theme of love, which the group referred to as friendship they found in themselves, reveals their individual experiences.</p>
<p><em>Destiny Fulfilled</em> was released to generally mixed reviews among critics. The album has reached number two on the US <a href="Billboard_200" title="wikilink"><em>Billboard</em> 200</a>, and has since been certified triple platinum by the <a href="Recording_Industry_Association_of_America" title="wikilink">Recording Industry Association of America</a>.</p>
<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>The album came in three years since the release of <a href="Destiny&#39;s_Child" title="wikilink">Destiny's Child</a>'s third studio album, <em><a href="Survivor_(Destiny&#39;s_Child_album)" title="wikilink">Survivor</a></em>. The group went on to a temporary hiatus; each member has released studio album, except group member <a href="Michelle_Williams_(singer)" title="wikilink">Michelle Williams</a> with two. With each of them experiencing domestic success, and others reaching international, however, group member <a href="Beyonc&lt;U+00E9&gt;_Knowles" title="wikilink">Beyonc&lt;U+00E9&gt; Knowles</a> has since been regarded as the most-successful with the release of 2003's <em><a href="Dangerously_In_Love" title="wikilink">Dangerously In Love</a></em>. This led to speculations over the final disbandment of Destiny's Child, and that because they still had ongoing projects. Despite this, group member <a href="Kelly_Rowland" title="wikilink">Kelly Rowland</a> announced in 2004 their return into the studio to record what would be their final album. The group claimed that the reunion was destined to happen, and that their affinity to each other kept them cohesive.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a><a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>Right in the making of the album, they planned to part ways after their fourteen-year career to facilitate their continued pursuit in individual aspirations. Knowles has noted that their destinies were already fulfilled; however, Destiny's Child claimed that naming the album <em>Destiny Fulfilled</em> was not a coincidence of sort.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> Knowles has said that &quot;the group felt it still had something to offer musically with&quot; the album.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> Rowland commented: &quot;We were like, 'You know what, we're getting older and we want to end on a high note.' We want to give our fans a great final record ...&quot;<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> Knowles, however, has commented regarding the finality of their career: &quot;Who knows what will happen in three, five or 10 years? The main thing is that we maintain our friendship and that we do it because we want to -- not because it's a good business move.&quot;<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="production">Production</h2>
<p>Production of the album begun in the summer of 2004. Destiny's Child worked with some American producers including <a href="Rockwilder" class="uri" title="wikilink">Rockwilder</a>, <a href="Swizz_Beatz" title="wikilink">Swizz Beatz</a> and <a href="Rodney_Jerkins" title="wikilink">Rodney Jerkins</a>. Jerkins, who had worked with Knowles' solo album, concerned how he would manage the production, saying, &quot;How is this going to work?' Cause Beyonc&lt;U+00E9&gt;, she blew up solo, so how's it going to work in a group together?&quot;<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> Once inside the studio, however, his skepticism vanished as he saw the group's &quot;excitement&quot;, calling the process &quot;natural&quot;.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p>Differing from <em><a href="Survivor_(Destiny&#39;s_Child_album)" title="wikilink">Survivor</a></em> in that previously Knowles had taken an active role in writing and producing, <em>Destiny Fulfilled</em> saw each member contributing inputs culled from experiences. The ideas that constitute the album were said to have largely came from the group. In most cases, producers of the album would send them a CD containing a track that would be the group's basis in the songwriting process. Without the producer's supervision of which part to sing, that formed a new direction of their style different from the group's previous records. Traditionally, each member sings one verse and chimes in the chorus; in some songs in <em>Destiny Fulfilled</em>, their vocals are alternated in every line of the lyrics. Destiny's Child took the role of executive producing alongside their manager, <a href="Mathew_Knowles" title="wikilink">Mathew Knowles</a>. Beyonc&lt;U+00E9&gt; Knowles, who vocal produce the songs, commented that it was important for her to make sure their voices are audible and identifiable. Taking it as one of her goal, the group decided to focus on mid-tempo songs and few on dance and ballads&lt;U+2014&gt;which they considered people cannot sing with. The group worked on the album within three weeks.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="theme">Theme</h2>
<p>Ever since, every Destiny's Child album has to be personal in content according to Rowland, which she considered their main ingredient in every of their songs.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> Rowland was recently engaged in the time that influenced her songwriting. Rowland cited also that being apart from the group had an impact on the album: &quot;All of us have been in three different places ... so there's a lot to talk about, a lot that's gone on, personally. I think it's important to talk about that on this new record, to put what we've been going through separately into the new record.&quot;<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<p>Apart from each other, Destiny's Child members exhausted their first week in the studio chatting what has gone while apart from each other. Subsequently, they decided to record their conversations that led to the theme of the album. Knowles commented that the process turned the songs somewhat telling a story and is continued on the subsequent songs. The album opens with &quot;Lose My Breath&quot;, a song detailing a man full of promises to a woman. Knowles says, &quot;He's not fulfilling you like he says, so you tell him, 'I need a soldier.'&quot;<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> The need continues to &quot;Soldier&quot;, the following track. After finding the soldier, the third song, &quot;Cater 2 U&quot;, is about serving this man they considered as such. According to the members, the songs are story of a group of women trying to find love; they, however, referred to this love as sisterhood.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="release-and-promotion">Release and promotion</h2>
<p><em>Destiny Fulfilled</em> was released on November 15, 2008 via <a href="Columbia_Records" title="wikilink">Columbia Records</a>. The earlier original release, November 15, was crapped as the group's label was concerned to &quot;potential for Internet leaks and <a href="optical_disc_authoring" title="wikilink">'burned' CD</a> counterfeits&quot; that could &quot;lead consumers to experience inferior and incomplete versions of the album&quot;.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> The album's <a href="lead_single" title="wikilink">lead single</a>, &quot;<a href="Lose_My_Breath" title="wikilink">Lose My Breath</a>&quot;, premiered at <a href="AOL_Music" title="wikilink">AOL Music</a> and its high-mark debut on the <a href="Billboard_Hot_100" title="wikilink"><em>Billboard</em> Hot 100</a> has given the album an early boost.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
<p>Destiny's Child tied up with <a href="McDonald&#39;s" class="uri" title="wikilink">McDonald's</a>, who would sponsor <a href="Destiny_Fulfilled..._And_Lovin&#39;_It" title="wikilink">their tour promoting the album</a>.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> Just as the advanced release date of the album was announced, the group confirmed the initial dates of the tour. The group performed on <a href="ABC" class="uri" title="wikilink">ABC</a>'s <a href="National_Football_League" title="wikilink">National Football League</a> &quot;Opening Kickoff&quot; special to break their yearlong hiatus.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="reception">Reception</h2>
<h3 id="critical-reviews">Critical reviews</h3>
<p>The album received generally mixed reviews among critics. Of the reviewers, some has commented on the uptempo and ballads featured in the album. Sullivan has said that the album's &quot;huge landmass of ballads ... brings out the girliness in the trio, musically and lyrically&quot;.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> Eliscu also noted that after a couple of upbeat songs, &quot;... the album slumps into an endless string of overwrought R&amp;B ballads where the only saving grace is ... these ladies can harmonize like nobody's business.&quot;<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> Stephen Thomas Erlewine of <a href="Allmusic" class="uri" title="wikilink">Allmusic</a> has also the same thoughts, writing that after &quot;an invigorating opening salvo of two hard-driving dance cuts ... the album slides into a series of nine slow-grooving tracks that eventually all blend together&quot;. He complimented that the harmonies &quot;sound good&quot;, &quot;cooing their leads nicely and providing warm harmonies on the choruses&quot;. He added that a few cuts stand out&quot;.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> Eric Henderson of Slant Magazine has commented that the ballads of the album build into &quot;the same sort of standoffish sexual supply-and-demand bartering that has marred their worst tracks&quot;.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> Sinclair has similar criticisms, writing that the album is &quot;weighted down with a preponderance of exquisitely executed but ultimately dull ballads&quot;.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a></p>
<p>Some critics paid attention to what they believe was equality in the album. Caroline Sullivan of <em><a href="The_Guardian" title="wikilink">The Guardian</a></em> has commented that the lead vocals of every song are likely to be sung by each member, noting that it made <em>Destiny Fulfilled</em> a &quot;democratic album&quot;;<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> Tom Sinclair of <em><a href="Entertainment_Weekly" title="wikilink">Entertainment Weekly</a></em> has also noticed its &quot;overall air of democracy at work&quot;.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> Jenny Eliscu of <em><a href="Rolling_Stone" title="wikilink">Rolling Stone</a></em> magazine echoes the above comments, saying, &quot;In all but a couple of songs, the verses are divided into three sections, with Beyonce leading things off, followed by Rowland, then Williams ...&quot;<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> Dimitri Ehrlich of <em><a href="Vibe_(magazine)" title="wikilink">Vibe</a></em> magazine complimented the production of the album, saying that it &quot;showcases advanced production values&quot; with &quot;impressive&quot; songwriting and vocal abilities. Ehrlich, finishing his reviews, noted that the album &quot;offers divine satisfaction&quot;, referring the group as if they are singing to God.&lt;ref name=&quot;EhrlichVibe&gt;</ref></p>
<p>Most of the critics were questioning why Knowles had to return to Destiny's Child after achieving the most among the members of the group. Eliscu held that despite the presence of some strong songs in the album, &quot;Destiny Fulfilled sounds like the kind of album you make when you're saving your best material for your next solo album. Which, in Beyonce's case, better come soon[, referring to her second solo album, <em><a href="B&#39;Day" class="uri" title="wikilink">B'Day</a></em>].&quot;<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> Henderson, however, lambasted Knowles to performing again with the group with the &quot;full intention&quot; of taking advantage to bolster her &quot;divette&quot; status to superstardom.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> Erlewine stated that the album is a &quot;retreat to Destiny's Child's comfortable status quo, where Kelly and Michelle take a backseat, both intentionally and not, to the undeniable star that is Beyonc&lt;U+00E9&gt;&quot;, adding that the latter steals every song. Erlewine, however, summarizes his review with: &quot;as a whole, the album winds up sounding too reserved and heavy-handed, which makes it a disappointment not only compared to what the group has done before, but also to what the girls have achieved outside the group&quot;.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> Sinclair has said that &quot;Destiny Fulfilled comes off like a misguided attempt to emphasize that Destiny's Child are more than just The Beyonc&lt;U+00E9&gt; Show&quot;.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> <a href="Kelefa_Sanneh" title="wikilink">Kelefa Sanneh</a> of <em><a href="The_New_York_Times" title="wikilink">The New York Times</a></em> commented that it is &quot;a surprisingly perfunctory disc that never quite justifies its existence&quot;. He added that it is not &quot;fierce&quot; enough to be &quot;a triumphant return and not giddy enough to be a just-for-fun lark&quot;.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a></p>

<p>Despite their disbandment, Destiny's Child claimed the split was somehow planned when making the album with Knowles admitting that it was not coincidence it was named <em>Destiny Fulfilled</em>.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> While in the studio, they discussed individual aspirations and realized that remaining as Destiny's Child will prevent them to pursue those interests and continuing as a group as well. Rowland revealed that if they were to break up, they should do it while on top and while they &quot;were still friends&quot;.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> Knowles, however, emphasized that <em>Destiny Fulfilled</em> would not be their last album and disclosed the idea of reunion.</p>
