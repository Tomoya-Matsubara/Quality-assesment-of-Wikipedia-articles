<p><strong><em>Red Dwarf</em></strong> is a <a href="United_Kingdom" title="wikilink">British</a> <a href="science_fiction_on_television" title="wikilink">science fiction</a> <a href="comedy" class="uri" title="wikilink">comedy</a> <a href="Media_franchise" title="wikilink">franchise</a>, the primary form of which comprises eight series of a television <a href="sitcom" class="uri" title="wikilink">sitcom</a> that ran on <a href="BBC_Two" title="wikilink">BBC2</a> between <a href="1988" class="uri" title="wikilink">1988</a> and <a href="1999" class="uri" title="wikilink">1999</a>,<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> and which has achieved a global <a href="cult_following" title="wikilink">cult following</a>.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> It was created and originally written by <a href="Grant_Naylor" title="wikilink">Grant Naylor</a> (a so-called '<a href="gestalt" class="uri" title="wikilink">gestalt</a> entity', in reality a collective <a href="pseudonym" class="uri" title="wikilink">pseudonym</a> for the writing duo <a href="Rob_Grant" title="wikilink">Rob Grant</a> and <a href="Doug_Naylor" title="wikilink">Doug Naylor</a>). The show's origins come from a recurring sketch, <em><a href="Dave_Hollins:_Space_Cadet" title="wikilink">Dave Hollins: Space Cadet</a></em>, in the mid-1980s <a href="BBC_Radio_4" title="wikilink">BBC Radio 4</a> comedy show <em><a href="Son_Of_Clich&lt;U+00E9&gt;" title="wikilink">Son Of Clich&lt;U+00E9&gt;</a></em>, also scripted by Grant and Naylor.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> In addition to the <em>Red Dwarf</em> television series, there have also been four bestselling <a href="novels" class="uri" title="wikilink">novels</a>, two <a href="Pilot_(television)" title="wikilink">pilot episodes</a> for an American version of the show, and a significant number of tie-in books, magazines and other merchandise.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>Despite the <a href="pastiche" class="uri" title="wikilink">pastiche</a> of science fiction used as a backdrop, <em>Red Dwarf</em> is primarily a character driven comedy, with many off-the-wall science fiction elements used as complementary <a href="plot_device" title="wikilink">plot devices</a>. In the early series episodes, a recurring source of comedy was the <a href="The_Odd_Couple" title="wikilink">&quot;odd couple&quot;</a> relationship between <a href="Dave_Lister" title="wikilink">Dave Lister</a> and <a href="Arnold_Rimmer" title="wikilink">Arnold Rimmer</a>, the two central characters of the show, who have an intense dislike for each other but are trapped together deep in space.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p><em>Red Dwarf</em>'s highest accolade came in 1994, when an episode from the sixth series, &quot;<a href="Gunmen_of_the_Apocalypse" title="wikilink">Gunmen of the Apocalypse</a>&quot;, won an <a href="International_Emmy" title="wikilink">International Emmy Award</a> in the Popular Arts category.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> The show has also won Best BBC Comedy series at the <a href="British_Comedy_Awards" title="wikilink">British Comedy Awards</a> during the same year,<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> and attracted its highest ratings &lt;U+2014&gt; of over eight million viewers &lt;U+2014&gt; by the eighth series in 1999.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p>The current state of the franchise remains uncertain. The series is unlikely to return to the BBC, after they turned down proposals for a ninth series, and a big screen version of the show has often been promised, but has struggled to secure sufficient funding.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> However, new animated 'mobisodes' have been made available to mobile subscribers,<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> and in recent months series creator Doug Naylor has mentioned the possibility of an animated movie, television series, or taking the live action series to another broadcaster.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>

<p><img src="RedDwarfShipOriginal.jpg" title="fig:The original Red Dwarf ship model as used for the first five series." alt="The original Red Dwarf ship model as used for the first five series." width="250" />The main setting of the series the mining ship <strong><em><a href="Red_Dwarf_ships#Red_Dwarf" title="wikilink">Red Dwarf</a></em></strong> which is a spaceship 6 miles (10 km) long, 5 miles (8 km) tall, and 4 miles (6 km) wide belonging to the Jupiter Mining Corporation. In the first episode, an on-board radiation leak of Cadmium II kills everyone except for low-ranking technician <a href="Dave_Lister" title="wikilink">Dave Lister</a>, who is in suspended animation at the time, and his pregnant cat, Frankenstein, who is safely sealed in the cargo hold. Following the accident, the ship's computer <a href="Holly_(Red_Dwarf)" title="wikilink">Holly</a> has to keep Lister in stasis until the background radiation dies down &lt;U+2014&gt; a process that takes three million years. Lister therefore emerges as the last human being in the universe &lt;U+2014&gt; but not the only life form on-board the ship. His former bunkmate and immediate superior <a href="Arnold_Rimmer" title="wikilink">Arnold Rimmer</a> is resurrected by Holly as a <a href="Volumetric_display" title="wikilink">Hologram</a> after the accident to keep Lister sane, while a creature known only as <a href="Cat_(Red_Dwarf)" title="wikilink">Cat</a> is the last known surviving member of <strong><a href="Felis_sapiens" title="wikilink">Felis Sapiens</a></strong>, a race of humanoids that evolved in the ship's hold from Lister's cat Frankenstein and her kittens during the millions of years that Lister was in stasis.</p>
<p>The main dramatic thrust of the early series is Lister's desire to return home to Earth. Along the way are frequent distractions that usually see the not-so-intrepid <em>Dwarf</em> crew encountering strange races and lifeforms that have developed in the intervening millions of years.</p>
<p>The crew roster change as the years go by. During the second series, the group encounter the sanitation <a href="mechanoid" class="uri" title="wikilink">mechanoid</a> <a href="Kryten" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kryten</a>, rescuing him from a long-since crashed vessel. Initially, Kryten only appeared in <a href="Kryten" title="wikilink">one episode</a> of series two, but by the beginning of series three he had become a regular character. At the end of series five, <em>Red Dwarf</em> itself is stolen from the crew, forcing them to travel in the smaller <strong><em><a href="Starbug" class="uri" title="wikilink">Starbug</a></em></strong> craft for the subsequent two series, with the added side-effect that they lose contact with Holly. In series seven, Rimmer departs the crew to take up the role of his alter-ego from a parallel universe, <a href="Ace_Rimmer" title="wikilink">Ace Rimmer</a>, whose name has become a long-standing legend and a legacy passed down from dimension to dimension. Shortly afterwards, the crew find a replacement for Rimmer when they encounter another parallel version of themselves from a universe in which <a href="Kristine_Kochanski" title="wikilink">Kristine Kochanski</a>, Lister's former girlfriend, was the person put into stasis and so the last remaining human. A complicated series of events leaves Kochanski stranded in &quot;our&quot; universe, and she is forced to join the crew.</p>
<p>In the eighth (and, so far, final) series, <em>Red Dwarf</em> is reconstructed by the <a href="nanobots" class="uri" title="wikilink">nanobots</a> that had originally stolen it and broken it down into its constituent atoms. In the process, the entire crew of the ship &lt;U+2014&gt; including a pre-accident Rimmer &lt;U+2014&gt; are resurrected, but the <em>Starbug</em> crew all find themselves sentenced to two years in the ship's <a href="brig" class="uri" title="wikilink">brig</a> on a set of convoluted charges. The series ends, however, with <em>Red Dwarf</em> being eaten away by a virus and all on board evacuated, save for Rimmer who is, in the cliffhanger ending, left stranded alone to face <a href="Grim_Reaper" title="wikilink">Death</a>.</p>
<h2 id="characters-and-actors">Characters and actors</h2>

<p><img src="red_dwarf_series_ii_group.jpg" title="fig:The original cast, Danny John-Jules, Craig Charles, Chris Barrie and Norman Lovett, in a scene from Series II." alt="The original cast, Danny John-Jules, Craig Charles, Chris Barrie and Norman Lovett, in a scene from Series II." width="250" /><a href="Dave_Lister" title="wikilink">Dave Lister</a>, played by <a href="Craig_Charles" title="wikilink">Craig Charles</a>, is a genial <a href="Liverpudlian" class="uri" title="wikilink">Liverpudlian</a> and self-described bum. The lowest-ranking crew member on the ship (chicken soup machine technician) before the accident. He has a long-standing desire to return to Earth and start a farm on <a href="Fiji" class="uri" title="wikilink">Fiji</a>, but is left impossibly far away by the accident that renders him the last surviving member of the human race.</p>
<p>His bunk mate <a href="Arnold_Judas_Rimmer" title="wikilink">Arnold Rimmer</a>, played by <a href="Chris_Barrie" title="wikilink">Chris Barrie</a>, is a fussy, <a href="bureaucratic" class="uri" title="wikilink">bureaucratic</a>, <a href="neurotic" class="uri" title="wikilink">neurotic</a> coward, who is nevertheless judged by Holly to have the highest chance of keeping Lister sane when chosen to be the ship's one available hologram.</p>
<p><a href="Cat_(Red_Dwarf)" title="wikilink">Cat</a>, played by <a href="Danny_John-Jules" title="wikilink">Danny John-Jules</a>, is a humanoid creature who evolved from the offspring of Lister's smuggled pet cat Frankenstein. Cat is concerned with little other than sleeping, eating and fawning over his appearance, and tends not to socialise with other members of the crew. As time goes by, however, he becomes more influenced by his human companions, and so begins to resemble a stylish yet dimwitted human.</p>
<p>The ship's computer <a href="Holly_(Red_Dwarf)" title="wikilink">Holly</a>, (played by <a href="Norman_Lovett" title="wikilink">Norman Lovett</a> during Series I, II, VII and VIII and <a href="Hattie_Hayridge" title="wikilink">Hattie Hayridge</a> in Series III to V), has an <a href="IQ" class="uri" title="wikilink">IQ</a> of 6,000, although this is severely depleted by the three million years he/she is left alone after the accident, having developed &quot;computer senility&quot;. The change in appearance for Series III is explained by Holly having changed his face to resemble that of a computer from a parallel universe with whom he'd fallen in love.</p>
<p><a href="Kryten" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kryten</a>, full name Kryten 2X4B-523P (played by <a href="Robert_Llewellyn" title="wikilink">Robert Llewellyn</a> from Series III onwards, and as a one-off appearance in Series II by <a href="David_Ross_(actor)" title="wikilink">David Ross</a>), was rescued by the crew from a crashed spaceship <em>Nova 5</em>, upon which he had continued to serve the ship's crew despite them having been dead for thousands or even millions of years. After an accident involving Lister's spacebike, Kryten was rebuilt by Lister, with a slightly different appearance and voice. Kryten's main function is a sanitation mechanoid and has an overactive guilt chip. When first encountered by the crew, he is bound by his &quot;behavioural protocols&quot;, but Lister gradually encourages him to break his programming and think for himself.</p>
<p><a href="Kristine_Kochanski" title="wikilink">Kristine Kochanski</a> (originally portrayed by <a href="Clare_Grogan" title="wikilink">Clare Grogan</a> before <a href="Chlo&lt;U+00EB&gt;_Annett" title="wikilink">Chlo&lt;U+00EB&gt; Annett</a> took on the role in Series VII &amp; VIII) was initially a long-gone girlfriend of Lister's whose memory he had cherished ever since. However, a rift between two alternate dimensions revealed that, in the alternate dimension, Kochanski had survived the <em>Red Dwarf</em> cadmium II accident. Kochanski later joined Lister and the <em>Red Dwarf</em> crew after the link to her own dimension collapsed.</p>

Lister's other drinking buddies were <a href="Red_Dwarf_characters#Selby_and_Chen" title="wikilink">Selby and Chen</a>, (played by David Gillespie and Paul Bradley, respectively). When Lister and Rimmer were imprisoned, and then enrolled in an SAS style group called the Canaries, they had company with the likes of <a href="Red_Dwarf_characters#Kill_Crazy" title="wikilink">Kill Crazy</a>, (played by <a href="Jake_Wood" title="wikilink">Jake Wood</a>), and Baxter, (played by <a href="Ricky_Grover" title="wikilink">Ricky Grover</a>), both were on hand to help out with any problems. <a href="Red_Dwarf_characters#Warden_Ackerman" title="wikilink">Warden Ackerman</a>, (played by <a href="Graham_McTavish" title="wikilink">Graham McTavish</a>), would also turn up to torment the imprisoned pair. <a href="Red_Dwarf_characters#The_Skutters" title="wikilink">The Skutters</a> are small maintenance robots that appear when needed, but have limited skills and cause more damage than good.</p>
<h2 id="production">Production</h2>
<p>The first series aired on <a href="BBC_Two" title="wikilink">BBC2</a> in 1988. Seven further series have so far been produced,<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> and a <a href="film" class="uri" title="wikilink">film</a> has been in <a href="development_hell" title="wikilink">development hell</a> almost continually since before the last series in 1999.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="concept-and-commission">Concept and commission</h3>
<p>The concept for the show was originally developed from the sketch-series <em><a href="Dave_Hollins:_Space_Cadet" title="wikilink">Dave Hollins: Space Cadet</a></em> on the <a href="BBC_Radio_4" title="wikilink">BBC Radio 4</a> show <em><a href="Son_of_Clich&lt;U+00E9&gt;" title="wikilink">Son of Clich&lt;U+00E9&gt;</a></em> in the mid-1980s, written by <a href="Rob_Grant" title="wikilink">Rob Grant</a> and <a href="Doug_Naylor" title="wikilink">Doug Naylor</a>.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> Some of their influences came from 1970s movies such as <em><a href="Alien_(movie)" title="wikilink">Alien</a></em>, <em><a href="Dark_Star_(film)" title="wikilink">Dark Star</a></em>,<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> <em><a href="Silent_Running" title="wikilink">Silent Running</a></em>, and the television series <em><a href="Lost_in_Space" title="wikilink">Lost in Space</a></em>; but their concept had a large element of British-style comedy and satire thrown into the mix, ultimately moulded into the form of a <a href="sitcom" class="uri" title="wikilink">sitcom</a>. Having first written the pilot script for <em>Red Dwarf</em> in <a href="1983" class="uri" title="wikilink">1983</a> during a stay at a <a href="Wales" title="wikilink">Welsh</a> <a href="cottage" class="uri" title="wikilink">cottage</a> owned by Naylor's father, the former <em><a href="Spitting_Image" title="wikilink">Spitting Image</a></em> writers had hawked their unusual and original script around a number of places but it was rejected by everyone at the BBC for three years, as it was believed a sitcom based around science fiction wouldn't be popular.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
<p>However it was finally accepted by <a href="BBC_North" title="wikilink">BBC North</a> in <a href="1986" class="uri" title="wikilink">1986</a>, a happy result of a spare budget being assigned for a second series of <em><a href="Happy_Families_(TV_series)" title="wikilink">Happy Families</a></em> that would never arise, and producer <a href="Paul_Jackson" title="wikilink">Paul Jackson</a>'s insistance that a new series called <em>Red Dwarf</em> should be filmed.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> The show was lucky to be remounted after an <a href="electrician" class="uri" title="wikilink">electrician</a>'s <a href="Strike_action" title="wikilink">strike</a> partway through rehearsals shut the entire production down,<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> and the first episode, &quot;<strong><a href="The_End_(Red_Dwarf_episode)" title="wikilink">The End</a></strong>&quot;, finally made it onto screens on <a href="15_February" title="wikilink">15 February</a> <a href="1988" class="uri" title="wikilink">1988</a>.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="casting">Casting</h3>
<p><a href="Alan_Rickman" title="wikilink">Alan Rickman</a> and <a href="Alfred_Molina" title="wikilink">Alfred Molina</a> were two of the notable names that auditioned for roles in the series, with Molina actually being cast as Rimmer originally.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a><a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> However, after Molina having difficulties with the concept of the series, and of his role in particular, the role was recast and filled by <a href="Chris_Barrie" title="wikilink">Chris Barrie</a>. Barrie was a professional voice-actor and impressionist who had previously worked with both the writers on <em><a href="Spitting_Image" title="wikilink">Spitting Image</a></em>, and with the producers on <em><a href="Happy_Families_(TV_series)" title="wikilink">Happy Families</a></em> and various <a href="Jasper_Carrott" title="wikilink">Jasper Carrott</a> productions.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> <a href="Craig_Charles" title="wikilink">Craig Charles</a>, a <a href="Liverpudlian" class="uri" title="wikilink">Liverpudlian</a> &quot;punk poet&quot;, was given the role of Dave Lister. He was originally approached by Grant and Naylor for his opinion about the character 'The Cat' as they were concerned it may be considered by some people as racist.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> On the television programme 'Comedy Connections', Charles described the character as 'pretty cool' and after reading the script he decided he wanted to audition for the part of Dave Lister. Laconic <a href="stand_up_comedian" title="wikilink">stand up comedian</a> <a href="Norman_Lovett" title="wikilink">Norman Lovett</a>, who had originally tried out for the role of Rimmer,<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> was kept in the show as the senile computer of the titular <a href="Red_Dwarf_ships#Red_Dwarf" title="wikilink">ship</a>, <a href="Holly_(Red_Dwarf)" title="wikilink">Holly</a>. A professional dancer and singer, <a href="Danny_John-Jules" title="wikilink">Danny John-Jules</a>, arriving famously late for his appointment, stood out as <a href="Cat_(Red_Dwarf)" title="wikilink">The Cat</a> immediately. This was partly due to his &quot;cool&quot; exterior, partly due to his dedicated research (reading <a href="Desmond_Morris" title="wikilink">Desmond Morris</a>'s book <em><a href="Catwatching" class="uri" title="wikilink">Catwatching</a></em>), and partly because he showed up in character, wearing his father's 1950s-style suit.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a></p>

Grant left in 1996 to pursue other projects, leaving Naylor to write the final two series with a group of new writers, notably including Paul Alexander and actor Robert Llewellyn who portrayed the <em>Red Dwarf</em> character Kryten.</p>
<p>For the most part, <a href="Ed_Bye" title="wikilink">Ed Bye</a> produced and directed the series. He left before Series V due to a scheduling clash (he ending up directing a series starring his wife, <a href="Ruby_Wax" title="wikilink">Ruby Wax</a>), and Juliet May took over as director, but she parted ways with Grant and Naylor partway through the series for personal and professional reasons. Grant and Naylor took over direction of the series, in addition to writing and producing.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> Series VI was directed by Andy de Emmony, and Ed Bye returned to direct Series VII and VIII.

<h3 id="hiatus-changes-and-future-prospects">Hiatus, changes, and future prospects</h3>
<p>A period of three years elapsed between Series VI and VII, partly due to the parting of the Grant and Naylor partnership, but also due to cast and crew working on other projects.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> When the series eventually returned, it was <a href="filmizing" title="wikilink">filmised</a> and no longer shot in front of a live audience, allowing for greater use of four-walled sets, <a href="location_shooting" title="wikilink">location shooting</a> and <a href="Single_camera_setup" title="wikilink">single camera</a> techniques.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> When the show returned for its eighth series two years later, it had dropped use of the filmising process and restored the live audience<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a></p>

<p><img src="Red_Dwarf_Polymorph1.png" title="fig:The episode &quot;Polymorph&quot; parodied the Alien films" alt="The episode &quot;Polymorph&quot; parodied the Alien films" width="200" /> While <em>Red Dwarf</em> is a comedy series, the science fiction theme of the series was always treated seriously by Grant and Naylor. Satire, parody and drama were alternately woven into the series' episodes. A number of the episodes contain references to other (not always science fiction) television shows, films, books and plays. These have included references to the likes of <em><a href="2001:_A_Space_Odyssey_(film)" title="wikilink">2001: A Space Odyssey</a></em>, <em><a href="Top_Gun_(film)" title="wikilink">Top Gun</a></em>, <em><a href="RoboCop_(film)" title="wikilink">RoboCop</a></em>, <em><a href="Star_Wars" title="wikilink">Star Wars</a></em>, <em><a href="Terminator" class="uri" title="wikilink">Terminator</a></em>, <em><a href="Jaws_(film)" title="wikilink">Jaws</a></em>, <em><a href="Citizen_Kane" title="wikilink">Citizen Kane</a></em>, <em><a href="The_Wild_One" title="wikilink">The Wild One</a></em>, <em><a href="Rebel_Without_a_Cause" title="wikilink">Rebel Without a Cause</a></em>, <em><a href="Easy_Rider" title="wikilink">Easy Rider</a></em>, <em><a href="Friday_the_13th" title="wikilink">Friday the 13th</a></em>, <em><a href="Planet_of_the_Apes" title="wikilink">Planet of the Apes</a></em>, <em><a href="Pride_and_Prejudice_(film)" title="wikilink">Pride and Prejudice</a></em> and <em><a href="Full_Metal_Jacket" title="wikilink">Full Metal Jacket</a></em>.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a><a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a><a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a><a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a><a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a></p>
<p>In some cases, the whole theme of an episode was based on a film plot reference. The Series III episode &quot;<a href="Polymorph_(Red_Dwarf_episode)" title="wikilink">Polymorph</a>&quot; references and parodies several key moments from the 1978 film <em><a href="Alien_(film)" title="wikilink">Alien</a></em>,<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> Series IV's &quot;<a href="Camille_(Red_Dwarf_episode)" title="wikilink">Camille</a>&quot; echoes key scenes from <em><a href="Casablanca_(film)" title="wikilink">Casablanca</a></em> (1942),<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> and &quot;<a href="Meltdown_(Red_Dwarf_episode)" title="wikilink">Meltdown</a>&quot; borrows the main plot from <em><a href="Westworld" class="uri" title="wikilink">Westworld</a></em> (1973).<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a></p>
<p>Historical events and figures have also been referenced, and even integrated as part of many episodes, from <a href="The_Hundred_Years_War" title="wikilink">The Hundred Years War</a>, <a href="The_Thirty_Years_War" title="wikilink">The Thirty Years War</a> and <a href="World_War_II" title="wikilink">World War II</a>, and from <a href="Hitler" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hitler</a> to <a href="William_Shakespeare" title="wikilink">William Shakespeare</a>.</p>
<p>Religion also plays a part in the series. Besides the overall religion theme of the Cat species, and how Lister turns out to be their God, the <a href="Bible" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bible</a> has been referenced several times.</p>
<h2 id="hallmarks">Hallmarks</h2>
<p><em>Red Dwarf</em> developed its own distinct vocabulary. Words and phrases such as <a href="Hologrammatic" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hologrammatic</a>, <a href="Dollarpound" class="uri" title="wikilink">Dollarpound</a>, <a href="Felis_sapiens" title="wikilink">Felis sapiens</a>, <a href="Red_Dwarf_characters#Simulants" title="wikilink">Rogue Simulants</a>, <a href="GELF" class="uri" title="wikilink">GELF</a>, Space weevil and Zero G Football appear at various points during the series, highlighting a development in language, political climate, technology, evolution and culture in the future.</p>
<p>The series also employed a vocabulary of fictional expletives in order to avoid using potentially-offensive <a href="expletive" title="wikilink">expletives</a> in the show, and to give nuance to futuristic colloquial language. '<a href="smeg_(vulgarism)" title="wikilink">Smeg</a>', gimp, gimboid, goit, and varients of smeg like smegging, smegger and smeg-head were used.<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="critical-reactions-and-achievements">Critical reactions and achievements</h2>
<h3 id="mixed-reactions">Mixed reactions</h3>
<p>The many changes that were made to the series' cast, setting, creative teams and even production values from series to series have meant that opinions differ greatly between fans as to the quality of certain series.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a> Series VI is often regarded as a highlight for lovers of one-line jokes but some saw it as a continuation of the 'Monster of the week' philosophy of Series V, which was nevertheless visually impressive.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a> In Series VII and VIII there was a discernible shift away from both 'Monster of the week' and the stereotypical antagonism between Lister and Rimmer.<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a></p>
<p>Series VII was seen by many as a disappointment: while much slicker and higher-budget in appearance, the shift away from outright <a href="sitcom" class="uri" title="wikilink">sitcom</a> and into something approaching <a href="comedy_drama" title="wikilink">comedy drama</a> did not impress a significant number of long-standing fans. Furthermore, the attempt to then shift back into traditional sitcom format for Series VIII was greeted with a response that was similarly lukewarm. There was also a significant amount of criticism aimed at the decision to resurrect the entire crew of <em>Red Dwarf</em>, as many felt this detracted from the series' central premise of <a href="Dave_Lister" title="wikilink">Lister</a> being the last human being alive.<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a></p>
<p>On the other hand, there are other <em>Red Dwarf</em> fans who feel that Series VII and VIII, either separately or as a whole, are no weaker than the earlier series, and the topic is therefore the subject of constant fervent debate among the show's fanbase.<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a> Similar discussions revolve around the quality of Series VI, seen by some as just as good as any of the earlier series',<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a> but by others as a descent into formulaic comedy with an unwelcome change of setting.<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a> There are even those who argue that the show lost its way with the significant changes made for Series III.<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a></p>
<p>Despite all the changes and fan disputes <em>Red Dwarf</em> was voted 'Best Sci-Fi show of all time' in 2007 by the readers of <em><a href="Radio_Times" title="wikilink">Radio Times</a></em> magazine. <em>Radio Times</em> editor, Gill Hudson stated that this result had surprised them as the show hadn't broadcast any new episodes this century.<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="television-ratings">Television ratings</h3>
<p>The series began with rather poor ratings, although gathering over four million viewers for the pilot episode, this soon trailed off.<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a> Series II had averaged 3.2 million viewers. A slight gain, coupled with the good viewer feedback meant that Series III was a possibility.<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a></p>
<p>Through Series IV to Series VI the ratings had steadily increased and had peaked at over six million viewers. <a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a> When the series returned in 1997 it gained the highest audience figures yet. Over 8 million viewers tuned in for Series VII,<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a> and similar viewing figures were achieved for Series VIII.<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="achievements">Achievements</h3>
<p>In its eight-series history, <em>Red Dwarf</em> has won numerous awards including the Royal Television Society Award for special effects, the British Science Fiction award for Best Dramatic Presentation, as well as an International Emmy.<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a></p>
<p>The International Emmy Award was achieved for Series VI episode &quot;Gunmen of the Apocalypse&quot;, which tied with <em><a href="Absolutely_Fabulous" title="wikilink">Absolutely Fabulous</a></em>' episode &quot;Hospital&quot; in the Popular Arts category. <em>Red Dwarf</em> has also been nominated for an International Emmy in 1987, 1989, and 1992. Series VI also won a British Academy of Film and Television Arts (<a href="BAFTA" class="uri" title="wikilink">BAFTA</a>) award for &quot;Best British Comedy Series&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;&quot;Red Dwarf&quot; (1988) - Awards&quot;&gt;</ref></p>
<p>The <em>Red Dwarf</em> video sales have also won 8 Gold Awards from the British Video Association,<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a> and the series still holds the record for being BBC2's longest running, highest rated sitcom.<a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="spin-offs-and-merchandise">Spin-offs and merchandise</h2>
<h3 id="novels">Novels</h3>
<p><img src="GrantNaylor_RedDwarf.jpg" title="fig:The first novel, Infinity Welcomes Careful Drivers, expanded on the Red Dwarf universe and became a best seller." alt="The first novel, Infinity Welcomes Careful Drivers, expanded on the Red Dwarf universe and became a best seller." width="125" />The franchise has expanded to include four novels, written by the show's creators, Doug Naylor and Rob Grant. <em><a href="Infinity_Welcomes_Careful_Drivers" title="wikilink">Infinity Welcomes Careful Drivers</a></em>, <em><a href="Better_Than_Life" title="wikilink">Better Than Life</a></em>, <em><a href="Last_Human" title="wikilink">Last Human</a></em> and <em><a href="Backwards" class="uri" title="wikilink">Backwards</a></em>.</p>
<p>These novels contain deeper insights and more thorough backstories for the main characters, as well as more information on humanity's future state of affairs. Rather than adapting the show outright, the books provide yet another, possibly idealized version of the series' backstory. They reinterpret and reposition elements from past episodes, and even introduce ideas that would later be used in the show.<a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a></p>
<p>It was reported that both authors were working together on a sequel to <em>Better than Life</em>, called <em>The Last Human</em>, but Grant had decided to go it alone and do other things besides <em>Red Dwarf</em>. Still owing Penguin Publishing two more <em>Red Dwarf</em> books, Grant and Naylor decided to each work alone on a novel. Two completely different, contradicting sequels were made as a result. <em>Last Human</em> added Kochanski to the crew and places more emphasis on the science-fiction and plot elements, while <em>Backwards</em> (by Rob Grant) was more in keeping with the previous two books, borrowing more extensively from established television stories.<a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a></p>
<p>All four books were published in <a href="audiobook" class="uri" title="wikilink">audiobook</a> format, the first two read by Chris Barrie,<a href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a><a href="#fn67" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a> <em>Last Human</em> read by Craig Charles,<a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a> and <em>Backwards</em> read by its author Rob Grant.<a href="#fn69" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref69"><sup>69</sup></a></p>
<p>An <em>Omnibus</em> edition of the first two books, including a few edits to the original text and some extra material such as the original script to the first episode of the TV series, was released in 1992.<a href="#fn70" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="dvd-and-vhs-releases">DVD and VHS releases</h3>
<p>For the initial release of the VHS editions, the videos were named after the first episode on the tape, as were other BBC videos at the time. However, on occasions the BBC had decided to ignore the original running order and use the most popular episodes from the series to maximise sales of the videos. For Series V &quot;<a href="Quarantine_(Red_Dwarf_episode)" title="wikilink">Quarantine</a>&quot; and &quot;<a href="Back_to_Reality" title="wikilink">Back to Reality</a>&quot; were given top billing on their respective video release.<a href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a></p>
<p>All eight series had been available on VHS,<ref name="The Red Dwarf Phenomenon"> Three episodes of Series VII were also released as special &quot;Xtended&quot; versions with extra scenes and no laugh track<a href="#fn72" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref72"><sup>72</sup></a> (these &quot;Xtended&quot; episodes would later be included on the DVD),<a href="#fn73" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref73"><sup>73</sup></a> while the <a href="Red_Dwarf_Remastered" title="wikilink">remastered</a> versions of Series I&lt;U+2013&gt;III were released individually<a href="#fn74" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref74"><sup>74</sup></a> <a href="#fn75" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref75"><sup>75</sup></a> and in a complete box-set.<a href="#fn76" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref76"><sup>76</sup></a> Finally, two <a href="blooper" title="wikilink">outtake</a> videos were released, <em>Smeg Ups</em> in 1994, and its sequel <em>Smeg Outs</em> in 1995.<a href="#fn77" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref77"><sup>77</sup></a><a href="#fn78" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref78"><sup>78</sup></a></p>
<p>All eight series have now been released on DVD in Regions 1, 2 and 4, with each release from Series III onward being accompanied by an original documentary about the making of each respective series, and a bonus disc filled with extra material.<a href="#fn79" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref79"><sup>79</sup></a> The DVD releases have been praised for their particularly extensive bonus material.<a href="#fn80" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref80"><sup>80</sup></a></p>
<p>Regions 2 and 4 have also seen the release of two <em>Just The Shows</em>, digipack boxsets containing all the episodes from Series I&lt;U+2013&gt;IV (Volume 1) and V-VIII (Volume 2) with static menus and no extras.<a href="#fn81" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref81"><sup>81</sup></a><a href="#fn82" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref82"><sup>82</sup></a> In October 2006, meanwhile, an <a href="DVD_TV_Games" title="wikilink">Interactive Quiz DVD</a> entitled <em>Red Dwarf: Beat The Geek</em> was released. The DVD is hosted by Norman Lovett and Hattie Hayridge, both reprising their roles as Holly.<a href="#fn83" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref83"><sup>83</sup></a></p>
<p>In 2007 <em>Red Dwarf: The Bodysnatcher Collection</em>, rather than <em>Red Dwarf Remastered</em>, as previously titled, was released. The new title highlighted one of the set's other main bonus features: a storyboard construction of &quot;Bodysnatcher&quot;. The unfinished script from 1987 was finally completed by Rob Grant and Doug Naylor in 2007, working together for the first time since 1993.<a href="#fn84" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref84"><sup>84</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="red-dwarf-smegazine"><em>Red Dwarf Smegazine</em></h3>
<p><img src="red_dwarf_comic_strip_image.jpg" title="fig:Grant and Naylor had requested that the artists draw Rimmer, and all other hologramatics, with a greyscale appearance." alt="Grant and Naylor had requested that the artists draw Rimmer, and all other hologramatics, with a greyscale appearance." width="175" />The <em>Red Dwarf Magazine</em>, the magazine part of the title changed to 'Smegazine' from issue 3, was launched in 1992 by Fleetway Editions. Comprising of a mix of Sci-Fi news, reviews, interviews, comic strips and competitions. The comic strips included episode adaptions and original material, including further stories of popular characters like the Polymorph and Ace Rimmer. These comic strip stories were notable for the fact that hologramatics, most notably Rimmer, were drawn in greyscale. This was at the request of Grant and Naylor, who had wanted to use the technique for the series, but the process was deemed too expensive to produce.<a href="#fn85" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref85"><sup>85</sup></a></p>
<p>Despite achieving circulation figures of over 40,000 per month,<a href="#fn86" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref86"><sup>86</sup></a> the magazine's publisher decided to close the title down to concentrate on their other publications.<a href="#fn87" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref87"><sup>87</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="u.s.-version">U.S. version</h3>
<p>A <a href="television_pilot" title="wikilink">pilot episode</a> for an <a href="United_States" title="wikilink">American</a> version (known to fans as <strong><em>Red Dwarf USA</em></strong>) was produced for <a href="NBC" class="uri" title="wikilink">NBC</a> in 1992, though never broadcast. The show followed essentially the same story as the first episode of the original series, substituting American actors (including <a href="Craig_Bierko" title="wikilink">Craig Bierko</a> as Lister, <a href="Chris_Eigeman" title="wikilink">Chris Eigeman</a> as Rimmer, and <a href="Hinton_Battle" title="wikilink">Hinton Battle</a> as the Cat) for the British; exceptions being Llewellyn, who reprised his role as Kryten, and the British actress <a href="Jane_Leeves" title="wikilink">Jane Leeves</a>, later of <em><a href="Frasier" class="uri" title="wikilink">Frasier</a></em> fame, as Holly. It was directed by <a href="Jeffrey_Melman" title="wikilink">Jeffrey Melman</a> and written and produced by <a href="Linwood_Boomer" title="wikilink">Linwood Boomer</a> of <em><a href="Malcolm_in_the_Middle" title="wikilink">Malcolm in the Middle</a></em> fame.<a href="#fn88" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref88"><sup>88</sup></a></p>
<p>It was also revealed that Rob Grant and Doug Naylor, with the support of the cast, convinced the pilot's producers to use a revised script of their creation, but in the course of production the American team reverted back to their original script.<a href="#fn89" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref89"><sup>89</sup></a></p>
<p>As a result of this the two hastily put together an extremely low-budget network promo consisting of scenes from the first pilot and the British show edited in with newly-filmed footage (featuring a new Rimmer and, from a suggestion made by the network, a female Cat, played by <a href="Terry_Farrell_(actress)" title="wikilink">Terry Farrell</a>). This was also unsuccessful.<a href="#fn90" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref90"><sup>90</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="red-dwarf-the-movie"><em>Red Dwarf: The Movie</em></h3>
<p>Since the end of series Eight, Doug Naylor has been attempting to get funding to make a feature length film version of the show, but on every occasion so far has been thwarted by circumstances. He has long persisted with his conviction that the making of the movie (for which the script has been written for many years) takes precedence over any other possible future incarnation of Red Dwarf. He admits to being &lt;U+2014&gt; perhaps mindful of the age and schedules of the principal cast &lt;U+2014&gt; close to having to make a final, outright decision of whether to continue to pursue the film, make a Series IX or some one-off TV special(s), or simply end the series as it is.<a href="#fn91" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref91"><sup>91</sup></a>, Naylor sent a letter to the <em>Red Dwarf</em> fans at the Dimension Jump convention in 2004, which mostly consisted of his failed attempts to create the film, such as a fake Duke of Manchester offering money to fund the film provided Naylor paid his air fare to attend the meeting. Naylor has also stated that some studios have been impressed by the scripts, but either weren't looking for that kind of project or wanted the film recast.<a href="#fn92" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref92"><sup>92</sup></a> In December 2007, Naylor stated that the movie had &quot;hit a wall&quot; due to the BBC's refusal to buy the broadcast rights putting off other potential investors. He did state, however, that he still intended to make use of the script in some form, potentially in either a stage show or an animated movie.<a href="#fn93" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref93"><sup>93</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="specials">Specials</h3>
<p>On <a href="February_14" title="wikilink">February 14</a> <a href="1998" class="uri" title="wikilink">1998</a>, the night before the tenth anniversary of the show's first broadcast episode, <a href="BBC_Two" title="wikilink">BBC2</a> devoted an evening of special programming to the series, under the banner of <em>Red Dwarf Night</em>. The evening consisted of a mixture of new, specially-recorded content and existing material, and was introduced and linked by famed actor and <em>Dwarf</em> fan <a href="Patrick_Stewart" title="wikilink">Patrick Stewart</a>. In addition, a series of special take-offs on BBC2's famous <a href="Station_identification" title="wikilink">idents</a>, featuring the &quot;2&quot; logo falling in love with a <a href="skutter" class="uri" title="wikilink">skutter</a>, were used.<a href="#fn94" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref94"><sup>94</sup></a></p>
<p>The night began with <em>Can't Smeg, Won't Smeg</em>, a spoof of the popular cookery programme <em><a href="Can&#39;t_Cook,_Won&#39;t_Cook" title="wikilink">Can't Cook, Won't Cook</a></em>, presented by that show's host <a href="Ainsley_Harriott" title="wikilink">Ainsley Harriott</a> who had himself earlier appeared in <em>Red Dwarf</em>.

<p>After a compilation <a href="bloopers" class="uri" title="wikilink">bloopers</a> show, featuring out-takes, the next special programme was <em>Universe Challenge</em>, a take-off of the <em><a href="University_Challenge" title="wikilink">University Challenge</a></em> format. Hosted by original <em>University Challenge</em> presenter <a href="Bamber_Gascoigne" title="wikilink">Bamber Gascoigne</a>.

<p>This was followed by <em>The Red Dwarf A-Z</em>, a half-hour documentary special that chose a different aspect of the show to focus on for each letter of the alphabet. Talking heads on the episode included <a href="Stephen_Hawking" title="wikilink">Stephen Hawking</a>, <a href="Terry_Pratchett" title="wikilink">Terry Pratchett</a>, original producer <a href="K._Paul_Jackson" title="wikilink">Paul Jackson</a>, and Patrick Stewart.
