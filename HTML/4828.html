<p><strong>Psychedelic rock</strong> is a style of <a href="rock_music" title="wikilink">rock music</a> that is inspired or influenced by <a href="psychedelic" class="uri" title="wikilink">psychedelic</a> culture and attempts to replicate and enhance the mind-altering experiences of <a href="psychedelic_drug" title="wikilink">psychedelic drugs</a>. It often uses new recording techniques and effects and draws on non-Western sources such the <a href="raga" title="wikilink">ragas</a> and drones of <a href="Music_of_India" title="wikilink">Indian music</a>.</p>
<p>It was pioneered by musicians including <a href="The_Beatles" title="wikilink">The Beatles</a>, <a href="The_Byrds" title="wikilink">The Byrds</a> and <a href="The_Yardbirds" title="wikilink">The Yardbirds</a>, emerging as a genre during the mid 1960s among <a href="folk_rock" title="wikilink">folk rock</a> and <a href="blues_rock" title="wikilink">blues rock</a> bands in <a href="United_States" title="wikilink">United States</a> and the <a href="United_Kingdom" title="wikilink">United Kingdom</a>, such as <a href="Grateful_Dead" title="wikilink">Grateful Dead</a>, <a href="Jefferson_Airplane" title="wikilink">Jefferson Airplane</a>, <a href="The_Jimi_Hendrix_Experience" title="wikilink">The Jimi Hendrix Experience</a>, <a href="Cream_(band)" title="wikilink">Cream</a> and <a href="Pink_Floyd" title="wikilink">Pink Floyd</a>. It reached a peak in between 1967 and 1969 with the <a href="Summer_of_Love" title="wikilink">Summer of Love</a> and <a href="Woodstock_Festival" title="wikilink">Woodstock rock festival</a>, becoming an international musical movement and associated with a widespread <a href="counter-culture" class="uri" title="wikilink">counter-culture</a>, before beginning a decline as changing attitudes, the loss of some key individuals and a back-to-basics movement, led surviving performers to move into new musical areas.</p>
<p>Psychedelic rock influenced the creation of <a href="psychedelic_pop" title="wikilink">psychedelic pop</a> and <a href="psychedelic_soul" title="wikilink">psychedelic soul</a>. It also bridged the transition from early <a href="blues" class="uri" title="wikilink">blues</a>- and <a href="folk_music" title="wikilink">folk music</a>-based rock to <a href="progressive_rock" title="wikilink">progressive rock</a>, <a href="glam_rock" title="wikilink">glam rock</a>, <a href="hard_rock" title="wikilink">hard rock</a> and as a result influenced the development of sub-genres such as <a href="heavy_metal_music" title="wikilink">heavy metal</a>. Since the late 1970s it has been revived in various forms of <a href="neo-psychedelia" class="uri" title="wikilink">neo-psychedelia</a>.</p>
