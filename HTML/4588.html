<p><a href="image:Song_Xu_painting.JPG" title="wikilink">thumb|Nantoy&lt;U+014D&gt;s&lt;U+014D&gt; Collection, Japan</a> <strong>Song Xu</strong> (, b. <a href="1525" class="uri" title="wikilink">1525</a>), was a Chinese landscape painter. His courtesy name was <em>Shimen</em> or &lt;U+201C&gt;Stone Gate&lt;U+201D&gt;, along with other designations. Song Xu eventually became a <a href="Buddhist" class="uri" title="wikilink">Buddhist</a> priest and adopted various religious names. He was according to some sources from <a href="Jixing" class="uri" title="wikilink">Jixing</a> in <a href="Zhejiang" class="uri" title="wikilink">Zhejiang</a> province, but according to others from <a href="Huzhou" class="uri" title="wikilink">Huzhou</a> in Zhejiang Province. He was and extremely well read and well versed individual who was greatly influenced by <a href="Zen" class="uri" title="wikilink">Zen</a> (Chan) Buddhist teaching. He was an expert landscapist, but also excelled at human figures. In the late 1500s he traveled throughout China. A 1543 scroll shows his study of the <a href="Song_Dynasty" title="wikilink">Song period</a> painter <a href="Hsia_Kuei" title="wikilink">Hsia Kuei</a>. He is said to have studied the works of the master artist <a href="Shen_Zhou" title="wikilink">Shen Zhou</a> (1427-1509). Song's eccentric paintings are often characterized by inscriptions in characters of an archaic style. An extant painting of Buddhist Arhats bears a date of 1605. Other works show a still active painter at eighty-one. Song Xu was an artist that was largely individualistic and independent, working for the most part outside the major painting schools of his age.</p>
