The assailants were traced from calls they made on James Jordan's cellular phone,<a href="#fn79" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref79"><sup>79</sup></a> caught, convicted, and sentenced to life in prison. Jordan was close to his father; as a child he had imitated his father's proclivity to stick out his tongue while absorbed in work.

But the <a href="1994-95_NBA_season" title="wikilink">1994&lt;U+2013&gt;95</a> version of the Bulls was a shell of the championship squad of just two years earlier.

<p>Although he had not played in an NBA game in a year and a half, Jordan played well upon his return, making a game-winning jump shot against <a href="Atlanta_Hawks" title="wikilink">Atlanta</a> in his fourth game back and scoring 55 points in a game against the Knicks at <a href="Madison_Square_Garden" title="wikilink">Madison Square Garden</a> on March 28, 1995.<a href="#fn94" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref94"><sup>94</sup></a> Boosted by Jordan's comeback, the Bulls <a href="1995_NBA_Playoffs" title="wikilink">made the playoffs</a> and advanced to the Eastern Conference Semi-finals against the <a href="Orlando_Magic" title="wikilink">Orlando Magic</a>.

In Game 5, with the series tied 2&lt;U+2013&gt;2, Jordan played despite being feverish and dehydrated from a stomach virus.

<h2 id="player-profile">Player profile</h2>
<p>Jordan was a <a href="shooting_guard" title="wikilink">shooting guard</a> who was also capable of playing <a href="small_forward" title="wikilink">small forward</a> (the position he would primarily play during his second comeback with the <a href="Washington_Wizards" title="wikilink">Washington Wizards</a>). Jordan was known throughout his career for being a strong clutch performer. He decided numerous games with last-second plays (e.g., <a href="The_Shot" title="wikilink">The Shot</a>) and performed at a high level even under adverse circumstances (e.g., <a href="Flu_game#Game_5:_The_Flu_Game" title="wikilink">Flu Game</a>). His competitiveness was visible in his prolific <a href="trash-talk" class="uri" title="wikilink">trash-talk</a><a href="#fn175" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref175"><sup>175</sup></a> and well-known work ethic.<a href="#fn176" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref176"><sup>176</sup></a><a href="#fn177" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref177"><sup>177</sup></a></p>
<p>Jordan had a versatile offensive game. He was capable of aggressively <a href="Penetration_(basketball)" title="wikilink">driving</a> to the basket and drawing <a href="Personal_foul_(basketball)" title="wikilink">fouls</a> from his opponents at a high rate; his 8,772 <a href="free_throw" title="wikilink">free throw</a> attempts are the ninth highest total of all time.<a href="#fn178" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref178"><sup>178</sup></a> As his career progressed, Jordan also developed the ability to <a href="post_up" title="wikilink">post up</a> his opponents and score with his trademark <a href="fadeaway" class="uri" title="wikilink">fadeaway</a> <a href="jump_shot_(basketball)" title="wikilink">jumpshot</a>, using his leaping ability to &quot;fade away&quot; from block attempts. According to <a href="Hubie_Brown" title="wikilink">Hubie Brown</a>, this move alone made him nearly unstoppable.<a href="#fn179" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref179"><sup>179</sup></a> Despite media criticism as a &quot;selfish&quot; player early in his career, Jordan's 5.3 assists per game<a href="#fn180" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref180"><sup>180</sup></a> also indicate his willingness to defer to his teammates. In later years, the NBA shortened its <a href="Three-point_field_goal" title="wikilink">three-point</a> line to 22 feet (from 23 feet, 9 inches), which coupled with Jordan's extended shooting range to make him a long-range threat as well&lt;U+2014&gt;his 3-point stroke developed from a low 9 / 52 rate (.173) in his rookie year into a stellar 111 / 260 (.427) shooter in the 1995&lt;U+2013&gt;96 season.<a href="#fn181" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref181"><sup>181</sup></a> For a guard, Jordan was also a good rebounder (6.2 per game).<a href="#fn182" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref182"><sup>182</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1988, Jordan was honored with the NBA's Defensive Player of the Year Award and became the first NBA player to win both the Defensive Player of the Year and MVP awards in a career (since equaled by <a href="Hakeem_Olajuwon" title="wikilink">Hakeem Olajuwon</a>, <a href="David_Robinson_(basketball)" title="wikilink">David Robinson</a>, and <a href="Kevin_Garnett" title="wikilink">Kevin Garnett</a>; Olajuwon is the only player other than Jordan to win both during the same season). In addition he set records for <a href="block_(basketball)" title="wikilink">blocked shots</a> by a guard,<a href="#fn183" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref183"><sup>183</sup></a> and combined this with his ball-thieving ability to become a standout defensive player.

<p>Nike created a signature shoe for him, called the <em><a href="Air_Jordan" title="wikilink">Air Jordan</a></em>. One of Jordan's more popular commercials for the shoe involved <a href="Spike_Lee" title="wikilink">Spike Lee</a> playing the part of <a href="Mars_Blackmon" title="wikilink">Mars Blackmon</a>.

Subsequently Nike spun off the Jordan line into its own division named the &quot;Jordan Brand&quot;. The company features an impressive list of athletes and celebrities as endorsers.<a href="#fn234" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref234"><sup>234</sup></a><a href="#fn235" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref235"><sup>235</sup></a> The brand has also sponsored college sports programs such as those of <a href="University_of_North_Carolina_at_Chapel_Hill" title="wikilink">North Carolina</a>, <a href="University_of_Cincinnati" title="wikilink">Cincinnati</a>, <a href="University_of_California,_Berkeley" title="wikilink">Cal</a>, <a href="St._John&#39;s_University_(New_York_City)" title="wikilink">St. John's</a>, <a href="Georgetown_University" title="wikilink">Georgetown</a>, and <a href="North_Carolina_Agricultural_and_Technical_State_University" title="wikilink">North Carolina A&amp;T</a>.</p>
<p>Jordan also has been connected with the <a href="Looney_Tunes" title="wikilink">Looney Tunes</a> cartoon characters. A Nike commercial shown during the 1993 <a href="Super_Bowl_XXVII" title="wikilink">Super Bowl XXVII</a> featured Jordan and <a href="Bugs_Bunny" title="wikilink">Bugs Bunny</a> playing basketball against a group of Martian characters.<a href="#fn236" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref236"><sup>236</sup></a> The Super Bowl commercial inspired the 1996 live action/animated movie <em><a href="Space_Jam" title="wikilink">Space Jam</a></em>, which starred Jordan and Bugs in a fictional story set during his first retirement.<a href="#fn237" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref237"><sup>237</sup></a> They have subsequently appeared together in several commercials for MCI.<a href="#fn238" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref238"><sup>238</sup></a></p>
