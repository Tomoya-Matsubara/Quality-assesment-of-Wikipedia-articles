<p><strong>Savile Row</strong> (pronounced ) is a street in <a href="Mayfair" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mayfair</a>, <a href="central_London" title="wikilink">central London</a>. Known principally for its traditional <a href="Savile_Row_tailoring" title="wikilink">bespoke tailoring</a> for men, where customers have included <a href="Horatio_Nelson,_1st_Viscount_Nelson" title="wikilink">Lord Nelson</a>, <a href="Winston_Churchill" title="wikilink">Winston Churchill</a>, and <a href="Jude_Law" title="wikilink">Jude Law</a>,<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> the street has had a varied history which has included accommodating the headquarters of the <a href="Royal_Geographical_Society" title="wikilink">Royal Geographical Society</a> at 1 Savile Row, where significant British explorations to Africa and the South Pole were planned; and more recently, the <a href="Apple_Corps" title="wikilink">Apple</a> office of <a href="the_Beatles" title="wikilink">the Beatles</a> at 3 Savile Row, where the band's final live performance, later shown in the film <em><a href="Let_It_Be_(film)" title="wikilink">Let It Be</a></em>, was held on the roof of the building.</p>
<p>Originally named Savile Street, it was built between 1731 and 1735 as part of the development of the <a href="Burlington_Estate" title="wikilink">Burlington Estate</a>. It was designed under the influence of Burlington's interpretation of <a href="Palladian_architecture" title="wikilink">Palladian architecture</a>, known as &quot;Burlingtonian&quot;. <a href="Henry_Flitcroft" title="wikilink">Henry Flitcroft</a>, under the supervision of <a href="Daniel_Garrett" title="wikilink">Daniel Garrett</a>, appears to have been the main architect &lt;U+2013&gt; though 1 and 22&lt;U+2013&gt;23 Savile Row were designed by <a href="William_Kent" title="wikilink">William Kent</a>. Initially, the street was occupied mainly by military officers and their wives; later <a href="William_Pitt_the_Younger" title="wikilink">William Pitt the Younger</a> and Irish-born playwright and MP, <a href="Richard_Brinsley_Sheridan" title="wikilink">Richard Brinsley Sheridan</a> were residents. Tailors started to appear in the area in the late 18th century; first in <a href="Cork_Street" title="wikilink">Cork Street</a>, about 1790, then by 1803 in Savile Row itself. In 1846, <a href="Henry_Poole_&amp;_Co" title="wikilink">Henry Poole</a>, later credited as the creator of the dinner jacket or tuxedo, opened an entrance to his tailoring premises at 32 Savile Row.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> In 1969, <a href="Nutters_of_Savile_Row" title="wikilink">Nutters of Savile Row</a> modernised the style and approach of traditional <a href="Savile_Row_tailoring" title="wikilink">Savile Row tailoring</a>; a modernisation that continued in the 1990s with the arrival of designers like <a href="Richard_James_(tailor)" title="wikilink">Richard James</a>, <a href="Ozwald_Boateng" title="wikilink">Ozwald Boateng</a> and <a href="Timothy_Everest" title="wikilink">Timothy Everest</a>. Traditional hand made bespoke suits, as of 2012, cost upwards of &lt;U+00A3&gt;2,000. The term &quot;bespoke&quot; as applied to fine tailoring is understood to have originated in Savile Row, and came to mean a suit cut and made by hand; though, after a ruling by the <a href="Advertising_Standards_Authority_(United_Kingdom)" title="wikilink">Advertising Standards Authority</a> in 2008, modern bespoke suits may be made more cheaply by machine, as long as they are still &quot;made to measure&quot;.</p>
<p>Savile Row runs parallel to <a href="Regent_Street" title="wikilink">Regent Street</a> between Conduit Street at the northern end and Vigo Street at the southern. Linking roads include Burlington Place, Clifford Street and Burlington Gardens. The freehold is owned by the Pollen Estate, who work in partnership with <a href="Westminster_City_Council" title="wikilink">Westminster City Council</a> to protect the street's tailoring heritage under the Savile Row SPA (Special Policy Area).</p>

<p>The first house in what would become Savile Row was &quot;a fine House and Ground&quot;,<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> built in 1674 on the site of what is now No. 1, and occupied by a series of ladies and earls until it was demolished in 1730 in preparation for the laying out of the houses on the east of Savile Row in 1731.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> Savile Row was built between 1731 and 1735, on freehold land known as Ten Acres belonging to a William Maddox, as part of the development of the <a href="Burlington_Estate" title="wikilink">Burlington Estate</a>, and is named after Lady Dorothy Savile, wife of the <a href="Richard_Boyle,_3rd_Earl_of_Burlington" title="wikilink">3rd Earl of Burlington</a>.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> Maddox's land, consisting mainly of fruit and other trees covering what would become Savile Row and the streets around, is still owned by his descendants as the Pollen Estate.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a><ref name="Sheppard 1963 442<U+2013>455&quot;/&gt;</p>

<p>Savile Row was extended to <a href="Conduit_Street" title="wikilink">Conduit Street</a> in 1937&lt;U+2013&gt;38, and by 1939 the Metropolitan Police Station was constructed on the corner of Boyle Street.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> This police station was damaged in a <a href="The_Blitz" title="wikilink">German bombing raid</a> of September 1940, during which the building opposite, No. 21a, was destroyed, as was No. 7 in an earlier raid that month.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a></p>

<p>Savile Row's reputation is built on <a href="bespoke" class="uri" title="wikilink">bespoke</a> tailoring, where each suit is made to individually fit. The term &quot;bespoke&quot; as applied to fine tailoring is understood to have originated in Savile Row,<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> and came to mean a suit cut and made by hand; however, after a ruling by the <a href="Advertising_Standards_Authority_(United_Kingdom)" title="wikilink">Advertising Standards Authority</a> in 2008, the term may now also be applied to machine sewed garments, provided they are &quot;made to measure&quot;.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> Suits, as at 2012, cost upwards of &lt;U+00A3&gt;2,000,<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a> and normally over &lt;U+00A3&gt;3,000,<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> depending on the cloth used.
