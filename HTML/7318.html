<h2 id="viewpoints">Viewpoints</h2>
<p>Null attacks many facets of mainstream medicine, arguing that physicians have an economic interest in promoting rather than preventing sickness. In the 1970s, Null co-authored a series of articles on cancer research for <em><a href="Penthouse_(magazine)" title="wikilink">Penthouse</a></em>, beginning with one entitled &quot;The Great Cancer Fraud.&quot;<ref>Null's articles on alternative cancer therapies in <em>Penthouse</em> include:</p>

<li><p></ref> In <em>Penthouse</em>, Null accused the medical community of &quot;suppressing alternative cancer treatments to protect the medical establishment's solid-gold cancer train.&quot; In place of standard medical therapy, Null advocated <a href="alternative_cancer_treatment" title="wikilink">alternative cancer treatments</a> such as <a href="hydrazine_sulfate" title="wikilink">hydrazine sulfate</a>. In 1999 <em><a href="Time_(magazine)" title="wikilink">TIME</a></em> wrote of Null's <a href="conspiracy_theory" title="wikilink">conspiracy claims</a>: &quot;From a young reporter this is to be expected. But two decades later, Null, 54, is still warning of a variety of medical bogeymen out to gull a trusting public.&quot;<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p></li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to his promotion of alternative cancer treatments, Null has argued that <a href="HIV" class="uri" title="wikilink">HIV</a> is harmless and does not cause <a href="AIDS" class="uri" title="wikilink">AIDS</a>.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> In his book <em>AIDS: A Second Opinion</em>, Null questioned the role of <a href="antiretroviral_medication" title="wikilink">antiretroviral medication</a> and instead advocated a range of <a href="dietary_supplement" title="wikilink">dietary supplements</a> for HIV-positive individuals. His book was criticized as &quot;massive, irresponsible and nearly unreadable&quot; by <a href="Salon.com" class="uri" title="wikilink">Salon.com</a>,<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> and <a href="Seth_Kalichman" title="wikilink">Seth Kalichman</a> cited Null as a prominent proponent of <a href="AIDS_denialism" title="wikilink">AIDS denialism</a>, cashing in on HIV/AIDS and repeating the claims of other denialists. Kalichman compared Null's activities to <a href="Holocaust_denial" title="wikilink">Holocaust denial</a> and stated that Null was an example of a dangerous entrepreneur who &quot;obviously breached&quot; the balance between free speech versus protecting <a href="public_health" title="wikilink">public health</a>.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<p>In 2009, Null was the keynote speaker at a rally opposing mandatory <a href="H1N1_influenza" title="wikilink">H1N1 influenza</a> vaccination during the <a href="2009_flu_pandemic" title="wikilink">2009 pandemic</a>, leading the state health department to dismiss Null's claims about the vaccine as &quot;not scientifically credible.&quot;<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="radio-and-video-work">Radio and video work</h2>
<p>Null began broadcasting a syndicated radio talk show, <em>Natural Living with Gary Null</em> in 1980. His show was broadcast first on <a href="WBAI" class="uri" title="wikilink">WBAI</a>, then on the VoiceAmerica Network and over the internet. Null's show subsequently returned to WBAI, leading to protests from <a href="AIDS_Coalition_to_Unleash_Power" title="wikilink">ACT-UP New York</a> and other AIDS activist groups concerned by Null's promotion of AIDS denialism.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a><a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<p>Null has made several self-funded and self-produced <a href="documentary_film" title="wikilink">documentary films</a> on <a href="public_policy" title="wikilink">public policy</a> issues, personal health, and development. His videos have been aired by <a href="PBS" class="uri" title="wikilink">PBS</a> during pledge drives, but concern arose within PBS over the videos' sensational claims. Ervin Duggan, the president of PBS, expressed concern that by showing Null's videos, the network was &quot;open[ing] the door to quacks and charlatans.&quot;<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> Null implied that his problems with PBS may have been an attempt to silence him, saying: &quot;The guardians of the gates of orthodoxy at PBS... you don't know who their friends are.&quot;<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="dietary-supplements-and-vitamin-poisoning">Dietary supplements and vitamin poisoning</h2>
<p>Null owns Gary Null &amp; Associates, a company that markets <a href="dietary_supplement" title="wikilink">dietary supplements</a>, as well as a health-food store in <a href="New_York_City" title="wikilink">New York City</a>.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> In 2010, Null claimed that he was sickened and nearly killed by his own dietary supplements.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a><a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a><a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> He filed suit against a contractor involved in producing the supplement, &quot;Gary Null's Ultimate Power Meal&quot;, claiming that the supplement contained 1,000 times the labeled dose of <a href="Vitamin_D" title="wikilink">Vitamin D</a> and that it had led to the hospitalizations of 6 consumers <a href="Hypervitaminosis_D" title="wikilink">poisoned by excessive doses of the vitamin</a>.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> Null reportedly suffered severe pain and kidney damage from &quot;Gary Null's Ultimate Power Meal&quot;, but continued consuming the supplement in the belief that it would relieve his symptoms.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a></p>
<p>The <em><a href="New_York_Post" title="wikilink">New York Post</a></em> noted that Null's near-death experience with his own supplement brand was &quot;not exactly a ringing endorsement.&quot;<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> The <em><a href="Los_Angeles_Times" title="wikilink">Los Angeles Times</a></em> wrote that Null's experience &quot;should give pause to anyone lured by the extravagant claims of many supplements makers&quot;, and noted that it was common for dietary supplements to contain doses &quot;wildly different than those indicated on their label&quot; as a result of <a href="Dietary_supplement#Regulation" title="wikilink">weak regulation</a>.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> Null's attorney cast the alleged vitamin poisoning as an isolated incident, saying: &quot;We don't want anything to affect the physical well-being of anyone or the reputation of the company.&quot;<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a></p>
