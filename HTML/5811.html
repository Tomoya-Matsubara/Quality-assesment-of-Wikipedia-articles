<p><strong>Zhang Heng</strong> () (AD 78&lt;U+2013&gt;139) was an <a href="Chinese_astronomy" title="wikilink">astronomer</a>, <a href="Chinese_mathematics" title="wikilink">mathematician</a>, <a href="List_of_Chinese_inventions" title="wikilink">inventor</a>, <a href="Chinese_geography" title="wikilink">geographer</a>, <a href="History_of_cartography#China" title="wikilink">cartographer</a>, <a href="Chinese_art" title="wikilink">artist</a>, <a href="Chinese_poetry" title="wikilink">poet</a>, <a href="Government_of_the_Han_Dynasty" title="wikilink">statesman</a>, and <a href="Chinese_literature" title="wikilink">literary scholar</a> from <a href="Nanyang,_Henan" title="wikilink">Nanyang</a>, <a href="Henan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Henan</a>, and lived during the <a href="Eastern_Han_Dynasty" title="wikilink">Eastern Han Dynasty</a> (AD 25&lt;U+2013&gt;220) of <a href="China" class="uri" title="wikilink">China</a>. He was educated in the capital cities of <a href="Luoyang" class="uri" title="wikilink">Luoyang</a> and <a href="Chang&#39;an" class="uri" title="wikilink">Chang'an</a>, and began his career as a minor civil servant in Nanyang. Eventually, he became Chief Astronomer, Prefect of the Majors for Official Carriages, and then Palace Attendant at the imperial court. His uncompromising stances on certain historical and calendrical issues led to Zhang being considered a controversial figure, which prevented him from becoming an official court historian. His political rivalry with the palace <a href="eunuch" title="wikilink">eunuchs</a> during the reign of <a href="Emperor_Shun_of_Han" title="wikilink">Emperor Shun</a> (r. 125&lt;U+2013&gt;144) led to his decision to retire from the central court to serve as an administrator of Hejian, in <a href="Hebei" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hebei</a>. He returned home to Nanyang for a short time, before being recalled to serve in the capital once more, in 138. He died there a year later, in 139.</p>
<p>Zhang applied his extensive knowledge of mechanics and gears in several of his inventions. He invented the world's first <a href="Hydraulics" title="wikilink">water-powered</a> <a href="armillary_sphere" title="wikilink">armillary sphere</a>, to represent astronomical observation;<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> improved the inflow <a href="water_clock" title="wikilink">water clock</a> by adding another tank;<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> and invented the world's first <a href="seismometer" class="uri" title="wikilink">seismometer</a>, which discerned the <a href="cardinal_direction" title="wikilink">cardinal direction</a> of an <a href="earthquake" class="uri" title="wikilink">earthquake</a>  away.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a><a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a><a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> Furthermore, he improved previous Chinese calculations of the formula for <a href="pi" class="uri" title="wikilink">pi</a>. In addition to documenting about 14,000 stars in his extensive <a href="star_catalogue" title="wikilink">star catalogue</a>, Zhang also posited theories about the <a href="Moon" class="uri" title="wikilink">Moon</a> and its relationship to the <a href="Sun" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sun</a>; specifically, he discussed the Moon's sphericity, its illumination by reflecting sunlight on one side and remaining dark on the other, and the nature of <a href="Solar_eclipse" title="wikilink">solar</a> and <a href="lunar_eclipse" title="wikilink">lunar</a> <a href="eclipse" title="wikilink">eclipses</a>. His <em><a href="Fu_(poetry)" title="wikilink">fu</a></em> (rhapsody) and <em><a href="Shi_(poetry)" title="wikilink">shi</a></em> poetry were renowned and commented on by later Chinese writers. Zhang received many posthumous honors for his scholarship and ingenuity, and is considered a <a href="polymath" class="uri" title="wikilink">polymath</a> by some scholars. Some modern scholars have also compared his work in astronomy to that of <a href="Ptolemy" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ptolemy</a> (AD 86&lt;U+2013&gt;161).</p>

<p>As Palace Attendant to Emperor Shun, Zhang Heng attempted to convince him that the court <a href="eunuch" title="wikilink">eunuchs</a> represented a threat to the imperial court.

<p>Zhang wrote about the various love affairs of emperors unsatisfied with the imperial harem, going out into the city incognito to seek out prostitutes and sing-song girls.

<blockquote>
<p>The Sun is like fire and the Moon like water. The fire gives out light and the water reflects it. Thus the moon's brightness is produced from the radiance of the Sun, and the Moon's darkness is due to (the light of) the sun being obstructed. The side which faces the Sun is fully lit, and the side which is away from it is dark. The planets (as well as the Moon) have the nature of water and reflect light. The light pouring forth from the Sun does not always reach the moon owing to the obstruction of the earth itself&lt;U+2014&gt;this is called 'an-xu', a lunar eclipse. When (a similar effect) happens with a planet (we call it) an occultation; when the Moon passes across (the Sun's path) then there is a solar eclipse.<a href="#fn150" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref150"><sup>150</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Zhang Heng viewed these astronomical phenomena in supernatural terms as well. The signs of comets, eclipses, and movements of heavenly bodies could all be interpreted by him as heavenly guides on how to conduct affairs of state.<a href="#fn151" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref151"><sup>151</sup></a> Contemporary writers also wrote about eclipses and the sphericity of heavenly bodies. The <a href="Music_theory" title="wikilink">music theorist</a> and mathematician <a href="Jing_Fang" title="wikilink">Jing Fang</a> (78&lt;U+2013&gt;37 BC) wrote about the spherical shape of the Sun and Moon while discussing eclipses:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Moon and the planets are Yin; they have shape but no light. This they receive only when the Sun illuminates them. The former masters regarded the Sun as round like a crossbow bullet, and they thought the Moon had the nature of a mirror. Some of them recognized the Moon as a ball too. Those parts of the Moon which the Sun illuminates look bright, those parts which it does not, remain dark.<a href="#fn152" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref152"><sup>152</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>What were the factors leading to the first escapement clock in China? The chief tradition leading to Yi Xing (725 AD) was of course the succession of 'pre-clocks' which had started with Zhang Heng about 125. Reason has been given for believing that these applied power to the slow turning movement of computational armillary spheres and celestial globes by means of a water-wheel using clepsydra drip, which intermittently exerted the force of a lug to act on the teeth of a wheel on a polar-axis shaft. Zhang Heng in his turn had composed this arrangement by uniting the armillary rings of his predecessors into the equatorial armillary sphere, and combining it with the principles of the water-mills and hydraulic trip-hammers which had become so widespread in Chinese culture in the previous century.<a href="#fn173" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref173"><sup>173</sup></a></p>

<p>The equatorial ring goes around the belly of the armillary sphere 91 and 5/19 (degrees) away from the pole. The circle of the ecliptic also goes round the belly of the instrument at an angle of 24 (degrees) with the equator. Thus at the summer solstice the ecliptic is 67 (degrees) and a fraction away from the pole, while at the winter solstice it is 115 (degrees) and a fraction away. Hence (the points) where the ecliptic and the equator intersect should give the north polar distances of the spring and autumn equinoxes. But now (it has been recorded that) the spring equinox is 90 and 1/4 (degrees) away from the pole, and the autumn equinox is 92 and 1/4 (degrees) away.

<p>From the earliest times, the Chinese were concerned with the destructive force of earthquakes.

<p>Zhang Heng is often credited with inventing the first <a href="odometer" class="uri" title="wikilink">odometer</a>,<a href="#fn224" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref224"><sup>224</sup></a><a href="#fn225" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref225"><sup>225</sup></a> an achievement also attributed to <a href="Archimedes" class="uri" title="wikilink">Archimedes</a> (c. 287&lt;U+2013&gt;212 BC) and <a href="Heron_of_Alexandria" title="wikilink">Heron of Alexandria</a> (fl. AD 10&lt;U+2013&gt;70). Similar devices were used by the <a href="Ancient_Rome" title="wikilink">Roman</a> and Han-Chinese empires at about the same period. By the 3rd century, the Chinese had termed the device the <em>ji li gu che</em>, or &quot;<a href="li_(unit)" title="wikilink">li</a>-recording drum carriage&quot; (the modern measurement of li = 500 m/1640 ft).<a href="#fn226" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref226"><sup>226</sup></a></p>

The <em>Song Shu</em> (c. 500 AD) records that Zhang Heng re-invented it from a model used in the Zhou Dynasty era, but the violent collapse of the Han Dynasty unfortunately did not allow it to be preserved.

<blockquote>
<p>Based on the theories of his predecessors, Zhang Heng systematically developed the celestial sphere theory. An armillary constructed on the basis of his hypotheses bears a remarkable similarity to Ptolemy's earth-centered theory. However, Zhang Heng did not definitely propose a theoretical model like Ptolemy's earth-centered one. It is astonishing that the celestial model Zhang Heng constructed was almost a physical model of Ptolemy's earth-centered theory. Only a single step separates the celestial globe from the earth-centered theory, but Chinese astronomers never took that step.</p>
<p>Here we can see how important the exemplary function of the primitive scientific structure is. In order to use the Euclidean system of geometry as a model for the development of astronomical theory, Ptolemy first had to select hypotheses which could serve as axioms. He naturally regarded circular motion as fundamental and then used the circular motion of deferents and epicycles in his earth-centered theory. Although Zhang Heng understood that the sun, moon and planets move in circles, he lacked a model for a logically structured theory and so could not establish a corresponding astronomical theory. Chinese astronomy was most interested in extracting the algebraic features of planetary motion (that is, the length of the cyclic periods) to establish astronomical theories. Thus astronomy was reduced to arithmetic operations, extracting common multiples and divisors from the observed cyclic motions of the heavenly bodies.<a href="#fn244" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref244"><sup>244</sup></a></p>

<h3 id="poetic-literature">Poetic literature</h3>
<p>Zhang's poetry was widely read during his life and after his death. In addition to the compilation of Xiao Tong mentioned above, the <a href="Eastern_Wu" title="wikilink">Eastern Wu</a> official <a href="Xue_Zong" title="wikilink">Xue Zong</a> (d. 237) wrote commentary on Zhang's poems &quot;Dongjing fu&quot; and &quot;Xijing fu&quot;.<a href="#fn245" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref245"><sup>245</sup></a> The influential poet Tao Qian wrote that he admired the poetry of Zhang Heng for its &quot;curbing extravagant diction and aiming at simplicity&quot;, in regards to perceived tranquility and rectitude correlating with the simple but effective language of the poet.<a href="#fn246" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref246"><sup>246</sup></a> Tao wrote that both Zhang Heng and Cai Yong &quot;avoided inflated language, aiming chiefly at simplicity&quot;, and adding that their &quot;compositions begin by giving free expression to their fancies but end on a note of quiet, serving admirably to restrain undisciplined and passionate nature&quot;.<a href="#fn247" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref247"><sup>247</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="posthumous-honors">Posthumous honors</h3>
<p>Zhang was given great honors in life and in death. The philosopher and poet <a href="Fu_Xuan" title="wikilink">Fu Xuan</a> (217&lt;U+2013&gt;278) of the <a href="Cao_Wei" title="wikilink">Wei</a> and <a href="Jin_Dynasty_(265&lt;U+2013&gt;420)" title="wikilink">Jin</a> dynasties once lamented in an essay over the fact that Zhang Heng was never placed in the <a href="Nine_Ministers" title="wikilink">Ministry of Works</a>. Writing highly of Zhang and the 3rd-century mechanical engineer Ma Jun, Fu Xuan wrote, &quot;Neither of them was ever an official of the Ministry of Works, and their ingenuity did not benefit the world. When (authorities) employ personnel with no regard to special talent, and having heard of genius neglect even to test it&lt;U+2014&gt;is this not hateful and disastrous?&quot;<a href="#fn248" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref248"><sup>248</sup></a></p>
<p>In honor of Zhang's achievements in science and technology, his friend Cui Ziyu (Cui Yuan) wrote a memorial inscription on his burial stele, which has been preserved in the <em>Guwen yuan</em>.<a href="#fn249" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref249"><sup>249</sup></a> Cui stated, &quot;[Zhang Heng's] mathematical computations exhausted (the riddles of) the heavens and the earth. His inventions were comparable even to those of the Author of Change. The excellence of his talent and the splendour of his art were one with those of the gods.&quot;<a href="#fn250" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref250"><sup>250</sup></a> The minor official Xiahou Zhan (243&lt;U+2013&gt;291) of the Wei Dynasty made an inscription for his own commemorative stele to be placed at Zhang Heng's tomb. It read: &quot;Ever since gentlemen have composed literary texts, none has been as skillful as the Master [Zhang Heng] in choosing his words well ... if only the dead could rise, oh I could then turn to him for a teacher!&quot;<a href="#fn251" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref251"><sup>251</sup></a></p>
