<p><strong>Tuition fees</strong> are a means of funding tuition to undergraduate and post graduate certificate students who study at universities in the United Kingdom. Following the publication of the <a href="Dearing_Report" title="wikilink">Dearing Report</a> into the future funding of higher education on 23 July 1997 then education secretary <a href="David_Blunkett" title="wikilink">David Blunkett</a> announced the introduction of means tested tuition fees to begin in September 1998 with students being required to pay up to &lt;U+00A3&gt;1000 a year for tuition.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a><a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2004/jan/27/tuitionfees.students">The Guardian - Timeline: Tuition fees</a></ref></p>
<p>Following devolution and the establishment of the <a href="Scottish_government" title="wikilink">Scottish government</a> tuition fees were abolished in Scotland with the Scottish parliament favouring a system of graduate endowment to pay for tuition.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> The endowment system, established as a means to pay for tuition only after graduation was later abolished with any students domiciled and studying in Scotland effectively not having to pay any fees towards their tuition at all as of 1 April 2007.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> The <a href="Welsh_Assembly" title="wikilink">Welsh Assembly</a>, because of its limited powers in comparison with their Scottish counterparts, remained with the caps imposed on the level of tuition as established by the United Kingdom government.

<h3 id="the-dearing-report">The Dearing Report</h3>
<p>In May 1996, Conservative Prime Minister <a href="John_Major" title="wikilink">John Major</a> commissioned an inquiry, led by <a href="Ronald_Dearing,_Baron_Dearing" title="wikilink">Sir Ron Dearing</a>, into the funding of British higher education over the next 20 years.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a><a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> Published on 23 July 1997, the Dearing report made 93 recommendations.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/politics97/news/07/0723/dearbrief.shtml">BBC Politics 97 | The Dearing Report</a></ref><a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> It estimated additional funding of almost &lt;U+00A3&gt;2 billion would be needed over the next 20 years, including &lt;U+00A3&gt;350 million in 1998-9 and &lt;U+00A3&gt;565 million in 1999-2000, in order to expand student enrollment, provide more support for part-time students and ensure an adequate infrastructure.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> <img src="John_Major,_October_2007.jpg" title="fig:John Major United Kingdom Prime Minister 1990-1997 commissioned an inquiry into the future of higher education funding." alt="John Major United Kingdom Prime Minister 1990-1997 commissioned an inquiry into the future of higher education funding." /></p>
<p>The inquiry favoured <a href="means_tested" title="wikilink">means tested</a> tuition fees and the continuation of the means tested maintenance grants as well as student loans. It recommended that graduates made a flat rate contribution of 25 percent of the cost of higher education tuition and that a mechanism for paying for this should be established by 1998-9.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> Following the publication of the report, the Labour education secretary <a href="David_Blunkett" title="wikilink">David Blunkett</a> announced the introduction of means tested tuition fees to begin in September 1998.

<p>The government issued a response entitled &quot;Higher Education in the 21st Century&quot; to the Dearing Report.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> It stated &quot;The Government plans to introduce an annual tuition fee of &lt;U+00A3&gt;1,000, representing about a quarter of the average cost of a course. Tuition will continue to be free for students from lower income families. Other full-time students will pay up to &lt;U+00A3&gt;1,000 per year depending on parental income. The cost of the fees will be balanced by increased loans for maintenance, also related to parental income. The overall effect will be that the total contribution required from the parents will be no greater than it is now.&quot;<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> <img src="David_Blunkett_-8April2010.jpg" title="fig:David Blunkett United Kingdom Secretary of State for Education and Employment 1997-2001 introduced tuition fees of &lt;U+00A3&gt;1000 a year." alt="David Blunkett United Kingdom Secretary of State for Education and Employment 1997-2001 introduced tuition fees of &lt;U+00A3&gt;1000 a year." /></p>
<h4 id="the-teaching-and-higher-education-act-1998">The Teaching and Higher Education Act 1998</h4>
<p>The teaching and higher education bill was passed into law on 16 July 1998. In addition to introducing tuition fees it established <a href="General_Teaching_Council_for_England" title="wikilink">General Teaching Councils in England</a> and Wales, introduced measures to reform the teaching profession and gave a provision for certain young workers to have time off for study.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/how_the_education_systems_work/legislation/134626.stm">BBC News | Teaching and Higher Education Act</a></ref> Prior to the passing of the act the <a href="House_of_Lords" title="wikilink">House of Lords</a> passed three successive amendments to the bill which would have meant that English, Welsh and Northern Irish students studying in Scotland would pay a total of &lt;U+00A3&gt;3,000 for a four year course to bring them in line with Scottish students.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> The amendments were overturned in the Commons but only after David Blunkett promised an independent review of tuition fees and how they operated in Scotland.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> The length of a typical honours degree in Scotland was four years compared to three years elsewhere in the United Kingdom. The difference presented a potential anomoly for when fees were introduced. It meant that students studying at Scottish universities would be charged an extra year of tuition fees compared with students studying a comparable course elsewhere in the UK. An independant review was led by Sir George Quigley, the Chairman of <a href="Ulster_Bank" title="wikilink">Ulster Bank</a>, looked into the issue and reported on 29 March 2000. It recommended that a fees concession should be given to students studying at Scottish universites in the final year of a four year honours degree, if they were domiciled in other parts of the UK. It also recommended that the cost of meeting this provision should be born by the newly established Scottish Executive. The recommendations of the report were accepted by the executive at an estimated cost of between &lt;U+00A3&gt;2.5 million and &lt;U+00A3&gt;3.2 million a year.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a><a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a></p>
<h5 id="payment-arrangements">Payment arrangements</h5>
<p>The act introduced a means-tested method of payment for students based on the amount of money their families earned. Students whose families earned less that &lt;U+00A3&gt;23,000 would be exempt from fees whilst those families earning between &lt;U+00A3&gt;23,000 and &lt;U+00A3&gt;35,000 a year would be charged a percentage of the fees on a sliding scale. Those families who earned over &lt;U+00A3&gt;35,000 a year would be charged the full fees which amounted to &lt;U+00A3&gt;1,000 a year.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> The maximum fees rose in line with inflation, reaching &lt;U+00A3&gt;1225 in 2007-08.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> Starting with 1999-2000, maintenance grants for living expenses would also be replaced with loans and paid back at a rate of 9 percent of a graduate's income above &lt;U+00A3&gt;10,000.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> All loans would be government funded and administered by the <a href="Student_Loans_Company" title="wikilink">Student Loans Company</a>, the organisation responsible for administering loans throughout the UK.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a><a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a></p>
<h4 id="reaction-to-the-introduction-of-tuition-fees">Reaction to the introduction of tuition fees</h4>
<p>The decision signalled the end of the principle of free higher education and was met with concern by some in the <a href="Labour_Party_(UK)" title="wikilink">Labour Party</a>. Former Labour education secretary <a href="Ted_Short" title="wikilink">Ted Short</a> said that he was ashamed to be a member of the party and <a href="Ken_Livingstone" title="wikilink">Ken Livingstone</a> accused ministers of &quot;whipping away a ladder of opportunity which they themselves had climbed&quot;.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/specials/the_state_of_education/86754.stm">BBC News | Student Tuition Fees - costly changes</a></ref> On the other side of the argument top universities in the United Kingdom actually wanted to raise tuition fees further so that they could compete more on the global stage.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a></ref> Some universities argued for a 'United States style' system with institutions being able to charge fees at whatever rate the 'market can bear'. Howard Newby, the President of the Committee of Vice-Chancellors and Principals said that the challenge for universities that wanted to introduce higher fees would be how to recycle the income to create bursaries for poorer students.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/643991.stm">BBC News | Blunkett feels tuition fees pressure</a></ref> Blunkett said that after the next general election it would be likely that there would be another debate on the issue revisiting the issue of university funding but that whilst he was Secretary of State there would be no top up fees.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> Howard Newby acknowledged that any further changes to the public funding of universities would need to wait &quot;until after the General Election&quot; although he added &quot;Afterwards, the question is how to bring more resources into higher education.

<h3 id="scottish-parliament">Scottish Parliament</h3>
<p>Following the passing of the <a href="Scotland_Act_1998" title="wikilink">Scotland Act 1998</a>, devolved government was established in Scotland with the first meeting of the new <a href="Scottish_Parliament" title="wikilink">Scottish Parliament</a> taking place on 12 May 1999.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> The parliament had been given 'primary legislative powers' meaning that over many areas elected representatives were able to pass their own laws.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/546315.stm">BBC News | A guide to devolved powers</a></ref> In particular its responsibilities included student fees, school standards and the training and supply of teachers.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a></p>
<h4 id="the-cubie-report">The Cubie Report</h4>
<p>University funding became an issue following <a href="Scottish_devolution" title="wikilink">Scottish devolution</a> when the Labour Party and <a href="Liberal_Democrats" title="wikilink">Liberal Democrats</a> formed a <a href="coalition_government" title="wikilink">coalition government</a>. The Liberal Democrats had made tuition fees a &quot;non-negotiable&quot; element of their election manifesto and therefore a potential stumbling block to forming the coalition. Labour, the majority party in the coalition had, only one year previously, introduced tuition fees in the United Kingdom of up to &lt;U+00A3&gt;1000 a year and had also abolished maintenance grants.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2000/jan/28/tuitionfees.highereducation">The Guardian | The Cubie report explained</a></ref> The Cubie committee led by the lawyer Andrew Cubie was formed in July 1999 to look into the funding of higher education in Scotland to try to find a solution to the issue of student financing which threatened to destabilize the coalition.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a></p>
<h5 id="recommendations-of-the-cubie-report">Recommendations of the Cubie report</h5>
<p>The Cubie report recommended that tuition fees should be replaced with an endowment scheme with the Scottish Executive paying the fees up front with students only required to pay back &lt;U+00A3&gt;3,000 worth of fees when their earnings reached &lt;U+00A3&gt;25,000. It also recommended that poorer students would be entitled to a bursary similar to the old maintenance grant.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a> The estimated cost to the Scottish government of the recommendations were set at &lt;U+00A3&gt;71 million. In the end the government announced that students would only pay back &lt;U+00A3&gt;2,000 of their fees but starting when their earnings reached &lt;U+00A3&gt;10,000 a significant drop on the recommended &lt;U+00A3&gt;25,000.<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> With such changes, the Scottish executive estimated that the scheme would cost &lt;U+00A3&gt;50 million.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a> <img src="Scotparialmentinside.jpg" title="fig:The Debating chamber of the Scottish Parliament.

<p>Speaking following the publication of the report the Liberal Democrats deputy first minister <a href="Jim_Wallace" title="wikilink">Jim Wallace</a> said &quot;we welcome the fact that Cubie recommends the abolition of tuition fees. This remains the party's policy... Andrew Cubie and his team have done a thorough job over the last six months.

The Conservatives <a href="Brian_Monteith" title="wikilink">Brian Monteith</a> was sceptical of the report saying &quot;the Cubie Committee says it is abolishing tuition fees but they will be replaced with a graduate tax that recovers exactly the same amount that would have been paid in fees.&quot;<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a> The findings of the report were considered by a joint ministerial working group established by Scottish First Minister <a href="Donald_Dewar" title="wikilink">Donald Dewar</a>.<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a> The abolition of tuition fees would commence in August 2000 with the endowment scheme taking their place the following year. Scottish students studying elsewhere in the United Kingdom would still be required to pay fees but Scottish students choosing to study in Scotland would not. English, Welsh and Northern Irish students studying in Scotland would be liable to pay tuition fees but would not be required to pay the graduate endowment. Students from outside the United Kingdom but from within the <a href="European_Union" title="wikilink">European Union</a> would not be required to pay tuition fees if studying in Scotland but would be required to pay the graduate endowment upon graduation.<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a> In order to qualify as a 'Scottish student' and be exempted from paying tuition fees, the student must have lived in Scotland for at least three years prior to the first day of the first academic year of the course. Students would also be exempt if they were classed as 'ordinarily resident' in the country on the first day of their course. This meant that those students who had moved to Scotland for a reason other than study would be also be exempt.<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a></p>

<p>Not all students had to pay. Those taking qualifications below degree level were exempt as were mature students over the age of 25, lone parents in receipt of a 'lone parent grant' and those in receipt of 'Disabled Student Allowance'. Students who dropped out of university would also not have to pay as they would be allowed 'one false start'.<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a> Certain courses, such as teacher training courses, were also exempt from the endowment.<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a></p>
<p>In the summer of 2007, the Scottish government proposed the 'Graduate Endowment Abolition (Scotland) Bill' that would scrap the graduate endowment altogether. It meant that no future students would pay the endowment and that would also apply to graduates who graduated on or after 1 April 2007.<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a> On 28 February 2008 the bill was approved in a move which restored free higher education in Scotland.

Under the Act, universities in England could begin to charge variable fees of up to &lt;U+00A3&gt;3000 a year for students enrolling on courses as from the academic year of 2006-07 or later. This was also introduced in Northern Ireland in 2006-07 and introduced in Wales in 2007-08.

The <a href="National_Union_of_Students_(United_Kingdom)" title="wikilink">National Union of Students</a>, who had staged the protests, condemned the violence as &quot;despicable&quot; with union president Aaron Porter saying &quot;this was not part of our plan&quot;.<a href="#fn136" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref136"><sup>136</sup></a> Protests continued on 24 November 2010 with the National Campaign Against Fees and Cuts (NCAFC) organising a mass national walk out of education and protest.<a href="#fn137" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref137"><sup>137</sup></a> Faced once again with protesters on the streets of London and having being caught out by the violence on the previous march, the Metropolitan police deployed over 1000 officers to police the demonstrations.<a href="#fn138" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref138"><sup>138</sup></a> A total of 41 people were arrested on the day with seven police officers and 11 members of the public suffering injuries.<a href="#fn139" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref139"><sup>139</sup></a> The police also came under fire for the practice of &quot;penning in&quot; protesters for long periods with Simon Hardy, the spokesperson for NCAFC describing the tactics as &quot;absolutely outrageous&quot;. He added, &quot;that we were stuck for five or six hours, not allowed to leave, intimidated by hundreds upon hundreds of riot police and treated very badly when all we were doing was exercising our democratic right to protest I think is a real scandal.&quot;<a href="#fn140" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref140"><sup>140</sup></a> <a href="Sir_Paul_Stephenson" title="wikilink">Sir Paul Stephenson</a>, the Metropolitan Police Commissioner, said however that the &quot;kettling&quot; was needed as there was a danger of protesters breaking through police lines and storming the Houses of Parliament.<a href="#fn141" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref141"><sup>141</sup></a> On 30 November 2010 further protests were held in London with demonstrators congregating in Trafalgar Square as well as in other cities around the UK.<a href="#fn142" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref142"><sup>142</sup></a> The protests in London resulted in 153 arrests and with the National Campaign Against Fees and Cuts accusing the police of pre-emptively &quot;blocking&quot; the protest route and so keeping them in the square. The police replied that they never had &quot;any intention to contain the protesters.&quot;<a href="#fn143" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref143"><sup>143</sup></a> On 9 December 2010, the day of the <a href="House_of_Commons_of_the_United_Kingdom" title="wikilink">House of Commons</a> vote on whether to approve measures which could see the rise in tuition fees, further demonstrations were held in London. The protests, this time policed by 2800 officers, saw tensions running high and angry scenes as the debate on the proposals was discussed in the Commons.<a href="#fn144" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref144"><sup>144</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="house-of-commons-vote">House of Commons vote</h3>
<p>On 9 December 2010, MPs approved raising the cap on tuition fees by a 323 to 302 vote. The result gave the Government a Commons majority of 21.<a href="#fn145" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref145"><sup>145</sup></a> The majority represented a substantial rebellion in the Government with the coalitions majority being cut by almost three quarters and with 21 Liberal Democrat and 6 Conservative MPs actually voting against the government.<a href="#fn146" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref146"><sup>146</sup></a> Amongst those voting no were former Lib Dem leaders <a href="Sir_Menzies_Campbell" title="wikilink">Sir Menzies Campbell</a> and <a href="Charles_Kennedy" title="wikilink">Charles Kennedy</a>.

<li id="fn29">The Independant review into the funding of tuition fees in Scotland (The Quigley Report) was established as part of the Teaching and Higher Education Act 1998 which introduced tuition fees in the UK. However following the passing of the Scotland Act 1998 devolved parliament was established in Scotland. The first meeting of the new Scottish executive was held on the 12 May 1999 with responsibility for tuition fees passing from the parliament in Westminster to Scotland. The Quigley report published on 29 March 2000 meant that it's recommendations were now the responsibility of the Scottish and not the Westminster governments <a href="http://www.parliament.the-stationery-office.co.uk/pa/cm200001/cmselect/cmeduemp/205/20512.htm">House of Commons - The Scottish Debate</a><a href="#fnref29" class="footnote-back">↩</a></li>
