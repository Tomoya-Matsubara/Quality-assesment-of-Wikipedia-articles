<p><strong>Tallgrass Technologies Corporation</strong> was the first manufacturer to offer a hard-drive product for the <a href="IBM" class="uri" title="wikilink">IBM</a> PC. It was a <a href="Kansas_City_metropolitan_area" title="wikilink">Kansas City</a> based microcomputer <a href="hardware" class="uri" title="wikilink">hardware</a> and <a href="software" class="uri" title="wikilink">software</a> company founded in December 1980 by David M. Allen. The product was initially sold in Computerland stores, alongside the original IBM PC. Tallgrass added tape-backup systems to its product line in 1982.</p>
<p>Tallgrass was significant in the history of the PC because IBM shipped its PCs for almost two years without any hard-drive option. The IBM name attracted the makers of larger, professional software products that required a hard-drive's speed and capacity. The availability of the Tallgrass hard-drives enabled those software products to make earlier entrances into the PC market. The parallel introductions, of the IBM PC with the Tallgrass hard-drive, catalyzed the growth of the PC market compared to what it would have been without the hard-drive.</p>
<p>Tallgrass was one of <a href="Seagate_Technology" title="wikilink">Seagate</a>'s earliest customers, initially purchasing <a href="ST-506" class="uri" title="wikilink">ST-506</a> drives from <a href="Shugart_Technology" title="wikilink">Shugart Technology</a> before the name changed to Seagate. The Tallgrass product was designed around the ST-506 hard drive, which required a separate controller between the drive and the computer (unlike hard drives today.) Tallgrass also briefly bought drives from <a href="Texas_Instruments" title="wikilink">Texas Instruments</a>.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> Later, Tallgrass bought most of its drives from <a href="Miniscribe" class="uri" title="wikilink">Miniscribe</a> and for a while was Miniscribe's largest customer.</p>
<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<p>While at a previous employer, Allen developed a <a href="Group_Code_Recording" title="wikilink">GCR</a>-encoded, 100%-digital floppy-drive controller and prototype hard-drive controller using an unusual data-separator he had patented.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> During the recession in 1980, he left in December to form Tallgrass, with his former employer's permission to take the controller designs with him. Tallgrass' initial revenue stream in 1981 was provided by a contract with SofTech Microsystems for development of a 68000 interpreter for the <a href="UCSD_Pascal" title="wikilink">UCSD Pascal</a> software system. Allen had previously written the 6809 interpreter for UCSD Pascal, before starting Tallgrass.</p>
<p>By the spring of 1981 the hard drive controller design was complete. Tallgrass initially tried marketing Allen's unorthodox hard-drive controller alone, to system manufacturers. In mid-1981 it was decided to instead market a complete, external hard-drive subsystem (hard-drive + controller) to computer dealers. Tallgrass first developed subsystems for the <a href="Xerox_820" title="wikilink">Xerox 820</a> computer, an <a href="Alpha_Microsystems" title="wikilink">Alpha Microsystems</a> computer, and was working on an <a href="Apple_IIe" title="wikilink">Apple IIe</a> version when IBM announced the PC in August 1981.</p>
<p>Tallgrass was able to supply its product for the PC, in production quantities, at the same moment that IBM started revenue shipments of PCs in October. This was because Tallgrass' product was already in production and needed only a simple interface card and PCDOS driver software to attach it to the IBM PC.</p>
<p>Allen discovered they already had the PCDOS driver. As part of the development of its subsystem for the Alpha Microsystems computer, Tallgrass developed a driver for <a href="Seattle_Computer_Products" title="wikilink">Seattle Computer Products</a>' &quot;Seattle-DOS&quot; (86-DOS)<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> operating system. <a href="86-DOS" class="uri" title="wikilink">86-DOS</a> was renamed PCDOS when Bill Gates bought the rights and licensed it to IBM.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>A partner in the local, Lenexa, Kansas Computerland store, Jim Fricke<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a>, gave Allen access to their IBM PC demonstrator when it arrived on a Friday, a few weeks before IBM's PCs were available for sale. With information gleaned from the demonstrator, Allen built a prototype interface card over the weekend and successfully tested the card and the driver on the following Monday. The same Computerland store's other partner, Bruce Burdick, was a member of Computerland's New Products Committee and helped get the Tallgrass product embraced by Computerland nationwide.</p>
<p>With IBM's entry into the market, Allen invited a friend, Steven B. Volk<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a><a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> to join Tallgrass as Executive V.P. of Sales and Marketing. Volk assembled a sales organization and started an advertising campaign, initially incorporating pictures of scarlet macaws that he and his wife raised in their basement.</p>
<p>With the support of Computerland and helped by high gross margins of up to 35%, Tallgrass grew very rapidly. Early in 1982 a tape backup product was added to the product line, another first for PCs, using an out-sourced <a href="Archive_Corp." title="wikilink">Archive Corp.</a> tape drive and 3M cartridges. Manufacturing cost was low because the unorthodox controller design was shared by both disk and tape and, being all digital, it was easily reduced to a single LSI microchip. Gross revenue peaked in mid-1985 at an annualized rate of $70M and there were 400 employees at the start 1986.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> By this time significant competition had arrived in the marketplace and Tallgrass' sales had plateaued.</p>
<p>In an attempt to revive sales growth with an enlarged marketing push, Allen accepted the overtures of venture capital. In mid-1986, Gateway Associates L.P. in St. Louis took the lead and brought in the major investor, Reimer and Koger Assoc., pension advisor for KPERS (the Kansas Public Employees Retirement System.) Sales continued to falter and profits sagged while management and investors disagreed over a course of action.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<p>In mid-1987 the investors forced Allen out and took control of the company.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> Volk left later the same year to go to PrairieTek.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> Allen brought the investors a $4M buyout offer from a California competitor. A letter of intent was signed in July but allowed to expire in August.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a><a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> By November 1987 the investments reportedly totaled $7M, employment was down to 130, and annual sales revenue far below $40M.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a>  After a six-year succession of presidents and additional investments, the last management team reversed Tallgrass's downward spiral and returned the company to profitability though innovative channel management; developing new core competencies; introducing new, innovative products; adopting proven business strategies; and though optimizing and automating company operations. With a revitalized company, but with growth crippled by overwhelming legacy debt, Tallgrass had 1992 sales of $9.3M and was &quot;said to be profitable.&quot;<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> In 1993 the investors sold what was left of Tallgrass to Exabyte Corp. for $1.5M.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> By that time, KPERS investments in Tallgrass totaled over $14M.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
<p>After minor investments by Exabyte and retaining Tallgrass's last management team, the Tallgrass portion of their portfolio immediately doubled revenues while maintaining lucrative channel margins.</p>
<p>Not long after the acquisition, Exabyte sold the &quot;Tallgrass Technologies&quot; name to the former Tallgrass V.P. of International Sales, Jim Worrell,<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> who then renamed his own import/export company using the Tallgrass name. Today his company has new ownership and a different charter but continues operating under the <a href="http://www.tallgrasstech.com">Tallgrass Technologies LLC</a> name.</p>
<p>Following Allen's ouster in 1987, he and Tallgrass' former R&amp;D Manager, V. Perry Watson,<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> formed a new company, <a href="http://www.dashkc.com">Dash</a>, to distribute PC parts and systems to resellers.</p>
