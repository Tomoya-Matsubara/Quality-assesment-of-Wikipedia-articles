<p><strong>Lyme disease</strong> (<strong><em>Lyme borreliosis</em></strong>) is an infectious disease caused by at least three <a href="species" class="uri" title="wikilink">species</a> of <a href="bacteria" class="uri" title="wikilink">bacteria</a> belonging to the <a href="genus" class="uri" title="wikilink">genus</a> <em><a href="Borrelia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Borrelia</a></em>.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a><a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a><a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> <em><a href="Borrelia_burgdorferi" title="wikilink">Borrelia burgdorferi</a> <a href="sensu_stricto" title="wikilink">sensu stricto</a></em><a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> is the main cause of Lyme disease in <a href="North_America" title="wikilink">North America</a>, whereas <em><a href="Borrelia_afzelii" title="wikilink">Borrelia afzelii</a></em> and <em><a href="Borrelia_garinii" title="wikilink">Borrelia garinii</a></em> cause most <a href="Europe" title="wikilink">European</a> cases. The disease is named after the towns of <a href="Lyme,_Connecticut" title="wikilink">Lyme</a> and <a href="Old_Lyme,_Connecticut" title="wikilink">Old Lyme, Connecticut</a>, US, where a number of cases were identified in 1975. Although it was known that Lyme disease was a <a href="tick-borne_disease" title="wikilink">tick-borne disease</a> as far back as 1978, the cause of the disease remained a mystery until 1981, when <em>B. burgdorferi</em> was identified by <a href="Willy_Burgdorfer" title="wikilink">Willy Burgdorfer</a>.</p>

<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<p>The evolutionary history of <em>Borrelia burgdorferi</em> genetics has been the subject of recent studies. One study has found that prior to the <a href="reforestation" class="uri" title="wikilink">reforestation</a> that accompanied post colonial farm abandonment in <a href="New_England" title="wikilink">New England</a> and the wholesale migration into the <a href="mid-west" class="uri" title="wikilink">mid-west</a> that occurred during the early 19th century, Lyme disease was present for thousands of years in America and had spread along with its tick hosts from the Northeast to the Midwest.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<p>John Josselyn, who visited New England in 1638 and again from 1663&lt;U+2013&gt;1670, wrote &quot;there be infinite numbers of tikes hanging upon the bushes in summer time that will cleave to man's garments and creep into his breeches eating themselves in a short time into the very flesh of a man. I have seen the stockins of those that have gone through the woods covered with them.&quot;<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<p>This is also confirmed by the writings of <a href="Peter_Kalm" title="wikilink">Peter Kalm</a>, a Swedish botanist who was sent to America by <a href="Linnaeus" class="uri" title="wikilink">Linnaeus</a>, and who found the forests of New York &quot;abound&quot; with ticks when he visited in 1749. When Kalm's journey was retraced 100 years later, the forests were gone and the Lyme bacterium had probably become isolated to a few pockets along the northeast coast, Wisconsin, and Minnesota.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<p>Perhaps the first detailed description of what is now known as Lyme disease appeared in the writings of <a href="Reverend_Dr_John_Walker" title="wikilink">Reverend Dr John Walker</a> after a visit to the <a href="Island_of_Jura" title="wikilink">Island of Jura</a> (Deer Island) off the west coast of Scotland in 1764.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> He gives a good description both of the symptoms of Lyme disease (with &quot;exquisite pain [in] the interior parts of the limbs&quot;) and of the tick vector itself, which he describes as a &quot;worm&quot; with a body which is &quot;of a reddish colour and of a compressed shape with a row of feet on each side&quot; that &quot;penetrates the skin&quot;. Many people from this area of Great Britain immigrated to North America between 1717 and the end of the 18th century.</p>
<p>The examination of preserved museum specimens has found <em>Borrelia</em> DNA in an infected <em><a href="Ixodes_ricinus" title="wikilink">Ixodes ricinus</a></em> tick from Germany that dates back to 1884, and from an infected mouse from Cape Cod that died in 1894.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> The 2010 autopsy of <a href="&lt;U+00D6&gt;tzi_the_Iceman" title="wikilink">&lt;U+00D6&gt;tzi the Iceman</a>, a 5,300-year-old <a href="mummy" class="uri" title="wikilink">mummy</a>, revealed the presence of the DNA sequence of <em>Borrelia burgdorferi</em> making him the earliest known human with Lyme disease.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
<p>The early European studies of what is now known as Lyme disease described its skin manifestations. The first study dates to 1883 in <a href="Breslau" class="uri" title="wikilink">Breslau</a>, Germany (now <a href="Wroc&lt;U+0142&gt;aw" class="uri" title="wikilink">Wroc&lt;U+0142&gt;aw</a>, <a href="Poland" class="uri" title="wikilink">Poland</a>), where physician Alfred Buchwald described a man who had suffered for 16 years with a degenerative <a href="skin_disorder" title="wikilink">skin disorder</a> now known as <a href="acrodermatitis_chronica_atrophicans" title="wikilink">acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans</a>.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="th-century">20th century</h3>
<p>At a 1909 research conference, Swedish dermatologist <a href="Arvid_Afzelius" title="wikilink">Arvid Afzelius</a> presented a study about an expanding, ring-like lesion he had observed in an older woman following the bite of a sheep tick. He named the lesion <em>erythema migrans</em>.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> The skin condition now known as <a href="borrelial_lymphocytoma" title="wikilink">borrelial lymphocytoma</a> was first described in 1911.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>
<p>Neurological problems following tick bites were recognized starting in the 1920s. French physicians Garin and Bujadoux described a farmer with a painful sensory <a href="radiculitis" class="uri" title="wikilink">radiculitis</a> accompanied by mild <a href="meningitis" class="uri" title="wikilink">meningitis</a> following a tick bite. A large, ring-shaped rash was also noted, although the doctors did not relate it to the meningoradiculitis. In 1930, the Swedish dermatologist Sven Hellerstr&lt;U+00F6&gt;m was the first to propose EM and neurological symptoms following a tick bite were related.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> In the 1940s, German neurologist <a href="Alfred_Bannwarth" title="wikilink">Alfred Bannwarth</a> described several cases of chronic lymphocytic meningitis and polyradiculoneuritis, some of which were accompanied by erythematous skin lesions.</p>
<p>Carl Lennhoff, who worked at the <a href="Karolinska_Institute" title="wikilink">Karolinska Institute</a> in Sweden, believed many skin conditions were caused by spirochetes. In 1948, he used a special stain to microscopically observe what he believed were spirochetes in various types of skin lesions, including EM (erythema migrans).<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> Although his conclusions were later shown to be erroneous, interest in the study of spirochetes was sparked. In 1949, Nils Thyresson, who also worked at the Karolinska Institute, was the first to treat ACA with penicillin.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> In the 1950s, the relationship among tick bite, lymphocytoma, EM and Bannwarth's syndrome was recognized throughout Europe leading to the widespread use of <a href="penicillin" class="uri" title="wikilink">penicillin</a> for treatment in Europe.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a><a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1970, a dermatologist in <a href="Wisconsin" class="uri" title="wikilink">Wisconsin</a> named Rudolph Scrimenti recognized an EM lesion in a patient after recalling a paper by Hellerstr&lt;U+00F6&gt;m that had been reprinted in an American science journal in 1950. This was the first documented case of EM in the United States. Based on the European literature, he treated the patient with penicillin.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a></p>
<p>The full <a href="syndrome" class="uri" title="wikilink">syndrome</a> now known as Lyme disease was not recognized until a cluster of cases originally thought to be <a href="juvenile_rheumatoid_arthritis" title="wikilink">juvenile rheumatoid arthritis</a> was identified in three towns in southeastern <a href="Connecticut" class="uri" title="wikilink">Connecticut</a> in 1975, including the towns <a href="Lyme,_Connecticut" title="wikilink">Lyme</a> and <a href="Old_Lyme" title="wikilink">Old Lyme</a>, which gave the disease its popular name.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> This was investigated by physicians David Snydman and <a href="Allen_Steere" title="wikilink">Allen Steere</a> of the <a href="Epidemic_Intelligence_Service" title="wikilink">Epidemic Intelligence Service</a>, and by others from <a href="Yale_University" title="wikilink">Yale University</a>, including Dr. <a href="Stephen_Malawista" title="wikilink">Stephen Malawista</a>, who is credited as a co-discover of the disease.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> The recognition that the patients in the United States had EM led to the recognition that &quot;Lyme arthritis&quot; was one manifestation of the same tick-borne condition known in Europe.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a></p>
<p>Before 1976, elements of <em>B. burgdorferi sensu lato</em> infection were called or known as tick-borne meningopolyneuritis, Garin-Bujadoux syndrome, Bannwarth syndrome, Afzelius' disease,<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> <a href="Montauk,_New_York" title="wikilink">Montauk Knee</a> or sheep tick fever. Since 1976 the disease is most often referred to as Lyme disease,<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a><a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> Lyme borreliosis or simply borreliosis.</p>
<p>In 1980, Steere, <em>et al.</em>, began to test <a href="antibiotics" title="wikilink">antibiotic</a> regimens in adult patients with Lyme disease.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> In the same year, New York State Health Dept. epidemiologist <a href="Jorge_Benach" title="wikilink">Jorge Benach</a> provided <a href="Willy_Burgdorfer" title="wikilink">Willy Burgdorfer</a>, a researcher at the <a href="Rocky_Mountain_Biological_Laboratory" title="wikilink">Rocky Mountain Biological Laboratory</a>, with collections of <em>I. dammini</em> [<em>scapularis</em>] from Shelter Island, NY, a known Lyme-endemic area as part of an ongoing investigation of Rocky Mountain spotted fever. In examining the ticks for rickettsiae, Burgdorfer noticed &quot;poorly stained, rather long, irregularly coiled spirochetes.&quot; Further examination revealed spirochetes in 60% of the ticks. Burgdorfer credited his familiarity with the European literature for his realization that the spirochetes might be the &quot;long-sought cause of ECM and Lyme disease.&quot; Benach supplied him with more ticks from Shelter Island and <a href="Blood_serum" title="wikilink">sera</a> from patients diagnosed with Lyme disease. University of Texas Health Science Center researcher Alan Barbour &quot;offered his expertise to culture and immunochemically characterize the organism.&quot; Burgdorfer subsequently confirmed his discovery by isolating, from patients with Lyme disease, spirochetes identical to those found in ticks.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> In June 1982, he published his findings in <a href="Science_(journal)" title="wikilink">Science</a>, and the spirochete was named <em>Borrelia burgdorferi</em> in his honor.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a></p>
<p>After the identification of <em>B. burgdorferi</em> as the causative agent of Lyme disease, antibiotics were selected for testing, guided by <em>in vitro</em> antibiotic sensitivities, including <a href="tetracycline_antibiotics" title="wikilink">tetracycline antibiotics</a>, <a href="amoxicillin" class="uri" title="wikilink">amoxicillin</a>, <a href="cefuroxime_axetil" title="wikilink">cefuroxime axetil</a>, intravenous and intramuscular penicillin and intravenous <a href="ceftriaxone" class="uri" title="wikilink">ceftriaxone</a>.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a><a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> The mechanism of tick transmission was also the subject of much discussion. <em>B. burgdorferi</em> spirochetes were identified in tick saliva in 1987, confirming the hypothesis that transmission occurred via tick salivary glands.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a></p>
<p>Jonathan Edlow, Professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School, quotes the late Ed Masters (discoverer of <a href="Southern_tick-associated_rash_illness" title="wikilink">STARI</a>, a Lyme-like illness) in his book <em>Bull's-Eye</em>, on the history of Lyme disease. Edlow writes:</p>

Not all patients with Lyme disease will have all symptoms, and many of the symptoms are not specific to Lyme disease, but can occur with other diseases as well. The <a href="incubation_period" title="wikilink">incubation period</a> from infection to the onset of symptoms is usually one to two weeks, but can be much shorter (days), or much longer (months to years).<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a></p>
<p>Symptoms most often occur from May through September, because the nymphal stage of the tick is responsible for most cases.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> <a href="Asymptomatic" class="uri" title="wikilink">Asymptomatic</a> infection exists, but occurs in less than 7% of infected individuals in the United States.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> Asymptomatic infection may be much more common among those infected in Europe.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a><a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="early-localized-infection">Early localized infection</h3>
<p>Early localized infection is where the Lyme disease has not yet spread throughout the body. The only area affected is where the infection has first come into contact with the skin. The classic sign of early local infection with Lyme disease is a circular, outwardly expanding rash called <a href="erythema_chronicum_migrans" title="wikilink">erythema chronicum migrans</a> (also erythema migrans or EM), which occurs at the site of the tick bite three to thirty days after the tick bite.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a><a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a> The rash is red, and may be warm, but is generally painless. Classically, the innermost portion remains dark red and becomes <a href="induration" title="wikilink">indurated</a> (is thicker and firmer); the outer edge remains red; and the portion in between clears, giving the appearance of a <a href="Bullseye_(target)" title="wikilink">bullseye</a>. However, partial clearing is uncommon, and the bullseye pattern more often involves central redness.<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a></p>
<p>The erythema migrans rash associated with early infection is found in approximately 80% of patients and can have a range of appearances including the classic target bull's-eye lesion and nontarget appearing lesions. The 20% without the erythema migrans and the nontarget lesions can often cause mis-identification of Lyme disease.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a></p>
<p>EM is thought to occur in about 80% of infected patients.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a> Patients can also experience <a href="flu-like_symptoms" title="wikilink">flu-like symptoms</a>, such as <a href="headache" class="uri" title="wikilink">headache</a>, <a href="muscle_soreness" title="wikilink">muscle soreness</a>, <a href="fever" class="uri" title="wikilink">fever</a>, and <a href="malaise" class="uri" title="wikilink">malaise</a>.<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a> Lyme disease can progress to later stages even in patients who do not develop a rash.<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a><a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="early-disseminated-infection">Early disseminated infection</h3>
<p>Within days to weeks after the onset of local infection, the <em><a href="Borrelia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Borrelia</a></em> bacteria may begin to spread through the bloodstream.

<h3 id="late-disseminated-infection"> Late disseminated infection</h3>
<p>After several months, untreated or inadequately treated patients may go on to develop severe and chronic symptoms that affect many parts of the body, including the brain, nerves, eyes, joints and heart. Many disabling symptoms can occur, including permanent <a href="paraparesis" class="uri" title="wikilink">paraparesis</a> (impairment of motor or sensory function of the lower extremities) in extreme cases.<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a> The associated nerve pain radiating out from the spine is termed Bannwarth syndrome<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a> named after <a href="Alfred_Bannwarth" title="wikilink">Alfred Bannwarth</a>.</p>
<p>The late disseminated stage is where the infection has fully spread throughout the body.

<h3 id="transmission">Transmission</h3>
<p>Lyme disease is classified as a <a href="zoonosis" class="uri" title="wikilink">zoonosis</a>, as it is transmitted to humans from a <a href="natural_reservoir" title="wikilink">natural reservoir</a> among rodents by <a href="tick" title="wikilink">ticks</a> that feed on both sets of <a href="Host_(biology)" title="wikilink">hosts</a>.<a href="#fn73" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref73"><sup>73</sup></a> Hard-bodied ticks of the genus <em><a href="Ixodes" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ixodes</a></em> are the main <a href="Vector_(epidemiology)" title="wikilink">vectors</a> of Lyme disease (also the vector for <em><a href="Babesia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Babesia</a></em>).<a href="#fn74" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref74"><sup>74</sup></a> Most infections are caused by ticks in the <a href="Nymph_(biology)" title="wikilink">nymphal stage</a>, as they are very small and may feed for long periods of time undetected.<a href="#fn75" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref75"><sup>75</sup></a> Larval ticks are very rarely infected.<a href="#fn76" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref76"><sup>76</sup></a> Although deer are the preferred hosts of deer ticks, and the size of the tick population parallels that of the deer population, ticks cannot acquire lyme disease spirochetes from deer.

<p>Within the tick midgut, the borrelia's outer surface protein A (OspA) binds to the tick receptor for OspA, known as TROSPA. When the tick feeds, the borrelia downregulate OspA and upregulate OspC, another surface protein. After the borrelia migrate from the midgut to the salivary glands, OspC binds to Salp15, a tick salivary protein that appears to have immunosuppressive effects that enhance infection.<a href="#fn78" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref78"><sup>78</sup></a> Successful infection of the mammalian host depends on bacterial expression of OspC.<a href="#fn79" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref79"><sup>79</sup></a></p>
<p>Tick bites often go unnoticed because of the small size of the tick in its nymphal stage, as well as tick secretions that prevent the host from feeling any itch or pain from the bite. However, transmission is quite rare, with only about 1% of recognized tick bites resulting in Lyme disease. Transmission may occur within 24 hours of the tick bite.<a href="#fn80" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref80"><sup>80</sup></a></p>

<h3 id="tick-borne-coinfections">Tick-borne coinfections</h3>
<p>Ticks that transmit <em>B. burgdorferi</em> to humans can also carry and transmit several other parasites, such as <em><a href="Theileria_microti" title="wikilink">Theileria microti</a></em> and <em><a href="Anaplasma_phagocytophilum" title="wikilink">Anaplasma phagocytophilum</a></em>, which cause the diseases <a href="babesiosis" class="uri" title="wikilink">babesiosis</a> and <a href="human_granulocytic_anaplasmosis" title="wikilink">human granulocytic anaplasmosis</a> (HGA), respectively.<a href="#fn98" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref98"><sup>98</sup></a> Among early Lyme disease patients, depending on their location, 2&lt;U+2013&gt;12% will also have HGA and 2&lt;U+2013&gt;40% will have babesiosis.<a href="#fn99" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref99"><sup>99</sup></a> Ticks in certain regions, including the lands along the eastern Baltic Sea, also transmit <a href="tick-borne_encephalitis" title="wikilink">tick-borne encephalitis</a>.<a href="#fn100" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref100"><sup>100</sup></a></p>
<p>Coinfections complicate Lyme symptoms, especially diagnosis and treatment.

The <a href="Centers_for_Disease_Control" title="wikilink">Centers for Disease Control</a> studied 100 ticks in rural <a href="New_Jersey" title="wikilink">New Jersey</a>, and found 55% of the ticks were infected with at least one of the pathogens.<a href="#fn101" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref101"><sup>101</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="pathophysiology">Pathophysiology</h2>
<p><em>Borrelia burgdorferi</em> can spread throughout the body during the course of the disease, and has been found in the skin, heart, joint, peripheral nervous system, and central nervous system.<a href="#fn102" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref102"><sup>102</sup></a><a href="#fn103" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref103"><sup>103</sup></a> Many of the signs and symptoms of Lyme disease are a consequence of the immune response to the spirochete in those tissues.<a href="#fn104" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref104"><sup>104</sup></a></p>
<p><em>B. burgdorferi</em> is injected into the skin by the bite of an infected <em>Ixodes</em> tick. Tick saliva, which accompanies the spirochete into the skin during the feeding process, contains substances that disrupt the immune response at the site of the bite.<a href="#fn105" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref105"><sup>105</sup></a> This provides a protective environment where the spirochete can establish infection. The spirochetes multiply and migrate outward within the <a href="dermis" class="uri" title="wikilink">dermis</a>. The host inflammatory response to the bacteria in the skin causes the characteristic circular EM lesion.<a href="#fn106" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref106"><sup>106</sup></a> <a href="Neutrophils" class="uri" title="wikilink">Neutrophils</a>, however, which are necessary to eliminate the spirochetes from the skin, fail to appear in the developing EM lesion. This allows the bacteria to survive and eventually spread throughout the body.<a href="#fn107" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref107"><sup>107</sup></a></p>
<p>Days to weeks following the tick bite, the spirochetes spread via the bloodstream to joints, heart, nervous system, and distant skin sites, where their presence gives rise to the variety of symptoms of disseminated disease. The spread of <em>B. burgdorferi</em> is aided by the attachment of the host protease <a href="plasmin" class="uri" title="wikilink">plasmin</a> to the surface of the spirochete.<a href="#fn108" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref108"><sup>108</sup></a></p>
<p>If untreated, the bacteria may persist in the body for months or even years, despite the production of <em>B. burgdorferi</em> antibodies by the immune system.<a href="#fn109" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref109"><sup>109</sup></a> The spirochetes may avoid the immune response by decreasing expression of surface proteins that are targeted by antibodies, <a href="antigenic_variation" title="wikilink">antigenic variation</a> of the VlsE surface protein, inactivating key immune components such as <a href="Complement_system" title="wikilink">complement</a>, and hiding in the <a href="extracellular_matrix" title="wikilink">extracellular matrix</a>, which may interfere with the function of immune factors.<a href="#fn110" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref110"><sup>110</sup></a><a href="#fn111" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref111"><sup>111</sup></a></p>
<p>In the brain, <em>B. burgdorferi</em> may induce <a href="astrocytes" class="uri" title="wikilink">astrocytes</a> to undergo astrogliosis (proliferation followed by <a href="apoptosis" class="uri" title="wikilink">apoptosis</a>), which may contribute to neurodysfunction.<a href="#fn112" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref112"><sup>112</sup></a> The spirochetes may also induce host cells to secrete products toxic to nerve cells, including <a href="quinolinic_acid" title="wikilink">quinolinic acid</a> and the <a href="cytokines" class="uri" title="wikilink">cytokines</a> IL-6 and TNF-alpha, which can produce <a href="Fatigue_(medical)" title="wikilink">fatigue</a> and <a href="malaise" class="uri" title="wikilink">malaise</a>.<a href="#fn113" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref113"><sup>113</sup></a><a href="#fn114" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref114"><sup>114</sup></a><a href="#fn115" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref115"><sup>115</sup></a> Both <a href="microglia" class="uri" title="wikilink">microglia</a> and astrocytes secrete IL-6 and TNF-alpha in the presence of the spirochete.<a href="#fn116" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref116"><sup>116</sup></a><a href="#fn117" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref117"><sup>117</sup></a> This cytokine response may contribute to cognitive impairment.<a href="#fn118" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref118"><sup>118</sup></a></p>
<p>In Lyme <a href="encephalopathy" class="uri" title="wikilink">encephalopathy</a>, diffuse white matter pathology can disrupt <a href="grey_matter" title="wikilink">grey matter</a> connections, and could account for deficits in attention, memory, visuospatial ability, complex cognition, and emotional status. White matter disease may have a greater potential for recovery than gray matter disease, perhaps because neuronal loss is less common. Resolution of MRI white matter hyperintensities after antibiotic treatment has been observed.<a href="#fn119" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref119"><sup>119</sup></a></p>
<p>A developing hypothesis is that the chronic secretion of <a href="Stress_(medicine)" title="wikilink">stress</a> <a href="hormone" title="wikilink">hormones</a> as a result of <em>Borrelia</em> infection may reduce the effect of <a href="neurotransmitter" title="wikilink">neurotransmitters</a>, or other <a href="Receptor_(biochemistry)" title="wikilink">receptors</a> in the brain by cell-mediated proinflammatory pathways, thereby leading to the dysregulation of neurohormones, specifically <a href="glucocorticoids" class="uri" title="wikilink">glucocorticoids</a> and <a href="catecholamines" class="uri" title="wikilink">catecholamines</a>, the major stress hormones.<a href="#fn120" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref120"><sup>120</sup></a><a href="#fn121" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref121"><sup>121</sup></a></p>
<p>This process is mediated via the <a href="hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal_axis" title="wikilink">hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis</a>. Additionally <a href="tryptophan" class="uri" title="wikilink">tryptophan</a>, a precursor to <a href="serotonin" class="uri" title="wikilink">serotonin</a>, appears to be reduced within the <a href="central_nervous_system" title="wikilink">central nervous system</a> (CNS) in a number of infectious diseases that affect the brain, including Lyme.<a href="#fn122" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref122"><sup>122</sup></a> Researchers are investigating if this neurohormone secretion is the cause of <a href="Neuropsychiatry" title="wikilink">neuropsychiatric</a> disorders developing in some patients with borreliosis.<a href="#fn123" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref123"><sup>123</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="immunological-studies">Immunological studies</h3>
<p>Exposure to the <em>Borrelia</em> bacterium during Lyme disease possibly causes a long-lived and damaging <a href="inflammatory_response" title="wikilink">inflammatory response</a>,<a href="#fn124" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref124"><sup>124</sup></a> a form of pathogen-induced <a href="autoimmune" class="uri" title="wikilink">autoimmune</a> disease.<a href="#fn125" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref125"><sup>125</sup></a> The production of this reaction might be due to a form of <a href="molecular_mimicry" title="wikilink">molecular mimicry</a>, where <em>Borrelia</em> avoid being killed by the immune system by resembling normal parts of the body's tissues.<a href="#fn126" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref126"><sup>126</sup></a><a href="#fn127" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref127"><sup>127</sup></a></p>
<p>It is therefore possible that if some chronic symptoms come from an autoimmune reaction, this could explain why some symptoms persist even after the spirochetes have been eliminated from the body. This hypothesis may explain chronic arthritis that persists after antibiotic therapy, similar to <a href="rheumatic_fever" title="wikilink">rheumatic fever</a>, but its wider application is controversial.<a href="#fn128" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref128"><sup>128</sup></a><a href="#fn129" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref129"><sup>129</sup></a></p>
<p>The National Institute of Health has supported research into bacterial resistance which has demonstrated persistence after antibiotic therapy in several animal models, including mice and primates. However, it was not possible to culture these bacteria and it is not known if they are infectious, or if they contribute to symptom persistence post-treatment.<a href="#fn130" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref130"><sup>130</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="diagnosis">Diagnosis</h2>
<p>Lyme disease is <a href="Medical_diagnosis" title="wikilink">diagnosed</a> clinically based on symptoms, objective physical findings (such as <a href="Erythema_chronicum_migrans" title="wikilink">erythema migrans</a>, <a href="facial_palsy" title="wikilink">facial palsy</a> or <a href="arthritis" class="uri" title="wikilink">arthritis</a>) or a history of possible exposure to infected ticks, as well as <a href="serology" title="wikilink">serological blood tests</a>. The EM rash is not always a bullseye, i.e., it can be red all the way across. When making a diagnosis of Lyme disease, health care providers should consider other diseases that may cause similar illness. Not all patients infected with Lyme disease will develop the characteristic bullseye rash, and many may not recall a tick bite.<a href="#fn131" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref131"><sup>131</sup></a></p>
<p>Because of the difficulty in <a href="Microbiological_culture" title="wikilink">culturing</a> <em>Borrelia</em> bacteria in the laboratory, diagnosis of Lyme disease is typically based on the clinical exam findings and a history of exposure to <a href="endemic_(epidemiology)" title="wikilink">endemic</a> Lyme areas.<a href="#fn132" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref132"><sup>132</sup></a> The EM rash, which does not occur in all cases, is considered sufficient to establish a diagnosis of Lyme disease even when serologic blood tests are negative.<a href="#fn133" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref133"><sup>133</sup></a><a href="#fn134" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref134"><sup>134</sup></a> Serological testing can be used to support a clinically suspected case, but is not diagnostic by itself.<a href="#fn135" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref135"><sup>135</sup></a></p>
<p>Diagnosis of late-stage Lyme disease is often complicated by a multifaceted appearance and nonspecific symptoms, prompting one reviewer to call Lyme the new &quot;great imitator.&quot;<a href="#fn136" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref136"><sup>136</sup></a> Lyme disease may be misdiagnosed as <a href="multiple_sclerosis" title="wikilink">multiple sclerosis</a>, <a href="rheumatoid_arthritis" title="wikilink">rheumatoid arthritis</a>, <a href="fibromyalgia" class="uri" title="wikilink">fibromyalgia</a>, <a href="chronic_fatigue_syndrome" title="wikilink">chronic fatigue syndrome</a>, <a href="Systemic_lupus_erythematosus" title="wikilink">lupus</a>, <a href="Crohn&#39;s_disease" title="wikilink">Crohn's disease</a>, <a href="HIV" class="uri" title="wikilink">HIV</a> or other <a href="autoimmune" class="uri" title="wikilink">autoimmune</a> and <a href="neurodegenerative" class="uri" title="wikilink">neurodegenerative</a> diseases.</p>
<h3 id="laboratory-testing">Laboratory testing</h3>
<p>Several forms of laboratory testing for Lyme disease are available, some of which have not been adequately validated. The most widely used tests are <a href="serology" title="wikilink">serologies</a>, which measure levels of specific antibodies in a patient's blood. These tests may be negative in early infection, as the body may not have produced a significant quantity of antibodies, but they are considered a reliable aid in the diagnosis of later stages of Lyme disease.<a href="#fn137" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref137"><sup>137</sup></a> Serologic tests for Lyme disease are of limited use in people lacking objective signs of Lyme disease because of false positive results and cost.<a href="#fn138" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref138"><sup>138</sup></a></p>
<p>The serological laboratory tests most widely available and employed are the <a href="Western_blot" title="wikilink">Western blot</a> and <a href="ELISA" class="uri" title="wikilink">ELISA</a>. A two-tiered protocol is recommended by the <a href="Centers_for_Disease_Control_and_Prevention" title="wikilink">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a> (CDC): the <a href="Sensitivity_and_specificity" title="wikilink">sensitive</a> ELISA test is performed first, and if it is positive or equivocal, then the more <a href="Sensitivity_and_specificity" title="wikilink">specific</a> Western blot is run.<a href="#fn139" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref139"><sup>139</sup></a> The reliability of testing in diagnosis remains controversial.<a href="#fn140" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref140"><sup>140</sup></a> Studies show the Western blot <a href="IgM" class="uri" title="wikilink">IgM</a> has a specificity of 94&lt;U+2013&gt;96% for patients with clinical symptoms of early Lyme disease.<a href="#fn141" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref141"><sup>141</sup></a><a href="#fn142" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref142"><sup>142</sup></a> The initial ELISA test has a sensitivity of about 70%, and in two-tiered testing, the overall sensitivity is only 64%, although this rises to 100% in the subset of people with disseminated symptoms, such as arthritis.<a href="#fn143" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref143"><sup>143</sup></a></p>
<p>Erroneous test results have been widely reported in both early and late stages of the disease, and can be caused by several factors, including antibody cross-reactions from other infections, including <a href="Epstein-Barr_virus" title="wikilink">Epstein-Barr virus</a> and <a href="cytomegalovirus" class="uri" title="wikilink">cytomegalovirus</a>,<a href="#fn144" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref144"><sup>144</sup></a> as well as <a href="herpes_simplex_virus" title="wikilink">herpes simplex virus</a>.<a href="#fn145" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref145"><sup>145</sup></a> The overall rate of false positives is low, only about 1 to 3%, in comparison to a false negative rate of up to 36% using two-tiered testing.<a href="#fn146" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref146"><sup>146</sup></a></p>
<p><a href="Polymerase_chain_reaction" title="wikilink">Polymerase chain reaction</a> (PCR) tests for Lyme disease have also been developed to detect the genetic material (<a href="DNA" class="uri" title="wikilink">DNA</a>) of the Lyme disease spirochete. PCR tests are susceptible to <a href="Type_I_and_type_II_errors" title="wikilink">false positive</a> results from poor laboratory technique.<a href="#fn147" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref147"><sup>147</sup></a> Even when properly performed, PCR often shows <a href="Type_I_and_type_II_errors" title="wikilink">false negative</a> results with blood and <a href="cerebrospinal_fluid" title="wikilink">cerebrospinal fluid</a> (CSF) specimens.<a href="#fn148" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref148"><sup>148</sup></a> Hence, PCR is not widely performed for diagnosis of Lyme disease, but it may have a role in diagnosis of Lyme arthritis, because it is a highly sensitive way of detecting <em>ospA</em> DNA in synovial fluid.<a href="#fn149" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref149"><sup>149</sup></a></p>
<p>With the exception of culture or PCR, there is currently no practical means for detecting the presence of the organism, as serologic studies only test for <a href="antibodies" class="uri" title="wikilink">antibodies</a> of <em>Borrelia</em>. High <a href="titer" title="wikilink">titers</a> of either immunoglobulin G (IgG) or immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies to <em>Borrelia</em> antigens indicate disease, but lower titers can be misleading, because the IgM antibodies may remain after the initial infection, and IgG antibodies may remain for years.<a href="#fn150" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref150"><sup>150</sup></a></p>
<p>Western blot, ELISA and PCR can be performed by either blood test via <a href="venipuncture" class="uri" title="wikilink">venipuncture</a> or CSF via <a href="lumbar_puncture" title="wikilink">lumbar puncture</a>. Though lumbar puncture is more definitive of diagnosis, antigen capture in the CSF is much more elusive; reportedly CSF yields positive results in only 10&lt;U+2013&gt;30% of patients cultured. The diagnosis of neurologic infection by <em>Borrelia</em> should not be excluded solely on the basis of normal routine CSF or negative CSF antibody analyses.<a href="#fn151" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref151"><sup>151</sup></a></p>
<p>New techniques for clinical testing of <em>Borrelia</em> infection have been developed, such as LTT-<a href="MELISA" class="uri" title="wikilink">MELISA</a>,<a href="#fn152" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref152"><sup>152</sup></a> although the results of studies are contradictory, The first peer reviewed study assessing the diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of the test has been presented in 2012, showing potential for LTT to become a supportive diagnostic tool.<a href="#fn153" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref153"><sup>153</sup></a> Others, such as focus floating microscopy, are under investigation.<a href="#fn154" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref154"><sup>154</sup></a> New research indicates <a href="chemokine" class="uri" title="wikilink">chemokine</a> <a href="CXCL13" class="uri" title="wikilink">CXCL13</a> may also be a possible marker for neuroborreliosis.<a href="#fn155" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref155"><sup>155</sup></a></p>
<p>Some laboratories offer Lyme disease testing using assays whose accuracy and clinical usefulness have not been adequately established. These tests include urine antigen tests, PCR tests on urine, immunofluorescent staining for cell wall-deficient forms of <em>Borrelia burgdorferi</em>, and lymphocyte transformation tests. The CDC does not recommend these tests, and a 2005 review by Aguero-Rosenfeld, <em>et al.</em> in <em>Clinical Microbiology Reviews</em> stated their use is &quot;of great concern and is strongly discouraged&quot;.<a href="#fn156" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref156"><sup>156</sup></a></p>
<p>In addition to laboratory testing on patients, ticks can be tested after removal from the host. Several laboratories perform PCR testing on live or dead ticks for a panel of tick-borne diseases, including <em>Borrelia</em>, <em><a href="Babesia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Babesia</a></em>, and <em><a href="Ehrlichia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ehrlichia</a></em>.<a href="#fn157" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref157"><sup>157</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="imaging">Imaging</h3>
<p><a href="Neuroimaging" class="uri" title="wikilink">Neuroimaging</a> is controversial in whether it provides specific patterns unique to <a href="neuroborreliosis" class="uri" title="wikilink">neuroborreliosis</a>, but may aid in <a href="differential_diagnosis" title="wikilink">differential diagnosis</a> and in understanding the pathophysiology of the disease.<a href="#fn158" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref158"><sup>158</sup></a> Though controversial, there is evidence that shows certain nueroimaging tests can provide data that is helpful in the diagnosis of a patient. <a href="Magnetic_resonance_imaging" title="wikilink">Magnetic resonance imaging</a> (MRI), as well as <a href="single-photon_emission_computed_tomography" title="wikilink">single-photon emission computed tomography</a> (SPECT) are two of the tests that can identify abnormalities in the brain of a patient affected with this disease. Neuroimaging findings in an MRI include lesions in the periventricular white water as well as enlarged ventricles and cortical atrophy. The findings are considered somewhat unexceptional because the lesions have been found to be reversible following antibiotic treatment. Images produced using SPECT show numerous areas where an insufficient amount of blood is being delivered the cortex and subcortical white matter. However, SPECT images are known to be nonspecific because they show a heterogeneous pattern in the imaging. The abnormalities seen in the SPECT images are very similar to those seen in patients with cerebral vacuities and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, which makes them questionable.<a href="#fn159" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref159"><sup>159</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="prevention">Prevention</h2>
<p>Protective clothing includes a hat, long-sleeved shirts and long trousers tucked into socks or boots. Light-colored clothing makes the tick more easily visible before it attaches itself. People should use special care in handling and allowing outdoor pets inside homes because they can bring ticks into the house.</p>
<p><a href="Permethrin" class="uri" title="wikilink">Permethrin</a> sprayed on clothing kills ticks on contact, and is sold for this purpose. Insect repellents with Picaridin, IR3535, DEET or Oil of Lemon Eucalyptus repel ticks as well.<a href="#fn160" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref160"><sup>160</sup></a></p>
<p>A community can reduce the incidence of Lyme disease by reducing the numbers of primary hosts on which the deer tick depends, such as rodents, other small mammals, and deer. Reduction of the deer population may, over time, help break the reproductive cycle of the deer ticks and their ability to flourish in suburban and rural areas.<a href="#fn161" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref161"><sup>161</sup></a></p>
<p>An unusual, organic approach to control of ticks and prevention of Lyme disease involves the use of <a href="domesticated_guineafowl" title="wikilink">domesticated guineafowl</a>. Guineafowl are voracious consumers of insects and <a href="arachnid" title="wikilink">arachnids</a>, and have a particular fondness for ticks. Localized use of domesticated guineafowl may reduce dependence on chemical pest-control methods.<a href="#fn162" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref162"><sup>162</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="management-of-host-animals">Management of host animals</h3>
<p>Lyme and all other deer tick-borne diseases can be prevented on a regional level by reducing the deer population on which the ticks depend for reproductive success. (Although deer ticks do acquire Lyme disease pathogens from rodents and not from deer, the size of the tick population tends to parallel that of the deer population.)<a href="#fn163" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref163"><sup>163</sup></a> This has been demonstrated in the communities of <a href="Monhegan,_Maine" title="wikilink">Monhegan, Maine</a><a href="#fn164" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref164"><sup>164</sup></a> and Mumford Cove, Connecticut.<a href="#fn165" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref165"><sup>165</sup></a></p>
<p>For example, in the U.S., reducing the deer population to levels of 8 to 10 per square mile (from the current levels of 60 or more deer per square mile in the areas of the country with the highest Lyme disease rates), the tick numbers can be brought down to levels too low to spread Lyme and other tick-borne diseases.<a href="#fn166" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref166"><sup>166</sup></a> However, such a drastic reduction may be impractical in many areas. Routine veterinary control of <a href="ticks_of_domestic_animals" title="wikilink">ticks of domestic animals</a>, including livestock, by use of chemical acaricides can contribute to reducing exposure of humans to ticks. However, more recent research has shown that the risk of acquiring Lyme disease does not depend on the existence of a local deer population, as is commonly assumed. This research suggests eliminating deer from smaller areas  may in fact lead to an increase in tick density and the rise of &quot;tick-borne disease hotspots&quot;.<a href="#fn167" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref167"><sup>167</sup></a></p>
<p>Action can be taken to avoid getting bitten by ticks by using insect repellants, for example those that contain <a href="DEET" class="uri" title="wikilink">DEET</a> (N,N-Diethyl-meta-toluamide). DEET-containing repellants are thought to be moderately effective in the prevention of tick bites.<a href="#fn168" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref168"><sup>168</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="vaccination">Vaccination</h3>
<p>A <a href="vaccine" title="wikilink">recombinant vaccine</a> against Lyme disease, based on the outer surface protein A (OspA) of <em>B. burgdorferi</em>, was developed by SmithKline Beecham. In <a href="clinical_trial" title="wikilink">clinical trials</a> involving more than 10,000 people, the vaccine, called LYMErix, was found to confer protective immunity to <em>Borrelia</em> in 76% of adults and 100% of children with only mild or moderate and transient <a href="adverse_effect" title="wikilink">adverse effects</a>.<a href="#fn169" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref169"><sup>169</sup></a> LYMErix was approved on the basis of these trials by the <a href="Food_and_Drug_Administration" title="wikilink">Food and Drug Administration</a> (FDA) on December 21, 1998.</p>
<p>Following approval of the vaccine, its entry in clinical practice was slow for a variety of reasons, including its cost, which was often not reimbursed by insurance companies.<a href="#fn170" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref170"><sup>170</sup></a> Subsequently, hundreds of vaccine recipients reported they had developed <a href="autoimmunity" title="wikilink">autoimmune</a> side effects. Supported by some patient advocacy groups, a number of <a href="class-action_lawsuit" title="wikilink">class-action lawsuits</a> were filed against GlaxoSmithKline, alleging the vaccine had caused these health problems. These claims were investigated by the FDA and the <a href="U.S._Centers_for_Disease_Control" title="wikilink">U.S. Centers for Disease Control</a> (CDC), who found no connection between the vaccine and the autoimmune complaints.<a href="#fn171" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref171"><sup>171</sup></a></p>
<p>Despite the lack of evidence that the complaints were caused by the vaccine, sales plummeted and LYMErix was withdrawn from the U.S. market by GlaxoSmithKline in February 2002,<a href="#fn172" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref172"><sup>172</sup></a> in the setting of negative media coverage and fears of vaccine side effects.<a href="#fn173" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref173"><sup>173</sup></a><a href="#fn174" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref174"><sup>174</sup></a> The fate of LYMErix was described in the medical literature as a &quot;cautionary tale&quot;;<a href="#fn175" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref175"><sup>175</sup></a> an editorial in <em><a href="Nature_(journal)" title="wikilink">Nature</a></em> cited the withdrawal of LYMErix as an instance in which &quot;unfounded public fears place pressures on vaccine developers that go beyond reasonable safety considerations.&quot;<a href="#fn176" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref176"><sup>176</sup></a> The original developer of the OspA vaccine at the <a href="Max_Planck_Institute" title="wikilink">Max Planck Institute</a> told <em>Nature</em>: &quot;This just shows how irrational the world can be... There was no scientific justification for the first OspA vaccine LYMErix being pulled.&quot;<a href="#fn177" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref177"><sup>177</sup></a></p>
<p>New vaccines are being researched using outer surface protein C (OspC) and <a href="Glycolipid" title="wikilink">glycolipoprotein</a> as methods of immunization.<a href="#fn178" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref178"><sup>178</sup></a><a href="#fn179" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref179"><sup>179</sup></a> Vaccines have been formulated and approved for prevention of Lyme disease in dogs. There are currently three Lyme disease vaccines available. The first is LymeVax, formulated by Fort Dodge Laboratories. This vaccine contains intact dead <a href="spirochetes" class="uri" title="wikilink">spirochetes</a> which expose the host to the organism. The second vaccine is Galaxy Lyme, or Intervet-<a href="Schering-Plough" class="uri" title="wikilink">Schering-Plough</a>'s vaccine. This formula targets proteins OspC and OspA. The OspC antibodies kill any of the bacteria that has not been killed by the OspA antibodies. The third vaccine, Canine Recombinant Lyme, formulated by <a href="Merial" class="uri" title="wikilink">Merial</a>, generates antibodies against the OspA protein so that a tick feeding on a vaccinated dog draws in blood full of anti-OspA antibodies, which kill the spirochetes in the tick's gut before they are transmitted to the dog.<a href="#fn180" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref180"><sup>180</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="tick-removal">Tick removal</h3>
<p>Attached ticks should be removed promptly, as removal within 36 hours can reduce transmission rates.<a href="#fn181" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref181"><sup>181</sup></a> Folk remedies for tick removal tend to be ineffective, offer no advantages in preventing the transfer of disease, and may increase the risks of transmission or infection . The best method is simply to pull the tick out with tweezers as close to the skin as possible, without twisting, and avoiding crushing the body of the tick or removing the head from the tick's body.<a href="#fn182" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref182"><sup>182</sup></a> The risk of infection increases with the time the tick is attached, and if a tick is attached for less than 24 hours, infection is unlikely. However, since these ticks are very small, especially in the nymph stage, prompt detection is quite difficult.<a href="#fn183" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref183"><sup>183</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="prevention-in-dogs">Prevention in dogs</h3>
<p>Prevention of Lyme disease is an important step in keeping dogs safe in endemic areas. Prevention education and a number of preventative measures are available. First of all, for dog owners who live near or who often frequent tick-infested areas, routine vaccinations for their dogs is an important step.<a href="#fn184" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref184"><sup>184</sup></a></p>
<p>Another crucial preventive measure is the use of persistent <a href="acaricides" class="uri" title="wikilink">acaricides</a>, such as topical repellents or pesticides that contain triazapentadienes (<a href="Amitraz" class="uri" title="wikilink">Amitraz</a>), phenylpyrazoles (<a href="Fipronil" class="uri" title="wikilink">Fipronil</a>), or permethrin (<a href="Pyrethroids" class="uri" title="wikilink">Pyrethroids</a>).<a href="#fn185" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref185"><sup>185</sup></a> These acaricides target primarily the adult stages of Lyme-carrying ticks and reduce the number of reproductively active ticks in the environment.<a href="#fn186" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref186"><sup>186</sup></a> Formulations of these ingredients are available in a variety of topical forms, including spot-ons, sprays, powders, impregnated collars, solutions, and shampoos.<a href="#fn187" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref187"><sup>187</sup></a></p>
<p>Examination of a dog for ticks after being in a tick-infested area is an important precautionary measure to take in the prevention of Lyme disease. Key spots to examine include the head, neck, and ears.<a href="#fn188" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref188"><sup>188</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="treatment">Treatment</h2>
<p><a href="Antibiotics" class="uri" title="wikilink">Antibiotics</a> are the primary treatment.<a href="#fn189" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref189"><sup>189</sup></a> The specific approach to their use is dependent on the individual affected and the stage of the disease.<a href="#fn190" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref190"><sup>190</sup></a> For most people with early localized infection, oral administration of <a href="doxycycline" class="uri" title="wikilink">doxycycline</a> is widely recommended as the first choice, as it is effective against not only <em>Borrelia</em> bacteria but also a variety of other illnesses carried by ticks.<a href="#fn191" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref191"><sup>191</sup></a> Doxycycline is contraindicated in children younger than eight years of age and women who are pregnant or breastfeeding;<a href="#fn192" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref192"><sup>192</sup></a> alternatives to doxycycline are amoxicillin, cefuroxime axetil, and azithromycin.<a href="#fn193" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref193"><sup>193</sup></a> Individuals with early disseminated or late infection may have symptomatic cardiac disease, refractory Lyme arthritis, or neurologic symptoms like meningitis or encephalitis.<a href="#fn194" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref194"><sup>194</sup></a> Intravenous administration of <a href="ceftriaxone" class="uri" title="wikilink">ceftriaxone</a> is recommended as the first choice in these cases;<a href="#fn195" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref195"><sup>195</sup></a> <a href="cefotaxime" class="uri" title="wikilink">cefotaxime</a> and doxycycline are available as alternatives.<a href="#fn196" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref196"><sup>196</sup></a></p>
<p>These treatment regimens last from one to four weeks.<a href="#fn197" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref197"><sup>197</sup></a> If joint swelling persists or returns, a second round of antibiotics may be considered.<a href="#fn198" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref198"><sup>198</sup></a> Outside of that, a prolonged antibiotic regimen lasting more than 28 days is not recommended as there is no clinical evidence showing that it is effective.<a href="#fn199" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref199"><sup>199</sup></a> IgM and IgG antibody levels may be elevated for years even after successful treatment with antibiotics.<a href="#fn200" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref200"><sup>200</sup></a> As antibody levels are not indicative of treatment success, testing for them is not recommended.<a href="#fn201" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref201"><sup>201</sup></a></p>
<p>The risk of infectious transmission increases with the duration of tick attachment.<a href="#fn202" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref202"><sup>202</sup></a> It requires between 36 and 48 hours of attachment for the bacteria that causes Lyme to travel from within the tick into its saliva.<a href="#fn203" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref203"><sup>203</sup></a> If a deer tick sufficiently likely to be carrying <em>Borrelia</em> is found attached to a person and removed, and if the tick has been attached for 36 hours or is engorged, a single dose of doxycycline administered within the 72 hours after removal may reduce the risk of Lyme disease.<a href="#fn204" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref204"><sup>204</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="prognosis">Prognosis</h2>
<p>For early cases, prompt treatment is usually curative.<a href="#fn205" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref205"><sup>205</sup></a> However, the severity and treatment of Lyme disease may be complicated due to late diagnosis, failure of antibiotic treatment, and simultaneous infection with other tick-borne diseases (coinfections), including <a href="ehrlichiosis" class="uri" title="wikilink">ehrlichiosis</a>, <a href="babesiosis" class="uri" title="wikilink">babesiosis</a>, and immune suppression in the patient.</p>

<p>Lyme disease is the most common tick-borne disease in North America and Europe, and one of the fastest-growing infectious diseases in the United States. Of cases reported to the United States CDC, the ratio of Lyme disease infection is 7.9 cases for every 100,000 persons. In the ten states where Lyme disease is most common, the average was 31.6 cases for every 100,000 persons for the year 2005.<a href="#fn252" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref252"><sup>252</sup></a><a href="#fn253" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref253"><sup>253</sup></a><a href="#fn254" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref254"><sup>254</sup></a></p>
<p>Although Lyme disease has been reported in all states except Montana,<a href="#fn255" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref255"><sup>255</sup></a> about 99% of all reported cases are confined to just five geographic areas (New England, Mid-Atlantic, East-North Central, South Atlantic, and West North-Central).<a href="#fn256" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref256"><sup>256</sup></a> New 2011 CDC Lyme case definition guidelines are used to determine confirmed CDC surveillance cases.<a href="#fn257" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref257"><sup>257</sup></a></p>
<p>Effective January 2008, the CDC gives equal weight to laboratory evidence from 1) a positive culture for <em>B. burgdorferi</em>; 2) two-tier testing (ELISA screening and Western blot confirming); or 3) single-tier IgG (old infection) Western blot.<a href="#fn258" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref258"><sup>258</sup></a> Previously, the CDC only included laboratory evidence based on (1) and (2) in their surveillance case definition. The case definition now includes the use of Western blot without prior ELISA screen.<a href="#fn259" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref259"><sup>259</sup></a></p>
<p>The number of reported cases of the disease has been increasing, as are endemic regions in North America. For example, <em>B. burgdorferi sensu lato</em> was previously thought to be hindered in its ability to be maintained in an <a href="enzootic" class="uri" title="wikilink">enzootic</a> cycle in <a href="California" class="uri" title="wikilink">California</a>, because it was assumed the large lizard population would dilute the prevalence of <em>B. burgdorferi</em> in local tick populations; this has since been brought into question, as some evidence has suggested lizards can become infected.<a href="#fn260" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref260"><sup>260</sup></a></p>
<p>Except for one study in Europe,<a href="#fn261" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref261"><sup>261</sup></a> much of the data implicating lizards is based on DNA detection of the spirochete and has not demonstrated lizards are able to infect ticks feeding upon them.<a href="#fn262" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref262"><sup>262</sup></a><a href="#fn263" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref263"><sup>263</sup></a><a href="#fn264" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref264"><sup>264</sup></a><a href="#fn265" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref265"><sup>265</sup></a> As some experiments suggest lizards are refractory to infection with <em>Borrelia</em>, it appears likely their involvement in the enzootic cycle is more complex and species-specific.<a href="#fn266" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref266"><sup>266</sup></a></p>
<p>While <em>B. burgdorferi</em> is most associated with ticks hosted by <a href="white-tailed_deer" title="wikilink">white-tailed deer</a> and <a href="White-footed_Mouse" title="wikilink">white-footed mice</a>, <em>Borrelia afzelii</em> is most frequently detected in rodent-feeding vector ticks, and <em>Borrelia garinii</em> and <em>Borrelia valaisiana</em> appear to be associated with birds. Both rodents and birds are competent reservoir hosts for <em>B. burgdorferi sensu stricto</em>. The resistance of a genospecies of Lyme disease spirochetes to the bacteriolytic activities of the alternative complement pathway of various host species may determine its reservoir host association.</p>
<p>Several similar but apparently distinct conditions may exist, caused by various species or subspecies of Borrelia in North America. A regionally restricted condition that may be related to Borrelia infection is <a href="southern_tick-associated_rash_illness" title="wikilink">southern tick-associated rash illness</a> (STARI), also known as Masters' disease. <a href="Amblyomma_americanum" title="wikilink">Amblyomma americanum</a>, known commonly as the lone-star tick, is recognized as the primary vector for STARI. In some parts of the geographical distribution of STARI, Lyme disease is quite rare (e.g., Arkansas), so patients in these regions experiencing Lyme-like symptoms&lt;U+2014&gt;especially if they follow a bite from a lone-star tick&lt;U+2014&gt;should consider STARI as a possibility. It is generally a milder condition than Lyme and typically responds well to antibiotic treatment.</p>
<p>Although Montana is the only state that has not reported a confirmed case of Lyme disease, in recent years there have been 5 to 10 cases a year of a disease similar to Lyme. It occurs primarily in pockets along the Yellowstone River in central Montana. People have developed a red bull's-eye rash around a tick bite followed by weeks of fatigue and a fever.<a href="#fn267" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref267"><sup>267</sup></a></p>
<p>Lyme disease prevalence is comparable among males and females. A wide range of age groups is affected, though the number of cases is highest among 10&lt;U+2013&gt;19-year-olds. For unknown reasons, Lyme disease is seven times more common among Asians.<a href="#fn268" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref268"><sup>268</sup></a></p>

<p><a href="Urbanization" class="uri" title="wikilink">Urbanization</a> and other <a href="anthropogenic" class="uri" title="wikilink">anthropogenic</a> factors can be implicated in the spread of Lyme disease to humans. In many areas, expansion of suburban neighborhoods has led to gradual deforestation of surrounding wooded areas and increased border contact between humans and tick-dense areas. Human expansion has also resulted in reduction of predators that hunt deer as well as mice, chipmunks and other small rodents&lt;U+2014&gt;the primary reservoirs for Lyme disease. As a consequence of increased human contact with host and <a href="Vector_(epidemiology)" title="wikilink">vector</a>, the likelihood of transmission of the disease has greatly increased.<a href="#fn271" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref271"><sup>271</sup></a><a href="#fn272" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref272"><sup>272</sup></a> Researchers are investigating possible links between <a href="global_warming" title="wikilink">global warming</a> and the spread of vector-borne diseases, including Lyme disease.<a href="#fn273" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref273"><sup>273</sup></a></p>

<p>The IDSA focused on the fact that the medical validity of the IDSA guidelines was not challenged,<a href="#fn323" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref323"><sup>323</sup></a> and cited mounting legal costs and the difficulty of presenting scientific arguments in a legal setting as their rationale for accepting the settlement.<a href="#fn324" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref324"><sup>324</sup></a> A journalist writing in <em><a href="Nature_Medicine" title="wikilink">Nature Medicine</a></em> suggested some IDSA members may not have disclosed potential conflicts of interest,<a href="#fn325" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref325"><sup>325</sup></a> while a <em><a href="Forbes_(magazine)" title="wikilink">Forbes</a></em> piece described Blumenthal's investigation as &quot;intimidation&quot; of scientists by an elected official with close ties to Lyme advocacy groups.<a href="#fn326" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref326"><sup>326</sup></a> The <em><a href="Journal_of_the_American_Medical_Association" title="wikilink">Journal of the American Medical Association</a></em> described the decision as an example of the &quot;politicization of health policy&quot; that went against the weight of scientific evidence and may have a <a href="Chilling_effect_(term)" title="wikilink">chilling effect</a> on future decisions by medical associations.<a href="#fn327" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref327"><sup>327</sup></a></p>
<p>The state of Connecticut went on to enact a law on June 18, 2009, &quot;to allow a licensed physician to prescribe, administer or dispense long-term antibiotics for a therapeutic purpose to a patient clinically diagnosed with Lyme disease.&quot;<a href="#fn328" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref328"><sup>328</sup></a> The states of Rhode Island<a href="#fn329" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref329"><sup>329</sup></a> California<a href="#fn330" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref330"><sup>330</sup></a> Massachusetts<a href="#fn331" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref331"><sup>331</sup></a> and New Hampshire<a href="#fn332" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref332"><sup>332</sup></a> have similar laws.<a href="#fn333" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref333"><sup>333</sup></a></p>
<p>The expert panel's review was published in 2010, with the independent doctors and scientists in the panel unanimously endorsing the guidelines, stating &quot;No changes or revisions to the 2006 Lyme guidelines are necessary at this time,&quot; and concluding long-term antibiotic treatments are unproven and potentially dangerous.<a href="#fn334" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref334"><sup>334</sup></a> The IDSA welcomed the final report, stating that &quot;Our number one concern is the patients we treat, and we're glad patients and their physicians now have additional reassurance that the guidelines are medically sound.&quot;<a href="#fn335" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref335"><sup>335</sup></a></p>

<p>A 2004 study in <em>The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal</em> stated 9 of 19 Internet websites surveyed contained what were described as major inaccuracies. Websites described as providing inaccurate information included several with the word &quot;lyme&quot; in their domain name (e.g., lymenet.org), as well as the website of the <a href="International_Lyme_And_Associated_Diseases_Society" title="wikilink">International Lyme And Associated Diseases Society</a>.<a href="#fn339" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref339"><sup>339</sup></a> A 2008 article in <em><a href="The_New_England_Journal_of_Medicine" title="wikilink">The New England Journal of Medicine</a></em> argued media coverage of chronic Lyme disease ignored scientific evidence in favor of anecdotes and testimonials:</p>

<dd>&quot;The media frequently disregard complex scientific data in favor of testimonials about patients suffering from purported chronic Lyme disease and may even question the competence of clinicians who are reluctant to diagnose chronic Lyme disease. All these factors have contributed to a great deal of public confusion with little appreciation of the serious harm caused to many patients who have received a misdiagnosis and have been inappropriately treated.&quot;<a href="#fn340" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref340"><sup>340</sup></a>

<p>The 2008 documentary film <em><a href="Under_Our_Skin" title="wikilink">Under Our Skin: The Untold Story of Lyme Disease</a></em> opened June 19, 2009, in New York City.
