<h2 id="plot">Plot</h2>
<p>The pilot episode introduces the six main characters of the series, as well as the cast of supporting characters. Casey McCall, one of the co-anchors of Sports Night, a sports television roundup show running at 11pm on CSC, the &quot;number 3 sports network&quot; - a channel modelled on CNN and similar - is displaying a negative attitude, both on and off screen, as a result of his recent divorce. Dan Rydell, his co-anchor, tries to get back his positive attitude, while J.J. and the network executives begin to get vocal about his need to improve or leave the company. Dana Whitaker, his producer, vociferously defends him to the executive producer Isaac Jaffe, even while she tries to get him to shape up before they override her shielding of him. At the same time Casey himself is thinking about quitting sports broadcasting, citing the moral decay he's seen on the job, in spite of Dan's observation that he'd only be doing it for the wrong reasons. Dana also hires a new associate producer, the highly strung but brilliant Jeremy Goodwin, who co-producer Natalie Hurley takes a liking to. At the end of the episode, a unique sporting event involving the return of a 41-year-old injured athlete to the running track makes Casey change his mind.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>

<h3 id="conception">Conception</h3>
<p>Sorkin gathered inspiration for the show from a number of places. According to the Huffington Post, &quot;Sorkin got the idea [for the show] from watching TV...while writing <em><a href="The_American_President" title="wikilink">The American President</a></em>. He was watching ESPN, and found the humor and banter from the anchors (<a href="Dan_Patrick" title="wikilink">Dan Patrick</a> and...either <a href="Keith_Olbermann" title="wikilink">Keith Olbermann</a> or <a href="Craig_Kilborn" title="wikilink">Craig Kilborn</a>) intoxicating, and decided to create a comedy set in that world&quot;.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> The show utilises a laugh track, which the <a href="Post-Gazette" class="uri" title="wikilink">Post-Gazette</a> described as following &quot;an unwritten primetime rule: all half-hour shows, except animated comedies...must have a laugh track&quot;<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> and hollywood.com's Peter Hall calls a &quot;goof&quot; which &quot;crippled&quot; the first few episodes&quot; of the show.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> It is used sparingly in the pilot as &quot;<em>Sports Night</em> has so many dramatic moments&quot;.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p>The show was pitched as not being aimed exclusively at sports fans, with the tagline &quot;It's about sports. The same way <em>Charlies Angels</em> was about law enforcement.&quot;<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> Based on the pre-air pilot, ABC ordered <em>Sports Night</em> for the <a href="1998&amp;ndash;99_United_States_network_television_schedule" title="wikilink">Fall 1998</a> television season.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="casting">Casting</h3>
<p>The pilot episode, as with the rest of the series, uses an ensemble cast, with six of the cast members identified as main characters. <a href="Peter_Krause" title="wikilink">Peter Krause</a> and <a href="Josh_Charles" title="wikilink">Josh Charles</a> played the two lead anchors on the CSC network, Casey McCall and Dan Rydell respectively. <a href="Felicity_Huffman" title="wikilink">Felicity Huffman</a> played <em>Sports Night</em> producer Dana Whitaker, while <a href="Robert_Guillaume" title="wikilink">Robert Guillaume</a> appeared as her boss Isaac Jaffe, the executive producer.

<p>It was announced on May 18, 1998 that the show would debut on Tuesdays at 9.30 as part of ABC's comedy block, following <em><a href="Home_Improvement_(TV_series)" title="wikilink">Home Improvement</a></em>, <em><a href="The_Hughleys" title="wikilink">The Hughleys</a></em> and <em><a href="Spin_City" title="wikilink">Spin City</a></em>.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> The series debuted on ABC in the opening week of the <a href="1998&amp;ndash;99_United_States_network_television_schedule" title="wikilink">1998–99 television season</a>, on September 22, 1998.

<h3 id="critical-reception">Critical reception</h3>
<p><a href="Entertainment_Weekly" title="wikilink">Entertainment Weekly</a> critic <a href="Ken_Tucker" title="wikilink">Ken Tucker</a> was positive, despite his initial skepticism. He worried that Aaron Sorkin would not be able to translate big screen success on films such as <em><a href="A_Few_Good_Men" title="wikilink">A Few Good Men</a></em> and <em><a href="The_American_President" title="wikilink">The American President</a></em> to television, and believed before watching the show that it was &quot;a golden opportunity to stink up prime time with the sort of smug, smirky, life-drainingly ironic talking heads who've outlasted their naughty-boy novelty status on ESPN&quot;. However, after watching the show, he wrote &quot;But against all odds, Sports Night is a home run, a hole in one, a touchdown &lt;U+2014&gt; at once the most consistently funny, intelligent, and emotional of any new-season series.&quot;<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<p>The <a href="Huffington_Post" title="wikilink">Huffington Post</a>'s Bob Sassone, while reviewing the show retrospectively in 2006, praised the &quot;intelligent writing, fast-paced dialogue, and a strong ensemble cast of smart, moral characters all working toward a common goal.&quot; He also pointed out links between<em>Sports Night</em> and Aaron Sorkin's next production, the critically acclaimed <em><a href="The_West_Wing" title="wikilink">The West Wing</a></em>.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> The <a href="Washington_Post" title="wikilink">Washington Post</a> called <em>Sports Night</em> &quot;the best new ABC sitcom of the season&quot; and also commented &quot;Aaron Sorkin...[has] certainly got a knack for snappy, and occasionally moving, dialogue.&quot; They were among a number of publications to point out how the show would appeal to sports fans and non-sports enthusiasts alike.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> The <a href="Associated_Press" title="wikilink">Associated Press</a> marked <em>Sports Night</em> out as one of the few potential successes amongst the freshman shows for the 1998–99 season.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> <a href="Entertainment_Weekly" title="wikilink">Entertainment Weekly</a> believed that the season as a whole deserved to be nominated for best comedy at the Emmys.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="awards-and-nominations">Awards and nominations</h3>
<p>The episode received multiple award nominations. The episode's director Thomas Schlamme won <a href="Directors_Guild_of_America" title="wikilink">Directors Guild of America</a> award for <a href="Directors_Guild_of_America_Award_for_Outstanding_Directing_&lt;U+2013&gt;_Comedy_Series" title="wikilink">Directors Guild of America Award for Outstanding Directing &lt;U+2013&gt; Comedy Series</a> in <a href="Directors_Guild_of_America_Awards_1999" title="wikilink">1999</a>.
