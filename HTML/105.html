<p>A <strong>paddy field</strong> is a flooded parcel of <a href="arable_land" title="wikilink">arable land</a> used for growing <a href="rice" class="uri" title="wikilink">rice</a> and other <a href="Aquatic_plant" title="wikilink">semiaquatic crops</a>.

Paddies can be built into steep hillsides as <a href="Terrace_(agriculture)" title="wikilink">terraces</a> and adjacent to depressed or steeply sloped features such as rivers or <a href="marshes" class="uri" title="wikilink">marshes</a>. They can require a great deal of <a href="manual_labour" title="wikilink">labor</a> and materials to create, and need large quantities of water for <a href="irrigation" class="uri" title="wikilink">irrigation</a>. Flooded paddies provide an ideal environment for rice cultivation and discourage the growth of many <a href="weed" title="wikilink">weeds</a>.

<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<p>Archaeologists generally accept that wet-field cultivation originated in China. At Caoxieshan, a site of the Neolithic <a href="Majiabang_culture" title="wikilink">Majiabang culture</a>, archaeologists excavated paddy fields.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> Some archaeologists claim that Caoxieshan may date to 4000-3000 BC,<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a><a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> but as of now the oldest excavated rice paddy field dated by absolute scientific dating techniques are from <a href="Korea" class="uri" title="wikilink">Korea</a>.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> There is archaeological evidence that unhusked rice was stored for the military and for burial with the deceased from the <a href="Neolithic" class="uri" title="wikilink">Neolithic</a> period to the <a href="Han_Dynasty" title="wikilink">Han Dynasty</a> in China.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p>Paddy field farming goes back thousands of years in <a href="Korea" class="uri" title="wikilink">Korea</a>. A pit-house at the Daecheon-ni site yielded carbonized rice grains and radiocarbon dates indicating that rice cultivation in dry-fields may have begun as early as the Middle <a href="Jeulmun_Pottery_Period" title="wikilink">Jeulmun Pottery Period</a> (c. 3500-2000 BC) in the <a href="Korean_Peninsula" title="wikilink">Korean Peninsula</a>.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> Ancient paddy fields have been carefully unearthed in Korea by institutes such as <a href="Kyungnam_University" title="wikilink">Kyungnam University</a> Museum (KUM) of <a href="Masan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Masan</a>. They excavated paddy field features at the Geumcheon-ni Site near <a href="Miryang" class="uri" title="wikilink">Miryang</a>, <a href="South_Gyeongsang_Province" title="wikilink">South Gyeongsang Province</a>. The paddy field feature was found next to a <a href="pit-house" class="uri" title="wikilink">pit-house</a> that is dated to the latter part of the Early <a href="Mumun_Pottery_Period" title="wikilink">Mumun Pottery Period</a> (c. 1100-850 BC). KUM has conducted excavations that have revealed similarly dated paddy field features at Yaeum-dong and Okhyeon in modern-day <a href="Ulsan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ulsan</a>.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<p>The earliest Mumun features were usually located in low-lying narrow gullies that were naturally swampy and fed by the local stream system. Some Mumun paddy fields in flat areas were made of a series of squares and rectangles separated by bunds approximately 10Â cm in height, while terraced paddy fields consisted of long irregular shapes that followed natural contours of the land at various levels.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a><a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<p>Mumun Period rice farmers used all of the elements that are present in today's paddy fields such terracing, bunds, canals, and small reservoirs. We can grasp some paddy-field farming techniques of the Middle Mumun (c. 850-550 BC) from the well-preserved wooden tools excavated from archaeological rice fields at the Majeon-ni Site. However, <a href="iron" class="uri" title="wikilink">iron</a> tools for paddy-field farming were not introduced until sometime after 200 BC. The spatial scale of paddy-fields increased with the regular use of <a href="Iron_Age" title="wikilink">iron</a> tools in the <a href="Three_Kingdoms_of_Korea" title="wikilink">Three Kingdoms of Korea</a> Period (c. AD 300/400-668).</p>

<p>In the Philippines, the use of rice paddies can be traced to prehistoric times, as evidenced in the names of towns such as <a href="Pila,_Laguna" title="wikilink">Pila, Laguna</a>, whose name can be traced to the straight mounds of dirt that form the boundaries of the rice paddy, or &quot;Pilapil.&quot;<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>

<p>Although China's agricultural output is the largest in the world, only about 15% of its total land area can be cultivated. About 75% of the cultivated area is used for food crops. <a href="Rice" class="uri" title="wikilink">Rice</a> is China's most important crop, raised on about 25% of the cultivated area.

<p>During the <a href="Spring_and_Autumn_Period" title="wikilink">Spring and Autumn Period</a> (722-481 BC), two revolutionary improvements in <a href="Agricultural_science" title="wikilink">farming technology</a> took place.

<p>India has the largest paddy output in the world and is also the fourth largest exporter of rice in the world. In India, Chhattisgarh is Largest Rice producer. Paddy fields are a common sight throughout India, be they be northern gangetic plains or southern peninsular plateaus. Paddy is cultivated at least twice a year in most parts of India, the two seasons being known as <a href="Rabi_crop" title="wikilink">Rabi</a> and <a href="Kharif_crop" title="wikilink">Kharif</a> respectively. The former cultivation is dependent on irrigation, while the latter depends on Monsoon. The paddy cultivation plays a major role in socio-cultural life of rural India. Many festivals such as Onam in <a href="Kerala" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kerala</a>, Bihu in <a href="Assam" class="uri" title="wikilink">Assam</a>, Sankranthi in <a href="Andhra_Pradesh" title="wikilink">Andhra Pradesh</a> Thai Pongal In Tamil Nadu, Makara Sankranthi in Karnataka, Nabanna in <a href="West_Bengal" title="wikilink">West Bengal</a> celebrates harvest of Paddy. <a href="Chhattisgarh" class="uri" title="wikilink">Chhattisgarh</a> is historically known as the &quot;Rice Bowl of India&quot;, while <a href="Thanjavur" class="uri" title="wikilink">Thanjavur</a> is historically known as the &quot;<a href="Granary" class="uri" title="wikilink">Granary</a> of South India&quot; and the <em>Rice bowl of <a href="Tamil_Nadu" title="wikilink">Tamil Nadu</a></em>.

When <a href="irrigation" class="uri" title="wikilink">irrigation</a> is available, rice farmers typically plant <a href="Green_Revolution" title="wikilink">Green Revolution</a> rice varieties allowing three growing seasons per year. Since fertilizer and pesticide are relatively expensive inputs, farmers typically plant seeds in a very small plot. Three weeks following germination, the 6-8Â inch stalks are picked and replanted at greater separation, in a backbreaking manual procedure.</p>
<p>Rice harvesting in <a href="Central_Java" title="wikilink">Central Java</a> is often performed not by owners or <a href="sharecropper" title="wikilink">sharecroppers</a> of paddy, but rather by itinerant middlemen, whose small firms specialize in harvesting, transport, milling, and distribution to markets.</p>

<p>The <a href="acid" title="wikilink">acidic</a> <a href="soil" class="uri" title="wikilink">soil</a> conditions common in Japan due to <a href="volcano" title="wikilink">volcanic</a> eruptions have made the paddy field the most productive farming method. Paddy fields are represented by the <a href="kanji" class="uri" title="wikilink">kanji</a>  (commonly read as <em>ta</em>) that has had a strong influence on Japanese culture. In fact, the character , which originally meant 'field' in general, is used in Japan exclusively to convey the meaning 'rice paddy field'. One of the oldest samples of writing in Japan is widely credited to the kanji  found on pottery at the archaeological site of <a href="Matsusaka,_Mie" title="wikilink">Matsusaka, Mie</a> that dates to the late 2nd century. <em>Ta</em> () is used as a part of many <a href="Japanese_place_names" title="wikilink">place names</a> as well as in many family names. Most of these places are somehow related to the paddy field and in many cases, are based on the history of a particular location. For example, where a river runs through a village, the place east of river may be called <em>Higashida</em> (), literally &quot;east paddy field.&quot; A place with a newly irrigated paddy field, especially those during or later than <a href="Edo_period" title="wikilink">Edo period</a>, may be called <em>Nitta</em> or <em>Shinden</em> (both ), &quot;new paddy field.&quot; In some places, lakes and marshes were likened to a paddy field and were named with <em>ta</em>, like <em>Hakk&lt;U+014D&gt;da</em> ().</p>
<p>Today, many family names have <em>ta</em> as a component, a practice which can be largely attributed to a government edict in the early <a href="Meiji_Period" title="wikilink">Meiji Period</a> which required all citizens to have a family name. Many chose a name based on some geographical feature associated with their residence or occupation, and as nearly three fourths of the population were farmers, many made family names using <em>ta</em>. Some common examples are <em><a href="Tanaka_(disambiguation)" title="wikilink">Tanaka</a></em> (), literally meaning &quot;middle of paddy field;&quot; <em><a href="Nakata_(disambiguation)" title="wikilink">Nakata</a></em> (), &quot;rice field in the middle;&quot; <em><a href="Kawada_(disambiguation)" title="wikilink">Kawada</a></em> (&lt;U+5DDD&gt;&lt;U+7530&gt;), &quot;paddy field by a river;&quot; and <em>Furuta</em> (), &quot;old paddy field.&quot;</p>
<p>In recent years rice consumption in Japan has fallen and many rice farmers are increasingly elderly. The government has <a href="subsidized" class="uri" title="wikilink">subsidized</a> rice production since the 1970s, and favors <a href="protectionist" class="uri" title="wikilink">protectionist</a> policies regarding cheaper imported rice.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a></p>

<p><img src="Namwon8.jpg" title="fig:Paddy field near Namwon, South Korea, early June." alt="Paddy field near Namwon, South Korea, early June." /> Arable land in small alluvial flats of most rural river valleys in South Korea are dedicated to paddy-field farming. Farmers assess paddy fields for any necessary repairs in February. Fields may be rebuilt, and <a href="bunding" title="wikilink">bund</a> breaches are repaired. This work is carried out until mid-March, when warmer spring weather allows the farmer to buy or grow rice seedlings. They are transplanted (usually by <a href="rice_transplanter" title="wikilink">rice transplanter</a>) from the indoors into freshly flooded paddy fields in May. Farmers tend and weed their paddy fields through the summer until around the time of <a href="Chuseok" class="uri" title="wikilink">Chuseok</a>, a traditional holiday held on August 15 of the <a href="Lunar_Calendar" title="wikilink">Lunar Calendar</a> (circa mid-September by Solar Calendar). The harvest begins in October. Coordinating the harvest can be challenging because many Korean farmers have small paddy fields in a number of locations around their villages, and modern harvesting machines are sometimes shared between extended family members. Farmers usually dry the harvested grains in the sun before bringing them to market.</p>
<p>The Chinese (or <a href="Sino-Korean_vocabulary" title="wikilink">Sino-Korean</a>) character for 'field', <em>jeon</em> (), is found in some place names, especially small farming townships and villages. However, the specific Korean term for 'paddy' is a purely Korean word, &quot;non&quot; ().</p>

<p><img src="Baobab_and_rice_field.jpg" title="fig:Baobab and rice field near Morondava." alt="Baobab and rice field near Morondava." width="200" /> In Madagascar, the average annual consumption of rice is 130 kg per person, one of the largest in the world.</p>
<p>According to a 1999 study of UPDRS / FAO:</p>
<p>The majority of rice is related to irrigation (1,054,381 ha). The choice of methods conditioning performance is determined by the variety and quality control of water ..</p>
<p>The &quot;Tavy&quot;, is traditionally the culture of flooded upland rice on burning of cleared natural rain forest (135,966 ha). Criticized as being the cause of deforestation, &quot;Tavy&quot; is still widely practiced by farmers in Madagascar, who find a good compromise between climate risks, availability of labour and food security.</p>
<p>&quot;Tanety&quot; means hill. By extension, the &quot;tanety&quot; is also growing upland rice, carried out on the grassy slopes have been deforested for the operation of charcoal. (139,337 ha)</p>
<p>Among the many varieties, rice of Madagascar include: &quot;Vary lava&quot; is a translucent long and large grain rice. It is a luxury ricer. &quot;Vary Makalioka, is translucent long and thin grain rice. &quot;Vary Rojofotsy&quot; is a -half long.grain rice &quot;Vary mena&quot; or red rice, is exclusive to Madagascar.</p>
<p>They are sought-after rice, so that the Malagasy prefer often to export them and import in return foreign rice for lower quality.</p>
<h3 id="myanmar">Myanmar</h3>
<p>Rice is grown primarily in three areas - the <a href="Irrawaddy_Delta" title="wikilink">Irrawaddy Delta</a>, the area along and the delta of the <a href="Kaladan_River" title="wikilink">Kaladan River</a>, and the Central plains around <a href="Mandalay" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mandalay</a>. Up until the later 1960s, Myanmar was the main exporter of rice. Termed the rice basket of South East Asia, much of the rice grown in Myanmar does not rely on fertilizers and pesticides, thus, although &quot;organic&quot; in a sense, it has been unable to cope with population growth and other rice economies which utilized fertilizers.</p>
<p>Rice is now grown in all the three seasons of Myanmar, though primarily in the <a href="Monsoon" class="uri" title="wikilink">Monsoon</a> season - from June to October. Rice grown in the delta areas rely heavily on the river water and sedimented minerals from the northern mountains, whilst the rice grown in the central regions require irrigation from the Ayeryarwaddy River.</p>
<p>The fields are tilled when the first rains arrive - traditionally measured at 40 days after <a href="Thingyan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Thingyan</a>, the <a href="Burmese_New_Year" title="wikilink">Burmese New Year</a> - around the beginning of June. In modern times, tractors are used, but traditionally, buffalos were employed. The rice plants are planted in nurseries and then transplanted by hand into the prepared fields. The rice is then harvested in late November - &quot;when the rice bends with age&quot;. Most of the rice planting and harvesting are done by hand. The rice is then threshed and stored, ready for the mills.</p>

<p>Paddy fields are a common sight in the Philippines. Several vast paddy fields exist in the <a href="Provinces_of_the_Philippines" title="wikilink">provinces</a> of <a href="Ifugao" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ifugao</a>, <a href="Nueva_Ecija" title="wikilink">Nueva Ecija</a>, <a href="Isabela_(province)" title="wikilink">Isabela</a>, <a href="Cagayan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Cagayan</a>, <a href="Bulacan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bulacan</a>, and other provinces. <a href="Nueva_Ecija" title="wikilink">Nueva Ecija</a> is considered the main rice growing province of the <a href="Philippines" class="uri" title="wikilink">Philippines</a> and the leading producer of onions in the Municipality of Bongabon in <a href="Southeast_Asia" title="wikilink">Southeast Asia</a>. It is currently the 9th richest <a href="Provinces_of_the_Philippines" title="wikilink">province</a> in the country.  The <a href="Banaue_Rice_Terraces" title="wikilink">Banaue Rice Terraces</a> is an example of an Paddy Fields in the country, it is located in Northern <a href="Luzon" class="uri" title="wikilink">Luzon</a>, <a href="Philippines" class="uri" title="wikilink">Philippines</a> and were built by the <a href="Ifugao" title="wikilink">Ifugaos</a> 2,000 years ago. Streams and springs found in the mountains were tapped and channeled into irrigation canals that run downhill through the rice terraces. Other notable <a href="Philippine" class="uri" title="wikilink">Philippine</a> paddy fields are the Batad Rice Terraces, the Bangaan Rice Terraces, the <a href="Mayoyao" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mayoyao</a> Rice Terraces and the Hapao Rice Terraces.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a></p>
<p>Located at Barangay Batad in Banaue, the Batad Rice Terraces are shaped like an <a href="amphitheatre" class="uri" title="wikilink">amphitheatre</a>, and can be reached by a 12-kilometer ride from Banaue Hotel and a 2-hour hike uphill through mountain trails. The Bangaan Rice Terraces portray the typical Ifugao community, where the livelihood activities are within the village and its surroundings. The Bangaan Rice Terraces is accessible in a one-hour ride from Poblacion, Banaue, then a 20-minute trek down to the village. It can be viewed best from the road to Mayoyao. The Mayoyao Rice Terraces is located at Mayoyao, 44 kilometers away from Poblacion, Banaue. The town of Mayoyao lies in the midst of these rice terraces. All dikes are tiered with flat stones. The Hapao Rice Terraces can be reached within 55 kilometers from the capital town of Lagawe. Other <a href="Ifugao" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ifugao</a> stone-walled rice terraces are located in the municipality of Hungduan.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a></p>

Around 1.5 million hectares of land is cultivated in Sri Lanka for paddy in 2008/2009 maha: 64% of which is cultivated during the dry season and 35% cultivated during the wet season. Around 879,000 farmer families are engaged in paddy cultivation in Sri Lanka. They make up 20% of the country's population and 32% of the employment.</p>

<p>Rice fields in <a href="Vietnam" class="uri" title="wikilink">Vietnam</a> (<em>ru&lt;U+1ED9&gt;ng</em>, <em>c&lt;U+00E1&gt;nh &lt;U+0111&gt;&lt;U+1ED3&gt;ng</em> or <em>&lt;U+0111&gt;i&lt;U+1EC1&gt;n</em> in Vietnamese) are the predominant land use in the valley of the <a href="Red_River_(Vietnam)" title="wikilink">Red River</a> and the <a href="Mekong_Delta" title="wikilink">Mekong Delta</a>. In the <a href="Red_River_Delta" title="wikilink">Red River Delta</a> of northern Vietnam, farmers must dam up (nowadays 3000Â km long) against the annual flood, and it is also the necessary condition to form an alliance among Vietnamese ancient tribals to found <a href="Vietnamese_people" title="wikilink">Vietnamese people</a>'s first state. In the <a href="Mekong" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mekong</a> Delta of southern Vietnam, there is an interlacing drainage and irrigation canal system that has become the symbol of this area and impacts on the lifestyle of local people. In Northwestern Vietnam, <a href="Thai_people" title="wikilink">Thai people</a> built their <em>&quot;<a href="valley_culture" title="wikilink">valley culture</a>&quot;</em> based on the economic foundation of <a href="glutinous_rice" title="wikilink">glutinous rice</a> upland fields.</p>
<p>The primary festival related to rice fields is <em>&quot;l&lt;U+1EC5&gt; h&lt;U+1EA1&gt; &lt;U+0111&gt;i&lt;U+1EC1&gt;n&quot;</em> (Vietnamese)/<em>&quot;l&lt;U+1ED3&gt;ng t&lt;U+1ED3&gt;ng&quot;</em> (<a href="Tay_people" title="wikilink">Tay</a> language) in the first day of every crop wishing for yield more than usual. In the past, this was the official national ceremony that the King would make the first plough and people would worship <a href="Than_Nong" title="wikilink">Than Nong</a> (god of agriculture), <em>th&lt;U+1ED5&gt; &lt;U+0111&gt;&lt;U+1ECB&gt;a</em> (god of the soil), <em>th&lt;U+00E0&gt;nh ho&lt;U+00E0&gt;ng l&lt;U+00E0&gt;ng</em> (god of the village), and <em>th&lt;U+1EA7&gt;n l&lt;U+00FA&gt;a</em> (god of rice plants).</p>
<p>During the <a href="Tr&lt;U+1EA7&gt;n_Dynasty" title="wikilink">Tr&lt;U+1EA7&gt;n Dynasty</a>, there were three kinds of rice field: <em>ru&lt;U+1ED9&gt;ng qu&lt;U+1ED1&gt;c kh&lt;U+1ED1&gt;</em> (national budget rice field) with 3 levels, <em>ru&lt;U+1ED9&gt;ng th&lt;U+00E1&gt;c &lt;U+0111&gt;i&lt;U+1EC1&gt;n</em> with 3 levels (the name derives from a story about <a href="L&lt;U+00EA&gt;_Ph&lt;U+1EE5&gt;ng_Hi&lt;U+1EC3&gt;u" title="wikilink">L&lt;U+00EA&gt; Ph&lt;U+1EE5&gt;ng Hi&lt;U+1EC3&gt;u</a>. He refused the King's present for his feat of arms but required that how far he would throw his knife would be how wide of a rice field he could possess. Since then, it's become the name of rice field for rewarding Vietnamese mandarins: th&lt;U+00E1&gt;c &lt;U+0111&gt;ao- abbreviation: th&lt;U+00E1&gt;c- throw the knife and &lt;U+0111&gt;i&lt;U+1EC1&gt;n- rice field), and <em>ru&lt;U+1ED9&gt;ng ao</em> of the common people.</p>
<p>In <a href="Vietnamese_literature" title="wikilink">Vietnamese literature</a>, a rice field is described as wide enough for a flock of <a href="stork" title="wikilink">storks</a> to span their wings across: &quot;<em>&lt;U+0111&gt;&lt;U+1ED3&gt;ng l&lt;U+00FA&gt;a th&lt;U+1EB3&gt;ng c&lt;U+00E1&gt;nh c&lt;U+00F2&gt; bay</em>&quot; and the sway of rice plants in the wind is compared to waves of the sea and called &quot;<em>s&lt;U+00F3&gt;ng l&lt;U+00FA&gt;a</em>&quot;. These images are very common phrases describing the beauty of the Vietnamese landscape.</p>
