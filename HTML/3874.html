<h2 id="life-and-legend">Life and legend</h2>
<p>Saint George is not commemorated in any early <em><a href="vita" class="uri" title="wikilink">vita</a></em> or <em><a href="acta" class="uri" title="wikilink">acta</a></em> that would have some merit as reflecting history and cannot be accounted a historical individual.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> Chief among the late sources is the <a href="Golden_Legend" title="wikilink">Golden Legend</a>, which remains the most familiar version in English owing to <a href="William_Caxton" title="wikilink">William Caxton</a>'s 15th century translation.</p>
<p>The traditional <a href="legend" class="uri" title="wikilink">legend</a> offers a historicised narration of George's encounter with his <a href="dragon" class="uri" title="wikilink">dragon</a>: see &quot;St. George and the Dragon&quot; below. The modern legend that follows is synthesized from early and late <a href="hagiography" title="wikilink">hagiographical sources</a>, omitting the more fantastical episodes, to narrate a purely human military career in closer harmony with modern expectations of reality.</p>
<h3 id="the-life-and-death">The Life and Death</h3>
<p>George was born to a Christian noble family during the late third century between about 275 AD and 285 AD, in Lydia Palestine. His father Geronzio was a Roman army official from Cappadocia and his mother from Palestine. They were both Christians and from noble families of Anici (can not be defeated), so by this the child was raised with Christian beliefs. They decided to call him George meaning &quot;worker of the land&quot;. At the age of 14, George lost his father; a few years later, George's mother Policronia died.</p>
<p>Then George decided to go to Nicomedeia, the imperial city of that time, and present himself to Emperor <a href="Diocletian" class="uri" title="wikilink">Diocletian</a> to apply for a career as a soldier. Diocletian welcomed him with open arms, as he had known his father Geronzio -- one of his finest soldiers. By his late 20s, George was promoted to the rank of Tribunus and stationed as an imperial guard of the Emperor at Nicomedeia.</p>
<p>In the year AD <a href="302" class="uri" title="wikilink">302</a>, Diocletian (influenced by <a href="Galerius" class="uri" title="wikilink">Galerius</a>) issued an edict that every Christian soldier in the army should be arrested and every other soldier should offer a sacrifice to the Pagan gods. But George objected and with the courage of his faith approached the Emperor and ruler. Diocletian was upset, not wanting to lose his best Tribune and the son of his best official, Geronzio. George loudly renounced the Emperor's edict, and in front his fellow soldiers and Tribunes he claimed himself to be a Christian and declared his worship of Jesus Christ. Diocletian attempted to convert George, even offering gifts of land, money and slaves if he made a sacrifice to the Pagan gods. The Emperor made many offers, but George never accepted.</p>
<p>Recognizing the futility of his efforts, Diocletian was left with no choice but to have him executed for his refusal. Before the execution George gave his wealth to the poor and prepared himself. After various torture sessions, including laceration on a wheel of swords in which he was miraculously resuscitated three times, George was executed by <a href="decapitation" class="uri" title="wikilink">decapitation</a> before Nicomedia's city wall, on <a href="April_23" title="wikilink">April 23</a>, <a href="303" class="uri" title="wikilink">303</a>. A witness of his suffering convinced Empress Alexandra and Athanasius, a pagan priest, to become Christians as well, and so they joined George in martyrdom. His body was returned to Lydda for burial, where Christians soon came to honor him as a martyr.</p>

<p><img src="George_novgorod.jpg" title="fig:A 15th-century icon of St. George from Novgorod." alt="A 15th-century icon of St. George from Novgorod." /> </p>
<p>The episode of St George and the <a href="European_dragon" title="wikilink">Dragon</a> was a myth<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> brought back with the <a href="Crusaders" class="uri" title="wikilink">Crusaders</a> and retold with the courtly appurtenances belonging to the <a href="Romance_(genre)" title="wikilink">genre of Romance</a> (Loomis; Whatley). The earliest known depiction of the <a href="mytheme" class="uri" title="wikilink">mytheme</a> is from early eleventh-century <a href="Cappadocia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Cappadocia</a> (Whatley), (in the <a href="iconography" class="uri" title="wikilink">iconography</a> of the <a href="Eastern_Orthodox_Church" title="wikilink">Eastern Orthodox Church</a>, George had been depicted as a <a href="soldier" class="uri" title="wikilink">soldier</a> since at least the seventh century); the earliest known surviving narrative text is an eleventh-century Georgian text (Whatley).</p>
<p>In the fully-developed Western version, a dragon makes its nest at the <a href="spring_(hydrosphere)" title="wikilink">spring</a> that provides water for the city of &quot;Silene&quot; (perhaps modern <a href="Cyrene,_Libya" title="wikilink">Cyrene</a>) in Libya or the city of <a href="Lydda" class="uri" title="wikilink">Lydda</a>, depending on the source. Consequently, the citizens have to dislodge the dragon from its nest for a time, in order to collect water. To do so, each day they offer the dragon at first a sheep, and if no sheep can be found, then a maiden must go instead of the sheep. The victim is chosen by drawing lots. One day, this happens to be the <a href="princess" class="uri" title="wikilink">princess</a>. The <a href="monarch" class="uri" title="wikilink">monarch</a> begs for her life with no result. She is offered to the dragon, but there appears the saint on his travels. He faces the dragon, protects himself with the <a href="sign_of_the_cross" title="wikilink">sign of the cross</a>,<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> slays it and rescues the princess. The grateful citizens abandon their ancestral <a href="paganism" class="uri" title="wikilink">paganism</a> and convert to Christianity.</p>
<p>The dragon motif was first combined with the standardized <em>Passio Georgii</em> in <a href="Vincent_of_Beauvais" title="wikilink">Vincent of Beauvais</a>' encyclopedic <em>Speculum historale</em> and then in <a href="Jacobus_de_Voragine" title="wikilink">Jacobus de Voragine</a>, <em><a href="Golden_Legend" title="wikilink">Golden Legend</a></em>, which guaranteed its popularity in the later Middle Ages as a literary and pictorial subject (Whatley).</p>
<p>The parallels with <a href="Perseus" class="uri" title="wikilink">Perseus</a> and <a href="Andromeda_(mythology)" title="wikilink">Andromeda</a> are inescapable. In the <a href="allegory" title="wikilink">allegorical</a> reading, the dragon embodies a suppressed <a href="Cult_(religion)" title="wikilink">pagan cult</a>.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> The story has roots that predate Christianity. Examples such as <a href="Sabazios" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sabazios</a>, the <a href="sky_father" title="wikilink">sky father</a>, who was usually depicted riding on horseback, and <a href="Zeus" class="uri" title="wikilink">Zeus</a>'s defeat of <a href="Typhon" class="uri" title="wikilink">Typhon</a> the <a href="Titan_(mythology)" title="wikilink">Titan</a> in <a href="Greek_mythology" title="wikilink">Greek mythology</a>, along with examples from <a href="Germanic_paganism" title="wikilink">Germanic</a> and <a href="Historical_Vedic_religion" title="wikilink">Vedic traditions</a>, have led a number of historians, such as Loomis, to suggest that George is a <a href="Christianization" title="wikilink">Christianized</a> version of older deities in Indo-European culture.</p>
<p>In the medieval romances, the lance with which St George slew the dragon was called <a href="Ascalon" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ascalon</a>, named after the city of <a href="Ashkelon" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ashkelon</a> in <a href="Israel" class="uri" title="wikilink">Israel</a>. <a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>

<p>A church built in Lydda during the reign of <a href="Constantine_I_of_the_Roman_Empire" title="wikilink">Constantine I</a> (reigned 306–337), was consecrated to &quot;a man of the highest distinction&quot;, according to the church history of <a href="Eusebius_of_Caesarea" title="wikilink">Eusebius of Caesarea</a>; the name of the patron<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> was not disclosed, but later he was asserted to have been George. The church was destroyed in 1010 but was later rebuilt and dedicated to Saint George by the <a href="Crusade" title="wikilink">Crusaders</a>. In 1191 and during the conflict known as the <a href="Third_Crusade" title="wikilink">Third Crusade</a> (1189–1192), the church was again destroyed by the forces of <a href="Saladin" class="uri" title="wikilink">Saladin</a>, Sultan of the <a href="Ayyubid_dynasty" title="wikilink">Ayyubid dynasty</a> (reigned 1171–1193). A new church was erected in 1872 and is still standing.</p>
<p>During the fourth century the veneration of George spread from Palestine through Lebanon to the rest of the <a href="Eastern_Roman_Empire" title="wikilink">Eastern Roman Empire</a> -though the martyr is not mentioned in the Syriac <a href="Breviarium" class="uri" title="wikilink">Breviarium</a><a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a>- and <a href="Georgia_(country)" title="wikilink">Georgia</a>. In Georgia the feast day on November 23 is credited to <a href="Saint_Nino" title="wikilink">St Nino</a> of <a href="Cappadocia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Cappadocia</a>, who in Georgian hagiography is a relative of St George, credited with bringing Christianity to the Georgians in the fourth century. By the fifth century the <a href="cult_(religion)" title="wikilink">cult</a> of Saint George had reached the <a href="Western_Roman_Empire" title="wikilink">Western Roman Empire</a> as well: in 494, George was canonised as a <a href="saint" class="uri" title="wikilink">saint</a> by <a href="Pope_Gelasius_I" title="wikilink">Pope Gelasius I</a>, among those &quot;whose names are justly reverenced among men, but whose acts are known only to [God].&quot;</p>

<p>In England the earliest dedication to George, who was mentioned among the martyrs by <a href="Bede" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bede</a>, is a church at Fordington, Dorset, that is mentioned in the will of <a href="Alfred_the_Great" title="wikilink">Alfred the Great</a>. &quot;Saint George and his feast day began to gain more widespread fame among all Europeans, however, from the time of the Crusades.&quot;<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> An apparition of George heartened the Franks at the <a href="siege_of_Antioch" title="wikilink">siege of Antioch</a>, 1098, and made a similar appearance the following year at Jerusalem. Chivalric military <a href="Order_of_St._George" title="wikilink">Order of St. George</a> were established in <a href="Aragon" class="uri" title="wikilink">Aragon</a> (1201), <a href="Republic_of_Genoa" title="wikilink">Genoa</a>, <a href="Hungary" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hungary</a>, and by <a href="Frederick_III,_Holy_Roman_Emperor" title="wikilink">Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor</a>, <a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> and <a href="Edward_III_of_England" title="wikilink">Edward III</a> put his <a href="Order_of_the_Garter" title="wikilink">Order of the Garter</a> under the banner of St. George. In England the Synod of Oxford, 1222 declared St. George's Day a feast day in the kingdom of England. The chronicler <a href="Froissart" class="uri" title="wikilink">Froissart</a> observed the English invoking St. George as a battle cry on several occasions during the <a href="Hundred_Years&#39;_War" title="wikilink">Hundred Years' War</a>. In his rise as a national saint George was aided by the very fact that the saint had no legendary connection with England, and no specifically localised shrine, as of <a href="Thomas_Becket" title="wikilink">Thomas Becket</a> at Canterbury: &quot;Consequently, numerous shrines were established during the late fifteenth century,&quot; Muriel C. McClendon has written,<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> &quot;and his did not become closely identified with a particular occupation or with the cure of a specific malady.&quot;</p>
<p>The establishment of George as a popular saint and protective giant<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> in the West that had captured the medieval imagination was codified by the official elevation of his feast to a <em>festum duplex</em><a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> at a church council in 1415, on the date that had become associated with his martyrdom, 23 April. There was wide latitude from community to community in celebration of the day across late medieval and early modern England,<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> and no uniform &quot;national&quot; celebration elsewhere, a token of the popular and vernacular nature of George's <em>cultus</em> and its local horizons, supported by a local <a href="guild" class="uri" title="wikilink">guild</a> or confraternity under George's protection, or the dedication of a local church. When the Reformation in England severely curtailed the saints' days in the calendar, St. George's Day was among the holidays that continued to be observed.</p>
<h2 id="sources">Sources</h2>
<p>According to the <em><a href="Catholic_Encyclopedia" title="wikilink">Catholic Encyclopedia</a></em>, the earliest text preserving fragments of George's narrative is in an <a href="Acta_Sanctorum" title="wikilink">Acta Sanctorum</a> identified by <a href="Hippolyte_Delehaye" title="wikilink">Hippolyte Delehaye</a> of the scholarly <a href="Bollandists" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bollandists</a> to be a <a href="palimpsest" class="uri" title="wikilink">palimpsest</a> of the fifth century. The compiler of this <em><a href="Acta" class="uri" title="wikilink">Acta</a></em>, according to Hippolyte Delehaye &quot;confused the martyr with his namesake, the celebrated <a href="George_of_Cappadocia" title="wikilink">George of Cappadocia</a>, the <a href="Arianism" title="wikilink">Arian</a> intruder into the see of Alexandria and enemy of St. <a href="Athanasius" class="uri" title="wikilink">Athanasius</a>&quot;. A critical edition of a Syriac <em>Acta</em> of Saint George, accompanied by an annoted English translation was published by E.W. Brooks (1863-1955) in 1925. The hagiography was originally written in Greek.</p>

<p>In Sweden, the princess rescued by Saint George is held to represent the kingdom of Sweden, while the dragon represents an invading army. Several sculptures of Saint George battling the dragon can be found in Stockholm, the earliest inside Storkyrkan (&quot;The Great Church&quot;) in the Old Town.</p>

<h2 id="iconography">Iconography</h2>
<p>St. George is most commonly depicted in early <a href="icons" class="uri" title="wikilink">icons</a>, <a href="mosaic" title="wikilink">mosaics</a> and <a href="fresco" title="wikilink">frescos</a> wearing armour contemporary with the depiction, executed in gilding and silver colour, intended to identify him as a <a href="Roman_army" title="wikilink">Roman soldier</a>. After the <a href="Fall_of_Constantinople" title="wikilink">Fall of Constantinople</a> and the association of St George with the <a href="crusades" class="uri" title="wikilink">crusades</a>, he is more often portrayed mounted upon a <a href="White_horse_(mythology)" title="wikilink">white horse</a>.</p>
<p>At the same time St George began to be associated with <a href="St._Demetrius" title="wikilink">St. Demetrius</a>, another early <a href="soldier_saint" title="wikilink">soldier saint</a>. When the two saints are portrayed together mounted upon horses, they may be likened to earthly manifestations of the archangels <a href="Michael_(archangel)" title="wikilink">Michael</a> and <a href="Gabriel" class="uri" title="wikilink">Gabriel</a>. St George is always depicted in Eastern traditions upon a white horse and St. Demetrius on a red horse<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> St George can also be identified in the act of spearing a dragon, unlike St Demetrius, who is sometimes shown spearing a human figure, understood to represent <a href="Maximian" class="uri" title="wikilink">Maximian</a>.</p>

<p>During the early second millennium, George came to be seen as the model of <a href="chivalry" class="uri" title="wikilink">chivalry</a>, and during this time was depicted in works of <a href="literature" class="uri" title="wikilink">literature</a>, such as the <a href="medieval_romance" title="wikilink">medieval romances</a>.</p>

Its 177 chapters (182 in other editions) contain the story of Saint George.</p>
<p>Modern Russians interpret the icon not as a killing but as a struggle, against ourselves and the evil among us. The dragon never dies but the saint persists with his horse (will and support of the people) and his spear (technical means). This is a useful symbol for modern technocrats, especially in fields such as public health.</p>

<p>The &quot;Colours of Saint George&quot;, or <a href="St_George&#39;s_Cross" title="wikilink">St George's Cross</a>) are a white flag with a red cross, frequently borne by entities over which he is patron (e.g. <a href="England" class="uri" title="wikilink">England</a>, <a href="Georgia_(country)" title="wikilink">Georgia</a>, <a href="Liguria" class="uri" title="wikilink">Liguria</a>, <a href="Catalonia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Catalonia</a> etc).</p>
<p>The origin of the St George's Cross came from the earlier plain white tunics worn by the early crusaders.</p>

<p>St. George is praised by the Bulgarians as &quot;liberator of captives, and defender of the poor, physician of the sick&quot;. For centuries he has been considered by the Bulgarians as their protector. Possibly the most celebrated name day in the country, St George's Day (&lt;U+0413&gt;&lt;U+0435&gt;&lt;U+0440&gt;&lt;U+0433&gt;&lt;U+044C&gt;&lt;U+043E&gt;&lt;U+0432&gt;&lt;U+0434&gt;&lt;U+0435&gt;&lt;U+043D&gt;, Gergyovden) is a public holiday that takes place on 6 May every year. A common ritual is to prepare and eat a whole lamb. St. George is the patron saint of farmers and shepherds.</p>
<p>St. George's Day is also the Day of the Bulgarian Army (made official with a decree of Knyaz Alexander of Bulgaria on 9 January 1880) and parades are organised in the capital Sofia to present the best of the army's equipment and manpower.</p>

<p>Traces of the cult of St George predate the Norman Conquest, in ninth-century liturgy used at <a href="Durham_Cathedral" title="wikilink">Durham Cathedral</a>, in a tenth-century Anglo-Saxon martyrology, and in dedications to Saint George at <a href="Fordingham" class="uri" title="wikilink">Fordingham</a>, Dorset, at <a href="Thetford,_Norfolk" title="wikilink">Thetford</a>, <a href="Southwark" class="uri" title="wikilink">Southwark</a> and <a href="Doncaster" class="uri" title="wikilink">Doncaster</a>. He received further impetus when the crusaders returned from the Holy Land in the 12th century. King <a href="Edward_III_of_England" title="wikilink">Edward III of England</a> (reigned 1327 – 1377) was known for promoting the codes of <a href="knighthood" class="uri" title="wikilink">knighthood</a> and in 1348 founded the <a href="Order_of_the_Garter" title="wikilink">Order of the Garter</a>. During his reign, George came to be recognised as the <a href="patron_saint" title="wikilink">patron saint</a> of the English monarchy; prior to this, <a href="Edmund_the_Martyr" title="wikilink">Saint Edmund</a> had been considered the patron saint of England, although his veneration had waned since the time of the <a href="Norman_conquest" title="wikilink">Norman conquest</a>, and his cult was partly eclipsed by that of <a href="Edward_the_Confessor" title="wikilink">Edward the Confessor</a>. Edward dedicated the chapel at <a href="Windsor_Castle" title="wikilink">Windsor Castle</a> to the soldier saint who represented the knightly values of <a href="chivalry" class="uri" title="wikilink">chivalry</a> which he so much admired, and the Garter ceremony takes place there every year. In the 16th century, <a href="William_Shakespeare" title="wikilink">William Shakespeare</a> firmly placed St George within the national conscience in his play <a href="Henry_V_(play)" title="wikilink">Henry V</a> in which the English troops are rallied with the cry &lt;U+201C&gt;God for Harry, England and St George,&lt;U+201D&gt; and <a href="Edmund_Spenser" title="wikilink">Edmund Spenser</a> included St. George (Redcross Knight) as a central figure in his epic poem <a href="The_Faerie_Queen" title="wikilink">The Faerie Queen</a>.</p>

<p>In 1963, in the Roman Catholic Church, St George was demoted to a third class minor saint and removed him from the Universal Calendar, with the proviso that he could be honoured in local calendars. <a href="Pope_John_Paul_II" title="wikilink">Pope John Paul II</a>, in 2000, restored St George to the Calendar, and he appears in <a href="Missal" title="wikilink">Missals</a> as the English Patron Saint.</p>
<p>With the revival of Scottish and Welsh nationalism, there has been renewed interest within England in Saint George, whose memory had been in abeyance for many years. This is most evident in the St George's flags which now have replaced <a href="Union_Flag" title="wikilink">Union Flags</a> in stadiums where English sports teams compete. <a href="St_George&lt;U+2019&gt;s_Day" title="wikilink">St George&lt;U+2019&gt;s Day</a> is celebrated each year in the City of <a href="London" class="uri" title="wikilink">London</a> with a day of celebration run by the Greater London Authority and the London Mayor.

<p>Saint George is a patron saint of <a href="Georgia_(country)" title="wikilink">Georgia</a>. According to Georgian author Enriko Gabisashvili, Saint George is most venerated in the nation of <a href="Georgian_people" title="wikilink">Georgia</a>. An 18th century Georgian geographer and historian <a href="Vakhushti_Bagrationi" title="wikilink">Vakhushti Bagrationi</a> wrote that there are 365 Orthodox churches in Georgia named after Saint George according to the number of days in one year. <a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> There are indeed many churches in Georgia named after the Saint and <a href="Alaverdi_(monastery)" title="wikilink">Alaverdi Monastery</a> is one of the largest.</p>
<p>The Georgian Orthodox Church commemorates St. George's day twice a year, on May 6 (O.C. April 23) and November 23. The feast day in November was instituted by <a href="Saint_Nino" title="wikilink">St Nino</a> of <a href="Cappadocia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Cappadocia</a>, who was credited with bringing Christianity to the land of Georgia in the fourth century. She was from Cappadocia, like Saint George, and was his relative. This feast day is unique to Georgia and it is the day of St George's <a href="martyrdom" class="uri" title="wikilink">martyrdom</a>.</p>

<p>There are also many <a href="folk" class="uri" title="wikilink">folk</a> traditions in Georgia that vary from <a href="Georgian_Orthodox_Church" title="wikilink">Georgian Orthodox Church</a> rules, because they portray the Saint differently than the Church does and show the veneration of Saint George in common people of Georgia. Different regions of Georgia have different traditions and in most folk tales Saint George is venerated very highly, almost as much as <a href="Jesus_Christ" title="wikilink">Jesus Christ</a> himself. In the province of <a href="Kakheti" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kakheti</a> province, there is an icon of St George known as <em>&quot;White George&quot;</em>. This image of <em>White George</em> is also seen on the current Coat of Arms of Georgia. The region of Pshavi have icons of known as the <em>Cuppola St. George</em> and <em>Lashari St. George</em>. The <a href="Khevsureti" class="uri" title="wikilink">Khevsureti</a> region has <em>&quot;Kakhmati&quot;, &quot;Gudani&quot;, and &quot;Sanebi&quot;</em> icons dedicated to the Saint. The Pshavs and Khevsurs, during the <a href="Middle_Ages" title="wikilink">Middle Ages</a> used to refer to Saint George almost as much as praying to <a href="God" class="uri" title="wikilink">God</a> and the <a href="Blessed_Virgin_Mary" title="wikilink">Blessed Virgin Mary</a>. Another notable icon is known as the <em>&quot;Lomisi Saint George&quot;</em> which can be found in the <a href="Mtiuleti" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mtiuleti</a> and <a href="Khevi" class="uri" title="wikilink">Khevi</a> provinces of Georgia.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a></p>

<p>An example of folk tale about St. George: Once the Lord <a href="Jesus_Christ" title="wikilink">Jesus Christ</a>, the prophet <a href="Elijah" title="wikilink">Elias</a> and Saint George were going through Georgia. When they became tired and hungry they stopped to dine. They saw a Georgian shepherd man and decided to ask him to feed them. First, Elias went up to the shepherd and asked him for a sheep. After the shepherd asked his identity Elias said that, he was the one who sent him rain to get him a good profit from farming. The shepherd became angry at him and told him that he was the one who also sent thunderstorms, which destroyed the farms of poor widows.</p>
<p>After Elias, Jesus Christ himself went up to the shepherd and asked him for a sheep and told him that he was God, the creator of everything. The shepherd became angry at Jesus and told him that he is the one who takes the souls away of young men and grants long lives to many dishonest people.</p>
<p>After Elias and Christ's unsuccessful attempts, St George went up to the shepherd, asked him for a sheep and told him that he is Saint George who the shepherd calls upon every time when he has troubles and St. George protect him from all the evil and saves him from troubles. After hearing St George, the shepherd fell down on his knees and adored him and gave him everything. This folk tale shows the veneration of St George in the Middle Ages provinces of Georgia and similar tales are told in the northern mountainous parts of the country.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>
<p>Some interesting tales come from Georgian sources, some of which are also attested to by <a href="Persia" title="wikilink">Persian</a> ones, that the Georgian Army during many battles were led by a knight on the white horse who came down from the Heaven. Catholicos Besarion of Georgia also testified this fact.</p>

The historical bank that was the backbone of the <a href="Republic_of_Genoa" title="wikilink">Republic of Genoa</a>, &quot;Repubblica Marinara di Genova&quot;, was dedicated to St George, &quot;Banco di San Giorgio&quot;. The power of the <em>Repubblica</em> passing from commerce to banking, Genoa lent money to all the European countries and sovereigns, so the power of the &quot;Repubblica&quot; was identified with its patron saint.</p>
<p>Throughout the province of Ferrara the cult of Saint George is remarkable for a medieval belief that the dragon Saint George defeated inhabited the Po. Actually the dragon has to be considered as a metaphor for the fear of Po river frequent floods that threatened to completely destroy Ferrara and the small hamlets next to it. The former cathedral and the newer 12th century basilique cathedral of the city (<a href="Ferrara_Cathedral" title="wikilink">Ferrara Cathedral</a>) are both dedicated to the legendary Saint.</p>

<h2 id="interfaith-shrine">Interfaith shrine</h2>
<p>There is a tradition in the Holy Land of Christians and Muslim going to an <a href="Eastern_Orthodox_Church" title="wikilink">Eastern Orthodox</a> shrine for St. George at <a href="Beit_Jala" title="wikilink">Beith Jala</a>, Jews also attending the site in the belief that the prophet <a href="Elijah" class="uri" title="wikilink">Elijah</a> was buried there. This is testified to by <a href="Elizabeth_Finn" title="wikilink">Elizabeth Finn</a> in 1866, where she wrote, &lt;U+201C&gt;St. George killed the dragon in this country <a href="Palestine" class="uri" title="wikilink">Palestine</a>; and the place is shown close to <a href="Beirut" title="wikilink">Beyrut</a> . Many churches and convents are named after him. The church at Lydda is dedicated to St. George: so is a convent near Bethlehem, and another small one just opposite the Jaffa gate; and others beside. The Arabs believe that St. George can restore mad people to their senses; and to say a person has been sent to St. George&lt;U+2019&gt;s, is equivalent to saying he has been sent to a madhouse. It is singular that the Moslem Arabs share this veneration for St. George, and send their mad people to be cured by him, as well as the Christians. But they commonly call him El Khudder &lt;U+2014&gt;The Green&lt;U+2014&gt;according to their favorite manner of using epithets instead of names. Why he should be called green, however, I cannot tell&lt;U+2014&gt;unless it is from the colour of his horse. Gray horses are called green in Arabic.&lt;U+201D&gt; <a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> A possible explanation for this colour reference is Al Khidr, the erstwhile tutor of Moses, gained his name from having sat in a barren desert, turning it into a lush green paradise. See above for the association of Al Khidder and St George.</p>
<p><a href="William_Dalrymple_(historian)" title="wikilink">William Dalrymple</a> reviewing the literature in 1999 tells us that J.E. Hanauer in his 1907 book <em>Folklore of the Holy Land: Muslim, Christian and Jewish</em> &quot;mentioned a shrine in the village of Beit Jala, beside Bethlehem, which at the time was frequented by all three of Palestine&lt;U+2019&gt;s religious communities. Christians regarded it as the birthplace of St. George, Jews as the burial place of the Prophet Elias, Muslims as the home of the legendary saint of fertility known simply as <a href="Al-Khidr" title="wikilink">Khidr</a>, Arabic for green. According to Hanauer, in his day the monastery was &lt;U+201C&gt;a sort of madhouse. Deranged persons of all the three faiths are taken thither and chained in the court of the chapel, where they are kept for forty days on bread and water, the <a href="Eastern_Orthodox_Church" title="wikilink">Eastern Orthodox</a> priest at the head of the establishment now and then reading the Gospel over them, or administering a whipping as the case demands.&lt;U+2019&gt;<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> In the 1920&lt;U+2019&gt;s according to <a href="Tawfiq_Canaan" title="wikilink">Taufiq Canaan</a>&lt;U+2019&gt;s <em>Mohammedan Saints and Sanctuaries in Palestine</em>, nothing seemed to have changed, and all three communities were still visiting the shrine and praying together.&quot;<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a></p>
<p>Dalrymple himself visited the place in 1995 &quot;I asked around in the Christian Quarter in Jerusalem, and discovered that the pace was very much alive. With all the greatest shrines in the Christian world to choose from, it seemed that when the local Arab Christians had a problem &lt;U+2013&gt; an illness, or something more complicated: a husband detained in an Israeli prison camp, for example &lt;U+2013&gt; they preferred to seek the intercession of St George in his grubby little shrine at Beit Jala rather than praying at the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem or the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem.&quot;<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> He asked the priest at the shrine &quot;Do you get many Muslims coming here?&quot; The priest replied, &quot;We get hundreds! Almost as many as the Christian pilgrims. Often, when I come in here, I find Muslims all over the floor, in the aisles, up and down.&quot;<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a><a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a><a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a></p>
<p>The <em>Encyclop&lt;U+00E6&gt;dia Britannica</em> quotes G.A. Smith in his <em>Historic Geography of the Holy Land</em> p. 164 saying &lt;U+201C&gt;The Mahommedans who usually identify St. George with the prophet Elijah, at Lydda confound his legend with one about Christ himself. Their name for Antichrist is Dajjal, and they have a tradition that Jesus will slay Antichrist by the gate of Lydda. The notion sprang from an ancient <a href="bas-relief" class="uri" title="wikilink">bas-relief</a> of George and the Dragon on the Lydda church. But Dajjal may be derived, by a very common confusion between n and l, from Dagon, whose name two neighboring villages bear to this day, while one of the gates of Lydda used to be called the Gate of Dagon.&lt;U+201D&gt;<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a></p>

<li id="fn3">Robertson, <em>The Medieval Saints' Lives</em> (pp 51-52) suggested that the dragon motif was transferred to the George legend from that of his fellow <a href="soldier_saint" title="wikilink">soldier saint</a>, <a href="Saint_Theodore_Tiro" title="wikilink">Saint Theodore Tiro</a>. The Roman Catholic writer <a href="Alban_Butler" title="wikilink">Alban Butler</a> (<em>Lives of the Saints</em>) was at pains to credit the motif as a late addition: &quot;It should be noted, however, that the story of the dragon, though given so much prominence, was a later accretion, of which we have no sure traces before the twelfth century. This puts out of court the attempts made by many folklorists to present St. George as no more than a <a href="Christianization" title="wikilink">christianized survival</a> of pagan mythology.&quot;<a href="#fnref3" class="footnote-back">↩</a></li>
<li id="fn4">&quot;He drew out his sword and garnished him with the sign of the cross, and rose hardily against the dragon which came toward him, and smote him with his spear and hurt him sore, and threw him to the ground&quot;, according to Jacobus de Voragine, <em>The Golden Legend: or Lives of the Saints as Englished by William Caxton</em>, F.S.
