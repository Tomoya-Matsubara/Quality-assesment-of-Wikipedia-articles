<p>The <strong>Calgary Stampede</strong> is an annual <a href="rodeo" class="uri" title="wikilink">rodeo</a>, <a href="fair" title="wikilink">exhibition</a> and <a href="festival" class="uri" title="wikilink">festival</a> held every July in <a href="Calgary" class="uri" title="wikilink">Calgary</a>, <a href="Alberta" class="uri" title="wikilink">Alberta</a>, Canada. The ten-day event, which bills itself as &quot;The Greatest Outdoor Show on Earth&quot;,<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> attracts over one million visitors per year and features the world's largest rodeo, a <a href="parade" class="uri" title="wikilink">parade</a>, <a href="Midway_(fair)" title="wikilink">midway</a>, <a href="stage_show" title="wikilink">stage shows</a>, <a href="concert" title="wikilink">concerts</a>, agricultural competitions, <a href="chuckwagon_racing" title="wikilink">chuckwagon racing</a> and <a href="First_Nations" title="wikilink">First Nations</a> exhibitions.</p>
<p>The event's roots are traced to 1886 when the Calgary and District Agricultural Society held its first fair. American promoter <a href="Guy_Weadick" title="wikilink">Guy Weadick</a> launched his first rodeo and festival in 1912 and returned to Calgary in 1919 to organize the Victory Stampede in honour soldiers returning from World War I. It became an annual event in 1923 when Weadick's festival merged with the Calgary Industrial Exhibition to create the <strong>Calgary Exhibition and Stampede</strong>.</p>
<p>Organized by thousands of volunteers and supported by civic leaders, the Calgary Stampede has grown into one of the world's richest rodeos, one of Canada's largest festivals and a significant tourist attraction for the city. Rodeo and chuckwagon racing events are televised across Canada. However, both have been the target of increasing criticism by <a href="animal_welfare" title="wikilink">animal welfare</a> groups concerned about particular events as well as <a href="animal_rights" title="wikilink">animal rights</a> organizations seeking to ban rodeo in general.</p>
<p>Calgary's national and international identity is tied to the event. It is known as the &quot;Stampede City&quot;, carries the informal nickname of &quot;Cowtown&quot; and the local <a href="Canadian_Football_League" title="wikilink">Canadian Football League</a> team is called the <a href="Calgary_Stampeders" title="wikilink">Stampeders</a>. The city takes on a party atmosphere during Stampede: office buildings and storefronts are painted in cowboy themes, residents don <a href="western_wear" title="wikilink">western wear</a> and events held across the city include hundreds of pancake breakfasts and <a href="barbecue" title="wikilink">barbecues</a>.</p>

In each corner is a photograph of four different middle-aged well-dressed gentlemen." /> The Calgary and District Agricultural Society was formed in 1884 to promote the town and encourage farmers and ranchers from eastern Canada to move west. The society held its first <a href="fair" class="uri" title="wikilink">fair</a> two years later, attracting a quarter of the town's 2,000 residents.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> By 1889, it had acquired land on the banks of the <a href="Elbow_River" title="wikilink">Elbow River</a> to host the exhibitions, but crop failures, poor weather and a declining economy resulted in the society ceasing operations in 1895.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> The land passed briefly to future <a href="Prime_Minister_of_Canada" title="wikilink">Prime Minister</a> <a href="R._B._Bennett" title="wikilink">R. B. Bennett</a> who sold it to the city. The area was called <a href="Beltline,_Calgary" title="wikilink">Victoria Park</a>, after <a href="Victoria_of_the_United_Kingdom" title="wikilink">Queen Victoria</a>, and the newly formed Western Pacific Exhibition Company hosted its first agricultural and industrial fair in 1899.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>The exhibition grew annually, and in 1908 the Government of Canada announced that Calgary would host the federally funded Dominion Exhibition that year. Seeking to take advantage of the opportunity to promote itself, the city spent <a href="Canadian_dollar" title="wikilink">C$</a>145,000 to build six new pavilions and a racetrack.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> It held a lavish parade, <a href="rodeo" class="uri" title="wikilink">rodeo</a>, horse racing and <a href="trick_roping" title="wikilink">trick roping</a> competitions as part of the event.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> The exhibition was a success, drawing 100,000 people to the fairgrounds over seven days despite an economic recession that afflicted the city of 25,000.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p><a href="Guy_Weadick" title="wikilink">Guy Weadick</a>, an American trick roper who participated in the Dominion Exhibition as part of the <a href="Miller_Brothers_101_Ranch" title="wikilink">Miller Brothers 101 Ranch</a> Real Wild West Show, returned to Calgary in 1912 in the hopes of establishing an event that more accurately represented the &quot;wild west&quot; than the shows he was a part of.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> With the assistance of local livestock agent H. C. McMullen, Weadick convinced businessmen <a href="Patrick_Burns_(politician)" title="wikilink">Pat Burns</a>, <a href="George_Lane_(politician)" title="wikilink">George Lane</a>, <a href="Archie_McLean_(politician)" title="wikilink">A. J. MacLean</a>, and <a href="A._E._Cross" title="wikilink">A. E.

<p>Weadick set about planning the 1913 Stampede, promoting the event across North America. However, the Big Four were not interested in hosting another such event.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> Businessmen in <a href="Winnipeg" class="uri" title="wikilink">Winnipeg</a> convinced Weadick to host his second Stampede in their city, but the show failed financially. A third attempt held in <a href="New_York" title="wikilink">New York</a> State in 1916 suffered the same fate.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> Weadick returned to Calgary in 1919 where he gained the support of E. L. Richardson, the general manager of the Calgary Industrial Exhibition. The two convinced numerous Calgarians, including the Big Four, to back the &quot;Great Victory Stampede&quot; in celebration of Canada's soldiers returning from <a href="World_War_I" title="wikilink">World War I</a>.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="calgary-exhibition-and-stampede">Calgary Exhibition and Stampede</h3>
<p>While the 1919 Stampede was successful, it was again held as a one-time event. Richardson was convinced that it could be a profitable annual event but found little support for the concept within the board of directors of the Calgary Industrial Exhibition. However, declining attendance and mounting financial losses forced the exhibition board to reconsider Richardson's proposals at their 1922 annual meeting.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> Richardson proposed merging the two events on a trial basis. Weadick agreed, and the union created the Calgary Exhibition and Stampede.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
<p><img src="1923_Calgary_Stampede_parade.jpg" title="fig:1923 Stampede parade|alt=Hundreds of men on horseback march down a city street as people observe from the sidewalks and rooftops." alt="1923 Stampede parade|alt=Hundreds of men on horseback march down a city street as people observe from the sidewalks and rooftops." /> The combined event was first held in 1923. Weadick encouraged the city's residents to dress in western clothes and decorate their businesses in the spirit of the &quot;wild west&quot;.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> Civic leaders truly supported the event for the first time: Mayor <a href="George_Harry_Webster" title="wikilink">George Webster</a> followed the costume suggestion and allowed downtown roads to be closed for two hours each morning of the six-day event to accommodate street parties.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> The new sport of <a href="chuckwagon_racing" title="wikilink">chuckwagon racing</a> was introduced and proved immediately popular.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> 138,950 people attended and the event earned a profit.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> Over 167,000 people attended in 1924 and the success guaranteed that the Stampede and Exhibition would be held together permanently.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a></p>
<p>Attendance grew annually throughout the 1920s, peaking at 258,496 in 1928, but the onset of the <a href="Great_Depression" title="wikilink">Great Depression</a> resulted in attendance declines and financial losses. After consecutive years of losses in 1930 and 1931, the exhibition board was forced to make cutbacks, a decision that strained the relationship between the board and Weadick.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> Furthering the divide was Weadick's growing resentment of the board's control of what he considered his event. The issue came to a head in 1932 when Weadick and Richardson engaged in a loud argument over the situation, ending with Weadick's threat to quit entirely.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> One month later, the exhibition board announced that it had relieved him of his duties.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> Angered by the decision, Weadick sued the exhibition board for $100,000, citing breach of contract and unfair dismissal.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> His claim was upheld in courts, but he was awarded only $2,750 plus legal fees.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> Embittered by the events, Weadick remained at odds with the board for 20 years until he was invited to the 1952 Stampede as an honoured guest and parade marshal.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a></p>
<p>At least seven movies were filmed at the Stampede by 1950. The most profitable, the 1925 <a href="silent_movie" title="wikilink">silent film</a> <em>The Calgary Stampede</em>, used footage from the rodeo and exposed people across North America to the event.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> <a href="Hollywood" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hollywood</a> stars and foreign dignitaries were attracted to the Stampede; <a href="Bob_Hope" title="wikilink">Bob Hope</a> and <a href="Bing_Crosby" title="wikilink">Bing Crosby</a> each served as parade marshals during the 1950s,<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> while Queen <a href="Elizabeth_II" title="wikilink">Elizabeth II</a> and Prince <a href="Prince_Philip,_Duke_of_Edinburgh" title="wikilink">Philip</a> made their first of two visits to the event as part of their 1959 tour of Canada.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> The Queen also opened the 1973 Stampede.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a></p>

<p>The discovery of the <a href="Leduc_No._1" title="wikilink">Leduc No. 1</a> oil well in 1946 and major reserves in the <a href="Turner_Valley,_Alberta" title="wikilink">Turner Valley</a> area southwest of the city ushered in a period of growth and prosperity. Calgary was transformed from an agricultural community into the oil and gas capital of Canada.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> The city's population nearly doubled between 1949 and 1956, and Calgary's immigrant population not only embraced the Stampede, but encouraged friends and family in their home towns to do the same.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> The 1950s represented the golden age of the Calgary Stampede.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a></p>

<p>Attendance continued to grow throughout the 1960s and 1970s, topping 500,000 for the first time in 1962 and reaching 654,000 in 1966.

Parade day serves as an unofficial holiday as many companies give employees half or full days off to attend.<a href="#fn179" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref179"><sup>179</sup></a> People of all walks of life, from executives to students, discard formal attire for casual western dress, typically represented by <a href="Wrangler_(jeans)" title="wikilink">Wrangler jeans</a> and <a href="cowboy_hat" title="wikilink">cowboy hats</a>.<a href="#fn180" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref180"><sup>180</sup></a> Many Calgarians have reduced productivity during the event because they take a relaxed attitude towards their usual workplace and personal responsibilities.<a href="#fn181" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref181"><sup>181</sup></a></p>

<h3 id="stampede-parties">Stampede parties</h3>
<p>The size and number of parties each year during Stampede is viewed as an indicator of Calgary's economic strength.<a href="#fn189" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref189"><sup>189</sup></a> Corporations and community groups hold lavish events throughout the city for their staff and clients,<a href="#fn190" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref190"><sup>190</sup></a> while bars and pubs erect party tents, the largest of which draws up to 20,000 people per day.<a href="#fn191" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref191"><sup>191</sup></a> Paul Vickers, who owns several establishments in the city, estimates that he makes up to 20 percent of his annual revenue during the ten days of Stampede alone.<a href="#fn192" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref192"><sup>192</sup></a> Some parties have become known for heavy drinking and relaxed morals,<a href="#fn193" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref193"><sup>193</sup></a> so much so that one hotel's satirical ad promising to safely store a patron's wedding ring during Stampede was widely viewed as a legitimate offer.<a href="#fn194" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref194"><sup>194</sup></a> The parties are not without consequences, as lawyers have noted a significant increase in divorce filings in the weeks following the Stampede, primarily on claims of infidelity.<a href="#fn195" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref195"><sup>195</sup></a> Clinics see an increase in people seeking testing and treatment for <a href="sexually_transmitted_disease" title="wikilink">sexually transmitted diseases</a>,<a href="#fn196" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref196"><sup>196</sup></a> and Calgary is said to experience an annual baby boom each April &lt;U+2013&gt; nine months after the event.<a href="#fn197" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref197"><sup>197</sup></a></p>

A merry-go-round is in the foreground to the left, and several skyscrapers stand in the background." /> The Stampede has become inexorably linked to the city's identity. Calgary has long been called the &quot;Stampede City&quot;,<a href="#fn198" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref198"><sup>198</sup></a> and carries the informal nickname of &quot;Cowtown&quot;.<a href="#fn199" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref199"><sup>199</sup></a> The event's iconic status offers Calgary global publicity and plays a significant role in defining the city's image.<a href="#fn200" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref200"><sup>200</sup></a> Calgary's <a href="Canadian_Football_League" title="wikilink">Canadian Football League</a> team has been called the <a href="Calgary_Stampeders" title="wikilink">Stampeders</a> since 1945, and it is a name shared by other teams in various sports throughout the city's history, including the <a href="Calgary_Stampeders_(ice_hockey)" title="wikilink">Stampeders hockey team</a> that operated in the years following World War II.<a href="#fn201" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref201"><sup>201</sup></a></p>
<p>The Stampede has strong polling support within the province. A 2006 <a href="Ipsos-Reid" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ipsos-Reid</a> poll found that 86 percent of Albertans felt that it raised the civic quality of life and considered it one of the region's most important cultural events. Nearly three in four stated they look forward to the annual event.<a href="#fn202" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref202"><sup>202</sup></a> However, critics argue that the themes promoted by the Stampede and within the city are an <a href="Tradition#Invention_of_tradition" title="wikilink">invented tradition</a>. They suggest that it is not a reflection of Alberta's frontier history, but represents a mythical impression of western cowboy culture created by 19th-century wild west shows and exploited for profit.<a href="#fn203" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref203"><sup>203</sup></a><a href="#fn204" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref204"><sup>204</sup></a></p>
<p>Part of the event's success can be attributed to the close relationship the Stampede has often shared with both the civic government and community leaders. Mayors of Calgary and city aldermen have sat on the Stampede Board of Governors at the same time they occupied public office, and the Stampede's ability to convince the city's wealthy and influential citizens to volunteer their time has allowed the organization to gain a high profile within the city.<a href="#fn205" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref205"><sup>205</sup></a> The Stampede operates on city-owned land, pays no property tax on its lease, and typically faces little to no political interference from City Hall.<a href="#fn206" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref206"><sup>206</sup></a> It operates as a non-profit entity with all income reinvested into the park. All improvements to the park would revert to city control if the lease were allowed to expire.<a href="#fn207" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref207"><sup>207</sup></a></p>
<p>Likewise, the Stampede has support from the media,<a href="#fn208" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref208"><sup>208</sup></a> which has been accused of providing an inordinate amount of positive coverage to the event while trivializing negative aspects.<a href="#fn209" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref209"><sup>209</sup></a> The local media faced national scrutiny in 2009 when both major newspapers refused to run anti-rodeo ads sponsored by the Vancouver Humane Society.<a href="#fn210" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref210"><sup>210</sup></a> While the <em><a href="Calgary_Herald" title="wikilink">Calgary Herald</a></em> simply refused to run the ad, the <em><a href="Calgary_Sun" title="wikilink">Calgary Sun</a></em> defended its position in an editorial. The <em>Sun</em> refuted charges it was kowtowing to the Stampede and justified its refusal by claiming &quot;we are Calgarians and allowing a group of outsiders to come in and insult a proud Calgary tradition seemed just plain wrong.&quot;<a href="#fn211" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref211"><sup>211</sup></a> The <em>Herald</em> reversed its decision a year later, running a full-page ad sponsored by the Vancouver Humane Society.<a href="#fn212" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref212"><sup>212</sup></a></p>

<p>Stampede officials estimated in 2009 that the city of Calgary had a gross economic impact of $172.4 million from the ten-day event alone, with a wider provincial total of $226.7 million.<a href="#fn218" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref218"><sup>218</sup></a> In terms of economic impact, the Stampede is the highest grossing festival in Canada, ahead of Ottawa's <a href="Winterlude" class="uri" title="wikilink">Winterlude</a>, the <a href="Canadian_National_Exhibition" title="wikilink">Canadian National Exhibition</a> in Toronto, and the <a href="Just_for_Laughs" title="wikilink">Just for Laughs</a> festival in Montreal.<a href="#fn219" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref219"><sup>219</sup></a> Additionally, Stampede officials estimate that for every dollar spent at Stampede Park, tourists spend $2.65 in the rest of the city.<a href="#fn220" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref220"><sup>220</sup></a> A poll conducted in 2011 found that 40 percent of Calgarians who intended to attend the Stampede expected to spend $150&lt;U+2013&gt;$400 over the course of the event, and 7 percent stated that they would spend more than that.<a href="#fn221" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref221"><sup>221</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="promoting-calgary">Promoting Calgary</h3>
<p>Civic leaders have consistently made note of the Stampede's impact on the city. Mayor <a href="Andrew_Davison" title="wikilink">Andrew Davison</a> claimed in 1944 that the event &quot;had done more to advertise Calgary than any single agency,&quot; an opinion that has been echoed by his successors.<a href="#fn222" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref222"><sup>222</sup></a> Stampede officials have made similar claims, arguing that the event is one of Canada's most important tourist attractions.<a href="#fn223" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref223"><sup>223</sup></a> The Canadian Tourism Commission placed the event in its Signature Experiences Collection, one of six such events or locations in Alberta.<a href="#fn224" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref224"><sup>224</sup></a></p>
<p>According to <a href="Ralph_Klein" title="wikilink">Ralph Klein</a>, former mayor of Calgary and premier of Alberta, the Stampede symbolizes the province's spirit.
