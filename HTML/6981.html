They drag him into a van and bring him back to The Queen Victoria, locking him in the living room upstairs, where the windows have been boarded up to stop him from escaping. <a href="Stacey_Slater" title="wikilink">Stacey Branning</a> (<a href="Lacey_Turner" title="wikilink">Lacey Turner</a>) reveals to <a href="Dot_Branning" title="wikilink">Dot Branning</a> (<a href="June_Brown" title="wikilink">June Brown</a>) that her deceased husband <a href="Bradley_Branning" title="wikilink">Bradley</a> (<a href="Charlie_Clements" title="wikilink">Charlie Clements</a>) is not the father of her baby <a href="Lily_Branning" title="wikilink">Lily</a>.</p>
<h3 id="september-2010-1">7 September 2010</h3>
<p>Stacey explains to Dot that Bradley knew he was not Lily's father. Dot informs Bradley's father <a href="Max_Branning" title="wikilink">Max</a> (<a href="Jake_Wood" title="wikilink">Jake Wood</a>) but he tells her he already knows. He wonders why Stacey has been telling people her secrets and wonders if she has ceased taking medication for her <a href="bipolar_disorder" title="wikilink">bipolar disorder</a>. He tells her that she needs to keep the truth about the baby's father and the fact that <a href="Who_Killed_Archie?" title="wikilink">she killed</a> <a href="Archie_Mitchell" title="wikilink">Archie Mitchell</a> (<a href="Larry_Lamb_(actor)" title="wikilink">Larry Lamb</a>) several months previously to herself.

She returns home and tells Pat that she feels guilty, and Pat tells her not to inform Ryan. Ryan and Janine's wedding takes place but she tells him she fears she is not good enough for him but he reassures her and they marry. Stacey attends their wedding reception in The Queen Victoria and leaves Lily in a bedroom upstairs. Stacey is surprised by a photograph of Peggy and Archie, who were married before his death. She hears Phil making noises in the living room and runs downstairs, scared, and tells Peggy that she thinks Archie is alive and locked upstairs. Peggy assures Stacey that Archie is dead, telling her that Bradley killed him, as he was posthumously found guilty of the murder. Stacey then confesses that she was the person who killed Archie.</p>
<h3 id="september-2010-2">9 September 2010</h3>
<p>Peggy demands that Stacey leave the pub and Stacey pleads with her not to call the police for the sake of Lily. Stacey, knowing that Ryan is Lily's father, takes him into the toilets to tell him, but they are interrupted by Pat, who thinks Stacey is trying to seduce Ryan. Stacey is then left on her own. Phil smashes through the door using a crowbar that was left in the room. He starts taking cash and drinking alcohol, and rushes downstairs, interrupting Peggy, who is about to call the police about Stacey. Phil and Peggy argue and he accuses her of loving the pub more than she loves him, and threatens to burn it down, lighting a match. Peggy tells him he does not have the nerve but he throws the match to the alcohol-soaked floor, followed by another, before heading into the cellar. The fire spreads quickly and Peggy tries to alert everyone and get them out, and then there is an explosion. The customers flee the pub and Peggy tries in vain to extinguish the flames, but is forced out by her friends and family. Stacey, unaware of the events, leaves the toilets and heads up the stairs to save her baby. Phil returns from the cellar and smashes open the till for its money, but a wooden beam collapses, trapping him. Unable to get back down the stairs, Stacey heads into the living room but finds the windows boarded up. She uses the crowbar to smash one, and hands Lily over to Ryan who has climbed a ladder. Peggy realises Phil is still inside and returns to the building with Billy, and they drag him out to safety. Ryan goes back up the ladder and carries an unconscious Stacey out. Stacey regains consciousness and sees that Lily is safe, and tells Ryan that Lily is his daughter. Peggy stares at the pub as it is completely destroyed.</p>
<h3 id="september-2010-3">10 September 2010</h3>
<p>The next day, Peggy visits Stacey in hospital and asks her to confess to burning the pub, as a sentence for arson would be less than one for murder, but Stacey refuses. Peggy realises that Stacey needs to look after her daughter so she leaves. She goes into the pub and looks around as she remembers events from her time there. She then tells Billy she wants to take Phil away to make a fresh start and to protect him. Her niece <a href="Ronnie_Mitchell" title="wikilink">Ronnie Mitchell</a> (<a href="Samantha_Womack" title="wikilink">Samantha Womack</a>) tells Peggy she is five months pregnant and asks Peggy not to leave as she is like a mother to her. Peggy tells Ronnie to give her real mother, <a href="Glenda_Mitchell" title="wikilink">Glenda</a> (<a href="Glynis_Barber" title="wikilink">Glynis Barber</a>), another chance. Peggy's daughter <a href="Sam_Mitchell_(EastEnders)" title="wikilink">Sam</a> (<a href="Danniella_Westbrook" title="wikilink">Danniella Westbrook</a>) does not want her to leave as Peggy promised to look after Sam's baby <a href="Richard_Mitchell_(EastEnders)" title="wikilink">Richard</a> for her, however, Peggy says she is old now and the baby needs a strong mother. Peggy gives her jewellery to Sam to sell so she has some money. Peggy speaks to Phil, saying he was right about her making him the way he is and that she can help him get off the drugs. He says she needs him more than he needs her and that she suffocates him. Peggy realises he is right and leaves the room, asking the rest of her family to look after him. She says emotional goodbyes to everyone and Phil says he did not mean what he said earlier. She says he did and she has to leave for his sake. As she leaves the house, he goes after her but she tells him to go back inside. She looks at the pub and walks out of <a href="Walford" class="uri" title="wikilink">Walford</a>.</p>
<h2 id="background">Background</h2>

<p>In October 2009, actress Barbara Windsor's decision to leave <em>EastEnders</em> after sixteen years of portraying the character Peggy Mitchell was announced.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> The show's executive producer, Bryan Kirkwood, said it was a massive honour for him to be responsible for the character's exit, but explained that as she has become the &quot;quintessential matriarch of the show&quot;, they had to get the exit storyline right, which he said would be &quot;both epic and poignant&quot;.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> Windsor gave one year's notice of leaving, giving the production team time to come up with a storyline, and was asked to keep her decision a secret until the announcement was made.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> Kirkwood looked at Windsor's first episode and decided her exit should be about Peggy and her son Phil, as Peggy's arrival came at a time when Phil needed her most, and since then, she had believed that Phil still needed her. Peggy's exit came when she realised his mother was not what Phil needed.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> Windsor did not want to know in advance how her character would leave, but hoped she would not be killed off. She commented: &quot;My exit was beautifully written and I really couldn&lt;U+2019&gt;t have asked for a better send-off for Peggy.&quot;<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<p>In June 2010, it was announced that The Queen Victoria would be destroyed in a fire to tie in with <em>EastEnders</em>{{'}} transition to <a href="high-definition_television" title="wikilink">high definition</a> so the set could be completely refurbished. It was reported that the fire could tie in with the departure of Peggy or one of the several other characters whose departure had previously been announced.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> Director Lee Salisbury said the fire, as well as Peggy's departure, would have a huge effect on several characters, especially the <a href="Mitchell_family" title="wikilink">Mitchell family</a>, of which Peggy is the matriarch.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> Kirkwood said the fire was &quot;one of the most spectacular stunts that <em>EastEnders</em> has ever seen, and it's very exciting.&quot;<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a><a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>

<h3 id="filming">Filming</h3>
<p>All four episodes were directed by Lee Salisbury, who learned three weeks before filming that he would be working on the episodes, and said he was &quot;a bit dumbstruck&quot; to discover he would be directing the fire episodes and Windsor's departure, but that he was proud to do so.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> He said his main aim for the fire was to show the fear, panic and pandemonium that comes when a fire starts and quickly spreads. He wanted the story to be character-led rather than led by the fire, saying that the fire &quot;almost becomes a backdrop&quot;.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> Salisbury said it was hard to make the fire look real because &quot;you can't actually set fire to stuff&quot;.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> As the fire lasted for some time, characters' scenes could be divided up in to small sections. Salisbury commented: &quot;Bryan Kirkwood, the writer [Ashdown] and myself also wanted it to be an episode where things kept happening and the audience would keep thinking, 'Wow, that must have been the explosion' or 'That must have been the stunt'. But more things keep happening and happening, and I think that's what people will find really shocking.&quot;<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> The production team had several production meetings for the weeks' worth of episodes, whereas there is usually just one.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
<p>The episodes took seventeen days to film, where normally crew are given eight days to film a week's worth of episodes.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> Between forty and forty-five members of crew were required for filming the fire episode, including assistant directors, a design department, cameras, lighting, sound, make up, costume, visual effects, fire safety officers and a stunt team consisting of a stunt co-ordinator and stunt doubles.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> Filming was done with four television cameras, a <a href="steadicam" class="uri" title="wikilink">steadicam</a> and a <a href="Camera_dolly" title="wikilink">dolly</a>.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> The exterior fire scenes were filmed first, in five night shoots lasting until 4Â a.m., and the real exterior set was burnt.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a><a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> Safety was the top priority for the fire scenes, and fire safety advisors ensured all cast and crew were protected.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> Stunt doubles wore flame-proof gel on their faces and for the scene where Ryan and Stacey fall from the ladder, several layers of cardboard boxes were stacked on the ground for the stunt doubles to fall onto.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> For filming the final explosion scene, all the actors whose characters were involved were filmed separately for their reactions. The explosion had to be delayed due to a power failure at Elstree Studios, two minutes before the explosion was due to be set off,<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> which also affected a live broadcast of <em><a href="Big_Brother_2010_(UK)" title="wikilink">Big Brother</a></em>.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> The power cut lasted two hours and filming was further delayed due to rain. The explosion was completed in a third <a href="take" class="uri" title="wikilink">take</a>.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> Despite the delay, the scenes were completed on schedule.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> Salisbury noted that the demise of such an iconic set as The Queen Victoria left several cast members in tears.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a></p>
<p>The interior set of The Queen Victoria pub was taken apart and rebuilt exactly to scale<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> on the George Lucas Stage,<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> a fire stage at Elstree Film Studios, for interior scenes, filmed over four days.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> The interior set took seven weeks to build and two weeks to get into the studio.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> Controlled gas pipes were used to shoot jets of flames and a header was specially built to collapse on Phil. Salisbury had to ensure that the fire for the interior scenes matched that of the already-filmed exterior scenes.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> Producers decided to extend the 10 September episode featuring Peggy's departure by ten minutes, meaning it would clash with rival soap opera <em><a href="Coronation_Street" title="wikilink">Coronation Street</a></em>.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="theme-music">Theme music</h3>
<p>Windsor's final episode on 10 September 2010 did not end with the usual <a href="EastEnders_theme_tune" title="wikilink"><em>EastEnders</em> theme tune</a>. Instead the occasionally-used &quot;<a href="Julia&#39;s_Theme" title="wikilink">Julia's Theme</a>&quot;, a piano version of the theme, was reworked specially for the broadcast, and given the name &quot;Peggy's Theme&quot;. The theme was created by the original theme tune composer, <a href="Simon_May" title="wikilink">Simon May</a>, who was reportedly thrilled to write the theme tune for Windsor.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> He added more piano to the theme and gave it a &quot;more melancholy feel&quot;.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> May composed the theme not knowing what would happen on screen, but when Kirkwood brought a rough edit of the episode, May noted that the music fitted perfectly first time, saying it was &quot;remarkable and very moving.&quot;<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> The theme features as the lead track on the album <em><a href="The_Simon_May_Collection" title="wikilink">The Simon May Collection</a></em> and was also released as an EP available to download immediately after the episode.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a><a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> He revealed: &quot;All the actors and crew had made a really special couple of shows. My main purpose was to bring something to the table, and I didn't think it would be a single.

<h3 id="critical-response">Critical response</h3>
<p>The fire and Peggy's exit episodes garnered a mixed reception by critics. Liam Tucker, founder of website Watch With Mothers, compared the fire episode to the film <em><a href="The_Texas_Chain_Saw_Massacre" title="wikilink">The Texas Chain Saw Massacre</a></em> and admired the special effects and performances of the episode, but said that it seemed unlikely that everyone would have escaped safely, especially Stacey and her baby.<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a> Roz Laws from the <em><a href="Sunday_Mercury" title="wikilink">Sunday Mercury</a></em> wondered if the fire episode was inaccurate due to the lack of fire alarms, sprinklers and emergency lighting in the pub, but noted that the episode's use of the song &quot;<a href="Murder_on_the_Dancefloor" title="wikilink">Murder on the Dancefloor</a>&quot;, featuring the line &quot;Gonna burn this god damn house right down&quot;, was &quot;clever&quot;.<a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a> A writer for <em><a href="Heat_(magazine)" title="wikilink">Heat</a></em> said &quot;We knew the Vic fire was coming, but actually seeing it was quite another thing, and knowing that it also marked the end of an era with the departure of  Windsor made it that much more emotional.&quot;<a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a> A reporter for the <em><a href="Nottingham_Evening_Post" title="wikilink">Nottingham Evening Post</a></em> wrote &quot;Never in the history of soap fires, of which there have of course been legion, have so many hilariously overindulgent explosions been captured on camera.&quot;<a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a> <em><a href="The_Mail_on_Sunday" title="wikilink">The Mail on Sunday</a></em> picked the fire episode as the &quot;Soap of the Day&quot;,<a href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a> while <em><a href="The_People" title="wikilink">The People</a></em> deemed the lack of deaths &quot;a wasted opportunity.&quot;<a href="#fn67" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a> Ally Ross wrote in his column in <em><a href="The_Sun_(United_Kingdom)" title="wikilink">The Sun</a></em> that the fire episode was &quot;twenty minutes of shouting&quot;, questioned why one character was seen flouting the <a href="smoking_in_England" title="wikilink">smoking ban</a> and Phil was boarded up behind an inward-opening door, and opined that he was glad to see Peggy leave as she had become &quot;increasingly psychotic&quot; and &quot;vile&quot;.<a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a></p>
