He found the policies of the <a href="Nazism" title="wikilink">Nazis</a> unfavorable, and left soon after the they came to power in <a href="1933" class="uri" title="wikilink">1933</a>.

<p>Following the outbreak of the <a href="Lebanese_Civil_War" title="wikilink">Lebanese Civil War</a>, which raged from <a href="1975" class="uri" title="wikilink">1975</a> to <a href="1990" class="uri" title="wikilink">1990</a>, Malik helped to found the <a href="Front_for_Freedom_and_Man_in_Lebanon" title="wikilink">Front for Freedom and Man in Lebanon</a>, to defend the Christian cause. It was later renamed the <a href="Lebanese_Front" title="wikilink">Lebanese Front</a>. A <a href="Eastern_Orthodox_Church" title="wikilink">Greek Orthodox</a> Christian, he was the only non-<a href="Maronite" class="uri" title="wikilink">Maronite</a> among the Front's top leaders, who included <a href="Kataeb_Party_(Lebanon)" title="wikilink">Phalangist Party</a> founder <a href="Pierre_Gemayel" title="wikilink">Pierre Gemayel</a> and former <a href="List_of_Presidents_of_Lebanon" title="wikilink">President</a> and <a href="National_Liberal_Party_(Lebanon)" title="wikilink">National Liberal Party</a> leader <a href="Camille_Chamoun" title="wikilink">Camille Chamoun</a>.

<p>Malik was also noted as a theologian who successfully reached across confessional lines, appealing to his fellow <a href="Eastern_Orthodox" title="wikilink">Eastern Orthodox</a> Christians, <a href="Roman_Catholicism" title="wikilink">Roman Catholics</a>, and <a href="Evangelical_Christianity" title="wikilink">Evangelicals</a> alike. The author of numerous commentaries on the <a href="Bible" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bible</a> and on the writings of the early <a href="Church_Fathers" title="wikilink">Church Fathers</a>, Malik was one of the few Orthodox theologians of his time to be widely known in Evangelical circles, and the evangelical leader <a href="Bill_Bright" title="wikilink">Bill Bright</a> spoke well of him and quoted him. Partly owing to Malik's ecumenical appeal, as well as to his academic credentials, he served as President of the <a href="World_Council_on_Christian_Education" title="wikilink">World Council on Christian Education</a> from <a href="1967" class="uri" title="wikilink">1967</a> to <a href="1971" class="uri" title="wikilink">1971</a>, and as Vice-President of the <a href="United_Bible_Societies" title="wikilink">United Bible Societies</a> from <a href="1966" class="uri" title="wikilink">1966</a> to <a href="1972" class="uri" title="wikilink">1972</a>.</p>
<p>Malik died of cancer in Beirut on <a href="28_December" title="wikilink">28 December</a> <a href="1987" class="uri" title="wikilink">1987</a>. His son, <a href="Habib_Malik" title="wikilink">Habib Malik</a>, is a prominent academic and human rights activist. He was also survived by his brother, the late Father Ramzi Habib Malik, a prominent Catholic priest who worked tirelessly for the cause of Christian reconciliation with the Jewish people as well as for the belief that the Jewish People are the elder brothers of the Christians.</p>
