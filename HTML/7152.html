<p>Rheta Louise Childe was born November 2, 1866 in <a href="Omaha,_Nebraska" title="wikilink">Omaha, Nebraska</a>. Childe studied for two years at the <a href="University_of_Nebraska" title="wikilink">University of Nebraska</a> before moving in 1890 to <a href="New_York_City" title="wikilink">New York City</a>, where she worked as a journalist.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>

<p>In 1902 Dorr went to work at the <em><a href="New_York_Post" title="wikilink">New York Evening Post</a>,</em> where she wrote investigative features and material on women's issues.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> She made special investigations as a worker in factories, mills, and department stores in order to study the labor conditions for women and children.</p>
<p>Dorr bridled at the unequal treatment afforded women in the workplace. In 1927 she recalled of her time at the <em>Evening Post:</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Although I was a female, I had a man's ability to earn a very good living. I knew that because my services as a reporter and writer were sought by the then most distinguished newspaper in New York. It was a mark of ability to be asked to join the staff, a mark of special ability if you were a woman, because in those days very few women could get a job on a newspaper anywhere. Yet because of my sex I had to accept a salary hardly more than half that of any of my male colleagues. Moreover, I was given to understand that I could never hope for a raise. Women, the managing editor explained to me, were accidents in industry. They were tolerated because they were temporarily needed, but some day the <em>status quo ante</em> (woman's place is in the home) would be restored and the jobs would go back where they belonged, to the men.&quot;<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>She was eventually named the paper's &quot;Women's Editor,&quot; but soon came to understand that she had run afoul of the paper's <a href="glass_ceiling" title="wikilink">glass ceiling</a>; when she asked her managing editor what her future was with the paper, she was told she had none outside of her current position, ostensibly due to her radical political views which were outside those traditionally held by the paper.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="political-activism">Political activism</h3>
<p>Dorr left the <em>Evening Post</em> in the summer of 1906 and traveled in Europe,<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> where she became even more interested in the growing international movement to grant the right to vote to women.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> She continued this activity upon her return to America, leading to the writing of an influential book in 1910, <em>What Eight Million Women Want.</em><a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p>Dorr was briefly a member of the <a href="Socialist_Party_of_America" title="wikilink">Socialist Party of America</a><a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> and lived on the <a href="Lower_East_Side" title="wikilink">Lower East Side</a> of New York City, where she came into contract with the city's immigrant population and became acutely aware of the economic plight of the <a href="working_class" title="wikilink">working class</a>.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> Dorr's political activity included picketing for striking workers in the garment industry and working with the <a href="Women&#39;s_Trade_Union_League" title="wikilink">Women's Trade Union League</a> on behalf of social legislation such as the <a href="minimum_wage" title="wikilink">minimum wage</a>, the <a href="8-hour_day" title="wikilink">8-hour day</a>, and women's right to vote.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> Dorr's political efforts were instrumental on building the coalition of social reformers that forced the first major investigation by the <a href="United_States_Department_of_Labor" title="wikilink">U.S. Bureau of Labor</a> into the conditions faced by female workers.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1914 when Dorr became the first editor of <em>The Suffragist,</em> official organ of the <a href="Congressional_Union_for_Woman_Suffrage" title="wikilink">Congressional Union for Woman Suffrage</a> &lt;U+2014&gt; the organizational forerunner of the <a href="National_Women&#39;s_Party" title="wikilink">National Women's Party</a>.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<p>During <a href="World_War_I" title="wikilink">World War I</a> Dorr worked as a European correspondent for the <em>New York Evening Mail,</em><a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> with her writing syndicated to numerous other papers. In addition to her journalism, Dorr wrote two popular books on the European situation, including an account of the overthrow of the regime of <a href="Nicholas_II_of_Russia" title="wikilink">Tsar Nicholas II</a> entitled <em>Inside the Russian Revolution,</em> published in 1917, and <em>The Soldier's Mother in France,</em> published in 1918.</p>
<p>Dorr returned to <a href="Washington,_DC" title="wikilink">Washington, DC</a> after the end of the war in November 1918 and planned to go on a tour of the United States to conduct research for a series of magazine articles.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> This plan was cut short, however, when in the night of November 18/19, Dorr was hit by a motorcycle and was hospitalized with a broken arm and other serious injuries.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
<p>Dorr became a foreign correspondent with headquarters at <a href="Prague" class="uri" title="wikilink">Prague</a> in 1920.</p>
