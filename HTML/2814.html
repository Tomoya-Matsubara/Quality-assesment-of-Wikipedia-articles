<p>The <a href="Supermarine_Spitfire" title="wikilink">Supermarine Spitfire</a>, the only British fighter to be manufactured before, during and after the <a href="World_War_II" title="wikilink">Second World War</a>, was designed as a short-range fighter capable of defending Britain from bomber attack<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> and achieved legendary status fulfilling this role during the <a href="Battle_of_Britain" title="wikilink">Battle of Britain</a>.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> It was, according to ace <a href="Johnnie_Johnson" title="wikilink">Johnnie Johnson</a>, the best conventional defensive fighter of the war. <a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>As the war continued, however, the fighter evolved into a multi-role aircraft capable of operating in different environments.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> The first of these new roles was that of an unarmed, photo reconnaissance (P.R) aircraft which relied on high speed and high altitude to avoid detection; the Spitfire was a pioneer in this role.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> The first sorties of photo reconnaissance Spitfires took place in November 1939.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p>Post-war the Spitfire was to continue to serve as a front line fighter and in secondary roles for several air forces well into the 1950s.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> The last offensive sorties made by RAF Spitfires were flown by 60 Squadron Mk XVIIIs over <a href="Malaya" class="uri" title="wikilink">Malaya</a> on 1 January 1951. <a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>

<p><img src="SpitI19a.jpg" title="fig:K9795, the 9th production Mk I, with 19 Squadron." alt="K9795, the 9th production Mk I, with 19 Squadron." /> The first <a href="Supermarine_Spitfire_(early_Merlin-powered_variants)" title="wikilink">Spitfire I</a> to enter service with the RAF arrived at <a href="No._XIX_Squadron_RAF" title="wikilink">19 Squadron</a>, <a href="RAF_Duxford" title="wikilink">Duxford</a>, on 4 August 1938, and over the next few weeks aircraft were delivered at the rate of one a week to both 19 and <a href="No._66_Squadron_RAF" title="wikilink">66 Squadrons</a> (also based at Duxford). The next to be equipped with Spitfires was <a href="No._41_Squadron_RAF" title="wikilink">41 Squadron</a> at <a href="RAF_Catterick" title="wikilink">Catterick</a>, followed by a succession of squadrons stationed at <a href="RAF_Hornchurch" title="wikilink">Hornchurch</a> in <a href="Essex" class="uri" title="wikilink">Essex</a>.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> The public's first sight of the Spitfire in RAF colours was on <a href="Empire_Air_Day" title="wikilink">Empire Air Day</a>, 20 May 1939 during a display at Duxford in which the pilot &quot;belly-landed&quot; his aircraft, having forgotten to lower his undercarriage. He was fined &lt;U+00A3&gt;5 by the <a href="Air_Ministry" title="wikilink">Air Ministry</a>. By the outbreak of the Second World War, there were 306 Spitfires in service with the RAF, with another 71 in reserve and a further 2,000 on order. A total of 36 had been written off in accidents.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<p>On 6 September 1939, in an incident known as the <a href="Battle_of_Barking_Creek" title="wikilink">Battle of Barking Creek</a>, a pair of <a href="Hawker_Hurricane" title="wikilink">Hawker Hurricanes</a> from <a href="No._56_Squadron_RAF" title="wikilink">56 Squadron</a> were shot down by Spitfires of <a href="No._74_Squadron_RAF" title="wikilink">74 Squadron</a> in a <a href="Friendly_fire" title="wikilink">friendly-fire</a> incident over the river <a href="Medway" class="uri" title="wikilink">Medway</a>, in <a href="Kent" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kent</a>. One of the Hurricane pilots, <a href="pilot_officer" title="wikilink">P/O</a> Montague Leslie Hulton-Harrop, was the first British pilot fatality of the Second World War. As a result the production of <a href="Identification_Friend_or_Foe" title="wikilink">IFF</a> equipment for RAF aircraft became a high priority.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<p>On 16 October 1939 the Spitfire first saw action when three aircraft each from <a href="No._602_Squadron_RAF" title="wikilink">602</a> and <a href="No._603_Squadron_RAF" title="wikilink">603 Squadrons</a> intercepted, over <a href="Rosyth" class="uri" title="wikilink">Rosyth</a>, nine <a href="Junkers_Ju_88" title="wikilink">Junkers Ju 88s</a> of 1/KG30 led by <em>Hauptmann</em> Helmuth Pohle that had managed a crack at the cruisers HMS <em>Southampton</em> and HMS <em>Edimburgh</em> <a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> of <a href="Royal_Navy" title="wikilink">Royal Navy</a> in the <a href="Firth_of_Forth" title="wikilink">Firth of Forth</a>.

<p>On 23 May 1940 Spitfires of <a href="No._54_Squadron_RAF" title="wikilink">54 Squadron</a> were the first to shoot down <a href="Messerschmitt_Bf_109" title="wikilink">Bf 109s</a>, over <a href="Calais_Marck" title="wikilink">Calais Marck</a> airfield, on the coast of northern France<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a>; the first of these is usually credited to either <a href="Flying_Officer" title="wikilink">Flying Officer</a> <a href="Alan_Christopher_Deere" title="wikilink">Alan Deere</a> who shot down two (according to other sources, one destroyed plus one probable<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a>), or Flg. Off. &quot;Johnny&quot; Allen who shot down one.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
<p>During this period 67 Spitfires were lost over France, most of them in the attempt to prevent the <em>Luftwaffe</em> from bombing the evacuation beaches at Dunkirk. While the Spitfires of <a href="RAF_Fighter_Command" title="wikilink">Fighter Command</a> continued to be based in Britain, at the insistence of <a href="Air_Vice_Marshal" title="wikilink">Air Vice Marshal</a> <a href="Hugh_Dowding,_1st_Baron_Dowding" title="wikilink">Hugh Dowding</a>, from late 1939 there were early photo-reconnaissance Spitfires of &quot;No 2 Camouflage Unit&quot; operating from <a href="Seclin" class="uri" title="wikilink">Seclin</a> in France, gathering photo-intelligence of German defences and cities. <a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> Throughout the Second World War, photo-reconnaissance Spitfires would keep up a constant flow of photographic intelligence, in a role far removed from that of short-range interceptor fighter.</p>

<p>As a result <a href="Supermarine_Spitfire_(early_Merlin_powered_variants)" title="wikilink">Spitfire Is, IIs, VAs and VBs</a> were fitted with a powerful, retractable landing-light in each wing. Dorsal (just behind the aerial mast) and ventral (orange, under the wing centre section) identification lights could be operated in <a href="Morse_code" title="wikilink">Morse code</a> by the pilot using a small morse key in the cockpit. In an attempt to shield the pilot's eyes from the bright exhaust flames many Spitfires were also fitted with rectangular light-alloy &quot;blinkers&quot; secured to light-alloy brackets fixed to the sides of the fuel-tank housing: these could be easily removed.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>
<p>The most successful night interceptions took place on the night of 18/19 June 1940 when <a href="Flight_Lieutenant" title="wikilink">Flt.

<p>Although Spitfires continued to be used on night patrols, the Luftwaffe bombers learned to fly well above the altitudes at which they could be effectively picked up by searchlights and the Spitfires were never to achieve the same success.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a></p>

<p>The Battle of Britain (which officially started on 10 July 1940 and ended 31 October)<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> was the first major test of both the Spitfire and of Fighter Command. During the <a href="Luftwaffe" class="uri" title="wikilink">Luftwaffe</a>'s onslaught important lessons were learned about the Spitfire's capabilities and its drawbacks.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a></p>
<p>The combat performance of the Spitfire was frequently compared with that of the Hawker Hurricane, which was used in greater numbers during the critical stages of 1940. The Hurricane had thick wings and their structure was such that four guns were easily installed, grouped closely together, with 334 rounds per gun. Installing the guns in the Spitfire was more complicated, because it had a thinner wing and the armament and ammunition boxes had to be widely spaced. That dispersion of firepower was a weakness and at least in this respect the Hurricane - which was also a more stable gunnery platform - was better than the Spitfire.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> The pilots who fought over France had learned to get the armourers back at base to &quot;harmonise&quot; the Browning machine guns, so that their combined fire met their target in one concentrated burst 250 yards ahead of the wings, instead of the official 400 yards.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a></p>
<p>Whenever possible, the RAF tactic during the Battle of Britain was to use Hurricane squadrons to attack the bombers and Spitfires to counter German escort fighters. In total Hurricanes shot down more Luftwaffe aircraft of all types than the Spitfire, mainly due to the higher proportion of Hurricanes in the air. Seven out of every ten German aircraft destroyed during the Battle of Britain were shot down by Hurricane pilots. Losses were also higher among the more numerous Hurricane units. Post-war analysis showed that the Spitfire's &quot;kill ratio&quot; was marginally better than the Hurricane's.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> <img src="Spitfire_MKI_Wiki.jpg" title="fig:Spitfire Mk I, 66 Squadron, P/O Crelin Bodie.

On 7 September 1940 &quot;Bogle&quot; Bodie was forced to belly-land X4321 following combat with Bf 109Es." /></p>
<p>The majority of Mk Is and Mk IIs were armed with eight .303 Browning machine guns. Throughout the battle Luftwaffe aircraft often returned to base with .303 bullet holes, but no critical damage as they had received armour plating in critical areas and self-sealing fuel tanks became common in bombers.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> Several Mark Is of 19 Squadron were fitted with two 20-mm <a href="Hispano-Suiza_HS.404" title="wikilink">Hispano-Suiza cannon</a> in 1940. This early Hispano installation proved to be unreliable, with the cannon frequently firing just a few rounds or failing to fire at all. After numerous complaints from the pilots of 19 Squadron the cannon armed Spitfires were replaced by conventionally-armed aircraft in September 1940.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> Supermarine and <a href="Birmingham_Small_Arms_Company" title="wikilink">BSA</a>, who manufactured the Hispano under licence, continued work on a reliable cannon installation, with a number of Mk Is armed with two cannon and four .303 machine-guns entering operations by late 1940: this version was referred to as the Mk IB, the machine-gun-armed Spitfires were retrospectively called the Mk IA. <a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a></p>
<p>Although the Merlin III engine of Spitfire Is had a power rating of 1,030 hp (768 kW), supplies of 100 <a href="Octane_rating" title="wikilink">octane</a> fuel from the United States started reaching Britain in early 1940.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a><a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> This meant that an &quot;<a href="supercharger" title="wikilink">emergency boost</a>&quot; of +12 pounds per square inch was available for five minutes, with pilots able to call on 1,310 hp (977 kW) at 3,000 rpm at 9,000 feet (2,743 m).<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> This boosted the maximum speed by  at sea level and  at  and improved the climbing performance between sea level and full throttle height.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a><a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> The extra boost wasn't damaging as long as the limitations set forth in the pilot's notes were followed. As a precaution, however, if the pilot had resorted to emergency boost, he had to report this on landing and it had to be noted in the engine log book.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> The extra boost was also available for the Merlin XII fitted to the Spitfire II.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a></p>
<p>Between 1 August 1940 and 31 October, Spitfire losses amounted to 208 lost in combat, seven destroyed on the ground, and 42 in flying accidents.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> <img src="Bf109E_3Seiten_neu.jpg" title="fig:Three-view drawing of the Bf 109E-3 with the early style of cockpit canopy." alt="Three-view drawing of the Bf 109E-3 with the early style of cockpit canopy." /></p>
<h3 id="the-bf-109-and-combat-tactics">The Bf 109 and combat tactics</h3>
<p>At the time, the Luftwaffe's main single-engine, single-seat fighter was the <a href="Messerschmitt_Bf_109" title="wikilink">Messerschmitt Bf 109</a>. Some advantages helped the Spitfires win <a href="dogfight" title="wikilink">dogfights</a>, most notably manoeuvrability: the Spitfire had a higher rate of turn and a smaller turning circle than the Messerschmitt. The minimum radius of turn was estimated in Britain as 696 ft at 133 mph for the Spitfire I and 885 ft at 129 mph for the Bf 109E. The comparable turn rates for a Spitfire and <a href="Bayerische_Flugzeugwerke" title="wikilink">Bf</a> 109 were 33 and 26 degrees per second, respectively. <a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a><a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> There are several accounts of Bf 109 pilots being able to out-turn Spitfires, mainly through inexperienced pilots who did not turn as tightly as was possible through fear of getting into a high-speed stall.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a></p>
<p>Both the Spitfire and Hurricane could keep up with the Bf 109 in a dive although the 109 was able to escape by pulling out of the dive and climbing at a low airspeed and a steep angle because its <a href="Handley_Page" title="wikilink">Handley Page</a> wing slats allowed it to fly extremely well close to the stall. Spitfires, especially those equipped with constant speed propellers, could keep on the tail of the Bf 109 in a climb, although the steeper climb angle of the German fighter meant that the gunsight of the Spitfire could not get a good sighting line.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> The Bf 109, with its direct fuel injected engine, accelerated better at all heights while the Spitfire's superior roll rate at lower speeds progressively diminished at speeds exceeding 350 mph.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> The maximum speed of a Spitfire I on 87 Octane fuel and equipped with a constant speed propeller in March 1940 was  at ; this aircraft lacked some of the armour plating (it had an armoured windshield, but not the 33 kg armoured seat)<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> and had no <a href="IFF" class="uri" title="wikilink">IFF</a> equipment later fitted to Battle of Britain era Spitfires.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a> The higher engine power using 100 octane fuel at low altitudes would have just about cancelled out the extra weight of the armour and IFF set in the climb.<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> The Bf 109, according to the handbook data, had a top speed of  at .<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a><a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a> The Bf 109, with its direct fuel injected engine, accelerated better at all heights while the Spitfire's superior roll rate at lower speeds progressively diminished at speeds exceeding 350 mph.<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a>. The initial climb rate of the <a href="Bayerische_Flugzeugwerke" title="wikilink">Bayerische Flugzeugwerke</a> 109 was 3,100 feet per minute (2,820 for the Spitfire<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a>). It should be noted that the speeds of individual aircraft vary. In his <em>The First and the Last</em> <a href="Adolf_Galland" title="wikilink">Adolf Galland</a> wrote German pilots were convinced that the 109 was faster at most altitudes flown in 1940. <a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a></p>
<p>In terms of ammunition supply the all-machine gun equipped Bf 109E-1 could fire for a much longer time than the British fighters. The latter carried 300 rounds for each of their eight machine guns, enough for 16 seconds of fire. The two rifle-caliber MG 17 of the Messerschmitt had a supply of 1,000 rounds each, good for about a minute of fire.<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a> The wing guns had a supply of 500 rpg, good for about 30 seconds. The 60 rounds per gun available for the 20 mm MG/FF cannons on the E-3 and E-4 meant that these weapons were emptied after some seven seconds of fire,<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a><a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a> but the cannons could far out range the machine guns of the British fighters<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a> and as few as three cannons shell hits on an enemy fighter could mean that the aircraft had to be written off as scrap.<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a> The <a href="MG_FF_cannon" title="wikilink">MG/FF</a> was a relatively lightweight and compact cannon, but had a rate of fire and muzzle velocity far inferior to the HS 404 and MG151/20, giving it a relatively short range. Its best advantage was the potency of its HE ammunition, especially the newer <em>Minengeschoss</em> shell with its thinner walls and greater quantity of explosive.</p>
<p>Some German pilots who had the opportunity to fly captured Spitfires preferred the Bf 109. Four Spitfires were captured before or during the battle. &quot;In <a href="Jever" class="uri" title="wikilink">Jever</a> I could try one of them&quot;, wrote <em>Oberleutnant</em> Hans Schmoller-Haldy from Geschwader 54. &quot;My first impression was that the British fighter had a fine engine. The Bf's was very noisy, instead. The Spitfire was more manoeuvrable and easier in landing. The 109 did not forgive you the minimum lack of attention. But I had the impression that the Messerschmitt was faster, mostly in dive. And I thought that we had a better visibility as in the Spitfire you were much more behind, just over the wings. With my experience I would have never exchanged my Bf 109 with the Spitfire.&quot; <a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a></p>
<p>Overall the aircraft were closely matched in performance and the outcome of combat was largely decided by tactics, position and the skill of the opposing pilots.<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a></p>
<p><img src="Bf109_2_Farbe.jpg" title="fig:A Bf 109E-3 of III./JG 26." alt="A Bf 109E-3 of III./JG 26." /> One advantage enjoyed by the German <em>Jagdgeschwadern</em> was the use of better tactics. In the late 1930s Fighter Command were not expecting to be facing single-engine fighters over Britain, only bombers. With this in mind a series of &quot;Fighting Area Tactics&quot; were formulated, involving manoeuvres designed to concentrate a squadron's firepower to bring down bombers: with no apparent prospect of escorting fighters to worry about, RAF fighter pilots flew in tight, vee-shaped sections of three.<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a> The pilots were forced to concentrate on watching each other, rather than being free to keep a lookout for enemy aircraft. &quot;Fighting Area Tactics&quot; also stipulated that RAF fighter pilots were to open fire at long-range, usually 300 to 400 yards (274 to 365 m), and then break off without closing in.The usual practice was to bore-sight their guns on the ground to create a shotgun pattern at this distance.<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a></p>
<p>Luftwaffe fighter pilots, flying combat formations perfected in <a href="Spanish_Civil_War" title="wikilink">Spanish Civil War</a>, and utilizing proved principles of the First World War, entered the Second using the basic unit of a pair (<em><a href="Rotte" class="uri" title="wikilink">Rotte</a></em>) widely spaced fighters. They were separated by about two hundred yards. <a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a> The leader was followed to starboard and to the rear by his wingman, who was trained to stay with his leader at all times. While the leader was free to search for enemy aircraft, and could cover his wingman's blind spots, his wingman was able to concentrate on searching the airspace in the leader's blind spots, behind and below. Two of these sections were usually teamed up into a <em>Schwarm</em>, where all of the pilots could watch what was happening around them. Because the four 109s were spread out four-abreast the <em>Schwarm</em> was hard to spot, unlike the RAF vee formation, and all of the 109s were able to attack and defend, or retreat in pairs,<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a> whereas the RAF formations were often split up into individual aircraft which were then extremely vulnerable. The loose <em>Schwarm</em>, because of the reduced risk of collision between aircraft, were also able to climb faster and higher than the tightly grouped RAF fighters, which is one of the reasons why RAF formations often found themselves being &quot;bounced&quot; from above. When the Luftwaffe fighter units flew as a <em><a href="Staffel" class="uri" title="wikilink">Staffel</a></em> the three <em>Schwarme</em> were staggered in height and weaved back and forth as a means of mutual search and protection. <a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a> With the Germans able to base their 109s in the <a href="Pas_de_Calais" title="wikilink">Pas de Calais</a>, close to the <a href="English_Channel" title="wikilink">English Channel</a> the &quot;Fighting Area Tactics&quot; became obsolete. Many of the RAF fighter squadrons which had not been engaged in combat over Dunkirk were slow to adapt to the fact that they would be encountering the potent German fighter over Britain. Some RAF units adopted &quot;weavers&quot;, a single aircraft which flew a pattern behind the main squadron, which still flew in vees. The weavers were usually the first to be picked off in a &quot;bounce&quot; by the German fighters: more often than not the rest of the squadron did not even know they were under attack.RAF squadrons that did not learn from the Luftwaffe and adopt similar tactics suffered heavy casualties during the Battle.<a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a> Leaders like <a href="Adolph_Malan" title="wikilink">&quot;Sailor&quot; Malan</a> were instrumental in devising better tactics for the RAF fighters.<a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a> It is no coincidence that some of the most successful RAF pilots were the Polish pilots who had been trained pre-war by their air force to fly in loose formations and open fire from close-range.<a href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a></p>
<p>The biggest disadvantage faced by Bf 109 pilots was that, without the benefit of long-range drop tanks (which were introduced in very limited numbers in the late stages of the Battle), the 109s had an endurance of just over an hour. Once over Britain the 109 pilots had to keep an eye on a red &quot;low fuel&quot; light on the instrument panel: once this was illuminated they were forced to turn back and head for France. With the prospect of two long over-water flights, and knowing that their range was substantially reduced when escorting bombers or in the event of combat, the <em>Jagdflieger</em> coined the term <em>Kanalkrankheit</em> or &quot;Channel sickness&quot;.<a href="#fn67" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="the-bf-110-and-the-bombers">The Bf 110 and the bombers</h3>
<p><img src="Me_110C-4_RAF_NAN15Jun43.jpg" title="fig:A captured Bf 110 C-4." alt="A captured Bf 110 C-4." /> Another regularly encountered German fighter, the <a href="Messerschmitt_Bf_110" title="wikilink">Messerschmitt Bf 110</a>, was a larger, two-seat, twin-engined fighter which was designed as a long range &quot;Destroyer&quot; (<em>Zerst&lt;U+00F6&gt;rer</em>). Although reasonably fast (Bf 110C about 340 mph [547 km/h]) and possessing a respectable combat radius as well as carrying a heavy armament of two 20 mm <a href="MG_FF_cannon" title="wikilink">MG FF/M</a> cannon and four 7.92 mm <a href="MG_17_machine_gun" title="wikilink">MG 17s</a> concentrated in the forward fuselage, along with a single 7.92 mm <a href="MG_15_machine_gun" title="wikilink">MG 15</a> mounted for rear defence in the rear cockpit, the 110 was only slightly more manoeuvrable than the bombers they were meant to escort. Against modern fighters like the Spitfire and Hurricane the <em>Zerst&lt;U+00F6&gt;rergruppen</em> (roughly &quot;Destroyer Groups&quot;) suffered heavy casualties and, after 18 August, fewer of them were encountered over Britain because the rate of attrition was outpacing production.<a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a></p>
<p>Of the four types of Luftwaffe bombers, the <a href="Dornier_Do_17" title="wikilink">Dornier Do 17</a>, <a href="Heinkel_He_111" title="wikilink">Heinkel He 111</a>, <a href="Junkers_Ju_87" title="wikilink">Junkers Ju 87</a> and <a href="Junkers_Ju_88" title="wikilink">Junkers Ju 88</a>, the Ju 88 was considered to be the most difficult to shoot down. As a bomber it was relatively manoeuvrable and, especially at low altitudes with no bomb load, it was fast enough to ensure that a Spitfire caught in a tail-chase would be hard pressed to catch up. The He 111 was nearly 100 mph slower than the Spitfire and didn't present much of a challenge to catch, although the heavy armour, self-sealing fuel tanks and progressively uprated defensive armament meant that it was still a challenge to shoot down. The Do 17 was also easy to catch but, with its radial engines with no vulnerable cooling systems and self-sealing fuel tanks, it was capable of taking an amazing amount of punishment. The Ju 87 <em>Stuka</em> dive bomber was badly outclassed in all respects and, after taking some savage beatings, the <em>Sturzkampfgeschwader</em> were withdrawn from the Battle.<a href="#fn69" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref69"><sup>69</sup></a></p>
<p>When being attacked by British fighters the standard warning of &quot;Achtung, Indianer!&quot; (Look Out, Red Indians!&quot;) often became &quot;Achtung! Spitfire&quot;, even if the aircraft were Hurricanes.<a href="#fn70" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a> This was later called the &quot;Spitfire complex.&quot;</p>

<p>With the change to offensive tactics the Spitfire, Hurricane and new <a href="Westland_Whirlwind_(fixed_wing)" title="wikilink">Westland Whirlwind</a> units found themselves facing the same disadvantages over France as the 109 units had faced over Britain. The limited combat radius of the RAF fighters meant that the Luftwaffe could engage in combat, or break off on their own terms, knowing that they were over friendly territory and with plenty of airfields at which they could land to rearm and refuel. The RAF fighters were the ones who were now having to face the prospect of two long over-water passages, returning in many cases with combat damage.</p>
<p>By late 1940 Luftwaffe fighter units were being re-equipped with the formidable new <a href="Messerschmitt_Bf_109" title="wikilink">Bf 109F-1 and F-2</a>, considered by many Luftwaffe pilots to be the best of the many variants of this fighter. The F-1s and F-2s easily outperformed the Spitfire Mk Is and IIs and it closely matched that of the Mk Vs which were just about to enter service. In the hands of pilots like <a href="Adolf_Galland" title="wikilink">Adolf Galland</a> it was a daunting proposition to be facing this aircraft over France.<a href="#fn73" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref73"><sup>73</sup></a> On 10 July 1941, a 109 F-2 flown by <a href="Hauptmann" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hauptmann</a> Rolf Pingel of I./JG 26. followed a <a href="Short_Stirling" title="wikilink">Short Stirling</a> heavy bomber he had intercepted across the Channel. Return fire from the Stirling hit his fighter's cooling system, forcing him to &quot;crash-land&quot; in a field near <a href="Dover" class="uri" title="wikilink">Dover</a>. The 109 was repaired and tested at <a href="Air_Fighting_Development_Unit" title="wikilink">Air Fighting Development Unit</a> (AFDU) until it crashed, killing the pilot, on 20 October 1941. The results of these tests helped in the development of tactics to counter the new fighter.<a href="#fn74" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref74"><sup>74</sup></a><a href="#fn75" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref75"><sup>75</sup></a></p>
<p>Compared with the massive bomber raids mounted by the Luftwaffe in 1939 and 1940 the <a href="RAF_Bomber_Command" title="wikilink">RAF Bomber Command</a> Circus operations were very small and rarely damaging. Circuses consisted of one or at most two squadrons of <a href="Bristol_Blenheim" title="wikilink">Bristol Blenheims</a> (later Short Stirlings were also used) which were usually escorted by large, conspicuous &quot;Beehives&quot; of five or more fighter squadrons. The primary intent was to lure the German fighters into combat rather than causing damage by bombing.<a href="#fn76" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref76"><sup>76</sup></a> The <em>Luftwaffe</em>, with the assistance of radar, could afford to oppose these &quot;Circuses&quot; with relatively small numbers of fighters, which could pick and choose whether or not to take on the escorting fighters.<a href="#fn77" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref77"><sup>77</sup></a> <a href="Douglas_Bader" title="wikilink">Douglas Bader</a>, flying a <a href="Supermarine_Spitfire_(early_Merlin_powered_variants)" title="wikilink">Mk Va</a>, was shot down and captured on 9 August 1941 while leading the <a href="RAF_Tangmere" title="wikilink">Tangmere Wing</a> during a &quot;Circus&quot; raid.<a href="#fn78" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref78"><sup>78</sup></a></p>
<p>Another type of operation flown by Fighter Command was the &quot;Rhubarb&quot;: a low-level ground-attack mission by small numbers of fighters, usually under low cloud. Against aircraft flying these missions the <a href="2_cm_FlaK_30" title="wikilink">20 mm</a> and <a href="3.7_cm_FlaK_43" title="wikilink">37 mm</a> <a href="Anti-aircraft_warfare" title="wikilink">flak</a> guns were the most successful opponents. Another well-known Wing Commander, <a href="Robert_Stanford_Tuck" title="wikilink">&quot;Bob&quot; Tuck</a>, was shot down by a <a href="2_cm_FlaK_30" title="wikilink">multi-barrel, 20 mm Flakvierling 38</a> position and captured by German troops on 28 January 1942 while flying a &quot;Rhubarb&quot;. Many other Spitfires were shot down by German fighters.<a href="#fn79" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref79"><sup>79</sup></a><a href="#fn80" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref80"><sup>80</sup></a></p>
<p>By mid-1941, with <a href="Operation_Barbarossa" title="wikilink">Operation Barbarossa</a> soon to be under way, the only Luftwaffe fighter units left to guard against the RAF were <a href="Jagdgeschwader_2" title="wikilink">JG 2</a> and <a href="Jagdgeschwader_26" title="wikilink">JG 26</a>.These two units, manned for the most part with experienced and aggressive pilots, were fully capable of mounting a highly successful defence, particularly when they started re-equipping with the <a href="Focke-Wulf_Fw_190" title="wikilink">Focke-Wulf Fw 190</a></p>
<h3 id="the-fw-190-challenge">The Fw 190 Challenge</h3>
<p>The introduction of the Fw 190 in late 1941 along the Channel front came as a complete surprise to Fighter Command. At first it was assumed that the new radial-engined fighters were <a href="P-36_Hawk" title="wikilink">Curtiss 75-C1s</a> which had been captured from the French. It soon became clear that the new aircraft easily outperformed the Spitfire V and appeared to be more heavily armed.<a href="#fn81" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref81"><sup>81</sup></a> Very little was known about this fighter until 23 June 1942 when <a href="Oberleutnant" class="uri" title="wikilink">Oberleutnant</a> Armin Faber of JG 2 landed his FW 190A-3 at <a href="RAF_Pembrey" title="wikilink">RAF Pembrey</a> by mistake. In comparison tests the new German fighter proved superior to the then-current <a href="Supermarine_Spitfire_(early_Merlin_powered_variants)" title="wikilink">Mk Vb</a> in all aspects except turning radius.<a href="#fn82" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref82"><sup>82</sup></a></p>
<p>The Fw 190 was at least 25 to 30 mph faster than the Spitfire V, and could climb and accelerate to combat speeds more quickly.<a href="#fn83" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref83"><sup>83</sup></a> Spitfire pilots who flew over enemy territory using the standard technique of flying at low rpm and high boost pressures to economise on fuel often found themselves in trouble when intercepted by Fw 190s. If &quot;bounced&quot; while cruising at low speeds it could take a Spitfire up to two minutes to accelerate to top speed.<a href="#fn84" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref84"><sup>84</sup></a> The only way it was thought that a Spitfire could evade attack was to cruise at high speed and go into a shallow dive with the throttle open. Provided the Fw 190 was seen in time, it could be forced into a long stern chase.<a href="#fn85" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref85"><sup>85</sup></a> As a result of the high number of casualties being inflicted on Spitfires the <em>Air Tactics Department</em> (A.T.D) issued a guide on the optimum engine settings to use while flying over enemy territory: in part it read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>2. At the present stage of the war, the enemy in France is equipped with the Fw 190, a fighter with an excellent rate of climb and good acceleration. To defeat this aircraft and to avoid casualties on our side, our aircraft must fly as fast as possible whenever they are in the combat zone.<a href="#fn86" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref86"><sup>86</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>&quot;The Focke Wulf 190 certainly gave the British a shock&quot;, wrote Douglas Bader in his autobiography <em>Fight for the sky</em>; &quot;it out-climbed and out-dived the Spitfire. Now for the first time the Germans were out-flying our pilots.&quot; They were also out-gunning them. For the best part of the year, and until the arrival of the Spitfire Mk IX {the Fw 190] commanded the skies.<a href="#fn87" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref87"><sup>87</sup></a></p>

This Spitfire has the &quot;cropped&quot; Merlin 45 series engine and the &quot;clipped&quot; wings." /> From late 1942, in an attempt to achieve some degree of parity with the Fw 190, some squadrons received the L.F Mark VB. This version had reduced <a href="diameter" class="uri" title="wikilink">diameter</a> <a href="supercharger" class="uri" title="wikilink">supercharger</a> <a href="impeller" class="uri" title="wikilink">impeller</a> blades on the Merlin for optimum performance at lower altitudes and the wing-tips were removed and replaced by short fairings to improve their rate of roll.<a href="#fn88" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref88"><sup>88</sup></a> These aircraft were unofficially known by their pilots as &quot;clipped, clapped and cropped Spits,&quot; referring to the fact that many of these Spitfires, thus modified, had seen better days.<a href="#fn89" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref89"><sup>89</sup></a></p>
<p>The flight performance of an early <a href="Supermarine_Spitfire_(late_Merlin_powered_variants)" title="wikilink">Mk IX</a>, which was flown against the Focke-Wulf in July 1942, was found to be closely comparable.<a href="#fn90" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref90"><sup>90</sup></a> Still, at altitudes of 18-20,000 ft and at 3,000 ft and below, the AFDU noted the Fw 190 was &quot;a little faster&quot;.<a href="#fn91" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref91"><sup>91</sup></a> Once again the Mk IX had a superior turning radius although it could be out-dived and out-rolled by the German fighter. The Spitfire being tested was hampered through being fitted with an old float-type carburettor: the great majority of Mk IXs were fitted with negative-G carburettors.<a href="#fn92" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref92"><sup>92</sup></a> These results contributed to the further development of the <a href="Rolls-Royce_Merlin" title="wikilink">Rolls-Royce Merlin</a> 61 series engine into versions optimised for High (70 series) Medium (63) and Low (66) altitude performance: this led to the use of the prefixes H.F, F, and L.F which were later applied to the Mks VII through to IX, depending on which version of the engine was installed, eg, <a href="Supermarine_Spitfire_(late_Merlin_powered_variants)" title="wikilink">L.F Mk. IX</a>.<a href="#fn93" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref93"><sup>93</sup></a></p>
<p>The Spitfire V units continued to take heavy casualties, often inflicting little damage in return, throughout 1941 and well into 1942. Once the Mk IX started arriving in sufficient numbers this trend started to even out, although the 190s in particular continued to be a serious threat. <a href="#fn94" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref94"><sup>94</sup></a> Hans &quot;Assi&quot; Hahn claimed 53 of his 108 kills against Spitfires and <a href="Josef_Priller" title="wikilink">Josef &quot;Pips&quot; Priller</a> claimed 68 of his 101 victories against the type, making him the highest scoring &quot;Spitfire killer&quot; in the <em>Luftwaffe</em> Most of these victories were against the Mark V.</p>
<p>&quot;Operation <em>Jubilee</em>&quot;, the <a href="Dieppe_Raid" title="wikilink">amphibious raid on Dieppe</a> on 19 August 1942, was supported by 48 Spitfire squadrons and would prove to be a turning point in RAF operations over Europe. While Fighter Command claimed to have inflicted heavy casualties on the Luftwaffe the balance sheet showed the reverse. Allied aircraft losses amounted to 106, including 88 RAF fighters and 18 bombers. Of the fighter losses 29 were from flak, one ran out of fuel, two collided, and one was a victim of friendly fire.<a href="#fn95" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref95"><sup>95</sup></a> Against this, 48 Luftwaffe aircraft were lost.

<p>According to the AFDU, the Bf 109F and Spitfire V were evenly matched in terms of performance. Tests concluded that the outcome of a dogfight would depend on the qualities of the pilot.<a href="#fn102" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref102"><sup>102</sup></a> In October 1941, &quot;Tactical Bulletin No 5&quot; included a report of a test between a Spitfire V and the Bf 109F:</p>

During these missions the Wing would often sweep ahead of the main bomber formation, to catch German fighters on the ground, or as they were still climbing to intercept the American bombers.

The limited combat radius of the Spitfire, however, meant the RAF support operations were limited to the <a href="North_Sea" title="wikilink">North Sea</a>-coastal regions of <a href="Belgium" class="uri" title="wikilink">Belgium</a> and north-western France and across the <a href="English_Channel" title="wikilink">English Channel</a> to <a href="Normandy" class="uri" title="wikilink">Normandy</a>.

<p>As a wing commander, Johnson was allowed to paint his initials <strong>JE-J</strong> on the sides of the fuselage, in place of the usual squadron code letters <strong>AE-</strong> He also had the Spitfire's guns re-harmonised to converge their fire to a single point ahead of the aircraft, rather than the standard pattern which spread the rounds evenly over a circle a few yards across.<a href="#fn119" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref119"><sup>119</sup></a> The first successful engagement for Johnson in <em>EN398</em> was on 3 April 1943 when he shot down an Fw 190.<a href="#fn120" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref120"><sup>120</sup></a> By the time Johnson relinquished command of the Kenley Wing in September 1943 he had shot down 12 enemy aircraft, shared in the destruction of five more, inflicted damage on six and shared in damaging one, all while flying <em>EN398</em>.

The new fuel enabled the <a href="Rolls-Royce_Merlin" title="wikilink">Rolls-Royce Merlin</a> and <a href="Rolls-Royce_Griffon" title="wikilink">Griffon</a> engines to operate at higher boost pressures, especially at lower altitudes, for the duration of the anti-V-1 campaign.<a href="#fn126" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref126"><sup>126</sup></a></p>
<p>The bulk of the Spitfire squadrons, which by D-Day were incorporated into the <a href="Second_Tactical_Air_Force" title="wikilink">2 TAF</a>, were progressively moved across the Channel, operating from forward airfields in <a href="Normandy" class="uri" title="wikilink">Normandy</a>, close behind the front-lines. From late August 1944, as the Allied ground forces over-ran German forces in France and moved forward into <a href="Belgium" class="uri" title="wikilink">Belgium</a> and parts of <a href="The_Netherlands" title="wikilink">The Netherlands</a>, the Spitfire units of 2 TAF moved to new airfields in support.<a href="#fn127" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref127"><sup>127</sup></a> By this time, as air supremacy had been achieved, and in line with 2 TAF's doctrine on the use of fighter-bombers most of the Merlin engined Mk IX and XVI units were used in the <a href="Ground_attack_aircraft" title="wikilink">fighter-bomber</a> role.<a href="#fn128" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref128"><sup>128</sup></a> This meant that these units concentrated on roaming over German territory, attacking ground targets of opportunity and providing tactical ground support to the army units.

Although some pilots were able to gain enough altitude to glide back to a forward airfield, the low altitudes normally flown during ground attack missions meant that light (up to 30 mm) flak claimed most of the Spitfire IXs and XVIs lost while operating as fighter-bombers.<a href="#fn130" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref130"><sup>130</sup></a><a href="#fn131" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref131"><sup>131</sup></a> Just 21 of the 152 Spitfires that were destroyed or damaged from all causes from 1–30 June 1944 were shot down by German fighters.<a href="#fn132" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref132"><sup>132</sup></a></p>
<p>A notable incident occurred on 17 July 1944, when a Spitfire of 602 Squadron attacked the staff car of <em>Generalfeldmarschall</em> <a href="Erwin_Rommel" title="wikilink">Erwin Rommel</a>, wounding him and removing him from command of <a href="Army_Group_B" title="wikilink">Army Group B</a>.<a href="#fn133" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref133"><sup>133</sup></a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>In addition to our offensive patrols and interdiction sorties, we often carried out pre-planned dive bombing attacks on suspected rocket storage areas and launching sites. Sometimes such a target would appear, from the air, as no more than a ring of wheel tracks on some scrubby heathland; even a careful study of aerial reconnaissance photographs often failed to reveal more. The usual force to attack these small targets was four to six Spitfires, each with either one 500 and two 250 pound bombs or two 250 pounders and a long range tanks... As we crossed into enemy territory we were liable to be engaged with predicted fire from heavy 88mm guns. But in a Spitfire this was no great danger, provided one continually changed one's direction and altitude in a series of long climbing or diving turns... the V-2 targets were defended with light flak so when we reached the target area our approach tactics would vary...Accurate bombing was dependant on accurate flying during the dive...the speed would build up quite rapidly, to a maximum of about 360 mph before the release. When he judged the altitude to be about 3,000 ft each pilot let go of his bombs in a salvo, then did a 5G pull-up to bring the nose up to horizontal... the drill was to make a high-speed getaway using the ground for cover.<a href="#fn134" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref134"><sup>134</sup></a></p>

Targets ranged from German occupied Dutch territory into the heart of Germany. <a href="#fn142" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref142"><sup>142</sup></a> The Second Tactical Air Force notes identified flak, and specialist &quot;flak trains&quot; as the main threat during this period. In response the Germans developed special flak wagons to protect valuable transport trains from air attack and &quot;set traps&quot; for unwary Allied fighter pilots. The Trains would be heavily tampered with to seem vulnerable and tempting targets, which would then open up its &quot;wagons&quot; to reveal powerful concentrations of firepower which inflicted inevitable losses on the Spitfire units.<a href="#fn143" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref143"><sup>143</sup></a></p>
<p>Pilots still had to be aware that they were still in hostile skies, and care had to be taken not to be caught by surprise.

<h3 id="afdu-tactical-trials-spitfire-mark-xiv-report-no.-117">AFDU Tactical Trials: Spitfire Mark XIV (Report No. 117)</h3>
<p>As before, the main threat from enemy fighter aircraft came from the <a href="Bf_109" title="wikilink">Bf 109</a> and FW 190. The latest Spitfire variant proved to be more capable than the earlier versions of its counterparts, according to the testing of captured Messerschmitt and Focke-Wulf examples against the Spitfire XIV. On 29 February 1944, <em>RB179</em>, one of the first production F Mk XIVs powered by a Griffon 65, was used in a series of flights where it was compared with a (BMW.801D equipped) FW 190A and a Bf 109G, both of which had been captured earlier. The results were written as a report by Wing Commander A.R Wright and was published on 19 March 1944 as Document A.D.G.B/S.29156/Air Tactics:<a href="#fn151" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref151"><sup>151</sup></a><a href="#fn152" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref152"><sup>152</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="fw-190a">FW 190A</h3>
<p>Against the Fw 190 the Spitfire was, according to the report, superior in speed at most altitudes by 60 mph. Between 0-5,000 and 15,000-20,000 ft this advantage shrank to 20 mph. The Fw 190 was also found to have a significantly inferior climb rate and turning circle, though in the case of a right-hand turn, this difference was not so quite pronounced. In dives it was found that after the initial part of the dive, during which the FW 190 gained slightly, the Mk XIV had a slight advantage. The Fw 190 retained its roll rate advantage, being 'very much better'. It was concluded that in defence, the Spitfire XIV should use its remarkable maximum climb and turning circle against any enemy aircraft; in the attack it could afford to &quot;mix it&quot; but should beware of the quick roll and dive. If this manoeuvre was used by the FW.190 and the Spitfire XIV followed, it was probably not be able to close the range until the Fw 190 had pulled out of its dive.<a href="#fn153" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref153"><sup>153</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="bf-109g">Bf 109G</h3>
<p>When flown in comparison tests against a Bf 109 G the Spitfire Mk XIV was recorded as being 40 mph faster at all altitudes except near 16,000 ft, where this advantage fell to 10 mph. The climb rate comparisons yielded similar results, with the Mk XIV having the advantage above and below 16,000 ft; at 16,000 ft the rates of climb were identical. Zoom climb - without opening the throttle was practically identical, at full throttle the Mk XVI drew easily away from the Bf 109. Diving performance was much closer; the 109 had the advantage and pulled away at the initial part of the dive, but as soon as the 380 mph mark was passed, the Spitfire began to gain on the Bf 109G. In turn radius and rate of roll the XIV was deemed superior.<a href="#fn154" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref154"><sup>154</sup></a></p>
<p>Regarding the captured Fw 190A and the Bf 109G against which the Spitfire XIV was tested, it should be borne in mind that were in each case relatively early versions with performances somewhat lower than the latest sub-types the Luftwaffe had in service early in 1944.<a href="#fn155" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref155"><sup>155</sup></a> The tested Bf 109 was more than likely to have been a G-2/trop of <a href="JG_77" title="wikilink">JG 77</a>, 'Black Six' which was captured SE of <a href="Tobruk" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tobruk</a> in November 1942. By early 1944 the aircraft had suffered a considerable amount of damage, and although repairs had been carried out, the aircraft was probably in far from perfect condition.<a href="#fn156" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref156"><sup>156</sup></a><a href="#fn157" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref157"><sup>157</sup></a> By this time too, the Bf 109 G-6, some variants of which had uprated AS engines, was the latest and most numerous Bf 109G sub-type in the <em>Luftwaffe</em>.<a href="#fn158" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref158"><sup>158</sup></a></p>

<h2 id="photo-reconnaissance">Photo Reconnaissance</h2>
<p>Before the Second World War long range photographic reconnaissance was not considered to be a priority by the RAF, which relied on <a href="Bristol_Blenheim" title="wikilink">Bristol Blenheims</a> to carry out photo-reconnaissance as a secondary task. Short range photo-reconnaissance was left to the <a href="RAF_Army_Cooperation_Command" title="wikilink">Army Cooperation Command's</a> <a href="Westland_Lysander" title="wikilink">Westland Lysanders</a>. Neither aircraft had the speed or altitude performance to avoid enemy fighters, and their light armament meant that expecting them to fight their way through to a target to take photographs was a forlorn hope. Both aircraft types took heavy casualties when faced with modern fighters and <a href="Anti_aircraft_warfare" title="wikilink">A.A</a> fire.<a href="#fn167" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref167"><sup>167</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="early-photo-reconnaissance-spitfires">Early photo-reconnaissance Spitfires</h3>
<p>Shortly before the Second World War started <a href="Flying_Officer" title="wikilink">Flg. Off.</a> Maurice Longbottom submitted a paper to the Air Ministry in which he proposed that the RAF equip itself with small, unarmed aircraft which, stripped of unnecessary weight and equipped with cameras and extra fuel, could rely on high speed, a fast climb and high altitude to avoid enemy defences. He was thinking primarily about the Spitfire which, he argued, was the ideal aircraft for the role. Although his idea was received with interest, it was shelved because there were not yet enough Spitfires available to allow any to be diverted from equipping Fighter Command.</p>
<p>When early operations proved the vulnerability of the Blenheims and Lysanders, in October 1939 the Australian <a href="Sidney_Cotton" title="wikilink">Sidney Cotton</a>, <a href="Wing_Commander_(rank)" title="wikilink">Acting Wing Commander</a> of the newly formed and highly secret &quot;<a href="Heston_Aerodrome" title="wikilink">Heston</a> Flight&quot;, met with <a href="Air_Chief_Marshal" title="wikilink">Air Chief Marshal</a> <a href="Hugh_Dowding" title="wikilink">Hugh Dowding</a>, AOC of Fighter Command and persuaded him to release two Spitfires to his unit.<a href="#fn168" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref168"><sup>168</sup></a> Cotton had already proved Longbottom's theory to be right in practice by using a modified <a href="Lockheed_Electra_Junior" title="wikilink">Lockheed Electra</a> on clandestine photo-reconnaissance missions over Germany.<a href="#fn169" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref169"><sup>169</sup></a></p>
<p>The two Spitfires were &quot;Cottonised&quot; by removing the radio, stripping out the armament, and adding downward-facing <a href="http://www.airrecce.co.uk/cameras/raf_ww2_cameras.html">F.24 5&quot; focal-length cameras</a> to replace the inner-wing guns. All panel lines and the gun-ports were filled in with <a href="Plaster" title="wikilink">plaster of Paris</a> and a special light &quot;Camoutint Green&quot; was applied to the aircraft which was then polished. Thus modified, the Spitfire was capable of reaching over 390 mph.<a href="#fn170" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref170"><sup>170</sup></a></p>
<p>While the fighter versions of the Spitfire stayed in Britain, the first PR missions were flown from bases in France by Cotton's unit which was renamed &quot;No. 2 Camouflage Unit&quot;. The first RAF high- speed, high-altitude photo-reconnaissance mission of the war took place on 18 November 1939 when <a href="Flight_Lieutenant" title="wikilink">Flt. Lt.</a> &quot;Shorty&quot; Longbottom took off from <a href="Seclin" class="uri" title="wikilink">Seclin</a> and attempted to photograph <a href="Aachen" class="uri" title="wikilink">Aachen</a> from 33,000 ft (10,000 m).<a href="#fn171" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref171"><sup>171</sup></a></p>
<p>After the initial successes of these aircraft more Mk I Spitfires were converted in different ways to accomplish different types of reconnaissance missions. On 17 January 1940 2 Camouflage Unit was renamed the &quot;Photographic Development Unit&quot; (PDU), while another PR Unit, <a href="No._212_Squadron_RAF" title="wikilink">212 Squadron</a> was formed in France.<a href="#fn172" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref172"><sup>172</sup></a> Five months later, on 17 June 1940, Sidney Cotton was removed from his role in the RAF for taking money to fly a French businessman to the UK while he was evacuating British agents from Paris. In the following year, he was awarded an <a href="OBE" class="uri" title="wikilink">OBE</a> in recognition of his contribution to the development of photographic reconnaissance.<a href="#fn173" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref173"><sup>173</sup></a> The PDU was expanded, eventually becoming 1 Photographic Reconnaissance Unit (1 PRU) in November 1940, operating from <a href="RAF_Benson" title="wikilink">RAF Benson</a> as part of <a href="RAF_Coastal_Command" title="wikilink">RAF Coastal Command</a>.</p>
<p>On 3 June 1940 <a href="Hauptmann" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hauptmann</a> <a href="Werner_M&lt;U+00F6&gt;lders" title="wikilink">Werner M&lt;U+00F6&gt;lders</a> of <a href="Jagdgeschwader_53" title="wikilink">III./JG53</a> claimed a lone Spitfire shot down near Paris: it is more than likely that this was a Spitfire of 212 Squadron.<a href="#fn174" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref174"><sup>174</sup></a> On 13 June 1940, Flg.

Patterson was awarded the <a href="Distinguished_Flying_Cross_(United_Kingdom)" title="wikilink">DFC</a> for this feat. He was also reprimanded by Cotton for playing at being a fighter pilot when his primary duty was to bring back photographs.<a href="#fn175" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref175"><sup>175</sup></a><a href="#fn176" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref176"><sup>176</sup></a></p>
<p>On 22 February 1941, at the request of Dr <a href="Reginald_Victor_Jones" title="wikilink">R V Jones</a>, a PRU type G Spitfire, flown by Flg. Off. W.K Manifould, took the first clear photographs of Germany's <a href="Freya_radar" title="wikilink">Freya radar</a>. In retaliation for an incident six days earlier, when a Sgt Parrot failed to bring back photos due to heavy flak, Manifould also strafed the AA posts and radar station, rendering the latter useless.<a href="#fn177" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref177"><sup>177</sup></a><a href="#fn178" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref178"><sup>178</sup></a> On 5 December 1941, again at the request of Dr Jones, a PRU Spitfire flown by Flt.

This led directly to the <a href="Operation_Biting" title="wikilink">Bruneval raid</a> in which W&lt;U+00FC&gt;rzburg components and radar operators were captured from the Germans.<a href="#fn179" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref179"><sup>179</sup></a><a href="#fn180" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref180"><sup>180</sup></a></p>
<p>Flying PR missions was not an easy occupation. Spitfire pilots often flew missions lasting seven hours or more; the cramped cockpit was uncomfortable, although the introduction of heating and, later in the war, pressurization, relieved some of the discomfort. Early PR Spitfires lacked radios and, in later versions which did have radio, the pilot was expected to maintain radio silence throughout the flight. The pilot of a high-flying Spitfire would keep constant watch on the rear- view mirror to make sure that a <a href="contrail" class="uri" title="wikilink">contrail</a> would not betray its presence, and he also had to keep an eye out for enemy fighters trying to intercept. Without the help of another crew member a PR Spitfire pilot had to be a good navigator, usually relying on <a href="dead_reckoning" title="wikilink">dead reckoning</a>. Once over the target to be photographed, a precise course and altitude was set and maintained. Even a small deviation from straight and level flight could mean that the cameras would miss a small target by hundreds of yards. Several different paint schemes were used by the early photo-reconnaissance Spitfires until an overall &quot;PRU Blue&quot; was adopted for the majority of PR aircraft from late 1941.<a href="#fn181" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref181"><sup>181</sup></a></p>
<p>Low-altitude (&quot;dicing&quot;) missions, such as the one on the Bruneval W&lt;U+00FC&gt;rzburg and Freya radar position, were usually flown under low cloud, with the pilot constantly on the lookout for enemy fighters and flak positions. These missions were much more dangerous than the high-altitude missions. At high speed and low altitude there was little time to aim the oblique camera: a tiny black + on the side of the canopy was lined up with a small black stripe painted on the aileron and, as the aircraft flew by the target, the pilot had to estimate when to start taking photographs. The only way to successfully take pictures and survive was to take the defences by surprise. Failing that the pilot was supposed to give up and fly home, and he was not allowed to fly over the same target again that day, or the next.<a href="#fn182" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref182"><sup>182</sup></a> Spitfires engaged in low-altitude &quot;dicing&quot; missions were often painted in either overall white or in a very pale &quot;Camoutint Pink&quot;, which was an ideal colour against cloud cover.<a href="#fn183" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref183"><sup>183</sup></a><a href="#fn184" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref184"><sup>184</sup></a></p>
<p>PRU Spitfires also kept a constant watch on the German capital ships in based in <a href="Brest,_France" title="wikilink">Brest</a> harbour throughout 1941 to February 1942, as well as maintaining operations over <a href="Norway" class="uri" title="wikilink">Norway</a>.<a href="#fn185" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref185"><sup>185</sup></a></p>
<p>The first Spitfire to be posted to the Mediterranean theatre was one operated by 1 PRU which arrived on Malta on 22 September 1941. This aircraft was then grounded for three weeks while awaiting replacements for its badly worn tyres. PR Spitfires continued to operate off Malta in ones and twos, usually being re-allocated while en-route to North Africa.<a href="#fn186" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref186"><sup>186</sup></a></p>
<p>Other overseas deployments of Spitfires had seen three Mk IVs being sent to <a href="Vaenga" class="uri" title="wikilink">Vaenga</a>, in North Russia, to keep on eye on German warships during the operation to get <a href="Convoy_PQ-18" title="wikilink">Convoy PQ-18</a> through to Russia. While there, they carried Soviet markings. These aircraft were later formally handed on to the Soviet Air Force.</p>

The first fifteen Spitfires with the new engine were conversions of standard Mk IXs made by the workshops of 1 PRU at RAF Heston. One of the most famous reconnaissance photos of the war, showing the <a href="Moehne_Dam" title="wikilink">Moehne Dam</a> breached after the &quot;Operation Chastise&quot; attack by <a href="No._617_Squadron_RAF" title="wikilink">617 Squadron</a>, was taken in the early hours of 18 May 1943 by Flying Officer F D Fray of <a href="No._542_Squadron_RAF" title="wikilink">542 Squadron</a> flying one of these conversions (called P.R Mk IX).<a href="#fn187" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref187"><sup>187</sup></a> The <a href="Supermarine_Spitfire_(late_Merlin_powered_variants)" title="wikilink">P.R Mk XI</a>, which was the first version of the Spitfire to be built specifically as a photo-reconnaissance aircraft, started replacing all of the earlier conversions of Mk Is, IIs and Vs from mid-1943. Another PR version which started operating at about this time was the <a href="Supermarine_Spitfire_(early_Merlin_powered_variants)" title="wikilink">PR Mk XIII</a>, which replaced the PR Mk VII.<ref name="Price pp.184<U+2013>185&quot;/&gt;</p>
<p>By late 1942 the early PRUs had been expanded and formalised into several squadrons, and with the formation of the <a href="Second_Tactical_Air_Force" title="wikilink">Second Tactical Air Force</a> (or 2nd TAF) in 1943, Army Co-operation Command was wound up and many of its units became dedicated PR Squadrons. The photo-reconnaissance squadrons, especially those units in theatres outside Britain, were self-contained intelligence units; not only did they have the usual aircraft and maintenance crews but they also incorporated a large photographic section, which processed the exposed film in mobile laboratories almost as soon as the aircraft had landed. There were also photo interpreters, photo-printing staff, an intelligence section plus communications staff.<a href="#fn188" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref188"><sup>188</sup></a><a href="#fn189" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref189"><sup>189</sup></a></p>

On the strength of this information a new campaign, &quot;Operation <a href="Operation_Crossbow" title="wikilink">Bodyline/ Crossbow</a>&quot;, was started, resulting in the destruction of most of the &quot;ski sites&quot;. The Germans were forced to abandon the ski-sites and design simplified launch facilities. There were also other problems and the V-1 campaign, intended to start in late 1943, was delayed until the night of 12/13 June 1944.<a href="#fn193" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref193"><sup>193</sup></a></p>

<p>The first Spitfire to be modified to carry underwing bombs was a Malta-based Mk Vc, <em>EP201</em> X-V of <a href="No._229_Squadron_RAF" title="wikilink">229 Squadron</a>, which was adapted to carry one 250 lb bomb under each wing in September 1942.<a href="#fn201" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref201"><sup>201</sup></a> Many Mk V Spitfires equipped to carry a pair of 250-lb bombs attached beneath their wings were used as make-shift bombers, raiding Sicilian fortifications and air bases, and releasing their bombs at 7,000 feet as they dived at an optimum angle of 60 degrees.<a href="#fn202" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref202"><sup>202</sup></a></p>
<p>To counter the prevalent dusty conditions, the Spitfires were fitted with a large <a href="Vokes" class="uri" title="wikilink">Vokes</a> air filter under the nose, which lowered the performance of the aircraft through increased drag. The Vb and Vc(trop) (fitted with large Vokes anti-sand air filters) would also equip units of the <a href="Desert_Air_Force" title="wikilink">Desert Air Force</a> during the <a href="North_African_campaign" title="wikilink">North African campaign</a> by August 1942. <img src="British_Spitfire_takes_off_from_USS_Wasp_(CV-7).jpg" title="fig:Spitfire Vc taking off from deck of USS Wasp, possibly during &quot;Operation Bowery&quot;." alt="Spitfire Vc taking off from deck of USS Wasp, possibly during &quot;Operation Bowery&quot;." /></p>
<p>Here, the Mk Vcs were used as tactical fighter-bombers in addition to their interception role by being equipped with a maximum clearance load of 500 lb of bombs. Mark Vbs equipped the 4th, 31st and 52nd Fighter Groups of the USAAF in the summer of 1942, and the latter two groups continued flying them until succeeded by <a href="Supermarine_Spitfire_(late_Merlin_powered_variants)" title="wikilink">Mk VIIIs</a> in mid-1943. By this time, Spitfire Mk Vcs with stronger wings and extra ammunition began to carry four 20 mm cannon. Many Mk Vs also had the new, smaller and much more efficient &quot;Aboukir&quot; filter instead of the ram air effect nullifying Vokes filter. The new filter was named as such due to its creation in <a href="Aboukir" class="uri" title="wikilink">Aboukir</a>, Egypt by RAF mechanics.</p>
<p>The Spitfire V and, later, much-improved, longer-range <a href="Comparison_of_Supermarine_Spitfire_variants" title="wikilink">Spitfire VIIIs</a> also soon became available in the North African theatre and, henceforth, featured heavily with the RAF, <a href="South_African_Air_Force" title="wikilink">South African Air Force</a> and USAAF during the campaigns in Sicily and Italy.</p>
<p>In the Mediterranean theatre and in Italy, the Mk VIII also fought with the United States Army Air Force. The 31st and 52nd Fighter Groups operated the fighter for some time until, in March 1944, their aircraft were replaced by the <a href="P-51_Mustang" title="wikilink">P-51B/C Mustang</a>, a change which didn't thrill most of the pilots according to many 31st FG members. However, the American fighter was adopted because of its long-range escort capability. Over 300 kills were claimed by the two fighter groups while flying Spitfires.<a href="#fn203" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref203"><sup>203</sup></a></p>
<p>After the fall of <a href="Benito_Mussolini" title="wikilink">Mussolini</a> and the 9 September 1943 <a href="Armistice_between_Italy_and_Allied_armed_forces" title="wikilink">Armistice</a>, the <a href="Italian_Co-Belligerent_Air_Force" title="wikilink">Italian Co-Belligerent Air Force</a> (ICAF) was equipped with surplus Spitfire Mk Vs with the first ground-attack mission flown by 20 imo Gruppo, 51 imo Stormo on 23 October 1944 over Albania. By 31 December 1944 there were 17 Mk V Spitfires on charge (a total of 40 Mk Vs were eventually acquired). Two Italian Spitfires flew the last mission of the European conflict on 5 May 1945.<a href="#fn204" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref204"><sup>204</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="spitfire-versus-italian-fighters">Spitfire versus Italian fighters</h3>
<p>In the Mediterranean theatre, the Spitfire VC encountered the <a href="Macchi_C.202" title="wikilink">Macchi C.202</a> &quot;Folgore&quot;, an aircraft which was a close match. It was widely considered superior to both the Hawker Hurricane and Curtiss P-40 Kittyhawks it fought against, at first on the Libyan front from November 1941, and the equal of the Mk V. It was claimed that it was able to out-turn all three, although the Spitfire had a superior rate of climb. In 1943 the C.202 was partly superseded by the <a href="Macchi_C.205" title="wikilink">Macchi C.205</a> &quot;Veltro&quot; which was an improved version of the &quot;Folgore&quot;. The Veltro was much respected by Allied and Luftwaffe pilots alike. In action, they proved to be extremely effective.<a href="#fn205" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref205"><sup>205</sup></a> One of the top-scoring British fighter pilots of the Second World War, G. Capt. Duncan Smith DSO DFC, greatly respected the Macchi fighters, stating: &quot;In encounters with Macchi 205s particularly we were up against aircraft that could turn and dog-fight with our Spitfires extremely well.&quot;<a href="#fn206" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref206"><sup>206</sup></a></p>
<p>Another Italian figher, the <a href="Reggiane_Re.2005" title="wikilink">Reggiane Re.2005</a>, although built in limited numbers was occasionally encountered by Spitfires over <a href="Sicily" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sicily</a>. G. Capt. Duncan Smith considered: &quot;The Re 2005 'Sagittario' was a potent aircraft. Having had a dog-fight with one of them, I am convinced we would have been hard pressed to cope in our Spitfires operationally, if the Italians or Germans had had a few squadrons equipped with these aircraft at the beginning of the Sicily campaign or in operations from Malta.&quot;<a href="#fn207" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref207"><sup>207</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="italian-cobelligerant-air-force">Italian Cobelligerant Air Force</h2>
<p>On 17 August 1944, after training at Canne airfield, 12 km south of Termoli, a RAF Squadron with Yugoslavian pilots provided 53 Spitfire Vs to the Italian Cobelligerant Air Force. Only 33 would be used in front service with 20&lt;U+00B0&gt; ''Gruppo '' of 51&lt;U+00B0&gt; <em>Stormo</em> becoming the first unit to receive the Spitfire with its first offensive mission on 23 October. From then on, Italian Spitfire missions included escorting transport aircraft, reconnaissance flights and ground attacks. Two Spitfire Vs of 20&lt;U+00B0&gt; <em>Gruppo</em> flew the Regia Aeronautica's last wartime mission on 5 May 1945, a visual reconnaissance of Zagabria. By 8 May, 13 Spitfire (eight operative) were at Canne airport with 356a and 360a <em>Squadriglia</em> of 20&lt;U+00B0&gt; <em>Gruppo</em>. Two more Spitfires were located at Frosinone airport, at <em>Scuola Addestramento Bombardamento e Caccia</em>. <a href="#fn208" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref208"><sup>208</sup></a></p>

<p>In February 1943 the first Spitfires started being received into Soviet service. These were Mk Vbs, most of which had already seen extensive service with the RAF. One of the first units to receive the Spitfire was the 36th Fighter Aviation Regiment, which was part of the <em><a href="Soviet_Air_Forces" title="wikilink">Voyenno-Vozdushnyye Sily or VVS</a></em>. According to Senior Lieutenant Anatoli Ivanov:  In the Soviet &quot;open press&quot; the trend of the times was that foreign-built items were never to be shown as better than home-built products.<a href="#fn210" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref210"><sup>210</sup></a> By this time the VVS was being re-equipped with <a href="Lavochkin_La-5" title="wikilink">Lavochkin La-5s</a> and <a href="Yakovlev_Yak-1" title="wikilink">Yakovlev Yak-1s</a> and <a href="Yakovlev_Yak-9" title="wikilink">Yak-9s</a> which were extremely good low-to-medium-altitude fighters and, with their rugged construction and wide-track undercarriages were well suited to operating from the frontline airfields. As far as can be ascertained the total numbers of Spitfire which were delivered are as follows:</p>

<p><img src="Spitfire_at_temora_nswedit.jpg" title="fig:Supermarine Spitfire VIII in the markings of 457(RAAF) Sqn " alt="Supermarine Spitfire VIII in the markings of 457(RAAF) Sqn " /> The <a href="Royal_Australian_Air_Force" title="wikilink">Royal Australian Air Force</a>, the <a href="Indian_Air_Force" title="wikilink">Royal Indian Air Force</a> and the RAF also used Spitfires against <a href="Empire_of_Japan" title="wikilink">Japanese forces</a> in the <a href="Pacific_War" title="wikilink">Pacific theatre</a>. The first Spitfires in the Far East were two photo-reconnaissance (PR IV) aircraft which operated from airfields in India from October 1942.</p>
<p><a href="Japanese_air_attacks_on_Australia,_1942&lt;U+2013&gt;43" title="wikilink">Japanese air raids on Northern Australia</a> hastened the formation in late 1942 of <a href="No._1_Wing_RAAF" title="wikilink">1 Wing RAAF</a> (<a href="No._54_Squadron_RAF" title="wikilink">54 Squadron</a>, <a href="No._452_Squadron_RAAF" title="wikilink">452(RAAF)</a> and <a href="No._457_Squadron_RAAF" title="wikilink">457(RAAF)</a> squadrons) under the command of <a href="Group_Captain" title="wikilink">Group Captain</a> <a href="Clive_Caldwell" title="wikilink">Clive Caldwell</a>, flying the Spitfire Vc(trop). The wing arrived at <a href="Darwin,_Northern_Territory" title="wikilink">Darwin</a> in February 1943, and saw constant action until September. The Mk Vc versions received by the RAAF proved unreliable and &lt;U+2013&gt; initially at least &lt;U+2013&gt; had a relatively high loss rate. This was due to several factors, including pilot inexperience, engine over-speed due to the loss of oil from the propeller speed reduction unit (a problem resolved by the use of a heavier grade of oil),<a href="#fn212" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref212"><sup>212</sup></a> and the practice of draining glycol coolant before shipment, resulting in internal corrosion of the Merlin engines.</p>
<p>Another factor in the initial high attrition rate was the relatively short endurance of the Spitfire: most of the sorties were, as a matter of course, flown over the wide expanse of ocean between Australia, <a href="New_Guinea" title="wikilink">New Guinea</a> and <a href="Timor" class="uri" title="wikilink">Timor</a>. Even when fitted with drop tanks the Spitfires could not afford to fly too far from base without the danger of running out of fuel over water. As a result, when an incoming raid was detected, the Spitfires were forced to climb as fast as possible in an attempt to get into a favourable position. In the prevailing hot, humid climate this meant that the Merlin engines were often overheating even before combat was joined. The Spitfires were fitted with the Vokes tropical filters which reduced performance: in an attempt to increase performance the filters on several Spitfires were removed and replaced by the standard non-tropicalised air intake and lower engine cowlings which had been manufactured by the base workshops. The experiment proved to be a failure and the Spitfires were quickly refitted with the tropical filters.</p>
<p>Many of the Australian and British airmen who flew in 1 Wing were experienced combat veterans, some of whom who had flown <a href="Curtiss_P-40" title="wikilink">P-40s</a> with the <a href="Desert_Air_Force" title="wikilink">Desert Air Force</a> in North Africa, while others had flown Spitfires over Europe. They were used to being able to outmanoeuvre opposing fighters and were shocked to discover that the <a href="Mitsubishi_A6M" title="wikilink">Zeros</a> they were now flying against were able to outmanoeuvre the Spitfire. Several Spitfires were lost before the pilots learned not to attempt to get into a turning dogfight with the agile Japanese fighters. In spite of these problems the Spitfires were reasonably successful and at times were able to catch the <a href="Mitsubishi_Ki-46" title="wikilink">Mitsubishi Ki-46</a> reconnaissance aircraft which had hitherto flown fast enough and high enough to evade interception.<a href="#fn213" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref213"><sup>213</sup></a></p>
<p>The first of 410 Spitfire Mk VIIIs started replacing the Mk Vcs from October 1943, although, in the event, they were to see very limited air-to-air combat. By mid-1943 the heavy losses imposed on the Japanese Navy in the Solomon Islands campaign and in New Guinea meant that the JNAF could not keep up its attacks on northern Australia. Other units equipped with the Spitfires included <a href="No._79_Squadron_RAAF" title="wikilink">79 Squadron</a>, <a href="No._85_Squadron_RAAF" title="wikilink">85 Squadron</a>, <a href="No._548_Squadron_RAAF" title="wikilink">548 Squadron</a> and <a href="No._549_Squadron_RAAF" title="wikilink">549 Squadron</a>.<a href="#fn214" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref214"><sup>214</sup></a></p>
<p>Politics also played a part; the supreme commander of the South-West Pacific theatre <a href="Douglas_MacArthur" title="wikilink">Douglas MacArthur</a> did not want Australians or any other non-Americans to share in his triumphant return to the Philippines. As a result of this, RAAF Spitfire Vs and VIIIs were increasingly used in the fighter-bomber role in mopping-up operations against the large pockets of Japanese forces still remaining in New Guinea, and some Australian based units did not get to see any combat at all. The Australian pilots regarded the situation as intolerable and saw this as a waste of effort and lives, especially as many of them were experienced and battle-hardened. By the end of the Pacific war 80 (Fighter) Wing was based on the <a href="Morotai" class="uri" title="wikilink">Morotai</a> Island in the <a href="Halmaheras" class="uri" title="wikilink">Halmaheras</a> Group assisting Australian ground troops in <a href="Borneo" class="uri" title="wikilink">Borneo</a>.<a href="#fn215" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref215"><sup>215</sup></a> It was here that the so-called <a href="Morotai_Mutiny" title="wikilink">Morotai Mutiny</a> took place.</p>
<p>In the <a href="China_Burma_India" title="wikilink">China Burma India</a> (CBI) theatre, the first Spitfire Vcs reached three squadrons on the India-Burma front in November 1943. Spitfire pilots met Japanese for the first time on <a href="Boxing_Day" title="wikilink">Boxing Day</a>, 1943. A pair of Spits piloted by Flying Officer Geoffrey William Andrews and Flight Sergeant Harry B. Chatfield, attacked a formation of Japanese planes over <a href="Chittagong" class="uri" title="wikilink">Chittagong</a>. Andrews destroyed a fighter and a bomber, damaging a second, while Chatfield shot down another two. On the last day of 1943, Royal Australian Air Force destroyed eleven Japanese bombers and three fighters. Churchill complimented with the Australian Squadron for &quot;brilliant exploit&quot;. <a href="#fn216" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref216"><sup>216</sup></a> These aircraft started being replaced by the first Mk VIIIs in February 1944. Spitfires were a major part of the defence against the <a href="Imperial_Japanese_Army_Air_Force" title="wikilink">Imperial Japanese Army Air Force</a> (IJAAF) during the <a href="Battle_of_Kohima" title="wikilink">Kohima</a> and <a href="Battle_of_Imphal" title="wikilink">Imphal</a> campaign of early to mid 1944, in which the Japanese Army attempted to destroy the <a href="British_14th_Army" title="wikilink">British 14th Army</a> and invade India. General <a href="William_Slim" title="wikilink">William Slim</a>, the commander of the 14th Army, had planned to use the new Spitfire VIII to protect <a href="C-46_Commando" title="wikilink">C-46 Commando</a> transports which were supplying the 14th Army by air.

<p>Following the Second World War, the Spitfire remained in use with many air forces around the world. The main foreign air force to use Spitfire was France's Arm&lt;U+00E9&gt;e de l'Air that ordered more than 500 Supermarine fighters, Mark V, VIII, IX, and XVI variants. Other main users were Dutch Air Force, that received 76 Mark IX, Turkey, with 273, Greek, with 242. The Belgian Air Force received 134 Mark XIV plus 69 Mark IX and and XVI. The Indian Air force received 159 Spitfires and the Aeronautica Italiana, 140 Mk IXs. The Southern Rhodesian Air Force received 22 Spitfire XXIIs from surplus RAF stocks in 1951. <a href="#fn217" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref217"><sup>217</sup></a></p>

<p>Soon after the end of the Second World War, the <a href="Swedish_Air_Force" title="wikilink">Swedish Air Force</a> equipped a photo-reconnaissance wing, F 11 in <a href="Nyk&lt;U+00F6&gt;ping" class="uri" title="wikilink">Nyk&lt;U+00F6&gt;ping</a> (just south of <a href="Stockholm" class="uri" title="wikilink">Stockholm</a>), with 50 Mk XIXs, designated S 31. Several S 31 photographic missions in the late 1940s entailed flagrant violations of Soviet and, at least once, Finnish airspace in order to document activities at the air and naval installations in the Baltic and Kola regions. At that time, no Soviet fighter was able to reach the operational altitude of the S 31. No Swedish aircraft were lost during those clandestine operations. However, by the early 1950s, Soviet air defences had become so effective that such practices had to cease. The S 31s were replaced by jet-powered <a href="SAAB_Tunnan" title="wikilink">SAAB S 29Cs</a> in the mid-1950s.<a href="#fn218" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref218"><sup>218</sup></a></p>

<p>After the Second World War, eight flyable <a href="Italian_Air_Force" title="wikilink">Italian Air Force</a> Mk Vs were supplemented by 145 Mk IXs (obtained in two batches of 60 and 85 aircraft). The Spitfire went into service with 51&lt;U+00B0&gt; and 5&lt;U+00B0&gt; <em>Stormo</em> (wing) flying reconnaissance missions over the Balkans as well as acting in cooperation with the Italian Army and providing a defensive force. Well-liked by pilots, the Spitfires were involved in several postwar air races and trophy competitions including the Zerbinati Trophy. Italian P-51s and Spitfires were entered in the handicap race with P-51s penalized by a minute for speed, and Spitfires penalised a similar amount in climb rate. The Spitfire Mk IX remained in service until 1950&lt;U+2013&gt;1952 when 30 survivors were supplied to the Israeli Air Force (HHA). Eventually, these ex-Italian aircraft were sent to <a href="Burma" class="uri" title="wikilink">Burma</a> in 1954&lt;U+2013&gt;55.<a href="#fn223" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref223"><sup>223</sup></a> Today, one ex-Italian Air Force Spitfire Mk IX, <em>MM4084</em>, is on display at Vigna di Valle, Rome.</p>

The most intense attacks on enemy targets were made in late 1949; on 21 October, RAF Spitfires and Seafires from 800 Squadron flew 62 sorties. The 16 Spitires from the two squadrons based in Singapore flew some 1,800 missions against Communist positions. The last offensive sorties made by RAF Spitfires were flown by 60 Squadron Mk XVIIIs over Malaya on 1 January 1951. The last of all was led by Wing Commander <a href="Wilfrid_Duncan_Smith" title="wikilink">Wilfrid Duncan Smith</a>. Fully restored, the Spitfire he flew that day, TP280, flies today in the United States. <a href="#fn235" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref235"><sup>235</sup></a></p>

<p>One notable variant was the privately-owned <em>LV-NMZ</em> (Argentine registration). This was a PR XI, <em>PL-972</em>, purchased by James Elwyn Storey and his brother Jack to undertake aerial photography for the Argentine government. Both served in the RAF during the Second World War. James flew his Spitfire from Bournemouth (UK) to Gibraltar, on to Dakar in Senegal, from Dakar to Natal in Brazil, then Rio de Janeiro, Porto Alegre and finally Buenos Aires. Using external wing tanks and a belly ferry tank, he established two records: one for the heaviest fuel load ever carried by a Spitfire and one for the longest flight for a Spitfire, the Dakar to Natal leg of approximately 1,870 miles. There are currently some 50 Spitfires flying today, a number that waxes and wanes as one aircraft is restored to airworthy condition and another crashes or retires for further restoration. A growing number of companies, based in England, France, Australia, Canada and the United States, manufacture replica Spitfires with engines of 65 hp or Chevrolets V-8 engines, or Japanese V-6s. There are even full-scale machines available, powered by 1,200 hp Allison V-12 offering considerable performance. <a href="#fn236" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref236"><sup>236</sup></a></p>
<p>Some air forces retained Spitfires in service well into the 1960s.</p>
