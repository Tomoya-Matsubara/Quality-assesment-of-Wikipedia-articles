<p><strong>Allan David Bloom</strong> (<a href="14_September" title="wikilink">14 September</a>, <a href="1930" class="uri" title="wikilink">1930</a> in <a href="Indianapolis,_Indiana" title="wikilink">Indianapolis, Indiana</a> – <a href="7_October" title="wikilink">7 October</a>, <a href="1992" class="uri" title="wikilink">1992</a> in <a href="Chicago" class="uri" title="wikilink">Chicago</a>, <a href="Illinois" class="uri" title="wikilink">Illinois</a>) was an American <a href="philosopher" class="uri" title="wikilink">philosopher</a>, <a href="essayist" class="uri" title="wikilink">essayist</a> and <a href="academic" class="uri" title="wikilink">academic</a>. Bloom championed the idea of '<a href="Great_Books" title="wikilink">Great Books</a>' education, as did his mentor <a href="Leo_Strauss" title="wikilink">Leo Strauss</a>, and became famous for criticism of contemporary American <a href="higher_education" title="wikilink">higher education</a> in his bestselling 1987 book, <em>The Closing of the American Mind</em>.</p>
<p>In <a href="2000" class="uri" title="wikilink">2000</a>, years after Bloom's passing, <a href="Saul_Bellow" title="wikilink">Saul Bellow</a>, Bloom's close friend and teaching partner at the <a href="University_of_Chicago" title="wikilink">University of Chicago</a>, wrote a novel based on his colleague titled <em><a href="Ravelstein" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ravelstein</a></em>. In it, among other personal details previously not disclosed publicly, it was revealed that Bloom was gay and likely died of complications from <a href="HIV" class="uri" title="wikilink">HIV</a>-<a href="AIDS" class="uri" title="wikilink">AIDS</a>.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="education">Education</h2>
<p>Allan Bloom was an only child born to social worker parents in Indianapolis. As a thirteen year old, he read a <em><a href="Readers_Digest" title="wikilink">Readers Digest</a></em> article about the <a href="University_of_Chicago" title="wikilink">University of Chicago</a> and told his parents he wanted to attend; his parents thought it was unreasonable and did not encourage his hopes.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> Yet later, when his family moved to Chicago in 1944, his parents met a <a href="psychiatrist" class="uri" title="wikilink">psychiatrist</a> and family friend whose son was enrolled in the University of Chicago&lt;U+2019&gt;s <a href="humanities" class="uri" title="wikilink">humanities</a> program for gifted students. In 1946 Bloom was accepted to the same program and spent the next decade of his life enrolled at the university in Chicago&lt;U+2019&gt;s <a href="Hyde_Park,_Chicago" title="wikilink">Hyde Park</a> neighborhood.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> This began his life-long passion for the 'idea' of the university.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>In the preface to <em>Giants and Dwarfs: Essays, 1960-1990</em>, he stated that his education &quot;began with <a href="Freud" class="uri" title="wikilink">Freud</a> and ended with <a href="Plato" class="uri" title="wikilink">Plato</a>.&quot; The theme of this education was self-knowledge, or self-discovery -- an idea that Bloom would later write seemed impossible to conceive of for a Midwestern American boy. He credits <a href="Leo_Strauss" title="wikilink">Leo Strauss</a> as the teacher who made this endeavor possible for him.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>After earning his <a href="bachelor&lt;U+2019&gt;s_degree" title="wikilink">bachelor&lt;U+2019&gt;s degree</a> he enrolled in the <a href="Committee_on_Social_Thought" title="wikilink">Committee on Social Thought</a>, where he was assigned <a href="Classicist" class="uri" title="wikilink">Classicist</a> <a href="David_Grene" title="wikilink">David Grene</a> as tutor. Grene recalled Bloom as an energetic and humorous student completely dedicated to reading the classics, but with no definite career ambitions.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> The <a href="Committee_on_Social_Thought" title="wikilink">Committee on Social Thought</a> was a unique <a href="interdisciplinary" class="uri" title="wikilink">interdisciplinary</a> program that attracted a small number of students due to its rigorous academic requirements and lack of clear employment opportunities after graduation. <a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a>. Bloom earned his Ph.D. from the <a href="Committee_on_Social_Thought" title="wikilink">Committee on Social Thought</a> of the <a href="University_of_Chicago" title="wikilink">University of Chicago</a> in <a href="1955" class="uri" title="wikilink">1955</a>.</p>
<h2 id="career">Career</h2>
<p>Bloom studied and taught abroad in Paris (1953-55) and Germany (1957). Upon returning to the United States he taught adult education students at the University of Chicago with his friend <a href="http://frontrow.bc.edu/program/dannhauser/">Werner J. Dannhauser</a>, author of <em><a href="Nietzsche&#39;s_View_of_Socrates" title="wikilink">Nietzsche's View of Socrates</a></em>. Bloom later taught at <a href="Yale_University" title="wikilink">Yale</a>, <a href="Cornell_University" title="wikilink">Cornell</a>, <a href="Tel_Aviv_University" title="wikilink">Tel Aviv University</a> and the <a href="University_of_Toronto" title="wikilink">University of Toronto</a>, before returning to the University of Chicago.</p>
<p>In <a href="1963" class="uri" title="wikilink">1963</a>, as a Professor at Cornell, Allan Bloom served as a faculty member of the <a href="Telluride_Association" title="wikilink">Telluride Association</a>. The organization aims to foster an everyday synthesis of self-governance and intellectual inquiry that enables students to develop their potential for leadership and public service. The students receive free room and board in the Telluride House on the <a href="Cornell_University" title="wikilink">Cornell University</a> campus and run the house themselves, hiring staff, supervising maintenance and organizing seminars. Bloom had a major influence on several residents of <a href="Telluride_House" title="wikilink">Telluride House</a>, including <a href="Paul_Wolfowitz" title="wikilink">Paul Wolfowitz</a>, one of the founding members of both the <a href="Project_for_the_New_American_Century" title="wikilink">Project for the New American Century</a> and the <a href="New_Citizenship_Project" title="wikilink">New Citizenship Project</a>.</p>
<p>During 1968, he published his most significant work of philosophical translation and interpretation, a translation of <a href="Plato" class="uri" title="wikilink">Plato</a>'s <em><a href="Republic_(Plato)" title="wikilink"> Republic</a></em>. Bloom strived to achieve &quot;the first translation of Plato's Republic that attempts to be strictly literal.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a>&quot; Although the translation is not universally accepted, Bloom said he always conceptualized the translator's role as a matchmaker between readers and the texts he translated and interpreted<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a>. He repeated this effort while a Professor at the University of Toronto in 1978, translating <a href="Jean-Jacques_Rousseau" title="wikilink">Jean-Jacques Rousseau's</a> <em><a href="Emile:_Or,_On_Education" title="wikilink">Emile</a></em>. Bloom was an editor for the scholarly journal <em><a href="Political_Theory" title="wikilink">Political Theory</a></em> as well as a contributor to <em><a href="History_of_Political_Philosophy" title="wikilink">History of Political Philosophy</a></em> (edited by <a href="Joseph_Cropsey" title="wikilink">Joseph Cropsey</a> and <a href="Leo_Strauss" title="wikilink">Leo Strauss</a>) among many other publications during his years of academic teaching. Bloom also translated and commented upon Rousseau's &quot;Letter to D'Alembert On the Theater,&quot; relying heavily upon <a href="Plato&#39;s_Laws" title="wikilink">Plato's Laws</a>.</p>
<p>After returning to Chicago, he befriended and taught courses with <a href="Saul_Bellow" title="wikilink">Saul Bellow</a>. Bellow wrote the Preface to <em>The Closing of the American Mind</em> in 1987, the book that made Bloom famous and wealthy. Bellow later immortalized his dead friend in the novel <em><a href="Ravelstein" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ravelstein</a></em>. Bloom's last book was <em><a href="Love_and_Friendship_(Bloom)" title="wikilink">Love and Friendship</a></em>, where he offered interpretations of novels by Stendhal, Jane Austen, Flaubert, and Tolstoy in light of Rousseau's influence on the <a href="Romantic_movement" title="wikilink">Romantic movement</a>, of plays by <a href="William_Shakespeare" title="wikilink">William Shakespeare</a>, and finally of <a href="Symposium_(Plato)" title="wikilink">Plato's Symposium</a>.</p>
<h2 id="philosophy">Philosophy</h2>
<p>Bloom's work is not easily defined, yet there is a thread that links all of his published material. Allan Bloom was a philosopher and he was primarily concerned with preserving the philosophical way of life for the future generation. He strived to do this through both <a href="scholarly" class="uri" title="wikilink">scholarly</a> and popular writing. Accordingly, his writings fall into two basic categories: <a href="scholarly" class="uri" title="wikilink">scholarly</a> (e.g. <em><a href="Plato&#39;s_Republic" title="wikilink">Plato's Republic</a></em>) and popular political comment (e.g. <em>Closing of the American Mind</em>). On the surface, this is a valid distinction, yet closer examinations of Bloom&lt;U+2019&gt;s works reveal a direct connection between the two types of expression, which reflect his view of <a href="philosophy" class="uri" title="wikilink">philosophy</a> and the role of the <a href="philosopher" class="uri" title="wikilink">philosopher</a> in political life.</p>
<h3 id="platos-republic"><em>Plato's Republic</em></h3>
<p><img src="Bloom&#39;s_Republic_Translation_and_essay.gif" title="fig:Allan Bloom&#39;s translation and interpretation, Second edition 1991." alt="Allan Bloom&#39;s translation and interpretation, Second edition 1991." width="100" />Bloom&lt;U+2019&gt;s translation and interpretive essay on <em>Plato&lt;U+2019&gt;s Republic</em> was published in <a href="1968" class="uri" title="wikilink">1968</a>. For Bloom, previous translations were lacking. In particuliar, Bloom was eager to sweep away the <a href="Neoplatonism" title="wikilink">Christian Platonist</a> layers that had coated the translations and scholarly analysis. In 1971, he wrote, &quot;With the <em>Republic</em>, for example, a long tradition of philosophy tells us what the issues are. [...] This sense of familiarity may be spurious; we may be reading the text as seen by the tradition rather than raising Plato's own questions<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Up until the late 20th century, most English language Platonists were following a tradition that blended Christian <a href="theology" class="uri" title="wikilink">theology</a> with <a href="Plato" class="uri" title="wikilink">Plato</a>. This view, named Christian Platonism, interprets Plato as prophet of the coming Christian age, a <a href="monotheist" class="uri" title="wikilink">monotheist</a> in a <a href="polytheist" class="uri" title="wikilink">polytheist</a> world. In this school, <a href="Socrates" class="uri" title="wikilink">Socrates</a> is considered a pre-Christian saint; the tradition emphasizes <a href="Socrates" class="uri" title="wikilink">Socrates</a>' 'goodness' and other-worldly attributes, such as accepting his death like a <a href="martyr" class="uri" title="wikilink">martyr</a>. In the words of <a href="George_Grant_(philosopher)" title="wikilink">George Grant</a>, &quot;Straussians say that Christianity led to overextension of soul.&quot;<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<p>Yet there developed a different type of <a href="Platonism" class="uri" title="wikilink">Platonism</a>, <a href="Paganism" title="wikilink">Pagan</a> Platonism, a type of which Bloom became aware and most certainly adopted from his teacher <a href="Leo_Strauss" title="wikilink">Leo Strauss</a> (1899-1973), the most important representative of this thought in the past century.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> Adherents have a significantly different view of <em>Plato&lt;U+2019&gt;s Republic</em>.</p>
<p>Strauss developed this point of view by studying ancient Islamic and Jewish theorists, such as <a href="Al-Farabi" class="uri" title="wikilink">Al-Farabi</a> (870-950) and <a href="Moses_Maimonides" title="wikilink">Moses Maimonides</a> (1135-1204). Each philosopher was faithful to his religion but sought to integrate classical political philosophy into <a href="Islam" class="uri" title="wikilink">Islam</a> and <a href="Judaism" class="uri" title="wikilink">Judaism</a>. Islam has a prophet-legislator <a href="Muhammad" class="uri" title="wikilink">Muhammad</a> and similarly, Jewish law is a function of its theology. Thus these philosophers had to write with great skill, incorporating the ideas of <a href="Plato" class="uri" title="wikilink">Plato</a> and <a href="Aristotle" class="uri" title="wikilink">Aristotle</a>, many of which contradicted or contravened Islamic or Jewish thought and practice, without being seen to challenge the theology. According to Strauss, <a href="Al-Farabi" class="uri" title="wikilink">Al-Farabi</a> and <a href="Moses_Maimonides" title="wikilink">Moses Maimonides</a> were really writing for potential philosophers within the pious faithful. Strauss calls this the discovery of esoteric writing, and he first presents it as a possibility in <em>Persecution and the Art of Writing</em> (1952). Christianity differed from these faiths in that philosophy was always free to establish a foothold in Christendom, without necessarily being seen as <a href="heretical" class="uri" title="wikilink">heretical</a>. All one has to do is think of <a href="Augustine_of_Hippo" title="wikilink">Saint Augustine</a> (354-430) and his <em>City of God</em> and <em>On Free Will</em>.</p>
<p>Strauss took this insight and applied it eventually to <a href="Plato" title="wikilink">Plato&lt;U+2019&gt;s</a> writings themselves. Bloom's translation and essay of the <em>Republic</em> takes this stance; therefore, it is radically different in many important aspects from the previous translations and interpretations of the <em>Republic</em>. Most notable is Bloom's discussion of <a href="Socratic_irony" title="wikilink">Socratic irony</a>. In fact, <a href="irony" class="uri" title="wikilink">irony</a> is the key to Bloom&lt;U+2019&gt;s take on the <em>Republic</em>. (See his discussion of Books II-VI of the <em>Republic</em>.) Allan Bloom says a philosopher is immune to irony because he can see the <a href="tragic" class="uri" title="wikilink">tragic</a> as <a href="comic" class="uri" title="wikilink">comic</a> and comic as tragic. Bloom refers to Socrates, the philosopher <em>par excellence,</em> in his Interpretative Essay stating, &quot;Socrates can go naked where others go clothed; he is not afraid of ridicule. He can also contemplate sexual intercourse where others are stricken with terror; he is not afraid of moral indignation. In other words he treats the comic seriously and the tragic lightly<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a>. Thus irony in the <em>Republic</em> refers to the '<a href="Just_City_in_Speech" title="wikilink">Just City in Speech</a>'. Bloom looks at it not as a model for future <a href="society" class="uri" title="wikilink">society</a>, nor as a template for the human <a href="soul" class="uri" title="wikilink">soul</a>; rather, it is an ironic city, an example of the distance between philosophy and every potential philosopher. Bloom follows Strauss in suggesting that the '<a href="Just_City_in_Speech" title="wikilink">Just City in Speech</a>' is not <a href="nature" title="wikilink">natural</a>; it is man-made, and thus ironic.</p>
<h2 id="closing-of-the-american-mind"><em>Closing of the American Mind</em></h2>
<p><em>Closing of the American Mind</em> (ISBN 5-551-86868-0) was published in 1987, five years after Bloom published an essay in <em>The National Review</em> about the failure of universities to serve the needs of students. With the encouragement of <a href="Saul_Bellow" title="wikilink">Saul Bellow</a>, his colleague at the University of Chicago, he expanded his thoughts into a book &quot;about a life, I've led&quot;<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> that critically reflected on the current state of higher education in American universities. His friends and admirers imagined the work would be a modest success, as did Bloom, who recognized his publisher&lt;U+2019&gt;s modest advance to complete the project as a lack of sales confidence. Yet on the momentum of strong initial reviews, including one by <a href="Christopher_Lehmann-Haupt" title="wikilink">Christopher Lehmann-Haupt</a> in the <em><a href="New_York_Times" title="wikilink">New York Times</a></em>, it became an unexpected best seller, eventually selling close to half a million copies in hardback and remaining at number one on the <em>New York Times</em> Non-fiction Best Seller list for four months.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> <img src="Closing_of_the_American_Mind_cover.jpg" title="fig:Allan Bloom&#39;s Closing of the American Mind." alt="Allan Bloom&#39;s Closing of the American Mind." width="100" /></p>
<p>Bloom's <em>Closing of the American Mind</em> is a critique of the contemporary university and how Bloom sees it as failing its students. Also, Bloom criticizes <a href="analytic_philosophy" title="wikilink">analytic philosophy</a> as a movement, &quot;Professors of these schools simply would not and could not talk about anything important, and they themselves do not represent a philosophic life for the students.&quot; To a great extent, Bloom's criticism revolves around the devaluation of the Great Books of Western Thought as a source of wisdom. However, Bloom's critique extends beyond the university to speak to the general crisis in American society. &quot;Closing of the American Mind&quot; draws analogies between the <a href="United_States" title="wikilink">United States</a> and the <a href="Weimar_Republic" title="wikilink">Weimar Republic</a>. The modern liberal philosophy, he says, enshrined in the <a href="Age_of_Enlightenment" title="wikilink">Enlightenment</a> thought of <a href="John_Locke" title="wikilink">John Locke</a> - that a just society could be based upon self-interest alone, coupled by the emergence of relativism in American thought - had led to this crisis.</p>
<p>For Bloom, this created a void in the souls of Americans, into which demagogic radicals as exemplified by 60's student leaders could leap. (In the same fashion, Bloom suggests, that the <a href="Nazism" title="wikilink">Nazi</a> brownshirts once filled the <a href="lacuna" class="uri" title="wikilink">lacuna</a> created in German society by the <a href="Weimar_Republic" title="wikilink">Weimar Republic</a>.) In the second instance, the higher calling of philosophy/reason understood as <a href="freedom_of_thought" title="wikilink">freedom of thought</a>, had been eclipsed by a pseudo-philosophy, or an <a href="ideology" class="uri" title="wikilink">ideology</a> of thought. <a href="Relativism" class="uri" title="wikilink">Relativism</a> was one feature of modern liberal philosophy that had subverted the Platonic/Socratic teaching. The Great Books of Western Thought simply became the ramblings of dead white men rather than beacons leading to the highest calling.</p>
<p>The power behind Bloom's critique of contemporary <a href="social_movements" title="wikilink">social movements</a> at play in universities or society at large is derived from his philosophical orientation. The failure of contemporary <a href="liberal_education" title="wikilink">liberal education</a> leads to the social and sexual habits of modern students, and their inability to fashion a life for themselves beyond the mundane offerings touted as success. Bloom argues that commercial pursuits had become more highly valued than the philosophic quest for truth or the civilized pursuits of honor and glory.</p>
<p>In particular, he looked seriously at the effects of <a href="popular_music" title="wikilink">popular music</a> on the lives of students, placing pop music, or the generic term- &quot;<a href="rock_music" title="wikilink">rock music</a>&quot;- in a historical context from <em>Plato&lt;U+2019&gt;s Republic</em> to <a href="Nietzsche" class="uri" title="wikilink">Nietzsche</a>&lt;U+2019&gt;s <a href="Dionysian" class="uri" title="wikilink">Dionysian</a> longings. Treating it with infinite seriousness, he poured fresh attention on the industry, its target marketing to children and teenagers, its top performers, and its hypocritical pretensions as <a href="liberation" class="uri" title="wikilink">liberation</a> and <a href="Freedom_(political)" title="wikilink">freedom</a>. Some critics, including <a href="Frank_Zappa" title="wikilink">Frank Zappa</a>, denounced Bloom's view of rock music as a form of racist bigotry.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> Bloom, informed by <a href="Socrates" class="uri" title="wikilink">Socrates</a>, <a href="Aristotle" class="uri" title="wikilink">Aristotle</a>, <a href="Rousseau" class="uri" title="wikilink">Rousseau</a> and Nietzsche, explored music&lt;U+2019&gt;s power in the human soul. He cites the <a href="soldier" class="uri" title="wikilink">soldier</a> who throws himself into battle at the urging of the <a href="drum_corps" title="wikilink">drum corps</a>, the pious believer who prays under the spell of a religious <a href="hymn" class="uri" title="wikilink">hymn</a>, the lover seduced by the romantic <a href="guitar" class="uri" title="wikilink">guitar</a>, and points towards the tradition of philosophy that treated music education as paramount. He names <a href="Mick_Jagger" title="wikilink">Mick Jagger</a> as a cardinal representative of the hypocrisy and intellectual sterility of rock. Pop music employs sexual images and language to enthrall the young, and persuade them that their petty rebelliousness is authentic politics, when in fact they are being controlled by the money managers successful performers like Jagger quietly serve. In fact, Bloom claims Jagger is a <a href="hero" class="uri" title="wikilink">hero</a> to many university students who envy his fame and wealth, but are really just bored by the lack of options before them.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> Along with the absence of literature in the lives of the young, and their fractured erotic relationships, the first part of <em>Closing</em> tries to explain the current state of education in a fashion beyond the purview of an <a href="economist" class="uri" title="wikilink">economist</a> or <a href="psychiatrist" class="uri" title="wikilink">psychiatrist</a>- contemporary culture's leading umpires.</p>
<h3 id="critical-reception">Critical reception</h3>
<p>The success of the work brought a wide spectrum of critics, making some scholars interesting bed fellows. <a href="Martha_Nussbaum" title="wikilink">Martha Nussbaum</a>, a classical philosopher and <a href="feminist" class="uri" title="wikilink">feminist</a>, and <a href="Harry_V._Jaffa" title="wikilink">Harry V. Jaffa</a>, a conservative disciple of Strauss, both claimed Bloom was deeply influenced by 19th-century European philosophers, especially <a href="Friedrich_Nietzsche" title="wikilink">Friedrich Nietzsche</a>. Nussbaum wrote that, for Bloom, Nietzsche had been disastrously influential in modern American thought.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> Jaffa went so far as to point out the lack of moral mention of the role <a href="gay_rights" title="wikilink">gay rights</a> were having in the lives of current students.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> According to Jaffa, while Bloom discusses contemporary social movements, particularly those that gained ascendancy in the 1960s, he is virtually silent on the <a href="gay_rights_movement" title="wikilink">gay rights movement</a><a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>
<p>Some critics embraced Bloom's argument. Thus <a href="Norman_Podhoretz" title="wikilink">Norman Podhoretz</a> in his review noted that the closed mindedness in the title alludes to the paradoxical consequence of the academic &quot;open mind&quot; found in liberal political thought. Namely &quot;the narrow and intolerant dogmatism&quot; that dismisses any attempt, by Plato or the Hebrew Bible for example, to provide a rational basis for moral judgments. Podhoretz continued, &quot;Bloom goes on to charge liberalism with vulgarizing the noble ideals of freedom and equality, and he offers brilliantly acerbic descriptions of the sexual revolution and the feminist movement, which he sees as products of this process of vulgarization.&quot;<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a></p>
<p>In a 1989 article (<em>The German Quarterly</em>, Vol. 62, No. 3, Focus: Literature since 1945 (Summer, 1989)), Ann Clark Fehn discusses the critical reception of the book, noting that Bloom's book had eclipsed other titles that year dealing with higher education (<em>College</em>, by Ernest Boyer, and <em>Cultural Literacy</em>, by E. D. Hirsch) and quoted <em>Publisher's Weekly</em> describing Bloom's book as a &quot;best-seller made by reviews.&quot;</p>

<li>Music is the medium of the <em>human</em> soul in its most ecstatic condition of wonder and terror. Nietzsche, who in large measure agrees with Plato's analysis, says...that a mixture of cruelty and coarse sensuality characterized this state... Music is the soul's primitive and primary speech... without articulate speech or reason. It is not only not reasonable, it is hostile to reason. (<em>Closing of the American Mind</em>, 72)</li>
<li>Rock music has one appeal only, a barbaric appeal, to sexual desire- not love, not eros, but sexual desire undeveloped and untutored.&quot; (<em>Closing of the American Mind</em>, 72)</li>
<li>'The relativity of truth is not a theoretical insight but a moral postulate, the condition of a free society, or so [the students] see it. They have all been equipped with this framework early on, and it is the modern replacement for the inalienable natural rights that used to be the traditional American grounds for a free society. That it is a moral issue for students is revealed by the character of their response when challenged -- a combination of disbelief and indignation: &quot;Are you an absolutist?,&quot; the only alternative they know, uttered in the same tone as &quot;Are you a monarchist?&quot; or &quot;Do you really believe in witches?&quot;' (Closing of the American Mind, 25)</li>
