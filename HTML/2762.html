The team, along with the <a href="Seattle_Seahawks" title="wikilink">Seattle Seahawks</a>, joined the NFL in  as an <a href="expansion_team" title="wikilink">expansion team</a>. They played their first season in the AFC West as part of the 1976 expansion plan. After the season, they switched divisions with the <a href="Seattle_Seahawks" title="wikilink">Seattle Seahawks</a> and became part of the NFC.

<p>The Buccaneers joined the NFL as members of the <a href="AFC_West" title="wikilink">AFC West</a> in 1976. The following year, they were moved to the <a href="NFC_Central" title="wikilink">NFC Central</a>, while the other 1976 expansion team, the <a href="Seattle_Seahawks" title="wikilink">Seattle Seahawks</a>, switched conferences with Tampa Bay and joined the AFC West. This realignment was dictated by the league as part of the 1976 expansion plan, so that both teams could play each other twice and every other NFL franchise once during their first two seasons. Instead of a traditional division schedule of playing each division opponent twice, The Buccaneers played every conference team once, plus the Seahawks.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>The Tampa Bay expansion franchise was originally awarded to <a href="Thomas_McCloskey" title="wikilink">Tom McCloskey</a>, a construction company owner from <a href="Philadelphia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Philadelphia</a>. McCloskey soon entered a financial dispute with the NFL,<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> so the league found a replacement in <a href="Hugh_Culverhouse" title="wikilink">Hugh Culverhouse</a>, a wealthy <a href="tax_law" title="wikilink">tax attorney</a> from <a href="Jacksonville,_Florida" title="wikilink">Jacksonville</a> well known in NFL circles for brokering an unprecedented franchise swap between the <a href="Indianapolis_Colts" title="wikilink">Baltimore Colts</a> and <a href="St._Louis_Rams" title="wikilink">Los Angeles Rams</a>.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> A name-the-team contest resulted in the nickname &quot;Buccaneers&quot;, a reference to the pirate legends of Southwest Florida.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> The team's first home was <a href="Tampa_Stadium" title="wikilink">Tampa Stadium</a>, which had recently been expanded to seat just over 72,500 fans. <a href="Steve_Spurrier" title="wikilink">Steve Spurrier</a> was the quarterback for Tampa Bay during their <a href="1976_Tampa_Bay_Buccaneers_season" title="wikilink">expansion season</a>.</p>
<p>Tampa Bay did not win their first game until the 13th week of their <a href="1977_Tampa_Bay_Buccaneers_season" title="wikilink">second season</a>, starting with a record of 0–26 (though the Bucs had beaten the <a href="1976_Atlanta_Falcons_season" title="wikilink">Atlanta Falcons</a> 17–3 in a 1976 pre-season game before their first regular season).<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> Until the <a href="2008_Detroit_Lions_season" title="wikilink">Detroit Lions in 2008</a>, the 1976 Bucs held the dubious title as the least-winningest team in NFL history. Their losing streak caused them to become the butt of late-night television comedians' jokes.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> Their first win came in <a href="1977_NFL_season" title="wikilink">1977</a> on the road against the <a href="1977_New_Orleans_Saints_season" title="wikilink">New Orleans Saints</a>. Saints Head Coach <a href="Hank_Stram" title="wikilink">Hank Stram</a> was fired after losing to the Buccaneers. Tampa Bay only needed one more week to get their second win, a home win over the <a href="1977_St._Louis_Cardinals_(NFL)_season" title="wikilink">St. Louis Cardinals</a> in the 1977 season finale. The Cardinals also fired their coach, <a href="Don_Coryell" title="wikilink">Don Coryell</a>, shortly afterward.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> The team continued to improve in 1978, although injuries to several key players kept the team from achieving the winning record promised by McKay.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="section-1">1979–1982</h3>
<p>The Bucs' situation improved rapidly in . With the maturation of quarterback <a href="Doug_Williams_(American_football)" title="wikilink">Doug Williams</a>, the first 1000-yard rushing season from running back <a href="Ricky_Bell_(running_back)" title="wikilink">Ricky Bell</a>, and a smothering, league-leading defense led by future NFL <a href="Pro_Football_Hall_of_Fame" title="wikilink">Hall of Famer</a> <a href="Lee_Roy_Selmon" title="wikilink">Lee Roy Selmon</a>, the Bucs kicked off the season with five consecutive victories, a stunning performance that landed them on the cover of <em><a href="Sports_Illustrated" title="wikilink">Sports Illustrated</a>.</em><a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<p>With four games left in the season, the <a href="1979_Tampa_Bay_Buccaneers_season" title="wikilink">Bucs</a> needed to win only one of them to make the playoffs. In the first, <a href="STP_(motor_oil_company)" title="wikilink">STP</a> was put all over the goal posts in Tampa to prevent the goalposts from being ripped down in the event of a celebration. Four blocked kicks later, the Bucs wasted the oily substance, falling to the <a href="1979_Minnesota_Vikings_season" title="wikilink">Minnesota Vikings</a> 23–22. STP was wasted again the following week as the Bucs were shut out 14–0 by the <a href="1979_Chicago_Bears_season" title="wikilink">Chicago Bears</a>, and in <a href="O._J._Simpson" title="wikilink">O. J. Simpson</a>'s final home game in <a href="1979_San_Francisco_49ers_season" title="wikilink">San Francisco</a>, Tampa Bay lost its third straight attempt to clinch a division title against a 49ers team which came in with a 1–13 record. Clinch they did, however, in their final contest at home against the <a href="1979_Kansas_City_Chiefs_season" title="wikilink">Kansas City Chiefs</a>, which was played in the worst downpour in Bucs history. Finishing with a 10–6 record, the Bucs had their first winning season in franchise history, and also won the Central Division in a tiebreaker over the Chicago Bears. In an upset, the Bucs defeated the <a href="1979_Philadelphia_Eagles_season" title="wikilink">Philadelphia Eagles</a> 24–17 in the divisional round of the <a href="NFL_playoffs,_1979-80" title="wikilink">playoffs</a>.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> Because the <a href="1979_Los_Angeles_Rams_season" title="wikilink">Los Angeles Rams</a> defeated the <a href="1979_Dallas_Cowboys_season" title="wikilink">Dallas Cowboys</a> in the other NFC playoff game, the Bucs hosted the <a href="NFC_Championship_Game" title="wikilink">NFC Championship Game</a> the following week in Tampa. The Bucs lost to the Rams 9–0, thanks to great defense by the Rams. In their fourth season, the Bucs seemed on the verge of fulfilling McKay's five-year plan.</p>
<p>The <a href="1981_Tampa_Bay_Buccaneers_season" title="wikilink">Bucs</a> made the playoffs again by winning their division in the <a href="1981_NFL_season" title="wikilink">1981 season</a>. The 1981 season came down to a thrilling final game at <a href="1981_Detroit_Lions_season" title="wikilink">Detroit</a>. The winner would take the Central Division crown and the loser would miss the playoffs. The Lions had not lost at home all season. Although the Bucs trailed early, an 84-yard touchdown bomb from QB Williams to WR <a href="Kevin_House" title="wikilink">Kevin House</a> and a fumble recovery for a touchdown by DT <a href="David_Logan_(American_football)" title="wikilink">David Logan</a> sealed the shocking win for the Bucs. The <a href="1981_Dallas_Cowboys_season" title="wikilink">Dallas Cowboys</a> rewarded the Bucs' efforts with a 38–0 blowout in the divisional round of the playoffs.</p>
<p>The <a href="1982_NFL_season" title="wikilink">1982 season</a> started just as poorly for the <a href="1982_Tampa_Bay_Buccaneers_season" title="wikilink">Bucs</a>, as they went 0–3 before a <a href="1982_NFL_Players_Strike" title="wikilink">player's strike</a> shut down the NFL for seven weeks. When the league resumed play, the Bucs were nicknamed the &quot;Cardiac Kids&quot; for winning five of their next six games all in the final moments to go 5–4 and qualify for the expanded playoff slate. In the first round, the Bucs once again faced the <a href="1982_Dallas_Cowboys_season" title="wikilink">Cowboys</a> at home in Dallas, but the Bucs put up a much better fight, leading the game at the half. Tampa Bay lost 30–17.</p>
<p>1982 would be the last winning regular season under Culverhouse's ownership. Prior to the 1983 season, The Bucs failed to sign Doug Williams and allowed the quarterback to bolt to the <a href="United_States_Football_League" title="wikilink">United States Football League</a> (USFL) and immediately bottomed out at 2–14, starting a string of 14 consecutive losing seasons (with at least 10 losses during the first 12). Included in their misery was the drafting of <a href="Heisman_Trophy" title="wikilink">Heisman Trophy</a> winner <a href="Bo_Jackson" title="wikilink">Bo Jackson</a> with the first pick in the <a href="1986_NFL_Draft" title="wikilink">1986 draft</a>. Jackson never suited up for the Bucs, instead deciding to play baseball for the <a href="Kansas_City_Royals" title="wikilink">Kansas City Royals</a>. Jackson would later return for parts of football seasons with the <a href="Oakland_Raiders" title="wikilink">Los Angeles Raiders</a>.</p>
<h3 id="section-2">1996–2001</h3>
<p>Despite the profitability of the Buccaneers in the 1980s, Culverhouse's death revealed a team close to <a href="bankruptcy" class="uri" title="wikilink">bankruptcy</a>, which surprised many observers. His son, <a href="Miami" class="uri" title="wikilink">Miami</a> attorney <a href="Hugh_Culverhouse,_Jr." title="wikilink">Hugh Culverhouse, Jr.</a>, practically forced the trustees of his father's estate to sell the team, which cast doubt on the future of the franchise in Tampa. Interested parties included <a href="New_York_Yankees" title="wikilink">New York Yankees</a> owner <a href="George_Steinbrenner" title="wikilink">George Steinbrenner</a> and <a href="Baltimore_Orioles" title="wikilink">Baltimore Orioles</a> owner <a href="Peter_Angelos" title="wikilink">Peter Angelos</a>, the latter of whom publicly declared he would move the team to <a href="Baltimore" class="uri" title="wikilink">Baltimore</a>, as the city did not have an NFL franchise at that time. However, in a last-minute surprise, <a href="Malcolm_Glazer" title="wikilink">Malcolm Glazer</a> outbid both of them for $192 million, the highest sale price for a professional sports franchise up to that point. Glazer immediately placed his sons <a href="Bryan_Glazer" title="wikilink">Bryan</a>, <a href="Edward_Glazer" title="wikilink">Edward</a>, and <a href="Joel_Glazer" title="wikilink">Joel</a> in charge of the team's financial affairs, and the family's deep pockets and serious commitment to fielding a winning team&lt;U+2014&gt;in Tampa&lt;U+2014&gt;allowed the Bucs to finally become competitive. The team's performance dramatically improved when the Glazers hired Minnesota Vikings defensive coordinator <a href="Tony_Dungy" title="wikilink">Tony Dungy</a> as head coach, jettisoned the old uniform designs (see below), and convinced <a href="Hillsborough_County,_Florida" title="wikilink">Hillsborough County</a> voters to raise sales taxes to fund the construction of <a href="Raymond_James_Stadium" title="wikilink">Raymond James Stadium</a>.</p>
<p>During Dungy's first season in <a href="1996_NFL_season" title="wikilink">1996</a>, the <a href="1996_Tampa_Bay_Buccaneers_season" title="wikilink">team</a> continued to struggle, starting the season 1–8. But in the second half of the season they finished 5–2, primarily due to the performance of a defense ranked seventh in the NFL led by <a href="Hardy_Nickerson" title="wikilink">Hardy Nickerson</a> and the maturing of Wyche's draftees Brooks, Lynch, and Sapp. Dungy, a devout Christian with an even-tempered personality, quickly brought balance and morale to the team, and his <a href="American_football_strategy#Cover_2" title="wikilink">Cover 2</a> defensive scheme, sharpened to perfection by <a href="defensive_coordinator" title="wikilink">defensive coordinator</a> <a href="Monte_Kiffin" title="wikilink">Monte Kiffin</a> and linebackers coach <a href="Lovie_Smith" title="wikilink">Lovie Smith</a>, became the foundation for Tampa Bay's future success. Their version of Cover 2 was so successful that it became known as the <a href="Tampa_2" title="wikilink">Tampa 2</a>. It has been brought to the <a href="Chicago_Bears" title="wikilink">Chicago Bears</a> by Smith, <a href="Detroit_Lions" title="wikilink">Detroit Lions</a> by Rod Marinelli, <a href="Kansas_City_Chiefs" title="wikilink">Kansas City Chiefs</a> by Herman Edwards and to the <a href="Indianapolis_Colts" title="wikilink">Indianapolis Colts</a> by Dungy himself, and copied by several other teams.</p>
<p>The <a href="1997_Tampa_Bay_Buccaneers_season" title="wikilink">team</a> started the <a href="1997_NFL_season" title="wikilink">season</a> 5–0, picking up where they left off the previous year, and this quick start once again landed them on the cover of <em>Sports Illustrated</em>--not once, but twice.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a><a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> The Bucs went 10–6 for their first winning season and playoff appearance since 1982, as a wild-card team. In the Bucs' final home game at <a href="Houlihan&#39;s_Stadium" title="wikilink">Houlihan's Stadium</a> (formerly Tampa Stadium), the team defeated the <a href="1997_Detroit_Lions_season" title="wikilink">Detroit Lions</a> 20–10. They lost at <a href="Lambeau_Field" title="wikilink">Lambeau Field</a> to the eventual NFC Champion <a href="1997_Green_Bay_Packers_season" title="wikilink">Green Bay Packers</a> 21–7. Still, there was reason for optimism, and the expectations were high for the following season.</p>
<p>The <a href="1998_NFL_season" title="wikilink">1998 season</a>, the first to be played in the newly constructed <a href="Raymond_James_Stadium" title="wikilink">Raymond James Stadium</a>, saw the <a href="1998_Tampa_Bay_Buccaneers_season" title="wikilink">Bucs</a> lose several close games en route to a disappointing 8–8 record. The Bucs had to play the first 6 football games of the year (including preseason) on the road as the new stadium was not quite finished.</p>
<p>The <a href="1999_NFL_season" title="wikilink">1999 season</a> brought much better fortune. On the strength of the NFL's number 3 overall defense and a surprising performance by rookie QB <a href="Shaun_King" title="wikilink">Shaun King</a>, the <a href="1999_Tampa_Bay_Buccaneers_season" title="wikilink">Bucs</a> finished the season with an 11–5 record and won their third NFC Central Division Championship. They beat the <a href="1999_Washington_Redskins_season" title="wikilink">Washington Redskins</a> 14–13 in the Divisional round, before losing to the eventual Super Bowl Champion <a href="1999_St._Louis_Rams_season" title="wikilink">St. Louis Rams</a> in an unusually low-scoring NFC Championship Game, 11–6. The Bucs' loss was controversial, highlighted by the unusual reversal of a pass from King to WR <a href="Bert_Emanuel" title="wikilink">Bert Emanuel</a>, which ended the Bucs' chances at continuing their last-minute drive for a possible win. In league meetings later that year, NFL later changed the rules regarding what constituted an <a href="incomplete_pass" title="wikilink">incomplete pass</a>, which was considered a backhanded admission that the reversal was incorrect.</p>
<h3 id="super-bowl-champions">2002 - Super Bowl champions</h3>

<p>Dungy was released by the Buccaneers following a disappointing loss to the Philadelphia Eagles 31–9 in the Wildcard Round of 2001 and soon thereafter hired as the head coach of the <a href="Indianapolis_Colts" title="wikilink">Indianapolis Colts</a>, while the Bucs mounted a prolonged and much-maligned search for his replacement. Several potential candidates were offered the job, including <a href="University_of_Florida" title="wikilink">University of Florida</a> head coach <a href="Steve_Spurrier" title="wikilink">Steve Spurrier</a>, former <a href="New_York_Giants" title="wikilink">New York Giants</a> head coach <a href="Bill_Parcells" title="wikilink">Bill Parcells</a>, and Baltimore Ravens defensive coordinator <a href="Marvin_Lewis" title="wikilink">Marvin Lewis</a>. Spurrier jumped to the Redskins when he was offered the most lucrative salary package ever offered to an NFL head coach, and Parcells eventually passed on the Bucs' offer&lt;U+2014&gt;the second time he had done so in the history of the franchise. Bucs general manager Rich McKay threw his support behind Lewis. The Glazer brothers were so displeased with the selection of yet another defensive-minded coach that they overruled McKay and took control of the candidate search themselves. They made it clear that their top choice was <a href="Jon_Gruden" title="wikilink">Jon Gruden</a>. The problem was that he was still under contract to the <a href="Oakland_Raiders" title="wikilink">Oakland Raiders</a>.</p>
<p>While talks with the Raiders were secretly under way, the Glazers publicly pursued another respected offensive mind, <a href="San_Francisco_49ers" title="wikilink">San Francisco 49ers</a> head coach <a href="Steve_Mariucci" title="wikilink">Steve Mariucci</a>. Just when initial reports indicated that Mariucci had agreed to become both the Bucs' head coach and their general manager, Raiders owner <a href="Al_Davis" title="wikilink">Al Davis</a> agreed to release Jon Gruden to Tampa Bay.</p>
<p>The Glazers' shrewd move eventually paid off in acquiring Gruden, but it cost the team dearly. The team hired Gruden away from the Raiders on February 20, 2002, but the price was four <a href="Draft_(sports)" title="wikilink">draft</a> picks, including the Bucs' first and second round picks in 2002, their first round pick in 2003, and their second round selection in 2004, along with $8 million in cash; the league as a result prohibited any further trading of draft picks for coaches. Gruden was frustrated by the limitation of his coaching authority by Davis and was more than pleased to return to Tampa Bay. His parents lived in <a href="Carrollwood" class="uri" title="wikilink">Carrollwood</a>, and he had spent part of his childhood in Tampa in the early 1980s when his father was a running backs coach and later a scout for the Bucs.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<p>Upon his arrival in Tampa, Gruden immediately went to work, retooling a sluggish offense. The league's sweeping realignment sent the Bucs to the new NFC South Division, along with the <a href="Atlanta_Falcons" title="wikilink">Atlanta Falcons</a>, <a href="Carolina_Panthers" title="wikilink">Carolina Panthers</a> and <a href="New_Orleans_Saints" title="wikilink">New Orleans Saints</a>.</p>
<p>Led by the league's top defense, the 2002 campaign was the Buccaneers' most successful season to date. They won the NFC South title with the team's best ever record, 12-4, and went on to rout Gruden's former team, the <a href="Oakland_Raiders" title="wikilink">Oakland Raiders</a> who had the league's number 1 offense, by a score of 48-21 in <a href="Super_Bowl_XXXVII" title="wikilink">Super Bowl XXXVII</a>.</p>
<h3 id="section-3">2003–2008</h3>
<p>Soon after the Super Bowl victory, a growing number of press reports indicated Gruden's lack of patience with general manager McKay. McKay was a major architect of the Bucs' rebuilding effort over the previous ten years, and he, like Gruden, had long-established ties to the <a href="Tampa_Bay_area" title="wikilink">Tampa Bay area</a>. However, during the <a href="2003_NFL_season" title="wikilink">2003 season</a>, the Gruden-McKay relationship deteriorated as the Bucs struggled on the field. In November, <a href="Keyshawn_Johnson" title="wikilink">Keyshawn Johnson</a> was deactivated by the team ten games into the season for his conduct, which included sideline arguments with Bucs coaches and players. Johnson was eventually traded to the Dallas Cowboys for wide receiver <a href="Joey_Galloway" title="wikilink">Joey Galloway</a>.</p>
<p>In December, the Glazers allowed McKay to leave the Bucs before the end of the regular season, and he promptly joined the Falcons as president and general manager. Thus, McKay watched his first game as a Falcons executive sitting next to owner <a href="Arthur_Blank" title="wikilink">Arthur Blank</a> in a Raymond James Stadium skybox. The Falcons defeated the Bucs 30-28. The Bucs suffered a sluggish start and finished the season 7–9. With the Raiders' dismal 4–12 performance, neither Super Bowl team reached the playoffs that year.</p>
<p>For 2004, <a href="Bruce_Allen_(football)" title="wikilink">Bruce Allen</a> was hired as general manager. After Allen's arrival, both <a href="John_Lynch_(American_football)" title="wikilink">John Lynch</a> and <a href="Warren_Sapp" title="wikilink">Warren Sapp</a> were released, stunning many Buccaneer fans. The distracted Buccaneers began the 2004 season with a 1–5 record, their worst start under Gruden. The fading accuracy of <a href="placekicker" title="wikilink">kicker</a> <a href="Martin_Gramatica" title="wikilink">Martin Gramatica</a> did not help matters, as the team lost many close games en route to a 5–11 record.</p>
<p>In the 2005 season, the Buccaneers celebrated their 30th season in the league, and returned to their winning ways. The Bucs selected <a href="Cadillac_Williams" title="wikilink">Cadillac Williams</a> in the first round of the 2005 draft, and the rookie would provide a running game the Buccaneers had not possessed since the days of <a href="James_Wilder" title="wikilink">James Wilder</a> in the 1980s. After starting 5–1, the team entered a midseason slump hampered by a season-ending injury to starting QB <a href="Brian_Griese" title="wikilink">Brian Griese</a>. Replacement starter <a href="Chris_Simms" title="wikilink">Chris Simms</a> struggled early, but came into his own leading to the team to a last-minute win over the <a href="Washington_Redskins" title="wikilink">Redskins</a>. The Bucs won the NFC South Division finishing 11–5. The season ended abruptly, however, with a 17–10 loss in the Wild Card round, in a rematch with the Redskins.</p>
<p>After winning the division in 2005, the Bucs suffered through an abysmal 2006 season. The season was plagued by injuries, with starters such as guard <a href="Dan_Buenning" title="wikilink">Dan Buenning</a>, wide receiver <a href="Michael_Clayton_(football_player)" title="wikilink">Michael Clayton</a>, running back <a href="Carnell_&quot;Cadillac&quot;_Williams" title="wikilink">Carnell &quot;Cadillac&quot; Williams</a>, defensive end <a href="Simeon_Rice" title="wikilink">Simeon Rice</a>, corner back <a href="Brian_Kelly_(cornerback)" title="wikilink">Brian Kelly</a>, and quarterback <a href="Chris_Simms" title="wikilink">Chris Simms</a> all being placed on injured reserve at some point in the season. The season also saw a lot of rookies starting for the Bucs, such as quarterback <a href="Bruce_Gradkowski" title="wikilink">Bruce Gradkowski</a>, tackle <a href="Jeremy_Trueblood" title="wikilink">Jeremy Trueblood</a>, and guard <a href="Davin_Joseph" title="wikilink">Davin Joseph</a>.</p>
<p>The Bucs started off the season 0–3, with QB <a href="Chris_Simms" title="wikilink">Chris Simms</a> throwing only 1 touchdown to 7 interceptions. In the third game of the season, a last-minute loss to the <a href="Carolina_Panthers" title="wikilink">Panthers</a>, Simms's <a href="spleen" class="uri" title="wikilink">spleen</a> was ruptured, and he was placed on injured reserve for the balance of the season. After their bye week, the Bucs elected to start rookie quarterback <a href="Bruce_Gradkowski" title="wikilink">Bruce Gradkowski</a>, a 6th-round pick from Toledo. After nearly beating the <a href="New_Orleans_Saints" title="wikilink">Saints</a>, Gradkowski led the team to last-minute wins over the <a href="Cincinnati_Bengals" title="wikilink">Bengals</a> and <a href="Philadelphia_Eagles" title="wikilink">Eagles</a>. The success was short-lived, however, and the Bucs lost five of the next six games. <a href="Tim_Rattay" title="wikilink">Tim Rattay</a> replaced Gradkowski as quarterback late in the season, and the team finished 4–12. The aged defense, with 5 starters who had played there for a decade or more, was ranked 17th overall, the first time a Tampa defense was not ranked in the top ten since 1996.</p>
<p><img src="Buccaneers01.jpg" title="fig:|200px|Against the Jacksonville Jaguars at Raymond James Stadium" alt="|200px|Against the Jacksonville Jaguars at Raymond James Stadium" /> After a disappointing 4–12 effort in 2006, the Buccaneers for the first time in several seasons had money to spend in free agency. They brought in quarterback <a href="Jeff_Garcia" title="wikilink">Jeff Garcia</a>, offensive tackle <a href="Luke_Petitgout" title="wikilink">Luke Petitgout</a>, defensive end <a href="Kevin_Carter_(American_football)" title="wikilink">Kevin Carter</a>, and linebacker <a href="Cato_June" title="wikilink">Cato June</a>. On April 28, the Buccaneers drafted <a href="Clemson_University" title="wikilink">Clemson</a> defensive end <a href="Gaines_Adams" title="wikilink">Gaines Adams</a> with the 4th overall pick in the <a href="2007_NFL_Draft" title="wikilink">2007 NFL Draft</a>. After the draft the Buccaneers picked up tight end <a href="Jerramy_Stevens" title="wikilink">Jerramy Stevens</a> and defensive tackle <a href="Ryan_Sims" title="wikilink">Ryan Sims</a>.</p>
<p>The offseason changes resulted in the Buccaneers winning the NFC South title in the <a href="2007_NFL_season" title="wikilink">2007 season</a>, finishing with a 9–7 record, and the 4th seed in the NFC. The division crown was the second one in three seasons under Gruden. In the Wild Card round of the playoffs held on January 6, 2008, the Buccaneers lost to the eventual Super Bowl champion <a href="New_York_Giants" title="wikilink">New York Giants</a> by a final score of 24–14.</p>
<p>During the 2008 offseason, the Bucs re-signed head coach Jon Gruden and general manager Bruce Allen through the 2011 season. They also acquired former players <a href="Warrick_Dunn" title="wikilink">Warrick Dunn</a>, who had spent the last 6 seasons with the <a href="Atlanta_Falcons" title="wikilink">Atlanta Falcons</a>, and <a href="Brian_Griese" title="wikilink">Brian Griese</a> who was the starting quarterback for the team in 2005 until a knee injury sidelined him for the remainder of the year. <a href="Chris_Simms" title="wikilink">Chris Simms</a> was finally released, having not played in a game since his injury in 2006. The Bucs got off to a great start in , with a 9–3 record going into the final month of the season, tied for first place in the division, with a chance at the top seed in the conference. On December 2, it was announced that defensive coordinator <a href="Monte_Kiffin" title="wikilink">Monte Kiffin</a> would be leaving the team after the season's end, for the same job at the <a href="Tennessee_Volunteers_football" title="wikilink">University of Tennessee</a>, serving under his son <a href="Lane_Kiffin" title="wikilink">Lane Kiffin</a>, who had just been named the new head coach at the school. After the announcement, the Buccaneers would lose the final four games of the season to finish 9–7 for the second consecutive season. Unlike 2007, it was not enough to secure the division championship, nor a playoff appearance.</p>
<h3 id="section-4">2009</h3>

<p>In January 2009 the Buccaneers fired <a href="Jon_Gruden" title="wikilink">Jon Gruden</a> and made <a href="Raheem_Morris" title="wikilink">Raheem Morris</a> the head coach after having just named Morris the replacement of <a href="Monte_Kiffin" title="wikilink">Monte Kiffin</a> as defensive coordinator. <a href="Bruce_Allen" title="wikilink">Bruce Allen</a> was also let go, with <a href="Mark_Dominik" title="wikilink">Mark Dominik</a> his successor as general manager. On February 25, the Bucs released veterans <a href="Derrick_Brooks" title="wikilink">Derrick Brooks</a>, <a href="Warrick_Dunn" title="wikilink">Warrick Dunn</a>, <a href="Joey_Galloway" title="wikilink">Joey Galloway</a>, <a href="Ike_Hilliard" title="wikilink">Ike Hilliard</a>, <a href="Jeff_Garcia" title="wikilink">Jeff Garcia</a>, and <a href="Cato_June" title="wikilink">Cato June</a>.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> They traded for tight end <a href="Kellen_Winslow_Jr." title="wikilink">Kellen Winslow Jr.</a> on February 27 for two undisclosed draft picks. They signed running back <a href="Derrick_Ward" title="wikilink">Derrick Ward</a>, from the <a href="New_York_Giants" title="wikilink">New York Giants</a>, to a four-year, $17 million contract. They signed quarterback <a href="Byron_Leftwich" title="wikilink">Byron Leftwich</a> to a two-year deal. They drafted <a href="Kansas_State_Wildcats_football" title="wikilink">Kansas State</a> quarterback <a href="Josh_Freeman" title="wikilink">Josh Freeman</a> 17th overall in the first round of the <a href="2009_NFL_Draft" title="wikilink">2009 NFL Draft</a>.</p>
<h2 id="team-facilities">Team facilities</h2>
<p>In 1975, the Buccaneers built a small practice complex with offices near <a href="Tampa_International_Airport" title="wikilink">Tampa International Airport</a> called One Buccaneer Place. As other NFL teams upgraded their facilities, Bucs players and coaches stepped up their complaints about the aircraft noise, cramped offices, small locker rooms and run-down condition of One Buc Place. Even then-head coach Jon Gruden has sarcastically referred to the facility as &quot;The Woodshed.&quot; For much of the team's existence, the Bucs held training camp on the <a href="University_of_Tampa" title="wikilink">University of Tampa</a> campus, then at the expansive and better-equipped <a href="Disney&#39;s_Wide_World_of_Sports_Complex" title="wikilink">Disney's Wide World of Sports Complex</a> near Orlando (2002—2008).</p>
<p>In the second week of September 2007, statues of important figures from the Bucs 2002 Championship season were moved into the lobby area in an exhibit called &quot;<em>Moment of Victory</em>&quot;. The life-size statues included players <a href="Mike_Alstott" title="wikilink">Mike Alstott</a>, <a href="Ronde_Barber" title="wikilink">Ronde Barber</a>, <a href="Derrick_Brooks" title="wikilink">Derrick Brooks</a>, <a href="Brad_Johnson_(American_football)" title="wikilink">Brad Johnson</a>, <a href="John_Lynch_(American_football)" title="wikilink">John Lynch</a>, <a href="Shelton_Quarles" title="wikilink">Shelton Quarles</a>, <a href="Simeon_Rice" title="wikilink">Simeon Rice</a>, <a href="Warren_Sapp" title="wikilink">Warren Sapp</a>, and head coach <a href="Jon_Gruden" title="wikilink">Jon Gruden</a>. The statues are modeled after images from the sideline towards the end of <a href="Super_Bowl_XXXVII" title="wikilink">Super Bowl XXXVII</a>.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
<p>In August 2006, the Bucs unveiled their new training facility. Conveniently located across the street from <a href="Raymond_James_Stadium" title="wikilink">Raymond James Stadium</a> (on the former site of <a href="Tampa_Bay_Center" title="wikilink">Tampa Bay Center</a>), this state-of-the-art complex is the largest in the NFL. Its features inclue offices and meeting rooms, two natural grass practice fields, a theatre for meetings and press conferences, an expanded weight room, a giant kitchen, a rehabilitation center with three separate pools and a locker room twice the size of the former location. The building is capped off with a giant five-story glass and steel football as a key design element. A third practice field, featuring artificial turf, was also planned. In 2009, the team began holding training camp at the new upgraded facilities in Tampa.</p>
<p>Practices at the currently-unnamed facility will remain closed to the public, although the existing mall parking on the west side of the property is still available for use on game days. The facility is still referred to as <em>One Buc Place</em>, or sometimes by local media as <em>One Buc Palace</em>.</p>

<p>When the team began play in 1976, Culverhouse initially picked team colors of red, green, orange and white. However, the shade of green was too close to that used by the <a href="Miami_Dolphins" title="wikilink">Miami Dolphins</a>. A medium shade of &quot;Florida Orange&quot; was substituted for green. Home uniforms included orange jerseys with white numerals outlined in red&lt;U+2014&gt;the now-infamous &quot;<a href="Creamsicle" class="uri" title="wikilink">Creamsicle</a>&quot; uniforms. Road white jerseys originally had orange numerals outlined in red, but these colors were reversed for year two and beyond. The color swap provided better visibility, especially for television coverage purposes.</p>
<p>Long-time <a href="Tampa_Tribune" title="wikilink">Tampa Tribune</a> cartoonist and <a href="Ye_Mystic_Krewe_of_Gasparilla" title="wikilink">Ye Mystic Krewe of Gasparilla</a> member <a href="Lamar_Sparkman" title="wikilink">Lamar Sparkman</a> designed the first team logo.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> Faced with the difficulty of designing a logo that did not closely resemble that of the other &quot;pirates&quot; in the league, the <a href="Oakland_Raiders" title="wikilink">Oakland Raiders</a>, Sparkman came up with a pirate in a plumed hat and a <a href="dagger" class="uri" title="wikilink">dagger</a> in his mouth. The pirate appeared to be winking. He came to be known as &quot;Bruce the Buccaneer&quot; or &quot;Bucco Bruce.&quot; Sports writer and commentator Nick Bakay once said, that Bucco Bruce was a pirate who &quot;struck fear in the hearts of no one.&quot;</p>
<p>In 1992, the Buccaneers introduced orange pants to be worn with the white jerseys. Prior to the team's season finale in 1995 against the <a href="Detroit_Lions" title="wikilink">Lions</a>, lame-duck coach <a href="Sam_Wyche" title="wikilink">Sam Wyche</a> suggested that the Buccaneers wear the orange pants with their orange jerseys. The idea was vetoed by, among others, Pro Bowl linebacker <a href="Hardy_Nickerson" title="wikilink">Hardy Nickerson</a>.</p>
<p>For the 1993 season, in response to Culverhouse's passing, the Buccaneers added a commemorative patch to the right sleeve of their orange, away uniforms, which read, &quot;Mr C&quot; in cursive script.</p>
<h3 id="present">1997-present</h3>
<p>For the 1997 season, the Glazers worked with the NFL to develop a more marketable and intimidating look in order to improve the team's image. The Buccaneers changed their team colors to red, <a href="pewter" class="uri" title="wikilink">pewter</a>, black and orange. &quot;Bucco Bruce&quot; was replaced by a red flag displaying a white pirate skull and crossed <a href="sabre" title="wikilink">sabres</a> which is a modified <a href="Jolly_Roger" title="wikilink">Jolly Roger</a>. The flag was mounted on another sabre. The &quot;Buccaneers&quot; team name was written in a new font, <em>Totally Gothic</em>, and was either red with shadows of pewter or red and white. Orange pinstriping, and an orange football, was used to maintain a visual link to the former colors. <a href="Chris_Berman" title="wikilink">Chris Berman</a> nicknamed them &quot;the pirates in pewter pants,&quot; a play on the Gilbert and Sullivan opera <em><a href="The_Pirates_of_Penzance" title="wikilink">The Pirates of Penzance</a></em>. The Buccaneers planned to stage a ceremony in which Bruce was to <a href="walking_the_plank" title="wikilink">walk the plank</a> of a pirate ship in Tampa Bay, but he was pardoned at the last minute by Governor <a href="Lawton_Chiles" title="wikilink">Lawton Chiles</a>.</p>
<p>The new uniforms were adopted while <a href="Raymond_James_Stadium" title="wikilink">Raymond James Stadium</a> was still under construction, and the new colors would be prominent at the new facility.</p>
<p>The new uniforms provided a combination of either red or white jerseys with either pewter or white pants. The red-on-white combination has been used sparingly, but was brought back for a <em><a href="NBC_Sunday_Night_Football" title="wikilink">SNF</a></em> home game against the Seattle Seahawks in 2008; and it was worn again for a home game against the New Orleans Saints in 2009. In 2003, the Buccaneers introduced a practice jersey that featured orange piping. In 2004, a pewter practice jersey was used, with numerals in the <em>Totally Gothic</em> font.</p>
<p>Like many other NFL teams located in <a href="subtropical_climate" title="wikilink">subtropical climates</a>, the Buccaneers traditionally wear their white jerseys at home during the first half of the season — forcing opponents to suffer in the darker colors during the hot summers and autumns in Tampa. Additionally, the visitors' bench of <a href="Raymond_James_Stadium" title="wikilink">Raymond James Stadium</a> is located on the east side of the stadium, which is in direct sunlight for 1 p.m. eastern games. The west sideline is in the shade. In the 1980s and in 1996, the last year of the original uniforms, the Bucs generally wore white at home for the entire season including preseason. Since the new uniforms were adopted, the Bucs wear the red jerseys for the final four home games, and for nearly all night home games. In the preseason, the Bucs typically wear white for one of their two home games. The Bucs have worn their red jerseys for all home postseason games except for a January 6, 2008 playoff match against the New York Giants, where the Bucs wore white, as the temperature that day was unseasonably high.</p>
<p>The Buccaneers' 1997 uniform change prompted a 2003 lawsuit by the Raiders, who claimed that the NFL and the Buccaneers had infringed upon key <a href="trademark" class="uri" title="wikilink">trademark</a> elements of the Raiders' brand, including the Raiders' pirate logo. In the same suit, the Raiders challenged the Carolina Panthers' color scheme, which included silver and black. The Raiders wanted the courts to bar the Buccaneers and Panthers from wearing their uniforms while playing in California. However, since the lawsuit was filed in a state California court, the lawsuit was tossed out because only federal courts have jurisdiction on <a href="intellectual_property" title="wikilink">intellectual property</a> issues.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="throwback">Throwback</h3>
<p>Following the change in 1997, the Buccaneers did not wear the old uniform, even during popular league-sponsored &quot;<a href="Throwback_uniform" title="wikilink">throwback</a>&quot; weekends. Team merchandise in the old color scheme was also eliminated for several years. In 2008, the team revealed that they would be wearing the orange throwback uniforms for at least one game in the 2009 season.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> Their use were in conjunction with the creation of a Buccaneers <a href="Hall_of_fame" title="wikilink">Ring of Honor</a>, celebrating the 30th anniversary of the 1979 division championship team. Throwback merchandise went on sale in the summer of 2009, and referred to the orange color, not as &quot;Florida Orange,&quot; but as &quot;Orange Glaze.&quot; The orange, red and white uniforms with the stiletto-chewing pirate were worn against the Green Bay Packers on November 8, 2009 with the Bucs netting their first win of the season behind rookie quarterback <a href="Josh_Freeman" title="wikilink">Josh Freeman</a>.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a></p>

<h3 id="losing-streaks">Losing streaks</h3>
<p>The 1976 Buccaneers lost all 14 games during the regular season and 12 more the following season winning the last two games of the 1977 season for 26 straight losses. Even after the season expanded to 16 games in 1978, they remained the only NFL team in the modern era to experience a <a href="Imperfect_season" title="wikilink">winless regular season</a> until the <a href="Detroit_Lions" title="wikilink">Detroit Lions</a> went 0-16 in <a href="2008_Detroit_Lions_season" title="wikilink">2008</a>. A twenty-game road losing streak against AFC teams finally ended with a 17-10 victory over the Denver Broncos on December 26, 1993. In 1980 (against the <a href="Cincinnati_Bengals" title="wikilink">Bengals</a> at <a href="Riverfront_Stadium" title="wikilink">Riverfront Stadium</a>), the Buccaneers began a 27-game losing streak of games played outdoors on <a href="AstroTurf" class="uri" title="wikilink">AstroTurf</a>. It was not broken until 1995 when the team defeated the <a href="Philadelphia_Eagles" title="wikilink">Eagles</a> at <a href="Veterans_Stadium" title="wikilink">Veterans Stadium</a>. From their inception, they lost 20 consecutive games in which the <a href="temperature" class="uri" title="wikilink">temperature</a> at kickoff was below 40 &lt;U+00B0&gt;F (4 &lt;U+00B0&gt;C). The streak ended in the final week of the 2002 regular season, when they beat the <a href="Chicago_Bears" title="wikilink">Bears</a> at <a href="Memorial_Stadium_(Champaign)" title="wikilink">Champaign</a>.</p>
<h3 id="records">Records</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="Matt_Bryant" title="wikilink">Matt Bryant</a>'s 62-yard, game-winning field goal against the Eagles in  was the second-longest game-winning field goal in NFL history. The NFL record is 63 yards.</li>
<li>The Buccaneers are the first <a href="AFL-NFL_Merger" title="wikilink">post-merger</a> expansion team to win a division title, win a playoff game, and to host and play in a conference championship game. This was accomplished during the <a href="NFL_playoffs,_1979-80" title="wikilink">1979 season</a>.</li>
<li>Until December 16, 2007, the Buccaneers were the only NFL team to have never returned a kick-off for a touchdown during the regular season. This distinction ended when <a href="Micheal_Spurlock" title="wikilink">Micheal Spurlock</a> returned the 1,865th try 90 yards for the score during the week 15 game against the <a href="Atlanta_Falcons" title="wikilink">Atlanta Falcons</a>.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a></li>
<li>The Buccaneers hold several distinctive NFL defensive streaks set during a period from 1999-2003.
<ul>
<li>A record 69 consecutive games with at least one sack. The record (previously 68 by <a href="Dallas_Cowboys" title="wikilink">Dallas</a>) was broken on November 9, 2003 against <a href="Carolina_Panthers" title="wikilink">Carolina</a>.
