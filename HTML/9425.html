<h3 id="command-and-conquer-series"><em>Command and Conquer</em> series</h3>
<p>In 1994, Frank Klepacki met with Westwood Studios developers to discuss the soundtrack of the company's next project&lt;U+2014&gt;<em>Command &amp; Conquer</em>. To define the game's style, Klepacki listened to a number of bands, including <a href="Nine_Inch_Nails" title="wikilink">Nine Inch Nails</a> and <a href="Ministry_(band)" title="wikilink">Ministry</a>,<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a><a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> which would supply the iconic <a href="industrial_music" title="wikilink">industrial</a> style found in the majority of the songs. He combined various elements of this music and added his own touch to create a unique sound. With the company's recent shift to 22 <a href="Hertz" title="wikilink">kHz</a> audio, Klepacki composed with an ASR-10 sampler, a <a href="Roland_Corporation" title="wikilink">Roland</a> S760 sampler, a Roland JD 990 synth module, and an <a href="electric_guitar" title="wikilink">electric guitar</a>.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> The first few songs he composed for <em>Command &amp; Conquer</em> contained voice samples&lt;U+2014&gt;including the notable pieces <em>Act on Instinct</em> and <em>No Mercy</em> (which featured wild declarations from <em><a href="Bill_&amp;_Ted&#39;s_Bogus_Journey" title="wikilink">Bill &amp; Ted's Bogus Journey</a></em>). The samples were later found to interfere with the game's spoken audio, and were replaced with versions lacking the voices, although the original versions (and several other unused pieces) can still be found on the DOS <em>C&amp;C</em> and <em>Covert Operations</em> discs. Complete versions of the songs later appeared on the game's commercial soundtrack.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> He would continue to sample clips from film and other media throughout his career, using a quote from <em><a href="The_Brain_from_Planet_Arous" title="wikilink">The Brain from Planet Arous</a></em> in the <em>Yuri</em> song <em>Brainfreeze</em>, for example. Klepacki next composed instrumental pieces for <em>Command &amp; Conquer</em>, drawing influences from <a href="orchestra" title="wikilink">orchestral</a>, <a href="house_music" title="wikilink">house</a>, <a href="heavy_metal_music" title="wikilink">heavy metal</a>, and <a href="hip_hop_music" title="wikilink">hip hop music</a>. For the <a href="credit_(creative_arts)" title="wikilink">credits</a>, Klepacki wrote <em>Airstrike</em>, featuring a hook later used in <em><a href="Command_&amp;_Conquer:_Tiberian_Sun" title="wikilink">Command &amp; Conquer: Tiberian Sun</a></em> for the <a href="Global_Defense_Initiative" title="wikilink">Global Defense Initiative</a>. Conversely, the <a href="Brotherhood_of_Nod" title="wikilink">Brotherhood of Nod</a> ending used the song <em>Destructible Times</em> written by Klepacki's local band, <a href="I_AM_(band)" title="wikilink">I AM</a>. Developers requested the song because it &quot;reflected the war aspect and bad-ass vibe of Nod's side.&quot;<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> The <em>C&amp;C</em> expansion pack <em>The Covert Operations</em> featured seven new <a href="ambient_music" title="wikilink">ambient</a> pieces, all of which were also included on the disc in high quality <a href="Red_Book_(audio_CD_standard)" title="wikilink">CD Audio</a> format.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> Though the soundtrack was not released through retail, Westwood sold it by special order through its website and in game catalogues.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a></p>
<p>While working on <em>Covert Operations</em>, Frank Klepacki composed <em>Hell March</em> from the idea of &quot;a rock tune to marching boots,&quot; finishing the song in one day after inventing the guitar riff.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> Upon listening, director <a href="Brett_Sperry" title="wikilink">Brett Sperry</a> insisted this song be used as the signature theme of <em>Command &amp; Conquer: Red Alert.</em><a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> Originally intended for use with the Brotherhood of Nod, it features militaristic samples&lt;U+2014&gt;including marching, industrial sounds, and a commander shouting orders. Klepacki initially scored <em>Red Alert</em> with sci-fi camp in mind, but early songs were shelved. He switched gears to write gritty pieces, prompting the <em>Red Alert</em> team to expand upon the style of <em>Command &amp; Conquer</em>.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> In preparing to compose, Klepacki acquired new sample libraries for unique and strange sounds. Particular creative moods would result in a few songs at a time. He first wrote heavy songs like <em>Workmen</em> and <em>Crush</em>, then composed neutral, synthesizer-laden music, such as <em>Vector</em> and <em>Roll Out</em>. Klepacki scored <em>Fogger</em> and <em>Mud</em>, one of his personal favorites, before finishing with <em>Militant Force</em> and <em>Radio 2</em>. He took breaks from working to make cameo appearances as a Soviet soldier killed by <a href="Kane_(Command_&amp;_Conquer)" title="wikilink">Kane</a> and an Allied commander in the <a href="cut_scene" title="wikilink">cut scenes</a> of <em>Red Alert</em>. He previously appeared as a <a href="Brotherhood_of_Nod" title="wikilink">Nod</a> soldier and the voice of the commando in <em>Command &amp; Conquer</em> and would voice bit parts in future Westwood games.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a></p>

<p>After completing <em>Red Alert</em>, he took a short break to review his work. He concluded that some songs could be enhanced, but <em>Red Alert</em> had already gone <a href="Development_stage#Gold/general_availability_release" title="wikilink">gold</a>, precluding new versions.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> These remixes later appeared on the unsuccessful <em>Command &amp; Conquer: Sole Survivor</em>. <em>Red Alert</em>{{'}}s soundtrack was voted best video game soundtrack of 1996 by <em><a href="PC_Gamer" title="wikilink">PC Gamer</a></em> and ''Gameslice ''magazines, defeating <a href="Trent_Reznor" title="wikilink">Trent Reznor</a>'s score for <em><a href="Quake_(video_game)" title="wikilink">Quake</a></em>.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a><a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> Reviewers called it &quot;fun to listen to&quot; and &quot;second to none.&quot;<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> As of 2005, <em>Red Alert</em> was listed in the <em><a href="Guinness_Book_of_World_Records" title="wikilink">Guinness Book of World Records</a></em> for selling several million units, bringing Klepacki his widest audience.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> He wrote additional music for the game's <a href="expansion_pack" title="wikilink">expansion packs</a>, <em>Counterstrike</em> and <em>Aftermath</em>. He attributed the success of <em>Red Alert</em> to an infusion of modern styles not found in other games.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> Klepacki initially wrote off the popularity of his music, assuming that his music &quot;must only appeal to die-hards.&quot;<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> He considered it &quot;very surreal&quot; to realize his soundtracks had gained notoriety, and has since embraced his fans and critics.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a></p>

<p>In 1997, Frank Klepacki scored a <em><a href="Blade_Runner" title="wikilink">Blade Runner</a></em> adaptation. Though Westwood acquired the rights to use the original film score by <a href="Vangelis" class="uri" title="wikilink">Vangelis</a>, the company was not allowed access to the original master recordings, and Klepacki had to recreate the themes by ear.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> Developers were satisfied by his attention to detail, feeling that his digital recreations sounded clearer than the originals.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> In 1998, Klepacki composed for <em><a href="Dune_2000" title="wikilink">Dune 2000</a></em>. He attempted to update the music from <em><a href="Dune_II" title="wikilink">Dune II</a></em> into &quot;this non-blip stuff,&quot; and worked in homages to the original style of the films as composed by <a href="Toto_(band)" title="wikilink">Toto</a>.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a><a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> <em>Dune 2000</em> was panned by critics, though Klepacki's score was praised for adhering to the traditional <em>Dune</em> style.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a> Klepacki considered <em>2000</em> to be a more definitive work than <em>Dune 2</em>, which was constrained by software and hardware limitations.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a> He composed for <em><a href="Command_&amp;_Conquer:_Tiberian_Sun" title="wikilink">Command &amp; Conquer: Tiberian Sun</a></em> with <a href="Jarrid_Mendelson" title="wikilink">Jarrid Mendelson</a>&lt;U+2014&gt;with whom he would later collaborate on <em><a href="Emperor:_Battle_for_Dune" title="wikilink">Emperor: Battle for Dune</a></em>.<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a> He began by writing <em>Stomp</em>, an energetic rock piece intended to recreate the effect of <em>Hell March</em> for the new game.<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a> Coincidentally, one of the trailers for Command and Conquer 3 featured 'Stomp' as the soundtrack. Westwood instead wanted <em>Tiberian Sun</em> to feature darker, more moody music, and <em>Stomp</em> was shelved in favor of the current sound. Bereft of ideas due to the stark change in direction, Klepacki asked Mendelson to collaborate; he regards tracks they both worked on as the best. <em>Tiberian Sun</em> ultimately featured dark, ambient <a href="techno_music" title="wikilink">techno music</a> and ambient space music suited to the game's post-apocalyptic and futuristic setting.<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a> Klepacki cited the piece &quot;Mad Rap&quot; as his favorite. An avid <em><a href="Star_Wars" title="wikilink">Star Wars</a></em> fan, he enjoyed scoring <a href="cut_scenes" title="wikilink">cut scenes</a> featuring <a href="James_Earl_Jones" title="wikilink">James Earl Jones</a>, the voice of <a href="Darth_Vader" title="wikilink">Darth Vader</a>.<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a> The scenes also allowed him to integrate the <em>Airstrike</em> and <em>No Mercy</em> themes into the game's score despite the aforementioned shift.<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a> With the expansion pack <em>Firestorm</em>, he attempted to &quot;set things right&quot; by writing more upbeat songs and including <em>Stomp</em>, which would also appear in <em>Command &amp; Conquer: Renegade</em>.<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a></p>
<p>He next scored <em><a href="Lands_of_Lore" title="wikilink">Lands of Lore</a> III</em> and <em><a href="Command_&amp;_Conquer:_Red_Alert_2" title="wikilink">Command &amp; Conquer: Red Alert 2</a></em>.

<p>As audio director, Klepacki also created many sound effects for <em>Universe at War</em>. For the alien Hierarchy, he cultivated an &quot;unnatural&quot; aesthetic through an &quot;arsenal of mangled noises&quot;.<a href="#fn95" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref95"><sup>95</sup></a> Klepacki used a &quot;combination of heavy cranes recorded with overdriven impacts&quot; to give the faction's walkers a &quot;menacing machinelike breathing sound&quot;, and made up his own language to record &quot;various grunts, growls, mannerisms, and strange vocalizations.<a href="#fn96" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref96"><sup>96</sup></a> Since Hierarchy heroes needed to communicate to the player in English, Klepacki engineered dialogue to seem as if the aliens were &quot;telepathically speaking to you, with a back-masking effect on their voices...as if the words are being channeled straight to your brain&quot;.<a href="#fn97" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref97"><sup>97</sup></a> The Novus effects were usually <a href="phaser_(effect)" title="wikilink">phased</a> and involved &quot;mechanical movement, electricity, and metal sounds&quot;. He invented yet another language for two characters Viktor and Mirabel, who occasionally speak to one another. Lastly, he drew on weather and other natural sounds for the Masari, describing their ambience as having &quot;more weight, thunder, heavy bass rumblings, vortex gusts...&quot;<a href="#fn98" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref98"><sup>98</sup></a> Klepacki directed the voice-acting to have a &quot;noble and strong&quot; feel without appearing typically medieval or overly dramatic.<a href="#fn99" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref99"><sup>99</sup></a> He ultimately felt he did the work of &quot;three people&quot; with <em>Universe at War</em>, as the game's audio requirements changed constantly, requiring vigilance and programmer support.<a href="#fn100" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref100"><sup>100</sup></a> <em>Divine Intervention</em> was later nominated for a <em>Game Audio Network Guild</em> award, and the soundtrack was released as a free download after Petroglyph's efforts toward a traditional release were frustrated.<a href="#fn101" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref101"><sup>101</sup></a><a href="#fn102" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref102"><sup>102</sup></a></p>

These sentiments were echoed in a special feature on the band <a href="Home_Cookin&#39;_(band)" title="wikilink">Home Cookin'</a> in 2000&lt;U+2014&gt;Klepacki said the group wanted to &quot;work with a label, not for them.&quot;<a href="#fn162" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref162"><sup>162</sup></a> Stating that he would not compromise his work for popularity, he believes that &quot;the only artists that have any longevity are the ones that pioneer a movement&lt;U+2014&gt;not follow one.&quot;<a href="#fn163" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref163"><sup>163</sup></a> He enjoys working independently, as he does not have to &quot;change...music for the sake of pop radio.&quot;<a href="#fn164" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref164"><sup>164</sup></a> He champions the internet as a medium through which creative and original artists can be found. Klepacki believes it is the preferred avenue for music when compared to radio <a href="airplay_(song)" title="wikilink">airplay</a>&lt;U+2014&gt;where one hears &quot;the exact same songs 3 months at a time.&quot;<a href="#fn165" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref165"><sup>165</sup></a> When interviewed about file-sharing, he expressed mixed emotions.<a href="#fn166" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref166"><sup>166</sup></a> Holding that <a href="compact_disc" title="wikilink">compact discs</a> are &quot;just too damn expensive&quot;, Klepacki believes that a few dollars' reduction in price would &quot;deter people from downloading for free.&quot;<a href="#fn167" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref167"><sup>167</sup></a> Conversely, he notes that artists&lt;U+2014&gt;who &quot;don't get as much money as you think&quot;&lt;U+2014&gt;need to be compensated for their work.<a href="#fn168" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref168"><sup>168</sup></a> His favorite artists by decade, starting with the 1960s, are <a href="Sly_and_the_Family_Stone" title="wikilink">Sly and the Family Stone</a>, <a href="Graham_Central_Station" title="wikilink">Graham Central Station</a>, <a href="Metallica" class="uri" title="wikilink">Metallica</a>, <a href="Home_Cookin&#39;_(band)" title="wikilink">Home Cookin'</a>, and <a href="Bob_Schneider" title="wikilink">Bob Schneider</a>.<a href="#fn169" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref169"><sup>169</sup></a></p>
