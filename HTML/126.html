<h2 id="early-history-1877u20131929">Early history (1877&lt;U+2013&gt;1929)</h2>
<p><a href="Bolton_Wanderers_F.C." title="wikilink">Bolton Wanderers F.C.</a> was founded by the Reverend Thomas Ogden, the schoolmaster at Christ Church in 1874 as Christ Church F.C.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> It was initially run from the church of the same name on Deane Road, Bolton, on the site where the Innovation factory of the <a href="University_of_Bolton" title="wikilink">University of Bolton</a> now stands. The club left the location following a dispute with the vicar, and changed its name to Bolton Wanderers in 1877. The name was chosen as the club initially had a lot of difficulty finding a permanent ground to play on, having used three venues in its first four years of existence.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>In the <a href="1887&lt;U+2013&gt;88_FA_Cup" title="wikilink">1887&lt;U+2013&gt;88 FA Cup</a>, Bolton Wanderers were involved in a protracted first round match against <a href="Everton_F.C." title="wikilink">Everton</a>. Welsh international <a href="Robert_Roberts_(footballer_born_1864)" title="wikilink">Bob Roberts</a> scored the only goal of the initial match played on 15 October 1887, but the result was declared invalid as Bolton Wanderers had fielded an ineligible player, Robert Struthers.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> There then followed two drawn matches (with Roberts again scoring in the first), before Everton won the second replay (the fourth match altogether) 2&lt;U+2013&gt;1.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> This time, however, Everton were disqualified for fielding two professional players who had been registered as amateurs,<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> and the match was awarded to Bolton, who then suffered a club record 9&lt;U+2013&gt;1 defeat in the second round away to <a href="Preston_North_End_F.C." title="wikilink">Preston North End</a>.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p>Bolton were one of the 12 founder members of the <a href="Football_League" title="wikilink">Football League</a>, which formed in 1888.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> Having remained in the Football League since its formation, Bolton have spent more time in the top flight (<a href="Premier_League" title="wikilink">Premier League</a>/old <a href="Football_League_First_Division" title="wikilink">First Division</a>) than out of it. <img src="White_Horse_Final.jpg" title="fig:Bolton won the celebrated 1923 FA Cup Final" alt="Bolton won the celebrated 1923 FA Cup Final" /> <img src="Bolton_Wanderers_FC_league_results_1889-2008.PNG" title="fig:Chart showing the progress of Bolton Wanderers F.C. through the English football league system from the inaugural season in 1888&lt;U+2013&gt;89 to 2007&lt;U+2013&gt;08 when Bolton came sixteenth in the Premier League." alt="Chart showing the progress of Bolton Wanderers F.C. through the English football league system from the inaugural season in 1888&lt;U+2013&gt;89 to 2007&lt;U+2013&gt;08 when Bolton came sixteenth in the Premier League." /> In 1894 Bolton reached the final of the FA Cup for the first time, but <a href="1894_FA_Cup_Final" title="wikilink">lost 4&lt;U+2013&gt;1</a> to <a href="Notts_County_F.C." title="wikilink">Notts County</a> at <a href="Goodison_Park" title="wikilink">Goodison Park</a>.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> A decade later they were runners-up a second time, <a href="1904_FA_Cup_Final" title="wikilink">losing 1&lt;U+2013&gt;0</a> to local rivals <a href="Manchester_City_F.C." title="wikilink">Manchester City</a> at <a href="Crystal_Palace_National_Sports_Centre" title="wikilink">Crystal Palace</a> on 23 April 1904.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<p>The period before and after the <a href="First_World_War" title="wikilink">First World War</a> was Bolton's most consistent period of top-flight success as measured by league finishes, with the club finishing outside the top 8 of the <a href="Football_League_First_Division" title="wikilink">First Division</a> on only two occasions between <a href="1911&lt;U+2013&gt;12_in_English_football" title="wikilink">1911&lt;U+2013&gt;12</a> and <a href="1927&lt;U+2013&gt;28_in_English_football" title="wikilink">1927&lt;U+2013&gt;28</a>.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> In this period Bolton equalled their record finish of third twice, in <a href="1920&lt;U+2013&gt;21_in_English_football" title="wikilink">1920&lt;U+2013&gt;21</a> and <a href="1924&lt;U+2013&gt;25_in_English_football" title="wikilink">1924&lt;U+2013&gt;25</a>, on the latter occasion missing out on the title by just 3 points (in an era of 2 points for a win).<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<p>On 28 April 1923, Bolton won the cup at their third attempt to win their first major trophy, beating <a href="West_Ham_United_F.C." title="wikilink">West Ham United</a> 2&lt;U+2013&gt;0 in the first ever <a href="Wembley_Stadium_(1923)" title="wikilink">Wembley</a> final. The match, famously known as <a href="1923_FA_Cup_Final" title="wikilink">The White Horse Final</a> was played in front of over 127,000 supporters. Bolton's centre-forward, <a href="David_Jack" title="wikilink">David Jack</a> scored the first ever goal at Wembley Stadium.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> Driven by long-term players <a href="Joe_Smith_(football_forward_born_1889)" title="wikilink">Joe Smith</a> in attack, <a href="Ted_Vizard" title="wikilink">Ted Vizard</a> and <a href="Billy_Butler_(footballer)" title="wikilink">Billy Butler</a> on the wings, and <a href="Jimmy_Seddon" title="wikilink">Jimmy Seddon</a> in defence, they became the most successful cup side of the twenties, also winning in <a href="1926_FA_Cup_Final" title="wikilink">1926</a> and <a href="1929_FA_Cup_Final" title="wikilink">1929</a>, beating Manchester City<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> and <a href="Portsmouth_F.C." title="wikilink">Portsmouth</a> respectively.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>

<p>From 1935 to 1964, Bolton enjoyed an uninterrupted stay in the top flight &lt;U+2013&gt; regarded by fans as a golden era &lt;U+2013&gt; spearheaded in the 1950s by <a href="Nat_Lofthouse" title="wikilink">Nat Lofthouse</a>. The years of the <a href="Second_World_War" title="wikilink">Second World War</a> saw most of the Wanderers' playing staff see action on the front, a rare occurrence within elite football, as top sportsmen were generally assigned to physical training assignments, away from enemy fire. As it is, no less than 15 Bolton professionals, led by their captain <a href="Harry_Goslin" title="wikilink">Harry Goslin</a>, volunteered for active service in 1939, and were enlisted in the 53rd Bolton Artillery regiment.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> By the end of the war, 32 of the 35 pre-war professionals saw action in the British forces. The sole fatality was Goslin, who had by then risen to the rank of Lieutenant and was killed by shrapnel on the Italian front shortly before Christmas 1943. 53rd Bolton Artillery took part in the <a href="Battle_of_Dunkirk" title="wikilink">Battle of Dunkirk</a> and also served in the campaigns of Egypt, Iraq and Italy.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> Remarkably, a number of these soldiers managed to carry on playing the game in these theatres of war, taking on as 'British XI' various scratch teams assembled by, among others, <a href="Farouk_of_Egypt" title="wikilink">King Faruk of Egypt</a> in Cairo and Polish forces in Baghdad.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
<p>On 9 March 1946, the club's home was the scene of the <a href="Burnden_Park_disaster" title="wikilink">Burnden Park disaster</a>, which at the time was the worst tragedy in British <a href="Association_football" title="wikilink">football</a> history. 33 Bolton Wanderers fans were crushed to death, and another 400 injured, in an <a href="FA_Cup" title="wikilink">FA Cup</a> quarter-final second leg tie between Bolton and <a href="Stoke_City_F.C." title="wikilink">Stoke City</a>.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> There was an estimated 85,000 strong crowd crammed in for the game, at least 15,000 over-capacity. The disaster led to <a href="Ronw_Moelwyn_Hughes" title="wikilink">Moelwyn Hughes</a>'s official report, which recommended more rigorous control of crowd sizes.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1953 Bolton played in one of the most famous FA Cup finals of all time &lt;U+2013&gt; <a href="1953_FA_Cup_Final" title="wikilink">The Stanley Matthews Final</a> of 1953. Bolton lost the game to <a href="Blackpool_F.C." title="wikilink">Blackpool</a> 4&lt;U+2013&gt;3 after gaining a 3&lt;U+2013&gt;1 lead. Blackpool were victorious thanks to the skills of <a href="Stanley_Matthews" title="wikilink">Matthews</a> and the goals of <a href="Stan_Mortensen" title="wikilink">Stan Mortensen</a>.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>
<p>Bolton Wanderers have not won a major trophy since 1958, when two Lofthouse goals saw them overcome <a href="Manchester_United_F.C." title="wikilink">Manchester United</a> in the <a href="1958_FA_Cup_Final" title="wikilink">FA Cup final</a> in front of a 100,000 crowd at Wembley Stadium.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> The closest they have come to winning a major trophy since then is finishing runners-up in the <a href="Football_League_Cup" title="wikilink">League Cup</a>, first in 1995 and again in 2004.</p>
<h2 id="few-highs-and-many-lows-1958u20131995">Few highs and many lows (1958&lt;U+2013&gt;1995)</h2>
<p>Hopes were high at Burnden Park in May 1978 when Bolton sealed the Second Division title and gained promotion to the First Division. However, they only remained there for two seasons before being relegated.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a></p>
<p>Following relegation in 1980, Bolton signed former Manchester United <a href="European_Cup" title="wikilink">European Cup</a> winning striker <a href="Brian_Kidd" title="wikilink">Brian Kidd</a> from Everton for &lt;U+00A3&gt;110,000<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> as they prepared to challenge for a quick return to the First Division. Kidd scored a hat-trick in his third game for Bolton, a 4&lt;U+2013&gt;0 win over <a href="Newcastle_United_F.C." title="wikilink">Newcastle United</a> in the league, but the rest of the season was a struggle as Bolton failed to finish anywhere near the promotion places. Manager <a href="Stan_Anderson" title="wikilink">Stan Anderson</a> was sacked at <a href="1980&lt;U+2013&gt;81_in_English_football" title="wikilink">end of the season</a> and replaced by coach <a href="George_Mulhall" title="wikilink">George Mulhall</a>.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> By the end of the <a href="1981&lt;U+2013&gt;82_in_English_football" title="wikilink">1981&lt;U+2013&gt;82 season</a>, Bolton were no closer to promotion and had lost several key players including <a href="Peter_Reid" title="wikilink">Peter Reid</a> and <a href="Neil_Whatmore" title="wikilink">Neil Whatmore</a>. There were then rumours that Brazilian legend <a href="Pel&lt;U+00E9&gt;" class="uri" title="wikilink">Pel&lt;U+00E9&gt;</a> would be appointed to take over from George Mulhall as manager, but the job went to <a href="John_McGovern_(footballer)" title="wikilink">John McGovern</a> (a European Cup winner with Nottingham Forest) who became Bolton's first player-manager.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a></p>
<p>However, the appointment of McGovern as manager was not the turning point that everyone at Burnden Park had hoped it would be, and in 1983 Bolton were relegated to the Third Division after losing 4&lt;U+2013&gt;1 at <a href="Charlton_Athletic_F.C." title="wikilink">Charlton Athletic</a> on the final day of the season.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a></p>
<p>McGovern remained in charge for the <a href="1983&lt;U+2013&gt;84_in_English_football" title="wikilink">1983&lt;U+2013&gt;84 season</a>, and for a while it looked as though he was the man to turn things around as his predominantly young team did well in the Third Division. An 8&lt;U+2013&gt;1 win over <a href="Walsall_F.C." title="wikilink">Walsall</a> that season was Bolton's best league win for 50 years, but in the end Bolton failed to win promotion. McGovern then made way for new manager <a href="Charlie_Wright" title="wikilink">Charlie Wright</a>, who remained in charge until December 1985.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a></p>
<p>At the end of the <a href="1986&lt;U+2013&gt;87_in_English_football" title="wikilink">1986&lt;U+2013&gt;87 season</a>, Bolton Wanderers suffered relegation to the Fourth Division for the first time in their history. But the board kept faith in manager <a href="Phil_Neal" title="wikilink">Phil Neal</a> (who was appointed in December 1985) and they won promotion back to the Third Division at the first attempt. The deciding goal was scored by <a href="Robbie_Savage_(footballer_born_1960)" title="wikilink">Robbie Savage</a> in a thrilling 1&lt;U+2013&gt;0 win at Wrexham. Wrexham missed a penalty in the opening 30 minutes and both teams squandered a succession of chances. Bolton's Robbie Savage hit the post from a free kick before the referee blew the final whistle. It was during Neal's reign at manager that Nat Lofthouse was appointed lifetime President of the football club. Neal won the <a href="Football_League_Trophy" title="wikilink">Sherpa Van Trophy</a> in 1989 and remained in charge until the summer of 1992 when he made way for <a href="Bruce_Rioch" title="wikilink">Bruce Rioch</a>, who a few years earlier had won two successive promotions with <a href="Middlesbrough_F.C." title="wikilink">Middlesbrough</a>. His penultimate season (<a href="1990&lt;U+2013&gt;91_in_English_football" title="wikilink">1990&lt;U+2013&gt;91</a>) saw Bolton pipped to the final automatic promotion place by <a href="Southend_United_F.C." title="wikilink">Southend United</a> and lose to <a href="Tranmere_Rovers_F.C." title="wikilink">Tranmere Rovers</a> in the playoff final, but his final season saw them finish a disappointing 13th.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a></p>
<p>In the early part of Rioch's tenure, Bolton gained a giantkilling reputation in cup competitions. In 1993 Bolton beat FA Cup holders <a href="Liverpool_F.C." title="wikilink">Liverpool</a> 2&lt;U+2013&gt;0 in a third round replay at <a href="Anfield" class="uri" title="wikilink">Anfield</a>, thanks to goals from <a href="John_McGinlay" title="wikilink">John McGinlay</a> and <a href="Andy_Walker_(footballer_born_1965)" title="wikilink">Andy Walker</a>. The club also defeated higher division opposition in the form of Wolves (2&lt;U+2013&gt;1) that year before bowing out to Derby County (3&lt;U+2013&gt;1). Bolton also secured promotion to the second tier for the first time since 1983. In 1994 Bolton beat FA Cup holders <a href="Arsenal_F.C." title="wikilink">Arsenal</a> 3&lt;U+2013&gt;1 after extra time in a fourth round replay, and went on to reach the quarter-finals, bowing out 1&lt;U+2013&gt;0 at home to local rivals (and then Premier League) <a href="Oldham_Athletic_A.F.C." title="wikilink">Oldham Athletic</a>. Bolton also defeated top division opposition in the form of Everton (3&lt;U+2013&gt;2) and Aston Villa (1&lt;U+2013&gt;0) that year.</p>

<p>Bolton reached the Premiership in 1995 under the management of Rioch, thanks to a victory over Reading in the Division One playoff final. Rioch, who also led Bolton to the League Cup Final in 1995, a 2&lt;U+2013&gt;1 defeat by Liverpool, left to take charge at Arsenal after the promotion success and was replaced by <a href="Roy_McFarland" title="wikilink">Roy McFarland</a>, who was joined by Rioch's assistant <a href="Colin_Todd" title="wikilink">Colin Todd</a> as joint manager. Bolton were bottom for virtually all of the <a href="1995&lt;U+2013&gt;96_in_English_football" title="wikilink">1995&lt;U+2013&gt;96</a> Premiership campaign and Bolton dismissed McFarland on New Year's Day 1996 and appointed Todd in his place. Todd was unable to save Bolton from relegation as they lost their penultimate game 1&lt;U+2013&gt;0 to <a href="Southampton_F.C." title="wikilink">Southampton</a>, but the Bolton board kept faith in him. The Bolton board's loyalty in Todd was rewarded when they won promotion back to the Premiership at the first attempt thanks to a season in which they achieved 98 league points and 100 goals in the process of securing the Division One championship, the first time since 1978 that they had finished top of any division. This season also marked the club's departure from Burnden Park to the Reebok Stadium, the last game at the stadium being a 4&lt;U+2013&gt;1 win over <a href="Charlton_Athletic_F.C." title="wikilink">Charlton Athletic</a>.John Mcginley scored the final goal at burnden park.</p>

After gaining only one league win in eleven matches, Lee left Bolton in October 2007<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> and was replaced by <a href="Gary_Megson" title="wikilink">Gary Megson</a>.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a> Megson set about making changes to the squad and accepted a &lt;U+00A3&gt;15 million bid from Chelsea for <a href="Nicolas_Anelka" title="wikilink">Nicolas Anelka</a>, using the money to rebuild the squad signing <a href="Tamir_Cohen" title="wikilink">Tamir Cohen</a>, <a href="Gr&lt;U+00E9&gt;tar_Steinsson" title="wikilink">Gr&lt;U+00E9&gt;tar Steinsson</a>, <a href="Matthew_Taylor_(footballer)" title="wikilink">Matthew Taylor</a> and <a href="Gary_Cahill" title="wikilink">Gary Cahill</a>.</p>
<p>Megson guided Bolton to survival with a 16th place finish, their safety being confirmed on the final day of the season, as they went on an unbeaten run for their final five games, as well as taking them to the last sixteen of the UEFA Cup. During the European run, Bolton gained a famous draw at former European champions <a href="FC_Bayern_Munich" title="wikilink">Bayern Munich</a> as well as becoming the first British team to beat <a href="Red_Star_Belgrade" title="wikilink">Red Star Belgrade</a> in Belgrade. They also defeated <a href="Atl&lt;U+00E9&gt;tico_Madrid" title="wikilink">Atl&lt;U+00E9&gt;tico Madrid</a> on aggregate before being knocked out by <a href="Sporting_Clube_de_Portugal" title="wikilink">Sporting Lisbon</a>.</p>
<p>The new manager broke Bolton's record transfer fee with the signing of <a href="Johan_Elmander" title="wikilink">Johan Elmander</a> from Toulouse on 27 June 2008, in a deal which cost the club a reported &lt;U+00A3&gt;8.2 million and saw Norwegian striker <a href="Daniel_Braaten" title="wikilink">Daniel Braaten</a> head in the opposite direction.<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a><a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a> Bolton's season started slowly, winning their opening game against <a href="Stoke_City" title="wikilink">Stoke City</a> 3&lt;U+2013&gt;1 then going on a run of 5 games without a win. November was undoubtedly their best month with four wins from their five games losing only to <a href="Liverpool_F.C" title="wikilink">Liverpool</a>. January saw former fan favourite <a href="Kevin_Nolan" title="wikilink">Kevin Nolan</a> leave the club to relegation bound <a href="Newcastle_United" title="wikilink">Newcastle United</a> in a &lt;U+00A3&gt;4 million deal, with <a href="Mark_Davies_(footballer)" title="wikilink">Mark Davies</a> and <a href="S&lt;U+00E9&gt;bastien_Puygrenier" title="wikilink">S&lt;U+00E9&gt;bastien Puygrenier</a> the only positive signings coming in. Tensions soon began to build between supporters and Megson after he branded them 'pathetic'.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a> This tension was key factor in his eventual sacking. Mixed results across the rest of the season left Bolton flirting with relegation but they finally finished 13th on 41 points.</p>
<p>Over the summer, Megson signed <a href="Sean_Davis_(footballer)" title="wikilink">Sean Davis</a>, <a href="Lee_Chung-Yong" title="wikilink">Lee Chung-Yong</a>, <a href="Zat_Knight" title="wikilink">Zat Knight</a>, <a href="Paul_Robinson_(defender_born_1978)" title="wikilink">Paul Robinson</a> (on-loan from <a href="West_Bromwich_Albion_F.C." title="wikilink">West Brom</a>) and <a href="Ivan_Klasni&lt;U+0107&gt;" title="wikilink">Ivan Klasni&lt;U+0107&gt;</a> (on loan from <a href="FC_Nantes" title="wikilink">Nantes</a>). The 2009&lt;U+2013&gt;2010 season started where the last one was headed, with only four wins from their opening 18 fixtures, notable losses including a 0&lt;U+2013&gt;2 home loss to <a href="Blackburn_Rovers" title="wikilink">Blackburn</a> and a 1&lt;U+2013&gt;5 drubbing at <a href="Aston_Villa_F.C." title="wikilink">Aston Villa</a>.</p>
<p>On 30 December 2009, Bolton announced that Megson had been sacked by the club due to a run of poor performances. His last game in charge, the night before his sacking, was a 2&lt;U+2013&gt;2 draw at home to <a href="Hull_City_A.F.C." title="wikilink">Hull City</a> after letting slip a 2&lt;U+2013&gt;0 lead.<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a> On 8 January 2010, former player <a href="Owen_Coyle" title="wikilink">Owen Coyle</a> was announced as Megson's replacement as manager.<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a></p>
