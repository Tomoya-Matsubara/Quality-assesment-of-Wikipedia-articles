<p><strong>Habiru</strong> or <strong>Apiru</strong> was the name given by various <a href="Sumeria" title="wikilink">Sumerian</a>, <a href="History_of_Ancient_Egypt" title="wikilink">Egyptian</a>, <a href="Akkad" title="wikilink">Akkadian</a>, <a href="Hittites" title="wikilink">Hittite</a>, <a href="Mitanni" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mitanni</a>, and <a href="Ugarit" title="wikilink">Ugaritic</a> sources (dated, roughly, from before <a href="2000_BC" title="wikilink">2000 BC</a> to around <a href="1200_BC" title="wikilink">1200 BC</a>) to a group of people living in the areas of Northeastern <a href="Mesopotamia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mesopotamia</a> and the <a href="Fertile_Crescent" title="wikilink">Fertile Crescent</a> from the borders of <a href="Egypt" class="uri" title="wikilink">Egypt</a> in <a href="Canaan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Canaan</a> to <a href="Iran" class="uri" title="wikilink">Iran</a>. Depending on the source and epoch, these Habiru are variously described as nomadic or semi-nomadic, rebellious, outlaws, raiders, mercenaries, servants or slaves, migrant laborers, etc..</p>
<p>The names Habiru and Apiru are used in <a href="Akkadian_language" title="wikilink">Akkadian</a> <a href="Cuneiform_script" title="wikilink">cuneiform</a> texts. The corresponding name in the consonant-only <a href="Egyptian_language" title="wikilink">Egyptian script</a> appears to be <strong><em>`PR.W</em></strong>, conventionally pronounced <strong>Apiru</strong> (W being the <a href="Egyptian_language" title="wikilink">Egyptian</a> plural suffix); <em>{An example of how to see this word in Egy. is: prU = pr, pr, pr //</em> Both are examples of the plural. pr is also pictured with the &quot;walking feet&quot;, and with &quot;pr&quot; for house, and &quot;r&quot; combined}. In Mesopotamian records they are also identified by the Sumerian <a href="logogram" class="uri" title="wikilink">logogram</a> <strong><em>SA.GAZ</em></strong>, of unknown pronunciation.</p>
<p>When the first written mention of the <em>Habiru</em> was found (the <a href="Amarna_letters" title="wikilink">Amarna letters</a>, which include many from <a href="Canaan" title="wikilink">Canaanite</a> vassal rulers written in <a href="Akkadian_language" title="wikilink">Akkadian</a> to Egyptian pharaohs in the 14th century BCE), scholars eagerly equated those people with the biblical Hebrews (i.e. <em>`BRY</em> (adj. form of the Hebrew <a href="&#39;Eber&#39;" class="uri" title="wikilink">'Eber'</a> ), and thought that those records provided independent confirmation of the invasion of Canaan by the <a href="Hebrews" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hebrews</a> under <a href="Joshua" class="uri" title="wikilink">Joshua</a>. </p>
<p>As more texts were uncovered throughout the Near East, it became clear that the Habiru were found throughout most of the Fertile Crescent--the arc of civilization &quot;extending from the Tigris-Euphrates river basins over to the Mediterranean littoral and down through the Nile Valley during the Second Millennium.&quot;.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> Carol Redmount who wrote 'Bitter Lives: Israel in and out of Egypt' in <em>The Oxford History of the Biblical World</em> concluded that the term &quot;Habiru&quot; had no common ethnic affiliations, that they spoke no common language, and that they normally led a marginal and sometimes lawless existence on the fringes of settled society.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> She defines the various Apiru/Habiru as &quot;a loosely defined, inferior social class composed of shifting and shifty population elements without secure ties to settled communities&quot; who are referred to &quot;as outlaws, mercenaries, and slaves&quot; in ancient texts.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> In that vein, some modern scholars consider the Habiru to be more of a social designation than an ethnic or a tribal one.</p>

<h3 id="sumerian-records">Sumerian records</h3>
<p>Sumerian documents from the reign of <a href="Shulgi_of_Ur" title="wikilink">Shulgi of Ur</a> (around <a href="2150_BC" title="wikilink">2150 BC</a>) describe a class of &quot;unclothed people, who travel in dead silence, who destroy everything, whose menfolk go where they will — they establish their tents and their camps — they spend their time in the countryside without observing the decrees of my king&quot;.</p>
<p>Those people are designated by a two-character cuneiform <a href="logogram" class="uri" title="wikilink">logogram</a> of unknown pronunciation, which is conventionally transcribed as <em>SA.GAZ</em>. Although the logogram occurs in Sumerian literature, the two symbols have no separate meaning in <a href="Sumerian_language" title="wikilink">Sumerian</a>. Some scholars have proposed that the logogram was pronounced <em>GUB.IRU</em> in Sumerian.</p>
<p>The <em>SA.GAZ</em> logogram in some ancient vocabulary lists is <a href="gloss" title="wikilink">glossed</a> as the <a href="Akkadian_language" title="wikilink">Akkadian</a> word <em>habbatu</em> which means a &quot;brigand&quot; or &quot;highway robber&quot;.</p>
<h3 id="early-mesopotamian-sources">Early Mesopotamian sources</h3>
<p>The Sumerian logogram <em>SA.GAZ</em> appears in texts from Southern Mesopotamia, dated from about <a href="1850_BC" title="wikilink">1850 BC</a>, where it is applied to small bands of soldiers, apparently mercenaries at the service of local city-states and being supplied with food or sheep. One of those texts uses the <a href="Akkadian_language" title="wikilink">Akkadian</a> cuneiform word <em>Hapiri</em> instead of the logogram; another described them as &quot;soldiers from the West&quot;. Their names are predominantly Akkadian; some are West Semitic, some unknown. Their origins, when recorded, are in local towns.</p>
<p>A letter to an Old Assyrian merchant resident in <a href="Ali?ar" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ali?ar</a> requests his aid in freeing or ransoming some <em>Hapiri</em>, formerly attached to the palace of Shalahshuwe (as yet unidentified), now prisoners of the local authorities.</p>
<p>The <a href="Tikunani_Prism" title="wikilink">Tikunani Prism</a>, dated from around <a href="1550_BC" title="wikilink">1550 BC</a>, lists the names of 438 <em>Habiru</em> soldiers or servants of king <a href="Tunpi-Te??ub" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tunpi-Te??ub</a> of <a href="Tikunani" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tikunani</a>, a small city-state in central Mesopotamia. The majority of these names are typically <a href="Hurrians" title="wikilink">Hurrian</a> (Caucasian, non-IndoEuropean), the rest are <a href="Semitic" class="uri" title="wikilink">Semitic</a>, one is <a href="Kassites" title="wikilink">Kassite</a>.</p>
<p>Another text from around <a href="1500_BC" title="wikilink">1500 BC</a> describes the <em>Hapiru</em> as soldiers or laborers, organized into bands of various sizes commanded by <em>SA.GAZ</em> leaders: one band from <a href="Tapduwa" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tapduwa</a> has 15 soldiers, another from <a href="Sarkuhe" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sarkuhe</a> has 29, and another from <a href="Alalakh" class="uri" title="wikilink">Alalakh</a> has 1,436.</p>
<h3 id="canaanite-sources">Canaanite sources</h3>
<p>A number of the <a href="Amarna_letters" title="wikilink">Amarna letters</a>—sent to pharaohs <a href="Amenhotep_III" title="wikilink">Amenhotep III</a>, <a href="Akhenaten" class="uri" title="wikilink">Akhenaten</a> (Amenhotep IV) and, briefly, his two successors from vassal kings in <a href="Canaan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Canaan</a> and Syria in the 1300s BCE — mention the &quot;Habiru&quot;. These letters, written by <a href="Canaan" title="wikilink">Canaanite</a> scribes in the <a href="cuneiform" class="uri" title="wikilink">cuneiform</a>-based <a href="Akkadian_language" title="wikilink">Akkadian language</a>, complain about attacks by armed groups who were willing to fight and plunder on any side of the local wars in exchange for equipment, provisions, and quarters.</p>
<p>Those people are identified by the Sumerian logogram <em>SA.GAZ</em> in most of the letters, and by the Akkadian name <em>Hapiru</em> in a few from the area of Jerusalem. They appear to be active on a broad area including <a href="Syria" class="uri" title="wikilink">Syria</a> (at <a href="Upe" class="uri" title="wikilink">Upe</a> near <a href="Damascus" class="uri" title="wikilink">Damascus</a>), <a href="Phoenicia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Phoenicia</a> (<a href="Sumur" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sumur</a>, <a href="Batrun" class="uri" title="wikilink">Batrun</a> and <a href="Byblos" class="uri" title="wikilink">Byblos</a>), and to the south as far as <a href="Jerusalem" class="uri" title="wikilink">Jerusalem</a> . None of the kings of the region, with the possible exception of one Abdi-Ashirta, are called <em>Habiru</em> or <em>SA.GAZ</em>.</p>
<h3 id="egyptian-sources">Egyptian sources</h3>
<p>Several Egyptian sources, both before and after the Amarna letters, mention a people called <em>`PR.W</em> in the consonant-only <a href="Egyptian_language" title="wikilink">Egyptian script</a>, where <em>.W</em> is the plural marker. The pronunciation of this word has been reconstructed as <em>apiru</em>. From similarity of context and description, it is believed that the Egyptian <em>`PR.W</em> are equivalent to the Akkadian Habiru/Hapiru.</p>
<p>In his account of the conquest of <a href="Jaffa,_Israel" title="wikilink">Joppa</a>, General Toth of <a href="pharaoh" class="uri" title="wikilink">pharaoh</a> <a href="Thutmose_III_of_Egypt" title="wikilink">Thutmose III of Egypt</a> (around <a href="1440_BC" title="wikilink">1440 BC</a>) asks at some point that his horses be taken inside the city, lest they be stolen by a passing <em>Apir</em>.</p>
<p>On two stelae at <a href="Memphis,_Egypt" title="wikilink">Memphis</a> and <a href="Karnak" class="uri" title="wikilink">Karnak</a>, Thutmose III's son <a href="Amenhotep_II" title="wikilink">Amenhotep II</a> boasts of having made 89,600 prisoners in his campaign in Palestine (around <a href="1420_BC" title="wikilink">1420 BC</a>), including &quot;127 princes and 179 nobles(?) of <a href="Retenu" class="uri" title="wikilink">Retenu</a>, 3600 <em>Apiru</em>, 15,200 <a href="Bedouin" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bedouin</a>, 36,600 <a href="Hurrians" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hurrians</a>,&quot; etc.</p>
<p>A stela from the reign of <a href="Seti_I" title="wikilink">Seti I</a> (around <a href="1300_BC" title="wikilink">1300 BC</a>) tells that the pharaoh sent an expedition into Syria or Palestine, in response to an attack of &quot;the <em>apiru</em> from Mount Yarmuta&quot; upon a local town. An unspecified number of the <em>apiru</em> were captured and brought back to Egypt as slaves.</p>
<p>A list of goods bequeathed to several temples by pharaoh <a href="Ramesses_III" title="wikilink">Ramesses III</a> (around <a href="1160_BC" title="wikilink">1160 BC</a>) includes many serfs, Egyptian and foreign: 86,486 to <a href="Thebes_(Egypt)" title="wikilink">Thebes</a> (2607 foreigners), 12,364 to <a href="Heliopolis_(ancient)" title="wikilink">Heliopolis</a> (2093 foreign), and 3079 to <a href="Memphis,_Egypt" title="wikilink">Memphis</a> (205 foreign). The foreign serfs are described as &quot;<em><a href="maryanu" class="uri" title="wikilink">maryanu</a></em> (soldiers), <em>apiru</em>, and people already settled in the temple estate&quot;.</p>
<p>The laborers that <a href="Ramesses_IV" title="wikilink">Ramesses IV</a> sent to the quarry of <a href="Wadi_Hammamat" title="wikilink">Wadi Hammamat</a> in his third year included 5,000 soldiers, 2,000 men attached to the temples of Pharaoh as well as 800 <em>Apiru</em>.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> This is the last known reference to the Apiru in Egyptian documents.</p>
<h3 id="hittite-sources">Hittite sources</h3>
<p>The <em>SA.GAZ</em> are mentioned in at least a dozen documents from the <a href="Hittites" title="wikilink">Hittite</a> kingdom, starting from <a href="1500_BC" title="wikilink">1500 BC</a> or earlier. Several documents contain the phrase &quot;the troops from Hatti and the <em>SA.GAZ</em> troops&quot;, Hatti being the core region of the Hittite kingdom. Two oaths from the reigns of Suppiluliuma (probably <a href="Suppiluliuma_I" title="wikilink">Suppiluliuma I</a>, reigned ca. <a href="1358_BC" title="wikilink">1358 BC</a> ? <a href="1323_BC" title="wikilink">1323 BC</a>) and <a href="Mursili_II" title="wikilink">Mursilis II</a> (around <a href="1300_BC" title="wikilink">1300 BC</a>) invoke, among a long list of deities, &quot;...the Lulahhi gods (and) the Hapiri gods, <a href="Ereskigal" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ereskigal</a>, the gods and goddesses of the <a href="Hatti" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hatti</a> land, the gods and goddesses of <a href="Amurru" class="uri" title="wikilink">Amurru</a> land, ...&quot;.</p>
<p>Another mention occurs in a treaty between kings <a href="Duppi-Teshub_of_Amurru" title="wikilink">Duppi-Teshub of Amurru</a> and <a href="Tudhaliyas_of_Carchemish" title="wikilink">Tudhaliyas of Carchemish</a>, arbitrated by <a href="Mursili_II" title="wikilink">Mursilis II</a>. The Hittite monarch recalls how he had restored king <a href="Abiradda" class="uri" title="wikilink">Abiradda</a> to the throne of <a href="Jaruwatta" class="uri" title="wikilink">Jaruwatta</a>, a town in the <a href="Barga_(kingdom)" title="wikilink">land of Barga</a>, which had been captured by the <a href="Hurrians" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hurrians</a> and given to &quot;the grandfather of <a href="Tette" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tette</a>, the <em>SA.GAZ</em>&quot;.</p>
<p>Another text record the existence of a Habiru settlement somewhere near a Hittite temple; one from Tahurpa names two female SA.GAZ singers.</p>
<h3 id="mitanni-sources">Mitanni sources</h3>
<p>An inscription on a statue found at <a href="Alalakh" class="uri" title="wikilink">Alalakh</a> in southeastern <a href="Anatolia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Anatolia</a> <a href="http://www.geocities.com/farfarer2001/alalakh/idrimi_inscription.htm">1</a>, the <a href="Mitanni" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mitanni</a> prince <a href="Idrimi" class="uri" title="wikilink">Idrimi</a> of <a href="Aleppo" class="uri" title="wikilink">Aleppo</a> (who lived from about <a href="1500_BC" title="wikilink">1500 BC</a> to <a href="1450_BC" title="wikilink">1450 BC</a>), tells that, after his family had been forced to flee to <a href="Emar" class="uri" title="wikilink">Emar</a>, he left them and joined the &quot;Hapiru people&quot; in &quot;<a href="Ammija" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ammija</a> in the land of Canaan&quot;. The Hapiru recognized him as the &quot;son of their overlord&quot; and &quot;gathered around him;&quot; they are said to include &quot;natives of Halab, of the country of Mukish, of the country <strong>Nihi</strong> and also warriors from the country Amae.&quot; After living among them for seven years, he led his Habiru warriors in a successful attack by sea on the city-state of Alalakh, where he became king.</p>
<p>Several detailed lists of SA.GAZ troops have been found on the same site, enumerating eighty in all. Their names are predominantly Hurrian; seven are perhaps Semitic. They come from a variety of settlements scattered around the region. One had been a thief, another a slave, two others, priests; most became infantry, a handful were charioteers, one a messenger. Like the SA.GAZ soldiers of the earlier Mesopotamian city-states, they received payment, or perhaps rations, in the form of sheep. A general enumeration of SA.GAZ soldiers within the city counts 1436 in all.</p>
<p>At <a href="Nuzi" class="uri" title="wikilink">Nuzi</a> in Mesopotamia, documents from the household of an official named Tehiptilla record a number of Habiru voluntarily entering long-term service in exchange for food, clothing, and shelter. Public records from the same city tally handouts of food and clothing to Habiru, the former to groups, the latter to individuals. One is given feed for a horse, perhaps indicating a military role. Another document allocates Habiru laborers to various individuals.</p>
<p>The local population was predominantly Hurrian, while approximately 2/3 of the Habiru names are Semitic; of these, all are East Semitic (Akkadian), none West Semitic.</p>
<h3 id="ugarit">Ugarit</h3>
<p>In the port town of <a href="Ugarit" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ugarit</a> in northern <a href="Syria" class="uri" title="wikilink">Syria</a>, a cuneiform tablet that was still being baked when the city was destroyed (around <a href="1200_BC" title="wikilink">1200 BC</a>) mentions the <em>PRM</em> (which are assumed to be the Hapiru, <em>-M</em> being the Ugaritic plural suffix). Tax lists from the city record the existence of &quot;Aleppo of the <em>PRM</em>&quot; (in Ugaritic) and &quot;Aleppo of the SAG.GAZ&quot; (in Akkadian; the logogram is slightly modified from the usual SA.GAZ). Being found in lists of four Aleppos that are otherwise the same, these are certainly the same location, but it is unclear whether they are separate settlements or quarters of one city.</p>
<h2 id="interpretations">Interpretations</h2>
<h3 id="habiru-as-a-loose-ethnic-group">Habiru as a loose ethnic group</h3>
<p>Scholars since <a href="Moshe_Greenberg" title="wikilink">Moshe Greenberg</a> have envisioned the Hapiru, like the 17th century <a href="Cossack" class="uri" title="wikilink">Cossack</a> bands of the Eastern European steppes, as being formed out of outlaws and drop-outs from neighbouring agricultural societies. The numbers of the Habiru of the <a href="2nd_millennium_BC" title="wikilink">2nd millennium BC</a> grew from the peasants who had fled the increasingly oppressive economic conditions of the <a href="Assyria" title="wikilink">Assyrian</a> and <a href="Babylonia" title="wikilink">Babylonian</a> kingdoms. The career of <a href="King_Idrimi" title="wikilink">King Idrimi</a> of <a href="Alalakh" class="uri" title="wikilink">Alalakh</a> (<em>ca</em> 1500 – 1450) may provide a parallel on a grander social level: forced into exile, King Idrimi first fled to Emar on the Euphrates, and then to Canaan where he joined other Syrian refugees to live with the wandering Hapiru. His brief biography would not have appeared in inscriptions at all, if he had not been able to return and make a successful new bid for power in the city of Alalakh.</p>
<p>Some scholars have seen the Habiru legacy preserved in the place-names of Iranian Kabira, the <a href="Khabur_River" title="wikilink">Khabur River</a> valley of the Northern <a href="Euphrates" class="uri" title="wikilink">Euphrates</a> and perhaps also the Hebron valley.</p>
<h3 id="habiru-and-the-hebrew">Habiru and the Hebrew</h3>
<p>When the Tell el-Amarna archives were translated, some scholars eagerly equated these Apiru with the Biblical Hebrews (<em>`BRY</em> in the consonant-only <a href="Hebrew_language" title="wikilink">Hebrew script</a>). Besides the similarity in the <a href="ethnicon" title="wikilink">ethnicons</a>, the description of the Apiru attacking cities in <a href="Canaan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Canaan</a> seemed to fit, loosely, the Biblical account of the conquest of that land by <a href="Hebrews" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hebrews</a> under <a href="Joshua" class="uri" title="wikilink">Joshua</a> or even by names with David's Hebrew rally against Saul.</p>
<p>Scholarly opinion remains divided on this issue. Many scholars still think that the Hapiru were a component of the later peoples who inhabited the kingdoms ruled by <a href="Saul_the_King" title="wikilink">Saul</a>, <a href="David" class="uri" title="wikilink">David</a>, <a href="Solomon" class="uri" title="wikilink">Solomon</a> and their successors in <a href="kingdom_of_Judah" title="wikilink">Judah</a> and <a href="kingdom_of_Israel" title="wikilink">Israel</a>.</p>
<p>If the Habiru were the proto-Hebrews, a <a href="Hurrian" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hurrian</a> origin would corroborate what some scholars see as Hurrian cultural themes in the Bible. Some Biblical proper names can be related to Anatolian or North Syrian (Hurrian) <a href="onomastics" class="uri" title="wikilink">onomastics</a> suggesting that these names may have entered Hebrew directly from Hurrian. For example, some of David's wandering Hebrews possess Hurrian Habiru names (e.g. Nihiri) <em>(compare with the name <strong>Nihi</strong> cited <a href="Habiru#Mitanni_sources" title="wikilink">above</a>)</em>.</p>
<p>There have also been theories relating the Habiru to the Biblical personages of <a href="Eber" class="uri" title="wikilink">Eber</a> and <a href="Abraham" class="uri" title="wikilink">Abraham</a>. While most scholars agree that the genealogies traced from Abraham are based on cultural beliefs and are without historical foundation, there are some who feel that perhaps Eber represents an etymological link to the Habiru.</p>
