<p>The <strong>2006 Lebanon War</strong>, also called the <strong>2006 Israel&lt;U+2013&gt;Hezbollah War</strong> and known in Lebanon as the <strong>July War</strong><a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> (, <em>&lt;U+1E24&gt;arb <a href="Tammuz_(Hebrew_month)#Other_uses" title="wikilink">Tamm&lt;U+016B&gt;z</a></em>) and in Israel as the <strong>Second Lebanon War</strong> (, <em>Milhemet Levanon HaShniya</em>),<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> was a 34-day <a href="war" title="wikilink">military conflict</a> in Lebanon, northern <a href="Israel" class="uri" title="wikilink">Israel</a> and the <a href="Golan_Heights" title="wikilink">Golan Heights</a>. The principal parties were <a href="Hezbollah" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hezbollah</a> paramilitary forces and the <a href="Israel_Defense_Forces" title="wikilink">Israeli military</a>. The conflict started on 12 July 2006, and continued until a United Nations-brokered <a href="ceasefire" class="uri" title="wikilink">ceasefire</a> went into effect in the morning on 14 August 2006, though it formally ended on 8 September 2006 when Israel lifted its naval <a href="blockade" class="uri" title="wikilink">blockade</a> of Lebanon. Due to unprecedented Iranian military support to Hezbollah before and during the war, some consider it the first round of the <a href="Iran&lt;U+2013&gt;Israel_proxy_conflict" title="wikilink">Iran&lt;U+2013&gt;Israel proxy conflict</a>, rather than a continuation of the <a href="Arab-Israeli_conflict" title="wikilink">Arab-Israeli conflict</a>.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>The conflict was precipitated by the <a href="Zar&#39;it-Shtula_incident" title="wikilink">Zar'it-Shtula incident</a>. On 12 July 2006, militants from the group Hezbollah fired <a href="List_of_artillery#Rockets" title="wikilink">rockets</a> at Israeli border towns as a diversion for an <a href="anti-tank_missile" title="wikilink">anti-tank missile</a> attack on two armored <a href="Humvee" title="wikilink">Humvees</a> patrolling the Israeli side of the border fence.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> The ambush left three soldiers dead.

Israel attacked both Hezbollah military targets and Lebanese civilian infrastructure, including Beirut's <a href="Beirut_Rafic_Hariri_International_Airport" title="wikilink">Rafic Hariri International Airport</a>.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> The <a href="Israel_Defense_Forces" title="wikilink">Israel Defense Forces</a> (IDF) launched a ground invasion of <a href="southern_Lebanon" title="wikilink">southern Lebanon</a>.

<h2 id="background">Background</h2>

<p>Cross-border attacks from <a href="southern_Lebanon" title="wikilink">southern Lebanon</a> into Israel by the <a href="Palestine_Liberation_Organization" title="wikilink">Palestine Liberation Organization</a> (PLO) date as far back as 1968, and followed the <a href="Six-Day_War" title="wikilink">Six-Day War</a>; the area became a significant base for attacks following the arrival of the PLO leadership and its <a href="Fatah" class="uri" title="wikilink">Fatah</a> brigade following their 1971 <a href="Black_September_in_Jordan" title="wikilink">expulsion from Jordan</a>. Starting about this time, increasing <a href="Demographics_of_Lebanon" title="wikilink">demographic tensions</a> related to the Lebanese <a href="National_Pact" title="wikilink">National Pact</a>, which had divided governmental powers among religious groups throughout the country 30 years previously, began running high and led in part to the <a href="Lebanese_Civil_War" title="wikilink">Lebanese Civil War</a> (1975&lt;U+2013&gt;1990).</p>
<p>Concurrently, Syria began a <a href="Syrian_occupation_of_Lebanon" title="wikilink">29-year military occupation</a> in 1976. Israel's <a href="Operation_Litani" title="wikilink">1978 invasion of Lebanon</a> failed to stem the Palestinian attacks in the long run, but <a href="1982_Lebanon_War" title="wikilink">Israel invaded Lebanon</a> again in 1982 and forcibly expelled the PLO.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> Israel withdrew to a <a href="Israeli_Security_Zone" title="wikilink">borderland buffer zone</a> in southern Lebanon, held with the aid of proxy militants in the <a href="South_Lebanon_Army" title="wikilink">South Lebanon Army</a> (SLA).<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a></p>
<p>The invasion also led to the conception of a new <a href="Shi&#39;a" class="uri" title="wikilink">Shi'a</a> <a href="Paramilitary" title="wikilink">militant group</a>, which in 1985, established itself politically under the name <a href="Hezbollah" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hezbollah</a>, and declared an armed struggle to end the <a href="1982-2000_South_Lebanon_conflict" title="wikilink">Israeli occupation</a> of Lebanese territory.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a><a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> When the Lebanese civil war ended and other warring factions agreed to disarm, both Hezbollah and the SLA refused. Ten years later, Israel withdrew from South Lebanon to the UN-designated and internationally recognized <a href="Blue_Line_(Lebanon)" title="wikilink">Blue Line</a> border in 2000.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a></p>
<p>The withdrawal also led to the immediate collapse of the SLA, and Hezbollah took control of the area in rapid succession. Later citing continued Israeli control of the disputed <a href="Shebaa_farms" title="wikilink">Shebaa farms</a> region and the <a href="internment" class="uri" title="wikilink">internment</a> of <a href="Lebanese_prisoners_in_Israel" title="wikilink">Lebanese prisoners in Israel</a>, Hezbollah intensified its cross-border attacks, and used the tactic of seizing soldiers from Israel as leverage for a <a href="Israeli_MIA_prisoner_exchanges" title="wikilink">prisoner exchange</a> in 2004.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a><a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a></p>
<p>In August 2006, in an article in <em><a href="The_New_Yorker" title="wikilink">The New Yorker</a></em>, <a href="Seymour_Hersh" title="wikilink">Seymour Hersh</a> claimed that the <a href="White_House" title="wikilink">White House</a> gave the green light for the <a href="Israeli_government" title="wikilink">Israeli government</a> to execute an attack on <a href="Hezbollah" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hezbollah</a> in Lebanon. Supposedly, communication between the Israeli government and the US government about this came as early as two months in advance of the capture of two Israeli soldiers and the killing of eight others by Hezbollah prior to the <a href="2006_Israel-Lebanon_conflict" title="wikilink">2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict</a> in July 2006.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> The US government denied these claims.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a></p>
<p>According to <a href="Jonathan_Cook" title="wikilink">Jonathan Cook</a>, the Winograd Committee leaked a testimony from Israeli Prime Minister <a href="Ehud_Olmert" title="wikilink">Ehud Olmert</a> suggesting that Olmert &quot;had been preparing for such a war at least four months before the official casus belli: the capture by Hizbullah of two Israeli soldiers from a border post on 12 July 2006.&quot; Cook also reported that &quot;Olmert told Winograd that, far from making war on the hoof in response to the capture of the two soldiers (the main mitigating factor for Israel&lt;U+2019&gt;s show of aggression), he had been planning the attack on Lebanon since at least March 2006.&quot;<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="abduction-efforts-in-the-year-prior-to-conflict">Abduction efforts in the year prior to conflict</h2>
<p>In June 2005, an <a href="Israel_Defense_Forces" title="wikilink">Israel Defense Forces</a> paratroop unit operating near the <a href="Shebaa_Farms" title="wikilink">Shebaa Farms</a> engaged three Lebanese it identified as Hezbollah special force members, killing one. Videotapes recovered by the paratroopers contained footage of the three recording detailed accounts of the area.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a></p>
<p>Over the following 12 months, Hezbollah made three unsuccessful attempts to abduct Israeli soldiers. On 21 November 2005, a number of Hezbollah special forces attempted to attack an Israeli outpost in <a href="Ghajar" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ghajar</a>, a village straddling the border between Lebanon and the <a href="Golan_Heights" title="wikilink">Golan Heights</a>. The outpost had been deserted following an intelligence warning, and three of the Hezbollah militants were killed when Israeli sniper David Markovich shot a <a href="rocket-propelled_grenade" title="wikilink">rocket-propelled grenade</a> they were carrying, causing it to explode. From his sniper position, Markovich shot and killed a fourth gunman shortly thereafter.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a><a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a></p>

<p>At around 9 AM local time on 12 July 2006, Hezbollah launched <a href="Feint" title="wikilink">diversionary</a> rocket attacks toward Israeli military positions near the coast and near the border village of <a href="Zar&#39;it" class="uri" title="wikilink">Zar'it</a><a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> as well as on the Israeli town of <a href="Shlomi_(town)" title="wikilink">Shlomi</a> and other villages.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> Five civilians were injured.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> Six Israeli military positions were fired on, and the surveillance cameras knocked out.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a></p>
<p>At the same time, a Hezbollah ground contingent infiltrated the <a href="Blue_Line_(Lebanon)" title="wikilink">border</a> into Israel through a &quot;dead zone&quot; in the border fence, hiding in an overgrown <a href="wadi" class="uri" title="wikilink">wadi</a>. They attacked a patrol of two Israeli <a href="Humvee" title="wikilink">Humvees</a> patrolling the border near Zar'it, using pre-positioned explosives and anti-tank missiles, killing three soldiers, injuring two, and capturing two soldiers (First Sergeant <a href="Ehud_Goldwasser" title="wikilink">Ehud Goldwasser</a> and Sergeant First Class <a href="Eldad_Regev" title="wikilink">Eldad Regev</a>).<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a><a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a></p>
<p>In response to the Hezbollah feint attacks, the IDF conducted a routine check of its positions and patrols, and found that contact with two jeeps was lost. A rescue force was immediately dispatched to the area, and confirmed that two soldiers were missing after 20 minutes. A <a href="Merkava" title="wikilink">Merkava Mk III</a> tank, an <a href="Armored_personnel_carrier" title="wikilink">Armored personnel carrier</a>, and a <a href="helicopter" class="uri" title="wikilink">helicopter</a> were immediately dispatched into Lebanon. The tank hit a large land mine, killing its crew of four. Another soldier was killed and two lightly injured by mortar fire as they attempted to recover the bodies.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a><a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a></p>
<p>Hezbollah named the attack &quot;<a href="2006_Hezbollah_cross-border_raid" title="wikilink">Operation Truthful Promise</a>&quot; after leader <a href="Hassan_Nasrallah" title="wikilink">Hassan Nasrallah</a>'s public pledges over the prior year and a half to seize Israeli soldiers and swap them for <a href="Lebanese_prisoners_in_Israel" title="wikilink">four Lebanese held by Israel</a>:</p>

<h3 id="israeli-response">Israeli response</h3>
<p>Israeli Prime Minister <a href="Ehud_Olmert" title="wikilink">Ehud Olmert</a> described the seizure of the soldiers as an &quot;act of war&quot; by the sovereign state of Lebanon,<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a><a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a> stating that &quot;Lebanon will bear the consequences of its actions&quot;<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a> and promising a &quot;very painful and far-reaching response.&quot;<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a> Israel blamed the Lebanese government for the raid, as it was carried out from Lebanese territory.<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a> Hezbollah had two ministers serving in the Lebanese cabinet at that time.</p>
<p>In response, Lebanese Prime Minister <a href="Fouad_Siniora" title="wikilink">Fouad Siniora</a> denied any knowledge of the raid and stated that he did not condone it.<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a><a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a> An emergency meeting of the Lebanese government reaffirmed this position.<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a></p>
<p>Later that same day (12 July 2006), the Cabinet decided to authorize the Prime Minister, the Defense Minister and their deputies to pursue the plan which they had proposed for action within Lebanon. Prime Minister Olmert officially demanded that the Israel Defense Forces avoid civilian casualties whenever possible.<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a> Israel's <a href="Ramatkal" title="wikilink">chief of staff</a> <a href="Dan_Halutz" title="wikilink">Dan Halutz</a> said, &quot;if the soldiers are not returned, we will turn Lebanon's clock back 20 years&quot;<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a> while the head of Israel's Northern Command <a href="Udi_Adam" title="wikilink">Udi Adam</a> said, &quot;this affair is between Israel and the state of Lebanon.

<p>On 12 July 2006, the Israeli Cabinet promised that Israel would &quot;respond aggressively and harshly to those who carried out, and are responsible for, today's action&quot;.<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a> The Cabinet's communiqu&lt;U+00E9&gt; stated, in part, that the &quot;Lebanese Government [was] responsible for the action that originated on its soil.&quot;<ref name="communiqu<U+00E9>&quot; /&gt; A retired Israeli Army Colonel explained that the rationale behind the attack was to create a rift between the Lebanese population and Hezbollah supporters by exacting a heavy price from the elite in <a href="Beirut" class="uri" title="wikilink">Beirut</a>.<a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a></p>
<p>On 16 July, the <a href="Cabinet_of_Israel" title="wikilink">Israeli Cabinet</a> released a communiqu&lt;U+00E9&gt; explaining that, although Israel had engaged in military operations <em>within</em> Lebanon, its war was not against the Lebanese government.

<p>When asked in August about the proportionality of the response, Prime Minister Olmert stated that the &quot;war started not only by killing eight Israeli soldiers and abducting two but by shooting <a href="Katyusha_rocket_launcher" title="wikilink">Katyusha</a> and other rockets on the northern cities of Israel on that same morning.

<p>During the first day of the war the Israeli Air Force, artillery and navy conducted more than 100 attacks mainly against Hizbullah bases in south Lebanon, among them the regional headquarters in Ya'tar. Five bridges across the Litani and Zahrani rivers were also destroyed, reportedly to prevent Hizbullah from transferring the abducted soldiers to the north.<a href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a></p>
<p>Attacks from land, sea and air continued in the following days. Among the targets hit were the Hizbullah headquarters in the southern suburbs of Beirut as well as the offices and homes of the leadership, the compounds of <a href="al-Manar" class="uri" title="wikilink">al-Manar</a> TV station and <a href="al-Nour" class="uri" title="wikilink">al-Nour</a> radio station, and the runways and fuel depots of the <a href="Rafic_Hariri_International_Airport" title="wikilink">Rafic Hariri International Airport</a> in Beirut. Also targeted were Hizbullah bases, weapons depots and outposts as well as bridges, roads and petrol stations in south Lebanon.<a href="#fn67" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a><a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a> 44 civilians were killed throughout the day.<a href="#fn69" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref69"><sup>69</sup></a></p>
<p>It was later reported that the Israel Air Force after midnight, 13 July, attacked and destroyed 59 stationary medium range <a href="Fajr" class="uri" title="wikilink">Fajr</a> rocket launchers positioned throughout southern Lebanon. <strong>Operation Specific Weight</strong> allegedly only took 34 minutes to carry out but was the result of six years of intelligence gathering and planning. Between half and two-thirds of Hizbullah medium range rocket capability was estimated by the IDF to have been wiped out. According to Harel and Issacharoff the operation was a &quot;Israel's most impressive military action&quot; and a &quot;devastating blow for Hezbollah&quot;. In the coming days IAF allegedly also attacked and destroyed a large proportion of Hizbullah's long range <a href="Zilzal" class="uri" title="wikilink">Zilzal</a> missiles.<a href="#fn70" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a></p>

<p>According to military analyst <a href="William_Arkin" title="wikilink">William Arkin</a> there is &quot;little evidence&quot; that the Israeli Air Force even attempted, much less succeeded in, wiping out the medium and long range rocket capability in the first days of the war.

<p>Hizbullah long remained silent on this episode of the war. On the sixth anniversary of the Lebanon war Hizbullah chairman Hassan Nasrallah claimed that Hizbullah had known that the Israelis were collecting information on the rocket platforms and launchers and managed to move them without being detected. Most of the locations attacked by the Israeli air force were therefore empty.<a href="#fn75" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref75"><sup>75</sup></a></p>
<p>American officials claimed that the Israelis overstated the effectiveness of the air war against Hizbullah and cited the failure to hit any of the Hizbullah leaders in spite of dropping 23 tons of bombs on its alleged headquarters bunker.<a href="#fn76" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref76"><sup>76</sup></a> Al-Manar TV station only went dark for two minutes after the strike before it was back into the air.

<p>The combined effect of the massive air and artillery bombardment on Hizbullah capacity to fire short-range Katyusha rockets on northern Israel was very meager. According to the findings of the post-war military investigations the IDF shelling succeeded only in destroying about 100 out of 12,000 Katyusha launchers &lt;U+2013&gt; less than one percent of the total. The massive fire led to a severe shortage of ammunition towards the end of the war.<a href="#fn81" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref81"><sup>81</sup></a> According to <a href="Human_Rights_Watch" title="wikilink">Human Rights Watch</a>, 51 combatants were killed in Israeli bombardments.<a href="#fn82" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref82"><sup>82</sup></a></p>

<p>On 16 July, eight employees of the Israel Railways were killed by direct rocket hits on the Haifa train depot.<a href="#fn89" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref89"><sup>89</sup></a> Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah defended the attacks, saying that Hezbollah initially had aimed its rockets on &quot;military sites only&quot;.

<p>The attack on the Haifa depot was not the first civilian target to be hit by Hizbullah. Civilians in the border communities were hurt in the initial cover fire on IDF positions for the cross-border raid. Two Israeli civilians were killed in an attack near the air force base at <a href="Mount_Meron" title="wikilink">Mount Meron</a> on July, 14. Since Hizbullah rockets were not very accurate it is unclear whether civilians were intentionally targeted in these attacks. After the attack on Haifa, however, Hizbullah made no attempt to cover this fact. According to a Human Rights Watch study civilian Israeli targets were mentioned four times as often in official Hizbullah war time communiques as was military targets.<a href="#fn91" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref91"><sup>91</sup></a></p>
<p>Israel published an alleged range card for upgraded Grad rocket launcher placed outside the village of Shihin in the Western sector of South Lebanon, issued by the Artillery Department of the elite Nasr Unit of Hizbullah.

<p>Hizbullah rocket attacks also targeted and succeeded in hitting military targets in Israel. The Israeli military censorship was, however, very strict and explicitly forbade Israel-based media from reporting such incidents.

<p>Amnesty International stated, however, that the volume of civilian casualties and damage to civilian infrastructure suggested that Israel was not just trying to target Hezbollah fighters.

<p>A 6 September 2007 Human Rights Watch report found that most of the civilian deaths in Lebanon resulted from &quot;indiscriminate Israeli airstrikes&quot;, and found that Israeli aircraft targeted vehicles carrying fleeing civilians.<a href="#fn171" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref171"><sup>171</sup></a> In a statement issued before the report's release, the human rights organization said there was no basis to the Israeli government's claim that civilian casualties resulted from Hezbollah guerrillas using civilians as shields. <a href="Kenneth_Roth" title="wikilink">Kenneth Roth</a>, Human Rights Watch executive director, said there were only &quot;rare&quot; cases of Hezbollah operating in civilian villages. &quot;To the contrary, once the war started, most Hizbollah(sic) military officials and even many political officials left the villages&quot; he said. &quot;Most Hizbollah(sic) military activity was conducted from prepared positions outside Lebanese villages in the hills and valleys around.&quot; Roth also noted that &quot;Hezbollah fighters often didn't carry their weapons in the open or regularly wear military uniforms, which made them a hard target to identify. But this doesn't justify the IDF's failure to distinguish between civilians and combatants, and if in doubt to treat a person as a civilian, as the <a href="laws_of_war" title="wikilink">laws of war</a> require.&quot;<a href="#fn172" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref172"><sup>172</sup></a></p>

<p>IDF Maj.-Gen. (res.) Yaakov Amidror said that IDF had identified the names of 440 members of Hizbullah who were killed in the war.

<h2 id="psychological-warfare">Psychological warfare</h2>
<p>During the war, the IAF dropped 17,000 leaflets over Lebanon in 47 missions, and sent more than 700,000 computerized voice messages. Many of them contained caricatures of Hassan Nasrallah and Hezbollah leading Lebanon to ruin and making civilians suffer, showing them as puppets of Iran and Syria, and calling on civilians to help remove Hezbollah. Another leaflet addressing Hezbollah fighters told them that they were lied to by their leaders, that they were &quot;sent like sheep to be butchered, lacking military training and without proper combat gear&quot;, that they could not hope to face &quot;highly trained soldiers that fight to protect their homeland, their people, and their home&quot;, referring to them as &quot;mercenaries&quot; without the support of the Lebanese public, and urging them to run and save their lives. On 26 July, Israel dropped leaflets containing illustrations of nine tombstones with the name of a dead Hezbollah fighter on each one, in response to Nasrallah &quot;deceiving&quot; people on the amount of Hezbollah casualties. Another leaflet urged Hezbollah fighters to stop bleeding and fighting for Nasrallah, who sat safe in a bunker, to stop fighting against Lebanese national interests, and to return to their homes and families. On 11 August, Israel dropped leaflets accusing Hezbollah of hiding its &quot;great losses&quot;, and containing the names of 90&lt;U+2013&gt;100 Hezbollah fighters killed. Israeli technicians also hacked into <a href="Al-Manar" class="uri" title="wikilink">Al-Manar</a> and broadcast clips, criticizing Nasrallah, showing the bodies of Hezbollah fighters, footage from Israeli raids and airstrikes, and captured Hezbollah equipment.<a href="#fn255" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref255"><sup>255</sup></a></p>

<p>Terms for a ceasefire had been drawn and revised several times over the course of the conflict, yet successful agreement between the two sides took several weeks.

He noted that Hezbollah had &quot;lost about a third of its elite fighting force&quot; and that &quot;despite mistakes made by the IDF in conducting the military campaign, Israeli soldiers triumphed in every face-to-face battle with Hezbollah.&quot; He concluded that &quot;as time passes, the severity of the blow suffered by Lebanon and its people from the 2006 war becomes clear.&quot;<a href="#fn301" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref301"><sup>301</sup></a></p>
<p>In 2008, <a href="Ehud_Barak" title="wikilink">Ehud Barak</a>, the replacement defense minister for Peretz, stated that the conflict failed to disarm Hezbollah, and that the group is increasingly entrenched in South Lebanon, further stating that &quot;Hezbollah is stronger than ever and has more rockets than at the outbreak of the Lebanon war in the summer of 2006&quot;<a href="#fn302" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref302"><sup>302</sup></a> but he later noted that &quot;[Israeli] deterrence still exists.&quot;<a href="#fn303" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref303"><sup>303</sup></a> The IDF's Northern Command cited this deterrence as one reason Hezbollah did not fire any rockets into Israel during <a href="Operation_Cast_Lead" title="wikilink">Operation Cast Lead</a>.<a href="#fn304" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref304"><sup>304</sup></a></p>

<p>Israeli military historian <a href="Martin_van_Creveld" title="wikilink">Martin van Creveld</a> stated that Israel's war against Hezbollah was indeed &quot;marked by a long series of failures&quot; but he criticized the <a href="Winograd_Commission" title="wikilink">Winograd Commission</a> for its failure to take into account the substantial achievements of the war. He noted that hundreds of Hezbollah fighters were killed in the war, and that the organization had &quot;the fight knocked out of it&quot;, since following the war, Israel experienced a level of calm on its Lebanon border not seen since the mid-1960s. He also noted that Hezbollah was &quot;thrown out of South Lebanon&quot;, and was replaced by &quot;a fairly robust United Nations peacekeeping force&quot; to prevent its return.<a href="#fn306" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref306"><sup>306</sup></a></p>
<p>IDF Maj.-Gen. (res.) Yaakov Amidror highlighted the number of Hezbollah militants killed, the quick military response to Hezbollah's long-range rocket attacks, the post-war replacement of Hezbollah by the Lebanese Army and UNIFIL in southern Lebanon, and Iran's loss of Hezbollah as a deterrent against an Israeli first strike following the war.<a href="#fn307" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref307"><sup>307</sup></a> <a href="Thomas_Friedman" title="wikilink">Thomas Friedman</a> concurred, stating that the war was a &quot;huge strategic loss for Hezbollah&quot;, and contrasted the billions in damage suffered by Hezbollah and Lebanon with the &quot;relatively minor damage&quot; suffered by Israel, which enjoyed an economic &quot;growth spurt&quot; immediately following the war.<a href="#fn308" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref308"><sup>308</sup></a></p>
<h4 id="winograd-commission-report">Winograd Commission Report</h4>

<p>According to the Winograd Commission Report, the Second Lebanon War was regarded as a &quot;missed opportunity&quot; and that &quot;Israel initiated a long war, which ended without a defined military victory&quot;. The report continued to state that &quot;a semi-military organization of a few thousand men resisted, for a few weeks, the strongest army in the Middle East, which enjoyed full <a href="air_superiority" title="wikilink">air superiority</a> and size and technology advantages&quot;. Furthermore, <a href="Hezbollah" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hezbollah</a>'s rocket attacks continued throughout the war and the IDF did not provide an effective response to it. Following a long period of using standoff firepower and limited ground activities, the IDF launched a large-scale ground offensive close to the UN Security Council's resolution which imposed a cease-fire. &quot;This offensive did not result in military gains and was not completed&quot;.</p>
<p>Later in the Report, the Commission stated that &quot;[a] decision [was] made in the night of 12 July to react (to the capturing) with immediate and substantive military action and to set... ambitious goals.&quot; This decision had immediate repercussions in that subsequent decisions were limited mainly to a choice between a) &quot;a short, painful and unexpected blow on Hezbollah&quot; and b) &quot;to bring about a significant change of the reality in the South of Lebanon with a large ground operation,[occupying]...the South of Lebanon and 'cleaning' it of Hezbollah&quot;. &quot;The fact Israel went to war before it decided which option to select and without an exit strategy, all these constituted serious failures of the decision making process.&quot;</p>
<p>As for achievements, the Commission reported that &quot;SC resolution 1701, and the fact that it was adopted unanimously, were an achievement for Israel.&quot;<a href="#fn309" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref309"><sup>309</sup></a></p>

He also said that Israel &quot;mishandled&quot; its opportunity, and that some of the sites it attacked were of &quot;questionable military value&quot;.<a href="#fn312" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref312"><sup>312</sup></a> <img src="Bush_delivers_Middle_East_crisis_statement_w_Rice_Aug_7_2006.jpg" title="fig:George W.

<p>In a speech given on 15 August 2006, Syrian President <a href="Bashar_al-Assad" title="wikilink">Bashar al-Assad</a> claimed that the Arab resistance against Israel would continue to grow stronger, saying, &quot;Your weapons, warplanes, rockets and even <a href="Nuclear_weapons_and_Israel" title="wikilink">your atomic bomb</a> will not protect you in the future.&quot;<a href="#fn313" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref313"><sup>313</sup></a></p>
<p><em><a href="The_Economist" title="wikilink">The Economist</a></em> magazine concluded that by surviving this asymmetrical military conflict with Israel, Hezbollah effectively emerged with a military and political victory from this conflict.

<p>The US <a href="Congressional_Research_Service" title="wikilink">Congressional Research Service</a> found that although Hezbollah's military capabilities may have been substantially reduced, its long-term potential as a guerrilla movement appeared to remain intact: &quot;Observers note that Hezbollah&lt;U+2019&gt;s leaders have been able to claim a level of 'victory' simply by virtue of not having decisively 'lost'.&quot;<a href="#fn316" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref316"><sup>316</sup></a></p>

<p>British military historian <a href="John_Keegan" title="wikilink">John Keegan</a> stated that the outcome of the war was &quot;misreported as an Israeli defeat&quot; due to anti-Israel bias in the international media. He concluded that Hezbollah had suffered heavy losses, and that a cease-fire came into effect before Israel could completely dislodge Hezbollah from its positions. He also stated that the casualties sustained by Israel during the war had alarmed the Israeli Government and High Command because Israel's small population is acutely vulnerable to losses in battle.<a href="#fn318" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref318"><sup>318</sup></a></p>
<p><a href="Charles_Krauthammer" title="wikilink">Charles Krauthammer</a>, a syndicated columnist and political commentator, citing an interview by which Nasrallah admitted that he would not have captured the soldiers had he known that it would lead to war, wrote, &quot;Nasrallah's admission, vastly underplayed in the West, makes clear what Lebanese already knew. Hezbollah may have won the propaganda war, but on the ground it lost. Badly.&quot; He noted that Hezbollah's entrenched infrastructure along Israel's border was shattered and would not be easily rebuilt due to the presence of the Lebanese Army and a robust UNIFIL force, hundreds of Hezbollah's best fighters were killed in the war, and that many Lebanese were angry with Hezbollah for provoking a war which largely devastated the country.<a href="#fn319" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref319"><sup>319</sup></a></p>
<p>The <em><a href="Washington_Post" title="wikilink">Washington Post</a></em> stated that the war had been &quot;widely seen as a disaster for the Israeli military&quot;.

<p>Michael Young, opinion page editor at the Lebanese <em><a href="Daily_Star_(Lebanon)" title="wikilink">Daily Star</a></em> newspaper, stated that Hezbollah turned &quot;the stench of defeat into the smell of victory,&quot; through clever use of its propaganda machine. He suggested that Hezbollah had &quot;hoodwinked&quot; pundits who believed that Hezbollah was victorious, and opined that &quot;one dreads to imagine what Hezbollah would recognize as a military loss.&quot;<a href="#fn322" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref322"><sup>322</sup></a></p>
<p>American military strategist and historian <a href="Edward_Luttwak" title="wikilink">Edward Luttwak</a> drew comparisons with the 1973 Yom Kippur War, where what initially looked like an Israeli setback later turned out to be an IDF victory and an Arab defeat.

<h2 id="media-coverage-and-related-issues">Media coverage and related issues</h2>


<p>The 2007 report &quot;'War to the Last Moment': The Israeli Media in the Second Lebanon War&quot; by the Israeli media monitoring NGO <a href="http://www.keshev.org.il">Keshev</a> (trans. &quot;Awareness&quot;)<a href="#fn331" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref331"><sup>331</sup></a> stated that the Israeli media &quot;except for a few exceptional instances...covered the war in an almost entirely mobilized manner&quot; serving more to support the goals of the Israeli government and IDF than to objectively report the news. &quot;The media created a general atmosphere of complete and absolute support and justification of the war, and systematically suppressed questions that arose as early as the first day of fighting... The criticism gradually increased toward the end of the war-as it became clearer that the IDF was not managing to win. But the general spirit of the war coverage, in the broad strategic sense, as utterly uncritical.&quot; Keshev's report documents a post-war memo from the Deputy CEO of Marketing for the Hebrew newspaper <a href="Maariv" class="uri" title="wikilink">Maariv</a> to Maariv employees which states, in part, that </p>
<p>According to the report, &quot;significant coverage of the decision-making process was almost entirely absent in Israel's media&quot; at the beginning of the war and reports on the status of Israelis living in the North who did not receive proper governmental support were marginalized. Further, the report states that the media unreasonably centered on the question of the loyalties of Arab-Israelis in the North instead of focusing on inadequate provision of services by the state. The report acknowledges that the Israeli media reported on Lebanese suffering, But states that it divorced the suffering from the IDF operations causing it. Finally, with regard to diplomacy, Israeli media buried the stories on negotiations to reflect the derision held by decision-makers toward a diplomatic solution.<a href="#fn332" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref332"><sup>332</sup></a></p>
<p>On 18 July 2006 Hezbollah Press Officer Hussein Nabulsi took CNN's <a href="Nic_Robertson" title="wikilink">Nic Robertson</a> on an exclusive tour of southern Beirut. Robertson noted that despite his minder's anxiety about explosions in the area, it was clear that Hezbollah had sophisticated media relations and were in control of the situation. Hezbollah designated the places that they went to, and the journalists &quot;certainly didn't have time to go into the houses or lift up the rubble to see what was underneath.&quot; According to his reports, there was no doubt that the bombs were hitting Hezbollah facilities, and while there appeared to be &quot;a lot of civilian damage, a lot of civilian properties,&quot; he reiterated that he couldn't verify the civilian nature of the destroyed buildings.<a href="#fn333" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref333"><sup>333</sup></a></p>

On 7 February 2010, the Lebanese Army fired at an Israeli bulldozer on the border, and Israeli forces returned fire. There were no reported casualties. Lebanon claimed that the bulldozer had crossed the border and entered Lebanese territory.

It further stated that in spite of &quot;flexibility by Israel beyond the framework of UNSC-Resolution 1701, implementation of the resolution's humanitarian aspects has not yet been possible.&quot;<a href="#fn379" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref379"><sup>379</sup></a></p>
