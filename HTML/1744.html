<p>Aliadi&lt;U+00E8&gt;re missed much of the following <a href="2004&lt;U+2013&gt;05_in_English_football" title="wikilink">2004&lt;U+2013&gt;05</a> season through injury, and was kept out of action until February. On his return, he made six substitute appearances for the first team. Although he failed to score in these matches, he scored eight goals in five games for Arsenal's reserves. Despite his limited opportunities, he was offered and signed a new Arsenal contract, running until the summer of 2009, announced at the same time as a loan move to Celtic.</p>
<h3 id="loan-to-celtic">Loan to Celtic</h3>
<p>In the summer of 2005 Aliadi&lt;U+00E8&gt;re was sent on loan to Scottish club <a href="Celtic_F.C." title="wikilink">Celtic</a> for the entire <a href="2005&lt;U+2013&gt;06_in_Scottish_football" title="wikilink">2005&lt;U+2013&gt;06</a> season in order to play regular first team football. Despite his limited appearances, Arsenal manager Ars&lt;U+00E8&gt;ne Wenger had stated he had a future at Arsenal, but was currently being kept out of the side by the form of Thierry Henry and <a href="Dennis_Bergkamp" title="wikilink">Dennis Bergkamp</a>.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> In the end, he made just two substitute appearances for the club, one in each leg of Celtic's loss to <a href="Artmedia_Bratislava" title="wikilink">Artmedia Bratislava</a> in the <a href="2004&lt;U+2013&gt;05_UEFA_Champions_League" title="wikilink">2004&lt;U+2013&gt;05 UEFA Champions League</a>.</p>
<h3 id="loan-to-west-ham-united">Loan to West Ham United</h3>
<p>On 24 August 2005 Aliadi&lt;U+00E8&gt;re decided to move back to London after a lack of first team opportunities, where <a href="West_Ham_United_F.C." title="wikilink">West Ham United</a> took over his year-long loan deal, having been promoted back to the Premier League after two seasons in the lower leagues. It was thought that his disappointment at being behind strikers <a href="John_Hartson" title="wikilink">John Hartson</a>, new signing <a href="Maciej_Zurawski" title="wikilink">Maciej Zurawski</a> and youngsters <a href="Shaun_Maloney" title="wikilink">Shaun Maloney</a> and <a href="Craig_Beattie" title="wikilink">Craig Beattie</a> at Celtic contributed to his departure. Once again affected by injury, he only made eight appearances for West Ham, seven as a substitute.</p>
<h3 id="loan-to-wolverhampton-wanderers">Loan to Wolverhampton Wanderers</h3>
<p>On 31 January 2006, West Ham terminated the loan, and Aliadi&lt;U+00E8&gt;re moved to the English Midlands to join the <a href="Football_League_Championship" title="wikilink">Football League Championship</a> club <a href="Wolverhampton_Wanderers_F.C." title="wikilink">Wolverhampton Wanderers</a> on loan for the remainder of the <a href="2005&lt;U+2013&gt;06_in_English_football" title="wikilink">2005&lt;U+2013&gt;06</a> season.

The move failed to happen however after <a href="Robin_van_Persie" title="wikilink">Robin van Persie</a> broke his foot, and he was told to stay at Arsenal for the time being. He made his final Arsenal appearance on the final day of the 2006&lt;U+2013&gt;07 season against <a href="Portsmouth_F.C." title="wikilink">Portsmouth</a> in a 0&lt;U+2013&gt;0 draw at <a href="Fratton_Park" title="wikilink">Fratton Park</a>.</p>
<h3 id="middlesbrough">Middlesbrough</h3>

It was the cause of controversy after Middlesbrough's consequent appeal was deemed as &quot;frivolous&quot; by the <a href="Football_Association" title="wikilink">Football Association</a> and extended by one more game, with the club's chairman and chief executive, and Tottenham manager <a href="Harry_Redknapp" title="wikilink">Harry Redknapp</a>, deeming this unfair and criticising the FA, contrasting it with a recent appeal by Chelsea's <a href="Michael_Essien" title="wikilink">Michael Essien</a>.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a><a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a><a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
<p>Before the start of the <a href="2008&lt;U+2013&gt;09_in_English_football" title="wikilink">2008&lt;U+2013&gt;09</a> season Aliadi&lt;U+00E8&gt;re switched to wearing the number 10 previously worn by midfielder <a href="F&lt;U+00E1&gt;bio_Rochemback" title="wikilink">F&lt;U+00E1&gt;bio Rochemback</a>, when his number 11 was given to 3.2 million summer signing <a href="Marvin_Emnes" title="wikilink">Marvin Emnes</a>.

<p>Aliadi&lt;U+00E8&gt;re was booed early on in the <a href="2009&lt;U+2013&gt;10_in_English_football" title="wikilink">2009&lt;U+2013&gt;10</a> season in the Championship by a section of the Middlesbrough fans.

<h3 id="post-middlesbrough">Post-Middlesbrough</h3>
