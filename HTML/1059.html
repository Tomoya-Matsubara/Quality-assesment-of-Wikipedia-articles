<p><strong>Cassius Longinus</strong> (ca. 213–273) was an <a href="Hellenistic_period" title="wikilink">Hellenistic</a> <a href="rhetorician" class="uri" title="wikilink">rhetorician</a> and philosophical critic. He was perhaps a native of <a href="Emesa" class="uri" title="wikilink">Emesa</a> in <a href="Syria" class="uri" title="wikilink">Syria</a>. He studied at <a href="Alexandria" class="uri" title="wikilink">Alexandria</a> under <a href="Ammonius_Saccas" title="wikilink">Ammonius Saccas</a> and <a href="Origen_the_Pagan" title="wikilink">Origen the Pagan</a>, and taught for thirty years in <a href="Athens" class="uri" title="wikilink">Athens</a>, one of his pupils being <a href="Porphyry_(philosopher)" title="wikilink">Porphyry</a>. Longinus did not embrace the <a href="Neoplatonism" class="uri" title="wikilink">Neoplatonism</a> then being developed by <a href="Plotinus" class="uri" title="wikilink">Plotinus</a>, but continued as a <a href="Platonism" title="wikilink">Platonist</a> of the old type and his reputation as a literary critic was immense. During a visit to the east, he became a teacher, and subsequently chief counsellor to <a href="Zenobia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Zenobia</a>, queen of <a href="Palmyrene_Empire" title="wikilink">Palmyra</a>. It was by his advice that she endeavoured to regain her independence; Emperor <a href="Aurelian" class="uri" title="wikilink">Aurelian</a>, however, crushed the revolt, and Longinus was executed.</p>
<h2 id="life">Life</h2>
<p>The origin of his <a href="Roman_naming_conventions" title="wikilink">gentile</a> name <a href="Cassius_(gens)" title="wikilink">Cassius</a> is unknown; it can only be conjectured that he was the client to some Cassius Longinus, or that his ancestors had received the Roman franchise through the influence of some Cassius Longinus. He was born about 213, and was killed in 273, at the age of sixty. The suggestion that his original name was Dionysius arose only because the 1st century rhetorical treatise <em><a href="Longinus_(literature)" title="wikilink">On the Sublime</a></em> was ascribed to a &quot;Dionysius or Longinus&quot; in the medieval period.</p>
<p>His native place is uncertain; some say that Longinus was born at <a href="Palmyra" class="uri" title="wikilink">Palmyra</a>, and others call him a <a href="Roman_Syria" title="wikilink">Syrian</a> or a native of <a href="Emesa" class="uri" title="wikilink">Emesa</a>, The belief that he was of Syrian origin is only an inference from the fact that his mother was a Syrian woman, and from an obscure passage in the <a href="Historia_Augusta" title="wikilink">Historia Augusta</a>,<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> from which it may be inferred that he could speak the <a href="Syriac" class="uri" title="wikilink">Syriac</a> language. He may have been born at <a href="Athens" class="uri" title="wikilink">Athens</a>, for the <a href="Suda" class="uri" title="wikilink">Suda</a><a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> states that <a href="Fronto_of_Emesa" title="wikilink">Fronto of Emesa</a>, the uncle of Longinus, taught rhetoric at Athens, and on his death in Athens left behind him Longinus, the son of his sister Frontonis.</p>
<p>It would seem that Fronto took special care of the education of his nephew, and on his death-bed he made him his heir. In the preface to his work <em>On Ends</em>, which is preserved in <a href="Porphyry_(philosopher)" title="wikilink">Porphyry</a>'s <em>Life of Plotinus</em>, Longinus himself relates that from his early age he made many journeys with his parents, that he visited many countries, and became acquainted with all those who at the time enjoyed a great reputation as philosophers, and among whom the most illustrious were <a href="Ammonius_Saccas" title="wikilink">Ammonius Saccas</a>, <a href="Origen_the_Pagan" title="wikilink">Origen the Pagan</a>, <a href="Plotinus" class="uri" title="wikilink">Plotinus</a>, and <a href="Amelius" class="uri" title="wikilink">Amelius</a>. Of the first two Longinus was a pupil for a long time, but Longinus did not embrace the Neoplatonism then being developed by Ammonius and Plotinus, but continued as a Platonist of the old type.</p>
<p>Longinus in his study of philosophy made himself thoroughly familiar Plato's works; and that he himself was a genuine Platonist is evident from the fragments still extant, as well as from the commentaries he wrote on several of Plato's dialogues; and the few fragments of these commentaries which have come down to us, show that he was free from the allegorical notions by which his contemporaries claimed to have discovered the wisdom of the ancients. His commentaries not only explained the subject-matter discussed by Plato, but also his style and diction. In opposition to Plotinus, Longinus upheld the doctrine that the <a href="Theory_of_forms" title="wikilink">Platonic ideas</a> existed outside the divine <em><a href="Nous" class="uri" title="wikilink">Nous</a></em>. Plotinus, after reading his treatise <em>On First Principles</em>, remarked that Longinus might be a scholar, but that he was no philosopher.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>After Longinus had learnt all he could from Ammonius at <a href="Alexandria" class="uri" title="wikilink">Alexandria</a>, and the other philosophers whom he met in his travels, he returned to Athens. He there devoted himself with so much zeal to the instruction of his many pupils, that he scarcely had any time left for writing. The most distinguished of his pupils was <a href="Porphyry_(philosopher)" title="wikilink">Porphyry</a>. At Athens he seems to have lectured on philosophy and criticism, as well as on rhetoric and grammar,<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> and the extent of his knowledge was so great, that <a href="Eunapius" class="uri" title="wikilink">Eunapius</a> calls him &quot;a living library&quot; and &quot;a walking museum;&quot; but the power for which he was most celebrated was his critical skill,<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> and this was indeed so great, that the expression &quot;to judge like Longinus&quot; became synonymous with &quot;to judge correctly&quot;.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p>After having spent much of his life at Athens, and composing the best of his works, he went to the East, either to see his friends at Emesa or to settle some of his family affairs. It seems to have been on that occasion that he became known to queen <a href="Zenobia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Zenobia</a> of <a href="Palmyrene_Empire" title="wikilink">Palmyra</a>, who, being a woman of great talent, and fond of the arts and literature, made him her teacher of Greek literature. As Longinus had no extensive library at his command at Palmyra, he was obliged almost entirely to abandon his literary pursuits, but he soon discovered another use for his talents; for when king <a href="Odaenathus" class="uri" title="wikilink">Odaenathus</a> died, and Zenobia had undertaken the government of her empire, she availed herself of the advice of Longinus, and it was he who, being an ardent lover of liberty, advised and encouraged her to shake off Roman rule, and become an independent sovereign. In consequence of this, Zenobia wrote a spirited letter to the Roman emperor <a href="Aurelian" class="uri" title="wikilink">Aurelian</a>.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> In 273, when Aurelian took and destroyed Palmyra, Longinus had to pay with his life for the advice which he had given to Zenobia.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> This catastrophe must have been the more painful to Longinus, since the queen, after having fallen into the hands of the Romans, asserted her own innocence, and threw all the blame upon her advisers, and more especially upon Longinus. But he bore his execution with a firmness and cheerfulness worthy of a <a href="Socrates" class="uri" title="wikilink">Socrates</a>.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<p>In his private life he seems to have been very amiable; for although his pupil Porphyry left him, declaring that he would seek a better philosophy in the school of Plotinus, still Longinus did not show him any ill-will, but continued to treat him as a friend, and invited him to come to Palmyra.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> He had an ardent love of liberty, and a great frankness both in expressing his own opinions and exposing the faults and errors of others.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="writings">Writings</h2>
<p>Notwithstanding his many <a href="avocation" title="wikilink">avocations</a>, Longinus composed a great number of works, which appear to have been held in the highest estimation, all of which have perished. It was once thought that the extant rhetorical treatise <em><a href="Longinus_(literature)" title="wikilink">On the Sublime</a></em> was written by him, but it is now thought to have been written by an unknown 1st century writer.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> Among the works listed by the <a href="Suda" class="uri" title="wikilink">Suda</a> there are <em>Homeric Questions</em>; <em>Whether Homer is a Philosopher</em>; <em>Homeric Problems and Solutions</em>; and <em>two publications on Attic diction</em>.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> The most important of his <a href="philological" class="uri" title="wikilink">philological</a> works, - <em>Philological Discourses</em> - consisting of at least 21 books, is omitted. A considerable fragment of his <em>On the Chief End</em> is preserved by Porphyry.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> Under his name there are also extant Prolegomena to the <em>Handbook of Hephaestion</em> on metre, and the fragment of a treatise on rhetoric, inserted in the middle of a similar treatise by <a href="Apsines" class="uri" title="wikilink">Apsines</a>. It gives brief practical hints on invention, arrangement, style, memory and other things useful to the student.</p>
