<p><strong>Joe Colbeck</strong> (born 29 November 1986) is an English professional <a href="association_football" title="wikilink">footballer</a> who plays as a <a href="Midfielder#Winger" title="wikilink">right winger</a> for <a href="Football_League_Two" title="wikilink">League Two</a> side <a href="Hereford_United_F.C." title="wikilink">Hereford United</a>.</p>
<p>Born in <a href="Bradford" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bradford</a>, England, he joined his hometown club, <a href="Bradford_City_A.F.C." title="wikilink">Bradford City</a>, as a youth team player in 2002, making his debut two years later. He played more than 100 league games for Bradford during five years in the first team. Colbeck nearly left Bradford in 2007 when he was made available for transfer and played six games on loan for <a href="Darlington_F.C." title="wikilink">Darlington</a>. However, he returned following his loan spell and went on to win Bradford City's player of the season award during the <a href="Bradford_City_A.F.C._season_2007-08" title="wikilink">2007–08</a> campaign. He turned down a new deal a year later and joined <a href="Oldham_Athletic_A.F.C." title="wikilink">Oldham Athletic</a> on transfer deadline day in September 2009 to rejoin manager <a href="Dave_Penney" title="wikilink">Dave Penney</a>, for whom he played at Darlington. When Penney was sacked after less than a year in charge, Colbeck also soon left and joined Hereford United.</p>

<p>His first full season in the first team was during <a href="Bradford_City_A.F.C._season_2006&lt;U+2013&gt;07" title="wikilink">2006–07</a>,<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> although he was kept out of the team during the early part of the season by winger <a href="Jermaine_Johnson" title="wikilink">Jermaine Johnson</a>. After eight straight games as substitute, Colbeck made his first start of the season in a <a href="West_Yorkshire_derby" title="wikilink">West Yorkshire derby</a> against <a href="Huddersfield_Town_F.C." title="wikilink">Huddersfield Town</a> on 7 October 2006.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a><a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> He continued to play more games in the side but as City struggled, Colbeck was sent off during a vital game against <a href="Oldham_Athletic" title="wikilink">Oldham Athletic</a> in April 2007.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> He was suspended following the <a href="penalty_card#Red_card" title="wikilink">red card</a> but returned to the side after his suspension, and was involved in the 3–0 defeat to Chesterfield which confirmed Bradford's <a href="promotion_and_relegation" title="wikilink">relegation</a> from League One.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<p>Colbeck started the new season in <a href="Football_League_Two" title="wikilink">League Two</a> as a substitute,<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> but won a place in the side, and scored his first senior goal against <a href="Lincoln_City_F.C." title="wikilink">Lincoln City</a> more than three years after his debut.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> However, after a mistake cost defeat to <a href="Milton_Keynes_Dons_F.C." title="wikilink">Milton Keynes Dons</a>, he was told he could join another club on loan.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> On 24 October 2007, Colbeck went on a month-long loan to <a href="Darlington_F.C." title="wikilink">Darlington</a> to take the place of injured <a href="Julian_Joachim" title="wikilink">Julian Joachim</a>.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> Colbeck scored in both his second<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> and third<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> games before the loan was extended for a second month.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> The loan deal was cut short when he returned to Bradford City in December 2007 after he had made six appearances for Darlington,<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a><a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> but Darlington manager <a href="Dave_Penney" title="wikilink">Dave Penney</a> was disappointed to see Colbeck leave saying, &quot;Joe was fantastic for us. He scored a couple of goals and had a real effect on us so we're sorry to see him go.&quot;<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a></p>
<p>He immediately went back into the Bradford side,<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> and added his second goal for the club in a 2–0 win over <a href="Accrington_Stanley_F.C." title="wikilink">Accrington Stanley</a> on New Year's Day.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> Darlington made a bid to sign Colbeck on a permanent basis during January 2008, but City chairman <a href="Julian_Rhodes" title="wikilink">Julian Rhodes</a> turned down the bid, and Colbeck was a regular player for the rest of the <a href="Bradford_City_A.F.C._season_2007&lt;U+2013&gt;08" title="wikilink">2007–08</a> season.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> The run of games included the third goal in a 3–1 win against former side Darlington at the <a href="Darlington_Arena" title="wikilink">Darlington Arena</a>.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> On 19 April 2008, he scored his sixth goal for the club, but first in a home game, when his last minute goal gave Bradford a 2–1 win over <a href="Grimsby_Town_F.C." title="wikilink">Grimsby Town</a>.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> Three days later, Colbeck was announced as the club's player of the season, even though he had started just 26 league games,<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> 23 of which came in City's 26 games since Colbeck returned on loan from Darlington. Colbeck was surprised to win the award, saying: &quot;If you'd said at the beginning of the season that I would win this award, I'd have thought you were mad. I wasn't even a regular in the team.&quot;<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> However, in the following league game, Colbeck was sent off for the second time in his career, for a foul on <a href="Dean_Lewington" title="wikilink">Dean Lewington</a>, as City lost 2–1 to Milton Keynes Dons,<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> which meant he missed the final game of the season through suspension.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a></p>
<p>Colbeck had been playing since January with a groin injury, which hampered his preparations for the <a href="Bradford_City_A.F.C._season_2008&lt;U+2013&gt;09" title="wikilink">2008–09</a> season and prevented him from playing in Bradford's first three pre-season friendly matches.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> His suspension also kept him out of Bradford's first two games of the season,<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> but he returned for a 2–0 victory against <a href="Macclesfield_Town_F.C." title="wikilink">Macclesfield Town</a>. He provided a cross for <a href="Peter_Thorne_(footballer)" title="wikilink">Peter Thorne</a> to open the scoring after ten minutes.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> Colbeck helped City to go top of the league six matches into the season, and although he scored his first goal of the season in the seventh game, City lost 3–1 to <a href="A.F.C._Bournemouth" title="wikilink">Bournemouth</a>.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> He added a second in a 2–2 home draw with <a href="Gillingham_F.C." title="wikilink">Gillingham</a>,<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> before he broke a bone in his foot the following week against Grimsby Town.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> Colbeck was unable to play for nearly three months. He returned from injury in January by playing in two reserve games,<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> leading up to his first-team return on 24 January as a late second-half substitute for <a href="Omar_Daley" title="wikilink">Omar Daley</a> in a 3&lt;U+2013&gt;3 draw with <a href="Luton_Town_F.C." title="wikilink">Luton Town</a>.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a><a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> Colbeck broke back into the starting eleven the following month, once again for Daley, who was ruled out for the season with his own knee injury.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> He was a regular in the team for the rest of the season, playing a further 16 games but he struggled for form<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> and was unable to add to his two goals.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a></p>
<p>City missed out on promotion and as a result had to cut their wage budget.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a> However, Colbeck, whose contract had expired, was offered a new three-year deal on improved terms. He turned down the offer and stayed at the club on a week-to-week basis on his previous terms.<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> He was watched in a pre-season friendly playing for City against <a href="Bradford_Park_Avenue_A.F.C." title="wikilink">Bradford Park Avenue</a> by his former Darlington boss Dave Penney, who had since been appointed Oldham Athletic manager.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a> Colbeck started the season with Bradford and played another five games, bringing his total to the club to 109, of which 41 were as substitute.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a></p>

<p>Colbeck left Bradford in September 2009, on the final day of the summer transfer window to join Penney at League One side Oldham Athletic. The transfer fee was undisclosed, with Bradford entitled to a sum because of Colbeck's age<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a> – the <em><a href="Yorkshire_Post" title="wikilink">Yorkshire Post</a></em> newspaper reported the fee to be around &lt;U+00A3&gt;60,000.<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a> Penney described Colbeck as being in &quot;the <a href="Stanley_Matthews" title="wikilink">Stanley Matthews</a> mould&quot;<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a> and hoped his new signing would give his team some width.<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a> Colbeck's Oldham debut at the end of the same week finished in a 3&lt;U+2013&gt;0 defeat for his new team to <a href="Hartlepool_United_F.C." title="wikilink">Hartlepool United</a>.<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a> Although described as a &quot;tireless worker&quot;,<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a> some of his performances angered Oldham's fans, with Colbeck unable to &quot;stamp his authority on games&quot; and his &quot;lack of quality&quot; to deliver a final cross.<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a><a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a> In what was his first game for more than a month, Colbeck scored his first Oldham goal in a 4–2 defeat to <a href="Swindon_Town_F.C." title="wikilink">Swindon Town</a> on 9 February 2010.<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a><a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a> Colbeck also missed part of Oldham's run-in to the end of the season because of an ankle injury<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a> and ended up playing 28 games during his first season with Oldham,<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a> but was one of three summer signings which the <em><a href="Oldham_Advertiser" title="wikilink">Oldham Advertiser</a></em> said had not impressed the Latics fans.<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a> When Penney was sacked at the end of the campaign and replaced by <a href="Paul_Dickov" title="wikilink">Paul Dickov</a>, Colbeck was made available for transfer ahead of the 2010–11 season.<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a></p>
