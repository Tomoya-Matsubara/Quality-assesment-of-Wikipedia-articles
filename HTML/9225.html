<p>&quot;<strong>This Is It</strong>&quot; is a song written by Canadian singer <a href="Paul_Anka" title="wikilink">Paul Anka</a> and the American musician <a href="Michael_Jackson" title="wikilink">Michael Jackson</a>. The song was recorded by Jackson and featured as a track on his sixth posthumous album, <em><a href="Michael_Jackson&#39;s_This_Is_It:_The_Music_That_Inspired_the_Movie" title="wikilink">This Is It</a></em> (2009), which accompanies the <a href="Sony_Pictures" title="wikilink">Sony Pictures</a> motion picture release <em><a href="Michael_Jackson&#39;s_This_Is_It" title="wikilink">Michael Jackson's This Is It</a></em>. The song was premiered worldwide on Jackson's official website on October 12, 2009.</p>
<p>The song is the only airplay single off of Jackson's compilation album released by <a href="Epic_Records" title="wikilink">Epic Records</a>. The song is a <a href="power_ballad" title="wikilink">power ballad</a> with lyrics that describe falling and being in love with someone. The instrumentation includes <a href="piano" class="uri" title="wikilink">piano</a>, guitar, percussion, and strings. Jackson's version, styled as a pop ballad, was his first song to chart on <em><a href="Billboard_(magazine)" title="wikilink">Billboard</a></em>s <a href="Hot_Adult_Contemporary_Tracks" title="wikilink">Hot Adult Contemporary Chart</a> in over seventeen years. Sony misleadingly referred to the song as a &quot;new single&quot; during its promotion, but it was later confirmed that the song would only be <a href="radio_airplay" title="wikilink">released to radio</a>, and not be available to buy or <a href="Music_download" title="wikilink">download as a single</a> release. The song was generally well received by critics and had a good chart performance; it become a top twenty hit on charts in Japan and Spain, and peaked at number eighteen on both <em>Billboard</em>'s Adult Contemporary and R&amp;B/Pop song charts.</p>
<p>According to Anka, the song was recorded in 1983 and was intended to be a duet between him and Jackson on his <em>Walk A Fine Line</em> album under the title &quot;I Never Heard&quot;, but these plans fell-through. Thereafter, recording artist <a href="Sa-Fire" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sa-Fire</a> recorded the song for her second studio album, <em><a href="I_Wasn&#39;t_Born_Yesterday" title="wikilink">I Wasn't Born Yesterday</a></em> (1991). While putting together the <em>This Is It</em> album, Jackson's demo version of the song was found. His brothers' vocals and additional instrumentation were then added to the recording. The song was accompanied by one <a href="music_video" title="wikilink">music video</a>. The video was directed by <a href="Spike_Lee" title="wikilink">Spike Lee</a>, and consisted of footage of Jackson as a child and clips of him throughout his career. It also featured footage of tributes from Jackson's fans around the world.</p>
