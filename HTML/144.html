The film is actor <a href="Dustin_Hoffman" title="wikilink">Dustin Hoffman</a>'s directorial debut.</p>
<h2 id="plot">Plot</h2>
<p>The plot takes place in <a href="Thomas_Beecham" title="wikilink">Beecham</a> House, a <a href="retirement_home" title="wikilink">retirement home</a> for former professional musicians, patterned after the real-life <a href="Casa_di_Riposo_per_Musicisti" title="wikilink">Casa di Riposo per Musicisti</a> founded by <a href="Giuseppe_Verdi" title="wikilink">Giuseppe Verdi</a>.</p>
<p>Reg, Wilf and Cissy are retired <a href="opera" class="uri" title="wikilink">opera</a> singers who often worked together in the past; among other residents are Cedric Livingstone, a former director, and diva Anne Langley. All the guests in the retirement home continue to be engaged in their former professions in one way or the other, including lecturing and initiating young people to music.</p>
<p>Finances threaten closure of the home but proceeds from a yearly gala concert on Verdi's birthday hold hope for a continuation of the place. However, Cedric has been rather desperate due to the fact that some of the most prominent singers have either died or decided not to participate at all. Reg, Wilf and Cissy, were in the cast of a very highly rated recording of the opera <em><a href="Rigoletto" class="uri" title="wikilink">Rigoletto</a></em>, which includes a famous quartet for soprano, mezzo-soprano, tenor, and baritone. This version is very prominent amongst opera buffs as THE <em>Rigoletto</em> of the post-war era.</p>
<p>One day, Reg is shocked to find his former wife Jean Horton, the missing soprano of the <em>Rigoletto</em> recording, turning up to live at Beecham House. Reg is angry not to have been warned as their parting was on very sour terms.</p>
<p>At first Jean tries unsuccessfully to mend things with Reg. In the ensuing conversations her infidelity arises, as well as her past marriages, but Reg comes to understand that all that is past. In the meantime, Wilf and Cissy convince Cedric that bringing together those who sang the quartet on the famous recording to sing it again for the Verdi Gala concert will sell enough tickets to save the home. Enchanted with the idea, they convince Reg to overcome his objections to performing with Jean again. However, she is harder to persuade as she vowed never to sing again after retiring.</p>
<p>Cissy takes Jean flowers from the garden to cheer her up and asks if she wishes to discuss the quartet, but Jean becomes violent and attacks Cissy, which only aggravates Cissy's already delicate senile condition. Jean apologises and is finally convinced to sing in the quartet from <em>Rigoletto</em>, &quot;<a href="Bella_figlia_dell&lt;U+2019&gt;amore" title="wikilink">Bella figlia dell&lt;U+2019&gt;amore</a>&quot;, after learning that Anne Langley will be singing &quot;<a href="Vissi_d&#39;arte" title="wikilink">Vissi d'arte</a>&quot; from <em><a href="Tosca" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tosca</a></em>. The group prepares for their performance and, moments before their curtain call, Cissy gets very confused and attempts to walk out the door, saying that she has to go back to her family, but Jean manages to salvage the situation. During her conversation with Cissy, Jean expresses regret for all her past bad behaviour towards Reg and admits that she is still in love with him. Reg overhears this.</p>
<p>Just as the recital is about to start, the director of the home is amazed at the energy displayed by the guests of the home. The idea of rehearsing and playing before an audience brings life back to them, leading her to the conclusion that old age and art go together. As they are about to enter the stage, Reg asks Jean to marry him again, and once on stage she whispers her agreement.</p>

<h2 id="production">Production</h2>
<p>Headline Pictures' Mark Shivas and Stewart Mackinnon acquired the film rights to the play from Ronnie Harwood and, with funding from BBC Films, commissioned him to write the screenplay. Mackinnon then approached a number of co-producers and directors, and eventually contracted the producer Finola Dwyer and director Dustin Hoffman. Sadly, Mark Shivas died before the film was completed.</p>
