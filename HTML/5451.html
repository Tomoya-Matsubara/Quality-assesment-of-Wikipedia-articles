Text reads in Mongolian language: &quot;Cherish our history, embrace our freedom, develop our country&quot;" width="300" /> During his studies in the USSR, Elbegdorj learned about <a href="Glasnost" class="uri" title="wikilink">Glasnost</a> and concepts such as freedom of speech and economic liberties. After returning to Mongolia, he met with other like-minded people and tried to present those ideas to a wider audience, despite attempts of repression from the Politburo and threats by his employer to lose his job. When giving a speech at Young Artists&lt;U+2019&gt; Second National Congress on 28 November 1989, in the end of his speech, Elbegdorj said that Mongolia needed democracy and appealed youth to collaborate and organize together to establish democracy in Mongolia. He told the audience &lt;U+201C&gt;We consider that <a href="Perestroika" class="uri" title="wikilink">Perestroika</a> is a timely and brave step. Youth's contribution to this revolutionary matter is not by supportive talks but by certain work. Our contribution is our objectives to be fulfilled. Our objectives are: &lt;U+201C&gt;&lt;U+2026&gt;following democracy and transparency and contributing to glasnost, &lt;U+2026&gt; and to support truthful progressive power&lt;U+2026&gt;These are the objectives of an initiatives&lt;U+2019&gt; group. The group should be an organization that works. After the congress I hope we&lt;U+2019&gt;ll gather and discuss and you will participate in this (newly forming group). The organization shall be based on public, voluntary and democratic principles.&lt;U+201D&gt;<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a></p>
<p>The chairman of the congress stopped Elbegdorj's speech and warned him he could not say such things. It was 1989 and Mongolia had been a communist country for 68 years. At that time, it was alleged that one out of two people was an unofficial spy of communist party that would oppress people who expressed different opinions than socialism and communism. During the break of the congress, two young individuals met Elbegdorj and the three agreed to initiate a democratic movement and to secretly spread the news to other young people. Later the three, including Elbegdorj met and united with ten other individuals and they are known as the Thirteen Leaders of Mongolia's Democratic Revolution. At his return from the congress, his boss at the newspaper <em>Ulaan Od</em> warned Elbegdorj that he would be fired if he participated further in any activities out of work or engaged in any conduct inconsistent with communist and socialist ideology. Despite the warning, Elbegdorj and his friends met secretly with other young people in the circle auditorium of the <a href="National_University_of_Mongolia" title="wikilink">National University of Mongolia</a> and discussed democracy, free market economic policy, and other prohibited subjects of the time, and began to draft a plan to organize a democratic movement. They met many times and brought new friends and new supporters to join them secretly. One night they placed ads of their open demonstration in streets.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a></p>
<p>On the morning of 10 December 1989, the first open pro-democracy demonstration met in front of the Youth Cultural Center in Ulaanbaatar. There, Elbegdorj announced the creation of the Mongolian Democratic Union. Over the next months activists led by Elbegdorj and others continued to organize demonstrations, rallies, protests and hunger strikes, as well as teachers' and workers' strikes. Activists had growing support from Mongolia's people, both in the capital and the countryside and the union's activities led to other calls for democracy all over the country.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a><a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a><a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a><a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a><a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a></p>
<p>After numerous demonstrations of many thousands of people in the capital city as well as provincial centers, Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party(MPRP) (present <a href="Mongolian_People&#39;s_Party" title="wikilink">Mongolian People's Party</a>)'s Politburo &lt;U+2013&gt; the authority of the government eventually gave way to the pressure and entered negotiations with the leaders of the democratic movement. In February 1990, <a href="Jambyn_Batm&lt;U+00F6&gt;nkh" title="wikilink">Jambyn Batm&lt;U+00F6&gt;nkh</a>, chairman of Politburo of MPRP's Central Committee decided to dissolve the Politburo and to resign on 9 March 1990. Thus paved the way for the first multi-party elections in Mongolia. Elbegdorj announced this news to the hunger strikers and the people those gathered on Sukhbaatar Square at 10PM on that day after the negotiations between leaders of MPRP and Mongolian Democratic Union. As a result, Mongolia became the first country in Central Asia to embrace democracy.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> Elbegdorj worked as the Leader of the Mongolian Democratic Union in 1989&lt;U+2013&gt;1997.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a></p>

During his work as the editor-in-chief, Elbegdorj spread information on the core values of democracy and every Mongolian should have the rights and freedom defined by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. His articles and newspaper policy helped to change social thinking in Mongolia. In 1990 Elbegdorj initiated to introduce the freedom of press in Mongolia.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a></p>

<h2 id="legislative-career">Legislative career</h2>
<p>Elbegdorj was elected to the Parliament four times, in 1990, 1992, 1996 and 2008. As a Member of People's Congress, Elbegdorj co-drafted and co-adopted Mongolia's new Constitution on 13 January 1992.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> The new Constitution guaranteed human rights, democracy, freedom of religion, and free speech.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> He worked as the vice speaker of the Parliament of Mongolia in 1996&lt;U+2013&gt;1998<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> and the majority leader of the Parliament in 1996&lt;U+2013&gt;2000.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a></p>
<p>Elbegdorj founded and worked as the head of Mongolia's first Entrepreneurs Association in 1991 as well. The association worked and helped to privatize livestock for free to their herders from the socialist collective farms. As a result, providing the first private property to almost half of Mongolia's entire population.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> He supported the privatization of state-owned assets and land.</p>
<p>While as the chairman of the State Commission on Rehabilitation, Elbegdorj initiated and brought the state to apologize for the victims and families of over 36,000 people that had been persecuted and mass massacred during the years of <a href="Mongolian_People&#39;s_Party" title="wikilink">Mongolian People's Party</a>'s communist rule.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> He played a key role in the approval of the Rehabilitation Law, which provided rehabilitation and compensation to the survivors and families of political victims, and recovery from the Stalinist purges and prohibited future violation of human rights. In addition, the law established a Memorial Day for Political Victims.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a></p>
<p>Elbegdorj, as the chairman of the <a href="Democratic_Party_(Mongolia)" title="wikilink">Democratic Party</a>, co-led the <a href="Democratic_Union_Coalition" title="wikilink">Democratic Union Coalition</a> to its historic victory in the <a href="Mongolian_legislative_election,_1996" title="wikilink">1996 parliamentary election</a>. He served as the majority leader of the <a href="State_Great_Hural" title="wikilink">State Great Hural</a> (Parliament) in 1996-2000 and as the vice speaker of the Parliament in 1996-1998.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a></p>

<h2 id="prime-minister">Prime Minister</h2>
<p>He served as the Prime Minister of Mongolia twice in 1998 and 2004&lt;U+2013&gt;2006.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="first-term-as-prime-minister">First term as Prime Minister</h3>
<p>In 1998, a clause in the constitution was removed that prohibited members of parliament to take cabinet responsibility. Thus on 23 April 1998, Parliament elected (61&lt;U+2013&gt;6) Elbegdorj as the Prime Minister.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> During his first term, Elbegdorj attempted to solve looming economic, political, structural and social issues through several policy initiatives such as co-initiating Law on Press Freedom and playing a key role to pass the law in 1998.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a> Based on this law, another law passed that changed all daily state newspapers into public newspapers without direct control and censorship from the government.</p>
<p>Elbegdorj's most significant achievement during his first term as Prime Minister was to collect tax and create tax income. The biggest tax payer and only significant income contributor to the government's budget at the time was the copper ore mining and processing Erdenet Mining Corporation(EMC) &lt;U+2013&gt; a joint stock company owned by the governments of Mongolia and the Russian Federation. EMC hadn't paid due tax, income and royalty to Mongolia's government between 1997&lt;U+2013&gt;1998 which resulted in the government financial crumbling.<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> Because of this, previous Prime Minister Enkhsaikhan stepped down due to pressure from the opposition party, MPRP. After becoming Prime Minister, Elbegdorj ordered an audit of EMC. The audit results revealed that the state due income did not enter the state account, instead it went to dubious accounts of directors at EMC. This corruption related case was reported in detail in investigative series &quot;Swindle of the Century&quot; on Eagle television.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a> Elbegdorj dismissed the EMC's chairman. As a result, the government began to receive due tax, royalty and income from the EMC.</p>
<p>In addition, at the recommendations of international financial institutions such as International Monetary Fund and the World Bank &lt;U+2013&gt; aid granters to Mongolia, and discount interest rate loan giver Asian Development Bank, Elbegdorj made a decision to sell state owned Reconstruction Bank which became illiquid and was experiencing enormous loss, the biggest financial burden to the economy since its establishment in 1997.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a> <a href="Golomt_Bank" title="wikilink">Golomt Bank</a> was the only one that offered to buy Reconstruction Bank.</p>
<p>In response to this and the change of EMC's chairman, the minority group at the Parliament MPRP demanded Elbegdorj to resign and thus resulted Elbegdorj to lose confidence vote at the Parliament.<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a> The Parliament had prevented Elbegdorj's government from selling the bank. Elbegdorj's decision to sell the Reconstruction Bank was proven to be correct. The bank bankrupted soon after Elbegdorj's first term as prime minister was over and resulting the bankruptcy led the government to suffer enormous amount of financial loss. Moreover, Elbegdorj assisted to complete the construction of Mongolia's first Wrestling Palace which was half built for a long time. He stayed in office until Janlavyn Narantsatsralt replaced him on 9 December 1998.<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="second-term-as-prime-minister">Second term as Prime Minister</h3>
<p>On 20 August 2004, Elbegdorj became a Prime Minister of Mongolia for the second time, despite not being a member of parliament.<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a> This time he headed a grand coalition government after the vote in the <a href="Mongolian_legislative_election,_2004" title="wikilink">parliamentary elections</a> had been evenly split between the two major political forces &lt;U+2013&gt; Democratic Coalition and the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party.<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a></p>
<p>In his second term in the government, Elbegdorj proclaimed a fight against corruption and poverty, which he saw as the biggest challenges to Mongolia's economic development.<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a> Besides, Elbegdorj initiated a &quot;Green Wall&quot; environmental project to plant trees in barren areas and desert zones to prevent from dust storm coming from Mongolia to Asia and to reduce air pollution.<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a></p>
<p>During Elbegdorj's term, on 27 January 2005, the government controlled National State Television and Radio were converted into formally independent organisations with increasingly smaller control by the government.<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a> Also, legal provisions that prohibited demonstrations on Ulaanbaatar's <a href="S&lt;U+00FC&gt;khbaatar_Square" title="wikilink">S&lt;U+00FC&gt;khbaatar Square</a> were abolished.<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a> To promote affordable computers and internet access, he established Information and Communication Agency under the government. He attempted to strengthen domestic businesses by reducing the administrative overhead, by eliminating excessive regulations, many licensing requirements, and import taxes for key product categories.<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a> During Elbegdorj's term, Mongolia was accepted into the <a href="European_Union" title="wikilink">European Union</a>'s <a href="Generalized_System_of_Preferences" title="wikilink">GSP+</a> system,<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a> which allows Mongolian exporters to pay lower customs tariffs when exporting to the European Union. He subsidized and supported technical schools and specialized professions to reduce unemployment.</p>
<p>By a decision of his government English replaced Russian as the first foreign language to be taught in public schools.<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a> In addition, Elbegdorj initiated the erection of the Genghis Khan memorial complex in front of Mongolia's <a href="Government_Palace_(Mongolia)" title="wikilink">government house</a> for the 800th Anniversary of the Great Mongol Empire. He also proposed to relocate Mongolia's capital to <a href="Harhorin" class="uri" title="wikilink">Harhorin</a>, a small town 400 km west of Ulaanbaatar, at the site of the former (until the 1260s) capital of the <a href="Mongol_Empire" title="wikilink">Mongol Empire</a>. U.S. President <a href="George_W._Bush" title="wikilink">George W.

<p>Elbegdorj's administration revealed the Customs chairman's corruption case amounting to millions of dollars from which the ex-chairman donated to MPRP party with hundreds of thousands of dollars in 2005.<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a> In August 2005, Elbegdorj wanted to run for by-elections in Ulaanbaatar's <a href="Bayangol,_Ulan_Bator" title="wikilink">Bayangol d&lt;U+00FC&gt;&lt;U+00FC&gt;reg</a>. However, the MPRP threatened to leave the coalition if Elbegdorj ran against MPRP candidate <a href="Miyeegombyn_Enkhbold" title="wikilink">Miyeegombyn Enkhbold</a>, and Elbegdorj withdrew.<a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a> On 13 January 2006, the MPRP left the coalition anyway, and Elbegdorj was forced to resign. The MPRP proceeded to form a new government with the help of DP defectors and independent MPs, and Miyeegombyn Enkhbold became the new prime minister.

<p>In 2012, following his talks at the Parliament of Kyrgyzstan and meeting with Kyrgyz NGO leaders and students to share Mongolia's experience towards democracy for two decades, Elbegdorj began the establishment of the Democratic Transition Assistance Foundation of Mongolia. The new initiative calls for the allocation of certain funds from Mongolian budget to be used in support of democratic transitions in Kyrgyzstan and Afghanistan along with economic reforms in countries such as North Korea and Myanmar while using Mongolia's democratic reform and consolidation as a model.

The United Nations <a href="Security_Council" title="wikilink">Security Council</a> recognized Mongolia's nuclear-weapon-free status in 2012 despite the fact that it cannot join one of the World's Nuclear-Weapon-Free-Zones, in part, because of the country's close proximity to nuclear-armed states Russia and China.<a href="#fn99" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref99"><sup>99</sup></a><img src="President_Tsakhia_Elbegdorj_of_Mongolia_with_President_Barack_Obama_of_the_US.jpg" title="fig:Elbegdorj meeting with President Obama in June 2011" alt="Elbegdorj meeting with President Obama in June 2011" width="320" />Mongolia renounced nuclear materials and became a member of <a href="Organization_for_Security_and_Co-operation_in_Europe" title="wikilink">Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe</a> in 2013 and UN General Assembly's President Vuk Jeremic congratulated Elbegdorj for these.<a href="#fn100" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref100"><sup>100</sup></a></p>

Iran's nuclear program must not endanger or cause threat to the interests and security of regional peace as well as of any other nation.

Previously, during his terms as a prime minister, he worked to uncover and eliminate several corruption scandals including his handling of the Erdenet Mining Corporation's tax scandal,<a href="#fn110" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref110"><sup>110</sup></a><a href="#fn111" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref111"><sup>111</sup></a> and his administration dug out the Customs chairman's corruption case in 2005.<a href="#fn112" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref112"><sup>112</sup></a></p>

<p>Elbegdorj sees <a href="Genghis_Khan" title="wikilink">Chinggis Khaan</a> (also referred to as Genghis Khan) as a leader from whom to learn for anti-corruption efforts as Genghis Khan sought equal protection under the law for all citizens regardless of status or wealth. &quot;Chinggis...was a man who deeply realized that the justice begins and consolidates with the equality of law, and not with the distinctions between people. He was a man who knew that the good laws and rules lived longer than fancy palaces,&quot; Elbegdorj said in his speech on the 850th anniversary of Chinggis Khaan's birth.<a href="#fn117" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref117"><sup>117</sup></a></p>
<p>Under Elbegdorj's presidency, corruption cases amounting from millions to hundreds of millions of dollars, ranging from misappropriation of state properties and assets such as a printing factory and buildings, funds and taxes have been tried by the courts and the courts convicted high level statesmen including a former president of Mongolia,<a href="#fn118" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref118"><sup>118</sup></a><a href="#fn119" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref119"><sup>119</sup></a> a former chairman of Mineral Resources Authority, ex-chairmen of state owned Mongolian Airlines MIAT and their allies.

He stressed the importance of women in leadership, highlighting the three-fold increase of women representatives elected in the 2012 Mongolian parliamentary elections in his speech at the <a href="UN_General_Assembly" title="wikilink">UN General Assembly</a> in September 2012. &lt;U+201C&gt;We need more women leaders.

<p>In July 2012 during the meeting with Elbegdorj in Ulaanbaatar, U.S. Secretary of State <a href="Hillary_Rodham_Clinton" title="wikilink">Hillary Rodham Clinton</a> praised Mongolia's recent parliamentary elections in which nine women were elected and applauded Mongolia for its &quot;courage&quot; in building a democratic system in a country surrounded by Russia and China.<a href="#fn124" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref124"><sup>124</sup></a><a href="#fn125" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref125"><sup>125</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="citizens-chamber">Citizens Chamber</h3>
<p>In 2009, Elbegdorj opened the Citizens Chamber-a public hearing forum which encourages the participation of Mongolian citizens in the parliament's decision making. In each proceeding, citizens are given time to speak and express their opinion on pending legislation. The hall is open to any of Mongolia's 2.9 million people and is located in <a href="Ulaanbaatar" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ulaanbaatar</a>; some additional halls have been opened in other provinces.

<p>On 14 January 2010, Elbegdorj announced that he would, henceforth, systematically use his prerogative to pardon all persons <a href="sentenced_to_death" title="wikilink">sentenced to death</a>. He stated that <a href="Use_of_capital_punishment_by_nation" title="wikilink">most countries in the world had abolished the death penalty</a>, and Mongolia should follow their example. He suggested that it would be replaced with a thirty year prison sentence. The decision was controversial; when Elbegdorj announced it in <a href="State_Great_Khural" title="wikilink">Parliament</a>, <a href="MPRP" class="uri" title="wikilink">MPRP</a> represesentatives chose not to give the applause customarily due after a presidential speech.<a href="#fn128" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref128"><sup>128</sup></a> (See: <a href="Capital_punishment_in_Mongolia" title="wikilink">Capital punishment in Mongolia</a>)</p>
<p>Despite the harsh criticism from conservative politicians and the opposition, Elbegdorj's decision to abolish the death penalty and his insistence on adopting the 2nd Optional Protocol to the Convention on Civil and Political Rights was received highly among other nations around the world.&quot;Hands off Cain&quot; international organization awarded Elbegdorj with &quot;Abolitionist of the Year 2011&quot; noting Mongolia as an example that fosters the right to life among Asian countries.<a href="#fn129" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref129"><sup>129</sup></a></p>
<p>&quot;By ratifying the Second Optional Protocol Mongolia would add yet one more country in the world community to fully abolish the death penalty. Pardoning a life does not mean pardoning a penalty. The punishment for serious and cruel felonies must be severe, and must be just. However, I do not think it is just to deprive any citizens of life in the name of state. The right to life is one of fundamental rights of a human being and cannot depend on anyone, not even on the head of state. The state should respect very fundamental human rights, and secure them by law.&quot; Elbegdorj noted.<a href="#fn130" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref130"><sup>130</sup></a> Finally, in 2012 Mongolian parliament amended a law to join the 2nd Optional Protocol to the Convention on Civil and Political Rights; making Mongolia a state party to the convention and reinforcing the country's commitment to the abolition of capital punishment.<a href="#fn131" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref131"><sup>131</sup></a></p>

<p>At the invitation of Elbegdorj, the <a href="World_Economic_Forum" title="wikilink">World Economic Forum</a>-Water Resources Group and Office of the President of Mongolia co-organized the <em>Water Secure Future in Mongolia</em> conference in Ulaanbaatar in which over 100 government officials, parliamentarians, civil society and private sector representatives participated to find ways to safeguard Mongolia&lt;U+2019&gt;s scarce water resources in the context of its rapid economic growth. They discussed about water use in the mining, agricultural and municipal sectors, shared case studies of international good practice for boosting water efficiency and ways of safeguarding Mongolia&lt;U+2019&gt;s water supplies. As a result, Elbegdorj and <a href="Peter_Brabeck-Letmathe" title="wikilink">Peter Brabeck-Letmathe</a>, Chairman of the World Economic Forum-Water Resources Group and Member of the World Economic Forum Foundation Board, committed to form a Mongolian Water Alliance of key government entities, civil society representatives and private sector participants to support the transformation of Mongolia&lt;U+2019&gt;s water sector. Elbegdorj defined the purpose of the alliance by saying &lt;U+201C&gt;Managing our future water needs is key to sustaining Mongolia&lt;U+2019&gt;s economic growth. We must ensure fast and effective implementation of our National Water Plan. We will benefit from the international networks and experience of the Water Resources Group to help us do so.&lt;U+201D&gt;<a href="#fn139" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref139"><sup>139</sup></a></p>

<p>Elbegdorj met Khajidsurengiin Bolormaa at a Mongolian students&lt;U+2019&gt; party in Lviv, Ukraine when they were students. After their marriage in <a href="Ulaanbaatar" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ulaanbaatar</a>, their first son was born in Lviv, Ukraine. They helped over 300 orphans through their Bolor Foundation. They adopted twenty children from state run Orphan Care Center (<a href="orphanage" class="uri" title="wikilink">orphanage</a>) in Ulaanbaatar after being the children's patrons for some time.<a href="#fn161" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref161"><sup>161</sup></a> Now they have twenty five children: four sons of their own and twenty one adopted children.<a href="#fn162" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref162"><sup>162</sup></a><a href="#fn163" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref163"><sup>163</sup></a></p>
<p>&quot;Elbegdorj is a risk-taker and puts others' needs before his own. A long-time (U.S.) Embassy employee recalled Elbegdorj accompanying the embassy officials on a trip to deliver humanitarian assistance to the countryside during a winter disaster in the 1990s. The road was snowed under, and Elbegdorj volunteered to go ahead to check for alternate routes, despite freezing conditions and deep snow,&quot; an U.S. Ambassador to Mongolia described Elbegdorj in his confidential wire to the U.S. authorities that was leaked in wikileaks.org.<a href="#fn164" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref164"><sup>164</sup></a></p>
<p>Due to being president, Elbegdorj asked his elder brother Arslandorj to give up from his position as a director of City Landscaping Department of Ulaanbaatar City in which sector Arslandorj worked for more than 20 years prior to his brother's presidency.
