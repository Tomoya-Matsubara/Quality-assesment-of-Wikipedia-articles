<p><strong>Artavazd Ashoti Peleshyan</strong> is an Armenian film director and one of the most important documentarians in the history of film art.</p>
<p>He is renowned for developing a style of cinematographic perspective known as <a href="distance_montage" title="wikilink">distance montage</a>, combining perception of depth with oncoming entities, such as running packs of antelope or hordes of humans. Characteristic to him is also the use of archive footage alongside with his own shots and, especially, fast intercutting between these two. <a href="Telephoto_lens" title="wikilink">Telephoto lens</a> are often used to get &quot;candid camera&quot; shots of people engaging in mundane tasks.</p>
<p>His films are on the border between documentary and feature, rather reminding of the work of such avant-garde filmmakers as <a href="Bruce_Connor" title="wikilink">Bruce Connor</a> than of any kind of conventional documentaries. Most of his films are short, the longest being 60 minutes and the shortest 6 minutes long. His films feature no dialogue; however, music and sound effects play nearly as important a role in his films as the visual images in contributing towards the artistic whole. Nearly all of his films were shot in black and white.</p>
<p>Already his student films he made while he was studying at <a href="VGIK" class="uri" title="wikilink">VGIK</a> were awarded several prizes. As for now, 12 films by Peleshyan are known to exist. <em>The Beginning</em> (<em>Skizbe</em>) (<a href="1967" class="uri" title="wikilink">1967</a>) is a cinematographical essay about the <a href="October_Revolution" title="wikilink">October Revolution</a> of <a href="1917" class="uri" title="wikilink">1917</a>. One of the unique visual effects used in this film is achieved by holding snippets of film still on one frame, then advancing only for a second or two until again pausing on another, resulting in a stuttering visual effect. Other important films by him are <em>We</em> (<em>Menq</em>) (<a href="1967" class="uri" title="wikilink">1967</a>, a poetically told history of Armenia and its people and <em>Inhabitant</em> (<em>Obitateli</em>) (<a href="1970" class="uri" title="wikilink">1970</a>), a reflection on the relationship between wildlife and humans. Artavazd Peleshian's most brilliant film is &quot;The Seasons&quot; (1975), exquisitely cinematographed by another great Armenian documentarian <a href="Mikhail_Vartanov" title="wikilink">Mikhail Vartanov</a> (Vardanov) - it is an outstanding look at the contradiction and harmony between the humans and nature. <a href="http://www.parajanov.com/seasons.html" class="uri">http://www.parajanov.com/seasons.html</a></p>
<p>Peleshyan is also the author of a range of theoretical works, such as his 1988 book <em>Moyo kino</em> (<em>My Cinema</em>).</p>
<p>Being from a country far away from internationally significant cinema circles, Peleshyan's efforts were never been properly recognized by world cinema until very recently. After the fall of Soviet Union, he has been able to make two more short films, <em>Life</em> (<a href="1993" class="uri" title="wikilink">1993</a>) and <em>The End</em> (<a href="1994" class="uri" title="wikilink">1994</a>). He is now living in Moscow and suffering from a severe mental illness.</p>
