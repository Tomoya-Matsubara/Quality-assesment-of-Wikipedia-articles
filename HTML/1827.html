<p><strong>Void</strong> is a fictional character in the <a href="Wildstorm" class="uri" title="wikilink">Wildstorm</a> universe.</p>
<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<p>Adrianna Tereshkova was born in Arkhangelsk, Russia. Adrianna and her sister Svetlana were raised by their father after the death of their mother. Her father loved Adrianna and her ambition to become a cosmonaut and encouraged her with legends of the Archangel after whom the village was named. In their tales, the Archangel was a creature made of silver who would take chosen ones to the stars.</p>
<p>When Adrianna was sixteen, her sister died in a car accident. Adrianna never went to the funeral, but found comfort with a musician. Her father disapproved and one year after Svetlana's death, he confronted her, drunk. Adrianna was his sadness and dedicated herself to becoming a cosmonaut again.</p>
<p>Adrianna achieved the rank of major and was sent into outer space on July 28th, 1980, 3 months after her father died of heart failure. In space, during <a href="extra-vehicular_activity" title="wikilink">extra-vehicular activity</a>, Adrianna saw a sphere made of silver, which collided with their space shuttle, destroying it. A second sphere landed on Earth in <a href="Antarctica" class="uri" title="wikilink">Antarctica</a> where it was collected by the American government organization International Operations (I.O.).</p>
<p>In the far future, the spheres had been part of Omnia, Mistress of Light. Omnia would lose her final battle against the darkness, but could not be destroyed. Instead, her power was dispersed into many small Orbs of Power. Another of these Orbs was bound to Cassandra Newland, who would turn into the enigmatic 'Providence'.</p>
<p>The Orb and Adrianna merged and became Void. Void had precognition allowing her to see the future, but her control was imperfect and she could see only fragments. In 1990, Void met <a href="Lord_Emp" title="wikilink">Jacob Marlowe</a>, a homeless drifter who suffered <a href="amnesia" class="uri" title="wikilink">amnesia</a>. Void informed Jacob about his past as the <a href="Kherubim" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kherubim</a> Lord Emp. Over the next two years, Emp would build a financial empire and gathered a group of warriors to form the <a href="Wildcats_(comics)" title="wikilink">WildC.A.T.s</a>. Void created them to prevent the <a href="Daemonite" class="uri" title="wikilink">Daemonite</a> <a href="Helspont" class="uri" title="wikilink">Helspont</a> from abusing the Orb of Power I.O. had found. Before Helspont could use it, a criminal known as the Gnome stole the Orb. He too tried to abuse it, but Emp threw the Orb into a cold fusion reactor. Void revealed that in a previous timeline, the Gnome had killed her, but part of her was able to go back in time and influenced Void to get help before battling the Gnome.</p>
<p>During her time with the WildC.A.T.s, Void came to learn of two other Orbs of power: Providence had become a member of Helspont's Cabal and often came in conflict with the WildC.A.T.s. The other Orb was in the possession of the mad Kherubim Lord Entropy. When Entropy kidnapped Emp and restored his memory, Void sensed the use of the Orb and took the WildC.A.T.s to him. They defeated Entropy and he and the Orb disappeared. Shortly afterwards, Void fought Providence, who had allied with the witch Tapestry. Tapestry betrayed Providence by refusing to hand over the captive Void to her. Tapestry used her magic to merge Providence and Void, enslaving them both. Tapestry was defeated though and Providence and Void returned to normal, though now they could no longer sense each other's presence.</p>
<p>When the WildC.A.T.s faced the alien Crusade, Crusade hit Void, dislodging her face. Her face fell like mask to the floor and human reporters saw that there was nothing but emptiness behind it. Confronted with her loss of humanity, Void fled. When she returned <a href="Savant_(Wildstorm)" title="wikilink">Savant</a> helped her deal with her loss by talking to the reporters telling them about the sacrifices she made for the human race. Void convinced Lord Emp to return to the WildC.A.T.s and her powers of time travel were essential during their following mission battling the time-travelling Puritans who wanted to prevent the Kherubim and Daemonites from ever landing on Earth. The strain of being a temporal anchor and making several timejumps were too much for Void and she disappeared, leaving the WildC.A.T.s stranded in ancient Rome. She eventually made her way back to the present due to the Gnome trying to recreate his Orb of Power. Void's essence was used for the Orb, but <a href="DV8" class="uri" title="wikilink">DV8</a> interfered with his plans and their member <a href="Copycat_(Wildstorm)" title="wikilink">Copycat</a>, guided by Providence, managed to restore Void to her regular self. Soon afterwards, the WildC.A.T.s disbanded following the apparent death of <a href="Zealot_(Wildstorm)" title="wikilink">Zealot</a>.</p>
<p>Void became more and more inhuman over the years; where Void and Adrianna were once one and the same, now their personalities started to diverge. Finally Adrianna had enough; Void's inhumanity was driving her insane. Inside her mind, Adrianna and Void met and Adrianna asked Void to finally release her soul. Void agreed as she no longer needed a human host.</p>
<p>Adrianna's spirit moved on and Void appeared in the <a href="Halo_Corporation" title="wikilink">Halo Corporation</a>, home of former Wildcat <a href="Spartan_(comics)" title="wikilink">Spartan</a>, now known as Jack Marlowe. Void started working for Jack Marlowe, who was studying Void's ability to teleport. When she teleported, Void moved through Otherspace, a dimension filled with energy. Marlowe's assistant, Noir, saw the possibilities in harvesting Otherspace, but he saw Void as a threat. He sabotaged a nuclear reactor, causing a leak. The leak caused Void's physical form to slowly break down. Marlowe did what he could to cure Void, but in the end found out that without Adrianna, Void had no will to live. Marlowe offered his robotic body as a new host and Void and Marlowe, merged, vastly increasing Marlowe's already impressive powers.</p>
<p>See <a href="Spartan_(comics)" title="wikilink">Spartan</a> for more about Jack Marlowe's time as host of the Void-entity.</p>
<p>In recent issues of <em><a href="Mister_Majestic" title="wikilink">Majestic</a></em> and in the mini-series <a href="Captain_Atom" title="wikilink">Captain Atom: Armageddon</a>, it appears that Jack Marlowe has lost the Void Entity. How exactly this came to be is currently unknown. In Captain: Armageddon, Void has bound itself to a new host, a paramedic named Nikola Hanssen, while another part of it has bound itself to Captain Atom. Knowing what it feels like to be weak and scared in the Wildstorm Universe, Nikola willingly claimed her full powers from Captain Atom, with whom she shared a bond of love and trust, and used it to destroy and recreate a new Wildstorm Universe, known as the <a href="WorldStorm" class="uri" title="wikilink">WorldStorm</a>, as the Captain's universe was recreated in the same moment during the <a href="Infinite_Crisis" title="wikilink">Infinite Crisis</a>. Due to the <em>quantum jumping</em> powers of Captain Atom, Nikola was able to see him in her new Universe, but could not explain to him the creation of a new Universe. Apparently, Nikola Hanssen is the only one in the whole Wildstorm Universe to remember the reboot.</p>
<h2 id="powers-and-abilities">Powers and abilities</h2>
<p>Bound to the Void entity Adrianna had various powers. She could teleport a large group of people all over the planet, manipulate energy and grow in size (though she did the last one only once). She did not have the control over them that Providence has though and therefore she was not as powerful. Most importantly, Void could see fragments of the future and was instrumental in guiding the WildC.A.T.S. A downside to her powers was that as Void she was cold and distant, though she had emotions. When the Void entity became stronger, Void became more and more inhuman.</p>
<p>Her human appearance was deceiving; when sleeping, Void removed her face as if it were a mask and behind her face, there was only pink energy filling her metal form.</p>
<h2 id="trivia">Trivia</h2>
<p>In the WildC.A.T.S cartoon, the voice of Void was provided by Janet-Laine Green.</p>
