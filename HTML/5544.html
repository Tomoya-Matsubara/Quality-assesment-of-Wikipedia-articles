<p><strong>Janet Damita Jo Jackson</strong> (born May 16, 1966) is an American recording artist and actress. Born in <a href="Gary,_Indiana" title="wikilink">Gary, Indiana</a> and raised in <a href="Encino,_Los_Angeles,_California" title="wikilink">Encino, Los Angeles, California</a>, she is the youngest child of the <a href="Jackson_family" title="wikilink">Jackson family</a> of musicians. She first performed on stage with her family beginning at the age of seven, and later started her career as an actress with the <a href="variety_show" title="wikilink">variety</a> television series <em><a href="The_Jacksons_(TV_series)" title="wikilink">The Jacksons</a></em> in 1976. She went on to star in other television shows throughout the 1970s and early 1980s, including <em><a href="Good_Times" title="wikilink">Good Times</a></em> and <em><a href="Diff&#39;rent_Strokes" title="wikilink">Diff'rent Strokes</a></em>.</p>
<p>At age sixteen in 1982, Jackson signed a recording contract with <a href="A&amp;M_Records" title="wikilink">A&amp;M</a>, releasing her self-titled debut album the same year. She faced criticism for her limited vocal range, and for being yet another member of the Jackson family to become a recording artist. Beginning with her third studio album <em><a href="Control_(Janet_Jackson_album)" title="wikilink">Control</a></em> (1986), Jackson began a long-term collaboration with record producers <a href="Jimmy_Jam_and_Terry_Lewis" title="wikilink">Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis</a>. Her music with Jam and Lewis incorporated <a href="contemporary_R&amp;B" title="wikilink">contemporary R&amp;B</a> with elements of <a href="Rapping" title="wikilink">rap music</a>, <a href="sampling_(music)" title="wikilink">sample loop</a>, <a href="Swung_note" title="wikilink">triple swing</a> and <a href="industrial_music" title="wikilink">industrial</a> beats, which led to crossover appeal in <a href="popular_music" title="wikilink">popular music</a>. In addition to receiving recognition for the innovation in her albums, choreography, music videos, and prominence on <a href="MTV" class="uri" title="wikilink">MTV</a>, Jackson was acknowledged as a role model for her socially conscious lyrics.</p>
<p>In 1991, she signed the first of two record-breaking, multi-million dollar recording contracts with <a href="Virgin_Records" title="wikilink">Virgin Records</a>, which established her as one of the highest paid artists in the music industry. Her debut album under the Virgin label, <em><a href="janet." class="uri" title="wikilink">janet.</a></em> (1993), saw Jackson develop a public image as a <a href="sex_symbol" title="wikilink">sex symbol</a> as she began to explore sexuality in her work. That same year, she appeared in her first starring film role in <em><a href="Poetic_Justice_(1993_film)" title="wikilink">Poetic Justice</a></em>; since then she has continued to act in feature films. By the end of the decade, Jackson was named the second most successful recording artist of the 1990s. <em><a href="All_for_You_(album)" title="wikilink">All for You</a></em> (2001), became her fifth consecutive studio album to debut at number one the <a href="Billboard_200" title="wikilink"><em>Billboard</em> 200</a> album charts. In 2007, she changed labels, signing with the <a href="Island_Def_Jam_Music_Group" title="wikilink">Island Def Jam Music Group</a> and released her tenth studio album <em><a href="Discipline_(Janet_Jackson_album)" title="wikilink">Discipline</a></em> the following year.</p>

In March 1969, the group signed a record deal with <a href="Motown_Records" title="wikilink">Motown</a>, and by the end of the year they had recorded the first of four consecutive number one singles. The Jackson 5's success allowed the family to move to the <a href="Encino,_Los_Angeles,_California" title="wikilink">Encino</a> neighborhood of <a href="Los_Angeles,_California" title="wikilink">Los Angeles</a>, <a href="California" class="uri" title="wikilink">California</a> in 1971, where they settled in a gated mansion called Hayvenhurst.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> Although born into a family of professional musicians, Jackson, whose love of horses resulted in a desire to become a race-horse <a href="horse_jockey" title="wikilink">jockey</a>, had no aspiration to become an entertainer.

<p>Although Jackson was initially apprehensive about starting a music career, she agreed to participate in recording sessions with her family. The first of these, a duet with her brother Randy titled &quot;Love Song for Kids&quot;, took place in 1978. When Jackson was sixteen, her father arranged a contract for her with <a href="A&amp;M_Records" title="wikilink">A&amp;M Records</a>.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> Her debut album, <em><a href="Janet_Jackson_(album)" title="wikilink">Janet Jackson</a></em>, produced by <a href="soul_music" title="wikilink">soul</a> singers <a href="Angela_Winbush" title="wikilink">Angela Winbush</a>, <a href="Ren&lt;U+00E9&gt;_Moore" title="wikilink">Ren&lt;U+00E9&gt; Moore</a> and Leon F.

<p>Jackson's second album, <em><a href="Dream_Street_(album)" title="wikilink">Dream Street</a></em>, was released two years later. Her father recruited her brothers to help produce the album: Marlon co-wrote two of the album's tracks, while Tito, Jackie and Michael provided background vocals.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> <em>Dream Street</em> reached number nineteen on the R&amp;B albums chart; its sales were less than that of Jackson's debut album.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> The album's only hit, &quot;<a href="Don&#39;t_Stand_Another_Chance" title="wikilink">Don't Stand Another Chance</a>&quot;, peaked at number nine on <em>Billboard</em>{{'}}s R&amp;B singles chart.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> In late 1984, Jackson eloped with childhood friend and fellow R&amp;B singer <a href="James_DeBarge" title="wikilink">James DeBarge</a>.

<h3 id="u20131988-control">1986&lt;U+2013&gt;1988: <em>Control</em></h3>



<p>Following the release of <em>Dream Street</em>, Jackson decided to separate her business affairs from her family. She later commented, &quot;I remember trying to tell my father I no longer wanted him to manage me. It would have been easier to have Mother tell him for me, but that was something I had to do for myself.&quot;<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> Jackson also stated, &quot;I just wanted to get out of the house, get out from under my father, which was one of the most difficult things that I had to do, telling him that I didn't want to work with him again.&quot;<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> A&amp;M Records executive John McClain hired producers Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis to work with Jackson. Within six weeks, Jackson, Jam and Lewis crafted Jackson's third studio album, <em><a href="Control_(Janet_Jackson_album)" title="wikilink">Control</a></em>.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> Jackson recalled that during the recording of the album, she was threatened by a group of men outside of her hotel in Minneapolis. She stated that &quot;[t]he danger hit home when a couple of guys started stalking me on the street ... Instead of running to Jimmy or Terry for protection, I took a stand. I backed them down. That's how songs like 'Nasty' and 'What Have You Done for Me Lately' were born, out of a sense of self-defense.&quot;<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a></p>
<p>Though Jam and Lewis were concerned with achieving cross-over appeal, their primary goal was to create a strong following for the singer within the <a href="African-American" class="uri" title="wikilink">African-American</a> community first.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> Jam commented, &quot;[w]e wanted to do an album that would be in every black home in America ... we were going for <em>the</em> black album of all time.&quot;<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> Released in February 1986, the album peaked at number one on the <em>Billboard</em> 200.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> The <em><a href="Newsweek" class="uri" title="wikilink">Newsweek</a></em> review of <em>Control</em> noted that the album was &quot;an alternative to the sentimental balladry and opulent arrangements of <a href="Patti_LaBelle" title="wikilink">Patti LaBelle</a> and <a href="Whitney_Houston" title="wikilink">Whitney Houston</a>.&quot;<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> Rob Hoerburger of <em><a href="Rolling_Stone" title="wikilink">Rolling Stone</a></em> asserted, &quot;<em>Control</em> is a better album than <a href="Diana_Ross" title="wikilink">Diana Ross</a> has made in five years and puts Janet in a position similar to the young <a href="Donna_Summer" title="wikilink">Donna Summer</a>'s&lt;U+2014&gt;unwilling to accept novelty status and taking her own steps to rise above it.&quot;<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> Five of the album's singles&lt;U+2014&gt;&quot;<a href="What_Have_You_Done_for_Me_Lately" title="wikilink">What Have You Done for Me Lately</a>&quot;, &quot;<a href="Nasty_(song)" title="wikilink">Nasty</a>&quot;, &quot;<a href="When_I_Think_of_You" title="wikilink">When I Think of You</a>&quot;, &quot;<a href="Control_(Janet_Jackson_song)" title="wikilink">Control</a>&quot;, and &quot;<a href="Let&#39;s_Wait_Awhile" title="wikilink">Let's Wait Awhile</a>&quot;&lt;U+2014&gt;peaked within the top 5 of the <a href="Billboard_Hot_100" title="wikilink"><em>Billboard</em> Hot 100</a>.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> &quot;When I Think of You&quot; became Jackson's first single to peak at number one. &quot;<a href="The_Pleasure_Principle_(song)" title="wikilink">The Pleasure Principle</a>&quot; became a top 20 hit, peaking at number fourteen.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> Most of the <em>Control</em> music videos were choreographed by a then-unknown <a href="Paula_Abdul" title="wikilink">Paula Abdul</a>.

<p>In September 1989, Jackson released her fourth album, <em><a href="Janet_Jackson&#39;s_Rhythm_Nation_1814" title="wikilink">Janet Jackson's Rhythm Nation 1814</a></em>. Though executives at A&amp;M wanted an album similar to <em>Control</em>, Jackson was unwilling to compromise her artistic integrity, and was determined to imbue her music with a socially conscious message that complimented her songs about love and relationships.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> Jackson stated, &quot;I'm not naive&lt;U+2014&gt;I know an album or a song can't change the world.

<p>Jackson has a <a href="mezzo-soprano" class="uri" title="wikilink">mezzo-soprano</a> vocal range.<a href="#fn200" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref200"><sup>200</sup></a> <em>Rolling Stone</em> magazine observed, &quot;[h]er wispy voice was a pale echo of Michael's, but on Janet's albums&lt;U+2014&gt;and in her videos and live performances, which revealed a crisp, athletic dance technique not unlike her brother's&lt;U+2014&gt;singing wasn't the point&quot;, instead commenting that importance was instead placed on &quot;[h]er slamming beats, infectious hooks, and impeccable production values.&quot;<a href="#fn201" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref201"><sup>201</sup></a> Jackson's voice has also been praised on occasion. Eric Henderson of <em>Slant</em> claimed critics who judged Jackson harshly for her thin voice &quot;somehow missed the explosive 'gimme a beat' vocal pyrotechnics she unleashes all over 'Nasty' ... Or that they completely dismissed how perfect her tremulous hesitance fits into the abstinence anthem 'Let's Wait Awhile'.&quot;<a href="#fn202" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref202"><sup>202</sup></a> David Ritz of <em>Rolling Stone</em> compared Jackson's musical style to that of Marvin Gaye, stating, &quot;[l]ike Marvin, autobiography seemed the sole source of her music. Her art, also like Marvin's, floated over a reservoir of secret pain.&quot;<a href="#fn203" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref203"><sup>203</sup></a> Jackson has credited her older brothers Michael and Jermaine as her primary musical influences.<a href="#fn204" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref204"><sup>204</sup></a> She has also expressed reverence for <a href="Tina_Turner" title="wikilink">Tina Turner</a>, stating &quot;Tina has become a heroic figure for many people, especially women, because of her tremendous strength.

I felt her music was always there, and I feel like it always will be.&quot;<a href="#fn205" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref205"><sup>205</sup></a> Other artists attributed as influences on Jackson's music according to <em>Rolling Stone</em> are <a href="The_Ronettes" title="wikilink">The Ronettes</a>, <a href="Dionne_Warwick" title="wikilink">Dionne Warwick</a>, <a href="Tammi_Terrell" title="wikilink">Tammi Terrell</a> and Diana Ross.<a href="#fn206" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref206"><sup>206</sup></a>    Jackson's music has encompassed a broad range of genres, including R&amp;B, pop, soul, rap, hip hop, rock, and dance music. Qadree EI-Amin, Jackson's former personal manager, commented, &quot;[s]he's bigger than <a href="Barbra_Streisand" title="wikilink">Barbra Streisand</a> because Streisand can't appeal to the street crowd, as Janet does. But Streisand's rich, elite crowd loves Janet Jackson.&quot;<a href="#fn207" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref207"><sup>207</sup></a> When record producers Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis collaborated with Jackson on her 1986 album <em>Control</em>, Richard J. Ripani documented that the trio &quot;crafted a new sound that fuses the rhythmic elements of funk and disco, along with heavy doses of synthesizers, percussion, sound effects, and a rap music sensibility.&quot;<a href="#fn208" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref208"><sup>208</sup></a></p>
<p>Jackson has changed her lyrical focus over the years. Gillian G. Gaar, author of <em>She's a Rebel: The History of Women in Rock &amp; Roll</em> (2002), described <em>Control</em> as &quot;an autobiographical tale about her life with her parents, her first marriage, and breaking free.&quot;<a href="#fn209" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref209"><sup>209</sup></a> Rickey Vincent stated in his book <em>Funk: The Music, The People, and The Rhythm of The One</em> (1996) that <em>Janet Jackson's Rhythm Nation 1814</em> &quot;was the boldest and most successful pop attempt to combine social commentary, celebration, and state-of-the-art dance funk since her brother Michael's efforts to be <em><a href="Bad_(album)" title="wikilink">Bad</a></em>.&quot;<a href="#fn210" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref210"><sup>210</sup></a> On <em>janet.</em>, Jackson began to deal primarily with sexual themes. Joshua Klein wrote in <em><a href="The_Washington_Post" title="wikilink">The Washington Post</a></em> that Jackson's public image over the course of her career had shifted &quot;from innocence to experience, inspiring such carnal albums as 1993's 'Janet' and 1997's 'The Velvet Rope', the latter of which explored the bonds&lt;U+2014&gt;figuratively and literally&lt;U+2014&gt;of love and lust.&quot;<a href="#fn211" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref211"><sup>211</sup></a> Jackson explained the recurring themes on her later albums by saying, &quot;I love love and I love sex.&quot;<a href="#fn212" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref212"><sup>212</sup></a> She stated during promotion for <em>janet.</em>, &quot;I love feeling deeply sexual&lt;U+2014&gt;and don't mind letting the world know.

<h3 id="choreography">Choreography</h3>
<p>Jackson drew her inspiration from the musicals she watched in her youth for her music videos and performances, and was heavily influenced by the choreography of <a href="Fred_Astaire" title="wikilink">Fred Astaire</a> and <a href="Michael_Kidd" title="wikilink">Michael Kidd</a>, among others.<a href="#fn214" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref214"><sup>214</sup></a> Throughout her career, Jackson has worked with numerous professional choreographers such as <a href="Paula_Abdul" title="wikilink">Paula Abdul</a>, Michael Kidd, and <a href="Tina_Landon" title="wikilink">Tina Landon</a>. Landon also took part in the choreography for Michael and Janet Jackson's 1995 music video <em>Scream</em>.<a href="#fn215" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref215"><sup>215</sup></a> Janine Coveney of <em>Billboard</em> observed that &quot;Jackson's musical declaration of independence [<em>Control</em>] launched a string of hits, an indelible production sound, and an enduring image cemented by groundbreaking video choreography and imagery that pop vocalists still emulate.&quot;<a href="#fn216" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref216"><sup>216</sup></a> Qadree EI-Amin remarked that artists such as &quot;Britney Spears and <a href="Christina_Aguilera" title="wikilink">Christina Aguilera</a> pattern their performances after Janet's proven dance-diva persona.&quot;<a href="#fn217" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref217"><sup>217</sup></a></p>
<p>Chris Willman of <em>Los Angeles Times</em> stated the &quot;enthralling&quot; choreography of Jackson's Rhythm Nation 1814 Tour &quot;represents the pinnacle of what can be done in the popping 'n' locking style&lt;U+2014&gt;a rapid-fire mixture of rigidly jerky and gracefully fluid movements.&quot;<a href="#fn218" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref218"><sup>218</sup></a> <em>The Independent</em> writer Nicholas Barber commented in his review for The Velvet Rope Tour that &quot;Janet's concerts are the pop equivalent of a summer blockbuster movie, with all the explosions, special effects, ersatz sentimentality, gratuitous cleavage and emphasis on spectacle over coherence that the term implies.&quot;<a href="#fn219" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref219"><sup>219</sup></a> When <em>Los Angeles Times</em> reporter Robert Hilburn asked Jackson &quot;[d]o you understand it when people talk about [The Velvet Rope Tour] in terms of Broadway?&quot;, she responded, &quot;I'm crazy about Broadway ... That's what I grew up on.&quot;<a href="#fn220" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref220"><sup>220</sup></a></p>
<p>Thor Christensen of the <em><a href="Dallas_Morning_News" title="wikilink">Dallas Morning News</a></em> reported that Jackson <a href="lip_sync" title="wikilink">lip syncs</a> in concert; he wrote, &quot;Janet Jackson&lt;U+2014&gt;one of pop's most notorious onstage lip-syncers&lt;U+2014&gt;conceded ... she uses 'some' taped vocals to augment her live vocals.

<p>The baby sister of the &quot;precious Jackson clan&quot;,<a href="#fn225" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref225"><sup>225</sup></a> Janet Jackson has strived to distance her professional career from that of her older brother Michael and the rest of the Jackson family. Phillip McCarthy of <em><a href="Sydney_Morning_Herald" title="wikilink">Sydney Morning Herald</a></em> noted that throughout her recording career, one of her common conditions for interviewers has been that there would be no mention of Michael.<a href="#fn226" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref226"><sup>226</sup></a> Joshua Klein wrote, &quot;[f]or the first half of her recording career, Janet Jackson sounded like an artist with something to prove. Emerging in 1982 just as big brother Michael was casting his longest shadow, Jackson filled her albums not so much with songs as with declarations, from 'The Pleasure Principle' to the radical-sounding 'Rhythm Nation' to the telling statement of purpose, 'Control'.&quot;<a href="#fn227" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref227"><sup>227</sup></a> Steve Huey of Allmusic asserted that despite being born into a family of entertainers, Janet Jackson has managed to emerge a &quot;superstar&quot; in her own right, rivaling not only several female recording artists including Madonna and Whitney Houston, but also her brother, while &quot;successfully [shifting] her image from a strong, independent young woman to a sexy, mature adult.&quot;<a href="#fn228" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref228"><sup>228</sup></a> Klein argued that &quot;stardom was not too hard to predict, but few could have foreseen that Janet&lt;U+2014&gt;Miss Jackson, if you're nasty&lt;U+2014&gt;would one day replace Michael as true heir to the Jackson family legacy.&quot;<a href="#fn229" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref229"><sup>229</sup></a></p>
