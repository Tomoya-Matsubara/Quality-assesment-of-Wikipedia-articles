<p>The <strong>Penny Arcade Expo</strong> (<strong>PAX</strong>) is a semi-annual gamer festival held in <a href="Seattle" class="uri" title="wikilink">Seattle</a> and <a href="Boston" class="uri" title="wikilink">Boston</a>. PAX was created by <a href="Jerry_Holkins" title="wikilink">Jerry Holkins</a> and <a href="Mike_Krahulik" title="wikilink">Mike Krahulik</a>, the authors of the <em><a href="Penny_Arcade_(webcomic)" title="wikilink">Penny Arcade</a></em> <a href="webcomic" class="uri" title="wikilink">webcomic</a>, because they wanted to attend a show that gave equal attention to <a href="console_game" title="wikilink">console gamers</a>, <a href="Personal_computer_game" title="wikilink">computer gamers</a>, and <a href="tabletop_game" title="wikilink">tabletop gamers</a>.</p>
<p>Created in 2004, PAX has been hailed as a weekend-long celebration of gamer culture. Defining characteristics include an insider keynote speech, game-inspired concerts, panels on game industry topics, exhibitor booths from independent and major game developers and publishers, after-hours parties, tournaments, and freeplay areas. Every PAX also features the Omegathon, a weekend long tournament of randomly selected attendees competing for a grand prize. The final round makes up the show's closing ceremony; past games for the final round have included <a href="Tetris" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tetris</a>, <a href="Pong" class="uri" title="wikilink">Pong</a>, <a href="Halo_3" title="wikilink">Halo 3</a>, and <a href="Skee_ball" title="wikilink">Skee ball</a>.</p>
<p>After many successful years of PAX, in 2010 the first PAX East was held in Boston, MA, with attendance levels that rivaled those of PAX 2009. From then on, the Washington conventions were referred to as PAX Prime in order to avoid confusion between the two.</p>

<p><img src="Pennyarcadeexpocrowd.jpg" title="fig:PAX attendees crowding the lobby of Bellevue&#39;s Meydenbauer Center" alt="PAX attendees crowding the lobby of Bellevue&#39;s Meydenbauer Center" /> On April 12, 2004, the authors of <em>Penny Arcade</em> announced PAX, the <em>Penny Arcade</em> Expo.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> PAX 2004 was a two-day event held at the <a href="Meydenbauer_Center" title="wikilink">Meydenbauer Center</a> in <a href="Bellevue,_Washington" title="wikilink">Bellevue, Washington</a> from August 28 to August 29, 2004, which they hoped would turn into an annual event. Several exhibitors, including <a href="Microsoft" class="uri" title="wikilink">Microsoft</a>, <a href="Rooster_Teeth" title="wikilink">Rooster Teeth</a> and <a href="Ubisoft" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ubisoft</a>, showcased videos and playable demos of their upcoming games at PAX 2004. Microsoft allowed attendees to experience a multiplayer level of <em><a href="Halo_2" title="wikilink">Halo 2</a></em> months before it hit stores in addition to a number of other Xbox games, while Ubisoft showed <em><a href="Tom_Clancy&#39;s_Splinter_Cell:_Chaos_Theory" title="wikilink">Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory</a></em>, <em><a href="Tom_Clancy&#39;s_Ghost_Recon_2" title="wikilink">Ghost Recon 2</a></em> and two other titles.</p>
<p>Included amongst the events of the first PAX were live musical performances by bands including <a href="The_Minibosses" title="wikilink">The Minibosses</a>, panels featuring <em>Penny Arcade</em> creators Mike Krahulik and Jerry Holkins as well as others in the <a href="video_game_industry" title="wikilink">video game industry</a>, and the Omegathon, a contest where twenty contestants played a series of games for a chance at winning an excessively large video game collection worth in excess of $25,000.</p>
<p>The contestants competed in a tabletop dice game called <a href="Diceland_(dice_game)" title="wikilink">Diceland</a>, <em><a href="Halo_(video_game_series)" title="wikilink">Halo</a></em> (<a href="Xbox" class="uri" title="wikilink">Xbox</a>), <em><a href="Mario_Kart:_Double_Dash!!" title="wikilink">Mario Kart: Double Dash!!</a></em> (<a href="Nintendo_GameCube" title="wikilink">GameCube</a>), <em><a href="Dance_Dance_Revolution" title="wikilink">Dance Dance Revolution</a></em>, <em><a href="Doom_(video_game)" title="wikilink">Doom</a></em> (PC) and the original home version of <em><a href="Pong" class="uri" title="wikilink">Pong</a></em>. Sean Celaya defeated Kevin Potter in the final round to take home the grand prize becoming the PAX 2004 Omegathon champion.</p>
<p>Penny Arcade claimed that precisely <a href="leet" title="wikilink">1337</a> people pre-registered, to which Holkins mused, &quot;though I ordinarily shun leet-speak that number clearly implies the blessing of gaming deities.&quot;<a href="http://www.penny-arcade.com/2004/08/27">1</a> All told, about 3,300 people attended the event.</p>
<h2 id="pax-2005">PAX 2005</h2>
<p><img src="Penny-Arcade-Expo-Attendance.svg" title="fig:Attendance at the Penny Arcade Expo" alt="Attendance at the Penny Arcade Expo" width="300" /> PAX 2005 took place from August 26 to August 28, 2005 at the <a href="Meydenbauer_Center" title="wikilink">Meydenbauer Center</a> in Bellevue, Washington, where the first PAX was held. PAX 2005, unlike its predecessor, occupied the entire center, effectively doubling the usable floor space. Sponsors included <a href="Nintendo" class="uri" title="wikilink">Nintendo</a>, <a href="Sony" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sony</a>, Microsoft, Ubisoft and <a href="NCsoft" class="uri" title="wikilink">NCsoft</a>, among others.</p>

New events included Beat The Pros and industry panels on online gaming, the videogame marketing process, and controversy in the industry.</p>
<p>Omegathon II was an even more elaborate affair than its predecessor. Krahulik said that, &quot;[At PAX 2005] we will deliver an even bigger prize to the winner of the Omegathon.&quot;<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> It was revealed that prize would be the complete NES video game library, with a claimed value of at least $10,099.99.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> The prize was locked in a large cage in the exhibition room and also included two <a href="Star_Wars" title="wikilink">Star Wars</a>-themed <a href="Alienware" class="uri" title="wikilink">Alienware</a> gaming PCs, one of which would go to the winner and the other to the runner-up. Contestants competed in the tabletop game <em><a href="Diceland_(dice_game)" title="wikilink">Diceland</a></em>, <em><a href="Mario_Kart:_Double_Dash!!" title="wikilink">Mario Kart: Double Dash!!</a></em>, <em><a href="Katamari_Damacy" title="wikilink">Katamari Damacy</a></em>, <em><a href="Karaoke_Revolution" title="wikilink">Karaoke Revolution</a></em>, <em><a href="Quake_(video_game)" title="wikilink">Quake</a></em>, and the <a href="Atari_2600" title="wikilink">Atari 2600</a> game <em><a href="Combat_(video_game)" title="wikilink">Combat</a></em>. In a four-round match, Luke &quot;Coreside&quot; Armstrong defeated Will &quot;LeRoy&quot; Garroutte by a single point to win the best-of-three series 2-1-1 and take home the grand prize. In total, more than 9,000 gamers attended PAX 2005, almost triple the previous year's attendance.</p>
<p>In response to <a href="Hurricane_Katrina" title="wikilink">Hurricane Katrina</a>, Penny Arcade auctioned off the original pencil sketch of the PAX 2005 program cover on eBay with the profit to be given to the American Red Cross. It was sold to Christian Boggs for the final price of $8,700. Mr. Boggs also placed the winning bid of $20,000 on an auction to appear in a Penny Arcade comic strip at the 2005 <a href="Child&#39;s_Play_(charity)" title="wikilink">Child's Play Charity</a> Dinner.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a><a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="pax-2006">PAX 2006</h2>
<p>PAX 2006 was held from August 25 to August 27, 2006. The Meydenbauer Center in Bellevue was again used as the venue, although the Tabletop Gaming area was moved offsite to the ballrooms at the nearby Red Lion hotel. Exhibit space at PAX 06 completely sold out in less than three months, with exhibitors including <a href="Nintendo" class="uri" title="wikilink">Nintendo</a>, <a href="Microsoft" class="uri" title="wikilink">Microsoft</a>, <a href="Ubisoft" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ubisoft</a>, <a href="Turbine_Inc" title="wikilink">Turbine Inc</a>, <a href="Technomancer_Press" title="wikilink">Technomancer Press</a>, <a href="NCSoft" class="uri" title="wikilink">NCSoft</a>, <a href="Rooster_Teeth_Productions" title="wikilink">Rooster Teeth Productions</a>, <a href="Creative_Labs" title="wikilink">Creative Labs</a>, <a href="Wizards_of_the_Coast" title="wikilink">Wizards of the Coast</a>, and <a href="nVidia" class="uri" title="wikilink">nVidia</a>. Because they applied one month before PAX 2006, <a href="Sony" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sony</a> was unable to attend, as exhibitor space was also sold out. According to Krahulik, there were 19,323 attendees.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>

<p>In the Omegathon, returning Omeganaut Will &quot;LeRoy&quot; Garroutte defeated David &quot;Davertron&quot; Davis in the final round of the Omegathon: head to head Tetris. LeRoy took away a brand new Scion car fully loaded with custom wheels, custom sound, LCD tv, Xbox 360 Premium, wireless controllers, and more. Davertron left with an Xbox 360 Premium and $500 Best Buy gift card, and returned as an Omeganaut in 2007.</p>
<p>Holkins and PA business manager <a href="Robert_Khoo" title="wikilink">Robert Khoo</a> led the way into Omegathon Round 5, Guitar Hero II. After playing through &quot;Trippin on a Hole In a Paper Heart&quot; on expert, Holkins smashed the guitar on stage.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p>Krahulik and Holkins announced the first ever Penny Arcade video game. Titled &quot;<a href="Penny_Arcade_Adventures" title="wikilink">On The Rain-Slick Precipice of Darkness</a>: Episode One&quot;, (which has since been released) and that the game would feature PA characters in episodic adventures. Details were few; when asked what the game was about, Holkins replied &quot;Gabe. Tycho. And Cthulhu.&quot;</p>
<p>Krahulik and Holkins also announced a Penny Arcade annual scholarship, wherein one applicant with an intention to work in the game industry will be awarded $10,000 toward tuition expenses.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p>Several game companies ran large prize tournaments and giveaways, including ArenaNet ($10,000 prize tourney), TableStar ($2,500 prize tourney), and Nvidia (several thousand dollars' worth of video cards).</p>
<h2 id="pax-2007">PAX 2007</h2>
<p>The fourth annual Penny Arcade Expo took place August 24 to August 27, 2007, and experienced its first year within the confines of the  of the <a href="Washington_State_Convention_and_Trade_Center" title="wikilink">Washington State Convention and Trade Center</a>, more than doubling the space used to house <a href="Penny_Arcade_Expo#PAX_2006" title="wikilink">PAX 2006</a>.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> The massive <a href="Electronic_Entertainment_Expo" title="wikilink">Electronic Entertainment Expo</a> (E3) was heavily downsized in 2006, which allowed the growing Penny Arcade Expo to become the biggest gamer festival in North America. Headliners for 2007&lt;U+2019&gt;s PAX included Nintendo, Microsoft and <a href="Sony" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sony</a>, as well as others such as Ubisoft, <a href="NCSoft" class="uri" title="wikilink">NCSoft</a>, <a href="THQ" class="uri" title="wikilink">THQ</a>, <a href="Wizards_of_the_Coast" title="wikilink">Wizards of the Coast</a>, <a href="Namco-Bandai" class="uri" title="wikilink">Namco-Bandai</a>, <a href="Vivendi" class="uri" title="wikilink">Vivendi</a>, <a href="Konami" class="uri" title="wikilink">Konami</a> and 45 other game publishers and developers.

<p>Attendance was reported at 39,000.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> For the final round of the Omegathon, Ryan &quot;Accalon&quot; Zack and Ben &quot;MNC Dover&quot; Gray competed on never before seen levels of <a href="Halo_3" title="wikilink">Halo 3</a>. Accalon won the grand prize, $5000 and a trip to the <a href="Tokyo_Game_Show" title="wikilink">Tokyo Game Show</a>.</p>
<p>While the convention was housed on three of the floors of the <a href="Washington_State_Convention_and_Trade_Center" title="wikilink">Washington State Convention and Trade Center</a>, the exhibition hall was certainly a busy place, featuring educational, video game and tabletop exhibitors, as well as retailers. The layout of the exhibition hall allowed visitors to peruse through a variety of displays, offering places where they could win their weight in <a href="Ramen_noodles" title="wikilink">Ramen noodles</a> or enter the World's Smallest Dungeon, as hosted by <a href="Technomancer_Press" title="wikilink">Technomancer Press</a>.</p>
<h2 id="pax-2008">PAX 2008</h2>
<p>On October 26, 2007, Penny-Arcade Inc. announced PAX 2008. PAX '08 was again held at the <a href="Washington_State_Convention_and_Trade_Center" title="wikilink">Washington State Convention and Trade Center</a>, and covered the weekend of August 29&lt;U+2013&gt;31.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> The exhibition hall space was doubled from that of 2007, and tabletop gaming and an additional panel room was located in the Pike Street Annex of the convention center, the first time this space has been used for PAX. Also new for 2008 was the &quot;<a href="PAX_10" title="wikilink">PAX 10</a>&quot;, a judged selection of self-submitted independent games on which attendees voted for a favorite. PAX 10 selections include <a href="Chronotron" class="uri" title="wikilink">Chronotron</a>, <a href="The_Maw_(video_game)" title="wikilink">the Maw</a>, and <a href="Schizoid_(video_game)" title="wikilink">Schizoid</a>. To account for crowds, one empty exhibition room was explicitly reserved for the purpose of holding queues for the popular events in the main theater and other queues as needed. The 2008 keynote was delivered by <a href="Ken_Levine_(video_game_designer)" title="wikilink">Ken Levine</a>.</p>
<p>PAX 2008 came to a close with Fallout and Geko playing <a href="Excitebike#Vs._Excitebike" title="wikilink">Vs. Excitebike</a>, again for $5000 and a trip to the <a href="Tokyo_Game_Show" title="wikilink">Tokyo Game Show</a>. Geko was victorious.</p>
<p>The pre-show attendance estimate was 45,000, but this was soon feared to be a low guess.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> The final count of tickets sold was reported as 58,500, including 45,000 pre-registered tickets.

<h2 id="pax-2009">PAX 2009</h2>
<p>PAX 2009 was held on September 4&lt;U+2013&gt;6, 2009 at the Washington State Convention and Trade Center.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> The keynote speaker was <a href="Ron_Gilbert" title="wikilink">Ron Gilbert</a>.

<p>For the first time, PAX occupied the entire convention center to accommodate an increase in attendees.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> Despite the increase in capacity, two days before the start of the show, PAX passes were sold out for the first time. Penny Arcade then announced that no passes would be sold on-site, however circumstances allowed on-site sales of 1,000 extra one-day passes each for Saturday and Sunday.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a><a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> The total attendance of the 2009 convention was 60,750.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
