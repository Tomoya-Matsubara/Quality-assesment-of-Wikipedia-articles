<p><strong>Lorne</strong> was an electoral district that existed in the <a href="District_of_Saskatchewan" title="wikilink">District of Saskatchewan</a>, <a href="Northwest_Territories" title="wikilink">Northwest Territories</a> from 1880 until 1888. The district was one of the first three created by Royal Proclamation in 1880. Of the first three electoral districts proclaimed it was the only one to actually have an election held in it.</p>
<p>Under the <em>Northwest Territories Act 1880</em> the district was mandated at its inception to return a single member to the Northwest Territories Legislature under the <a href="First_Past_the_Post" title="wikilink">First Past the Post</a> electoral system. The district was named in the honor of former <a href="Governor_General_of_Canada" title="wikilink">Governor General</a>, the <a href="John_Campbell,_9th_Duke_of_Argyll" title="wikilink">Marquess of Lorne</a>. Lorne would tour the through the Northwest Territories just after the electoral district was created in 1881.</p>
<p>The electoral district ceased to exist at the drop of the writ for the <a href="Northwest_Territories_general_election,_1888" title="wikilink">1888 Northwest Territories general election</a>. This was due to a population boom in the area caused by an influx of settlers. The electoral district was redistributed and split between the electoral districts of <a href="Batoche_(N.W.T._electoral_district)" title="wikilink">Batoche</a> and the <a href="Prince_Albert_(N.W.T._electoral_district)" title="wikilink">Prince Albert</a> electoral district. During the nine years the district existed, it returned three members through three elections who served roughly three year terms.</p>
<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>The electoral district was one of three royally proclaimed by <a href="Lieutenant-Governors_of_Northwest_Territories" title="wikilink">Lieutenant-Governor</a> <a href="David_Laird_(19th_Century_politician)" title="wikilink">David Laird</a> on <a href="November_13" title="wikilink">November 13</a>, <a href="1880" class="uri" title="wikilink">1880</a><a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> The other two electoral districts were <strong>Salisbury</strong>, named after the <a href="Marquess_of_Salisbury" title="wikilink">Marquess of Salisbury</a> and <strong>Kimberley</strong> name after the Lord of Kimberley. Kimberley's contribution to the Northwest Territories was transferring the <a href="Canadian_Arctic_Archipelago" title="wikilink">Canadian Arctic Archipelago</a> to <a href="Canada" class="uri" title="wikilink">Canada</a> on <a href="September_1" title="wikilink">September 1</a>, <a href="1880" class="uri" title="wikilink">1880</a>. <a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>The electoral district was created with the provision to cover an area of 1000 square miles and have a population of 1000 electors. The major population centres in the electoral district at the time of creation were <a href="Prince_Albert,_Saskatchewan" title="wikilink">Prince Albert</a>, and <a href="Fort_Carlton" title="wikilink">Fort Carlton</a>.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> The land around the district boomed due to a high rate of settlement in that period. The cause of this was due to the possibility of the <a href="Canadian_Pacific_Railway" title="wikilink">Canadian Pacific</a> transcontinental railway line being built through the area.</p>
<p>The Northwest Territories political system used at this time was run by an early form of <a href="consensus_government" title="wikilink">consensus government</a>. Candidates stood for election independent of the political parties that exist in other provinces and territories and the federal level within Canada.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> The government had not yet developed to the point of being a <a href="Responsible_government" title="wikilink">Responsible government</a> as the majority of members were appointed and not elected.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> The district was served by three representatives during its eight year history.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>

<p>The election was conducted by voice vote, a qualified elector would tell the returning officer at a polling station who he was going to vote for and the results would be tallied. Under the terms of the Act eligible electors were males who had reached the age of majority, which was 21 years of age at that time. The act specifically specified that electors must be bona fide males who were not aliens and unenfranchised Indians. Electors must also have resided in the territory for at least 12 months to the day of the writ being dropped.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>

<h3 id="election-1">1883 election</h3>
<p>Nearing the end of his term in office Clarke decided not to run for re-election in 1883. He was losing to much support due to his ties with the <a href="Hudson_Bay_Company" title="wikilink">Hudson Bay Company</a>.
