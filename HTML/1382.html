<p><strong>Pulteney Bridge</strong> is a <a href="bridge" class="uri" title="wikilink">bridge</a> that crosses the <a href="River_Avon_(Bristol)" title="wikilink">River Avon</a>, in <a href="Bath,_Somerset" title="wikilink">Bath</a>, England. It was designed by <a href="Robert_Adam" title="wikilink">Robert Adam</a> in a <a href="Palladian_architecture" title="wikilink">Palladian</a> style to connect the city with the new town of <a href="Bathwick" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bathwick</a>. It is one of only four bridges in the world with shops across the full span on both sides. It was designated as an <a href="Ancient_monument" title="wikilink">Ancient monument</a> and is now a Grade I <a href="listed_building" title="wikilink">listed building</a>.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>The bridge was completed by 1774. Within 20 years alterations were made which expanded the shops and changed the fa&lt;U+00E7&gt;ades. By the end of the 18th century floods had damaged the bridge; however it was rebuilt to a similar design. Over the next century alterations to the shops included <a href="cantilever" title="wikilink">cantilevered</a> extensions on both the north and south faces of the bridge. In the 20th century several schemes have been enacted to preserve the bridge and partially return it to its original appearance, which has contributed to its prominence as a site for tourists.</p>
<p>The bridge is now  long and  wide with shops on both sides. Although there have been plans to completely pedestrianise the bridge it is still used by buses and taxis. The much photographed bridge and the weir below it are close to the centre of the city which is a <a href="World_Heritage_Site" title="wikilink">World Heritage Site</a> largely because of its <a href="Georgian_architecture" title="wikilink">Georgian architecture</a>.</p>

<p>It is named after Frances Pulteney, the wife of <a href="Sir_William_Pulteney,_5th_Baronet" title="wikilink">Sir William Pulteney, 5th Baronet</a>. Their rural <a href="Bathwick" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bathwick</a> estate was separated from the city by the river which could only be crossed by a ferry. He made plans to create a new town, which would become a suburb to the historic city of Bath. First he needed a better river crossing than the existing ferry, hence the bridge.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> Their involvement is recalled by <a href="Great_Pulteney_Street" title="wikilink">Great Pulteney Street</a> in Bathwick, reputed to be the longest boulevard of its kind in Europe, while <a href="Henrietta_Street,_Bath" title="wikilink">Henrietta Street</a> was named after his daughter.</p>
<p>Initial plans by <a href="Thomas_Paty" title="wikilink">Thomas Paty</a>,<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> which did not include the shops, were rejected and adapted by the brothers <a href="Robert_Adam" title="wikilink">Robert</a> and <a href="James_Adam_(architect)" title="wikilink">James Adam</a> who were working on designs for the new town at Bathwick.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> Robert Adam then became involved in further designs for the bridge. In his hands the simple construction envisaged by Pulteney became an elegant structure lined with shops. Adam had visited both <a href="Florence" class="uri" title="wikilink">Florence</a> and <a href="Venice" class="uri" title="wikilink">Venice</a>, where he would have seen the <a href="Ponte_Vecchio" title="wikilink">Ponte Vecchio</a> and the <a href="Rialto_Bridge" title="wikilink">Ponte di Rialto</a>. But Adam's design more closely followed <a href="Andrea_Palladio" title="wikilink">Andrea Palladio</a>'s rejected design for the Rialto.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> Adam's working drawings are in the <a href="Sir_John_Soane&#39;s_Museum" title="wikilink">Sir John Soane's Museum</a> in London.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> The revised bridge was  long<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> and  wide, rather than the  envisaged by Paty, which overcame the objections of the local council about the bridge being too narrow.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<p>Construction started in 1769 and was completed by 1774 at a cost of &lt;U+00A3&gt;11,000.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> The builders for the lower part of the bridge were local masons Reed and Lowther while the construction of the shops was carried out by Singers and Lankeshere.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>

<p><img src="Pulteney_Bridge,_Bath,_rear_view.jpg" title="fig:Pulteney Bridge, view from the north side" alt="Pulteney Bridge, view from the north side" /> Pulteney Bridge stood for less than 20 years in the form that Adam created. In 1792 alterations to enlarge the shops, combining the original 16 shops into six large ones, and widening it to , which marred the elegance of the fa&lt;U+00E7&gt;ades.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> Floods in 1799 and 1800 wrecked the north side of the bridge, which had been constructed with inadequate support. <a href="Thomas_Telford" title="wikilink">Thomas Telford</a> suggested replacing the bridge with a single span <a href="cast_iron" title="wikilink">cast iron</a> bridge. However it was rebuilt by <a href="John_Pinch_the_elder" title="wikilink">John Pinch</a> senior, surveyor to the Pulteney estate, in a less ambitious version of Adam's design.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> 19th-century shopkeepers altered windows, or <a href="Cantilever" title="wikilink">cantilevered</a> out over the river as the fancy took them. Some even painted advertisements on the outside of their shops affecting the view from the river and Grand Parade.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> The western end pavilion on the south side was demolished in 1903 for road widening and its replacement was not an exact match.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1936 the bridge became scheduled as a national monument. The city council bought several of the shops and made plans for the restoration of the original fa&lt;U+00E7&gt;ade.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> The restoration was completed in time for the <a href="Festival_of_Britain" title="wikilink">Festival of Britain</a> in 1951.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> Further work was carried out in the 1960s because the underside <a href="soffit" title="wikilink">soffits</a> of all three arches needed repair.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> More restoration was needed in 1975.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> The scheduling of the bridge as an ancient monument in 1936 has since been replaced with its designation as a Grade I <a href="listed_building" title="wikilink">listed building</a>.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a></p>
<p>In 2009 <a href="Bath_and_North_East_Somerset" title="wikilink">Bath and North East Somerset</a> council put forward plans to ban vehicles from the bridge and turn it into a pedestrianised zone.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a></p>

The western mid-stream pier was rebuilt in 1804.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a></p>
<p>The shops on the north side of the bridge are numbered 1 to 8 and on the south side 9 to 17. The two story <a href="limestone" class="uri" title="wikilink">limestone</a> buildings are in a <a href="Palladian_architecture" title="wikilink">palladian</a> style with <a href="Slate_industry_in_Wales" title="wikilink">Welsh slate</a> roofs. There were built around 1774 and altered around 1895, when the western pavilion was moved for the construction of the Grand Parade. Further restoration was undertaken in 1975.
