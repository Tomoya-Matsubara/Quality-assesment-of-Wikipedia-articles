<p><strong>Operation Perch</strong> was a <a href="Second_World_War" title="wikilink">Second World War</a> British offensive that took place between 6–14 June 1944, during the <a href="Invasion_of_Normandy" title="wikilink">Battle of Normandy</a>. The offensive was intended to encircle and seize the <a href="Nazi_Germany" title="wikilink">German</a> occupied city of <a href="Caen" class="uri" title="wikilink">Caen</a>, which was a major Allied objective in the early stages of the <a href="Operation_Overlord" title="wikilink">invasion of northwest Europe</a>. A combination of fierce German resistance and failures at the British command level foiled the operation before its objectives were achieved.</p>
<p>Operation Perch was originally intended to take place immediately after the British beach landings, and was to be an advance to the southeast of Caen by <a href="XXX_Corps_(United_Kingdom)" title="wikilink">XXX Corps</a>. This depended on Caen's early liberation, but three days after the invasion the city was still in German hands so the operation was altered. Perch was expanded to include <a href="I_Corps_(United_Kingdom)" title="wikilink">I Corps</a> and became a pincer attack aimed at capturing Caen. Beginning the following day XXX Corps, forming the western arm of the encirclement, pushed south before becoming embroiled with strong German forces in a hotly-contested battle for the town of <a href="Tilly-sur-Seulles" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tilly-sur-Seulles</a>, which would change hands several times before its liberation. I Corps's eastern thrust was launched two days later from the <a href="River_Orne" title="wikilink">Orne</a> bridgehead, secured on D-Day by British airborne forces during <a href="Operation_Tonga" title="wikilink">Operation Tonga</a>, but made little progress in the face of determined resistance and constant counterattacks. With mounting casualties and no sign of an imminent German collapse, by 13 June the offensive east of Caen was abandoned.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, to the west, American pressure had opened up a gap in the German lines. In an attempt to keep operations mobile the <a href="7th_Armoured_Division_(United_Kingdom)" title="wikilink">7th Armoured Division</a> was diverted from the combat around Tilly-sur-Seulles and ordered to advance through the gap in a <a href="flanking_manoeuvre" title="wikilink">flanking manoeuvre</a> intended to force the Germans to fall back. After two days of intense fighting that included the <a href="Battle_of_Villers-Bocage" title="wikilink">Battle of Villers-Bocage</a>, on 14 June the division's position was judged untenable and it was withdrawn. Plans were made to resume the offensive once 7th Armoured had been reinforced, but these were dropped when a severe storm in the <a href="English_Channel" title="wikilink">English Channel</a> seriously disrupted allied supply operations.</p>
<p>Both the decision to exploit the gap and the handling of the subsequent battle have been subjects of controversy. Historians generally agree that, because of failures at the British divisional and corps command levels, an early opportunity to capture Caen was squandered. However, to contain the offensive the Germans had been forced to commit their most powerful armoured reserves in a defensive role, in which they incurred heavy losses and were incapable of counteroffensive operations.</p>

<p>Not all had gone as smoothly for the forces that landed on Sword Beach. I Corps's 3rd Infantry Division had struck inland towards Caen as planned, but had to divert elements to subdue strongly-held German positions along the  route to the town. With its effort being progressively diluted and its armoured support delayed by congestion in the beachhead, the division was unable to generate enough momentum to reach Caen on D-Day and was stopped short of its outskirts by the <a href="21st_Panzer_Division_(Germany)" title="wikilink">21st Panzer Division</a>.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>

Too close this time for artillery concentrations to be called in, fighting erupted with a British platoon being overrun. A counterattack with tanks and infantry repelled the Germans and restored the integrity of the position, but the Germans then subjected the British to harassing sniping fire, mortar bombardments, and at 14:00 heavy artillery fire.<a href="#fn149" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref149"><sup>149</sup></a> At 19:00 a major two-pronged assault, supported by a long artillery bombardment and tanks, struck the brigade box from the north and south.<a href="#fn150" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref150"><sup>150</sup></a><a href="#fn151" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref151"><sup>151</sup></a><a href="#fn152" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref152"><sup>152</sup></a> This penetrated the British lines and closed in on the brigade headquarters before being driven back, with fighting dying down around 22:30.<a href="#fn153" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref153"><sup>153</sup></a></p>

Historian George Forty states that &quot;although it was clearly Monty's final decision to send the 'Desert Rats' right flanking, it is not entirely clear whose idea it actually was to undertake the 'right hook'.&quot; Forty then quotes 7th Armoured Division commander George Erskine, who claims both that the idea originated with him, and that he believes the manoeuvre could have been conducted 24 hours earlier.<a href="#fn175" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref175"><sup>175</sup></a> That the flanking move could have been launched earlier is supported by John Buckley.<a href="#fn176" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref176"><sup>176</sup></a> Dan Taylor goes further, suggesting that although Gerard Bucknall of XXX Corps knew about the gap for 24 hours, he was restrained from exploiting it by Second Army commander Miles Dempsey, who was still focused at that time on Operation Wild Oats.<a href="#fn177" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref177"><sup>177</sup></a> The official campaign historian, L.F.

Their decision to withdraw [from Villers-Bocage] was done by the corps commander and Erskine.&quot;<a href="#fn185" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref185"><sup>185</sup></a> Although D'Este calls Dempsey's comments &quot;excessively harsh&quot;,<a href="#fn186" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref186"><sup>186</sup></a> historians generally support them, suggesting that a great opportunity to swiftly capture Caen was squandered by Bucknall.<a href="#fn187" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref187"><sup>187</sup></a><a href="#fn188" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref188"><sup>188</sup></a><a href="#fn189" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref189"><sup>189</sup></a> Fully supporting Dempsey, John Buckley claims that Bucknell was unprepared to support the attack once problems developed, and that Erskine was not suited to the task at hand.<a href="#fn190" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref190"><sup>190</sup></a> Major Ellis is somewhat less critical, calling the immediate result of the fighting &quot;disappointing&quot; but stating that with Panzerlehr's stubborn resistance and the unexpected arrival of the 2nd Panzer Division, the 7th Armoured Division &quot;could hardly have achieved full success&quot;.<a href="#fn191" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref191"><sup>191</sup></a> However this view is refuted by Michael Reynolds, who notes &quot;2nd Panzer's tanks were nowhere near Villers-Bocage at this time&quot;.<a href="#fn192" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref192"><sup>192</sup></a></p>
<p>One reason given for the operation's failure is that insufficient infantry were allotted to the offensive. Michael Reynolds notes that two infantry battalions and most of the 7th Armoured Division's 1st Rifle Brigade were uncommitted to action throughout 13 June. He further identifies three unemployed infantry brigades that could have been committed to the right hook alongside 7th Armoured when it went into action; he blames Bucknall for failing to concentrate enough force at the right place and the right time.<a href="#fn193" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref193"><sup>193</sup></a> This analysis is supported by D'Este, although Bucknall defended his decision claiming &quot;49 [Division] ... [had] no recent battle experience and it was important to launch them nicely into their first fighting in a properly coordinated battle, and not bundle them helter-skelter into hot armoured scrapping like that around V[illers]-B[ocage] and Amaye.&quot;<a href="#fn194" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref194"><sup>194</sup></a> According to John Buckley, the most crucial factor in the operation's failure was a corresponding failure at the command level.<a href="#fn195" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref195"><sup>195</sup></a></p>
<p>Chester Wilmot casts a different light on the result of Operation Perch, calling it a strategic success. &quot;By the premature commitment of his armour, Rommel had delayed the British advance, but in the process he had played into Montgomery's hands for, once the panzer divisions were locked into battle with Second Army, they could not be used for their proper offensive task.&quot;<a href="#fn196" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref196"><sup>196</sup></a></p>
