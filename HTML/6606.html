<p><strong>Deusdedit</strong> (died <em>c</em>. 664), perhaps originally named <strong>Frithona</strong>, <strong>Frithuwine</strong> or <strong>Frithonas</strong>, was a medieval <a href="Archbishop_of_Canterbury" title="wikilink">Archbishop of Canterbury</a>, the first native-born holder of the <a href="see_of_Canterbury" title="wikilink">see of Canterbury</a>. By birth an <a href="Anglo-Saxon" class="uri" title="wikilink">Anglo-Saxon</a>, he became archbishop in 655 and held the office for more than nine years until his death, probably from the plague. Deusdedit's successor as archbishop was one of his priests at Canterbury. There is some controversy over the exact date of Deusdedit's death, owing to discrepancies in the medieval written work that records his life. Little is known about his episcopate, but he was <a href="Congregation_for_the_Causes_of_Saints#Pre-Congregation" title="wikilink">considered</a> to be a <a href="saint" class="uri" title="wikilink">saint</a> after his demise. A <a href="hagiography" title="wikilink">saint's life</a> was written after his <a href="relic" title="wikilink">relics</a> were moved from their original burial place in 1091.</p>

<p>The see of Canterbury seems at this time to have been passing through a period of comparative obscurity.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> During the nine years of Deusdedit's pontificate all the new bishops in England were consecrated by <a href="Celtic_Church" title="wikilink">Celtic</a> or foreign bishops, with one exception:<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> Deusdedit consecrated <a href="Damianus" class="uri" title="wikilink">Damianus</a>, Ithamar's successor as Bishop of Rochester.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> Deusdedit did, however, found a <a href="nunnery" class="uri" title="wikilink">nunnery</a> in the <a href="Isle_of_Thanet" title="wikilink">Isle of Thanet</a> and helped with the foundation of <a href="Medeshamstede" class="uri" title="wikilink">Medeshamstede</a> Abbey, later <a href="Peterborough_Cathedral" title="wikilink">Peterborough Abbey</a>, in 657.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> He was long overshadowed by <a href="Agilbert" class="uri" title="wikilink">Agilbert</a>, bishop to the West Saxons,<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> and his authority as archbishop probably did not extend past his own diocese and that of <a href="Diocese_of_Rochester" title="wikilink">Rochester</a>, which had traditionally been dependent on Canterbury.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a></p>

<h2 id="death">Death</h2>
<p>Deusdedit died at some time around the Synod of Whitby, although the exact date is disputed.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> <a href="Bede" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bede</a>, in the <em><a href="Historia_Ecclesiastica_Gentis_Anglorum" title="wikilink">Historia Ecclesiastica Gentis Anglorum</a></em>, states that &quot;On the fourteenth of July in the above mentioned year, when an eclipse was quickly followed by plague and during which Bishop <a href="Colm&lt;U+00E1&gt;n_of_Lindisfarne" title="wikilink">Colman</a> was refuted by the unanimous decision of the Catholics and returned to his own country, Deusdedit the sixth Archbishop of Canterbury died.&quot;<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> A solar eclipse occurred on 1 May 664, which would appear to make the date of Deusdedit's death 14 July 664. But that conflicts with Bede's own information earlier in the <em>Historia</em>,<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> where he claims that Deusdedit's predecessor, <a href="Honorius_of_Canterbury" title="wikilink">Honorius</a>, &quot;died on the 30th of September 653, and after a vacancy of 18 months, Deusdedit, a West Saxon was elected to the archiepiscopal see and became the 6th Archbishop. He was consecrated by Ithamar, Bishop of Rochester, on the 26th of May, and ruled the see until his death nine years, four months, and two days later.&quot;<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> If this information is accurate, then Deusdedit must have died on 28 July 664.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> Various methods of reconciling these discrepancies have been proposed. <a href="Frank_Stenton" title="wikilink">Frank Stenton</a> argues that Bede began his years on 1 September; thus the date of Honorius' death should be considered 30 September 652 in modern reckoning. Further, Stenton argued that medieval copyists had introduced an error into the manuscripts of the <em>Historia</em>, and that Bede meant that the length of Deusdedit's reign was 9 years and 7 months, rather than 9 years and 4 months as stated in the manuscripts. From this, he concludes that Deusdedit's death occurred in the year September 663 to September 664. This would make the year of death correct according to the eclipse, but still leave a discrepancy on the specific day of death, for which Stenton asserted the length calculations given by Bede were more correct than the actual death date given. Thus Stenton concluded that Deusdedit died on 28 October 663.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a></p>
<p>Other historians, including Richard Abels, P. Grosjean, and Alan Thacker, state that Deusdedit died on 14 July 664.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a><a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a><a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> The main argument was put forward by Grosjean, who claimed that Bede had the consecration date wrong, as 26 May was <a href="Maundy_Thursday" title="wikilink">Maundy Thursday</a> in 655, not a date that would normally have been chosen for a consecration. Grosjean argues that the best method for resolving the conflicts is to just take 14 July 664 as the date of death, and figure backwards with the length of reign given by Bede, which gives a consecration date of 12 March 655.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> Thacker and Abels agree generally, although Thacker does not give a specific consecration date beyond March.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a><a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> Abels adds to Grosjean's arguments Bede's association of Deusdedit's death with that of King Eorcenberht, which Bede gives as occurring on the same day. Bede states that the plague of 664 began soon after the eclipse on 1 May. Nothing in Bede contradicts the date of 14 July 664 for Eorcenberht; therefore, Abels considers that date to be the best fit for the available data.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> The historian D. P. Kirby agrees that Deusdedit died in 664, although he does not give a precise date within that year.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a></p>
<p>Most historians state that Deusdedit died of the plague that was prevalent in England at the time.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a><a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a><a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> Because Bede records the death of Deusdedit shortly after he mentions the outbreak of the plague, the historian <a href="John_Maddicott" title="wikilink">J. R. Maddicott</a> asserts that both Deusdedit and Eorcenberht were struck suddenly with the disease and died quickly.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> Bede is not specific on the type of plague, but Maddicott argues that because of the time of its eruption and the way it arrived in England it was likely <a href="bubonic_plague" title="wikilink">bubonic plague</a>. Although Bede does not describe either Eorcenberht or Deusdedit's symptoms he does discuss another victim of the 664 disease, who suffered from a tumour on his thigh, resembling the characteristic groin swellings of bubonic plague.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a></p>
