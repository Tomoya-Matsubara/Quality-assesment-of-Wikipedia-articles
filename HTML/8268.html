<p>Rosen made his first appearance in the major leagues in <a href="1947" class="uri" title="wikilink">1947</a> at the age of 23. The next year he won a <a href="World_Series" title="wikilink">World Series</a> ring with the Indians.</p>
<p>In his first full season, in <a href="1950" class="uri" title="wikilink">1950</a>, Rosen led the American League in home runs with 37, hitting more than any previous American League rookie. He also averaged a league-best homer every 15.0 at bats, and led the league as well in <a href="HBP" class="uri" title="wikilink">HBP</a> (10). He <a href="Batting_average" title="wikilink">batted</a> .287 and had 116 <a href="runs_batted_in" title="wikilink">runs batted in</a>, while coming in 5th in the league with 100 <a href="walks" class="uri" title="wikilink">walks</a> and a .543 <a href="SP" class="uri" title="wikilink">SP</a>.

In Washington, the <a href="Senators" class="uri" title="wikilink">Senators</a> heard that day that Rosen had made an out in his last at-bat, after getting 3 hits earlier in the game. Vernon was still ahead. The Senators conspired to make sure Vernon didn't have to bat again. Mickey Grasso doubled and let himself get picked off. Then Keith &quot;Kite&quot; Thomas singled, and was out when he ran leisurely to second.</p>
<p>He finally won the <a href="American_League" title="wikilink">American League</a> <a href="MLB_Most_Valuable_Player_Award" title="wikilink">MVP Award</a> in <a href="1953_in_sports" title="wikilink">1953</a>. It was by an unprecedented unanimous vote.</p>

He also hit consecutive home runs in the All-Star game despite a broken finger, and was named MVP of the All-Star Game. <a href="Casey_Stengel" title="wikilink">Casey Stengel</a> said of him: &quot;That young feller, that feller's a ball player. He'll give you the works every time. Gets all the hits, gives you the hard tag in the field. That feller's a real competitor, you bet your sweet curse life.&quot;<a href="http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,858499,00.html">6</a> Cleveland won the pennant, but lost to the <a href="New_York_Giants" title="wikilink">New York Giants</a> as <a href="Dusty_Rhodes" title="wikilink">Dusty Rhodes</a> hit a home run off of <a href="Bob_Lemon" title="wikilink">Bob Lemon</a> to win it, and give the Giants their last world title. It was his 5th straight year with 100 or more RBIs. Still, after the season Cleveland cut his $42,500 salary to $37,500.</p>
<p>In <a href="1955" class="uri" title="wikilink">1955</a> Rosen was in the top 10 in the league in at-bats per home run, walks, and sacrifice flies.</p>
<p>Back problems and leg injuries caught up with him, and Rosen retired at the age of 32 in 1956.<a href="http://www.thebaseballpage.com/players/rosenal01.php">7</a></p>

<p>Rosen reentered baseball 20 years later as as a <a href="Major_League_Baseball" title="wikilink">MLB</a> executive.

<h2 id="jewish-heritage">Jewish heritage</h2>
<p>Rosen was tough (his nose was broken 13 times in his career), an amateur <a href="boxing" title="wikilink">boxer</a>, and had a reputation for standing up to anyone who dared insult his ancestry.</p>
<p>Rosen grew up in a Miami neighborhood where Gentile youth called out to him, &lt;U+201C&gt;Lookit the Jewboy. Go home and eat yuh <a href="matzo" title="wikilink">matzos</a>, <a href="sheeny" class="uri" title="wikilink">sheeny</a>.&lt;U+201D&gt;</p>
<p>Rosen told the sportswriter <a href="Roger_Kahn" title="wikilink">Roger Kahn</a> that as a young player in the minors he had moments when he wished his name were not as obviously Jewish as Rosen. But after he became a major league star, he actually considered changing his name to Rosenthal or Rosenstein so that no one could possibly mistake him for anything but a Jew. &quot;When I was up in the majors,&quot; he said, &quot;I always knew how I wanted it to be about me....Here comes one Jewish kid that every Jew in the world can be proud of.&quot;</p>
<p>In <a href="1951" class="uri" title="wikilink">1951</a>, the television <a href="impresario" class="uri" title="wikilink">impresario</a> <a href="Ed_Sullivan" title="wikilink">Ed Sullivan</a>, in his popular newspaper column, wrote about Rosen: &quot;Of <a href="Jewish" class="uri" title="wikilink">Jewish</a> parentage, he is <a href="Catholic" class="uri" title="wikilink">Catholic</a>. At the plate, you'll notice he makes the sign of the cross with his bat.&quot; Enraged, Rosen insisted on a full and public retraction, pointing out that the mark he always made with his bat was the letter &quot;x.&quot;<a href="http://bioproj.sabr.org/bioproj.cfm?a=v&amp;v=l&amp;bid=1275&amp;pid=12230">11</a></p>
<p>Once a <a href="White_Sox" title="wikilink">White Sox</a> opponent called him a &lt;U+201C&gt;Jew <a href="Illegitimacy" title="wikilink">bastard</a>.&lt;U+201D&gt; Sox pitcher <a href="Saul_Rogovin" title="wikilink">Saul Rogovin</a>, also Jewish, remembered an angry Rosen striding belligerently to the <a href="Dugout_(baseball)" title="wikilink">dugout</a> and challenging the &lt;U+201C&gt;<a href="son_of_a_bitch" title="wikilink">son of a bitch</a>&lt;U+201D&gt; to a fight. The player backed down.<a href="http://64.233.161.104/search?q=cache:MQk7W-MpjhEJ:nyc.sabr.org/Newsletters/Summer%25202004.pdf+%22al+rosen%22+%22ed+sullivan%22+jewish&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=3">12</a></p>
<p>Rosen challenging an opposing player who had &lt;U+201C&gt;slurred [his] religion&lt;U+201D&gt; to fight him under the stands. When a <a href="Red_Sox" title="wikilink">Red Sox</a> catcher called Rosen <a href="anti-Semitic" class="uri" title="wikilink">anti-Semitic</a> names, he called time and &lt;U+201C&gt;started toward him, to take him on.&lt;U+201D&gt; <a href="Hank_Greenberg" title="wikilink">Hank Greenberg</a> recalled that Rosen &lt;U+201C&gt;want[ed] to go into the stands and murder&lt;U+201D&gt; fans who hurled anti-Semitic insults at him.</p>
<p>During his career, Rosen declined to play on the <a href="High_Holy_Days" title="wikilink">High Holy Days</a>.</p>
<p>In an article in 1976 in <a href="Esquire" class="uri" title="wikilink">Esquire</a> magazine, sportswriter Harry Stein published an &quot;All Time All-Star Argument Starter,&quot; consisting of five ethnic baseball teams. Rosen was the third baseman on Stein's <a href="Jewish" class="uri" title="wikilink">Jewish</a> team.</p>
