<p><strong>Bj&lt;U+00F6&gt;rk Gu&lt;U+00F0&gt;mundsd&lt;U+00F3&gt;ttir</strong> () (born <a href="November_21" title="wikilink">November 21</a>, <a href="1965" class="uri" title="wikilink">1965</a> in <a href="Reykjav&lt;U+00ED&gt;k" class="uri" title="wikilink">Reykjav&lt;U+00ED&gt;k</a>, <a href="Iceland" class="uri" title="wikilink">Iceland</a>) is a <a href="Brit_Awards" title="wikilink">Brit Award</a>-winning <a href="Iceland" title="wikilink">Icelandic</a> <a href="singer/songwriter" class="uri" title="wikilink">singer/songwriter</a> and <a href="composer" class="uri" title="wikilink">composer</a> (formerly the lead singer of <a href="alternative_rock" title="wikilink">alternative rock</a> band <a href="The_Sugarcubes" title="wikilink">The Sugarcubes</a>). She is best known for her expressive range and an interest in many kinds of music including <a href="popular_music" title="wikilink">pop</a>, <a href="alternative_rock" title="wikilink">alternative rock</a>, <a href="jazz" class="uri" title="wikilink">jazz</a>, <a href="ambient_music" title="wikilink">ambient music</a>, <a href="electronica" class="uri" title="wikilink">electronica</a>, <a href="folk_music" title="wikilink">folk</a>, and <a href="European_classical_music" title="wikilink">classical music</a>. Her record label, <a href="One_Little_Indian" title="wikilink">One Little Indian</a>, reported in 2003 that she has sold over 15 million albums worldwide. <a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="early-career">Early career</h2>








<p>Bj&lt;U+00F6&gt;rk's musical career began when she was 11, studying classical <a href="piano" class="uri" title="wikilink">piano</a> in elementary school. One of her instructors sent a recording of Bj&lt;U+00F6&gt;rk singing <a href="Tina_Charles" title="wikilink">Tina Charles</a>' song &quot;I Love to Love&quot; to <a href="R&lt;U+00DA&gt;V" class="uri" title="wikilink">R&lt;U+00DA&gt;V</a>, then the only radio station in Iceland. The recording was broadcasted on radio nationally; after hearing it, a representative of the record label F&lt;U+00E1&gt;lkinn contacted Bj&lt;U+00F6&gt;rk with a record contract offer. She recorded her eponymous debut in 1977, with the help of her stepfather, who played guitar. This album featured several Icelandic children's songs and covers of popular songs such as <a href="the_Beatles" title="wikilink">the Beatles</a>' &quot;<a href="The_Fool_on_the_Hill" title="wikilink">The Fool on the Hill</a>&quot;, sung in <a href="Icelandic_language" title="wikilink">Icelandic</a>. The album went <a href="platinum_album" title="wikilink">platinum</a> in Iceland, and is now a highly sought-after collectors item.</p>
<p>Bj&lt;U+00F6&gt;rk was influenced by <a href="punk_rock" title="wikilink">punk rock</a> in her teens; at 14, she formed the all-girl punk band Spit and Snot, shortly followed by a <a href="jazz_fusion" title="wikilink">jazz fusion</a> group called Exodus in 1979. In 1980 she graduated from music school. In 1981, she and bassist Jakob Magn&lt;U+00FA&gt;sson formed another band called Jam-80, which became <a href="Tappi_T&lt;U+00ED&gt;karrass" title="wikilink">Tappi T&lt;U+00ED&gt;karrass</a> (which means &quot;Cork Bitch Ass&quot; in Icelandic), and released an extended single, &quot;<a href="B&lt;U+00ED&gt;ti&lt;U+00F0&gt;_Fast_&lt;U+00ED&gt;_V&lt;U+00ED&gt;ti&lt;U+00F0&gt;" title="wikilink">B&lt;U+00ED&gt;ti&lt;U+00F0&gt; Fast &lt;U+00ED&gt; V&lt;U+00ED&gt;ti&lt;U+00F0&gt;</a>&quot; in the same year. Their album <em><a href="Miranda_(Tappi_T&lt;U+00ED&gt;karrass)" title="wikilink">Miranda</a></em> was released in 1983.</p>
<p>Bj&lt;U+00F6&gt;rk next collaborated with <a href="Einar_&lt;U+00D6&gt;rn_Benediktsson" title="wikilink">Einar &lt;U+00D6&gt;rn Benediktsson</a> and Einar Melax from <a href="Purrkur_Pillnikk" title="wikilink">Purrkur Pillnikk</a>, and <a href="Gu&lt;U+00F0&gt;laugur_&lt;U+00D3&gt;ttarsson" title="wikilink">Gu&lt;U+00F0&gt;laugur &lt;U+00D3&gt;ttarsson</a>, <a href="Sigtryggur_Baldursson" title="wikilink">Sigtryggur Baldursson</a> and Birgir Mogensen from &lt;U+00DE&gt;eyr. After writing songs and rehearsing for two weeks, they (under the name <a href="KUKL" class="uri" title="wikilink">KUKL</a> which means &quot;sorcery&quot; in Icelandic) found they worked well together, and decided to continue, developing a sound that some have described as resembling <a href="Gothic_rock" title="wikilink">Gothic rock</a>. Bj&lt;U+00F6&gt;rk began to show indications of what would become her trademark singing style, punctuated with howls and shrieks.</p>
<p>KUKL toured Iceland with <a href="anarchist" class="uri" title="wikilink">anarchist</a> <a href="United_Kingdom" title="wikilink">UK</a> punk band <a href="Crass" class="uri" title="wikilink">Crass</a>, and later visited the UK in a series of performances with <a href="Flux_of_Pink_Indians" title="wikilink">Flux of Pink Indians</a>. The band produced two albums as a result of these collaborations: <em>The Eye</em> in 1984, and <em>Holidays in Europe</em> in 1986, both on <a href="Crass_Records" title="wikilink">Crass Records</a>.</p>
<p>The band was eventually dissolved, in part due to the closure of Gramm, their label. In the summer of 1986, several members of KUKL and the surrealist group Medusa got together to create the arts collective Smekkleysa (Bad Taste). They created a musical division, a band called <a href="Pukl" class="uri" title="wikilink">Pukl</a> but soon changed the name to The Sugarcubes. Smekkleysa and the Sugarcubes were officially started on the same day as the birth of Bj&lt;U+00F6&gt;rk's son, Sindri.</p>

<h3 id="the-sugarcubes">The Sugarcubes</h3>
<p>The Sugarcubes' first single, &quot;Amm&lt;U+00E6&gt;li&quot; (or &quot;Birthday&quot; in <a href="English_language" title="wikilink">English</a>), became a surprise hit in the <a href="United_Kingdom" title="wikilink">UK</a> after <em><a href="Melody_Maker" title="wikilink">Melody Maker</a></em> declared it single of the week. The Sugarcubes were immediately signed up by <a href="One_Little_Indian" title="wikilink">One Little Indian</a>, the new bedroom label set up by Derek Birkett, the former bass player of Flux of Pink Indians. They gained a significant <a href="cult_following" title="wikilink">cult following</a> in the <a href="United_States" title="wikilink">US</a> and <a href="United_Kingdom" title="wikilink">UK</a>, and calls from larger record companies began coming in. They rejected all these offers, choosing complete creative control over vast sums of money and sticking with their friend Birkett. Even today, Bj&lt;U+00F6&gt;rk remains on the label. The Sugarcubes also signed a distribution deal with <a href="Elektra_Records" title="wikilink">Elektra Records</a> in the United States, and recorded their first album, <em><a href="Life&#39;s_Too_Good" title="wikilink">Life's Too Good</a></em>, in 1988. The album propelled them into international stardom &lt;U+2014&gt; the first Icelandic rock band to achieve such popularity. While with the Sugarcubes, Bj&lt;U+00F6&gt;rk participated in a number of side projects. She recorded <em><a href="Gling-Gl&lt;U+00F3&gt;" class="uri" title="wikilink">Gling-Gl&lt;U+00F3&gt;</a></em>, a collection of popular jazz and original work, with the <a href="jazz" class="uri" title="wikilink">jazz</a> group <a href="Trio_Gu&lt;U+00F0&gt;mundar_Ing&lt;U+00F3&gt;lfssonar" title="wikilink">Trio Gu&lt;U+00F0&gt;mundar Ing&lt;U+00F3&gt;lfssonar</a> (an octogenarian jazz group), released in Iceland. Bj&lt;U+00F6&gt;rk also contributed vocals to <a href="808_State" title="wikilink">808 State</a>'s album <em><a href="Ex:el" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ex:el</a></em>, a collaboration which cultivated her interest in <a href="house_music" title="wikilink">house music</a>. The song &quot;Ooops&quot; was released as a single in the UK and was later included on 808 State's best of, &quot;<a href="808:88:98" class="uri" title="wikilink">808:88:98</a>&quot;.</p>
<h3 id="solo-career-debut">Solo career / Debut</h3>
<p><img src="BjorkDebut.jpg" title="fig:Album cover of Debut (1993)." alt="Album cover of Debut (1993)." width="200" /> In 1992 The Sugarcubes dissolved as different members of the band had realised they all had different ambitions; Instead of risking their friendship, the band went on an indefinite hiatus. They remain friends to this day and are all still involved in the management of Smekkleysa/Bad Taste. Bj&lt;U+00F6&gt;rk moved to <a href="London" class="uri" title="wikilink">London</a> and began thinking about a solo career; to this end, she began working with producer <a href="Nellee_Hooper" title="wikilink">Nellee Hooper</a>, who had produced for <a href="Massive_Attack" title="wikilink">Massive Attack</a>, among others. Their partnership produced Bj&lt;U+00F6&gt;rk's first international solo hit, &quot;Human Behaviour&quot;. Her solo debut album, <em><a href="Debut_(album)" title="wikilink">Debut</a></em>, was released in June 1993 to positive reviews; it was named album of the year by <em><a href="NME" class="uri" title="wikilink">NME</a></em>, and eventually went <a href="platinum_album" title="wikilink">platinum</a> in the United States. At the 1994 Brit Awards Bj&lt;U+00F6&gt;rk won the awards for Best International Female and Best International newcomer. <a href="http://www.everyhit.com/awardbrit.html">1</a> <em>Debut</em> was a mix of songs Bj&lt;U+00F6&gt;rk had written since she was a teenager as well as newer lyrical collaborations with Hooper.</p>
<p>The success of <em>Debut</em> enabled her to collaborate with other artists on one-off tracks. She worked with <a href="David_Arnold" title="wikilink">David Arnold</a> on &quot;Play Dead&quot;, the theme to the 1993 film <em>The Young Americans</em> (which appeared as a bonus track on a re-release of <em>Debut</em>), collaborated on two songs for <a href="Tricky" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tricky</a>'s <em>Nearly God</em> project, appeared on a track on the 1997 album <em>Not For Threes</em> by <a href="Plaid_(band)" title="wikilink">Plaid</a>, which was released on the cult <a href="Warp_Records" title="wikilink">Warp Records</a> label, and wrote the song &quot;<a href="Bedtime_Story" title="wikilink">Bedtime Story</a>&quot; for <a href="Madonna_(entertainer)" title="wikilink">Madonna</a>'s 1994 album <em><a href="Bedtime_Stories" title="wikilink">Bedtime Stories</a></em>.</p>
<h3 id="post">Post</h3>
<p><img src="BjorkPost.jpeg" title="fig:Album cover of Post (1995)." alt="Album cover of Post (1995)." width="200" /> Bj&lt;U+00F6&gt;rk returned to the studio during 1994 to work on her next solo album with Nellee Hooper, <a href="Tricky" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tricky</a>, Graham Massey of <a href="808_State" title="wikilink">808 State</a>, and electronic music producer <a href="Howard_Bernstein" title="wikilink">Howie B</a>. The album, <em><a href="Post_(album)" title="wikilink">Post</a></em>, contained songs based on Bj&lt;U+00F6&gt;rk's relationships and songs about love (one of her favorite subjects), as well as some angry and confrontational material. Like &quot;Debut&quot;, it was a collection partly made up of songs she had written in past years.</p>
<p>She performed on <a href="MTV_Unplugged" title="wikilink">MTV Unplugged</a> during this time. By 1995, the new album <em><a href="Post_(album)" title="wikilink">Post</a></em> was ready; it was released in June, reaching number two on the UK's album charts, and also went platinum in the United States. The album was boosted further by the success of the single &quot;<a href="It&#39;s_Oh_So_Quiet" title="wikilink">It's Oh So Quiet</a>&quot;, a surprise <a href="Christmas" class="uri" title="wikilink">Christmas</a> hit which sold 400 000 copies in the United Kingdom and spent 15 weeks on the chart. <a href="http://www.bpi.co.uk/platinum/platinumright.asp?rq=search_plat&amp;r_id=20874">2</a> January 1997 saw the release of <em><a href="Telegram_(album)" title="wikilink">Telegram</a></em>, an album of previously-released remixes of songs from <em>Post</em> and a non-LP song &quot;My Spine&quot;.</p>
<h3 id="homogenic">Homogenic</h3>
<p><img src="Homogenic_(album).jpg" title="fig:Album cover of Homogenic (1997)." alt="Album cover of Homogenic (1997)." /> Later that year, the album <em><a href="Homogenic" class="uri" title="wikilink">Homogenic</a></em> was released. It marked a dramatic shift from her earlier &quot;pixie&quot; image cultivated on the <em>Debut</em> and <em>Post</em> albums. Bj&lt;U+00F6&gt;rk worked with producers <a href="Mark_Bell_(LFO)" title="wikilink">Mark Bell</a> of <a href="LFO_(band)" title="wikilink">LFO</a> and <a href="Howie_B" title="wikilink">Howie B</a> on the album, as well as <a href="Eumir_Deodato" title="wikilink">Eumir Deodato</a>; numerous remixes followed. <em>Homogenic</em> was her first conceptually self-contained album and is regarded as one of Bj&lt;U+00F6&gt;rk's most experimental and extroverted works to date, with enormous beats that reflect the landscape of Iceland, most notably in the song &quot;<a href="J&lt;U+00F3&gt;ga" class="uri" title="wikilink">J&lt;U+00F3&gt;ga</a>&quot;, which fuses lush strings with rocky electronic crunches. The emotionally-charged album contains a string of memorable music videos, several of which received airplay on <a href="MTV" class="uri" title="wikilink">MTV</a>, especially the epic &quot;<a href="Bachelorette_(song)" title="wikilink">Bachelorette</a>&quot; directed by frequent collaborator <a href="Michel_Gondry" title="wikilink">Michel Gondry</a> and &quot;<a href="All_is_Full_of_Love" title="wikilink">All is Full of Love</a>&quot;, which was directed by <a href="Chris_Cunningham" title="wikilink">Chris Cunningham</a> and became an alt-rock hit in 1999. The album eventually reached <a href="gold_record" title="wikilink">gold status</a> in the States in 2001 and platinum in 2006. In 2000 Bj&lt;U+00F6&gt;rk played the role of Selma, a blind factory worker in <a href="Lars_Von_Trier" title="wikilink">Lars Von Trier</a>'s <em><a href="Dancer_in_the_Dark" title="wikilink">Dancer in the Dark</a></em>, and subsequently recorded the soundtrack, simply named &quot;<a href="Selmasongs" class="uri" title="wikilink">Selmasongs</a>&quot;.</p>
<h3 id="vespertine">Vespertine</h3>
<p><img src="Verspertine_(album).jpg" title="fig:Album cover of Vespertine (2002)." alt="Album cover of Vespertine (2002)." /> In 2001 the album <em><a href="Vespertine" class="uri" title="wikilink">Vespertine</a></em> was released. This album saw Bj&lt;U+00F6&gt;rk creating an introverted, internal, personal world of microbeats and tiny rhythms. The album featured chamber orchestras, choirs, very hushed vocals and personal, vulnerable themes. She collaborated with experimental sound manipulators <a href="Matmos" class="uri" title="wikilink">Matmos</a>, <a href="Denmark" class="uri" title="wikilink">Denmark</a>-based DJ Thomas Knak, and the experimental harpist <a href="Zeena_Parkins" title="wikilink">Zeena Parkins</a> for the album. Lyrical sources included the <a href="United_States" title="wikilink">American</a> poet <a href="E._E._Cummings" title="wikilink">E. E. Cummings</a> and the American independent filmmaker <a href="Harmony_Korine" title="wikilink">Harmony Korine</a>. To coincide with the album's release, Bj&lt;U+00F6&gt;rk released a <a href="coffee_table_book" title="wikilink">coffee table book</a> of loose prose and photographs titled &quot;Bj&lt;U+00F6&gt;rk&quot;. <a href="http://unit.bjork.com/specials/book/book3.htm">3</a> Bj&lt;U+00F6&gt;rk embarked on a tour of theatres and opera-houses in Europe and North America in support of the album, accompanied by the musicians <a href="Matmos" class="uri" title="wikilink">Matmos</a>, <a href="Zeena_Parkins" title="wikilink">Zeena Parkins</a> and an <a href="Inuit" class="uri" title="wikilink">Inuit</a> <a href="choir" class="uri" title="wikilink">choir</a>, whom she had held auditions for on a trip to <a href="Greenland" class="uri" title="wikilink">Greenland</a> prior to the tour. <a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/bjork/articles/story/5933169/bjork_gets_orchestric">4</a> At the time Vespertine was Bj&lt;U+00F6&gt;rk's quickest selling album ever, having sold 2 million copies by the end of 2001. <a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p><em>Vespertine</em> spawned three singles: &quot;<a href="Hidden_Place" title="wikilink">Hidden Place</a>&quot;, &quot;<a href="Pagan_Poetry" title="wikilink">Pagan Poetry</a>&quot;, and &quot;<a href="Cocoon_(song)" title="wikilink">Cocoon</a>.&quot; America's then-more independent and artistic music video channel, <a href="MTV2" class="uri" title="wikilink">MTV2</a>, played the album's first video, &quot;Hidden Place&quot;, pretty heavily, which was subsequently released as a DVD single. However, the next video, for &quot;Pagan Poetry&quot;, brought Bj&lt;U+00F6&gt;rk to an even higher level of controversy with the channel. The song's video features graphic piercings and Bj&lt;U+00F6&gt;rk's exposed nipples, as well as distorted images of sexual acts, which included vaginal penetration and <a href="fellatio" class="uri" title="wikilink">fellatio</a>. As a result, the clip was initially rarely shown by MTV, and certain parts (for example, Bj&lt;U+00F6&gt;rk's breasts) were censored out during the rare occasions when it was played. In 2002, the clip finally enjoyed unedited American airing as part of a late night special on MTV2 entitled <em>Most Controversial Music Videos</em>. The video for &quot;Cocoon&quot; also featured a seemingly naked Bj&lt;U+00F6&gt;rk, (actually wearing a close fitting bodysuit) this time with her nipples secreting a red thread that eventually enveloped the singer herself in a cocoon. The video was directed by <a href="Japan" title="wikilink">Japanese</a> artist Eiko Ishioka, and was not aired by MTV.</p>
<h3 id="family-tree-greatest-hits-live-box">Family Tree / Greatest Hits / Live Box</h3>
<p><img src="Family_Tree_(album).jpg" title="fig:Album cover of Family Tree (2002)." alt="Album cover of Family Tree (2002)." /> 2002 saw the appearance of the CD box set <em><a href="Family_Tree_(album)" title="wikilink">Family Tree</a></em> containing a retrospective of Bj&lt;U+00F6&gt;rk's career, comprising many previously unreleased versions of her compositions, including her work with the <a href="Brodsky_Quartet" title="wikilink">Brodsky Quartet</a>. Also released alongside <em>Family Tree</em> was the album <em><a href="Greatest_Hits_(Bj&lt;U+00F6&gt;rk)" title="wikilink">Greatest Hits</a></em>, a retrospective of the previous 10 years of her solo career as deemed by the public: the songs on the album were chosen by Bj&lt;U+00F6&gt;rk's fans through a poll on her website. Both releases sold poorly. A DVD edition of the CD was also released; it contained all of Bj&lt;U+00F6&gt;rk's solo music videos up to that point. The new single from the set, &quot;It's In Our Hands&quot;, charted in the UK at #37. The video, directed by <a href="Spike_Jonze" title="wikilink">Spike Jonze</a>, features a heavily pregnant Bj&lt;U+00F6&gt;rk.</p>
<p>In 2003, Bj&lt;U+00F6&gt;rk released a box set called <em><a href="Live_Box" title="wikilink">Live Box</a></em>, consisting of four CDs containing <a href="concert" title="wikilink">live recordings</a> of her previous albums and a DVD featuring a video of one track from each CD. Each of the four CDs were later released separately at a reduced price.</p>

</figure>
<p>2004 saw the release of Bj&lt;U+00F6&gt;rk's <em><a href="Med&lt;U+00FA&gt;lla" class="uri" title="wikilink">Med&lt;U+00FA&gt;lla</a></em>, in late August. <em>Med&lt;U+00FA&gt;lla</em> had been more of an impromptu piece of work after the two concept albums, but in the midst of production Bj&lt;U+00F6&gt;rk decided the album would work best as an entirely vocal-based album. The majority of the sounds on the album are created by vocalists (although these sounds are often electronically distorted). Bj&lt;U+00F6&gt;rk used the vocal skills of throat-singer <a href="Tanya_Tagaq_Gillis" title="wikilink">Tagaq</a>, <a href="Hip_hop_music" title="wikilink">hip hop</a> <a href="beatboxer" class="uri" title="wikilink">beatboxer</a> <a href="Rahzel" class="uri" title="wikilink">Rahzel</a>, Japanese beatboxer <a href="Dokaka" class="uri" title="wikilink">Dokaka</a>, avant-rocker <a href="Mike_Patton" title="wikilink">Mike Patton</a>, <a href="Soft_Machine" title="wikilink">Soft Machine</a> drummer/singer <a href="Robert_Wyatt" title="wikilink">Robert Wyatt</a>, and several <a href="choir" title="wikilink">choirs</a>; she again appropriated text from poet <a href="E._E._Cummings" title="wikilink">E. E. Cummings</a> for the song &quot;Sonnets/Unrealities XI.&quot; <em>Med&lt;U+00FA&gt;lla</em> became her highest ever charting album in the US, debuting at number 14.</p>
<p>In August 2004 Bj&lt;U+00F6&gt;rk performed the song &quot;<a href="Oceania_(song)" title="wikilink">Oceania</a>&quot; (from her <em>Med&lt;U+00FA&gt;lla</em> album) at the <a href="2004_Summer_Olympics_opening_ceremony" title="wikilink">Opening Ceremony</a> of the <a href="2004_Summer_Olympics" title="wikilink">2004 Summer Olympics</a> in <a href="Athens" class="uri" title="wikilink">Athens</a>, <a href="Greece" class="uri" title="wikilink">Greece</a>. In typical Bj&lt;U+00F6&gt;rk style, her performance was one of the more unusual ones of the event. As she sang, her dress slowly unravelled to reveal a 10,000 square foot (900 m&lt;U+00B2&gt;) map of the world, which she let flow over all of the Olympic athletes. The song &quot;Oceania&quot; was written especially for the occasion and features the vocals of <a href="Shlomo_(human_beatbox)" title="wikilink">Shlomo</a>, a <a href="Leeds" class="uri" title="wikilink">Leeds</a>-based <a href="beatbox" title="wikilink">beatboxer</a>, and a London choir. An alternate version of the song began circulating on the internet with additional vocals by <a href="Kelis" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kelis</a>. It originally appeared on the promotional &quot;Oceania&quot; single released to radio stations and later became available to the public as a b-side of the &quot;<a href="Who_Is_It_(Bj&lt;U+00F6&gt;rk_song)" title="wikilink">Who Is It</a>&quot; single, which charted at number twenty-six in the UK. This was followed in early <a href="2005" class="uri" title="wikilink">2005</a> by &quot;<a href="Triumph_of_a_Heart" title="wikilink">Triumph of a Heart</a>&quot;, charting at number thirty-one. A video for the potential next single, &quot;<a href="Where_Is_the_Line" title="wikilink">Where Is the Line?</a>&quot;, was filmed in collaboration with the Icelandic artist <a href="Gabr&lt;U+00ED&gt;ela_Fridriksd&lt;U+00F3&gt;ttir" title="wikilink">Gabr&lt;U+00ED&gt;ela Fridriksd&lt;U+00F3&gt;ttir</a> in late 2004, and was released exclusively on the &quot;<a href="The_Med&lt;U+00FA&gt;lla_Videos" title="wikilink">Med&lt;U+00FA&gt;lla Videos</a>&quot; DVD.</p>
<p>Other than these few performances, no concerts or tours were arranged to promote <em>Med&lt;U+00FA&gt;lla</em>. Bj&lt;U+00F6&gt;rk said in numerous interviews that this was because she wished to immediately continue writing and recording yet another new album. She spoke to <em><a href="Rolling_Stone" title="wikilink">Rolling Stone</a></em> in June 2004: &quot;Every album I've done, the minute that it's done, I feel really lubricated and, like, 'Wow, now I can write an album in five minutes'...

From over 600 responses, Bj&lt;U+00F6&gt;rk and her co-writer Graham Massey, picked the best twenty to appear on the album. The album was released in April in the UK and in late May 2005 the US.

<p><img src="Bj&lt;U+00F6&gt;rk_and_Lars_von_Trier_(Cannes_Film_Festival).jpg" title="fig:Bj&lt;U+00F6&gt;rk Gu&lt;U+00F0&gt;mundsd&lt;U+00F3&gt;ttir and Lars von Trier at the 53rd Cannes Film Festival on May 21, 2000." alt="Bj&lt;U+00F6&gt;rk Gu&lt;U+00F0&gt;mundsd&lt;U+00F3&gt;ttir and Lars von Trier at the 53rd Cannes Film Festival on May 21, 2000." width="300" /> Bj&lt;U+00F6&gt;rk's intermittent acting career began in 1990, when she appeared in <em><a href="The_Juniper_Tree" title="wikilink">The Juniper Tree</a></em>, a tale of <a href="witchcraft" class="uri" title="wikilink">witchcraft</a> based on the <a href="Brothers_Grimm" title="wikilink">Brothers Grimm</a> story of the same name. Bj&lt;U+00F6&gt;rk played the role of Margit, a girl whose mother has been killed for practicing witchcraft. Bj&lt;U+00F6&gt;rk also had an uncredited role in 1994's <em><a href="Pr&lt;U+00EA&gt;t-&lt;U+00E0&gt;-Porter_(film)" title="wikilink">Pr&lt;U+00EA&gt;t-&lt;U+00E0&gt;-Porter</a></em>.</p>
<p>Bj&lt;U+00F6&gt;rk also prominently appeared in the 2005 documentary <em><a href="Screaming_Masterpiece" title="wikilink">Screaming Masterpiece</a></em>, which delves into the Icelandic music scene. The movie features archive footage of The Sugarcubes and <a href="Tappi_T&lt;U+00ED&gt;karrass" title="wikilink">Tappi T&lt;U+00ED&gt;karrass</a>, and an ongoing conversation with Bj&lt;U+00F6&gt;rk herself.</p>
<p>In 1999, Bj&lt;U+00F6&gt;rk was asked to write and produce the musical score for the film <em>Dancer in the Dark</em>, a genre-bending musical via drama about an immigrant named Selma who is struggling to pay for an operation to prevent her son from going blind. Director <a href="Lars_von_Trier" title="wikilink">Lars von Trier</a> eventually asked her to consider playing the role of Selma, a proposal she initially turned down. He then threatened to stop the project, which would have made all the musical work she had already done useless. Eventually, she accepted. Filming began in early 1999, and the film debuted in 2000 at the 53rd <a href="Cannes_Film_Festival" title="wikilink">Cannes Film Festival</a>. The film received the <a href="Palme_d&#39;Or" title="wikilink">Palme d'Or</a>, and Bj&lt;U+00F6&gt;rk received the best actress award for her role, yet she described the shoot as so physically and emotionally trying that she has sworn off acting ever again. She allegedly had been under pressure from Von Trier about differences over the way she played her character. This was a rumour, however, that was put to rest in numerous interviews. Bj&lt;U+00F6&gt;rk later stated that she always wanted to do one musical in her life, and this was the one. She also said that she could not do movies and music at the same time. The soundtrack Bj&lt;U+00F6&gt;rk created for the film was released with the title <em>Selmasongs</em>. The album features a duet with <a href="Thom_Yorke" title="wikilink">Thom Yorke</a> of <a href="Radiohead" class="uri" title="wikilink">Radiohead</a> titled &quot;I've Seen it All&quot;, which was nominated for an <a href="Academy_Award_for_Best_Song" title="wikilink">Academy Award for Best Song</a> and performed at the 2001 Oscars. She was invited to record <a href="Gollum&#39;s_Song" title="wikilink">Gollum's Song</a> for the film <em><a href="The_Lord_of_the_Rings:_The_Two_Towers_(film)" title="wikilink">The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers</a></em>, but declined the invitation, as she was then pregnant; the track was instead recorded by her fellow Icelander <a href="Emil&lt;U+00ED&gt;ana_Torrini" title="wikilink">Emil&lt;U+00ED&gt;ana Torrini</a>.</p>
<p>Her New York-based long-time boyfriend <a href="Matthew_Barney" title="wikilink">Matthew Barney</a> is a major contemporary artist. Bj&lt;U+00F6&gt;rk collaborated with him on the experimental art film <a href="Drawing_Restraint_9" title="wikilink">Drawing Restraint 9</a>, a dialogueless exploration of <a href="Japanese_culture" title="wikilink">Japanese culture</a>. Bj&lt;U+00F6&gt;rk and Matthew both appear in the film. She says that what she does in the film isn't acting; it's being a human sculpture. She is also responsible for the film's soundtrack, her second after 2000's <em><a href="Selmasongs" class="uri" title="wikilink">Selmasongs</a></em>.</p>
<h2 id="name-and-ancestry">Name and ancestry</h2>
<p>Bj&lt;U+00F6&gt;rk usually goes by her first name only. This is not a stage name or affectation; it is normal for an Icelander to be referred to by his or her first name, as the last name simply indicates the name of the father (or occasionally the mother). See <a href="Icelandic_name" title="wikilink">Icelandic naming conventions</a>.</p>
<p><em>Bj&lt;U+00F6&gt;rk</em> means &quot;a <a href="birch" class="uri" title="wikilink">birch</a> tree&quot; in <a href="Icelandic_language" title="wikilink">Icelandic</a> (the meaning of Icelandic names is often transparent), cognate with <a href="Old_English_language" title="wikilink">Old English</a> <em>beorc</em> and the modern English word. Though many English-speakers pronounce her name &quot;Byork&quot; (those unfamiliar with her will pronounce it as it is spelled), a more accurate approximation would be &quot;Byirk&quot;, which she has pointed out rhymes with &quot;jerk&quot;. <a href="http://ebweb.at/ortner/tia/97/babe9706/babe9706.html">25</a> <em>Gu&lt;U+00F0&gt;mundsd&lt;U+00F3&gt;ttir</em> is pronounced roughly &quot;GVUTH-muns-doh-tear&quot;, and means &quot;Gu&lt;U+00F0&gt;mundur's daughter&quot;. <img src="Bjorkswandresspromo.jpg" title="fig:Bj&lt;U+00F6&gt;rk in a promo photo with the infamous swan dress" alt="Bj&lt;U+00F6&gt;rk in a promo photo with the infamous swan dress" /></p>
<p>Bj&lt;U+00F6&gt;rk's father, <a href="Gu&lt;U+00F0&gt;mundur_Gunnarsson" title="wikilink">Gu&lt;U+00F0&gt;mundur Gunnarsson</a>, is a well known union leader in Iceland and was nationally recognized before his daughter became famous. Her mother's name is <a href="Hildur_R&lt;U+00FA&gt;na_Hauksd&lt;U+00F3&gt;ttir" title="wikilink">Hildur R&lt;U+00FA&gt;na Hauksd&lt;U+00F3&gt;ttir</a>, and has also been politically active.</p>
<p>Although many have commented on her Oriental/<a href="Inuit" class="uri" title="wikilink">Inuit</a> facial features (she was teased as a child with the taunt 'China girl'), Bjork denies any such in her ancestry. However she is not 'typical' in looks compared to other Icelandic people (but neither unique either). Some have speculated <a href="Sami_people" title="wikilink">Sami</a> descent in the long distant past.</p>
<h2 id="the-swan-dress">The Swan Dress</h2>
<p>At the <a href="73rd_Academy_Awards" title="wikilink">2001 Academy Awards</a>, Bj&lt;U+00F6&gt;rk raised eyebrows when she arrived wearing the flamboyantly quirky &quot;<a href="swan" class="uri" title="wikilink">swan</a> dress&quot;, designed by Marjan Pejoski, that was later featured on the &quot;Vespertine&quot; album cover. The dress drew widespread media attention&lt;U+2014&gt;both derision and praise&lt;U+2014&gt;and perhaps will go down as one of the most memorable dresses at an award show. That night's Academy Awards Host, <a href="Steve_Martin" title="wikilink">Steve Martin</a> joked, &quot;I was going to wear my swan but to me they're so last year.&quot; <a href="Joan_Rivers" title="wikilink">Joan Rivers</a> has commented that &quot;Bj&lt;U+00F6&gt;rk was brilliant [for] showing up in that swan dress.&quot; <a href="Ellen_DeGeneres" title="wikilink">Ellen DeGeneres</a> later wore it for comic effect at the 2001 <a href="Emmy_Awards" title="wikilink">Emmy Awards</a>; <a href="Kevin_James" title="wikilink">Kevin James</a> also did the same at the 2001 <a href="People&#39;s_Choice_Awards" title="wikilink">People's Choice Awards</a>. At the <a href="2006_Academy_Awards" title="wikilink">2006 Academy Awards</a> <a href="Jon_Stewart" title="wikilink">Jon Stewart</a> alluded to it in reference to the <a href="Dick_Cheney_hunting_incident" title="wikilink">Dick Cheney hunting incident</a>: &quot;Bj&lt;U+00F6&gt;rk couldn't be here tonight... she was trying on her Oscar dress and <a href="Dick_Cheney" title="wikilink">Dick Cheney</a> shot her.&quot;</p>
<p>In an episode of cartoon series <a href="Fairly_Oddparents" title="wikilink">Fairly Oddparents</a>, Wanda's twin Blonda attends an award ceremony in a swan dress patterned after Bj&lt;U+00F6&gt;rk's.</p>
<p>Also, in the movie <a href="White_Chicks" title="wikilink">White Chicks</a>, both actors can be seen in swan dresses at a fashion show. The joke goes that the two actors &quot;have no taste in clothes&quot; and therefore wear the dresses without qualms but it turns out to be a prank by the Vandergeld sisters.</p>
<h2 id="personal-life">Personal life</h2>
<p>Bj&lt;U+00F6&gt;rk and her partner, contemporary media artist <a href="Matthew_Barney" title="wikilink">Matthew Barney</a>, have a daughter, &lt;U+00CD&gt;sad&lt;U+00F3&gt;ra, born <a href="October_3" title="wikilink">October 3</a>, <a href="2002" class="uri" title="wikilink">2002</a>. Bj&lt;U+00F6&gt;rk also has a son, <a href="Sindri_Eldon_&lt;U+00DE&gt;&lt;U+00F3&gt;rsson" title="wikilink">Sindri Eldon &lt;U+00DE&gt;&lt;U+00F3&gt;rsson</a>, born <a href="June_8" title="wikilink">June 8</a>, <a href="1986" class="uri" title="wikilink">1986</a>, with <a href="&lt;U+00DE&gt;&lt;U+00F3&gt;r_Eldon" title="wikilink">&lt;U+00DE&gt;&lt;U+00F3&gt;r Eldon</a>, who was her bandmate in the Sugarcubes. Sindri is a journalist and plays bass for several bands at present.</p>
<p>Bj&lt;U+00F6&gt;rk has complained of being hounded by paparazzi and in 1996 two separate incidents gave the media much to chew on. First, after a long flight to Thailand an exhausted Bj&lt;U+00F6&gt;rk emerged from her aircraft at Don Muang Airport with her then ten-year-old son to find a horde of journalists and cameramen waiting to greet her. When one reporter greeted Bj&lt;U+00F6&gt;rk by saying &quot;Welcome to Bangkok&quot;, Bj&lt;U+00F6&gt;rk attacked her and landed several blows before the melee was broken up. Bjork even tried to go back and finish the job, but was helped onto a bus. Bj&lt;U+00F6&gt;rk claimed that this reporter stuck a microphone in her son's face, prompting her to attack, though many have said that there is no evidence of this on tape. <a href="http://4um.bjork.com">26</a>. Her record label said the reporter had been pestering her for four days. Bj&lt;U+00F6&gt;rk later called the reporter and apologized, and the reporter declined to press charges against her.</p>
<p>Later that year a deranged fan from Florida named Ricardo Lopez filmed himself in the process of making an acid bomb intended to kill Bj&lt;U+00F6&gt;rk. The nearly 20 hours of videotape describe Lopez's obsession with Bj&lt;U+00F6&gt;rk, the construction of the device, his thoughts on love, and general rantings. The video footage continues after his mailing the bomb and ends dramatically as Lopez, believing that his device would soon kill Bj&lt;U+00F6&gt;rk, applies bizarre facepaint and shoots himself on camera. He was successful in taking his own life, but the tape was seen by police and the package was intercepted in time to save Bj&lt;U+00F6&gt;rk. <a href="http://archive.salon.com/people/bc/2001/05/01/bjork/print.html">27</a></p>
<p>Already a private person, Bj&lt;U+00F6&gt;rk was reluctant to comment on either of these incidents and later told <em><a href="The_Guardian" title="wikilink">The Guardian</a></em>: &quot;It just got a bit much.&quot;</p>
