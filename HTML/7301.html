<p>The season started off with the heavily publicized &quot;<a href="Who_Shot_Mr._Burns?_(Part_Two)" title="wikilink">Who Shot Mr. Burns?

The special was criticized for taking the publicity of the episode too far. Several critics said the special tainted Walsh's credibility and was described as gimmicky,<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> tacky<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> and &quot;blatant groveling for viewers&quot;.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> The episode &quot;<a href="Lisa_the_Vegetarian" title="wikilink">Lisa the Vegetarian</a>&quot; features one of the few permanent character changes in the series when <a href="Lisa_Simpson" title="wikilink">Lisa</a> officially becomes a vegetarian. The episode had been pitched by <a href="David_X._Cohen" title="wikilink">David S.

<th><p>ShortSummary=In an attempt to show his kids how hip he is, Homer takes Bart and Lisa to the Hullabalooza music festival where Homer is hired as a sideshow freak who can withstand the force of cannonball blasts. As a result, Homer gets to go on tour with the festival and suddenly finds himself living the high life. As the tour approaches a stop in Springfield, Homer's stomach begins to hurt and he is sent to a doctor who advises Homer that if he performs his act one more time, his stomach will burst and he will die. Homer shrugs this news off, not wanting to lose his popularity. At first he decides to do his job, but at the last second he loses his nerve and dodges the cannonball. He is released from the festival and goes back to being not respected by his children.<br />
