<p>&quot;<strong>Andy and April's Fancy Party</strong>&quot; (sometimes referred to as &quot;<strong>Fancy Party</strong>&quot;) is the ninth episode of the <a href="Parks_and_Recreation_(season_3)" title="wikilink">third season</a> of the American comedy television series <em><a href="Parks_and_Recreation" title="wikilink">Parks and Recreation</a></em>, and the 39th overall episode of the series. It originally aired on <a href="NBC" class="uri" title="wikilink">NBC</a> in the United States on April 14, 2011. In the episode, <a href="Andy_Dwyer" title="wikilink">Andy</a> and <a href="April_Ludgate" title="wikilink">April</a> hold a dinner party, which turns out to be a surprise wedding, much to <a href="Leslie_Knope" title="wikilink">Leslie</a>'s concern. Meanwhile, <a href="List_of_Parks_and_Recreation_characters#Ben_Wyatt" title="wikilink">Ben</a> mulls whether to remain in Pawnee or return to his old job in <a href="Indianapolis" class="uri" title="wikilink">Indianapolis</a>, and <a href="Ann_Perkins" title="wikilink">Ann</a> feels extremely uncomfortable while attending a singles mixer.</p>
<p>The episode was written by Katie Dippold and directed by Michael Trim. The wedding between Andy and April was a culmination of a romantic subplot between the two characters that began in the <a href="Parks_and_Recreation_(season_2)" title="wikilink">second season</a> episode &quot;<a href="Hunting_Trip_(Parks_and_Recreation)" title="wikilink">Hunting Trip</a>&quot;. The <em>Parks and Recreation</em> staff tried to keep the wedding secret to surprise viewers, but NBC accidentally ran a commercial advertising the wedding two months earlier, after the episode &quot;<a href="Ron_&amp;_Tammy:_Part_Two" title="wikilink">Ron &amp; Tammy: Part Two</a>. Series co-creator <a href="Michael_Schur" title="wikilink">Michael Schur</a> initially said the promo was meant to refer to <a href="Ron_Swanson" title="wikilink">Ron</a> and his ex-wife <a href="List_of_Parks_and_Recreation_characters#Tammy_Swanson" title="wikilink">Tammy</a>, but later admitted it was an error.</p>
<p>&quot;April and Andy's Fancy Party&quot; featured several guest performances by actors who appeared in previous episodes, including <a href="Ben_Schwartz" title="wikilink">Ben Schwartz</a> as <a href="List_of_Parks_and_Recreation_characters#Jean-Ralphio" title="wikilink">Jean-Ralphio</a>, Josh Duvendeck and Blake Lee as Ben and Darek, Minni Jo Mazzola as Natalie Ludgate, and Mark Rivers, Andrew Burlinson and <a href="Alan_Yang" title="wikilink">Alan Yang</a> as Andy's band-mates. According to <a href="Nielsen_ratings" title="wikilink">Nielsen Media Research</a>, the episode was seen by 5.16 million household viewers, a slight increase over the previous original episode, &quot;<a href="Camping_(Parks_and_Recreation)" title="wikilink">Camping</a>&quot;. It received generally positive reviews.</p>
<h2 id="plot">Plot</h2>
<p>During a <a href="cold_open" title="wikilink">cold open</a> scene, <a href="Ron_Swanson" title="wikilink">Ron</a> (<a href="Nick_Offerman" title="wikilink">Nick Offerman</a>) horrifies the entire parks department by apparently pulling an aching tooth out of his own mouth with a pair of pliers. He later admits it was a prank, as a dentist had removed the tooth the previous day. Later, <a href="Andy_Dwyer" title="wikilink">Andy</a> (<a href="Chris_Pratt" title="wikilink">Chris Pratt</a>) and <a href="April_Ludgate" title="wikilink">April</a> (<a href="Aubrey_Plaza" title="wikilink">Aubrey Plaza</a>) invite everyone to a dinner party at the home of Andy's band-mate Burly (Andrew Burlinson), where Andy is living. <a href="Ben_Wyatt_(Parks_and_Recreation)" title="wikilink">Ben</a> (<a href="Adam_Scott_(actor)" title="wikilink">Adam Scott</a>) tells <a href="Leslie_Knope" title="wikilink">Leslie</a> (<a href="Amy_Poehler" title="wikilink">Amy Poehler</a>) that his boss in <a href="Indianapolis" class="uri" title="wikilink">Indianapolis</a> wants him back on the road, but he has also been offered a job to work under <a href="Chris_Traeger" title="wikilink">Chris</a> (<a href="Rob_Lowe" title="wikilink">Rob Lowe</a>) in Pawnee. Although Leslie wants Ben to stay, she is hesitant to say so outright, disappointing him and leaving him conflicted over which job to take.</p>
<p>At the party, Leslie discovers Andy and April plan to surprise everyone by getting married that night. Leslie spends most of the party trying to dissuade them, since they have been dating less than a month and have no place to live. However, Ron believes it is not Leslie's place to interfere with their decision. <a href="Tom_Haverford" title="wikilink">Tom</a> (<a href="Aziz_Ansari" title="wikilink">Aziz Ansari</a>) is thrilled when Andy makes him his best man, but his excitement lessens when Andy also asks Ron, Chris, and several others to be his &quot;best men&quot;. Tom tries to throw an impromptu bachelor party and give a speech to make himself the &quot;best&quot; best man, but fails each time.</p>
<p>Although Leslie plans to object during the ceremony, she cannot bring herself to do it and comes to accept the marriage. Andy and April officially become man and wife. Afterward, Ron explains to Leslie that she did not object because deep down she knew that Andy and April would get married no matter what, and that there is no correct way to do things when it comes to matters of the heart, using his own three former marriages as an example. During the reception, April privately tells Leslie how much she appreciates her, flattering Leslie. Andy makes a speech to the guests, where he calls Tom his &quot;best&quot; best man, much to Tom's delight. He tells the crowd that life is short and he and April simply did what made them happy. Taking Andy&lt;U+2019&gt;s advice, Leslie asks Ben to stay in Pawnee, and he surprises her by revealing that he has already accepted Chris' job offer.</p>
<p>In a <a href="subplot" class="uri" title="wikilink">subplot</a>, <a href="Ann_Perkins" title="wikilink">Ann</a> (<a href="Rashida_Jones" title="wikilink">Rashida Jones</a>) goes to a singles mixer where she is extremely uncomfortable. She runs into <a href="Donna_Meagle" title="wikilink">Donna</a> (<a href="Retta" class="uri" title="wikilink">Retta</a>), who at first views Ann as competition, but then offers her advice after witnessing Ann's awkward flirting. When Ann hears about Andy getting married from Leslie, she considers going home, as she and Andy dated for several years. Donna tells Ann to forget her past and enjoy herself in the present. Ann ends up having a good time at the mixer and gets several phone numbers.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;In an effort to undo the spoiler, we publicly stated, in a number of interviews, that NBC had just accidentally gotten the character names wrong, and that there was no upcoming Andy-April wedding. We sincerely hope that fans of the show are cool with us gently lying to them, in an effort to maintain the surprise nuptials as much as we could. Now if you'll excuse us, we have to go shoot the season finale surprise Jerry-Donna wedding scene.&quot;</p>

<h3 id="reviews">Reviews</h3>

<p>Alan Sepinwall of HitFix called it &quot;one of the funniest, sweetest, just plain best episodes of this season of this great comedy&quot;, and that it embodied &quot;intoxicating mix of laughs and sweetness that &quot;Parks and Rec&quot; consistently nails&quot;. Sepinwall particularly praisde the scene when April declared her love for Leslie, and enjoyed the comedic pairing of Ann and Donna.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> <em><a href="Time_(magazine)" title="wikilink">Time</a></em> magazine writer <a href="James_Poniewozik" title="wikilink">James Poniewozik</a> said the episode showed <em>Parks and Recreation</em> in &quot;top form&quot;, and he praised the episode for avoiding television cliches about weddings. In most shows, he wrote, April and Andy would have been persuaded to stop the wedding at the last moment, or Andy would have panicked after realizing the enormity of what he had done.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> Matt Fowler of <a href="IGN" class="uri" title="wikilink">IGN</a> called the episode &quot;charming, effortless and hilarious&quot; and wrote &quot;the strength of this episode was that it actually convinced us all that April and Andy getting married, after just a month of dating, was a great idea&quot;.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> <a href="TV_Guide" title="wikilink">TV Guide</a> writer Matt Roush called &quot;Andy and April's Fancy Wedding&quot; the highlight of the night among NBC's Thursday comedy shows, and said he particularly loved the scene with Ron Swanson pulling out his tooth, and another later scene where Ron criticized Chris for bringing a vegetarian loaf to the party instead of cake.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a></p>
<p><a href="ChicagoNow" class="uri" title="wikilink">ChicagoNow</a> writer Andy Daglas said the fact that Andy and April's wedding was subdued, not overhyped in commercials to attract ratings, shows how much the writers understand and respect their characters. He also praised the episode's blend of &quot;humor and heart&quot;, of which he said: &quot;No show on the air, and few shows I can think of ever, does it better.&quot;<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> <a href="Zap2it" class="uri" title="wikilink">Zap2it</a> writer Rick Porter said he was surprised by the wedding twist, particularly by the fact that the wedding was not stopped at the last moment by a &quot;TV-style complication&quot;. He also praised the subplot with Ann and Donna, and said he hoped the two characters would continue to interact with each other throughout the season.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a> <em><a href="The_Atlantic" title="wikilink">The Atlantic</a></em> writer Scott Meslow said &quot;Andy and April's Fancy Party&quot; showed how well the April and Andy characters have developed since their romantic story arc began in the second season episode &quot;<a href="Hunting_Trip" title="wikilink">Hunting Trip</a>&quot;. Meslow said the episode &quot;couldn't have been better&quot; and was even effective during unabashed sentimental scenes, like the wedding itself and April voicing her appreciation for Leslie.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a> Steve Heisler of <a href="The_A.V._Club" title="wikilink">The A.V. Club</a> said the wedding felt appropriate for the two characters, and he enjoyed the progression of Leslie going from dreading the wedding to accepting it. Heisler wrote, &quot;Truly, I don't think I've ever watched an episode of <em>Parks &amp; Rec</em> without feeling great at the end.&quot;<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a></p>
<p>Eric Sundermann of Hollywood.com said the fact that the wedding scene works shows how genuine the characters are and how well they are presented by the writers. Sundermann also praised the cold open with Ron ripping his tooth out, and and said he enjoyed the way Ann Perkins' character has continued to develop through the season.<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a> Steve Kandell of <em><a href="New_York_(magazine)" title="wikilink">New York</a></em> magazine called April and Andy perhaps the &quot;most convincingly matched and resoundingly sympathetic couple in sitcom history&quot;, and said their storylines have been handled much more effectively than those of <a href="Jim_Halpert" title="wikilink">Jim Halpert</a> and <a href="Pam_Halpert" title="wikilink">Pam Beesly</a> in the NBC comedy <em><a href="The_Office_(U.S._TV_series)" title="wikilink">The Office</a></em>. Kandell was more critical of the Ann character, and said she did not seem to fit as a part of the show anymore.<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a> Some reviews were less positive. <em><a href="Entertainment_Weekly" title="wikilink">Entertainment Weekly</a></em> writer Hillary Busis said there were individual elements of the episode she enjoyed, but felt the wedding happened too quickly and the lack of buildup reduced the tension leading up to the event.<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a> Joel Keller of <a href="Weblogs,_Inc.#TV_Squad" title="wikilink">TV Squad</a> said, &quot;In a mostly stellar season, this one sits near the bottom of the list.&quot; Keller said the wedding ruined an otherwise funny episode, and that it felt ineffective and rushed because April and Andy were fighting with each other only four episodes earlier. He also criticized the Ann Perkins character: &quot;I've never seen Rashida Jones play a character this wishy-washy before, and it's not pleasant to watch.&quot;<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a></p>
