<p>Co-creator <a href="Sylvia_Anderson" title="wikilink">Sylvia Anderson</a> has praised &quot;The Cham-Cham&quot; for its &quot;charm&quot; and the imagination behind the depiction of the Paradise Peaks resort, although she argues that the plot is &quot;far-fetched&quot;,<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> while Supermarionation expert Stephen La Rivi&lt;U+00E8&gt;re values the episode for its technical accomplishments in addition to its scripting.<ref name="La Rivi<U+00E8>re, 128&quot;/&gt; Historian <a href="Nicholas_J._Cull" title="wikilink">Nicholas J.

<h2 id="plot">Plot</h2>
<p>Three RTL2 cargo aircraft on missile shipment runs have each been shot down by unidentified fighter aircraft after take-off from Matthews Field <a href="USAF" class="uri" title="wikilink">USAF</a> Base. On <a href="Tracy_Island" title="wikilink">Tracy Island</a>, <a href="Alan_Tracy" title="wikilink">Alan</a> points out that each attack has coincided with a live performance of &quot;Dangerous Game&quot; from the hit group Cass Carnaby Five, broadcast on Radio Maxwell. <a href="Brains_(Thunderbirds)" title="wikilink">Brains</a> and Alan set to work on a recording of the latest transmission to determine whether the tune contains a hidden code intended to disrupt the RTL2 flights.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <a href="Jeff_Tracy" title="wikilink">Jeff</a> assigns <a href="Tin-Tin_Kyrano" title="wikilink">Tin-Tin</a> and <a href="Lady_Penelope" title="wikilink">Lady Penelope</a> &lt;U+2014&gt; the latter posing as a singer, &quot;Wanda Lamour&quot; &lt;U+2014&gt; to an <a href="undercover" class="uri" title="wikilink">undercover</a> mission to Paradise Peaks, a luxurious <a href="Swiss_Alps" title="wikilink">Swiss Alps</a> hotel that is currently playing host to Carnaby and his band. <a href="Aloysius_&quot;Nosey&quot;_Parker" title="wikilink">Parker</a> secures a job at the bar. Carnaby's manager is the suspicious Mr Olsen, who often makes late changes to the arrangement of &quot;Dangerous Game&quot; before the band performs live on-air. Penelope and Tin-Tin ski to Olsen's residence and film him operating a computer that is <a href="Code" title="wikilink">decoding</a> musical notes into a message revealing the time of the next RTL2 flight.</p>
<p>Realising that he has had unexpected visitors, Olsen contacts his associate &lt;U+2014&gt; Banino, a waiter &lt;U+2014&gt; with orders to dispose of the International Rescue agents. Parker overhears the telephone conversation and thwarts Banino's attempt to kill Penelope and Tin-Tin with a <a href="sniper_rifle" title="wikilink">sniper rifle</a>, tumbling down the mountainside with him until his opponent is knocked unconscious. On Tracy Island, Brains identifies the computer in the film as a &quot;Cham-Cham&quot;. Jeff contacts the <a href="Federal_government_of_the_United_States" title="wikilink">authorities</a> in <a href="Washington,_D.C." title="wikilink">Washington, D.C.</a> to report International Rescue's findings, but the Matthews Field Commander refuses to cancel the next missile shipment.</p>
<p>That night, the Cass Carnaby Five start to perform Olsen's latest arrangement of &quot;Dangerous Game&quot; that will doom the upcoming RTL2 flight. At the last moment, Penelope, under the guise of Wanda Lamour, steps out onto the stage to sing a <a href="Lyrics" title="wikilink">lyrical</a> rendition of Brains' composition. Accepting the false coordinates encoded in the Radio Maxwell transmission, the hostile airbase that launched the earlier attacks misdirects its own fighters, who soon find themselves in the vicinity of Matthews Field. Landing at the scene in <em><a href="Thunderbird_1" title="wikilink">Thunderbird 1</a></em>, <a href="Scott_Tracy" title="wikilink">Scott</a> alerts the Commander and interceptors are launched to shoot down the enemy.</p>
<p>Knowing that Olsen will be out for revenge, Jeff dispatches <a href="Virgil_Tracy" title="wikilink">Virgil</a> and Alan to the Alps in <em><a href="Thunderbird_2" title="wikilink">Thunderbird 2</a></em> to recall Tin-Tin, Penelope and Parker. The International Rescue agents escape in the Paradise Peaks <a href="cable_car" title="wikilink">cable car</a>, only to be left speeding down the mountainside out of control after Olsen cuts through the lines at the terminus. With <em>Thunderbird 2</em>'s <a href="Electromagnetism" title="wikilink">electromagnetic</a> grabs unable to gain purchase on the car, Parker climbs onto the roof to snare the cables with the end of Penelope's umbrella and attach them himself. When the force of Virgil and Alan's <a href="Retrorocket" title="wikilink">retro-rockets</a> throws the butler into the air, he uses the umbrella to parachute back down. All are treated to a private piano recital of &quot;Dangerous Game&quot; from Cass before leaving Paradise Peaks.</p>
<h2 id="production">Production</h2>
<p>The penultimate episode to be filmed for Series One of <em><a href="Thunderbirds_(TV_series)" title="wikilink">Thunderbirds</a></em>, writer and director Alan Pattillo scripted &quot;The Cham-Cham&quot; to emulate classic <a href="Hollywood" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hollywood</a> musicals with its <a href="showbusiness" class="uri" title="wikilink">showbusiness</a> plot and its exotic setting of the Paradise Peaks resort.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> As an in-joke, Pattillo named Penelope's alias, Wanda Lamour, after one of the <em>Thunderbirds</em> puppeteers, Wanda Brown.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> Filming ran from November to December 1965.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> Since it had been difficult to obtain persuasive walks from the puppets for previous episodes, at the time of production it had been decided that such motions would be implied, rather than seen, through a &quot;bobbing motion&quot; resulting from a puppeteer moving a puppet's legs out of shot.<ref name="La Rivi<U+00E8>re, 128&quot;/&gt; The sequence in which <a href="Lady_Penelope_Creighton-Ward" title="wikilink">Lady Penelope</a> sings <a href="Brains_(Thunderbirds)" title="wikilink">Brains</a>' modified version of &quot;Dangerous Game&quot; required the character to <a href="waltz" class="uri" title="wikilink">waltz</a> the length of the Paradise Peaks ballroom set, necessitating that Brown move the legs just out of the frame while puppeteer <a href="Christine_Glanville" title="wikilink">Christine Glanville</a> orchestrated upper body movements from the overhead gantry.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<p>Co-creator <a href="Gerry_Anderson" title="wikilink">Gerry Anderson</a> recalls that skiing sequences had not been attempted in previous <a href="Supermarionation" class="uri" title="wikilink">Supermarionation</a> productions, but believes that the characters of Penelope and Tin-Tin are seen to ski in a realistic manner on their journey to Olsen's lodge.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> Anderson himself conceived the &quot;ski thrusters&quot; that the agents use to assist their uphill return to Paradise Peaks.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> Praising the visuals of &quot;The Cham-Cham&quot;, he summarises that the episode &quot;gave our <a href="Art_department" title="wikilink">art and design departments</a> a chance to show what they could really do, and they didn't let us down.&quot;<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> In a parallel to the episode filmed immediately before, &quot;<a href="Attack_of_the_Alligators!" title="wikilink">Attack of the Alligators!</a>&quot;, the technical complexity of &quot;The Cham-Cham&quot; meant that production finished almost one week behind schedule<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> and exceeded its budget.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> To compensate for the lost shooting time and production costs, the writers re-scripted the Series One finale as &quot;Security Hazard&quot;, a <a href="clip_show" title="wikilink">clip show</a> that makes extensive use of <a href="Flashback_(narrative)" title="wikilink">flashback</a> footage to reduce the financial burden of new scenes.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
<p>Although singer <a href="Ken_Barrie" title="wikilink">Ken Barrie</a> recorded lines to &quot;Dangerous Game&quot;, the production team ultimately replaced his sung rendition with an <a href="instrumental" class="uri" title="wikilink">instrumental</a> tune for all occasions in &quot;The Cham-Cham&quot; when the Cass Carnaby Five are performing.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> Reviewing the CD release of the original <em>Thunderbirds</em> soundtrack, Morag Reavley of the <a href="BBC_Online" title="wikilink">BBC Online</a> site describes the Penelope character's performance of &quot;Dangerous Game&quot; as &quot;slinky, sexy and slightly off-key, like a hung-over <a href="Zsa_Zsa_Gabor" title="wikilink">Zsa Zsa Gabor</a>&quot;.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> Co-creator and voice actress <a href="Sylvia_Anderson" title="wikilink">Sylvia Anderson</a> based her singing voice on that of the German actress and singer <a href="Marlene_Dietrich" title="wikilink">Marlene Dietrich</a>.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> An <a href="incidental_music" title="wikilink">incidental music</a> track from the <em><a href="Supercar_(TV_series)" title="wikilink">Supercar</a></em> episode &quot;Amazonian Adventure&quot;, titled &quot;Happy Flying&quot;, accompanies the shots of Penelope and Tin-Tin skiing to Olsen's lodge.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a></p>
