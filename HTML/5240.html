<h2 id="production">Production</h2>
<h3 id="conception">Conception</h3>
<p>The series began development in January 2004, when <a href="Lloyd_Braun_(media_executive)" title="wikilink">Lloyd Braun</a>, head of ABC at the time, ordered an initial script based on his concept of a cross between the movie <em><a href="Cast_Away" title="wikilink">Cast Away</a></em> and the popular reality show <em><a href="Survivor" class="uri" title="wikilink">Survivor</a></em>. Unhappy with the result and a subsequent re-write, Braun contacted J.J. Abrams, creator of the TV series <em><a href="Alias_(TV_series)" title="wikilink">Alias</a></em>, to write a new pilot script. Although initially hesitant, Abrams warmed to it, and eventually collaborated with Damon Lindelof to create the series' style and characters.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> The development of the show was constrained by tight deadlines, as it had been commissioned late in the 2004 season's development cycle. Despite the short schedule, the creative team remained flexible enough to modify or create characters to fit actors they wished to cast.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<p><em>Lost</em>'s two-part <a href="pilot_episode" title="wikilink">pilot episode</a> was the most expensive in the network's history, reportedly costing between <a href="United_States_dollar" title="wikilink">US$</a>10 and US$14 million,<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> compared to the average cost of an hour-long pilot in 2005 of US$4 million.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> The show, which debuted on <a href="September_22" title="wikilink">September 22</a>, <a href="2004" class="uri" title="wikilink">2004</a>, became one of the biggest critical and commercial successes of the <a href="2004_in_television" title="wikilink">2004 television season</a>. Along with fellow new series <em><a href="Desperate_Housewives" title="wikilink">Desperate Housewives</a></em>, <em>Lost</em> helped to reverse the flagging fortunes of ABC.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> Yet, before it had even aired, Lloyd Braun was <a href="Termination_of_employment" title="wikilink">fired</a> by executives at ABC's parent company, <a href="Disney" class="uri" title="wikilink">Disney</a>, because he had <a href="greenlight" title="wikilink">greenlighted</a> such an expensive and risky project.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
<p>The world-premiere of the pilot episode was screened at <a href="Comic-Con_International" title="wikilink">Comic-Con International</a>'s 2004 event in San Diego. <a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a><br />

<h3 id="episode-format">Episode format</h3>
<p><img src="Lost_title_card.jpg" title="fig:Lost&#39;s title card." alt="Lost&#39;s title card." width="225" /> Episodes have a distinct structure: following a recap of events relevant to the upcoming narrative, each show begins with a <a href="cold_open" title="wikilink">cold open</a>. At a dramatic juncture, the screen cuts to black and the title <a href="graphic" class="uri" title="wikilink">graphic</a>, slightly out-of-focus, glides towards the viewer accompanied by an ominous, discordant sound. The <a href="opening_credits" title="wikilink">opening credits</a> generally appear alphabetically by last name over the scenes that immediately follow. While there is a progressive <a href="story_arc" title="wikilink">story arc</a>, each episode relates events concurrently with pre-island <a href="flashback_(literary_technique)" title="wikilink">flashbacks</a> centered on a particular character. The majority of episodes end with a suspenseful <a href="twist_ending" title="wikilink">twist</a> or <a href="cliffhanger" class="uri" title="wikilink">cliffhanger</a>, revealed just seconds before a <a href="smash_cut" title="wikilink">smash cut</a> to black and the title graphic. Others, following a plot resolution, will finish with a reflective closing scene that precedes a simple <a href="fade_to_black" title="wikilink">fade out</a>. Shortly afterwards, a preview of out-of-sequence clips from the next episode is shown.</p>
<h3 id="music">Music</h3>

<p><em>Lost</em> features <a href="incidental_music" title="wikilink">incidental music</a> composed by Michael Giacchino, whose score is primarily orchestral and incorporates several recurring themes for events and characters. The score is performed by the <a href="Hollywood_Studio_Symphony_Orchestra" title="wikilink">Hollywood Studio Symphony Orchestra</a>. In the official Lost Podcast, Michael Giacchino revealed that he achieved some of the sounds for the score using unusual instruments, such as striking suspended pieces of the plane's <a href="fuselage" class="uri" title="wikilink">fuselage</a>.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
<p>On <a href="March_21" title="wikilink">March 21</a>, <a href="2006" class="uri" title="wikilink">2006</a>, the record label <a href="Var&lt;U+00E8&gt;se_Sarabande" title="wikilink">Var&lt;U+00E8&gt;se Sarabande</a> released the original television <a href="soundtrack" class="uri" title="wikilink">soundtrack</a> for <em>Lost</em>'s first season. The soundtrack included select full-length versions of the most popular themes of the season and the main title which was composed by series creator J.J. Abrams. Var&lt;U+00E8&gt;se Sarabande released a soundtrack featuring music from the second season of <em>Lost</em> on <a href="October_3" title="wikilink">October 3</a>, <a href="2006" class="uri" title="wikilink">2006</a>.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a></p>
<p>Pop culture songs have been used sparingly in the series, given the mainly orchestral score. When such songs are featured, they usually originate from a <a href="Diegesis#Film_sound_and_music" title="wikilink">diegetic</a> source, meaning that they are usually generated by an action of one of the characters. Examples are the various songs played on Hurley's portable CD player throughout the first season or the use of the record player (which included <a href="Cass_Elliot" title="wikilink">Cass Elliot's</a> &quot;<a href="Make_Your_Own_Kind_of_Music" title="wikilink">Make Your Own Kind of Music</a>&quot; in the second season premiere and <a href="Petula_Clark" title="wikilink">Petula Clark's</a> &quot;<a href="Downtown" class="uri" title="wikilink">Downtown</a>&quot; in the third season premiere).</p>
<p>In some international broadcasts, alternate music is utilized. For instance, in the <a href="Japan" title="wikilink">Japanese</a> broadcast of Lost, Season 1's <a href="Theme_music" title="wikilink">theme song</a> is &quot;Here I am&quot; by <a href="Chemistry_(band)" title="wikilink">Chemistry</a> and Season 2's theme song is &quot;<a href="losin&#39;" class="uri" title="wikilink">losin'</a>&quot; by <a href="Yuna_Ito" title="wikilink">Yuna Ito</a>.</p>
<h3 id="filming-locations">Filming locations</h3>
<p><em>Lost</em> is filmed (<a href="35mm" class="uri" title="wikilink">35mm</a>) almost entirely on the Hawaiian island of <a href="Oahu" class="uri" title="wikilink">Oahu</a>. The original island scenes for the pilot were filmed at <a href="Mokul&lt;U+0113&gt;&#39;ia,_Hawai&#39;i" title="wikilink">Mokul&lt;U+0113&gt;ia</a> Beach, near the northwest tip of the island. Later beach scenes take place in secluded spots of the famous <a href="North_Shore_(Oahu)" title="wikilink">North Shore</a>. Cave scenes in the first season were filmed on a <a href="sound_stage" title="wikilink">sound stage</a> built at a <a href="Xerox" class="uri" title="wikilink">Xerox</a> parts warehouse, which had been empty since an <a href="Byran_Uyesugi" title="wikilink">employee mass shooting</a> took place there in 1999.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> The soundstage and <a href="Film_production" title="wikilink">production</a> offices have since moved to the Hawaii Film Office-operated Hawaii Film Studio,<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> at which the sets depicting Season 2's &quot;Swan station&quot; and Season 3's &quot;Hydra station&quot; interiors were built.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> Various urban areas in and around <a href="Honolulu" class="uri" title="wikilink">Honolulu</a> are used as stand-ins for locations around the world, including <a href="Los_Angeles" title="wikilink">Los Angeles</a>, <a href="New_York" title="wikilink">New York</a>, <a href="Iowa" class="uri" title="wikilink">Iowa</a>, <a href="South_Korea" title="wikilink">South Korea</a>, <a href="Iraq" class="uri" title="wikilink">Iraq</a>, <a href="Nigeria" class="uri" title="wikilink">Nigeria</a>, <a href="England" class="uri" title="wikilink">England</a>, and <a href="Australia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Australia</a>.

<h3 id="online-distribution">Online distribution</h3>
<p>In addition to traditional terrestrial and satellite broadcasting, <em>Lost</em> has been at the forefront of new television distribution methods. It was one of the first series issued through <a href="Apple_Computer" title="wikilink">Apple's</a> <a href="iTunes_Store" title="wikilink">iTunes Store</a> service for playback on an <a href="iPod" class="uri" title="wikilink">iPod</a> or within the <a href="iTunes" class="uri" title="wikilink">iTunes</a> software. Since October 2005, new episodes, without commercials, have been available for download the day after they air on ABC.</p>
<p>In April 2006, <a href="The_Walt_Disney_Company" title="wikilink">Disney</a> announced that <em>Lost</em> would be available for free online in streaming format, with advertising, on ABC's website, as part of a two-month experiment of future distribution strategies. The trial, which ran from May to June 2006, caused a stir among network affiliates who were afraid of being cut out of advertising revenue. The streaming of <em>Lost</em> episodes direct from ABC's website was only available to viewers in the United States due to international licensing agreements.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a><a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a></p>
<p>The UK's <a href="Channel_4" title="wikilink">Channel 4</a> has also allowed access to the series online.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> Both parts of &quot;Pilot&quot; were available to watch for free, and other episodes cost <a href="Pound_sterling" title="wikilink">GB&lt;U+00A3&gt;</a>0.99 each. Season two installments are made available two weeks after their Channel 4 debut, and the episodes expire after several months. Due to licensing agreements, the service is only accessible in the UK. Channel 4 have now teamed up with NTL &amp; Telewest's On Demand function which allows the viewer to watch shows at any time. Select episodes from Season One and Season two are available to view for 24 hour rental for &lt;U+00A3&gt;0.99 although the list of episodes is not complete.</p>
<p>As of third quarter, 2006, France's <a href="TF1" class="uri" title="wikilink">TF1</a> has allowed online access to the French version of season two; episodes cost <a href="Euro" title="wikilink">&lt;U+20AC&gt;</a>1.99.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> Each episode is issued online just after being broadcast.</p>

<p>The same set was released on <a href="November_30" title="wikilink">November 30</a>, <a href="2005" class="uri" title="wikilink">2005</a> in Region 4, and on <a href="January_16" title="wikilink">January 16</a>, <a href="2006" class="uri" title="wikilink">2006</a> in Region 2. The latter was titled <em>Lost: The Complete First Series</em>. As has become standard for Region 2, the series was first released split into two parts: the first twelve episodes of series 1 were available as a widescreen four-disc Region 2 DVD box set on <a href="October_31" title="wikilink">October 31</a>, <a href="2005" class="uri" title="wikilink">2005</a>, while the remaining thirteen episodes of series 1 were released on <a href="January_16" title="wikilink">January 16</a>, <a href="2006" class="uri" title="wikilink">2006</a>.

<p>Again, the series was initially delivered in two sets for Region 2: the first twelve episodes were released as a widescreen four-disc DVD box set on <a href="July_17" title="wikilink">July 17</a>, <a href="2006" class="uri" title="wikilink">2006</a>.

<h2 id="cast-and-characters">Cast and characters</h2>

<p>The opening season featured sixteen regular speaking roles, making it the second largest cast in American primetime television behind <em>Desperate Housewives</em>. While a large cast makes <em>Lost</em> more expensive to produce, the show's writers benefit from more flexibility in story decisions. According to series executive producer Bryan Burk, &quot;You can have more interactions between characters and create more diverse characters, more back stories, more love triangles.&quot;<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a></p>
<p>The initial season had fourteen major roles getting star <a href="billing_(film)" title="wikilink">billing</a>. <a href="Naveen_Andrews" title="wikilink">Naveen Andrews</a> portrayed former Iraqi Republican guard <a href="Sayid_Jarrah" title="wikilink">Sayid Jarrah</a>. <a href="Emilie_de_Ravin" title="wikilink">Emilie de Ravin</a> played the pregnant Australian <a href="Claire_Littleton" title="wikilink">Claire Littleton</a>. <a href="Matthew_Fox_(actor)" title="wikilink">Matthew Fox</a> acted as the troubled surgeon and lead role <a href="Jack_Shephard" title="wikilink">Jack Shephard</a>. <a href="Jorge_Garcia" title="wikilink">Jorge Garcia</a> portrayed <a href="Hugo_&quot;Hurley&quot;_Reyes" title="wikilink">Hugo &quot;Hurley&quot; Reyes</a>, an unlucky lotto winner. <a href="Maggie_Grace" title="wikilink">Maggie Grace</a> played <a href="Shannon_Rutherford" title="wikilink">Shannon Rutherford</a>, a former dance teacher. <a href="Josh_Holloway" title="wikilink">Josh Holloway</a> acted as con man <a href="James_&quot;Sawyer&quot;_Ford" title="wikilink">James &quot;Sawyer&quot; Ford</a>. <a href="Yunjin_Kim" title="wikilink">Yunjin Kim</a> played <a href="Sun-Hwa_Kwon" title="wikilink">Sun-Hwa Kwon</a>, the daughter of a powerful Korean businessman, with <a href="Daniel_Dae_Kim" title="wikilink">Daniel Dae Kim</a> as her husband <a href="Jin-Soo_Kwon" title="wikilink">Jin-Soo Kwon</a>. <a href="Evangeline_Lilly" title="wikilink">Evangeline Lilly</a> portrayed fugitive <a href="Kate_Austen" title="wikilink">Kate Austen</a>. <a href="Dominic_Monaghan" title="wikilink">Dominic Monaghan</a> acted as an ex-rock star drug addict <a href="Charlie_Pace" title="wikilink">Charlie Pace</a>. <a href="Terry_O&#39;Quinn" title="wikilink">Terry O'Quinn</a> played the mysterious <a href="John_Locke_(Lost)" title="wikilink">John Locke</a>. <a href="Harold_Perrineau" title="wikilink">Harold Perrineau</a> portrayed construction worker <a href="Michael_Dawson_(Lost)" title="wikilink">Michael Dawson</a>, while child star <a href="Malcolm_David_Kelley" title="wikilink">Malcolm David Kelley</a> acted as his young son, <a href="Walt_Lloyd" title="wikilink">Walt Lloyd</a>. <a href="Ian_Somerhalder" title="wikilink">Ian Somerhalder</a> played <a href="Boone_Carlyle" title="wikilink">Boone Carlyle</a>, chief operating officer of his mother's wedding business and step brother of Shannon.  <img src="Seasonthree2.jpg" title="fig:Most of the principal characters of the mid-third season of Lost; from left, Ben, Kate, Sawyer, Claire, Charlie, Jack, Sayid, Locke, Sun, Desmond, Hurley, Jin, Juliet (Nikki and Paulo not pictured).|thumb|300px" alt="Most of the principal characters of the mid-third season of Lost; from left, Ben, Kate, Sawyer, Claire, Charlie, Jack, Sayid, Locke, Sun, Desmond, Hurley, Jin, Juliet (Nikki and Paulo not pictured).|thumb|300px" /> During the first two seasons, some characters were written out to make room for new characters with new stories.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a><a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> Boone Carlyle was the first major character to be written out in season one. Malcolm David Kelley became a guest star after the events of the first season's finale, making rare appearances throughout season two.

<h3 id="casting">Casting</h3>

<p>Many of the first season roles were a result of the executive producers' liking of various actors. The main character Jack was originally to die in the pilot, and was hoped to be played by <a href="Michael_Keaton" title="wikilink">Michael Keaton</a>, however ABC executives were adamant that Jack live. Before it was decided that Jack would live, Kate was to emerge as the leader of the survivors; she was originally conceived to be more like the character of Rose. Dominic Monaghan auditioned for the role of Sawyer, who at the time was supposed to be a suit-wearing city con man. The producers enjoyed Monaghan's performance and changed the character of Charlie to fit him. Jorge Garcia also auditioned for Sawyer, and the part of Hurley was written for him. When Josh Holloway auditioned for Sawyer, the producers liked the edge he brought to the character (he reportedly kicked a chair when he got angry in the audition) so they changed Sawyer to fit Holloway's acting. Yunjin Kim auditioned for Kate, but the producers wrote the character of Sun for her and the character of Jin, portrayed by Daniel Dae Kim, to be her husband. Naveen Andrews, who plays Sayid, was also not in the original script. Locke and Michael were written with their actors in mind. Emilie de Ravin who plays Claire was originally supposed to be a recurring role. In the second season, Michael Emerson was contracted to play Ben (&quot;Henry Gale&quot;) for three episodes. His role was extended because of his acting skills to eight episodes, and eventually for the whole of season three.</p>

<h2 id="mythology">Mythology</h2>

<p>In parallel to its character development, episodes of <em>Lost</em> include a number of mysterious elements which have been ascribed to <a href="science_fiction" title="wikilink">science fiction</a> or <a href="supernatural" class="uri" title="wikilink">supernatural</a> phenomena. The creators of the series refer to these elements as comprising the <a href="mythology" class="uri" title="wikilink">mythology</a> of the series, and they form the basis of fan speculation.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a></p>
<p>Among the show's mythological elements is a &quot;monster&quot; which appears to roam the island; a mysterious group of inhabitants whom the survivors refer to as &quot;The Others&quot;; an organization called the &quot;<a href="DHARMA" class="uri" title="wikilink">DHARMA</a> Initiative&quot; which has placed several <a href="DHARMA_Initiative_stations" title="wikilink">research stations</a> on the island; a sequence of numbers which have made frequent appearances in the lives of the characters, in both the past and present; and personal connections between the characters, of which they are often unaware.</p>
<h2 id="thematic-motifs">Thematic motifs</h2>

<p>There are several recurring thematic <a href="Motif_(literature)" title="wikilink">motifs</a> on <em>Lost</em>, which generally have no direct impact on the story itself, but expand the show's literary and philosophical <a href="subtext" class="uri" title="wikilink">subtext</a>. These elements include frequent appearances of the colors <a href="Black_and_white_(colours)" title="wikilink">black and white</a>, which reflect the <a href="dualism" class="uri" title="wikilink">dualism</a> within characters and situations; <a href="eye" title="wikilink">eyes</a>, which often appear in close-up at the start of episodes; <a href="dysfunctional_family" title="wikilink">dysfunctional family</a> situations, as portrayed in the lives of nearly all the main characters; references to numerous works of <a href="literature" class="uri" title="wikilink">literature</a>, including mentions and discussions of particular novels. There are also many allusions to <a href="philosophy" class="uri" title="wikilink">philosophy</a>, demonstrated most clearly in the distinct naming of certain characters after famous historical thinkers, such as <a href="John_Locke" title="wikilink">John Locke</a>, <a href="Jean-Jacques_Rousseau" title="wikilink">Jean-Jacques Rousseau</a> and <a href="David_Hume" title="wikilink">David Hume</a>.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="discredited-theories">Discredited theories</h2>
<p>At the heart of the series is a complex and cryptic storyline which spawns numerous unresolved questions. <a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> Encouraged by <em>Lost's</em> writers and stars, who often interact with fans online, viewers and TV critics alike have taken to widespread theorization in an attempt to unravel the mysteries. Theories mainly concern the nature of the island, the origins of the &quot;monster&quot; and the &quot;Others&quot;, the meaning of the numbers, and the reasons for both the crash and the survival of some passengers.</p>
<p>Several of the more common fan theories have been discussed and rejected by the show's creators, the most common being that the survivors of Oceanic Flight 815 are dead or in <a href="purgatory" class="uri" title="wikilink">purgatory</a>. This was specifically denied by J.J. Abrams and was also proven to be wrong by the second season's <a href="Episodes_of_Lost_(season_2)#Live_Together,_Die_Alone" title="wikilink">finale</a>.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> The makers of the show have also discredited the theory that the survivors will experience, or have experienced, <a href="time_travel" title="wikilink">time travel</a>, which was dismissed by <a href="Damon_Lindelof" title="wikilink">Damon Lindelof</a>.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> Likewise, speculation that <a href="spaceships" class="uri" title="wikilink">spaceships</a> or <a href="Extraterrestrial_life_in_popular_culture" title="wikilink">aliens</a> influence the events on the island, or that everything seen is a fictional reality taking place in someone's mind, has also been rejected by Lindelof.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a><a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a></p>
<p>Carlton Cuse dismissed the theory that the island is a <a href="reality_TV" title="wikilink">reality TV</a> show and the castaways unwitting housemates<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a> and Damon Lindelof, many times, discredited the theory that the &quot;monster&quot; is a <a href="nanobot" class="uri" title="wikilink">nanobot</a> cloud similar to the one featured in <a href="Michael_Crichton" title="wikilink">Michael Crichton</a>'s novel <em><a href="Prey_(novel)" title="wikilink">Prey</a></em>.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a><a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a> </p>

<p><strong>USA TV Ratings</strong></p>
<p>The pilot episode garnered 18.6 million viewers, easily winning its 9/8central timeslot, and giving ABC its strongest <a href="Nielsen_ratings" title="wikilink">ratings</a> since 2000 when <em><a href="Who_Wants_to_Be_a_Millionaire?_(US_game_show)" title="wikilink">Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?</a></em> initially aired &lt;U+2014&gt; beaten only the following month by the premiere of <em><a href="Desperate_Housewives" title="wikilink">Desperate Housewives</a></em>.

<p><strong>World TV Ratings</strong></p>

<p>As with most <a href="cult_television" title="wikilink">cult television</a> shows, <em>Lost</em> has generated a dedicated and thriving international <a href="fan_(aficionado)" title="wikilink">fan</a> community. <em>Lost</em> fans, sometimes dubbed <em>Lostaways</em><a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a> or <em>Losties</em>,<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a> have gathered at <a href="Comic-Con_International" title="wikilink">Comic-Con International</a> and conventions organized by ABC,<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a><a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a> but have also been active in developing a large number of fan websites, including <a href="Lostpedia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Lostpedia</a>, and forums dedicated to the program and its related incarnations.<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a><a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a><a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a><a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a> Because of the show's elaborate mythology, its fansites have focused on speculation and theorizing about the island's mysteries, as well as on more typical fan activities such as producing <a href="fan_fiction" title="wikilink">fan fiction</a> and videos, compiling episode transcripts, <a href="shipping_(fandom)" title="wikilink">shipping</a> characters, and collecting memorabilia.</p>
<p>Anticipating fan interest and trying to keep its audience engrossed, ABC embarked on various cross-media endeavors, often using new media.
