<p><img src="PRSpaceOct-89.jpg" title="fig:Puerto Rico" alt="Puerto Rico" width="150" /> The <strong><a href="military_history" title="wikilink">military history</a></strong> of <strong><a href="Puerto_Rico" title="wikilink">Puerto Rico</a></strong> dates back to the 16th century, when <a href="Spanish_people" title="wikilink">Spanish</a> <a href="conquistador" title="wikilink">conquistadores</a> battled against the native <a href="Taino" title="wikilink">Tainos</a>. The island was ruled by the <a href="Spanish_Empire" title="wikilink">Spanish Empire</a> for four centuries, during which the Puerto Ricans defended themselves against invasions from the <a href="British_Empire" title="wikilink">British</a>, <a href="French_colonization_of_the_Americas" title="wikilink">French</a>, and <a href="Dutch_colonization_of_the_Americas" title="wikilink">Dutch</a>. The island was invaded by the <a href="United_States" title="wikilink">United States</a> during the <a href="Spanish-American_War" title="wikilink">Spanish-American War</a>, and Spain officially ceded it under the terms of the <a href="Treaty_of_Paris_(1898)" title="wikilink">1898 Treaty of Paris</a> which ended the war. It is now a <a href="United_States_territory" title="wikilink">United States territory</a> and Puerto Ricans, as citizens of the United States, have participated in every major conflict involving the United States from <a href="World_War_I" title="wikilink">World War I</a> onward. The following is a history of the military events in which Puerto Ricans have participated.</p>
<h2 id="conflict-with-the-tainos">Conflict with the Tainos</h2>
<p>After the success of <a href="Christopher_Columbus" title="wikilink">Christopher Columbus's</a> first voyage to the <a href="New_World" title="wikilink">New World</a>, he followed up soon afterwards with a second voyage. Unlike the first, this voyage was colonial rather than exploratory. On November 19, 1493, Columbus discovered the island of Puerto Rico. It was inhabited by native islanders known as Tainos, who belonged to the <a href="Arawak" class="uri" title="wikilink">Arawak</a> group of <a href="Indigenous_peoples_of_the_Americas" title="wikilink">indigenous peoples</a>. The Tainos called the island &quot;Boriken.&quot; Columbus named the island &quot;<a href="San_Juan_Bautista" title="wikilink">San Juan Bautista</a>&quot; in honor of <a href="John_the_Baptist" title="wikilink">Saint John the Baptist</a>. Eventually it took the name <a href="Puerto_Rico" title="wikilink">Puerto Rico</a> (&quot;Rich Port&quot;), and the capital city became <a href="San_Juan,_Puerto_Rico" title="wikilink">San Juan</a>. The <a href="conquistador" class="uri" title="wikilink">conquistador</a> <a href="Juan_Ponce_de_Le&lt;U+00F3&gt;n" title="wikilink">Juan Ponce de Le&lt;U+00F3&gt;n</a> was among the many men who accompanied Columbus on this trip.</p>
<p><img src="Agueybana.JPG" title="fig:Cacique Ag&lt;U+00FC&gt;eyban&lt;U+00E1&gt; greeting Juan Ponce de Leon" alt="Cacique Ag&lt;U+00FC&gt;eyban&lt;U+00E1&gt; greeting Juan Ponce de Leon" width="250" /> When Ponce de Le&lt;U+00F3&gt;n arrived in Puerto Rico, he was well received by the cacique <a href="Ag&lt;U+00FC&gt;eyban&lt;U+00E1&gt;" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ag&lt;U+00FC&gt;eyban&lt;U+00E1&gt;</a>, leader of the Taino tribes in the island. The first colonists, besides the conquistadors, were farmers and miners in search of <a href="gold_mining" title="wikilink">gold</a>. Ponce de Le&lt;U+00F3&gt;n became the first governor of Puerto Rico, by appointment of the Spanish Crown. In 1508, he founded the first settlement in Puerto Rico, located between the modern-day cities of <a href="Bayam&lt;U+00F3&gt;n,_Puerto_Rico" title="wikilink">Bayam&lt;U+00F3&gt;n</a> and San Juan, and named it <a href="Caparra" class="uri" title="wikilink">Caparra</a>. Shortly after being named Governor, Ponce de Le&lt;U+00F3&gt;n and the other conquistadors forced the Tainos to work in the mines and to construct fortifications. Many Tainos died as a result of this cruel treatment. In 1510, Ag&lt;U+00FC&gt;eyban&lt;U+00E1&gt; II (the Cacique's brother) and a group of Tainos led a Spaniard named <a href="Diego_Salcedo_(soldier)" title="wikilink">Diego Salcedo</a> to a river and drowned him, therefore proving to his people that the white men were not gods as they had thought. Upon realizing this, Ag&lt;U+00FC&gt;eyban&lt;U+00E1&gt; led the first rebellion in the island, against the better armed Spanish forces. The colonists formed a citizens' <a href="militia" class="uri" title="wikilink">militia</a> to defend themselves against the attacks. Ag&lt;U+00FC&gt;eyban&lt;U+00E1&gt; was shot and killed, and the event which was the first military action in Puerto Rico came to an end.</p>
<h2 id="europeans-fight-over-puerto-rico">Europeans fight over Puerto Rico</h2>
<p><img src="CastilloElNorro.jpg" title="fig:El Morro" alt="El Morro" /> Puerto Rico was considered the &quot;Key to the Antilles&quot; by the Spanish, as its location was important as a way station and port for Spanish vessels. In <a href="1540" class="uri" title="wikilink">1540</a>, the Spanish settlers began the construction of the fort <a href="Fort_San_Felipe_del_Morro" title="wikilink">El Morro</a> (&quot;the promontory&quot;) with revenue from <a href="Mexico" title="wikilink">Mexican</a> mines. The initial phase of the construction was completed in <a href="1589" class="uri" title="wikilink">1589</a>. El Morro was the island's main military fortification in San Juan and was guarded by professional soldiers. Puerto Rico's only defense was a handful of soldiers and the local militia, made up of volunteers. These units were able to defend themselves against many pirate attacks. On <a href="October_11" title="wikilink">October 11</a>, <a href="1528" class="uri" title="wikilink">1528</a>, the French, in an attempt to capture the island, sacked and burned the settlement of <a href="San_Germ&lt;U+00E1&gt;n,_Puerto_Rico" title="wikilink">San Germ&lt;U+00E1&gt;n</a>. They also destroyed many of the island's first settlements—including Gu&lt;U+00E1&gt;nica, Sotomayor, Daguao and Loiza—before the local militia forced them to retreat. The only settlement that remained was San Juan. </p>

<p><img src="Juan_Ponce_de_Leon_II.JPG" title="fig:Juan Ponce de Leon II" alt="Juan Ponce de Leon II" width="150" /> In 1585, war broke out between England and Spain. Fighting was not limited to Europe, but extended to their territories in the Americas. That same year, <a href="Juan_Ponce_de_Le&lt;U+00F3&gt;n_II" title="wikilink">Juan Ponce de Le&lt;U+00F3&gt;n II</a>, born in San Juan and grandson of Juan Ponce de Le&lt;U+00F3&gt;n, organized a military expedition in the island and set out to retake the islands of <a href="Trinidad" class="uri" title="wikilink">Trinidad</a> and <a href="Tobago" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tobago</a>, and other islands in the area, from the British. He failed after an intense battle and lost his son in the attempt. Ponce de Le&lt;U+00F3&gt;n II, who had been the first native-born Puerto Rican to assume temporary governorship of the island, retired soon thereafter and led a religious life.</p>
<p>In 1588, <a href="Francis_Drake" title="wikilink">Sir Francis Drake</a> was the <a href="vice-admiral" class="uri" title="wikilink">vice-admiral</a> in command of the <a href="Royal_Navy" title="wikilink">Royal Navy</a> which overcame the <a href="Spanish_Armada" title="wikilink">Spanish Armada</a> that was attempting to invade England. On November 22, 1595, Drake and <a href="John_Hawkins" title="wikilink">Sir John Hawkins</a> invaded the island with 26 vessels. Spanish gunmen from El Morro shot a cannonball through the cabin of Drake's flagship. Unable to take the island, Drake set San Juan on fire; in 1596, Drake died of <a href="dysentery" class="uri" title="wikilink">dysentery</a> after a second defeat while again attacking San Juan. On June 15, 1598, the British fleet, led by George Clifford, landed in Santurce and held the island for several months. He was forced to abandon the island upon an outbreak of bacillary dysentery among his troops. In 1599, 400 additional soldiers and 46 cannons were sent to the island along with a new governor, Alonso de Mercado, to rebuild the city. </p>
<p><img src="Antonio_de_los_Reyes_Correa.JPG" title="fig:Captain Antonio de los Reyes Correa" alt="Captain Antonio de los Reyes Correa" width="150" /> The British continued their attacks against the Spanish colonies in the caribbean and were able to take minor islands, including the island of Vieques, which is situated to the east of Puerto Rico. On August 5, 1702, the city of Arecibo was invaded by the British. Only 30 militia members, armed with spears and <a href="machete" title="wikilink">machetes</a> and under the command of Captain <a href="Antonio_de_los_Reyes_Correa" title="wikilink">Antonio de los Reyes Correa</a>, defended the city from the British, who were armed with <a href="musket" title="wikilink">muskets</a> and <a href="sword" title="wikilink">swords</a>. At the end of the battle, there were 22 British dead on land and eight at sea. The British left in defeat, and the city of Arecibo was saved. Reyes Correa was declared a <a href="national_hero" title="wikilink">national hero</a> and was awarded the <a href="Medalla_de_Oro_de_la_Real_Efigie" title="wikilink">Medalla de Oro de la Real Efigie</a> (&quot;Gold Medal of the Royal Image&quot;) by <a href="Philip_V_of_Spain" title="wikilink">King Philip V</a>, who also gave him the title of &quot;Captain of Infantry.&quot; The Regimiento Fijo de Puerto Rico was organized in 1741. The Fijo, as it was known, came about because the Puerto Rican criollos had for some time been petitioning the Spanish Crown to allow Puerto Ricans to serve in the regular Spanish army. Up to that time criollos were not allowed to serve as regular, full-time soldiers. The Fijo not only served in the defense of Puerto Rico but in Spain's overseas possessions as well. It covered itself with glory in battles in Santo Domingo, other islands in the Caribbean and in South America, most notably in Venezuela. However, Puerto Rican complaints that the Fijo was being used to suppress the revolution there caused the Crown to bring the Fijo home and in 1815, mustered it out of service.</p>
<p>In 1765, the Spanish Crown sent Field Marshall <a href="Alejandro_O&#39;Reilly" title="wikilink">Alejandro O'Reilly</a> to Puerto Rico to form an organized militia. O'Reilly, known as the &quot;father of the Puerto Rican militia,&quot; took it upon himself to instill a sense of military discipline in the local troops. The training which he oversaw was to bring fame and glory to the militia in future military engagements. He nicknamed the civilian militia the &quot;Disciplined Militia.&quot; O'Reilly was appointed governor of colonial Louisiana in 1769 where he became known as &quot;Bloody O'Reilly&quot;.</p>
<p><img src="Bernardo_de_Galvez.jpg" title="fig:General Bernardo de G&lt;U+00E1&gt;lvez" alt="General Bernardo de G&lt;U+00E1&gt;lvez" width="150" /> During the <a href="American_Revolutionary_War" title="wikilink">American Revolutionary War</a>, Spain lent the rebelling colonists the use of its ports in Puerto Rico, through which they received financial aid and arms for their cause. Puerto Rican volunteers fought the British, alongside the <a href="Continental_Army" title="wikilink">Continental Army</a>, in the Battle of Massachusetts in 1775, under the command of Captain General Torre. An incident occurred in the coast of Mayag&lt;U+00FC&gt;ez, in 1777, between two <a href="Continental_Navy" title="wikilink">Continental Navy</a> ships, the <em>Eudawook</em> and the <em>Henry</em>, and a Royal Navy warship, the <a href="HMS_Glasgow" title="wikilink">HMS <em>Glasgow</em></a>. Both American ships were chased by the larger and more powerful <em>Glasgow</em>. The American ships were close to the coast of Mayag&lt;U+00FC&gt;ez and members of the Puerto Rican militia of that town, realizing that something was wrong, signaled for the ships to dock at the towns Bay. After the ships docked, the crews of both ships got off and some Mayag&lt;U+00FC&gt;ezanos boarded and raised the Spanish flag on both ships. The commander of the <em>Glasgow</em> became aware of the situation and asked the islands governor, Jose Dufresne to turn over the ships. Governor Dufresne refused and ordered the English warship out of the Puerto Rican dock. The governor of <a href="Louisiana" class="uri" title="wikilink">Louisiana</a>, <a href="Bernardo_de_G&lt;U+00E1&gt;lvez" title="wikilink">Bernardo de G&lt;U+00E1&gt;lvez</a> (1746-1786), was named general of the Spanish colonial army in North America. In 1779, Galvez and his troops, composed of Puerto Ricans and other Hispanic groups, distracted the British from the revolution by capturing the cities of <a href="Baton_Rouge,_Louisiana" title="wikilink">Baton Rouge</a>, <a href="Mobile,_Alabama" title="wikilink">Mobile</a>, <a href="Pensacola,_Florida" title="wikilink">Pensacola</a> and <a href="St._Louis,_Missouri" title="wikilink">St. Louis</a>. Galvez and his troops also provided the Continental Army with guns, cloth, gunpowder and medicine shipped from <a href="Cuba" class="uri" title="wikilink">Cuba</a> up the <a href="Mississippi_River" title="wikilink">Mississippi River</a>.</p>
<p>On February 17, 1797, the appointed governor of Puerto Rico, Ram&lt;U+00F3&gt;n de Castro, who was also a <a href="brigadier_general" title="wikilink">brigadier general</a> in the Spanish Army, received the news that England had invaded the Caribbean island of Trinidad. Governor Ram&lt;U+00F3&gt;n de Castro believed that Puerto Rico would be the next objective of the British and that they would once again attempt to invade the island. He decided to put the militia on alert and to prepare the island's forts against any military action. On <a href="April_17" title="wikilink">April 17</a>, 1797, British ships under the command of Sir <a href="Ralph_Abercromby" title="wikilink">Ralph Abercromby</a>, approached the coastal town of <a href="Lo&lt;U+00ED&gt;za,_Puerto_Rico" title="wikilink">Lo&lt;U+00ED&gt;za</a>, to the east of San Juan. On April 18, British soldiers and German mercenaries (&quot;<a href="Hessian" title="wikilink">Hessians</a>&quot;) landed on Lo&lt;U+00ED&gt;za's beach. Under the command of Brigadier Ram&lt;U+00F3&gt;n de Castro, British ships were attacked with artillery and mortar fire from both El Morro and the San Ger&lt;U+00F3&gt;nimo fortresses. The British twice tried to take the Mart&lt;U+00ED&gt;n Pe&lt;U+00F1&gt;a Bridge, which would lead to San Juan, but after fiercely fighting the Spanish forces and local militia they were defeated in both of their attempts. The invasion had failed because a total of 16,000 Puerto Rican volunteers and Spanish troops fought back and defended the island. The British also attacked <a href="Aguadilla,_Puerto_Rico" title="wikilink">Aguadilla</a> and Punta Salinas, but they were defeated, and the British troops that had landed on the island were taken prisoner. The British retreated on <a href="November_12" title="wikilink">November 12</a>, <a href="1798" class="uri" title="wikilink">1798</a> and the Puerto Rican militia were awarded many high honors from the Spanish crown. </p>
<p><img src="Miguel_Enriquez.jpg" title="fig:Capt. Miguel Enriquez" alt="Capt. Miguel Enriquez" width="130" /> Spain and Britain were in a constant power struggle in the New World. Puerto Rican <a href="privateer" title="wikilink">privateering</a> of British ships was encouraged by the Spanish Crown. Captain <a href="Miguel_Enr&lt;U+00ED&gt;quez" title="wikilink">Miguel Enr&lt;U+00ED&gt;quez</a> and <a href="Roberto_Cofresi" title="wikilink">Roberto Cofresi</a> were two of the most famous pirates. Enr&lt;U+00ED&gt;quez was a <a href="shoemaking" title="wikilink">shoemaker</a> by occupation. In the later years of the 18th century, Enr&lt;U+00ED&gt;quez decided to try his luck as a pirate. He showed great valor in intercepting English merchant ships and other ships dedicated to <a href="List_of_items_for_which_possession_is_restricted" title="wikilink">contraband</a> that were infesting the seas of Puerto Rico and the <a href="Atlantic_Ocean" title="wikilink">Atlantic Ocean</a> in general. In <a href="1811" class="uri" title="wikilink">1811</a>, Miguel Enr&lt;U+00ED&gt;quez participated in the expeditionary force, under the command of Juan Rosello, which fought and defeated the British in the island of Vieques. Miguel Enr&lt;U+00ED&gt;quez was received as a national hero when he returned the island of Vieques back to the Spanish Empire and to the governorship of Puerto Rico. In recognition of his services, the Spanish Crown awarded Miguel Enr&lt;U+00ED&gt;quez with the Medalla de Oro de la Real Efigie (The Gold Medal of the Royal Image), named him &quot;Captain of the Seas and Land&quot; and gave him a <a href="letter_of_marque_and_reprisal" title="wikilink">letter of marque and reprisal</a>.</p>
<p>In the case of Captain Roberto Cofresi, the Spanish government received many complaints from the nations whose ships he attacked. The Spanish government, which normally encouraged piracy against other nations, was pressured and felt obliged to pursue and capture the famous pirate. Cofresi and his men attacked eight ships, amongst them an American ship. In <a href="1824" class="uri" title="wikilink">1824</a>, Captain John Slout of the <a href="United_States" title="wikilink">U.S.</a> Naval Forces and his schooner &quot;Grampus&quot; engaged Cofresi in a fierce battle. The pirate Cofresi was captured along with eleven of his crew members and was turned over to the Spanish Government. He was sent to jail in <a href="El_Morro" title="wikilink">El Castillo del Morro</a> in <a href="San_Juan,_Puerto_Rico" title="wikilink">San Juan</a>. Cofresi was judged by a Spanish Council of War, found guilty and executed by firing squad, on <a href="March_29" title="wikilink">March 29</a> <a href="1825" class="uri" title="wikilink">1825</a>.</p>
<p>The British were not the only enemies that Spain faced in the Caribbean during this period. France had threatened to invade the Spanish Colony of <a href="Santo_Domingo" title="wikilink">Santo Domingo</a>. In <a href="1808" class="uri" title="wikilink">1808</a> the Spanish Crown sent their Navy under the command of Puerto Rican Admiral <a href="Ramon_Power_y_Giralt" title="wikilink">Ramon Power y Giralt</a> to prevent the invasion of Santo Domingo by the <a href="France" title="wikilink">French</a> by enforcing a <a href="blockade" class="uri" title="wikilink">blockade</a>. He was successful and was proclaimed a hero by the Spanish Government.</p>
<h3 id="the-dutch">The Dutch</h3>
<p>The Netherlands was a world military and commercial power by 1625, competing in the Caribbean with the British. The Dutch wanted to establish a military stronghold in the area, and dispatched Captain Balduino Enrico (Boudewijn Hendricksz) with the task of capturing Puerto Rico. On <a href="September_24" title="wikilink">September 24</a>, <a href="1625" class="uri" title="wikilink">1625</a>, Enrico arrived at the coast of San Juan with 17 ships and 2,000 men. The governor of Puerto Rico, Juan de Haros, was an experienced military man, and, expecting an attack in the section known as Boqueron, had that area fortified. However, the Dutch took another route and landed in La Puntilla. <img src="Fortaleza.jpg" title="fig:La Fortaleza" alt="La Fortaleza" /> De Haro realized that an invasion was inevitable and ordered 300 men stationed at El Morro Castle and the city of San Juan evacuated. He also had former governor Juan de Vargas organize an armed resistance in the interior of the island. On <a href="September_25" title="wikilink">September 25</a> Enrico attacked San Juan, besieging El Morro Castle and <a href="La_Fortaleza" title="wikilink">La Fortaleza</a> (the Governor's Mansion). He invaded the capital city and set up his headquarters in La Fortaleza. The Dutch were counterattacked by the civilian militia on land and by the cannons of the Spanish troops in El Morro Castle. The land battle left 60 Dutch soldiers dead and Enrico wounded. The Dutch ships at sea were boarded by Puerto Ricans who defeated those aboard. After a long battle, the Spanish soldiers and volunteers of the city's militia were able to defend the city from the attack and save the island from an invasion. On <a href="October_21" title="wikilink">October 21</a>, Enrico set La Fortaleza and the city ablaze upon his retreat. He then tried to invade the island by attacking the town of <a href="Aguada,_Puerto_Rico" title="wikilink">Aguada</a>. He was again defeated by the local militia and abandoned the idea of invading Puerto Rico.</p>
<h2 id="revolt-against-spain">Revolt against Spain</h2>
<h3 id="south-america">South America</h3>
<p><img src="Antonio_Valero_Bernabe.gif" title="fig:Gen. Antonio Valero de Bernabe" alt="Gen. Antonio Valero de Bernabe" /> The Spanish colonies began to revolt against Spanish rule during this period. Brigadier General <a href="Antonio_Valero_de_Bernabe" title="wikilink">Antonio Valero de Bernabe</a> was a Puerto Rican military leader who became known in Latin America as the &quot;Liberator from Puerto Rico&quot;. Valero was a recent graduate of the Spanish Military Academy when <a href="Napoleon_I_of_France" title="wikilink">Napoleon Bonaparte</a> convinced <a href="Charles_IV_of_Spain" title="wikilink">King Charles IV of Spain</a> to permit him to pass through Spanish soil with the sole purpose of attacking <a href="Portugal" class="uri" title="wikilink">Portugal</a>. When Napoleon refused to leave, the Spanish government declared war. Valero joined the Spanish Army and helped defeat Napoleon's army at the <a href="Battle_of_Zaragoza" title="wikilink">Battle of Zaragoza</a>. Valero became a hero; he was awarded many decorations and was promoted to the rank of colonel.</p>
<p>When <a href="Ferdinand_VII_of_Spain" title="wikilink">Ferdinand VII</a> assumed the throne of Spain in 1813, Valero became critical of the new king's policies towards the Spanish colonies in Latin America. He developed a keen hatred of the monarchy, resigned his commission in the army, and headed for <a href="Mexico" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mexico</a>. There he joined the insurgent army headed by <a href="Agust&lt;U+00ED&gt;n_de_Iturbide" title="wikilink">Agust&lt;U+00ED&gt;n de Iturbide</a>, in which Valero was named chief of staff. He fought for <a href="Mexican_War_of_Independence" title="wikilink">Mexico's independence</a> from Spain, and was victorious. After the Mexican victory, Iturbide proclaimed himself Emperor of Mexico. Since Valero had developed anti-monarchist feelings following his experiences in Spain, he then revolted against Iturbide. Things didn't go well, and he tried to escape, but was captured by a Spanish pirate, who turned him over to the Spanish authorities in <a href="Cuba" class="uri" title="wikilink">Cuba</a>, where he was imprisoned. Valero escaped with the help of a group of men that were pro-Bol&lt;U+00ED&gt;var. Upon learning of Bol&lt;U+00ED&gt;var's dream of creating a unified Latin America, including Puerto Rico and Cuba, Valero decided to join him. Valero stopped in <a href="Saint_Thomas,_United_States_Virgin_Islands" title="wikilink">St. Thomas</a>, where he established contacts with the Puerto Rican independence movement. He then traveled to <a href="Venezuela" class="uri" title="wikilink">Venezuela</a>, were he was met by General Santander.</p>
<p>He next joined <a href="Sim&lt;U+00F3&gt;n_Bol&lt;U+00ED&gt;var" title="wikilink">Sim&lt;U+00F3&gt;n Bol&lt;U+00ED&gt;var</a>, and fought alongside &quot;The Liberator&quot; against Spain, gaining his confidence and admiration. Bernabe was named Military Chief of the Department of Panama, Governor of Puerto Cabello, Chief of Staff of Colombia, Minister of War and Maritime of Venezuela, and in <a href="1849" class="uri" title="wikilink">1849</a> was promoted to the rank of Brigadier General.</p>
<h3 id="puerto-rico">Puerto Rico</h3>
<p><img src="San_cristobal_cannon_s.jpg" title="fig:Fort San Cristobal" alt="Fort San Cristobal" /> On <a href="April_13" title="wikilink">April 13</a>, <a href="1855" class="uri" title="wikilink">1855</a>, a <a href="mutiny" class="uri" title="wikilink">mutiny</a> broke out among the artillerymen in <a href="Fort_San_Crist&lt;U+00F3&gt;bal" title="wikilink">Fort San Crist&lt;U+00F3&gt;bal</a>. They were protesting against an extended two years of military service imposed by the island's Spanish governor, Garcia Cambia. The mutineers pointed their cannons towards San Juan, creating a state of panic among the population. Upon their surrender, the governor had the eight men arrested and <a href="Capital_punishment" title="wikilink">sentenced to death</a> by <a href="firing_squad" title="wikilink">firing squad</a>.</p>
<p>Many Spanish colonies had gained their independence by the mid-<a href="1850s" class="uri" title="wikilink">1850s</a>. In Puerto Rico there were two groups: the loyalists, who were loyal to Spain, and the <em>independentistas</em>, who advocated independence. In <a href="1866" class="uri" title="wikilink">1866</a>, Dr. <a href="Ram&lt;U+00F3&gt;n_Emeterio_Betances" title="wikilink">Ram&lt;U+00F3&gt;n Emeterio Betances</a>, <a href="Segundo_Ruiz_Belvis" title="wikilink">Segundo Ruiz Belvis</a>, and other independence advocates met in <a href="New_York_City" title="wikilink">New York City</a> where they formed the Revolutionary Committee of Puerto Rico. An outcome from this venture was the plan of sending an armed expedition from the <a href="Dominican_Republic" title="wikilink">Dominican Republic</a> to invade the island. Several revolutionary cells were formed in the western towns and cities of Puerto Rico. Two of the most important cells were at <a href="Mayag&lt;U+00FC&gt;ez,_Puerto_Rico" title="wikilink">Mayag&lt;U+00FC&gt;ez</a>, led by <a href="Mathias_Brugman" title="wikilink">Mathias Brugman</a> and code named &quot;Capa Prieto&quot; and at Lares, code-named &quot;Centro Bravo&quot; and headed by <a href="Manuel_Rojas" title="wikilink">Manuel Rojas</a>. &quot;Centro Bravo&quot; was the main center of operations and was located in the Rojas plantation of El Triunfo. Manuel Rojas was named &quot;Commander of the Liberation Army&quot; by Betances. <a href="Mariana_Bracetti" title="wikilink">Mariana Bracetti</a> (sister-in-law of Manuel) was named &quot;Leader of the Lares Revolutionary Council.&quot; Upon the request of Betances, Bracetti knitted the revolutionary <a href="Flag_of_Lares" title="wikilink">Flag of Lares</a> (<em>Bandera de Lares</em>).

<p>]]</p>
<p>The Spanish authorities found out about the plot and were able to confiscate Betance's armed ship before it arrived in Puerto Rico. The Mayor of the town of <a href="Camuy,_Puerto_Rico" title="wikilink">Camuy</a>, Manuel Gonzalez (leader of that town's revolutionary cell), was arrested and charged with treason. He learned that the Spanish Army was aware of the independence plot, and escaped to warn Manuel Rojas. Alerted, the revolutionists decided to start the revolution as soon as possible, and set the date for <a href="September_28" title="wikilink">September 28</a>, <a href="1868" class="uri" title="wikilink">1868</a>. Mathias Brugman and his men joined up with Manuel Rojas's men and with about 800 men and women, marched on and took the town of Lares. This was to be known as &quot;el <a href="Grito_de_Lares_(The_Cry_of_Lares)" title="wikilink">Grito de Lares</a>.&quot; The revolutionists entered the town's church and placed Bracetii's revolutionary flag on the High Altar, as a sign that the revolution had begun. They declared Puerto Rico to be the &quot;Republic of Puerto Rico&quot; and named <a href="Francisco_Ramirez_Medina" title="wikilink">Francisco Ramirez</a> its President. Manuel and his poorly armed followers proceeded to march on to the town of <a href="San_Sebasti&lt;U+00E1&gt;n" title="wikilink">San Sebasti&lt;U+00E1&gt;n</a>, armed only with clubs and machetes. The Spanish Army had been forewarned, and awaited with superior fire power. The revolutionists were met with deadly fire. The revolt failed, many revolutionists were killed, and at least 475, including Manuel Rojas and Mariana Bracetii, were imprisoned in the jail of <a href="Arecibo" class="uri" title="wikilink">Arecibo</a> and sentenced to death.</p>
<p>Others fled and went into hiding. Mathias Brugman was hiding in a local farm where he was betrayed by farm hand named Francisco Qui&lt;U+00F1&gt;ones. He was captured and executed on the spot. In <a href="1869" class="uri" title="wikilink">1869</a>, fearing another revolt, the Spanish Crown disbanded the Puerto Rican Militia, which had been composed almost entirely of native-born Puerto Ricans and also the Compa&lt;U+00F1&gt;ia de Artilleros Morenos de Cangrejos, a separate company of black Puerto Ricans. They then organized the Volunteer Institute, composed entirely of Spaniards and their sons.</p>

<p><img src="Gen._Juan_Ruis_Rivera.JPG" title="fig:Gen. Juan Rius Rivera" alt="Gen. Juan Rius Rivera" width="130" /> In <a href="1869" class="uri" title="wikilink">1869</a>, the incoming governor of Puerto Rico, Jose Laureano Sanz, in an effort to ease tensions in the island, dictated a general amnesty and released all who were involved with the Grito de Lares revolt, from prison. Many of these former prisoners joined the Cuban Liberation Army and fought against Spain. Among the many Puerto Ricans who volunteered to fight for Cuba's independence were <a href="Juan_Rius_Rivera" title="wikilink">Juan Rius Rivera</a> and <a href="Francisco_Gonzalo_Marin" title="wikilink">Francisco Gonzalo Marin</a> a.k.a. &quot;Pachin Marin&quot;.</p>
<p>Juan Rius Rivera was released from prison for his participation in the Lares revolt. He joined the Cuban Liberation Army and was given the rank of General. He fought alongside Gen. <a href="Maximo_Gomez" title="wikilink">Maximo Gomez</a> in Cuba's <a href="Ten_Years&#39;_War" title="wikilink">Ten Years' War</a>. He later fought alongside Gen. <a href="Antonio_Maceo" title="wikilink">Antonio Maceo</a> and upon Maceo's death was named Commander-in-Chief of the Cuban Liberation Army. After Cuba gained its independence, Gen. Juan Rius Rivera became an active political figure in the new nation.</p>
<p>Francisco Gonzalo Marin was a renowned poet and journalist in Puerto Rico who joined the Cuban Liberation Army upon learning of the death of his brother Wecenlao, in the battlefields of Cuba. Marin, who was given the rank of Lieutenant, befriended and fought alongside <a href="Jose_Marti" title="wikilink">Jose Marti</a>. In November 1897 Lt. Marin died from the wounds he received in a skirmish against the Spanish Army.</p>
<h2 id="spanish-american-war">Spanish-American War</h2>
<p><img src="AngelRiveroMendez.gif" title="fig:Capt. Angel Rivero Mendez" alt="Capt. Angel Rivero Mendez" width="150" /> The <a href="United_States" title="wikilink">United States</a> declared war on Spain in 1898, following the sinking of the battleship &quot;<a href="USS_Maine_(ACR-1)" title="wikilink">Maine</a>&quot; in Havana harbor, beginning the <a href="Spanish-American_War" title="wikilink">Spanish-American War</a>. One of the United States's principal objectives was to take control of Spanish possessions Puerto Rico and <a href="Cuba" class="uri" title="wikilink">Cuba</a> in the Atlantic, and the <a href="Philippines" class="uri" title="wikilink">Philippines</a> and <a href="Guam" class="uri" title="wikilink">Guam</a> in the Pacific.</p>
<p>On <a href="May_10" title="wikilink">May 10</a>, <a href="1898" class="uri" title="wikilink">1898</a>, Spanish forces, under the command of <a href="Angel_Rivero_Mendez" title="wikilink">Capt. Angel Rivero Mendez</a>, in the fortress of San Cristobal in San Juan exchanged fire with the <a href="USS_Yale_(1889)" title="wikilink">USS <em>Yale</em></a>, and on <a href="May_12" title="wikilink">May 12</a> a fleet of 12 American ships <a href="Battle_of_San_Juan" title="wikilink">bombarded San Juan</a>. On <a href="June_25" title="wikilink">June 25</a>, the <a href="USS_Yosemite_(1892)" title="wikilink">USS <em>Yosemite</em></a> arrived in San Juan and blockaded the port. On <a href="July_25" title="wikilink">July 25</a>, General <a href="Nelson_A._Miles" title="wikilink">Nelson A. Miles</a> entered the southern town of <a href="Gu&lt;U+00E1&gt;nica,_Puerto_Rico" title="wikilink">Gu&lt;U+00E1&gt;nica</a> with 3,300 troops and with the exception of some minor skirmishes, went practically unopposed. One of the most notable skirmishes between Spanish forces and Puerto Rican volunteers with the Americans occurred on <a href="July_26" title="wikilink">July 26</a>. The Spanish forces engaged the 6th Massachusetts in a firefight in what became known as the <a href="Battle_of_Yauco" title="wikilink">Battle of Yauco</a>. Two Spanish soldiers died. The Americans were well received by the Puerto Rican population in general, making the invasion much easier, and the Spanish surrendered without other major incidents. The total casualties of the Puerto Rican campaign were 450 Spanish and Puerto Rican dead or wounded, plus four dead and 39 wounded Americans. <img src="KentuckPortoRico.jpg" title="fig:&quot;1st Kentucky Volunteers&quot; in Puerto Rico, 1898" alt="&quot;1st Kentucky Volunteers&quot; in Puerto Rico, 1898" width="150" /> On <a href="August_8" title="wikilink">August 8</a>, 1898, the Spanish-American War ended, and upon the signing of the Treaty of Paris on <a href="December_10" title="wikilink">December 10</a>, Puerto Rico became a territory of the United States. The Spanish troops had already left by <a href="October_18" title="wikilink">October 18</a>, and the United States named General John R. Brooke as military governor of the island. On <a href="July_1" title="wikilink">July 1</a>, <a href="1899" class="uri" title="wikilink">1899</a>, &quot;The Porto Rico Regiment of Infantry, United States Army&quot; was created, and approved by the <a href="Congress_of_the_United_States" title="wikilink">U.S. Congress</a> on <a href="May_27" title="wikilink">May 27</a>, <a href="1908" class="uri" title="wikilink">1908</a>. The regiment was a segregated, all-volunteer unit made up of 1,969 Puerto Ricans.</p>
<p>In 1897, before the onset of fighting in Puerto Rico, <a href="Juan_Alonso_Zayas" title="wikilink">Juan Alonso Zayas</a>, born in San Juan, was a Second Lieutenant in the Spanish Army when he received orders to head for the Philippines to command of the 2nd Expeditionary Battalion stationed in <a href="Baler,_Aurora" title="wikilink">Baler</a>. He arrived in <a href="Manila" class="uri" title="wikilink">Manila</a>, the capital, in May 1897. There he took a vessel and headed for Baler, on the island of <a href="Luzon" class="uri" title="wikilink">Luzon</a>. The distance between Manila and Baler is 62 miles (100 km); if traveled through the jungles and badly-built roads, the actual distance was 144 miles (230 km). At that time a system of communication between Manila and Baler was almost non-existent. The only way Baler received news from Manila was by way of vessels. The Spanish colonial government was under constant attack from local Filipino groups who wanted independence. Zayas's mission was to fortify Baler against any possible attack. Among his plans for the defense of Baler was to convert the local church of San Luis de Tolosa into a fort.</p>
<p>The independence advocates, under the leadership of Colonel Calixto Vilacorte, were called &quot;<a href="insurgency" title="wikilink">insurgents</a>&quot; (<em>tagalos</em>) by the Spanish crown. On <a href="June_28" title="wikilink">June 28</a>, <a href="1898" class="uri" title="wikilink">1898</a>, they demanded the surrender of the Spanish army. The Spanish governor of the region, Enrique de las Morena y Fossi, refused. Immediately, the Filipinos attacked Baler in a battle that was to last for seven months. Despite being outnumbered and suffering hunger and disease, the battalion did not capitulate. In the meantime, Zayas and the rest of the battalion were totally unaware of the Spanish-American War that was going on. On August 1898, the hostilities between the United States and Spain came to an end. The Philippines became a U.S. possession under the accordance of the Treaty of Paris. The battalion at Baler found out about the Spanish-American War and its aftermath in May 1899, and surrendered on <a href="June_2" title="wikilink">June 2</a>, <a href="1899" class="uri" title="wikilink">1899</a>. They were unaware that they had been fighting for a possession that was no longer theirs. The 32 survivors of Zayas Battalion were sent to Manila, where they boarded a ship for Spain. In Spain, they were given a hero's welcome and became known as <em>los Ultimos de Baler</em>—&quot;the Last of Baler.&quot;</p>

<p><img src="Esteves.jpg" title="fig:Major General Luis R. Esteves (Army)" alt="Major General Luis R. Esteves (Army)" width="150" /> In <a href="1906" class="uri" title="wikilink">1906</a>, a group of Puerto Ricans met with the appointed Governor Winthrop, and suggested the organization of a Puerto Rican National Guard. The petition failed because the <a href="United_States_Constitution" title="wikilink">U.S. Constitution</a> prohibits the formation of any armed force within the United States and its territories without the authorization of Congress.</p>
<p>On <a href="June_19" title="wikilink">June 19</a>, <a href="1915" class="uri" title="wikilink">1915</a>, Major General <a href="Luis_R._Esteves" title="wikilink">Luis R.

While he attended West Point, he tutored fellow classmate <a href="Dwight_D._Eisenhower" title="wikilink">Dwight D. Eisenhower</a> in <a href="Spanish_language" title="wikilink">Spanish</a>; a second language was required in order to graduate. Esteves graduated first in his class.

He would also in the future play a key role in the formation of the Puerto Rican National Guard.</p>

<p><img src="Lt_Pedro_Albizu_Campos.JPG" title="fig:Lieutenant Pedro Albizu Campos (U.S. Army)" alt="Lieutenant Pedro Albizu Campos (U.S. Army)" width="150" /> Upon the outbreak of <a href="World_War_I" title="wikilink">World War I</a>, the <a href="U.S._Congress" title="wikilink">U.S. Congress</a> approved the <a href="Jones-Shafroth_Act" title="wikilink">Jones-Shafroth Act</a>, which granted Puerto Ricans <a href="citizenship" class="uri" title="wikilink">citizenship</a>. As a result, many Puerto Ricans became eligible for the military <a href="Conscription" title="wikilink">draft</a>. On <a href="May_3" title="wikilink">May 3</a>, <a href="1917" class="uri" title="wikilink">1917</a>, the Regiment recruited 1,969 men. The 295th and 296 Infantry Regiments were created in Puerto Rico. The first shot of World War I (by the US) was not fired in Europe, it was fired in Puerto Rico by a Puerto Rican serving in the US Army, Lieutenant <a href="Teofilo_Marxuach" title="wikilink">Teofilo Marxuach</a>. Lieutenant Marxuach was officer of the day at El Morro Castle, at the entrance to San Juan Bay, when war was declared. An armed supply ship for German submarines in the Atlantic, the Odenwald, tried to force its way out of the bay. Lieutenant Marxuach opened fire from the walls of the fortress and forced the ship to return to port and be interned.</p>
<p>On <a href="May_17" title="wikilink">May 17</a>, 1917, the Porto Rico Regiment of Infantry was sent to guard the <a href="Panama_Canal" title="wikilink">Panama Canal</a> in defense of the <a href="Panama_Canal_Zone" title="wikilink">Panama Canal Zone</a>. In <a href="New_York" title="wikilink">New York</a>, many Puerto Ricans joined the 396th Infantry Regiment which was mostly composed of <a href="Afro-Americans" class="uri" title="wikilink">Afro-Americans</a>. They were not allowed to fight alongside their white counterparts; however, they were permitted to fight as members of a French unit in French uniforms. They fought along the <a href="Western_Front" title="wikilink">Western Front</a> in <a href="France" class="uri" title="wikilink">France</a>, and their reputation earned them the nickname of &quot;the Harlem Hell Fighters&quot; by the <a href="German_Empire" title="wikilink">Germans</a>. Among them was Lieutenant <a href="Pedro_Albizu_Campos" title="wikilink">Pedro Albizu Campos</a>, who later became the leader of the <a href="Puerto_Rican_Nationalist_Party" title="wikilink">Puerto Rican Nationalist Party</a> and <a href="Rafael_Hernandez" title="wikilink">Rafael Hernandez</a>, considered by many as Puerto Rico's greatest composer. The 396th was awarded French Croix De Guerre for battlefield gallantry by the President of France. The Porto Rico Regiment returned to Puerto Rico on March 1919 and was renamed the <a href="The_65th_Infantry_Regiment" title="wikilink">65th Infantry Regiment</a> under the Reorganization Act of <a href="June_4" title="wikilink">June 4</a>, <a href="1920" class="uri" title="wikilink">1920</a>.</p>
<p>The need for a Puerto Rican National Guard unit became apparent to Major General Luis R. Esteves, who had served as instructor of Puerto Rican Officers for the Porto Rico Regiment of Infantry at Camp Las Casas in Puerto Rico. His request was met with the approval of the government and Puerto Rican Legislature. In 1919, the first regiment of the Puerto Rican National Guard was formed, and General Luis R. Esteves became the first official Commandant of the Puerto Rican National Guard.</p>
<p>Puerto Rico suffered greatly during the <a href="Great_Depression" title="wikilink">Great Depression</a> of the 1930s, and many Puerto Ricans moved to the <a href="East_Coast_of_the_United_States" title="wikilink">East Coast of the United States</a> looking for jobs and a better way of life. On the island, the unemployment rate continued to rise. Many of the Puerto Ricans who were unable to find a job looked to the Armed Forces of the United States as a source of employment. Not only were they paid better than at the few other available jobs, but they were also guaranteed three meals a day, clothing, and shelter.</p>

<p>When the United States declared war against the <a href="Empire_of_Japan" title="wikilink">Empire of Japan</a> and <a href="Nazi_Germany" title="wikilink">Nazi Germany</a>, recruiters were sent to the island. In <a href="1944" class="uri" title="wikilink">1944</a>, the Army Nurse Corps decided to actively recruit Puerto Rican nurses so that Army hospitals would not have to deal with the language barriers. Among them was Lieutenant <a href="Carmen_Durnier" title="wikilink">Carmen Durnier</a>, who became one of the first Puerto Rican female military officers. In <a href="1942" class="uri" title="wikilink">1942</a>, the <a href="65th_Infantry" title="wikilink">65th Infantry</a> underwent an extensive training program, and in <a href="1943" class="uri" title="wikilink">1943</a> it was sent to <a href="Panama_Canal_Zone" title="wikilink">Panama</a> to protect the <a href="Pacific_Ocean" title="wikilink">Pacific</a> and the <a href="Atlantic_Ocean" title="wikilink">Atlantic</a> sides of the <a href="isthmus" class="uri" title="wikilink">isthmus</a>. <img src="Pedro_del_Valle.jpg" title="fig:&#39; Lt.

There was a total of 47 battle casualties. The first Puerto Rican to be killed in action from the <a href="65th_Infantry" title="wikilink">65th Infantry</a> was Sergeant Angel Martinez, from the town of <a href="Sabana_Grande,_Puerto_Rico" title="wikilink">Sabana Grande</a>. On <a href="April_20" title="wikilink">April 20</a>, the 65th overran a sub-camp of the <a href="Flossenburg" class="uri" title="wikilink">Flossenburg</a> Concentration Camp. On <a href="March_18" title="wikilink">March 18</a>, <a href="1945" class="uri" title="wikilink">1945</a>, the regiment was sent to the <a href="Germany" title="wikilink">District of Mannheim</a> and assigned to <a href="military_occupation" title="wikilink">military occupation</a> duties. In all, the <a href="65th_Infantry" title="wikilink">65th Infantry</a> participated in the battles of <a href="Naples" class="uri" title="wikilink">Naples</a>-Fogis, <a href="Rome" class="uri" title="wikilink">Rome</a>-Arno, <a href="central_Europe" title="wikilink">central Europe</a> and of the <a href="Rhineland" class="uri" title="wikilink">Rhineland</a>. On <a href="October_27" title="wikilink">October 27</a>, 1945, the regiment sailed from France, arriving at Puerto Rico on <a href="November_9" title="wikilink">November 9</a>, 1945. The regiment suffered a total of 23 soldiers killed in action. Other Puerto Ricans who played an important role during the war were Admiral <a href="Horacio_Rivero" title="wikilink">Horacio Rivero</a>, the highest ranking Hispanic in the history of the U.S. Navy, who provided artillery cover for the Marines landing on <a href="Guadalcanal" class="uri" title="wikilink">Guadalcanal</a>, <a href="Marshall_Islands" title="wikilink">Marshall Islands</a>, and Okinawa; and Lieutenant General <a href="Pedro_del_Valle" title="wikilink">Pedro del Valle</a>, the first Hispanic <a href="United_States_Marine_Corps" title="wikilink">Marine Corps</a> general, who had an active role in the Guam Operation and became the Commanding General of the First Marine Division.

<h3 id="revolt-against-the-united-states">Revolt against the United States</h3>
<p>In the mid-1940's, Puerto Rico had various pro-independence groups. One such group was the <a href="Puerto_Rican_Independence_Party" title="wikilink">Puerto Rican Independence Party</a> which believed in gaining the island's independence through the electoral process. Another group was the <a href="Puerto_Rican_Nationalist_Party" title="wikilink">Puerto Rican Nationalist Party</a> which believed in the concept of armed revolution. On <a href="October_30" title="wikilink">October 30</a>, <a href="1950" class="uri" title="wikilink">1950</a> the nationalists, under the leadership of Dr. <a href="Pedro_Albizu_Campos" title="wikilink">Pedro Albizu Campos</a> staged uprisings in the towns of <a href="Ponce" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ponce</a>, <a href="Mayag&lt;U+00FC&gt;ez,_Puerto_Rico" title="wikilink">Mayag&lt;U+00FC&gt;ez</a>, <a href="Naranjito" class="uri" title="wikilink">Naranjito</a>, <a href="Arecibo" class="uri" title="wikilink">Arecibo</a>, <a href="Utuado" class="uri" title="wikilink">Utuado</a>, <a href="San_Juan,_Puerto_Rico" title="wikilink">San Juan</a> and <a href="Jayuya" class="uri" title="wikilink">Jayuya</a>. <img src="Blanca_Canales.JPG" title="fig:Blanca Canales" alt="Blanca Canales" width="130" /> The most notable of these occurred in Jayuya in what became known as <a href="El_Grito_de_Jayuya" title="wikilink">El Grito de Jayuya</a>. Nationalist leader <a href="Blanca_Canales" title="wikilink">Blanca Canales</a> led the armed nationalists into the town and attacked the police station. A small battle with the police occurred and one officer was killed and three others wounded before the rest dropped their weapons and surrendered. The nationalists cut the <a href="telephone" class="uri" title="wikilink">telephone</a> lines and burned the post office. Canales led the group into the town square where the light blue version of the <a href="Puerto_Rican_Flag" title="wikilink">Puerto Rican Flag</a> was raised (it was against the law to carry a Puerto Rican Flag from 1898 to 1952). In the town square, Canales gave a speech and declared Puerto Rico a free Republic. The town was held by the nationalists for three days.</p>
<p>The United States declared <a href="martial_law" title="wikilink">martial law</a> in Puerto Rico and sent the <a href="United_States_National_Guard" title="wikilink">Puerto Rico National Guard</a> to attack Jayuya. The town was attacked by air by <a href="U.S." class="uri" title="wikilink">U.S.</a> bomber planes and on land by artillery. Even though part of the town was destroyed, news of this military action was prevented from spreading outside of Puerto Rico. It was called an incident between Puerto Ricans. The top leaders of the nationalist party were arrested, including Albizu Campos and Blanca Canales, and sent to jail to serve long prison terms. Griselio Torresola was in the United States where, together with fellow nationalist <a href="Oscar_Collazo" title="wikilink">Oscar Collazo</a>, he decided to assassinate <a href="Harry_Truman" title="wikilink">President Harry S.

<p><img src="Company_c.JPG" title="fig:Company &quot;C&quot; of the 65th Infantry on patrol" alt="Company &quot;C&quot; of the 65th Infantry on patrol" width="200" /> On <a href="August_26" title="wikilink">August 26</a>, <a href="1950" class="uri" title="wikilink">1950</a>, the <a href="65th_Infantry" title="wikilink">65th Infantry</a> departed from Puerto Rico and arrived in Pusan, Korea on <a href="September_23" title="wikilink">September 23</a>, 1950. It was during the long sea voyage that the men nicknamed the 65th Infantry &quot;Borinqueneers&quot;. The name is a combination of the words &quot;Borinquen&quot; (which was what the <a href="Tainos" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tainos</a> called the island before the arrival if the <a href="Spaniard" title="wikilink">Spaniards</a>) and &quot;Buccaneers&quot;. The men of the 65th were the first infantrymen to meet the enemy on the battle fields of Korea. Among the hardships suffered by the Puerto Ricans was the lack of warm clothing during the cold and harsh winters. The enemy made many attempts to encircle the Regiment, but each time they failed because of the many casualties inflicted by the 65th. On December 1950, the <a href="U.S._Marine_Corps" title="wikilink">U.S. Marines</a> found themselves at the Chosin Reservoir area. In June 1951, The 65th was part of a task force which enabled the Marines to withdraw from the Hauack-on Reservoir. When the Marines were encircled by the <a href="Chinese_Communist" title="wikilink">Chinese Communist</a> troops close to the <a href="Manchuria" title="wikilink">Manchurian</a> border, the 65th rushed to their defense. As a consequence, the Marines were able to return safely to their ships.</p>
<p>Among the battles and operations in which the 65th participated was the Operation &quot;Killer&quot; of January 1951, becoming the first Regiment to cross the Han River. On April 1951, the Regiment participated in the Uijonber Corridor drives and on June 1951, the 65th was the third Regiment to cross the Han Ton River. The 65th was the Regiment which took and held Cherwon and they were also instrumental in breaking the &quot;Iron Triangle&quot; of Hill 717 on July 1951.
