<h3 id="section">2011</h3>
<h4 id="october">October</h4>
<p>Following protests in London, Bristol and elsewhere in Britain, a Facebook page was set up under the name of Occupy Bath, calling for a public meeting to discuss the possibility of a protest camp in Bath. The meeting, held at the Percy Centre, agreed upon the date of 30 October 2011 for the establishment of a camp at location undisclosed to the attendees of the meeting.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>Approximately 30 protestors met at Green Park Station on 30 October 2011 to determine the location of the camp and decided on <a href="Queen_Square" title="wikilink">Queen Square</a>, due to it being passed by thousands of people every day.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> The camp was established later that night, with 11 tents set up.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> Avon and Somerset police were in attendance at the beginning, but left after they considered the protest to be peaceful. <a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p>Initially, the organisers of the Facebook group stated that the camp would end on 12 November 2011, <a href="Remembrance_Day" title="wikilink">Remembrance Day</a>.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> <a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<h4 id="november">November</h4>
<p>Within days of setting up camp, Bath and North East Somerset Council stated that they wanted the camp gone by Remembrance Day or sooner, expressing concerns about the state of the grass and disruption to others wishing to use the space and threatening legal action if the camp were to continue past Remembrance Day.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a><a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> The protestors claimed shortly afterwards that the leave date of Remembrance Day was due to the original Facebook event requiring an end date, and that they would leave when they felt it was time to.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> By the second week, approximately 20 people were camped out. Local MP <a href="Don_Foster" title="wikilink">Don Foster</a> visited the camp, stating that he did not have a problem with the camp being there <a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a>, that society should support the least well-off and that the country should not support banks &quot;not only if they get it wrong in terms of lending mortgages but many other issues&quot;. <a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
<p>During November the protestors held a variety of public events at the camp, including talks, debates and public lectures<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> <a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> and daily T'ai Chi workshops. <a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> The protestors also engaged in a boules match with the local boules team, who use the pitch on Queen Square.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> The protestors did not move on Remembrance Day, but instead laid poppy wreaths at the war memorial.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> The protest gained the support of many local groups and individuals<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> and, despite remaining beyond Remembrance Day, the council made no attempt to move them on, stating that they were maintaining a watching brief and &lt;U+201C&gt;keeping the site in good order&lt;U+201D&gt;<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a>, however a council official met with the group to discuss a possible end to the demonstration.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a></p>
<p>Protestors from the Occupy Bath camp attended a conference with representatives from other British Occupy camps at <a href="Occupy_London" title="wikilink">Occupy London</a> on 19 November, based in the <a href="Bank_of_Ideas" title="wikilink">Bank of Ideas</a>, a repossessed <a href="UBS" class="uri" title="wikilink">UBS</a> bank building. <a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a><a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a></p>
<p>By mid-late November, numbers on site had begun to decline, particularly overnight<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a>, with approximately 10-15 people staying at the camp. <a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> Towards the end of November, the protestors announced that they would be joining the union march during the strike on 30 November 2011, and invited marchers to visit the camp following the march, where there would be speakers, an attempt to explore common ground, and a big announcement. <a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> <a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> Protestors spoke in front of the trade unionists in Victoria Park and announced the beginning of a new forum for Bath - the Bath People's Assembly - &quot;an independent, democratic, non-affiliated body for discussion, debate and the formulation of ideas and proposals on local, national and global issues and policies&quot;.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> <a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> <a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> <a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> <a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a></p>
<h4 id="december">December</h4>
<p>The first meeting of the Bath People's Assembly was held on 2 December 2011 and was attended by over 50 people. Issues discussed included local housing and the war in Afghanistan. A second meeting was organised for 15 December <a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> <a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a></p>
<p>During early December, the camp moved to the other side of Queen Square in order to avoid permanent damage to the grass. <a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> <a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a></p>
<p>The protestors packed up the camp on 10 December 2011, stating that they wanted to focus on the Bath People's Assembly and on direct action in the area, stating &quot;This is only the beginning&quot;.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> <a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> They claimed that up to 50 people had been camping in Queen Square at the height of the protest. Despite previous warnings from B&amp;NES council, the protestors were not forced to move. <a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> B&amp;NES council said that they planned to send in teams to clean up Queen Square once the protestors have left<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a>, however following the departure the protestors stated 'we clean up our mess, unlike the banks'<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> Following the dismantling of the camp, the protestors put down grass seed to repair the damage they had caused to the grass.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> <a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="section-1">2012</h3>
<h4 id="january">January</h4>
<p>The protestors returned to Queen Square to cook and eat a meal under a gazebo. The purpose of this was to regroup and to encourage others to cook communally to save money and energy. The meal was attended by approximately 25 people, despite heavy rain.<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="manifesto">Manifesto</h2>
<p>The Occupy Bath Manifesto<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a> <a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a>:</p>
<p>1 The current system is unsustainable. It is undemocratic and unjust. We need alternatives..</p>
<p>2 We are of all ethnicity, backgrounds, genders, generations, sexualities dis/abilities and faiths. We stand together with occupations all over the world.</p>
<p>3 We refuse to pay for the banks' crisis.</p>
<p>4 We do not accept the cuts as either necessary or inevitable. We demand an end to global tax injustice and our democracy representing corporations instead of the people.</p>
<p>5 We want regulators to be genuinely independent of the industries they regulate.</p>
<p>6 We support the strike on November 30 and the student action on November 9, and actions to defend our health services, welfare, education and employment, and to stop wars and arms dealing.</p>
<p>7 We want structural change towards authentic global equality. The world's resources must go towards caring for people and the planet, not the military, corporate profits or the rich.</p>
<p>8 We stand in solidarity with the global oppressed and we call for an end to the actions of our government and others in causing this oppression.</p>
<p>9 This is what democracy looks like. Come and join us!</p>
