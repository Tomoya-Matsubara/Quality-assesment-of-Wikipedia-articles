<p><strong>Tiberius Caesar Augustus</strong>, born <strong>Tiberius Claudius Nero</strong> (<a href="November_16" title="wikilink">November 16</a>, <a href="42_BC" title="wikilink">42 BC</a> â€“ <a href="March_16" title="wikilink">March 16</a> <a href="37" title="wikilink">AD 37</a>), was the second <a href="Roman_Emperor" title="wikilink">Roman Emperor</a>, from the death of <a href="Augustus" class="uri" title="wikilink">Augustus</a> in <a href="14" title="wikilink">AD 14</a> until his own death in 37. Tiberius was by birth a <a href="Claudius_(gens)" title="wikilink">Claudian</a>, son of <a href="Tiberius_Nero" title="wikilink">Tiberius Claudius Nero</a> and <a href="Livia" title="wikilink">Livia Drusilla</a>. His mother divorced his father and was remarried to Octavian <a href="Augustus" class="uri" title="wikilink">Augustus</a> in <a href="39_BC" title="wikilink">39 BC</a>. Tiberius would later marry Augustus' daughter <a href="Julia_the_Elder" title="wikilink">Julia the Elder</a> (from an earlier marriage) and even later be adopted by Augustus and by this act he became a <a href="Julii" title="wikilink">Julian</a>. The subsequent emperors after Tiberius would continue this blended dynasty of both families for the next forty years; historians have named it the <a href="Julio-Claudian_dynasty" title="wikilink">Julio-Claudian dynasty</a>.</p>
<p>Tiberius Claudius Nero is recognized as one of <a href="Ancient_Rome" title="wikilink">Rome's</a> greatest <a href="general" title="wikilink">generals</a>, whose campaigns in <a href="Pannonia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Pannonia</a>, <a href="Illyricum" class="uri" title="wikilink">Illyricum</a>, <a href="Rhaetia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Rhaetia</a> and <a href="Germania" class="uri" title="wikilink">Germania</a> laid the foundations for the northern frontier. But he came to be remembered as a dark, reclusive, and sombre ruler (<em>tristissimus hominum</em> &lt;U+2013&gt; &lt;U+2018&gt;the gloomiest of men&lt;U+2019&gt;, by one account<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>), who never really desired to be emperor. After the death of Tiberius&lt;U+2019&gt; son <a href="Drusus" class="uri" title="wikilink">Drusus</a> in 23, the quality of his rule declined and ended in a terror. In 26 Tiberius exiled himself from Rome and left administration largely in the hands of his unscrupulous <a href="Praetorian_Prefect" title="wikilink">Praetorian Prefects</a> <a href="Lucius_Aelius_Sejanus" title="wikilink">Lucius Aelius Sejanus</a> and Quintus <a href="Naevius_Sutorius_Macro" title="wikilink">Naevius Sutorius Macro</a>. <a href="Caligula" class="uri" title="wikilink">Caligula</a>, Tiberius&lt;U+2019&gt; adopted grandson, succeeded the Emperor on his demise.</p>

<h3 id="background">Background</h3>
<p>Tiberius Claudius Germanicus Augustus Nero was born on <a href="16_November" title="wikilink">16 November</a> <a href="42_BC" title="wikilink">42 BC</a> to <a href="Tiberius_Nero" title="wikilink">Tiberius Nero</a> and <a href="Livia_Drusilla" title="wikilink">Livia Drusilla</a>, in Rome.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> In <a href="39_BC" title="wikilink">39 BC</a>, his mother divorced his biological father and remarried <a href="Augustus" title="wikilink">Gaius Julius Caesar Octavianus</a> shortly thereafter, while still pregnant with Tiberius Nero's son. Shortly thereafter in 38 BC his brother, <a href="Nero_Claudius_Drusus" title="wikilink">Nero Claudius Drusus</a>, was born.</p>
<p>Little is recorded of Tiberius's early life. In <a href="32_BC" title="wikilink">32 BC</a>, Tiberius made his first public appearance at the age of nine, delivering the eulogy for his biological father.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> In <a href="29_BC" title="wikilink">29 BC</a>, both he and his brother Drusus rode in the triumphal chariot along with their adoptive father Octavian in celebration of the defeat of Antony and Cleopatra at <a href="Actium" class="uri" title="wikilink">Actium</a>.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> In 26 BC, Augustus became gravely ill, and his possible death threatened to plunge the Roman world into chaos again. Historians generally agree that it is during this time that the question of Augustus's heir became most acute, and while Augustus had seemed to indicate that Agrippa and Marcellus would carry on his position in the event of his death, the ambiguity of succession became Augustus's chief problem.</p>
<p>In response, a series of potential heirs seem to have been selected, among them Tiberius and his brother, Drusus. In <a href="24_BC" title="wikilink">24 BC</a>, at the age of seventeen, Tiberius entered politics under Augustus's direction, receiving the position of <a href="quaestor" class="uri" title="wikilink">quaestor</a>,<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> and was granted the right to stand election for <a href="praetor" class="uri" title="wikilink">praetor</a> and <a href="consul" class="uri" title="wikilink">consul</a> five years in advance of the age required by law.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> Similar provisions were made for Drusus.</p>
<h3 id="civil-and-military-career">Civil and military career</h3>
<p>Shortly thereafter Tiberius began appearing in court as an <a href="advocate" class="uri" title="wikilink">advocate</a>,<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> and it is presumably here that his interest in Greek rhetoric began. In <a href="20_BC" title="wikilink">20 BC</a>, Tiberius was sent East under <a href="Marcus_Agrippa" title="wikilink">Marcus Agrippa</a>. The <a href="Parthians" class="uri" title="wikilink">Parthians</a> had captured the standards of the <a href="Roman_legion" title="wikilink">legions</a> under the command of <a href="Marcus_Crassus" title="wikilink">Marcus Crassus</a> (<a href="53_BC" title="wikilink">53 BC</a>), Decidius Saxa (<a href="40_BC" title="wikilink">40 BC</a>), and <a href="Mark_Antony" title="wikilink">Mark Antony</a> (<a href="36_BC" title="wikilink">36 BC</a>).<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> After several years of negotiation, Tiberius lead a sizable force into Armenia, presumably with the goal of establishing Armenia as a Roman client-state and as a threat on the Roman-Parthian border, and Augustus was able to reach a compromise whereby these standards were returned, and Armenia remained a neutral territory between the two powers.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<p><img src="Vipsania.jpg" title="fig:Vipsania Agrippina" alt="Vipsania Agrippina" width="150" /> After returning from the East in 19 BC, Tiberius was married to <a href="Vipsania_Agrippina" title="wikilink">Vipsania Agrippina</a>, the daughter of Augustus&lt;U+2019&gt;s close friend and greatest general, <a href="Marcus_Vipsanius_Agrippa" title="wikilink">Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa</a>,<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> appointed praetor, and sent with his legions to assist his brother Drusus in campaigns in the west. While Drusus focused his forces in Gallia Narbonensis and along the German frontier, Tiberius combated the tribes in the <a href="Alps" class="uri" title="wikilink">Alps</a> and within Transalpine Gaul. In 16 BC he discovered the sources of the <a href="Danube" class="uri" title="wikilink">Danube</a>, and soon afterwards the bend of the middle course. Returning to Rome in 13 BC, Tiberius was appointed as consul, and around this same time his son, <a href="Julius_Caesar_Drusus" title="wikilink">Julius Caesar Drusus</a>, was born.</p>
<p>Agrippa's death in <a href="12_BC" title="wikilink">12 BC</a> elevated both Tiberius and Drusus in regards to the succession. Tiberius, on Augustus&lt;U+2019&gt;s order, divorced Vipsania and married <a href="Julia_the_Elder" title="wikilink">Julia the Elder</a>, Augustus's daughter and Agrippa's widow.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> This event seems to have been the breaking point for Tiberius; the marriage between him and Julia was never a happy one, and produced only a single child which died in infancy.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> Reportedly, Tiberius once ran into Vipsania again, and proceeded to follow her home crying and begging forgiveness;<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> soon afterwards, Tiberius met with Augustus, and steps were taken to ensure that the two would never meet again. Tiberius continued to be elevated by Augustus, and after Agrippa's death and his brother Drusus's death in <a href="9_BC" title="wikilink">9 BC</a>, seemed the clear candidate for succession. As such, in 12 BC he received military commissions in <a href="Pannonia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Pannonia</a> and <a href="Germania" class="uri" title="wikilink">Germania</a>; both areas highly volatile and both areas key to Augustan policy. He returned to Rome and was consul for a second time in <a href="7_BC" title="wikilink">7 BC</a>, and in 6 BC was granted <a href="tribune" title="wikilink">tribunician power</a> <em>(tribunicia potestas)</em> and control in the East,<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> all of which mirrored positions that Agrippa had previously held. However, despite these successes and despite his advancement, Tiberius was not happy.</p>
<h3 id="retirement-to-rhodes">Retirement to Rhodes</h3>
<p><img src="SperlongaVillaTiberio.jpg" title="fig:Remnants of Tiberius&#39; villa at Sperlonga, a Roman resort midway between Rome and Naples." alt="Remnants of Tiberius&#39; villa at Sperlonga, a Roman resort midway between Rome and Naples." width="250" /> In <a href="6_BC" title="wikilink">6 BC</a>, Tiberius, on the verge of accepting command in the East and becoming the second most powerful man in Rome, suddenly announced his withdrawal from politics and retired to <a href="Rhodes" class="uri" title="wikilink">Rhodes</a>. The precise motives for Tiberius's withdrawal are unclear.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> Historians have speculated a connection with Augustus&lt;U+2019&gt;s grandchildren <a href="Gaius" class="uri" title="wikilink">Gaius</a> and <a href="Lucius" class="uri" title="wikilink">Lucius</a>, whom Augustus had adopted, and were being elevated along the same political path that both Tiberius and Drusus had been. Tiberius thus was an interim solution; he would hold power only until Lucius and Gaius came of age, and then be swept aside. The promiscuous, and very public, behavior of his unhappily married wife, Julia, may have also played a part;<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> indeed <a href="Tacitus" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tacitus</a> calls it Tiberius' <em>intima causa</em>, his innermost reason for departing for Rhodes, and seems to ascribe the entire move to a hatred of Julia and a longing for Vipsania.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> Tiberius had found himself married to a woman he loathed, who publicly humiliated him with nighttime escapades in the Forum, and forbidden to see the woman he had loved.</p>
<p>Whatever Tiberius's motives, the withdrawal was almost disastrous for Augustus's succession plans. <a href="Gaius_Caesar" title="wikilink">Gaius Caesar</a> and <a href="Lucius_Caesar" title="wikilink">Lucius Caesar</a> were still in their early teens, and Augustus, now 57 years old, had no immediate successor. There was no longer a guarantee of a peaceful transfer of power after Augustus's death, nor a guarantee that should the position of Princeps survive his family, and therefore his families allies, would hold power over it.</p>
<p>Somewhat apocryphal stories tell of Augustus pleading with Tiberius to stay, even going so far as to stage a serious illness; Tiberius's response was to anchor off the shore of <a href="Ostia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ostia</a> until word came that Augustus had survived, then sailing straightway for Rhodes.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> Tiberius reportedly discovered the error of his ways and requested to return to Rome several times; each time Augustus refused the request.</p>
<h3 id="heir-to-augustus">Heir to Augustus</h3>
<p>With Tiberius's departure, succession rested solely on <a href="Augustus" class="uri" title="wikilink">Augustus</a>' two young grandsons, Lucius and Gaius Caesar. The situation became more precarious in <a href="2" title="wikilink">AD 2</a> with the death of Lucius; Augustus, with perhaps some prompting from Livia, allowed Tiberius to return to Rome as a private citizen and nothing more.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> In <a href="4" title="wikilink">AD 4</a>, Gaius was killed in <a href="Armenia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Armenia</a> and, to paraphrase Tacitus, Augustus had no other choice but to turn to Tiberius.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a><a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a></p>
<p>The death of Gaius in AD 4 initiated a flurry of activity in the household of Augustus. Tiberius was adopted as full son and heir along with the young <a href="Postumus_Agrippa" title="wikilink">Postumus Agrippa</a>, the third son of Julia the Elder and <a href="Marcus_Agrippa" title="wikilink">Marcus Agrippa</a>. In turn, Tiberius was required to adopt his nephew, <a href="Germanicus" class="uri" title="wikilink">Germanicus</a>, the son of his brother Drusus and Augustus' niece <a href="Antonia_Minor" title="wikilink">Antonia Minor</a>.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a><a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> Along with his adoption, Tiberius received tribunician power as well as a share of Augustus's <em>maius imperium</em>, something that no one else had ever shared.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> In <a href="7" title="wikilink">AD 7</a>, Postumus was disowned by Augustus and banned to the island of <a href="Pianosa" title="wikilink">Planasia</a>, to live in solitary confinment.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a><a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> Thus, when in <a href="13" title="wikilink">AD 13</a>, the powers held by Tiberius were made equal, rather than second, to Augustus's own powers, he was for all intents and purposes a &quot;co-princeps&quot; with Augustus, and in the event of the latter's passing, would simply continue to rule without an <a href="interregnum" class="uri" title="wikilink">interregnum</a> or possible upheaval.</p>
<p>Augustus finally died in <a href="14" title="wikilink">AD 14</a>, at the age of seventy-six. He was buried with all due ceremony and, as had been arranged beforehand, <a href="apotheosis" title="wikilink">deified</a>, his will read, and Tiberius confirmed as his sole surviving heir.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="emperor">Emperor</h2>
<h3 id="early-reign">Early reign</h3>
<p><img src="Tiberius_bust.jpg" title="fig:The younger Emperor Tiberius" alt="The younger Emperor Tiberius" width="200" /> While the reality of Tiberius's position as the new Princeps could not be denied, the ceremonial aspect of the transference of power was something that neither the Senate, nor indeed Tiberius, knew how to handle. The Senate convened on <a href="18_September" title="wikilink">18 September</a>, ostensibly to validate Tiberius's position as Princeps and, as it had done with Augustus before, extend the powers of the position to him. <a href="Tacitus" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tacitus</a> gives what can only be thought of as a full account of the proceedings. Tiberius already had the administrative and political powers of the Princeps, all he lacked were the titles- Augustus, <a href="Pater_Patriae" title="wikilink">Pater Patriae</a>, and the <a href="Civic_Crown" title="wikilink">Civic Crown</a> (a crown made from <a href="laurel" class="uri" title="wikilink">laurel</a> and <a href="oak" class="uri" title="wikilink">oak</a>, in honor of Augustus having saved the lives of Roman citizens). Tiberius, however, attempted to play the role of Augustus, that is of the reluctant public servant who wants nothing more than to serve the state, and ended up throwing the entire affair into confusion. Rather than humble, he came across as derisive; rather than seeming to want to serve the state, he seemed obstructive.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> He cited his age as a reason why he could not act as Princeps, stated he did not wish the position, and then proceeeded to ask for only a section of the state. The Senate, thoroughly confused, asked which part of the state he would like. Finally, one senator cried, &quot;Sire, for how long will you allow the State to be without a head?&quot;<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> Tiberius finally relented and accepted the powers voted to him, though according to Tacitus and Suetonius he refused to bear the titles <a href="Pater_Patriae" title="wikilink">Pater Patriae</a>, Imperator, and Augustus, and declined the most solid emblem of the Princeps, the Civic Crown and laurels.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a></p>
<p>This meeting seems to have set the tone for Tiberius's entire rule. He seems to have wished for the Senate and the state to simply act without him; his direct orders were vague, inspiring debate more on what he actually meant than on passing his legislation.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> In his first few years, Tiberius seems to have wanted the Senate to act on its own,<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> rather than as a servant to his will as it had been under Augustus; according to Tacitus, Tiberius derided the Senate as &quot;men fit to be slaves&quot;.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="rise-and-fall-of-germanicus">Rise and fall of Germanicus</h3>
<p>Problems arose quickly for the new Princeps. The legions posted in <a href="Pannonia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Pannonia</a> and in <a href="Germania" class="uri" title="wikilink">Germania</a> had not been paid the bonuses promised them by Augustus, and after a short period of time, when it was clear that a response from Tiberius was not forthcoming, <a href="mutiny" title="wikilink">mutinied</a>.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> <a href="Germanicus" class="uri" title="wikilink">Germanicus</a> and Tiberius's son, <a href="Julius_Caesar_Drusus" title="wikilink">Drusus</a>, were dispatched with a small force to quell the uprising and bring the legions back in line. Rather than simply quell the mutiny however, Germanicus rallied the mutineers and led them on a short campaign across the Rhine into Germanic territory, stating that whatever booty they could grab would count as their bonus.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> Germanicus's forces smashed across the Rhine and quickly occupied all of the territory between the Rhine and the <a href="Elbe" class="uri" title="wikilink">Elbe</a>. Additionally, Tacitus records the capture of the <a href="Teutoburg_forest" title="wikilink">Teutoburg forest</a> and the reclaiming of <a href="aquila_(Roman)" title="wikilink">standards</a> lost years before by <a href="Publius_Quinctilius_Varus" title="wikilink">Publius Quinctilius Varus</a>,<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> when four Roman legions <a href="Battle_of_the_Teutoburg_Forest" title="wikilink">had been ambushed</a> by a band of Germans. In the face of inaction by Tiberius, Germanicus had managed to deal a significant blow to Rome's enemies, quell an uprising of troops, and once again return lost standards to Rome, actions that placed the young Germanicus in a clear &quot;Augustan&quot; light when compared with befuddled Tiberius.</p>
<p>After being recalled from Germania,<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> Germanicus celebrated a <a href="Roman_triumph" title="wikilink">triumph</a> in Rome in <a href="17" title="wikilink">AD 17</a>,<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> the first full triumph that the city had seen since Augustus's own in <a href="29" title="wikilink">29 BC</a>. As a result, in <a href="18" title="wikilink">AD 18</a> Germanicus was granted control over the eastern part of the empire, just as both Agrippa and Tiberius had received before, and was clearly the successor to Tiberius.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> Germanicus survived a little over a year before dying, accusing <a href="Gnaeus_Calpurnius_Piso" title="wikilink">Gnaeus Calpurnius Piso</a>, the governor of <a href="Syria" class="uri" title="wikilink">Syria</a>, of murdering him.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> The Pisones had been longtime supporters of the Claudians, and had allied themselves with the young Octavian after his marriage to Livia, the mother of Tiberius; Germanicus's death and accusations indicted the new Princeps. Piso was placed on trial and, according to Tacitus, threatened to implicate Tiberius.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> Whether the governor actually could connect the Princeps to the death of Germanicus will never be known; rather than continuing to stand trial when it became evident that the Senate was against him, Piso committed <a href="suicide" class="uri" title="wikilink">suicide</a>.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a><a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a></p>
<p>Tiberius seems to have tired of politics at this point. In AD 22, he shared his tribunician authority with his son Drusus,<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> and began making yearly excursions to Campania that reportedly became longer and longer every year. In AD 23, Drusus mysteriously died,<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a><a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> and Tiberius seems to have made no effort to elevate a replacement. Finally, in <a href="26" title="wikilink">AD 26</a>, Tiberius retired from Rome altogether to the island of <a href="Capri" class="uri" title="wikilink">Capri</a>.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a></p>

As Tiberius became more embittered with the position of Princeps, he began to depend more and more upon the limited secretariat left to him by Augustus, and specifically upon Sejanus and the Praetorians. In AD 17 or 18, Tiberius had trimmed the ranks of the <a href="Praetorian_guard" title="wikilink">Praetorian guard</a> responsible for the defense of the city, and had moved it from encampments outside of the city walls <a href="Castra_Praetoria" title="wikilink">into the city itself</a>,<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a> giving Sejanus access to somewhere between 6000 and 9000 troops. The death of Drusus elevated Sejanus, at least in Tiberius's eyes, who thereafter refers to him as &quot;my partner&quot;. Tiberius had statues of Sejanus erected throughout the city,<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a><a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a> and Sejanus became more and more visible as Tiberius began to withdraw from Rome altogether. Finally, with Tiberius's withdrawal in <a href="26" title="wikilink">AD 26</a>, Sejanus was left in charge of the entire state mechanism and the city of Rome.</p>
<p>Sejanus's position was not quite that of successor; he had requested marriage in <a href="25" title="wikilink">AD 25</a> to Tiberius's niece, <a href="Livilla" class="uri" title="wikilink">Livilla</a>,<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a> though under pressure quickly withdrew the request.<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a> While Sejanus's Praetorians controlled the imperial post, and therefore the information that Tiberius received from Rome and the information Rome received from Tiberius,<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a> the presence of <a href="Livia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Livia</a> seems to have checked his overt power for a time. Her death in <a href="29" title="wikilink">AD 29</a> changed all that.<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a> Sejanus began a series of purge trials of Senators and wealthy equestrians in the city of Rome, removing those capable of opposing his power as well as extending the imperial (and his own) treasury. Germanicus's widow and two of her sons were arrested and exiled in <a href="30" title="wikilink">AD 30</a> and later all died in suspicious circumstances.<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a></p>

Precisely what happened is difficult to determine, but Sejanus seems to have covertly attempted to court those families who were tied to the Julians, and attempted to ingratiate himself with the Julian family line with an eye towards placing himself, as an adopted Julian, in the position of Princeps, or as a possible regent.<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a> <a href="Livilla" class="uri" title="wikilink">Livilla</a> was later implicated in this plot, and was revealed to have been Sejanus's lover for a number of years.<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a> The plot seems to have involved the two of them overthrowing Tiberius, with the support of the Julians, and either assuming the <a href="Principate" class="uri" title="wikilink">Principate</a> themselves, or serving as regent to the young <a href="Tiberius_Gemellus" title="wikilink">Tiberius Gemellus</a> or possibly even <a href="Gaius_Caligula" title="wikilink">Gaius Caligula</a>. Those who stood in his way were tried for treason and swiftly dealt with.</p>
<p>However, what is clear from the record is that when Sejanus finally did fall, the purges that ensued under Tiberius were almost all aimed at supporters of the Julians. In <a href="32" title="wikilink">AD 32</a> Sejanus was summoned to a meeting of the Senate, where a letter from Tiberius was read condemning Sejanus and ordering his immediate execution. Sejanus was tried, and he and several of his colleagues were executed within the week.<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a></p>
<p>Rome then erupted into even more extensive trials. Whereas Tiberius had been hesitant to act at the outset of his reign, now, towards the end of his life, he seemed to do so without compunction. The Senatorial ranks were decimated. Hardest hit were those families with political ties to the Julians. Even the imperial magistracy was hit, as any and all who had associated with Sejanus or could in some way be tied to his schemes were summarily tried and executed, their properties seized by the state.<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a> As Tacitus vividly describes,</p>
<dl>

<dd><em>Executions were now a stimulus to his fury, and he ordered the death of all who were lying in prison under accusation of complicity with Sejanus. There lay, singly or in heaps, the unnumbered dead, of every age and sex, the illustrious with the obscure. Kinsfolk and friends were not allowed to be near them, to weep over them, or even to gaze on them too long. Spies were set round them, who noted the sorrow of each mourner and followed the rotting corpses, till they were dragged to the Tiber, where, floating or driven on the bank, no one dared to burn or to touch them. The force of terror had utterly extinguished the sense of human fellowship, and, with the growth of cruelty, pity was thrust aside.</em><a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Meanwhile, with Tiberius in Capri, rumors abounded as to what exactly he was doing there. Suetonius records livid tales of sexual perversity and cruelty, of <a href="sado-masochism" class="uri" title="wikilink">sado-masochism</a> and <a href="pederasty" class="uri" title="wikilink">pederasty</a>, and most of all his paranoia.<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a> While perhaps sensationalized, the stories at least paint a picture of how Tiberius was perceived by the Roman people, and what his impact on the Principate was during his 23 years of rule.</p>
<h3 id="final-years">Final years</h3>
<p><img src="JPaul_Laurens_The_Death_of_Tiberius.jpg" title="fig:The Death of Tiberius by Jean-Paul Laurens, depicting the Roman emperor about to be smothered under orders of Naevius Sutorius Macro." alt="The Death of Tiberius by Jean-Paul Laurens, depicting the Roman emperor about to be smothered under orders of Naevius Sutorius Macro." width="250" /> The affair with Sejanus and the final years of treason trials permanently damaged Tiberius' image and <a href="reputation" class="uri" title="wikilink">reputation</a>. After Sejanus's fall, Tiberius's withdrawal from Rome was complete; the empire continued to run under the inertia of the <a href="bureaucracy" class="uri" title="wikilink">bureaucracy</a> established by Augustus, rather than through the leadership of the Princeps. He became utterly <a href="paranoia" title="wikilink">paranoid</a>,<a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a> and reportedly spent a great deal of time brooding over the death of his son. Meanwhile, Suetonius records a short invasion by Parthia and incursions by tribes from <a href="Dacia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Dacia</a> and from across the Rhine by several Germanic tribes.<a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a></p>
<p>Nothing was done to either secure or indicate how his succession was to take place; the Julians and their supporters felt his full wrath, his own sons and immediate family were dead. There seemed to be a vague nod to Gaius &quot;<a href="Caligula" class="uri" title="wikilink">Caligula</a>&quot;, the sole surviving son of Germanicus, as well as his own grandson <a href="Tiberius_Gemellus" title="wikilink">Tiberius Gemellus</a>,<a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a> but nothing certain, and there was only a half-hearted attempt at the end of his life to make Gaius an honorary <a href="quaestor" class="uri" title="wikilink">quaestor</a>.<a href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a></p>
<p>Tiberius died in <a href="Misenum" class="uri" title="wikilink">Misenum</a> on March 16, AD 37, at the age of 77.<a href="#fn67" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a> Tacitus records that upon the news of his death the crowd rejoiced, only to become suddenly silent upon hearing that he had recovered, and rejoiced again at the news that <a href="Caligula" class="uri" title="wikilink">Caligula</a> had smothered him.<a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a> This is not recorded by other ancient historians and is most likely apocryphal, but it can be taken as an indication of how the senatorial class felt towards the Emperor at the time of his death. In his will, Tiberius had left his powers jointly to Caligula and Tiberius Gemellus<a href="#fn69" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref69"><sup>69</sup></a><a href="#fn70" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a>; Caligula's first act on becoming Princeps was to void Tiberius' will and have Gemellus executed.<a href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a></p>
<p>Tiberius&lt;U+2019&gt;s downfall was not his abuse of power but his refusal to use it. His withdrawn nature, especially in comparison with Augustus's openness, immediately made him a disliked figure. The Senate had been functioning under the directorship of the Principate for almost 50 years; most Senators had gained their position and hoped to advance further by courting Imperial favor. Tiberius's attempt to restore some share of administration to the Senate thus met with failure; the Senate no longer knew how to rule independent of the Princeps. Tiberius seemed uninterested in the role set for him to play, and his rule and his reputation suffered. The administration of the Imperial sector of the government increased during this time, but how much this is due to direct action by Tiberius rather than his freedmen advisors cannot be determined. In the end, Tiberius perhaps is a model of how power can be abused by its lack of use.</p>
<h2 id="legacy">Legacy</h2>
<p><img src="005_Tiberius.jpg" title="fig:The tribute penny mentioned in the Bible is commonly believed to be a Roman denarius depicting Tiberius." alt="The tribute penny mentioned in the Bible is commonly believed to be a Roman denarius depicting Tiberius." width="150" /> It is difficult not to feel conflicted about Tiberius. Were he to have died prior to AD 23, he might have been hailed as an exemplary ruler. Despite the overwhelmingly negative characterization left by Roman historians, Tiberius left the imperial treasury 20 times richer than when he inherited it. Rather than embark on costly campaigns of conquest, he chose to strengthen the existing empire by building additional bases, using diplomacy as well as military threats, and generally refraining from getting drawn into petty squabbles between competing frontier tyrants. The result was a stronger, more consolidated empire.</p>
<p>The <a href="Gospel" title="wikilink">Gospels</a> record that during Tiberius' reign, <a href="Jesus_of_Nazareth" title="wikilink">Jesus of Nazareth</a> preached and was executed under the authority of <a href="Pontius_Pilate" title="wikilink">Pontius Pilate</a>, the Roman governor of <a href="Judea" class="uri" title="wikilink">Judea</a>. In the <a href="Bible" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bible</a>, Tiberius is mentioned by name only once, in <a href="Gospel_of_Luke" title="wikilink">Luke</a> 3:1, stating that <a href="John_the_Baptist" title="wikilink">John the Baptist</a> entered on his public ministry in the fifteenth year of his reign. Many references to <em>Caesar</em> (or <em>the emperor</em> in some other translations), without further specification, actually refer to Tiberius.</p>
<p>Similarly, the &quot;<a href="Render_unto_Caesar..." title="wikilink">Tribute Penny</a>&quot; referred to in  and Mark 12:15 is popularly thought to be a <a href="silver" class="uri" title="wikilink">silver</a> <a href="denarius" class="uri" title="wikilink">denarius</a> coin of Tiberius.</p>
<p>The town <a href="Tiberias" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tiberias</a> on the western shore of the <a href="Sea_of_Galilee" title="wikilink">Sea of Galilee</a> was named in Tiberius's honour by <a href="Herod_Antipas" title="wikilink">Herod Antipas</a>.</p>
<h2 id="tiberius-in-fiction">Tiberius in fiction</h2>

<p>Tiberius has been represented several times in fiction, both in literature and in film and television, though often as a peripheral character in the central storyline. The most widely known modern representation is in the novel <em><a href="I,_Claudius" title="wikilink">I, Claudius</a></em> by <a href="Robert_Graves" title="wikilink">Robert Graves</a>, and the consequent <a href="BBC" class="uri" title="wikilink">BBC</a> <a href="I,_Claudius_(TV_series)" title="wikilink">television series</a> adaptation, where he is portrayed by <a href="George_Baker" title="wikilink">George Baker</a>. In addition, Tiberius has prominent roles in <em><a href="Ben-Hur" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ben-Hur</a></em> (played by <a href="George_Relph" title="wikilink">George Relph</a> in his last starring role), and <em><a href="Caligula_(film)" title="wikilink">Caligula</a></em> (played by <a href="Peter_O&#39;Toole" title="wikilink">Peter O'Toole</a>).</p>
