<p>The <strong>Pony Express</strong> was a fast <a href="mail" class="uri" title="wikilink">mail</a> service crossing the <a href="Great_Plains" title="wikilink">Great Plains</a> and the <a href="Rocky_Mountains" title="wikilink">Rocky Mountains</a> from <a href="St._Joseph,_Missouri" title="wikilink">St. Joseph, Missouri</a>, to <a href="Sacramento,_California" title="wikilink">Sacramento, California</a>, from April 1860 to October 1861. It became the west's most direct means of east-west communication before the <a href="First_Transcontinental_Telegraph" title="wikilink">telegraph</a> and was vital for tying <a href="California" class="uri" title="wikilink">California</a> closely with <a href="Union_(American_Civil_War)" title="wikilink">the Union</a> just before the <a href="American_Civil_War" title="wikilink">American Civil War</a>.</p>
<p>The Pony Express was a mail delivery system of the Leavenworth &amp; Pike's Peak Express Company of 1849 which in 1850 became the <a href="Central_Overland_California_and_Pikes_Peak_Express_Company" title="wikilink">Central Overland California and Pikes Peak Express Company</a>. This firm was founded by <a href="William_Hepburn_Russell" title="wikilink">William H. Russell</a>, <a href="Alexander_Majors" title="wikilink">Alexander Majors</a>, and <a href="William_B._Waddell_(Pony_Express_founder)" title="wikilink">William B. Waddell</a>.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>Built in 1858 as a luxury hotel, <a href="Patee_House" title="wikilink">Patee House</a> when it opened that year was one of the finest hotels west of the Mississippi. It served as the Pony Express headquarters from 1860 to 1861. It is one block away from the home of infamous outlaw <a href="Jesse_James" title="wikilink">Jesse James</a>, where he was shot and killed by Robert Ford. After his murder, Jesse James' family took up lodging at this hotel and were interviewed by newspapermen of the time during their stay there.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>This original fast mail 'Pony Express' service had messages <a href="mail_delivery_by_animal" title="wikilink">carried by horseback riders</a> in relays to stations across the prairies, plains, deserts, and mountains of the <a href="Western_United_States" title="wikilink">Western United States</a>. For its 18 months of operation, it briefly reduced the time for messages to travel between the <a href="Atlantic_Ocean" title="wikilink">Atlantic</a> and <a href="Pacific_Ocean" title="wikilink">Pacific</a> coasts to about ten days, with telegraphic communication covering about half the distance across the continent and mounted couriers the rest.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="founders-of-the-pony-express">Founders of the Pony Express</h2>
<p>William Russell, Alexander Majors and William Waddell, the three founders of the Pony Express, were already in the freighting business with more than 4,000 men, 3,500 wagons and some 40,000 oxen in 1858. They held government contracts for delivering army supplies to the West frontier, and Russell had a similar idea for contracts with the US Government for fast mail delivery.</p>
<p>By having a short route and using mounted riders rather than traditional stagecoaches, their proposal was to establish a fast mail service between St. Joseph, Missouri, and Sacramento, California with letters delivered in 10 days, a duration many said was impossible. It was not exactly overnight, but perhaps overpriced for the time, at $5 a half-ounce. The founders of the Pony Express hoped to win an exclusive government mail contract, something that did not come about.</p>
<p>Russell, Majors and Waddell organized and put together the Pony Express in just two months in the winter of 1860. It was an undertaking of enormous proportions, with 120 riders, 184 stations, 400 horses and several hundred of personnel, all during January and February 1860.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>

<p>]] Alexander Majors was a religious man and resolved &quot;by the help of God&quot; to overcome all difficulties. He presented each rider with a Bible and required this oath:</p>
<p><span style="font-size:10pt">  </span></font></p>
<p>Pony Express demonstrated that a unified transcontinental system could be built and operated continuously year round. Since its replacement by the telegraph, the Pony Express has become part of the lore of the <a href="American_Old_West" title="wikilink">American West</a>. Its reliance on the ability and endurance of individual riders and horses over technological innovation was part of the American rugged individualism of the <a href="Frontier_Thesis" title="wikilink">Frontier</a> times.</p>
<p>From 1866 until 1890, the Pony Express logo was used by <a href="Wells_Fargo" title="wikilink">Wells Fargo</a>, which provided secure mail and freight services. The <a href="United_States_Postal_Service" title="wikilink">United States Postal Service</a> (USPS) used &quot;Pony Express&quot; as a trademark for postal services in the US.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> <a href="Freight_Link" title="wikilink">Freight Link</a> international <a href="Courier" title="wikilink">courier services</a>, based in <a href="Russia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Russia</a>, adopted the Pony Express trademark and a logo similar to that of the USPS <a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a>.</p>

<p>A total of about 157 Pony Express stations were placed at intervals of about 10 miles (16 km) along the approximately  route.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> This was roughly the maximum distance a horse could travel at full gallop. The rider changed to a fresh horse at each station, taking only the mail pouch called a <em>mochila</em> (from the <a href="Spanish_Language" title="wikilink">Spanish</a> for pouch or backpack) with him. The employers stressed the importance of the pouch. They often said that, if it came to be, the horse and rider should perish before the mochila did. The <em>mochila</em> was thrown over the saddle and held in place by the weight of the rider sitting on it. Each corner had a <em>cantina</em>, or pocket. Bundles of mail were placed in these <em>cantinas</em>, which were padlocked for safety. The <em>mochila</em> could hold 20 pounds (10 kg) of mail along with the 20 pounds of material carried on the horse. Included in that 20 pounds were a water sack, a Bible, a horn for alerting the relay station master to prepare the next horse, a revolver, and a choice of a rifle or another revolver. Eventually, everything except one revolver and a water sack was removed, allowing for a total of 165 pounds (75 kg) on the horse's back. Riders, who could not weigh over 125 pounds, changed about every 75&lt;U+2013&gt;100 miles (120&lt;U+2013&gt;160 km), and rode day and night. In emergencies, a given rider might ride two stages back to back, over 20 hours on a galloping horse.</p>
<p>It is unknown if riders tried crossing the <a href="Sierra_Nevada_(U.S.)" title="wikilink">Sierra Nevada</a> in winter, but they certainly crossed central Nevada. By 1860 there was a telegraph station in <a href="Carson_City,_Nevada" title="wikilink">Carson City</a>, <a href="Nevada" class="uri" title="wikilink">Nevada</a>. The riders received $25 per week as pay. A comparable wage for unskilled labor at the time was about $1 per week.</p>
<p>Alexander Majors, one of the founders of the Pony Express, had acquired more than 400 horses for the project. These averaged about 14&lt;U+00BD&gt; hands (1.47 m) high and averaged 900 pounds (410 kg)<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> each; thus, the name <a href="pony" class="uri" title="wikilink">pony</a> was appropriate, even if not strictly correct in all cases.</p>
<h2 id="pony-express-stations">Pony Express Stations</h2>
<p>Along the route used by the Pony Express there were 184 stations. The route was divided up into five Divisions:<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> To maintain the rigid schedule, 157 relay stations were located from 5 to 20 miles apart. At each Swing Station riders would exchange their tired mounts for fresh ones, while Home Stations housed the riders between runs. This technique allowed the mail to be whisked across the continent in record time. Each rider rode about 75 miles per day.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>

<p><strong>The first Westbound Pony Express</strong> trip left St. Joseph on April 3, 1860 and arrived ten days later in San Francisco, California on April 14. These letters were sent under cover from the East to St. Joseph, and never directly entered the U.S. mail system. To this day there is only a single letter known to exist from the inaugural westbound trip from St. Joseph, Missouri to San Francisco, California.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> The mailing depicted below is on a pre-stamped (embossed) envelope, first issued by the U.S. Post Office in 1855, used five years later here.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>

<p><img src="Pony_Express_stamp2-1$.jpg" title="fig:Pony Express Stamp, 1860" alt="Pony Express Stamp, 1860" width="180" /> <a href="image:Pomy_Express_compound_oval.jpg" title="wikilink">thumb|right|180px|Pony Express compound oval Postmark, one of many types found on the covers of Pony Express mail.</a> As the Pony Express Mail service existed briefly in 1860 and 1861 there are consequently very few examples of surviving Pony Express mail today. Also contributing to the scarcity of surviving Pony Express mail was the fact that the cost to send a 1/2 ounce letter was $5.00 at the beginning, a costly sum in those days and mostly unaffordable to the general public. By the end period of the Pony Express, the price had dropped to $1.00 per 1/2 ounce. Even the $1.00 rate was considered a lot of money (about $85) just to mail one letter in those days. As this mail service was also a frontier enterprise, removed from the general population back east, along with the largely unaffordable rates, there are consequently few pieces of surviving Pony Express mail in the hands of collectors and museums today. Presently there are only 250 known examples of Pony Express mail.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>

<p>In 1860 senior partner of 'Russell, Majors, and Waddell.', William Russell, one of the biggest investors in the Pony Express, used the 1860 presidential election as a way to promote the Pony Express and how fast it could deliver the U.S. Mail. Assuring that there would be fresh riders and horses along the entire Pony Express route, Russell, prior to the election, hired extra riders and ensured that fresh relay horses were available along the route. On November 7, 1860, a Pony Express rider departed <a href="Fort_Kearny" title="wikilink">Fort Kearny</a>, Nebraska Territory (the eastern end of the telegraph line) with the election results. Riders sped along the route, over snow-covered trails and into Fort Churchill, Nevada Territory (the western end of the telegraph line). California&lt;U+2019&gt;s newspapers received word of Lincoln&lt;U+2019&gt;s election only seven days and 17 hours after the East Coast papers, an unrivaled feat at the time.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a></p>

<p>The Paiute War was a minor series of raids and ambushes initiated by the <a href="Paiute" class="uri" title="wikilink">Paiute</a> Indian tribe in Nevada and which resulted in the disruption of mail services of the Pony Express. It took place from May through June 1860, though sporadic violence continued for a period afterward. In the brief history that the Pony Express operated only once did the mail not go through. After completing eight weekly trips from both Sacramento and Saint Joseph, the Pony Express was forced to suspend mail services because of the outbreak of the <a href="Paiute" class="uri" title="wikilink">Paiute</a> Indian War in May 1860.</p>
<p>Approximately 6,000 Paiutes in Nevada had suffered during a winter of fierce blizzards that year. By spring, the whole tribe was ready to embark on a war, except for the Paiute chief named Numaga. For three days Numaga fasted and argued for peace. However, on May 7 a few Indians raided the Williams Pony Express Station anyway, killing five men.</p>
<p>During the following weeks, other isolated incidents occurred when whites in Paiute country were ambushed and killed. The Pony Express was a special target. Seven other express stations were also attacked; some 16 employees were killed and approximately 150 express horses were either stolen or driven off. The Paiute war cost the Pony Express company about $75,000 in livestock and station equipment, not to mention the loss of life. In June of that year, the Paiute uprising had been ended through the intervention of U.S. government troops, after which four delayed mail shipments from the East were finally brought to San Francisco on June 25, 1860.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a><a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a></p>
<p>During this brief war, one Pony Express mailing, which left San Francisco on July 21, 1860 did not immediately reach its destination; the mail pouch (Mochila) did not arrive in St. Joseph and then on to New York until almost two years later.</p>

<p><img src="Pony_ExpressAdvert.jpg" title="fig:Pony Express &#39;Riders Wanted&#39; poster" alt="Pony Express &#39;Riders Wanted&#39; poster" width="175" /> Back in 1860, riding for the Pony Express was difficult work &lt;U+2013&gt; riders had to be tough and lightweight. There is a famous advertisement that reportedly read, &quot;Wanted: Young, skinny, wiry fellows not over eighteen. Must be expert riders, willing to risk death daily. Orphans preferred.&quot; <a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a></p>
<p>The Pony Express had an estimated 80 riders that were in use at any one given time. In addition, there were also about 400 other employees including station keepers, stock tenders and route superintendents. Many young men applied for jobs with the Pony Express, all eager to face the dangers and the challenges that sometimes lay along the delivery route. Famous American author <a href="Mark_Twain" title="wikilink">Mark Twain</a>, who saw the Pony Express in action first hand, described the riders as: &quot;... usually a little bit of a man&quot;. Though the riders were small, lightweight, generally teenage boys, their untarnished record proved them to be heros of the American West for the much needed and dangerous service they provided for the nation.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a></p>
<p>A list of riders has been compiled by the staff of the St. Joseph Museum from various sources, including accounts from people who knew riders, relatives of riders and newspapers.

<p><strong>The first westbound rider</strong> to depart St. Joseph has been disputed but at this late date most historians have boiled it down to either <a href="Johnny_Fry" title="wikilink">Johnny Fry</a> or Billy Richardson <a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> <a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> <a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a><a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> also known as <a href="Johnson_William_Richardson" title="wikilink">Johnson William Richardson</a>. Both Expressmen were hired at St. Joseph for A. E. Lewis' Division which ran from St. Joseph to Seneca, Kansas, a distance of eighty miles. They covered at an average speed of twelve and a half miles per hour, including all stops.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> Before the mail pouch was delivered to the first rider, time was taken out for ceremonies and several speeches. First, Mayor M. Jeff Thompson gave a brief speech on the significance of the event for St. Joseph. Then William H. Russell and Alexander Majors addressed the gala crowd about how the Pony Express was just a &quot;precursor&quot; to the construction of a transcontinental railroad. At the conclusion of all the speeches, approximately 7:15 p.m., Russell turned the mail pouch over to the first rider. A cannon fired, the large assembled crowd cheered, and the rider dashed to the landing at the &quot;foot of Jules Street where the ferry boat Denver, alerted by the signal cannon, waited to carry the horse and rider across the Missouri River to Elwood, Kansas Territory.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> On April 9 at 6:45 p.m., the first rider from the east reached Salt Lake City, Utah. Then, on April 12, the mail pouch reached Carson City, Nevada at 2:30 p.m. The riders raced over the Sierra Nevada Mountains, through Placerville, California and on to Sacramento. Around midnight on April 14, 1860, the first mail pouch was delivered via the Pony Express to San Francisco.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a></p>
<p>James Randall is credited as <strong>the first eastbound rider</strong> from the San Francisco Alta telegraph office since he was on the steamship <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Steamer_antelope.jpg">Antelope</a> to go to Sacramento.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> Mail for the Pony Express left San Francisco at 4:00 pm, carried by horse and rider to the waterfront, and then on by steamboat to Sacramento where it was picked up by the Pony Express rider. At 2:45 a.m., William (Sam) Hamilton was the first Pony Express rider to begin the journey from Sacramento. He rode all the way to Sportsman Hall Station where he gave his mochila filled with mail to Warren Upson.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> A California Registered Historical Landmark's plaque at the site reads: <span style="font-size:10pt">  </span></font></p>
<h3 id="william-cody">William Cody</h3>
<p><img src="Buffalo_Bill_Cody_ca1875.jpg" title="fig:William Cody, aka Buffalo Bill" alt="William Cody, aka Buffalo Bill" width="140" /> Probably more than any other rider in the Pony Express, William Cody, better known as <a href="Buffalo_Bill" title="wikilink">Buffalo Bill</a> epitomizes the legend and the folk lore of the Pony Express. Numerous stories have been told of young Cody's adventures as a Pony Express rider. When Cody was only 15 years old he was employed as a rider and was given a short 45-mile delivery run from the township of Julesburg which lay to the west. After some months he was transferred to Slade's Division in Wyoming where he made the longest non-stop ride from Red Buttes Station to Rocky Ridge Station and back when he found that his relief rider had been killed. The distance of 322 miles over one of the most dangerous sections of the entire trail was completed in 21 hours and 40 minutes. It took a total of 21 horses to complete this run.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> Cody was present for every significant chapter in young western history, including the gold rush, the building of the railroads, and cattle herding on the Great Plains&lt;U+2014&gt;and found himself playing a part in nearly every one of these crucial stages of development. A career as a scout during the Civil War earned him his nickname and established his notoriety as a model frontiersman.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="robert-haslam">Robert Haslam</h3>
<p><img src="Haslam.gif" title="fig:&quot;Pony Bob&quot; Haslam in later years" alt="&quot;Pony Bob&quot; Haslam in later years" width="155" /> &quot;Pony Bob&quot; Haslam was among the most brave, resourceful, and best known riders of the Pony Express. He was born January 1840 in London, England, and came to U.S. as a teen. Haslam was hired by Bolivar Roberts, helped build the stations, and was given the mail run from Friday's Station at Lake Tahoe to Buckland&lt;U+2019&gt;s Station near Fort Churchill which was 75 miles to the east. Perhaps his greatest ride, 120 miles in 8 hours and 20 minutes while wounded, was an important contribution to the fastest trip ever made by the Pony Express. The message carried Lincoln's inaugural address. Pony Bob Haslam's ride was the result of the Indian problems in 1860. He had received the eastbound mail (probably the May 10 mail from San Francisco) at Friday's Station. At Buckland's Station his relief rider was so badly frightened over the Indian threat that he refused to take the mail. Haslam agreed to take the mail all the way to Smith's Creek for a total distance of 190 miles without a rest. After a rest of nine hours, he retraced his route with the westbound mail. At Cold Springs he found that Indians had raided the place, killing the station keeper and running off all of the stock. Finally he reached Buckland's Station, making the 380-mile round trip the longest on record.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> On the ride he was shot through the jaw with an Indian arrow, losing three teeth.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="jack-keetley">Jack Keetley</h3>
<p><img src="Jkeetley.jpg" title="fig:Jack Keetley" alt="Jack Keetley" width="165" /> Jack Keetley was hired by A. E. Lewis for his Division at the age of nineteen, and put on the run from Marysville to Big Sandy. He was one of those who rode for the Pony Express during the entire nineteen months of its existence.</p>
<p>Jack Keetley's longest ride, upon which he doubled back for another rider, ended at Seneca where he was taken from the saddle sound asleep. He had ridden 340 miles in thirty-one hours without stopping to rest or eat.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a><a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> After the Pony Express was disbanded, Keetley went to Salt Lake City where he engaged in mining.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1907, Keetley wrote the following letter (excerpt):</p>
<p>Salt Lake City, Utah, August 21, 1907</p>
<p>Mr. Houston Wyeth, St. Joseph, MO. </p>

</figure>
<p>An estimated 400 horses in total were used by the Pony Express to deliver the mail. Horses were selected for swiftness and endurance. On the east end of Pony Express route the horses were usually selected from US Calvary units. At the west end of the pony Express route in California, W.W. Finney purchased 100 head of short coupled stock called &quot;California Horses&quot;' while A.B. Miller purchased another 200 native ponies in and around the Great Salt Lake Valley. The horses were ridden at a fast gallop between stations, an average of 15 miles, and then were relieved and a fresh horse would be exchanged for the one that just arrived from its strenuous run.</p>
<p>During his route of 80 to 100 miles, a Pony Express rider would change horses 8 to 10 times. The horses were ridden at a fast gallop, around 10 to 15 miles per hour and at times they were driven to full gallop at speeds up to 25 miles per hour. Horses of the Pony Express were purchased in Missouri, Iowa, California, and some western U.S. territories.</p>
<p>The various types of horses ridden by riders of the Pony Express included Morgans and thoroughbreds which were often used on the eastern end of the trail. Pintos were often used in the middle section and mustangs were often used on the western (more rugged) end of the mail route. <a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="saddle">Saddle</h2>
<p>In 1844 years before the Pony Express came to <a href="Saint_Joseph,_Missouri" title="wikilink">St. Joseph</a>, Israel Landis opened a small saddle and harness shop there. His business expanded as the town grew, and when the Pony Express came to town Landis was the ideal candidate to produce saddles for the new found Pony Express. Because Pony Express riders rode their horses at a fast gallop over a distance of ten and more miles between stations, every consideration was made to reduce the overall weight the horse had to carry. To help reduce this load, special light weight <a href="saddle" title="wikilink">saddles</a> were designed and crafted. Using less leather and fewer metallic and wood components they fashioned a saddle that was similar in design to the regular stock saddle generally in use in the West at that time. <a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a></p>
<p>The mail pouch was a separate component to the saddle that made the Pony Express unique. Standard mail pouches for horses were never employed because of their size and shape, as it would be time consuming to attach to the saddle, and would cause undue delay in changing mounts. To get around this difficulty, a mochila, or covering of leather, was thrown over the saddle. The saddle horn and cantle projected through holes which were cut in the mochila. Attached to the broad leather skirt of the mochila were four cantinas, or boxes of hard leather.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="closing">Closing</h2>
<p>Although the Pony Express proved that the central/northern mail route was viable, <a href="Russell,_Majors_and_Waddell" title="wikilink">Russell, Majors and Waddell</a> did not get the contract to deliver mail over the route. The contract was instead awarded to <a href="Jeremy_Dehut" title="wikilink">Jeremy Dehut</a> in March 1861, who had taken over the southern Congressionally favored <a href="Butterfield_Overland_Mail" title="wikilink">Butterfield Overland Mail</a> Stage Line. Holladay took over the Russell, Majors and Waddell stations for his stagecoaches.</p>
<p>Shortly after the contract was awarded, the start of the <a href="American_Civil_War" title="wikilink">American Civil War</a> caused the stage line to cease operation. From March 1861, the Pony Express ran mail only between Salt Lake City and Sacramento. The Pony Express announced its closure on October 26, 1861, two days after the <a href="First_Transcontinental_Telegraph" title="wikilink">transcontinental telegraph</a> reached Salt Lake City and connected <a href="Omaha,_Nebraska" title="wikilink">Omaha, Nebraska</a> and <a href="Sacramento,_California" title="wikilink">Sacramento, California</a>.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a> Other telegraph lines connected points along the line and other cities on the east and west coasts.</p>
<p>The Pony Express had grossed $90,000 and lost $200,000.<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a> In 1866, after the American Civil War was over, Holladay sold the Pony Express assets along with the remnants of the <a href="Butterfield_Stage" title="wikilink">Butterfield Stage</a> to <a href="Wells_Fargo" title="wikilink">Wells Fargo</a> for $1.5 million.</p>

Envelope also has an issue of 1855, Washington-10c postage affixed to it." /> The foundation of accountable Pony Express history rests in the few tangible areas where records, papers, letters and mailings have yielded the most historical evidence. Up until the 1950s most of what was known about the short lived Pony Express was the product of a few accounts, hearsay and folk Lore, generally true in their overall aspects, but lacking in verification in many areas for those who wanted to explore the history surrounding the founders, the various riders and station keepers or who were interested in stations or Forts along the Pony Express route itself.</p>
<p>The most complete books on the Pony Express are <strong>The Story of the Pony Express</strong> and <strong>Saddles and Spurs</strong> by Raymond &amp; Mary Settle and Roy Bloss. Settle's account is unique as he was the first writer and historical researcher to make use of the <a href="William_B._Waddell_(Pony_Express_founder)" title="wikilink">William B. Waddell</a>'s papers, now a collection at the Huntington Library in San Marino, California. (Waddell was one of the founders of the Pony Express) Mr. Settle wrote in the middle 1950's. Mr. Bloss was a writer for the Pony Express Centennial. While Settle's work was published generally without his annotations and notes the writer's background here is unique and Settle does have an excellent bibliography. When Settle prepared to publish his well researched account he indeed had a good volume of footnotes, citations all prepared, but the editors chose not to use most of them. Instead they opted for a less expensive approach to print and publish and released an accurate but more simplified account. Settle was not pleased with this new and sudden development as he put much time and effort into the annotations. Yet the account Settle wrote was and is a definitive one and is considered the best account on the history of the Pony Express amongst many historians. <a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a><a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a></p>
