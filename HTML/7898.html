<h2 id="plot">Plot</h2>
<p>When <a href="Marge_Simpson" title="wikilink">Marge</a> catches <a href="Bart_Simpson" title="wikilink">Bart</a> vandalizing a town sidewalk by writing his name in wet cement, she lectures him on the importance of town pride. Afterwards, Bart realizes how wonderful it is living in <a href="Springfield_(The_Simpsons)" title="wikilink">Springfield</a>. Consequently, however, Bart also becomes upset with anti-Springfield sentiments coming from the neighboring town of <a href="Shelbyville_(The_Simpsons)" title="wikilink">Shelbyville</a>. <a href="Abraham_Simpson" title="wikilink">Grampa</a> explains that this rivalry can be traced back to the establishment of the two towns. This occurred when the founders <a href="List_of_recurring_characters_in_The_Simpsons#Jebediah_Springfield" title="wikilink">Jebediah Springfield</a> and Shelbyville Manhattan discovered they had irreconcilable differences regarding their visions for a perfect town, Springfield favoring promotion of <a href="chastity" class="uri" title="wikilink">chastity</a> and Shelbyville advocating <a href="incest" title="wikilink">incestuous</a> marriages between <a href="cousin_couple" title="wikilink">cousins</a>.</p>
<p>The next day, Springfield's lemon tree is stolen by a couple of boys from Shelbyville. Taking his town pride to heart and swearing to keep it, Bart leads <a href="Milhouse_Van_Houten" title="wikilink">Milhouse</a>, <a href="Nelson_Muntz" title="wikilink">Nelson</a>, <a href="Martin_Prince" title="wikilink">Martin</a>, <a href="Flanders_family#Todd" title="wikilink">Todd</a>, and <a href="List_of_recurring_characters_in_The_Simpsons#Database" title="wikilink">Database</a> into Shelbyville to search for the tree and bring it back to Springfield. The group splits up and has a few misadventures. Bart goes undercover and infiltrates the children of Shelbyville by disguising himself. However, he is unable to obtain any information. Eventually, the Springfield children track down the tree to an impound lot (where one of the boys that stole the tree lives).</p>
<p>Back in Springfield, <a href="Homer_Simpson" title="wikilink">Homer</a>, using <a href="Ned_Flanders" title="wikilink">Ned Flanders</a>' RV, leads the fathers to find the boys. When the two groups meet, the boys tell their fathers of the tree being stolen and that they're trying to recover it. Shocked by this, the fathers head over to the impound lot and demand the return of the tree, but the owner of the impound lot refuses and taunts them of their town heritage. Using a plan similar to the <a href="Trojan_Horse" title="wikilink">Trojan Horse</a>, Bart steers the RV to the outside of the hospital. The RV is taken to the impound lot after it is found parked outside the hospital. When night falls, the Springfieldian boys and their fathers get out of the RV and tie the tree to the top. They are caught in the middle of this act by the owner but manage to escape. The tree, though considerably damaged during the escape, is returned to Springfield. The children of Springfield celebrate with lemonade, while those in Shelbyville drink <a href="turnip" class="uri" title="wikilink">turnip</a> juice, much to their disgust.</p>

<p>The writers wanted to have the Springfield children find an area of Springfield that was not decimated, and the animators designed a version of Springfield that was very idyllic.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> They drew several scenes of the children running through non-polluted streams and woodlands.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> The animators gave Shelbyville's nature a more dark feeling in comparison to Springfield.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="cultural-references">Cultural references</h2>
<p>In the episode, Milhouse recites a slightly paraphrased line from <a href="Prince_(musician)" title="wikilink">Prince</a>'s 1984 song &quot;<a href="When_Doves_Cry" title="wikilink">When Doves Cry</a>&quot;.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> Bart identifies the number seven in <a href="Roman_numerals" title="wikilink">Roman numerals</a> by referring to a nonexistent <a href="sequel" class="uri" title="wikilink">sequel</a> of the <a href="Rocky_(film_series)" title="wikilink">Rocky series</a>, <em>Rocky VII: Adrian's Revenge</em>.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> The scene with Bart and his team sitting on a hill above the enemy camp and looking down at the captured tree being circled by children on bicycles bears a resemblance to an early scene in <em><a href="Mad_Max_2" title="wikilink">Mad Max 2</a></em>.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>

The title of the episode is a play on her name. The method of recovery of the tree is an echo of the <a href="Trojan_Horse" title="wikilink">Trojan Horse</a> (a fact lost on Homer, who gleefully exclaims that &quot;no one in history has ever done anything <em>this</em> clever&quot;).<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a>. At the beginning of the episode, as Marge endeavors to lecture Bart on vandalizing a sidewalk and seeks Homer's help, Homer makes a reference to Humphrey Bogart vandalizing &quot;That sidewalk in Hollywood&quot;.</p>
