<p><strong>Johann Georg Anton Geuther</strong> (23 April 1833 &lt;U+2013&gt; 23 August 1889) was a German <a href="chemist" class="uri" title="wikilink">chemist</a>. His work in organic and inorganic chemistry influenced the development of <a href="Coordination_complex" title="wikilink">coordination chemistry</a>. Geuther spent most of his academic career at the <a href="University_of_Jena" title="wikilink">University of Jena</a> where he discovered <a href="ethyl_acetoacetate" title="wikilink">ethyl acetoacetate</a>, a key compound for chemical synthesis and for the discovery of <a href="tautomerism" class="uri" title="wikilink">tautomerism</a>.</p>
<h2 id="life">Life</h2>
<p>Geuther was born in <a href="Neustadt_bei_Coburg" title="wikilink">Neustadt bei Coburg</a> and was educated in Neustad, <a href="Coburg" class="uri" title="wikilink">Coburg</a> and <a href="Saalfeld" class="uri" title="wikilink">Saalfeld</a>. Although his family favoured education in the merchant business, he started to study chemistry at the University of Jena, but changed to the <a href="University_of_G&lt;U+00F6&gt;ttingen" title="wikilink">University of G&lt;U+00F6&gt;ttingen</a> in 1853. He received his PhD in 1855 for a work on <a href="oil_shale" title="wikilink">oil shale</a> carried out together with <a href="Friedrich_W&lt;U+00F6&gt;hler" title="wikilink">Friedrich W&lt;U+00F6&gt;hler</a>. In the following years, he gradually improved his position in G&lt;U+00F6&gt;tting and became professor in the <a href="University_of_Jena" title="wikilink">University of Jena</a> in 1860. In 1883 he married and lived until his death with his wife, son and daughter in Jena. Geuther died of <a href="typhus" class="uri" title="wikilink">typhus</a> in 1889 at the age of 57.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a><a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="work">Work</h2>
<p>Geuther started to work on inorganic topics, such as the electrolysis of <a href="chromic_acid" title="wikilink">chromic acid</a> and <a href="sulfuric_acid" title="wikilink">sulfuric acid</a> to determine the similarities of the two compounds. His research on the constitution of several cobalt <a href="amine" class="uri" title="wikilink">amine</a> complexes, such as <a href="hexamminecobalt(III)_chloride" title="wikilink">hexamminecobalt(III) chloride</a>, were later completed by <a href="Alfred_Werner" title="wikilink">Alfred Werner</a> earning Werner a <a href="Nobel_Prize_in_Chemistry" title="wikilink">Nobel Prize in Chemistry</a>. Some of his organic research was connected to <a href="isomer" title="wikilink">isomerism</a> of chemical molecules. The experimental work on the <a href="hydrolysis" class="uri" title="wikilink">hydrolysis</a> of <a href="1,1-dichloroethane" class="uri" title="wikilink">1,1-dichloroethane</a>, which yielded <a href="glycol" class="uri" title="wikilink">glycol</a>, and the chlorination of <a href="acetaldehyde" class="uri" title="wikilink">acetaldehyde</a> giving <a href="1,2-dichloroethane" class="uri" title="wikilink">1,2-dichloroethane</a> provided a good starting point for the development of the theory of the constitution of compounds with the same chemical formula, but different bond structure.</p>

<p>Geuther is best known for his discovery of <a href="ethyl_acetoacetate" title="wikilink">ethyl acetoacetate</a>. Although he discovered the compound in 1863, it took him two years to publish results in a peer reviewed journal. The experimental work of his and others yielded puzzling results and induced debates on the nature of ethyl acetoacetate. The structure proposed by <a href="Edward_Frankland" title="wikilink">Edward Frankland</a> and Duppa showed a <a href="keto_group" title="wikilink">keto group</a> (C=O), while Geuther was certain about presence of an acidic OH group in the molecule. It was long after the death of Geuther when <a href="Ludwig_Knorr" title="wikilink">Ludwig Knorr</a>, Geuthers successor at the <a href="University_of_Jena" title="wikilink">University of Jena</a>, solved the riddle proving both sides right: the true nature of ethyl acetoacetate was a <a href="Tautomer" title="wikilink">tautomeric equilibrium</a> between the both suggested structures. The <a href="Keto-enol_tautomerism" title="wikilink">Keto-enol tautomerism</a> strongly depends on the solvent used for the experiments. Geuther was planning to build a new chemical laboratory at University of Jena, but died well before the construction had started. Some of his unfinished work was completed by his successor in Jena <a href="Ludwig_Knorr" title="wikilink">Ludwig Knorr</a>.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a><a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
