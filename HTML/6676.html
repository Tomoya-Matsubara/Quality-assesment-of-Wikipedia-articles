<p>The <strong><em>Analects</em></strong>, or <strong><em>Lunyu</em></strong> (<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>), also known as the <strong><em>Analects of Confucius</em></strong>, is the collection of sayings and ideas attributed to the Chinese philosopher <a href="Confucius" class="uri" title="wikilink">Confucius</a> and his contemporaries, traditionally believed to have been written by Confucius' followers. It is believed to have been written during the <a href="Warring_States_period" title="wikilink">Warring States period</a> (475 BC - 221 BC), and achieved its final form during the mid-<a href="Han_dynasty" title="wikilink">Han dynasty</a> (206 BC-220 AD). At first considered merely a &quot;commentary&quot; on the <a href="Five_Classics" title="wikilink">Five Classics</a> during the early Han dynasty, the status of the <em>Analects</em> grew as one of the central texts of <a href="Confucianism" class="uri" title="wikilink">Confucianism</a>. Near the end of the <a href="Song_dynasty" title="wikilink">Song dynasty</a> (960-1279) the book was raised to the level of the <a href="Four_Books" title="wikilink">Four Books</a>. The <em>Analects</em> has been one of the most widely read and studied books in China for the last 2,000 years, and continues to have a substantial influence on Chinese and <a href="Eastern_philosophy#East_Asian_philosophies" title="wikilink">East Asian thought and values</a> today.</p>

<h3 id="creation-of-the-text">Creation of the text</h3>
<p><img src="Rongo_Analects_02.jpg" title="fig:A page from the Analects" alt="A page from the Analects" /> <img src="Analects.JPG" title="fig:Analects, by Confucius, from &lt;U+00D6&gt;stasiatiska Museet, Stockholm" alt="Analects, by Confucius, from &lt;U+00D6&gt;stasiatiska Museet, Stockholm" /> The vast majority of scholars specializing in the study of the <em>Analects</em> believe that the text was written and compiled within a century after Confucius' death (d.473 BC), mainly by Confucius' first- and second- generation pupils. According to this traditional account, the work would have been written and completed sometime during the <a href="Warring_States_period" title="wikilink">Warring States period</a> (476 BC-221 AD). Most <em>Analects</em> scholars also believe that, by the early <a href="Han_dynasty" title="wikilink">Han dynasty</a> (206 BC-220 AD) the book was widely known and transmitted throughout China in a mostly complete form. Because no texts dated earlier than about 50 BC have been discovered, and because the <em>Analects</em> was not referred to by name in any existing source before the early Han dynasty, some scholars have proposed dates as late as 140 BC for the text's compilation.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>Regardless of how early the text of <em>Analects</em> existed, the book only achieved its final, complete form during the Han dynasty. According to the Han dynasty scholar <a href="Liu_Xiang_(scholar)" title="wikilink">Liu Xiang</a>, there were two versions of the <em>Analects</em> that existed at the beginning of the Han dynasty: the &quot;<a href="Lu_(state)" title="wikilink">Lu</a> version&quot; and the &quot;<a href="Qi_(state)" title="wikilink">Qi</a> version&quot;. The Lu version contained twenty chapters, and the Qi version contained twenty-two chapters, including two chapters not found in the Lu version. Of the twenty chapters that both versions had in common, the Lu version had more passages. Each version had its own masters, schools, and transmitters.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>In the reign of <a href="Emperor_Jing_of_Han" title="wikilink">Emperor Jing of Han</a> (r. 157-141 BC), a third version (the &quot;old text version&quot;) was discovered hidden in a wall of the home then believed to be Confucius' when the home was in the process of being destroyed by King Gong of Lu (r. 153-128 BC) in order to expand the king's palace. The new version did not contain the two extra chapters found in the Qi version, but it split one chapter found in the Lu and Qi versions in two, so it had twenty-one chapters, and the order of the chapters was different.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> The old text version got its name because it was written in a character system not used since the earlier Warring States period (i.e. before 221 BC), when it was assumed to have been hidden.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> Over a century later, the tutor of the <em>Analects</em> to <a href="Emperor_Cheng_of_Han" title="wikilink">Emperor Cheng of Han</a>, <a href=":zh:&lt;U+5F20&gt;&lt;U+79B9&gt;_(&lt;U+897F&gt;&lt;U+6C49&gt;)" title="wikilink">Zhang Yu</a> (d. 5 BC), synthesized the Lu and Qi versions and produced a composite text of the <em>Analects</em> known as the &quot;Zhang Hou Lun&quot;. This text was recognized by Zhang Yu's contemporaries and by subsequent Han scholars as superior to either individual version, and is the text that is recognized as the <em>Analects</em> today.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> No copies of either the Lu version, the Qi version, or the old text version of the <em>Analects</em> exist today.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p>Before the late twentieth century the oldest existing copy of the <em>Analects</em> known to scholars was found in the &quot;Stone Classics of the Xinping Era&quot;, a copy of the Confucian classics written in stone in the old Eastern Han dynasty capital of <a href="Luoyang" class="uri" title="wikilink">Luoyang</a> around 175 AD. Archaeologists have since discovered two handwritten copies of the <em>Analects</em> that were written around 50 BC, during the Western Han dynasty. They are known as the the &quot;<a href="Dingzhou" class="uri" title="wikilink">Dingzhou</a> <em>Analects</em>&quot;, and the &quot;<a href="Pyongyang" class="uri" title="wikilink">Pyongyang</a> <em>Analects</em>&quot;, after the location of the tombs in which they were found. The Dingzhou <em>Analects</em> was discovered in 1973, but no transcription of its contents was published until 1997. The Pyongyang <em>Analects</em> was discovered in 1992. Academic access to the Pyongyang <em>Analects</em> has been highly restricted, and no academic study on it was published until 2009.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p>The Dingzhou <em>Analects</em> was damaged in a fire shortly after it was entombed in the Han dynasty. It was further damaged in <a href="1976_Tangshan_earthquake" title="wikilink">an earthquake</a> shortly after it was recovered, and the surviving text is just under half the size of the received text of the <em>Analects</em>. Of the sections that survive, the Dingzhou <em>Analects</em> is shorter than the received <em>Analects</em>, implying that the text of the <em>Analects</em> was still in the process of expansion when the Dingzhou <em>Analects</em> was entombed. There was evidence that &quot;additions&quot; may have been made to the manuscript after it had been completed, indicating that the writer may have become aware of at least one other version of the <em>Analects</em> and included &quot;extra&quot; material for the sake of completeness. The content of the Pyongyang <em>Analects</em> is similar to the Dingzhou <em>Analects</em>; but, because of the secrecy and isolationism of the <a href="North_Korea" title="wikilink">North Korean</a> government, only a very cursory study of it has been made available to international scholars, and its contents are not completely known outside of North Korea. Scholars do not agree about whether either the Dingzhou <em>Analects</em> or the Pyongyang <em>Analects</em> represent the Lu version, the Qi version, the old text version, or a different version that was independent of these three traditions.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="importance-within-confucianism">Importance within Confucianism</h3>
<p>During most of the Han period the <em>Analects</em> was not considered one of the pincipal texts of <a href="Confucianism" class="uri" title="wikilink">Confucianism</a>. During the reign of <a href="Han_Wudi" title="wikilink">Han Wudi</a> (141-87 BC), when the Chinese government began promoting Confucian studies, only the <a href="Five_Classics" title="wikilink">Five Classics</a> were considered canonical (<em>jing</em>) by the government. They were considered Confucian because Confucius was assumed to have partially written, edited, and/or transmitted them. The <em>Analects</em>, during Han Wudi's reign, was considered secondary because it was considered only a collection of Confucius' oral &quot;commentary&quot; (<em>zhuan</em>) on the Five Classics.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<p>The political importance and popularity of Confucius and Confucianism grew throughout the Han dynasty, and by the Eastern Han the <em>Analects</em> was widely read by schoolchildren and anyone aspiring to literacy, and was usually read before the Five Classics themselves. During the Eastern Han the heir apparent was provided a tutor specialized solely in teaching him the <em>Analects</em>. The growing importance of the <em>Analects</em> within Confucianism was recognized during the Eastern Han when the Five Classics was expanded to the &quot;Seven Classics&quot;: the Five Classics plus the <em>Analects</em> and the <em><a href="Classic_of_Filial_Piety" title="wikilink">Classic of Filial Piety</a></em>. The status of the <em>Analects</em> as one of the central texts of Confucianism continued to grow until the late <a href="Song_dynasty" title="wikilink">Song dynasty</a> (960-1279), when it was identified and promoted as one of the <a href="Four_Books" title="wikilink">Four Books</a> by <a href="Zhu_Xi" title="wikilink">Zhu Xi</a> and generally accepted as being more insightful than the older Five Classics.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="commentaries">Commentaries</h3>
<p><img src="Commentaries_of_the_Analects_of_Confucius.jpg" title="fig:A copy of Zhu Xi&#39;s commentary on the Analects, printed during the Ming dynasty" alt="A copy of Zhu Xi&#39;s commentary on the Analects, printed during the Ming dynasty" /> Since the Han dynasty Chinese readers have interpreted the <em>Analects</em> by reading scholars' commentaries on the book. There have been many commentaries on the <em>Analects</em> since the Han dynasty, but the two commentaries which have been most influential on Chinese readers' interpretation of the text have been the <em>Collected Explanations of the Analects</em> (<em>Lunyu Jijie</em>) by <a href="He_Yan" title="wikilink">He Yan</a> (c. 195-249) and several colleagues, and the <em>Collected Commentaries of the Analects</em> (<em>Lunyu Jizhu</em>) by <a href="Zhu_Xi" title="wikilink">Zhu Xi</a> (1130-1200). He's work collected, selected, summarized, and rationalized the most insightful of all preceding commentaries on the <em>Analects</em> which had been produced by earlier Han dynasty and <a href="Cao_Wei" title="wikilink">Wei dynasty</a> (220-265 AD) scholars. He's personal interpretation of the <em>Lunyu</em> was guided by his belief that <a href="Daoism" class="uri" title="wikilink">Daoism</a> and <a href="Confucianism" class="uri" title="wikilink">Confucianism</a> complimented each other, so that by studying them both in a correct manner a scholar could arrive at a single, unified truth. Arguing for the ultimate compatibility of Daoist and Confucian teachings, He argued that &quot;Laozi [in fact] was in agreement with the Sage&quot; (sic). The <em>Explanations</em> was written in 248 AD, was quickly recognized as authoritative, and remained the standard guide to interpreting the <em>Analects</em> for nearly 1000 years, until the early <a href="Yuan_dynasty" title="wikilink">Yuan dynasty</a> (1271-1368). It is the oldest complete commentary on the <em>Analects</em> that still exists.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<p>He Yan's commentary was eventually displaced as the definitive, standard commentary by Zhu Xi's commentary. Zhu Xi's work also brought together the commentaries of earlier scholars (mostly from the Song dynasty), along with his own interpretations. Zhu's work took part in the context of a renewed interest in Confucian studies, in which Chinese scholars were interested in producing a single &quot;correct&quot; intellectual orthodoxy that would &quot;save&quot; Chinese traditions and protect them from foreign influences, and in which scholars were increasingly interested in metaphysical speculation. In his preface, Zhu Xi stated that &quot;the <em>Analects</em> and the <em><a href="Mencius_(book)" title="wikilink">Mencius</a></em> are the most important works for students pursuing the <a href="Tao" title="wikilink">Way</a>... The words of the <em>Analects</em> are all inclusive; what they teach is nothing but the essentials of preserving the mind and cultivating [one's] nature&quot;. From his first publication of the <em>Commentaries</em>, Zhu continued to refine his interpretation for the last thirty years of his life. In the fourteenth century Zhu's commentary was endorsed by the <a href="Ming_dynasty" title="wikilink">Chinese government</a>, and until 1905 it was read and memorized along with the <em>Analects</em> by all Chinese aspiring to literacy and employment as government officials.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="contents">Contents</h2>
<p>Very few reliable sources about Confucius exist. The principal biography available to historians is included in <a href="Sima_Qian" title="wikilink">Sima Qian</a>'s <em><a href="Shiji" class="uri" title="wikilink">Shiji</a></em>; but, because the <em>Shiji</em> also contains material not confirmed by other sources, the biographical material on Confucius found in the <em>Analects</em> makes the <em>Analects</em> possibly the most reliable source of biographical information about Confucius.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> Confucius viewed himself as a &quot;transmitter&quot; of social and political traditions originating in the early <a href="Zhou_dynasty" title="wikilink">Zhou dynasty</a> (c.1000-800 BC), and claimed not to have originated anything (<em>Analects</em> 7.1), but Confucius' social and political ideals were not popular in his time.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="social-philosophy">Social philosophy</h3>
<p>Confucius' discussions on the nature of the supernatural (<em>Analects</em> 3.12, 6.20, 11.11) indicate that he respected <a href="Tian" title="wikilink">Heaven</a> but believed that &quot;spirits&quot; were too difficult to understand, and that human beings should intead base their values and social ideals on moral reason and evidence. Confucius' social philosophy largely revolved around the cultivation of <a href="Ren_(Confucianism)" title="wikilink"><em>ren</em></a> (&quot;benevolence&quot; or &quot;altruism&quot;) by every individual in a community. To Confucius, the cultivation of <em>ren</em> involved depreciating oneself through modesty while avoiding artful speech and ingratiating manners that would create a false impression of one's own quality (<em>Analects</em> 1.3). Confucius said that those who had cultivated <em>ren</em> could be distinguished by their being &quot;simple in manner and slow of speech&quot;. He believed that people could cultivate their sense of <em>ren</em> through exercising the <a href="Golden_Rule" title="wikilink">Golden Rule</a>: &quot;What you do not desire to yourself, do not do to others&quot;; &quot;a man with <em>ren</em>, desiring to establish himself, helps others establish themselves; desiring to succeed himself, helps others to succeed&quot; (<em>Analects</em> 12.2; 6.30). Confucius regarded the exercise of devotion to one's parents and older siblings as the simplest, most basic way to cultivate <em>ren</em>.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
<p>Confucius believed that <em>ren</em> could only be cultivated by those who had already learned self-discipline, and that self-discipline was best learned by cultivating one's understanding of <a href="Li_(Confucian)" title="wikilink"><em>li</em></a>: rituals and forms of propriety through which a person demonstrates their respect for others and their responsible role in society) (<em>Analects</em> 3.3). Confucius said that one's understanding of <em>li</em> should inform everything that he says and does (<em>Analects</em> 12.1). Confucius believed that subjecting oneself to <em>li</em> did not mean suppressing one's desires, but learning to reconcile them with the needs of one's family and broader community. By leading individuals to express their desires within the context of social responsibility, Confucius and his followers taught that the public cultivation of <em>li</em> was the basis of a well-ordered society (<em>Analects</em> 2.4).<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
<p><em>Ren</em> and <em>li</em> have a special relationship in the <em>Analects</em>: <em>li</em> manages one's relationship with one's family and close community, while <em>ren</em> is practiced broadly and informs one's interactions with all people. Confucius did not believe that ethical self-cultivation meant unquestioned loyalty to an evil ruler. He argued that the demands of <em>ren</em> and <em>li</em> meant that rulers could oppress an ethical population only at their own peril: &quot;You may rob the Three Armies of their commander, but you cannot deprive the humblest peasant of his opinion&quot; (<em>Analects</em> 9.25). Confucius said that a morally well-cultivated individual would regard his devotion to loving others as a mission for which he would be willing to die (<em>Analects</em> 15.8).<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="political-philosophy">Political philosophy</h3>
<p>Confucius' political beliefs were rooted in his belief that a good ruler would be self-disciplined, would govern his subjects through education and by his own example, and would seek to correct his subjects with love and concern rather than punishment and coercion. &quot;If the people be led by laws, and uniformity among them be sought by punishments, they will try to escape punishment and have no sense of shame. If they are led by virtue, and uniformity sought among them through the practice of ritual propriety, they will possess a sense of shame and come to you of their own accord&quot; (<em>Analects</em> 2.3; see also 13.6). Confucius' political theories were directly contradictory to the <a href="Legalism_(Chinese_philosophy)" title="wikilink">Legalistic</a> political orientations of China's rulers, and he failed to popularize his ideals among China's leaders within his own lifetime.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a></p>
<p>Confucius believed that the social chaos of his time was largely due to China's ruling elite aspiring to, and claiming, titles to which they were unworthy. When the ruler of the large state of <a href="Qi_(state)" title="wikilink">Qi</a> asked Confucius about the principles of good government, Confucius responded: &quot;Good government consists in the ruler being a ruler, the minister being a minister, the father being a father, and the son being a son&quot; (<em>Analects</em> 12.11). Confucius' analysis of the need to raise officials' behaviour to reflect the way that they identify and describe themselves is known as the <a href="rectification_of_names" title="wikilink">rectification of names</a>, and he stated that the rectification of names should be the first responsibility of a ruler upon taking office (<em>Analects</em> 13.3). Confucius believed that, because the ruler was the model for all under him in society, the rectification of names had to begin with the ruler, and that afterwards others would change to imitate him (<em>Analects</em> 12.19).<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>
<p>Confucius judged a good ruler by his possession of <em>de</em> (&quot;virtue&quot;): a sort of moral force that allows those in power to rule and gain the loyalty of others without the need for physical coercion (<em>Analects</em> 2.1). Confucius said that one of the most essential ways that a ruler cultivates his sense of <em>de</em> is through a devotion to the correct practices of <em>li</em>. Examples of rituals identified by Confucius as important to cultivate a ruler's <em>de</em> include: sacrificial rites held at ancestral temples to express thankfulness and humility; ceremonies of enfeoffment, toasting, and gift exchanges that bound nobility in complex hierarchical relationships of obligation and indebtedness; and, acts of formal politeness and decorum (i.e. bowing and yielding) that identify the performers as morally well-cultivated.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="education">Education</h3>
<p>The importance of education and study is a fundamental theme of the <em>Analects</em>. For Confucius, a good student imitates the words and deeds of his teacher, and a good teacher is someone older who is familiar with the ways of the past and the practices of antiquity (<em>Analects</em> 7.22). Confucius emphasized the need to find balance between formal study and intuitive self-reflection (<em>Analects</em> 2.15). When teaching he is never cited in the <em>Analects</em> as lecturing at length about any subject, but instead challenges his students to discover the truth through asking direct questions, citing passages from the classics, and using analogies (<em>Analects</em> 7.8). His primary goal in educating his students was to produce ethically well-cultivated men who would carry themselves with gravity, speak correctly, and demonstrate consummate integrity in all things (<em>Analects</em> 12.11; see also 13.3). He was willing to teach anyone regardless of social class, as long as they were sincere, eager, and tireless to learn. He is traditionally credited with teaching three thousand students, though only seventy are said to have mastered what he taught. He taught the &quot;<a href="Six_Arts" title="wikilink">Six Arts</a>&quot;, but regarded moral self-cultivation as his most important subject.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="chapters">Chapters</h3>
<p>The traditional titles given to each chapter are mostly the initial two or three <a href="incipit" title="wikilink">incipits</a>. In some cases, they may indicate, as the Brooks propose, a central theme of the chapter, but it is inappropriate to regard the title as a capture or a generalization of the content of the chapter. Chapters in the <em>Analects</em> are grouped by individual themes, but the chapters are not arranged in any sort of way so as to carry a continuous stream of thought or idea. The themes of adjacent chapters completely unrelated to each other. Central themes recur repeatedly in different chapters, sometimes in exactly the same wording and sometimes with small variations.</p>
<p>Chapter 10 contains detailed descriptions of Confucius' behaviors in various daily activities. <a href="Voltaire" class="uri" title="wikilink">Voltaire</a> and <a href="Ezra_Pound" title="wikilink">Ezra Pound</a> believed that this chapter demonstrated how Confucius was a mere human. <a href="Simon_Leys" title="wikilink">Simon Leys</a>, who recently translated the <em>Analects</em> into English and French, said that the book may have been the first in human history to describe the life of an individual, historic personage. <a href="Elias_Canetti" title="wikilink">Elias Canetti</a> wrote: &quot;Confucius' <em>Conversations</em> are the oldest complete intellectual and spiritual portrait of a man. It strikes one as a modern book; everything it contains and indeed everything it lacks is important.&quot;<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a></p>
