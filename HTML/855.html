<p>A <strong>variety show</strong>, also known as <strong>variety arts</strong> or <strong>variety entertainment</strong>, is an entertainment made up of a variety of acts, especially musical performances and <a href="sketch_comedy" title="wikilink">sketch comedy</a>, and normally introduced by a <a href="Master_of_Ceremonies" title="wikilink">comp&lt;U+00E8&gt;re (master of ceremonies)</a> or <a href="Presenter" title="wikilink">host</a>. Other types of acts include <a href="magic_(illusion)" title="wikilink">magic</a>, <a href="animal_training" title="wikilink">animal</a> and circus acts, <a href="acrobatics" class="uri" title="wikilink">acrobatics</a>, <a href="juggling" class="uri" title="wikilink">juggling</a> and <a href="ventriloquism" class="uri" title="wikilink">ventriloquism</a>. The variety format made its way from <a href="Victorian_era" title="wikilink">Victorian era</a> stage to radio to television. Variety shows were a staple of <a href="English_language" title="wikilink">anglophone</a> television from its early days into the 1970s, and lasted into the 1980s. In several parts of the world, variety TV remains popular and widespread.</p>
<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<p>The format is basically that of <a href="music_hall" title="wikilink">music hall</a> in the United Kingdom (UK) or <a href="vaudeville" class="uri" title="wikilink">vaudeville</a> in the United States (US).<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> Variety in the UK evolved in theatres and music halls, and later in <a href="Working_men&#39;s_club" title="wikilink">Working Men's Clubs</a>. Most of the early top performers on <a href="British_television" title="wikilink">British television</a> and radio did an apprenticeship either in stage variety, or during World War II in <a href="Entertainments_National_Service_Association" title="wikilink">Entertainments National Service Association</a> (ENSA). In the UK, the ultimate accolade for a variety artist for decades was to be asked to do the annual <a href="Royal_Command_Performance" title="wikilink">Royal Command Performance</a> at the <a href="London_Palladium" title="wikilink">London Palladium</a> theatre, in front of the monarch.</p>
<p>In the United States, former vaudeville performers such as the <a href="Marx_Brothers" title="wikilink">Marx Brothers</a>, <a href="George_Burns" title="wikilink">George Burns</a> and <a href="Gracie_Allen" title="wikilink">Gracie Allen</a>, <a href="W._C._Fields" title="wikilink">W. C. Fields</a>, and <a href="Jack_Benny" title="wikilink">Jack Benny</a> moved to <a href="talkies" title="wikilink">sound movies</a>, then radio, and then television shows, including variety shows. In the 1960s, even a popular rock band such as <a href="The_Beatles" title="wikilink">The Beatles</a> undertook this ritual of appearing on variety shows on TV. In the US, shows featuring <a href="Perry_Como" title="wikilink">Perry Como</a>, <a href="Milton_Berle" title="wikilink">Milton Berle</a>, <a href="Jackie_Gleason" title="wikilink">Jackie Gleason</a>, <a href="Bob_Hope" title="wikilink">Bob Hope</a> and <a href="Dean_Martin" title="wikilink">Dean Martin</a> also helped to make the <a href="Golden_Age_of_Television" title="wikilink">Golden Age of Television</a> successful.</p>
<p>From 1948 to 1971, <em><a href="The_Ed_Sullivan_Show" title="wikilink">The Ed Sullivan Show</a></em> was one of <a href="CBS" class="uri" title="wikilink">CBS</a>'s most popular television series. Using his no-nonsense approach, <a href="Ed_Sullivan" title="wikilink">Ed Sullivan</a> allowed many acts from several different mediums to get their &quot;fifteen minutes of fame.&quot; Sullivan was also partially responsible for bringing <a href="Elvis_Presley" title="wikilink">Elvis Presley</a> and The Beatles to U.S. prominence.</p>
<p><a href="Sid_Caesar" title="wikilink">Sid Caesar</a> pioneered the television variety show format with <a href="Your_Show_of_Shows" title="wikilink">Your Show of Shows</a> (1950&lt;U+2013&gt;54) and <a href="Caesar&#39;s_Hour" title="wikilink">Caesar's Hour</a> (1954&lt;U+2013&gt;57).<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p><a href="American_Broadcasting_Company" title="wikilink">ABC-TV</a> aired <em><a href="Hollywood_Palace" title="wikilink">The Hollywood Palace</a></em>, an hour-long show broadcast weekly (generally on Saturday night) from January 4, 1964 to February 7, 1970, where the <a href="Rolling_Stones" title="wikilink">Rolling Stones</a> first appeared on American TV.</p>
<p>In the UK, <em><a href="The_Good_Old_Days" title="wikilink">The Good Old Days</a></em> &lt;U+2013&gt; which ran from 1953 to 1983 &lt;U+2013&gt; featured modern artists performing dressed in late <a href="Victorian_era" title="wikilink">Victorian</a>/Early <a href="Edwardian_era" title="wikilink">Edwardian</a> costume, either doing their own act or performing as a music hall artist of that period. The audience was also encouraged to dress in period costume in a similar fashion.</p>
<p>On television, variety reached its peak during the period of the 1960s and 1970s. With a turn of the television dial, viewers around the globe could variously have seen shows and occasional specials featuring <a href="Dinah_Shore" title="wikilink">Dinah Shore</a>, <a href="Bob_Hope" title="wikilink">Bob Hope</a>, <a href="Bing_Crosby" title="wikilink">Bing Crosby</a>, <a href="Perry_Como" title="wikilink">Perry Como</a>, <a href="Andy_Williams" title="wikilink">Andy Williams</a>, <a href="Julie_Andrews" title="wikilink">Julie Andrews</a>, <a href="The_Carpenters" title="wikilink">The Carpenters</a>, <a href="Olivia_Newton-John" title="wikilink">Olivia Newton-John</a>, <a href="John_Denver" title="wikilink">John Denver</a>, <a href="John_Davidson_(entertainer)" title="wikilink">John Davidson</a>, <a href="Mac_Davis" title="wikilink">Mac Davis</a>, <a href="Bobby_Goldsboro" title="wikilink">Bobby Goldsboro</a>, <a href="Lynda_Carter" title="wikilink">Lynda Carter</a>, <a href="Johnny_Cash" title="wikilink">Johnny Cash</a>, <a href="Sonny_and_Cher" title="wikilink">Sonny and Cher</a>, <a href="Bob_Monkhouse" title="wikilink">Bob Monkhouse</a>, <a href="Carol_Burnett" title="wikilink">Carol Burnett</a>, <a href="Rod_Hull_and_Emu" title="wikilink">Rod Hull and Emu</a>, <a href="Flip_Wilson" title="wikilink">Flip Wilson</a>, <a href="Lawrence_Welk" title="wikilink">Lawrence Welk</a>, <a href="Glen_Campbell" title="wikilink">Glen Campbell</a>, <a href="Donny_&amp;_Marie_Osmond" title="wikilink">Donny &amp; Marie Osmond</a>, <a href="Barbara_Mandrell" title="wikilink">Barbara Mandrell</a>, <a href="Judy_Garland" title="wikilink">Judy Garland</a>, <a href="The_Captain_&amp;_Tennille" title="wikilink">The Captain &amp; Tennille</a>, <a href="The_Jacksons" title="wikilink">The Jacksons</a>, <a href="The_Keane_Brothers" title="wikilink">The Keane Brothers</a>, <a href="Bobby_Darin" title="wikilink">Bobby Darin</a>, <a href="Sammy_Davis,_Jr." title="wikilink">Sammy Davis, Jr.</a>, <a href="Mary_Tyler_Moore" title="wikilink">Mary Tyler Moore</a>, <a href="Dean_Martin" title="wikilink">Dean Martin</a>, <a href="Tony_Orlando_and_Dawn" title="wikilink">Tony Orlando and Dawn</a>, <a href="The_Smothers_Brothers" title="wikilink">The Smothers Brothers</a>, <a href="Danny_Kaye" title="wikilink">Danny Kaye</a>, <a href="Hee_Haw" title="wikilink">Buck and Roy</a>, <a href="Roy_Hudd" title="wikilink">Roy Hudd</a>, <a href="Billy_Dainty" title="wikilink">Billy Dainty</a> <a href="Max_Wall" title="wikilink">Max Wall</a> or <em><a href="The_Muppet_Show" title="wikilink">The Muppet Show</a></em>. Even &quot;<a href="The_Brady_Bunch" title="wikilink">The Brady Bunch</a>&quot; had a variety show. Variety shows were once as common on television as <a href="Western_(genre)" title="wikilink">Westerns</a>, courtroom dramas, <a href="suspense_thriller" title="wikilink">suspense thrillers</a>, sitcoms, or (in more modern times) reality shows.</p>
<p>During the 1960s and 1970s, there were also numerous one-time variety specials featuring stars such as <a href="Shirley_MacLaine" title="wikilink">Shirley MacLaine</a>, <a href="Frank_Sinatra" title="wikilink">Frank Sinatra</a>, <a href="Diana_Ross" title="wikilink">Diana Ross</a> and <a href="Mitzi_Gaynor" title="wikilink">Mitzi Gaynor</a>, none of whom ever had a regular television series.</p>
<h2 id="contemporary-u.s.-variety-shows">Contemporary U.S. variety shows</h2>
<p>Variety shows began to fade from popularity in the early 1970s, when research began to show that variety shows appealed to an older audience that was less appealing to advertisers; over the course of the so-called &quot;<a href="rural_purge" title="wikilink">rural purge</a>,&quot; several of the early era variety shows were canceled, though newer ones (fewer in number nonetheless) continued to be created and aired for several years after. By the late 1970s, variety shows had mostly ended production, and by the early 1980s, the few new variety shows being produced were of remarkably poor quality (see, for instance, the infamous <em><a href="Pink_Lady_and_Jeff" title="wikilink">Pink Lady and Jeff</a></em>), hastening the format's demise. Since <em>Pink Lady</em>, only a few traditional variety shows have been attempted on television programs: <em><a href="Dolly_(TV_series)" title="wikilink">Dolly</a></em> (starring <a href="Dolly_Parton" title="wikilink">Dolly Parton</a>), which ran for 23 episodes on the ABC television network during the 1987&lt;U+2013&gt;'88 season; a revival of <em><a href="The_Carol_Burnett_Show" title="wikilink">The Carol Burnett Show</a></em>, which aired on CBS for nine episodes in 1991; and the first incarnation of <em><a href="The_Wayne_Brady_Show" title="wikilink">The Wayne Brady Show</a></em>, which aired on ABC in August 2001.</p>
<p>By the 21st century, the variety show format had fallen out of fashion, due largely to changing tastes and the fracturing of media audiences (caused by the proliferation of cable and satellite television) that makes a multiple-genre variety show impractical. Even reruns of variety shows have generally not been particularly widespread; <a href="TV_Land" title="wikilink">TV Land</a> briefly aired some variety shows (namely <em><a href="The_Ed_Sullivan_Show" title="wikilink">The Ed Sullivan Show</a></em> and <em><a href="The_Sonny_and_Cher_Comedy_Hour" title="wikilink">The Sonny and Cher Comedy Hour</a></em>) upon its launch in 1996, but within a few years, those reruns stopped. Similarly, <a href="Country_Music_Television" title="wikilink">CMT</a> held rights to <em><a href="Hee_Haw" title="wikilink">Hee Haw</a></em> but almost never aired any episodes (current rights holder <a href="RFD-TV" class="uri" title="wikilink">RFD-TV</a> has been more prominent in their airings of the show). A notable exception is <em><a href="The_Lawrence_Welk_Show" title="wikilink">The Lawrence Welk Show</a></em>, which has aired continuously in reruns on the <a href="Public_Broadcasting_System" title="wikilink">Public Broadcasting System</a> since 1986. The Spanish language variety show <em><a href="Sabado_Gigante" title="wikilink">Sabado Gigante</a></em>, which began in 1962 and moved from <a href="Chile" class="uri" title="wikilink">Chile</a> to the United States in 1986, continues to air and produce new episodes; it currently airs on <a href="Univision" class="uri" title="wikilink">Univision</a>.</p>
<p>However, though the format had faded in popularity in prime time, it thrived in <a href="late_night_television" title="wikilink">late night</a>. The variety shows of this daypart eventually evolved into <em><a href="late-night_talk_show" title="wikilink">late-night talk show</a></em>s, which combined variety entertainment with talk show elements (mainly celebrity interviews). (The <a href="Emmy_Awards" title="wikilink">Emmy Awards</a> consider the two genres to be closely enough related that they issue the <a href="Primetime_Emmy_Award_for_Outstanding_Variety,_Music_or_Comedy_Series" title="wikilink">Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Variety, Music or Comedy Series</a> to either type of show.) Though only one network (NBC, with its <em><a href="The_Tonight_Show_Starring_Johnny_Carson" title="wikilink">The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson</a></em> and later <em><a href="Late_Night_with_David_Letterman" title="wikilink">Late Night with David Letterman</a></em>) had a successful late-night talk show until 1992, the field greatly expanded beginning with Carson's retirement and the controversial selection of <a href="Jay_Leno" title="wikilink">Jay Leno</a> as <em>Tonight</em>'s new host. Within ten years, all three of the &quot;Big Three&quot; networks, along with several cable outlets, had late night variety talk shows airing nightly. (NBC, in a cost-cutting move, attempted to bring Leno's show to prime time as <em><a href="The_Jay_Leno_Show" title="wikilink">The Jay Leno Show</a></em> in 2009, but affiliates threatened to drop the program after local news ratings suffered, forcing him back to late night within four months of the prime time debut.) <a href="Sketch_comedy" title="wikilink">Sketch comedy</a> series such as <em><a href="Saturday_Night_Live" title="wikilink">Saturday Night Live</a></em>, <em><a href="Almost_Live!" title="wikilink">Almost Live!</a></em>, <em><a href="MADtv" class="uri" title="wikilink">MADtv</a></em> and <em><a href="Second_City_Television" title="wikilink">SCTV</a></em> also contain variety show elements, particularly musical performances and comedy sketches (though only the first of these remains on air as of 2010). The most obvious difference between shows such as <em>Saturday Night Live</em> and traditional variety shows is the lack of a single lead host (or hosts) and a large <a href="ensemble_cast" title="wikilink">ensemble cast</a>. <em>SNL</em> has used different guest hosts ever since its inception.</p>
<p>The variety show format also continues in the form of the <a href="telethon" class="uri" title="wikilink">telethon</a>, which features several hours of variety entertainment. The <a href="Jerry_Lewis_MDA_Telethon" title="wikilink">Jerry Lewis MDA Telethon</a> is one of the best known national telethons, and local telethons also still exist (one of the few times local stations produce non-news entertainment programming themselves). These, too, are losing popularity; the Lewis telethon was cut from over 21 hours to six in 2011 as a response to declining returns while Lewis himself was controversially removed from the telethon, while only a handful of long-established local telethons remain on air.</p>
<p>In 2004, <a href="American_Broadcasting_Company" title="wikilink">ABC</a>'s <em>The <a href="Nick_Lachey" title="wikilink">Nick</a> and <a href="Jessica_Simpson" title="wikilink">Jessica</a> Variety Hour</em> attempted to revive the prime-time variety hour as a special for today's generation. It was followed by <em>Nick &amp; Jessica's Family Christmas</em> in early December of that year, though no further specials would be produced after that due to the couple's divorce. NBC's <em><a href="Rosie_Live" title="wikilink">Rosie Live</a></em> did not fare so well: the series' pilot episode aired the day before Thanksgiving 2008 and, after being panned by critics, would not be picked up. In December 2009, singer <a href="Carrie_Underwood" title="wikilink">Carrie Underwood</a> made her first attempt at a Christmas variety special on <a href="Fox_network" title="wikilink">FOX</a>. Fox's <em><a href="Osbournes_Reloaded" title="wikilink">Osbournes Reloaded</a></em>, a variety show featuring the family of rocker <a href="Ozzy_Osbourne" title="wikilink">Ozzy Osbourne</a>, and was canceled after only one episode had aired in 2009, after over two dozen affiliates refused to air the first episode of the show; the series had been slated for a six-episode run.</p>
<p><em><a href="America&#39;s_Got_Talent" title="wikilink">America's Got Talent</a></em>, which has aired on <a href="NBC" class="uri" title="wikilink">NBC</a> television in the United States since 2006, combines variety entertainment with <a href="reality_television" title="wikilink">reality television</a> in an elimination contest, and has had success with the format, regularly ranking among the most watched summer series in the United States.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> The success of the show has spawned an <a href="Got_Talent" title="wikilink">international franchise</a>. Another similar format that has had varying degrees of success combining the two formats was <em><a href="Star_Search" title="wikilink">Star Search</a></em>, which had a run in the 1980s in syndication and a run on <a href="CBS" class="uri" title="wikilink">CBS</a> in the early 2000s during the reality television boom.</p>
<h2 id="other-countries">Other countries</h2>
<p><strong>Australia</strong>: The prime time variety show format was popular in the early decades of Australian television, spawning such series as <em><a href="In_Melbourne_Tonight" title="wikilink">In Melbourne Tonight</a></em>, <em><a href="The_Graham_Kennedy_Show" title="wikilink">The Graham Kennedy Show</a></em>, <em>The Don Lane Show</em>, and <em><a href="Hey_Hey_It&#39;s_Saturday" title="wikilink">Hey Hey It's Saturday</a></em>, which ran for 27 years. Recent prime time variety shows include the short lived <em><a href="Micallef_Tonight" title="wikilink">Micallef Tonight</a></em> and <em><a href="The_Sideshow" title="wikilink">The Sideshow</a></em>.</p>

In Hong Kong, variety shows are often combined with elements of a cooking show or a talent competition but end in various results.</p>
<p><strong>Mexico</strong>:<em><a href="Siempre_en_Domingo" title="wikilink">Siempre en Domingo</a></em> premiered in 1969 with <a href="Raul_Velasco" title="wikilink">Raul Velasco</a> hosting. It became Mexico's longest-running variety series, remaining on <a href="Televisa" class="uri" title="wikilink">Televisa</a> until 1998. Other long-running variety shows, most of which have been Televisa productions, have included <em><a href="La_Carabina_de_Ambrosio" title="wikilink">La Carabina de Ambrosio</a></em>, <em><a href="Anabel_Ferreira" title="wikilink">Anabel</a></em>, <em><a href="Al_Fin_de_Semana" title="wikilink">Al Fin de Semana</a></em>, <em><a href="Silvia_Pinal" title="wikilink">Silvia</a> y <a href="Enrique_Guzman" title="wikilink">Enrique</a></em>, <em><a href="La_Parodia" title="wikilink">La Parodia</a></em> and <em><a href="Muevete" class="uri" title="wikilink">Muevete</a></em>. Most, if not all, of Televisa's variety shows have aired in other countries, including the Univision networks in the United States.</p>
<p><strong>Taiwan</strong>: Another of today's variety shows in Asia is <a href="Taiwan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Taiwan</a>'s <em><a href="Variety_Big_Brother" title="wikilink">Variety Big Brother</a></em>. East Asian variety programs are known for its constant use of sound effects, on-screen visuals and comedic bantering.

<p>The most popular variety program in Taiwan is the long-running &quot;Super Sunday&quot;, known for its fast-paced style and catchphrases. The second half of the program is more emotional with guests finally or attempting to reunite with another (either a celebrity or a friend) by re-enacting the moment (in a satirical manner) and then let co-star and singer <em>Ah-Liang</em> search for the specific person through various locations. It was succeeded by &quot;Happy Sunday&quot;, a similar program hosted by the co-stars.</p>
<p>Another popular variety show in Taiwan is <a href="KangXi_Lai_Le" title="wikilink">KangXi Lai Le</a>, a talk show with variety show elements. The hosts and guests were associated with variety shows. Famous for its bantering, which were written before tapings.</p>
<p><strong>South Korea</strong>: In <a href="South_Korea" title="wikilink">South Korea</a> the hugely popular <em><a href="Infinite_Challenge" title="wikilink">Muhan Dojeon</a></em> (<em>Infinite Challenge</em>), broadcast by <a href="Munhwa_Broadcasting_Corporation" title="wikilink">MBC</a> since 2005, is a new model of this. It combines comedy and variety scenes including unscripted stunts.</p>
<p><strong>Philippines</strong>: In the <a href="Philippines" class="uri" title="wikilink">Philippines</a>, the longest-running variety show <em><a href="Eat_Bulaga" title="wikilink">Eat Bulaga</a></em> still airs up to this day on <a href="GMA_Network" title="wikilink">GMA Network</a>.
