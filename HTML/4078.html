<p><a href="File:Hobhouse.jpg" title="wikilink">thumb|upright=1.2|<a href="Emily_Hobhouse" title="wikilink">Emily Hobhouse</a> authored the Open Christmas Letter and circulated it for signatures.</a> The <strong>Open Christmas Letter</strong> was a public message for <a href="peace" class="uri" title="wikilink">peace</a> addressed &quot;<strong>To the Women of <a href="Germany" class="uri" title="wikilink">Germany</a> and <a href="Austria" class="uri" title="wikilink">Austria</a></strong>&quot;,<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> signed by a group of 101 <a href="United_Kingdom" title="wikilink">British</a> women <a href="suffragist" title="wikilink">suffragists</a><a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> at the end of 1914 as the first <a href="Christmas" class="uri" title="wikilink">Christmas</a> of <a href="World_War_I" title="wikilink">World War I</a> approached. The Open Christmas Letter was written in acknowledgment of the mounting horror of modern war and as a direct response to letters written to <a href="United_States" title="wikilink">American</a> feminist <a href="Carrie_Chapman_Catt" title="wikilink">Carrie Chapman Catt</a>, the president of the <a href="International_Woman_Suffrage_Alliance" title="wikilink">International Woman Suffrage Alliance</a> (IWSA), by a small group of German women's rights activists. Published in January 1915 in <em>Jus Suffragii</em>, the journal of the IWSA, the Open Christmas Letter was answered two months later by a group of 155 prominent German and Austrian women who were <a href="Pacifism" title="wikilink">pacifists</a>. The exchange of letters between women of nations at war helped promote the aims of peace, and helped prevent the fracturing of the unity which lay in the common goal they shared: <a href="Women&#39;s_suffrage" title="wikilink">suffrage for women</a>.</p>
<p>The decision by some suffragists to speak out against the war split the women's suffrage movement in the United Kingdom. Most British women were in favor of a quick solution to the conflict and were inclined to work toward that end in any way such as by helping fill positions abandoned by men off at war. Others were nationalistic and sought to make certain that British women were seen as patriotic, as doing their part, so that the men in power would think more highly of them and subsequently pass woman suffrage legislation. A minority of women advocated peace vociferously and worked with international peace organizations or with refugee aid societies. All suffragists from the most strikingly militant to the most actively pacifist agreed not to disrupt the nation at war in their promotion of women's suffrage. Toward the end of the war, British politicians rewarded them with a partial victory: suffrage for property-holding women aged 30 and older.</p>
<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>From 1906 until mid-1914, the <a href="Labour_Party_(UK)" title="wikilink">Labour Party</a> in the United Kingdom was the party seen as most supportive of <a href="women&#39;s_suffrage" title="wikilink">women's suffrage</a>&lt;U+2014&gt;the right of women to vote. Suffragettes and other women's rights activists organized to elect Labour candidates and to push for legislation that expanded the rights of women.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> In August 1914 when the world became embroiled in war, the British women activists were sharply divided into two camps: the majority who wished to work with their country's war effort, and a minority who opposed the conflict.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> <a href="Millicent_Garrett_Fawcett" title="wikilink">Millicent Garrett Fawcett</a> of the <a href="National_Union_of_Women&#39;s_Suffrage_Societies" title="wikilink">National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies</a> (NUWSS) wished to have the NUWSS members work for the war so that the men in politics would view the women with greater respect and would thus be more amenable to granting them the right to vote. However, the NUWSS membership included those who were against war. When Fawcett turned the NUWSS to war work, eleven pacifist members resigned, later to join the <a href="Women&#39;s_International_League_for_Peace_and_Freedom" title="wikilink">Women's International League for Peace and Freedom</a> (WILPF).<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>Like the NUWSS, the more militant <a href="Women&#39;s_Social_and_Political_Union" title="wikilink">Women's Social and Political Union</a> (WSPU) led by Emmeline and Christabel Pankhurst chose to cease their obstructive activism for women's votes and instead advocated the alignment of British women to the cause of war. However, in October 1914, <a href="Sylvia_Pankhurst" title="wikilink">Sylvia Pankhurst</a> travelled to <a href="Glasgow" class="uri" title="wikilink">Glasgow</a> and spoke out against the war, becoming one of the first suffragettes to do so. She said that &quot;peace must be made by the people and not by the diplomats.&quot;<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> Though pacifist, Pankhurst held with her mother and sister to the general agreement that suffragettes would abstain from militant activism for the duration&lt;U+2014&gt;she arranged for activist women to join with the War Emergency Worker&lt;U+2019&gt;s Committee and fill some of the positions that had been abandoned by men leaving for war.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>

The letter was entitled &quot;To the International Woman Suffrage Alliance, through its president, Mrs. Chapman Catt.&quot;<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> It began, &quot;To the women of all nations warm and hearty greetings in these wretched and bloody times.&quot;<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> The German women expressed that the &quot;criminally rekindled war&quot; should not separate women from all countries who had previously been united &quot;by the common striving for the highest object&lt;U+2014&gt;personal and political freedom.&quot;<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> They stated that &quot;True humanity knows no national hatred, no national contempt. Women are nearer to true humanity than men.&quot;<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<p>Catt published another letter from German women's rights activist <a href="Clara_Zetkin" title="wikilink">Clara Zetkin</a>, one that expressed the desire for all women not to let &quot;the thunder of guns and the shouts of the <a href="Jingoism" title="wikilink">jingoes</a>&quot; make them forget that the rise of civilization amongst the European countries held much in common. Zetkin wrote that the women of the world should guard their children against the &quot;hollow din&quot; of &quot;cheap racial pride&quot; which filled the streets, and that &quot;the blood of dead and wounded must not become a stream to divide what present need and future hope unite.&quot;<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> </p>

She saw in the German letters the opportunity for maintaining vital international relations among women who could help mitigate the damage that war would bring. She wrote what she called a &quot;Letter of Christmas Greeting&quot; in November 1914 and circulated it for signatures of women who wished for peace.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> Pankhurst and <a href="Helen_Bright_Clark" title="wikilink">Helen Bright Clark</a> were among the first to sign Hobhouse's plea for continued sisterhood among the women of the world.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>

<p>When this announcement reached the UK, the NUWSS was divided on the one hand by patriots such as Fawcett and on the other by the signers of the Christmas letter who wished to send peace delegates. However, the majority of the NUWSS were nationalistic more than they were peace-minded&lt;U+2014&gt;they were primarily concerned with helping the UK men win the war.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> The NUWSS membership rejected a resolution favored by <a href="Helen_Bright_Clark" title="wikilink">Helen Bright Clark</a> and <a href="Margaret_Bondfield" title="wikilink">Margaret Bondfield</a><a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> which would have supported a delegation of women at The Hague.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> Because of this, Margaret Ashton resigned from the NUWSS and was subsequently censured by her local <a href="Manchester" class="uri" title="wikilink">Manchester</a> branch of suffragists.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> As well, Helena Swanwick and Maude Royden resigned from the NUWSS and made plans to attend at The Hague.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a></p>
<p>At The Hague 28 April to 1 May 1915, a large congress of 1,150 women from North America and Europe gathered to discuss peace proposals.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> The event was called the <a href="International_Congress_of_Women" title="wikilink">International Congress of Women</a>, or the Women's Peace Congress.

Many of the women's peace proposals were used by Wilson in his <a href="Fourteen_Points" title="wikilink">Fourteen Points</a>, and the women's efforts helped encourage the later founding of the <a href="League_of_Nations" title="wikilink">League of Nations</a>.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a></p>

<p>During the war, with British suffragists abstaining from taking militant action, British statesmen such as Prime Minister <a href="Henry_Asquith" title="wikilink">Henry Asquith</a> began to have a change of heart regarding their right to vote. In early 1917, a clause which provided suffrage for property-holding women aged 30 years and older was debated, and in June it was attached to the bill which would later become the <a href="Representation_of_the_People_Act_1918" title="wikilink">Representation of the People Act 1918</a>. Suffragists who were pacifists and suffragists who were nationalistic could both congratulate themselves for winning this incremental victory. Ten years later, full voting equality with men was achieved in the UK with the <a href="Representation_of_the_People_Act_1928" title="wikilink">Representation of the People Act 1928</a>.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a></p>
