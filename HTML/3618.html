<p><strong>John Calvin Coolidge, Jr.</strong> (<a href="July_4" title="wikilink">July 4</a> <a href="1872" class="uri" title="wikilink">1872</a> â€“ <a href="January_5" title="wikilink">January 5</a> <a href="1933" class="uri" title="wikilink">1933</a>) was the 30th <a href="President_of_the_United_States" title="wikilink">President of the United States</a> (1923-1929). A lawyer from <a href="Vermont" class="uri" title="wikilink">Vermont</a>, Coolidge worked his way up the ladder of <a href="Massachusetts" class="uri" title="wikilink">Massachusetts</a> state politics, eventually becoming governor of that state. His actions during the <a href="Boston_Police_Strike" title="wikilink">Boston Police Strike</a> of 1919 thrust him into the national spotlight. He was elected as the 29th <a href="Vice_President_of_the_United_States" title="wikilink">Vice President</a> in 1920 and succeeded to the Presidency upon the death of <a href="Warren_G._Harding" title="wikilink">Warren G. Harding</a>. He was elected in his own right in 1924, and gained a reputation as a <a href="fiscal_conservative" title="wikilink">small-government conservative</a>.</p>
<p>In many ways, Coolidge's style of governance was a throwback to the passive Presidency of the nineteenth century.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> He restored public confidence in the White House after the <a href="Warren_G._Harding#Administrative_Scandals" title="wikilink">scandals</a> of his predecessor's administration, and left office with considerable popularity.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> As his biographer later put it, &quot;he embodied the spirit and hopes of the <a href="middle_class" title="wikilink">middle class</a>, could interpret their longings and express their opinions. That he did represent the genius of the average is the most convincing proof of his strength.&quot;<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>Many would later criticize Coolidge as a part of a general criticism of <a href="laissez-faire" title="wikilink">laissez-faire government</a>, especially in times of economic hardship, such as the <a href="Great_Depression" title="wikilink">Great Depression</a>.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> His reputation underwent a renaissance during the <a href="Ronald_Reagan" title="wikilink">Reagan</a> administration,<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> but the ultimate assessment of his presidency is still divided between those who approve of his reduction of the size of government and those who believe the federal government should be more involved in regulating the economy.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>

<p>John Calvin Coolidge Jr. was born in <a href="Plymouth,_Vermont" title="wikilink">Plymouth</a>, <a href="Windsor_County,_Vermont" title="wikilink">Windsor County</a>, <a href="Vermont" class="uri" title="wikilink">Vermont</a>, on <a href="July_4" title="wikilink">July 4</a> <a href="1872" class="uri" title="wikilink">1872</a>, the only U.S President to be born on the <a href="Independence_Day_(United_States)" title="wikilink">4th of July</a>. He was the elder of two children of John Calvin, Sr. and Victoria Moor Coolidge. His only sister, Abigail Gratia, died of <a href="appendicitis" class="uri" title="wikilink">appendicitis</a>.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p><img src="CoolidgeAmherst.png" title="fig:Coolidge as an Amherst undergraduate" alt="Coolidge as an Amherst undergraduate" width="180" />The Coolidge family had deep roots in <a href="New_England" title="wikilink">New England</a>. His earliest American ancestor, John Coolidge, emigrated from <a href="Cambridge" class="uri" title="wikilink">Cambridge</a>, <a href="England" class="uri" title="wikilink">England</a>, around 1630 and settled in <a href="Watertown,_Massachusetts" title="wikilink">Watertown</a>, <a href="Massachusetts" class="uri" title="wikilink">Massachusetts</a>.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> Coolidge's great-great-grandfather, also named John Coolidge, was an American army officer in the <a href="American_Revolution" title="wikilink">American Revolution</a>, and was one of the first <a href="Board_of_Selectmen" title="wikilink">selectmen</a> of the town of Plymouth Notch.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> Most of Coolidge's direct ancestors were farmers. The more well-known Coolidges, such as architect <a href="Charles_Allerton_Coolidge" title="wikilink">Charles Allerton Coolidge</a>, and diplomat <a href="Archibald_Cary_Coolidge" title="wikilink">Archibald Cary Coolidge</a>, were descended from other branches of the family that had stayed in Massachusetts.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<p>Coolidge's grandfather, Calvin Galusha Coolidge, held some local government offices in Plymouth and was best remembered as a man with &quot;a fondness for practical jokes.&quot;<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> His grandmother, Sarah Brewer Coolidge, was also of New England stock. It is through this ancestor that Coolidge claimed to be descended in part from <a href="American_Indians" title="wikilink">American Indians</a>.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> Coolidge's father was also a farmer, but spent some time as a schoolteacher and <a href="justice_of_the_peace" title="wikilink">justice of the peace</a>.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> His mother, Victoria Josephine Moor Coolidge, was the daughter of another Plymouth Notch farmer.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> Coolidge's mother was chronically ill, possibly suffering from <a href="tuberculosis" class="uri" title="wikilink">tuberculosis</a>, and died young in 1884, but his father lived to see Coolidge become President.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="education">Education</h3>
<p>Coolidge attended <a href="St._Johnsbury_Academy" title="wikilink">St. Johnsbury Academy</a> in Vermont before entering <a href="Amherst_College" title="wikilink">Amherst College</a> in nearby <a href="Massachusetts" class="uri" title="wikilink">Massachusetts</a>.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> He dropped <em>John</em> from his name upon graduating from college. At Amherst, Coolidge became a member of the Fraternity of <a href="Phi_Gamma_Delta" title="wikilink">Phi Gamma Delta</a> and joined the College Republicans in 1892.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> While there, Coolidge met <a href="Dwight_Morrow" title="wikilink">Dwight Morrow</a>, who would become a life-long friend.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> He graduated <em><a href="cum_laude" title="wikilink">cum laude</a></em> in 1895.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> At graduation, Coolidge was selected by his classmates to compose and read the Grove Oration, a humorous speech traditionally given during the graduation ceremony.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>

<p>After graduating from Amherst, at his father's urging, Coolidge moved to <a href="Northampton,_Massachusetts" title="wikilink">Northampton, Massachusetts</a> to take up the practice of law. Avoiding the costly alternative of attending a <a href="law_school" title="wikilink">law school</a>, Coolidge followed the more common practice at the time of apprenticing with a local firm, Hammond &amp; Field. John C. Hammond and Henry P. Field, both Amherst graduates themselves, introduced Coolidge to the law practice in the county seat of <a href="Hampshire_County,_Massachusetts" title="wikilink">Hampshire County</a>. In 1897, Coolidge was admitted to the bar. With his savings and a small inheritance from his grandfather, Coolidge was able to open his own law office in Northampton in 1898, where he practiced transactional law, believing that he served his clients best by staying out of court. As his reputation as a hard-working and diligent attorney grew, local banks and other businesses began to retain his services.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="marriage-and-family">Marriage and family</h3>
<p>In 1905, Coolidge met and married <a href="Grace_Coolidge" title="wikilink">Grace Anna Goodhue</a>, a local schoolteacher and fellow Vermonter. They were opposites in personality: she was talkative and fun-loving, and Coolidge was quiet and serious.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> Not long after their marriage Coolidge handed her a bag with fifty-two pairs of socks in it, all of them full of holes. Grace's reply was &quot;Did you marry me to darn your socks?&quot; Without cracking a smile and with his usual seriousness, Calvin answered, &quot;No, but I find it mighty handy.&quot;<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> They had two sons; <a href="John_Coolidge" title="wikilink">John Coolidge</a>, born in 1906, and Calvin Jr., born in 1908.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> The marriage was, by most accounts, a happy one.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> As Coolidge wrote in his <em>Autobiography</em>, &quot;We thought we were made for each other.

<h3 id="city-offices">City Offices</h3>
<p>The <a href="Republican_Party_(United_States)" title="wikilink">Republican Party</a> was dominant in New England in Coolidge's time, and he followed Hammond's and Field's example by becoming active in local politics.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> Coolidge campaigned locally for Republican Presidential candidate <a href="William_McKinley" title="wikilink">William McKinley</a> in 1896, and the next year he was selected to be a member of the Republican City Committee.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> In 1898, he won election to the <a href="City_Council" title="wikilink">City Council</a> of Northampton, placing second in a ward where the top three candidates were elected.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> The position offered no salary, but gave Coolidge experience in the political world.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> In 1899, he declined renomination, running instead for <a href="Solicitor#United_States" title="wikilink">City Solicitor</a>, a position elected by the City Council. He was elected for a one-year term in 1900, and reelected in 1901.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> This position gave Coolidge more experience as a lawyer, and paid a salary of $600.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> In 1902, the city council selected a Democrat for city solicitor, and Coolidge returned to an exclusively private practice.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> Soon thereafter, however, the <a href="Court_clerk" title="wikilink">clerk of courts</a> for the county died, and Coolidge was chosen to replace him. The job paid well, but barred him from practicing law, so he only remained the clerk for one year.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> The next year, 1904, Coolidge met with his only defeat before the voters, losing an election to the Northampton <a href="Board_of_Education" title="wikilink">school board</a>. When told that some of his neighbors voted against him because he had no children in the schools he would govern, Coolidge replied &quot;Might give me time!&quot;<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a></p>

<p><img src="CoolidgeLtGov.png" title="fig:Calvin and Grace Coolidge, about 1918" alt="Calvin and Grace Coolidge, about 1918" width="200" />In 1906, the local Republican committee nominated Coolidge for election to the state <a href="Massachusetts_House_of_Representatives" title="wikilink">House of Representatives</a>. He won a close victory over the incumbent <a href="Democratic_Party_(United_States)" title="wikilink">Democrat</a>, and reported to <a href="Boston" class="uri" title="wikilink">Boston</a> for the 1907 session of the <a href="Massachusetts_General_Court" title="wikilink">Massachusetts General Court</a>.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> In his freshman term, Coolidge served on minor committees and, although he usually voted with the party, was known as a <a href="Progressive_Party_(United_States,_1912)" title="wikilink">Progressive Republican</a>, voting in favor of such measures as <a href="women&#39;s_suffrage" title="wikilink">women's suffrage</a> and the <a href="Seventeenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution" title="wikilink">direct election of Senators</a>.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> Throughout his time in Boston, Coolidge found himself allied primarily with the western <a href="Winthrop_Murray_Crane" title="wikilink">Winthrop Murray Crane</a> faction of the state Republican Party, as against the <a href="Henry_Cabot_Lodge" title="wikilink">Henry Cabot Lodge</a>-dominated eastern faction.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> In 1907, he was elected to a second term. In the 1908 session, Coolidge was more outspoken, but was still not one of the leaders in the legislature.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a></p>
<p>Instead of vying for another term in the state house, Coolidge returned home to his growing family and ran for <a href="mayor" class="uri" title="wikilink">mayor</a> of Northampton when the incumbent Democrat retired. He was well-liked in the town, and defeated his challenger by a vote of 1,597 to 1,409.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> During his first term (1910 to 1911), he increased teachers' salaries and retired some of the city's debt while still managing to effect a slight tax decrease.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> He was renominated in 1911, and defeated the same opponent by a slightly larger margin.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1911, the <a href="Massachusetts_Senate" title="wikilink">State Senator</a> for the Hampshire County area retired and encouraged Coolidge to run for his seat for the 1912 session. He defeated his Democratic opponent by a large margin.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> At the start of that term, Coolidge was selected to be chairman of a committee to arbitrate the &quot;<a href="Bread_and_Roses" title="wikilink">Bread and Roses</a>&quot; strike by the workers of the <a href="American_Woolen_Company" title="wikilink">American Woolen Company</a> in <a href="Lawrence,_Massachusetts" title="wikilink">Lawrence, Massachusetts</a>.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> After two tense months, the company agreed to the workers' demands in a settlement the committee proposed.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a> The other major issue for Republicans that year was the <a href="United_States_presidential_election,_1912" title="wikilink">party split</a> between the progressive wing, which favored <a href="Theodore_Roosevelt" title="wikilink">Theodore Roosevelt</a>, and the conservative wing, which favored <a href="William_Howard_Taft" title="wikilink">William Howard Taft</a>.

<p>Coolidge's speech was well-received, and he attracted some admirers on its account.<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a> Towards the end of the term, many of them were proposing his name for nomination to lieutenant governor.

<p>Coolidge also wielded the <a href="veto" class="uri" title="wikilink">veto</a> pen as governor.

<p>At the <a href="1920_Republican_National_Convention" title="wikilink">1920 Republican Convention</a>, most of the delegates were selected by state party conventions, not primaries.

<h3 id="silent-cal">&quot;Silent Cal&quot;</h3>
<p>The Vice Presidency did not carry many official duties, but President Harding invited Coolidge to attend cabinet meetings, the first Vice President to do so.<a href="#fn92" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref92"><sup>92</sup></a> He gave speeches around the country, but none were especially noteworthy.<a href="#fn93" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref93"><sup>93</sup></a></p>
<p>As Vice President, Coolidge and his vivacious wife <a href="Grace_Coolidge" title="wikilink">Grace</a> were invited to quite a few parties, where the legend of &quot;Silent Cal&quot; was born. It was from this time most of the jokes and anecdotes at his expense originate. Although Coolidge was known to be a skilled and effective public speaker, in private he was a man of few words and was therefore commonly referred to as &quot;Silent Cal.&quot; A possibly apocryphal story has it that <a href="Dorothy_Parker" title="wikilink">Dorothy Parker</a>, seated next to him at a dinner, said to him, &quot;Mr. Coolidge, I've made a bet against a fellow who said it was impossible to get more than two words out of you.&quot; His famous reply: &quot;You lose.&quot;<a href="#fn94" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref94"><sup>94</sup></a> It was also Parker who, upon learning that Coolidge had died reportedly remarked, &quot;How can they tell?&quot;<a href="#fn95" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref95"><sup>95</sup></a> Coolidge often seemed uncomfortable among fashionable Washington society; when asked why he continued to attend so many of their dinner parties, he replied &quot;Got to eat somewhere.&quot;<a href="#fn96" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref96"><sup>96</sup></a></p>
<p>As President, Coolidge's reputation as a quiet man continued. &quot;The words of a President have an enormous weight,&quot; he would later write, &quot;and ought not to be used indiscriminately.&quot;<a href="#fn97" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref97"><sup>97</sup></a> Coolidge was not unaware of his stiff reputation; indeed, he cultivated it. &quot;I think the American people want a solemn ass as a President,&quot; he once told <a href="Ethel_Barrymore" title="wikilink">Ethel Barrymore</a>, &quot;and I think I'll go along with them.&quot;<a href="#fn98" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref98"><sup>98</sup></a></p>

Coolidge is shown above holding a ceremonial hat given to him by the Smoki people of Prescott, Arizona." width="200" /> Coolidge did not seek renomination; he announced his decision to reporters, in writing, with typical terseness: &quot;I do not choose to run for President in 1928.&quot;<a href="#fn146" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref146"><sup>146</sup></a> After allowing them to take that in, Coolidge elaborated. &quot;If I take another term, I will be in the White House till 1933 &lt;U+2026&gt; Ten years in Washington is longer than any other man has had it&lt;U+2014&gt;too long!&quot;<a href="#fn147" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref147"><sup>147</sup></a> In his memoirs, Coolidge explained his decision not to run: &quot;The Presidential office takes a heavy toll of those who occupy it and those who are dear to them. While we should not refuse to spend and be spent in the service of our country, it is hazardous to attempt what we feel is beyond our strength to accomplish.&quot;<a href="#fn148" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref148"><sup>148</sup></a> After leaving office, he and Grace returned to Northampton, where he wrote his memoirs. The Republicans retained the White House in 1928 in the person of Coolidge's <a href="Secretary_of_Commerce" title="wikilink">Secretary of Commerce</a>, <a href="Herbert_Hoover" title="wikilink">Herbert Hoover</a>.</p>
<p>Coolidge had been lukewarm on the choice of Hoover as his successor, but he realized that unless he publicly blocked the popular Commerce Secretary at the convention, the nomination was his, and Coolidge had no desire to split the party by openly opposing Hoover.<a href="#fn149" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref149"><sup>149</sup></a> The delegates did consider nominating Vice President Charles Dawes to be Hoover's running mate, but the convention selected Senator <a href="Charles_Curtis" title="wikilink">Charles Curtis</a> instead.<a href="#fn150" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref150"><sup>150</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="radio-and-film">Radio and film</h3>
<p>Despite his reputation as a quiet and even reclusive politician, Coolidge made use of the new medium of radio and made radio history several times while President. He made himself available to reporters, giving 529 press conferences, meeting with reporters more regularly than any President before or since.<a href="#fn151" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref151"><sup>151</sup></a> His <a href="inauguration" class="uri" title="wikilink">inauguration</a> was the first presidential inauguration broadcast on radio. On <a href="6_December" title="wikilink">6 December</a> <a href="1923" class="uri" title="wikilink">1923</a>, Coolidge was the first President whose address to Congress was broadcast on radio.<a href="#fn152" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref152"><sup>152</sup></a> On <a href="12_February" title="wikilink">12 February</a> <a href="1924" class="uri" title="wikilink">1924</a>, he became the first President of the United States to deliver a political speech on radio. On <a href="11_August" title="wikilink">11 August</a> <a href="1924" class="uri" title="wikilink">1924</a>, Coolidge was filmed on the White House lawn by <a href="Lee_De_Forest" title="wikilink">Lee De Forest</a> in DeForest's <a href="Phonofilm" class="uri" title="wikilink">Phonofilm</a> <a href="sound-on-film" class="uri" title="wikilink">sound-on-film</a> process, becoming the first President to appear in a sound film.
