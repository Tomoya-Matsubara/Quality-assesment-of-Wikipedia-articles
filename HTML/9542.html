<p><strong>Forest Hills</strong> is an affluent neighborhood located in the <a href="New_York_City" title="wikilink">New York City</a> <a href="Borough_(New_York_City)" title="wikilink">borough</a> of <a href="Queens" class="uri" title="wikilink">Queens</a>.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> Originally, the area was referred to as &quot;Whitepot&quot;.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>

Starting in 1896, the landscaping firm of Olmsted, Olmsted &amp; Eliot was contracted to provide a plan for the park.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1906, Brooklyn attorney Cord Meyer bought abutting land made up of six farms (those of Ascan Bakus, Casper Joost-Springsteen, Horatio N. Squire, Abram V. S. Lott, Sarah V. Bolmer, and James Van Siclen) and then renamed the aggregated 600 acres Forest Hills. In 1909, <a href="Margaret_Olivia_Slocum_Sage" title="wikilink">Margaret Sage</a>, who founded the <a href="Russell_Sage_Foundation" title="wikilink">Russell Sage Foundation</a>, bought  of land from the Cord Meyer Development Company. The stated plan was to build good low-income housing and improve living conditions of the working poor, but the resulting huge property values made this claim totally impractical. <a href="Grosvenor_Atterbury" title="wikilink">Grosvenor Atterbury</a>, a renowned architect, was given the commission to design Forest Hills Gardens. The neighborhood was planned on the model of the <a href="garden_city_movement" title="wikilink">garden communities</a> of England. As a result, there are many <a href="Tudorbethan_architecture" title="wikilink">Tudor-style</a> homes in Forest Hills, some more sprawling ones located in Forest Hills Gardens while most are located in the Cord-Meyer section (loosely bounded by 68th Avenue on the north; 72nd Road on the south; 108th Street on the west; and Grand Central Parkway on the east).<ref></p>

<p></ref> The construction of this area used a <a href="prefabricated_building" title="wikilink">prefabricated building</a> technique; each house was built from approximately 170 standardized <a href="precast_concrete" title="wikilink">precast concrete</a> panels, fabricated off-site and positioned by crane.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> In 1913, the <a href="West_Side_Tennis_Club" title="wikilink">West Side Tennis Club</a> moved from <a href="Manhattan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Manhattan</a> to Forest Hills Gardens. The <a href="U.S._Open_(tennis)" title="wikilink">U.S. Open</a> and its predecessor national championships were held there until 1978, making Forest Hills synonymous with <a href="tennis" class="uri" title="wikilink">tennis</a> for generations.</p>
<h2 id="description">Description</h2>
<p><img src="Forest_Hills_Gardens,_Queens,_NY.jpg" title="fig:Forest Hills Gardens is part of Forest Hills" alt="Forest Hills Gardens is part of Forest Hills" width="300" /> <img src="Church_in_the_Gardens_UCC_50_Ascan_Av_jeh.jpg" title="fig:A church in Forest Hills Gardens" alt="A church in Forest Hills Gardens" width="300" /></p>
<p>The southern part of Forest Hills contains a particularly diverse mixture of upscale housing, ranging from single-family houses, attached townhouses, and both low-rise and high-rise apartment buildings. South of the <a href="Long_Island_Rail_Road" title="wikilink">Long Island Rail Road</a>, the Forest Hills Gardens area is a private community that features some of the most expensive residential properties in Queens County. It was subject to <a href="restrictive_covenant" title="wikilink">restrictive covenants</a> until the 1970s, which contained no explicit economic, social or racial restrictions<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> even if &quot;working-class people&quot; were said to be excluded by Eric P. Nash in a 2002 <em>New York Times</em> article, in his review of <em>A Modern Arcadia</em>.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> Forest Hills Gardens was named &quot;Best Community&quot; in 2007 by <em>Cottage Living Magazine</em>.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> The adjacent Van Court community also contains a number of detached single-family homes. There are also attached townhouses near the Westside Tennis Center and detached frame houses near Metropolitan Avenue. Finally, there are a number of apartment buildings scattered throughout the community. The most notable high-rise apartment buildings are The Continental on 108th St, Kennedy House, the Pinnacle, and the Windsor.</p>
<p>On the northwestern edge of Forest Hills, on 62nd Drive and 108th Street, immediately adjacent to the <a href="Long_Island_Expressway" title="wikilink">Long Island Expressway</a> is a <a href="Forest_Hills_Co-op_Houses" title="wikilink">NYCHA (New York City Housing Authority) low-income housing project</a> that provoked controversy<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> among the residents in the more prestigious areas of Forest Hills when it was constructed in the early 1970s. In fact, the high-rise (eighteen stories) building accidentally burned to the ground three or four times during that period.</p>
<p>The north side of Forest Hills is home to the Cord Meyer community, which contains detached single-family homes. <a href="Teardown_(real_estate)" title="wikilink">Teardowns</a> and their replacement with larger single family residences has had a significant impact on the architectural integrity of the area.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> However, the <a href="Bukharian_Jewish" title="wikilink">Bukharian Jewish</a> community, whose members have settled in the area in large numbers since the late 1990s, advocating the changes say the bigger homes are needed for their large extended families.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<p>The main thoroughfare is <a href="Queens_Boulevard" title="wikilink">Queens Boulevard</a>, which is very wide. <a href="Metropolitan_Avenue" title="wikilink">Metropolitan Avenue</a> is known for its antique shops. Forest Hills is easily accessible by subway, rail, bus and car. The commercial heart of Forest Hills is a mile-long stretch of Austin Street between Yellowstone Boulevard and Ascan Avenue: the latter thoroughfare was named in 1909 by developer Frederick Backus for his own father, Ascan Backus, II.</p>
<p>Forest Hills was once the home of the <a href="U.S._Open_(tennis)" title="wikilink">U.S. Open</a> tennis tournament. The event was held at the <a href="West_Side_Tennis_Club" title="wikilink">West Side Tennis Club</a> before it moved to the <a href="USTA_National_Tennis_Center" title="wikilink">USTA National Tennis Center</a> in <a href="Flushing_Meadows_Park" title="wikilink">Flushing Meadows Park</a>, about  away. When the Open was played at the tennis stadium, the tournament was commonly referred to merely as <em>Forest Hills</em>, just as <a href="The_Championships,_Wimbledon" title="wikilink">All-England Lawn Tennis Association Championships</a> are referred to, simply, as <a href="The_Championships,_Wimbledon" title="wikilink">Wimbledon</a>. In the 2001 motion picture, <em><a href="The_Royal_Tenenbaums" title="wikilink">The Royal Tenenbaums</a></em>, <a href="Luke_Wilson" title="wikilink">Luke Wilson</a>'s character plays a tennis match at the West Side Tennis Club in Forest Hills. A pivotal scene in <a href="Alfred_Hitchcock" title="wikilink">Alfred Hitchcock</a>'s 1951 film <em><a href="Strangers_on_a_Train_(film)" title="wikilink">Strangers on a Train</a></em>, in which the main character (played by <a href="Farley_Granger" title="wikilink">Farley Granger</a>) is a professional tennis player, features a lengthy championship game at the Club, with distinctive shots of the surrounding community.  The Tennis Stadium, which hosted numerous music concerts including The Beatles after the U.S. Open departed for Flushing Meadows, resumed hosting music concerts during the summer of 2013 when the British rock band Mumford &amp; Sons played there to an overflowing crowd. Stadium officials have said they will now host as many as six music or cultural events at the Stadium each season.</p>
