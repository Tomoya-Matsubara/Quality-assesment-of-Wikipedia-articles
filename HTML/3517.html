<h2 id="early-life">Early life</h2>
<p>Kyle Busch's first driving lessons came at the age of 6 when he drove around the <a href="cul-de-sac" class="uri" title="wikilink">cul-de-sac</a> of his family's Las Vegas neighborhood in a makeshift <a href="go-kart" class="uri" title="wikilink">go-kart</a>. Although he was too small to reach the throttle, Busch still was able to pick up the basics from his father Tom, who controlled the gas pedal as his young son steered the kart. Throughout his childhood, Busch spent many hours as an apprentice to his father and older brother <a href="Kurt_Busch" title="wikilink">Kurt</a> in the family garage learning to build and repair race cars. By the age of 10, he was a full-fledged mechanic and served as <a href="Car_chief" title="wikilink">crew chief</a> of his older brother's <a href="Modified_racing#Dwarf_cars" title="wikilink">dwarf car</a> team. In addition to working on cars, Busch enjoyed forms of martial arts, including karate.</p>
<p>In 1998, shortly after his 13th birthday, Busch's driving career officially began. From 1999 through 2001, Busch earned more than 65 wins in <a href="legends_car_racing" title="wikilink">legends car racing</a> as he racked up two track championships at <a href="Las_Vegas_Motor_Speedway" title="wikilink">Las Vegas Motor Speedway</a>'s &quot;Bullring&quot; before moving to <a href="late_model" title="wikilink">late models</a>. He captured 10 victories in late model competition at the Bullring in 2001.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="early-career">Early career</h2>
<p>At the age of 16, Busch began competing in the <a href="NASCAR" class="uri" title="wikilink">NASCAR</a> Craftsman Truck Series (now <a href="Camping_World_Truck_Series" title="wikilink">Camping World Truck Series</a>) for <a href="Roush_Racing" title="wikilink">Roush Racing</a> as a replacement for <a href="Nathan_Haseleu" title="wikilink">Nathan Haseleu</a> and <a href="Chuck_Hossfeld" title="wikilink">Chuck Hossfeld</a>, who were released midway in the <a href="2001_NASCAR_Craftsman_Truck_Series" title="wikilink">2001</a> season. He made his debut at <a href="O&#39;Reilly_Raceway_Park_at_Indianapolis" title="wikilink">Indianapolis Raceway Park</a>, impressing many people with a 9th place finish. In his second race at <a href="Chicago_Motor_Speedway" title="wikilink">Chicago Motor Speedway</a>, he was leading with less than 20 laps to go until his truck ran out of fuel with 12 laps to go.</p>
<p>Busch was the fastest in practice for a 2001 Craftsman Truck Series race at <a href="California_Speedway" title="wikilink">California Speedway</a> in Fontana, CA, when he was ejected from the track by <a href="Champ_Car" title="wikilink">CART</a> officials because the <a href="American_Racing_Wheels_200" title="wikilink">American Racing Wheels 200</a> was part of a CART weekend featuring the <a href="Marlboro_(cigarette)" title="wikilink">Marlboro</a> 500 CART FedEx Championship Series event.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> Marlboro threw Busch out of the garage because of an interpretation of the <a href="Master_Settlement_Agreement" title="wikilink">Master Settlement Agreement</a> of 1998, prohibiting people under 18 years of age in participating in events sponsored by tobacco companies. He earned two top-10 finishes in six starts in the #99 <a href="Eldon" class="uri" title="wikilink">Eldon</a> <a href="Ford_F-Series" title="wikilink">Ford F-150</a> in what had been scheduled to be a full-season campaign for 2002.</p>
<p>Six weeks after the incident, NASCAR imposed a minimum age of 18 years starting in 2002 to prevent future incidents from happening again, because <a href="Winston_(cigarette)" title="wikilink">Winston</a> was the premier series sponsor at the time. When the age requirements were put in place, Busch switched from NASCAR to the <a href="American_Speed_Association" title="wikilink">American Speed Association</a> (ASA) series, finishing 8th in points.</p>
<p>In 2002, Busch graduated a year early with honors from <a href="Durango_High_School_(Nevada)" title="wikilink">Durango High School</a> in Las Vegas, Nevada to focus on his driving career. That same year, he made his debut in the <a href="ARCA_RE/MAX_Series" title="wikilink">ARCA RE/MAX Series</a> at <a href="Lowe&#39;s_Motor_Speedway" title="wikilink">Lowe's Motor Speedway</a>, finishing twelfth in the #22 <a href="WP_Motorsports" title="wikilink">WP Motorsports</a> Chevrolet.</p>
<p>In 2003, Busch signed a <a href="driver_development_contract" title="wikilink">driver development contract</a> with <a href="Hendrick_Motorsports" title="wikilink">Hendrick Motorsports</a>, and drove seven ARCA races in their #87 <a href="ditech" class="uri" title="wikilink">ditech</a> entry. He won his first two races at <a href="Nashville_Superspeedway" title="wikilink">Nashville Superspeedway</a> and <a href="Kentucky_Speedway" title="wikilink">Kentucky Speedway</a>, and won his most recent ARCA race the following year at Daytona.</p>
<p>He is often nicknamed &quot;Shrub&quot;, since he is the younger brother of NASCAR driver Kurt Busch and a small bush is called a shrub.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>

<h3 id="section-1">2004</h3>
<p>Busch's first full-time season began in 2004, as he competed in the Lowe's car vacated by <a href="Brian_Vickers" title="wikilink">Brian Vickers</a>, who had moved up to the NEXTEL Cup series.

<h3 id="section-4">2007</h3>

When both were interviewed Kurt retorted that he was not going to buy from Kellog's (Kyle's sponsor); and claimed that Kyle was fighting dirty. Kyle claimed that Kurt was not giving him room as he was supposed to. Kyle and Kurt argued publicly when the race was over and when they could not reconcile the next week, they were both put on watch by NASCAR officials and separated for 6 months to avoid incidents or feuds before or after the races. After the long memorable season was over, during a Busch family reunion for Thanksgiving, Kurt and Kyle reconciled by the persuasion of their grandmother.</p>
<p>Meanwhile in June 2007, Busch announced his plans to leave Hendrick Motorsports after the <a href="2007_NASCAR_Nextel_Cup_Series" title="wikilink">2007 season</a>. The two sides had been working on a contract extension but eventually agreed mutually to part ways.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> It was announced the same day that <a href="Dale_Earnhardt_Jr." title="wikilink">Dale Earnhardt Jr.</a> would be replacing him at Hendrick Motorsports. However, days later Busch stated that he had no idea he was going to be released.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> It was announced two months later that Busch had chosen <a href="Joe_Gibbs_Racing" title="wikilink">Joe Gibbs Racing</a> for his team in the <a href="2008_NASCAR_Sprint_Cup_Series" title="wikilink">2008</a> season. He replaced <a href="J._J._Yeley" title="wikilink">J. J.

<h3 id="section-5">2008</h3>

He followed that with another 4th place finish in the <a href="Auto_Club_500" title="wikilink">Auto Club 500</a>. As a result, he took the lead in the points standings for the first time in his career. Busch led 173 of the 325 laps and won the <a href="Kobalt_Tools_500" title="wikilink">Kobalt Tools 500</a> at the <a href="Atlanta_Motor_Speedway" title="wikilink">Atlanta Motor Speedway</a>. It was the 5th career win for Busch, and the first Sprint Cup points race victory for <a href="Toyota" class="uri" title="wikilink">Toyota</a>. Then Kyle Busch nearly won Richmond but settled for second after a late incident. For the final 55 laps Kyle Busch battled <a href="Dale_Earnhardt_Jr." title="wikilink">Dale Earnhardt Jr.</a> who previously replaced him at Hendrick Motorsports. With 10 laps left the dominant car Denny Hamlin ran out of gas handing the lead to Earnhardt who was about to win the race and end his winless streak. However with 3 laps left, Earnhardt Jr. pulled a block on Kyle causing Earnhardt Jr. to spin out. Clint Bowyer slipped by Kyle to take the lead and on the final restart Kyle was unable to get by Bowyer leading to his second place finish. However because of Earnhardt's popularity; the fans were upset with Kyle. Even though it was clear that Earnhardt Jr. just wrecked himself and that it was just two drivers racing and refusing to lose, Earnhardt's crew and fans were not pleased with Busch. The next day Earnhardt Jr. absolved Kyle but nonetheless to this day the #88 fans do not think the contact was accidental.</p>
<p>Busch then won another races at Talladega, Darlington, Dover, Sonoma, Daytona, Chicagoland and Watkins Glen.</p>
<p>On August 23 at <a href="Bristol_Motor_Speedway" title="wikilink">Bristol Motor Speedway</a>, Carl Edwards tapped Busch's rear bumper on lap 470/500 to take the lead Busch had owned for most of the race. After the race, Busch pulled alongside to bump into Edwards repeatedly, to &quot;let him know I didn't appreciate the way he passed me.&quot;<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> Edwards responded by spinning out Busch. The following week, NASCAR placed Edwards and Busch on probation for the off-track argument.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
<p>Busch's hopes for his first championship were dashed by two consecutive DNF's at <a href="New_Hampshire_Motor_Speedway" title="wikilink">New Hampshire Motor Speedway</a> and <a href="Dover_International_Speedway" title="wikilink">Dover International Speedway</a>, wiping out his 20-point lead and dropping him to 12th in points. However, Busch ralled back with top fives and gained two more spots to close out his first season with JGR 10th in points. Busch had a career-high eight wins and twenty-one top-tens that season.</p>
<p>Busch also ran <a href="2008_NASCAR_Nationwide_Series" title="wikilink">30 Nationwide races</a>, and along with <a href="Denny_Hamlin" title="wikilink">Denny Hamlin</a>, <a href="Joey_Logano" title="wikilink">Joey Logano</a> and <a href="Tony_Stewart" title="wikilink">Tony Stewart</a> helped win the 2008 Nationwide series <a href="NASCAR_Championship" title="wikilink">Owners Championship</a> for <a href="Joe_Gibbs_Racing" title="wikilink">Joe Gibbs Racing</a> for the number 20 car.

<p><img src="Kyle_Busch_2009.jpg" title="fig:Kyle Busch on pit road at Charlotte Motor Speedway." alt="Kyle Busch on pit road at Charlotte Motor Speedway." width="200" /> On February 12 <a href="2009_NASCAR_Sprint_Cup_Series" title="wikilink">2009</a>, Busch won the second Gatorade Duel at Daytona. This was the first qualifying race win for Busch, allowing him to start fourth in the <a href="2009_Daytona_500" title="wikilink">51st Daytona 500</a>. Busch led 88 laps, leading the most for the second year in a row. However, he was taken out on lap 125 when <a href="Dale_Earnhardt_Jr." title="wikilink">Dale Earnhardt Jr.</a> turned into <a href="Brian_Vickers" title="wikilink">Brian Vickers</a>' car, starting a chain reaction crash that sent Vickers into Busch's car, wrecking it, and several other lead lap cars. The following week, Busch made <a href="NASCAR" class="uri" title="wikilink">NASCAR</a> history, becoming the first person in the history of the sport to win races in two of NASCAR's touring series in the same day by winning the <a href="San_Bernardino_County_200" title="wikilink">San Bernardino County 200</a> in the afternoon and the <a href="Stater_Brothers_300" title="wikilink">Stater Brothers 300</a> in the evening.

After the race, he and his brother exchanged a long, passionate hug, perhaps signaling the end of their feud. Darrell Waltrip was quoted as saying it was the &quot;sweetest thing he had ever seen&quot;.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> Busch then won his second race of the season at <a href="Bristol_Motor_Speedway" title="wikilink">Bristol Motor Speedway</a>. Busch was the first to win three Cup races in 2009, collecting his third win at <a href="Richmond_International_Raceway" title="wikilink">Richmond International Raceway</a>. With his win in the <a href="2009_Crown_Royal_400" title="wikilink">2009 Crown Royal Presents the Russ Friedman 400</a>, Busch joined <a href="Cale_Yarborough" title="wikilink">Cale Yarborough</a> and <a href="Matt_Kenseth" title="wikilink">Matt Kenseth</a> as the only drivers to win on their birthday.</p>

Busch took another hard hit in the driver's side from teammate <a href="Joey_Logano" title="wikilink">Joey Logano</a> before spinning to a stop in the infield. Stewart won the race but apologized in victory circle for the wreck.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a></p>
<p>On August 22, 2009, Kyle Busch won his fourth race of the season at Bristol Motor Speedway. Busch would finsh 5th at Richmond, but he missed the Chase for the Sprint Cup by 8 points. <a href="Brian_Vickers" title="wikilink">Brian Vickers</a> would get the last spot.</p>
<p><img src="KyleBuschToyotaMilwaukeeMile2009.jpg" title="fig:2009 Nationwide championship car at Milwaukee" alt="2009 Nationwide championship car at Milwaukee" /> In the Nationwide Series on November 21, 2009, Kyle Busch won both the <a href="Ford_300" title="wikilink">Nationwide Series finale</a> and his first NASCAR Championship, becoming the first driver since Sam Ard in 1983 to win the season finale and the championship in the same year.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a><a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a><a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> Busch finished the <a href="2009_NASCAR_Nationwide_Series" title="wikilink">2009 NASCAR Nationwide Series</a> season with 9 wins, 25 top 5's, and 30 top 10's.</p>
<p>Busch's <a href="2009_NASCAR_Camping_World_Truck_Series" title="wikilink">2009</a> season in the newly-renamed Camping World Truck Series started off much like the 2008 season had. Finishing second in the <a href="NextEra_Energy_Resources_250" title="wikilink">NextEra Energy Resources 250</a> at <a href="Daytona_International_Speedway" title="wikilink">Daytona International Speedway</a> to <a href="Todd_Bodine" title="wikilink">Todd Bodine</a>, as they had finished in 2008, Busch then dominated the <a href="San_Bernardino_County_200" title="wikilink">San Bernardino County 200</a> a week later at <a href="Auto_Club_Speedway" title="wikilink">Auto Club Speedway</a>, winning the pole and leading 95 of 100 laps. Bodine finished second &lt;U+2013&gt; again, the same as the two had finished in this race the year before. The following race, the <a href="American_Commercial_Lines_200" title="wikilink">American Commercial Lines 200</a> at <a href="Atlanta_Motor_Speedway" title="wikilink">Atlanta Motor Speedway</a>, Busch again won the pole, and overcame an ill-handling truck as well as transmission problems to take the lead in the closing laps. Busch was able to hold off <a href="Kevin_Harvick" title="wikilink">Kevin Harvick</a> to win the race for the second year in a row. It was his fourth win in five Truck Series starts at Atlanta. He finished the season with 7 victories.</p>
<h3 id="section-7">2010</h3>
<p>On December 11, 2009, Kyle Busch announced the formation of <a href="Kyle_Busch_Motorsports" title="wikilink">Kyle Busch Motorsports</a> that will field two teams in the NASCAR Camping World Truck Series in 2010. KBM will have two truck teams running in the series.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> The #18 Toyota Tundra was to be driven by Busch part-time, with the remainder of races to be driven by <a href="Brian_Ickler" title="wikilink">Brian Ickler</a>. The second truck, the #56 Toyota Tundra, was to be driven by <a href="Tayler_Malsam" title="wikilink">Tayler Malsam</a>. However, after both Ickler and Malsam accepted jobs to drive in the <a href="Nationwide_Series" title="wikilink">Nationwide Series</a>, and while suffering financial troubles due to lack of sponsorship, Busch withdrew the #56 from competition and has hired various drivers such as <a href="Johnny_Benson" title="wikilink">Johnny Benson</a> and <a href="Kasey_Kahne" title="wikilink">Kasey Kahne</a> as well as <a href="Brian_Ickler" title="wikilink">Brian Ickler</a> to fill in on #18 when Busch wasn't driving it himself.</p>
<p>On August 21, 2010, Kyle Busch became the first driver in NASCAR history to win all 3 NASCAR tour events in one weekend. This was achieved at Bristol with a win for the Camping World Truck Series, Nationwide Series, and the Sprint Cup Series. Busch started 19th in his Doublemint Toyota. He worked his way to the front, but Jimmie Johnson and Tony Stewart led him until a caution came out. Stewart checked up, allowing Tony Raines in the #37 car to hit his rear bumper, losing him the lead and the race. On the restart, Busch passed Johnson for the lead, but soon after Johnson was turned into the wall by Juan Pablo Montoya. Kyle Busch continued on to win the race leading the most laps and setting yet another record. Now Kyle is one of the most dominant forces in the Sprint Cup, Nationwide and Camping World Series. In the Nationwide series he won 13 races in 2010, breaking the all-time record for most Nationwide Series wins in a season previously held by <a href="Sam_Ard" title="wikilink">Sam Ard</a> with 10. On October 30, 2010, Busch scored a controversial victory in the Camping World Truck Series <a href="Mountain_Dew_250" title="wikilink">Mountain Dew 250</a> at <a href="Talladega_Superspeedway" title="wikilink">Talladega Superspeedway</a>, which saw Busch's truck wiggle below the track's double-yellow &quot;out-of-bounds&quot; line as Busch made the winning pass on second-place finisher <a href="Aric_Almirola" title="wikilink">Aric Almirola</a> at the finish line by 0.002 seconds. On November 7, 2010, on lap 160, Busch spun on turn 1, which makes his tires worn out. He went to change fresh tires when he crossed the pit exit first, but got too fast, so he had to go back to pit road. The in-car camera caught Busch flip the finger to the officials, so he had to park his car on his pit road for two laps. He would finish in 32nd place 2 laps down. In Camping World Truck Series he won 8 races and his team, Kyle Busch Motorsports, won the Owners championship.</p>
<h3 id="section-8">2011</h3>
<p><img src="Kyle_Busch,_2011_Goody&#39;s_Fast_Relief_500.jpg" title="fig:Busch&#39;s car during the 2011 Goody&#39;s Fast Relief 500" alt="Busch&#39;s car during the 2011 Goody&#39;s Fast Relief 500" /> For 2011, Busch's Speedweeks started off on a low note, as he crashed out of the <a href="2011_Budweiser_Shootout" title="wikilink">Budweiser Shootout</a> along with <a href="Joey_Logano" title="wikilink">Joey Logano</a>. Busch also raced in all 3 NASCAR events at Daytona, finishing 5th in the Truck Race, 7th in the Nationwide race, and 8th in the Daytona 500. The next week at Phoenix, Busch dominated the Truck race and led every single lap in the Bashas' Supermarkets 200. Busch swept the March weekend at Bristol, his second sweep of a Bristol weekend. On April 30, 2011, Busch won his third straight spring race at Richmond International Raceway, capturing his 2nd win in the 2011 season.</p>
<p>Following an on-track incident with <a href="Kevin_Harvick" title="wikilink">Kevin Harvick</a> during and after the <a href="Southern_500" title="wikilink">Southern 500</a> at <a href="Darlington_Speedway" title="wikilink">Darlington Speedway</a>, Busch was fined $25,000 and put on probation for 4 races (plus the All-Star Race).<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a></p>
<p>Following the <a href="O&#39;Reilly" class="uri" title="wikilink">O'Reilly</a> Auto Parts 250, pit reporter Ray Dunlap <a href="Twitter" title="wikilink">tweeted</a>, &lt;U+201C&gt;Hot news from the track. Grandpa Childress put a whipping on Kyle Busch in the truck garage&quot;. Dunlap mistakenly referred to him as &quot;kubu&quot;, which is Twitter shorthand for Kurt Busch, who was not involved.</p>
<p>It is believed that Busch's post-race bump of Joey Coulter, who drove the #22 Richard Childress Racing-owned <a href="Chevrolet_Silverado" title="wikilink">Chevrolet Silverado</a>, was in response to Coulter passing Busch on the final lap. About 30 minutes after the race, witnesses say that Childress came up to Busch, put him in a head lock and started punching him. Busch, who was still on probation at the time of the incident, did not violate his probation. Childress, however, was fined $150,000 and placed on NASCAR probation until December 31, 2011. Busch said in an interview that he did not hit Coulter's truck intentionally and that it was a congratulatory bump. He also said that he would pay Childress for the damage on Coulter's truck.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a></p>
<p>On July 9, Busch won the very first Sprint Cup race at <a href="Kentucky_Motor_Speedway" title="wikilink">Kentucky Motor Speedway</a> by holding off David Reutimann and Jimmie Johnson. He led the most laps and had a good finish at Watkins Glen with 3rd place when with three laps to go he turned too far in turn 1 and let <a href="Brad_Keselowski" title="wikilink">Brad Keselowski</a> and eventual race winner <a href="Marcos_Ambrose" title="wikilink">Marcos Ambrose</a> pass him. August 21, 2011, a week after his heartbreak at Watkins Glen, Busch won the Pure Michigan 400 for his 4th victory of the 2011 season and became the first man to clinch a spot in the Chase. <a href="Jeff_Gordon" title="wikilink">Jeff Gordon</a> was the class of the field late, but after a late race debris caution, Busch beat Gordon and <a href="Matt_Kenseth" title="wikilink">Matt Kenseth</a> out of the pits and held off <a href="Jimmie_Johnson" title="wikilink">Jimmie Johnson</a> for the win.</p>
<p>On August 26, 2011 Busch won the <a href="Nationwide_Series" title="wikilink">Nationwide Series</a> at <a href="Bristol_Motor_Speedway" title="wikilink">Bristol Motor Speedway</a> surpassing <a href="Mark_Martin" title="wikilink">Mark Martin</a> for the most Nationwide series wins ever, with 50, and also simultaneously became the first driver to win three consecutive races at <a href="Bristol_Motor_Speedway" title="wikilink">Bristol Motor Speedway</a> in the <a href="Nationwide_Series" title="wikilink">Nationwide Series</a>. He also won this race in one of the closest finishes in series history, as he won the race by 0.019 seconds over teammate <a href="Joey_Logano" title="wikilink">Joey Logano</a>. Busch also almost contended to win the truck race at Bristol until a controversial incident occurred on lap 100. <a href="Elliott_Sadler" title="wikilink">Elliott Sadler</a> made contact that resulted with Busch hitting the wall and ripping off his wheel. The others slowed down waiting for a caution but by the time it came out Busch using the &quot;Have at it, boys&quot; rule, had already waited for Sadler to come back around and intentionally spun Sadler away from the top ten positions. Elliott Sadler received little damage but his hopes to win were ended. On pit road Busch in his interview said in front of watching KHI members that he believed that since Sadler was driving mostly for KHI that year, Sadler had the whole incident planned with Kevin Harvick who was Busch's #1 rival in the cup series. An unrepentant Sadler maintained that he did not intentionally crash Busch since he was not even driving for KHI that night and both drivers left Bristol without any penalties.</p>
<p>On November 4, 2011, Busch was involved in an incident during the 2011 <a href="WinStar_World_Casino_350K" title="wikilink">WinStar World Casino 350K</a> at <a href="Texas_Motor_Speedway" title="wikilink">Texas Motor Speedway</a>. Going 3 wide with the lapped truck of <a href="Johnny_Chapman" title="wikilink">Johnny Chapman</a>, Busch made contact with series regular and Kevin Harvick Inc. championship contender <a href="Ron_Hornaday,_Jr." title="wikilink">Ron Hornaday</a>, bringing out a caution. Busch rushed to Hornaday's truck during the caution and deliberately turned him into the outside wall, smashing Hornaday's truck and ending Hornaday's title hopes. NASCAR immediately <a href="racing_flag#The_black_flag" title="wikilink">black-flagged</a> Busch for the rest of the race and Busch came onto pit road with a negative response to his interview. The next morning, NASCAR president <a href="Mike_Helton" title="wikilink">Mike Helton</a> announced that Busch would remain parked for the remainder of the weekend, including the 2011 <a href="O&#39;Reilly_Auto_Parts_Challenge" title="wikilink">O'Reilly Auto Parts Challenge</a> and the <a href="2011_AAA_Texas_500" title="wikilink">2011 AAA Texas 500</a>. NASCAR took this action under rules that allow it to park a driver in order to ensure the &quot;orderly conduct of the event.&quot; Helton and Gibbs mutually agreed to this action, though NASCAR would have been within its rights to park Busch on its own. Although it had the effect of a disqualification, it is not considered one for NASCAR rules purposes and is therefore not appealable. Denny Hamlin and Michael McDowell stepped up to replace Busch in both the Nationwide Series and Sprint Cup series races, respectively. It was the first time since what is now the <a href="Camping_World_Truck_Series" title="wikilink">Camping World Truck Series</a> was launched in 1995 that NASCAR has parked a driver across all three national series, and only the third cross-series sanction in NASCAR's 64-year history.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> NASCAR's action mathematically eliminated Busch from contention for the Sprint Cup, though any realistic chance of him winning it ended earlier in the Chase.</p>
<p>Later that day, Busch issued an apology to his fans, sponsors and teammates, saying that the Texas incident was &quot;certainly a step backward.&quot;<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> He also apologized to Ron Hornaday and his workers and staff of his team KBM immediately offered Hornaday to drive for them next year to apologize. Hornaday stated that he appreciated the offer, but chose to stay loyal to <a href="Chevrolet" class="uri" title="wikilink">Chevrolet</a> and signed a deal with <a href="Joe_Denette_Motorsports" title="wikilink">Joe Denette Motorsports</a>.</p>
<p>On November 7, NASCAR fined Busch $50,000 for &quot;actions detrimental to stock car racing.&quot; While it lifted the parking directive, it placed Busch on probation for the rest of the year, saying that he would be suspended indefinitely if he commits another offense detrimental to stock car racing or disrupts the orderly conduct of a NASCAR event during the 2011 season.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a></p>
<p>On November 10, ESPN's David Newton reported that <a href="M&amp;M&#39;s" class="uri" title="wikilink">M&amp;M's</a>, the primary sponsor for Busch's Sprint Cup team, refused to sponsor the 18 for the last few races as a result of Busch's behavior in Texas. Newton said that this has led Joe Gibbs Racing to open talks with <a href="Aric_Almirola" title="wikilink">Aric Almirola</a> about taking over for Busch for the last two Sprint Cup races.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> Earlier, <a href="Z-Line_Designs" title="wikilink">Z-Line Designs</a> asked that Hamlin take over as the driver for Busch's Nationwide Series team.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> Later that night, however, it was decided that Busch would remain as the driver for the Sprint Cup team, but secondary sponsor <a href="Interstate_Batteries" title="wikilink">Interstate Batteries</a> was sole sponsor for the final two races of 2011.

Busch and his future teammate <a href="Matt_Kenseth" title="wikilink">Matt Kenseth</a> were also the best average finishers at both Talladega races for the year (Busch finishing second in the spring and third in the fall, with Kenseth finishing third in the spring and winning in the fall). At <a href="Watkins_Glen_International" title="wikilink">Watkins Glen International</a>, Busch was leading on the last lap when he slipped in <a href="Bobby_Labonte" title="wikilink">Bobby Labonte</a>'s oil. Second-place <a href="Brad_Keselowski" title="wikilink">Brad Keselowski</a> also slipped in the oil and spun Busch in the esses. <a href="Marcos_Ambrose" title="wikilink">Marcos Ambrose</a>, third at the time of the white, got by Keselowski in the final corners and won the race. Though Busch ended up being bumped out of the Chase by <a href="Jeff_Gordon" title="wikilink">Jeff Gordon</a> and was winless for the fall, he had seven top-5 finishes in the ten Chase races, led the most laps at three of them, and had eight top-10s (4th at Chicagoland, 7th at Dover, 3rd at Talladega, 5th at Charlotte, 2nd at Martinsville, 3rd at Texas and Phoenix, and 4th at Homestead).

<p>Kyle Busch put his NNS #54 Monster Energy team to be run under Joe Gibbs Racing for the 2013 NNS season and renewed his cup deal with Joe Gibbs Racing.</p>
<p>In 2013, Busch crashed out of the Sprint Unlimited early on lap 14, but recovered to win the Second Budweiser Duel; Busch got the lead after Jeff Gordon was penalized for speeding on pit road. Busch said in victory lane that he won with help of a push from <a href="Matt_Kenseth" title="wikilink">Matt Kenseth</a> in the final laps to hold off <a href="Kasey_Kahne" title="wikilink">Kasey Kahne</a>. His win in the Duel put him in third spot in the <a href="2013_Daytona_500" title="wikilink">2013 Daytona 500</a>. Although Busch ran as high as second place during the 500, his day ended on lap 150 with engine failure, merely laps after Kenseth had retired with engine failure.</p>
<p>Busch qualified pole, and led 142 of 200 laps in his win in <a href="Dollar_General_200" title="wikilink">Dollar General 200</a> in Phoenix Raceway in the Nationwide Series. The win ends the win drought since <a href="Virginia_529_College_Savings_250" title="wikilink">Virginia 529 College Savings 250</a> in Richmond International Raceway in September 2011, the second-longest in his career.

He almost lost the win in the final laps when former Gibbs teammate <a href="Joey_Logano" title="wikilink">Joey Logano</a> overtook him. But in the final lap, Logano and Busch's teammate <a href="Denny_Hamlin" title="wikilink">Denny Hamlin</a> were fighting for the lead, and when they drove hard into turn 3, Busch took advantage of an opening to slip past both cars before they touched and crashed, holding off <a href="Dale_Earnhardt,_Jr." title="wikilink">Dale Earnhardt, Jr.</a> coming back to the finish line. This snapped for Busch a 31-race winless streak with his victory and had given Joe Gibbs their first victory at Fontana. Of trivial note, leading up to the win, Busch had finished at Fontana in a reverse style; 3rd in 2011, 2nd in 2012 and then first in 2013.</p>
<p>Busch won his second Sprint Cup pole of the season at Texas, narrowly overtaking elder brother Kurt to do so. Once again, Busch dominated and completed a successful weekend sweep: after winning the Sprint Cup pole, he won the Nationwide race on Friday night after overtaking <a href="Brad_Keselowski" title="wikilink">Brad Keselowski</a> in the final 15 laps; causing him to take the NNS championship lead from Regan Smith by 7 points, although this was in owner's points as Busch is racing for driver points in the Sprint Cup Series. In the Cup race on Saturday night, Busch started on pole, and led 171 of 334 laps (close to 50% of the race), assuming the win by beating <a href="Martin_Truex,_Jr." title="wikilink">Martin Truex, Jr.</a> off pit road during pit stops under the last caution flag of the night. This was Busch's 26th Sprint Cup win, and his seventh Nationwide/Sprint Cup weekend sweep, second of 2013. Of trivial note, Busch also ended up joining a family of drivers including <a href="Ned_Jarrett" title="wikilink">Ned Jarrett</a>, <a href="Rusty_Wallace" title="wikilink">Rusty Wallace</a> and <a href="Kasey_Kahne" title="wikilink">Kasey Kahne</a> who had all won a race in their 300th start.</p>
<p>Busch's form didn't carry into the next weekend at Kansas though, as he was crashed in both the Truck and Sprint Cup races. In the Cup race, he qualified in the top-ten, but he spun out early on lap 5. Later, on lap 102, Busch spun again and then collected <a href="Joey_Logano" title="wikilink">Joey Logano</a>. He finished 38th.</p>
<p>At Richmond, he wasn't having a better time. He started 8th and finished 24th.</p>
<p>At Talladega, Busch started 13th, but was involved in another crash and finished in 37th. It was the third straight race that Busch finished outside the top 20.</p>
<p>At Darlington, Busch started 3rd and lead the most laps with 265 and was on his way to winning. In the waning laps, car owner <a href="Joe_Gibbs" title="wikilink">Joe Gibbs</a>' cars were 1-2-3 (Busch, <a href="Matt_Kenseth" title="wikilink">Matt Kenseth</a> and <a href="Denny_Hamlin" title="wikilink">Denny Hamlin</a>). With 13 laps to go, Busch's teammate, Kenseth, closed in on him. Busch's car then started getting a little bit slower and <a href="Understeer_and_oversteer" title="wikilink">tighter</a> (understeer) as Kenseth overtook him. Busch fell back and finished in 6th place. His teammates, Kenseth and Hamlin, finished 1-2. It was later learned that Busch's right rear tire had a cut in it and he finished the race with only 12 pounds of air in it. Busch moved up 2 spots into 8th place in the standings.</p>
<p>At Charlotte, in the <a href="Nationwide_Series" title="wikilink">Nationwide Series</a>, Busch was back in the winner's circle at <a href="History_300" title="wikilink">History 300</a> at <a href="Charlotte_Motor_Speedway" title="wikilink">Charlotte Motor Speedway</a>, having already won in the same circuit in <a href="North_Carolina_Education_Lottery_200_(Charlotte)" title="wikilink">North Carolina Education Lottery 200</a> for the truck series in the previous weekend.</p>
<p>The next day at the <a href="Coca_Cola_600" title="wikilink">Coca Cola 600</a> in the <a href="Sprint_Cup_Series" title="wikilink">Sprint Cup Series</a>, Busch had qualified in 8th, and was leading when an unusual incident occurred on lap 121: With Busch leading, one of the cables to a FOX Sports cable camera on the front straightaway snapped and fell on the track in the turn 4 grandstands, injuring 10 spectators. Busch ran over it, as did <a href="Mark_Martin" title="wikilink">Mark Martin</a>, <a href="Marcos_Ambrose" title="wikilink">Marcos Ambrose</a> and several others, giving severe damage. A red flag was waved, but while under normal red flag conditions, crews are not allowed to touch the cars, enough cars took damage from hitting the cable that NASCAR gave all teams 15 minutes to check for damage and do any repairs if needed. At the restart, all cars returned to the position they were in. On lap 258, Busch's engine blew, ending his night and finishing him in 38th place. This dropped him to 11th place in the points standings. However, when interviewed, he comended NASCAR for giving a 15 minute repair period for the pit crews.</p>
<p>At Dover, Busch qualified in 3rd. He had a strong car and led the most laps with 150. He finished 4th, to move him up two positions to 9th place in the standings.</p>
<p>At Pocono, Busch started 9th due to rain. Busch stayed up in the top 10 all day. He mostly was battling his brother <a href="Kurt_Busch" title="wikilink">Kurt Busch</a>. Kyle finished 6th, beating Kurt who finished 7th. Busch moved up to 7th place in the standings.</p>
<p>At Michigan, Busch started 9th. However he was listed in 34th place on a restart early in the race for passing Tony Stewart on pit road during a caution. He spent the rest of the race moving through the field back into the top five finishing in 4th place and moving up to 6th place in the standings.</p>

<p>On July 24, 2011, Busch won $31,900 at the 38th annual <a href="TD_Bank,_N.A." title="wikilink">TD Bank</a> 250 presented by New England Dodge Dealers in Oxford, Maine. Busch defeated the young Austin Theriault, Nick Sweet and two-time TD Bank 250 winner Eddie MacDonald.

The 2011 event was Kyle Busch's first ever TD Bank 250 win in three attempts. (He also entered the race in 2005 and 2006.) Busch was excited about the race win saying &quot;I've had this one on my list of big races that I wanted to win and now that I've done it, it feels great - it was everything I thought it would be.&quot; Kyle drove his own <a href="Kyle_Busch_Motorsports" title="wikilink">Kyle Busch Motorsports</a> number 51 late model with sponsorship from <a href="HP_Hood" title="wikilink">HP Hood</a>'s Heluva Good!
