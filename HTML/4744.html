<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<p>Livingston's history dates back to 1699 when 101 <a href="Newark,_New_Jersey" title="wikilink">Newark</a> settlers wanted to move westward. They set up a committee to negotiate from <a href="Lenape" title="wikilink">Lenni Lenape</a> <a href="Native_Americans_in_the_United_States" title="wikilink">Native Americans</a> for the purchase of the <a href="Horseneck_Tract" title="wikilink">Horseneck Tract</a> which today includes Livingston and eight other municipalities to the north. Between 1698 and 1702, the rules for property ownership were unclear. There were many disputes between settlers and the English <a href="Proprietary_colony" title="wikilink">proprietors</a>. For some unknown reasons, the Newark settlers did not obtain a grant from the proprietors before negotiating with the <a href="Native_Americans_in_the_United_States" title="wikilink">natives</a>. They finally obtained the <a href="deed" class="uri" title="wikilink">deed</a> directly from Lenni Lenape in 1702 for &lt;U+00A3&gt;130. The settlements began until around 1740s as the dispute between the proprietors and the settlers continued.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p>The dispute came to a breaking point in September 1745 when the <a href="East_Jersey" title="wikilink">East Jersey</a> proprietors began to evict a settler only six months after a house fire in Newark completely destroyed the original deed, which was the only evidence of the purchase.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> During that period, William Livingston who was one of the few landed <a href="Aristocracy" title="wikilink">aristocrats</a> joined the settlers against the proprietors. Livingston owned land around today's south western corner of the Township of Livingston. His land, like other settlers, was levied with <a href="Quit-rent" title="wikilink">quit rents</a> in the amount 40 <a href="shilling" title="wikilink">shillings</a> per acre. He defended many settlers who were jailed for refusing to pay the quit rents.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<p>This series of events caused the settlers, led by Timothy Meeker, to form a group to riot against the British government. The Horseneck Riots lasted for 10 years from 1745 to 1755. The group was also one of the first <a href="Militia_(United_States)" title="wikilink">colonial militia</a> which had periodic battles for 32 years leading up to the <a href="American_Revolutionary_War" title="wikilink">Revolutionary War</a> as the group joined the <a href="Continental_Army" title="wikilink">Continental Army</a> in 1776.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<p>After the <a href="American_Revolutionary_War" title="wikilink">Revolutionary War</a>, more permanent settlements took place with the first school built in 1783. In 1811, a petition was filed to incorporate the township from about 100 people who lived in seven distinct areas: Centerville (separated to become <a href="Roseland,_New_Jersey" title="wikilink">Roseland</a>, in 1908), Cheapside (now <a href="Livingston_Mall" title="wikilink">Livingston Mall</a>), Morehousetown (now Livingston Circle), Northfield (now Northfield Center), Squiretown (now the Cerebral Palsy Institute of New Jersey on Old Road), Teedtown (now Livingston Center), and Washington Place (now near the border with <a href="Millburn,_New_Jersey" title="wikilink">Millburn</a>). On February 5, 1813, the township was officially incorporated. The first town meeting was held on the same day and they decided to run the township by a <a href="Township_(New_Jersey)" title="wikilink">Township Committee</a> system.</p>
<p>During the 1800s, <a href="lumber" class="uri" title="wikilink">lumber</a> and <a href="farming" class="uri" title="wikilink">farming</a> were major industries in the town. <a href="Shoemaking" class="uri" title="wikilink">Shoemaking</a> and <a href="dairy" class="uri" title="wikilink">dairy</a> became major industries during and after the <a href="American_Civil_War" title="wikilink">Civil War</a> respectively. However, the population grew slowly because it was not easily accessible. Mt. Pleasant Avenue &lt;U+2013&gt; which was one of the first <a href="Toll_road" title="wikilink">turnpikes</a> in New Jersey &lt;U+2013&gt; was the only primary access to the town through <a href="stagecoach" title="wikilink">stagecoaches</a>.</p>
<p>The population grew quickly after the 1920s when automobiles became more accessible. As a suburb of Newark, the town experienced many housing developments especially after <a href="World_War_II" title="wikilink">World War II</a> with its peak in 1970 of more than thirty thousand residents. During this growth period, many services were organized including volunteer Fire Department in 1922, first regular <a href="Livingston_Police_Department" title="wikilink">Livingstone Police</a> chief in 1929, a Planning Commission in 1930, two hospitals opened in 1959 and 1960, new public library in 1961, and new municipal complex in 1963.</p>
<p>The last surviving <a href="Harrison_Cider_Apple" title="wikilink">Harrison Cider Apple</a> tree, the most famous of the 18th century Newark cider apples<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> was rescued from extinction in 1976 in Livingston.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<p>Today, some 28,000 people enjoy a suburban lifestyle with close proximity to New York City. Its school system and other programs have been drawing new residents to the town. Its population has become increasingly diverse while the residents maintain the tradition of community volunteerism.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a><a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
