<p>The history of <a href="Ancient_Rome" title="wikilink">ancient Rome</a> - originally a city-state of <a href="History_of_Italy_during_Roman_times" title="wikilink">Italy</a>, and later an empire covering much of Eurasia and North Africa from the ninth century BC to the fifth century AD - was often closely entwined with its <a href="military_history" title="wikilink">military history</a>. The core of the <strong>campaign history of the Roman military</strong> is the account of the <a href="Roman_military" title="wikilink">Roman military</a>'s land battles, from its initial defence against and subsequent conquest of the city's hilltop neighbours in the <a href="Italian_peninsula" title="wikilink">Italian peninsula</a>, to the ultimate struggle of the <a href="Western_Roman_Empire" title="wikilink">Western Roman Empire</a> for its existence against invading <a href="Hun" title="wikilink">Huns</a>, <a href="Vandals" class="uri" title="wikilink">Vandals</a> and <a href="Germanic_Wars" title="wikilink">Germanic tribes</a> after the empire's split into <a href="Eastern_Roman_Empire" title="wikilink">East</a> and <a href="Western_Roman_Empire" title="wikilink">West</a>. Despite the later Empire's encompassing of lands around the periphery of the <a href="Mediterranean" title="wikilink">Mediterranean sea</a>, naval battles were typically less significant than land battles to the military history of Rome, due to its largely unchallenged dominance of the sea following fierce naval fighting during the <a href="First_Punic_War" title="wikilink">First Punic War</a>.</p>
<p>The Roman army battled first against its tribal neighbours and <a href="Etruria" title="wikilink">Etruscan</a> towns within Italy, and later came to dominate much of the Mediterranean and further afield, including the provinces of <a href="Roman_Britain" title="wikilink">Britannia</a> and <a href="Asia_Minor" title="wikilink">Asia Minor</a> at the Empire's height. As with most ancient civilisations, Rome's military served the triple purposes of securing its borders, exploiting peripheral areas through measures such as imposing tribute on conquered peoples, and maintaining internal order.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> From the outset, Rome's military typified this pattern and the majority of Rome's campaigns were characterised by one of two types: the first is the territorial <a href="expansionist" class="uri" title="wikilink">expansionist</a> campaign, normally begun as a counter-offensive,<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> in which each victory brought subjugation of large areas of territory and allowed Rome to grow from a small town to the <a href="List_of_largest_empires" title="wikilink">third largest empire</a> in the ancient world, encompassing almost one quarter of the world's total population;<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> the second is the <a href="civil_war" title="wikilink">civil war</a> of which examples plagued Rome right from its foundation to its eventual demise.</p>
<p>Roman armies were not invincible, despite their formidable reputation and host of victories:<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> over the centuries the Romans &quot;<em>produced their share of incompetents</em>&quot;<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> who led Roman armies into catastrophic defeats. Nevertheless, it was generally the fate of even the greatest of Rome's enemies, such as <a href="Pyrrhus" class="uri" title="wikilink">Pyrrhus</a> and <a href="Hannibal" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hannibal</a>,<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> to win the battle but lose the war. The history of Rome's campaigning is, if nothing else, a history of obstinate persistence overcoming appalling losses.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a><a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>

<p>Rome is almost unique in the ancient world in that its history, military and otherwise, is documented often in great detail almost from the city's very foundation right through to its eventual demise. Although some histories have sadly been lost, such as <a href="Trajan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Trajan</a>'s account of the <a href="Dacian_Wars" title="wikilink">Dacian Wars</a>, and others, such as Rome's earliest histories, are at least semi-apocryphal, nevertheless the extant histories of Rome's military history are extensive.</p>
<p>The very earliest history, from the time of Rome's founding as a small tribal village<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a>, through to the downfall of Rome's kings, is the least well preserved. This is because, whilst the early Romans were literate to some degree,<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> they either lacked the will to record their history at this time, or else such histories as they did record were lost<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Although the Roman historian <a href="Livy" class="uri" title="wikilink">Livy</a> lists a series of seven kings of early Rome in his work <em>Ab Urbe Condita</em>, from its establishment and through its earliest years, the first four 'kings' (<a href="Romulus" class="uri" title="wikilink">Romulus</a>,<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> <a href="Numa" class="uri" title="wikilink">Numa</a>,<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a><a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> <a href="Tullus_Hostilius" title="wikilink">Tullus Hostilius</a><a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a><a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> and <a href="Ancus_Marcius" title="wikilink">Ancus Marcius</a><a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a><a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a>) are almost certainly entirely apocryphal. <a href="Michael_Grant" title="wikilink">Grant</a> and others argue that prior to the Etruscan kingdom of Rome was established under the traditionally fifth king <a href="Tarquinius_Priscus" title="wikilink">Tarquinius Priscus</a><a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a>, Rome would have been led by a religious leader of some sort.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> Very little is known of Rome's military history during this era and what history has come down to us is of a legendary rather than factual nature. Traditionally, Romulus fortified one of the first-settled of Rome's seven hills, the <a href="Palatine_Hill" title="wikilink">Palatine Hill</a>, after founding the city and Livy states that shortly after its founding Rome was &quot;<em>equal to any of the surrounding cities in her prowess in war</em>&quot;.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a></p>

<p>The first campaign, if such it can be called, that was fought by the Romans in this legendary account is their seizing of the women from several nearby villages habited by the <a href="Sabine" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sabine</a> people for purposes of &quot;begetting their children&quot;,<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> an event known as <a href="The_Rape_of_the_Sabine_Women" title="wikilink">The Rape of the Sabine Women</a>.

<p>Although sources disagree, it is possible that Rome itself was twice invested by Etruscan armies in this period, first in around 509 BC under the recently-overthrown king Tarquinius Superbus,<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a><a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> and again in 508 BC under the Etruscan <a href="Lars_Porsenna" title="wikilink">Lars Porsenna</a>.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a><a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a><a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a><a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a></p>

<p>However, Rome still controlled only a very limited area and the affairs of Rome were minor even to those in Italy: the remains of Veii, for instance, lie entirely within modern Rome's suburbs<a href="#fn70" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a> and Rome's affairs were only just coming to the attention of the Greeks, the dominant cultural force at the time.<a href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a> At this point the bulk of Italy remained in the hands of <a href="Latin" class="uri" title="wikilink">Latin</a>, <a href="Sabine" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sabine</a>, <a href="Samnite" class="uri" title="wikilink">Samnite</a> and other peoples in the central part of Italy, <a href="Ancient_Greeks" title="wikilink">Greek</a> colonies to the south, and, notably, the <a href="Celts" title="wikilink">Celtic people</a>, including the <a href="Gauls" class="uri" title="wikilink">Gauls</a>, to the north. The Celtic civilisation at this time was vibrant and growing in strength and territory, and stretched, if incohesively, across much of mainland Europe. It is at the hands of the Gallic Celts that Rome suffered a humiliating defeat that temporarily set back its advance and was to imprint itself upon the Roman consciousness.</p>
<h3 id="celtic-invasion-of-italia-390-387-bc">Celtic invasion of Italia (390-387 BC)</h3>

<p>By 390 BC, several Gallic tribes had begun invading Italy from the north as their culture expanded throughout Europe. Most of this was unknown to the Romans at this time, who still had purely local security concerns, but the Romans were alerted when a particularly warlike tribe,<a href="#fn72" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref72"><sup>72</sup></a><a href="#fn73" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref73"><sup>73</sup></a> the <a href="Senones" class="uri" title="wikilink">Senones</a>,<a href="#fn74" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref74"><sup>74</sup></a> invaded the Etruscan province of Siena from the north and attacked the town of <a href="Clusium" class="uri" title="wikilink">Clusium</a><a href="#fn75" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref75"><sup>75</sup></a>, not far from Rome's sphere of influence. The Clusians, overwhelmed by the size of the enemy in numbers and ferocity, called on Rome for help. Perhaps unintentionally<a href="#fn76" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref76"><sup>76</sup></a> the Romans found themselves not just in conflict with the Senones, but their primary target<a href="#fn77" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref77"><sup>77</sup></a>. The Romans met them in pitched battle at the <a href="Battle_of_the_Allia" title="wikilink">Battle of Allia River</a><a href="#fn78" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref78"><sup>78</sup></a><a href="#fn79" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref79"><sup>79</sup></a> around 390-387 BC. The Gauls defeated the Roman army of around 15,000 troops<a href="#fn80" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref80"><sup>80</sup></a> and proceeded to pursue the fleeing Romans back to Rome itself and partially sacked the town<a href="#fn81" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref81"><sup>81</sup></a><a href="#fn82" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref82"><sup>82</sup></a> before being either driven off<a href="#fn83" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref83"><sup>83</sup></a><a href="#fn84" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref84"><sup>84</sup></a> or bought off.<a href="#fn85" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref85"><sup>85</sup></a><a href="#fn86" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref86"><sup>86</sup></a></p>
<p>Now that the Romans and Gauls had blooded one another, intermittent warfare was to continue between the two in Italy for more than two centuries, including the <a href="Battle_of_the_Anio" title="wikilink">Battle of the Anio</a>,<a href="#fn87" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref87"><sup>87</sup></a> the <a href="Battle_of_Lake_Vadimo" title="wikilink">Battle of Lake Vadimo</a>,<a href="#fn88" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref88"><sup>88</sup></a> the<a href="Battle_of_Faesulae" title="wikilink">Battle of Faesulae</a> in <a href="225_BC" title="wikilink">225 BC</a>, the <a href="Battle_of_Telamon" title="wikilink">Battle of Telamon</a> in <a href="224_BC" title="wikilink">224 BC</a>, the <a href="Battle_of_Clastidium" title="wikilink">Battle of Clastidium</a> in <a href="222_BC" title="wikilink">222 BC</a>, the <a href="Battle_of_Cremona_(200_BC)" title="wikilink">Battle of Cremona</a> in <a href="200_BC" title="wikilink">200 BC</a>, the <a href="Battle_of_Mutina_(194_BC)" title="wikilink">Battle of Mutina</a> in <a href="194_BC" title="wikilink">194 BC</a>, the <a href="Battle_of_Arausio" title="wikilink">Battle of Arausio</a> in <a href="105_BC" title="wikilink">105 BC</a>, and the <a href="Battle_of_Vercellae" title="wikilink">Battle of Vercellae</a> in <a href="101_BC" title="wikilink">101 BC</a>.

<p><img src="Pietra_bismantova.jpg" title="fig:Apennine hills around Samnium" alt="Apennine hills around Samnium" width="305" />   After recovering surprisingly swiftly from the sack of Rome<a href="#fn89" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref89"><sup>89</sup></a>, the Romans immediately resumed their expansion within Italy. Despite their successes so far, their mastery of the whole of Italy was by no means assured at this point: the <a href="Samnites" class="uri" title="wikilink">Samnites</a> were a people just as martial<a href="#fn90" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref90"><sup>90</sup></a> and as rich<a href="#fn91" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref91"><sup>91</sup></a> as the Romans and with an objective of their own of securing more lands in the fertile<a href="#fn92" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref92"><sup>92</sup></a> Italian plains on which Rome itself lay.<a href="#fn93" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref93"><sup>93</sup></a> The <a href="First_Samnite_War" title="wikilink">First Samnite War</a> of between 343 BC and 341 BC that followed widespread Samnite incursions into Rome's territory<a href="#fn94" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref94"><sup>94</sup></a> was a relatively short affair: the Romans beat the Samnites in both the <a href="Battle_of_Mount_Gaurus" title="wikilink">Battle of Mount Gaurus</a> in <a href="342_BC" title="wikilink">342 BC</a> and the <a href="Battle_of_Suessola" title="wikilink">Battle of Suessola</a> in <a href="341_BC" title="wikilink">341 BC</a> but were forced to withdraw from the war before they could pursue the conflict further due to the revolt of several of their Latin allies in the <a href="Latin_War" title="wikilink">Latin War</a>.<a href="#fn95" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref95"><sup>95</sup></a><a href="#fn96" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref96"><sup>96</sup></a></p>
<p>Rome was therefore forced to contend by around 340 BC against both Samnite incursions into their territory and, simultaneously, in a bitter war against their former allies.

<p>The <a href="Second_Samnite_War" title="wikilink">Second Samnite War</a> , from 327 BC to 304 BC, was a much longer and more serious affair for both the Romans and Samnites,<a href="#fn101" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref101"><sup>101</sup></a> running for over twenty years and incorporating twenty-four battles<a href="#fn102" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref102"><sup>102</sup></a> that led to massive casualties on both sides.

The Romans then proved victorious at the <a href="Battle_of_Bovianum" title="wikilink">Battle of Bovianum</a> and the tide turned strongly against the Samnites from 314 BC onwards, leading them to sue for peace with progressively less generous terms. By 304 BC the Romans had effectively annexed the greater degree of the Samnite territory, founding several colonies. This pattern of meeting agression in force and almost inadvertently gaining territory in strategic counter-attacks was to become a common feature of Roman military history.</p>
<p>Seven years after their defeat, with Roman dominance of the area looking assured, the Samnites rose again and defeated the Romans at the <a href="Battle_of_Camerinum" title="wikilink">Battle of Camerinum</a> in <a href="298_BC" title="wikilink">298 BC</a>, to open the <a href="Third_Samnite_War" title="wikilink">Third Samnite War</a>. With this success in hand they managed to bring together a coalition of several previous enemies of Rome, all of whom were probably keen to prevent any one faction dominating the entire region. The army that faced the Romans at the <a href="Battle_of_Sentinum" title="wikilink">Battle of Sentinum</a><a href="#fn107" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref107"><sup>107</sup></a> in <a href="295_BC" title="wikilink">295 BC</a> therefore included Samnites, Gauls, Etruscans and Umbrians.<a href="#fn108" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref108"><sup>108</sup></a> When the Roman army won a convincing victory over these combined forces it must have become clear that little could prevent Roman dominance of Italy.

<p><img src="English-Pyrrhus-route.png" title="fig:Route of Pyrrhus of Epirus" alt="Route of Pyrrhus of Epirus" width="305" />  By the end of the <a href="third_century_BC" title="wikilink">third century BC</a>, Rome had established itself as a major power on the <a href="Italia" title="wikilink">Italian peninsula</a>, but had not yet come into conflict with the dominant military powers in the <a href="Mediterranean_Basin" title="wikilink">Mediterranean</a> at the time: <a href="Carthage" class="uri" title="wikilink">Carthage</a> and the <a href="Ancient_Greece" title="wikilink">Greek kingdoms</a>. Rome had all but completely defeated the <a href="Samnites" class="uri" title="wikilink">Samnites</a>, mastered its fellow Latin towns, and greatly reduced <a href="Etruscan_civilization" title="wikilink">Etruscan</a> power in the region.

<p>The Roman army had not yet seen elephants in battle,<a href="#fn121" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref121"><sup>121</sup></a> and their inexperience turned the tide in Pyrrhus' favour at the <a href="Battle_of_Heraclea" title="wikilink">Battle of Heraclea</a> in 280 BC,<a href="#fn122" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref122"><sup>122</sup></a><a href="#fn123" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref123"><sup>123</sup></a><a href="#fn124" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref124"><sup>124</sup></a> and again at the <a href="Battle_of_Ausculum" title="wikilink">Battle of Ausculum</a> in 279 BC.<a href="#fn125" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref125"><sup>125</sup></a><a href="#fn126" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref126"><sup>126</sup></a><a href="#fn127" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref127"><sup>127</sup></a><a href="#fn128" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref128"><sup>128</sup></a>Despite these victories, Pyrrhus found his position in Italy untenable. Rome steadfastly refused to negotiate with Pyrrhus as long as his army remained in Italy. Furthermore, Rome entered into a treaty of support with <a href="Carthage" class="uri" title="wikilink">Carthage</a>, and Pyrrhus found that despite his expectations, none of the other <a href="Ancient_Italic_peoples" title="wikilink">Italic peoples</a> would defect to the Greek and Samnite cause<a href="#fn129" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref129"><sup>129</sup></a>. Facing unacceptably heavy losses with each encounter with the Roman army, and failing to find further allies in Italy, Pyrrhus withdrew from the peninsula and campaigned in <a href="Sicily" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sicily</a> against Carthage,<a href="#fn130" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref130"><sup>130</sup></a> abandoning his allies to deal with the Romans.<a href="#fn131" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref131"><sup>131</sup></a></p>
<p>When his Sicilian campaign was also ultimately a failure, and at the request of his Italian allies, Pyrrhus returned to Italy to face Rome once more. In 275 BC, Pyrrhus again met the Roman army at the <a href="Battle_of_Beneventum_(275_BC)" title="wikilink">Battle of Beneventum</a>.<a href="#fn132" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref132"><sup>132</sup></a> This time the Romans had devised methods to deal with the war elephants, including the use of javelins,<a href="#fn133" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref133"><sup>133</sup></a> fire<a href="#fn134" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref134"><sup>134</sup></a> and, one source claims, simply hitting the elephants heavily on the head.<a href="#fn135" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref135"><sup>135</sup></a> While Beneventum was indecisive,<a href="#fn136" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref136"><sup>136</sup></a> Pyrrhus realised that his army had been exhausted and reduced by years of foreign campaigns, and seeing little hope for further gains, he withdrew completely from Italy.</p>
<p>The conflicts with Pyrrhus would have a great effect on Rome, however. Rome had shown that it was capable of pitting its armies successfully against the dominant military powers of the Mediterranean, and further showed that the Greek kingdoms were incapable of defending their colonies in Italy and abroad. Rome quickly moved into southern Italia, subjugating and dividing Magna Grecia.<a href="#fn137" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref137"><sup>137</sup></a> Effectively dominating the Italian peninsula<a href="#fn138" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref138"><sup>138</sup></a>, and with a proven international military reputation,<a href="#fn139" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref139"><sup>139</sup></a> Rome now began to look outwards at expansion from the Italian mainland. Since the Alps formed a natural barrier to the north, and Rome was none to keen to meet the fierce Gauls in battle once more, the city's gaze turned to Sicily and the islands of the Mediterranean, a policy that would bring it into direct conflict with its former ally <a href="Carthage" class="uri" title="wikilink">Carthage</a>.<a href="#fn140" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref140"><sup>140</sup></a><a href="#fn141" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref141"><sup>141</sup></a></p>

<p><img src="Rome_carthage_218.jpg" title="fig:Theatre of Punic Wars" alt="Theatre of Punic Wars" width="305" />    Rome first began to make war outside the Italian peninsula in the <a href="Punic_wars" title="wikilink">Punic wars</a> against <a href="Carthage" class="uri" title="wikilink">Carthage</a>, a former <a href="Phoenician" class="uri" title="wikilink">Phoenician</a> colony<a href="#fn142" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref142"><sup>142</sup></a> on the north coast of Africa that had developed into a powerful state. These wars, starting in <a href="264_BC" title="wikilink">264 BC</a><a href="#fn143" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref143"><sup>143</sup></a> were probably the largest conflict of the ancient world<a href="#fn144" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref144"><sup>144</sup></a> and saw Rome become a Mediterranean power, with territory in <a href="Sicily" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sicily</a>, <a href="North_Africa" title="wikilink">North Africa</a>, <a href="Spain" class="uri" title="wikilink">Spain</a>, and, after the <a href="Macedonian_wars" title="wikilink">Macedonian wars</a>, <a href="Greece" class="uri" title="wikilink">Greece</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="First_Punic_War" title="wikilink">First Punic War</a> began in 264 BC when settlements on Sicily began to appeal to the two powers between which they lay - Rome and Carthage - in order to solve internal conflicts.<a href="#fn145" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref145"><sup>145</sup></a> The willingness of both Rome and Carthage to become embroiled on the soil of a third party may indicate a willingness to test each other's power without wishing to enter a full war of annihilation; certainly there was considerable disagreement within Rome about whether to prosecute the war at all.<a href="#fn146" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref146"><sup>146</sup></a> The war saw land battles in Sicily early on such as the <a href="Battle_of_Agrigentum" title="wikilink">Battle of Agrigentum</a> but the theatre shifted to naval battles around Sicily and Africa. For the Romans naval warfare was a relatively unexplored concept. Before the <a href="First_Punic_War" title="wikilink">First Punic War</a> in <a href="264_BC" title="wikilink">264 BC</a> there was no Roman navy to speak of as all previous Roman wars had been fought in <a href="Italy" class="uri" title="wikilink">Italy</a>. The new war in <a href="Sicily" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sicily</a> against <a href="Carthage" class="uri" title="wikilink">Carthage</a>, a great naval power<a href="#fn147" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref147"><sup>147</sup></a>, forced Rome to quickly build a fleet and train <a href="sailors" class="uri" title="wikilink">sailors</a>.<a href="#fn148" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref148"><sup>148</sup></a></p>
<p>Rome took to naval warfare <em>&quot;like a brick to water&quot;</em><a href="#fn149" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref149"><sup>149</sup></a> and the first few naval battles of the <a href="First_Punic_War" title="wikilink">First Punic War</a> such as the <a href="Battle_of_the_Lipari_Islands" title="wikilink">Battle of the Lipari Islands</a> were catastrophic disasters for <a href="Rome" class="uri" title="wikilink">Rome</a>, as might fairly be expected from a city that had no real prior experience of naval warfare. However, after training more sailors and inventing a grappling engine known as a <a href="Corvus" class="uri" title="wikilink">Corvus</a>,<a href="#fn150" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref150"><sup>150</sup></a> a Roman naval force under C. Duillius was able to roundly defeat a Carthaginian fleet at the <a href="Battle_of_Mylae" title="wikilink">Battle of Mylae</a>. In just 4 years, a state without any real naval experience had managed to better a major regional maritime power in battle. Further naval victories followed at the <a href="Battle_of_Tyndaris" title="wikilink">Battle of Tyndaris</a> and <a href="Battle_of_Cape_Ecnomus" title="wikilink">Battle of Cape Ecnomus</a>.<a href="#fn151" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref151"><sup>151</sup></a></p>
<p>After having won control of the seas, a Roman force landed on the African coast under <a href="Regulus" class="uri" title="wikilink">Regulus</a>, who was at first victorious, winning the <a href="Battle_of_Adys" title="wikilink">Battle of Adys</a><a href="#fn152" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref152"><sup>152</sup></a> and forcing Carthage to sue for peace.<a href="#fn153" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref153"><sup>153</sup></a> However the terms of peace that Rome proposed were so heavy that negotiations failed<a href="#fn154" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref154"><sup>154</sup></a> and, in response, the Carthaginians hired <a href="Xanthippus" class="uri" title="wikilink">Xanthippus</a>, a mercenary from the martial Greek city-state of Sparta, to reorganise and lead their army.<a href="#fn155" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref155"><sup>155</sup></a> Xanthippus managed to cut off the Roman army from its base by re-establishing Carthaginian naval supremacy, then defeated and captured Regulus<a href="#fn156" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref156"><sup>156</sup></a> at the <a href="Battle_of_Tunis" title="wikilink">Battle of Tunis</a>.<a href="#fn157" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref157"><sup>157</sup></a></p>
<p>Despite being defeated on African soil, with their new-found naval abilities, the Romans roundly beat the Carthaginians in naval battle again - largely through the tactical innovations of the Roman fleet<a href="#fn158" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref158"><sup>158</sup></a> - at the <a href="Battle_of_the_Aegates_Islands" title="wikilink">Battle of the Aegates Islands</a> and leaving Carthage without a fleet or sufficient coin to raise one.

From 206 BC onwards the only opposition to Roman control of the peninsula came from within the native <a href="Celt-Iberian" class="uri" title="wikilink">Celt-Iberian</a> tribes themselves, the disunity of which prevented security from Roman expansion.<a href="#fn190" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref190"><sup>190</sup></a></p>
<p>Following two small-scale rebellions in 197 BC,<a href="#fn191" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref191"><sup>191</sup></a> in 194 BC, war broke out in between the Romans and the <a href="Lusitani" class="uri" title="wikilink">Lusitani</a> people in the <a href="Lusitanian_War" title="wikilink">Lusitanian War</a>, in modern-day Portugal.

He is remembered as one of Rome's most formidable and successful enemies who engaged three of the most prominent generals of the late Roman Republic: <a href="Sulla" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sulla</a>, <a href="Lucullus" class="uri" title="wikilink">Lucullus</a>, and <a href="Pompey_the_Great" title="wikilink">Pompey the Great</a>. In a pattern familiar from the Punic Wars, the Romans came into conflict with him after the two states' spheres of influence began to overlap. Mithridates antagonised Rome by seeking to expand his kingdom,<a href="#fn277" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref277"><sup>277</sup></a> and Rome for her part seemed equally keen for war and the spoils and prestige that it might bring.<a href="#fn278" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref278"><sup>278</sup></a><a href="#fn279" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref279"><sup>279</sup></a> After conquering western <a href="Anatolia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Anatolia</a> (modern Turkey) in 88 BC, Roman sources state that Mithridates ordered the killing of the majority of the 80,000 Romans living there.<a href="#fn280" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref280"><sup>280</sup></a> The massacre may have been greatly exaggerated by the Romans but it was the official reason given for the commencement of hostilities in the <a href="First_Mithridatic_War" title="wikilink">First Mithridatic War</a>. The Roman general <a href="Lucius_Cornelius_Sulla" title="wikilink">Lucius Cornelius Sulla</a> forced Mithridates out of Greece proper after the <a href="Battle_of_Chaeronea_(86_BC)" title="wikilink">Battle of Chaeronea</a> and later <a href="Battle_of_Orchomenus" title="wikilink">Battle of Orchomenus</a> but then had to return to Italy to answer the internal threat posed by his rival Marius; consequently, Mithridates VI was defeated but not beaten. A peace was made between Rome and Pontus, but this proved only a temporary lull.</p>

<p>Gaul never regained its Celtic identity, never attempted another nationalist rebellion, and remained loyal to Rome until the fall of the Western Empire in 476. However, although Gaul itself was to thereafter remain loyal, cracks were appearing in the political unity of Rome's governing figures - partly over concerns over the loyalty of Caesar's Gallic troops to his person rather than the state<a href="#fn322" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref322"><sup>322</sup></a> - that were soon to dive Rome into a length series of civil wars.</p>

<p>By 59 BC an unofficial political alliance known as the <a href="First_Triumvirate" title="wikilink">First Triumvirate</a> was formed between <a href="Gaius_Julius_Caesar" title="wikilink">Gaius Julius Caesar</a>, <a href="Marcus_Licinius_Crassus" title="wikilink">Marcus Licinius Crassus</a>, and <a href="Gnaeus_Pompeius_Magnus" title="wikilink">Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus</a> to share power and influence.<a href="#fn323" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref323"><sup>323</sup></a> It was always an uncomfortable alliance given that Crassus and Pompey intensely disliked one another. In 53 BC, Crassus launched a Roman invasion of the Parthian Empire. After initial successes,<a href="#fn324" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref324"><sup>324</sup></a> he marched his army deep into the desert;<a href="#fn325" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref325"><sup>325</sup></a> but here his army was cut off deep in enemy territory, surrounded and slaughtered<a href="#fn326" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref326"><sup>326</sup></a> at the <a href="Battle_of_Carrhae" title="wikilink">Battle of Carrhae</a><a href="#fn327" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref327"><sup>327</sup></a><a href="#fn328" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref328"><sup>328</sup></a> in <em>&quot;the greatest Roman defeat since Hannibal&quot;</em><a href="#fn329" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref329"><sup>329</sup></a> in which Crassus himself perished.<a href="#fn330" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref330"><sup>330</sup></a> The death of Crassus removed some of the balance in the Triumvirate and, consequently, Caesar and Pompey began to move apart. While Caesar was fighting against Vercingetorix in Gaul, Pompey proceeded with a legislative agenda for Rome that revealed that he was at best ambivalent towards Caesar<a href="#fn331" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref331"><sup>331</sup></a> and perhaps now covertly allied with Caesar's political enemies. In 51 BC, some Roman senators demanded that Caesar would not be permitted to stand for Consul unless he turned over control of his armies to the state, and the same demands were made of Pompey by other factions.<a href="#fn332" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref332"><sup>332</sup></a><a href="#fn333" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref333"><sup>333</sup></a> Relinquishing his army would leave Caesar defenceless before his enemies. Caesar chose Civil War over laying down his command and facing trial.<a href="#fn334" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref334"><sup>334</sup></a> The triumvirate was shattered and conflict was inevitable.</p>
<p>Pompey initially assured Rome and the senate that he could defeat Caesar in battle should he march on Rome.<a href="#fn335" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref335"><sup>335</sup></a><a href="#fn336" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref336"><sup>336</sup></a> However, by the spring of 49 BC, when Caesar crossed the Rubicon river with his invading forces and swept down the Italian peninsula towards Rome, Pompey ordered the abandonment of Rome.<a href="#fn337" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref337"><sup>337</sup></a><a href="#fn338" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref338"><sup>338</sup></a> Caesar's army was still under-strength, with certain units remaining in Gaul,<a href="#fn339" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref339"><sup>339</sup></a> but on the other hand Pompey himself only had a small force at his command, and that with uncertain loyalty having served under Caesar.<a href="#fn340" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref340"><sup>340</sup></a> Tom Holland attributes Pompey's willingness to abandon Rome to waves of panicking refugees stirring ancestral fears of invasions from the north.<a href="#fn341" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref341"><sup>341</sup></a> Pompey's forces retreated south towards Brundisium,<a href="#fn342" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref342"><sup>342</sup></a> and then fled to Greece.<a href="#fn343" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref343"><sup>343</sup></a><a href="#fn344" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref344"><sup>344</sup></a> Caesar first directed his attention to the Pompeian stronghold of Spain<a href="#fn345" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref345"><sup>345</sup></a> but following campaigning by Caesar in the <a href="Siege_of_Massilia" title="wikilink">Siege of Massilia</a> and <a href="Battle_of_Ilerda" title="wikilink">Battle of Ilerda</a> decided to tackle Pompey himself in Greece.<a href="#fn346" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref346"><sup>346</sup></a><a href="#fn347" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref347"><sup>347</sup></a> Pompey initially defeated Caesar at the <a href="Battle_of_Dyrrhachium_(48_BC)" title="wikilink">Battle of Dyrrachium</a> in 48 BC<a href="#fn348" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref348"><sup>348</sup></a> but failing to follow up on the victory, Pompey was decisively defeated in the <a href="Battle_of_Pharsalus" title="wikilink">Battle of Pharsalus</a> in 48 BC<a href="#fn349" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref349"><sup>349</sup></a><a href="#fn350" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref350"><sup>350</sup></a> despite outnumbering Caesar's forces two to one.<a href="#fn351" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref351"><sup>351</sup></a> Pompey fled again, this time to Egypt, where he was murdered<a href="#fn352" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref352"><sup>352</sup></a><a href="#fn353" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref353"><sup>353</sup></a> in an attempt to ingratiate the country with Caesar and avoid a war with Rome.<a href="#fn354" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref354"><sup>354</sup></a><a href="#fn355" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref355"><sup>355</sup></a></p>
<p>Pompey's death did not see the end of the civil wars since initially Caesar's enemies were manifold and Pompey's supporters continued to fight on after his death. In 46 BC Caesar lost perhaps as much as a third of his army when his former commander <a href="Titus_Labienus" title="wikilink">Titus Labienus</a>, who had defected to the Pompeians several years earlier, defeated him at the <a href="Battle_of_Ruspina" title="wikilink">Battle of Ruspina</a>. However, after this low point Caesar came back to defeat the Pompeian army of <a href="Metellus_Scipio" title="wikilink">Metellus Scipio</a> in the <a href="Battle_of_Thapsus" title="wikilink">Battle of Thapsus</a>, after which the Pompeians retreated yet again to Spain. Caesar defeated the combined forces of Titus Labienus and Gnaeus Pompey the Younger at the <a href="Battle_of_Munda" title="wikilink">Battle of Munda</a> in Spain. Labienus was killed in the battle and the Younger Pompey captured and executed.</p>

<p>Despite his military success, or probably because of it, fear spread of Caesar, now the primary figure of the Roman state, becoming an autocratic ruler and ending the Roman Republic. This fear drove a group of senators naming themselves <a href="Brutus" title="wikilink">The Liberators</a> to assassinate him in 44 BC.<a href="#fn357" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref357"><sup>357</sup></a> Further civil war followed between those loyal to Caesar and those who supported the actions of the Liberators. Caesar's supporter Mark Anthony declaimed Caesar's assassins and war broke out between the two factions. Antony was denounced as a public enemy, and Octavian was entrusted with the command of the war against him. In the <a href="Battle_of_Forum_Gallorum" title="wikilink">Battle of Forum Gallorum</a> Antony, besieging Caesar's assassin Decimus Brutus in <a href="Mutina" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mutina</a>, defeated the forces of the consul Pansa, who was killed, but Antony was then immediately defeated by the army of the other consul, Hirtius. At the <a href="Battle_of_Mutina" title="wikilink">Battle of Mutina</a> Antony was again defeated in battle by Hirtius, who was killed. Although Antony failed to capture Mutina, Decimus Brutus was murdered shortly thereafter.</p>
<p>Octavian betrayed his party, and came to terms with Caesarians Antony and Lepidus and on <a href="26_November" title="wikilink">26 November</a> 43 BC the <a href="Second_Triumvirate" title="wikilink">Second Triumvirate</a> was formed,<a href="#fn358" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref358"><sup>358</sup></a> this time in an official capacity.<a href="#fn359" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref359"><sup>359</sup></a> In 42 BC <a href="Triumvir" title="wikilink">Triumvirs</a> <a href="Marc_Antony" title="wikilink">Marc Antony</a> and <a href="Augustus" title="wikilink">Octavian</a> fought the indecisive <a href="Battle_of_Philippi" title="wikilink">Battle of Philippi</a> with Caesar's assassins <a href="Marcus_Brutus" title="wikilink">Marcus Brutus</a> and <a href="Gaius_Cassius_Longinus" title="wikilink">Cassius</a>. Although Brutus defeated Octavian, Antony defeated Cassius, who committed suicide. Brutus also committed suicide shortly afterwards.</p>
<p>However, civil war flared again when the Second Triumvirate of Octavian, Lepidus and <a href="Mark_Anthony" title="wikilink">Mark Anthony</a> failed just as the first had almost as soon as its opponents had been removed. The ambitious Octavian built a power base and then launched a campaign against Mark Anthony.<a href="#fn360" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref360"><sup>360</sup></a> Together with Lucius Antonius, Mark Antony's brother, <a href="Fulvia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Fulvia</a> raised an army in Italy to fight for Antony's rights against Octavian but she was defeated by Octavian at the <a href="Battle_of_Perugia" title="wikilink">Battle of Perugia</a>. Her death led to partial reconciliation between Octavian and Anthony who went on to crush the army of <a href="Sextus_Pompeius" title="wikilink">Sextus Pompeius</a>, the last focus of opposition to the second triumvirate, in the naval <a href="Battle_of_Naulochus" title="wikilink">Battle of Naulochus</a>.</p>
<p>As before, once opposition to the triumvirate was crushed, it started to tear at itself. The triumvirate expired on the last day of 33 BC and was not renewed in law and in 31 BC, war began again. At the <a href="Battle_of_Actium" title="wikilink">Battle of Actium</a>,<a href="#fn361" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref361"><sup>361</sup></a> <a href="Augustus" title="wikilink">Octavian</a> decisively defeated Antony and <a href="Cleopatra_VII_of_Egypt" title="wikilink">Cleopatra</a> in a naval battle near Greece, using fire to destroy the enemy fleet.<a href="#fn362" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref362"><sup>362</sup></a></p>
<p>Octavian went on to become Emperor under the name Augustus<a href="#fn363" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref363"><sup>363</sup></a> and, in the absence of political assassins or usurpers, was able to greatly expand the borders of the Empire.</p>

Vespasian led his forces in a methodical clearance of the areas in revolt. By the year 68, Jewish resistance in the North had been crushed.

<h3 id="struggle-with-parthia-161-217">Struggle with Parthia (161-217)</h3>

<p>By the second century AD the territories of Persia were controlled by the Arascid dynasty and known as the Parthian Empire. Due in large part to their employment of powerful heavy cavalry and mobile horse-archers, Parthia was the most formidable enemy of the Roman Empire in the east. As early as 53 BC, the Roman general Crassus had invaded Parthia, but was defeated at the Battle of Carrhae. In the years following the Battle of Carrhae the Romans were divided in civil war and hence unable to campaign against Parthia. Trajan also campaigned against the Parthians and briefly captured their capital, putting a puppet ruler on the throne, but rebellions with the province and the Jewish revolts in Judea made it difficult to maintain the captured province and the territories were abandoned.</p>
<p>A revitalised Parthian Empire renewed its assault in 161, defeating two Roman armies and invading Armenia and Syria. Emperor <a href="Lucius_Verus" title="wikilink">Lucius Verus</a> and general <a href="Gaius_Avidius_Cassius" title="wikilink">Gaius Avidius Cassius</a> were sent in 162 to counter the resurgent Parthia. In this war, the Parthian city of Seleucia on the Tigris was destroyed and the palace at the capital Ctesiphon was burned to the ground by <a href="Avidius_Cassius" title="wikilink">Avidius Cassius</a> in 164. The Parthians made peace but were forced to cede western Mesopotamia to the Romans.<a href="#fn445" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref445"><sup>445</sup></a></p>
<p>In 197, Emperor <a href="Septimius_Severus" title="wikilink">Septimius Severus</a> waged a brief and successful war against the Parthian Empire in retaliation for the support given to rival for the imperial throne <a href="Pescennius_Niger" title="wikilink">Pescennius Niger</a>. The Parthian capital Ctesiphon was sacked by the Roman army, and the northern half of Mesopotamia was restored to Rome.</p>
<p>Emperor <a href="Caracalla" class="uri" title="wikilink">Caracalla</a>, the son of Severus, marched on Parthia in 217 from Edessa to begin a war against them, but he was assassinated while on the march.<a href="#fn446" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref446"><sup>446</sup></a> In 224, the Parthian Empire was crushed not by the Romans but by the rebellious Persian vassal king Ardashir, who revolted, leading to the establishment of <a href="Sassanid_Empire" title="wikilink">Sassanid Empire</a> of Persia, which replaced Parthia as Rome's major rival in the East.</p>
<p>Throughout the Parthian wars, tribal groups along the Rhine and Danube took advantage of Rome's preoccupation with the eastern frontier (and the plague that the Romans suffered from after bringing it back form the east) and launched a series of raids and incursions into Rome's territories, including the <a href="Marcomannic_Wars" title="wikilink">Marcomannic Wars</a>.</p>

Although the exact historicity is unclear, since the Romans often assigned one name to several distinct tribal groups, or conversely applied several names to a single group at different times, some mix of Germanic peoples, Celts, and tribes of mixed Celto-Germanic ethnicity were settled in the lands of Germania from the first century onwards.

The so-called <a href="Crisis_of_the_Third_Century" title="wikilink">Crisis of the Third Century</a> describes the turmoil of murder, usurpation and in-fighting that is traditionally seen as developing with the murder of the Emperor <a href="Alexander_Severus" title="wikilink">Alexander Severus</a> in <a href="235" class="uri" title="wikilink">235</a>.<a href="#fn477" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref477"><sup>477</sup></a> However, <a href="Cassius_Dio" title="wikilink">Cassius Dio</a> marks the wider imperial decline as beginning in 180 AD with ascension of <a href="Commodus" class="uri" title="wikilink">Commodus</a> to the throne,<a href="#fn478" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref478"><sup>478</sup></a> a judgement with which <a href="Edward_Gibbon" title="wikilink">Gibbon</a> concurred,<a href="#fn479" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref479"><sup>479</sup></a> and <a href="Philip_Matyszak" title="wikilink">Matyszak</a> states that <em>&quot;the rot... had become established long before&quot;</em> even that.<a href="#fn480" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref480"><sup>480</sup></a></p>
<p>Though the crisis of the third century was not the absolute beginning of Rome's decline, nevertheless it did mark a severe strain on the empire as Romans waged war on one another as they had not done since the final days of the Republic. Within the space of a single century, twenty-seven military officers claimed themselves emperors and reigned over parts of the empire for months or days, all but two meeting with a violent end.<a href="#fn481" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref481"><sup>481</sup></a><a href="#fn482" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref482"><sup>482</sup></a> The time was characterised by a Roman army that was as likely to be attacking itself as an outside invader, reaching a low point around 258 AD.<a href="#fn483" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref483"><sup>483</sup></a> Ironically, while it was these usurpations that led to the break up of the Empire during the crisis, it was the strength of several frontier generals that helped reunify the empire through force of arms.</p>
<p>The situation was complex, often with 3 or more usurpers in existence at once. <a href="Septimius_Severus" title="wikilink">Septimius Severus</a> and <a href="Pescennius_Niger" title="wikilink">Pescennius Niger</a>, both rebel generals promoted as emperors by the troops they commanded, clashed for the first time in 193 AD at the <a href="Battle_of_Cyzicus_(193)" title="wikilink">Battle of Cyzicus</a>, in which Niger was defeated. However, it took two further defeats at the <a href="Battle_of_Nicaea" title="wikilink">Battle of Nicaea</a> later that year and the <a href="Battle_of_Issus_(194)" title="wikilink">Battle of Issus</a> the following year, for Niger to be definitively defeated. Almost as soon as Niger's hopes of the imperial crown had been laid to rest, Severus was forced to deal with another rival for the throne in the person of <a href="Clodius_Albinus" title="wikilink">Clodius Albinus</a>, who had originally been allied to Severus. Albinus was proclaimed emperor by his troops in Britain and, crossing over to Gaul, defeated Severus' general <a href="Virius_Lupus" title="wikilink">Virius Lupus</a> in battle, before being in turn defeated and killed himself in the <a href="Battle_of_Lugdunum" title="wikilink">Battle of Lugdunum</a> by Severus himself.</p>
<p>After this turmoil, Severus faced no more internal threats for the rest of his reign,<a href="#fn484" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref484"><sup>484</sup></a> and the reign of his successor <a href="Caracalla" class="uri" title="wikilink">Caracalla</a> passed uninterrupted for a while until he was murdered by <a href="Macrinus" class="uri" title="wikilink">Macrinus</a>,<a href="#fn485" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref485"><sup>485</sup></a> who proclaimed himsef emperor in his place. Despite Macrinus having his position ratified by the Roman senate, the troops of <a href="Elagabalus" title="wikilink">Varius Avitus</a> declared him to be emperor instead, and the two met in battle at the <a href="Battle_of_Antioch_(218)" title="wikilink">Battle of Antioch</a> in 218 AD, in which Macrinus was defeated.<a href="#fn486" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref486"><sup>486</sup></a> However, Avitus himself - taking the imperial name Elagabalus - was murdered shortly afterwards<a href="#fn487" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref487"><sup>487</sup></a> and <a href="Alexander_Severus" title="wikilink">Alexander Severus</a> was proclaimed emperor by both the Praetorian Guard and the senate who, after a short reign, was murdered in turn.<a href="#fn488" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref488"><sup>488</sup></a> His murderers were working on behalf of the army who were unhappy with their lot under his rule and who raised in his place <a href="Maximinus_Thrax" title="wikilink">Maximinus Thrax</a>. However, just as he had been raised by the army, Maximinus was also brought down by them and despite winning the <a href="Battle_of_Carthage_(238)" title="wikilink">Battle of Carthage</a> against the senate's newly-proclaimed <a href="Gordian_II" title="wikilink">Gordian II</a>, he was murdered<a href="#fn489" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref489"><sup>489</sup></a> when it appeared to his forces as though he would not be able to best the next senatorial candidate for the throne, Gordian <a href="III" class="uri" title="wikilink">III</a>.</p>
<p>Gordian III's fate is not certain, although he may have been murdered by his own successor, <a href="Philip_the_Arab" title="wikilink">Philip the Arab</a>, who ruled for only a few years before the army again raised a general to proclaimed emperor, this time <a href="Decius" class="uri" title="wikilink">Decius</a>, who defeated Philip in the <a href="Battle_of_Verona" title="wikilink">Battle of Verona</a> to seize the throne.<a href="#fn490" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref490"><sup>490</sup></a> Several succeeding generals avoided battling usurpers for the throne chiefly by virtue of being murdered by their own troops before battle could commence, which at least relieved the empire momentarily of manpower losses to internal strife. The lone exception to this rule was <a href="Gallienus" class="uri" title="wikilink">Gallienus</a>, emperor from 260 AD to 268 AD, who saw off a <a href="Gallienus_usurpers" title="wikilink">remarkable array of usurpers</a>, most of whom he defeated in pitched battle. The army was therefore mostly spared further infighting until around 273 AD, when Aurelian defeated the Gallic usurper <a href="Tetricus_I" title="wikilink">Tetricus</a> in the <a href="Battle_of_Chalons_(273)" title="wikilink">Battle of Chalons</a>. The next decade saw a barely credible number of usurpers, sometimes 3 at the same time, all vying for the imperial throne. Most of the battles are not recorded, primarily due to the turmoil of the time, until <a href="Diocletian" class="uri" title="wikilink">Diocletian</a>, a usurper himself, defeated <a href="Carinus" class="uri" title="wikilink">Carinus</a> at the <a href="Battle_of_the_Margus" title="wikilink">Battle of the Margus</a> to become emperor.</p>
<p>Some small measure of stability again returned at this point, with the empire split into a Tetrarchy of two greater and two lesses emperors, a system that staved off civil wars for a short time until 312 AD. In that year, relations between the tetrarchy collapsed for good and <a href="Constantine_I" title="wikilink">Constantine I</a>, <a href="Licinius" class="uri" title="wikilink">Licinius</a>, <a href="Maxentius" class="uri" title="wikilink">Maxentius</a> and <a href="Maximinus" class="uri" title="wikilink">Maximinus</a> jostled for control of the empire. In the <a href="Battle_of_Turin_(312)" title="wikilink">Battle of Turin</a> Constantine defeated Maxentius, and in the <a href="Battle_of_Tzirallum" title="wikilink">Battle of Tzirallum</a> <a href="Licinius" class="uri" title="wikilink">Licinius</a> defeated <a href="Maximinus" class="uri" title="wikilink">Maximinus</a>. From 314 AD onwards, Constantine defeated Licinius in the <a href="Battle_of_Cibalae" title="wikilink">Battle of Cibalae</a>, then the <a href="Battle_of_Mardia" title="wikilink">Battle of Mardia</a>, and then again at the <a href="Battle_of_Adrianople_(324)" title="wikilink">Battle of Adrianople</a>, the <a href="Battle_of_the_Hellespont" title="wikilink">Battle of the Hellespont</a> and the <a href="Battle_of_Chrysopolis" title="wikilink">Battle of Chrysopolis</a>.</p>
<p>Constantine then turne to Maxentius, beating him in the <a href="Battle_of_Verona_(312)" title="wikilink">Battle of Verona</a> and the <a href="Battle_of_Milvian_Bridge" title="wikilink">Battle of Milvian Bridge</a> in the same year. Constantine's son <a href="Constantius_II" title="wikilink">Constantius II</a> inherited his father's rule and later defeated the usurper <a href="Magnentius" class="uri" title="wikilink">Magnentius</a> in first the <a href="Battle_of_Mursa_Major" title="wikilink">Battle of Mursa Major</a> and then the <a href="Battle_of_Mons_Seleucus" title="wikilink">Battle of Mons Seleucus</a>.</p>
<p>Successive emperors <a href="Valens" class="uri" title="wikilink">Valens</a> and <a href="Theodosius_I" title="wikilink">Theodosius I</a> also defeated usurpers in, repsectively, the <a href="Battle_of_Thyatira" title="wikilink">Battle of Thyatira</a>, and the battles of <a href="Battle_of_the_Save" title="wikilink">the Save</a> and <a href="Battle_of_the_Frigidus" title="wikilink">the Frigidus</a>.</p>

<p>Certainly, the Sassanids had not been cowed by the previous battles with Rome and in 253 the Sassanids under <a href="Shapur_I" title="wikilink">Shapur I</a> penetrated deeply into Roman territory several times, defeating a Roman force at the <a href="Battle_of_Barbalissos" title="wikilink">Battle of Barbalissos</a><a href="#fn500" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref500"><sup>500</sup></a> and conquering and plundering <a href="Antiochia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Antiochia</a> in 252 following the <a href="Siege_of_Antiochia" title="wikilink">Siege of Antiochia</a>.<a href="#fn501" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref501"><sup>501</sup></a><a href="#fn502" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref502"><sup>502</sup></a> The Romans recovered Antioch by 253 AD,<a href="#fn503" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref503"><sup>503</sup></a> and Emperor Valerian gathered an army and marched eastward to the Sassanid borders.

The historicity and exact dates are uncertain, and some historians deny that the Empire fell at all at this point. They are able to hold this position since the decline of the Empire had been a long and gradual process rather than a single event.</p>
<p>The Empire became gradually less Romanised and increasingly Germanic in nature: although the Empire buckled under Visigoth assault, the overthrow of the last Emperor <a href="Romulus_Augustus" title="wikilink">Romulus Augustus</a> was carried out by federated Germanic troops from within the Roman army rather than by foreign troops. In this sense had Odoacer not renounced the title of Emperor and named himself &quot;King of Italy&quot; instead, the Empire might have continued in name. Its identity, however, was no longer Roman - it was increasingly populated and governed by Germanic peoples long before 476. The Roman people were by the fifth century &quot;<em>bereft of their military ethos</em>&quot;<a href="#fn513" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref513"><sup>513</sup></a> and the Roman army itself a mere supplement to federated troops of Goths, Huns, Franks and others fighting on their behalf.</p>
<p>Rome's last gasp began when the Visigoths poured across the Danube once more in around 398 AD.<a href="#fn514" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref514"><sup>514</sup></a> Led by <a href="Alaric_I" title="wikilink">Alaric I</a>,<a href="#fn515" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref515"><sup>515</sup></a> they attempted to seize Constantinople,<a href="#fn516" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref516"><sup>516</sup></a> but were rebuffed and instead plundered much of Thrace in northern Greece.<a href="#fn517" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref517"><sup>517</sup></a><a href="#fn518" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref518"><sup>518</sup></a>In 402 AD they besieged Mediolanum, the capital of Roman Emperor <a href="Honorius" class="uri" title="wikilink">Honorius</a>, defended by Roman Gothic troops. The arrival of the Roman <a href="Stilicho" class="uri" title="wikilink">Stilicho</a> and his army forced Alaric to relieve the siege and move towards Hasta (modern Asti) in western Italy, where Stilicho attacked it at the <a href="Battle_of_Pollentia" title="wikilink">Battle of Pollentia</a>,<a href="#fn519" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref519"><sup>519</sup></a><a href="#fn520" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref520"><sup>520</sup></a> capturing Alaric's camp. Stilicho offered to return the prisoners in exchange for the Visigoths returning to Illyricum but upon arriving at Verona, Alaric halted his retreat. Stilicho again attacked at the <a href="Battle_of_Verona" title="wikilink">Battle of Verona</a><a href="#fn521" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref521"><sup>521</sup></a> and again defeated Alaric,<a href="#fn522" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref522"><sup>522</sup></a> forcing him to withdraw from Italy.</p>
<p>In 405 AD, the Ostrogoths invaded Italy itself, but were defeated. However, in 406 AD an unprecendented number of tribes took advantage of the freezing of the Rhine to cross <em>en masse</em>: Vandals, Suevi, Alans and Burgundians swept across the river and met little resistance in the <a href="Sack_of_Moguntiacum" title="wikilink">Sack of Moguntiacum</a> and the <a href="Sack_of_Treviri" title="wikilink">Sack of Treviri</a>,<a href="#fn523" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref523"><sup>523</sup></a> completely over-running Gaul. Despite this grave danger, or perhaps because of it, the Roman army continued to be wracked by usurpation, in one of which Stilicho, Rome's foremost defender of the period, was put to death.<a href="#fn524" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref524"><sup>524</sup></a></p>
<p>It is in this climate that, despite his earlier setback, Alaric returned again in 410 and managed to <a href="Sack_of_Rome_(410)" title="wikilink">sack Rome</a>.<a href="#fn525" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref525"><sup>525</sup></a><a href="#fn526" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref526"><sup>526</sup></a><a href="#fn527" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref527"><sup>527</sup></a> The Roman capital had already been moved to the Italian city of Ravenna,<a href="#fn528" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref528"><sup>528</sup></a> but some historians view 410 as an alternative date for the true fall of the Roman Empire.<a href="#fn529" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref529"><sup>529</sup></a> Without possession of Rome or many of its former provinces, and increasingly Germanic in nature, the Roman Empire after 410 had little in common with the earlier Empire.

<p>The remainder of Rome's territory, if not its nature, was defended for several decades following 410 largely by <a href="Flavius_A&lt;U+00EB&gt;tius" title="wikilink">Flavius A&lt;U+00EB&gt;tius</a>, who managed to play off each of Rome's barbarian invaders against one another: in 436 he led a Hunnic army against the Visigoths at the <a href="Battle_of_Arles" title="wikilink">Battle of Arles</a>, and again in 436 at the <a href="Battle_of_Narbonne_(436)" title="wikilink">Battle of Narbonne</a>, and then in 451 led a combined army including his former enemy the Visigoths against the Huns at the <a href="Battle_of_the_Catalunian_Plains" title="wikilink">Battle of the Catalunian Plains</a>,<a href="#fn536" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref536"><sup>536</sup></a><a href="#fn537" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref537"><sup>537</sup></a><a href="#fn538" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref538"><sup>538</sup></a> beating them so soundly that although they later sacked <a href="Concordia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Concordia</a>, <a href="Altinum" class="uri" title="wikilink">Altinum</a>, <a href="Mediolanum" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mediolanum</a><a href="#fn539" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref539"><sup>539</sup></a> and <a href="Ticinum" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ticinum</a><a href="#fn540" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref540"><sup>540</sup></a> and <a href="Patavium" class="uri" title="wikilink">Patavium</a>, they never again directly threatened Rome.

<p>Carthage, the second largest city in the empire, was lost along with much of North Africa in 439 AD to the Vandals,<a href="#fn542" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref542"><sup>542</sup></a><a href="#fn543" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref543"><sup>543</sup></a> and the fate of Rome seemed sealed.

Odoacer happened to hold the part of the Empire around Italy and Rome but other parts of the Empire were ruled by Visigoths, Ostrogoths, Franks, Alans and others.

The <a href="Byzantine_Empire" title="wikilink">Byzantine Empire</a> and the Goths continued to fight over Rome and the surrounding area for many years, though by this point Rome's importance was negligible. Following years of grinding war the city was by 540 AD near-abandoned and desolate with much of its environment turned into an unhealthy marsh, an inglorious end for a city that once ruled much of the known world.</p>
<p>At this point, Roman military history becomes <a href="Byzantine_military" title="wikilink">Byzantine military history</a>.</p>
<h2 id="assessment">Assessment</h2>
<p>There can be few militaries, either ancient or modern, who have campaigned so widely and over such a long period as the Roman military. Despite Napoleon's famous assertion that <em>&quot;The Gauls were not conquered by the Roman [army], but by Caesar&quot;</em>,<a href="#fn547" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref547"><sup>547</sup></a> the fact remains that Romans were willing to absorb horrific losses of life in the pursuit of their campaigns.<a href="#fn548" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref548"><sup>548</sup></a> Although Roman generals often shared in the fate of their soldiers, it was by the millions of soldiers of the Roman military that the greatest sacrifice was borne, and for much of Rome's history, its soldiers fought loyally and selflessly for the state and their homes.</p>
<p>However, in the later Empire soldiers followed commanders for little more than the promise of gold,<a href="#fn549" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref549"><sup>549</sup></a> and although the threat to Rome from external enemies was great, it should have been able to withstand it had the soldiers of the late Empire not been campaigning almost as often against one another, and its generals plotting on usurping the throne rather than supporting it.<a href="#fn550" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref550"><sup>550</sup></a></p>
<p>Although the traditional view has been that the Roman expansion was a noble enterprise that was justified in that it <em>&quot;carried the torch of civilization into the barbarian darkness&quot;</em>,<a href="#fn551" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref551"><sup>551</sup></a> an alternative view has emerged recently that the flourishing of Rome that followed its military expansion occurred only at the expense of extinguishing other nascent, vibrant cultures, such as the <a href="Celts" class="uri" title="wikilink">Celts</a> and <a href="Dacians" class="uri" title="wikilink">Dacians</a>.<a href="#fn552" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref552"><sup>552</sup></a> Perhaps the very fact that so much of the heritage, laws, institutions and concepts of western life are influenced by a Rome from which we have inherited so much<a href="#fn553" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref553"><sup>553</sup></a><a href="#fn554" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref554"><sup>554</sup></a><a href="#fn555" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref555"><sup>555</sup></a> breeds the concept that Rome was the only culture with much to offer - that nothing much was lost in those cultures that the Roman military extinguished - and hides the fact that much of Europe developed from a flat Roman monoculture. It is not possible to know whether the cultures the Roman military so successfully bested would have brought the descendants of their regions tyranny, poverty and shame or glory, wealth and enlightenment. All that is certain is that those cultures <em>were</em> bested by Rome.</p>
