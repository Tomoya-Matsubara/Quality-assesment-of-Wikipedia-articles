<p>Coogan said he &quot;liked to keep himself private&quot;, adding; &quot;I have never wanted to be famous, as such &lt;U+2013&gt; fame is a by-product&quot;.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> He has been a popular target of the <a href="British_tabloid" title="wikilink">British tabloid</a> <a href="News_media" title="wikilink">press</a> since 1996, who he stated have subjected him to <a href="entrapment" class="uri" title="wikilink">entrapment</a> and <a href="blackmail" class="uri" title="wikilink">blackmail</a>, printed obvious <a href="lie" title="wikilink">falsehoods</a> about him,<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> also targeting his family and friends in attempts to extract stories from them.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a></p>
<p>Coogan in some cases gave a strong denial to allegations, but in others did not contest them because he wanted to shield vulnerable friends from adverse publicity.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> The tabloids also published intrusive information about his relationships and the schooling of his child. Coogan has also been critical of the <a href="broadsheet" class="uri" title="wikilink">broadsheet</a> press, saying they have colluded with the tabloids in the interests of selling newspapers. In 2005 he said &quot;<em>The Guardian</em> tends to have its cake and eat it. It waits for the tabloids to dish the dirt and then it talks about the tabloids dishing the dirt while enjoying it themselves.&quot;<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> However, Coogan later gave credit to the same newspaper for its investigation of the phone hacking scandal.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> Coogan said that because of the persistent intrusion into his private life, the press had effectively made him &quot;immune&quot; to further attack, as his &quot;closet is empty of skeletons&quot;.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="phone-hacking">Phone hacking</h3>

<p>Coogan became a prominent figure in the News International phone hacking scandal as one of the celebrities who took action against the British tabloids in light of these events. He was made aware by his <a href="Telecommunications_service_provider" title="wikilink">phone service provider</a> of &quot;possible anomalies&quot; on his phone in 2005 and 2006.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> In 2010, Coogan's legal firm obtained a partially <a href="Sanitization_(classified_information)" title="wikilink">redacted</a> version of <a href="Glenn_Mulcaire" title="wikilink">Glenn Mulcaire's</a> <a href="phone_hacking" title="wikilink">hacking</a> notebook by a <a href="court_order" title="wikilink">court order</a> which showed Coogan had been targeted and his personal information was in the possession of Mulcaire.</p>
<p>Mulcaire was forced by the <a href="High_Court_of_Justice" title="wikilink">High Court of Justice</a> to disclose to Coogan's legal team who amongst the staff at the <em><a href="News_of_the_World" title="wikilink">News of the World</a></em> ordered him to hack phones. This information was obtained by Coogan's lawyers on 26 August 2011.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> Interviewed on <em><a href="Newsnight" class="uri" title="wikilink">Newsnight</a></em> on 8 July 2011, Coogan said he was &quot;delighted&quot; by the closure of the News of the World and said it was a &quot;fantastic day for journalism&quot;. He said the idea of press freedom was used by the tabloids as a &quot;smokescreen for selling papers with tittle-tattle&quot; and said the argument against press regulation was &quot;<a href="moral_bankruptcy" title="wikilink">morally bankrupt</a>&quot;<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a></p>
<p>Coogan provided an 8-page witness statement to the <a href="Leveson_Inquiry" title="wikilink">Leveson Inquiry</a> and appeared at the inquiry on 22 November 2011 to discuss the evidence.<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> He said he was there reluctantly representing a lot of celebrities who felt they could not speak out for fear of reprisals from the tabloid press.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a></p>
