<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<h3 id="early-years">Early years</h3>
<p>Baseball has been popular in Kinston since the late nineteenth century, and it fielded many excellent amateur clubs. Despite this, the small city was unable to sustain a viable professional team until the mid-1920s.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> Earlier attempts included an aborted campaign in the <a href="Minor_league_baseball#Defunct_levels" title="wikilink">Class D</a> <a href="Eastern_Carolina_League" title="wikilink">Eastern Carolina League</a> in <a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> and an &quot;<a href="Independent_league_baseball" title="wikilink">outlaw league</a>&quot; team in  and . The latter was notable for being managed by former major league pitcher <a href="George_Suggs" title="wikilink">George Suggs</a> and <a href="College_Football_Hall_of_Fame" title="wikilink">College Football Hall of Fame</a> member <a href="Ira_Rodgers" title="wikilink">Ira Rodgers</a>.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> Due to the efforts of the city's business leaders, former local amateur star Elisha Lewis, and George Suggs, the town secured a team in the <a href="Virginia_League" title="wikilink">Virginia League</a> for the  season.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p><img src="Westend1.jpg" title="fig:West End Park tickets: 1929." alt="West End Park tickets: 1929." width="150" />This <a href="Minor_league_baseball#Defunct_levels" title="wikilink">Class B</a> team played in a newly renovated stadium designed by Suggs known as <a href="West_End_Park" title="wikilink">West End Park</a>.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> Named the &quot;Eagles&quot;,<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> the squad had very little success against the rest of the league. Despite their lack of wins, the team was successful enough at the gate that they proved the town was capable of sustaining a professional team. Kinston stayed three years in the Virginia League and then moved on to a newly reformed Eastern Carolina League. This later affiliation would collapse along with the stock market in .<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> Among the members of these 1920's Eagles teams was a young catcher named <a href="Rick_Ferrell" title="wikilink">Rick Ferrell</a> who would have a long playing career and even longer front office career in the major leagues. In , he became the only former Kinston player inducted into the <a href="National_Baseball_Hall_of_Fame_and_Museum" title="wikilink">Baseball Hall of Fame</a>.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> Another player, <a href="Frank_A._Armstrong" title="wikilink">Frank Armstrong</a>, eventually decided that baseball was not for him. He gave up baseball for a career in the armed services and became one of the most decorated generals in the history of the <a href="United_States_Air_Force" title="wikilink">Air Force</a>.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="coastal-plain-league">Coastal Plain League</h3>
<p>Kinston was without a team for the first few years of the <a href="Great_Depression" title="wikilink">Depression</a>, but by , the city found its way into the semi-professional <a href="Coastal_Plain_League_(semi_pro)" title="wikilink">Coastal Plain League</a>. In , this loop became <a href="Coastal_Plain_League_(Class_D)" title="wikilink">fully professional</a> and was classified as a <a href="Minor_league_baseball#Defunct_levels" title="wikilink">Class D</a> league by the <a href="National_Association" title="wikilink">National Association</a>.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> The city would stay in this league every season until it was finally disbanded following the  campaign. It was as a member of this affiliation that Kinston saw many playoff appearances and two league championships ( and ). Among the superior talent that entertained the fans of Kinston was a young player named <a href="Charlie_Keller" title="wikilink">Charlie &quot;King Kong&quot; Keller</a> who remains within the top forty major league players of all-time in terms of <a href="on_base_percentage" title="wikilink">on base percentage</a> (.410).<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a><a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="carolina-league">Carolina League</h3>
<p><img src="Carl_Long.jpg" title="fig:Carl Long - 2006" alt="Carl Long - 2006" width="90" />For three years following the dissolution of the Coastal Plain League, Kinston found itself without a team until the owner of the <a href="Burlington_Bees" title="wikilink">Burlington Bees</a> of the <a href="Carolina_League" title="wikilink">Carolina League</a> moved his team to Kinston for the  season. At the time, the Carolina League was a <a href="Minor_league_baseball#Defunct_levels" title="wikilink">Class B</a> loop with teams located in <a href="Virginia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Virginia</a> and <a href="North_Carolina" title="wikilink">North Carolina</a>.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> The new Kinston Eagles were a <a href="Pittsburgh_Pirates" title="wikilink">Pittsburgh Pirates</a> affiliate and featured the town's first <a href="African_American" title="wikilink">African American</a> ball players. In these early days of the <a href="Civil_Rights_Movement" title="wikilink">Civil Rights Movement</a>, the black players in the Carolina League received much verbal and psychological abuse from the largely white, Southern fan base.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> One of these first black Kinston ball players, <a href="Carl_Long_(baseball)" title="wikilink">Carl Long</a>, would excel during the 1956 season and set an <a href="Run_batted_in" title="wikilink">RBI</a> standard (111) that would never be surpassed by any of the Kinston hitters who have come after him.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> The other racial pioneer for Kinston baseball was <a href="Frank_Washington" title="wikilink">Frank Washington</a>, a holdover from the  Burlington team.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> Kinston's owner was an inept businessman who brought the club near bankruptcy before it was moved to <a href="Wilson,_North_Carolina" title="wikilink">Wilson</a> in .<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
<p>Kinston's re-entry into Carolina League baseball in  was successful both on the field and at the turnstile. The Eagles were able to claim the first of its Carolina League crowns. At a time when Kinston's population was only 25,000, the ball club was able to attract over 140,000 fans. Part of the lure for these fans was the talent supplied by Kinston's parent club, the <a href="Pittsburgh_Pirates" title="wikilink">Pittsburgh Pirates</a>, which included <a href="Steve_Blass" title="wikilink">Steve Blass</a> (17-3, 1.97 <a href="Earned_run_average" title="wikilink">ERA</a>, 209 <a href="Strikeout" title="wikilink">K's</a>), and <a href="Frank_Bork" title="wikilink">Frank Bork</a> (19-7, 2.00 ERA).<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> Another attraction for the fans was that for the first time, the Eagles were a community owned team. The Kinston Eagles Baseball Company was a non-profit organization run by an elected eighteen man, unpaid board of directors. Profits went back into improving the stadium, promoting the team, and supplying playing equipment for the youth of Kinston. This arrangement would continue through all thirteen years of Kinston's second tenure in the Carolina League from  through .<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>
<p><img src="68sked.jpg" title="fig:1968 pocket schedule." alt="1968 pocket schedule." width="90" />With the reclassification of minor league baseball in , the Carolina League became a <a href="Minor_league_baseball#Levels_of_competition" title="wikilink">High-A</a> circuit. The Eagles would fail to win any more championships during this second period of Carolina League play, but they managed to make the playoffs following six of the thirteen seasons. The Pirates stuck with Kinston through the  campaign, and the Eagles were managed by <a href="Harding_&quot;Pete&quot;_Peterson" title="wikilink">Harding &quot;Pete&quot; Peterson</a> during three of those four seasons. Pete would later oversee the Pirates <a href="farm_system" title="wikilink">farm system</a> and become the Pirates' general manager, helping to build the late seventies team that won the <a href="World_Series" title="wikilink">World Series</a>.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> The Eagles became affiliated with the new <a href="Atlanta_Braves" title="wikilink">Atlanta Braves</a> during  and  and were managed by <a href="Andy_Pafko" title="wikilink">Andy Pafko</a> during those years.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> From  through , the Eagles had an affiliation with the <a href="New_York_Yankees" title="wikilink">New York Yankees</a>, and the fans saw a lot of future all-stars pass through the city including a young <a href="Ron_Guidry" title="wikilink">Ron Guidry</a> who would establish himself as one of the best <a href="pitcher" title="wikilink">pitchers</a> in the <a href="American_League" title="wikilink">American League</a> soon thereafter.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a></p>
<p>During the 1970s the popularity of minor league baseball reached its lowest point and the attendance in Kinston fell to only 30,000 for the  season. The city needed a revival of interest, and the <a href="Montreal_Expos" title="wikilink">Expos</a> were turned to for help. The young Montreal franchise boasted a strong farm system with a lot of talent. So much talent in fact, that they decided to experiment with having two High A affiliates. Instead of dividing the players evenly between the two High A teams, the <a href="West_Palm_Beach,_Florida" title="wikilink">West Palm Beach</a> club ended up with all the best men while the newly renamed Kinston Expos had to make due with castoffs. The Kinston team soon found itself overmatched among its Carolina League rivals. The Expos fell to last place and attendance fell to only 27,000 for the year. Montreal declared their experiment a failure and withdrew from Kinston following the  season. With no major league sponsor and very little fan support, Kinston withdrew from the league.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a></p>
<p>Former airline pilot <a href="Ray_Kuhlman" title="wikilink">Ray Kuhlman</a> brought minor league baseball back to Kinston by investing in a Carolina League franchise in the late seventies. The renamed Kinston Eagles flew unaffiliated their first season back in the circuit in . By the next campaign, they were associated with the <a href="Toronto_Blue_Jays" title="wikilink">Toronto Blue Jays</a>. Toronto stayed with Kinston for seven years, and the team eventually took on the Blue Jay name. Kinston did not win any championships during the Blue Jays years. Kuhlman and his wife ran the team themselves and oversaw steady annual increases in attendance each year. They brought a string of marketing ideas that have taken hold and remain to this day. These included increased promotional days, fireworks displays, the introduction of Kinston <a href="baseball_card" title="wikilink">baseball cards</a>, an increase in branded souvenir merchandise, the establishment of the <a href="Kinston_Indians#Kinston_Professional_Baseball_Hall_of_Fame" title="wikilink">Kinston Professional Baseball Hall of Fame</a>, and the hiring of a team mascot. Also attracting fans was a collection of future major league stars including <a href="Tony_Fern&lt;U+00E1&gt;ndez" title="wikilink">Tony Fern&lt;U+00E1&gt;ndez</a>, <a href="Fred_McGriff" title="wikilink">Fred McGriff</a>, and <a href="Cecil_Fielder" title="wikilink">Cecil Fielder</a>.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a></p>
<p>Following the  season, the Blue Jays dropped Kinston as a franchise, and professional baseball in the city seemed to be in doubt once again. There was talk of moving the franchise to <a href="Charles_County,_Maryland" title="wikilink">Charles County, Maryland</a>, but the city remained in the Carolina League with an independent ball club that took on the Eagles name.  proved to be disappointing in the standings and at the gate, and talk of a move was renewed, but ownership secured an affiliation with the <a href="Cleveland_Indians" title="wikilink">Cleveland Indians</a> during the off season.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> For more than twenty years, Cleveland and the KTribe, as they have come to be known, have enjoyed a successful partnership which has produced sixteen playoff appearances and five Carolina League championships (, , , , and ).<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> The value of the team has risen along with its onfield success. In , Kuhlman sold the team for one hundred thousand dollars. The franchise was sold in  for two hundred twenty five thousand, and it was sold again in  for seven hundred fifty thousand dollars. The team's value in  was estimated at one and a half million.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a></p>
<p>Six figure attendance totals became the norm throughout the 1990s and into the new century. General Manager North Johnson fostered closer bonds with the mayor's office and helped create the Mayor's Committee for Professional Baseball in .<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> Dedicated to increasing season ticket sales and promoting ties with businesses, the committee accomplished much in a short span of time. Attendance increased by nearly twenty thousand in  and by more than twelve thousand the following year. By , the number of fans through the turnstiles topped 100,000 for the first time since . Although a new ownership group purchased the franchise in , continuity in the day-to-day operations has been maintained through general manager North Johnson, and front office mainstay Shari Massengill who took over the reins in .<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> Ties with the local government also remain strong, as prospects for the start of a second century of baseball in <a href="2008" class="uri" title="wikilink">2008</a> look all but assured with new renovations to the ballpark and a renewed affiliation with Cleveland.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a><a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a></p>
<p>The Kinston Indians are currently managed by <a href="Chris_Tremie" title="wikilink">Chris Tremie</a>, a former major league catcher. Their current <a href="General_Manager" title="wikilink">General Manager</a>, Shari Massengill,<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> and former Assistant General Manager, Jessie Hays, made up the only all-female General Manager/Assistant General Manager team in the Minor Leagues.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> Although Hays has departed for the 2008 season, her replacement, Janell Bullock, is also female.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a></p>
<p>In , the Indians won the Southern Division crown for both halves of the year, but they lost in the first round of the playoffs to the wildcard team, the <a href="Salem_Avalanche" title="wikilink">Salem Avalanche</a>. It was the seventh season in a row that they made the post season which is a new Carolina League record formerly held by the <a href="Burlington_Bees" title="wikilink">Burlington Bees</a> (-).

The original structure was built by architect John J. Rowland in 1949 at a cost of one hundred seventy thousand dollars inclusive of everything except the land. One hundred fifty thousand dollars of the money was raised by bond issue.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> The stadium is owned by the city and leased by the team. A dedicatory plaque identifies the structure as &quot;Municipal Stadium,&quot; but it has been called Grainger Stadium since it was first built.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> Recent ownership has begun to refer to it as &quot;Historic Grainger Stadium&quot; due to its age relative to other fields in the Carolina League. It is currently the second oldest stadium in the circuit. The name Grainger comes from its location on Grainger Avenue as well as its use early on by Grainger High School. Grainger is a prominent old family name in <a href="Lenoir_County,_North_Carolina" title="wikilink">Lenoir County</a>.</p>
<h2 id="annual-awards">Annual Awards</h2>
<p>Each year, usually on the weekend of the last home games, the Kinston Indians present awards to those deserving. The team <a href="Most_Valuable_Player" title="wikilink">MVP</a> Award was named in honor of <a href="Pat_Crawford_(baseball)" title="wikilink">&quot;Cap'n Pat&quot; Crawford</a>.

The boat he was in struck a pier, killing him and fellow reliever <a href="Tim_Crews" title="wikilink">Tim Crews</a> and seriously injuring <a href="Bob_Ojeda" title="wikilink">Bob Ojeda</a>. Kinston's annual award for Pitcher of the Year was named in his honor.</p>
<p>The award given each year to the player who had to overcome the greatest adversity in his career was named in honor of Tex Drake. Drake was one of the <a href="batboy" title="wikilink">batboys</a> for the Kinston Blue Jays starting with the  season. On the last day of the  campaign, he found out that he had <a href="Hodgkin&#39;s_lymphoma" title="wikilink">Hodgkin's Disease</a> which had advanced to all four stages.

<p>The Kinston player who best represents good <a href="sportsmanship" class="uri" title="wikilink">sportsmanship</a> is given an award named for Steve Gaydek. Gaydek was a former member of the club's Board of Directors who became a lifelong fan of Kinston's baseball teams. He attended every home game for over twenty years even though he lived over thirty miles from the ballpark.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a></p>
<p>Lewis B. &quot;Mac&quot; McAvery was the head <a href="groundskeeper" class="uri" title="wikilink">groundskeeper</a> from  to his death in .
