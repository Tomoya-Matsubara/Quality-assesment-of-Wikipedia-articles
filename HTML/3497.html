<p>Johnjo O'Shea is an ordinary 17-year-old, who gives a few friends of his older brother a lift in his brother's car and although he and his family consider him to be an innocent bystander, he ends up in court charged as an accessory to murder, under the doctrine of <a href="common_purpose" title="wikilink">common purpose</a>, the &quot;common&quot; of the film's title.</p>
<h2 id="critical-reception">Critical reception</h2>
<p><a href="The_Daily_Telegraph" title="wikilink">The Daily Telegraph</a> gave it 4/5 stars, calling it &quot;profoundly engaging&quot;, with Nico Mirallegro, &quot;giving a fine performance of coiled vulnerability&quot;.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> According to <a href="The_Guardian" title="wikilink">The Guardian</a>, &quot;When Jimmy McGovern gets off his soapbox this is a brutal and devastating drama&quot;, &quot;bleak, powerful drama thick with political intent, which occasionally robs it of its quality&quot;, and &quot;the knockout performance belongs to Susan Lynch, who plays the victim's mother&quot;.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
