<p>An historic snowstorm struck the Ohio Valley of the United States, as well as Ontario in Canada, on <a href="December_22" title="wikilink">December 22</a> and <a href="December_23" title="wikilink">December 23</a> and is not the same storm that led to snow in Texas on <a href="2004_Christmas_Eve_Snowstorm" title="wikilink">Christmas Eve</a>. It lasted roughly 30 hours, and brought snowfall amounts up to 37 inches (73.7 cm) to portions of the Midwestern <a href="United_States" title="wikilink">United States</a>.

<p>An arctic cold front moved through the Midwest, bringing cold air into the region and a brief 4-10 hour burst of snowfall on <a href="December_22" title="wikilink">December 22</a>. Thereafter, 3-6 hours of freezing rain and sleet fell. The second bout of wintry precipitation, which lasted about 13 hours, was caused by a surface <a href="cyclone" class="uri" title="wikilink">cyclone</a> in the southern stream of the Westerlies which moved northeast from the coastal bend of <a href="Texas" class="uri" title="wikilink">Texas</a> early on <a href="December_22" title="wikilink">December 22</a>, moving across northern <a href="Louisiana" class="uri" title="wikilink">Louisiana</a>, southeast <a href="Arkansas" class="uri" title="wikilink">Arkansas</a>, northwest <a href="Mississippi" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mississippi</a>, then across central <a href="Tennessee" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tennessee</a>, through western <a href="West_Virginia" title="wikilink">West Virginia</a> early on <a href="December_23" title="wikilink">December 23</a>, eastern <a href="Ohio" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ohio</a> and <a href="Pennsylvania" class="uri" title="wikilink">Pennsylvania</a>.</p>
<h2 id="effects">Effects</h2>
<p>Over 20 inches of snow fell across portions of southern Illinois and central Ohio. A band of freezing rain and sleet led to ice and sleet accumulations across western <a href="Tennessee" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tennessee</a>, central <a href="Kentucky" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kentucky</a>, as well as southern and eastern <a href="Ohio" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ohio</a>. Traffic was paralyzed across the region by plane, train, and automobile, during this <a href="winter_storm" title="wikilink">winter storm</a>. Interstate and state highways turned into parking lots as over 100,000 vehicle accidents were caused by the weather. Roofs of buildings caved in under the weight of the ice and snow, especially in areas which measured over 10 inches of snow. Almost a million residences saw power outages and numerous phone lines were downed. Four days of sub-freezing temperatures during and after the storm hampered recovery efforts. States of emergency were declared in Kentucky, Illinois, and Ohio.</p>
