<p><strong>Street</strong> is a village and <a href="Civil_parishes_in_England" title="wikilink">civil parish</a> in the county of <a href="Somerset" class="uri" title="wikilink">Somerset</a>, England, situated on a dry spot in the <a href="Somerset_Levels" title="wikilink">Somerset Levels</a>, at the end of the <a href="Polden_Hills" title="wikilink">Polden Hills</a>, two miles south-west of <a href="Glastonbury" class="uri" title="wikilink">Glastonbury</a>. The village has a <a href="population" class="uri" title="wikilink">population</a> of 11,066.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> Its name comes from a 12th century causeway from <a href="Glastonbury" class="uri" title="wikilink">Glastonbury</a> which was built to transport local <a href="Blue_Lias" title="wikilink">Blue Lias</a> stone from what is now Street to rebuild <a href="Glastonbury_Abbey" title="wikilink">Glastonbury Abbey</a>, although it had previously been known as <strong>Lantokay</strong> and Lega.</p>
<p>There is evidence of Roman occupation. Much of the history of the village is dominated by the Abbey until the <a href="Dissolution_of_the_Monasteries" title="wikilink">Dissolution of the Monasteries</a>. The <a href="Religious_Society_of_Friends" title="wikilink">Society of Friends</a> had become established there by the mid 17th century. One Quaker family, the Clarks, started a business in sheepskin rugs, woollen <a href="slipper" title="wikilink">slippers</a> and, later, <a href="boot" title="wikilink">boots</a> and <a href="shoe" title="wikilink">shoes</a>. This became <a href="C&amp;J_Clark" title="wikilink">C&amp;J Clark</a> which still has its headquarters in Street, but shoes are no longer manufactured there. Instead, in 1993, redundant factory buildings were converted to form <a href="Clarks_Village" title="wikilink">Clarks Village</a>, the first purpose-built factory outlet in the United Kingdom. <a href="The_Shoe_Museum" title="wikilink">The Shoe Museum</a> provides information about the history of Clarks and footwear manufacture in general. The Clark family mansion and its estate at the edge of the village are now owned by <a href="Millfield_School" title="wikilink">Millfield School</a>, an <a href="independent_school_(UK)" title="wikilink">independent</a> co-educational boarding. Street is also home to <a href="Crispin_School" title="wikilink">Crispin School</a> and <a href="Strode_College" title="wikilink">Strode College</a>.</p>
<p>To the north of the town, the <a href="River_Brue" title="wikilink">River Brue</a> marks the boundary with Glastonbury.

The Anglican Parish <a href="Church_of_the_Holy_Trinity,_Street" title="wikilink">Church of The Holy Trinity</a> dates from the 14th century and has been designated by <a href="English_Heritage" title="wikilink">English Heritage</a> as a Grade I <a href="listed_building" title="wikilink">listed building</a>.</p>

<p>The settlement's earliest known name is Lantokay, meaning the sacred enclosure of <a href="Saint_Kea" title="wikilink">Kea</a>, a <a href="Celt" title="wikilink">Celtic</a> <a href="saint" class="uri" title="wikilink">saint</a>.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> In the <a href="Domesday_Book" title="wikilink">Domesday Book</a> it was recorded as Strate,<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> and also Lega, a name still used throughout the country in the modern form, &quot;Leigh&quot;.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> The centre of Street is where Lower Leigh hamlet was, and the road called Middle Leigh and the community called Overleigh are to the south of the village. In the 12th century, a causeway from <a href="Glastonbury" class="uri" title="wikilink">Glastonbury</a> was built to transport stone from what is now Street for rebuilding <a href="Glastonbury_Abbey" title="wikilink">Glastonbury Abbey</a> after a fire,<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> and Street's name is derived from the <a href="Latin" class="uri" title="wikilink">Latin</a> <em>strata</em> - a paved road. The causeway is about  north of a <a href="Roman_Britain" title="wikilink">Roman</a> road. <img src="street_village_from_glastonbury_tor_arp.jpg" title="fig:Street from Glastonbury Tor.

<p>Quarries of the local <a href="blue_lias" title="wikilink">blue lias</a> stone were worked from as early as the 12th century to the end of the 19th century. It is a <a href="formation_(stratigraphy)" title="wikilink">geological formation</a> in southern England, part of the <a href="Lias_Group" title="wikilink">Lias Group</a>. The Blue Lias consists of a sequence of <a href="limestone" class="uri" title="wikilink">limestone</a> and <a href="shale" class="uri" title="wikilink">shale</a> layers, laid down in latest <a href="Triassic" class="uri" title="wikilink">Triassic</a> and early <a href="Jurassic" class="uri" title="wikilink">Jurassic</a> times, between 195 and 200 million years ago.

The form of the large churchyard suggests a <em><a href="Llan_(placename_element)" title="wikilink">lan</a></em>, a sacred area of a kind that was built in the first half of the 6th century.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> Llan or Lan is a common place name element in <a href="Brythonic_languages" title="wikilink">Brythonic languages</a> such as <a href="Welsh_language" title="wikilink">Welsh</a>, <a href="Cornish_language" title="wikilink">Cornish</a>, <a href="Breton_language" title="wikilink">Breton</a>, <a href="Cumbric_language" title="wikilink">Cumbric</a>, and possibly <a href="Pictish_language" title="wikilink">Pictish</a>.

<p>One biography of <a href="St_Gildas" title="wikilink">St Gildas</a> has the saint spending some time in Glastonbury Abbey, and moving to a site by the river, where he built a chapel to the Holy Trinity and there died.

<p><a href="Sharpham" title="wikilink">Sharpham Park</a> is a  historic park, approximately  west of Street, which dates back to the <a href="Bronze_Age" title="wikilink">Bronze Age</a>.

From 1539 to 1707 the park was owned by the <a href="Duke_of_Somerset" title="wikilink">Duke of Somerset</a>, Sir <a href="Edward_Seymour,_1st_Duke_of_Somerset" title="wikilink">Edward Seymour</a>, brother of <a href="Jane_Seymour" title="wikilink">Queen Jane</a>; the <a href="Thomas_Thynne,_1st_Marquess_of_Bath" title="wikilink">Thynne</a> family of <a href="Longleat" class="uri" title="wikilink">Longleat</a>, and the family of Sir <a href="Henry_Gould" title="wikilink">Henry Gould</a>. <a href="Edward_Dyer" title="wikilink">Edward Dyer</a> was born here in 1543.

<p>Ivythorn Manor on Pages Hill was a medieval monastic house. It was rebuilt in 1488 for Abbot John Selwood of Glastonbury Abbey. After the dissolution of the monasteries it became a manor house owned by the Marshall and Sydenham families. Sir John Sydenham added a wing 1578 which was later demolished. By 1834 the house was largely ruined until its restoration around 1904, and a west wing was added in 1938. It is a Grade II* <a href="listed_building" title="wikilink">listed building</a>.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>

<p>The <a href="Parish_councils_in_England" title="wikilink">parish council</a> is responsible for some local issues, and sets an annual precept (local rate) to cover its council&lt;U+2019&gt;s operating costs. The parish council evaluates local planning applications and works with the local police, district council officers, and <a href="Neighbourhood_Watch_(UK)" title="wikilink">neighbourhood watch</a> groups on matters of crime, security, and traffic. The parish council also initiates projects for the maintenance and repair of parish facilities, and consults with the district council on the maintenance, repair, and improvement of highways, drainage, footpaths, public transport, and street cleaning. Conservation (including trees and listed buildings) and environmental issues are also the responsibility of the council.
