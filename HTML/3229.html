<p>D.C. United entered the tournament as the competition's defending champions. They had previously won the <a href="1996_U.S._Open_Cup" title="wikilink">tournament in 1996</a> as well.

<p>The U.S. Open Cup is an annual American soccer competition open to all <a href="United_States_Soccer_Federation" title="wikilink">United States Soccer Federation</a> affiliated teams, from amateur adult club teams to the professional clubs of <a href="Major_League_Soccer" title="wikilink">Major League Soccer</a> (MLS). Each year, Major League Soccer, which has teams that play in both the United States and Canada, is allowed to enter eight of its U.S.-based teams in the tournament. The top six MLS teams from the previous season qualify automatically, and the remaining two spots are determined by preliminary <a href="2009_Lamar_Hunt_U.S._Open_Cup_qualification" title="wikilink">qualification matches</a>. The eight MLS entries begin play in the third round of the tournament.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>

The fourth official made a call and the ref made the final decision. That was it. I've got no excuses for it. Tremendously, very, very disappointing.&quot;<a href="#fn69" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref69"><sup>69</sup></a> One month after the stomping incident, U.S. Soccer announced that Wicks would be suspended from the U.S. Open Cup tournament for five matches.<a href="#fn70" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a></p>
<p>After the victory, many Sounders FC fans gathered at <a href="King_County_International_Airport" title="wikilink">King County International Airport</a> to greet the team as they returned to Seattle.<a href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a> The trophy was put on display at several events around Seattle in the weeks following Sounders FC's victory. On September 19, the cup was presented to Sounders FC fans to carry in the <a href="Seattle_Sounders_FC#Supporters" title="wikilink">March to the Match</a> prior to a Sounders FC league game at Qwest Field against <a href="C.D._Chivas_USA" title="wikilink">Chivas USA</a>.<a href="#fn72" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref72"><sup>72</sup></a></p>

United received $50,000 as the tournament runner-up.<a href="#fn74" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref74"><sup>74</sup></a> Kevin Forrest, whose game-winning goal against Colorado allowed Sounders FC to qualify for the tournament, received a share of the prize money and a medal, despite being released by the team before the final.<a href="#fn75" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref75"><sup>75</sup></a></p>
<p>In January 2010, the club's success in the U.S. Open Cup tournament was listed among the many reasons the <a href="Washington_State_Senate" title="wikilink">Washington State Senate</a> passed a resolution honoring Sounders FC.<a href="#fn76" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref76"><sup>76</sup></a></p>
<p>On October 5, 2010, Seattle returned to the <a href="2010_Lamar_Hunt_U.S._Open_Cup_Final" title="wikilink">final</a> and defeated the <a href="Columbus_Crew" title="wikilink">Columbus Crew</a> 2–1 to repeat as U.S. Open Cup champion.<a href="#fn77" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref77"><sup>77</sup></a> This time Sounders FC hosted the final at Qwest Field, drawing an attendance of 31,311 which broke the 81-year-old record for the event.<a href="#fn78" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref78"><sup>78</sup></a></p>
