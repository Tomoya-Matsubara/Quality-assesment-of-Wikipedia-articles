<p><strong>Roach Motel</strong> is a brand of a <a href="roach_bait" title="wikilink">roach bait</a> device designed to catch <a href="cockroach" title="wikilink">cockroaches</a>. Although the term is the subject of a <a href="trademark" class="uri" title="wikilink">trademark</a> registration by the insect control brand <a href="Black_Flag_(insecticide)" title="wikilink">Black Flag</a>, the phrase has come to be used as a reference to all traps that use a <a href="scent" class="uri" title="wikilink">scent</a> or other form of <a href="bait_(luring_substance)" title="wikilink">bait</a> to lure cockroaches into a compartment in which a sticky substance causes them to become trapped. Introduced in late 1976 in response to the success of D-Con's roach trap, the Roach Motel quickly became a successful entrant in the industry. By 1979, <em><a href="New_York_Magazine" title="wikilink">New York Magazine</a></em> reported:</p>

<p>Early versions of the Roach Motels used food-based bait, but later designs incorporated <a href="pheromone" title="wikilink">pheromones</a>. The widely known <a href="tagline" class="uri" title="wikilink">tagline</a> of the Roach Motel was &quot;Roaches check in, but they don't check out!&quot;</p>
<p>The name &quot;Roach Motel&quot; is United States federal trademark No. 1,059,314, for which Black Flag claims a date of earliest use of May 7, 1976.</p>
