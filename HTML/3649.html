In 1999, he signed with <a href="World_Championship_Wrestling" title="wikilink">World Championship Wrestling</a> (WCW), and gained fame as &quot;Sugar&quot; Shane Helms, a member of <a href="3_Count" title="wikilink">3 Count</a>. During his time there he won both the <a href="WCW_Hardcore_Championship" title="wikilink">WCW Hardcore Championship</a> and the <a href="WWE_Cruiserweight_Championship" title="wikilink">WCW Cruiserweight title</a>. When WCW was bought by the <a href="World_Wrestling_Entertainment" title="wikilink">World Wrestling Federation</a> (WWF) (now WWE), Helms' contract was kept by WWF. Helms renamed himself &quot;The Hurricane&quot; and won the <a href="WWE_Cruiserweight_Championship" title="wikilink">WWE Cruiserweight Championship</a>. He later picked up a sidekick, <a href="Matt_Anoa&#39;i" title="wikilink">Rosey</a>, and they won the <a href="World_Tag_Team_Championship_(WWE)" title="wikilink">World Tag Team Championship</a> together.</p>
<p>He dropped the superhero <a href="List_of_professional_wrestling_terms#G" title="wikilink">gimmick</a> in 2005, and began wrestling under his real name. He once again won the Cruiserweight Championship in early 2006, and held it for over a year, becoming the longest reigning Cruiserweight Champion in history (385 days) and the longest reigning champion of any kind in <em>SmackDown</em> history. After being out of action for over a year after neck fusion surgery Helms returned to <em>SmackDown</em> in September 2008, referring to himself as Hurricane Helms, before moving to the ECW brand where he reverted to his Gregory Helms name, and became the backstage interviewer. In mid-2009, he brought back The Hurricane character, and currently appears as both Gregory Helms and The Hurricane on <em>ECW</em>.</p>
