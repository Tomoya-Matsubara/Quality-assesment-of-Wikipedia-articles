<p>With the help of hundreds of volunteers, Aruban investigators conducted an extensive search for Holloway.

<p>Holloway's family has criticized Aruban investigators throughout the search for a perceived lack of progress in finding Natalee. Holloway's family called for a <a href="boycott" class="uri" title="wikilink">boycott</a> of Aruba, which gained <a href="Alabama" class="uri" title="wikilink">Alabama</a> Governor <a href="Bob_Riley" title="wikilink">Bob Riley</a>'s support, but failed to gain widespread support.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a><a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a></p>

<h2 id="investigation">Investigation</h2>
<p>The investigation into Holloway's disappearance began shortly after she missed her flight home. The island of Aruba has been extensively searched, especially in the month following Holloway's disappearance, though searches continue. Ten individuals have been arrested on suspicion of involvement in Holloway's disappearance, however, no charges have been filed against anyone.</p>
<h3 id="early-investigation">Early investigation</h3>
<p><img src="CarlosnCharliesAruba.jpg" title="fig:Carlos&#39;n Charlie&#39;s, where Holloway was last seen, in Oranjestad, Aruba" alt="Carlos&#39;n Charlie&#39;s, where Holloway was last seen, in Oranjestad, Aruba" /> On <a href="May_30" title="wikilink">May 30</a>, <a href="2005" class="uri" title="wikilink">2005</a>, immediately following Holloway's missed flight, Jug and Beth Twitty traveled to Aruba with friends by private jet.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> Within four hours of landing in Aruba, the Twittys presented the Aruban police with the name and address of Van der Sloot as the person with whom Holloway left the nightclub.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> Beth Twitty has stated that Van der Sloot's full name was given to her by the night manager at the Holiday Inn.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> The Twittys and their friends, with two Aruban policemen, went to the Van der Sloot home looking for Holloway. Van der Sloot initially denied knowing Holloway's name, but he then told the following story, with which Deepak Kalpoe, who was present, agreed:<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> Van der Sloot related that they drove Holloway to the <a href="California_Lighthouse" title="wikilink">California Lighthouse</a> area of <a href="Arashi_Beach" title="wikilink">Arashi Beach</a> because Holloway wanted to see sharks, before dropping Holloway off at her hotel around 2:00Â a.m.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a> According to Van der Sloot, Holloway fell down as she exited the car but refused Van der Sloot's help.<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> He stated that she was then approached by a dark man in a black shirt similar to those worn by security guards as the young men drove away.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a></p>
<p>Searches for Holloway began soon afterwards. Hundreds of volunteers from Aruba and the United States joined the search. During the first days of the search, the Aruban government gave thousands of civil servants the day off to participate in the search.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a> Fifty Dutch marines conducted an extensive search of the shoreline.<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a> Aruban banks raised $20,000 and provided other support to aid volunteer search teams.<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a> Beth Twitty was provided with free housing, initially at the Holiday Inn where she stayed in her daughter's former room,<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a> and then at the nearby <a href="Wyndham_Hotels_&amp;_Resorts" title="wikilink">Wyndham Hotel</a>, where she stayed in the presidential suite.<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a></p>
<p>Reports indicate Holloway did not appear on any <a href="security_camera" title="wikilink">security camera</a> footage from her hotel's lobby during the course of the night,<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a> but it is unclear whether the security cameras at the hotel were actually working that night. According to an <a href="April_19" title="wikilink">April 19</a>, <a href="2006" class="uri" title="wikilink">2006</a>, statement made by Beth Twitty, the security cameras at the Holiday Inn were not working the night Holloway vanished.<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a> Twitty has made other statements indicating that they were working, and has stated so in her book.<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a><a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a><a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a> The search for physical evidence was extensive and, on occasion, subject to false leads; for example, a possible blood sample taken from Deepak Kalpoe's car was tested but determined not to be blood.<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="initial-arrests">Initial arrests</h3>
<p>On <a href="June_5" title="wikilink">June 5</a>, Aruban police detained Antonius (&quot;Mickey&quot;) John and Abraham Jones, former security guards<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a> for the nearby Allegro Hotel,<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a> which was then closed for renovation,<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a> on suspicion of murder and kidnapping.<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a> The initial reason for their arrests has never been officially disclosed; however, according to news accounts, the Van der Sloot and Kalpoe statements may have been a factor in the arrests.<a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a><a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a> Reports also indicate that the two former guards were known for cruising hotels to pick up women, and at least one of them had a prior incident with law enforcement.<a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a> John and Jones were released on <a href="June_13" title="wikilink">June 13</a> without being charged.<a href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a></p>
<p>Van der Sloot and the Kalpoe brothers were arrested <a href="June_9" title="wikilink">June 9</a>, <a href="2005" class="uri" title="wikilink">2005</a>, on suspicion of kidnapping and murdering Holloway.<a href="#fn67" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a> Aruban law allows for arrest on serious suspicion from investigators; to continue holding the suspect in custody an increasing evidentiary burden must be met at periodic reviews.<a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a><a href="#fn69" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref69"><sup>69</sup></a> According to Commissioner Gerold Dompig of the Aruban police, who would lead the investigation from mid-2005 until 2006, the focus was on these three suspects from the &quot;get-go&quot;.<a href="#fn70" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a> Dompig stated that surveillance of the three began three days after Holloway was reported missing, and included surveillance, telephone wire taps, and even monitoring of their e-mail.<a href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a> Dompig indicated pressure from Holloway's family caused them to stop their surveillance prematurely and to detain the three suspects.<a href="#fn72" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref72"><sup>72</sup></a></p>
<p>As the investigation continued, on <a href="June_11" title="wikilink">June 11</a>, David Cruz, spokesman for the Aruban Minister of Justice, indicated that Natalee Holloway was dead and authorities knew the location of her body.<a href="#fn73" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref73"><sup>73</sup></a> Cruz later retracted the statement, saying he was a victim of a &quot;misinformation campaign&quot;.<a href="#fn74" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref74"><sup>74</sup></a> That evening, Dompig alleged to the <a href="Associated_Press" title="wikilink">Associated Press</a> that one of the young men detained admitted &quot;something bad happened&quot; to Holloway after the suspects took her to the beach, and that the suspect was leading police to the scene of the crime.<a href="#fn75" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref75"><sup>75</sup></a> The next morning prosecution spokeswoman Vivian van der Biezen refused to confirm the allegation, simply stating that the investigation was at a &quot;very crucial, very important moment&quot;.<a href="#fn76" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref76"><sup>76</sup></a></p>
<p>On Friday, <a href="June_17" title="wikilink">June 17</a>, a fourth person, later identified as <a href="disc_jockey" title="wikilink">disc jockey</a> Steve Gregory Croes, was also arrested. Police Commissioner Jan van der Straten, who briefly headed the investigation before his retirement, told the media that &quot;Croes was detained based on information from one of the other three detainees.&quot;<a href="#fn77" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref77"><sup>77</sup></a> On <a href="June_22" title="wikilink">June 22</a> Aruban police detained Paulus van der Sloot, Joran van der Sloot's father, for questioning; Paulus van der Sloot was arrested that same day. Both Paulus van der Sloot and Croes were ordered to be released on <a href="June_26" title="wikilink">June 26</a>.<a href="#fn78" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref78"><sup>78</sup></a></p>
<p>During this period the remaining detained suspects' stories changed.<a href="#fn79" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref79"><sup>79</sup></a> All three suspects indicated that Van der Sloot and Holloway were dropped off at the Marriott Hotel beach near the fishermen's huts. Van der Sloot stated that he did not harm Holloway, but left her on the beach.<a href="#fn80" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref80"><sup>80</sup></a> According to Satish Kalpoe's attorney, David Kock, Van der Sloot called Deepak Kalpoe to tell the latter that he was walking home, and sent him a text message forty minutes later.<a href="#fn81" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref81"><sup>81</sup></a></p>
<p>At some time during the interrogation Van der Sloot detailed a third account, that he was dropped off at home and Holloway was driven off by the Kalpoe brothers.<a href="#fn82" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref82"><sup>82</sup></a> Dompig discounted the story, stating:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This latest story [came] when [Van der Sloot] saw the other guys, the Kalpoes, were kind of finger-pointing in his direction, and he wanted to screw them also, by saying he was dropped off. But that story doesn't check out at all. He just wanted to screw Deepak. They had great arguments about this in front of the judge. Because their stories didn't match. This girl, she was from Alabama, she's not going to stay in the car with two black kids. We believe the second story, that they were dropped off by the Marriott.<a href="#fn83" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref83"><sup>83</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>On Monday, <a href="July_4" title="wikilink">July 4</a>, following a hearing before a judge, Deepak and Satish Kalpoe were released, but Joran van der Sloot was detained for an additional sixty days.<a href="#fn84" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref84"><sup>84</sup></a></p>

<p>A small pond near the Aruba Racquet Club close to the Marriott Hotel beach was partly drained between <a href="July_27" title="wikilink">July 27</a> and <a href="July_30" title="wikilink">July 30</a>, <a href="2005" class="uri" title="wikilink">2005</a>, after an individual (&quot;the gardener&quot;<a href="#fn88" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref88"><sup>88</sup></a>) came forward. According to Jug Twitty, the gardener claimed to have seen Joran van der Sloot attempting to hide his face, driving into the Racquet Club with the two Kalpoes on the morning of <a href="May_30" title="wikilink">May 30</a> between 2:30 and 3:00Â a.m.<a href="#fn89" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref89"><sup>89</sup></a> <a href="Nancy_Grace" title="wikilink">Nancy Grace</a> described the gardener as &quot;the man whose testimony cracks the case wide open&quot;.<a href="#fn90" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref90"><sup>90</sup></a> Another individual, &quot;the jogger&quot;,<a href="#fn91" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref91"><sup>91</sup></a> claimed to have seen men burying a blonde-haired woman in a <a href="landfill" class="uri" title="wikilink">landfill</a> during the afternoon of <a href="May_30" title="wikilink">May 30</a>.<a href="#fn92" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref92"><sup>92</sup></a> The police had searched the landfill in the days following Holloway's disappearance.<a href="#fn93" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref93"><sup>93</sup></a> The landfill was searched three times after the jogger's statements, including a search by the FBI with <a href="detection_dog" title="wikilink">cadaver dogs</a>.<a href="#fn94" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref94"><sup>94</sup></a> The searches were fruitless.<a href="#fn95" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref95"><sup>95</sup></a></p>

Van der Sloot's mother, Anita van der Sloot, stated, &quot;It's a desperate attempt to get the boys to talk. But there is nothing to talk about&quot;.<a href="#fn100" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref100"><sup>100</sup></a> While no public explanation was then made for the Kalpoe rearrests, Dompig later said that it was an unsuccessful attempt to pressure the Kalpoe brothers into confessing.<a href="#fn101" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref101"><sup>101</sup></a></p>

During the interview, Van der Sloot indicated that Holloway wanted to have sex with him, but he did not because he did not have a <a href="condom" class="uri" title="wikilink">condom</a>.<a href="#fn104" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref104"><sup>104</sup></a> Van der Sloot stated that Holloway wanted them to stay on the beach, but that he had to go to school in the morning.

<p>In March 2008, news reports indicated that the tables had been turned on Van der Eem, who himself was secretly taped after giving an interview for Aruban TV. Van der Eem, under the impression that cameras had been turned off, kept talking. Van der Eem disclosed that he had been a friend of Van der Sloot for years (contradicting his statement on the De Vries show that he had met Van der Sloot in 2007), that he expects to become a millionaire off his involvement in the Holloway case, and that he knew the person who supposedly disposed of Holloway's body&lt;U+2014&gt;and that Van der Sloot had asked him for two thousand <a href="euro" title="wikilink">euros</a> to buy the man's silence.

<p>The De Vries broadcast was discussed in a seminar by Dutch legal psychologist Willem Albert Wagenaar, who noted the material was not a confession. Wagenaar criticized De Vries for broadcasting the material, stating that the broadcast made it harder to obtain a conviction, and had De Vries turned over the material to the authorities without broadcasting it, they would have held &quot;all the trumps&quot; in questioning Van der Sloot. Mr. Wagenaar opined that not only is the case not solved, it is not even clear that a crime was committed.

According to the lawsuit filed by the Kalpoe brothers, she has (on various television programs) repeatedly accused them, and Joran van der Sloot, of &quot;sexual assault&quot; and &quot;gang rape&quot; of her daughter.<a href="#fn191" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref191"><sup>191</sup></a><a href="#fn192" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref192"><sup>192</sup></a></p>
<p>Twitty has also been criticized for making what have been deemed to be inconsistent and contradictory statements (for example, as to whether there were operating security cameras at the Holiday Inn). According to Julia Renfro, U.S.-born owner of the Aruban tourist-oriented newspaper, <em>Aruba Today</em>, who befriended Twitty in the early days of the investigation, Twitty pandered to tabloid TV and her &quot;behavior was odd from the get-go&quot;.<a href="#fn193" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref193"><sup>193</sup></a> Renfro noted that &quot;Twitty immediately concluded that her daughter had been kidnapped and made no effort to check hospitals or police&quot;,<a href="#fn194" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref194"><sup>194</sup></a> adding that within a couple of days, after fixing responsibility on Joran van der Sloot, Twitty &quot;was telling TV interviewers that she knew her daughter had been gang-raped and murdered&quot;.<a href="#fn195" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref195"><sup>195</sup></a></p>
<p>Following the airing of the De Vries program, Beth Twitty, adhering to the position that the tapes represent the way events transpired, told the <em>New York Post</em> that she believes her daughter might still be alive if Van der Sloot had called for help. She contends that Van der Sloot dumped Holloway's body, possibly alive, into the Caribbean.<a href="#fn196" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref196"><sup>196</sup></a> Twitty also alleges that the individual Joran van der Sloot supposedly called that evening was his father, Paulus, who, according to Twitty, &quot;orchestrated what to do next&quot;.<a href="#fn197" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref197"><sup>197</sup></a> She, and Dave Holloway, alleged that Joran van der Sloot was receiving &quot;special legal favors&quot;.<a href="#fn198" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref198"><sup>198</sup></a> After the court decision not to rearrest Van der Sloot was affirmed, Twitty stated, &quot;I think that what I do take comfort in, his life is a living hell.&quot;<a href="#fn199" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref199"><sup>199</sup></a></p>
<p>In response to Holloway's disappearance, Twitty founded the International Safe Travels Foundation.<a href="#fn200" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref200"><sup>200</sup></a> The foundation is a non-profit organization, designed &quot;to inform and educate the public to help them travel more safely as they travel internationally&quot;.<a href="#fn201" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref201"><sup>201</sup></a> Twitty is working with <a href="Auburn_University" title="wikilink">Auburn University</a> to develop a curriculum that she hopes &quot;will be the foremost authority on travel education&quot;.<a href="#fn202" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref202"><sup>202</sup></a></p>
<p>Twitty's book <em>Loving Natalee: A Mother's Testament of Hope and Faith</em>,<a href="#fn203" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref203"><sup>203</sup></a> written under the name &quot;Beth Holloway&quot;, which she has resumed following her divorce from Jug Twitty, was released on <a href="October_2" title="wikilink">October 2</a>, <a href="2007" class="uri" title="wikilink">2007</a>.<a href="#fn204" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref204"><sup>204</sup></a><a href="#fn205" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref205"><sup>205</sup></a> The release was accompanied by a number of TV appearances, including a full hour on <em>On the Record</em>. Twitty continues to make television appearances when there are new developments in the case.</p>

<h2 id="criticism-of-the-investigation">Criticism of the investigation</h2>
<p><img src="NataleeHollowayWall-female.jpg" title="fig:Young female signs a prayer wall erected in memory of Holloway" alt="Young female signs a prayer wall erected in memory of Holloway" /> The Twittys and their supporters criticized a perceived lack of progress by Aruban police.<a href="#fn206" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref206"><sup>206</sup></a><a href="#fn207" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref207"><sup>207</sup></a> The Twittys' own actions in Aruba were also criticized, and the Twittys were accused of actively stifling any evidence that might impugn Holloway's character by asking her fellow students to remain silent about the case and using their access to the media to push their own version of events. The Twittys denied this.<a href="#fn208" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref208"><sup>208</sup></a></p>
<p>While initially the Twittys discouraged a travel boycott of Aruba, this changed by September 2005. Beth Twitty urged that persons not travel to Aruba because of what she stated were tourist safety issues. Alabama <a href="Governor" class="uri" title="wikilink">Governor</a> <a href="Bob_Riley_(Alabama)" title="wikilink">Bob Riley</a>, joined by the Twittys, urged Alabamians and others to boycott Aruba on <a href="November_8" title="wikilink">November 8</a>, <a href="2005" class="uri" title="wikilink">2005</a>, in a news conference.<a href="#fn209" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref209"><sup>209</sup></a> Riley also wrote to other United States governors seeking their support&lt;U+2014&gt;the governors of Georgia and Arkansas eventually joined in the call for boycott. The <a href="Philadelphia,_Pennsylvania" title="wikilink">Philadelphia, Pennsylvania</a>, city council voted to ask the governor of Pennsylvania to call for a boycott.<a href="#fn210" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref210"><sup>210</sup></a> The governor did not join in the call for a boycott, and no federal support was given.<a href="#fn211" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref211"><sup>211</sup></a><a href="#fn212" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref212"><sup>212</sup></a></p>
<p>The boycott was supported by some of Alabama's Congressional delegation, including both senators and Congressman <a href="Spencer_Bachus" title="wikilink">Spencer Bachus</a> (R-Ala.), who represents Mountain Brook. Senator <a href="Richard_Shelby" title="wikilink">Richard Shelby</a> (R-Ala.) voiced his support for the boycott in a letter to the <a href="American_Society_of_Travel_Agents" title="wikilink">American Society of Travel Agents</a>.<a href="#fn213" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref213"><sup>213</sup></a> Shelby stated, &quot;For the safety, security and wellbeing of our citizens, I do not believe that we can trust that we will be protected while in Aruba&quot;.<a href="#fn214" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref214"><sup>214</sup></a> Prime Minister Oduber stated that Aruban investigators have done their best to solve the mystery, and responded to the call for boycott, &quot;This is a preposterous and irresponsible act. We are not guerillas. We are not terrorists. We don't pose a threat to the United States, nor to Alabama.&quot;<a href="#fn215" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref215"><sup>215</sup></a></p>
<p>Members of the Aruba Hotel and Tourism Association, the Aruba Tourism Authority, the Aruba Hospitality and Security Foundation, the Aruban Chamber of Commerce and government figures, including Public Relations Representative Ruben Trapenberg, formed an &quot;Aruba Strategic Communications Task Force&quot; to respond collectively to what they perceived to be unfounded and/or negative portrayals of the island.<a href="#fn216" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref216"><sup>216</sup></a> The group issued press releases and sent representatives to appear in news media. They joined the Aruban government in opposing the calls for a boycott of the island.</p>

<p>On <a href="September_15" title="wikilink">September 15</a>, <a href="2005" class="uri" title="wikilink">2005</a>, the <em><a href="Dr._Phil_(TV_series)" title="wikilink">Dr. Phil</a></em> television show showed parts of a hidden-camera interview with Deepak Kalpoe in which Kalpoe seems to answer &quot;She did. You'd be surprised how easy it was.&quot; to a suggestion that Holloway had sex with all of them.<a href="#fn217" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref217"><sup>217</sup></a> The taping had been instigated by Jamie Skeeters, a private investigator. When the tape was broadcast, news reports indicated an expectation of a rearrest, which Dompig termed a &quot;strong possiblity&quot; if the tapes were legitimate.<a href="#fn218" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref218"><sup>218</sup></a></p>
<p>Despite an unsuccessful attempt by the Dr. Phil show to condition release of the tapes on Aruban authorities appearing on their show,<a href="#fn219" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref219"><sup>219</sup></a> Aruban police and the FBI obtained the original of the tape, and provided copies to the media. In the version of the tapes provided by Aruban authorities, Kalpoe appears to say &quot;No, she didn't.&quot;<a href="#fn220" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref220"><sup>220</sup></a> The Dutch forensic institute investigated the credibility of the tapes, and concluded that the version aired on the Dr. Phil show was a manipulated version of the original, and that Kalpoe actually said &quot;No, she didn't,&quot; followed by, &quot;You'd be surprised how simple it would have been.&quot;<a href="#fn221" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref221"><sup>221</sup></a></p>
<p>In December 2006, the Kalpoes filed a slander and libel suit against Dr. Phil and Skeeters (who died in January 2007)<a href="#fn222" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref222"><sup>222</sup></a> in Los Angeles.<a href="#fn223" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref223"><sup>223</sup></a> Beth Twitty and Dave Holloway responded by filing a wrongful death lawsuit against the Kalpoes in the same venue. The wrongful death suit was dismissed for lack of personal jurisdiction on <a href="June_1" title="wikilink">June 1</a>, <a href="2007" class="uri" title="wikilink">2007</a>; the libel and slander case remains pending.<a href="#fn224" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref224"><sup>224</sup></a> An earlier lawsuit had been filed in <a href="New_York_City" title="wikilink">New York City</a> by the parents against Paulus and Joran van der Sloot and served on them on a visit to New York.

<p>On <a href="November_10" title="wikilink">November 10</a>, <a href="2005" class="uri" title="wikilink">2005</a>, Paulus van der Sloot won an unjust detention action against the Aruban government, clearing him as a suspect and allowing him to retain his government contract.<a href="#fn226" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref226"><sup>226</sup></a> The elder Van der Sloot then brought a second action, seeking monetary damages for himself and his family because of his false arrest.<a href="#fn227" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref227"><sup>227</sup></a><a href="#fn228" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref228"><sup>228</sup></a> The action was initially successful, but the award of damages was reversed on appeal.<a href="#fn229" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref229"><sup>229</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="amigoe-article"><em>Amigoe</em> article</h3>
<p>On <a href="July_3" title="wikilink">July 3</a> <a href="2007" class="uri" title="wikilink">2007</a>, the <a href="Netherlands_Antilles" title="wikilink">Netherlands Antilles</a> newspaper <em>Amigoe</em> reported on a documentary video being produced by Ren&lt;U+00E9&gt;e Gielen, previously best known for expos&lt;U+00E9&gt; documentaries about <a href="Curacao" class="uri" title="wikilink">Curacao</a>'s Bon Futuro prison. The video was based in part on interviews with Dompig and with Renfro.</p>
<p>According to interviews done in preparation for the film, Aruban authorities had been systematically obstructed in their investigation by the FBI and other American authorities. They also indicate that within a day of Holloway being declared missing, a <a href="medjet" class="uri" title="wikilink">medjet</a>, unauthorized by Aruban authorities, had arrived on Aruba and had remained for several days. They further indicate that, while the purpose of the medjet was not even known to its crew and medical personnel, it was in fact to spirit Holloway off the island if she were freed from a drug house in Oranjestad. Holloway's departure was to be covert and without notice to local authorities.<a href="#fn230" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref230"><sup>230</sup></a></p>
<p>The article states that Renfro and Beth Twitty received a phone call from an unknown woman on <a href="June_2" title="wikilink">June 2</a>, <a href="2005" class="uri" title="wikilink">2005</a>. That woman was offering information about Holloway's location and the information that Holloway was still alive but was unwilling to return to her mother. Further information was offered for $4,000. Twitty was unwilling to pay more than $1,000 for the information, and in fact did not pay anything. Believing there was a good chance of finding Holloway, Renfro and another American went to the drug house where Holloway supposedly was, bringing money. However, they found that Jug Twitty had already been to the area, spreading &quot;a lot of uproar and panic in the direct vicinity&quot;, and nothing could be accomplished.<a href="#fn231" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref231"><sup>231</sup></a> They blamed Jug Twitty for the failure.<a href="#fn232" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref232"><sup>232</sup></a> The same story, in less detail, appears in the <em>Vanity Fair</em> article.<a href="#fn233" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref233"><sup>233</sup></a></p>
<p>Further, according to Amigoe's report on the interviews, Aruban authorities were obstructed at the highest level in their attempts to investigate Holloway's relatives, and they received very limited cooperation in their attempts to question Holloway's fellow graduates.<a href="#fn234" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref234"><sup>234</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="media-coverage">Media coverage</h2>
<p><img src="NataleeHollowayWall-NewsCrews.jpg" title="fig:News crews covering the Holloway disappearance, June 10, 2005" alt="News crews covering the Holloway disappearance, June 10, 2005" /> <a href="List_of_United_States_broadcast_television_networks" title="wikilink">U.S. television networks</a> devoted much air time to the search for Holloway, the investigation of her disappearance, and rumors surrounding the case. <a href="Greta_Van_Susteren" title="wikilink">Greta Van Susteren</a>, host of <em><a href="On_the_Record_with_Greta_Van_Susteren" title="wikilink">On The Record</a></em> on <a href="Fox_News" title="wikilink">Fox News</a>, and Nancy Grace on <a href="CNN" class="uri" title="wikilink">CNN</a>'s <em><a href="Headline_News" title="wikilink">Headline News</a></em> were among the most prominent television personalities to devote time to the incident. Van Susteren's almost continuous coverage of the story caused <em>On The Record</em> to get its best ratings to date,<a href="#fn235" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref235"><sup>235</sup></a> while Grace's show became the cornerstone of the new &quot;Headline Prime&quot; block on Headline News, which ran two episodes (a live show and a repeat) every night during prime-time. As the case wore on, much of the attention was given to Beth Twitty and her statements.<a href="#fn236" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref236"><sup>236</sup></a> Aruban government spokesman Ruben Trapenberg stated, &quot;The case is under a microscope, and the world is watching.&quot;<a href="#fn237" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref237"><sup>237</sup></a> Locally, the Aruban press published extensive news on the story in Dutch, English, and Papiamento.</p>
<p>The saturation of coverage triggered a backlash among some critics who believe that the extensive coverage of the Holloway case validates the theory known as <a href="missing_white_woman_syndrome" title="wikilink">missing white woman syndrome</a>, which argues that missing-person cases involving <a href="White_(people)" title="wikilink">white</a> women and girls receive disproportionate attention in the media compared with cases involving males or non-white people. CNN ran a segment criticizing the amount of coverage their competitors gave to the story despite what they perceived to be a lack of new items to report, with CNN news anchor <a href="Anderson_Cooper" title="wikilink">Anderson Cooper</a> calling the coverage &quot;downright ridiculous&quot;.<a href="#fn238" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref238"><sup>238</sup></a></p>
<p>Early in the case, political commentator and columnist <a href="Arianna_Huffington" title="wikilink">Arianna Huffington</a> wrote, &quot;If you were to get your news only from television, you'd think the top issue facing our country right now is an 18-year-old girl named Natalee who went missing in Aruba. Every time one of these stories comes up, like, say, <a href="Michael_Jackson" title="wikilink">Michael Jackson</a>, when it's finally over I think, what a relief, now we can get back to real news. But we never do.&quot;<a href="#fn239" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref239"><sup>239</sup></a></p>
<p>In March 2008, <em><a href="El_Diario" title="wikilink">El Diario</a></em> commented, &quot;But if doubts persist about cases involving missing <a href="Latino" title="wikilink">Latinas</a>, there are reasons why. These cases rarely receive the attention and resources we see given to other missing persons. The English-language media, for example, appear to be focused on the stories of missing white women, such as with the disappearance of Natalee Holloway in Aruba. Cases of missing Latina and African American women often remain faceless, when they are even covered.&quot;<a href="#fn240" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref240"><sup>240</sup></a></p>
<p>CBS senior journalist Danna Walker stated, &quot;There is criticism that it is only a story because she is a pretty blonde&lt;U+2013&gt;and white &lt;U+2013&gt;and it is criticism that journalists are taking to heart and looking elsewhere for other stories. But it is a big story because it is an American girl who went off on an adventure, and didn't come back. It is a huge mystery, it is something people can identify with.&quot;<a href="#fn241" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref241"><sup>241</sup></a></p>
<p>Holloway's family, though, instead criticized the lessening of coverage of the young woman's disappearance. The saturation coverage of Holloway's disappearance by the American media was largely eclipsed in late August 2005 by <a href="Hurricane_Katrina" title="wikilink">Hurricane Katrina</a>.<a href="#fn242" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref242"><sup>242</sup></a><a href="#fn243" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref243"><sup>243</sup></a> Beth Twitty and Dave Holloway alleged that Aruba took advantage of the extensive coverage of the hurricane to release the suspects.<a href="#fn244" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref244"><sup>244</sup></a></p>
<p>Lamented Dave Holloway in his book,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hurricane Katrina had left the door open for the boys to be sent on their way with little publicity and few restrictions because it took the world's focus off of Natalee, but only for a brief time. The huge amount of publicity had waned and, during that time of quiet for us, Joran and the Kalpoe brothers were sent home. . . . All of the news shows that had followed our every move only a day before had now become fixated on the next big ratings grabber: the victims of Hurricane Katrina.<a href="#fn245" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref245"><sup>245</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, the deadline for judicial review of Joran van der Sloot's detention was set long before the hurricane.<a href="#fn246" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref246"><sup>246</sup></a></p>
