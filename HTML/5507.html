<p><strong>Kellie Loder</strong> (born 1988) is an <a href="Independent_music" title="wikilink">independent</a> <a href="singer-songwriter" class="uri" title="wikilink">singer-songwriter</a> from <a href="Newfoundland" class="uri" title="wikilink">Newfoundland</a> who plays drums, guitar and piano. She has released two <a href="Contemporary_Christian_music" title="wikilink">Contemporary Christian</a> albums: <em>The Way</em> in 2009 and <em>Imperfections &amp; Directions</em> in 2010. With a voice that <a href="St._John&#39;s,_Newfoundland_and_Labrador" title="wikilink">St. John's</a>-based newspaper <em><a href="The_Telegram" title="wikilink">The Telegram</a></em> has described as &quot;powerful yet serene and soulful&quot;, she has won critical recognition at the annual <a href="MusicNL" class="uri" title="wikilink">MusicNL</a> awards in Newfoundland, as well as the <a href="Juno_Award" title="wikilink">Juno Awards</a>, Canada's top music prizes.</p>
<p>Having written her first song at age 16 about a cousin who died in a traffic accident, Loder was <a href="Nurse_education" title="wikilink">studying nursing</a> at the <a href="Grenfell_Campus" title="wikilink">Grenfell Campus</a> of <a href="Memorial_University_of_Newfoundland" title="wikilink">Memorial University of Newfoundland</a> when she released <em>The Way</em> in August 2009. Later that year, she won a talent-search contest hosted by <a href="YC_Newfoundland" title="wikilink">YC Newfoundland</a>, a Christian youth conference. As part of the award, Loder was given time with <a href="music_industry" title="wikilink">music industry</a> and production professionals who helped her with <em>Imperfections &amp; Directions</em>, which was released at the 2010 YC Newfoundland. Loder's nursing studies hampered her ability to showcase <em>Imperfections &amp; Directions</em> by touring. Loder was nominated as Female Artist of the Year at the 2010 MusicNL awards, and then as Gospel Artist of the Year in 2011. <em>Imperfections &amp; Directions</em> was nominated as Contemporary Christian/Gospel Album of the Year at the <a href="Juno_Awards_of_2012" title="wikilink">2012 Juno Awards</a>.</p>
<p>Loder's music career is unusual in that she chose to begin it in Contemporary Christian music (CCM); most young musicians choose <a href="music_genre" title="wikilink">music genres</a> such as <a href="Country_music" title="wikilink">country</a> and <a href="pop_music" title="wikilink">pop</a>, which are generally considered more likely to bring commercial success. Loder has asserted that she chose CCM because it gives purpose to her music. In April 2012, she had not decided whether she would focus on medicine or music, but by April 2013, she had made music her focus.</p>

<ul>
<li>For Loder's age, see </ref> Kellie Loder is from <a href="Badger,_Newfoundland_and_Labrador" title="wikilink">Badger</a>, a town in the <a href="Provinces_and_territories_of_Canada" title="wikilink">Canadian province</a> of <a href="Newfoundland_and_Labrador" title="wikilink">Newfoundland and Labrador</a>.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> She considers her first introduction to music to have taken place before she was born; according to Loder, her mother frequently placed headphones on her belly while she was still in the womb. The music she listened to during this time was by <a href="Michael_W._Smith" title="wikilink">Michael W. Smith</a>.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> She claims to have &quot;natural rhythm&quot; and that she began emulating the drummer at her <a href="Pentecostalism" title="wikilink">Pentecostal</a> church by beating on a <a href="pew" class="uri" title="wikilink">pew</a> with pencils by age two.<ref>For the denomination of the Loder's church, see </li>
<li>For the origins of Loder's drumming, see </ref> At age 10, Loder was placed in her church's drumming ensemble.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> Her younger brother taught her the basics of the guitar when she was 14, teaching her three <a href="guitar_chord" title="wikilink">guitar chords</a>. She received her first guitar later that year.<ref>For the age at which Loder began playing guitar, see </li>
<li>For the age at which Loder received her first guitar, see </ref> Loder began writing songs at age 16;<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> her first song, which was about a cousin who had died in a traffic accident, used lyrics from a poem by one of their mutual friends. With encouragement from her family, Loder concentrated on her singing and songwriting and performed this in addition to another she subsequently wrote for a friend's graduation.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></li>
</ul>
<p>Loder was raised as a Christian by her parents, and considers herself to have become serious about her faith in 2007, when she &quot;started to accept [her] gifts for what they were... and just assumed it was [from] God.&quot;<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> After this experience, she began playing piano, and credited God with teaching her how to play.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> She says that, while she enjoys all the instruments she plays, she favours the piano, considering it the most beautiful.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> The first song she wrote after beginning the piano was &quot;Giants&quot;, also for a graduating class; the song uses the story of <a href="David" class="uri" title="wikilink">David</a> and <a href="Goliath" class="uri" title="wikilink">Goliath</a> as its theme, generalizing the story to apply to each individual's internal struggles.<ref>For the first song Loder wrote and the theme of that song, see </p>
