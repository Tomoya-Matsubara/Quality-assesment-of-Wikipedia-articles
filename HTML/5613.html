<p><strong>John</strong> (24 December 1166 &lt;U+2013&gt; 19 October 1216), also known as John <strong>Lackland</strong> or <strong>Softsword</strong>, was <a href="List_of_English_monarchs" title="wikilink">King of England</a> from 6 April 1199 until his death. His reign saw the loss of the <a href="duchy_of_Normandy" title="wikilink">duchy of Normandy</a> to the French king <a href="Philip_II_of_France" title="wikilink">Philip II</a> in 1204, resulting in the collapse of most of the <a href="Angevin_Empire" title="wikilink">Angevin Empire</a> and the subsequent growth in the power of the <a href="Capetian_dynasty" title="wikilink">Capetian dynasty</a> over the rest of the 13th century. The <a href="First_Barons&#39;_War" title="wikilink">baronial revolt</a> at the end of John's reign saw the signing of the <em><a href="Magna_Carta" title="wikilink">Magna Carta</a></em>, a document often considered to be an early step in the evolution of the <a href="constitution_of_the_United_Kingdom" title="wikilink">constitution of the United Kingdom</a>.</p>
<p>As the youngest of five sons of King <a href="Henry_II_of_England" title="wikilink">Henry II of England</a> and <a href="Eleanor,_Duchess_of_Aquitaine" title="wikilink">Eleanor, Duchess of Aquitaine</a>, John was at first not expected to inherit significant lands. Following the failed rebellion of his elder brothers between 1173 and 1174, however, John became Henry's favourite child. He was appointed the <a href="Lord_of_Ireland" title="wikilink">Lord of Ireland</a> in 1177 and given lands in England and the continent. John's elder brothers <a href="Henry_the_Young_King" title="wikilink">Henry</a> and <a href="Geoffrey_II,_Duke_of_Brittany" title="wikilink">Geoffrey</a> died young with the result that by the time that <a href="Richard_I_of_England" title="wikilink">Richard</a> became king in 1189, John was a potential heir to the throne. John unsuccessfully attempted a rebellion against Richard's royal administrators whilst his brother was participating in the <a href="Third_Crusade" title="wikilink">Third Crusade</a>. John was proclaimed king of England after Richard died in 1199, and came to an agreement with <a href="Philip_II_of_France" title="wikilink">Philip II of France</a> to recognise his right to the continental Angevin lands at the peace <a href="treaty_of_Le_Goulet" title="wikilink">treaty of Le Goulet</a> in 1200.</p>
<p>After war broke out again with Philip in 1202, John achieved early victories against his enemies but shortages of military resources and his treatment of <a href="Normans" title="wikilink">Norman</a>, <a href="Breton_people" title="wikilink">Breton</a> and <a href="Anjou" class="uri" title="wikilink">Anjou</a> nobles resulted in the collapse of his empire in northern France in 1204. John spent much of the next decade attempting to regain these lands, raising huge revenues, reforming his armed forces and rebuilding continental alliances. John's judicial reforms had a lasting, positive impact on the English common law system. An argument with Pope <a href="Innocent_III" title="wikilink">Innocent III</a> led to John's <a href="excommunication" class="uri" title="wikilink">excommunication</a> in 1209, a dispute finally settled by the king in 1213. John's attempt to defeat Philip in 1214 failed due to the French victory over John's allies at the <a href="battle_of_Bouvines" title="wikilink">battle of Bouvines</a>. Returning to England, John faced a rebellion from many of his barons, who were unhappy with his fiscal policies and his treatment of many of England's most powerful nobles. Although both John and barons agreed the <em>Magna Carta</em> peace treaty in 1215, neither side complied with its conditions. <a href="Civil_war" title="wikilink">Civil war</a> broke out shortly afterwards, the barons aided by <a href="Louis_VIII_of_France" title="wikilink">Prince Louis</a> of France, but soon descended into a stalemate. John died of <a href="dysentery" class="uri" title="wikilink">dysentery</a> contracted whilst on campaign in eastern England during late 1216; supporters of his son <a href="Henry_III_of_England" title="wikilink">Henry III</a> went on to achieve victory over Louis and the rebel barons during the following year.</p>
<p>Contemporary chroniclers were mostly critical of John's performance as king, and his reign has since been subject to significant debate and periodic revision by historians from the 16th century onwards. Historian <a href="Jim_Bradbury" title="wikilink">Jim Bradbury</a> has summarised the contemporary historical opinion of John's positive qualities, observing that John is today usually considered a &quot;hard-working administrator, an able man, an able general&quot;.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> Nonetheless, modern historians agree that he also had many faults as king, including what historian Ralph Turner describes as &quot;distasteful, even dangerous personality traits&quot;, such as pettiness, spitefulness and cruelty.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> These negative qualities provided extensive material for fiction writers in the <a href="Victorian_literature" title="wikilink">Victorian era</a>, and John remains a recurring character within Western popular culture, primarily as a <a href="villain" class="uri" title="wikilink">villain</a> in films and stories depicting the <a href="Robin_Hood" title="wikilink">Robin Hood</a> legends.</p>

<p>John was born to <a href="Henry_II_of_England" title="wikilink">Henry II</a> and <a href="Eleanor_of_Aquitaine" title="wikilink">Eleanor of Aquitaine</a> on 24 December 1166.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> Henry had inherited significant territories along the Atlantic seaboard &lt;U+2013&gt; <a href="Anjou" class="uri" title="wikilink">Anjou</a>, <a href="Normandy" class="uri" title="wikilink">Normandy</a> and <a href="England" class="uri" title="wikilink">England</a> - and expanded his empire by conquering <a href="Brittany" class="uri" title="wikilink">Brittany</a>.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> Henry married the powerful <a href="Eleanor_of_Aquitaine" title="wikilink">Eleanor of Aquitaine</a>, who controlled the <a href="Duchy_of_Aquitaine" title="wikilink">Duchy of Aquitaine</a> and had a tenuous claim to <a href="Toulouse" class="uri" title="wikilink">Toulouse</a> and the <a href="Auvergne_(province)" title="wikilink">Auvergne</a> in southern France.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> The result was the <a href="Angevin_Empire" title="wikilink">Angevin Empire</a>, so called because of the Count of Anjou&lt;U+2019&gt;s traditional seat in the city of <a href="Angers" class="uri" title="wikilink">Angers</a>.{{#tag:ref|The term <a href="Angevin_Empire" title="wikilink">Angevin Empire</a> originates with Victorian historian <a href="Kate_Norgate" title="wikilink">Kate Norgate</a>.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a>|group=&quot;nb&quot;}} The Angevin Empire of Henry II was inherently fragile: although all the lands owed allegiance to Henry, the disparate parts each had their own histories, traditions and governance structures.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> Indeed, as one moved south through Anjou and Aquitaine, the extent of royal power in the provinces diminished considerably, scarcely resembling the modern concept of an empire at all. Some of the traditional ties between parts of the empire, such as Normandy and England, were slowly dissolving over time.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> It was also unclear what would happen to the empire on Henry&lt;U+2019&gt;s death. Although the tradition of <a href="primogeniture" class="uri" title="wikilink">primogeniture</a>, under which an eldest son would inherit all his father's lands, was slowly growing in popularity across Europe, it was less popular amongst the Norman kings of England.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> Most believed that Henry would divide the empire, giving each son a substantial portion, with the king hoping that his children would then continue to work together as allies after his death.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> To complicate matters, much of the Angevin empire was technically owned by Henry only as a vassal of the King of France, the rival line of the <a href="House_of_Capet" title="wikilink">Capetians</a>. Henry had often allied himself with the <a href="Holy_Roman_Emperor" title="wikilink">Holy Roman Emperor</a> against France, making the feudal relationship even more challenging.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<p>Shortly after his birth, John was passed from Eleanor into the care of a <a href="wet_nurse" title="wikilink">wet nurse</a>, a traditional practice for medieval noble families.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> Eleanor then left for <a href="Poitiers" class="uri" title="wikilink">Poitiers</a>, the capital of Aquitaine, sending John and his sister <a href="Joan_of_England,_Queen_of_Sicily" title="wikilink">Joan</a> north to <a href="Fontevrault_Abbey" title="wikilink">Fontevrault Abbey</a>.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> This may have been done with the aim of steering John, as her youngest son without an obvious inheritance, towards a future ecclesiastical career.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> Eleanor spent the next few years conspiring against her husband Henry and neither parent played a part in John&lt;U+2019&gt;s very early life.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> John was probably, like his brothers, assigned a <em>magister</em> whilst he was at Fontevrault, a teacher charged with both his early education and managing the servants of his immediate household; John was also later taught by Ranulph Glanville, a leading English administrator.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> John also spent some time as a member of his brother <a href="Henry_the_Young_King" title="wikilink">Henry the Young King</a>'s household, probably receiving instruction in hunting and military skills.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
<p>John would grow up to be around 5 ft 5 in high (1.62 m), relatively short for royalty of the day, with a &quot;powerful, barrel-chested body&quot; and dark red hair; he appeared to contemporaries to look like an inhabitant of <a href="Poitou" class="uri" title="wikilink">Poitou</a>.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> John enjoyed reading and was unusual for the period in building up a travelling library of books.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> He enjoyed gambling, in particular <a href="backgammon" class="uri" title="wikilink">backgammon</a>, and was an enthusiastic <a href="hunting" title="wikilink">hunter</a> even by medieval standards.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> He liked music, although not songs.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> John would also become a &quot;connoisseur of jewels&quot;, building up a large collection, and become famous for his taste in rich clothes; French chroniclers, however, believed that John had a rather poor taste in <a href="wine" title="wikilink">wines</a>.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> As John grew up, he became known for being potentially &quot;genial, witty, generous and hospitable&quot;; at other moments, he could be jealous, over-sensitive and prone to fits of rage, &quot;biting and gnawing his fingers&quot; in anger.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> {{#tag:ref|<a href="Henry_II_of_England" title="wikilink">Henry II</a> also bit and gnawed his fingers; extreme rage is considered by many historians to be a trait of the Angevin kings.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a>|group=&quot;nb&quot;}}</p>

<p><img src="Eleonora_Jindra2.jpg" title="fig:John&#39;s parents, Henry II and Eleanor, holding court" alt="John&#39;s parents, Henry II and Eleanor, holding court" /> During John's early years, Henry attempted to resolve the question of his succession. Henry&lt;U+2019&gt;s eldest son, Henry, had been crowned King of England in 1170, but without being given any formal powers by his father, and was also promised Normandy and Anjou as part of his future inheritance; <a href="Richard_I_of_England" title="wikilink">Richard</a> was in due course to be appointed the Count of Poitou and be given control of Aquitaine, whilst <a href="Geoffrey_II,_Duke_of_Brittany" title="wikilink">Geoffrey</a> was to become the Duke of Brittany.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> At this time it seemed unlikely that John would ever inherit substantial lands and John was jokingly nicknamed &quot;Lackland&quot; by his father.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a></p>
<p>Henry II wanted to secure the southern borders of Aquitaine and decided to betroth his youngest son to Alais, the daughter and heiress of <a href="Humbert_III_of_Savoy" title="wikilink">Humbert III of Savoy</a>.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> As part of this agreement John was promised the future inheritance of <a href="Savoy" class="uri" title="wikilink">Savoy</a>, <a href="Piedmont" title="wikilink">Piemonte</a>, <a href="Maurienne" class="uri" title="wikilink">Maurienne</a>, and the other possessions of Count Humbert.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> For his part in the potential marriage alliance, Henry II transferred the castles of <a href="Ch&lt;U+00E2&gt;teau_de_Chinon" title="wikilink">Chinon</a>, <a href="Loudun" class="uri" title="wikilink">Loudun</a> and <a href="Mirebeau" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mirebeau</a> into John&lt;U+2019&gt;s name, although as John was only five years old his father would continue to control them for practical purposes.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> Henry the Young King was unimpressed by this, since although he had yet to be granted control of any castles in his new kingdom, these were still effectively his future property and had been given away without consultation.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> Alais made the trip over the Alps and joined Henry II's court, but she died before being actually marrying John, leaving the prince once again without an inheritance.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1173 John&lt;U+2019&gt;s elder brothers, backed by Eleanor, rose in revolt against Henry in the short-lived rebellion of 1173 to 1174. Henry the Young King had grown irritated with his subordinate position to Henry II and increasingly worried that John might be given additional lands and castles at his expense.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> As a result of this, Henry the Young King travelled to <a href="Paris" class="uri" title="wikilink">Paris</a> and allied himself with <a href="Louis_VII_of_France" title="wikilink">Louis VII</a>.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> Eleanor, irritated by her husband's persistent interference in Aquitaine, encouraged Richard and Geoffrey to join her eldest son in Paris.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> Henry II triumphed over the coalition of his sons, but was generous to them in the peace settlement agreed at <a href="Montlouis-sur-Loire" title="wikilink">Montlouis</a>.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> Henry the Young King was allowed to travel widely in Europe with his own household of knights; Richard was given Aquitaine back; Geoffrey was allowed to return to Brittany: only Eleanor was imprisoned for her role in the revolt.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a></p>
<p>John had spent the conflict travelling alongside his father and was given widespread possessions across the Angevin empire as part of the Montlouis settlement; from then onwards, most observers regarded John as Henry II&lt;U+2019&gt;s favourite child, although still the furthest removed in terms of the royal succession.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> Henry II began to find more lands for John, mostly at various nobles' expense. In 1175 he rather questionably appropriated the estates of the late Earl of Cornwall and gave them to John.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> The following year, Henry disinherited the sisters of <a href="Isabel,_Countess_of_Gloucester" title="wikilink">Isabelle of Gloucester</a> and betrothed John to the - now extremely wealthy - Isabelle, again contrary to legal custom.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> In 1177, at the Council of Oxford, Henry dismissed <a href="William_FitzAldelm" title="wikilink">William FitzAldelm</a> as the <a href="Lordship_of_Ireland" title="wikilink">Lord of Ireland</a> and replaced him with the ten year old John instead.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a></p>

<p>In 1185 John made his <a href="John&#39;s_first_expedition_to_Ireland" title="wikilink">first visit to Ireland</a>, accompanied by three hundred knights, as well as a team of administrators.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a> Henry had tried to have John officially proclaimed King of Ireland, but <a href="Pope_Lucius_III" title="wikilink">Pope Lucius III</a> would not agree.<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a> John's first period of rule in Ireland was not a success. Ireland at the time had only recently been conquered by Anglo-Norman forces, and tensions were still rife between Henry II, the new settlers and the existing inhabitants.<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a> John infamously offended the local Irish lords by making fun of their unfashionable long beards, failed to make allies amongst the Anglo-Norman settlers, began to lose ground militarily against the Irish and finally returned to England later in the year, blaming the viceroy, <a href="Hugh_de_Lacy,_Lord_of_Meath" title="wikilink">Hugh de Lacy</a>, for the fiasco.<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a></p>
<p>The problems amongst John's wider family continued to grow. His elder brother Geoffrey died during a tournament in 1186, leaving only a young son, Arthur.<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a> This meant that John could not be granted the duchy of Brittany, which would need to be given to Arthur, but did bring John slightly closer to the throne of England.<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a> The uncertainty about what would happen after Henry's death continued to grow; Richard was keen to join a new <a href="crusade" class="uri" title="wikilink">crusade</a> and remained concerned that whilst he was away Henry would appoint John his formal successor.<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a> Richard began discussions about a potential alliance with Philip II in Paris during 1187, and the next year Richard gave homage to Philip in exchange for support for a war against Henry.<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a> Richard and Philip fought a joint campaign against Henry, and by the summer of 1189 the king made peace, promising Richard the succession.<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a> John initially remained loyal to his father, but changed sides once it appeared that Richard would win.<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a> Henry died shortly afterwards.<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a></p>

In order to remarry, John first needed to abandon <a href="Isabel,_Countess_of_Gloucester" title="wikilink">Isabel, Countess of Gloucester</a>, his first wife; John accomplished this by arguing that he had failed to get the necessary papal permission to marry Isabel in the first place &lt;U+2013&gt; as a cousin, John could not have legally wed her without this.<a href="#fn105" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref105"><sup>105</sup></a> it remains unclear why John chose to marry Isabella of Angoul&lt;U+00EA&gt;me.

<p>Unfortunately, Isabella had already been engaged to be married to <a href="Hugh_X_of_Lusignan" title="wikilink">Hugh de Lusignan</a>, an important member of a key Poitou noble family and also the brother of <a href="Raoul_I_of_Lusignan" title="wikilink">Raoul de Lusignan</a>, the <a href="Counts_of_Eu" title="wikilink">Count of Eu</a> with lands along the sensitive eastern Normandy border with Philip.<a href="#fn108" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref108"><sup>108</sup></a> Just as John stood to benefit strategically from marrying Isabella, so the marriage threatened the interests of the <a href="Lusignan_dynasty" title="wikilink">Lusignans</a> whose own lands currently provided the key route for royal goods and troops across Aquitaine.<a href="#fn109" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref109"><sup>109</sup></a> Rather than negotiating some form of compensation, John treated Hugh &lt;U+201C&gt;with contempt&lt;U+201D&gt;, resulting in a Lusignan uprising that was promptly crushed by John, who also intervened to surpress Raoul in Normandy.<a href="#fn110" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref110"><sup>110</sup></a></p>
<p>Although John was the Count of Poitou, and therefore the rightful feudal lord over the Lusignans, they could legitimately appeal to John&lt;U+2019&gt;s own feudal lord, Philip, in respect to decisions John took within his French lands.<a href="#fn111" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref111"><sup>111</sup></a> Hugh did exactly this in 1201 and Philip summoned John to attend court in Paris in 1202, citing the Le Goulet treaty to strengthen his case.<a href="#fn112" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref112"><sup>112</sup></a> John was unwilling to weaken his authority in western France in this way and argued that he need not attend Philip&lt;U+2019&gt;s court because of his special status as the Duke of Normandy, who was exempt by feudal tradition from being called to the French court.<a href="#fn113" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref113"><sup>113</sup></a> Philip argued instead that he was summoning John not as the Duke of Normandy, but as the Count of Poitou, which carried no such special status.<a href="#fn114" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref114"><sup>114</sup></a> When John still refused to come, Philip declared John in breach of his feudal responsibilities, reassigned all of John&lt;U+2019&gt;s lands that fell under the French crown to Arthur - with the exception of Normandy which he took back for himself - and began a fresh war against John.<a href="#fn115" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref115"><sup>115</sup></a></p>

<p>John inherited a sophisticated system of administration in England, with a range of royal agents answering to the Royal Household; the Chancery, keeping written records and communications; the Treasury and the Exchequer, dealing with income and expenditure respectively, and the various judges deployed to deliver justice around the kingdom.<a href="#fn155" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref155"><sup>155</sup></a> Like previous kings, John managed a peripatetic court that travelled around the kingdom, dealing with both local and national matters as he went.<a href="#fn156" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref156"><sup>156</sup></a> John was very active in the administration of England, becoming involved in every aspect of government.<a href="#fn157" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref157"><sup>157</sup></a> In part he was following in the same tradition as Henry II and Henry I, but by the 13th century the volume of administrative work had greatly increased, putting much more pressure on a king who wished to rule in this style.<a href="#fn158" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref158"><sup>158</sup></a> Furthermore, John was in England for much longer periods than his predecessors, making his rule more personal than had been the case before, particularly in hitherto ignored areas such as the north.<a href="#fn159" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref159"><sup>159</sup></a></p>
<p>The administration of justice was of particular importance to John. Several new processes had been introduced to English law under Henry II, including <em>novel disseisin</em> and <em>mort d'ancestor</em>.<a href="#fn160" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref160"><sup>160</sup></a> These gave a significant role to the royal courts to intervene in local law cases, previously dealt with only by regional or local lords.<a href="#fn161" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref161"><sup>161</sup></a> John also increased the skills and independence of local sergeants, bailiffs and created local coronors.<a href="#fn162" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref162"><sup>162</sup></a> John worked extremely hard to ensure that this system operated well, through judges he had appointed, fostering legal specialists and expertise, and by intervening in cases himself.<a href="#fn163" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref163"><sup>163</sup></a> John continued to try relatively minor cases even during military crises.<a href="#fn164" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref164"><sup>164</sup></a> Viewed positively, John discharged &quot;his royal duty of providing justice... with a zeal and a tirelessness to which the English common law is greatly endebted&quot;.<a href="#fn165" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref165"><sup>165</sup></a> Seen more critically, John may have been motivated by the potential of the royal legal process to raise fees, rather than a desire to deliver simple justice; John's legal system also only applied to free men, rather than to all of the population.<a href="#fn166" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref166"><sup>166</sup></a> Nonetheless, these changes were popular with many free tenants, who acquired a more reliable legal system that could by-pass the barons against whom such cases were often brought.<a href="#fn167" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref167"><sup>167</sup></a> John's reforms were less popular with the barons themselves, especially as they remained subject to arbitrary and frequently vindictive royal justice themselves.<a href="#fn168" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref168"><sup>168</sup></a></p>

Revenue from the royal demesne was inflexible and had been diminishing slowly since the <a href="Norman_conquest_of_England" title="wikilink">conquest</a>, not helped by Richard's sale of many royal properties in 1189, and taxation played a much smaller role in royal income than in later centuries. An English king had widespread feudal rights which could be used to generate income, however, including the <a href="scutage" class="uri" title="wikilink">scutage</a> system, in which feudal military service was transmuted to a cash payment to the king, fines, court fees and selling charters and other privileges.<a href="#fn170" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref170"><sup>170</sup></a> John intensified his efforts to maximise all possible sources of income, to the extent that he has been described as &quot;avaricious, miserly, extortionate and moneyminded&quot;.<a href="#fn171" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref171"><sup>171</sup></a> John also used revenue generation as a way of exerting political control over the barons: debts owed to the crown might be forgiven to the king's favoured supporters, or stringently enforces against his enemies.</p>

<p><img src="Penny_john.jpg" title="fig:A silver King John penny, amongst the first to be struck in Dublin" alt="A silver King John penny, amongst the first to be struck in Dublin" /> At the start of John's reign there was a <a href="Economy_of_England_in_the_Middle_Ages#Development_of_estate_management" title="wikilink">sudden change in prices</a>, as bad harvests and high demand for food resulted in much higher prices for grain and animals.

<p><img src="King_John_from_De_Rege_Johanne.jpg" title="fig:John on a stag hunt" alt="John on a stag hunt" width="225" /> John's royal household was based around several groups of followers. One element of these were the <em>familiares regis</em>, John's immediate friends and knights who travelled around the country with the king, also playing an important part in organising and leading military campaigns.<a href="#fn189" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref189"><sup>189</sup></a> Another section of royal followers were the <em>curia regis</em>; these <em>curiales</em> were the senior officials and agents of the king, essential to his day to day rule.<a href="#fn190" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref190"><sup>190</sup></a> Being a member of these inner circles brought huge advantages, as it was easier to gain favours from the king, apply law suits, marry a wealthy heiress or have one's debts remitted.<a href="#fn191" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref191"><sup>191</sup></a> There had been a trend since Henry II for these posts to be filled by &quot;new men&quot; from outside the normal ranks of the barons. This intensified under John's rule, with many lesser nobles, frequently mercenary leaders from Poitou, arriving from the continent to take up positions in his court.<a href="#fn192" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref192"><sup>192</sup></a> These men included many soldiers whose behaviour would become infamous in England, including <a href="Falkes_de_Breaut&lt;U+00E9&gt;" title="wikilink">Falkes de Breaut&lt;U+00E9&gt;</a>, Geard d'Athies, Engelard de Cigong&lt;U+00E9&gt; and <a href="Philip_Marc" title="wikilink">Philip Marc</a>.<a href="#fn193" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref193"><sup>193</sup></a> The result was many barons perceived the king's household as a &quot;narrow clique enjoying royal favour at barons' expense&quot;, staffed by men of lesser status than their own.<a href="#fn194" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref194"><sup>194</sup></a></p>
<p>This trend for the king to rely on his own men at the expense of the barons was exacerbated by the tradition of Angevin royal <em>ira et malevolentia</em> - &quot;anger and ill-will&quot; - and John's own personality.<a href="#fn195" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref195"><sup>195</sup></a> From Henry II onwards, <em>ira et malevolentia</em> had come to describe the right of the king to express his anger and displeasure at particular barons or clergy, building on the Norman concept of <em>malevoncia</em> - royal ill-will.<a href="#fn196" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref196"><sup>196</sup></a> In the Norman period, suffering the king's ill-will had resulted in difficulties in obtaining grants, honours or petitions; Henry II had infamously expressed his fury and ill-will towards Thomas Becket, ultimately resulting in Becket's death.<a href="#fn197" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref197"><sup>197</sup></a> John, however, now had the ability to &quot;cripple his vassals&quot; on a significant scale using his new economic and judicial measures, making the threat of royal anger all the more serious.<a href="#fn198" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref198"><sup>198</sup></a></p>
<p>John was deeply suspicious of the barons, particularly those with sufficient power and wealth to potentially challenge the king.<a href="#fn199" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref199"><sup>199</sup></a> Numerous barons were subjected to John's <em>malevolentia</em>, even including <a href="William_Marshal,_1st_Earl_of_Pembroke" title="wikilink">William Marshal</a>, a famous knight and baron normally held up as a model of utter loyalty.<a href="#fn200" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref200"><sup>200</sup></a> The most infamous case, which went beyond anything considered acceptable at the time, proved to be that <a href="William_de_Braose,_4th_Lord_of_Bramber" title="wikilink">William de Briouze</a>, a power <a href="Welsh_Marches" title="wikilink">Marcher lord</a> with lands in Ireland.<a href="#fn201" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref201"><sup>201</sup></a> De Briouze was subjected to punitive demands for money and when he refused to pay a huge sum of 40,000 <a href="Mark_(money)" title="wikilink">marks</a> (equivalent to &lt;U+00A3&gt;26,666 at the time),<a href="#fn202" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref202"><sup>202</sup></a> his wife and one of his sons were imprisoned by John, resulting in their death.<a href="#fn203" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref203"><sup>203</sup></a> De Briouze himself died in exile in 1211, with his grandsons remaining in prison until 1218.<a href="#fn204" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref204"><sup>204</sup></a> John's suspicions and jealousies meant that he rarely enjoyed good relationships with even the leading loyalist barons.<a href="#fn205" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref205"><sup>205</sup></a></p>

This is conventionally interpreted as implying that she was having an affair with the king but in this case wished to have conjugal sex with her husband instead - thus the humorous fine.

<p>John's lack of religious conviction has been noted both by contemporary chroniclers and later historians, with some suspecting that John was at best impious, or even <a href="Atheism" title="wikilink">atheistic</a>, a very serious issue at the time.<a href="#fn219" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref219"><sup>219</sup></a> Contemporary chroniclers catalogued his various anti-religious habits at length, including his failure to take communion; his blasphemous remarks; his witty but scandalous jokes about church doctrine, including the king's jokes about the implausibility of <a href="Resurrection_of_Jesus" title="wikilink">the Resurrection</a>; and commented on the paucity of John&lt;U+2019&gt;s charitable donations to the church.<a href="#fn220" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref220"><sup>220</sup></a> Historian Frank McLynn argues that John&lt;U+2019&gt;s early years at Fontevrault, combined with his own relatively advanced education, may have combined to turn him against the church.<a href="#fn221" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref221"><sup>221</sup></a> Other historians have been more cautious in interpreting this material, noting that chroniclers also reported John&lt;U+2019&gt;s personal interest in the life of <a href="Wulfstan_(Bishop_of_Worcester)" title="wikilink">St Wulfstan of Worcester</a> and his friendships with several senior clerics, most especially with <a href="Hugh_of_Lincoln" title="wikilink">Hugh of Lincoln</a>, later declared a saint.<a href="#fn222" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref222"><sup>222</sup></a> Financial records show a normal royal household, engaged in the usual feasts and pious observances - albeit with many records showing John's offerings to the poor to atone for routinely breaking church rules and guidance.<a href="#fn223" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref223"><sup>223</sup></a></p>

The Norman and Angevin kings had traditionally exercised a great deal of power and autonomy over the church within their territories. From the 1040s onwards, however, successive popes had put forward a reforming message, emphasising the importance of the church being &quot;governed more coherently and more hierarchically from the centre&quot; and establishing &quot;its own sphere of authority and jurisdiction, separate from and independent of that of the lay ruler&quot;.<a href="#fn274" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref274"><sup>274</sup></a> After the 1140s, these principles had been largely accepted within the English church, albeit with an element of concern about centralising authority of Rome.<a href="#fn275" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref275"><sup>275</sup></a> This began to bring the customary rights of lay rulers such as John over ecclesiastical appointments into question.<a href="#fn276" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref276"><sup>276</sup></a> Pope Innocent himself was an &quot;ambitious and aggressive&quot; religious leader, insistent on his rights and responsibilities within the church.<a href="#fn277" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref277"><sup>277</sup></a></p>

Revisionist histories written by <a href="John_Foxe" title="wikilink">John Foxe</a>, <a href="William_Tyndale" title="wikilink">William Tyndale</a> and <a href="Robert_Barnes_(martyr)" title="wikilink">Robert Barnes</a> portrayed John as an early Protestant hero, and <a href="John_Foxe" title="wikilink">John Foxe</a> included the king in his <em><a href="Foxe&#39;s_Book_of_Martyrs" title="wikilink">Book of Martyrs</a></em>.<a href="#fn391" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref391"><sup>391</sup></a> <a href="John_Speed" title="wikilink">John Speed</a>'s <em>Historie of Great Britaine</em> in 1632 praised John's &quot;great renown&quot; as a king, blaming the bias of medieval chroniclers for the king's poor reputation.<a href="#fn392" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref392"><sup>392</sup></a></p>
<p><img src="Foxe&#39;s_Book_of_Martyrs_title_page.jpg" title="fig:John Foxe&#39;s Book of Martyrs, officially titled Acts and Monuments, which took a positive view of John&#39;s reign" alt="John Foxe&#39;s Book of Martyrs, officially titled Acts and Monuments, which took a positive view of John&#39;s reign" width="180" /> By the Victorian period, however, historians were more inclined to draw on the judgements of the chroniclers and to focus on John's moral personality. <a href="Kate_Norgate" title="wikilink">Kate Norgate</a>, for example, argued that John's downfall had been due not to his failure in war or strategy, but due to his &quot;almost superhuman wickedness&quot;, whilst James Ramsay blamed both John's family background and his cruel personality for his downfall.<a href="#fn393" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref393"><sup>393</sup></a> Historians in the &quot;<a href="Whig_history" title="wikilink">Whiggish</a>&quot; tradition, focused on documents such as the <a href="Domesday_Book" title="wikilink">Domesday Book</a> and the <em><a href="Magna_Carta" title="wikilink">Magna Carta</a></em>, tracing a progressive and <a href="Universalism" title="wikilink">universalist</a> course of political and economic development in England over the medieval period.<a href="#fn394" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref394"><sup>394</sup></a> These historians were often inclined to see John's reign, and his signing of the <em>Magna Carta</em> in particular, as marking a positive step in the constitutional development of England, despite the flaws of the king himself.<a href="#fn395" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref395"><sup>395</sup></a> <a href="Winston_Churchill" title="wikilink">Winston Churchill</a>, for example, argued that &quot;[w]hen the long tally is added, it will be seen that the British nation and the English-speaking world owe far more to the vices of John than to the labours of virtuous sovereigns&quot;.<a href="#fn396" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref396"><sup>396</sup></a></p>
<p>In the 1940s, new interpretations of John's reign began to emerge, based on research into the record evidence of his reign, such as <a href="pipe_roll" title="wikilink">pipe rolls</a>, charters, court documents and similar primary records. This was epitomised by an essay by <a href="Vivian_Hunter_Galbraith" title="wikilink">Vivian Galbraith</a> in 1945, proposing a &quot;new approach&quot; to understanding the ruler.<a href="#fn397" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref397"><sup>397</sup></a> The increased use of record evidence was combined with an increased scepticism about two of the most colourful chroniclers of John's reign, Roger of Wendover and Matthew Paris.<a href="#fn398" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref398"><sup>398</sup></a> In many cases the detail provided by these chroniclers, both writing after John's death, was challenged by modern historians.<a href="#fn399" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref399"><sup>399</sup></a> Interpretations of the <em>Magna Carta</em> and the role of the rebel barons in 1215 have been significantly revised: although the charter's symbolic, constitutional value for later generations is unquestionable, in the context of John's reign most historians now consider it a failed peace agreement between &quot;partisan&quot; factions.<a href="#fn400" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref400"><sup>400</sup></a> There has also been increasing debate about the nature of John's Irish policies. Specialists in Irish medieval history, such as Sean Duffy, have challenged the conventional narrative established by <a href="W._L._Warren" title="wikilink">Lewis Warren</a>, suggesting that Ireland was less stable by 1216 than was previously supposed.<a href="#fn401" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref401"><sup>401</sup></a></p>
<p>Most historians today, including John's recent biographers Ralph Turner and Lewis Warren, argue that John was an unsuccessful monarch, but that his failings were exaggerated by 12th and 13th-century chroniclers.<a href="#fn402" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref402"><sup>402</sup></a> <a href="Jim_Bradbury" title="wikilink">Jim Bradbury</a> notes the consensus of contemporary historians that John was a &quot;hard-working administrator, an able man, an able general&quot;, albeit it, as Turner suggests, with &quot;distasteful, even dangerous personality traits&quot;, including pettiness, spitefulness and cruelty.<a href="#fn403" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref403"><sup>403</sup></a> <a href="John_Gillingham" title="wikilink">John Gillingham</a>, author of a major biography of Richard I, follows this line too, although he considers John a less effective general than do Turner or Warren; Bradbury, again takes a moderate line, but suggests that in recent years modern historians have been overly lenient towards John's numerous faults.<a href="#fn404" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref404"><sup>404</sup></a> Popular historian <a href="Frank_McLynn" title="wikilink">Frank McLynn</a> maintains a counter-revisionist perspective on John, however, arguing that the king's modern reputation amongst historians is &quot;bizarre&quot;, and that as a monarch John &quot;fails almost all those [tests] that can be legitimately set&quot;.<a href="#fn405" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref405"><sup>405</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="popular-representations">Popular representations</h3>

<p><img src="FirstFolioKingJohn.jpg" title="fig:Shakespeare&#39;s play The Life and Death of King John" alt="Shakespeare&#39;s play The Life and Death of King John" /> Popular representations of John first began to emerge during the Tudor period, mirroring the revisionist histories of the time.<a href="#fn406" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref406"><sup>406</sup></a> The anonymous play <em><a href="The_Troublesome_Reign_of_King_John" title="wikilink">The Troublesome Reign of King John</a></em> portrayed the king as a &quot;proto-Protestant martyr&quot;, similar to that shown in John Bale's morality play <em><a href="John_Bale#Kynge_Johan" title="wikilink">Kynge Johan</a></em>, in which John attempts to save England from the &quot;evil agents of the Roman Church&quot;.<a href="#fn407" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref407"><sup>407</sup></a> By contrast, Shakespeare's play <em><a href="The_Life_and_Death_of_King_John" title="wikilink">King John</a></em>, whilst drawing on <em>The Troublesome Reign</em> for its source material and still relatively anti-Catholic, offers a more &quot;balanced, dual view of a complex monarch as both a proto-Protestant victim of Rome's machinations and as a weak, selfishly motivated ruler&quot;.<a href="#fn408" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref408"><sup>408</sup></a> <a href="Anthony_Munday" title="wikilink">Anthony Munday</a>'s play <em><a href="The_Downfall_and_The_Death_of_Robert_Earl_of_Huntington" title="wikilink">The Downfall and The Death of Robert Earl of Huntington</a></em> similarly portrays many of John's negative traits, but fundamentally adopts a positive interpretation of the king's stand against the Roman Catholic church, in line with the contemporary views of the Tudor monarchs.<a href="#fn409" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref409"><sup>409</sup></a> By the middle of the 17th century, however, plays such as <a href="Robert_Davenport" title="wikilink">Robert Davenport</a>'s <em><a href="King_John_and_Matilda" title="wikilink">King John and Matilda</a></em>, although based largely on the earlier Elizabethan works, were transferring the role of Protestant champion to the barons and focusing more on the tyrannical aspects of John's behaviour.<a href="#fn410" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref410"><sup>410</sup></a></p>
<p>19th-century fictional depictions of John were heavily influenced by Sir <a href="Walter_Scott" title="wikilink">Walter Scott</a>'s historical romance, <em><a href="Ivanhoe" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ivanhoe</a></em>, which presented &quot;an almost totally unfavourable picture&quot; of the king, drawing both on Victorian histories of the period and on Shakespeare's play.<a href="#fn411" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref411"><sup>411</sup></a> Scott's work influenced the late 19th-century children's writer <a href="Howard_Pyle" title="wikilink">Howard Pyle</a>'s book <em><a href="The_Merry_Adventures_of_Robin_Hood" title="wikilink">The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood</a></em>, which in turn established John as the principal villain within the traditional <a href="Robin_Hood" title="wikilink">Robin Hood</a> narrative set, during the Third Crusade of the early 1190s.<a href="#fn412" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref412"><sup>412</sup></a> During the 20th century, John was normally depicted in fictional books and films alongside Robin Hood. <a href="Sam_De_Grasse" title="wikilink">Sam De Grasse</a>'s role as John in the black and white <a href="Robin_Hood_(1922_film)" title="wikilink">1922 film version</a> shows John committing numerous atrocities and acts of torture.<a href="#fn413" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref413"><sup>413</sup></a> <a href="Claude_Rains" title="wikilink">Claude Rains</a> played John in the <a href="The_Adventures_of_Robin_Hood_(film)" title="wikilink">1938 colour version</a> alongside <a href="Errol_Flynn" title="wikilink">Errol Flynn</a>, starting a trend for films to depict John as an &quot;effeminate... arrogant and cowardly stay-at-home&quot;.<a href="#fn414" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref414"><sup>414</sup></a> The character of John acts either to highlight the virtues of King Richard, or contrasts with the <a href="Sheriff_of_Nottingham" title="wikilink">Sheriff of Nottingham</a>, who is usually the &quot;swashbuckling villain&quot; to Robin.<a href="#fn415" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref415"><sup>415</sup></a> An extreme version of this trend can be seen in the Disney cartoon version, for example, which depicts John, voiced by <a href="Peter_Ustinov" title="wikilink">Peter Ustinov</a>, as a &quot;cowardly, thumbsucking lion&quot;.<a href="#fn416" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref416"><sup>416</sup></a> Popular works that depict John beyond the Robin Hood legends, such as <a href="James_Goldman" title="wikilink">James Goldman</a>'s play and later film, <em>The Lion in Winter</em>, set in 1183, still commonly present him as an &quot;effete weakling&quot;, in this instance contrasted with the more masculine <a href="Henry_II_of_England" title="wikilink">Henry II</a>.<a href="#fn417" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref417"><sup>417</sup></a></p>
