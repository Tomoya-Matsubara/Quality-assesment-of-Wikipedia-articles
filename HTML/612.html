<p><strong>Garnet Francis Malley</strong>, <a href="Military_Cross" title="wikilink">MC</a>, <a href="Air_Force_Cross_(United_Kingdom)" title="wikilink">AFC</a> (2 November 1892 &lt;U+2013&gt; 20 May 1961) was an Australian <a href="flying_ace" title="wikilink">fighter ace</a> of World War I, credited with six aerial victories. He was an aviation adviser to <a href="Chiang_Kai-shek" title="wikilink">Chiang Kai-shek</a>'s government in China during the 1930s, and an intelligence officer in World War II.</p>
<p>Born and educated in <a href="New_South_Wales" title="wikilink">New South Wales</a>, Malley first saw service in World War I as an artilleryman with the <a href="First_Australian_Imperial_Force" title="wikilink">Australian Imperial Force</a>. He transferred to the <a href="Australian_Flying_Corps" title="wikilink">Australian Flying Corps</a> in 1917, and the following year flew <a href="Sopwith_Camel" title="wikilink">Sopwith Camels</a> with <a href="No._4_Squadron_RAAF" title="wikilink">No. 4 Squadron</a> on the <a href="Western_Front_(World_War_I)" title="wikilink">Western Front</a>. Malley was awarded the <a href="Military_Cross" title="wikilink">Military Cross</a> for his achievements in combat, and his subsequent work as a flying instructor in England earned him the <a href="Air_Force_Cross_(United_Kingdom)" title="wikilink">Air Force Cross</a>. After a spell in civilian life following the war, he joined the <a href="Royal_Australian_Air_Force" title="wikilink">Royal Australian Air Force</a> (RAAF) in 1925, serving with <a href="No._3_Squadron_RAAF" title="wikilink">No. 3 Squadron</a>. He became an aviation adviser to China in 1931, and worked closely with <a href="Soong_May-ling" title="wikilink">Madame Chiang Kai-shek</a> from 1937. Malley was able to observe air tactics in the <a href="Second_Sino-Japanese_War" title="wikilink">Sino-Japanese War</a> at first hand, though his reports were given little weight in Australia. Returning home in 1940, he served in intelligence roles with the RAAF and later the Commonwealth government. After the war he bought a plantation in Fiji, where he died in 1961.</p>

He was discharged from the AIF on 4 October, and rejoined the family firm as warehouse manager in 1921. On 25 January 1922, he married Phyllis Kathleen Dare in Mosman.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> The union would produce one son, Maldon.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> Malley was acknowledged as both a source and a reviewer by F.M.

<p>On 19 June 1925, Malley was commissioned as a <a href="flight_lieutenant" title="wikilink">flight lieutenant</a> in the part-time Citizen Air Force, serving as a pilot with <a href="No._3_Squadron_RAAF" title="wikilink">No. 3 Squadron</a>, which operated <a href="Airco_DH.9" title="wikilink">Airco DH.9s</a> and <a href="Royal_Aircraft_Factory_S.E.5" title="wikilink">Royal Aircraft Factory S.E.5s</a>.

<p>By 1931, ANA was in financial difficulties and Malley travelled to China to take up a position as an aviation adviser to the Chinese government in <a href="Guangdong" title="wikilink">Kwangtung</a>.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> On 1 February 1937, through the influence of the British <a href="Foreign_and_Commonwealth_Office" title="wikilink">Foreign Office</a>, Malley's status was bolstered by his appointment as an honorary <a href="Wing_Commander_(rank)" title="wikilink">wing commander</a> in the RAAF Reserve. He was by this time serving as adviser to <a href="Soong_May-ling" title="wikilink">Madame Chiang Kai-shek</a> in her capacity as secretary-general of the aeronautical commission that directed China's air force; Madame Chiang extended to Malley her &quot;warmest congratulations&quot; for his &quot;well deserved&quot; promotion.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> One of the tasks she assigned him was investigating corrupt procurement practices in the air force.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> Malley's stay increasingly involved him in the <a href="Second_Sino-Japanese_War" title="wikilink">fighting in China</a>; his wife would relate three years of night-time air raids to her friends upon the couple's return to Australia in 1940.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> Some members of the RAAF, however, including the <a href="Chief_of_Air_Force_(Australia)" title="wikilink">Chief of the Air Staff</a>, Air Vice-Marshal <a href="Richard_Williams_(RAAF_officer)" title="wikilink">Richard Williams</a>, may have perceived Malley as exaggerating the importance of his role with the Chinese, particularly given his apparent delight in its ceremonial aspects. At any rate, his reports of Japanese air tactics during 1938, and the value his observations might have held for Australia in the event of war in the Pacific, were largely discounted by his home government.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a><a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a></p>

<p>Malley was recalled to Australia in July 1940.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> He rejoined the RAAF as a squadron leader in October, and took up the position of Deputy Director of the Combined Operational Intelligence Centre (COIC).<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a> Drawing on his knowledge of Japanese raids on Chinese airfields in the 1930s, Malley visited several RAAF stations in northern Australia to advise on protective measures; it became evident in the wake of the <a href="Bombing_of_Darwin" title="wikilink">attack on Darwin</a> in February 1942 that none of his recommendations had been implemented.<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a><a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a> He was promoted to honorary wing commander in October 1941, and two months later succeeded <a href="Rupert_Long" title="wikilink">Rupert Long</a> as Director of COIC.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a> Malley was raised to acting <a href="group_captain" title="wikilink">group captain</a> on 1 July 1942, but ill health forced him to relinquish his post on 3 October.<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a><a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a> He was discharged from the Air Force as medically unfit on 9 June 1943.<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a><a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a> General <a href="Douglas_MacArthur" title="wikilink">Douglas MacArthur</a> praised Malley for his &quot;foresight, planning, and organizational ability&quot;.<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a> He went on to work as officer-in-charge of the Chinese section at the Commonwealth Security Service in <a href="Canberra" class="uri" title="wikilink">Canberra</a> from January 1944 to March 1947 as an honorary group captain.<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a><a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a></p>

<p>In 1948, Malley's war service was recognised by the United States with the award of the <a href="Legion_of_Merit" title="wikilink">Legion of Merit</a>. By 1949, he had procured a yacht, the <em>Royal Flight</em>, which was used as a setting in the film <em><a href="The_Blue_Lagoon_(1949_film)" title="wikilink">The Blue Lagoon</a></em>.<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a> The following year, the family bought a coconut plantation on <a href="Vanua_Balavu" title="wikilink">Vanua Balavu</a>, Fiji.<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a> In September 1951, Malley and his wife toured the world, visiting <a href="Algiers" class="uri" title="wikilink">Algiers</a>, <a href="Guadaloupe" class="uri" title="wikilink">Guadaloupe</a>, <a href="Cura&lt;U+00E7&gt;ao" class="uri" title="wikilink">Cura&lt;U+00E7&gt;ao</a>, <a href="Martinique" class="uri" title="wikilink">Martinique</a>, and <a href="Tahiti" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tahiti</a>.<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a> They subsequently returned to live on their Fijian plantation, and rode out the <a href="1953_Suva_earthquake" title="wikilink">1953 Suva earthquake and tidal wave</a>.<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a></p>
