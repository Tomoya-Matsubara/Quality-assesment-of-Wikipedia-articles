<p><strong>Wayne Douglas Gretzky</strong>, <a href="Order_of_Canada" title="wikilink">CC</a> (; born January 26, 1961) is a <a href="Canadians" title="wikilink">Canadian</a> former professional <a href="ice_hockey" title="wikilink">ice hockey</a> player and former head coach. Nicknamed &quot;The Great One&quot;, he is generally regarded as the best player in the history of the <a href="National_Hockey_League" title="wikilink">National Hockey League</a> (NHL), and has been called &quot;the greatest hockey player ever&quot;<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> by many sportswriters, players, and the NHL itself. Upon his retirement on April 18, 1999, he held forty regular-season records, fifteen playoff records, and six <a href="NHL_All-Star_Game" title="wikilink">All-Star</a> records. He is the only NHL player to total over 200 points in one season – a feat he accomplished four times. In addition, he tallied over 100 points in 16 professional seasons, 14 of them consecutive. Gretzky's <a href="jersey_number" title="wikilink">jersey number</a>, 99, has been <a href="List_of_NHL_retired_numbers" title="wikilink">retired</a> by all teams in the National Hockey League.

<p>Born and raised in <a href="Brantford" class="uri" title="wikilink">Brantford</a>, <a href="Ontario" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ontario</a>, Gretzky honed his skills at a backyard rink and regularly played <a href="List_of_ice_hockey_leagues#Amateur" title="wikilink">minor hockey</a> at a level far above his peers.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> Despite his unimpressive stature, strength and speed, Gretzky's intelligence and reading of the game were unrivaled. He was adept at dodging checks from opposing players, and he could consistently anticipate where the puck was going to be and execute the right move at the right time. Gretzky also became known for setting up behind the net, an area that was <a href="nickname" title="wikilink">nicknamed</a> &quot;Gretzky's office&quot; because of his skills there.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1978, he signed with the <a href="Indianapolis_Racers" title="wikilink">Indianapolis Racers</a> of the World Hockey Association (WHA), where he briefly played before being traded to the <a href="Edmonton_Oilers" title="wikilink">Edmonton Oilers</a>. When the WHA folded, the Oilers joined the NHL, where he established many scoring records and led his team to four <a href="Stanley_Cup" title="wikilink">Stanley Cup</a> championships. His trade to the <a href="Los_Angeles_Kings" title="wikilink">Los Angeles Kings</a> on August 9, 1988, had an immediate impact on the team's performance, eventually leading them to the <a href="1993_Stanley_Cup_Finals" title="wikilink">1993 Stanley Cup Finals</a>, and is credited with popularizing hockey in California.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> Gretzky played briefly for the <a href="St._Louis_Blues" title="wikilink">St. Louis Blues</a> and finished his career with the <a href="New_York_Rangers" title="wikilink">New York Rangers</a>. In his career, Gretzky captured nine <a href="Hart_Trophy" title="wikilink">Hart Trophies</a> as the most valuable player, ten <a href="Art_Ross_Trophy" title="wikilink">Art Ross Trophies</a> for most <a href="point_(ice_hockey)" title="wikilink">points</a> in a season, five <a href="Lady_Byng_Memorial_Trophy" title="wikilink">Lady Byng Trophies</a> for sportsmanship and performance, five <a href="Lester_B._Pearson_Award" title="wikilink">Lester B. Pearson Awards</a>, and two <a href="Conn_Smythe_Trophy" title="wikilink">Conn Smythe Trophies</a> as playoff MVP.</p>
<p>After his retirement in <a href="1998&lt;U+2013&gt;99_NHL_season" title="wikilink">1999</a>, he was immediately inducted into the <a href="Hockey_Hall_of_Fame" title="wikilink">Hockey Hall of Fame</a>, and is the most recent player to have the waiting period waived. He became Executive Director for the <a href="Canadian_national_men&#39;s_hockey_team" title="wikilink">Canadian national men's hockey team</a> during the <a href="2002_Winter_Olympics" title="wikilink">2002 Winter Olympics</a>, in which the team won a gold medal. In <a href="1999&lt;U+2013&gt;2000_NHL_season" title="wikilink">2000</a> he became part owner of the Phoenix Coyotes, and following the <a href="2004&lt;U+2013&gt;05_NHL_lockout" title="wikilink">2004&lt;U+2013&gt;05 NHL lockout</a> he became the team's head coach.</p>
<h2 id="early-years">Early years</h2>
<p>Prior to <a href="World_War_I" title="wikilink">World War I</a>, Gretzky's paternal grandfather Anton (Tony) Gretzky immigrated along with his family to <a href="Canada" class="uri" title="wikilink">Canada</a> via the <a href="United_States" title="wikilink">United States</a> from the <a href="Russian_Empire" title="wikilink">Russian Empire</a> (what is now <a href="Grodno" title="wikilink">Grodno, Belarus</a>). Following the war, Anton would marry his wife, Mary, who immigrated from <a href="Pidhaitsi" class="uri" title="wikilink">Pidhaitsi</a>, <a href="Second_Polish_Republic" title="wikilink">interwar Poland</a> (now <a href="Ukraine" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ukraine</a>). Tony and Mary owned a  <a href="cucumber" class="uri" title="wikilink">cucumber</a> farm in Canning, Ontario where <a href="Walter_Gretzky" title="wikilink">Walter Gretzky</a> was born and raised and where he met Wayne's mother, Phyllis Hockin. They married in 1960, and lived in an apartment in <a href="Brantford,_Ontario" title="wikilink">Brantford, Ontario</a>, where Walter worked for <a href="Bell_Canada" title="wikilink">Bell Telephone Canada</a>.. The family moved into a house on Varadi Avenue in Brantford seven months after Wayne was born, chosen partly because it was flat enough to make an ice rink on every winter. Wayne was joined by a sister, Kim (b. 1963), and brothers <a href="Keith_Gretzky" title="wikilink">Keith</a>, Glen and <a href="Brent_Gretzky" title="wikilink">Brent</a>. The family would regularly visit Tony and Mary's farm and watch <em><a href="Hockey_Night_in_Canada" title="wikilink">Hockey Night in Canada</a></em> together. By age two, Wayne was trying to score <a href="goal_(ice_hockey)" title="wikilink">goals</a> against Mary using a souvenir stick. The farm was where Wayne skated on ice for the first time, aged two years, 10 months.</p>
<p>Gretzky's ancestry is typically described as English on his mother's side and Belarusian or Polish on his father's side, but there is also evidence of <a href="Ukrainians" title="wikilink">Ukrainian</a> ancestry on his father's side. In interviews, Gretzky's father Walter has stated that his parents were <a href="Belarusians" class="uri" title="wikilink">Belarusians</a>,<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> while on other occasions he has mentioned his family's <a href="Poles" title="wikilink">Polish</a> ancestry. Anton Gretzky has been described as having &quot;been born in Russia with <a href="Ukrainians" title="wikilink">Ukrainian</a> forebears&quot; and &quot;the only Slavic language spoken in the Gretzky family [was] <a href="Ukrainian_language" title="wikilink">Ukrainian</a>&quot;. Gretzky's mother Phyllis is of English descent and she is related to <a href="United_Kingdom" title="wikilink">British</a> General <a href="Isaac_Brock" title="wikilink">Sir Isaac Brock</a>, a hero of the <a href="War_of_1812" title="wikilink">War of 1812</a>.</p>
<p>Walter taught Wayne, Keith, Brent, Glen and their friends hockey on a rink he made in the back yard of the family home, nicknamed the &quot;Wally Coliseum&quot;. Drills included skating around Javex bleach bottles and tin cans, and flipping pucks over scattered hockey sticks to be able to pick up the puck again in full flight. Additionally, Walter gave the advice to &quot;skate where the puck's going, not where it's been&quot;. Wayne was a classic <a href="child_prodigy" title="wikilink">prodigy</a> whose extraordinary skills made him the target of jealous parents.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p>Gretzky's first team, at age six, was a team of ten-year-olds, starting a pattern where Gretzky always played at a level far above his peers through his minor hockey years.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> His first coach, Dick Martin, remarked that he handled the puck better than the ten-year-olds. According to Martin, &quot;Wayne was so good that you could have a boy of your own who was a tremendous hockey player, and he'd get overlooked because of what the Gretzky kid was doing.&quot; The sweaters for ten-year-olds were far too large for Gretzky, who coped by tucking the sweater into his pants on the right side. He continued doing this throughout his NHL career.</p>
<p>By the age of ten he had scored 378 goals and 139 <a href="assist_(ice_hockey)" title="wikilink">assists</a> in just one season with the Brantford Nadrofsky Steelers.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> His play now attracted media attention beyond his hometown of Brantford, including a profile by John Iaboni in the <em><a href="Toronto_Telegram" title="wikilink">Toronto Telegram</a></em> in October 1971.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> By age 13, he had scored over 1,000 goals. His play attracted considerable negative attention from other players' parents, including those of his teammates, and he was often booed. According to Walter, the &quot;capper&quot; was being booed on &quot;Brantford Day&quot; at Toronto's <a href="Maple_Leaf_Gardens" title="wikilink">Maple Leaf Gardens</a> in February 1975.</p>
<p>When Gretzky was 14, his family arranged for him to move to and play hockey in <a href="Toronto" class="uri" title="wikilink">Toronto</a>, partly to further his career, and partly to remove him from the uncomfortable pressure he faced in his hometown. The Gretzkys had to legally challenge the Canadian Amateur Hockey Association to win Wayne the right to play elsewhere, which was disallowed at the time. The Gretzkys won, and Wayne played Junior B hockey with the <a href="Toronto_Nationals_(1970&lt;U+2013&gt;1980)" title="wikilink">Toronto Nationals</a>. He earned Rookie of the Year honours in the <a href="Metro_Junior_A_Hockey_League" title="wikilink">Metro Junior B Hockey League</a> in 1975&lt;U+2013&gt;76, with 60 points in 28 games. The following year, as a 15-year-old, he had 72 points in 32 games with the same team, then known as the Seneca Nationals.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> That year, he also played three games with the Peterborough Petes in the Ontario Hockey Association as an emergency call-up, and even then <em>the Great One</em> impressed scouts with his abilities despite his small stature and youth. In addition, he signed with his first agent, Bob Behnke.</p>
<p>Despite his offensive statistics, two teams bypassed him in the 1977 <a href="Ontario_Hockey_League" title="wikilink">OMJHL</a> Midget Draft of 16-year-olds. The <a href="Oshawa_Generals" title="wikilink">Oshawa Generals</a> picked <a href="Tom_McCarthy_(ice_hockey_b._1960)" title="wikilink">Tom McCarthy</a>, and the <a href="Niagara_Falls_Flyers" title="wikilink">Niagara Falls Flyers</a> picked <a href="Steve_Peters_(ice_hockey)" title="wikilink">Steve Peters</a> second overall. With the third pick, the <a href="Sault_Ste._Marie_Greyhounds" title="wikilink">Sault Ste. Marie Greyhounds</a> selected Gretzky, even though Walter Gretzky had told the team that Wayne would not move to <a href="Sault_Ste._Marie,_Ontario" title="wikilink">Sault Ste. Marie</a>, a <a href="northern_Ontario" title="wikilink">northern Ontario</a> city that inflicts a heavy traveling schedule on its junior team. The Gretzkys made an arrangement with a local family they knew and Wayne played a season in the <a href="Ontario_Hockey_League" title="wikilink">Ontario Hockey League</a> at the age of 16 with the Greyhounds.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> It was with the Greyhounds that Wayne first wore the number 99 on his jersey. He originally wanted to wear number 9&lt;U+2014&gt;for his hockey hero <a href="Gordie_Howe" title="wikilink">Gordie Howe</a>&lt;U+2014&gt;but it was already being worn by teammate Brian Gualazzi. At coach <a href="Murray_MacPherson" title="wikilink">Muzz MacPherson</a>'s suggestion, Gretzky settled on 99.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<p>At 16, in his single year at the major junior level, Gretzky surpassed the OMJHL single-season scoring record, winning the OMJHL <a href="Emms_Family_Award" title="wikilink">Rookie of the Year</a> and <a href="William_Hanley_Trophy" title="wikilink">Most Sportsmanlike</a> awards.</p>
<h2 id="world-hockey-association">World Hockey Association</h2>
<p>In 1978, the <a href="World_Hockey_Association" title="wikilink">World Hockey Association</a> (WHA) league was in competition with the established NHL. The NHL did not allow the signing of players under the age of 20, but the WHA had no rules regarding such signings. Several WHA teams courted Gretzky, notably the <a href="Indianapolis_Racers" title="wikilink">Indianapolis Racers</a> and the <a href="Birmingham_Bulls" title="wikilink">Birmingham Bulls</a>. Birmingham Bulls owner John F. Bassett wanted to confront the NHL by signing as many young and promising superstars as possible and saw Gretzky as the most promising young prospect, but it was Racers owner <a href="Nelson_Skalbania" title="wikilink">Nelson Skalbania</a> who signed 17-year-old Gretzky to a seven-year personal services contract worth $1.75 million US.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> Gretzky scored his first professional goal against <a href="Dave_Dryden" title="wikilink">Dave Dryden</a> of the <a href="Edmonton_Oilers" title="wikilink">Edmonton Oilers</a> in his fifth game, and his second goal four seconds later. Skalbania opted to have Gretzky sign a personal-services contract rather than a standard player contract in part because he knew a <a href="NHL&lt;U+2013&gt;WHA_merger" title="wikilink">deal</a> to take some WHA teams into the NHL was in the works. He also knew that the Racers could not hope to be included among those teams, and hoped to keep the Racers alive long enough to collect compensation from the surviving teams when the WHA dissolved, as well as any funds earned from selling the young star.</p>
<p>Gretzky only played eight games for Indianapolis. The Racers were losing $40,000 per game. Skalbania told Gretzky he would be moved, offering him a choice between Edmonton and Winnipeg. On the advice of his agent, Gretzky picked Edmonton, but the move was not that simple. Gretzky, <a href="goaltender" class="uri" title="wikilink">goaltender</a> <a href="Eddie_Mio" title="wikilink">Eddie Mio</a> and forward <a href="Peter_Driscoll" title="wikilink">Peter Driscoll</a> were put on a private plane, not knowing where they would land and what team they would be joining. While in the air, Skalbania worked on the deal. Skalbania offered to play a game of <a href="backgammon" class="uri" title="wikilink">backgammon</a> with Winnipeg owner Michael Gobuty, the stakes being if Gobuty won, he would get Gretzky and if he lost, he had to give Skalbania a share of the Jets. Gobuty turned down the proposal and the players landed in Edmonton. Skalbania sold Gretzky, Mio and Driscoll to his former partner, and then-owner of the Edmonton Oilers, <a href="Peter_Pocklington" title="wikilink">Peter Pocklington</a>. Although the announced price was $850,000, Pocklington actually paid $700,000. Mio paid the $4,000 bill for the flight with his credit card. The money was not enough to keep the Racers alive; they folded that December.</p>
<p>One of the highlights of Gretzky's season was his appearance in the 1979 WHA All-Star Game. The format was a three-game series between the WHA All-Stars against <a href="HC_Dynamo_Moscow" title="wikilink">Dynamo Moscow</a>. The WHA All-Stars were coached by <a href="Jacques_Demers" title="wikilink">Jacques Demers</a>, who put Gretzky on a line with his boyhood idol Gordie Howe and his son, <a href="Mark_Howe" title="wikilink">Mark Howe</a>. In game one, the line scored seven points, and the WHA All-Stars won by a score of 4&lt;U+2013&gt;2. In game two, Gretzky and Mark Howe each scored a goal and Gordie Howe picked up an assist as the WHA won 4&lt;U+2013&gt;2. The line did not score in the final game, but the WHA won by a score of 4&lt;U+2013&gt;3.</p>
<p>On Gretzky's 18th birthday, January 26, 1979, Pocklington signed him to a 10-year personal services contract (the longest in hockey history at the time) worth <a href="Canadian_dollar" title="wikilink">C$</a>3 million, with options for 10 more years.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> Gretzky finished third in the league in scoring at 110 points, behind <a href="Robbie_Ftorek" title="wikilink">Robbie Ftorek</a> and <a href="R&lt;U+00E9&gt;al_Cloutier" title="wikilink">R&lt;U+00E9&gt;al Cloutier</a>. Gretzky captured the <a href="Lou_Kaplan_Trophy" title="wikilink">Lou Kaplan Trophy</a> as rookie of the year, and helped the Oilers to first overall in the league.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> The Oilers reached the <a href="Avco_World_Trophy" title="wikilink">Avco World Trophy</a> finals, where they lost to the <a href="Winnipeg_Jets_(1972&lt;U+2013&gt;96)" title="wikilink">Winnipeg Jets</a> in six games.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> It was Gretzky's only year in the WHA, as the league folded following the season.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="nhl-career">NHL career</h2>
<p>After the World Hockey Association folded in 1979, the Edmonton Oilers and three other teams joined the NHL.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> Gretzky's success in the WHA carried over into the NHL, despite some critics suggesting he would flounder in what was considered the bigger, tougher, and more talented league.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> The Oilers, like the other surviving WHA teams, were allowed to protect two goaltenders and two skaters from being reclaimed by the established NHL teams. Under normal circumstances, Gretzky would have been removed from the Oilers and placed in the pool for the <a href="1979_NHL_Entry_Draft" title="wikilink">1979 NHL Entry Draft</a>, but his personal services contract prevented this.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>

<p>The Edmonton Oilers finished first overall in their last WHA regular season.

<h3 id="the-trade">&quot;The Trade&quot;</h3>
<p>Two hours after the Oilers won the Stanley Cup in 1988, Gretzky learned from his father that the Oilers were planning to deal him to another team. Walter had known for months, but kept it from Gretzky so as to not upset him. According to Walter, Gretzky was being &quot;shopped&quot; to Los Angeles, Detroit, New York and Vancouver. According to Gretzky, Pocklington needed money as his other business ventures were not doing well (a similar reason to the cause of <a href="Babe_Ruth" title="wikilink">Babe Ruth</a> being sold to the <a href="New_York_Yankees" title="wikilink">New York Yankees</a>), and had gone &quot;sour&quot; on Gretzky and wanted to move him. At first, Gretzky did not want to leave Edmonton, but he later received a call from <a href="Los_Angeles_Kings" title="wikilink">Los Angeles Kings</a> owner <a href="Bruce_McNall" title="wikilink">Bruce McNall</a> while on his honeymoon asking permission to meet and discuss the deal. Gretzky informed McNall that his prerequisites for a deal to take place were that <a href="Marty_McSorley" title="wikilink">Marty McSorley</a> and <a href="Mike_Krushelnyski" title="wikilink">Mike Krushelnyski</a> join him as teammates in Los Angeles. After the details of the trade were finalized by McNall and Pocklington, one final condition had to be met: Gretzky had to call Pocklington and request a trade. When Pocklington revealed his plans to trade Gretzky to Oilers general manager and head coach <a href="Glen_Sather" title="wikilink">Glen Sather</a>, Sather went to work trying to stop the trade, but, when he found out Gretzky played a part in it, he changed his attitude to GM as he requested <a href="Luc_Robitaille" title="wikilink">Luc Robitaille</a> in exchange. The Kings refused, instead offering <a href="Jimmy_Carson" title="wikilink">Jimmy Carson</a>.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a></p>
<p>On August 9, 1988, in a move that heralded significant change in the NHL, the Oilers traded Gretzky, along with McSorley and Krushelnyski, to the Kings for Carson, <a href="Martin_Gelinas" title="wikilink">Martin Gelinas</a>, $15 million in cash, and the Kings' first-round draft picks in <a href="1989_NHL_Entry_Draft" title="wikilink">1989</a> (later traded to the <a href="New_Jersey_Devils" title="wikilink">New Jersey Devils</a> – New Jersey selected <a href="Jason_Miller_(ice_hockey)" title="wikilink">Jason Miller</a>), <a href="1991_NHL_Entry_Draft" title="wikilink">1991</a> (<a href="Martin_Ru&lt;U+010D&gt;&lt;U+00ED&gt;nsk&lt;U+00FD&gt;" title="wikilink">Martin Rucinsky</a>), and <a href="1993_NHL_Entry_Draft" title="wikilink">1993</a> (<a href="Nick_Stajduhar" title="wikilink">Nick Stajduhar</a>).<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> &quot;The Trade&quot;, as it came to be known,<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> upset Canadians to the extent that <a href="New_Democratic_Party" title="wikilink">New Democratic Party</a> <a href="House_Leader" title="wikilink">House Leader</a> <a href="Nelson_Riis" title="wikilink">Nelson Riis</a> demanded that the government block it,<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> and Pocklington was burned in effigy outside the <a href="Rexall_Place" title="wikilink">Northlands Coliseum</a>.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a> Gretzky himself was considered a &quot;traitor&quot; by some Canadians for turning his back on his adopted hometown, and his home country; his motivation was widely rumoured to be the furtherance of <a href="Janet_Jones" title="wikilink">his wife</a>'s acting career.<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a></p>
<p>Edmontonians bore no grudge against Gretzky. On his first appearance in Edmonton after the trade&lt;U+2014&gt;a game that was nationally televised in Canada&lt;U+2014&gt;he received a four-minute standing ovation. The arena was sold out, and the attendance of 17,503 was the Oilers' biggest crowd ever to that date. Large cheers erupted for his first shift, his first touch of the puck, his two assists, and for <a href="Mark_Messier" title="wikilink">Mark Messier</a>'s body check of Gretzky into the boards. After the game, Gretzky took the opportunity to confirm his patriotism: &quot;I'm still proud to be a Canadian. I didn't desert my country. I moved because I was traded and that's where my job is. But I'm Canadian to the core. I hope Canadians understand that.&quot; After the 1988&lt;U+2013&gt;89 season, a life-sized bronze statue of Gretzky was erected outside the Northlands Coliseum, holding the Stanley Cup over his head (picture shown above, to the right).</p>

<p>The Kings named Gretzky their alternate captain. He made an immediate impact on the ice, scoring on his first shot on goal in the first regular-season game. The Kings got off to their best start ever, winning four straight on their way to qualifying for the playoffs. Despite being <a href="Underdog_(competition)" title="wikilink">underdogs</a> against the defending Stanley Cup Champion Oilers in the <a href="Smythe_Division" title="wikilink">Smythe Division</a> semifinals, Gretzky led the Kings to a shocking upset of his old squad, spearheading the Kings' return from a 3&lt;U+2013&gt;1 series deficit to win the series 4&lt;U+2013&gt;3. He was nervous that Edmonton would greet him with boos, but they were eagerly waiting for him.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a> For only the second time in his NHL career, Gretzky finished second in scoring, but narrowly beat out <a href="Pittsburgh_Penguins" title="wikilink">Pittsburgh</a>'s <a href="Mario_Lemieux" title="wikilink">Mario Lemieux</a> (who scored 199 points) for the Hart Trophy as MVP.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a> In 1990, the <a href="Associated_Press" title="wikilink">Associated Press</a> named him Male Athlete of the Decade.<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a></p>

Playing on a line with <a href="Pittsburgh_Penguins" title="wikilink">Pittsburgh Penguins</a> superstar <a href="Mario_Lemieux" title="wikilink">Mario Lemieux</a>, he recorded a tournament-best 21 points in nine games. After losing the first game of a best-of-three final series against the Soviets, Gretzky propelled Canada with a five-assist performance, including the game-winning pass to Lemieux in overtime to extend the tournament. In the deciding game three, Gretzky and Lemieux once again combined for the game-winner. With the score tied 5&lt;U+2013&gt;5 and 1:26 minutes to go in regulation, Lemieux one-timed a pass from Gretzky on a 3&lt;U+2013&gt;on&lt;U+2013&gt;1 with defenceman <a href="Larry_Murphy_(ice_hockey)" title="wikilink">Larry Murphy</a>. Lemieux scored to win the tournament for Canada; the play is widely regarded as one of the most memorable plays in Canadian international competition.</p>
<p>The <a href="1991_Canada_Cup" title="wikilink">1991 Canada Cup</a> marked the last time the tournament was played under the &quot;Canada Cup&quot; moniker. Gretzky led the tournament for the fourth and final time with 12 points in seven games. He did not, however, compete in the final against the <a href="United_States_national_men&#39;s_ice_hockey_team" title="wikilink">United States</a> due to a back injury.<a href="#fn83" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref83"><sup>83</sup></a> Canada nevertheless won in two games by scores of 4&lt;U+2013&gt;1 and 4&lt;U+2013&gt;2. Five years later, the tournament was revived and renamed the <a href="World_Cup_of_Hockey" title="wikilink">World Cup</a> in <a href="1996_World_Cup_of_Hockey" title="wikilink">1996</a>. It marked the first time Gretzky did not finish as the tournament's leading scorer with seven points in eight games for fourth overall.<a href="#fn84" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref84"><sup>84</sup></a> The 1996 World Cup also ended Canada's winning streak at the tournament (including the Canada Cups), losing in three games of a best-of-three final.</p>

<h2 id="influences-and-skills">Influences and skills</h2>
<p>Gretzky's basic athletic abilities were not considered impressive. He was  tall, weighing only  as an 18-year-old NHL rookie in 1979, and  at the end of his career in 1999. At the beginning of Gretzky's NHL career, many critics opined that Gretzky was &quot;too small, too wiry, and too slow to be a force in the NHL&quot;.<a href="#fn91" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref91"><sup>91</sup></a> During his years with the Oilers, the team twice annually conducted individual strength and stamina tests. According to Gretzky himself, he always finished dead last in peripheral vision, flexibility and strength, and could only bench press . On the other hand, his intelligence and reading of the game was unrivalled, and he could consistently anticipate where the puck was going to be and execute the right move at the right time.<a href="#fn92" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref92"><sup>92</sup></a> It was said that he &quot;seems to have eyes in the back of his head&quot; and had a knack of &quot;rolling with a check&quot;.<a href="#fn93" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref93"><sup>93</sup></a> One commentator said, &lt;U+201C&gt;He could envision the whole rink in his mind and how players were moving within it.&lt;U+201D&gt; Because of this &lt;U+201C&gt;vision,&lt;U+201D&gt; Gretzky was sometimes called the &lt;U+201C&gt;Einstein of Hockey.&lt;U+201D&gt;</p>
<p>Hall of Fame defenceman Bobby Orr said of Gretzky, &quot;He passes better than anybody I've ever seen. And he thinks so far ahead.&quot;<a href="#fn94" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref94"><sup>94</sup></a> Gretzky himself referred to it as having &quot;... a feeling about where a teammate is going to be, a lot of times, I can turn and pass without looking.&quot;<a href="#fn95" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref95"><sup>95</sup></a></p>
<p>Much has been written about Gretzky&lt;U+2019&gt;s highly-developed hockey instincts, but he once explained that what appeared to be instinct was in large part the effect of his relentless study of the game and a resulting deep understanding of its shifting patterns and dynamics. Veteran hockey journalist Peter Gzowski says that elite athletes in all sports understand the game so well, and in such detail, that they can instantly recognize and capitalize upon emerging patterns of play. Analyzing Gretzky&lt;U+2019&gt;s hockey skills, he says, &lt;U+201C&gt;What we take to be creative genius is in fact a reaction to a situation that he has stored in his brain as deeply and firmly as his own phone number.&quot; Gzowski presented this theory to Gretzky, and he fully agreed. &lt;U+201C&gt;Absolutely,&lt;U+201D&gt; Gretzky said. &lt;U+201C&gt;That&lt;U+2019&gt;s a hundred percent right. It&lt;U+2019&gt;s all practice. I got it from my dad. Nine out of ten people think it&lt;U+2019&gt;s instinct, and it isn&lt;U+2019&gt;t. Nobody would ever say a doctor had learned his profession by instinct; yet in my own way I&lt;U+2019&gt;ve put in almost as much time studying hockey as a medical student puts in studying medicine.&lt;U+201D&gt;<a href="#fn96" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref96"><sup>96</sup></a></p>
<p>Gzowski says that Gretzky seemed to be able to, in effect, slow down time. &lt;U+201C&gt;There is an unhurried grace to everything Gretzky does on the ice. Winding up for the slapshot, he will stop for an almost imperceptible moment at the top of his arc, like a golfer with a rhythmic swing.&lt;U+201D&gt; Gzowski explains that another skill often possessed by elite athletes, is that they have, in effect, &quot;more room in the flow of time&quot; than do ordinary athletes.<a href="#fn97" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref97"><sup>97</sup></a> &lt;U+201C&gt;Gretzky uses this room to insert an extra beat into his actions. In front of the net, eyeball to eyeball with the goaltender . . . he will . . . hold the puck one . . . extra instant, upsetting the anticipated rhythm of the game, extending the moment. . . He distorts time, and not only by slowing it down. Sometimes he will release the puck before he appears to be ready, threading the pass through a maze of players precisely to the blade of a teammate&lt;U+2019&gt;s stick, or finding a chink in a goaltender&lt;U+2019&gt;s armour and slipping the puck into it . . . before the goaltender is ready to react.&lt;U+201D&gt;<a href="#fn98" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref98"><sup>98</sup></a></p>
<p>But Gretzky&lt;U+2019&gt;s skill as an athlete was not all mental. Along with Gordie Howe, Gretzky shared &lt;U+201C&gt;an exceptional capacity to renew his energy resources quickly.&lt;U+201D&gt; In 1980, an exercise physiologist tested all of the Edmonton Oilers, and when he saw the results of Gretzky&lt;U+2019&gt;s test of recuperative abilities, he said &lt;U+201C&gt;he thought the machine had broken.&lt;U+201D&gt; Wayne often had his best moments in the third period.<a href="#fn99" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref99"><sup>99</sup></a></p>
<p>He was, in fact, an exceptional all-round athlete. Growing up, he was a competitive runner, and he batted .492 for the Brantford CKCP Braves in the summer of 1980. As a result, he was offered a contract by the major-league baseball team, the Toronto Blue Jays.<a href="#fn100" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref100"><sup>100</sup></a> History repeated itself in June, 2011, when Gretzky&lt;U+2019&gt;s 17-year-old son, Trevor, was offered a contract with the Chicago Cubs. He signed with the Cubs in July, 2011.<a href="#fn101" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref101"><sup>101</sup></a></p>
<p>Gretzky's skills were developed on a backyard rink at his home, with extraordinary dedication and the encouragement and teachings of his father Walter. Walter Gretzky had played Junior B hockey, but was slowed by <a href="chicken_pox" title="wikilink">chicken pox</a> and failed in a tryout for the Junior A Toronto Marlboros, ending his playing career. Walter cultivated a love of hockey in his sons and provided them with a backyard rink and drills to enhance their skills. On the backyard rink, nicknamed the &quot;Wally Coliseum&quot;, winter was total hockey immersion with Walter as mentor-teacher as well as teammate. According to Brent Gretzky, &quot;It was definitely pressed on us, but we loved the game. Without the direction of the father, I don't know where I'd be.&quot;</p>
<p>The rink itself was built so that Walter could keep an eye on his boys from the warmth of his kitchen, instead of watching them outdoors on a neighbourhood rink, as Wayne put in long hours on skates. Walter's drills were his own invention, but were ahead of their time in Canada. Gretzky would later remark that the Soviet National Team's practice drills, which impressed Canada in 1972, had nothing to offer him: &quot;I'd been doing these drills since I was three. My dad was very smart.&quot;</p>
<p>Where Gretzky differed from others in his development was in the extraordinary commitment of time on the ice. In his autobiography, he wrote:</p>
<dl>

<dd>All I wanted to do in the winters was be on the ice. I'd get up in the morning, skate from 7:00 to 8:30, go to school, come home at 3:30, stay on the ice until my mom insisted I come in for dinner, eat in my skates, then go back out until 9:00. On Saturdays and Sundays we'd have huge games, but nighttime became my time. It was a sort of unwritten rule around the neighbourhood that I was to be out there myself or with my dad.
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Gretzky would prod next-door neighbour Brian Rizzetto to play goal after sundown to practice his backhand.</p>
<p>Gretzky also excelled at <a href="baseball" class="uri" title="wikilink">baseball</a> and <a href="box_lacrosse" title="wikilink">box lacrosse</a>, which he played during the summer. At age ten, after scoring 196 goals in his hockey league, he scored 158 goals in lacrosse. According to Gretzky, lacrosse was where he learned to protect himself from hard <a href="Checking_(ice_hockey)" title="wikilink">body checking</a>: &quot;In those days you could be hit from behind in lacrosse, as well as cross-checked, so you had to learn how to roll body checks for self-protection.&quot; Wayne, who weighed far less than the NHL average, adroitly applied this technique as a professional player, avoiding checks with such skill that a rumour circulated that there was an unwritten rule not to hit Gretzky. But Wayne himself dispelled this rumor at the end of one grueling season with the Edmonton Oilers, in which he had suffered a mild concussion as a result of what writer Michael Benson called a &quot;cheap shot&quot; from <a href="Winnipeg_Jets_(1972&lt;U+2013&gt;96)" title="wikilink">Winnipeg Jets</a> player <a href="Dale_Hawerchuk" title="wikilink">Dale Hawerchuk</a>. &quot;People say there is an unwritten rule that you can&lt;U+2019&gt;t hit Gretzky,&quot; Wayne said, &lt;U+201C&gt;but that is not true.&quot; Fellow hockey Hall-of-Famer <a href="Denis_Potvin" title="wikilink">Denis Potvin</a> compared attempting to hit Gretzky to &lt;U+201C&gt;wrapping your arms around fog. You saw him but when you reached out to grab him your hands felt nothing, maybe just a chill. He had the strongest danger radar of anyone on the ice.&lt;U+201D&gt; Gordie Howe once said that parting Gretzky's hair would reveal a third eye.<a href="#fn102" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref102"><sup>102</sup></a> Potvin, a 205-pounder who was three times voted the NHL&lt;U+2019&gt;s top defenseman, also said that part of the problem in hitting Gretzky hard was that he was &quot;a tough guy to dislike... what was there to hate about Gretzky? It was like running Gandhi into a corner.&quot;</p>
<p>Gretzky became known for setting up behind the net, an area that was nicknamed &quot;Gretzky's office&quot; because of his skills there.<a href="#fn103" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref103"><sup>103</sup></a> He could pass to teammates like <a href="Luc_Robitaille" title="wikilink">Luc Robitaille</a> and <a href="Jari_Kurri" title="wikilink">Jari Kurri</a>, or jump out quickly for a wrap-around shot. Gretzky became accustomed to the position after watching and studying <a href="Bobby_Clarke" title="wikilink">Bobby Clarke</a> play in that zone.<a href="#fn104" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref104"><sup>104</sup></a> In honour of that, for his last game there were two large &quot;99&quot;s painted on the ice behind the goal.<a href="#fn105" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref105"><sup>105</sup></a></p>

<p>Although Gretzky had previously stated he would not participate in any &quot;old-timers exhibition games&quot;,<a href="#fn140" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref140"><sup>140</sup></a> on November 22, 2003, he took to the ice one last time to help celebrate the Edmonton Oilers' 25th anniversary as an NHL team. The <a href="Heritage_Classic" title="wikilink">Heritage Classic</a>, held at <a href="Commonwealth_Stadium_(Edmonton)" title="wikilink">Commonwealth Stadium</a> in Edmonton, was the first NHL game to be played outdoors.<a href="#fn141" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref141"><sup>141</sup></a> It was preceded by the Mega Stars game, which featured Gretzky and many of his <a href="Edmonton_Oilers#Dynasty_years_.281983.E2.80.931990.29" title="wikilink">Oiler Dynasty</a> teammates against a group of retired <a href="Montreal_Canadiens" title="wikilink">Montreal Canadiens</a> players (whose likes included <a href="Claude_Lemieux" title="wikilink">Claude Lemieux</a>, <a href="Guy_Lafleur" title="wikilink">Guy Lafleur</a> and others).

<h3 id="business-ventures">Business ventures</h3>
<p>Gretzky has owned or partnered in the ownership of two sports teams before becoming a partner in the Phoenix Coyotes. In 1985, Gretzky bought the <a href="Gatineau_Olympiques" title="wikilink">Hull Olympiques</a> of the <a href="Quebec_Major_Junior_Hockey_League" title="wikilink">Quebec Major Junior Hockey League</a> for $175,000 CA.<a href="#fn157" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref157"><sup>157</sup></a> During his ownership, the team's colors were changed to silver and black, presaging the change in team jersey colors when he played for the Los Angeles Kings. For the first season that Gretzky played in Los Angeles, the Kings had their training camp at the Olympiques' arena.<a href="#fn158" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref158"><sup>158</sup></a> Gretzky eventually sold the team in 1992 for $550,000 CA.<a href="#fn159" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref159"><sup>159</sup></a></p>

The club won the <a href="Grey_Cup" title="wikilink">Grey Cup</a> championship in the first year of the partnership but struggled in the two following seasons, and the partnership sold the team before the 1994 season. Only McNall's name was engraved on the Grey Cup as team owner, but in November 2007, the <a href="Canadian_Football_League" title="wikilink">CFL</a> corrected the oversight, adding Gretzky's and Candy's names.<a href="#fn160" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref160"><sup>160</sup></a> In 1992, Gretzky and McNall partnered in an investment to buy a rare <a href="Honus_Wagner" title="wikilink">Honus Wagner</a> <a href="T206" class="uri" title="wikilink">T206</a> <a href="cigarette_card" title="wikilink">cigarette card</a> for $500,000 US, later selling the card.
