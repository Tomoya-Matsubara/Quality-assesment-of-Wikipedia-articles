As a result, Jack enlists <a href="Tracy_Jordan" title="wikilink">Tracy Jordan</a> (<a href="Tracy_Morgan" title="wikilink">Tracy Morgan</a>) to come up with some new development ideas. Meanwhile, <a href="Liz_Lemon" title="wikilink">Liz Lemon</a> (<a href="Tina_Fey" title="wikilink">Tina Fey</a>), the head writer of the fictitious sketch show <em>The Girlie Show with Tracy Jordan</em> (<em>TGS</em>) is fed up with the criticism her writing staff gives her, and finally <a href="Jenna_Maroney" title="wikilink">Jenna Maroney</a> (<a href="Jane_Krakowski" title="wikilink">Jane Krakowski</a>) helps <a href="Kenneth_Parcell" title="wikilink">Kenneth Parcell</a> (<a href="Jack_McBrayer" title="wikilink">Jack McBrayer</a>) reapply in the competitive <a href="NBC_page" title="wikilink">NBC page</a> program.</p>

<h2 id="plot">Plot</h2>
<p>NBC executive <a href="Jack_Donaghy" title="wikilink">Jack Donaghy</a> (<a href="Alec_Baldwin" title="wikilink">Alec Baldwin</a>) attends a Congressional hearing in <a href="Washington_D.C." title="wikilink">Washington D.C.</a> in discussion about the Kabletown-NBC merger deal. He is able to consolidate support for the deal, until Representative Regina Bookman (<a href="Queen_Latifah" title="wikilink">Queen Latifah</a>) calls out NBC for being racist and demands that there be more diversity in the programming lineup. Following the hearing, Jack goes back to New York and asks <a href="Tracy_Jordan" title="wikilink">Tracy Jordan</a> (<a href="Tracy_Morgan" title="wikilink">Tracy Morgan</a>) and <a href="List_of_30_Rock_characters#Dot_Com_Slattery" title="wikilink">&quot;Dot Com&quot; Slattery</a> (<a href="Kevin_Brown_(actor)" title="wikilink">Kevin Brown</a>) to produce a program for the African-American community. Dot Com suggests a show called <em>Let's Stay Together</em>, about an African-American family in the 1970s, but when <a href="List_of_30_Rock_characters#Grizz_Griswold" title="wikilink">Grizz Griswold</a> (<a href="Grizz_Chapman" title="wikilink">Grizz Chapman</a>) suggests that a talking dog be added to the show, Tracy orders Dot Com to incorporate it into the rewrite, much to Dot Com's dismay.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <a href="Liz_Lemon" title="wikilink">Liz Lemon</a> (<a href="Tina_Fey" title="wikilink">Tina Fey</a>), the head writer of the <a href="sketch_show" title="wikilink">sketch show</a> <em>TGS with Tracy Jordan</em>, is unhappy about the lack of respect she gets from her writing staff and complains to Jack, her boss, about the situation. Jack asks her if staff writer <a href="Toofer_Spurlock" title="wikilink">James &quot;Toofer&quot; Spurlock</a> (<a href="Keith_Powell" title="wikilink">Keith Powell</a>) can be promoted to co-head writer in an effort to diversify NBC. Liz accepts, seeing this as an opportunity for someone else to get the lack of respect and complaints she does. She gets upset, though, when Toofer gets a television interview as head writer, and insists that she herself should also be there as she is co-head writer. The two appear on Rutherford Rice's (<a href="Reg_E._Cathey" title="wikilink">Reg E. Cathey</a>) talk show <em>Right On</em>, a show aimed toward African-American audiences. Liz gets upset when Rice gives Toofer all of the credit she deserves, as a result of her behavior she is escorted off the set by a security guard.</p>
<p>At the same time, <a href="Kenneth_Parcell" title="wikilink">Kenneth Parcell</a> (<a href="Jack_McBrayer" title="wikilink">Jack McBrayer</a>), a former <a href="NBC_page" title="wikilink">NBC page</a>, is back at NBC and wants to reapply to the page program, but notes that it has become a pageant. When <a href="Jenna_Maroney" title="wikilink">Jenna Maroney</a> (<a href="Jane_Krakowski" title="wikilink">Jane Krakowski</a>) hears of this, she volunteers to help him win the pageant using her own pageant experience. Jenna treats Kenneth as her mother Verna (<a href="Jan_Hooks" title="wikilink">Jan Hooks</a>) treated her during her pageant years. After a failed, over-the-top performance in front of Human resources mediator <a href="List_of_30_Rock_characters#Jeffrey_Weinerslav" title="wikilink">Jeffrey Weinerslav</a> (Todd Buonopane), Jenna vows to get Kenneth his job back. She goes to Jack to ask him for his help, and Jack orders Jeffrey to hire Kenneth back.</p>
<p>When Representative Bookman makes an unexpected visit to New York, Jack tries to show NBC's commitment to diversity, but is thwarted when Bookman sees signs next to two bathrooms that read &quot;Colored&quot; and &quot;White&quot; that were really intended for the just removed paper recycling bins, and Jeffrey informing Jack and Bookman that the minority slot in the page program was filled by Kenneth. Jack tries to improve the situation by giving &quot;head writer&quot; Toofer a medal for his work, but Bookman sees right through this, and discovers that Liz is the only one that truly deserves her respect, and congratulates her. After more grandstanding, Bookman tells Jack she will vote no on the Kabletown-NBC deal unless he gives her reason not to.</p>
<p>The episode ends with a taping of the <em>Let's Stay Together</em> rewrite, with the talking dog.</p>
