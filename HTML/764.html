<p>&quot;<strong>200</strong>&quot; is the fifth episode of the <a href="South_Park_(season_14)" title="wikilink">fourteenth season</a> of <em><a href="South_Park" title="wikilink">South Park</a></em>, and the 200th overall episode of the series. It originally aired on <a href="Comedy_Central" title="wikilink">Comedy Central</a> in the United States on April 14, 2010. In the episode, <a href="Tom_Cruise" title="wikilink">Tom Cruise</a> and all other celebrities who have been mocked by residents of South Park in the past plan to file a <a href="class_action" title="wikilink">class action</a> lawsuit against the town, but Cruise promises to end the lawsuit if the town can get the <a href="Muslim" class="uri" title="wikilink">Muslim</a> prophet <a href="Muhammad" class="uri" title="wikilink">Muhammad</a> to meet him.</p>
<p>The episode was written and directed by series co-creator <a href="Trey_Parker" title="wikilink">Trey Parker</a>, and was rated <a href="TV-MA" class="uri" title="wikilink">TV-MA</a> L in the United States. To celebrate their landmark episode, Parker and fellow series co-creator <a href="Matt_Stone" title="wikilink">Matt Stone</a> combined many of <em>South Park</em>{{'s}} past storylines and controversies. The Muhammad subplot, similar to the one previously featured in the <a href="South_Park_(season_10)" title="wikilink">season 10</a> episode &quot;<a href="Cartoon_Wars_Part_II" title="wikilink">Cartoon Wars</a>&quot;, refers to Comedy Central's past refusal to allow images of Muhammad to be shown on the network in response to the riots and threats generated from controversial cartoons in <a href="Jyllands-Posten_Muhammad_cartoons_controversy" title="wikilink">2005</a> and <a href="Lars_Vilks_Muhammad_drawings_controversy" title="wikilink">2007</a> of Muhammad in European newspapers.</p>
<p>&quot;200&quot; includes many celebrities that have been mocked in previous episodes, including Cruise, <a href="Rob_Reiner" title="wikilink">Rob Reiner</a>, <a href="Steven_Spielberg" title="wikilink">Steven Spielberg</a>, <a href="Kanye_West" title="wikilink">Kanye West</a>, <a href="Paris_Hilton" title="wikilink">Paris Hilton</a>, <a href="George_Lucas" title="wikilink">George Lucas</a> and <a href="Mel_Gibson" title="wikilink">Mel Gibson</a>. An additional subplot includes Cartman learning he may not know the true identity of his father. It is said in the <a href="South_Park_(season_2)" title="wikilink">season 2</a> episode &quot;<a href="Cartman&#39;s_Mom_Is_Still_a_Dirty_Slut" title="wikilink">Cartman's Mom Is Still a Dirty Slut</a>&quot; that Cartman's <a href="hermaphrodite" class="uri" title="wikilink">hermaphrodite</a> <a href="Liane_Cartman" title="wikilink">mother</a> is his father, but the events of &quot;200&quot; and <a href="201_(South_Park)" title="wikilink">the subsequent episode</a> reveal that this is not the case.</p>
<p>&quot;200&quot; received mostly positive reviews. According to <a href="Nielsen_ratings" title="wikilink">Nielsen Media Research</a>, the episode was seen by 3.33 million viewers, making it the most watched cable television program of the night. Both &quot;200&quot; and the sequel episode &quot;<a href="201_(South_Park)" title="wikilink">201</a>&quot; were nominated for the <a href="Primetime_Emmy_Award" title="wikilink">Primetime Emmy Award</a> for Outstanding Animated Program in 2010.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> Within a week of the episode's original broadcast date, the website for the radical Muslim organization <a href="Revolution_Muslim" title="wikilink">Revolution Muslim</a> posted an entry warning Parker and Stone they risked getting murdered for airing the episode, which several media outlets and observers interpreted as a threat. As a result, Comedy Central heavily censored portions of &quot;201&quot; by removing images and references to Muhammad.</p>
<h2 id="plot">Plot</h2>
<p>While on a school <a href="field_trip" title="wikilink">field trip</a> to a <a href="candy" class="uri" title="wikilink">candy</a> factory, <a href="Butters_Stotch" title="wikilink">Butters</a> spots actor <a href="Tom_Cruise" title="wikilink">Tom Cruise</a> working there, packing <a href="fudge" class="uri" title="wikilink">fudge</a> into boxes. <a href="Stan_Marsh" title="wikilink">Stan</a>, who previously told Cruise that his acting is not as good as others' in &quot;<a href="Trapped_in_the_Closet_(South_Park)" title="wikilink">Trapped in the Closet</a>&quot;, accidentally insults him again by calling him a &quot;<a href=":wikt:fudge_packer" title="wikilink">fudge packer</a>&quot;, as Cruise claims to be <a href="fly_fishing" title="wikilink">fly fishing</a>. Cruise then recruits 200 other celebrities who have been ridiculed by the town of South Park to bring a <a href="class_action" title="wikilink">class action</a> lawsuit against the town. Stan returns to the factory with his <a href="Randy_and_Sharon_Marsh" title="wikilink">dad</a> to try to apologize and convince Cruise to drop the suit, but also finds it difficult not to call him a fudge packer as well since he was literally packing fudge while they spoke. An angry Cruise agrees to do so, but only if they can help Cruise meet <a href="Muhammad" class="uri" title="wikilink">Muhammad</a>. This causes an uproar because <a href="depictions_of_Muhammad" title="wikilink">depictions of Muhammad</a> are forbidden, and the townsfolk fear that forcing Muhammad to appear in public will drive <a href="Islamic_terrorism" title="wikilink">Muslim radicals</a> to bomb the town. Stan and Kyle go to the <a href="Super_Best_Friends" title="wikilink">Super Best Friends</a>, a squad of superhero-like religious figures of which Muhammad is a member, to request he return with them to South Park. Meanwhile, it is revealed that Cruise and the other celebrities only want Muhammad for his &quot;goo&quot;, as Rob Reiner, previously shown to be filled with &quot;goo&quot; in &quot;<a href="Butt_Out" title="wikilink">Butt Out</a>&quot;, has invented a machine to transfer Muhammad's &quot;goo&quot; to the celebrities, which they believe will make them immune to ridicule, just like Muhammad.</p>
<p>By this time, <a href="Eric_Cartman" title="wikilink">Cartman</a> arrives with &quot;Mitch Connor&quot;, a face painted on Cartman's hand as one-half of a <a href="ventriloquism" title="wikilink">ventriloquist act</a>. Previously, Connor had <a href="Fat_Butt_and_Pancake_Head" title="wikilink">successfully impersonated</a> actress <a href="Jennifer_Lopez" title="wikilink">Jennifer Lopez</a>, and now Cartman and Connor return to the Lopez imitation in order to get involved in the lawsuit along with the other celebrities. Connor soon secretly convinces Cartman that they should steal Muhammad's goo for themselves to sell on the black market for more than the lawsuit could offer. Meanwhile, Kyle and Stan convince the Super Best Friends to let Muhammad come to town, but only if he stays in the back of a <a href="U-Haul" class="uri" title="wikilink">U-Haul</a> truck and is not seen. When the townspeople realize they must bring Muhammad to Cruise's limo, they allegedly put him inside a bear mascot outfit. South Park is about to give Muhammad to the celebrities when the exchange is interrupted by a bomb planted by the <a href="Ginger_Kids" title="wikilink">Ginger Separatist Movement</a>, a group of fair-skinned, red-haired children who are tired of being made fun of for their physical appearance. The Gingers want Muhammad for themselves, hoping to use his goo for their own means. They threaten to blow up the town if Muhammad is not turned over to them.</p>
<p>The people of South Park decide to turn Muhammad over to the Gingers, fearing the violence that will befall their town if they do not. The celebrities are angered by this change in events, but refuse to resort to violence for fear of ruining their careers. Instead, the celebrities decide to awaken the rebuilt <a href="Mecha-Streisand" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mecha-Streisand</a>, a giant mechanical monster form of <a href="Barbra_Streisand" title="wikilink">Barbra Streisand</a>, who previously terrorized the town of South Park before being destroyed. The celebrities hope to use Mecha-Streisand to force South Park to accept their demands. Meanwhile, due to the chain of events, Cartman decides Connor's scheme has become too complicated and tries to quit, but Connor convinces him to stay involved by revealing that the townspeople of South Park have lied to Cartman about his true father. Although they previously claimed his <a href="hermaphrodite" title="wikilink">hermaphroditic</a> <a href="Liane_Cartman" title="wikilink">mother</a> was also his father, Connor insists this is a lie. Cartman confronts his school teacher <a href="Mr._Garrison" title="wikilink">Mr. Garrison</a> and Garrison's old hand puppet <a href="Mr._Hat" title="wikilink">Mr. Hat</a>, who admits to Cartman there was indeed a cover-up. Mecha-Streisand roars threateningly and continues her reign of destruction. The episode ends on that <a href="cliffhanger" class="uri" title="wikilink">cliffhanger</a> note.</p>

This is based on two past controversies in 2005 (<a href="Jyllands-Posten_Muhammad_cartoons_controversy" title="wikilink">Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy</a>) and 2007 (<a href="Lars_Vilks_Muhammad_drawings_controversy" title="wikilink">Lars Vilks Muhammad drawings controversy</a>), when European newspapers published cartoons of Muhammad, which was responded with reactions of violent riots, global protests and death threats toward the artists. As a result of those incidents, many publications and television studios have refused to broadcast images of Muhammad whatsoever, which was the inspiration behind Tom Cruise's efforts to harvest Muhammad's apparent immunity to satire and ridicule.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a><a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a><a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> Parker and Stone addressed the Muhammad issue in their two-part <a href="South_Park_(season_10)" title="wikilink">tenth season</a> episode &quot;<a href="Cartoon_Wars_Part_II" title="wikilink">Cartoon Wars</a>&quot;, during which they attempt to show an image of the prophet, only to reveal that Comedy Central has forbidden any such image from being broadcast on their network. However, Muhammad had already been featured on-screen in the <a href="South_Park_(season_5)" title="wikilink">fifth season</a> episode &quot;<a href="Super_Best_Friends" title="wikilink">Super Best Friends</a>&quot;, in which he is among a band of religious figures modeled after the superheroes in the <em><a href="Super_Friends" title="wikilink">Super Friends</a></em> cartoons from the 1970s and 1980s. (The Super Best Friends are featured once again in &quot;200&quot;.) The episode &quot;Super Best Friends&quot; aired in 2001, before the Jyllands-Posten and Vilks controversies. Stan makes reference to that past use of Muhammad's image in &quot;200&quot; by saying of Muhammad, &quot;I saw him once...a while ago...&quot;<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a><a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> This reference was purposely included to reflect the irony that an image that was previously not a problem had suddenly become an issue due to new circumstances. Stone said, &quot;Something that was OK is now not OK, and that's just fucked up.&quot;<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> The &quot;Super Best Friends&quot; episode continues to be run uncensored by Comedy Central in repeats, even though new images of Muhammad remained prohibited.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>
<p>Additionally, Muhammad has long been featured as one of the many characters shown in an image of dozens of South Park residents during the show's opening credits. That image, however, has gone largely unnoticed, and thus has not drawn much controversy.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> When asked whether they feared retribution for mocking Muhammad, Parker said, &quot;We'd be so hypocritical against our own thoughts, if we said, 'Okay, well let's not make fun of them because they might hurt us.

<p>The <a href="Council_on_American-Islamic_Relations" title="wikilink">Council on American-Islamic Relations</a>, a Washington, D.C.-based civil rights and advocacy group, said they were aware of the depiction of Muhammad in &quot;200&quot;, but declined to put out a formal statement about it because they did not want to draw any more attention to the show.

<h3 id="revolution-muslim-entry">Revolution Muslim entry</h3>

<p>The website for the organization <a href="Revolution_Muslim" title="wikilink">Revolution Muslim</a>, a New York-based radical Muslim organization, posted an entry that included a warning to creators Parker and Stone that they risk violent retribution for their <a href="depictions_of_Muhammad" title="wikilink">depictions of Muhammad</a>. It said that they &quot;will probably wind up like Theo van Gogh for airing this show.&quot; Filmmaker <a href="Theo_van_Gogh_(film_director)" title="wikilink">Theo van Gogh</a> was murdered by an Islamic extremist in 2004 for making a short documentary on violence against women in some Islamic societies. The posting provided the addresses to Comedy Central in New York and the production company in Los Angeles. The author of the post, <a href="Zachary_Adam_Chesser" title="wikilink">Zachary Adam Chesser</a> (who prefers to be called Abu Talhah al Amrikee),<a href="#fn170" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref170"><sup>170</sup></a> said it was meant to serve as a warning to Parker and Stone, not a threat, and that providing the addresses was meant to give people the opportunity to protest.</p>
<p>The entry included audio clips of a sermon by radical al-Qaeda imam <a href="Anwar_al-Awlaki" title="wikilink">Anwar al-Awlaki</a>, calling for the assassination of anyone who has &quot;defamed&quot; Muhammad, saying, &quot;Harming Allah and his messenger is a reason to encourage Muslims to kill whoever does that.&quot;<a href="#fn171" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref171"><sup>171</sup></a><a href="#fn172" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref172"><sup>172</sup></a> It also included a link to a 2009 <em><a href="Huffington_Post" title="wikilink">Huffington Post</a></em> article that gave details of Stone and Parker's mansion in Colorado,<a href="#fn173" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref173"><sup>173</sup></a> and images of <a href="Ayaan_Hirsi_Ali" title="wikilink">Ayaan Hirsi Ali</a>, an activist writer and critic of Islam, who lives in permanent security protection because of threats.<a href="#fn174" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref174"><sup>174</sup></a> Comedy Central declined to comment on the post.<a href="#fn175" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref175"><sup>175</sup></a> Before writing the Revolution Muslim post, Chesser wrote an April 15 entry on his <a href="Twitter" class="uri" title="wikilink">Twitter</a> page: &quot;May Allah kill Matt Stone and Trey Parker and burn them in Hell for all eternity.

<p>Despite Chesser's claims that the website entry was a warning, several media outlets and observers interpreted it as a threat.<a href="#fn177" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref177"><sup>177</sup></a><a href="#fn178" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref178"><sup>178</sup></a><a href="#fn179" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref179"><sup>179</sup></a> Ayaan Hirsi Ali dismissed claims that the website entry was just a warning, calling it &quot;an assault on the freedom of expression&quot; that should not be marginalized or overlooked. She said of the episode, &quot;The 'South Park' episode of last weekend was not just funny, and it wasn't just witty. [It] addressed an essential piece in the times that we are living. There is one group of people, one religion[,] that is claiming to be above criticism.&quot;<a href="#fn180" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref180"><sup>180</sup></a> <a href="New_York_City_Police_Commissioner" title="wikilink">New York City Police Commissioner</a> <a href="Raymond_Kelly" title="wikilink">Raymond Kelly</a> said he was aware of the website posting, but said, &quot;We don't think that this threat, as [it] is currently assessed, rises to a crime right now.&quot;<a href="#fn181" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref181"><sup>181</sup></a></p>
<p>CNN journalist <a href="Anderson_Cooper" title="wikilink">Anderson Cooper</a> said of the episode, &quot;You might not like <em>South Park</em> the cartoon. You might think it's offensive.

<p>In response to the Revolution Muslim post, the <em>South Park</em> episode &quot;<a href="201_(South_Park)" title="wikilink">201</a>&quot;, which aired the following week and concluded the unresolved storylines from &quot;200&quot;, was heavily censored by Comedy Central. The channel inserted audio bleeps over all references to Muhammad's name and other portions of dialogue, including the entirety of the ending speech by the show's main characters.<a href="#fn187" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref187"><sup>187</sup></a><a href="#fn188" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref188"><sup>188</sup></a></p>

However, &quot;The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs&quot; was shown instead. When asked about this, a spokesperson for Comedy Central Netherlands said they had reluctantly decided the episode to be pulled,<a href="#fn189" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref189"><sup>189</sup></a> along with the episode &quot;201&quot;.<a href="#fn190" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref190"><sup>190</sup></a> Neither episode is available on the Dutch South Park Studios website; the same applies to the German website as of May 9, 2010.<a href="#fn191" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref191"><sup>191</sup></a><a href="#fn192" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref192"><sup>192</sup></a> The Swedish affiliate of Comedy Central also refused to broadcast &quot;200&quot; and &quot;201&quot; in Sweden:<a href="#fn193" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref193"><sup>193</sup></a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Comedy Central has decided not to air these two episodes of South Park. It is a decision we've made with great reluctance. Comedy Central believes strongly in creative freedom of expression; when unique and deeply insightful creative talents like those behind South Park are able to express themselves freely, we all benefit. However, the safety of our employees is our unquestioned number[-]one priority, and therefore we have decided to take these precautionary measures.</p>

<p>On May 1, 18 days after the episode's original airdate, a failed <a href="car_bomb" title="wikilink">car bomb</a> attempt was discovered by the <a href="New_York_City_Police_Department" title="wikilink">New York City Police Department</a> near the eastern corner of <a href="1_Astor_Plaza" title="wikilink">1 Astor Plaza</a> in New York City, on West 45 Street, on a side street near the world headquarters of <a href="Viacom" class="uri" title="wikilink">Viacom</a> (Comedy Central's parent company) are housed.

But he said of the failed car bomb, &quot;What do you think, I commanded somebody to blow up a building in the middle of Times Square? [...] It had nothing to do with the 'South Park' controversy.
