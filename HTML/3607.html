<p><strong>Hurricane Ginger</strong> was the <a href="List_of_Atlantic_hurricane_records" title="wikilink">second-longest lasting</a> <a href="Atlantic_hurricane" title="wikilink">Atlantic hurricane</a> on record. The eighth <a href="tropical_cyclone" title="wikilink">tropical cyclone</a> and fifth hurricane of the <a href="1971_Atlantic_hurricane_season" title="wikilink">1971 Atlantic hurricane season</a>, Ginger spent 27.25 days as a tropical cyclone, lasting from September 6 to October 3. The storm formed northeast of the Bahamas, and for the first nine days of its duration tracked generally eastward or northeastward while gradually strengthening to peak winds of 110 mph (175 km/h). On September 14, Ginger slowed and turned to a general westward track, passing near <a href="Bermuda" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bermuda</a> on September 23. There, the hurricane produced gusty winds and high waves, but no damage.</p>
<p>While over the western <a href="Atlantic_Ocean" title="wikilink">Atlantic Ocean</a>, Ginger became the last target of <a href="Project_Stormfury" title="wikilink">Project Stormfury</a>, which sought to weaken hurricanes by depositing <a href="silver_iodide" title="wikilink">silver iodide</a> into tropical cyclone <a href="rainband" title="wikilink">rainbands</a>. Ginger ultimately struck <a href="North_Carolina" title="wikilink">North Carolina</a> on September 30 as a minimal hurricane, lashing the coastline with gusty winds that caused power outages across the region. Heavy rainfall flooded towns and left severe crop damage, with 3 million <a href="bushel" title="wikilink">bushels</a> of corn and 1 million bushels of <a href="soybean" class="uri" title="wikilink">soybean</a> lost. Damage in the state was estimated at $10 million (1971 <a href="United_States_dollar" title="wikilink">USD</a>, $ {{#time:Y}} USD). Further north, moderate precipitation and winds spread through the <a href="Mid-Atlantic_states" title="wikilink">Mid-Atlantic states</a>, although no significant damage was reported outside of North Carolina.</p>

<p><img src="Ginger_1971_track.png" title="fig:Path of Hurricane Ginger, beginning near the Bahamas, extending out to the middle Atlantic Ocean, and curving back to hit the United States" alt="Path of Hurricane Ginger, beginning near the Bahamas, extending out to the middle Atlantic Ocean, and curving back to hit the United States" /> Hurricane Ginger originated in a <a href="cold-core_low" title="wikilink">cold-core upper-level low</a> that persisted for several days in early September in the western Atlantic Ocean.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> The upper-level low was located within a large, persistent area of <a href="convection_(meteorology)" title="wikilink">convection</a> from the <a href="Gulf_of_Mexico" title="wikilink">Gulf of Mexico</a> through the central Atlantic, which resembled the <a href="Intertropical_Convergence_Zone" title="wikilink">Intertropical Convergence Zone</a> but at a higher latitude. The convective feature was influenced by an <a href="anticyclone" class="uri" title="wikilink">anticyclone</a> located over northern <a href="South_America" title="wikilink">South America</a>, which was opposite of the typical flow for September. The weather pattern also led to the formation of <a href="Hurricane_Fern_(1971)" title="wikilink">Hurricane Fern</a>, <a href="Tropical_Storm_Heidi_(1971)" title="wikilink">Tropical Storm Heidi</a>, and two tropical depressions.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> By September 5, the low had descended to the surface as its thermal structure warmed, and the next day it developed into a tropical depression about 235 mi (375 km) northeast of the <a href="Bahamas" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bahamas</a>.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>After forming, the depression moved slowly southeastward for about 24 hours before turning to the northeast, slowly organizing in the process. On September 10, the depression turned eastward, and later that day intensified into Tropical Storm Ginger, the seventh <a href="tropical_cyclone_naming" title="wikilink">named storm</a> of the year, about 325 mi (525 ki) south of Bermuda. The storm quickly intensified, and within 24 hours reached winds of 75 mph (120 km/h), making it a hurricane. It turned to the northeast, passing well to the east of Bermuda. Late on September 13, Ginger attained its minimum <a href="atmospheric_pressure" title="wikilink">barometric pressure</a> of 959 <a href="bar_(unit)" title="wikilink">mbar</a> (28.32 <a href="Inch_of_Mercury" title="wikilink">inHg</a>), and early the next day reached peak <a href="maximum_sustained_wind" title="wikilink">maximum sustained winds</a> of 110 mph (175 km/h). After reaching a position about halfway between Bermuda and the <a href="Azores" class="uri" title="wikilink">Azores</a>, the hurricane's eastward movement halted due to a building <a href="ridge_(meteorology)" title="wikilink">ridge</a> to its north and east. It turned sharply southward before turning and beginning a westerly drift, during which Ginger weakened to minimal hurricane status.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p><img src="Ginger_9-27.PNG" title="fig:Hurricane Ginger southeast of the United States on September 27" alt="Hurricane Ginger southeast of the United States on September 27" /> For about six days, Ginger maintained minimal hurricane status. As it meandered over the central Atlantic Ocean, it maintained an unusually large <a href="eye_(cyclone)" title="wikilink">eye</a>, reaching 80 mi (130 km) in diameter.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> On September 18, Ginger turned to the south and slowly executed a tight counterclockwise loop within three days. By September 21, the hurricane was tracking south of due west, and the next day suddenly intensified to winds of 90 mph (150 km/h). Its westward track briefly posed a threat to Bermuda, although Ginger passed 115 mi (185 km) south of the island on September 23 while slowly weakening. On September 24, Ginger decelerated before beginning a turn to the southwest. By September 26, Ginger briefly weakened to minimal hurricane strength, although re-intensification resumed as the track turned to the west and northwest.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> Around that time, Ginger absorbed the smaller and weaker Tropical Storm Janice to its southeast.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p>For three days, beginning on September 26, the <a href="National_Oceanic_and_Atmospheric_Administration" title="wikilink">National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration</a> deployed planes into the hurricane as part of <a href="Project_Stormfury" title="wikilink">Project Stormfury</a>, the fourth hurricane to be a part of the <a href="weather_control" title="wikilink">weather control</a> experiment.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> The plane dropped <a href="silver_iodide" title="wikilink">silver iodide</a> into the center of the hurricane, although there was no effect due to Ginger's large eye and diffuse nature; this was the last seeding done by the project.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> By September 28, Ginger was moving northwestward toward North Carolina and was steadily intensifying. At around 06:00 <a href="Coordinated_Universal_Time" title="wikilink">UTC</a> the next day, the hurricane reached a secondary peak intensity of 105 mph (165 km/h), which it maintained for about 18 hours. Afterward, Ginger slowly weakened, and late on September 30 it made <a href="landfall_(meteorology)" title="wikilink">landfall</a> near <a href="Morehead_City,_North_Carolina" title="wikilink">Morehead City, North Carolina</a>, with winds of 75 mph (120 km/h). It quickly deteriorated over land, weakening first to a tropical storm and then to a tropical depression by late on October 1. Ginger turned to the north, entered southern Virginia, and later turned to the east. On October 3, it transitioned into an <a href="extratropical_cyclone" title="wikilink">extratropical cyclone</a> while crossing <a href="Hampton_Roads" title="wikilink">Hampton Roads</a> into the Atlantic Ocean. The remnants of Ginger continued east-southeastward until being absorbed by a <a href="cold_front" title="wikilink">cold front</a> on October 5.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="preparations">Preparations</h2>
<p>The threat of the hurricane in Bermuda prompted the British <a href="Royal_Navy" title="wikilink">Royal Navy</a> to evacuate a ship, and also resulted in two cruise ships leaving early.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> The United States military also evacuated some planes and secured the units that remained. Officials closed all of the island's schools during Ginger's passage.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<p>Before Ginger struck North Carolina, the <a href="American_Red_Cross" title="wikilink">American Red Cross</a> set up 28 emergency shelters in six counties, where about 5,500 people stayed during the storm.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a><a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> The National Hurricane Center issued a <a href="tropical_cyclone_warnings_and_watches" title="wikilink">hurricane watch</a> from <a href="Wilmington,_North_Carolina" title="wikilink">Wilmington, North Carolina</a>, to <a href="Virginia_Beach,_Virginia" title="wikilink">Virginia Beach, Virginia</a>, with gale warnings extending northward to <a href="Rehoboth_Beach,_Delaware" title="wikilink">Rehoboth Beach, Delaware</a>.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> United States military officials evacuated planes and ships from the <a href="Norfolk,_Virginia" title="wikilink">Norfolk, Virginia</a>, region, in addition to flying planes down the coast to warn boaters of the approaching storm.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> Ferry services around the <a href="Outer_Banks" title="wikilink">Outer Banks</a> were canceled during the storm's passage, while the Coast Guard ordered the evacuation of workers in three lighthouses.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="impact">Impact</h2>
<p><img src="Ginger1971filledrainblk.gif" title="fig:Rainfall from Ginger" alt="Rainfall from Ginger" width="250" /> As the hurricane passed south of Bermuda on September 23, it produced heavy waves, as well as <a href="gale" class="uri" title="wikilink">gale</a> force winds for 17 hours. The <a href="Kindley_Air_Force_Base" title="wikilink">Kindley Air Force Base</a> reported peak gusts of 75 mph (120 km/h).<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a><a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> There was no reported damage, and the hurricane's passage failed to alleviate persistent drought conditions.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>
<p>While Ginger was still in the vicinity of Bermuda, it produced high swells and riptides along the <a href="East_Coast_of_the_United_States" title="wikilink">East Coast of the United States</a>, prompting the issuing of small craft warnings from Florida to North Carolina.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> Wave heights reached  in <a href="Sebastian,_Florida" title="wikilink">Sebastian, Florida</a>,<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> and one person was killed in <a href="St._Augustine,_Florida" title="wikilink">St. Augustine</a> from drowning.

<p>Further inland, the combination of strong winds and rains left heavy crop damage,<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> destroying 3 million bushels of corn and another million bushels of soybeans; losses to the corn crop were mitigated due to about about half of the crop having been harvested before the storm's arrival. Heavy damage was also reported to the peanut crop as well as to various fruits and vegetables.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> In some locations, up to 15% of the cotton crop was lost, particularly in the northeastern portion of the state.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> In <a href="List_of_counties_in_North_Carolina" title="wikilink">45 counties</a> in the eastern portion of the state, farmers affected by the hurricane were eligible for loans from the <a href="Farmers_Home_Administration" title="wikilink">Farmers Home Administration</a>, following federal approval from <a href="President_of_the_United_States" title="wikilink">President</a> <a href="Richard_Nixon" title="wikilink">Richard Nixon</a>.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> Governor <a href="Robert_W._Scott" title="wikilink">Robert W.

<h2 id="record-longevity">Record longevity</h2>
<p>Hurricane Ginger formed on September 6 and lasted until October 3, for a total of 27.25 days. Its duration surpassed that of <a href="Hurricane_Inga_(1969)" title="wikilink">Hurricane Inga</a> in 1969, which was the previous record-holder, by three days.<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a> In 2003, it was discovered that the <a href="1899_San_Ciriaco_hurricane" title="wikilink">1899 San Ciriaco hurricane</a> lasted as a tropical cyclone longer than Ginger, although its duration as a tropical cyclone was not continuous. This made Ginger the second longest-lived of any Atlantic hurricane, but it remains the storm that lasted the most consecutive days as a tropical cyclone in the basin.</p>
<p>Ginger spent 20 days as a hurricane from September 11 to September 30, one of the longest durations on record at that intensity. In addition, Ginger co-existed with several other tropical cyclones, including on September 11 when there were four named storms at the same time, a rare occurrence; the others were <a href="Hurricane_Edith_(1971)" title="wikilink">Hurricane Edith</a>, Hurricane Fern, and Tropical Storm Heidi.</p>
