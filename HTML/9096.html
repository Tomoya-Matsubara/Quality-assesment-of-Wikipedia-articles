<p><strong>Sir Walter Raleigh</strong><a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> (c. 1552 &lt;U+2013&gt; 29 October 1618) was a <a href="English_people" title="wikilink">English</a> aristocrat, writer, <a href="poet" class="uri" title="wikilink">poet</a>, <a href="soldier" class="uri" title="wikilink">soldier</a>, <a href="courtier" class="uri" title="wikilink">courtier</a>, and <a href="explorer" class="uri" title="wikilink">explorer</a>.</p>
<p>Raleigh was born to a <a href="Protestant" class="uri" title="wikilink">Protestant</a> family in <a href="Devon" class="uri" title="wikilink">Devon</a>, the son of Walter Raleigh and Catherine Champernowne. Little is known for certain of his early life, though he spent some time in <a href="Ireland" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ireland</a>, in <a href="Killua_Castle" title="wikilink">Killua Castle</a>, <a href="Clonmellon" class="uri" title="wikilink">Clonmellon</a>, <a href="County_Westmeath" title="wikilink">County Westmeath</a>, taking part in the suppression of rebellions and participating in two infamous massacres at <a href="Rathlin_Island" title="wikilink">Rathlin Island</a> and <a href="Smerwick" class="uri" title="wikilink">Smerwick</a>, later becoming a landlord of lands confiscated from the <a href="Irish_people" title="wikilink">Irish</a>. He rose rapidly in <a href="Elizabeth_I_of_England" title="wikilink">Queen Elizabeth I</a>'s favour, being <a href="knight" title="wikilink">knighted</a> in 1585, and was involved in the early English colonisation of the <a href="New_World" title="wikilink">New World</a> in <a href="Virginia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Virginia</a> under a <a href="letters_patent" title="wikilink">royal patent</a>. In 1591 he secretly married <a href="Elizabeth_Throckmorton" title="wikilink">Elizabeth Throckmorton</a>, one of the Queen's <a href="ladies-in-waiting" class="uri" title="wikilink">ladies-in-waiting</a>, without requesting the Queen's permission, for which he and his wife were sent to the <a href="Tower_of_London" title="wikilink">Tower of London</a>. After his release, they retired to his estate at <a href="Sherborne" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sherborne</a>, <a href="Dorset" class="uri" title="wikilink">Dorset</a>.</p>
<p>In 1594 Raleigh heard of a &quot;City of Gold&quot; in <a href="South_America" title="wikilink">South America</a> and sailed to find it, publishing an exaggerated account of his experiences in a book that contributed to the legend of <a href="El_Dorado" title="wikilink">El Dorado</a>. After Queen Elizabeth died in 1603, Raleigh was again imprisoned in the Tower, this time for allegedly being involved in the <a href="Main_Plot" title="wikilink">Main Plot</a> against <a href="James_I_of_England" title="wikilink">King James I</a>, who was not favourably disposed toward him. In 1616, however, he was released in order to conduct a second expedition in search of El Dorado. This was unsuccessful and the <a href="Spain" title="wikilink">Spanish</a> outpost at San Thom&lt;U+00E9&gt; was ransacked by men under his command. After his return to England he was arrested and, after a show trial held mainly to appease the Spanish after Raleigh's attack of San Thom&lt;U+00E9&gt;, he was <a href="decapitation" title="wikilink">beheaded</a> at <a href="Palace_of_Whitehall" title="wikilink">Whitehall</a>.</p>

<p><img src="Millais_Boyhood_of_Raleigh.jpg" title="fig:John Everett Millais, The Boyhood of Raleigh (1871)" alt="John Everett Millais, The Boyhood of Raleigh (1871)" /> Little is known about Raleigh's birth. Some historians believe Raleigh was born in 1552, while others guess as late as 1554. He grew up in the house of Hayes Barton, a farmer, in the village of <a href="East_Budleigh" title="wikilink">East Budleigh</a>, not far from <a href="Budleigh_Salterton" title="wikilink">Budleigh Salterton</a> in <a href="Devon,_England" title="wikilink">Devon, England</a>. He was the youngest of five sons born to Catherine Champernowne in two successive marriages. His <a href="Sibling" title="wikilink">half brothers</a>, John Gilbert, <a href="Humphrey_Gilbert" title="wikilink">Humphrey Gilbert</a>, Adrian Gilbert, and full brother Carew Raleigh were also prominent during the reigns of Elizabeth I and James I. Catherine Champernowne was a niece of <a href="Katherine_Champernowne" title="wikilink">Kat Ashley</a>, Elizabeth's governess, who introduced the young men at court. (Ronald, p. 249).</p>
<p>Raleigh's family was strongly Protestant in religious orientation and experienced a number of near-escapes during the reign of the Catholic Queen <a href="Mary_I_of_England" title="wikilink">Mary I of England</a>. In the most notable of these, Raleigh's father had to hide in a tower to avoid execution. As a result, during his childhood, Raleigh developed a hatred of <a href="Catholicism" class="uri" title="wikilink">Catholicism</a> and proved himself quick to express it after the Protestant Queen Elizabeth I of England came to the throne in 1558.</p>
<p>In 1568 or 1572, Raleigh was registered as an undergraduate at <a href="Oriel_College,_Oxford" title="wikilink">Oriel College, Oxford</a>, but does not seem to have taken up residence, and, in 1575, he was registered at the <a href="Middle_Temple" title="wikilink">Middle Temple</a>. His life between these two dates is uncertain, but, from a reference in his <em>History of the World</em>, he seems to have served with the <a href="Huguenot" title="wikilink">French Huguenots</a> at the <a href="Battle_of_Jarnac" title="wikilink">Battle of Jarnac</a>, 13 March 1569. At his trial in 1603, he stated that he had never studied law.</p>
<h2 id="ireland">Ireland</h2>
<p>Between 1579 and 1583, Raleigh took part in the suppression of the <a href="Desmond_Rebellions" title="wikilink">Desmond Rebellions</a>. He was present at the siege of Smerwick, where he oversaw the slaughter of Italian and Spanish soldiers after they had surrendered.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> Upon the seizure and distribution of land following the attainders arising from the rebellion, Raleigh received 40,000 acres (160 km&lt;U+00B2&gt;), including the coastal walled towns of <a href="Youghal" class="uri" title="wikilink">Youghal</a> and <a href="Lismore,_County_Waterford" title="wikilink">Lismore</a>. This made him one of the principal landowners in <a href="Munster" class="uri" title="wikilink">Munster</a>, but he enjoyed limited success in inducing English tenants to settle on his <a href="Plantations_of_Ireland" title="wikilink">estates</a>. <a href="Image:Walter.Raleigh.seal.of.office.jpg" title="wikilink">thumb|right|px=200|Sir Walter Raleigh's Seal of Office</a></p>
<p>During his seventeen years as an Irish landlord, frequently domiciling at Killulagh Castle, Clonmellon, county Westmeath, Raleigh made the town of Youghal his occasional home, where he was mayor from 1588 to 1589. He is credited with having planted the first <a href="potato" title="wikilink">potatoes</a> in Ireland , but it is far more likely that the plant arrived in Ireland through trade with the Spanish. His town mansion, Myrtle Grove, is assumed to be the setting for the story that his servant doused him with a bucket of water after seeing clouds of smoke coming from Raleigh's pipe, in the belief he had been set alight. But this story is also told of other places related to Raleigh: the Virginia Ash inn in Henstridge near Sherborne, <a href="Sherborne_Castle" title="wikilink">Sherborne Castle</a>, and <a href="South_Wraxall_Manor" title="wikilink">South Wraxall Manor</a> in <a href="Wiltshire" class="uri" title="wikilink">Wiltshire</a>, home of Raleigh's friend, <a href="Sir_Walter_Long_(1565&lt;U+2013&gt;1610)" title="wikilink">Sir Walter Long</a>.</p>
<p>Amongst Raleigh's acquaintances in Munster was another Englishman who had been granted land there, the poet <a href="Edmund_Spenser" title="wikilink">Edmund Spenser</a>. In the 1590s, he and Raleigh travelled together from Ireland to the court at London, where Spenser presented part of his allegorical poem, the <em><a href="Faerie_Queene" title="wikilink">Faerie Queene</a></em>, to Elizabeth I.</p>
<p>Raleigh's management of his Irish estates ran into difficulties, which contributed to a decline in his fortunes. In 1602, he sold the lands to <a href="Richard_Boyle,_1st_Earl_of_Cork" title="wikilink">Richard Boyle, 1st Earl of Cork</a>. Boyle subsequently prospered under kings <a href="James_I_of_England" title="wikilink">James I</a> and <a href="Charles_I_of_England" title="wikilink">Charles I</a>, such that following Raleigh's death, Raleigh family members approached Boyle for compensation on the basis that Raleigh had struck an improvident bargain.</p>

<p>Raleigh's plan in 1584 for colonization in the &quot;<a href="Colony_and_Dominion_of_Virginia" title="wikilink">Colony and Dominion of Virginia</a>&quot; (which included the present-day states of <a href="North_Carolina" title="wikilink">North Carolina</a> and <a href="Virginia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Virginia</a>) in North America ended in failure at <a href="Roanoke_Island" title="wikilink">Roanoke Island</a>, but paved the way for subsequent colonies.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> His voyages were funded primarily by himself and his friends, never providing the steady stream of <a href="revenue" class="uri" title="wikilink">revenue</a> necessary to start and maintain a colony in America. (Subsequent colonization attempts in the early 17th century were made under the <a href="Joint_stock_company" title="wikilink">joint-stock</a> <a href="Virginia_Company" title="wikilink">Virginia Company</a> which was able to pull together the capital necessary to create successful colonies.)</p>
<p>In 1587, Raleigh attempted a second <a href="expedition" class="uri" title="wikilink">expedition</a> again establishing a settlement on Roanoke Island. This time, a much more diversified group of settlers was sent, including some entire families, under the governance of <a href="John_White_(surveyor)" title="wikilink">John White</a>. After a short while in America, White was recalled to England in order to find more supplies for the colony. He was unable to return the following year as planned, however, because the Queen had ordered that all vessels remain at port in case they were needed to fight the <a href="Spanish_Armada" title="wikilink">Spanish Armada</a>. The threat of the Armada was only partially responsible for the 4 year delay of the second expedition. After England's victory over the Spanish fleet in 1588 the ships were given permission to sail. Unfortunately for the colonists at Roanoke the small fleet made an excursion towards Cuba in an attempt to capture as prizes the treasure-laden Spanish merchant ships that were reported to be proliferate in those waters at that time. White is said to have objected to this unplanned foray, but was helpless to dissuade the crews who'd been told of the enormous riches to be had by the experienced (he had previously piloted in the Americas in the service of the Spanish), Portuguese pilot hired by Raleigh to navigate the voyage. It was not until 1591 that the supply vessel arrived at the colony, 4 years later, only to find that all colonists had disappeared. The only clue to their fate was the word &quot;CROATOAN&quot; and letters &quot;CRO&quot; carved into separate tree trunks, suggesting the possibility that they were either massacred, absorbed or taken away by <a href="Croatan" title="wikilink">Croatans</a> or perhaps another native tribe. Other speculation includes their being swept away or lost at sea during the stormy weather of 1588 (credited with aiding in the defeat of the <a href="Spanish_Armada" title="wikilink">Spanish Armada</a>). However, it is worth noting that a hurricane prevented John White and the crew of the supply vessel from actually visiting Croatoan to investigate the disappearance, and no further attempts at contact were recorded for some years. Whatever the fate of the settlers, the settlement is now remembered as the <a href="Roanoke_Colony" title="wikilink">&quot;Lost Colony of Roanoke Island&quot;</a>.</p>

<h3 id="s">1580s</h3>
<p>In December 1581, Raleigh came back to England from Ireland to despatches as his company had been disbanded. He took part in Court life and became a favourite of <a href="Queen_Elizabeth_I" title="wikilink">Queen Elizabeth I</a>. The various colourful stories told about him at this period are unlikely to be literally true.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a><a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1585 he was knighted and was appointed <a href="Lord_Warden_of_the_Stannaries" title="wikilink">warden of the stannaries</a>, that is of the mines of Cornwall and Devon, <a href="Lord_Lieutenant_of_Cornwall" title="wikilink">Lord Lieutenant of Cornwall</a>, and <a href="Vice-Admiral_of_the_Coast" title="wikilink">vice-admiral</a> of the two counties. Both in 1585 and 1586 he sat in parliament as member for <a href="Devon_(UK_Parliament_constituency)" title="wikilink">Devonshire</a>.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p>Raleigh commissioned the shipbuilder R. Chapman, of <a href="Deptford" class="uri" title="wikilink">Deptford</a> to build a ship for him. Originally called <em>Ark</em>, it became <a href="HMS_Ark_Royal_(1587)" title="wikilink"><em>Ark Raleigh</em></a> following the convention at the time where the ship bore the name of its owner. The crown, in the form of <a href="Elizabeth_I_of_England" title="wikilink">Queen Elizabeth I</a>, purchased the ship from Raleigh in January 1587, for the sum of <a href="pound_sterling" title="wikilink">&lt;U+00A3&gt;</a>5,000 (although this took the form of a reduction in the sum Sir Walter owed the queen: he received <a href="Tally_stick" title="wikilink">Exchequer tallies</a>, but no money). As a result the ship was renamed <em>Ark Royal</em>.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="s-1">1590s</h3>
<p>In 1592, Raleigh was given many rewards by the Queen, including <a href="Durham_House" title="wikilink">Durham House</a> in the Strand and the estate of Sherborne, Dorset. He was appointed <a href="Captain_of_the_Yeomen_of_the_Guard" title="wikilink">Captain of the Yeomen of the Guard</a>, and as <a href="Lord_Warden_of_the_Stannaries" title="wikilink">Lord Warden of the Stannaries</a> of Devon and <a href="Cornwall" class="uri" title="wikilink">Cornwall</a>. However, he had not been given any of the <a href="Great_Offices_of_State" title="wikilink">great offices of state</a>. In the <a href="Spanish_Armada" title="wikilink">Armada</a> year of 1588 he was employed as <a href="Vice_Admiral_(United_States)" title="wikilink">Vice Admiral</a> of Devon, looking after the coastal defences and military levies.</p>
<p>In 1591, Raleigh was secretly married to <a href="Elizabeth_Raleigh" title="wikilink">Elizabeth &quot;Bess&quot; Throckmorton</a> (or Throgmorton). She was one of the Queen's <a href="lady-in-waiting" title="wikilink">ladies-in-waiting</a>, eleven years his junior, and was pregnant at the time of their marriage. She gave birth to a son, believed to be named Damerei, who was given to a <a href="wet_nurse" title="wikilink">wet nurse</a> at <a href="Durham_House" title="wikilink">Durham House</a>; the infant does not seem to have survived, and Bess resumed her duties. The following year, the unauthorized marriage was discovered and the Queen ordered Raleigh imprisoned and Bess dismissed from court. He was released from prison to divide the spoils from the captured Spanish ship <em>Madre de Dios</em> (&quot;Mother of God&quot;).</p>
<p>It would be several years before Raleigh returned to favour. The couple remained devoted to each other. During Raleigh's absences, Bess proved a capable manager of the family's fortunes and reputation. They had two more sons, Walter (known as Wat) and Carew.</p>
<p>He was elected a burgess of <a href="Mitchell_(UK_Parliament_constituency)" title="wikilink">Mitchell</a>, Cornwall, in the parliament of 1593.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p>Raleigh retired to his estate at Sherborne where he built a new house, completed in 1594, known then as Sherborne Lodge but is now extended and known as <a href="Sherborne_Castle" title="wikilink">Sherborne (new) Castle</a>. He made friends with the local <a href="gentry" class="uri" title="wikilink">gentry</a>, such as Sir Ralph Horsey of <a href="Clifton_Maybank" title="wikilink">Clifton Maybank</a> and Charles Thynne of <a href="Longleat" class="uri" title="wikilink">Longleat</a>. During this period at a dinner party at Horsey's, there was a heated discussion about religion which later gave rise to charges of <a href="atheism" class="uri" title="wikilink">atheism</a> against Raleigh. He was elected to Parliament, speaking on religious and naval matters.</p>
<p>In 1594, he came into possession of a Spanish account of a great golden city at the headwaters of the <a href="Caron&lt;U+00ED&gt;_River" title="wikilink">Caron&lt;U+00ED&gt; River</a>, and a year later he explored what is now <a href="Guayana_Region" title="wikilink">eastern Venezuela</a> in search of Manoa, the legendary city in question. Once back in England, he published <em>The Discovery of Guiana</em><a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> (1596) an account of his voyage which made exaggerated claims as to what had been discovered. The book can be seen as a contribution to the <a href="El_Dorado" title="wikilink">El Dorado</a> legend. Although Venezuela has gold deposits, there is no evidence Raleigh found any mines. He is sometimes said to have discovered <a href="Angel_Falls" title="wikilink">Angel Falls</a>, but these claims are considered far-fetched.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1596 Raleigh took part in the capture of <a href="C&lt;U+00E1&gt;diz" class="uri" title="wikilink">C&lt;U+00E1&gt;diz</a>, where he was wounded. He was also the second-in-command of the <a href="Islands_Voyage" title="wikilink">Islands Voyage</a> to the <a href="Azores" class="uri" title="wikilink">Azores</a> in 1597.</p>
<p>In 1597, he was chosen member of parliament for <a href="Dorset_(UK_Parliament_constituency)" title="wikilink">Dorset</a>, and, in 1601, for <a href="Cornwall_(UK_Parliament_constituency)" title="wikilink">Cornwall</a>.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> He was unique in the Elizabethan period in sitting for three counties.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="to-1618">1600 to 1618</h3>
<p>From 1600 to 1603, Raleigh was the Governor of the <a href="Channel_Island" title="wikilink">Channel Island</a> of <a href="Jersey" class="uri" title="wikilink">Jersey</a>, and he was responsible for modernizing the defences of the island. He named the new fortress protecting the approaches to <a href="Saint_Helier" title="wikilink">Saint Helier</a> <em>Fort Isabella Bellissima</em>, or <a href="Elizabeth_Castle" title="wikilink">Elizabeth Castle</a>. <img src="Bloodytower_interior.jpg" title="fig:Raleigh&#39;s cell, Bloody Tower, Tower of London" alt="Raleigh&#39;s cell, Bloody Tower, Tower of London" width="200" /></p>
<p>Though royal favour with Queen Elizabeth I had been restored by this time, it did not last. Elizabeth died in 1603, and Raleigh was arrested at Exeter Inn, Ashburton, Devon and imprisoned in the <a href="Tower_of_London" title="wikilink">Tower of London</a> on 19 July. Later that year, on 17 November, Raleigh was tried in the converted <a href="Great_hall" title="wikilink">Great Hall</a> of <a href="Winchester_Castle" title="wikilink">Winchester Castle</a> for <a href="treason" class="uri" title="wikilink">treason</a> due to his supposed involvement in the <a href="Main_Plot" title="wikilink">Main Plot</a> against King James. Raleigh conducted his defence with great skill, which may, in part, explain why King James spared his life, despite the guilty verdict. He was left to languish in the Tower of London until 1616. While imprisoned, he wrote many treatises and the first volume of <em>The Historie of the World</em> (London, 1628) <a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> about the ancient history of Greece and Rome. His son Carew was conceived and born while Raleigh was legally dead and imprisoned in the Tower of London (1604).</p>
<p>In 1616, Sir Walter was released from the Tower of London in order to conduct a second expedition to Venezuela in search of El Dorado. In the course of the expedition, Raleigh's men, under the command of <a href="Lawrence_Keymis" title="wikilink">Lawrence Keymis</a>, attacked the Spanish outpost of <a href="Santo_Thom&lt;U+00E9&gt;_de_Guayana" title="wikilink">Santo Thom&lt;U+00E9&gt; de Guayana</a> (San Thom&lt;U+00E9&gt;) on the <a href="Orinoco" class="uri" title="wikilink">Orinoco</a>. During the initial attack on the settlement, Raleigh's son Walter was struck by a bullet and killed. On Raleigh's return to England, the outraged <a href="Diego_Sarmiento_de_Acu&lt;U+00F1&gt;a,_conde_de_Gondomar" title="wikilink">Count Gondomar</a>, the Spanish <a href="ambassador" class="uri" title="wikilink">ambassador</a>, demanded that King James reinstate Raleigh's death sentence. The ambassador's demand was granted.</p>
<h2 id="execution-and-aftermath">Execution and aftermath</h2>
<p>Raleigh was beheaded at <a href="Palace_of_Whitehall" title="wikilink">Whitehall</a> on 29 October 1618 . &quot;Let us dispatch&quot;, he asked his executioner. &quot;At this hour my ague comes upon me. I would not have my enemies think I quaked from fear.&quot; After he was allowed to see the axe that would behead him, he mused: &quot;This is a sharp Medicine, but it is a Physician for all diseases and miseries&quot;. According to many biographers &lt;U+2014&gt; <a href="Raleigh_Trevelyan" title="wikilink">Raleigh Trevelyan</a> in his book <em>Sir Walter Raleigh</em> (2003) for instance &lt;U+2014&gt; Sir Walter's final words (as he lay ready for the axe to fall) were: &quot;Strike, man, strike!&quot;</p>
<p>The corpse was to be buried in the local church in <a href="Beddington" class="uri" title="wikilink">Beddington</a>, <a href="Surrey" class="uri" title="wikilink">Surrey</a>, the home of Lady Raleigh. &quot;The Lords&quot;, she wrote, &quot;have given me his dead body, though they have denied me his life. God hold me in my wits&quot;.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> After Raleigh's execution, his head was embalmed and presented to his wife. She died 29 years later and it was returned to Raleigh's tomb at <a href="St._Margaret&#39;s,_Westminster" title="wikilink">St. Margaret's, Westminster</a> <a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> Raleigh's body was finally laid to rest in St. Margaret's Church, where his tomb may still be visited today. <a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
<p>Although his popularity had waned considerably since his Elizabethan heyday, his execution was seen by many, both at the time and since, as unnecessary and unjust. It has been suggested that any involvement in the Main Plot appears to have been limited to a meeting with <a href="Henry_Brooke,_11th_Baron_Cobham" title="wikilink">Lord Cobham</a>. One of the judges at his trial later said: &quot;the justice of England has never been so degraded and injured as by the condemnation of the honorable Sir Walter Raleigh.&quot;<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="poetry">Poetry</h2>
<p>Raleigh is generally considered one of the foremost poets of the Elizabethan era. His poetry is generally written in the relatively straightforward, unornamented mode known as the plain style. <a href="C._S._Lewis" title="wikilink">C. S. Lewis</a> considered Raleigh one of the era's &quot;silver poets&quot;, a group of writers who resisted the <a href="Italian_Renaissance" title="wikilink">Italian Renaissance</a> influence of dense classical reference and elaborate poetic devices. In poems such as &quot;<a href="What_is_Our_Life" title="wikilink">What is Our Life</a>&quot; and &quot;<a href="The_Lie_(poem)" title="wikilink">The Lie</a>&quot; Raleigh expresses a <em>contemptus mundi</em> (contempt of the world) attitude more characteristic of <a href="Middle_Ages" title="wikilink">the Middle Ages</a> than of the dawning era of humanistic optimism. However, his lesser-known long poem &quot;<a href="The_Ocean_to_Cynthia" title="wikilink">The Ocean to Cynthia</a>&quot; combines this vein with the more elaborate conceits associated with his contemporaries Spenser and Donne, while achieving a power and originality that justifies Lewis' assessment and contradicts it by expressing a melancholy sense of history reminiscent of <em><a href="The_Tempest" title="wikilink">The Tempest</a></em> and all the more effective for being the product of personal experience. Raleigh is also Marlovian in terms of the terse line, e.g. &quot;She sleeps thy death that erst thy danger sighed&quot;.</p>
<p>A minor poem of Raleigh's captures the atmosphere of the court at the time of Queen Elizabeth I, when he wrote a reply to Marlowe's &quot;<a href="The_Passionate_Shepherd_to_His_Love" title="wikilink">The Passionate Shepherd to His Love</a>&quot;. Raleigh's response was &quot;<a href="The_Nymph&#39;s_Reply_to_the_Shepherd" title="wikilink">The Nymph's Reply to the Shepherd</a>&quot;. &quot;The Passionate Shepherd to His Love&quot; was written in 1592, while Raleigh's &quot;The Nymph's Reply to The Shepherd&quot; was written four years later. Both written in the traditional pastoral poetry, and they follow the same structure of six four-line stanzas employing a <a href="rhyme_scheme" title="wikilink">rhyme scheme</a> of <a href="Clerihew" title="wikilink">AABB</a>.</p>

<li id="fn1">Many alternate spellings of his surname exist, including <em>Rawley</em>, <em>Ralegh</em>, <em>Ralagh</em> and <em>Rawleigh</em>. &quot;Raleigh&quot; appears most commonly today, though he, himself, used that spelling only once, as far as is known. His most consistent preference was for &quot;Ralegh&quot;. His full name is correctly , though, in practice,  &quot;rally&quot; or even  &quot;rahly&quot; are the usual modern pronunciations in England.<a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-back">↩</a></li>
