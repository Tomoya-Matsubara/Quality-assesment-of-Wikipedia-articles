The progressive<a href="#fn316" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref316"><sup>316</sup></a> media criticism organization <a href="Fairness_and_Accuracy_in_Reporting" title="wikilink">FAIR</a> said that the mistake reflected a worldview in American media and a &quot;false balance&quot; between the two sides of the conflict, when in fact many more Palestinians have suffered than Israelis.<a href="#fn317" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref317"><sup>317</sup></a> Sawyer later apologized on-air for the error.<a href="#fn318" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref318"><sup>318</sup></a></p>
<p><a href="NBC_News" title="wikilink">NBC News</a> was criticized for ordering its correspondent <a href="Ayman_Mohyeldin" title="wikilink">Ayman Mohyeldin</a> out of Gaza after witnessing the killing of four Palestinian children.<a href="#fn319" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref319"><sup>319</sup></a> He was subsequently reinstated.</p>
<p>Investigative reporter <a href="Judith_Miller" title="wikilink">Judith Miller</a> criticized US media, and her former employer <em>The New York Times</em> in particular, for being unsympathetic to Israel and downplaying the context of the kidnapping and murder of Israeli teenagers.<a href="#fn320" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref320"><sup>320</sup></a></p>
<p>British MP <a href="George_Galloway" title="wikilink">George Galloway</a> said: &quot;The 300 Palestinians are completely ignored by the same newspapers, by the same television stations and by the same political leaders who are threatening sanctions and war against Russia. ...

<p>Within Israel, the newspaper <em><a href="Haaretz" class="uri" title="wikilink">Haaretz</a></em> issued an editorial stating that the &quot;soft Gaza sand... could turn into quicksand&quot; for the Israeli military and warning about the &quot;wholesale killing&quot; of Palestinian civilians.

<h3 id="criticism-of-the-bbcs-coverage">Criticism of the BBC's coverage</h3>
<p>In <em><a href="The_Guardian" title="wikilink">The Guardian</a></em>, <a href="Owen_Jones_(writer)" title="wikilink">Owen Jones</a> called the <a href="BBC" class="uri" title="wikilink">BBC</a>'s headline &quot;Israel under renewed Hamas attack&quot;, &quot;perverse as <a href="Mike_Tyson" title="wikilink">Mike Tyson</a> punching a toddler, followed by a headline claiming that the child spat at him&quot;, and that &quot;the macabre truth is that Israeli life is deemed by the Western media to be worth more than a Palestinian life&quot;.<a href="#fn323" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref323"><sup>323</sup></a></p>
<p>In London, Newcastle, Manchester, Liverpool and Glasgow, hundreds protested outside the BBC's offices accusing the corporation of &quot;pro-Israeli bias&quot; in its coverage of the ongoing conflict. It claimed that news coverage was &quot;entirely devoid of context or background&quot;. An open letter to BBC director signed by 45,000 people including <a href="Noam_Chomsky" title="wikilink">Noam Chomsky</a>, <a href="John_Pilger" title="wikilink">John Pilger</a>, <a href="Ken_Loach" title="wikilink">Ken Loach</a>, <a href="Brian_Eno" title="wikilink">Brian Eno</a> and <a href="Jeremy_Hardy" title="wikilink">Jeremy Hardy</a> said it would &quot;like to remind the BBC that Gaza is under Israeli occupation and siege [and] that Israel is bombing a refugee population&quot;.

<p>Building on research by the <a href="Glasgow_University_Media_Group" title="wikilink">Glasgow University Media Group</a> that examined the media coverage of recent Israeli attacks on Lebanon and Gaza, Greg Philo, research director of the university's media unit, described how senior BBC journalists have spoken to him about being unable to get the Palestinian viewpoint across.<a href="#fn326" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref326"><sup>326</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="social-media">Social media</h3>
<p>In the 8 days leading up to Operation Protective Edge, the social media site Twitter <a href="hashtag" class="uri" title="wikilink">hashtag</a> #GazaUnderAttack was used over 375,000 times. Often the hashtag was used on tweets using photos that claimed to show how the people are suffering due to Israeli attacks. A <a href="BBC" class="uri" title="wikilink">BBC</a> study showed that in some cases these photos were from previous Israeli attacks, or from wars in Syria and Iraq.<a href="#fn327" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref327"><sup>327</sup></a><a href="#fn328" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref328"><sup>328</sup></a></p>
<p>A false report circulated on social media and via <a href="SMS" class="uri" title="wikilink">SMS</a> that a rocket from Gaza had hit a petrochemical plant in Haifa. These reports cited <em><a href="Haaretz" class="uri" title="wikilink">Haaretz</a></em> as their source but turned out to be false. <em>Haaretz</em> denies having issued such warnings.<a href="#fn329" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref329"><sup>329</sup></a></p>
<p>A photograph published by Danish journalist Allan S&lt;U+00F8&gt;rensen on <a href="Twitter" class="uri" title="wikilink">Twitter</a> caused uproar online, gathering more than 8,500 retweets. It allegedly shows Israelis in <a href="Sderot" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sderot</a> gathered on top of a hill to celebrate and cheer as they watched Israeli airstrikes on <a href="Gaza_Strip" title="wikilink">Gaza</a>.

That campaign was launched by Israel after the disappearance of three Israeli youth, for which it blamed Hamas but presented no evidence. Hamas, meanwhile, denied the charges, and many accused Israel of blaming the group in order to have an excuse to &quot;crush&quot; the group, as senior Israel officials later demanded. Although Hamas had widely observed a ceasefire with Israel put in place in 2012, as Israel massively targeted the group across the West Bank other groups began firing rockets, with Israel bombing the Strip in near nightly raids as a result, eventually escalating into the current operation 12 days ago.'<a href="#fnref66" class="footnote-back">↩</a></li>
