<h2 id="geography">Geography</h2>
<p>Hatton is about 1 km north of <a href="Tutbury" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tutbury</a>, <a href="Staffordshire" class="uri" title="wikilink">Staffordshire</a> with the <a href="River_Dove,_Derbyshire" title="wikilink">River Dove</a> running between the two villages and creating the County boundary; the river is crossed by a listed bridge. It has a population of 2,690 and is mainly residential.</p>
<p>The village has excellent transport links. It is close to the <a href="A50_road" title="wikilink">A50 road</a> which links the <a href="M1_motorway" title="wikilink">M1</a> and <a href="M6_motorway" title="wikilink">M6</a>. The A50 used to pass across the northern edge of the village, but was bypassed in May 1995 by the 6 mile &lt;U+00A3&gt;19million Hatton, <a href="Hilton,_Derbyshire" title="wikilink">Hilton</a> and <a href="Foston,_Derbyshire" title="wikilink">Foston</a> Bypass. The former route is now the <a href="A511_road" title="wikilink">A511</a>, which passes through the village from Tutbury. <a href="Tutbury_and_Hatton_railway_station" title="wikilink">Tutbury and Hatton railway station</a> is on the <a href="Nottingham" class="uri" title="wikilink">Nottingham</a> to <a href="Crewe" class="uri" title="wikilink">Crewe</a> line. Services are provided by <a href="East_Midlands_Trains" title="wikilink">East Midlands Trains</a>. The <a href="http://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/45100">station</a> was originally closed in the Beeching cuts in the 1960s, but was re-opened in the 1980s (like other previously-closed rural stations) due to public demand. Local bus services are provided by <a href="Arriva" class="uri" title="wikilink">Arriva</a> who link Hatton with the market towns of Burton-upon-Trent and Uttoxeter, and <a href="Trent_Barton" title="wikilink">Trent Barton</a> who link with Derby and Burton-upon-Trent.</p>
<p>The village is within the district of <a href="South_Derbyshire" title="wikilink">South Derbyshire District Council</a> and County of <a href="Derbyshire" title="wikilink">Derbyshire County Council</a>. The local MP is Heather Wheeler.</p>
<h2 id="environment">Environment</h2>
<p>The land adjacent to the River Dove is home to 'Thistley Meadow'. This community nature reserve has gone from strength to strength over recent years through the dedication and hard work of local residents. From this southern part of the village there are excellent views across the river to Tutbury Castle and the long horizon beyond adds to the open panoramic views from the bridge. Towards the northern part of the village there is a good network of footpaths and bridle ways which can be used to navigate round the village or used as a link to the neighbouring villages of Hilton and Marston-on-Dove; or even further beyond into the less populated villages of South Derbyshire which link Hatton with the open farmland that reaches up towards Ashbourne and the Peak District National Park. Heathland and pasture are the dominant environmental features and this balances well with the residential and commercial aspects of the village.</p>
<h2 id="economy">Economy</h2>
<p>Local employers include <a href="Nestl&lt;U+00E9&gt;" class="uri" title="wikilink">Nestl&lt;U+00E9&gt;</a> who have a historical presence in the village due to the surrounding farmland, which supported a strong <a href="dairy_farming" title="wikilink">dairy farming</a> industry, and proximity to rail transport. Nestl&lt;U+00E9&gt;'s factory is labelled by the company as their Tutbury factory. Until the late 1970s the factory had its own private siding, which gave access to <a href="British_Railway_Milk_Tank_Wagon" title="wikilink">milk trains</a>. The factory since has developed into a major coffee producer, the sole UK facility producing the Dolce Gusto range, and also <a href="Nescaf&lt;U+00E9&gt;" class="uri" title="wikilink">Nescaf&lt;U+00E9&gt;</a>, which is also made in <a href="Hayes,_Hillingdon" title="wikilink">Hayes</a>.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>The village has a famous caf&lt;U+00E9&gt;, <em>The Salt Box</em> on the A511, which has won awards as the best <a href="Truck_stop" title="wikilink">transport caf&lt;U+00E9&gt;</a> in the UK. There is no similar truck stop on the parallel A50, hence its popularity. Opposite the cafe is the Sunar Gow, Indian restaurant and nearby is the <em>Railway Tavern</em> pub. There is a newly built <a href="Co-op_UK" title="wikilink">Co-op</a> in the village, next to the train station, as well as a Post Office, two newsagents and several other village shops and food outlets.</p>
