<p>&quot;<strong>Hungry</strong>&quot; is the third episode of the <a href="The_X-Files_(season_7)" title="wikilink">seventh season</a> of the <a href="science_fiction" title="wikilink">science fiction</a> <a href="television_series" title="wikilink">television series</a> <em><a href="The_X-Files" title="wikilink">The X-Files</a></em>. It premiered on the <a href="Fox_Broadcasting_Company" title="wikilink">Fox network</a> on November 21, 1999. It was written by <a href="Vince_Gilligan" title="wikilink">Vince Gilligan</a>, directed by <a href="Kim_Manners" title="wikilink">Kim Manners</a>, and featured a guest appearance by <a href="Chad_Donella" title="wikilink">Chad Donella</a>. The episode is a <a href="List_of_Monster-of-the-Week_characters_in_The_X-Files" title="wikilink">&quot;Monster-of-the-Week&quot;</a> story, unconnected to the series' wider <a href="Mythology_of_The_X-Files" title="wikilink">mythology</a>. However, unlike previous Monster-of-the-Week stories, &quot;Hungry&quot; is told from the monster's perspective. &quot;Hungry&quot; earned a Nielsen household rating of 9.6, being watched by 16.17 million people in its initial broadcast. The episode received mixed to positive reviews from critics.</p>
<p>The show centers on <a href="Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation" title="wikilink">FBI</a> special agents <a href="Fox_Mulder" title="wikilink">Fox Mulder</a> (<a href="David_Duchovny" title="wikilink">David Duchovny</a>) and <a href="Dana_Scully" title="wikilink">Dana Scully</a> (<a href="Gillian_Anderson" title="wikilink">Gillian Anderson</a>) who work on cases linked to the paranormal, called <a href="X-File" title="wikilink">X-Files</a>. In this episode, a fast-food employee with unusual cravings becomes the focus of an FBI investigation under the direction of Mulder and Scully. The victims appear with no brain and a suction hole in the forehead.</p>
<p>Gilligan wanted to try a &quot;different&quot; approach to <em>The X-Files</em> with &quot;Hungry&quot; by telling the main story through the eyes of the monster. Actor Chad Donella, who portrayed the monster, was chosen because he possessed a &quot;subtle, interesting quality,&quot; according to casting director Rick Millikan. Manners was pleased with Donella's performance, calling him a &quot;great little actor.&quot; Because both David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson were filming movies, <em><a href="Return_to_Me" title="wikilink">Return to Me</a></em> and <em><a href="The_House_of_Mirth" title="wikilink">The House of Mirth</a></em> respectively, the production company decided to film &quot;Hungry&quot; before any of the other episodes, despite the fact that it would be aired third, after the conclusion of &quot;<a href="The_Sixth_Extinction" title="wikilink">The Sixth Extinction</a>&quot; arc.</p>
<h2 id="plot">Plot</h2>
<p>A man approaches a Lucky Boy Burgers <a href="drive-thru" class="uri" title="wikilink">drive-thru</a>, despite it being closed, and angrily demands service. The sheepish fast food attendant tells the man to drive to the next window, where he is attacked and violently pulled out of his car. The man's body is later discovered with the brain removed from the skull in <a href="Costa_Mesa,_California" title="wikilink">Costa Mesa, California</a>, and <a href="Fox_Mulder" title="wikilink">Fox Mulder</a> (<a href="David_Duchovny" title="wikilink">David Duchovny</a>) and <a href="Dana_Scully" title="wikilink">Dana Scully</a> (<a href="Gillian_Anderson" title="wikilink">Gillian Anderson</a>) are assigned to assist the local police in their investigation.</p>
<p>The only clue found at the scene is a button from the Lucky Boy Burgers restaurant. Mulder and Scully check all of the employees and discover that one of the staff members, Derwood Spinks, is missing his button, although he claims he left it at home. He later becomes the prime suspect for the local police department and Agent Scully after it is discovered he had a previous criminal record. Agent Mulder, however, has a different theory: he believes that the victim's brain was sucked out of his head by some kind of <a href="proboscis" class="uri" title="wikilink">proboscis</a>. Mulder's suspicions fall on another employee, Rob Roberts, who was working late the night the victim died. Rob, who is actually a mutant human, needs to feed on brains in order to survive. Later that night, he is trailed by a private investigator (Steve Kiziak), who he kills and eats in order to placate his hunger.</p>
<p>Derwood Spinks visits Rob at his home, annoyed at being fired from the Lucky Boy Burgers restaurant for lying about his criminal record. He confronts Rob with evidence that he is the murderer and attempts to blackmail him, but Derwood does not realise what Rob is and falls victim to his hunger. Rob is contacted by Dr. Mindy Rinehart, hired by Lucky Boy Burgers to counsel the employees following recent events. In session with her, Rob admits that he is battling an <a href="eating_disorder" title="wikilink">eating disorder</a> and she sends him to an <a href="Overeaters_Anonymous" title="wikilink">Overeaters Anonymous</a> meeting, not fully understanding what Mulder seems to know; that Rob is a really a monster with a compulsion to feed on human brains.</p>
<p>Rob Roberts attends the OA meeting after being visited by Mulder, who clearly suspects him of being the killer. He sees his landlady Sylvia Jassy there and, though he does not respond well to the meeting, they bond on the trip home. Unfortunately, his hunger is far too overpowering and he is compelled to feed upon her. To cover up this latest murder, Roberts smashes up his own apartment, using Derwood Spinks' baseball bat. He lies to Scully and Mulder and says that Spinks showed up and told him that he was the murderer. Mulder clearly still suspects Rob Roberts but leaves to confirm a few things.</p>
<p>Dr. Rinehart shows up to find Rob Roberts packing to leave town. After a bitter argument, Rob reveals himself as the monster to Dr. Rinehart. However, before he prepares to attack her, she shows him sympathy and says, &quot;You poor man. What you must go through,&quot; throwing Rob off-guard. At that moment, Scully and Mulder arrive with guns drawn. Mulder says they found Sylvia the landlady on the way to the landfill. Dr. Rinehart tells Rob to be the good person she knows he is capable of being. Instead, Rob Roberts charges Mulder and is shot twice in the chest. He falls and lies dying. Mindy Rinehart asks him, &quot;Why?&quot; To which he replies, &quot;I can't be something I'm not.&quot;<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>

<h3 id="writing-and-casting">Writing and casting</h3>
<p>When Vince Gilligan wrote &quot;Hungry,&quot; he wanted to try a &quot;different&quot; approach to <em>The X-Files</em>. Accordingly, he decided to write an episode that featured Mulder and Scully as the antagonists, as viewed through the eyes of the monster.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> Series creator Chris Carter applauded this idea and called it a &quot;really great monster show.&quot;<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> Gilligan's intention was for the monster to resonate with the audience. He wrote the part specifically so that the monster would be relatable.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a><a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> He later said, &quot;My intention [&lt;U+2026&gt;] was that at the end, when Mulder and Scully show up and kill the monster, to have the audience out there hoping that they would not show up.&quot;<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p>Chad Donella was cast as the lead monster because he possessed a &quot;subtle, interesting quality,&quot; according to casting director Rick Millikan.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> Director Kim Manners latter described Donella as a &quot;great little actor.&quot;<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> Duchovny's stunt double, Steve Kiziak played the role of the private detective&lt;U+2014&gt;also called Steve Kiziak&lt;U+2014&gt;that Roberts kills and eats. Kiziak later said, &quot;It was a lot of fun to be in front of the camera.&quot;<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> Kiziak had first appeared as Duchovny's body double in the <a href="The_X-Files_(season_3)" title="wikilink">third season</a> episode &quot;<a href="2Shy" class="uri" title="wikilink">2Shy</a>,&quot;<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> and would later appear as a Mulder lookalike in &quot;<a href="Fight_Club_(The_X-Files)" title="wikilink">Fight Club</a>.&quot;<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="filming-and-location">Filming and location</h3>
<p>As both David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson were filming movies, <em><a href="Return_to_Me" title="wikilink">Return to Me</a></em> and <em><a href="The_House_of_Mirth" title="wikilink">The House of Mirth</a></em> respectively, the production company decided to film &quot;Hungry&quot; before any of the other episodes, despite the fact that it would be aired third, after &quot;<a href="The_Sixth_Extinction" title="wikilink">The Sixth Extinction</a>&quot; arc. This allowed Duchovny and Anderson to film their scenes and complete their movies with relatively little hassle.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> Several of the finished scenes show Mulder and Scully together, but many of these scenes were created with stand-ins and doubles because of the stars' busy schedules. Duchovny and Anderson were only available for two combined days of filming for this episode.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<p>When it came time to design the sets, the production team found the Lucky Boy Burger restaurant to be relatively easy to create.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> Originally, the name of the restaurant was supposed to be Burgerlishious, but the restaurant location that was considered ideal had a &quot;Lucky Boy&quot; sign that could not be removed.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> Later, the design department faced a challenge in created Roberts' apartment, because the script didn't give a detailed account of what it was to look like.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="broadcast-and-reception">Broadcast and reception</h2>
<p>&quot;Hungry&quot; first aired in the <a href="United_States" title="wikilink">United States</a> on November 21, 1999.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> This episode earned a <a href="Nielsen_rating" title="wikilink">Nielsen rating</a> of 9.6, with a 14 share, meaning that roughly 9.6 percent of all television-equipped households, and 14 percent of households watching television, were tuned in to the episode.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> It was viewed by 16.17 million viewers.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> The episode aired in the <a href="United_Kingdom" title="wikilink">United Kingdom</a> and <a href="Ireland" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ireland</a> on <a href="Sky1" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sky1</a> on April 2, 2000 and received 0.68 million viewers, making it the seventh most watched episode that week.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>
<p>The episode received mixed to positive reviews from critics. <a href="Robert_Shearman" title="wikilink">Robert Shearman</a> and <a href="Lars_Pearson" title="wikilink">Lars Pearson</a>, in their book <em>Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium &amp; The Lone Gunmen</em>, rated the episode five stars out of five, calling the premise &quot;<em><a href="Dexter_(TV_series)" title="wikilink">Dexter</a></em> a decade early.&quot;<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> The two concluded that &quot;the sympathy that Donella gives Rob as he shows his true colours is very touching. [...] The final moments [of the episode] are a typically smart touch to this neglected gem of a story.&quot;<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> Paul Goebel of <a href="TV_Squad" title="wikilink">TV Squad</a> listed Rob Roberts among his favorite <em>X-Files</em> monsters.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> Rich Rosell from Digitally Obsessed awarded the episode 3.5 out of 5 stars and wrote that the episode features a &quot;great setup, but the climax leaves the usual open-ended questions.&quot;<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> Paula Vitaris from <em><a href="Cinefantastique" class="uri" title="wikilink">Cinefantastique</a></em> gave the episode a more mixed review and awarded it two stars out of four.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> She noted that the episode &quot;suffers from a syndrome that has afflicted a great many <em>X-Files</em> episodes in recent seasons [&lt;U+2026&gt;] the syndrome consists of the audience finding out early on who the guilty party is.&quot;<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> Vitaris, however, did note that the episode's &quot;saving grace&quot; was Vince Gilligan's satiric writing tone; she called the scene featuring Roberts hallucinating that the burgers he was frying were actually brains &quot;sick, but hilarious&quot;.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> Kenneth Silber from <a href="Space.com" class="uri" title="wikilink">Space.com</a> was critical of the episode, noting that, although the change in perspective was unique and interesting, &quot;this bit of originality does not rescue the episode from a familiarity bordering on the mundane. It's not the first time we have seen genetic mutants who have an affinity for human body parts.&quot;<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a></p>
