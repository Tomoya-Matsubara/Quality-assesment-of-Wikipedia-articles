<p>The <strong>Banzhaf power index</strong>, named after <a href="John_F._Banzhaf_III" title="wikilink">John F. Banzhaf III</a> (though originally invented by ), is a <a href="power_(sociology)" title="wikilink">power</a> index defined by the <a href="probability" class="uri" title="wikilink">probability</a> of changing an <a href="outcome" class="uri" title="wikilink">outcome</a> of a vote where voting rights are not necessarily equally divided among the <a href="voters" class="uri" title="wikilink">voters</a> or <a href="shareholders" class="uri" title="wikilink">shareholders</a>.</p>
<p>To calculate the power of a voter using the Banzhaf index, list all the winning coalitions, then count the critical voters. A <em>critical voter</em> is a voter who, if he changed his vote from yes to no, would cause the measure to fail. A voter's power is measured as the fraction of all swing votes that he could cast.</p>
<h2 id="examples">Examples</h2>
<p>A simple voting game, taken from <em>Game Theory and Strategy</em> by Phillip D. Straffin:</p>
<p>[6; 4, 3, 2, 1]</p>
<p>The numbers in the brackets mean a measure requires 6 votes to pass, and voter A can cast four votes, B three votes, C two, and D one. The winning groups, with underlined swing voters, are as follows:</p>
<p><u>AB</u>, <u>AC</u>, <u>A</u>BC, <u>AB</u>D, <u>AC</u>D, <u>BCD</u>, ABCD</p>
<p>There are 12 total swing votes, so by the Banzhaf index, power is divided thus.</p>
<p>A = 5/12 B = 3/12 C = 3/12 D = 1/12</p>
<p>Consider the <a href="U.S._Electoral_College" title="wikilink">U.S. Electoral College</a>. Each state has more or less power than the next state. There are a total of 538 electoral votes. A <a href="majority_vote" title="wikilink">majority vote</a> is considered 270 votes. The Banzhaf Power Index would be a mathematical representation of how likely a single state would be able to swing the vote. For a state such as <a href="California" class="uri" title="wikilink">California</a>, which is allocated 55 electoral votes, they would be more likely to swing the vote than a state such as <a href="Montana" class="uri" title="wikilink">Montana</a>, which only has 3 electoral votes.</p>
<p>The <a href="United_States" title="wikilink">United States</a> is having a presidential election between a <a href="Republican_Party_(United_States)" title="wikilink">Republican</a> and a <a href="Democratic_Party_(United_States)" title="wikilink">Democrat</a>. For simplicity, suppose that only three states are participating: <a href="California" class="uri" title="wikilink">California</a> (55 electoral votes), <a href="Texas" class="uri" title="wikilink">Texas</a> (34 electoral votes), and <a href="New_York" title="wikilink">New York</a> (31 electoral votes).</p>
<p>The possible outcomes of the election are:</p>

<p>The Banzhaf Power Index of a state is the proportion of the possible outcomes in which that state could swing the election. In this example, all three states have the same index: 4/12 or 1/3.</p>
<p>However, if New York is replaced by Ohio, with only 20 electoral votes, the situation changes dramatically.</p>

<p>In this example, the Banzhaf index gives California 1 and the other states 0, since California alone has more than half the votes.</p>
<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<p>What is known today as the Banzhaf Power Index has originally been introduced by  and went largely forgotten. It has been reinvented by , but it had to be reinvented once more by  before it became part of the mainstream literature.</p>
<p><a href="John_F._Banzhaf_III" title="wikilink">Banzhaf</a> wanted to prove objectively that the <a href="Nassau_County,_New_York" title="wikilink">Nassau County</a> Board's voting system was unfair. Votes were divided as follows (this information also taken from Game Theory and Strategy, though it can probably be verified elsewhere): [Hempstead #1, Hempstead #2, North Hempstead, Oyster Bay, Glen Cove, Long Beach] are A-F in [16; 9, 9, 7, 3, 1, 1]</p>
<p>The winning coalitions and their swing voters are:</p>
<p><u>AB</u> <u>AC</u> <u>BC</u> ABC <u>AB</u>D <u>AB</u>E <u>AB</u>F <u>AC</u>D <u>AC</u>E <u>AC</u>F <u>BC</u>D <u>BC</u>E <u>BC</u>F ABCD ABCE ABCF <u>AB</u>DE <u>AB</u>DF <u>AB</u>EF <u>AC</u>DE <u>AC</u>DF <u>AC</u>EF <u>BC</u>DE <u>BC</u>DF <u>BC</u>EF ABCDE ABCDF ABCEF <u>AB</u>DEF <u>AC</u>DEF <u>BC</u>DEF ABCDEF</p>
<p>The Banzhaf index gives these values. Hempstead #1 = 16/48 Hempstead #2 = 16/48 North Hempstead = 16/48 Oyster Bay = 0/48 Glen Cove = 0/48 Long Beach = 0/48</p>
<p>Obviously, a voting arrangement that gives 0% of the power to 16% of the population is unfair, and Banzhaf sued the board.</p>
<p>Today, the Banzhaf power index is an accepted way to measure voting power, along with the alternative <a href="Shapley-Shubik_power_index" title="wikilink">Shapley-Shubik power index</a>.</p>
<p>However, Banzhaf's analysis has been critiqued as treating votes like coin-flips, and an empirical model of voting rather than a random voting model as used by Banzhaf brings different results .</p>
