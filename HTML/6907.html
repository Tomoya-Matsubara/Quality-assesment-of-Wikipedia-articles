<p><strong><a href="Slavery" class="uri" title="wikilink">Slavery</a></strong> was an essential component of the development of <strong><a href="Ancient_Greece" title="wikilink">Ancient Greece</a></strong> throughout its history. Most ancient writers considered slavery not only necessary but natural; neither the <a href="Stoicism" title="wikilink">Stoics</a> nor the <a href="Early_Christianity" title="wikilink">Early Christians</a> questioned the practice. However, some isolated debate began to appear, notably in <a href="Socrates" title="wikilink">Socratic dialogues</a>, as early as the <a href="4th_century_BC" title="wikilink">4th century BC</a>.</p>
<p>In conformity with modern historiographical practice, this article will discuss only <a href="chattel_slavery" title="wikilink">chattel slavery</a>, as opposed to dependent groups such as the <a href="Penestae" class="uri" title="wikilink">Penestae</a> of <a href="Thessaly" class="uri" title="wikilink">Thessaly</a>, the <a href="Sparta" title="wikilink">Spartan</a> <a href="Helots" class="uri" title="wikilink">Helots</a> or even the <a href="Klarotes" class="uri" title="wikilink">Klarotes</a> of <a href="Crete" class="uri" title="wikilink">Crete</a>, who were more like Medieval serfs. The chattel slave is an individual deprived of liberty and forced to submit to an owner who may buy, sell, or lease him or her as one might any <a href="chattel" class="uri" title="wikilink">chattel</a> good.</p>
<p>The study of slavery in Ancient Greece poses a number of significant methodological problems. Documentation is disjointed and very fragmented, focusing on the city of <a href="Athens" class="uri" title="wikilink">Athens</a>. No treatise is specifically devoted to the subject. Judicial pleadings of the <a href="4th_century_BC" title="wikilink">4th century BC</a> were interested in slavery only as a source of revenue. <a href="Ancient_Greek_comedy" title="wikilink">Comedy</a> and <a href="Greek_tragedy" title="wikilink">tragedy</a> represented stereotypes. Iconography made no substantial differentiation between slave and <a href="Artisan" title="wikilink">craftsman</a>. Even the terminology is often vague.</p>
<h2 id="terminology">Terminology</h2>
<p>The Ancient Greeks had many words to describe slaves, though many need to be placed in proper context to avoid ambiguity. In <a href="Homer" class="uri" title="wikilink">Homer</a>, <a href="Hesiod" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hesiod</a> and <a href="Theognis_of_Megara" title="wikilink">Theognis of Megara</a>, the slave was called  / <em>dm&lt;U+00F4&gt;s</em>.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> The term has a general meaning but refers particularly to war prisoners taken as booty,<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> in other words, property. During the classical period, the Greeks frequently used  / <em>andr&lt;U+00E1&gt;podon</em>,<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> literally, &quot;one with the feet of a man&quot;, as opposed to  / <em>tetrapodon</em>, &quot;quadruped&quot;, or livestock.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> The most common word is undoubtedly  / <em>do&lt;U+00FB&gt;los</em>,<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> an earlier form of which appears in <a href="Mycenaean_Greece" title="wikilink">Mycenaean</a> inscriptions as <em>do-e-ro</em>,<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> used in opposition to &quot;free man&quot; ( / <em>ele&lt;U+00FA&gt;theros</em>). The <a href="verb" class="uri" title="wikilink">verb</a>  can be used metaphorically for other forms of dominion, as of one city over another or parents over their children.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> Finally, the term  / <em>oik&lt;U+00E9&gt;t&lt;U+00EA&gt;s</em> was used, meaning literally &quot;one who lives in the house&quot;, referring to household servants.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p>Other terms used were less precise and required context:</p>
<p>:*  / <em>ther&lt;U+00E1&gt;p&lt;U+00F4&gt;n</em> &lt;U+2014&gt; At the time of <a href="Homer" class="uri" title="wikilink">Homer</a>, the word meant &quot;squire&quot; (<a href="Patroclus" class="uri" title="wikilink">Patroclus</a> was referred to as the <em>therap&lt;U+00F4&gt;n</em> of <a href="Achilles" class="uri" title="wikilink">Achilles</a><a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> and <a href="Meriones_(mythology)" title="wikilink">Meriones</a> that of <a href="Idomeneus" class="uri" title="wikilink">Idomeneus</a><a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a>); during the classical age, it meant &quot;servant&quot;.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<p>:*  / <em>ak&lt;U+00F3&gt;louthos</em> &lt;U+2014&gt; literally, &quot;the follower&quot; or &quot;the one who accompanies&quot;. Also, the <a href="diminutive" class="uri" title="wikilink">diminutive</a> , used for <a href="page_(servant)" title="wikilink">page</a> boys.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<p>:*  / <em>pais</em> &lt;U+2014&gt; literally &quot;child&quot;, used in the same way as &quot;<a href="houseboy" class="uri" title="wikilink">houseboy</a>&quot;,<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> also used in a derogatory way to call adult slaves.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<p>:*  / <em>s&lt;U+00F4&gt;ma</em> &lt;U+2014&gt; literally &quot;body&quot;, used in the context of emancipation.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="origins-of-slavery">Origins of slavery</h2>
<p><img src="Aias_Kassandra_Louvre_G458.jpg" title="fig:Women as plunder of war: Ajax the Lesser taking Cassandra, tondo of a red-figure kylix by the Kodros Painter, ca. 440-430 BC, Louvre" alt="Women as plunder of war: Ajax the Lesser taking Cassandra, tondo of a red-figure kylix by the Kodros Painter, ca. 440-430 BC, Louvre" width="280" /> The presence of slaves is confirmed in the <a href="Mycenaean_Greece" title="wikilink">Mycenaean civilization</a>. In the tablets from <a href="Pylos" class="uri" title="wikilink">Pylos</a> 140 <em>do-e-ro</em> can be identified with certainty. Two legal categories can be distinguished: &quot;common&quot; slaves and &quot;slaves of the god&quot; (<em>te-o-jo do-e-ro</em> / &lt;U+03B8&gt;&lt;U+03B5&gt;&lt;U+03BF&gt;&lt;U+03B9&gt;&lt;U+03BF&gt;), the god in this case probably being <a href="Poseidon" class="uri" title="wikilink">Poseidon</a>. Slaves of the god are always mentioned by name and own their own land; their legal status is close to that of freemen. The nature and origin of their bond to the divinity is unclear.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> As for common slaves, their names show that some of them came from <a href="Kythira" title="wikilink">Kythera</a>, <a href="Chios" class="uri" title="wikilink">Chios</a>, <a href="Lemnos" class="uri" title="wikilink">Lemnos</a>, or even <a href="Halicarnassus" class="uri" title="wikilink">Halicarnassus</a> and were probably enslaved as a result of <a href="piracy" class="uri" title="wikilink">piracy</a>. The tablets indicate that unions between slaves and non-slaves were not uncommon and that slaves could be independent artisans and could retain plots of land. In fact, it appears that the major division in Mycenaean civilization was not between slave and free, but between those attached to the palace and those not.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
<p>There is no continuity between the Mycenaean era and the time of <a href="Homer" class="uri" title="wikilink">Homer</a>, where social structures reflected those of the <a href="Greek_dark_ages" title="wikilink">Greek dark ages</a>. The terminology differs: the slave is no longer <em>do-e-ro</em> (doulos) but <em>dm&lt;U+00F4&gt;s</em>.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> In the <a href="Iliad" class="uri" title="wikilink">Iliad</a>, slaves are mainly women taken as booty of war,<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> while men were either ransomed<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> or killed on the battlefield. In the <em>Odyssey</em>, the slaves also seem to be mostly women.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> These slaves were servants<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> sometimes concubines.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> There were some male slaves, especially in the <em>Odyssey</em>, a prime example being the swineherd Eumaeus. The slave was distinctive in being a member of the core part of the <em>oikos</em> (&quot;family unit&quot;, &quot;household&quot;): <a href="Laertes" class="uri" title="wikilink">Laertes</a> eats and drinks with his servants<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a>; in the winter, he sleeps in their company.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> The term <em>dm&lt;U+00F4&gt;s</em> is not considered pejorative, and Eumaeus, the &quot;divine&quot; swineherd,<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> benefits from the same <a href="Epithets_in_Homer" title="wikilink">Homeric epithet</a> as the Greek heroes. In spite of this, slavery remained a disgrace. Eumaeus himself declares that &lt;U+201C&gt;Zeus, of the far-borne voice, takes away the half of a man's virtue, when the day of slavery comes upon him.&lt;U+201D&gt;<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a></p>
<p>It is difficult to determine when slave trading began in the archaic period. In <em>Works and Days</em> (<a href="8th_century_BC" title="wikilink">8th century BC</a>), <a href="Hesiod" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hesiod</a> owns numerous <em>dm&lt;U+00F4&gt;es</em>,<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> although their status is unclear. The presence of <em>douloi</em> is confirmed by lyric poets such as <a href="Archilochus" class="uri" title="wikilink">Archilochus</a> or <a href="Theognis_of_Megara" title="wikilink">Theognis of Megara</a>.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> According to epigraphic evidence, the homicide law of <a href="Draco_(lawgiver)" title="wikilink">Draco</a> (c. 620 BC) mentioned slaves.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> According to Plutarch,<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> <a href="Solon" class="uri" title="wikilink">Solon</a> (c. 594-593 BC) forbade slaves from practising gymnastics and pederasty. By the end of the period, references become more common. Slavery becomes prevalent at the very moment when Solon establishes the basis for Athenian democracy. Classical scholar <a href="Moses_Finley" title="wikilink">Moses Finley</a> likewise remarks that Chios, which, according to <a href="Theopompus" class="uri" title="wikilink">Theopompus</a>,<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> was the first city to organize a slave trade, also enjoyed an early democratic process (in the 6th century BC). He concludes that &lt;U+201C&gt;one aspect of Greek history, in short, is the advance hand in hand, of freedom <em>and</em> slavery.&lt;U+201D&gt;<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="economic-role">Economic role</h2>

<p><img src="Amphora_olive-gathering_BM_B226.jpg" title="fig:Agriculture, a common use for slaves, black-figure neck-amphora by the Antimenes Painter, British Museum" alt="Agriculture, a common use for slaves, black-figure neck-amphora by the Antimenes Painter, British Museum" width="250" /> Strictly speaking, there was no such thing as a servile act. All activities were open to slaves with the exception of politics, the only activity over which citizens had a monopoly.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> Moreover, for the Greeks, politics was the only activity worthy of a citizen, the rest having been relegated wherever possible to non-citizens.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> It was status that was of importance, not activity.</p>
<p>The principal use of slaves was in <a href="Agriculture_of_ancient_Greece" title="wikilink">agriculture</a>, the foundation of the Greek economy. Some small landowners might own one slave, or even two.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> An abundant literature of manuals for landowners (such as the <a href="Oeconomicus" title="wikilink"><em>Economy</em></a> of <a href="Xenophon" class="uri" title="wikilink">Xenophon</a> or that of <a href="Pseudo-Aristotle" class="uri" title="wikilink">Pseudo-Aristotle</a>) confirms the presence of dozens of slaves on the larger estates; they could be common labourers or foremen. The extent to which slaves were used as a labour force in farming is still disputed.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> It is, however, certain on the one hand that rural slavery was very common in Athens, and, on the other, that Ancient Greece did not know the immense slave populations found on the Roman <em><a href="latifundia" class="uri" title="wikilink">latifundia</a></em>.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a></p>
<p>In the <a href="Mining" title="wikilink">mines</a> and <a href="Quarry" title="wikilink">quarries</a>, slave labour was by far most prevalent. Here were found large slave populations, often leased out by rich private citizens. The <a href="strategos" class="uri" title="wikilink">strategos</a> <a href="Nicias" class="uri" title="wikilink">Nicias</a> leased a thousand slaves to the silver mines of <a href="Laurium" class="uri" title="wikilink">Laurium</a> in <a href="Attica" class="uri" title="wikilink">Attica</a>; Hipponicos, 600; and Philomid&lt;U+00E8&gt;s, 300. Xenophon<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> indicates that they received one <a href="obolus" class="uri" title="wikilink">obolus</a> per slave per day, amounting to 60 <a href="drachma" title="wikilink">drachmas</a> per year. This was one of the most prized investments for Athenians. The number of slaves working in the Laurium mines or in the mills processing ore can be estimated at 30,000.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> Xenophon even suggested that the city buy a large number of slaves, up to three state slaves per citizen, so that their leasing would assure the upkeep of all the citizens.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a></p>
<p>Slaves were also used as craftsmen and <a href="tradesperson" title="wikilink">tradespersons</a>. As in agriculture, they were used for labour which was beyond the capability of the family. However, the slave population was greatest in the workshops. The shield factory of <a href="Lysias" class="uri" title="wikilink">Lysias</a> employed 120 slaves,<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> and the father of <a href="Demosthenes" class="uri" title="wikilink">Demosthenes</a> owned 32 cutlers and 20 bedmakers.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a></p>
<p>Slaves were also employed in the home. The domestic's main role was to stand in for his master at his trade and to accompany him on trips. In time of war he was batman to the <a href="hoplite" class="uri" title="wikilink">hoplite</a>; it has been argued that their actual role was far greater.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> The female slave carried out domestic tasks, in particular bread baking and textile making. Only the poorest citizens did not possess a domestic slave.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="demographics">Demographics</h2>
<h3 id="population">Population</h3>
<p><img src="NAMA_Cheval_&amp;_esclave_&lt;U+00E9&gt;thiopien.jpg" title="fig:Ethiopian slave attempts to break a horse, date unknown, National Archaeological Museum of Athens" alt="Ethiopian slave attempts to break a horse, date unknown, National Archaeological Museum of Athens" width="220" /> It is difficult to estimate the number of slaves in ancient Greece, given the lack of a precise census and variations in definitions during that era. It is certain that Athens had the largest slave population with as many as 80,000 in the <a href="5th_century_BC" title="wikilink">5th</a> and <a href="6th_century_BC" title="wikilink">6th</a> centuries BC,<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> on average three or four slaves per household. In the <a href="5th_century_BC" title="wikilink">5th century BC</a>, <a href="Thucydides" class="uri" title="wikilink">Thucydides</a> remarked upon the desertion of 20,000 slaves during the <a href="Decelea" title="wikilink">war of Decelea</a>, mostly tradesmen. The lowest estimate, of 20,000 slaves, during the time of <a href="Demosthenes" class="uri" title="wikilink">Demosthenes</a>,<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a> corresponds to one slave per family. Between 317 BC and 307 BC, the tyrant <a href="Demetrius_Phalereus" title="wikilink">Demetrius Phalereus</a> ordered<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a> a general census of Attica which arrived at the following figures: 21,000 citizens, 10,000 <a href="Metic" title="wikilink">Metics</a> and 400,000 slaves. The orator <a href="Hypereides" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hypereides</a>, in his <em>Against Areistogiton</em>, recalls that the effort to enlist 150,000 male slaves of military age led to the defeat of the Greeks at the <a href="Battle_of_Chaeronea_(338_BC)" title="wikilink">Battle of Chaeronea (338 BC)</a>, which corresponds to the figures of <a href="Ctesicles" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ctesicles</a>.<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a></p>
<p>According to the literature, it appears that the majority of Athenians owned at least one slave. <a href="Aristophanes" class="uri" title="wikilink">Aristophanes</a>, in <em><a href="Plutus_(play)" title="wikilink">Plutus</a></em>, portrays poor peasants who have several slaves; Aristotle defines a house as containing freemen and slaves.<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a> Conversely, not owning even one slave was a clear sign of poverty. In the celebrated discourse of <a href="Lysias" class="uri" title="wikilink">Lysias</a> <em>For the Invalid</em>, a cripple pleading for a pension explains &quot;my income is very small and now I'm required to do these things myself and do not even have the means to purchase a slave who can do these things for me.&quot;<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a> However, the huge slave populations of the Romans were unknown in Ancient Greece. When Athenaeus<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a> cites the case of Mnason, friend of Aristotle and owner of a thousand slaves, this appears to be exceptional. <a href="Plato" class="uri" title="wikilink">Plato</a>, owner of five slaves at the time of his death, describes the very rich as owning 50 slaves.<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a></p>
<p>In terms of density, Thucydides estimates that the isle of <a href="Chios" class="uri" title="wikilink">Chios</a> had proportionally the largest number of slaves.<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="sources-of-supply">Sources of supply</h3>
<p>There were four primary sources of slaves: war, <a href="piracy" class="uri" title="wikilink">piracy</a> (at sea), banditry (on land), and international trade.</p>
<h4 id="war">War</h4>
<p>By the rules of war of the period, the victor possessed absolute rights over the vanquished, whether they were soldiers or not.<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a> Enslavement, while not systematic, was common practice. <a href="Thucydides" class="uri" title="wikilink">Thucydides</a> recalls that 7,000 inhabitants of Hyccara in <a href="Sicily" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sicily</a> were taken prisoner by <a href="Nicias" class="uri" title="wikilink">Nicias</a> and sold for 120 <a href="Talent_(weight)" title="wikilink">talents</a> in the neighbouring village of <a href="Catania" class="uri" title="wikilink">Catania</a>.<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a> Likewise in 348 BC the population of <a href="Olynthus" class="uri" title="wikilink">Olynthus</a> was reduced to slavery, as was that of <a href="Thebes,_Greece" title="wikilink">Thebes</a> in 335 BC by <a href="Alexander_the_Great" title="wikilink">Alexander the Great</a> and that of <a href="Mantineia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mantineia</a> by the <a href="Achaean_League" title="wikilink">Achaean League</a>.<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a></p>
<p>The existence of Greek slaves was a constant source of discomfort for free Greeks. The enslavement of cities was also a controversial practice. Some generals refused, such as the <a href="Sparta" title="wikilink">Spartans</a> <a href="Agesilaus_II" title="wikilink">Agesilaus II</a><a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a> and <a href="Callicratidas" class="uri" title="wikilink">Callicratidas</a>.<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a> Some cities passed accords to forbid the practice: in the middle of the <a href="3rd_century_BC" title="wikilink">3rd century BC</a>, <a href="Miletus" class="uri" title="wikilink">Miletus</a> agreed not to reduce any free <a href="Knossos" title="wikilink">Knossian</a> to slavery, and vice versa.<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a> Conversely, the emancipation by ransom of a city which had been entirely reduced to slavery carried great prestige: <a href="Cassander" class="uri" title="wikilink">Cassander</a>, in 316 BC, restored Thebes.<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a> Before him, <a href="Philip_II_of_Macedon" title="wikilink">Philip II of Macedon</a> enslaved and then emancipated <a href="Stageira" class="uri" title="wikilink">Stageira</a>.<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a></p>
<h4 id="piracy-and-banditry">Piracy and banditry</h4>
<p>War provided a significant and consistent supply of slaves. The same went for <a href="piracy" class="uri" title="wikilink">piracy</a> and banditry,<a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a> though the significance of this source varied according to era and region.<a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a> Pirates and brigands would demand ransom whenever the status of their catch warranted it. Whenever ransom was not paid, or was not warranted, captives would be sold to a trafficker<a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a>. Thus, nobody was immune from falling into servitude. In certain areas, piracy was practically a national specialty, described by Thucydides as &quot;the old-fashioned&quot; way of life.<a href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a> Such was the case in <a href="Acarnania" class="uri" title="wikilink">Acarnania</a>, <a href="Crete" class="uri" title="wikilink">Crete</a>, and <a href="Aetolia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Aetolia</a>.

<p>There was in addition a slave trade with neighbouring barbarians. The fragmentary list of slaves confiscated from the property of the mutilators of the <em><a href="Herma" title="wikilink">Hermai</a></em> mentions 32 slaves whose nationalities have been ascertained: 13 came from <a href="Thrace" class="uri" title="wikilink">Thrace</a>, 7 from <a href="Caria" class="uri" title="wikilink">Caria</a>, and the others came from <a href="Cappadocia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Cappadocia</a>, <a href="Caria" class="uri" title="wikilink">Caria</a>, <a href="Scythia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Scythia</a>, <a href="Phrygia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Phrygia</a>, <a href="Lydia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Lydia</a>, <a href="Syria" class="uri" title="wikilink">Syria</a>, <a href="Ilyria" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ilyria</a>, <a href="Macedon" class="uri" title="wikilink">Macedon</a> and <a href="Peloponnese" class="uri" title="wikilink">Peloponnese</a>.<a href="#fn70" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a> The mechanism was similar to that later seen in the <a href="African_slave_trade" title="wikilink">African slave trade</a>: local professionals sold their fellow creatures to Greek slave merchants. The principal centres of the slave trade appear to have been <a href="Ephesus" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ephesus</a>, <a href="Byzantium" class="uri" title="wikilink">Byzantium</a>, and even faraway <a href="Tanais" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tanais</a> at the mouth of the <a href="Don_River,_Russia" title="wikilink">Don</a>. Some barbarian slaves were victims of war or localised piracy, but others were sold by their parents.<a href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a> There is a lack of direct evidence of slave traffic, but corroborating evidence exists. Firstly, certain nationalities are consistently and significantly represented in the slave population, such as the corps of Scythian archers employed by Athens as a police force&lt;U+2014&gt;originally 300, but eventually nearly a thousand.<a href="#fn72" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref72"><sup>72</sup></a> Secondly, the names given to slaves in the <a href="Ancient_Greek_comedy" title="wikilink">comedies</a> often had a geographical link; thus <em>Thratta</em>, used by <a href="Aristophanes" class="uri" title="wikilink">Aristophanes</a> in <em><a href="The_Wasps" title="wikilink">The Wasps</a></em>, <em><a href="The_Acharnians" title="wikilink">The Acharnians</a></em>, and <em><a href="Peace_(play)" title="wikilink">Peace</a></em>, simply signified <em>Thracian woman</em>.<a href="#fn73" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref73"><sup>73</sup></a> Finally, the nationality of a slave was a significant criterion for major purchasers; the ancient advice was not to concentrate too many slaves of the same origin in the same place, in order to limit the risk of revolt.<a href="#fn74" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref74"><sup>74</sup></a> It is also probable that, as with the Romans, certain nationalities were considered more productive as slaves than others.</p>
<p>The price of slaves varied in accordance with their ability. Xenophon valued a Laurion miner at 180 <a href="drachma" title="wikilink">drachmas</a>;<a href="#fn75" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref75"><sup>75</sup></a> in comparison a workman at major works was paid one <a href="drachma" class="uri" title="wikilink">drachma</a> per day.

A tax on sale revenues was levied by the market cities. A large slave market was organized, for instance, during the festivities at the temple of <a href="Apollo" class="uri" title="wikilink">Apollo</a> at <a href="Actium" class="uri" title="wikilink">Actium</a>. The Acarnanian League, who was in charge of the logistics, received half of the tax proceeds, the other half going to the city of Anactorion, of which Actium was a part.<a href="#fn77" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref77"><sup>77</sup></a> Buyers enjoyed a guarantee against <a href="latent_defect" title="wikilink">latent defects</a>; the transaction could be invalidated if the bought slave turned out to be crippled and the buyer had not been warned about it.<a href="#fn78" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref78"><sup>78</sup></a></p>

<p>Houseborn slaves (<em>oikogeneis</em>) often constituted a privileged class. They were, for example, entrusted to take the children to school; they were &quot;<a href="Pedagogy" title="wikilink">pedagogues</a>&quot; in the first sense of the term.<a href="#fn85" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref85"><sup>85</sup></a> Some of them were the offspring of the master of the house, but in most cities, notably Athens, a child inherited the status of its mother.<a href="#fn86" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref86"><sup>86</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="status-of-slaves">Status of slaves</h2>
<p>The Greeks had not one but many degrees of enslavement. More precisely, there was a multitude of categories, ranging from free citizen to chattel slave, and including serfs (<a href="Penestae" class="uri" title="wikilink">Penestae</a> or <a href="Helots" class="uri" title="wikilink">Helots</a>), disenfranchised citizens, freedmen, bastards, and <a href="Metic" title="wikilink">Metics</a>.<a href="#fn87" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref87"><sup>87</sup></a> The common ground was, of course, the deprivation of civic rights.</p>

<p>However, slaves did belong to their master's household.

Their children belonged to the master.<a href="#fn109" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref109"><sup>109</sup></a> The master was responsible for all their offences, and, inversely, he received amends for crimes committed against his slaves by others.<a href="#fn110" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref110"><sup>110</sup></a> In the Gortyn code, where all punishment was monetary, fines were doubled for slaves committing a misdemeanour or felony. Conversely, an offence committed against a slave was much less expensive than an offence committed against a free person. As an example, the rape of a free woman by a slave was punishable by a fine of 200 <a href="stater" title="wikilink">staters</a>, while the rape of a non-virgin slave by another slave brought a fine of only one obolus.<a href="#fn111" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref111"><sup>111</sup></a></p>

<h3 id="a-specific-case-debt-slavery">A specific case: debt slavery</h3>
<p>Prior to its interdiction by <a href="Solon" class="uri" title="wikilink">Solon</a>, Athenians practised debt enslavement: a citizen incapable of paying his debts became &quot;enslaved&quot; to the creditor.<a href="#fn114" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref114"><sup>114</sup></a> The exact nature of this depency is a much controverted issue amongst modern historians: was it truly slavery or another form of bondage? However, this issue primarily concerned those peasants known as &quot;hekt&lt;U+0113&gt;moroi&quot;<a href="#fn115" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref115"><sup>115</sup></a> working leased land belonging to rich landowners and unable to pay their rents. In theory, those so enslaved would be liberated when their original debts were repaid. The system was developed with variants throughout the <a href="Near_East" title="wikilink">Near East</a> and is cited in the <a href="Bible" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bible</a>.<a href="#fn116" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref116"><sup>116</sup></a></p>
<p>Solon put an end to it with the  / <em>seisakhtheia</em>, liberation of debts, which prevented all claim to the person by the debtor and forbade the sale of free Athenians, including by themselves. <a href="Aristotle" class="uri" title="wikilink">Aristotle</a> in his <em><a href="Constitution_of_the_Athenians" title="wikilink">Constitution of the Athenians</a></em> quotes one of Solon's poems:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And many a man whom fraud or law had sold<br />
Far from his god-built land, an outcast slave,<br />
I brought again to Athens; yea, and some,<br />
Exiles from home through debt&lt;U+2019&gt;s oppressive load,<br />
Speaking no more the dear Athenian tongue,<br />
But wandering far and wide, I brought again;<br />
And those that here in vilest slavery (<em>douleia</em>)<br />
Crouched &lt;U+2018&gt;neath a master&lt;U+2019&gt;s (<em>desp&lt;U+014D&gt;tes</em>) frown, I set them free.<a href="#fn117" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref117"><sup>117</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Though much of Solon's vocabulary is that of &quot;traditional&quot; slavery, servitude for debt was at least different in that the enslaved Athenian remained an Athenian, dependent on another Athenian, in his place of birth.<a href="#fn118" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref118"><sup>118</sup></a> It is this aspect which explains the great wave of discontent with slavery of the <a href="6th_century_BC" title="wikilink">6th century BC</a>, which was not intended to free all slaves but only those enslaved by debt.<a href="#fn119" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref119"><sup>119</sup></a> The reforms of Solon did, however, leave two exceptions: the guardian of an unmarried woman who had lost her virginity had the right to sell her as a slave,<a href="#fn120" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref120"><sup>120</sup></a> and a citizen could &lt;U+201C&gt;expose&lt;U+201D&gt; (i.e., abandon) unwanted newborn children.<a href="#fn121" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref121"><sup>121</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="manumission">Manumission</h3>
<p>The practice of <a href="manumission" class="uri" title="wikilink">manumission</a> is confirmed to have existed in <a href="Chios" class="uri" title="wikilink">Chios</a> from the <a href="6th_century_BC" title="wikilink">6th century BC</a>.<a href="#fn122" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref122"><sup>122</sup></a> It probably dates back to an earlier period, as it was an oral procedure. Informal emancipations are also confirmed in the classical period. It was sufficient to have witnesses, who would escort the citizen to a public emancipation of his slave, either at the <a href="Theatre_of_Ancient_Greece#Theatre_Structure_and_Layout" title="wikilink">theatre</a> or before a public tribunal.<a href="#fn123" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref123"><sup>123</sup></a> This practice was outlawed in Athens in the middle of the <a href="6th_century_BC" title="wikilink">6th century BC</a> in order to avoid public disorder.</p>
<p>The practice became more common in the <a href="4th_century_BC" title="wikilink">4th century BC</a> and gave rise to inscriptions in stone which have been recovered from shrines such as <a href="Delphi" class="uri" title="wikilink">Delphi</a> and <a href="Dodona" class="uri" title="wikilink">Dodona</a>. They primarily date to the <a href="2nd_century_BC" title="wikilink">2nd</a> and <a href="1st_century_BC" title="wikilink">1st</a> centuries BC, and the <a href="1st_century" title="wikilink">1st century</a> AD. Collective manumission was possible; an example is known from the <a href="2nd_century_BC" title="wikilink">2nd century BC</a> in the island of <a href="Thasos" class="uri" title="wikilink">Thasos</a>. It probably took place during a period of war as a reward for the slaves' loyalty,<a href="#fn124" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref124"><sup>124</sup></a> but in most cases the documentation deals with a voluntary act on the part of the master (predominantly male, but in the Hellenistic period also female). The slave was often required to pay for himself an amount at least equivalent to his street value. To do this he could use his savings or take a loan ( / <em>eranos</em>) from his master, a friend, or a client, which last was often the case for a courtesan, one of the most famous examples of which involved the <a href="hetaera" class="uri" title="wikilink">hetaera</a> Neaira.<a href="#fn125" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref125"><sup>125</sup></a> The emancipation was often of a religious nature, where the slave was considered to be &quot;sold&quot; to a deity, often Delphian <a href="Apollo" class="uri" title="wikilink">Apollo</a>,<a href="#fn126" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref126"><sup>126</sup></a> or was consecrated after his emancipation. The temple would receive a portion of the monetary transaction and would guarantee the contract. The manumission could also be entirely civil, in which case the magistrate played the role of the deity.<a href="#fn127" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref127"><sup>127</sup></a></p>
<p>The slave's freedom could be either total or partial, at the master's whim. In the former, the emancipated slave was legally protected against all attempts at re-enslavement&lt;U+2014&gt;for instance, on the part of the former master's inheritors.<a href="#fn128" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref128"><sup>128</sup></a> In the latter case, the emancipated slave could be liable to a number of obligations to the former master. The most restrictive contract was the <em>paramone</em>, a type of enslavement of limited duration during which time the master retained practically absolute rights.<a href="#fn129" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref129"><sup>129</sup></a></p>
<p>In regard to the city, the emancipated slave was far from equal to a citizen by birth. He was liable to all types of obligations, as one can see from the proposals of <a href="Plato" class="uri" title="wikilink">Plato</a> in <em>The Laws</em>:<a href="#fn130" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref130"><sup>130</sup></a> presentation three times monthly at the home of the former master, forbidden to become richer than him, etc. In fact, the status of emancipated slaves was similar to that of <a href="Metic" title="wikilink">Metics</a>, the residing foreigners, who were free but did not enjoy a citizen's rights.<a href="#fn131" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref131"><sup>131</sup></a></p>

<p>Some texts mention both slaves and Helots, which seems to indicate that they were not the same thing. <a href="Pseudo-Plato" class="uri" title="wikilink">Pseudo-Plato</a> in <em><a href="Alcibiades_I" title="wikilink">Alcibiades I</a></em> cites &quot;the ownership of slaves, and notably Helots&quot; amongst the Spartan riches,<a href="#fn136" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref136"><sup>136</sup></a> and Plutarch writes about &quot;slaves and Helots&quot;.<a href="#fn137" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref137"><sup>137</sup></a> Finally, according to Thucydides, the agreement which ended the 464 BC revolt of Helots stated that any Messenian rebel who might hereafter be found within the <a href="Peloponnese" class="uri" title="wikilink">Peloponnese</a> was &quot;to be the slave of his captor&quot;, which means that the ownership of chattel slaves was not illegal at that time.</p>
<p>Most historians thus concur that chattel slaves were indeed used in Sparta, at least after the Lacedemonian victory of 404 BC against Athens, but not in great numbers and only amongst the upper classes.<a href="#fn138" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref138"><sup>138</sup></a> As was the case in the other Greek cities, chattel slaves could be purchased at the market or taken in war.</p>
<h2 id="slavery-conditions">Slavery conditions</h2>
<p><img src="Black_slave_Louvre_Br361.jpg" title="fig:Black captive with tied hands, Ptolemaic Egypt, mus&lt;U+00E9&gt;e du Louvre" alt="Black captive with tied hands, Ptolemaic Egypt, mus&lt;U+00E9&gt;e du Louvre" width="180" /> It is difficult to appreciate the condition of Greek slaves. According to pseudo-Aristotle, the daily routine of slaves could be summed up in three words: &quot;work, discipline, and feeding&quot;.<a href="#fn139" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref139"><sup>139</sup></a> Xenophon's advice is to treat slaves as domestic animals, that is to say punish disobedience and reward good behaviour.<a href="#fn140" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref140"><sup>140</sup></a> For his part, Aristotle prefers to see slaves treated as children and to use not only orders but also recommendations, as the slave is capable of understanding reasons when they are explained.<a href="#fn141" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref141"><sup>141</sup></a></p>
<p>Greek literature abounds with scenes of slaves being flogged; it was a means of forcing them to work, as was control of rations, clothing, and rest. This violence could be meted out by the master as well as the supervisor, who was possibly also a slave. Thus, at the beginning of <a href="Aristophanes" class="uri" title="wikilink">Aristophanes</a>' <em><a href="The_Knights" title="wikilink">The Knights</a></em> (4&lt;U+2013&gt;5), two slaves complain of being &quot;bruised and thrashed without respite&quot; by their new supervisor. However, Aristophanes himself cites what is a typical old saw in <a href="Ancient_Greek_comedy" title="wikilink">Ancient Greek comedy</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;He also dismissed those slaves who kept on running off, or deceiving someone, or getting whipped. They were always led out crying, so one of their fellow slaves could mock the bruises and ask then: 'Oh you poor miserable fellow, what's happened to your skin? Surely a huge army of lashes from a whip has fallen down on you and laid waste your back?'&quot;<a href="#fn142" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref142"><sup>142</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In fact, the condition of slaves varied very much according to their status; the mine slaves of Laureion and the <em><a href="prostitution_in_ancient_Greece" title="wikilink">pornai</a></em> (brother prostitutes) lived a particularly brutal existence, while public slaves, craftsmen, tradesmen and bankers enjoyed relative independence.<a href="#fn143" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref143"><sup>143</sup></a> In return for a fee ( / <em>apophora</em>) paid to their master, they could live and work alone.<a href="#fn144" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref144"><sup>144</sup></a> They could thus earn some money on the side, sometimes enough to purchase their freedom. Potential emancipation was indeed a powerful motivator, though the real scale of this is difficult to estimate.<a href="#fn145" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref145"><sup>145</sup></a></p>
<p>Ancient writers considered that Attic slaves enjoyed a &lt;U+201C&gt;peculiarly happy lot&lt;U+201D&gt;:<a href="#fn146" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref146"><sup>146</sup></a> Pseudo-Xenophon deplores the liberties taken by Athenian slaves: &quot;as for the slaves and Metics of Athens, they take the greatest licence; you cannot just strike them, and they do not step aside to give you free passage&quot;.<a href="#fn147" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref147"><sup>147</sup></a> This alleged good treatment did not prevent 20,000 Athenian slaves from running away at the end of the <a href="Peloponnesian_War" title="wikilink">Peloponnesian War</a> at the incitement of the Spartan garrison at <a href="Attica" class="uri" title="wikilink">Attica</a> in <a href="Decelea" class="uri" title="wikilink">Decelea</a>.<a href="#fn148" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref148"><sup>148</sup></a> These were principally skilled artisans (<em>kheirotekhnai</em>), probably amongst the better-treated slaves. The title of a 4th-century comedy by <a href="Antiphanes" class="uri" title="wikilink">Antiphanes</a>, <em>The Runaway-catcher</em> (),<a href="#fn149" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref149"><sup>149</sup></a> suggests that slave flight was not uncommon.<a href="#fn150" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref150"><sup>150</sup></a> Conversely, the absence of a large-scale Greek slave revolt comparable to that of <a href="Spartacus" class="uri" title="wikilink">Spartacus</a> in <a href="Rome" class="uri" title="wikilink">Rome</a>, for instance, can undoubtedly be explained by the relative dispersion of Greek slaves, which would have prevented any large-scale planning. It should be noted though that slave revolts were rare, even in Rome or the American South. Individual acts of rebellion of slaves against their master, even if scarce, are not unheard of; a judicial speech mentions the attempted murder of his master by a boy slave, not twelve years old.<a href="#fn151" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref151"><sup>151</sup></a></p>

<p>No author of Antiquity calls the existence of slavery into question; at most, they admit that certain slaves may have been unjustly enslaved. To <a href="Homer" class="uri" title="wikilink">Homer</a> and the pre-classical authors, slavery was an inevitable consequence of war. <a href="Heraclitus" class="uri" title="wikilink">Heraclitus</a> states that &quot;War is the father of all, the king of all ... he turns some into slaves and sets others free&quot;.<a href="#fn152" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref152"><sup>152</sup></a></p>
<p>During the classical period, the main justification for slavery was economic.<a href="#fn153" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref153"><sup>153</sup></a> From a moral point of view, the idea of &quot;natural&quot; slavery emerged at the same time; thus, as <a href="Aeschylus" class="uri" title="wikilink">Aeschylus</a> states in <em><a href="The_Persians" title="wikilink">The Persians</a></em>, the Greeks &quot;[o]f no man are they called the slaves or vassals&quot;,<a href="#fn154" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref154"><sup>154</sup></a> while the <a href="Persian_people" title="wikilink">Persians</a>, as <a href="Euripides" class="uri" title="wikilink">Euripides</a> states in <em><a href="Helen_(play)" title="wikilink">Helen</a></em>, &quot;are all slaves, except one&quot; &lt;U+2014&gt; the <a href="Great_King" title="wikilink">Great King</a>.<a href="#fn155" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref155"><sup>155</sup></a> <a href="Hippocrates" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hippocrates</a> theorizes about this latent idea at the end of the <a href="5th_century_BC" title="wikilink">5th century BC</a>. According to him, the temperate climate of <a href="Anatolia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Anatolia</a> produced a placid and submissive people.<a href="#fn156" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref156"><sup>156</sup></a> This explanation is reprised by <a href="Plato" class="uri" title="wikilink">Plato</a>,<a href="#fn157" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref157"><sup>157</sup></a> then <a href="Aristotle" class="uri" title="wikilink">Aristotle</a> in <em><a href="Politics_(Aristotle)" title="wikilink">Politics</a></em>,<a href="#fn158" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref158"><sup>158</sup></a> where he develops the concept of &quot;natural slavery&quot;: &quot;for he that can foresee with his mind is naturally ruler and naturally master, and he that can do these things with his body is subject and naturally a slave.&quot;<a href="#fn159" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref159"><sup>159</sup></a> As opposed to an animal, a slave can comprehend reason but &quot;&lt;U+2026&gt;has not got the deliberative part at all.&quot;<a href="#fn160" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref160"><sup>160</sup></a></p>
<p>In parallel, the concept that all men, whether Greek or barbarian, belonged to the same race was being developed by the <a href="sophism" title="wikilink">Sophists</a><a href="#fn161" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref161"><sup>161</sup></a> and thus that certain men were slaves although they had the soul of a freeman and vice versa.<a href="#fn162" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref162"><sup>162</sup></a> Aristotle himself recognized this possibility and argued that slavery could not be imposed unless the master was better than the slave, in keeping with his theory of &quot;natural&quot; slavery.<a href="#fn163" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref163"><sup>163</sup></a> The Sophists concluded that true servitude was not a matter of status but a matter of spirit; thus, as <a href="Menander" class="uri" title="wikilink">Menander</a> stated, &lt;U+201C&gt;be free in the mind, although you are slave: and thus you will no longer be a slave&lt;U+201D&gt;.<a href="#fn164" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref164"><sup>164</sup></a> This idea, repeated by the <a href="stoicism" title="wikilink">Stoics</a> and the <a href="Epicurianism" title="wikilink">Epicurians</a>, was not so much an opposition to slavery as a trivialisation of it.<a href="#fn165" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref165"><sup>165</sup></a></p>
<p>The Greeks could not comprehend an absence of slaves. Slaves exist even in the &quot;<a href="wiktionary:Cloudcuckooland" title="wikilink">Cloudcuckooland</a>&quot; of Artistophanes' <em><a href="The_Birds_(play)" title="wikilink">The Birds</a></em> as well as in the ideal cities of Plato's <em>Laws</em> or <em>Republic</em>.<a href="#fn166" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref166"><sup>166</sup></a> The utopian cities of <a href="Phaleas_of_Chalcedon" title="wikilink">Phaleas of Chalcedon</a> and <a href="Hippodamus_of_Miletus" title="wikilink">Hippodamus of Miletus</a> are based on the equal distribution of property, but public slaves are used respectively as craftsmen<a href="#fn167" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref167"><sup>167</sup></a> and land workers.<a href="#fn168" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref168"><sup>168</sup></a> The &quot;reversed cities&quot; placed women in power or even saw the end of private property, as in <em><a href="Lysistrata" class="uri" title="wikilink">Lysistrata</a></em> or <em><a href="Assemblywomen" class="uri" title="wikilink">Assemblywomen</a></em>, but could not picture slaves in charge of masters. The only societies without slaves were those of the <a href="Golden_Age" title="wikilink">Golden Age</a>, where all needs were met. In this type of society, as explained by Plato,<a href="#fn169" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref169"><sup>169</sup></a> one reaped generously without sowing. In Telekleides' <em>Amphictyons</em><a href="#fn170" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref170"><sup>170</sup></a> barley loaves fight with wheat loaves for the honour of being eaten by men. Moreover, objects move themselves&lt;U+2014&gt;dough kneads itself, and the jug pours itself. Society without slaves is thus relegated to a different time and space. In a &quot;normal&quot; society, one needs slaves.</p>
<h3 id="modern-views">Modern views</h3>
<p><img src="NAMA_Masque_esclave.jpg" title="fig:Theatre mask of a First slave in Greek comedy, 2nd century BC, National Archaeological Museum of Athens" alt="Theatre mask of a First slave in Greek comedy, 2nd century BC, National Archaeological Museum of Athens" width="220" /> Slavery in Greek antiquity has long been an object of <a href="apologetics" title="wikilink">apologetic</a> discourse among Christians, who awarded themselves the merit of its collapse. From the <a href="16th_century" title="wikilink">16th century</a> the discourse became moralizing in nature. The existence of <a href="colonialism" title="wikilink">colonial</a> slavery had significant impact on the debate, with some authors lending it civilizing merits and others denouncing its misdeeds.<a href="#fn171" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref171"><sup>171</sup></a> Thus <a href="Henri_Wallon" title="wikilink">Henri Wallon</a> in 1847 published a <em>History of Slavery in Antiquity</em> amongst his works for the <a href="Abolitionism" title="wikilink">abolition of slavery</a> in the <a href="French_colonial_empires" title="wikilink">French colonies</a>.</p>
<p>In the <a href="19th_century" title="wikilink">19th century</a> a politico-economic discourse emerged. It concerned itself with distinguishing the phases in the organisation of human societies and correctly identifying the place of Greek slavery. The influence of <a href="Marx" class="uri" title="wikilink">Marx</a> is decisive; for him the ancient society was characterized by development of private ownership and the dominant (and not secondary as in other pre-capitalist societies) character of slavery as a <a href="mode_of_production" title="wikilink">mode of production</a>.<a href="#fn172" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref172"><sup>172</sup></a> The <a href="positivism" title="wikilink">Positivists</a> represented by the historian <a href="Eduard_Meyer" title="wikilink">Eduard Meyer</a> (<em>Slavery in Antiquity</em>, <a href="1898" class="uri" title="wikilink">1898</a>) were soon to oppose the <a href="Marxism" title="wikilink">Marxist</a> theory. According to him slavery was the foundation of Greek democracy. It was thus a legal and social phenomena, and not economic.<a href="#fn173" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref173"><sup>173</sup></a> Current historiography developed in the <a href="20th_century" title="wikilink">20th century</a>. Led by authors such as Joseph Vogt, it saw in slavery the conditions for the development of elites. Conversely, the theory also demonstrates an opportunity for slaves to join the elite. Finally, Vogt estimates that modern society, founded on humanist values, has surpassed this level of development.<a href="#fn174" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref174"><sup>174</sup></a></p>
<p>In 2007, Greek slavery remains the subject of historiographical debate, on two questions in particular: Can it be said that ancient Greece was a &quot;slave society&quot;? Did Greek slaves comprise a <a href="social_class" title="wikilink">social class</a>?<a href="#fn175" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref175"><sup>175</sup></a></p>
