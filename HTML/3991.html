<p>Smith Act trial}}   The <strong>Smith Act trials of Communist Party leaders</strong> were a series of trials held from 1949 to 1958 in which leaders of the <a href="Communist_Party_USA" title="wikilink">Communist Party of the United States</a> (CPUSA) were accused of violating the <a href="Smith_Act" title="wikilink">Smith Act</a>, a 1940 statute that set penalties for advocating the violent overthrow of the government. The prosecution argued that the CPUSA's policies promoted violent revolution; the defendants countered that they advocated a peaceful transition to socialism, and that the <a href="First_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution" title="wikilink">First Amendment</a>'s guarantee of <a href="free_speech" title="wikilink">free speech</a> and <a href="Freedom_of_association" title="wikilink">association</a> protected their membership in a political party. The trials led to the <a href="US_Supreme_Court" title="wikilink">US Supreme Court</a> decisions <em><a href="Dennis_v._United_States" title="wikilink">Dennis v. United States</a></em> (1951) and <em><a href="Yates_v._United_States" title="wikilink">Yates v. United States</a></em> (1957).</p>
<p>The first trial, in 1949, was one of the lengthiest and most contentious trials in American history. The hearing was featured on the cover of <em><a href="Time_(magazine)" title="wikilink">Time</a></em> magazine twice, and large numbers of supporters of the communist defendants protested outside the courthouse daily. During the trial, the defense frequently antagonized the judge and prosecution, and five of the defendants were sent to jail for <a href="contempt_of_court" title="wikilink">contempt of court</a> because they disrupted the proceedings. The prosecution's case relied on undercover informants who described the goals of the CPUSA, interpreted communist texts, and testified that they believed the CPUSA advocated the violent overthrow of the US government.</p>
<p>While the first trial was under way, events outside the courtroom influenced public perception of communism: The <a href="Soviet_Union" title="wikilink">Soviet Union</a> tested its first <a href="nuclear_weapon" title="wikilink">nuclear weapon</a>, and communists prevailed in the <a href="Chinese_Civil_War" title="wikilink">Chinese Civil War</a>. Public opinion was overwhelmingly against the defendants. After a ten-month trial the jury found all eleven defendants guilty and the judge sentenced them to terms of up to five years in federal prison. When the trial concluded, the judge sent all five defense attorneys to jail for contempt of court. Two of the attorneys were subsequently <a href="Disbarment" title="wikilink">disbarred</a>.</p>
<p>After the first trial, the prosecutorsencouraged by their successtried over 100 additional CPUSA officers for violating the Smith Act. Some were tried solely because they were members of the Party. Many of these defendants had difficulty finding attorneys to represent them. The trials decimated the leadership of the CPUSA. In 1957, eight years after the first trial, the US Supreme Court's <em>Yates</em> decision signaled an end to similar prosecutions, by holding that defendants could be prosecuted only for their actions, not for their beliefs.</p>

In Europe and the US, communist parties were formed, generally allied with trade union and labor causes. During the <a href="First_Red_Scare" title="wikilink">First Red Scare</a> of 1919&lt;U+2013&gt;1920, many Americans were fearful that <a href="Bolshevism" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bolshevism</a> and <a href="anarchism" class="uri" title="wikilink">anarchism</a> would lead to disruption within the US.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> In the late 1930s, state and federal legislatures passed laws designed to expose communists, including laws requiring loyalty oaths, and laws requiring communists to register with the government. Even the <a href="American_Civil_Liberties_Union" title="wikilink">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU), a free-speech advocacy organization, passed a resolution in 1939 expelling communists from its leadership ranks.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>Following Congressional investigation of left-wing and right-wing extremist political groups in the mid 1930s, support grew for a statutory prohibition of their activities. The alliance of <a href="Nazi_Germany" title="wikilink">Nazi Germany</a> and the <a href="Soviet_Union" title="wikilink">Soviet Union</a> in the August 1939 <a href="Molotov&lt;U+2013&gt;Ribbentrop_Pact" title="wikilink">Molotov&lt;U+2013&gt;Ribbentrop Pact</a> and their invasion of Poland in September gave the movement added impetus. In 1940 the <a href="United_States_Congress" title="wikilink">Congress</a> passed the <a href="Smith_Act" title="wikilink">Smith Act</a>, which required all non-citizen adult residents to register with the government, and made it a crime &quot;to knowingly or willfully advocate ... the duty, necessity, desirability, ... of overthrowing or destroying any government in the United States by force or violence ... with the intent to cause the overthrow or destruction of any government in the United States....&quot;<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a><a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> Five million non-citizens were fingerprinted and registered following passage of the Act.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> The <a href="Smith_Act#Minneapolis_1941" title="wikilink">first persons convicted</a> under the Smith Act were members of the <a href="Socialist_Workers_Party_(United_States)" title="wikilink">Socialist Workers Party</a> (SWP) in <a href="Minneapolis" class="uri" title="wikilink">Minneapolis</a> in 1941.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> Leaders of the CPUSA, bitter rivals of the <a href="Trotskyist" class="uri" title="wikilink">Trotskyist</a> SWP, supported the Smith Act prosecution of the SWPa decision they would later regret.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> In 1943, the government used the Smith Act <a href="Smith_Act#Great_Sedition_Trial_of_1944" title="wikilink">to prosecute American Nazis</a>; that case ended in a <a href="mistrial" class="uri" title="wikilink">mistrial</a> when the judge died of a heart attack.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> Anxious to avoid alienating the Soviet Union, then an ally, the government did not prosecute any communists under the law during .<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>

<p>The perception of communism in the US was shaped by the <a href="Cold_War" title="wikilink">Cold War</a>, which began after World War II when the Soviet Union failed to uphold the commitments it made at the <a href="Yalta_Conference" title="wikilink">Yalta Conference</a>. Instead of holding elections for new governments, as agreed at Yalta, the Soviet Union occupied several <a href="Eastern_Bloc" title="wikilink">Eastern European countries</a>, leading to a strained relationship with the US. Subsequent international events served to increase the apparent danger that communism posed to Americans: the Stalinist threats in the <a href="Greek_Civil_War" title="wikilink">Greek Civil War</a> (1946&lt;U+2013&gt;1949); the <a href="Czechoslovak_coup_d&#39;&lt;U+00E9&gt;tat_of_1948" title="wikilink">Czechoslovak coup d'&lt;U+00E9&gt;tat of 1948</a>; and the 1948 <a href="Berlin_Blockade" title="wikilink">blockade of Berlin</a>.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
<p>The view of communism was also affected by evidence of espionage in the US conducted by agents of the USSR. In 1945, a Soviet spy, <a href="Elizabeth_Bentley" title="wikilink">Elizabeth Bentley</a>, repudiated the USSR and provided a list of Soviet spies in the US to the <a href="Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation" title="wikilink">Federal Bureau of Investigation</a> (FBI).<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> The FBI also had access to secret Soviet communications, available from the <a href="Venona" class="uri" title="wikilink">Venona</a> decryption effort, which revealed significant efforts by Soviet agents to conduct espionage within the US.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a><a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> The growing influence of communism around the world and the evidence of Soviet spies within the US motivated the Department of Justicespearheaded by the FBIto initiate an investigation of communists within the US.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a></p>

<p>Before the trial began, supporters of the defendants decided on a campaign of letter-writing and demonstrations: the CPUSA urged its members to bombard Truman with letters requesting that the charges be dropped.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> Later, supporters similarly flooded Judge Medina with telegrams and letters urging him to dismiss the charges.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> During the proceedings, there were days when several thousand picketers protested in <a href="Foley_Square" title="wikilink">Foley Square</a> outside the courthouse, chanting slogans like &quot;Adolf Hitler never died / He's sitting at Medina's side&quot;.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> In response, the <a href="US_House_of_Representatives" title="wikilink">US House of Representatives</a> passed a bill in August to outlaw picketing near federal courthouses, but the <a href="US_senate" title="wikilink">Senate</a> did not vote on it before the end of the trial.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a><a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a></p>

<p><a href="Third_party_(United_States)" title="wikilink">Third-party</a> presidential candidate <a href="Henry_A._Wallace" title="wikilink">Henry A.

<p>The defense was not optimistic about the probability of success.

<p>Calomiris was recruited by the FBI in 1942 and infiltrated the CPUSA, gaining access to a membership roster.<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a> She received a salary from the FBI during her seven years as an informant.<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a> Calomiris identified four of the defendants as members of the CPUSA and provided information about its organization.<a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a> She testified that the CPUSA espoused violent revolution against the government, and that the CPUSAacting on instructions from Moscowhad attempted to recruit members working in key war industries.<a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a></p>
<p>Budenz, a former communist, was another important witness for the prosecution who testified that the CPUSA subscribed to a philosophy of violent overthrow of the government.<a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a> He also testified that the clauses of the constitution of the CPUSA that disavowed violence were decoys written in &quot;Aesopean language&quot; which were put in place specifically to protect the CPUSA from prosecution.<a href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a></p>

<p>The defense employed a three-pronged strategy: First, they sought to portray the CPUSA as a conventional political party, which promoted socialism by peaceful means; second, they attacked the trial as a capitalist venture which could never provide a fair outcome for proletarian defendants; and third, they used the trial as an opportunity to publicize CPUSA policies.<a href="#fn70" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a></p>
<p>A primary theme of the defense was that the CPUSA sought to convert the US to socialism by education, not by force.<a href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a> The defense claimed that most of the prosecution's documentary evidence came from older texts that pre-dated the 1935 Seventh World Congress of the <a href="Comintern" class="uri" title="wikilink">Comintern</a>, after which the CPUSA rejected violence as a means of change.<a href="#fn72" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref72"><sup>72</sup></a> The defense attempted to introduce documents into evidence which represented the CPUSA's advocacy of peace, claiming that these policies superseded the older texts that the prosecution had introduced which emphasized violence.<a href="#fn73" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref73"><sup>73</sup></a> Medina excluded most of the material proposed by the defense because it did not directly pertain to the specific documents the prosecution had produced. As a result, the defense complained that they were unable to portray the totality of their belief system to the jury.<a href="#fn74" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref74"><sup>74</sup></a></p>
<p>The defense attorneys developed a &quot;labor defense&quot; strategy, by which they attacked the entire trial process, including the prosecutor, the judge, and the jury selection process.<a href="#fn75" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref75"><sup>75</sup></a> The strategy involved verbally disparaging the judge and the prosecutors, and may have been an attempt to provoke a mistrial.<a href="#fn76" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref76"><sup>76</sup></a> Another aspect of the labor defense was an effort to rally popular support to free the defendants, in the hope that public pressure would help achieve acquittals.<a href="#fn77" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref77"><sup>77</sup></a> Throughout the course of the trial, thousands of supporters of the defendants flooded the judge with protests, and marched outside the courthouse in Foley Square. The defense used the trial as an opportunity to educate the public about their beliefs, so they focused their defense around the political aspects of communism, rather than rebutting the legal aspects of the prosecution's evidence.<a href="#fn78" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref78"><sup>78</sup></a> Defendant Dennis chose to represent himself so he could, in his role as attorney, directly address the jury and explain communist principles.<a href="#fn79" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref79"><sup>79</sup></a></p>

<p>The defense deliberately antagonized the judge by making a large number of objections and motions,<a href="#fn80" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref80"><sup>80</sup></a> which led to numerous bitter engagements between the attorneys and Judge Medina.<a href="#fn81" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref81"><sup>81</sup></a> Despite the aggressive defense tactics and a voluminous letter-writing campaign directed at Medina, he stated &quot;I will not be intimidated&quot;.<a href="#fn82" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref82"><sup>82</sup></a> Out of the chaos, an atmosphere of &quot;mutual hostility&quot; arose between the judge and attorneys.<a href="#fn83" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref83"><sup>83</sup></a> Judge Medina attempted to maintain order by removing disorderly defendants.

He instructed the jury that the prosecution was not required to prove that the danger of violence was &quot;clear and present&quot;; instead, the jury should consider if the defendants had advocated communist policy as a &quot;rule or principle of action&quot; with the intention of inciting overthrow by violence &quot;as speedily as circumstances would permit&quot;.<a href="#fn95" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref95"><sup>95</sup></a> This instruction was in response to the defendants, who endorsed the &quot;<a href="clear_and_present_danger" title="wikilink">clear and present danger</a>&quot; test, yet that test was not adopted as law by the Supreme Court.<a href="#fn96" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref96"><sup>96</sup></a> The judge's instructions included the phrase &quot;I find as a matter of law that there is sufficient danger of a substantive evil ...&quot; which would later be challenged by the defense during their appeals.<a href="#fn97" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref97"><sup>97</sup></a> After deliberating for seven and one-half hours, the jury returned guilty verdicts against all eleven defendants.<a href="#fn98" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref98"><sup>98</sup></a> The judge sentenced ten defendants to five years and a $10,000 fine each ($ in  dollars).

<p>Immediately after the jury rendered a verdict, Medina turned to the defense attorneys saying he had some &quot;unfinished business&quot; and he held them in contempt of court, and sentenced all of them to jail terms ranging from 30 days to six months; Dennis, acting as his own attorney, was also cited.<a href="#fn101" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref101"><sup>101</sup></a><a href="#fn102" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref102"><sup>102</sup></a> Since the contempt sentences were based on behavior witnessed by the judge, no hearings were required for the contempt charges, and the attorneys were immediately handcuffed and led to jail.<a href="#fn103" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref103"><sup>103</sup></a><a href="#fn104" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref104"><sup>104</sup></a></p>

<p>While waiting for their legal appeals to be heard, the CPUSA leaders became convinced that the government would undertake the prosecution of many additional Party officers.

<li id="fn217">In a concurring opinion Justice Black wrote: &quot;Doubtlessly, dictators have to stamp out causes and beliefs which they deem subversive to their evil regimes. But governmental suppression of causes and beliefs seems to me to be the very antithesis of what our Constitution stands for. The choice expressed in the First Amendment in favor of free expression was made against a turbulent background by men such as Jefferson, Madison, and Masonmen who believed that loyalty to the provisions of this Amendment was the best way to assure a long life for this new nation and its Government.... The First Amendment provides the only kind of security system that can preserve a free governmentone that leaves the way wide open for people to favor, discuss, advocate, or incite causes and doctrines however obnoxious and antagonistic such views may be to the rest of us.&quot; &lt;U+2013&gt; Black quoted by Mason, Alpheus Thomas, <em>The Supreme Court from Taft to Burger</em>, LSU Press, 1979, pp 37, 162, ISBN 9780807104699.
