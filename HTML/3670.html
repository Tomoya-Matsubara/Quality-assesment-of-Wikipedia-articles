It an individual race, covering approximately  of terrain.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> First staged in 1992, the three day race tests athletes with its 8000 (approx.) meters of elevation gain and strong climate changes. The event is also open to amateurs, having a 12-hour window to finish each stage, if competitors do not finish they are still welcome to race the next day but their cumulative times will not count on the overall results. &lt;U+201C&gt;La Ruta de los Conquistadores pushes some of the world&lt;U+2019&gt;s strongest mountain bikers to their limits on one of the toughest, most beautiful courses on Earth.&lt;U+201D&gt;<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> Kevin Vermaak, founder of the <a href="Cape_Epic" title="wikilink">Cape Epic</a> event in South Africa, took inspiration in La Ruta de los Conquistadores.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="origins">Origins</h2>
<p>La Ruta de los Conquistadores, also widely known simply as La Ruta, was born in an effort to call the attention of the media, both nationally (in Costa Rica) and internationally, to the importance of the conservation of the flora and fauna of the country. La Ruta began as an ecological expedition following the paths of the Spanish Conquerors, Juan de Cavall&lt;U+00F3&gt;n, Peraf&lt;U+00E1&gt;n de Ribera and Juan V&lt;U+00E1&gt;zquez de Coronado during their expeditions around 1653-1660.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>The actual race was started in 1993 by Rom&lt;U+00E1&gt;n Urbina, a renowned athlete and adventurer, also nominee for the mountain bike hall of fame for his work with La Ruta.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> Along with some friends, Urbina decided to follow the steps of the Spanish Conquerors on his mountain bike for fun, realized how great of an event it could be and turned it into an international event since its first edition.</p>
<h2 id="route">Route</h2>
<p>The route traverses Costa Rica in three days, from the west coast town of Jac&lt;U+00F3&gt; to Bonita beach in the Caribbean Coast. The complete trajectory is of approximately 400 kilometers, although it varies slightly each year. It follows the footsteps of the Conquistadors crossing rivers, valleys and climbing mountains. The highest point of elevation in the three day course is the Irazu Volcano, at 3,300 meters (approx. 11,000 feet)<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p>The race has a three day point to point format, which means each racer must make it from start to finish in a certain amount of time. There are four check points, which also serve as <a href="aid_station" title="wikilink">aid stations</a>, per day, located every 25 km through the race course. A time limit is held in every aid station, if a racer does not make it in time to that certain aid station he or she will be picked up by a rescue truck and taken to the finish line.</p>

<h3 id="individual">Individual</h3>
<p>La Ruta de los Conquistadores is an individual point to point mountain bike multi stage race. Racers may wear matching jerseys as camaraderie or support, but at the end of the day each racer will be judged individually by their time in each one of the stages. </p>

<h2 id="stages">Stages</h2>
<h3 id="stage-1-juan-de-cavallu00f3n">Stage 1: Juan de Cavall&lt;U+00F3&gt;n</h3>
<p>Day one of La Ruta de los Conquistadores is named after Juan de Cavall&lt;U+00F3&gt;n, a very important conquistador in Costa Rica.</p>
<p>This stage begins on the Pacific Coast in the beach of Jac&lt;U+00F3&gt;, located in the province of Puntarenas and ends in Hacienda El Rodeo in the province of San Jos&lt;U+00E9&gt; (Costa Rica&lt;U+2019&gt;s capital). During this stage competitors ride  approximately. The elevation gain of day one is of  approx. The altitude change riders experience is from 12 meters sea level, to 650 meters sea level, to 1201 meters sea level, to 490 meters sea level, finishing at 855 meters sea level. The climate during day one of La Ruta is Tropical Dry, ranging from 30 to 35 degrees Celsius.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<p>La Ruta's day one starts at 6:00 am and gives competitors until 5:30 pm (11.5 hours) to complete the 110 km route before being picked up by the rescue truck and disqualified from the overall results. From sea level, riders climb numerous hills that hit riders with a total elevation gain of approximately 12,000+ feet. That's why Day 1 is known by competitors as the &quot;make it or break it day&quot;. Riders must expect all kinds of riding conditions this day: mud, gravel, asphalt, and loose rocks. Temperatures will be very high in the lowlands, as high as 105 degrees F and cooler in the mountains.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li>Stage starts at 6:00am</li>
<li>Finish line closes up at 5:45pm</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="stage-2-perafu00e1n-de-ribera">Stage 2: Peraf&lt;U+00E1&gt;n de Ribera</h3>
<p>The second day of La Ruta de los Conquistadores begins in Tres R&lt;U+00ED&gt;os, located in the province of Cartago and ends in Turrialba, also located in Cartago. During this stage competitors ride  approximately.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> The elevation gain of day two is of about . The altitude change is 1291 meters over sea level, to 3025 meters over sea level, to 607 meters over sea level.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> The climate during the Peraf&lt;U+00E1&gt;n de Ribera stage consists mostly of wind and rain, with a temperature range of 5 to 8 degrees Celsius, and drastic climate changes. Hypothermia is usually a problem during this stage. The terrain is 20% pavement, 20% volcanic rocks and ash, 30% steep uphill and 30% technical downhill.</p>
<p>Day 2 also starts at the crack of dawn and racers have until 5pm to finish. The 79 km feature a fearsome climb of about 6,000 feet, from Tres R&lt;U+00ED&gt;os straight up the Iraz&lt;U+00FA&gt; Volcano, with the high probability of bitterly cold weather much of the day. Starting at 1291 meters above sea level, the ride is a never-ending ascent until competitors reach 3025m (about 10,000 feet).<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> Then it levels off, passes the Turrialba Volcano, and starts one of the fastest and longest downhills in Costa Rica, finishing in the town of Turrialba at an elevation of 607m (about 2,000) feet. On this day, it is very important to have well-functioning brakes and be prepared for cold weather riding. At 10,000 feet with wind and rain, hypothermia is a risk, as it can get near freezing.</p>
<ul>
<li>Stage starts ar 6:00am</li>
<li>Finish line closes up at 5:45pm</li>
