<p>The <strong>peppered maskray</strong> or <strong>speckled maskray</strong> (<em>Neotrygon picta</em>) is a <a href="species" class="uri" title="wikilink">species</a> of <a href="stingray" class="uri" title="wikilink">stingray</a> in the <a href="family_(biology)" title="wikilink">family</a> <a href="Dasyatidae" class="uri" title="wikilink">Dasyatidae</a>, found in shallow waters off northeastern Australia. This small, thin-bodied ray attains a maximum width of . It has a diamond-shaped <a href="pectoral_fin" title="wikilink">pectoral fin</a> disc with a row of tiny thorns along the midline, and a relatively short, whip-like tail with both upper and lower fin folds. Its upper surface has a speckled color pattern consisting of black spots and brownish reticulations on a light yellow to brown background.</p>
<p>Favoring soft-bottomed habitats, the peppered maskray is a <a href="benthic_fish" title="wikilink">bottom-dwelling</a> <a href="predator" class="uri" title="wikilink">predator</a> consuming mainly <a href="crustacean" title="wikilink">crustaceans</a> (particularly <a href="Caridea" title="wikilink">caridean shrimp</a>) and <a href="polychaete_worm" title="wikilink">polychaete worms</a>. It is <a href="viviparous" class="uri" title="wikilink">viviparous</a>, with litter sizes of one to three. The females supply their developing young with <a href="histotroph" class="uri" title="wikilink">histotroph</a> (&quot;uterine milk&quot;) during <a href="gestation" class="uri" title="wikilink">gestation</a>. Although the peppered maskray is a frequent <a href="bycatch" class="uri" title="wikilink">bycatch</a> of <a href="bottom_trawl" title="wikilink">bottom trawl</a> <a href="fisheries" class="uri" title="wikilink">fisheries</a>, it is still common and significant portions of its population appear to lie within unfished waters. As a result, the <a href="International_Union_for_Conservation_of_Nature" title="wikilink">International Union for Conservation of Nature</a> (IUCN) has assessed it as <a href="Least_Concern" title="wikilink">Least Concern</a>.</p>

<p>Once thought to be a <a href="color_morph" title="wikilink">color morph</a> of the <a href="painted_maskray" title="wikilink">painted maskray</a> (<em>N. leylandi</em>), the peppered maskray was recognized as a distinct species based on <a href="DNA_barcoding" title="wikilink">molecular data</a> collected for the <a href="Barcode_of_Life" title="wikilink">Barcode of Life</a> project. It was described by <a href="Peter_R._Last" title="wikilink">Peter Last</a> and William White in a 2008 <a href="Commonwealth_Scientific_and_Industrial_Research_Organisation" title="wikilink">Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation</a> (CSIRO) publication. Their account was based on 13 specimens; of these, a female  across caught off <a href="Rockhampton" class="uri" title="wikilink">Rockhampton</a>, <a href="Queensland" class="uri" title="wikilink">Queensland</a> was designated as the <a href="holotype" class="uri" title="wikilink">holotype</a>. The <a href="specific_name_(zoology)" title="wikilink">specific epithet</a> <em>picta</em> is derived from the <a href="Latin" class="uri" title="wikilink">Latin</a> <em>pictus</em> (&quot;painted&quot; or &quot;colored&quot;).<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> <a href="Phylogenetic" class="uri" title="wikilink">Phylogenetic</a> analysis using <a href="mitochondrial_DNA" title="wikilink">mitochondrial</a> and <a href="nuclear_DNA" title="wikilink">nuclear DNA</a> has found that the peppered and painted maskrays are <a href="sister_species" title="wikilink">sister species</a>. The two are estimated to have <a href="speciation" title="wikilink">diverged</a> <em>c.</em> 10 <a href="Ma_(unit)" title="wikilink">Ma</a>, during the <a href="Miocene" class="uri" title="wikilink">Miocene</a>.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="description">Description</h2>
<p>The peppered maskray has a thin, diamond-shaped <a href="pectoral_fin" title="wikilink">pectoral fin</a> disc roughly 1.2 times wider than long, with slightly concave leading margins and narrowly rounded outer corners. The snout forms an obtuse angle and has a pointed tip. The small, closely spaced eyes are followed by crescent-shaped <a href="spiracle" title="wikilink">spiracles</a>. The nostrils are elongated and have a skirt-shaped curtain of skin between them; the posterior margin of the curtain is fringed and forms two lobes. The small mouth is surrounded by <a href="papilla_(fish_anatomy)" title="wikilink">papillae</a> and bears prominent furrows at the corners. There are two papillae on the floor of the mouth. The teeth number 33&lt;U+2013&gt;38 rows in the upper jaw and 31&lt;U+2013&gt;40 rows in the lower; the teeth are small and vary from pointed to blunt. The five pairs of <a href="gill_slit" title="wikilink">gill slits</a> are S-shaped. The <a href="pelvic_fin" title="wikilink">pelvic fins</a> are medium-sized and triangular with angular corners.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a><a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>The whip-like tail measures 1.0&lt;U+2013&gt;1.3 times as long as the disc and bears slender stinging spines on the upper surface; smaller rays usually have one sting, larger rays two. The tail is moderately broad and flattened at the base, becoming very thin behind the sting. Both upper and lower fin folds are present past the sting, with the upper fold shorter than the lower. There are up to 22 small, closely spaced thorns along the midline of the back behind the spiracles; otherwise, the skin is mostly smooth. This species is light yellow to brown above, with a darker reticulated pattern that may vary from faint to obvious, all overlaid by numerous black spots. Like other <em>Neotrygon</em> species, there is a dark marking across the eyes that resembles a mask. The tail has a pattern of saddles or bands behind the sting; the tip is white and the ventral fin fold darkens to almost black posteriorly. The underside is plain white.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a><a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> This species reaches  across.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="distribution-and-habitat">Distribution and habitat</h2>
<p>The range of the peppered maskray extends along the coast of northeastern Australia, from at least the <a href="Wessel_Islands" title="wikilink">Wessel Islands</a> off <a href="Northern_Territory" title="wikilink">Northern Territory</a> to <a href="Hervey_Bay" title="wikilink">Hervey Bay</a> in Queensland; the western boundary of its range is uncertain. It may also be found off <a href="New_Guinea" title="wikilink">New Guinea</a>, though this is unconfirmed.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> This species is extremely common in some areas, such as the <a href="Gulf_of_Carpentaria" title="wikilink">Gulf of Carpentaria</a>.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> A <a href="benthic_fish" title="wikilink">benthic fish</a>, it is usually found on the inner <a href="continental_shelf" title="wikilink">continental shelf</a> in water less than  deep, but may occur down to .<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> It favors <a href="habitat" title="wikilink">habitats</a> with sandy or other fine <a href="substrate_(marine_biology)" title="wikilink">substrate</a>.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="biology-and-ecology">Biology and ecology</h2>
<p>The peppered maskray prefers to pick prey from the surface of the substrate, as opposed to digging for them. <a href="Caridea" title="wikilink">Caridean shrimp</a> are by far the most important food source. It also consumes <a href="polychaete_worm" title="wikilink">polychaete worms</a> and <a href="amphipod" title="wikilink">amphipods</a>, and rarely <a href="Penaeidae" title="wikilink">penaeid prawns</a>, <a href="mollusc" title="wikilink">molluscs</a>, and small <a href="bony_fish" title="wikilink">bony fishes</a>. Compared to smaller rays, larger rays have a more varied diet that incorporates a greater proportion of polychaete worms.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a><a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<p>Reproduction in the peppered maskray is <a href="viviparous" class="uri" title="wikilink">viviparous</a>; like other stingrays, the developing <a href="embryo" title="wikilink">embryos</a> are initially nourished by <a href="yolk" class="uri" title="wikilink">yolk</a> and later by <a href="histotroph" class="uri" title="wikilink">histotroph</a> (&quot;uterine milk&quot;) provided by the mother. Mature females have a single functional <a href="ovary" class="uri" title="wikilink">ovary</a> and <a href="uterus" class="uri" title="wikilink">uterus</a>, on the left side.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> Females give birth to litters of one to three pups, probably once per year.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> The newborns are  across.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> Males and females reach <a href="sexual_maturity" title="wikilink">sexual maturity</a> at around  across respectively. The <a href="maximum_lifespan" title="wikilink">maximum lifespan</a> is at least 11 years for males and 18 years for females.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="human-interactions">Human interactions</h2>
<p>The peppered maskray lacks economic value and is discarded by <a href="fisheries" class="uri" title="wikilink">fisheries</a>. It is often <a href="bycatch" title="wikilink">caught incidentally</a> in <a href="bottom_trawl" title="wikilink">bottom trawls</a>, and due to its small size does not benefit from <a href="Turtle_Exclusion_Device" title="wikilink">Turtle Exclusion Devices</a>. In particular, this species accounts for approximately 4.5% of the total catch of the Northern Prawn Fishery (NPF) in the Gulf of Carpentaria. Over half of the rays caught by the NPF, including almost all the males, are fatally crushed within the trawl. Despite this mortality, the NPF is not believed to have negative affected the local population because its operational area does not include the waters where this species is most abundant. The peppered maskray is also caught frequently in <a href="scallop" class="uri" title="wikilink">scallop</a> trawls operated by the Queensland East Coast Trawl Fishery. Elsewhere in its range, fishing pressure is relatively light due to external factors such as fuel prices. The <a href="International_Union_for_Conservation_of_Nature" title="wikilink">International Union for Conservation of Nature</a> (IUCN) has listed this species under <a href="Least_Concern" title="wikilink">Least Concern</a>, because it remains common and its range includes several <a href="Marine_Protected_Area" title="wikilink">Marine Protected Areas</a>.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
