<p>David Norris was born in <a href="Kinshasa" title="wikilink">Leopoldville</a> in the <a href="Belgian_Congo" title="wikilink">Belgian Congo</a>, now known as <a href="Kinshasa" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kinshasa</a>, capital of the <a href="Democratic_Republic_of_Congo" title="wikilink">Democratic Republic of Congo</a>, where his father (John Norris) worked as chief engineer for <a href="Lever_Brothers" title="wikilink">Lever Brothers</a>.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> John Norris served in the <a href="British_Armed_Forces" title="wikilink">British Armed Forces</a> during <a href="World_War_I" title="wikilink">World War I</a> and <a href="World_War_II" title="wikilink">World War II</a>; he died while Norris was still a child. David Norris was then sent to Ireland to be cared for by his mother, Aida Fitzpatrick, and her extended family.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>...while, on hearing his dad had died, he &quot;had to squeeze out tears&quot; because they were never that close, the death of his mother, was &quot;totally heartbreaking&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;It destroyed my sense of reality,&quot; he adds, now. &quot;This was somebody I loved who was there one minute, then the next minute she was gone.&quot;<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>

<p>After first meeting in 1975, Norris was in a long-term relationship with Israeli activist <a href="Ezra_Nawi" title="wikilink">Ezra Nawi</a> for a number of years until 1985.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> They continued a platonic friendship after that. In a Today FM interview with Matt Cooper in Summer 2011 Norris said (paraphrasing) &quot;nowadays people think of a romantic relationship as a sexual one and Ezra and myself have not had that kind of relationship since the 1980s.&quot;</p>

<p>After contracting the waterborne variation of <a href="Hepatitis" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hepatitis</a> while visiting Central Europe in 1994, Norris received disability payments from a private income continuance insurer worth thousands of euro over 16 years.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> Trinity College paid for this, and not the State.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a><a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> Norris left his role as a lecturer after Trinity College authorities said the situation arising from his illness was &quot;untenable&quot;, although he remained an elected senator.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> Norris was hospitalised and was seriously ill for a time as a result of the condition.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> He has rarely drunk alcohol since the diagnosis.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="campaigning-and-activism">Campaigning and activism</h2>
<p>Norris took the <a href="Attorney_General_of_Ireland" title="wikilink">Attorney General</a> to the <a href="High_Court_(Ireland)" title="wikilink">High Court</a> over the criminalisation of homosexual acts. His claim was based on the fact that the law infringed on his right to privacy and that since the introduction of the <a href="Constitution_of_Ireland" title="wikilink">Constitution of Ireland</a> the law passed under British rule became repugnant to the constitution. The High Court ruled against Norris. He appealed his case to the <a href="Supreme_Court_of_Ireland" title="wikilink">Supreme Court of Ireland</a>.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> In 1983, the Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the law by a three to two verdict.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a><a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a></p>
<p>Having lost the Supreme Court case, Norris took his case to the <a href="European_Court_of_Human_Rights" title="wikilink">European Court of Human Rights</a> (See <a href="Norris_v._Ireland" title="wikilink">Norris v. Ireland</a>). In 1988, the European Court ruled that the law criminalising same sex activities was contrary to the <a href="European_Convention_on_Human_Rights" title="wikilink">European Convention on Human Rights</a>, in particular Article 8 which protects the right to respect for private life. The law was held to infringe on the right of adults to engage in acts of their own choice.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The first and immediate thing about the European decision is the enlargement of dignity and freedom for gay people &lt;U+2013&gt; but I think a decision like this enhances the dignity and freedom of all the people of Ireland because it pushes us towards a more tolerant and plural society.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>This law was repealed in 1993.</p>
<p>Norris has since then expanded his activism to a concept of &quot;universal rights&quot;.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I did start out on that campaign [for homosexual law reform] but I found very quickly that the mechanism of discrimination was exactly the same against women, against ethnic minorities, against the handicapped, so I broadened out and this now is how I see things, very much so.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a></p>

<h4 id="entry">Entry</h4>
<p>In March 2011, Norris announced his intention to run in the 2011 Irish presidential election.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> <a href="Facebook" class="uri" title="wikilink">Facebook</a> support for a presidential bid drew comparisons with <a href="Barack_Obama" title="wikilink">Barack Obama</a>'s campaign for the American presidency.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> Norris topped multiple opinion polls as the person most Irish people would like to see as their next president (with the caveat that these polls have been taken before all candidates have declared).<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a><a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a><a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a><a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a><a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a><a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a><a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> Internal research by Fine Gael also placed Norris ahead of all other potential candidates.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a></p>
<p>On 14 March 2011, Norris launched his campaign to secure a nomination.<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> On 9 May 2011, he was nominated by <a href="Fingal_County_Council" title="wikilink">Fingal County Council</a>.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a> By the end of that month, he had secured the support of 6 <a href="Teachta_D&lt;U+00E1&gt;la" title="wikilink">TDs</a>.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a> <a href="Fine_Gael" title="wikilink">Fine Gael</a> ordered its councillors to block Norris's nomination.<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a> In late May, controversial comments Norris allegedly made in 2002 were raised on a talk radio show. Norris called this an attempt to &quot;sabotage&quot; his campaign. He said the quotes had been taken out of context.<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a></p>
<p>Norris's candidacy was endorsed by British actor and writer <a href="Stephen_Fry" title="wikilink">Stephen Fry</a>, who said Ireland &quot;couldn't have a more intelligent passionate and knowledgeable witty or committed President&quot;.<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a></p>
<p>In late July, it was revealed that Norris had written a letter in 1992 (29 August 1992) to an Israeli court asking <a href="pardon" title="wikilink">clemency</a> for his former partner <a href="Ezra_Nawi" title="wikilink">Ezra Nawi</a>, who had been convicted of the <a href="statutory_rape" title="wikilink">statutory rape</a> of a 15-year-old Palestinian boy in 1992 but was awaiting sentencing. Norris's letter, written on parliamentary notepaper, said that Nawi had been lured into a &quot;carefully prepared trap&quot; and had unwisely pleaded guilty to the charges. The story was publicised by a pro-Israel blogger <a href="John_Connolly_(journalist)" title="wikilink">John Connolly</a>. Connolly stated that he had received a tip from &quot;someone in the trade union movement&quot;.<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a> A number of people resigned from Norris's campaign team. While Norris himself said he remained committed to his campaign, he admitted that it was now &quot;in serious trouble&quot;.<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a> It was claimed by some that these allegations, complete with Norris's subsequent defence of his comments on <a href="pederasty_in_ancient_Greece" title="wikilink">pederasty in ancient Greece</a> would seriously damage his chances of securing a nomination.<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a><a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a> Norris refuted this, saying he still expected to receive a nomination,<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a> and the controversy did not affect his poll standings.<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a></p>
<h4 id="withdrawal">Withdrawal</h4>
<p>As of 22 July, Norris had secured the support of 15 of the 20 members of the Oireachtas required for a nomination.<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a> On 1 August, the <a href="Independent_(politician)" title="wikilink">Independent</a> TDs <a href="John_Halligan_(politician)" title="wikilink">John Halligan</a>, <a href="Finian_McGrath" title="wikilink">Finian McGrath</a> and <a href="Thomas_Pringle_(Irish_politician)" title="wikilink">Thomas Pringle</a> announced that they were withdrawing their support for Norris over the revelations of the Nawi plea.<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a><a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a> However, several other TDs re-iterated their support for Norris in his bid to become President. <a href="Maureen_O&#39;Sullivan_(politician)" title="wikilink">Maureen O'Sullivan</a>, TD referred to a &quot;nasty campaign&quot; when expressing her continued support for Norris.<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a> <a href="Wicklow_(D&lt;U+00E1&gt;il_&lt;U+00C9&gt;ireann_constituency)" title="wikilink">Wicklow</a> TD <a href="Stephen_Donnelly" title="wikilink">Stephen Donnelly</a> said he believed it was wrong for Norris to have used <a href="Oireachtas" class="uri" title="wikilink">Oireachtas</a> headed notepaper, while <a href="Mick_Wallace" title="wikilink">Mick Wallace</a>, TD said he believed Norris should not have sent the plea.

<h4 id="re-entry">Re-entry</h4>

<p>Despite withdrawing from the presidential race in July 2011, Norris maintained considerable and, in some cases, increased public support. A poll taken one week after Norris withdrew from the presidential race, showed a large increase in public support for his Presidency if they were given the choice to vote for him (topping the poll by a considerable margin) with 40 per cent of respondents now saying they would vote Norris number one in the <a href="proportional_representation" title="wikilink">proportional representation</a> electorial system and 50 per cent saying they would give him a vote.<a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a></p>
<p>In <a href="Galway" class="uri" title="wikilink">Galway</a> city alone, more than 1,000 signatures in support of Norris for President were gathered from members of the public in just 12 hours on the weekend of 11 September.<a href="#fn69" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref69"><sup>69</sup></a> There was a similar result in the city of <a href="Cork_(city)" title="wikilink">Cork</a>.<a href="#fn70" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a> Days later, Norris was presented with a petition of 10,000 signatures, collected nationwide, by the We Want Norris campaign outside Leinster House.<a href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a> As a result Norris announced his return to the campaign on the Irish television talk programme <em><a href="The_Late_Late_Show" title="wikilink">The Late Late Show</a></em> on Friday 16 September 2011, though he did not reveal the precise number of signatures belonging to TDs and Senators that he had secured.<a href="#fn72" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref72"><sup>72</sup></a> A <em>Sunday Independent</em>/Millward Brown Lansdowne opinion poll published on 18 September showed a high amount of popular support for Senator David Norris of 34 per cent.<a href="#fn73" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref73"><sup>73</sup></a></p>
<p>Despite attempts, Norris didn't receive sufficient support from Oireachtas members to gain a nomination, having been nominated by 18 members, two short of the minimum number of 20. However, he received a nomination from four county councils (Fingal, Laois, Waterford and Dublin City), which is sufficient to gain a nomination.<a href="#fn74" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref74"><sup>74</sup></a><a href="#fn75" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref75"><sup>75</sup></a><a href="#fn76" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref76"><sup>76</sup></a> He was assisted by his rival, <a href="Labour_Party_(Ireland)" title="wikilink">Labour Party</a> candidate <a href="Michael_D._Higgins" title="wikilink">Michael D.

<p>According to <em><a href="The_Irish_Times" title="wikilink">The Irish Times</a></em> Norris had four times as many followers on <a href="Twitter" class="uri" title="wikilink">Twitter</a> as any of the other candidates as of 30 September.<a href="#fn79" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref79"><sup>79</sup></a></p>

<p>Norris is a <a href="Christianity" title="wikilink">Christian</a> and regularly attends <a href="Church_of_Ireland" title="wikilink">Church of Ireland</a> services. He said the following of his religious beliefs:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I am the kind of Christian who believes that the most important theological principle is the principle of positive doubt. Even Christ doubted, on the cross. And I think if people say they hear the voice of God all the time and say they know what to do, then impose that on you, politically, it is theological tyranny. Whereas if you have doubt, it stops you from abusing your religious belief. Religion can be so abused in the interests of power, especially on behalf of institutions and governments.<a href="#fn89" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref89"><sup>89</sup></a></p>

<p>Norris believes himself to be an &quot;outsider&quot; of &quot;accepted society&quot; and claims this gives him a heightened awareness of other minority or &quot;outsider&quot; groups.

<blockquote>
<p>The blunt instrument of criminalisation is not working because of the vast profits it generates for organised crime ... my view is that the welfare of the community, including the victims of drug abuse, may be better served by having access to quality controlled, legally prescribed drugs.<a href="#fn92" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref92"><sup>92</sup></a><a href="#fn93" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref93"><sup>93</sup></a></p>

Norris criticized that the film had been <a href="News_leak" title="wikilink">leaked</a> beforehand and that &lt;U+00D3&gt; Searcaigh had been treated harshly by the media before its broadcast. He announced to the Seanad that the film should be checked for factuality, because he claimed that &quot;public money&quot; had been spent on it. The issue was conveyed to Deputy <a href="John_Cregan_(Irish_politician)" title="wikilink">John Cregan</a>, the Chairman of the <em>Joint Committee on Communications, Energy and Natural Resources</em>.<a href="#fn94" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref94"><sup>94</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="easter-rising-comments">Easter Rising comments</h3>
<p>An article in <em><a href="The_Sunday_Times" title="wikilink">The Sunday Times</a></em> claimed that Norris had, on more than one occasion, denounced the leaders of the 1916 <a href="Easter_Rising" title="wikilink">Easter Rising</a> as &quot;<a href="terrorism" title="wikilink">terrorists</a>&quot;.<a href="#fn95" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref95"><sup>95</sup></a> In May 2011, Norris denied that article's claim also, saying &quot;That's not true, it's a slur, and it's not fair on me. Terrorists are people who use civilian casualties to advance a political end. The men of 1916 produced the proclamation, addressed equally &lt;U+2013&gt; in an age when women didn't have the vote - to 'Irishmen and Irishwomen', that's wonderful!&quot;.<a href="#fn96" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref96"><sup>96</sup></a> The newspaper printed a retraction.</p>
<h3 id="criticism-of-pope-john-paul-ii">Criticism of Pope John Paul II</h3>
<p>Norris has made statements about Catholic social teaching on homosexuality, particularly in relation to the Papacy. He criticised <a href="Pope_John_Paul_II" title="wikilink">Pope John Paul II</a> for attacking homosexuality because the pope's hostile remarks led to anti-gay violence, saying that the pope was an &quot;instrument for evil as far as I'm concerned because these constant, unremitting, ignorant, ill-informed attacks on the gay community have led to violence against the gay community&quot;. Norris also described the pope's position as &quot;calculated and deliberate wickedness&quot; because he &quot;closes down scholarly enquiry&quot; and because he &quot;marginalised all the wonderful people like Oscar Romero, Leonardo Boff, Hans Kung, Charles Curran, all these marvellous people who are the future and the hope of the Church and, instead, put into place these mindless bureaucrats, which is intensely sad.&quot;<a href="#fn97" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref97"><sup>97</sup></a> Commenting on then <a href="Pope_Benedict_XVI" title="wikilink">Cardinal Ratzinger</a>, he said, &quot;Ratzinger, who is, in his mind-set, a <a href="Nazi" class="uri" title="wikilink">Nazi</a>&quot; because he is &quot;afraid to tell the truth,&quot; and because he and John Paul II &quot;won't even let themselves be in the presence of the truth, because it would shatter their very stylised view of things.&quot;<a href="#fn98" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref98"><sup>98</sup></a> He later stated that he regretted using the term &quot;Nazi&quot; in reference to Ratzinger.<a href="#fn99" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref99"><sup>99</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="magill-magazine-interview">2002 <em>Magill</em> magazine interview</h3>
<p>In a January 2002 interview for politics/current affairs magazine <em><a href="Magill" class="uri" title="wikilink">Magill</a></em>, Norris discussed the <a href="age_of_consent" title="wikilink">age of consent</a>, <a href="incest" class="uri" title="wikilink">incest</a>, <a href="pedophilia" class="uri" title="wikilink">pedophilia</a> and <a href="pederasty" class="uri" title="wikilink">pederasty</a>.<a href="#fn100" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref100"><sup>100</sup></a> The interviewer, <a href="Food_critic" title="wikilink">restaurant critic</a> <a href="Helen_Lucy_Burke" title="wikilink">Helen Lucy Burke</a>, said, &quot;I found some of his views on sexual matters deeply disturbing - notably on sex with minors&quot;.<a href="#fn101" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref101"><sup>101</sup></a> According to Burke, Norris didn't seem to support a minimum age of consent. When asked &quot;Where would you draw the line?&quot; Norris replied, &quot;I would hope we could produce a society where people would be inclined to draw lines for themselves&quot;.<a href="#fn102" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref102"><sup>102</sup></a> On 30 May 2011, Burke was a guest on the <a href="talk_radio" title="wikilink">talk radio</a> show <em><a href="Liveline" class="uri" title="wikilink">Liveline</a></em>. Burke said that she had read the article to Norris before publication, and that he had wholeheartedly endorsed what was written. During the show, it was noted that the <em>Magill</em> article had been reported in a newspaper shortly after publication. The newspaper, <em><a href="Ireland_on_Sunday" title="wikilink">Ireland on Sunday</a></em>, went with the headline &quot;Senator Backs Sex With Children&quot;. Burke claimed that, when Norris saw the reaction to the interview, he &quot;back-tracked&quot; and denied saying what had been quoted. She also called Norris' views &quot;evil&quot; and &quot;against the law&quot;.<a href="#fn103" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref103"><sup>103</sup></a></p>
<p>According to Norris, he was only read two paragraphs of the interview before publication, and he asked for corrections to be made to those paragraphs, and these corrections were not made.<a href="#fn104" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref104"><sup>104</sup></a> In a May 2011 statement on his Presidential campaign website, Norris affirmed &quot;I did not ever and would not approve of the finished article as it appeared&quot;. Norris asserts that he and Burke engaged in an &quot;academic discussion about <a href="Classical_Greece" title="wikilink">Classical Greece</a> and sexual activity in a historical context; it was a hypothetical, intellectual conversation&quot; and that the &quot;presentation of references to sexuality in the article attributed to me were misleading in that they do not convey the context in which they were made&quot;.<a href="#fn105" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref105"><sup>105</sup></a> Norris also spoke about the <em>Magill</em> profile in an interview with Joe Jackson for the <em><a href="Sunday_Independent" title="wikilink">Sunday Independent</a></em>, in which he refutes the allegations, saying he responded in &quot;horror&quot;, and that &lt;U+201C&gt;it so completely misrepresents everything I said. In the interview I said I cannot understand how anyone would consider it appropriate to have sex with children&quot;.<a href="#fn106" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref106"><sup>106</sup></a></p>
<p>The interview was recorded and on 21 October 2011 it was played on the radio talk show <em>Liveline</em>.<a href="#fn107" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref107"><sup>107</sup></a></p>
