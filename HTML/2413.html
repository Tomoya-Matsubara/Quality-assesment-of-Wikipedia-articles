<p>The , often called the <strong>Sega Master System</strong> or <strong>SMS</strong>, is an <a href="8-bit" class="uri" title="wikilink">8-bit</a> <a href="History_of_video_game_consoles_(third_generation)" title="wikilink">third-generation video game console</a> that was manufactured by <a href="Sega" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sega</a>. It was originally released in 1985 as the <strong>Sega Mark III</strong> in <a href="Japan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Japan</a> and then redesigned and redesignated the Master System for release in 1986 in <a href="North_America" title="wikilink">North America</a>, 1987 in <a href="Europe" class="uri" title="wikilink">Europe</a> and Japan, and 1989 in <a href="Brazil" class="uri" title="wikilink">Brazil</a>. The original Master System could play both cartridges and the credit card-sized &quot;<a href="Sega_Card" title="wikilink">Sega Cards</a>,&quot; which retailed for cheaper prices than cartridges but had lower storage capacity, while later models removed the card slot. The Master System also featured accessories such as a light gun and 3D glasses which were designed to work with a range of specially coded games.</p>
<p>Succeeding the <a href="SG-1000" class="uri" title="wikilink">SG-1000</a>, the Master System was released as a direct competitor to the <a href="Nintendo_Entertainment_System" title="wikilink">Nintendo Entertainment System</a> in the <a href="History_of_video_game_consoles_(third_generation)" title="wikilink">third video game generation of video game consoles</a>. The Master System was technically superior to the NES, but failed to overturn Nintendo's significant market share advantage in Japan and North America. However, it attained more success in Europe and Brazil, where it controlled a significant portion of the market share in each region. The hardware of the Master System also served as the base structure of Sega's <a href="handheld_game_console" title="wikilink">handheld game console</a>, the <a href="Sega_Game_Gear" title="wikilink">Sega Game Gear</a>. Due to Nintendo's licensing practices with third-party developers the Master System's game library lacked a number of quality titles. Final sales estimates show the console selling 13 million units in its lifetime, compared to the 62 million NES units. Retrospective reception to the system gives credit to the system's role in Sega's development of the <a href="Sega_Genesis" title="wikilink">Sega Genesis</a>, but criticizes its shallow game library.</p>
<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<p>In the early 1980s, <a href="Sega" title="wikilink">Sega Enterprises, Inc.</a>, then a subsidiary of <a href="Gulf_and_Western" title="wikilink">Gulf and Western</a>, was one of the top five arcade game manufacturers active in the United States, as company revenues rose to $214 million.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> A downturn in the arcade business starting in 1982 seriously hurt the company, leading Gulf &amp; Western to sell its North American arcade manufacturing organization and the licensing rights for its arcade games to <a href="Bally_Manufacturing" title="wikilink">Bally Manufacturing</a>.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a><a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> The company retained Sega's North American <a href="research_and_development" title="wikilink">R&amp;D</a> operation, as well as its Japanese subsidiary, Sega of Japan. With its arcade business in decline, Gulf &amp; Western executives turned to Sega of Japan's president, <a href="Hayao_Nakayama" title="wikilink">Hayao Nakayama</a>, for advice on how to proceed. Nakayama advocated that the company leverage its hardware expertise gained through years working in the arcade industry to move into the home console market in Japan, which was in its infancy at the time.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> Nakayama received permission to proceed with this project, leading to the release of Sega's first home video game system, the SG-1000.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>The SG-1000 was first released in Japan on July 15, 1983, at a price of <a href="Japanese_yen" title="wikilink">JP&lt;U+00A5&gt;</a>15,000.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> It released on the same day as <a href="Nintendo" class="uri" title="wikilink">Nintendo</a> launched the <a href="Nintendo_Entertainment_System" title="wikilink">Famicom</a> in Japan.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> Shortly after the launch of the SG-1000, Gulf &amp; Western began to divest itself of its non-core businesses after the death of company founder <a href="Charles_Bludhorn" title="wikilink">Charles Bludhorn</a>,<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> so Nakayama and former Sega CEO <a href="David_Rosen_(business)" title="wikilink">David Rosen</a> arranged a management buyout of the Japanese subsidiary in 1984 with financial backing from CSK Corporation, a prominent Japanese software company. Nakayama was then installed as CEO of the new Sega Enterprises, Ltd.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> Following the buyout, Sega released another video game console, the SG-1000 Mark II,<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> at a price of &lt;U+00A5&gt;15,000.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> It featured a few hardware tweaks from the original model, including detachable controllers<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> and the ability to play <a href="Sega_Card" title="wikilink">Sega Card</a> games.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> The Mark II did not sell well, however, leading to Sega's decision to continue work on its video game hardware. This would result in the release of the Sega Mark III in Japan in 1985.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="launch">Launch</h3>
<p>Sega released the Mark III in Japan in October 1985, at a price of <a href="Japanese_yen" title="wikilink">JP&lt;U+00A5&gt;</a>15,000.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> Despite featuring technically more powerful hardware than its chief competition, the Famicom, the Mark III did not prove to be successful after its launch. Difficulties arose from Nintendo's licensing practices with third-party developers at the time, whereby Nintendo required that titles for the Famicom not be published on other consoles. To overcome this, Sega developed its own titles as well as obtained the rights to reprogram games from other developers, albeit with little success. <a href="NEC" class="uri" title="wikilink">NEC</a> would later use the same strategy on some of Sega's titles when developing games for the <a href="TurboGrafx-16" title="wikilink">PC Engine</a>.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
<p>Before launching the console in North America, Sega decided to restyle and rebrand the Mark III under the name Master System, similar to Nintendo's own rebranding and restyling of the Famicom into the Nintendo Entertainment System. The Master System was released in North America in 1986, at a price of <a href="United_States_dollar" title="wikilink">US$</a>200, and was packed in with <em><a href="Hang-On" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hang-On</a>/Safari Hunt</em>.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> However, as in Japan, the Master System in North America also suffered from a poor game library when compared to its competition. Against Nintendo's licensing practices, Sega had only managed to gain two third-party developers to their side: <a href="Activision" class="uri" title="wikilink">Activision</a> and <a href="Parker_Brothers" title="wikilink">Parker Brothers</a>.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> By 1988, Nintendo commanded 83% of the North American video game market share.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> At this time, Sega sold the distribution rights for the Master System in the United States to <a href="Tonka" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tonka</a>, which did not have any previous experience with electronic entertainment systems. Some of Tonka's decisions with the Master System included blocking localization of several popular video game titles. Though the distributor of the console had changed, the Master System continued to perform poorly. A re-release of the console, as the Master System, also occurred in Japan in October 1987 at a price of JP&lt;U+00A5&gt;16,800,<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> but, similar to the Mark III, was not successful.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> Neither the Mark III nor the Master System posed a serious challenge to Nintendo in Japan.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a></p>
<p>The European launch of the Master System occurred in 1987, where it was distributed by <a href="Virgin_Mastertronic" title="wikilink">Mastertronic</a> in the United Kingdom, Master Games in France, and <a href="Bertelsmann" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bertelsmann</a> in Germany.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> Mastertronic advertised the Master System as &quot;an arcade in the home&quot; and launched the system at <a href="Pound_sterling" title="wikilink">GB&lt;U+20A4&gt;</a>99. Advanced orders from retailers were positive, but Sega proved unable to deliver inventory until <a href="Boxing_Day" title="wikilink">Boxing Day</a>, causing many retailers to cancel their orders. As a result, Master Games and Mastertronic both entered financial crises and Bertlesmann vowed never to work with Sega again. Mastertronic had already sold a minority interest to <a href="Richard_Branson" title="wikilink">Richard Branson</a> and the Virgin group to enter the console business and now sold the remainder of the company to avoid bankruptcy. The newly rebranded Virgin Mastertronic then took over all European distribution in 1988.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> The Master System held a significant part of the video game console market in Europe through the release of Sega's succeeding console, the <a href="Sega_Genesis" title="wikilink">Sega Genesis</a> (known as Mega Drive in territories outside of North America). Brazil was also a successful market for the Master System, where the console was released in 1989 and distributed by <a href="Tectoy" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tectoy</a>.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="transition-to-sega-genesis-and-decline">Transition to Sega Genesis and decline</h3>
<p>Sega released the Mega Drive, a <a href="16-bit" class="uri" title="wikilink">16-bit</a> video game console, in Japan on October 29, 1988.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> In 1989, Sega was preparing to release the new Mega Drive, relabeled as Genesis, in North America. Displeased with Tonka's handling of the Master System, Sega reacquired the marketing and distribution rights to the Master System in the United States. In 1990, Sega released the remodeled Master System II, designed to be a lower-cost version of the console which also removed the Sega Card slot.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a><a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> Sega promoted it themselves, but still sold poorly in the region.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> In 1991, Nintendo was found guilty of violating <a href="United_States_antitrust_law" title="wikilink">United States antitrust law</a> and forced to abandon some of its licensing practices, but the Master System had already been in decline long before. By early 1992, Master System production ceased in North America. By the time of its discontinuation, Master System had sold between 1.5 million and 2 million units in the United States.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a><a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> The last licensed release in North America was <em><a href="Sonic_the_Hedgehog_(8-bit)" title="wikilink">Sonic the Hedgehog</a></em> in 1991.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a></p>
<p>Contrary to its performance in Japan and North America, the Master System was eventually a success in Europe, where it outsold the NES by a considerable margin.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a><a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> As late as 1993, the Master System's active <a href="Installed_base" title="wikilink">installed user base</a> in Europe was 6.25 million units, larger than that of the Mega Drive's 5.73 million base that year.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> Combined with the Mega Drive, Sega represented the majority of the console user base in Europe that year.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> The Master System's largest markets in the region were France and the United Kingdom, which had active user bases of 1.6 million and 1.35 million, respectively, in 1993.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> The remodeled Master System II also proved to be successful and helped Sega to sustain the Master System's market share in Europe. More new releases would continue into the 1990s in Europe, including <em><a href="Sonic_the_Hedgehog_2_(8-bit_video_game)" title="wikilink">Sonic the Hedgehog 2</a></em>, <em><a href="Streets_of_Rage_II" title="wikilink">Streets of Rage II</a></em>, and <em><a href="Mercs" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mercs</a></em>.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a></p>
<p>The Master System has had continued success in Brazil, where new variations have continued to be released long after the console was discontinued elsewhere. These include the Master System Compact,<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> as well as the Master System 3.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> By 2012, the Master System had sold 5 million units in Brazil.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a></p>

<p>A number of accessories were created for the Mark III and Master System, which were cross-compatible with one another. The controller for each console consists of a rectangular shape with a control pad and two buttons. Sega also introduced additional controllers, such as a bike handle controller and paddle controller for the Mark III, and a special sports controller for the Master System. A pair of 3D glasses known as SegaScope 3D were also created for games such as <em><a href="Space_Harrier" title="wikilink">Space Harrier 3D</a></em>,<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a> although Mark III users need an additional converter to use them. The Mark III also had an optional RF transmitter accessory, allowing wireless play that broadcast the game being played on a <a href="UHF" class="uri" title="wikilink">UHF</a> television signal.<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a><a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a> A <a href="light_gun" title="wikilink">light gun</a> peripheral, known as the Light Phaser, was also released.<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a> Its design was based on the weapon of the same name from the Japanese anime <em><a href="Zillion_(anime)" title="wikilink">Zillion</a></em>.<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a></p>
<p>The Master System was made in several variations. Released in 1990, the Master System II removed a number of components in order to reduce the cost of the console, including the Sega Card slot, reset button, power light, expansion port, and activation music and logo upon turning on the system.<a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a> A variation in Brazil known as the Master System 3 Compact was capable of functioning wirelessly with an RF transmitter, while Tectoy also sought to appeal to female gamers in Brazil with the Master System Girl, which was molded in bright pink plastic.

The Master System also hosted games featuring Sega's flagship character, Alex Kidd, including <em><a href="Alex_Kidd_in_Miracle_World" title="wikilink">Alex Kidd in Miracle World</a></em>. Built-in titles were common in Master System hardware, including <em><a href="Snail_Maze" title="wikilink">Snail Maze</a></em> and <em>Hang-On</em>, as well as <em>Alex Kidd in Miracle World</em> and <em>Sonic the Hedgehog</em>. Additional titles were also released in Brazil by Tectoy, including ports of <em><a href="Street_Fighter_II" title="wikilink">Street Fighter II</a></em> and <em><a href="Dynamite_Headdy" title="wikilink">Dynamite Headdy</a></em> after the Master System was discontinued elsewhere.<a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a></p>
<p>Given Nintendo's licensing practices preventing third-party developers from creating games for the Master System, the game library has been criticized for its lack of depth. <em><a href="Computer_Gaming_World" title="wikilink">Computer Gaming World</a></em> compared new Sega titles to &quot;drops of water in the desert&quot;.<a href="#fn69" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref69"><sup>69</sup></a> According to Damien McFerran, &quot;Nintendo requested that developers keep their games 'NES exclusive', and given the unassailable position the console enjoyed, few had the will to defy this request.&quot;<a href="#fn70" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a> Titles for the Master System, however, did take advantage of the advanced hardware of the console in comparison to its competition; <em>Alex Kidd in Miracle World</em>, for example, showcases &quot;blistering colors and more detailed sprites&quot; than competing NES games.<a href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="reception-and-legacy">Reception and legacy</h2>
<p>Sales of the Master System are estimated between 10 million and 13 million units worldwide during its lifetime, in contrast to the 62 million units sold by its chief competitor, the Famicom.<a href="#fn72" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref72"><sup>72</sup></a><a href="#fn73" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref73"><sup>73</sup></a> This was a difference of 49 million units, but Sega would later close the gap between itself and Nintendo with the release of the Genesis.<a href="#fn74" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref74"><sup>74</sup></a> The Master System saw much more continued success in Europe and Brazil than it did in Japan and North America.<a href="#fn75" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref75"><sup>75</sup></a></p>
<p>Reception in 1992 by <em><a href="Electronic_Gaming_Monthly" title="wikilink">Electronic Gaming Monthly</a></em> indicated a souring interest in the console. Four reviewers scored the console 5, 4, 5, and 5 out of a possible 10 points each in the magazine's 1992 Buyer's Guide, focusing on the better value of the Genesis and lack of quality titles for the Master System.<a href="#fn76" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref76"><sup>76</sup></a> By 1993, reviewers scored the console 2, 2, 3, and 3 out of 10, noting its abandonment by Sega in North America and lack of new releases.<a href="#fn77" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref77"><sup>77</sup></a> Retrospective feedback of the console praises its support toward development of the Sega Genesis, but recognizes its game library as its biggest fault. Writing for <a href="Allgame" class="uri" title="wikilink">Allgame</a>, Dave Beuscher notes that &quot;it was doomed by the lack of third party software support and all but disappeared from the American market by 1992.&quot;<a href="#fn78" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref78"><sup>78</sup></a> Damien McFerran of <em><a href="Retro_Gamer" title="wikilink">Retro Gamer</a></em> recognizes its value to the future success of the Genesis, stating, &quot;Without this criminally undervalued machine, Sega would not have enjoyed the considerable success it had with the Mega Drive. The Master System allowed Sega to experiment with arcade conversions, original <a href="intellectual_property" title="wikilink">IP</a> and even create a mascot in the form of the lovable monkey-boy Alex Kidd.&quot;<a href="#fn79" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref79"><sup>79</sup></a> In 2009, the Master System was named the 20th best video game console of all time by the video gaming website <a href="IGN" class="uri" title="wikilink">IGN</a>, behind both of its main competitors, the <a href="Atari_7800" title="wikilink">Atari 7800</a> (ranked 17th best) and the Nintendo Entertainment System (1st). They cited the Master System's small games library, coupled with the highly uneven quality of the few games that were released, as the console's major issues, stating, &quot;Months could go by between major releases and that made a dud on the Master System feel even more painful.&quot;<a href="#fn80" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref80"><sup>80</sup></a></p>
<p>A number of Master System games are available for download on <a href="Nintendo" class="uri" title="wikilink">Nintendo</a>'s <a href="Wii" class="uri" title="wikilink">Wii</a> <a href="Virtual_Console" title="wikilink">Virtual Console</a> in North America, PAL territories and Japan. The first game released for this service was <em><a href="Fist_of_the_North_Star" title="wikilink">Fist of the North Star</a></em>, on February 26, 2008, and later, <em><a href="Fantasy_Zone" title="wikilink">Fantasy Zone</a></em>, released on March 11. Both were released in Japan, at a standard cost of 500 <a href="Nintendo_Points" title="wikilink">Wii Points</a> (though <em>Fist of the North Star</em> costs 600 points, due to the game's source license). In North America, <em><a href="Wonder_Boy_(video_game)" title="wikilink">Wonder Boy</a></em> was the first Master System game released for the service on March 31, 2008.<a href="#fn81" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref81"><sup>81</sup></a></p>
