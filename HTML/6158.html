<p>The <strong>Andean Condor</strong> (<em>Vultur gryphus</em>) is a species of South American bird in the <a href="New_World_vulture" title="wikilink">New World vulture</a> family <a href="Cathartidae" class="uri" title="wikilink">Cathartidae</a> and is the only member of the <a href="genus" class="uri" title="wikilink">genus</a> <strong><em>Vultur</em></strong>. Found in the <a href="Andes" class="uri" title="wikilink">Andes</a> mountains and adjacent Pacific coasts of western South America, it has the <a href="Largest_organisms#Birds_(Aves)" title="wikilink">largest wing span (at 3.2 m)</a> of any land bird.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>It is a large black vulture with a ruff of white feathers surrounding the base of the neck and, especially in the male, large white patches on the wings. The head and neck are nearly featherless, and are a dull red color, which may flush and therefore change color in response to the bird's emotional state. In the male, there is a wattle on the neck and a large, dark red <a href="Comb_(anatomy)" title="wikilink">comb</a> or caruncle on the crown of the head. Unlike most <a href="bird_of_prey" title="wikilink">birds of prey</a>, the male is larger than the female.</p>
<p>The condor is primarily a <a href="scavenger" class="uri" title="wikilink">scavenger</a>, feeding on <a href="carrion" class="uri" title="wikilink">carrion</a>. It prefers large carcasses, such as those of <a href="deer" class="uri" title="wikilink">deer</a> or <a href="cattle" class="uri" title="wikilink">cattle</a>. It reaches sexual maturity at five or six years of age and nests at elevations of up to , generally on inaccessible rock ledges. One or two eggs are usually laid. It is one of the world's longest-living birds, with a lifespan of up to 50 years.</p>
<p>The Andean Condor is a national symbol of <a href="Peru" class="uri" title="wikilink">Peru</a>, <a href="Argentina" class="uri" title="wikilink">Argentina</a>, <a href="Bolivia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bolivia</a>, <a href="Chile" class="uri" title="wikilink">Chile</a>, <a href="Colombia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Colombia</a>, and <a href="Ecuador" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ecuador</a>, and plays an important role in the <a href="folklore" class="uri" title="wikilink">folklore</a> and <a href="mythology" class="uri" title="wikilink">mythology</a> of the Andean regions. The Andean Condor is considered <a href="Near_Threatened" title="wikilink">near threatened</a> by the <a href="IUCN" class="uri" title="wikilink">IUCN</a>. It is threatened by habitat loss and by <a href="secondary_poisoning" title="wikilink">secondary poisoning</a> from carcasses killed by hunters. <a href="Captive_breeding" title="wikilink">Captive breeding</a> programs have been instituted in several countries.</p>
