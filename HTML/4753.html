<p><strong>Mladen Stojanovi&lt;U+0107&gt;</strong> (; 7 April 1896 &lt;U+2013&gt; 1 April 1942) was a <a href="Serbs_of_Bosnia_and_Herzegovina" title="wikilink">Bosnian Serb</a> <a href="physician" class="uri" title="wikilink">physician</a> who led a detachment of <a href="Yugoslav_Partisans" title="wikilink">Yugoslav Partisans</a> in the area of <a href="Kozara" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kozara</a> in north-western <a href="Bosnia_(region)" title="wikilink">Bosnia</a> on the <a href="Yugoslav_Front" title="wikilink">Yugoslav Front</a> of <a href="World_War_II" title="wikilink">World War II</a>. He was posthumously proclaimed a <a href="People&#39;s_Hero_of_Yugoslavia" title="wikilink">People's Hero of Yugoslavia</a>. At the age of fifteen, Stojanovi&lt;U+0107&gt; became an activist in a group of student organizations called <a href="Young_Bosnia" title="wikilink">Young Bosnia</a>, which strongly opposed <a href="Austria-Hungary" class="uri" title="wikilink">Austria-Hungary</a>'s rule over <a href="Bosnia_and_Herzegovina_in_Austria-Hungary" title="wikilink">Bosnia-Herzegovina</a>. In 1912, Stojanovi&lt;U+0107&gt; was inducted into <em><a href="Narodna_Odbrana" title="wikilink">Narodna Odbrana</a></em>, an association founded in the <a href="Kingdom_of_Serbia" title="wikilink">Kingdom of Serbia</a> with the aim of organizing a <a href="Guerrilla_warfare" title="wikilink">guerrilla</a> resistance to the <a href="Annexation_Crisis" title="wikilink">annexation of Bosnia-Herzegovina</a> by Austria-Hungary. Stojanovi&lt;U+0107&gt; was arrested by the Austrian police in July 1914, and although he was sentenced to 16 years' imprisonment, he was pardoned in 1917. He graduated as a <a href="Doctor_of_Medicine" title="wikilink">Doctor of Medicine</a> after World War I, and in 1929 commenced a private practice in Prijedor. He became a member of the <a href="Communist_Party_of_Yugoslavia" title="wikilink">Communist Party of Yugoslavia</a> (KPJ) in September 1940.</p>
<p>After the <a href="invasion_of_Yugoslavia" title="wikilink">invasion of Yugoslavia</a> by the <a href="Axis_powers" title="wikilink">Axis powers</a> and their creation of the <a href="Independent_State_of_Croatia" title="wikilink">Independent State of Croatia</a>, Stojanovi&lt;U+0107&gt; was imprisoned in June 1941 by the <a href="Usta&lt;U+0161&gt;e" class="uri" title="wikilink">Usta&lt;U+0161&gt;e</a>&lt;U+2014&gt;the <a href="Fascism" title="wikilink">fascist</a> government of the puppet state. He escaped from prison and went to Mount Kozara, where he joined communists who had escaped from Prijedor. The KPJ chose Stojanovi&lt;U+0107&gt; to lead the uprising in the district of Prijedorpart of the area of Kozara. The uprising began on 30 July 1941 although neither Stojanovi&lt;U+0107&gt; nor any other communists had much control over it at this stage. The Serb villagers of the district seized control of a number of villages and threatened Prijedor, which was defended by German, Usta&lt;U+0161&gt;e, and <a href="Croatian_Home_Guard_(Independent_State_of_Croatia)" title="wikilink">Croatian Home Guard</a> forces. In August 1941, Stojanovi&lt;U+0107&gt; was recognised as the principal leader of the insurgents in Kozara, who were then organised into Partisan military units. Under Stojanovi&lt;U+0107&gt;'s direction, the Kozara Partisans began attacking the enemy from the end of September 1941. At the beginning of November 1941, all Partisan units in Kozara were merged into the 2nd Krajina National Liberation Partisan Detachment, commanded by Stojanovi&lt;U+0107&gt;. By the end of 1941, most of Kozaracovering about 2,500 square kilometreswas controlled by Stojanovi&lt;U+0107&gt;'s detachment.</p>
<p>On 30 December 1941, Stojanovi&lt;U+0107&gt; arrived in the <a href="Grme&lt;U+010D&gt;" class="uri" title="wikilink">Grme&lt;U+010D&gt;</a> district, which was in the zone of responsibility of the 1st Krajina National Liberation Partisan Detachment. The Italian troops operating in that area portrayed themselves as protectors of the Serbian people. Stojanovi&lt;U+0107&gt;'s tasks were to counter the Italian propaganda and to mobilise the Partisans of the 1st Krajina Detachment to fight against them. He stayed in the area until mid-February 1942, by which time the Partisan leadership of Bosnia-Herzegovina considered he had completed his tasks successfully. At the end of February 1942, Stojanovi&lt;U+0107&gt; was appointed chief of staff of the Operational Headquarters for Bosanska Krajina&lt;U+2014&gt;a unified command of all Partisan forces in the regions of <a href="Bosanska_Krajina" title="wikilink">Bosanska Krajina</a> and central Bosnia. The Operational Headquarters' main task was to counter the rising influence of the <a href="Serbian_nationalism" title="wikilink">Serb-nationalist</a> <a href="Chetniks" class="uri" title="wikilink">Chetniks</a> in those regions. On 5 March 1942, Stojanovi&lt;U+0107&gt; was severely wounded in a Chetnik ambush. He was taken to a field hospital in the village of <a href="Jo&lt;U+0161&gt;avka_Gornja" title="wikilink">Jo&lt;U+0161&gt;avka</a>. Members of the Jo&lt;U+0161&gt;avka Partisan Company defected to the Chetniks on the night of 31 March, and took Stojanovi&lt;U+0107&gt; prisoner. The next night, a group of Chetniks killed him. In April 1942, the 2nd Krajina Detachment was named &quot;Mladen Stojanovi&lt;U+0107&gt;&quot; in his honour, and he was proclaimed a People's Hero of Yugoslavia a few months later. After the war, his service to the Partisan cause was commemorated by the construction of a memorial in Prijedor, the naming of streets, public buildings and a park after him, in song and in film.</p>

<p>Austria-Hungary annexed Bosnia-Herzegovina on 6 October 1908, which caused the <a href="Annexation_Crisis" title="wikilink">Annexation Crisis</a> in Europe. The <a href="Kingdom_of_Serbia" title="wikilink">Kingdom of Serbia</a> protested and mobilised its army, but then on 31 March 1909, it formally accepted the annexation.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> In 1911, Mladen Stojanovi&lt;U+0107&gt; became a member of the secret association of students of the Tuzla gymnasium called <em>Narodno Jedinstvo</em> (National Unity); its members described it as a youth society of nationalists.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a><a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> It was one of a group of diverse student organisations later called <a href="Young_Bosnia" title="wikilink">Young Bosnia</a>, which strongly opposed Austria-Hungary's rule over Bosnia-Herzegovina.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> The activists of Young Bosnia were <a href="Bosnian_Serbs" title="wikilink">Bosnian Serbs</a>, <a href="Bosnian_Muslims" title="wikilink">Muslims</a>, and <a href="Bosnian_Croats" title="wikilink">Croats</a>, though most were Serbs.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> The first organisation regarded to be part of this group was established in 1904 by Serb students of the gymnasium in <a href="Mostar" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mostar</a>.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>

<p>Young Bosnia's activists regarded literature as indispensable to revolution, and most of them wrote poems, short stories, or critiques.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> Stojanovi&lt;U+0107&gt; wrote poems,<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> and read the works of <a href="Petar_Ko&lt;U+010D&gt;i&lt;U+0107&gt;" title="wikilink">Petar Ko&lt;U+010D&gt;i&lt;U+0107&gt;</a>, <a href="Aleksa_&lt;U+0160&gt;anti&lt;U+0107&gt;" title="wikilink">Aleksa &lt;U+0160&gt;anti&lt;U+0107&gt;</a>, <a href="Vladislav_Petkovi&lt;U+0107&gt;_Dis" title="wikilink">Vladislav Petkovi&lt;U+0107&gt; Dis</a>, <a href="Sima_Pandurovi&lt;U+0107&gt;" title="wikilink">Sima Pandurovi&lt;U+0107&gt;</a>, <a href="Milan_Raki&lt;U+0107&gt;" title="wikilink">Milan Raki&lt;U+0107&gt;</a>, and later the works of <a href="Russian_literature" title="wikilink">Russian authors</a>.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> In his final years at the gymnasium, he read <a href="Plato" class="uri" title="wikilink">Plato</a>, <a href="Aristotle" class="uri" title="wikilink">Aristotle</a>, <a href="Rousseau" class="uri" title="wikilink">Rousseau</a>, <a href="Bakunin" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bakunin</a>, <a href="Nietzsche" class="uri" title="wikilink">Nietzsche</a>, <a href="Jean_Jaur&lt;U+00E8&gt;s" title="wikilink">Jaur&lt;U+00E8&gt;s</a>, <a href="Gustave_Le_Bon" title="wikilink">Le Bon</a>, <a href="Henrik_Ibsen" title="wikilink">Ibsen</a>, and <a href="Filippo_Tommaso_Marinetti" title="wikilink">Marinetti</a>.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> National Unity held meetings at which its members presented lectures and discussed current issues concerning the Serbian people of Bosnia-Herzegovina.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> All members of the association were Serbs.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> Generally, Stojanovi&lt;U+0107&gt;'s lectures were about educating people on practical issues of health and the economy. During the summer break of 1911, Stojanovi&lt;U+0107&gt; travelled across Bosanska Krajina lecturing in villages.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> One of the aims of Young Bosnia was to eliminate the backwardness of their country.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
<p>In early-to-mid 1912, Stojanovi&lt;U+0107&gt; and his schoolmate Todor Ili&lt;U+0107&gt; joined <em><a href="Narodna_Odbrana" title="wikilink">Narodna Odbrana</a></em> (National Defence),<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> an association founded in Serbia in December 1908 on the initiative of <a href="Branislav_Nu&lt;U+0161&gt;i&lt;U+0107&gt;" title="wikilink">Branislav Nu&lt;U+0161&gt;i&lt;U+0107&gt;</a>. It aimed to organise a <a href="Guerrilla_warfare" title="wikilink">guerrilla</a> resistance to the Austrian annexation of Bosnia-Herzegovina, and to spread nationalist propaganda. National Defence soon established a network of local committees throughout Serbia and Bosnia-Herzegovina. Its members from the latter territory gathered intelligence on the Austrian army and passed it to the Serbian secret service.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a></p>
<p>Stojanovi&lt;U+0107&gt; and Ili&lt;U+0107&gt; travelled illegally to Serbia during the summer break of 1912 to receive military training that National Defence organised for its members. They stayed for several days in <a href="Belgrade" class="uri" title="wikilink">Belgrade</a>, the capital of Serbia, where they met <a href="Gavrilo_Princip" title="wikilink">Gavrilo Princip</a>, another activist of Young Bosnia who was also a member of National Defence. Stojanovi&lt;U+0107&gt; and Ili&lt;U+0107&gt; then spent a month at army barracks in <a href="Vranje" class="uri" title="wikilink">Vranje</a> in southern Serbia, undergoing military training under the command of <a href="Vojin_Popovi&lt;U+0107&gt;" title="wikilink">Vojin Popovi&lt;U+0107&gt;</a>, a famous <a href="Chetnik" class="uri" title="wikilink">Chetnik</a> guerrilla fighter. When they returned to school, they resumed their activities with National Unity. Its members decided that Muslims should also be drawn into the association. After <a href="Trifko_Grabe&lt;U+017E&gt;" title="wikilink">Trifko Grabe&lt;U+017E&gt;</a> was expelled from the Tuzla gymnasium for slapping a teacher during a quarrel, the association organised a school strike. Most of the students who participated were Serbs; the strike gained little support among students of other ethnicities. The school took disciplinary measures against Ili&lt;U+0107&gt; and Stojanovi&lt;U+0107&gt;, who were regarded as the main organisers of the strike, and Ili&lt;U+0107&gt; lost his scholarship.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>
<p>In the autumn of 1913, Stojanovi&lt;U+0107&gt; commenced the final year of his secondary education. National Unity was visited that year by a group of activists of Young Bosnia who were university students in <a href="Prague" class="uri" title="wikilink">Prague</a>, <a href="Vienna" class="uri" title="wikilink">Vienna</a>, and <a href="Switzerland" class="uri" title="wikilink">Switzerland</a>. They held a series of lectures for the members of the association, explaining their views on the current political situation, and promoting the unity of <a href="South_Slavs" title="wikilink">South Slavic</a> peoples in their struggle to liberate themselves from Austria-Hungary. These lectures influenced Stojanovi&lt;U+0107&gt; to adopt a <a href="Yugoslavism" title="wikilink">Yugoslavist</a> stance. At the beginning of 1914, Ili&lt;U+0107&gt; and Stojanovi&lt;U+0107&gt; became, respectively, the president and the vice-president of National Unity, which numbered 34 members, including four Muslims and four Croats.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> At that time, National Unity was one of the most active groups of Young Bosnia.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a></p>
<p>According to Vid Gakovi&lt;U+0107&gt;, who was a member of National Unity in 1914, Stojanovi&lt;U+0107&gt; was an ambitious and talented young man. He was determined that his voice would be heard and he liked being the centre of attention. He was severe to younger members of the association, whom he sometimes sharply criticised. Nevertheless, younger students liked being around him. Gakovi&lt;U+0107&gt; described him as a tall and handsome man who greatly cared about his appearance; he wore a bow tie and a broad-brimmed hat.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a></p>
<p>On the morning of 28 June 1914, in Sarajevo, Princip <a href="Assassination_of_Archduke_Franz_Ferdinand_of_Austria" title="wikilink">assassinated</a> <a href="Archduke_Franz_Ferdinand_of_Austria" title="wikilink">Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria</a><a href="heir_presumptive" title="wikilink">heir presumptive</a> to the throne of Austria-Hungaryand <a href="Sophie,_Duchess_of_Hohenberg" title="wikilink">his wife</a>.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> Princip was a member of a group of conspirators, which included Trifko Grabe&lt;U+017E&gt;; the whole group was arrested by the Austrian police after the assassination.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> Blaming Serbia for the attack, Austria-Hungary declared war a month later, initiating <a href="World_War_I" title="wikilink">World War I</a>.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> Shortly after the assassination, Stojanovi&lt;U+0107&gt; wrote in his notebook a quote from <a href="Giuseppe_Mazzini" title="wikilink">Giuseppe Mazzini</a>: &quot;There is no more sacred thing in the world than the duty of a conspirator, who becomes an avenger of humanity and the apostle of permanent natural laws.&quot;<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> On 29 June, Stojanovi&lt;U+0107&gt; took his <a href="Abitur" title="wikilink">final exams</a> at the Tuzla gymnasium. Soon afterwards, he and Ili&lt;U+0107&gt; wrote a draft of their manifesto to South Slavic youth,<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> referring to Young Bosnia in a sentence:<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a></p>

<p>Vojislav Vasiljevi&lt;U+0107&gt;, a close friend of Princip's, was a member of National Unity, and when the Austrian police searched his notebooks they found a list of members. Vasiljevi&lt;U+0107&gt; kept this information as evidence of the payment of membership fees.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> All those on the list, including Stojanovi&lt;U+0107&gt;, were arrested on 3 July 1914.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> Soon after, Stojanovi&lt;U+0107&gt;'s younger brother Sreten was arrested for anti-Austrian revolutionary correspondence between himself and Ili&lt;U+0107&gt;.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> Beside the conspirators behind the assassination, six groups of activists of Young Bosnia were arrested.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> The group containing the members of National Unity was called the Tuzla group. The criminal investigation against them began on 9 July, and lasted for more than a year.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> They were kept in prisons in Tuzla, <a href="Banja_Luka" title="wikilink">Banja Luka</a>, and <a href="Biha&lt;U+0107&gt;" class="uri" title="wikilink">Biha&lt;U+0107&gt;</a>. In the Banja Luka prison, they were all kept in the same room, enabling them to organise political and literary discussions. They issued a comic and satirical magazine, called &quot;Mala paprika&quot; (Little Paprika), the copies of which they made using <a href="carbon_paper" title="wikilink">carbon paper</a>. A number of copies found their way out of the prison.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a></p>
<p>In the Biha&lt;U+0107&gt; prison, the Tuzla group created a literary magazine named &quot;Almanah&quot; (Almanac). In its first and only issue, Mladen contributed several poems and an essay. Its editor-in-chief was Ili&lt;U+0107&gt;, while Sreten Stojanovi&lt;U+0107&gt; and <a href="Kosta_Hakman" title="wikilink">Kosta Hakman</a> contributed illustrations. The Stojanovi&lt;U+0107&gt; brothers and Ili&lt;U+0107&gt; learned French during their incarceration.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> The trial of the Tuzla group was held between 13 and 30 September 1915 in Biha&lt;U+0107&gt;. Ili&lt;U+0107&gt; was sentenced to death, Mladen to sixteen years' imprisonment, and the other members of the group received sentences between ten months and fifteen years.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> Especially aggravating for Ili&lt;U+0107&gt; and Mladen was their participation in the 1912 military training in Serbia. The Austrians became aware of this because their army temporarily took <a href="Loznica" class="uri" title="wikilink">Loznica</a> in western Serbia at the beginning of <a href="Serbian_Campaign_(World_War_I)" title="wikilink">World War I</a>, and there they found National Defence documents containing records of all Bosnians that attended the training.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a></p>
<p>Mladen and other members of the Tuzla group were sent to the prison in <a href="Zenica" class="uri" title="wikilink">Zenica</a>. Three months after they were sentenced they were joined by Ili&lt;U+0107&gt;, whose death penalty had been commuted to 20 years' imprisonment. In the <a href="Zenica_prison" title="wikilink">Zenica prison</a>, each convict had to spend the first three months in <a href="solitary_confinement" title="wikilink">solitary confinement</a>. This was very hard on Mladen, who became mentally unwell and became so emaciated that Ili&lt;U+0107&gt; could hardly recognise him. He recovered and took a course in shoe-making which was given in the prison. Afterwards, he fell seriously ill and had to undergo surgery in the prison hospital.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> In late 1917, the Austrian authorities pardoned all convicts of the Tuzla group except Ili&lt;U+0107&gt;. Mladen went to his family in Prijedor. After a medical examination, he was declared unfit for army service due to his surgery and as a result was not drafted into the Austrian army. He entered the <a href="School_of_Medicine,_University_of_Zagreb" title="wikilink">School of Medicine, University of Zagreb</a>, shortly before the disintegration of Austria-Hungary in November 1918.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a></p>

As a former activist of Young Bosnia, he was offered a King's scholarship but he refused it. In Zagreb, he reunited with his former schoolmate Nikola Nikoli&lt;U+0107&gt;, who had also been a member of National Unity. After his release from the Zenica prison, Nikoli&lt;U+0107&gt; was drafted into the Austrian army and sent to the <a href="Eastern_Front_(World_War_I)" title="wikilink">Russian front</a> where he surrendered to the Russians and participated in the <a href="October_Revolution" title="wikilink">October Revolution</a>.

Stojanovi&lt;U+0107&gt; went there several times in 1921 and 1922 and befriended members of a leftist association of Yugoslav students at the Vienna University.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> When they held a protest against the king and government of Yugoslavia, Stojanovi&lt;U+0107&gt; took part and delivered a speech.

<p>Kozara, located in northern Bosanska Krajina and centred around Mount Kozara, covers about . In 1941, the area had a population of nearly 200,000 people. The villagers were mostly Serbs, and the towns in the areathe biggest of which was Prijedorhad a mixed Bosnian Muslim, Serb, and Croat population. Several villages were inhabited by <a href="Germans_of_Yugoslavia#Bosnia_and_Herzegovina" title="wikilink">ethnic Germans</a> or <em>Volksdeutsche</em>. The economy of Kozara was dominated by agriculture, but there were about 6,000 workers employed in a coal mine and several plants. The first communist cells in the area were established shortly before the Axis invasion, mostly in the towns. Kozara had seen four uprisings against the <a href="Ottoman_Empire" title="wikilink">Ottomans</a> during the 19th century.<a href="#fn93" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref93"><sup>93</sup></a></p>

By mid-August, five detachments of Partisans had been formed within the territory held by the Kozara insurgents.

At the conference, Stojanovi&lt;U+0107&gt; was recognised as the principal leader in Kozara; this recognition mostly resulted from his pre-war social status and good reputation among the people. It was concluded that forming a front line was a mistake because it was not consistent with guerrilla warfare.<a href="#fn104" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref104"><sup>104</sup></a> At some point during the conference, Stojanovi&lt;U+0107&gt; stressed the importance of keeping as many enemy troops as possible in the area, so that they could not be sent to the Russian front to fight the <a href="Red_Army" title="wikilink">Red Army</a>.<a href="#fn105" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref105"><sup>105</sup></a> As the five detachments in the area were tied to their specific territories, it was decided that another detachmentwhich could operate anywhere in Kozarashould be formed.

The Partisan units retreated deeper into forested areas in the mountains. Stojanovi&lt;U+0107&gt; led the Kozara Detachment toward Lisina, the highest peak of Kozara. In the evening, he assembled his men and told them that they were in the army of the KPJ and all peoples of Yugoslavia, so they could not allow themselves to be attached to any specific village or area. He advised those who could not detach themselves from their homes to lay down their weapons and leave. Several men left the detachment, which then moved toward Lisina where they organised a camp and spent some time in military training and political indoctrination.<a href="#fn108" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref108"><sup>108</sup></a> The attack of 18 August was the first counter-insurgency operation in Kozara, and the Partisans emerged from it without significant losses.<a href="#fn109" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref109"><sup>109</sup></a></p>

<p>The leaders of the Kozara uprising assembled again on 10 September 1941, at the foot of Lisina. The five detachments of the Kozara Partisans were re-arranged into three companies,<a href="#fn110" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref110"><sup>110</sup></a> possessing 217 rifles altogether. At the end of September, the Kozara Partisans began attacking NDH and German troops, initially targeting weaker elements. These operations gave them military experience and they also captured weapons and ammunition from the enemy. More men joined the Partisans, and two more companies had been formed in Kozara by the end of October. The Partisans gained control over a number of villages.<a href="#fn111" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref111"><sup>111</sup></a> After a reorganization, Partisan units in Kozara were merged into the 2nd Krajina National Liberation Partisan Detachment in early November 1941. Stojanovi&lt;U+0107&gt; was appointed commander of this detachment.<a href="#fn112" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref112"><sup>112</sup></a> By mid-November, it consisted of 670 men organised in six companies and armed with 510 rifles, 5 <a href="light_machine_gun" title="wikilink">light machine guns</a>, and a <a href="heavy_machine_gun" title="wikilink">heavy machine gun</a>.<a href="#fn113" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref113"><sup>113</sup></a></p>
<p>Between the end of September and the end of December 1941, the Kozara Partisans conducted around forty military operations against the enemy. Stojanovi&lt;U+0107&gt; helped plan and execute the major operations, including the battles of <a href="Gornji_Podgradci" title="wikilink">Podgradci</a>, <a href="Mrakovica" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mrakovica</a>, and <a href="Turjak_(Gradi&lt;U+0161&gt;ka)" title="wikilink">Turjak</a>. Stojanovi&lt;U+0107&gt; argued that the village of Podgradci should be captured because it was situated deep within Kozara, because the enemy could easily disrupt the Partisans' advance toward other villages of the district of <a href="Gradi&lt;U+0161&gt;ka,_Bosnia_and_Herzegovina" title="wikilink">Gradi&lt;U+0161&gt;ka</a>, and because there was a sawmill in Podgradci which supplied the NDH and Germans.<a href="#fn114" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref114"><sup>114</sup></a> On 23 October 1941, Partisans under Stojanovi&lt;U+0107&gt;'s command took Podgradci after five hours of fighting.<a href="#fn115" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref115"><sup>115</sup></a> The sawmill and its stored productsincluding a large quantity of <a href="railroad_tie" title="wikilink">railroad ties</a>, with which the Germans were allegedly planning to repair railways destroyed by Soviet partisans in occupied Ukrainewere burnt down. Stojanovi&lt;U+0107&gt; saw this action as a symbolic collaboration with the Red Army. A number of Usta&lt;U+0161&gt;e and Croatian Home Guards were captured in Podgradci. The Usta&lt;U+0161&gt;e were promptly executed, and the Home Guards were given a speech by Stojanovi&lt;U+0107&gt; before the Partisans gave them food and escorted them across the <a href="Una_(Sava)" title="wikilink">Una River</a>.<a href="#fn116" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref116"><sup>116</sup></a></p>
<p>The third counter-insurgency operation in Kozara was undertaken at the end of November 1941 by about 19,000 Croatian Home Guards, Usta&lt;U+0161&gt;e, and Germans.<a href="#fn117" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref117"><sup>117</sup></a> The Partisans emerged from the operation without significant losses, though NDH propaganda claimed that the rebels in Kozara were destroyed and that Stojanovi&lt;U+0107&gt; had been killed.<a href="#fn118" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref118"><sup>118</sup></a> The Kozara Partisans never repeated the mistake of frontal resistance.<a href="#fn119" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref119"><sup>119</sup></a> When stronger enemy forces advanced toward them, they manoeuvred to position themselves behind the attackers, thus avoiding battles they could not win. The Partisans therefore did not defend villages. During the third counter-insurgency operation, the Usta&lt;U+0161&gt;e and Germans killed hundreds of Serb civilians in the villages, resulting in a loss of support for the Partisans among the population. Stojanovi&lt;U+0107&gt; thought that a significant victory over the enemy would be the best way to restore the lost support.<a href="#fn120" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref120"><sup>120</sup></a></p>
<p>After the third counter-insurgency operation, a battalion of the Croatian Home Guard was stationed on Mrakovica, a peak in Kozara.<a href="#fn121" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref121"><sup>121</sup></a> Stojanovi&lt;U+0107&gt; ordered an attack by five companies of the 2nd Krajina Detachment on the battalion, which began on 5 December 1941 at 5:30 am.

The capture of Turjak opened up the district of Gradi&lt;U+0161&gt;ka to the Kozara Partisans. The Home Guards retreated from Podgradci without significant resistance. Soon, most of the district was under Partisan control and Stojanovi&lt;U+0107&gt;'s detachment controlled most of Mount Kozara and the surrounding Potkozarje region.<a href="#fn126" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref126"><sup>126</sup></a></p>
<p>More men joined Stojanovi&lt;U+0107&gt;'s detachment, and at the end of 1941 it had over one thousand well-armed soldiers organised in three battalions of three companies each.<a href="#fn127" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref127"><sup>127</sup></a> The detachment established good relations with the Muslim population of the area, with a number of Muslims from Kozarac joining the Partisans.<a href="#fn128" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref128"><sup>128</sup></a><a href="#fn129" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref129"><sup>129</sup></a> On 21 December at Lisina, Pucar held a meeting with the communists of Kozara.

<p>On 24 December, the Banja Luka headquarters of the Croatian Home Guard offered a reward for Stojanovi&lt;U+0107&gt;. A Home Guard document described him as the most intelligent and dangerous rebel leader, who planned and carried out attacks in a highly systematic manner. The headquarters was especially concerned about Stojanovi&lt;U+0107&gt;'s treatment of captured Home Guard soldiers&lt;U+2014&gt;giving them a communist propaganda speech, offering them food and cigarettes, dressing their wounds, and then letting them go home.

<p>On 29 or 30 December 1941, Stojanovi&lt;U+0107&gt; arrived in the area of <a href="Grme&lt;U+010D&gt;" class="uri" title="wikilink">Grme&lt;U+010D&gt;</a> in western Bosanska Krajina, which was in the zone of responsibility of the 1st Krajina National Liberation Partisan Detachment.<a href="#fn135" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref135"><sup>135</sup></a> This zone also included Drvar, where the uprising in Bosnia-Herzegovina began. The military activities of the Partisans there diminished after the capture of Drvar by Italian troops on 25 September 1941.

According to Karabegovi&lt;U+0107&gt;, the Partisans of the 1st Krajina became more active after Pucar held a conference with their commanders on 15 December 1941, but this activity was still weak in northern parts of Grme&lt;U+010D&gt;.

<p>Stojanovi&lt;U+0107&gt; visited the villages in the area, inspecting individual companies and <a href="platoon" title="wikilink">platoons</a> of the 1st Krajina Detachment. His visits were accompanied by parades of Partisan units and by mass gatherings. Partisan songs were sung, slogans were shouted, and banners were waved. Stojanovi&lt;U+0107&gt; gave speeches to the villagers and soldiers. He said that the Italian troops in the area were not protectors of the Serbs, but occupiers and enemies. He branded those who collaborated with the Italians as traitors to the Serbian people.<a href="#fn140" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref140"><sup>140</sup></a><a href="#fn141" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref141"><sup>141</sup></a> Stojanovi&lt;U+0107&gt;'s speeches were not well received by some people, who spread rumours that he was not Mladen Stojanovi&lt;U+0107&gt;, but a &quot;Turk&quot; (Muslim) impersonator. According to them, Stojanovi&lt;U+0107&gt; had been killed by the Usta&lt;U+0161&gt;e in August 1941 and the communists were using an impersonator to deceive the people. Few people gave credence to these rumours.<a href="#fn142" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref142"><sup>142</sup></a></p>
<p>On 22 January 1942, at the headquarters of the 1st Krajina Detachment in the village of <a href="Majki&lt;U+0107&gt;_Japra" title="wikilink">Majki&lt;U+0107&gt; Japra</a>, Stojanovi&lt;U+0107&gt; presided over a conference of the detachment staff and political activists of Grme&lt;U+010D&gt;. He criticised the detachment headquarters because it had no division of functions and there was no personal accountability among its members. He also stated the headquarters had no communication with the companies of the detachment, did not act as a military-political leadership, and there were no designated couriers available at all times at the headquarters. Stojanovi&lt;U+0107&gt; was generally pleased with the Grme&lt;U+010D&gt; Partisans, describing them as courageous, enthusiastic, firm, and trustworthy but somewhat inexperienced. However, he said that the platoons of the detachment were dispersed in villages and had no contact with each other. In this way, according to Stojanovi&lt;U+0107&gt;, the Partisans were losing their soldierly characteristics and becoming more like peasants. Stojanovi&lt;U+0107&gt; criticised the views of some Partisans that political commissars should be abolished. He warned that the Partisans who wore emblems other than the <a href="Red_Star#Symbol_of_communism" title="wikilink">red star</a> would be punished for indiscipline.<a href="#fn143" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref143"><sup>143</sup></a></p>

<p>On 19 April 1942, the headquarters of the 2nd Krajina Detachment decided to change its name to the 2nd Krajina National Liberation Partisan Detachment &quot;Mladen Stojanovi&lt;U+0107&gt;&quot;.

<p>After the war, a monument to Stojanovi&lt;U+0107&gt; was built by his brother Sreten and erected in Prijedor. Streets, firms, schools, hospitals, pharmacies, and associations were named after Stojanovi&lt;U+0107&gt; throughout the <a href="Socialist_Federal_Republic_of_Yugoslavia" title="wikilink">Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia</a>.

<h2 id="poetry">Poetry</h2>
<p>In his youth, Stojanovi&lt;U+0107&gt; wrote poems, only one of which is published&lt;U+2014&gt;in a 1918 issue of the literary magazine <em><a href="Knji&lt;U+017E&gt;evni_jug" title="wikilink">Knji&lt;U+017E&gt;evni jug</a></em>,<a href="#fn187" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref187"><sup>187</sup></a><a href="#fn188" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref188"><sup>188</sup></a> whose editor was <a href="Nobel_Prize_in_Literature" title="wikilink">Nobel Prize</a> winner <a href="Ivo_Andri&lt;U+0107&gt;" title="wikilink">Ivo Andri&lt;U+0107&gt;</a>. A number of Stojanovi&lt;U+0107&gt;'s poems are preserved in a notebook that belonged to his closest school friend Todor Ili&lt;U+0107&gt;. According to the poet Dragan Kolund&lt;U+017E&gt;ija, Stojanovi&lt;U+0107&gt;'s poems are <a href="Lyric_poetry" title="wikilink">lyrical</a> miniatures composed in <a href="free_verse" title="wikilink">free verse</a>, focused on man and nature, and filled with melancholy. Kolund&lt;U+017E&gt;ija finds that what inspired Stojanovi&lt;U+0107&gt; to write poetry is reflected in his verse <em>Krvav je bol</em> (<em>Pain is bloody</em>).<a href="#fn189" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref189"><sup>189</sup></a> According to poet <a href="Miroslav_Feldman" title="wikilink">Miroslav Feldman</a>, who first met Stojanovi&lt;U+0107&gt; in 1919 in Zagreb, his poems were sad and permeated with a yearning for a brighter, more joyous life.<a href="#fn190" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref190"><sup>190</sup></a></p>
<p>Stojanovi&lt;U+0107&gt; wrote an essay, which is published as the foreword to a 1920 book of poetry by Feldman, titled <em><a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=q_iPOQAACAAJ">Iza Sunca</a></em> (<em>Behind the Sun</em>). In 1925, Stojanovi&lt;U+0107&gt; initiated the creation of an anthology of Yugoslav lyric poetry. On this project, he worked with Feldman and <a href="Gustav_Krklec" title="wikilink">Gustav Krklec</a>.
