<p>The <strong>Independent Labour Group</strong> was a <a href="Irish_nationalism" title="wikilink">nationalist</a> <a href="political_party" title="wikilink">political party</a> in <a href="Northern_Ireland" title="wikilink">Northern Ireland</a> from the late 1950s to the mid-1960s. Sometimes known as the <strong>Independent Labour Party</strong>, it was formed in 1958 in <a href="Belfast" class="uri" title="wikilink">Belfast</a> by <a href="independent_Labour" title="wikilink">independent Labour</a> MP <a href="Frank_Hanna" title="wikilink">Frank Hanna</a>, with the support of various local <a href="Roman_Catholic" title="wikilink">Roman Catholic</a> clerics. That year, the party wiped out the <a href="Irish_Labour_Party" title="wikilink">Irish Labour Party</a> on <a href="Belfast_City_Council" title="wikilink">Belfast City Council</a>.</p>
<p><a href="John_Joseph_Brennan" title="wikilink">John Joseph Brennan</a> stood under the party banner in <a href="Belfast_West_(UK_Parliament_constituency)" title="wikilink">Belfast West</a> in the <a href="United_Kingdom_general_election,_1959" title="wikilink">1959 UK general election</a>, where he received 37.6% of the votes cast, then stood in Belfast Falls in the <a href="Northern_Ireland_general_election,_1962" title="wikilink">Northern Ireland general election, 1962</a>. Hanna continued to hold his <a href="Belfast_Central_(Northern_Ireland_Parliament_constituency)" title="wikilink">Belfast Central</a> seat for the organisation.</p>
<p>In the <a href="Northern_Ireland_general_election,_1965" title="wikilink">1965 Northern Ireland general election</a>, Brennan took over Hanna's seat, having joined the <a href="National_Democratic_Party_(Northern_Ireland)" title="wikilink">National Democratic Party</a>, for which Brennan was elected; the remainder of the party appears to have joined or disintegrated by this point.</p>
