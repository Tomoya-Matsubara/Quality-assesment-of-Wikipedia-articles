<p><strong><em>A Journey</em></strong> is a <a href="memoir" class="uri" title="wikilink">memoir</a> by <a href="Tony_Blair" title="wikilink">Tony Blair</a> of his tenure as <a href="Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Kingdom" title="wikilink">Prime Minister of the United Kingdom</a>. Published in the UK on 1 September 2010, it covers events from when he <a href="Labour_Party_(UK)_leadership_election,_1994" title="wikilink">became leader</a> of the <a href="Labour_Party_(UK)" title="wikilink">Labour Party</a> in 1994 and transformed it into &quot;New Labour&quot;, holding power for a party record <a href="Premiership_of_Tony_Blair" title="wikilink">three successive terms</a>, to his <a href="Labour_Party_(UK)_leadership_election,_2007" title="wikilink">resignation and replacement</a> as Prime Minister by his <a href="Chancellor_of_the_Exchequer" title="wikilink">Chancellor of the Exchequer</a>, <a href="Gordon_Brown" title="wikilink">Gordon Brown</a>. Blair donated his &lt;U+00A3&gt;4.6m <a href="Advance_against_royalties" title="wikilink">advance</a>, and all subsequent <a href="royalties" class="uri" title="wikilink">royalties</a>, to the <a href="British_Armed_Forces" title="wikilink">British Armed Forces</a> charity <a href="The_Royal_British_Legion" title="wikilink">The Royal British Legion</a>. It became the fastest-selling autobiography of all time at the bookstore chain Waterstones. Promotional events were marked by antiwar protests.</p>
<p>Two of the book's major topics are the strains in Blair's relationship with Brown after allegedly reneging on the pair's <a href="Blair&lt;U+2013&gt;Brown_deal" title="wikilink">1994 agreement</a> to step down as Prime Minister much earlier, and his <a href="Opposition_to_the_Iraq_War" title="wikilink">controversial decision</a> to participate in the <a href="2003_invasion_of_Iraq" title="wikilink">2003 invasion of Iraq</a>. Blair discusses Labour's future after the <a href="United_Kingdom_general_election,_2010" title="wikilink">2010 general election</a>, his relations with the <a href="British_Royal_Family" title="wikilink">Royal Family</a>, and how he came to respect <a href="President_of_the_United_States" title="wikilink">President</a> <a href="George_W._Bush" title="wikilink">George W. Bush</a>. Reviews were mixed; some criticised Blair's writing style, but others called it candid.</p>
<p>Gordon Brown was reportedly unhappy over Blair's comments about him, while David Runciman of <em><a href="The_London_Review_of_Books" title="wikilink">The London Review of Books</a></em> suggested there were episodes from Blair's troubled relationship with his Chancellor that were absent from <em>A Journey</em>. Labour politician <a href="Alistair_Darling" title="wikilink">Alistair Darling</a> said the book demonstrates how the country can be changed for the better when a government has a clear purpose, while the <em><a href="New_Zealand_Listener" title="wikilink">New Zealand Listener</a></em> suggested Blair and his contemporaries had helped to write New Labour's epitaph. Families of servicemen and servicewomen who were killed in Iraq reacted angrily, with one antiwar commentator dismissing Blair's regrets over the loss of life. Shortly after the release of <em>A Journey</em>, the screenwriter of the 2006 film <em><a href="The_Queen_(film)" title="wikilink">The Queen</a></em>, which depicts Blair's first months in office, accused Blair of plagiarising a conversation with <a href="Elizabeth_II" title="wikilink">Elizabeth II</a> from him.</p>

<p>In March 2010, it was reported that Blair's memoirs, under the title <em>The Journey</em>, would be published in September.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> <a href="Gail_Rebuck" title="wikilink">Gail Rebuck</a>, chairman and chief executive of <a href="Random_House" title="wikilink">Random House</a>, announced that the memoirs would be published by <a href="Hutchinson_(publisher)" title="wikilink">Hutchinson</a> in the United Kingdom.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> She predicted that the book would &quot;break new ground in prime ministerial memoirs just as Blair himself broke the mould of British politics.&quot;<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> Preliminary images of the book's cover, showing Blair in an open-neck shirt, were released.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> In July, the memoir was retitled as <em>A Journey</em>; one publishing expert speculated that it was changed to make Blair appear &quot;less messianic&quot;.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> The publisher did not give any reason.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> It was announced the book would be published by <a href="Knopf" class="uri" title="wikilink">Knopf</a> in the United States and Canada<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> under the title <em>A Journey: My Political Life</em>;<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> and in Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, and India by Random House.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> It was also released as an <a href="audiobook" class="uri" title="wikilink">audiobook</a>, read by Blair.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> The book was published in the United Kingdom on 1 September.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<p>Before the launch, Blair announced that he would give the &lt;U+00A3&gt;4.6m advance and all royalties from his memoirs to a sports centre for injured soldiers.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a><a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a><a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> In an interview with Jonathon Gatehouse, he conceded, &quot;You wouldn't be human if you didn't feel both a sense of responsibility and a deep sadness for those who have lost their lives.

You know, I came to office as prime minister in 1997, focusing on domestic policy and ended up in four conflicts -- Sierra Leone, Kosovo, Afghanistan and Iraq.

<p><em>A Journey</em> covers Blair's time as leader of the <a href="Labour_Party_(UK)" title="wikilink">Labour Party</a> and then <a href="Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Kingdom" title="wikilink">British Prime Minister</a> following his party's victory at the <a href="United_Kingdom_general_election,_1997" title="wikilink">1997 general election</a>. His tenure as Labour leader begins in 1994 following the death of his predecessor, <a href="John_Smith_(Labour_Party_leader)" title="wikilink">John Smith</a>, an event Blair claims to have had a premonition about a month before Smith died.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> Blair believes he will succeed Smith as Labour leader rather than Gordon Brown, who is a strong contender for the job.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> Blair and Brown subsequently reach an agreement whereby Brown will not run against Blair for the position, and will succeed him later. But it leads to a difficult working relationship, which is discussed at length.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> He likens them both to &quot;a couple who loved each other, arguing over whose career should come first.&quot;<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> To him, Brown is a &quot;strange guy&quot;.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> with &quot;zero&quot; <a href="emotional_intelligence" title="wikilink">emotional intelligence</a>.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a></p>
<p>Having been elected as leader Blair moves the Labour Party to the <a href="Centrism" title="wikilink">political centre ground</a>, repackaging it as &quot;New Labour&quot;, and goes on to win the 1997 general election.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a><a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> At his first meeting with <a href="Elizabeth_II" title="wikilink">Elizabeth II</a> following his election as Prime Minister Blair recalls the Queen telling him, &quot;You are my tenth prime minister. The first was Winston. That was before you were born.&quot;<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a><a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> Within a few months his government must deal with the aftermath of the <a href="death_of_Diana,_Princess_of_Wales" title="wikilink">death of Diana, Princess of Wales</a>, and following <a href="Diana,_Princess_of_Wales" title="wikilink">the Princess</a>'s funeral, Elizabeth II tells Blair that lessons must be learned from the way things have been handled.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> Social occasions with the Queen are also recalled, including a gathering at <a href="Balmoral_Castle" title="wikilink">Balmoral Castle</a> where <a href="Prince_Philip,_Duke_of_Edinburgh" title="wikilink">Prince Philip</a> is described manning the barbecue while Elizabeth II dons a pair of <a href="rubber_glove" title="wikilink">rubber gloves</a> to wash up afterwards.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a><a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a></p>
<p>From the outset Blair's government plays a significant role in the <a href="Northern_Ireland_peace_process" title="wikilink">Northern Ireland peace process</a>, during which Blair admits to using &quot;a certain amount of creative ambiguity&quot; to secure an agreement,<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> claiming the process would not have succeeded otherwise. He says that he stretched the truth &quot;on occasions past breaking point&quot; in the run-up to the 2007 power-sharing deal which enabled the return of devolved legislative powers from <a href="Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom" title="wikilink">Westminster</a> to the <a href="Northern_Ireland_Executive" title="wikilink">Northern Ireland Executive</a>.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> Both <a href="Gerry_Adams" title="wikilink">Gerry Adams</a> and <a href="Martin_McGuinness" title="wikilink">Martin McGuinness</a> of <a href="Sinn_F&lt;U+00E9&gt;in" title="wikilink">Sinn F&lt;U+00E9&gt;in</a> are praised for the part they played in the peace process.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a></p>
<p>One of the themes that dominates the latter part of Blair's time in office is his decision to join <a href="President_of_the_United_States" title="wikilink">U.S. President</a> <a href="George_W._Bush" title="wikilink">George W. Bush</a> in committing troops to the <a href="2003_invasion_of_Iraq" title="wikilink">2003 invasion of Iraq</a>, the aftermath of which he describes as a &quot;nightmare&quot;,<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> but that he believes to have been necessary because <a href="Saddam_Hussein" title="wikilink">Saddam Hussein</a> &quot;had not abandoned the strategy of <a href="Weapon_of_mass_destruction" title="wikilink">WMD</a> [weapons of mass destruction], merely made a tactical decision to put it into abeyance&quot;.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> He would make the same decision again with regard to <a href="Iran" class="uri" title="wikilink">Iran</a>, warning that if that country develops nuclear weapons it will change the balance of power of the Middle East, to the region's detriment.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> Blair believes some problems in Iraq still require a &quot;resolution&quot; and will fester if left unattended.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> Of the war dead he says, &quot;I feel desperately sorry for them, sorry for the lives cut short, sorry for the families whose bereavement is made worse by the controversy over why their loved ones died, sorry for the utterly unfair selection that the loss should be theirs.&quot;<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> A year on from the invasion he hopes Bush will <a href="United_States_presidential_election,_2004" title="wikilink">win a second term as U.S. President</a>:<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> &quot;I had come to like and admire George,&quot; he writes.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a></p>
<p>In 2003 Blair promises his Chancellor, Gordon Brown that he will resign before the <a href="United_Kingdom_general_election,_2005" title="wikilink">next general election</a>, but later changes his mind.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a> Brown subsequently attempts to blackmail him, threatened to call for a Labour Party inquiry into the 2005 <a href="cash_for_honours" title="wikilink">cash for honours</a> affair during an argument over pension policy.<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a><a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a> Brown succeeds Blair as Labour Party leader and Prime Minister in 2007. But while Blair praises Brown as a good Chancellor and a committed public servant, he believes his decision to abandon the New Labour policies of the Blair years leads to the party's <a href="United_Kingdom_general_election,_2010" title="wikilink">2010 election defeat</a>.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a> However, Brown is right to restructure British banks and introduce an economic stimulus after the <a href="Financial_crisis_of_2007&lt;U+2013&gt;2010" title="wikilink">financial crisis</a>.<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a></p>
<p>The book closes with a final chapter offering a critique of Labour Party policy, and discusses its future. Blair warns Brown's successor that if Labour is to remain electable they should continue with the policies of New Labour and not return to the left-wing policies of the 1980s:<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a> &quot;I won three elections. Up to then, Labour had never even won two successive full terms. The longest Labour government had lasted six years. This lasted 13. It could have gone on longer, had it not abandoned New Labour.&quot;<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a></p>

<p><em>A Journey</em> drew a mixed reception from critics. <em><a href="Financial_Times" title="wikilink">Financial Times</a></em> editor <a href="Lionel_Barber" title="wikilink">Lionel Barber</a> called it &quot;part psychodrama, part treatise on the frustrations of leadership in a modern democracy ... written in a chummy style with touches of <a href="Mills_&amp;_Boon" title="wikilink">Mills &amp; Boon</a>&quot;.

<p>Other reviewers were less positive. The political journalist and author <a href="Andrew_Rawnsley" title="wikilink">Andrew Rawnsley</a> was critical of Blair's writing style in <em><a href="The_Observer" title="wikilink">The Observer</a></em>. &quot;It is Tony Blair's boast that he wrote every word in longhand 'on hundreds of notepads'. That I believe,&quot; he wrote. &quot;He was the most brilliant communicator of his era as a platform speaker or television interviewee, but he can be a ghastly writer. Anyone thinking about taking this journey needs to be given a travel advisory: much of the prose is execrable ... I could say that it is a pity that Tony Blair did not employ a ghostwriter to prettify the prose and organise his recollections more elegantly.&quot; Rawnsley does, though, praise the book as being &quot;a more honest political memoir than most and more open in many respects than I had anticipated.&quot;<a href="#fn82" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref82"><sup>82</sup></a> Julian Glover, a columnist in <em><a href="The_Guardian" title="wikilink">The Guardian</a></em>, said that &quot;no political memoir has ever been like this: a book written as if in a dream&lt;U+2014&gt;or a nightmare; a literary out-of-body experience. By turns honest, confused, memorable, boastful, fitfully endearing, important, lazy, shallow, rambling and intellectually correct, it scampers through the last two decades like a trashy airport read.&quot;<a href="#fn83" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref83"><sup>83</sup></a> <em><a href="The_Sunday_Telegraph" title="wikilink">The Sunday Telegraph</a></em> was extremely critical of Blair's writing style. &quot;If Blair wants to tell you a funny story, he makes the mistake of signalling in advance that you should be laughing&lt;U+2014&gt;what happened was 'hilarious', his first weekend at Balmoral was 'utterly freaky'&lt;U+2014&gt;thereby strangling the anecdote at birth.

His account of it is also the best chapter in a book which, even by the standards of memoirists who fancy themselves to be remarkable leaders, is strikingly egocentric.&quot;<a href="#fn85" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref85"><sup>85</sup></a></p>

It is breezy, informal and candid enough to keep the reader thoroughly engaged.&quot;<a href="#fn87" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref87"><sup>87</sup></a> However, Zakaria attacked Blair's &quot;sweeping generalizations&quot; about terrorism.<a href="#fn88" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref88"><sup>88</sup></a></p>

<p>The Queen reportedly felt a &quot;profound sense of disappointment&quot; in Blair for breaking with protocol by revealing in his memoirs sensitive details of private conversations he had with her during his time as Prime Minister.

Former <a href="Conservative_party_(UK)" title="wikilink">Conservative</a> minister <a href="Norman_Tebbit" title="wikilink">Norman Tebbit</a> wrote in <em>The Daily Telegraph</em>, &quot;<em>A Journey</em> seems to be dominated by Blair's anxiety to be seen as a great political leader who changed his country for the better.

<h2 id="other-accounts-of-the-blair-years">Other accounts of the Blair years</h2>
<p>Some commentators offered comparisons between <em>A Journey</em> and accounts of the Blair years written by other senior members of his government, particularly on Blair's relationship with Gordon Brown. David Goodhart of <em><a href="Prospect_Magazine" title="wikilink">Prospect Magazine</a></em> wrote that in both Peter Mandelson&lt;U+2019&gt;s memoir <em>The Third Man</em> and the first volume of <a href="Alastair_Campbell" title="wikilink">Alastair Campbell</a>&lt;U+2019&gt;s Diaries (1994-97), &quot;Blair is important, but a rather weak figure buffeted by events and by Gordon Brown. In Blair&lt;U+2019&gt;s own account, A Journey (in which Mandelson features hardly at all, and Gordon Brown only at the end) it is of course very different. Almost everything is driven forward by him; the new Labour project was not imminent in Britain&lt;U+2019&gt;s political history&lt;U+2014&gt;it had to be shaped and moulded.&quot;<a href="#fn113" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref113"><sup>113</sup></a> A similar theme was echoed by David Runciman in <em>The London Review of Books</em>, where he reflected that Mandelson's memoirs &quot;provide a much more complete account of the Blair/Brown relationship&quot;, including details of <em>Operation Teddy Bear</em>, an aborted plot from 2003 to curb Brown's increasing influence as Chancellor by dividing the Treasury to create a separate Office of Budget and Delivery that would be controlled directly by the <a href="Cabinet_Office" title="wikilink">Cabinet Office</a>.<a href="#fn114" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref114"><sup>114</sup></a></p>
<p>Writing for the journal <em>British Politics</em>, academic Mark Garnett provided a detailed analysis of the Blair and Mandelson memoirs, observing that while <em>A Journey</em> gives a more in-depth account of what he termed &quot;contemporary British government&quot;, <em>The Third Man</em> is a more satisfying read: &quot;<em>The Third Man</em> was a worthwhile effort for Peter Mandelson's reputation, while Tony Blair has journeyed in vain.&quot;<a href="#fn115" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref115"><sup>115</sup></a> The <em>New Zealand Listener</em>, on the other hand, suggested that <em>A Journey</em> and other memoirs written by prominent architects of New Labour had helped to seal its doom after <a href="David_Miliband" title="wikilink">David Miliband</a> &lt;U+2013&gt; the preferred candidate of all three as Brown's successor &lt;U+2013&gt; failed to be elected to the position: &quot;All three backed David Miliband, and however much Miliband tried to distance himself &lt;U+2013&gt; I&lt;U+2019&gt;m not New Labour, I&lt;U+2019&gt;m Next Labour &lt;U+2013&gt; these three books and the publicity that surrounded them showed he had New Labour dye all over his hands. David was beaten to the leadership by his younger brother, Ed (a man who lacked, as Blair himself might put it, the New Labour baggage), by a whisker &lt;U+2013&gt; just over 1%. And at a stroke, it&lt;U+2019&gt;s clear these great, vocal proselytisers of New Labour have unwittingly written its epitaph.&quot;<a href="#fn116" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref116"><sup>116</sup></a></p>
