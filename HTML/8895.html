<p><strong>Prairie Avenue</strong> is a north&lt;U+2013&gt;south thoroughfare on the <a href="South_side_(Chicago)" title="wikilink">South Side of Chicago</a>, which historically extended from 16th Street in the <a href="Near_South_Side,_Chicago" title="wikilink">Near South Side</a> <a href="Community_areas_of_Chicago" title="wikilink">community area</a> of <a href="Chicago" class="uri" title="wikilink">Chicago</a> in <a href="Cook_County,_Illinois" title="wikilink">Cook County</a>, <a href="Illinois" class="uri" title="wikilink">Illinois</a>, <a href="United_States" title="wikilink">United States</a>, to the city's southern limits and beyond. The street has a rich history from its origins as a major trail for horseback riders and <a href="carriage" title="wikilink">carriages</a>. During the last three decades of the 19th century, a six-<a href="City_block" title="wikilink">block</a> section of the street served as the residence of many of Chicago's elite families and an additional four-block section was also known for grand homes. The upper six-block section includes part of the historic <a href="Prairie_Avenue_District" title="wikilink">Prairie Avenue District</a>, which was declared a <a href="Chicago_Landmark" title="wikilink">Chicago Landmark</a> and added to the <a href="National_Register_of_Historic_Places" title="wikilink">National Register of Historic Places</a>.</p>
<p>Several of Chicago's most important <a href="history_of_Chicago" title="wikilink">historical figures</a> have lived on the street. This is especially true of the period of recovery from the <a href="Great_Chicago_Fire" title="wikilink">Great Chicago Fire</a> of 1871 when many of the most important families in the city moved to the street. Residents of the street have influenced the evolution of the city and have played prominent national and international roles. They have influenced the <a href="political_history_of_Chicago" title="wikilink">political history</a>, the <a href="Chicago_architecture" title="wikilink">architecture</a>, the <a href="culture_of_Chicago" title="wikilink">culture</a>, the <a href="economy_of_Chicago" title="wikilink">economy</a>, as well as the <a href="law_and_government_of_Chicago" title="wikilink">law and government of Chicago</a>. The street has over time been influenced by the <a href="demographics_of_Chicago" title="wikilink">demographics of Chicago</a>.</p>
<p>The importance of the street has declined, but it still has landmark buildings and is the backbone of an historic district. Preservation battles regarding various properties on the street have been notable with one having been chronicled on the front page of <em><a href="The_New_York_Times" title="wikilink">The New York Times</a></em>. As of 2009, the street is being redeveloped to host valuable and important condominiums. Recently, developments have extended the street north to accommodate new high-rise condominiums, such as <a href="One_Museum_Park" title="wikilink">One Museum Park</a>, along <a href="Roosevelt_Road_(Chicago)" title="wikilink">Roosevelt Road</a> (12th Street). The redevelopment has extended the street so that it has prominent buildings bordering <a href="Grant_Park_(Chicago)" title="wikilink">Grant Park</a> with Prairie Avenue addresses.</p>
<h2 id="history">History</h2>

<p>Prairie Avenue once served as an <a href="Native_Americans_in_the_United_States" title="wikilink">Indian</a> trail linking <a href="Fort_Dearborn" title="wikilink">Fort Dearborn</a> to <a href="Forts_of_Fort_Wayne,_Indiana" title="wikilink">Fort Wayne</a> in <a href="Indiana" class="uri" title="wikilink">Indiana</a> and thus derived its name from the vast <a href="midwest" title="wikilink">midwestern</a> <a href="prairie" class="uri" title="wikilink">prairie</a> land between the two endpoints.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> In 1812, the <a href="Battle_of_Fort_Dearborn" title="wikilink">Battle of Fort Dearborn</a> occurred in the area that is now the northern section of the street, in what is known as the <a href="Near_South_Side,_Chicago" title="wikilink">Near South Side</a> <a href="Community_areas_of_Chicago" title="wikilink">community area</a>.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> Casualties of the battle, such as <a href="William_Wells_(soldier)" title="wikilink">William Wells</a> and <a href="George_Ronan" title="wikilink">George Ronan</a>, were struck down here.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>Over time, the district has evolved from an upscale neighborhood to a factory district and back to an upscale neighborhood. Zoning in 1853 anticipated residential development, although only one grand villa existed at the time. By 1877 the eleven-block area of Prairie Avenue as well as Calumet Avenue housed elite residences. By 1886 the finest mansions in the city, each equipped with its own carriage house, stood on Prairie Avenue.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> In the 1880s and 1890s, mansions for <a href="George_Pullman" title="wikilink">George Pullman</a>, <a href="Marshall_Field" title="wikilink">Marshall Field</a>, John J.

<p>By 1911, warehouses and factories cramped the Prairie Avenue District. Large industry overtook the district by 1950. Early 21st century deindustrialisation, urban congestion, and historic preservation have brought the return of trendy buildings, and restored as well as renovated structures.

<h2 id="background">Background</h2>

<p>In the 1850s, railroad related industries prospered near the lumber district along the South Branch of the <a href="Chicago_River" title="wikilink">Chicago River</a>. Thus, the business district began to supplant the elegant residences along <a href="Michigan_Avenue_(Chicago)" title="wikilink">Michigan</a> and Wabash Avenues south of Jackson Boulevard.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> Shortly after the <a href="American_Civil_War" title="wikilink">Civil War</a>, the city's wealthy residents settled on Prairie Avenue due to its proximity to the <a href="Chicago_Loop" title="wikilink">Loop</a> less than a mile away and the fact that traveling there did not involve crossing the <a href="Chicago_River" title="wikilink">Chicago River</a>. In 1870, Daniel Thompson erected the first large upper-Prairie Avenue home. <a href="Marshall_Field" title="wikilink">Marshall Field</a> followed in 1871 with a <a href="Richard_Morris_Hunt" title="wikilink">Richard Morris Hunt</a> design.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> Prairie Avenue was the most posh Chicago address by the time of the <a href="Great_Chicago_Fire" title="wikilink">Great Chicago Fire</a> of 1871.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>

Many of Chicago's elite families settled along Prairie Avenue. By the 1870s and 1880s, Prairie Avenue was the location of elaborate houses between 16th Street and 22nd Street (now <a href="Cermak_Road" title="wikilink">Cermak Road</a>).<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> In 1886, the urban elite, including <a href="George_Pullman" title="wikilink">George Pullman</a>, <a href="Marshall_Field" title="wikilink">Marshall Field</a>, <a href="Philip_Armour" title="wikilink">Philip Armour</a> and John B. Sherman all owned family homes in this area that created an opulent Prairie Avenue streetscape reminiscent of European city streets;<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> as such, it was widely regarded as the city's most fashionable neighborhood. Businesses, such as the <a href="Pullman_Company" title="wikilink">Pullman Company</a>, <a href="Armour_&amp;_Company" title="wikilink">Armour &amp; Company</a> and <a href="D.H._Burnham_&amp;_Company" title="wikilink">D.H.

<p>However, as the start of the 20th century came, industry's pervasive reach, increased railroad soot, and an encroaching vice district, caused the area to become less desirable, and the social elite vacated the region for quieter neighborhoods such as <a href="Kenwood,_Chicago" title="wikilink">Kenwood</a>, the <a href="Near_North_Side,_Chicago#Gold_Coast" title="wikilink">Gold Coast</a> and more commonly the suburban <a href="North_Shore_(Chicago)" title="wikilink">North Shore</a>.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> The <em><a href="Chicago_Tribune" title="wikilink">Chicago Tribune</a></em> highlighted 1898 Prairie Avenue as a place that was undesirable to those for whom it was affordable, and unaffordable to those for whom it was desirable.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> Light industry and vacant lots overtook Prairie Avenue during the second half of the 20th century. The elegant mansions were mostly torn down or fell into extreme disrepair.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> By the 1970s, most of the residential buildings had been replaced by factories and parking lots.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> Starting in the late 1990s, the downtown housing market flourished in Chicago and the resulting boom that has transformed many neighborhoods revived Prairie Avenue, causing most of the factories to be demolished or converted to loft condominiums.

<h2 id="influence">Influence</h2>

<p>During the 1870s, 1880s and 1890s, upper Prairie Avenue residents were central to cultural and social fabric of the city. The economy was supported by the thousands of jobs created by the <a href="Pullman_Car_Company" title="wikilink">Pullman Car Company</a> and <a href="Armour_and_Company" title="wikilink">Armour and Company</a>. Chicago's richest man, Marshall Field, changed the buying habits of the city. John Shorthall saved the property from total chaos after the <a href="Great_Chicago_Fire" title="wikilink">Great Chicago Fire</a> by saving property records. At one point in the 1880s, sixteen of the 60 members of the <a href="Commercial_Club_of_Chicago" title="wikilink">Commercial Club of Chicago</a> lived on Prairie Avenue. <a href="George_Armour" title="wikilink">George Armour</a> headed the Chicago Academy of Fine Arts, which became the <a href="Art_Institute_of_Chicago" title="wikilink">Art Institute of Chicago</a>.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> 1801 South Prairie resident, <a href="William_Wallace_Kimball" title="wikilink">William Wallace Kimball</a>, employed about 1500 people around the start of the 20th century in his organ and piano manufacturing company.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> John Glessner, a founder of <a href="International_Harvester" title="wikilink">International Harvester</a>, built what has been described as the centerpiece of the historic district.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a></p>
<p>As a home to many of Chicago's leading families, Prairie Avenue became the base of many important political movements. Woman's <a href="suffrage" class="uri" title="wikilink">suffrage</a> had activists, such as Illinois Women Suffrage Association President Jane Jones, on Prairie Avenue. <em>Illinois Central Railroad Co. v. State of Illinois</em>, , pitted the public welfare of the city against the railroad industry and was the foundation for the public trust doctrine which facilitated the city's reclamation of much of the lakefront. Prairie Avenue residents bolstered other efforts to fight against the railroads. The concentration of wealth also made Prairie Avenue the target of complaints about taxation inequities.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a></p>
<p>Many of these leading families also took part in <a href="philanthropy" class="uri" title="wikilink">philanthropy</a>. John Shorthall, founder of Chicago Title &amp; Trust and Prairie Avenue resident, created the Illinois Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals and convened local and state societies to unite under a national organization (<a href="American_Society_for_the_Prevention_of_Cruelty_to_Animals" title="wikilink">American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals</a>) that could combine its political strength and lobby Congress. The <a href="Illinois_Institute_of_Technology" title="wikilink">Illinois Institute of Technology</a> was a successor entity of the Armour Institute of Technology, which was an outgrowth of the generosity of Philip and <a href="Joseph_Armour" title="wikilink">Joseph Armour</a>.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a></p>
