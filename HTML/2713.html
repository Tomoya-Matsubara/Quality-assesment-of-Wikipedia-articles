<p><strong><em>The Grantville Gazettes</em></strong> are anthologies of short stories set in the <a href="1632_series" title="wikilink">1632 universe</a> introduced in <a href="Eric_Flint" title="wikilink">Eric Flint</a>'s novel <em><a href="1632_(novel)" title="wikilink">1632</a></em>.</p>
<p>The Gazettes started as an experiment: a professionally edited, officially sanctioned &quot;fan magazine&quot; published electronically. Initially released as serialized <a href="e-magazine" title="wikilink">e-magazines</a>, they were later published as <a href="e-book" title="wikilink">e-books</a> (taking a page from the Baen Books experience with E-ARCs&lt;U+2014&gt;Electronic <a href="e-ARC" title="wikilink">Advance Reader Copies</a>, which had been instituted several years earlier.) Because the electronic sales were successful, Baen contracted with Flint for more issues, to be published 3-4 times per year (bimonthly, starting in 2007<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>). Each would form part of the canonical background for the other works (novels and anthologies) in the rapidly growing <a href="1632_series" title="wikilink">1632 series</a>.</p>
<p>As of mid-2012, 41 issues of the electronic magazine have been published and six books have been published (five of those as both hardcover and mass market paperback) excerpted from the first 17 issues of the magazine. A seventh book is promised.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a><a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="origins">Origins</h2>
<p>Separating 1632-verse history from the internet <a href="web_forum" title="wikilink">web fora</a> at <a href="Baen_Books" title="wikilink">Baen Books</a> web site <a href="Baen&#39;s_Bar" title="wikilink">Baen's Bar</a> is impossible, for the forum has shaped the series, as the series has, in part, shaped the forum. Only the <a href="Honorverse" class="uri" title="wikilink">Honorverse</a> web forums of best selling author <a href="David_Weber" title="wikilink">David Weber</a> have been busier than the eventual three special fora set up for 1632-verse topics since 2000, and according to Flint, by 2005 over two hundred-thousand posts had been made on the '1632 Tech' forum alone. Hence, while fan fiction, the Gazettes from the outset differed in important ways from most fan fiction:</p>
<ol>
<li>Flint himself had sought out and accepted ideas and input from fans when beginning the writing of the lead novel <a href="1632_(novel)" title="wikilink">1632</a>. Some of those discussions became back plot for the series, and some were submitted to him as stories.</li>
<li>Flint, caught unaware and unprepared by the demand for a sequel, decided to open up the universe and invite other established authors to help shape the milieu. With all the internet buzz, and having already sought and gotten months of input from the new 1632verse business-only forum &quot;1632 Tech Manual&quot;, he and Baen agreed to include meritorious fan fiction in the collection envisioned. That anthology became <a href="Ring_of_Fire_(anthology)" title="wikilink">Ring of Fire</a>, but was delayed for business reasons&lt;U+2014&gt;sound marketing. David Weber and Flint had threshed out a backplot and agreed to do a 1632 sequel as a novel, and it built upon and integrated the thoughts submitted for <em>Ring of Fire</em>. <a href="Jim_Baen" title="wikilink">Jim Baen</a> sat on <em>Ring of Fire</em>, as anthologies in today's fiction market generally don't sell well, and a series with an anthology as its second work was new ground.</li>
<li>It was professionally edited and produced by experienced persons in the publishing industry, and Flint as gate-keeper for the series canon was unhesitant in turning back poor writing for rewrite or just rejecting same.</li>
<li>If accepted and published, the story background and back plot thereafter was <a href="canon_(fiction)" title="wikilink">canon</a> for the universe&lt;U+2014&gt;if material was published in a Gazette, it became part of the basis of the series thereafter.</li>
</ol>
<p>Issued initially as an electronic quasi-magazine using the publisher's e-ARC distribution system, the original magazine came out only sporadically&lt;U+2014&gt;as Flint and Baen copy editors had time to put early issues together. By the time of the seventh issue in June 2006, three years from the first volume, having proved to be a self-funding success, the publication changed. Along the way, Jim Baen had agreed to try another experiment, and brought out volume 1 in print as a paperback. In March 2006 Baen published volume 2 in hardcover, which became a New York Times best seller.</p>
<p>No longer were issues serialized in three installments, the form of the promotional Baen Webscriptions value packs, but began coming out as a single <a href="ebook" class="uri" title="wikilink">ebook</a> at a much greater regularity. By volume 10, the magazine had hit a regular publication rate of one issue every other month released the first day of odd numbered months, and migrated from being an offering within Baen's catalog of offerings (where they are still listed as ebooks) to having a subscription system administered and accessed from . It is particularly notable in that is composed of short fiction which has spawned no less than three best sellers in an age when the market for short fiction (<a href="anthologies" class="uri" title="wikilink">anthologies</a>) is very poor. In addition, the Grantville Gazettes have served as the source of new ideas and relationships which energize the popular series and find their way into the novels of the 1632 series.</p>
<p>Beginning in early 2007, the Gazette's publishers added an on-line web based edition published quarterly (eventually bimonthly). Additionally, the publishers switched to paying full professional rates instead of the semi-pro rates that had been paid and became an SFWA qualifying market<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> . After the first four volumes, the published book became a &quot;Best of&quot; annual collection.</p>
<h2 id="the-anthology-authors-process">The Anthology Authors Process</h2>
<p>The various authors featured in the Gazettes are part of Flint's online experiment (Phase II) in developing a <a href="milieu" class="uri" title="wikilink">milieu</a> with input from many others on the webforum <a href="Baen&#39;s_Bar" title="wikilink">Baen's Bar</a>. The <a href="1632_Tech_Manual" title="wikilink">1632 Tech Manual</a> (oldstyle: '1632 Tech') sub-section of the Bar focuses on reproducing modern technology in 17th century. The <a href="1632_Slushpile" title="wikilink">1632 Slushpile</a> forum is where authors first submit to a tough <em>peer review process</em>. Once critical readers have deemed the nascent story worthy, the work passes to an editorial board, which also considers how the work will fit into and impact the milieu as currently planned out and plotted. Some stories have thus served as the genesis of their own 1632 universe sub-series or plot thread. This is chaired by Eric Flint, who retains veto power over all work in the 1632 verse, and Eric then decides in which issue or volume of the Gazette the story should be allocated. Authors get paid a sub-professional rate upon the acceptance of the work, and additional financial remuneration and considerations when the anthology reaches print at a later time.</p>
<p><em>The Gazettes</em> thus contain short stories based in the world of Flint's <a href="1632_series" title="wikilink">1632 series</a>, as well as articles about the restrictions on technology available in the time-stranded town and the plausibility of items and redeveloped technology within the <a href="milieu" class="uri" title="wikilink">milieu</a> of the 1632 multiverse. The latter essays are written by members based on findings and results from a more formal subset of contributor-advisors known as the 1632 Technical board. Part of this group also sits on the 1632 Editorial Board.</p>
<h2 id="importance-of-the-gazettes">Importance of the Gazettes</h2>
<p>The impact of individual stories in the Grantville Gazettes will likely never be truly known, because even the bad ones have shaped the action, commentary, and thought on the web-forums <em>1632 Tech</em> and <em>1632 Comments</em>. Even those that fail to meet the final test of espousing '<a href="Canon_(fiction)" title="wikilink">canon</a>' developments in the neohistory have influenced later written works, including those by Flint, who is the final determiner as the sole person involved in each work in the milieu of what is acceptable canon. Considered one way, each story written has the ability of setting a new <a href="Point_of_divergence" title="wikilink">Point of divergence</a>, affecting various storylines. Several fan-written stories have suggested major plotlines, even before the concept of the Grantville Gazettes eMagazine experiment was approved by Jim Baen. Those stories were published alongside established writers in the <a href="Ring_of_Fire_(anthology)" title="wikilink"><em>Ring of Fire</em></a>, and according to Flint, affected other main plotlines like <em><a href="1634:_The_Ram_Rebellion" title="wikilink">1634: The Ram Rebellion</a></em>.</p>
<p>Other Gazette stories have filled in important gaps in terms of economics, sociology, and technology: &quot;The Sewing Circle&quot; deals with four precocious teen friends and their stubborn insistence on making adult contributions. When they succeed, they establish a model for uptimers starting downtime businesses, setting an example that ripples through Grantville. In the sequel, &quot;Other People's Money&quot;, they shake up the European <a href="stock_market" title="wikilink">stock markets</a>, and not inconsequentially, interest the downtime populace in learning more about investing and uptime financial knowledge. Sociologically, their success doomed tailoring guilds, and spawned <em>down-timer</em> publication of popular fiction, inculcating up-timer sociology <em>et cetera</em> via modern novels, especially perhaps, Romance novels. Apparently even downtimers like their soaps! &quot;A Lineman for the Country&quot; along with a couple of other short stories created the forthcoming important ''<a href="1632_series#Eastern_European_thread" title="wikilink">Eastern European thread</a> '', and so on.</p>
<p>Flint has stated that he intends that short stories featuring major characters, or establishing points that will be important in future novels will be collected into the Ring of Fire anthologies, and that The Grantville Gazettes anthologies will feature the stories of characters that don't establish new background for the novels. However, many of the characters or events become more important in retrospect than either the author or editor expected, so this rule is fairly weak, as shown in the Other People's Money example.</p>
<p>On another level entirely, the gazette stories are just stories. Since they tend to focus on the ground-level interactions of their protagonists, and those characters tend to repeat, not only in subsequent stories by the same author, but in stories by others, Flint has characterized them in part as soap-operas in the preface to Grantville Gazette IV</p>
<h2 id="print-publication">Print publication</h2>
<p>Starting in November 2004, the first <em>Gazette</em> was also released experimentally in a paper edition with issue I as a paperback. The second volume was released in hardcover in March 2006, this and subsequent titles use Roman Numerals for titles such as are listed below in the section <em>List of Gazettes</em>, as appear on the print publication covers.</p>
<p>Each print edition contains an additional story that was not published in any e-magazine. Starting with volume V, each print edition contains stories from several of the magazines, and not all magazine stories are published in the books. The List of Gazettes section below gives the publication dates and a rough guide to which magazines are collected into particular books.</p>
