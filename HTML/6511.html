<p><strong>Crystal Palace Football Club</strong> is an English professional <a href="Association_football" title="wikilink">football</a> <a href="Football_team" title="wikilink">club</a> based in <a href="South_Norwood" title="wikilink">South Norwood</a>, London. During the <a href="2012&lt;U+2013&gt;13_Football_League" title="wikilink">2012&lt;U+2013&gt;13 Football League</a> season, Palace finished fifth and gained promotion to the <a href="Premier_League" title="wikilink">Premier League</a> through the play-offs. Their colours are red and blue, although they had adopted a claret and pale blue strip of <a href="Aston_Villa_F.C." title="wikilink">Aston Villa</a> in their early years and later played in white shirts inspired by Real Madrid. The club was founded at <a href="The_Crystal_Palace" title="wikilink">The Crystal Palace</a> in 1905 to introduce a team to the local population, who regularly supported the <a href="FA_Cup_Final" title="wikilink">FA Cup Final</a> in sizeable numbers. Failing to gain election to <a href="The_Football_League" title="wikilink">The Football League</a>, Palace instead joined the <a href="Southern_Football_League" title="wikilink">Southern Football League</a> Second Division, playing home games at The Crystal Palace, inspiration for the club's initial nickname, &quot;The Glaziers&quot;. Palace won the Division and promotion in their first season, and played in the Southern League First Division for the next fifteen years.</p>
<p>In 1920 the Southern League Division One formed the <a href="Football_League_Third_Division" title="wikilink">Football League Third Division</a>. Palace won the division and gained promotion to the <a href="Football_League_Second_Division" title="wikilink">Second Division</a>, where they spent four seasons before suffering relegation to the <a href="Third_Division_South" title="wikilink">Third Division South</a>. In 1958 a league re-organisation saw Palace become founder members of <a href="Football_League_Fourth_Division" title="wikilink">Division Four</a>. Over the next eleven years the club moved from the lowest rung of English Football to the highest, reaching the <a href="Football_League_First_Division" title="wikilink">First Division</a> in 1968. In 1973 the club modernised its image, changing the nickname from The Glaziers to &quot;The Eagles&quot; and ending the 68-year association with claret and blue by introducing the red-and-blue vertical stripes now associated with the club. The club stabilised itself in the top two divisions with successive promotions in 1977 and 1979. The period from 1989&lt;U+2013&gt;91 saw <a href="Steve_Coppell" title="wikilink">Steve Coppell</a> guide the team to an FA Cup Final and third place in the First Division. Palace became founder members of the Premier League in 1992, but were relegated the same season. Palace entered administration in both 2000 and 2010, and are now owned by a consortium of four. The club achieved promotion back to the Premier League under manager <a href="Ian_Holloway" title="wikilink">Ian Holloway</a> with a 1&lt;U+2013&gt;0 win over <a href="Watford_F.C." title="wikilink">Watford F.C.</a> in the <a href="Football_League_play-offs" title="wikilink">Football League play-offs</a> of 2013.</p>
<p>Crystal Palace initially played their games in the grounds of The Crystal Palace, but the <a href="First_World_War" title="wikilink">First World War</a> saw them forced to move out, and they enjoyed a number of seasons at both the <a href="Herne_Hill_Velodrome" title="wikilink">Herne Hill Velodrome</a> and <a href="Croydon_Common_Athletic_Ground" title="wikilink">The Nest</a>. Since <a href="1925&lt;U+2013&gt;26_in_English_football" title="wikilink">1925</a>, Palace have played their home games at <a href="Selhurst_Park" title="wikilink">Selhurst Park</a>. They have a fierce rivalry with <a href="M23_motorway" title="wikilink">M23</a> neighbours <a href="Brighton_&amp;_Hove_Albion_F.C." title="wikilink">Brighton</a>, with whom they have contested the <a href="M23_derby" title="wikilink">M23 derby</a> 98 times. They also enjoy rivalries with fellow <a href="South_London_derby" title="wikilink">South London teams</a> <a href="Millwall_F.C." title="wikilink">Millwall</a> and <a href="Charlton_Athletic_F.C." title="wikilink">Charlton Athletic</a>. The club's kit is currently made by Avec, a subsidiary of <a href="Nike,_Inc." title="wikilink">Nike</a>, and the shirt sponsor is <a href="GAC_Logistics" title="wikilink">GAC Logistics</a>. The club captain is <a href="Paddy_McCarthy" title="wikilink">Paddy McCarthy</a> and the current player of the year is <a href="Mile_Jedinak" title="wikilink">Mile Jedinak</a>. <a href="Edmund_Goodman" title="wikilink">Edmund Goodman</a> is the club's longest serving manager, and <a href="Jim_Cannon" title="wikilink">Jim Cannon</a> has made the most appearances for the club. <a href="Peter_Simpson_(Scottish_footballer)" title="wikilink">Peter Simpson</a> is the club's top scorer for both one season and overall, netting 54 and 165 respectively. The highest transfer fee received has been for <a href="Wilfried_Zaha" title="wikilink">Wilfried Zaha</a> from <a href="Manchester_United_F.C." title="wikilink">Manchester United</a> in January 2013 and the highest paid has been to <a href="Peterborough_United_F.C." title="wikilink">Peterborough</a> for <a href="Dwight_Gayle" title="wikilink">Dwight Gayle</a> in July 2013.</p>

Year Book for 1912&lt;U+2013&gt;13" /> The original <a href="Crystal_Palace_F.C._(1861)" title="wikilink">Crystal Palace</a> football club was an amateur team founded circa <a href="1860s_in_association_football" title="wikilink">1861</a> and who competed in the first <a href="FA_Cup_1871-72" title="wikilink">FA Cup</a>, reaching the <a href="FA_Cup_Semi-finals" title="wikilink">semi-finals</a> where the team was eliminated by the <a href="Royal_Engineers_A.F.C." title="wikilink">Royal Engineers</a>. The team disappear from historical records after a 3&lt;U+2013&gt;0 defeat to <a href="Wanderers_F.C." title="wikilink">Wanderers</a> in the second round of the 1875&lt;U+2013&gt;76 <a href="FA_Cup" title="wikilink">FA Cup</a>. However, this was not the end of an association between Crystal Palace and the FA Cup. In 1895 the FA adopted a new permanent home for the final, at <a href="The_Crystal_Palace" title="wikilink">The Crystal Palace</a>. With the owners of the attraction reliant on tourist activity for their income, they sought fresh attractions for the venue, and it did not take long for the idea of forming their own team to play at the ground to occur.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a><a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>The modern Crystal Palace Football Club, originally nicknamed &quot;The Glaziers&quot;, was formed on 10 September 1905 under the guidance of <a href="Aston_Villa_F.C." title="wikilink">Aston Villa</a> assistant secretary Edmund Goodman.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> The club applied to enter the <a href="Football_League" title="wikilink">Football League</a> alongside <a href="Chelsea_F.C." title="wikilink">Chelsea</a> and <a href="Southampton_F.C." title="wikilink">Southampton</a>, but was the only unsuccessful team of the three. The club instead found itself in the <a href="Southern_Football_League" title="wikilink">Southern League</a> Second Division for the <a href="1905&lt;U+2013&gt;06_Football_League" title="wikilink">1905&lt;U+2013&gt;06</a> season. The club was successful in its inaugural season and was <a href="Promotion_and_relegation" title="wikilink">promoted</a> to the First Division, crowned as champions.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> In their first season Crystal Palace also played in the mid-week United Counties League, finishing runner-up to <a href="Watford_F.C." title="wikilink">Watford</a>, and it was in this competition that the club played their first match, winning 3&lt;U+2013&gt;0 away to <a href="New_Brompton_F.C." title="wikilink">New Brompton</a>.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a><a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p>Palace remained in the Southern League up until 1914, their one highlight the <a href="Newcastle_United_F.C._0&lt;U+2013&gt;1_Crystal_Palace_F.C._(1907)" title="wikilink">1907 shock First Round victory</a> over <a href="Newcastle_United" title="wikilink">Newcastle</a> in the <a href="FA_Cup" title="wikilink">FA Cup</a>.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a><a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> The outbreak of World War I led to the <a href="Admiralty" class="uri" title="wikilink">Admiralty</a> requisitioning The Crystal Palace and the club was forced to move to the home of <a href="West_Norwood_F.C." title="wikilink">West Norwood F.C.</a>, <a href="Herne_Hill" title="wikilink">Herne Hill</a>.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> Three years later the club moved again to <a href="Croydon_Common_Athletic_Ground" title="wikilink">The Nest</a> due to the folding of <a href="Croydon_Common_F.C." title="wikilink">Croydon Common F.C.</a> The club joined the <a href="Football_League" title="wikilink">Football League</a> <a href="Football_League_Third_Division" title="wikilink">Third Division</a> in the <a href="1920&lt;U+2013&gt;21_Football_League" title="wikilink">1920&lt;U+2013&gt;21 season</a>, finishing as champions and gaining promotion to the <a href="Football_League_Second_Division" title="wikilink">Second Division</a>. Palace moved to the purpose-built stadium <a href="Selhurst_Park" title="wikilink">Selhurst Park</a> in 1924, the ground the club plays at today.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a><a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<p>The opening fixture at Selhurst Park was against <a href="Sheffield_Wednesday_F.C." title="wikilink">Sheffield Wednesday</a>, Palace losing 0&lt;U+2013&gt;1 in front of a crowd of 25,000. Finishing 21st that season, the club was relegated to the <a href="Football_League_Third_Division_South" title="wikilink">Third Division South</a>. Before <a href="World_War_II" title="wikilink">World War II</a> Palace made good efforts at promotion, never finishing outside the top half of the table and finishing second on three occasions. They were less successful after the war, their highest position being seventh, and conversely on three occasions the club had to apply for <a href="Re-election_(Football_League)" title="wikilink">re-election</a>. The club remained in Division Three South until <a href="1957&lt;U+2013&gt;58_in_English_football" title="wikilink">1957&lt;U+2013&gt;58</a>. A league reorganisation would see clubs in in the bottom half of the table merge with those in the bottom half of Division Three North to form a new <a href="Football_League_Fourth_Division" title="wikilink">Fourth Division</a>. Palace finished 14th &lt;U+2013&gt; just below the cut &lt;U+2013&gt; and found itself in the basement of English football. Their stay proved brief. With <a href="Arthur_Rowe" title="wikilink">Arthur Rowe</a> appointed manager, the <a href="1960&lt;U+2013&gt;61_in_English_football" title="wikilink">1960&lt;U+2013&gt;61</a> season saw Palace gain promotion. Although Rowe stepped down for health reasons, the promotion proved a turning point in the club's history. <a href="Dick_Graham" title="wikilink">Dick Graham</a> and then <a href="Bert_Head" title="wikilink">Bert Head</a> guided the club to successive promotions in <a href="1963&lt;U+2013&gt;64_in_English_football" title="wikilink">1963&lt;U+2013&gt;64</a> and <a href="1968&lt;U+2013&gt;69_in_English_football" title="wikilink">1968&lt;U+2013&gt;69</a>, taking the club through the Second Division and into the heights of the <a href="Football_League_First_Division" title="wikilink">First Division</a>.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<p>Despite surviving in the top flight from 1969 until 1972, the club once again experienced great disappointment. Under the management of <a href="Malcolm_Allison" title="wikilink">Malcolm Allison</a> the club was relegated in consecutive seasons, finding itself back in Division Three for the <a href="1974&lt;U+2013&gt;75_in_English_football" title="wikilink">1974&lt;U+2013&gt;75 season</a>. It was under Allison that the club became nicknamed &quot;The Eagles&quot; and they enjoyed a run to the semi-final of the <a href="1975-76_FA_Cup" title="wikilink">1975-76 FA Cup</a>, beating <a href="Leeds_United_F.C." title="wikilink">Leeds</a> and <a href="Chelsea_F.C." title="wikilink">Chelsea</a> along the way. Allison was sacked at the end of the 1975&lt;U+2013&gt;76 campaign, and it was under <a href="Terry_Venables" title="wikilink">Terry Venables</a>' management that Palace was promoted in <a href="1976&lt;U+2013&gt;77_in_English_football" title="wikilink">1976&lt;U+2013&gt;77</a> and again in <a href="1978&lt;U+2013&gt;79_in_English_football" title="wikilink">1978&lt;U+2013&gt;79</a> back up to the First Division. The club could not maintain their position in the top tier, however, and was relegated from the First Division in in <a href="1980&lt;U+2013&gt;81_in_English_football" title="wikilink">1980&lt;U+2013&gt;81</a>, coinciding with <a href="Ron_Noades" title="wikilink">Ron Noades</a> takeover of the club. <a href="Steve_Coppell" title="wikilink">Steve Coppell</a> arrived as manager on 4 June 1984, and under his stewardship and rebuilding the club achieved promotion via the <a href="Football_League_play-offs" title="wikilink">play-offs</a> back to the First Division in <a href="1988&lt;U+2013&gt;89_in_English_football" title="wikilink">1988&lt;U+2013&gt;89</a>. The club followed this up by reaching the <a href="1990_FA_Cup_Final" title="wikilink">1990 FA Cup Final</a>, drawing 3&lt;U+2013&gt;3 with <a href="Manchester_United_F.C." title="wikilink">Manchester United</a> in the first match but losing the replay 1&lt;U+2013&gt;0. The club built on the success of the previous season in <a href="1990&lt;U+2013&gt;91_in_English_football" title="wikilink">1990&lt;U+2013&gt;91</a> by achieving its highest league finish of third and returning to Wembley to win the <a href="Full_Members_Cup" title="wikilink">Zenith Data Systems Cup</a>. The club beat <a href="Everton_F.C." title="wikilink">Everton</a> 4&lt;U+2013&gt;1 (<a href="extra_time" title="wikilink">after extra time</a>) in the final, its only cup win to date.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> The following season saw star striker <a href="Ian_Wright" title="wikilink">Ian Wright</a> leave the club for <a href="Arsenal_F.C." title="wikilink">Arsenal</a>. Palace finished tenth, allowing the club to become a founding member of the <a href="1992&lt;U+2013&gt;93_FA_Premier_League" title="wikilink">FA Premier League</a> in 1992&lt;U+2013&gt;93.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>

The club found itself relegated with a record 49 points. Steve Coppell resigned and <a href="Alan_Smith_(manager)" title="wikilink">Alan Smith</a>, his assistant at the club, took over. His first season saw the club win the First Division title and gain promotion to the Premier League.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> Their stay on this occasion proved eventful. On 25 January 1995 Palace played <a href="Manchester_United_F.C." title="wikilink">Manchester United</a> at Selhurst Park in which <a href="Eric_Cantona" title="wikilink">Eric Cantona</a> was sent off. He was taunted by Palace fan Matthew Simmons,<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> and retaliated with a flying kick.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> Cantona was sentenced to two weeks in jail,<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> reduced to 120 hours <a href="community_service" title="wikilink">community service</a> on appeal. Simmons was immediately banned from Selhurst Park,<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> and found guilty on two charges of threatening Cantona.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> More was to follow in March, when <a href="Chris_Armstrong_(footballer_born_1971)" title="wikilink">Chris Armstrong</a> was suspended by the FA for failing a drugs test.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> On the field, Alan Smith guided the club to the semi finals of both the FA Cup and the <a href="Football_League_Cup" title="wikilink">League Cup</a>, but League form was a concern and Palace once again found itself relegated, finishing fourth from bottom as the Premier League reduced from 22 to 20 clubs.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a></p>
<p>Smith left the club and Steve Coppell returned as technical director in the summer of 1995, and through a combination of the first-team coaching of <a href="Ray_Lewington" title="wikilink">Ray Lewington</a> and latterly <a href="Dave_Bassett" title="wikilink">Dave Bassett</a>'s managership Palace reached the <a href="Football_League_play-offs" title="wikilink">play-offs</a>. Palace lost the <a href="1995_Football_League_First_Division_play-off_Final" title="wikilink">final</a> in dramatic fashion, <a href="Steve_Claridge" title="wikilink">Steve Claridge</a> scoring a last minute goal for <a href="Leicester_City_F.C." title="wikilink">Leicester City</a> to win the tie 1&lt;U+2013&gt;0. The following season saw Coppell take charge as first-team manager when Dave Bassett departed for <a href="Nottingham_Forest_F.C." title="wikilink">Nottingham Forest</a> in early 1997<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> The club was successful in the play-offs at the second time of asking when the club defeated <a href="Sheffield_United_F.C." title="wikilink">Sheffield United</a> in the final at Wembley.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a></p>
<p>This stay in the Premier League was no more successful than the previous two, and in true <a href="yo-yo_club" title="wikilink">yo-yo club</a> fashion the club was relegated back to the First Division for the <a href="1998&lt;U+2013&gt;99_in_English_football" title="wikilink">1998&lt;U+2013&gt;99</a> season. This season also saw the club plunged into <a href="Administration_(insolvency)" title="wikilink">administration</a> when owner <a href="Mark_Goldberg" title="wikilink">Mark Goldberg</a> was unable to sustain his financial backing of the club.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> The club emerged from administration under the ownership of <a href="Simon_Jordan" title="wikilink">Simon Jordan</a>, and Steve Coppell left the club, replaced by Alan Smith for a second time. The club flirted with relegation in Jordan's first season, <a href="2000-01_in_English_football" title="wikilink">2000&lt;U+2013&gt;01</a>. Smith was sacked in April and <a href="Steve_Kember" title="wikilink">Steve Kember</a> managed to win the two remaining fixtures that would guarantee survival, <a href="Dougie_Freedman" title="wikilink">Dougie Freedman</a> scoring the winner in a 1&lt;U+2013&gt;0 victory over <a href="Stockport_County_F.C." title="wikilink">Stockport</a> in the 87th minute on the final day of the season. <a href="Steve_Bruce" title="wikilink">Steve Bruce</a> was appointed manager for the <a href="2001-02_in_English_football" title="wikilink">2001&lt;U+2013&gt;02</a> season.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> A good start to the season gave Palace hope for a promotion challenge, but Bruce attempted to walk out on the club after just four months at the helm to take charge of <a href="Birmingham_City_F.C." title="wikilink">Birmingham City</a>.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a><a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> After a short spell on 'gardening leave',<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> Bruce was eventually allowed to join Birmingham City,<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> succeeded by <a href="Trevor_Francis" title="wikilink">Trevor Francis</a>, who had ironically been his predecessor at Birmingham.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a></p>

<p>During the close season CPFC 2010, a consortium consisting of several wealthy fans successfully negotiated the purchase of the club.

Freedman was appointed manager on a full-time basis on 11 January 2011,<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> with former Charlton boss <a href="Lennie_Lawrence" title="wikilink">Lennie Lawrence</a> as his assistant and <a href="Tony_Popovic" title="wikilink">Tony Popovic</a> as first team coach. Palace edged up the table and by securing a 1&lt;U+2013&gt;1 draw at <a href="Hull_City_A.F.C." title="wikilink">Hull City</a> on 30 April, the club was safe from relegation with one game of the season left. Freedman departed to manage <a href="Bolton_Wanderers_F.C." title="wikilink">Bolton</a> on 23 October 2012,<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> and in November 2012 Ian Holloway became the club's manager. He guided Palace to the <a href="Premier_League" title="wikilink">Premier League</a> after an 8-year absence by defeating <a href="Watford" title="wikilink">Watford F.C.</a> 1&lt;U+2013&gt;0 in the Championship Play-Off Final.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a></p>

<p>When Crystal Palace were founded in 1905, they turned to one of the biggest clubs in the country at the time, <a href="Aston_Villa_F.C." title="wikilink">Aston Villa</a>, to seek advice. Villa helped the club in a number of ways, not least by donating their kit.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a><a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> As a result, Palace's colours were originally claret and blue shirts paired with white shorts, socks tending to be claret. They kept to this formula fairly consistently until 1938. The 1937&lt;U+2013&gt;38 strip saw them try vertical stripes of claret and blue on the jersey rather than the claret body and blue sleeves, but then in 1938 they abandoned the claret and blue and adopted white shirts and black shorts with matching socks. Although they returned to claret and blue from 1949&lt;U+2013&gt;54, the 1955 season saw them return to white and black, now using claret and blue as trim.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a></p>

The club employed variations upon this theme up until <a href="Malcolm_Allison" title="wikilink">Malcolm Allison</a>'s arrival as manager in 1973.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a> Allison overhauled the club's image, adopting red and blue horizontal stripes for colours and kit, inspired by <a href="Barcelona_FC" title="wikilink">Barcelona</a>.<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> The club have played in variations of red and blue ever since, bar the centenary season of 2005 which saw them deploy a version of their 1971&lt;U+2013&gt;72 claret, blue and white kit.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a></p>
<p>The club were relatively late in establishing a crest. Although the initials were embroidered onto the shirt from the 1935&lt;U+2013&gt;36 season, it wasn't until 1955 that a crest featuring the fa&lt;U+00E7&gt;ade of <a href="the_Crystal_Palace" title="wikilink">the Crystal Palace</a> appeared. This crest disappeared from the shirt in 1964, and the team's name appeared embroidered on shirts in 1967&lt;U+2013&gt;72. 1972 saw a round badge adopted with the club's initials and nickname &quot;The Glaziers&quot; before Allison changed this too.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a> The nickname became &quot;The Eagles&quot;, inspired by <a href="Portugal" title="wikilink">Portuguese</a> club <a href="SL_Benfica" title="wikilink">Benfica</a>, and the badge adopted an eagle holding a ball.<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a> This emblem remained until 1987 when the club married the eagle with the Crystal Palace fa&lt;U+00E7&gt;ade,<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a> and although updated in 2006 and again in 2013 the crest retains these features.<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="stadium">Stadium</h2>

<p>In 1905, the owners of the <a href="FA_Cup_Final" title="wikilink">FA Cup Final</a> venue, The Crystal Palace Company wanted a professional club to play there and tap into the crowd potential of the area. A new club, Crystal Palace F.C., was formed to use the <a href="Crystal_Palace_National_Sports_Centre" title="wikilink">ground</a>.<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a> When <a href="World_War_I" title="wikilink">World War I</a> broke out the Palace and grounds were seized by the military, and in 1915 the club were forced to move by <a href="The_Admiralty" title="wikilink">The Admiralty</a>. They found a temporary base at the <a href="Herne_Hill_Velodrome" title="wikilink">Herne Hill Velodrome</a>. Although other clubs had offered the use of their ground to Palace, the club felt it best to remain as close to their natural catchment area as possible.<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a> When <a href="Croydon_Common_F.C." title="wikilink">Croydon Common</a> were wound up in 1917, the club took over their old stadium at <a href="The_Nest_(london_football_ground)" title="wikilink">The Nest</a>,<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a> but in 1919 they began the purchase of the land on which they would build <a href="Selhurst_Park" title="wikilink">Selhurst Park</a>, their current home.<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a></p>
<p><a href="Archibald_Leitch" title="wikilink">Archibald Leitch</a>, the renowned stadium architect, was employed to draw up plans, and the club constructed and completed the ground in time for the <a href="1924-25_in_English_football" title="wikilink">1924&lt;U+2013&gt;25 season</a>.<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a> It remained relatively unchanged, with only the introduction of floodlights and maintenance and updating until 1969 when the Arthur Wait stand was constructed. The Main Stand became all-seater in 1979 and more work followed in the 1980s when the Whitehorse Lane End was redeveloped to allow for a <a href="Sainsbury&#39;s" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sainsbury's</a> supermarket, club offices and a club shop. The Arthur Wait stand became all seater in 1990, and in 1994 the Holmesdale Terrace was redeveloped, replaced with a two tier Stand. Selhurst's attendance record was set in 1979, with an official total of 51,482.<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a> After all the redevelopments to the ground and safety requirements due to the <a href="Taylor_Report" title="wikilink">Taylor Report</a>, the ground's current capacity is 26,309.<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a> Proposals were put forward to move the club back to the Crystal Palace National Stadium in 2010,<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a> but after the club gained promotion to the <a href="Premier_League" title="wikilink">Premier League</a> in 2013 there has been a renewed focus on redeveloping their current home into a 40,000 seater stadium.<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a><a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a></p>

<h2 id="supporters-and-rivalries">Supporters and rivalries</h2>
<p>Crystal Palace have a fan base drawn predominantly from the local area which draws on both <a href="South_London" title="wikilink">South London</a>, <a href="Kent" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kent</a> and <a href="Surrey" class="uri" title="wikilink">Surrey</a>. The club's original home, The Crystal Palace, was in the boundary of Kent, while Selhurst Park was within Surrey's borders until the&lt;U+00A0&gt;<a href="London_Government_Act_1963" title="wikilink">London Government Act 1963</a> saw <a href="Greater_London" title="wikilink">Greater London</a> encompass <a href="Croydon" class="uri" title="wikilink">Croydon</a>. The fans have established at least two supporters groups. The Palace Independent Supporters Association was set up to raise supporter concerns with the club,<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a> while the Crystal Palace Supporters' Trust was originally established to enable fans to purchase the club during the administration of 2000. The Trust remained in existence, and now lists one of its aims as building &quot;a new state-of-the-art training ground to lease to the Club&quot;.<a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a></p>
<p>A number of <a href="fanzines" class="uri" title="wikilink">fanzines</a> have been produced by the fans over the years. <em>Eagle Eye</em> launched in 1987 and ran until 1994, with a number of contributors launching the replacement <em>Palace Echo</em> in 1995, running until 2007.<a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a> <em>The Eastern Eagles</em>, <em>So Glad Your Mine</em> and <em>One More Point</em> were also published by fans in the 1990s.<a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a> When <em>One More Point</em> ceased publication, <em>Five Year Plan</em> launched in its place,<a href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a> and maintains an online presence.<a href="#fn67" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a> Supporters also congregate on two <a href="internet_forum" title="wikilink">internet forums</a>, The BBS and Holmesdale.net which the club use as channels to communicate with fans.<a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a></p>
<p><img src="Selhurst_Park.jpg" title="fig:Crystal Palace fans express support for the club during the administration of 2010." alt="Crystal Palace fans express support for the club during the administration of 2010." /> Being a London club means they compete against a number of other local clubs for the attention of supporters but the club does have a recognisably large catchment area of 900,000.<a href="#fn69" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref69"><sup>69</sup></a><a href="#fn70" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a> When the new owners took control of the club in 2010, they sought the fans' input into future decisions. They consulted on a new badge design, and when their chosen designs were rejected the club instead opted for a design based on a fan's idea from an internet forum.<a href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a> The club are also strengthening their ties with the local community, and through the Crystal Palace F.C. Foundation they work with local London boroughs of Croydon, Bromley and Sutton to provide sports and educational programmes. Through this work the club hope to develop their supporter base and geographical base. The Foundation's work was recognised by The Football League in August 2009 with their Silver Standard Community Scheme Award.<a href="#fn72" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref72"><sup>72</sup></a></p>
<p>Because of their location in the capital, Crystal Palace are involved in a number of local derbies, mostly across <a href="South_London_derby" title="wikilink">South London</a>. Their most prominent are with <a href="Brighton_&amp;_Hove_Albion_F.C." title="wikilink">Brighton &amp; Hove Albion</a> and <a href="Millwall_F.C." title="wikilink">Millwall</a>, with a smaller rivalry enjoyed with former tenants <a href="Charlton_Athletic_F.C." title="wikilink">Charlton</a>.<a href="#fn73" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref73"><sup>73</sup></a> The club's rivalry with Brighton, known as the <a href="M23_derby" title="wikilink">M23 derby</a>, did not develop until Palace's relegation to the Third Division in 1974, reaching its height when the two teams were drawn together in the first round of the 1976&lt;U+2013&gt;77 FA Cup. The game went to two replays, but the controversy was based on referee Ron Challis ordering a successful Brighton penalty be retaken because of Palace player encroachment. The retake was saved, Palace won the game 1&lt;U+2013&gt;0 and a fierce rivalry was born.<a href="#fn74" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref74"><sup>74</sup></a></p>
