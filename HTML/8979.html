<p><a href="Nine_Inch_Nails" title="wikilink">Nine Inch Nails</a>, an <a href="industrial_rock" title="wikilink">industrial rock</a> band <a href="frontman" title="wikilink">fronted</a> by <a href="Trent_Reznor" title="wikilink">Trent Reznor</a>, has performed throughout the world, including tours in North America, South America, Europe, Australia, Japan, and China. While Reznor controls the creative and musical direction of Nine Inch Nails in-studio, the touring band performs different arrangements of the songs in live settings. In addition to regular concerts, the band has performed in both supporting and headlining roles at festivals such as <a href="Woodstock_&#39;94" title="wikilink">Woodstock '94</a>, <a href="Lollapalooza" class="uri" title="wikilink">Lollapalooza</a> 1991 and 2008, as well as many other one-off performances including the <a href="MTV_Video_Music_Awards" title="wikilink">MTV Video Music Awards</a>.</p>
<p>Nine Inch Nails' live performances contrast with its in-studio counterpart.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a><a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> Reznor writes and performs nearly all Nine Inch Nails studio material, with occasional instrumental and vocal contributions from others artists. However, Reznor has typically assembled groups of backing musicians to interpret songs for tours and other live performances. Keyboardist <a href="Alessandro_Cortini" title="wikilink">Alessandro Cortini</a> said that &quot;if you see the show and you're used to the CDs it's pretty clear that the studio entity is different from the live entity&quot;.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>The only constant member of the live band is Reznor, who cites the long periods of time between major tours as one reason for the ever-changing live lineup. Live Nine Inch Nails performances are typically accompanied by lighting, stage, and video projection effects. Since 1999, the visual design components of live shows have been curated by Reznor with <a href="Rob_Sheridan" title="wikilink">Rob Sheridan</a>. Three tours have been chronicled on live albums and tour documentaries.</p>
<p>Critical and commercial response to Nine Inch Nails live performances has generally been positive. Critics have pointed to the concerts' aggressive on-stage dynamic and visual designs as high points. Reznor decided in 2008 to cease touring with the band after a 2009 farewell tour.</p>

The three-piece band consisted of Reznor on guitars and lead vocals, Ron Musarra on drums, and <a href="Chris_Vrenna" title="wikilink">Chris Vrenna</a> on keyboards.

<p>In support of Nine Inch Nails' third full-length studio album, <em><a href="The_Fragile" title="wikilink">The Fragile</a></em>, the live-band reformed for the Fragility tour.

<p>Nine Inch Nails' record label at the time, <a href="Interscope_Records" title="wikilink">Interscope Records</a>, reportedly refused to fund the promotional tour following <em>The Fragile</em>'s lukewarm sales. Reznor instead committed himself to fund the entire tour out of his own pocket, concluding that &quot;The reality is, I&lt;U+2019&gt;m broke at the end of the tour,&quot; but also adding &quot;I will never present a show that isn&lt;U+2019&gt;t fantastic.&quot;<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a></p>
<p>The Fragility tour began in late 1999, running until mid-2000, and was broken into two major legs, Fragility 1.0 and Fragility 2.0 respectively.

<p>Following the release of <em><a href="With_Teeth" title="wikilink">With Teeth</a></em> in 2005, the live band was reassembled for the Live: With Teeth tour. Since the previous tour five years earlier, much of band had moved on in their careers, and only drummer Jerome Dillon rejoined.

<p>Nine Inch Nails were scheduled to perform at the 2005 <a href="MTV_Movie_Awards" title="wikilink">MTV Movie Awards</a>, but dropped themselves from the show due to a disagreement with the network over the use of an unaltered image of <a href="George_W._Bush" title="wikilink">George W.

In an effort to combat <a href="Ticket_resale" title="wikilink">ticket scalpers</a>, each concert ticket will list the purchaser's legal name. The ticketing process was previously used for smaller pre-sales and was available exclusively to fan club members.<a href="#fn70" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a><a href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a> On July 26, Trent Reznor introduced an &quot;unplugged&quot; portion into the live show in which the band steps to the front of the stage about an hour into the show, with Reznor on vibraphone and bassist Justin Meldal-Johnsen playing an upright bass. The 20-minute jazzy, acoustic set is taken mostly from <em>Ghosts I - IV</em>. The stage show also featured mesh LED curtains that projected various visuals, ranging from falling rain to static to a ruined city, and made the band appear to be playing on &quot;a stage that appeared to be constructed entirely out of lights.&quot;<a href="#fn72" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref72"><sup>72</sup></a> <a href="Nine_Inch_Nails" title="wikilink">Nine Inch Nails</a> later confirmed that the tour was to extend to South America and it was thought this would be the last <a href="Americas" class="uri" title="wikilink">Americas</a> set of dates but soon after Reznor announced yet more North American dates including two dates in tourist capital <a href="Florida" class="uri" title="wikilink">Florida</a>.</p>
<p>On October 8, 2008, after finishing up their last show in South America, Trent Reznor posted on the official Nine Inch Nails website blog that Josh Freese would be leaving the band following the completion of the current tour.<a href="#fn73" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref73"><sup>73</sup></a> Shortly after, it was announced that Alessandro Cortini would also be leaving the band.

<p>In 2008, Reznor decided to put Nine Inch Nails on indefinite hiatus. He later clarified that &quot;NIN as a touring live band or live band that's on the road all the time [would be] stopping&quot; after a comprehensive tour, but that he would continue to produce music thereafter.<a href="#fn74" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref74"><sup>74</sup></a></p>
<p>After a set of shows in Australia and New Zealand, NIN embarked on a North American tour of amphitheatres with <a href="Jane&#39;s_Addiction" title="wikilink">Jane's Addiction</a> and <a href="Street_Sweeper_Social_Club" title="wikilink">Street Sweeper Social Club</a> dubbed &quot;NIN/JA 2009&quot;. Concerts in Europe and Asia were also announced before Reznor added a series of smaller-venue shows in New York, Chicago, and Los Angeles. The final show was on September 10th, 2009.</p>
<h2 id="visual-elements">Visual elements</h2>
<p>Visual elements employed during Nine Inch Nails concerts have often included numerous lighting, stage and projection effects employed to accompany and augment presentation.<a href="#fn75" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref75"><sup>75</sup></a> Prior to the Fragility tour in 2000, Reznor reflected that &quot;I&lt;U+2019&gt;ve adopted a philosophy of the way to present Nine Inch Nails live that incorporates a theatrical element. I want it to be drama. I want my rock stars to be larger than life, you know? The <a href="Kurt_Cobain" title="wikilink">Kurt Cobains</a> of the world, I&lt;U+2019&gt;m sick of that shit. I don&lt;U+2019&gt;t want a gas station attendant being my hero. I grew up with <a href="Gene_Simmons" title="wikilink">Gene Simmons</a>. I grew up with <a href="The_Rise_and_Fall_of_Ziggy_Stardust_and_the_Spiders_from_Mars" title="wikilink">Ziggy Stardust</a>.&quot;<a href="#fn76" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref76"><sup>76</sup></a></p>
<p>Many songs are typically accompanied with specially designed visual aids, including synchronized lighting effects and projected stock-footage montages. Early performances of the song &quot;<a href="Hurt_(Nine_Inch_Nails_song)" title="wikilink">Hurt</a>&quot;, for example, were accompanied by a projected montage of clouds, charred bodies, mushroom clouds, maggots, and war refugees,<a href="#fn77" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref77"><sup>77</sup></a> a performance of which is featured in the song's music video. Recent performances of the song, however, have featured less lighting effects.<a href="#fn78" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref78"><sup>78</sup></a></p>

</figure>
<p>Since 1999, the visual presentation of Nine Inch Nails live shows have been directed by <a href="Rob_Sheridan" title="wikilink">Rob Sheridan</a>, while Bill Viola designed a large triptych display for the Fragility tour.<a href="#fn79" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref79"><sup>79</sup></a> The images displayed on the triptych focused on storm and water imagery. <em><a href="And_All_That_Could_Have_Been" title="wikilink">And All That Could Have Been</a></em> features an audio commentary track by Viola describing the display and his inspirations for it.<a href="#fn80" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref80"><sup>80</sup></a></p>
<p>For the Live: With Teeth tour, Roy Bennett and Martin Phillips were responsible for the lighting design and stage design respectively.<a href="#fn81" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref81"><sup>81</sup></a> Bennett explained in a 2005 interview that much of the lighting was done using a series of <a href="Light-emitting_diode" title="wikilink">LED lights</a> arranged in &quot;stalactites or stalagmites [formations] to tie in to the album artwork&quot;. <a href="DLP" class="uri" title="wikilink">DLP</a> projectors were also used to project images onto a gauze screen in front of the stage.</p>
<p><img src="Nine_Inch_Nails_Moline_08.jpg" title="fig:A Nine Inch Nails performance during the Live: With Teeth tour featuring the &quot;teeth&quot; lighting fixtures" alt="A Nine Inch Nails performance during the Live: With Teeth tour featuring the &quot;teeth&quot; lighting fixtures" /> Using the gauze projection-screen, Phillips, Reznor, and Sheridan devised a &quot;gag&quot; where they projected &quot;a sheet of glass shattering onto a downstage kabuki scrim that would drop as the glass shatters fell. ... We settled on Trent swinging his guitar at the gauze [and] shattering it, but with all the pieces falling up as the [screen] flew out&quot;.<a href="#fn82" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref82"><sup>82</sup></a> This technique can be seen in the tour documentary <em>Beside You in Time</em>. In contrast to the lighting of previous tours, Performance 2007 featured minimal lighting that was designed to shadow Reznor and the band.<a href="#fn83" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref83"><sup>83</sup></a></p>
<p>The visual elements of the live shows has been subject to much commentary. <em><a href="The_Boston_Globe" title="wikilink">The Boston Globe</a></em> described the Fragility tour as &quot;one of the most outstanding light shows in memory&quot;.<a href="#fn84" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref84"><sup>84</sup></a> A reviewer from the <em><a href="Contra_Costa_Times" title="wikilink">Contra Costa Times</a></em> described a Live: With Teeth performance as being &quot;heightened by just the right amount of dark purple or blue spotlights, with up-lighting from the stage front, giving the band a horror-flick feel&quot;.<a href="#fn85" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref85"><sup>85</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="live-releases">Live releases</h2>
<p>Nine Inch Nails has released one album and three videos featuring the live band. <em><a href="Closure_(video)" title="wikilink">Closure</a></em>, a double VHS set released in 1997, features live performances from the Self-Destruct Tour, including a performance of &quot;<a href="Hurt_(Nine_Inch_Nails_song)" title="wikilink">Hurt</a>&quot; with David Bowie during the Dissonance Tour.<a href="#fn86" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref86"><sup>86</sup></a> The video has been out of print since its initial release, and all attempts to re-release the video on DVD have failed. A deluxe two-disc DVD version of <em>Closure</em> was delivered to <a href="Interscope_Records" title="wikilink">Interscope Records</a> in 2004 and indefinitely delayed from being released.<a href="#fn87" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref87"><sup>87</sup></a> However, both discs appeared on <a href="BitTorrent_(protocol)" title="wikilink">BitTorrent</a> networks in December 2006.<a href="#fn88" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref88"><sup>88</sup></a> <em><a href="And_All_That_Could_Have_Been" title="wikilink">And All That Could Have Been</a></em>, which features performances from the Fragility 2.0 tour, was released in 2002 as a live CD and double DVD.

The DVD also features rehearsal footage, music videos, and still photographs from the tour.</p>
<h2 id="live-band-members">Live band members</h2>

<p>The configuration of the band has evolved since first touring in 1988. Early incarnations of the band had three people playing <a href="guitar" title="wikilink">guitars</a>, <a href="drum_kit" title="wikilink">drums</a>, <a href="Musical_keyboard" title="wikilink">keyboards</a>, and <a href="Sampler_(musical_instrument)" title="wikilink">samplers</a>. Later incarnations replaced the keyboards and samplers with an additional guitarist, and incarnations after that added a multi-instrumentalist whose main role was as a <a href="bass_guitar" title="wikilink">bassist</a> but also played <a href="electric_guitar" title="wikilink">guitars</a> and <a href="Musical_keyboard" title="wikilink">keyboards</a> on a number of songs. Finally, the live component of Nine Inch Nails has settled as a five-piece band since the <em>Self Destruct</em> tour from 1994. On the Performance 2007 tour, some songs from the <em><a href="Year_Zero_(album)" title="wikilink">Year Zero</a></em> album were performed as a 3 piece band, featuring Reznor, keyboard player Alessandro Cortini and guitarist Aaron North, using a combination of live guitars and triggered loops.<a href="#fn90" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref90"><sup>90</sup></a> In September 2007, Reznor expressed his interest in moving away from the &quot;rock band configuration&quot; to explore &quot;other ways [to] present the material in concert&quot;,<a href="#fn91" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref91"><sup>91</sup></a> though once again the 2008 incarnation consisted of five positions, but adding a variety of instruments not normally used in Nine Inch Nails such as <a href="double_bass" title="wikilink">double bass</a>, various <a href="Percussion" title="wikilink">percussion instruments</a>, <a href="steel_guitar" title="wikilink">steel guitar</a>, <a href="vibraphone" class="uri" title="wikilink">vibraphone</a> and other acoustic instruments as well as sampled sounds triggered from a variety of electronic instruments. No replacement was hired for keyboard player Alessandro Cortini after he left the band in late 2008, and the 2009 live band is a four-piece, with the role of keyboard player being shared between all members.</p>
<p>Describing the selection process, early contributor <a href="Chris_Vrenna" title="wikilink">Chris Vrenna</a> told <em><a href="Gannett_News" title="wikilink">Gannett News</a></em> &quot;coming from the same emotional background, I feel, is more important than how well you can play your instrument. That's one reason that makes our shows more intense when we're up there ... We found people that understood that. It makes us stronger&quot;.<a href="#fn92" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref92"><sup>92</sup></a> Reznor described his selection of the earliest incarnations of the live band by saying &quot;I'm not in the position to offer somebody a thousand dollars a week to rehearse ... So I took some young guys who were malleable, who would basically do what I want them to do but expand on it. The only context I've worked with them in so far is, 'Here are the songs, here are your parts, learn them.' &quot;<a href="#fn93" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref93"><sup>93</sup></a></p>
<p>Between major tours, live band members have on occasion contributed instrumental performances to official Nine Inch Nails releases, though creative control and direction has always been the responsibility of Reznor. Live-band members who have contributed to major Nine Inch Nails studio releases are denoted by a &quot;#&quot; below. Most members provide backing vocals during live performances.</p>
