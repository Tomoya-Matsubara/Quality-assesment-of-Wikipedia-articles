<p><strong>Vitalian</strong> (, ) was an East Roman (<a href="Byzantine" class="uri" title="wikilink">Byzantine</a>) general. Rebelling in 513 against Emperor <a href="Anastasius_I_(emperor)" title="wikilink">Anastasius I</a>, he won over large parts of the army and people of <a href="Thrace" class="uri" title="wikilink">Thrace</a>. Successive rapprochements with Anastasius failed, and the revolt continued until it was finally defeated in 515. Vitalian then went into hiding until Anastasius' death. Being a staunch <a href="Chalcedonian" class="uri" title="wikilink">Chalcedonian</a>, he was pardoned by the new emperor <a href="Justin_I" title="wikilink">Justin I</a> and was engaged in the negotiations with the <a href="Papacy" title="wikilink">Pope</a> to end the <a href="Acacian_Schism" title="wikilink">Acacian Schism</a>. He was named <a href="Roman_consul" title="wikilink">consul</a> for the year 520, shortly before he was murdered, probably on the orders of the emperor's nephew, <a href="Justinian" class="uri" title="wikilink">Justinian</a>.</p>
<h2 id="origins-and-family">Origins and family</h2>
<p>He was born in Zalbada in <a href="Lower_Moesia" title="wikilink">Lower Moesia</a> (usually identified with modern Abrit in northeastern <a href="Bulgaria" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bulgaria</a>).<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> He is called a &quot;<a href="Goths" title="wikilink">Goth</a>&quot; or a &quot;<a href="Scythians" title="wikilink">Scythian</a>&quot; (i.e. a <a href="Huns" title="wikilink">Hun</a>) in the sources. His mother, however, was a sister of <a href="Macedonius_II" title="wikilink">Macedonius II</a>, <a href="Patriarch_of_Constantinople" title="wikilink">Patriarch of Constantinople</a> in 496&lt;U+2013&gt;511, pointing to a mixed marriage and a barbarian origin for his father Patriciolus.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a><a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> Vitalian himself was the father of the generals <a href="Bouzes" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bouzes</a>, <a href="Coutzes" class="uri" title="wikilink">Coutzes</a> and <a href="Venilus" class="uri" title="wikilink">Venilus</a>, and uncle of <a href="John_(nephew_of_Vitalian)" title="wikilink">John</a>, another distinguished general.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> According to the chroniclers' descriptions, Vitalian was short of stature and stammered, but his personal bravery and military skills were widely acknowledged.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a><a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="revolt-against-anastasius">Revolt against Anastasius</h2>
<p><img src="Semissis-Anastasius_I-sb0007.jpg" title="fig:Gold semissis of Emperor Anastasius I." alt="Gold semissis of Emperor Anastasius I." width="250" /> The first mention of Vitalian is for the year 503, when he accompanied his father in the <a href="Anastasian_War" title="wikilink">war against the Persians</a>.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> By 513, he had risen to the rank of <em><a href="comes" class="uri" title="wikilink">comes</a></em> in <a href="Thrace" class="uri" title="wikilink">Thrace</a>, possibly <em>comes foederatorum</em>,&quot;count of the <em><a href="foederati" class="uri" title="wikilink">foederati</a></em>&quot;, barbarian soldiers serving in the <a href="East_Roman_army" title="wikilink">East Roman army</a>.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p>From this post, he rebelled against Emperor <a href="Anastasius_I_(emperor)" title="wikilink">Anastasius I</a> (r. 491&lt;U+2013&gt;518), taking advantage of widespread resentment over the emperor's military, religious and social policies.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> In 511, Anastasius had changed the form of the <em><a href="Trisagion" class="uri" title="wikilink">Trisagion</a></em> and officially adopted the <a href="Miaphysite" class="uri" title="wikilink">Miaphysite</a> dogma, angering the Empire's <a href="Chalcedonian" class="uri" title="wikilink">Chalcedonian</a> population, already alienated by his strict financial policies.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> Furthermore, Anastasius had refused to supply the <em>annonae</em> (&quot;rations, provisions&quot;) due to the <em>foederati</em>, allowing Vitalian to quickly gain the allegiance of the regular troops stationed in the provinces of Thrace, <a href="Moesia_II" title="wikilink">Moesia II</a> and <a href="Scythia_Minor" title="wikilink">Scythia Minor</a> from the unpopular <em><a href="magister_militum" title="wikilink">magister militum</a> per <a href="Diocese_of_Thrace" title="wikilink">Thracias</a></em>, Hypatius. Hypatius' subordinate commanders were either killed or joined the rebellion.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> At the same time, posing as a champion of Chalcedonian orthodoxy, Vitalian was able to gain the support of the local people, who flocked to join his force. According to the contemporary chroniclers, he quickly assembled an army of 50&lt;U+2013&gt;60,000 men, &quot;both soldiers and peasants&quot;, and marched onto <a href="Constantinople" class="uri" title="wikilink">Constantinople</a>, possibly hoping that the mostly Chalcedonian inhabitants would join him.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a><a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a><a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> Indeed it appears that Vitalian's revolt was primarily motivated by religious reasons, something suggested by his repeatedly demonstrated willingness to reach an accommodation with Anastasius.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> To counter Vitalian's propaganda, Anastasius ordered bronze crosses to be set up on the <a href="Walls_of_Constantinople" title="wikilink">city walls</a> inscribed with his own version of events. The emperor also reduced taxes in the provinces of <a href="Bithynia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bithynia</a> and <a href="Asia_(Roman_province)" title="wikilink">Asia</a> to prevent them from joining the rebellion.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
<p>When Vitalian's forces reached the capital, they encamped at the suburb of <a href="Hebdomon" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hebdomon</a> and blockaded the landward side of the city. Anastasius opted for negotiations, and sent out Vitalian's former patron, the former <a href="Roman_consul" title="wikilink">consul</a> and <em>magister militum praesentalis</em> <a href="Patricius_(consul_500)" title="wikilink">Flavius Patricius</a>, as ambassador.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a><a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> To him, Vitalian declared his aims: the restoration of Chalcedonian orthodoxy and the settling of the Thracian army's grievances. Patricius then invited him and his officers for negotiations in the city itself. Vitalian refused for himself, but allowed his senior officers to go on the next day.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a><a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> The officers were well treated by Anastasius, who gave them gifts and promised that their soldiers' grievances would be settled. He also pledged to submit the religious dispute for resolution to the <a href="Patriarch_of_Rome" title="wikilink">Patriarch of Rome</a>. Upon their return to the rebel camp, these officers unanimously pressured Vitalian to accept this settlement. Faced with no alternative, only eight days after his arrival before the capital, Vitalian retreated and returned with his men to Lower Moesia.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a><a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a></p>
<p><img src="Dioecesis_Thraciae_400_AD.png" title="fig:Map of Thrace, the theater of operations during Vitalian&#39;s rebellion." alt="Map of Thrace, the theater of operations during Vitalian&#39;s rebellion." width="250" /> Anastasius then appointed as <em>magister militum per Thracias</em> an officer called Cyril, who proceeded to attack Vitalian's forces. After a few inconclusive skirmishes, Vitalian managed to bribe his entry into <a href="Odessus" class="uri" title="wikilink">Odessus</a>, Cyril's base, and killed him.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> At this point Anastasius had Vitalian declared as a &quot;public enemy&quot; and sent out a new huge army &lt;U+2013&gt; reportedly 80,000 men &lt;U+2013&gt; under his nephew <a href="Hypatius" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hypatius</a>, with a Hun called Alathar as the new <em>magister militum</em> of Thrace. After winning a minor initial victory, the imperial army was eventually pushed back towards Odessus (autumn 513). At Acris, on the <a href="Black_Sea" title="wikilink">Black Sea</a> coast, Vitalian's men attacked their fortified <a href="laager" class="uri" title="wikilink">laager</a> in darkness and dealt them a crushing defeat: the larger part of the imperial army was killed, and both imperial commanders were taken prisoner and held for ransom.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a><a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a></p>
<p>The victory consolidated Vitalian's position. With the spoils, he was able to lavishly reward his followers, and at the news of the imperial army's annihilation, the remaining cities and forts in Lower Moesia and Scythia surrendered to him. Soon after, he had another stroke of luck: at <a href="Sozopol" title="wikilink">Sozopolis</a> his men captured an embassy sent by Anastasius to ransom his nephew, including the ransom money of 1,100 pounds of gold. Hypatius however, whom Vitalian hated because he had once insulted his wife, was not released until a year later.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a><a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> In 514, Vitalian marched again towards Constantinople, this time gathering, in addition to his army, a fleet of 200 vessels from the Black Sea ports, which sailed down the <a href="Bosporus" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bosporus</a> menacing the city from the sea as well. Anastasius was further disquieted by riots in the city, which left many casualties, and resolved to deal again with Vitalian.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a><a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> Vitalian accepted, on the conditions of his nomination to the post of <em>magister militum per Thracias</em>, the receipt of ransom money and gifts worth in total 5,000 pounds of gold for the release of Hypatius. Anastasius also conceded the restoration of the unaltered <em>Trisagion</em>, the restoration of the deposed Chalcedonian bishops and the convocation of a general church council at on 1 July 515 were further agreed on.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a><a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a><a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a></p>
<p>In the event, the council never materialized, since <a href="Pope_Hormisdas" title="wikilink">Pope Hormisdas</a> and Anastasius continued to be at loggerheads over the <a href="Acacian_Schism" title="wikilink">Acacian Schism</a>, and neither were the bishops returned to their sees. Seeing Anastasius failing to honour his promises, in late 515 Vitalian mobilized his army and marched again towards Constantinople.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> Vitalian's army captured the suburb of Sycae (modern <a href="Galata" class="uri" title="wikilink">Galata</a>) across the <a href="Golden_Horn" title="wikilink">Golden Horn</a> from the city and encamped there. The two <em>magistri militum praesentalis</em>, Patricius and John, were unwilling to engage their old friend Vitalian, thus Anastasius entrusted command of his forces to the former <a href="praetorian_prefect_of_the_East" title="wikilink">praetorian prefect of the East</a>, <a href="Marinus_(praetorian_prefect)" title="wikilink">Marinus</a>, a trusted and influential aide.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> Despite his lack of military experience, Marinus defeated the rebel fleet in a battle at the entrance of the Golden Horn; according to some reports, this was achieved through the use of a <a href="sulfur" class="uri" title="wikilink">sulfur</a>-based chemical substance, similar to the later <a href="Greek_fire" title="wikilink">Greek fire</a>. Marinus then landed with his men on the shore of Sycae and defeated the rebels he found there. Disheartened by the losses suffered, Vitalian and his army fled north under cover of night.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a><a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="later-life">Later life</h2>
<p>Once back in northern Thrace, Vitalian went into hiding, while many of his erstwhile aides were captured and executed. For the next three years, nothing is known of him, although a short remark by a chronicler seems to indicate that he resurfaced and led another armed rebellion during the last months of Anastasius' life.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> When Anastasius died in July 518, he was succeeded by <a href="Justin_I" title="wikilink">Justin I</a> (r. 518&lt;U+2013&gt;527), the <em><a href="comes_excubitorum" title="wikilink">comes excubitorum</a></em>. The new emperor quickly moved to strengthen his rule, dismissing a number of potential rivals or enemies. At the same time, he called upon Vitalian to come to Constantinople.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a></p>
<p>Upon his arrival, Vitalian was made <em>magister militum in praesenti</em>, made honorary consul and soon after raised to the rank of <em><a href="patrikios" title="wikilink">patricius</a></em>.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> As a well-known champion of Chalcedonian orthodoxy, Vitalian was to play a role in the new regime's affirmation of the Chalcedonian doctrines and reconciliation with Rome. Indeed he played an active role in the negotiations with the Pope, and in 519, he was one of the prominent men who escorted a papal delegation into the capital.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a><a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a><a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a></p>
<p>Finally, Vitalian was accorded the highest honor a Roman citizen could be awarded: he was named consul for 520, along with Fl. Rusticius. Nevertheless, the old rebel continued to pose a potential challenge to Justin, and more importantly, to his nephew and heir-apparent, <a href="Justinian" class="uri" title="wikilink">Justinian</a>. Thus, in July 520, he was murdered inside the <a href="Great_Palace_of_Constantinople" title="wikilink">Great Palace</a> along with two close aides. According to <a href="John_of_Nikiou" title="wikilink">John of Nikiou</a>, he was plotting against Justin; most chroniclers however put the responsibility for the crime on Justinian's desire to rid himself of a potential rival for his uncle's succession.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a><a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a><a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a></p>
