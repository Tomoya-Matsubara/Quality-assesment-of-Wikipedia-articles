<p>Since preservation, the railway has operated as a <a href="tourist_attraction" title="wikilink">tourist attraction</a>, significantly expanding its rolling stock through acquisition and an engineering programme to build new locomotives and carriages. In 1976 an extension was opened along the former mineral line from Abergynolwyn to the new station at Nant Gwernol. In 2001 the preservation society celebrated its 50th anniversary, and in 2005 a major rebuilding and extension of <a href="Tywyn_Wharf_railway_station" title="wikilink">Tywyn Wharf station</a> took place, including a much expanded facility for the <a href="Narrow_Gauge_Railway_Museum" title="wikilink">Narrow Gauge Railway Museum</a>.</p>

<h3 id="origins-and-construction-up-to-1866">Origins and construction: up to 1866</h3>
<p><a href="Slate_industry_in_Wales" title="wikilink">Slate quarrying</a> began in the hills above Tywyn in the 1830s, but although many small quarries and test levels were established, only one major quarry was developed in the region, at <a href="Bryn_Eglwys" title="wikilink">Bryn Eglwys</a>,  north east of the town. Underground working began in the early 1840s,<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> and by 1847 the quarry was being worked by local landowner John Pughe. The finished slates were sent by <a href="packhorse" class="uri" title="wikilink">packhorse</a> to the wharf at <a href="Pennal" class="uri" title="wikilink">Pennal</a>, transferred to boats for a river trip to <a href="Aberdyfi" class="uri" title="wikilink">Aberdyfi</a> (also known as Aberdovey), and then finally loaded into sea-going vessels, a complex and expensive transportation arrangement which limited the quarry's output.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> In 1861 the outbreak of the <a href="American_Civil_War" title="wikilink">American Civil War</a> cut off supplies of <a href="cotton" class="uri" title="wikilink">cotton</a> to the <a href="Cotton_mill" title="wikilink">mills</a> of the north west of England and as a result a number of prosperous mill owners looked for new business opportunities to diversify their interests. One such owner was <a href="William_McConnel" title="wikilink">William McConnel</a> of <a href="Lancashire" class="uri" title="wikilink">Lancashire</a> who, in 1859, had purchased a house near <a href="Dolgellau" class="uri" title="wikilink">Dolgellau</a>, north of Tywyn. In January 1864, McConnel formed the Aberdovey Slate Company, which leased the land including Bryn Eglwys from the landowner, Lewis Morris of <a href="Machynlleth" class="uri" title="wikilink">Machynlleth</a>.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<p><img src="Tivedshambo_2008-03-18_Bryn_Eglwys_quarry.jpg" title="fig:The remains of Bryn Eglwys quarry in 2008" alt="The remains of Bryn Eglwys quarry in 2008" /> McConnel set about improving Bryn Eglwys to increase its output and in 1865 his company earmarked money for the construction of a narrow gauge railway connecting the quarry with the port of Aberdyfi. The standard gauge <a href="Aberystwyth_and_Welsh_Coast_Railway" title="wikilink">Aberystwyth and Welsh Coast Railway</a> was expanding rapidly from its base at Machynlleth, however, and in 1863 had reached Tywyn, so McConnel decided to build his line from the quarry to Tywyn, as the nearest point where slate could be transferred to the standard gauge railway. This was despite the fact that the line was initially isolated from the rest of the system because of difficulties in bridging the estuary of the <a href="Afon_Dyfi" title="wikilink">Afon Dyfi</a> to the south.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> An <a href="Act_of_Parliament#United_Kingdom" title="wikilink">Act of Parliament</a> (28 and 29 <a href="Victoria_of_the_United_Kingdom" title="wikilink">Vict</a>, cap cccxv) allowing the company to operate passenger trains as a public railway was given <a href="Royal_Assent" title="wikilink">Royal Assent</a> on <a href="5_July" title="wikilink">5 July</a> <a href="1865" class="uri" title="wikilink">1865</a>,<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a><a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> and the company appointed <a href="The_Spooners_of_Porthmadog" title="wikilink">James Swinton Spooner</a> as engineer for the construction. He laid out plans for a relatively straight line climbing steadily from Tywyn to the quarry and work quickly got underway. By September 1866 construction had advanced to the point where the <a href="Board_of_Trade" title="wikilink">Board of Trade</a> inspector Captain Henry Tyler could make an initial inspection and report.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
<p>Tyler's report led to an unusual alteration, as it was discovered that the <a href="loading_gauge" title="wikilink">loading gauge</a> of the line was too small. The internal width of the overbridges was only , but the railway's <a href="Talyllyn_Railway_rolling_stock#Carriages" title="wikilink">passenger carriages</a> were  wide, leaving less than  clearance on either side, less than the minimum required clearance of . To alleviate this problem, McConnel proposed that the doors on one side of each carriage be permanently barred and the track slewed off-centre beneath the bridges to allow adequate clearance at least on the side with doors, which would allow passengers to get out of the carriages if the train stopped underneath a bridge. Tyler agreed to this arrangement, and to this day all carriages on the Talyllyn have doors on one side only, an unusual feature for a public railway which is shared (albeit for different reasons) with the neighbouring Corris Railway.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> Tyler also required that improvements be made to the railway's first two steam locomotives, as locomotive No. 1 suffered from excessive &quot;vertical motion&quot; and No. 2 was said to suffer from &quot;horizontal oscillation&quot;. No. 1 was returned to its manufacturer where a set of <a href="trailing_wheel" title="wikilink">trailing wheels</a> was added to reduce the rear overhang, and the <a href="Suspension_%28vehicle%29#Springs_and_dampers" title="wikilink">springs</a> on No. 2 were adjusted and the <a href="crank_pin" title="wikilink">crank pins</a> shortened to reduce its oscillation.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
<p>Tyler did not approve the opening until his listed improvements were completed. During the first half of 1866, the various changes required were made and construction of the line was finished, and in October 1866 the railway began an unofficial passenger service, despite not being authorised by the Board of Trade.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> Passengers were carried &quot;at their own risk&quot; and possibly free of charge until the line was officially sanctioned. In November of that year, Tyler returned to Tywyn and re-inspected the railway following which, subject to some further minor improvements, he approved its formal opening for passenger service. The first public passenger timetable was issued in December 1866,<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> and the first purpose-built, steam-worked, narrow gauge public railway in Britain opened for service.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>

<p>At the time of the line's opening, stations were provided at Pendre and Abergynolwyn. In 1867, the halt at  opened, followed by  and  in 1873. Some time shortly after the opening of the railway a branch to Abergynolwyn village was provided. A steep <a href="cable_railway" title="wikilink">incline</a> dropped from the mineral line east of Abergynolwyn station to the village below, where a series of tram lines radiated. Coal, building materials and general goods were delivered down the incline and the contents of the village <a href="cesspit" title="wikilink">cesspits</a> were hauled back up for disposal along the lineside.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a></p>
<p>The railway used <a href="steam_locomotive" title="wikilink">steam locomotives</a> from the start, unlike its neighbour the horse-drawn Corris Railway. The original two engines, although of entirely different design, were both purchased from <a href="Fletcher,_Jennings_&amp;_Co." title="wikilink">Fletcher, Jennings &amp; Co.</a> of <a href="Whitehaven" class="uri" title="wikilink">Whitehaven</a> in <a href="Cumbria" class="uri" title="wikilink">Cumbria</a>,<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> and both are still in service, 140 years on, although so many of their parts have been replaced down the years that much of their present-day component metal is not original. The Talyllyn's rare gauge is thought to have been adopted to match that of the Corris Railway,<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> and the line's two original steam locomotives were among the earliest engines built for such a narrow gauge. No. 1 <em><a href="Talyllyn_(locomotive)" title="wikilink">Talyllyn</a></em> is an <a href="0-4-2" title="wikilink">0-4-2ST</a> (<a href="Tank_locomotive#Saddle_tank" title="wikilink">saddle tank</a>) and No. 2 <em><a href="Dolgoch_(locomotive)" title="wikilink">Dolgoch</a></em> is an <a href="0-4-0" title="wikilink">0-4-0WT</a> (<a href="well_tank" title="wikilink">well tank</a>). The line carried slate from the quarry to the wharf at Tywyn and general goods along its length. Public passenger trains initially ran between Abergynolwyn, Dolgoch and Pendre stations only; quarrymen were carried on unofficial trains that continued on from Abergynolwyn to the foot of the Alltwyllt incline in Nant Gwernol gorge.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a></p>
<p>The line operated successfully during its early years, serving the quarry and the local district. By 1880, Bryn Eglwys employed 300 workers and was producing  of finished slate per year, all shipped via the railway.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> Passenger traffic was substantial, rising from 11,500 passengers carried in 1867 to over 23,000 (roughly equivalent to 40,000 passenger journeys) in 1877.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a></p>

This used <a href="charabanc" title="wikilink">charabancs</a> to link the Talyllyn and Corris railways via Tal-y-llyn Lake and Cadair Idris, returning on <a href="Cambrian_Railways" title="wikilink">Cambrian Railways</a> trains.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> The last two decades of the 19th century saw a decline in the demand for slate and many smaller quarries fell on hard times, including Bryn Eglwys, where by 1890 production had halved to  a year.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> In 1896, production at the <a href="Penrhyn_Quarry" title="wikilink">Penrhyn Quarry</a> in north Wales, one of the largest producers of slate, was stopped due to labour disputes, resulting in a temporary increase in demand at other quarries. McConnel expanded production at Bryn Eglwys to take advantage of the sudden demand, but only with the aim of maximising profits during the remainder of his lease, which was to expire in 1910. He built new trial levels without proper provision for the removal of <a href="overburden" class="uri" title="wikilink">overburden</a> and pushed the limits of safe working in the existing chambers. As McConnel's lease drew to its close, there was no prospect of a further lessee coming forward and work began on dismantling the quarry's equipment.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a></p>

<p>The Bryn Eglwys quarry was the primary employer in the Abergynolwyn district, so its closure caused significant distress. Local landowner <a href="Henry_Haydn_Jones" title="wikilink">Henry Haydn Jones</a> purchased the company in 1910, the same year he was elected the <a href="Liberal_Party_(UK)" title="wikilink">Liberal</a> <a href="Member_of_Parliament#United_Kingdom" title="wikilink">MP</a> for <a href="Merionethshire" title="wikilink">Merioneth</a>, and reopened the quarry in January 1911.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> He did not have any capital to invest in the quarry, however, and the first workings reopened were on the &quot;Broad Vein&quot;, which yielded relatively hard slate that was less popular and harder to sell. The lack of an available market for this output forced the quarry to switch to extracting softer slate from the &quot;Narrow Vein&quot; but, because Haydn Jones could not afford to open new workings into the Narrow Vein, he resorted to the dangerous practice of narrowing the columns that supported the roofs of the underground chambers. This practice had begun under McConnel's ownership and Haydn Jones continued it throughout his ownership of the quarry.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> A brief construction boom after the <a href="First_World_War" title="wikilink">First World War</a> saw production return to around  per year.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a></p>
<p>The 1920s also saw an upsurge in holiday traffic, as Britain recovered from the war and tourism gained in popularity. The Talyllyn saw summer passenger numbers grow significantly and regularly had to supplement its formal passenger stock with slate wagons fitted with planks as seats.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> An unusual tourist service offered by the railway was to hire a slate wagon, which would be left at Abergynolwyn. At the end of the day the tourists would return to Tywyn in the wagon, powered by <a href="Gravity_railway" title="wikilink">gravity</a>. This service was discontinued in the early 1930s.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> The additional income from the tourist trade defrayed some of the costs of operating the railway, but never enough for it to make a profit during Haydn Jones' ownership.</p>
<p>The lease on Bryn Eglwys expired in 1942, but was extended on an annual basis. In 1946 the weakened columns gave way in a significant collapse and the quarry was deemed unsafe and closed immediately. Haydn Jones had promised to continue operating the railway as long as he was alive and so, despite the closure of the quarry, the railway continued to run trains on a shoestring budget. In 1947 the British railway system was nationalised and the Talyllyn was one of the few operating railways not included. The reasons for this are unclear, but it is significant that all official mention of the railway had ceased several decades before and it is likely that the line was simply forgotten by officialdom.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> Between 1947 and 1949 the railway ran a passenger service two days a week. On <a href="2_July" title="wikilink">2 July</a> <a href="1950" class="uri" title="wikilink">1950</a> Haydn Jones died and closure of the railway seemed inevitable, but the line continued to operate for the remainder of the summer season, ending on <a href="6_October" title="wikilink">6 October</a>.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a></p>

In the summer of 1950, <a href="L._T._C._Rolt" title="wikilink">Tom Rolt</a> wrote a letter to the <a href="Birmingham_Post" title="wikilink">Birmingham Post</a> newspaper suggesting that a rescue of the Talyllyn be undertaken.

Around 70 people attended the meeting and Rolt proposed the formation of a committee to look into the acquisition of the railway. With the support of the meeting, the committee met for the first time on <a href="23_October" title="wikilink">23 October</a> and immediately entered into negotiation with Haydn Jones' executors.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a></p>
<p>The transfer of ownership to the committee was legally complex, but both parties agreed that all shares in the railway company would be transferred from Haydn Jones' estate to a new company called Talyllyn Holdings Ltd., whose board consisted of two directors from the executors and two from the committee. The transfer took place on <a href="8_February" title="wikilink">8 February</a> <a href="1951" class="uri" title="wikilink">1951</a>, at which point the newly formed Talyllyn Railway Preservation Society effectively took control of the railway.

<p>In the early years of preservation, the line struggled to operate using the original rolling stock. When the line was taken over in 1950 <em>Dolgoch</em> was the only operating locomotive and it was apparent that it was in need of a major overhaul. To enable operations to continue two further steam locomotives, Nos. 3 and 4, were purchased from the recently closed Corris Railway in 1951 and named <em>Sir Haydn</em> and <em>Edward Thomas</em> respectively. Because both railways were built to the unusual gauge of  it was relatively easy to adapt the Corris locomotives to work on the Talyllyn. No. 3 became the first new locomotive to travel on the railway for over 90 years in 1951, but it frequently <a href="Derailment" title="wikilink">derailed</a>, and on inspection it turned out that the Talyllyn track was laid approximately half an inch (13 mm) wider than the official gauge, a deliberate policy by the old company to accommodate the long <a href="wheelbase" class="uri" title="wikilink">wheelbase</a> of <em>Talyllyn</em>. Both <em>Talyllyn</em> and <em>Dolgoch</em> had unusually wide wheel treads that allowed them to stay on the wide-of-gauge track. This problem was eventually cured by relaying the railway to its correct gauge and altering <em>Talyllyn</em>'s trailing wheels to allow them to swivel horizontally, shortening the locomotive's fixed wheelbase.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> No. 4 was unserviceable when it arrived, but John Alcock,<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a> the chairman of the <a href="Hunslet_Engine_Company" title="wikilink">Hunslet Engine Company</a>, was a member of the Preservation Society and had No. 4 overhauled free of charge at his works.<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a></p>

The publicity from this broadcast drew substantial numbers of visitors to the railway that summer, with more than 57,500 passengers carried, and this increase in revenue in turn enabled the railway to continue to improve its infrastructure and provide tourists with a better experience.<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a> The following year locomotive No. 1 <em>Talyllyn</em> returned to steam after an extensive overhaul.<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a></p>
<p>An important development during this period was the establishment of the <a href="Narrow_Gauge_Railway_Museum" title="wikilink">Narrow Gauge Railway Museum</a> at Tywyn Wharf station. The first exhibit for what was to become the museum was a locomotive donated in 1952 by <a href="Diageo" title="wikilink">Guinness</a> from their recently closed <a href="St._James&#39;s_Gate_Brewery" title="wikilink">St. James's Gate Brewery</a> railway. In 1954 the Preservation Society agreed to start work on a formal museum and exhibits from around the United Kingdom were acquired to form the nucleus of the collection.

<p>The 1960s proved to be a decade of consolidation for the Talyllyn. Pendre works underwent several much-needed expansions, adding additional covered storage for carriages and more workshop room. Modern machine tools, along with proper lighting and a new power supply were added. Substantial improvements to Tywyn Wharf station were also made, along with continued relaying and upgrading of the track to Abergynolwyn.<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a> Passenger numbers continued to climb after the BBC broadcast of 1957; in 1960, 67,000 passenger journeys were made, increasing to 78,500 in 1964.<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a> In response to this growing popularity the railway undertook a programme of new rolling stock construction.</p>
<p>By the early 1960s Tywyn Wharf station was in need of major improvements. Before preservation, the station had contained only a fan of sidings, which meant that there was no way for the locomotive of an arriving train to run round the carriages. As a result, trains were pushed from behind as far as Pendre, where the locomotive could be moved past the carriages to the front of the train. A <a href="passing_loop" title="wikilink">loop</a> was installed at Wharf for the first time in August 1952, to avoid having to propel trains to Pendre,<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a> but in the winter of 1964/65 a major upgrade of the station was carried out. This improved the track layout and extended the original office building to provide covered accommodation for passengers and a shop.<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a></p>
<p>As passenger numbers continued to grow during the late 1960s it became clear that further motive power was needed, especially as the rebuilt No. 1 was not performing well. The Talyllyn's unusual track gauge and restricted loading gauge meant that it was unlikely that a locomotive could be found that could work on the line unaltered,<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a> so in 1969 a  gauge steam locomotive was purchased from the <a href="Bord_na_Mona" title="wikilink">Bord na Mona</a> (Irish Peat Board) with a view to rebuilding it for use on the Talyllyn. This locomotive was unofficially known as <em>Irish Pete</em>, a nod to its original use.<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a> </p>

Planning began in the mid-1960s, but construction did not start until 1968 when the winding house for the Abergynolwyn village incline was demolished.<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a> To bring the line up to passenger standards some of the curves needed to be eased, and this required blasting work, as the line runs on a narrow ledge on the hillside at this point.<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a> The extension and new station at Nant Gwernol were opened on <a href="22_May" title="wikilink">22 May</a> <a href="1976" class="uri" title="wikilink">1976</a> by Wynford Vaughan Thomas who drove in the ceremonial &quot;<a href="golden_spike" title="wikilink">golden spike</a>&quot; to complete the extension.<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a> Despite this official opening ceremony, minor work still remained to bring the extension to the standard required to run regular passenger trains, but regular train services began on <a href="29_May" title="wikilink">29 May</a> <a href="1976" class="uri" title="wikilink">1976</a>.<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a></p>

A new footbridge was built crossing the Nant Gwernol gorge and connecting the station with the existing path on the east side of the river. The bridge and paths were opened on <a href="3_May" title="wikilink">3 May</a> <a href="1980" class="uri" title="wikilink">1980</a> by <a href="Gordon_Parry,_Baron_Parry" title="wikilink">Lord Parry</a>, the chairman of the <a href="Visit_Wales" title="wikilink">Wales Tourist Board</a>.<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a> By the mid-1970s, it had become clear that passenger numbers were no longer increasing.

By 1987, the <a href="boiler" class="uri" title="wikilink">boiler</a> on locomotive No. 6 <em>Douglas</em> was life expired and in need of replacement. Consideration was given to reviving the project to build a new locomotive from the components of <em>Irish Pete</em> instead of purchasing a new boiler for <em>Douglas</em> and in early 1988 work recommenced on the rebuilding of the ex-Bord na Mona locomotive. A new design for a 0-4-2 side tank locomotive was prepared by the railway's Chief Engineer John Bate, which reused the chassis and boiler from the locomotive with a new superstructure and the addition of trailing wheels, and the new locomotive, officially named <em>Tom Rolt</em> after the Preservation Society's first chairman, was put into service on <a href="6_May" title="wikilink">6 May</a> <a href="1991" class="uri" title="wikilink">1991</a>.<a href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a> During this period further expansions of both Tywyn Wharf and Pendre stations were undertaken and Abergynolwyn station, which had been rebuilt as part of the Nant Gwernol extension in the 1970s, was expanded further to provide an additional attraction at the eastern end of the line.<a href="#fn67" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a></p>
<p>One major anomaly remained in the railway's operations: the 1889 <a href="Regulation_of_Railways_Act_1889" title="wikilink">Regulation of Railways Act</a> had required, amongst other measures, that all British passenger trains be fitted with <a href="Brake_%28railway%29#Continuous_brakes" title="wikilink">continuous brakes</a>.

<p>The Preservation Society celebrated its 50th anniversary in 2001, and as part of the year of celebrations a major new project was launched to once more extend and improve facilities at Tywyn Wharf station. For many years the station had been home to semi-permanent buildings housing the Narrow Gauge Railway Museum, but the new plans for the station included the construction of a new two-storey building to house the museum and the extension of the existing station building to house a new cafe and booking office.

When the line carried traffic from the quarry, slates were transferred to the <a href="Cambrian_Railway" title="wikilink">Cambrian Railway</a> on the <a href="transhipment" class="uri" title="wikilink">transhipment</a> sidings.

The cutting ends at a road overbridge after which the line runs through open countryside as it starts to ascend the valley side on a ledge. After approximately a quarter of a mile (400 m) it enters woodlands west of , climbing steadily, then curves to the south east and crosses the Dolgoch gorge on the Dolgoch viaduct, which carries the line  above the Dolgoch ravine.<a href="#fn85" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref85"><sup>85</sup></a> Dolgoch station is immediately east of the viaduct, situated on a left-hand curve at  above sea level, and is the main intermediate station on the line, being popular with tourists visiting the nearby <a href="waterfall" title="wikilink">falls</a>. The railway continues in a north easterly direction, curving through the woods and climbing the valley side. It shortly passes Quarry Siding, where a halt and passing loop are located, as well as a small <a href="shale" class="uri" title="wikilink">shale</a> quarry, the rock from which is mainly used for <a href="Track_ballast" title="wikilink">ballasting</a> on the railway.

The extension was originally sharply curved, as the line turns south east into the steeply sided Nant Gwernol gorge but these curves were eased when conversion for passenger use took place in 1976. The whole section is within woods, now owned by the <a href="Forestry_Commission" title="wikilink">Forestry Commission</a>. Shortly after leaving Abergynolwyn station the line reaches Ty Dwr, where the original locomotive shed stood from 1865 until it was demolished after Pendre works opened in 1867, although the slate water tower continued in use into the 1950s.<a href="#fn87" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref87"><sup>87</sup></a></p>
<p>About half way along the  extension is the site of the Village Incline. From here the line runs into the gorge, high above the river on a narrow ledge, ending at the foot of the first incline leading to the Bryn Eglwys quarry. The original line fanned out into a set of three sidings, used to marshal trains of loaded slate wagons coming down from the quarry and empty wagons waiting to ascend.<a href="#fn88" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref88"><sup>88</sup></a> <a href="Nant_Gwernol_railway_station" title="wikilink">Nant Gwernol station</a>, the eastern terminus of the line, was built on the site of the sidings.</p>

The winding house for the incline stood on the narrow ledge, with the mineral line passing through it. The two-track incline dropped 150 ft (46 m) over a distance of 363 ft (111 m). At its foot, the line crossed the Nant Gwernol on a girder bridge. Immediately after the bridge, short lines branched off to the east from a wagon <a href="Turntable_(railroad)" title="wikilink">turntable</a> to the coal yard and smithy of Pandy Farm and west to a <a href="slate_(writing)" title="wikilink">writing slate</a> factory (later a carpenter's yard). The main branch then split to form a storage loop, with a further wagon turntable and a longer branch serving the houses and school to the north east. The main branch continued north, crossing the main road then passing between the two main terraces in the village before ending in a turntable and a final short line connecting to the Capel Jerusalem chapel.<a href="#fn89" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref89"><sup>89</sup></a> The village incline was lifted during the early years of preservation, to provide much needed rail to replace the existing track.<a href="#fn90" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref90"><sup>90</sup></a> The winding house was demolished in 1968 to allow realignment of the railway to form the extension to Nant Gwernol.<a href="#fn91" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref91"><sup>91</sup></a></p>

The quarry lay about a mile (1.6 km) south-east of Nant Gwernol station and 300 ft (100 m) above it, with a further mineral tramway connecting the quarry with the railway.<a href="#fn92" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref92"><sup>92</sup></a> What is now Nant Gwernol station was the terminus of the Talyllyn Railway proper. Here the line fanned out into a set of sidings where inbound trains were left and outbound slate trains assembled. The sidings were located on a narrow ledge in the side of the Nant Gwernol gorge.</p>
<p>Rising south-east from the end of the sidings was the  long, double track gravity operated, Alltwyllt incline,<a href="#fn93" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref93"><sup>93</sup></a> from the top of which the Galltymoelfre Tramway ran south-east towards the quarry for about . The tramway was laid in light <a href="Rail_profile#History" title="wikilink">bridge rail</a> and worked for its entire existence using horses. The tramway ended at the foot of the Cantrybedd Incline, a  long double track, gravity operated incline.

<h2 id="operation">Operation</h2>

<p>The line has six steam locomotives for passenger trains and four diesel locomotives, which are primarily used to haul works trains. It is unusual for all steam locomotives to be operable at the same time, as at least one is normally scheduled for overhaul.<a href="#fn95" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref95"><sup>95</sup></a> The railway also owns 23 carriages and vans, including all of the original carriages and the brake van built for the railway.</p>

Before preservation, the railway operated a &quot;<a href="Safeworking#One_Engine_in_Steam" title="wikilink">one engine in steam</a>&quot; policy, but with growing passenger numbers it became necessary to install passing loops and a more stringent method of single line control was introduced.<a href="#fn96" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref96"><sup>96</sup></a> The line is worked by <a href="Token_(railway_signalling)" title="wikilink">tokens</a>, which authorise the driver to enter a single line section, and these are interlocked to prevent more than one token being withdrawn for a section at any one time. A loop is at Pendre, which was used from the opening of the railway for shunting purposes, and further loops were installed at Brynglas in 1953 and Quarry Siding in 1963.<a href="#fn97" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref97"><sup>97</sup></a> When the Nant Gwernol extension opened in 1976, Abergynolwyn also became a passing loop.</p>
<p>Each passing loop is controlled by a small <a href="signal_box" title="wikilink">signal box</a>, known as a block-post. These house the lever frames that control the points, the token equipment and telephones. The railway has few signals; instead it has stop boards at each loop, and the <a href="Signalman_(rail)" title="wikilink">blockman</a> allows trains to proceed by use of flags.<a href="#fn98" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref98"><sup>98</sup></a> When the block-post is unstaffed, it is the responsibility of the locomotive crew to change the token before proceeding.<a href="#fn99" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref99"><sup>99</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="in-fiction">In fiction</h2>
<p>The Talyllyn Railway is represented in the <em><a href="Thomas_the_Tank_Engine" title="wikilink">Thomas the Tank Engine</a></em> books as the <a href="Skarloey_Railway" title="wikilink">Skarloey Railway</a>, with most of the fictional locomotives being based on real-life equivalents. The author, <a href="W.V._Awdry" title="wikilink">Rev. W. Awdry</a>, visited the line on a family holiday in the early days of preservation and became involved as a volunteer soon afterwards. Several of the stories in <em><a href="The_Railway_Series" title="wikilink">The Railway Series</a></em> come from real-life experiences at the Talyllyn, and a number of the books contain full-page illustrations of Talyllyn locomotives.<a href="#fn100" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref100"><sup>100</sup></a></p>
<p>The preservation of the Talyllyn Railway by volunteers was the inspiration for the 1953 film <em><a href="The_Titfield_Thunderbolt" title="wikilink">The Titfield Thunderbolt</a></em>,<a href="#fn101" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref101"><sup>101</sup></a> an <a href="Ealing_Studios" title="wikilink">Ealing Studios</a> comedy about a group of villagers attempting to run a service on a disused <a href="branch_line" title="wikilink">branch line</a> after closure. <a href="T._E._B._Clarke" title="wikilink">T. E. B. Clarke</a>, the script writer for the film, had heard about the preservation of the Talyllyn and spent a day on the railway in 1951, and some of the early incidents in preservation were incorporated into the film. In the book <em>Railway Adventure</em> Tom Rolt recalled that he had hoped the film might be produced on the Talyllyn,<a href="#fn102" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref102"><sup>102</sup></a> but in the end it was filmed on the recently closed <a href="Bristol_and_North_Somerset_Railway" title="wikilink">Bristol and North Somerset Railway</a> branch line along the <a href="Cam_Brook,_Somerset" title="wikilink">Cam Brook</a> valley in <a href="Somerset" class="uri" title="wikilink">Somerset</a>.<a href="#fn103" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref103"><sup>103</sup></a></p>
