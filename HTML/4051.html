<h3 id="neolithic-settlements">Neolithic settlements</h3>
<p><img src="Megawal35.png" title="fig:Dates and locations of prehistoric Swiss cultures" alt="Dates and locations of prehistoric Swiss cultures" /> Cortaillod gave its name to the <a href="Cortaillod_culture" title="wikilink">Cortaillod culture</a>, a <a href="neolithic" class="uri" title="wikilink">neolithic</a> culture in Switzerland and surrounding areas. There are four neolithic sites along the lake shore at Cortaillod; La Fabrique or Le Vivier which is now eroding, Les Cotes which was almost completely washed out in 1880, Petit-Cortaillod and La Tuilli&lt;U+00E8&gt;res. At La Tuilli&lt;U+00E8&gt;res several large <a href="flint" class="uri" title="wikilink">flint</a> and stone axes were found. Petit-Cortaillod is the largest and most productive. It is about  and is between  thick. These sites were originally underwater, but were discovered when the water level of Lake Neuch&lt;U+00E2&gt;tel dropped. Because they were no longer flooded, between 1876 and 1879 the sites were looted. Many items were bought by museums or private collectors with limited study and documentation. The first scientific study was done in 1878 by Albert Vouga and Fritz Borel at the Petit-Cortaillod site. Their first excavations went down to a chalk layer at a depth of . The list of objects excavated on this occasion is impressive: thousands of flints and awls made &lt;U+200B&gt;&lt;U+200B&gt;of bone, 3,000 ax shafts, and about 2,000 smaller axes and hatchets.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>

Friedrich Schwab and Edouard Desor's archeological excavations found many bronze items. One of the most striking items, a wheel spoke made of bronze and oak wood with a diameter of , was discovered in 1862. Other finds included axes, sickles and needles as well as bronze swords and hundreds of vases. There were also a number of crescent-shaped earthenware objects called d'argile croissants. The d'argile croissants are about  long and may represent constellations. After the first <a href="Jura_water_correction" title="wikilink">Jura water correction</a> dropped the water levels by , the sites began to erode. In 1925 Paul Vouga took soundings to study the <a href="stratigraphy" class="uri" title="wikilink">stratigraphy</a> of the site. At his request, the Army made a series of aerial photographs &lt;U+200B&gt;&lt;U+200B&gt;in 1927, which provided a number of fundamental insights into these villages from the Bronze Age.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p><img src="Lat&lt;U+00E9&gt;nium-maquette-village-laustre.jpg" title="fig:Model of the Cortaillod-Est settlement" alt="Model of the Cortaillod-Est settlement" /> The settlement at Cortaillod-Est was explored by divers in 1981-84. They were able to use <a href="dendrochronology" class="uri" title="wikilink">dendrochronology</a> to determine that the settlement was inhabited between 1010 and 955 BC. At its largest, it consisted of eight parallel rows of houses (total 22 houses), which were separated by straight-line paths. The houses were built on dry stone foundations. It was enclosed by a fence that was built in a semicircular arc and covered an area of about . Cortaillod-Plage, the extension of the village to the north-east was inhabited between 968-954 BC. The settlement was built on an area of &lt;U+200B&gt;&lt;U+200B&gt;approximately . The village of Cortaillod Les Esserts was surrounded by a  long, three layer <a href="palisade" class="uri" title="wikilink">palisade</a>. Cortaillod Les Esserts was inhabited between 870-850 BC and had an area of between . It had a road running through the center of the village with houses on both sides.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>La Fabrique or Le Vivier, the other Bronze Age site, is located above the Neolithic site. During the construction of the <a href="A1_motorway_(Switzerland)" title="wikilink">A1 motorway</a> in 1993-98, the site was explored. In 1993 in Murgiers, two cremation graves from the Late Bronze Age (<a href="Hallstatt_culture" title="wikilink">Hallstatt A 1</a>) were discovered. One of the graves contained both offerings and a ceramic jar containing the cremated bones of a person. The other grave had fine pottery including vases with a decorative edge. The excavations at Petit Ruz in 1995-97 discovered many traces of a Bronze Age settlement, including some 300 post holes, numerous pits and hearths, and a  gravel road. An excavation at Champ Basset in 1996 discovered a circular pit  in diameter. This pit contained  of very well-preserved pottery from the Hallstatt period. Other sites in Cortaillod include postholes, burials, hearths and pottery at Tolay, in Champ Barrett, Rochettes in Chan&lt;U+00E9&gt;laz and at Tilles as well as a number of tombs from the <a href="La_T&lt;U+00E8&gt;ne_culture" title="wikilink">La T&lt;U+00E8&gt;ne period</a> at Courbes Rayes.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="medieval-town">Medieval town</h3>
<p>Part of Cortaillod was given in 1311 to Peter St&lt;U+00E4&gt;ffis, Lord of Gorgier as a result of an exchange that he made with Count Rudolph IV of Neuch&lt;U+00E2&gt;tel. During the <a href="Middle_Ages" title="wikilink">Middle Ages</a> the ownership of the village was quite complicated. Members of the <a href="parish" title="wikilink">parishes</a> of Pontareuse and Bevaix both lived there. The <a href="B&lt;U+00FC&gt;rgergemeinde" title="wikilink">municipal community</a> consisted of citizens of <a href="Boudry" class="uri" title="wikilink">Boudry</a> (who were under the Lord of Gorgier) and also subjects of the priory of Bevaix. Each <a href="feudal" class="uri" title="wikilink">feudal</a> lord had a <a href="bailiff" class="uri" title="wikilink">bailiff</a> or magistrate to represent him in the village. There was only a <a href="civil_court" title="wikilink">civil court</a> in Cortaillod, criminal cases were heard by one of the feudal lords. Starting in 1379 the inhabitants of the municipal community, owned their own pastures. In 1499 Philip of Hochberg, Count of Neuchatel, allowed them the right to farm the sandy shoreline. Between 1541 and 1545, the Lord of Colombier bought Cortaillod from the two preceding feudal lords. However, Cortaillod was sold to the Count of Neuch&lt;U+00E2&gt;tel in 1564, and became part of the County of Neuch&lt;U+00E2&gt;tel. The inhabitants then called themselves citizens of Boudry, but they did not enjoy all the citizenship rights.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>

The disputes were over the division of <a href="the_commons" title="wikilink">the common pastures and forests</a> and a special tax (Eminem de la porte), which had to be paid by the residents of Cortaillod but only benefited Boudry. This tax was abolished in 1813.</p>
<p>In 1503, the <a href="Bishop_of_Lausanne" title="wikilink">Bishop of Lausanne</a> allowed the villagers to establish a chapel. The Chapel of St. Nicholas was consecrated two years later. Until 1524 the pastor of Pontareuse and Bevaix protested against the permanent presence of a priest in Cortaillod. The village finally became an important parish when it accepted the <a href="Protestant_Reformation" title="wikilink">Protestant Reformation</a>. In 1537 it became an independent parish.</p>
<p>The first weaving mill in Cortaillod opened in 1731 and was open for about 30 years. In 1752 the famous Fabrique-Neuve de Cortaillod mill opened near the other mills. It remained in operation until 1854. The building was then acquired in 1879 by C&lt;U+00E2&gt;bles Cortaillod. The company remained one of the most important companies in the municipality, even after it was acquired in 2001 by Nexans Schweiz AG. Between 1855 and 1885 there was a watch factory in Cortaillod. The European manufacturing and technology center of <a href="Silicon_Graphics" title="wikilink">Silicon Graphics</a> settled in Cortaillod in 1992. However, this plant, which employed about 300 people, closed in 2001. <a href="Viticulture" class="uri" title="wikilink">Viticulture</a> remains a significant part of the local economy, and the wines of Cortaillod enjoy a good reputation.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
