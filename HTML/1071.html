<h2 id="plot-summary">Plot summary</h2>

<p><em>Eragon</em> begins with a 15 year old boy, Eragon, finding a mysterious blue stone in The Spine, an untamed range of mountains near the small village he calls home, Carvahall. Eragon takes place in a land called Alaga&lt;U+00EB&gt;sia, which is ruled by the evil, twisted king, <a href="Galbatorix" class="uri" title="wikilink">Galbatorix</a>, who was once one of the dragon riders until he lost his dragon and was corrupted by madness after the dragon riders denied him another dragon. After being unable to sell or trade his find, Eragon soon witnesses a baby dragon hatch from inside the &quot;stone.&quot; Dragons are a species thought to be extinct, with the exception of Galbatorix's dragon. He raises the dragon in secret until two hooded figures, the evil Ra'zac, enter the town looking for his mysterious blue stone. Eragon and <a href="Saphira" class="uri" title="wikilink">Saphira</a>, as he names his dragon, manage to escape danger by hiding in the forest, but Eragon's Uncle Garrow is not as fortunate. The Ra'zac kill his uncle and destroy the house. Eragon, remembering tales of the past, takes it upon himself to become one of the <a href="Alaga&lt;U+00EB&gt;sia#Dragon_riders" title="wikilink">Dragon riders</a>, the ancient warriors who were slaughtered by the crazed <a href="Galbatorix" class="uri" title="wikilink">Galbatorix</a> in his rise to power. Accompanied by <a href="Brom_(Inheritance)" title="wikilink">Brom</a>, a mysterious old storyteller from his village who knows much about the Dragon Riders, swordfighting, and magic, Eragon learns the ways of the Dragon Riders as they hunt down the elusive Ra'zac.</p>
<p>Much researching in the town of Teirm leads Brom to the conclusion that the Ra'zac reside in Dras-Leona.</p>
<p>However, revenge is not what Eragon finds in Dras-Leona. He, Saphira, and Brom are instead lured into the Ra'zac's ambush. They are rescued by a mysterious stranger, <a href="Murtagh" class="uri" title="wikilink">Murtagh</a>. Unfortunately, Brom is gravely injured, and he soon dies--but not before revealing his past to Eragon. Eragon is shocked to find that Brom was also a Dragon Rider that lost his dragon. The new company of three (Eragon, Murtagh and Saphira) travel in search of the hidden <a href="Alaga&lt;U+00EB&gt;sia#Varden" title="wikilink">Varden</a>, a strong rebel faction which Brom had mentioned on their journey. On the way Eragon has many dreams about an <a href="Alaga&lt;U+00EB&gt;sia#Elves" title="wikilink">elf</a>, all of which feature her suffering great pain. Ultimately, Eragon is captured and imprisoned in the same prison as where the elf is being held captive. Murtagh and Saphira stage a daring rescue and Eragon escapes with the elf, but this does not happen without incident. Eragon and Murtagh have a face - off with a <a href="Alaga&lt;U+00EB&gt;sia#Shades" title="wikilink">Shade</a>, one of the most powerful creatures in the land. The fact that a Shade is walking freely in the land lends Eragon to believe that some monstorous plan is afoot and that Galbatorix, the king of Alaga&lt;U+00EB&gt;sia, himself a traitor of the dragon riders, has allied himself with the foulest creatures of the land. The new Dragon rider faces many perils on his way to the Varden, specifically the army of Urgals at their heels. Once inside the Varden's fortress, hidden deep within the <a href="Beor_Mountains" title="wikilink">Beor Mountains</a>, Eragon learns of the pact between the <a href="Alaga&lt;U+00EB&gt;sia#Dwarves" title="wikilink">dwarves</a>, the elves and the Varden and how it was that Saphira's egg was magically teleported to the Spine. The group is at last able to rest, but the invasion by the army of Urgals is imminent. An intercepted message from Galbatorix confirms their fears that the king is involved. In a battle that follows, a seemingly endless army of Urgals seem poised to take the fortress, before Eragon destroys the Shade, <a href="Durza" class="uri" title="wikilink">Durza</a>, that he had recently encountered, but at a price: a terrible wound on his back that leaves him disfigured. The Urgals seem to be lifted from a spell, giving the Varden a chance to rout the Urgals. As the story ends at the close of the battle, we learn that Eragon will soon be sent under the tutelage of the elves in the sequel, <em><a href="Eldest" class="uri" title="wikilink">Eldest</a></em>.</p>

<h2 id="the-ancient-language">The Ancient Language</h2>
<ul>
<li><em>Main article</em> <a href="Ancient_Language_(Inheritance)" title="wikilink">Ancient Language (Inheritance)</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The Ancient Language, also referred to as the 'Language of Power', is the Elven language in the book that enables certain people to use magic. Because of the nature of the language, it is impossible to lie, but one can mislead, as the Elves show in abundance. Eragon uses it many times in the books. The Ancient Language is based on Old Norse and Icelandic.</p>
<h2 id="critical-reaction">Critical reaction</h2>
<p>There has been much criticism of <em>Eragon</em>, regarding everything from word usage to the <a href="Marketing" title="wikilink">marketing techniques</a> (critics deride the labelling of the author as a &quot;prodigy&quot; or &quot;wunderkind&quot;). The book's most frequent criticism is that it uses far too many <a href="clich&lt;U+00E9&gt;s" class="uri" title="wikilink">clich&lt;U+00E9&gt;s</a>. Paolini employs stock characters, such as <a href="Elf" title="wikilink">Elves</a>, <a href="Dwarf" title="wikilink">Dwarves</a>, and a pseudo-<a href="Orc" title="wikilink">orcish</a> race known as <a href="Urgal" title="wikilink">Urgals</a>, complete with an elite sect known as the Kull, comparable to <a href="Saruman" title="wikilink">Saruman's</a> <a href="uruk-hai" class="uri" title="wikilink">uruk-hai</a>. Many believe that it is a marvel that <em>Eragon</em> is on bookshelves, given that the publisher of the book was the author's parents. However, after seeing the success of <em>Eragon</em>, Alfred A. Knopf bought the book rights from the Paolinis.</p>
<h3 id="reviews">Reviews</h3>
<p>Reviews of <em>Eragon</em> were mixed, although more solidly positive than the reviews of the book's sequel, <em>Eldest</em>. <em>KLIATT</em> found the book &quot;exceptional&quot;, and <em>Children's Literature</em> said Paolini's &quot;eye and ear for detail, especially in describing the natural world, are topnotch&quot;. <em><a href="VOYA" class="uri" title="wikilink">VOYA</a></em>'s response was more balanced between praise and mild critique, saying,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Overwritten action sequences and occasionally forced dialogue do not detract too much from the interesting and entertaining tale. Now and then losing its direction and sometimes a bit immature in style, Paolini's debut novel will make readers long for the second volume in hopes of finding both Eragon and the writing a bit more polished.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em><a href="School_Library_Journal" title="wikilink">School Library Journal</a></em>, while noting correctly that the book would garner many fans, added that it &quot;does not approach the depth, uniqueness, or mastery of J. R. R. Tolkien's works, and sometimes the magic solutions are just too convenient for getting out of difficult situations.&quot;</p>
<p><em><a href="Entertainment_Weekly" title="wikilink">Entertainment Weekly</a></em> lambasted the sequel, <em>Eldest</em>, calling it a &quot;Tolkien knockoff,&quot; saying it owed another debt to <em><a href="Star_Wars" title="wikilink">Star Wars</a></em> (implying the first did as well), and that overall it is &quot;mind-numbingly silly,&quot; finally giving the book a rating of D- <a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>. Later, they named it the number one worst book of 2005, calling it a &quot;700-page Tolkien wannabe <a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a>.&quot;</p>
<h3 id="derivative-nature-of-the-books">Derivative nature of the books</h3>
<p>Many critics, both amateur <a href="http://www.anti-shurtugal.com/">1</a>, <a href="http://members.aol.com/swankivy/eragon.html">2</a> and profesional have cited the books for its derivative nature, the most commonly referred to derivations being those of <em><a href="Star_Wars" title="wikilink">Star Wars</a></em>, for the exacting similarity in plot, and <em><a href="Lord_of_the_Rings" title="wikilink">Lord of the Rings</a></em> for much of the setting, the elven and dwarven races, and much of its use of made-up languages and names derived directly from Tolkien's work:</p>

</ul>
<p>Professional sources decrying the book's derivations from Tolkien include <em><a href="USAToday" class="uri" title="wikilink">USAToday</a></em>, stating that the book &quot;echoes Tolkien in its pseudo-Celtic language and imagined universe of dwarfs and elves <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/life/movies/news/2004-01-20-fantasy-films-main_x.htm">3</a>,&quot; while <em><a href="Entertainment_Weekly" title="wikilink">Entertainment Weekly</a></em> also cites a specific trope from Tolkien, &quot;the ageless elves speak wisdom <a href="http://www.ew.com/ew/article/commentary/0,6115,1142746_5_0_,00.html">4</a>.&quot; Even positive reviews of the books can not help but note how derivative the texts are, such as this quote from Kirkus's review of <em>Eldest</em>, noting that it is &quot;suffused with purple prose and faux-archaic language,&quot; and is a &quot;patchwork of dialogue, characters and concepts pulled whole cloth from the fantasy canon <a href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/isbninquiry.asp?z=y&amp;pwb=1&amp;ean=9780375826702">5</a>.&quot;</p>
<p><em>School Library Journal</em>'s review of <em>Eragon</em> was positive, despite admitting that &quot;<em>Eragon</em> does not approach the depth, uniqueness, or mastery of J. R. R. Tolkien's works, and sometimes the magic solutions are just too convenient for getting out of difficult situations<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/product-description/0375826688/ref=dp_proddesc_0/103-6616238-9082248?%5Fencoding=UTF8&amp;n=283155">6</a>,&quot; but its review of <em>Eldest</em> has grown more negative, noting that &quot;The plot -- indeed, most of the fantasy conventions -- is heavily inspired by Tolkien, McCaffrey, and especially George Lucas,&quot; and that it will find a fan-base though &quot;there's nothing particularly original here <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/product-description/037582670X/ref=dp_proddesc_0/103-6616238-9082248?%5Fencoding=UTF8&amp;n=283155">7</a>.&quot;</p>
<p>Commonsensemedia, a family-friendly review site was particularly scathing, stating that, &quot;It's not long, however, before they begin to notice the long-winded descriptions, the clich&lt;U+00E9&gt;s and hackneyed dialogue, and the derivative nature of the plot -- straight out of <em>Star Wars</em> by way of <em>The Lord of the Rings</em>, with bits of other great fantasies thrown in here and there. That this is a great achievement for one so young is undeniable, and many children will love it. It certainly ranks right up there with other derivative, overblown fantasies written by adults, such as Terry Brooks's Sword of Shannara series<a href="http://www.commonsensemedia.org/reviews/review.php?show=overview&amp;id=2219&amp;type=Book">8</a>.&quot;</p>
<p>Yet another criticism, such as this from <em>USAToday</em>: &quot;The novel also owes a debt to Luke Skywalker as the teen hero trains to be a Dragon Rider while avenging his uncle's murder <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/life/movies/news/2004-01-20-fantasy-films-main_x.htm">9</a>&quot; - is that the plot closely resembles that of the original <em><a href="Star_Wars" title="wikilink">Star Wars</a></em> saga<a href="http://www.ew.com/ew/article/review/book/0,6115,1095866_5_0_,00.html">10</a>. Characters are also similar, down to <a href="Brom" class="uri" title="wikilink">Brom</a> who is supposedly the last of his order. Brom's sacrifice to save Eragon resembles that of Obi Wan Kenobi in <em>Star Wars</em>. The beginning is also extremely similar: A servant of an evil emperor attacks, with an army at his disposal, a convoy bearing an object of power to a rebellion against the Empire. The servant captures the convoy and its leader, but the leader (a princess, no less) sends the object away in hopes that it will fall into the hands of a wise old wizard, who is the last of his kind. The object is found by a poor farm boy, whose family (not parents but uncle) is killed as a result, leaving him nothing to stay behind for. He joins the wizard on a quest, as well as a rogue who has no love for the &quot;empire&quot;. They save the princess, then the three flee to the rebels. This could be used to describe the first <em><a href="Star_Wars_Episode_IV:_A_New_Hope" title="wikilink">Star Wars</a></em> movie, and no one would know the difference. In <em>Eldest</em>, there are also obvious plot similarities to the second <em>Star Wars</em> film, <em><a href="Star_Wars_Episode_V:_The_Empire_Strikes_Back" title="wikilink">The Empire Strikes Back</a></em>, as the farmboy leaves the rebels after they have just fought a costly battle to train with a wise old hermit in a forest. He trains and undergoes a life changing experience, and later participates in another great battle. He duels with an enemy, and learns a terrible secret about his family (Father/Brother and Father).</p>
