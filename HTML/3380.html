<p><strong>Tikal</strong> (or <strong>Tik&lt;U+2019&gt;al</strong> according to the modern Mayan orthography) is one of the largest archaeological sites and urban centres of the <a href="pre-Columbian" class="uri" title="wikilink">pre-Columbian</a> <a href="Maya_civilization" title="wikilink">Maya civilization</a>. It is located in the archaeological region of the <a href="Pet&lt;U+00E9&gt;n_Basin" title="wikilink">Pet&lt;U+00E9&gt;n Basin</a> in what is now modern-day northern <a href="Guatemala" class="uri" title="wikilink">Guatemala</a>. Situated in the <a href="Departments_of_Guatemala" title="wikilink">department</a> of <a href="El_Pet&lt;U+00E9&gt;n" title="wikilink">El Pet&lt;U+00E9&gt;n</a>, the site is part of Guatemala's <strong>Tikal National Park</strong> and in 1979 it was declared a <a href="UNESCO" class="uri" title="wikilink">UNESCO</a> <a href="World_Heritage_Site" title="wikilink">World Heritage Site</a>.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>Tikal was the capital of a conquest state that became one of the most powerful kingdoms of the ancient Maya.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> Though monumental architecture at the site dates back as far as the <a href="4th_century_BC" title="wikilink">4th century BC</a>, Tikal reached its apogee during the <a href="Mesoamerican_chronology" title="wikilink">Classic Period</a>, ca. 200 to 900 AD. During this time, the city dominated much of the Maya region politically, economically, and militarily, while interacting with areas throughout <a href="Mesoamerica" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mesoamerica</a> such as the great metropolis of <a href="Teotihuacan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Teotihuacan</a> in the distant <a href="Valley_of_Mexico" title="wikilink">Valley of Mexico</a>. There is evidence that Tikal was conquered by Teotihuacan in the 4th century AD.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> Following the end of the Late Classic Period, no new major monuments were built at Tikal and there is evidence that elite palaces were burned. These events were coupled with a gradual population decline, culminating with the site&lt;U+2019&gt;s abandonment by the end of the 10th century.</p>
<p>Tikal is the best understood of any of the large lowland Maya cities, with a long <a href="Maya_rulers" title="wikilink">dynastic ruler</a> list, the discovery of the tombs of many of the rulers on this list and the investigation of their <a href="Monumental_sculpture" title="wikilink">monuments</a>, temples and palaces.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="etymology">Etymology</h2>
<p><img src="Tikalemblem.jpg" title="fig:Emblem Glyph for Tikal (Mutal)" alt="Emblem Glyph for Tikal (Mutal)" /> The name Tikal may be derived from <em>ti ak'al</em> in the <a href="Yucatec_Maya_language" title="wikilink">Yucatec Maya language</a>; it is said to be a relatively modern name meaning &quot;at the waterhole&quot;. The name was apparently applied to one of the site's ancient reservoirs by hunters and travellers in the region.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> It has alternatively been interpreted as meaning &quot;the place of the voices&quot; in the <a href="Itza&#39;_language" title="wikilink">Itza Maya language</a>. At any rate, Tikal is not the ancient name for the site but rather the name adopted shortly after its discovery in the 1840s.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> <a href="Maya_script" title="wikilink">Hieroglyphic inscriptions</a> at the ruins refer to the ancient city as <em>Yax Mutal</em> or <em>Yax Mutul</em>, meaning &quot;First Mutal&quot;.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> Tikal may have come to have been called this because <a href="Dos_Pilas" title="wikilink">Dos Pilas</a> also came to use the same emblem glyph; the rulers of the city presumably wanted to distinguish themselves as the first city to bear the name.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> The kingdom as a whole was simply called <em>Mutul</em>,<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> which is the reading of the &quot;hair bundle&quot; <a href="Maya_script#Emblem_Glyph" title="wikilink">Emblem Glyph</a> seen in the accompanying photo. Its precise meaning remains obscure,<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> although some scholars think that it is the hair knot of the <a href="Ahau" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ahau</a> or ruler.</p>

<p>The ruins lie among the tropical <a href="rainforest" title="wikilink">rainforests</a> of northern Guatemala that formed the cradle of lowland Maya civilization.

For centuries this city was completely covered under jungle. The average annual rainfall at Tikal is .<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a></p>
<p>One of the largest of the Classic Maya cities, Tikal had no water other than what was collected from rainwater and stored in ten reservoirs. Archaeologists working in Tikal during the 20th century refurbished one of these ancient reservoirs to store water for their own use.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> The absence of springs, rivers, and lakes in the immediate vicinity of Tikal highlights a prodigious feat: building a major city with only supplies of stored <a href="Wet_season" title="wikilink">seasonal rainfall</a>. Tikal prospered with <a href="Intensive_farming" title="wikilink">intensive agricultural techniques</a>, which were far more advanced than the <a href="slash_and_burn" title="wikilink">slash and burn</a> methods originally theorized by archaeologists. The reliance on seasonal rainfall left Tikal vulnerable to prolonged drought, which is thought by some to have played a role in the Classic Maya Collapse.</p>
<p>The Tikal <a href="List_of_national_parks_of_Guatemala" title="wikilink">National Park</a> covers an area of . It was created on 26 May 1955 under the auspices of the <a href="Instituto_de_Antropolog&lt;U+00ED&gt;a_e_Historia" title="wikilink">Instituto de Antropolog&lt;U+00ED&gt;a e Historia</a> and was the first protected area in Guatemala.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="population">Population</h2>
<p>Population estimates for Tikal vary from 10,000 to as high as 90,000 inhabitants, with the most likely figure being at the upper end of this range.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> Because of the low <a href="salt" class="uri" title="wikilink">salt</a> content of the <a href="Maya_cuisine" title="wikilink">Maya diet</a>, it is estimated that Tikal would have had to import 131 tons of salt each year, based on a conservative population estimate of 45,000.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a></p>
<p>The population of Tikal began a continuous curve of growth starting in the <a href="Mesoamerican_chronology" title="wikilink">Preclassic Period</a> (approximately 2000 BC &lt;U+2013&gt; AD 200), with a peak in the Late Classic with the population growing rapidly from AD 700 through to 830, followed by a sharp decline. For the  area falling within the earthwork defences of the <a href="hinterland" class="uri" title="wikilink">hinterland</a>, the peak population is estimated at 517 per square kilometre (1340 per square mile). In an area within a  radius of the site core, peak population is estimated at 120,000; population density is estimated at 265 per square kilometre (689 per square mile). In a region within a  radius of the site core and including some satellite sites, peak population is estimated at 425,000 with a density of 216 per square kilometre (515 per square mile). These population figures are even more impressive because of the extensive <a href="swamp" title="wikilink">swamplands</a> that were unsuitable for habitation or agriculture. However, some archaeologists, such as David Webster, believe these figures to be far too high.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a></p>

<p>Major construction at Tikal was already taking place in the Late Preclassic period, first appearing around 400&lt;U+2013&gt;300 BC, including the building of major <a href="Mesoamerican_pyramids" title="wikilink">pyramids</a> and platforms, although the city was still dwarfed by sites further north such as <a href="El_Mirador" title="wikilink">El Mirador</a> and <a href="Nakbe" class="uri" title="wikilink">Nakbe</a>.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a><a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> At this time, Tikal participated in the widespread <a href="Chikanel" class="uri" title="wikilink">Chikanel</a> culture that dominated the Central and Northern Maya areas at this time &lt;U+2013&gt; a region that included the entire <a href="Yucatan_Peninsula" title="wikilink">Yucatan Peninsula</a> including northern and eastern Guatemala and all of Belize.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a></p>
<p>Two temples dating to Late Chikanel times had masonry-walled <a href="superstructure" title="wikilink">superstructures</a> that may have been <a href="Corbel_arch" title="wikilink">corbel-vaulted</a>, although this has not been proven.

<p>In the 1st century AD rich burials first appeared and Tikal underwent a political and cultural florescence as its giant northern neighbours declined.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> At the end of the Late Preclassic, the <a href="Izapa" title="wikilink">Izapan</a> style art and architecture from the <a href="Pacific_Ocean" title="wikilink">Pacific</a> Coast began to influence Tikal, as demonstrated by a broken sculpture from the <a href="acropolis" class="uri" title="wikilink">acropolis</a> and early murals at the city.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="early-classic">Early Classic</h3>
<p><a href="Dynasty" title="wikilink">Dynastic</a> rulership among the lowland Maya is most deeply rooted at Tikal. According to later <a href="hieroglyph" title="wikilink">hieroglyphic</a> records, the dynasty was founded by Yax-Moch-Xoc, perhaps in the 3rd century AD.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> At the beginning of the Early Classic, power in the Maya region was concentrated at Tikal and Calakmul, in the core of the Maya heartland.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a></p>
<p>Tikal may have benefited from the collapse of the large Preclassic states such as <a href="El_Mirador" title="wikilink">El Mirador</a>. In the Early Classic Tikal rapidly developed into the most dynamic city in the Maya region, stimulating the development of other nearby <a href="List_of_Maya_sites" title="wikilink">Maya cities</a>.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a></p>
<p>The site, however, was often at <a href="Maya_warfare" title="wikilink">war</a> and inscriptions tell of alliances and conflict with other Maya states, including <a href="Uaxactun" class="uri" title="wikilink">Uaxactun</a>, <a href="Caracol,_Belize" title="wikilink">Caracol</a>, <a href="Naranjo,_Guatemala" title="wikilink">Naranjo</a> and <a href="Calakmul" class="uri" title="wikilink">Calakmul</a>. The site was defeated at the end of the Early Classic by Caracol, which rose to take Tikal's place as the paramount centre in the southern Maya lowlands.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> The earlier part of the Early Classic saw hostilities between Tikal and its neighbour Uaxactun, with Uaxactun recording the capture of prisoners from Tikal.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a></p>

<p><a href="R&lt;U+00ED&gt;o_Azul" title="wikilink">R&lt;U+00ED&gt;o Azul</a>, a small site  northeast of Tikal, was conquered by the latter during the reign of Yax Nuun Ayiin I.

<p>Although the new rulers of Tikal were foreign, their descendents were rapidly Mayanised. Tikal became the key ally and trading partner of Teotihuacan in the Maya lowlands. After being conquered by Teotihuacan, Tikal rapidly dominated the northern and eastern Peten. Uaxactun, together with smaller towns in the region, were absorbed into Tikal's kingdom. Other sites, such as <a href="Bejucal_(Mesoamerican_site)" title="wikilink">Bejucal</a> and <a href="Motul_de_San_Jos&lt;U+00E9&gt;" title="wikilink">Motul de San Jos&lt;U+00E9&gt;</a> near <a href="Lake_Pet&lt;U+00E9&gt;n_Itz&lt;U+00E1&gt;" title="wikilink">Lake Pet&lt;U+00E9&gt;n Itz&lt;U+00E1&gt;</a> became <a href="vassal_state" title="wikilink">vassals</a> of their more powerful neighbour to the north.

<p>Around the 5th century an impressive system of fortifications consisting of ditches and <a href="Earthworks_(archaeology)" title="wikilink">earthworks</a> was built along the northern periphery of Tikal's hinterland, joining up with the natural defences provided by large areas of swampland lying to the east and west of the city. Additional fortifications were probably also built to the south. These defences protected Tikal's core population and agricultural resources, encircling an area of approximately .<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a></p>

<p>In the 5th century the power of the city reached as far south as Cop&lt;U+00E1&gt;n, whose founder <a href="K&#39;inich_Yax_K&#39;uk&#39;_Mo&#39;" title="wikilink">K'inich Yax K'uk' Mo'</a> was clearly connected with Tikal.<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a> Cop&lt;U+00E1&gt;n itself was not in an ethnically Maya region and the founding of the Cop&lt;U+00E1&gt;n dynasty probably involved the direct intervention of Tikal.<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a> K'inich Yax K'uk' Mo' arrived in Cop&lt;U+00E1&gt;n in December 426 and bone analysis of his remains shows that he passed his childhood and youth at Tikal.<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a> An individual known as <a href="Ajaw" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ajaw</a> K'uk' Mo' (lord K'uk' Mo') is referred to in an early text at Tikal and may well be the same person.<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a> His tomb had Teotihuacan characteristics and he was depicted in later portraits dressed in the warrior garb of Teotihuacan. Hieroglyphic texts refer to him as &quot;Lord of the West&quot;, much like Siyah K&lt;U+2019&gt;ak&lt;U+2019&gt;.<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a> At the same time, in late 426, Cop&lt;U+00E1&gt;n founded the nearby site of <a href="Quirigu&lt;U+00E1&gt;" class="uri" title="wikilink">Quirigu&lt;U+00E1&gt;</a>, possibly sponsored by Tikal itself.<a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a> The founding of these two centres may have been part of an effort to impose Tikal's authority upon the southeastern portion of the Maya region.<a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a> The interaction between these sites and Tikal was intense over the next three centuries.<a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a></p>
<p>A long-running rivalry between Tikal and Calakmul began in the 6th century, with each of the two cities forming its own network of mutually hostile alliances arrayed against each other in what has been likened to a long-running war between two Maya superpowers. The kings of these two capitals adopted the title <em>kaloomte</em>', a term that has not been precisely translated but that implies something akin to &quot;<a href="high_king" title="wikilink">high king</a>&quot;.<a href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a></p>
<p>The early 6th century saw another queen ruling the city, known only as the &quot;Lady of Tikal&quot;, who was very likely a daughter of Chak Tok Ich'aak II. She seems never to have ruled in her own right, rather being partnered with male co-rulers. The first of these was Kaloomte' B'alam, who seems to have had a long career as a general at Tikal before becoming co-ruler and 19th in the dynastic sequence. The Lady of Tikal herself seems not have been counted in the dynastic numbering. It appears she was later paired with lord &quot;Bird Claw&quot;, who is presumed to be the otherwise unknown 20th ruler.<a href="#fn67" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a></p>

<h4 id="tikal-hiatus">Tikal hiatus</h4>
<p>In the mid 6th century, <a href="Caracol,_Belize" title="wikilink">Caracol</a> seems to have allied with Calakmul and defeated Tikal, closing the Early Classic.<a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a> The &quot;Tikal hiatus&quot; refers to a period between the late 6th to late 7th century where there was a lapse in the writing of inscriptions and large-scale construction at Tikal. In the latter half of the 6th century AD a serious crisis befell the city, with no new stelae being erected and with widespread deliberate mutilation of <a href="public_art" title="wikilink">public sculpture</a>.<a href="#fn69" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref69"><sup>69</sup></a> This hiatus in activity at Tikal was long unexplained until later <a href="Epigraphy" title="wikilink">epigraphic</a> decipherments identified that the period was prompted by Tikal's comprehensive defeat at the hands of Calakmul and the Caracol polity in AD 562, a defeat that seems to have resulted in the capture and <a href="Human_sacrifice" title="wikilink">sacrifice</a> of the king of Tikal.<a href="#fn70" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a> The badly eroded Altar 21 at Caracol described how Tikal suffered this disastrous defeat in a major war in 562. It seems that Caracol was an ally of Calakmul in the wider conflict between that city and Tikal, with the defeat of Tikal having a lasting impact upon the city.<a href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a> Tikal was not sacked but its power and influence were broken.<a href="#fn72" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref72"><sup>72</sup></a> After its great victory, Caracol grew rapidly and some of Tikal's population may have been forcibly relocated there. During the hiatus period, at least one ruler of Tikal took refuge with <a href="Janaab&#39;_Pakal" title="wikilink">Janaab' Pakal</a> of <a href="Palenque" class="uri" title="wikilink">Palenque</a>, another of Calakmul's victims.<a href="#fn73" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref73"><sup>73</sup></a> Calakmul itself thrived during Tikal's long hiatus period.<a href="#fn74" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref74"><sup>74</sup></a></p>
<p>The beginning of the Tikal hiatus has served as a marker by which <a href="archaeologist" title="wikilink">archaeologists</a> commonly sub-divide the Classic period of <a href="Mesoamerican_chronology" title="wikilink">Mesoamerican chronology</a> into the Early and Late Classic.<a href="#fn75" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref75"><sup>75</sup></a></p>
<h4 id="tikal-and-dos-pilas">Tikal and Dos Pilas</h4>
<p>In 629 Tikal founded <a href="Dos_Pilas" title="wikilink">Dos Pilas</a>, some  to the southwest, as a military outpost in order to control trade along the course of the <a href="Pasi&lt;U+00F3&gt;n_River" title="wikilink">Pasi&lt;U+00F3&gt;n River</a>.<a href="#fn76" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref76"><sup>76</sup></a> B'alaj Chan K'awiil was installed on the throne of the new outpost at the age of four, in 635, and for many years served as a loyal vassal fighting for his brother, the king of Tikal.<a href="#fn77" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref77"><sup>77</sup></a> Roughly twenty years later Dos Pilas was attacked by Calakmul and was soundly defeated. B'alaj Chan K'awiil was captured by the king of Calakmul but, instead of being sacrificed, he was re-instated on his throne as a vassal of his former enemy,<a href="#fn78" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref78"><sup>78</sup></a> and attacked Tikal in 657, forcing Nuun Ujol Chaak, the then king of Tikal, to temporarily abandon the city. The first two rulers of Dos Pilas continued to use the Mutal emblem glyph of Tikal, and they probably felt that they had a legitimate claim to the throne of Tikal itself. For some reason, B'alaj Chan K'awiil was not installed as the new ruler of Tikal; instead he stayed at Dos Pilas. Tikal counterattacked against Dos Pilas in 672, driving B'alaj Chan K'awiil into an exile that lasted five years.<a href="#fn79" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref79"><sup>79</sup></a> Calakmul tried to encircle Tikal within an area dominated by its allies, such as El Peru, Dos Pilas and Caracol.<a href="#fn80" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref80"><sup>80</sup></a></p>
<p>In 682, Jasaw Chan K'awiil erected the first dated monument at Tikal in 120 years and claimed the title of <em>kaloomte</em>', so ending the hiatus. He initiated a programme of new construction and turned the tables on Calakmul when, in 695, he captured the enemy king and threw the enemy state into a long decline from which it never recovered. After this, Calakmul never again erected a monument celebrating a military victory.<a href="#fn81" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref81"><sup>81</sup></a> This defeat of Calakmul restored Tikal&lt;U+2019&gt;s pre-eminence in the Central Maya region, but never again in the southwest Pet&lt;U+00E9&gt;n, where Dos Pilas maintained its presence.</p>

Even after this, formal war attire illustrated on monuments was Teotihuacan style.<a href="#fn82" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref82"><sup>82</sup></a> Jasaw Chan K'awiil I and his heir Yik'in Chan K'awiil continued hostilities against Calakmul and its allies and imposed firm regional control over the area around Tikal, extending as far as the territory around <a href="Lake_Pet&lt;U+00E9&gt;n_Itz&lt;U+00E1&gt;" title="wikilink">Lake Pet&lt;U+00E9&gt;n Itz&lt;U+00E1&gt;</a>.

<p>In 738, Quirigu&lt;U+00E1&gt;, a vassal of Cop&lt;U+00E1&gt;n, Tikal's key ally in the south, switched allegiance to Calakmul, defeated Cop&lt;U+00E1&gt;n and gained its own independence.<a href="#fn84" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref84"><sup>84</sup></a> It appears that this was a conscious effort on the part of Calakmul to bring about the collapse of Tikal's southern allies.<a href="#fn85" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref85"><sup>85</sup></a> This upset the balance of power in the southern Maya area and lead to a steady decline in the fortunes of Cop&lt;U+00E1&gt;n.<a href="#fn86" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref86"><sup>86</sup></a></p>

<h3 id="terminal-classic">Terminal Classic</h3>
<p>By the 9th century, the crisis of the <a href="Classic_Maya_collapse" title="wikilink">Classic Maya collapse</a> was sweeping across the region, with populations plummeting and city after city falling into silence.<a href="#fn89" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref89"><sup>89</sup></a> Increasingly <a href="endemic_warfare" title="wikilink">endemic warfare</a> in the Maya region caused Tikal's supporting population to heavily concentrate close to the city itself, accelerating the use of <a href="Intensive_farming" title="wikilink">intensive agriculture</a> and corresponding <a href="Environmental_degradation" title="wikilink">environmental decline</a>.<a href="#fn90" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref90"><sup>90</sup></a> Construction continued at the beginning of the century, with the erection of Temple 3, the last of the city's major <a href="pyramid" title="wikilink">pyramids</a> and the erection of monuments to mark the 19th <a href="Katun_(Maya_calendar)" title="wikilink">K'atun</a> in 810.<a href="#fn91" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref91"><sup>91</sup></a> The beginning of the 10th <a href="Baktun" title="wikilink">Bak'tun</a> in 830 passed uncelebrated, and marks the beginning of a 60 year hiatus, probably resulting from the collapse of central control in the city.<a href="#fn92" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref92"><sup>92</sup></a> During this hiatus, satellite sites traditionally under Tikal's control began to erect their own monuments featuring local rulers and using the Mutal emblem glyph, with Tikal apparently lacking the authority or the power to crush these bids for independence.<a href="#fn93" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref93"><sup>93</sup></a> In 849, Jewel K'awiil is mentioned on a stela at <a href="Seibal" class="uri" title="wikilink">Seibal</a> as visiting that city as the Divine Lord of Tikal but he is not recorded elsewhere and Tikal's once great power was little more than a memory. The sites of <a href="Ixlu" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ixlu</a> and <a href="Jimbal" class="uri" title="wikilink">Jimbal</a> had by now inherited the once exclusive Mutal <a href="Maya_script#Emblem_Glyph" title="wikilink">emblem glyph</a>.<a href="#fn94" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref94"><sup>94</sup></a></p>
<p>As Tikal and its hinterland reached peak population, the area suffered <a href="deforestation" class="uri" title="wikilink">deforestation</a>, <a href="Soil_erosion" title="wikilink">erosion</a> and nutrient loss followed by a rapid <a href="population_decline" title="wikilink">decline in population levels</a>. Tikal and its immediate surroundings seem to have lost the majority of its population during the period from 830 to 950 and central authority seems to have collapsed rapidly.<a href="#fn95" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref95"><sup>95</sup></a> There is not much evidence from Tikal that the city was directly affected by the endemic warfare that afflicted parts of the Maya region during the Terminal Classic, although an influx of refugees from the <a href="Petexbat&lt;U+00FA&gt;n" class="uri" title="wikilink">Petexbat&lt;U+00FA&gt;n</a> region may have exacerbated problems resulting from the already stretched environmental resources.<a href="#fn96" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref96"><sup>96</sup></a></p>

This was the last monument erected at Tikal before the city finally fell into silence. The former satellites of Tikal, such as Jimbal and Uaxactun, did not last much longer, erecting their final monuments in 889. By the end of the 9th century the vast majority of Tikal's population had deserted the city, its royal palaces were occupied by <a href="Squatting" title="wikilink">squatters</a> and simple <a href="thatching" title="wikilink">thatched</a> dwellings were being erected in the city's ceremonial plazas. The squatters blocked some doorways in the rooms the reoccupied in the monumental structures of the site and left rubbish that included a mixture of domestic refuse and non-utilitarian items such as musical instruments. These inhabitants reused the earlier monuments for their own ritual activities far removed from those of the royal <a href="dynasty" class="uri" title="wikilink">dynasty</a> that had erected them. Some monuments were vandalised and some were moved to new locations. Before its final abandonment all respect for the old rulers had disappeared, with the tombs of the North <a href="Acropolis" class="uri" title="wikilink">Acropolis</a> being explored for <a href="jade" class="uri" title="wikilink">jade</a> and the easier to find tombs being looted. After 950, Tikal was all but deserted, although a remnant population may have survived in perishable huts interspersed among the ruins. Even these final inhabitants abandoned the city in the 10th or 11th centuries and the <a href="rainforest" class="uri" title="wikilink">rainforest</a> claimed the ruins for the next thousand years. Some of Tikal's population may have migrated to the Peten Lakes region, which remained heavily populated in spite of a plunge in population levels in the first half of the 9th century.<a href="#fn97" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref97"><sup>97</sup></a><a href="#fn98" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref98"><sup>98</sup></a><a href="#fn99" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref99"><sup>99</sup></a></p>
<p>The most likely cause of collapse at Tikal is <a href="overpopulation" class="uri" title="wikilink">overpopulation</a> and agrarian failure. The fall of Tikal was a blow to the heart of Classic <a href="Maya_civilization" title="wikilink">Maya civilization</a>, the city having been at the forefront of courtly life, <a href="Maya_art" title="wikilink">art</a> and <a href="Maya_architecture" title="wikilink">architecture</a> for over a thousand years, with an ancient ruling dynasty.<a href="#fn100" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref100"><sup>100</sup></a></p>

<p>The <strong>North Acropolis</strong>, together with the Great Plaza immediately to the south, is one of the most studied architectural groups in the Maya area; the Tikal Project excavated a massive trench across the complex, thoroughly investigating its construction history. It is a complex group with construction beginning in the Preclassic Period, around 350 BC. It developed into a funerary complex for the ruling dynasty of the Classic Period, with each additional royal burial adding new temples on top of the older structures. After AD 400 a row of tall pyramids was added to the earlier Northern Platform, which measured , gradually hiding it from view. Eight temple pyramids were built in the 6th century AD, each of them had an elaborate <a href="Roof_comb" title="wikilink">roofcomb</a> and a stairway flanked by masks of the gods. By the 9th century AD, 43 stelae and 30 altars had been erected in the North Acropolis; 18 of these monuments were carved with <a href="Maya_script" title="wikilink">hieroglyphic texts</a> and royal portraits. The North Acropolis continued to receive burials into the Postclassic Period.<a href="#fn133" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref133"><sup>133</sup></a><a href="#fn134" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref134"><sup>134</sup></a></p>

<p><strong>Group G</strong> lies just south of the Mendez Causeway. The complex dates to the Late Classic and consists of palace-type structures and is one of the largest groups of its type at Tikal. It has two stories but most of the rooms are on the lower floor, a total of 29 <a href="Vault_(architecture)" title="wikilink">vaulted</a> chambers. The remains of two further chambers belong to the upper storey. One of the entrances to the group was framed by a gigantic mask.<a href="#fn138" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref138"><sup>138</sup></a></p>

<p>There are nine <strong>Twin-Pyramid Complexes</strong> at Tikal, one of which was completely dismantled in ancient times and some others were partly destroyed. They vary in size but consist of two pyramids facing each other on an east-west axis.<a href="#fn140" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref140"><sup>140</sup></a> These pyramids are flat-topped and have stairways on all four sides. A row of plain stelae is placed immediately to the west of the eastern pyramid and to the north of the pyramids, and lying roughly equidistant from them, there is usually a sculpted stela and altar pair. On the south side of these complexes there is a long vaulted building containing a single room with nine doorways. The entire complex was built at once and these complexes were built at 20 year (or <em>k'atun</em>) intervals during the Late Classic.<a href="#fn141" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref141"><sup>141</sup></a> The first Twin Pyramid Complex was built in the early 6th century in the East Plaza.

<h3 id="structures">Structures</h3>
<p><img src="Belize-tikal.jpg" title="fig:Temple II on the main plaza" alt="Temple II on the main plaza" /> There are thousands of ancient structures at Tikal and only a fraction of these have been <a href="Excavation_(archaeology)" title="wikilink">excavated</a>, after decades of <a href="archaeology" title="wikilink">archaeological</a> work. The most prominent surviving buildings include six very large <a href="Mesoamerican_pyramids" title="wikilink">Mesoamerican step pyramids</a>, labelled Temples I - VI, each of which support a <a href="temple" class="uri" title="wikilink">temple</a> structure on their summits. Some of these pyramids are over 60 metres high (200 feet). They were numbered sequentially during the early survey of the site. It is estimated that each of these major temples could have been built in as little as two years.<a href="#fn146" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref146"><sup>146</sup></a></p>
<p>The majority of pyramids currently visible at Tikal were built during Tikal&lt;U+2019&gt;s resurgence following the Tikal Hiatus (i.e., from the late 7th to the early 9th century). It should be noted, however, that the majority of these structures contain sub-structures that were initially built prior to the hiatus.</p>
<p><strong><a href="Tikal_Temple_I" title="wikilink">Temple I</a></strong> (also known as the <em>Temple of Ah Cacao</em> or <em>Temple of the Great Jaguar</em>) is a funerary pyramid dedicated to Hasaw Chan K'awil, who was entombed in the structure in AD 734,<a href="#fn147" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref147"><sup>147</sup></a><a href="#fn148" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref148"><sup>148</sup></a> the pyramid was completed around 740&lt;U+2013&gt;750.<a href="#fn149" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref149"><sup>149</sup></a> The temple rises  high.<a href="#fn150" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref150"><sup>150</sup></a> The massive roofcomb that topped the temple was originally decorated with a giant sculpture of the enthroned king, although little of this decoration survives.<a href="#fn151" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref151"><sup>151</sup></a> The tomb of the king was discovered by Aubrey Trik of the University of Pennsylvania in 1962.<a href="#fn152" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref152"><sup>152</sup></a> Among items recovered from the Late Classic tomb were a large collection of inscribed human and animal bone tubes and strips with sophisticated scenes depicting deities and people, finely carved and rubbed with <a href="vermilion" class="uri" title="wikilink">vermilion</a>, as well as jade and shell ornaments and ceramic vessels filled with offerings of food and drink.<a href="#fn153" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref153"><sup>153</sup></a><a href="#fn154" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref154"><sup>154</sup></a> The shrine at the summit of the pyramid has three chambers, each behind the next, with the doorways spanned by wooden lintels fashioned from multiple beams.

Like other major temples at Tikal, the summit shrine had three consecutive chambers with the doorways spanned by wooden lintels, only the middle of which was carved. The temple was dedicated to the wife of Hasaw Chan K'awil, although no tomb was found. The queen's portrait was carved into the lintel spanning the doorway of the summit shrine.

<p><strong>Temple 33</strong> is a funerary pyramid erected over the tomb of Siyaj Chan K'awiil I (known as Burial 48) in the North Acropolis. It started life in the Early Classic as a wide basal platform decorated with large stucco masks that flanked the stairway. Later in the Early Classic a new superstructure was added, with its own masks and decorated panels. During the Hiatus a third stage was built over the earlier constructions, the stairway was demolished and another royal burial, of an unidentified ruler, was set into the structure (Burial 23).

They are performing a ritual using the bones of an important woman.<a href="#fn188" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref188"><sup>188</sup></a> Altar 5 was found in Complex N, which lies to the west of Temple III.<a href="#fn189" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref189"><sup>189</sup></a></p>
<p><strong>Altar 8</strong> is sculpted with a bound captive.<a href="#fn190" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref190"><sup>190</sup></a> It was found within Complex P in Group H and is now in the <a href="Museo_Nacional_de_Arqueolog&lt;U+00ED&gt;a_y_Etnolog&lt;U+00ED&gt;a" title="wikilink">Museo Nacional de Arqueolog&lt;U+00ED&gt;a y Etnolog&lt;U+00ED&gt;a</a> in <a href="Guatemala_City" title="wikilink">Guatemala City</a>.<a href="#fn191" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref191"><sup>191</sup></a></p>
<p><strong>Altar 9</strong> is associated with Stela 21 and bears the sculpture of a bound captive. It is located in front of Temple VI.<a href="#fn192" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref192"><sup>192</sup></a></p>
<p><strong>Altar 10</strong> is carved with a captive tied to a scaffold.<a href="#fn193" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref193"><sup>193</sup></a> It is in the northern enclosure of Group Q, a twin-pyramid complex and has suffered from erosion.<a href="#fn194" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref194"><sup>194</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="lintels">Lintels</h3>
<p>At Tikal, beams of <a href="sapodilla" class="uri" title="wikilink">sapodilla</a> wood were placed as lintels spanning the inner doorways of temples. These are the most elaborately carved wooden lintels to have survived anywhere in the Maya region.<a href="#fn195" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref195"><sup>195</sup></a></p>
<p><strong>Lintel 3</strong> from Temple IV was taken to <a href="Basel" class="uri" title="wikilink">Basel</a> in <a href="Switzerland" class="uri" title="wikilink">Switzerland</a> in the 19th century. It was in almost perfect condition and depicts Yik'in Chan K'awiil seated on a <a href="palanquin" class="uri" title="wikilink">palanquin</a>.<a href="#fn196" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref196"><sup>196</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="stelae">Stelae</h3>
<p><a href="Stele" title="wikilink">Stelae</a> are carved stone shafts, often sculpted with figures and hieroglyphs. A selection of the most notable stelae at Tikal follows:</p>
<p><strong>Stela 1</strong> dates to the 5th century and depicts the king Siyaj Chan K'awiil II in a standing position.<a href="#fn197" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref197"><sup>197</sup></a></p>
<p><strong>Stela 4</strong> is dated to AD 396, during the reign of Yax Nuun Ayiin after the conquest of Tikal by Teotihuacan.<a href="#fn198" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref198"><sup>198</sup></a> The stela displays a mix of Maya and Teotihuacan qualities, and deities from both cultures. It has a portrait of the king with the Underworld Jaguar God under one arm and the Mexican Tlaloc under the other. His helmet is a simplified version of the Teotihuacan War Serpent. Unusually for Maya sculpture, but typically for Teotihuacan, Yax Nuun Ayiin is depicted with a frontal face, rather than in profile.<a href="#fn199" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref199"><sup>199</sup></a></p>
<p><img src="Tikal_Stela_31.jpg" title="fig:Stela 31, with the sculpted image of Siyah Chan K&#39;awil II." alt="Stela 31, with the sculpted image of Siyah Chan K&#39;awil II." /> <strong>Stela 5</strong> was dedicated in 744 by Yik'in Chan K'awiil.<a href="#fn200" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref200"><sup>200</sup></a></p>
<p><strong>Stela 6</strong> is a badly damaged monument dating to 514 and bears the name of the &quot;Lady of Tikal&quot; who celebrated the end of the 4th K'atun in that year.<a href="#fn201" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref201"><sup>201</sup></a></p>
<p><strong>Stela 10</strong> is twinned with Stela 12 but is badly damaged. It described the accession of Kaloomte' B'alam in the early 6th century and earlier events in his career, including the capture of a prisoner depicted on the monument.<a href="#fn202" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref202"><sup>202</sup></a></p>
<p><strong>Stela 11</strong> was the last monument ever erected at Tikal; it was dedicated in 869 by Jasaw Chan K'awiil II.<a href="#fn203" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref203"><sup>203</sup></a></p>
<p><strong>Stela 12</strong> is linked to the queen known as the &quot;Lady of Tikal&quot; and king Kaloomte' B'alam. The queen is described as performing the year-ending rituals but the monument was dedicated in honour of the king.<a href="#fn204" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref204"><sup>204</sup></a></p>
<p><strong>Stela 16</strong> was dedicated in 711, during the reign of Jasaw Chan K'awiil I. The sculpture, including a portrait of the king and a hieroglyphic text, are limited to the front face of the monument.<a href="#fn205" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref205"><sup>205</sup></a> It was found in Complex N, west of Temple III.<a href="#fn206" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref206"><sup>206</sup></a></p>
<p><strong>Stela 19</strong> was dedicated in 790 by Yax Nuun Ayiin II.<a href="#fn207" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref207"><sup>207</sup></a></p>
<p><strong>Stela 20</strong> was found in Complex P, in Group H, and was moved to the Museo Nacional de Arqueolog&lt;U+00ED&gt;a y Etnolog&lt;U+00ED&gt;a in Guatemala City.<a href="#fn208" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref208"><sup>208</sup></a></p>
<p><strong>Stela 21</strong> was dedicated in 736 by Yik'in Chan K'awiil.<a href="#fn209" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref209"><sup>209</sup></a> Only the bottom of the stela is intact, the rest having been mutilated in ancient times. The surviving sculpture is of fine quality, consisting of the feet of a figure and of accompanying hieroglyphic text. The stela is associated with Altar 9 and is located in front of Temple VI.<a href="#fn210" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref210"><sup>210</sup></a></p>
<p><strong>Stela 22</strong> was dedicated in 771 by Yax Nuun Ayiin II in the northern enclosure of Group Q, a twin-pyramid complex.<a href="#fn211" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref211"><sup>211</sup></a> The face of the figure on the stela has been mutilated.<a href="#fn212" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref212"><sup>212</sup></a></p>
<p><strong>Stela 23</strong> was broken in antiquity and was re-erected in a residential complex. The defaced portrait on the monument is that of the so-called &quot;Lady of Tikal&quot;, a daughter of Chak Tok Ich'aak II who became queen at the age of six but never ruled in her own right, being paired with male co-rulers. It dates to the early 6th century.<a href="#fn213" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref213"><sup>213</sup></a></p>
<p><strong>Stela 24</strong> was erected at the foot of Temple 3 in 810, accompanied by Altar 7. Both were broken into fragments in ancient times, although the name of Dark Sun survives on three fragments.<a href="#fn214" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref214"><sup>214</sup></a></p>
<p><strong>Stela 29</strong> bears a Long Count date equivalent to AD 292, the earliest surviving Long Count date from the Maya lowlands.<a href="#fn215" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref215"><sup>215</sup></a> The stela is also the earliest monument to bear the Tikal emblem glyph. It bears a sculpture of the king facing to the right, holding the head of an underworld jaguar god, one of the patron deities of the city. The stela was deliberately smashed during the 6th century or some time later, the upper portion was dragged away and dumped in a rubbish tip close to Temple III, to be uncovered by archaeologists in 1959.<a href="#fn216" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref216"><sup>216</sup></a><a href="#fn217" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref217"><sup>217</sup></a></p>
<p><strong>Stela 30</strong> is the first surviving monument to be erected after the Hiatus. Its style and iconography is similar to that of Caracol, one of the more important of Tikal's enemies.<a href="#fn218" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref218"><sup>218</sup></a></p>
<p><strong>Stela 31</strong> is the accession monument of Siyah Chan K'awil II, also bearing two portraits of his father, Yax Nuun Ayiin, as a youth dressed as a Teotihuacan warrior. He carries a spearthrower in one hand and bears a shield decorated with the face of <a href="Tlaloc" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tlaloc</a>, the Teotihuacan <a href="war_god" title="wikilink">war god</a>.<a href="#fn219" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref219"><sup>219</sup></a> In ancient times the sculpture was broken and the upper portion was moved to the summit of Temple 33 and ritually buried.<a href="#fn220" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref220"><sup>220</sup></a> Stela 31 has been described as the greatest Early Classic sculpture to survive at Tikal. A long hieroglyphic text is carved onto the back of the monument, the longest to survive from the Early Classic,<a href="#fn221" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref221"><sup>221</sup></a> which describes the arrival of Siyah K'ak' at El Peru and Tikal in January 378.<a href="#fn222" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref222"><sup>222</sup></a> It was also the first stela as Tikal to be carved on all four faces.<a href="#fn223" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref223"><sup>223</sup></a></p>
<p><strong>Stela 32</strong> is a fragmented monument with a foreign Teotihuacan-style sculpture apparently depicting the lord of that city with the attributes of the central Mexican storm god Tlaloc, including his goggle eyes and tasselled headdress.<a href="#fn224" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref224"><sup>224</sup></a></p>
<p><strong>Stela 39</strong> is a broken monument that was erected in the Lost World complex. The upper portion of the stela is missing but the lower portion shows the lower body and legs of Chak Tok Ich'aak, holding a flint axe in his left hand. He is trampling the figure of a bound, richly dressed captive. The monument is dated to AD 376. The text on the back of the monument describes a bloodletting ritual to celebrate a <a href="Katun_(Maya_calendar)" title="wikilink">Katun</a>-ending.<a href="#fn225" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref225"><sup>225</sup></a> The stela also names Chak Tok Ich'aak I's father as K'inich Muwaan Jol.<a href="#fn226" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref226"><sup>226</sup></a></p>
<p><strong>Stela 40</strong> bears a portrait of Kan Chitam and dates to AD 468.<a href="#fn227" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref227"><sup>227</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="burials">Burials</h3>
<p><img src="Burial_10_vessel.jpg" title="fig:A ceramic censer representing an elderly deity, found in Burial 10." alt="A ceramic censer representing an elderly deity, found in Burial 10." /> <strong>Burial 1</strong> is a tomb in the Lost World complex. A fine ceramic bowl was recovered from the tomb, with the handle formed from three-dimensional head and neck of a bird emerging from the two-dimensional body painted on the lid.<a href="#fn228" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref228"><sup>228</sup></a></p>
<p><strong>Burial 10</strong> is the tomb of Yax Nuun Ayiin.<a href="#fn229" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref229"><sup>229</sup></a> It is located beneath Structure 34 in the North Acropolis. The tomb contained a rich array of offerings, including ceramic vessels and food, and nine youths were sacrificed to accompany the dead king.<a href="#fn230" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref230"><sup>230</sup></a> A <a href="Dogs_in_Mesoamerica" title="wikilink">dog</a> was also entombed with the deceased king. Pots in the tomb were stuccoed and painted and many demonstrated a blend of Maya and Teotihuacan styles.<a href="#fn231" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref231"><sup>231</sup></a> Among the offerings was an incense-burner in the shape of an elderly underworld god, sitting on a stool made of human bones and holding a severed head in his hands.<a href="#fn232" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref232"><sup>232</sup></a> The tomb was sealed with a corbel vault, then the pyramid was built on top.<a href="#fn233" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref233"><sup>233</sup></a></p>
<p><strong>Burial 48</strong> is generally accepted as the tomb of Siyah Chan K'awil. It is located beneath Temple 33 in the North Acropolis.<a href="#fn234" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref234"><sup>234</sup></a><a href="#fn235" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref235"><sup>235</sup></a> The chamber of the tomb was cut from the bedrock and contained the remains of the king himself together with those of two adolescents who had been sacrificed in order to accompany the deceased ruler.<a href="#fn236" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref236"><sup>236</sup></a> The walls of the tomb were covered with white stucco painted with hieroglyphs that included the Long Count date equivalent to 20 March 457, probably the date of either the death or interment of the king.<a href="#fn237" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref237"><sup>237</sup></a> The king's skeleton was missing its skull, its <a href="femur" title="wikilink">femurs</a> and one of its hands while the skeletons of the sacrificial victims were intact.<a href="#fn238" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref238"><sup>238</sup></a></p>
<p><strong>Burial 85</strong> dates to the Late Preclassic and was enclosed by a platform, with a primitive corbel vault. The tomb contained a single male skeleton, which lacked a skull and its thighbones.<a href="#fn239" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref239"><sup>239</sup></a><a href="#fn240" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref240"><sup>240</sup></a> The dynastic founder of Tikal, Yax Ehb' Xook, has been linked to this tomb, which lies deep in the heart of the North Acropolis.<a href="#fn241" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref241"><sup>241</sup></a> The deceased had probably died in battle with his body being mutilated by his enemies before being recovered and interred by his followers. The bones were wrapped carefully in textiles to form an upright bundle.<a href="#fn242" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref242"><sup>242</sup></a> The missing head was replaced by a small <a href="greenstone" class="uri" title="wikilink">greenstone</a> mask with shell-inlaid teeth and eyes and bearing a three-pointed royal headband.<a href="#fn243" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref243"><sup>243</sup></a><a href="#fn244" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref244"><sup>244</sup></a> This head wears an emblem of rulership on its forehead and is a rare Preclassic lowland Maya portrait of a king.<a href="#fn245" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref245"><sup>245</sup></a> Among the contents of the tomb were a <a href="stingray" class="uri" title="wikilink">stingray</a> spine, a <a href="spondylus" class="uri" title="wikilink">spondylus</a> shell and twenty-six ceramic vessels.<a href="#fn246" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref246"><sup>246</sup></a></p>
<p><strong>Burial 116</strong> is the tomb of Jasaw Chan K'awiil I. It is a large vaulted chamber deep within the pyramid, below the level of the Great Plaza. The tomb contained rich offerings of <a href="jadeite" class="uri" title="wikilink">jadeite</a>, ceramics, shell and works of art. The body of the king was covered with large quantities of <a href="jade" class="uri" title="wikilink">jade</a> ornaments including an enormous necklace with especially large beads, as depicted in sculpted portraits of the king. One of the outstanding pieces recovered from the tomb was an ornate jade <a href="mosaic" class="uri" title="wikilink">mosaic</a> vessel with the lid bearing a sculpted portrait of the king himself.<a href="#fn247" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref247"><sup>247</sup></a></p>
<p><strong>Burial 195</strong> was flooded with mud in antiquity. This flood had covered wooden objects that had completely rotted away by the time the tomb was excavated, leaving hollows in the dried mud. Archaeologists filled these hollows with stucco and thus excavated four effigies of the god <a href="K&#39;awiil" class="uri" title="wikilink">K'awiil</a>, the wooden originals long gone.<a href="#fn248" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref248"><sup>248</sup></a><a href="#fn249" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref249"><sup>249</sup></a></p>
<p><strong>Burial 196</strong> is a Late Classic royal tomb that contained a jade mosaic vessel topped with the head of the Maize God.<a href="#fn250" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref250"><sup>250</sup></a></p>
