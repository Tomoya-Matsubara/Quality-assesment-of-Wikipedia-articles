<p><strong>Otto Everett Graham, Jr.</strong> (December 6, 1921 – December 17, 2003) was an <a href="American_football" title="wikilink">American football</a> quarterback who played for the <a href="Cleveland_Browns" title="wikilink">Cleveland Browns</a> in the <a href="All-America_Football_Conference" title="wikilink">All-America Football Conference</a> and <a href="National_Football_League" title="wikilink">National Football League</a>. Graham is remembered as one of the most dominant players of his era, having taken the Browns to league championship games every year between 1946 and 1955, winning seven of them. While most of Graham's statistical records have been surpassed in the modern era, he still holds the NFL record for career average yards per pass attempt, with nine. With Graham under center, the Browns posted a record of 114&lt;U+2013&gt;20&lt;U+2013&gt;4, including a 9&lt;U+2013&gt;3 mark in the playoffs. Long-time <a href="New_York_Yankees" title="wikilink">New York Yankees</a> owner <a href="George_Steinbrenner" title="wikilink">George Steinbrenner</a>, a friend of Graham's, once called him &quot;as great of a quarterback as there ever was.&quot;<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>Graham grew up in <a href="Waukegan,_Illinois" title="wikilink">Waukegan, Illinois</a>, the son of music teachers. He entered <a href="Northwestern_University" title="wikilink">Northwestern University</a> in 1940 on a basketball scholarship, but football soon became his main sport. After a brief stint in the military at the end of <a href="World_War_II" title="wikilink">World War II</a>, Graham played during the 1946 season for the <a href="National_Basketball_League_(United_States)" title="wikilink">National Basketball League's</a> <a href="Sacramento_Kings" title="wikilink">Rochester Royals</a>, who won the league championship that year. <a href="Paul_Brown" title="wikilink">Paul Brown</a>, Cleveland's coach, signed &quot;Automatic Otto&quot; to play for the Browns, where he thrived. After he left football in 1955, Graham coached college teams in the <a href="College_All-Star_Game" title="wikilink">College All-Star Game</a> and became head football coach at the <a href="Coast_Guard_Academy" title="wikilink">Coast Guard Academy</a> in <a href="Connecticut" class="uri" title="wikilink">Connecticut</a>. After seven years at the academy, he spent three unsuccessful seasons as head coach of the <a href="Washington_Redskins" title="wikilink">Washington Redskins</a>. Following his resignation, he returned to the Coast Guard Academy, where he served as athletic director until his retirement in 1984. He was elected to the <a href="Pro_Football_Hall_of_Fame" title="wikilink">Pro Football Hall of Fame</a> in 1965.</p>
<h2 id="early-life-and-college-career">Early life and college career</h2>
<p>Born in <a href="Waukegan,_Illinois" title="wikilink">Waukegan, Illinois</a>, Graham's first interest growing up was music. Encouraged by his parents, both of whom were music teachers, he took up several instruments: the piano, violin, <a href="cornet" class="uri" title="wikilink">cornet</a> and <a href="French_horn" title="wikilink">French horn</a>. Graham also excelled in athletics, and went to <a href="Northwestern_University" title="wikilink">Northwestern University</a> on a basketball scholarship. There he played on the varsity team as a freshman and continued to study music. Graham did not take up football until his sophomore year, when Northwestern coach <a href="Pappy_Waldorf" title="wikilink">Pappy Waldorf</a> saw him throwing in an intramural fraternity game and invited him to practice with the team. Northwestern's coaches were impressed with his running and passing, and Waldorf convinced him to sign up. While football became Graham's primary sport, he also played baseball and continued on the basketball team. He was a first-tem All-American in basketball as a senior.</p>
<p>Graham's first game for the <a href="Northwestern_Wildcats_football" title="wikilink">Wildcats football team</a> was on October 4, 1941, when he ran back a <a href="Kansas_State_University" title="wikilink">Kansas State</a> punt 94 yards for a touchdown and had two more scores in a 51&lt;U+2013&gt;3 rout. After scoring another pair of touchdowns in a win against <a href="University_of_Wisconsin-Madison" title="wikilink">Wisconsin</a>, Graham threw for two touchdowns in an upset of an <a href="Ohio_State_University" title="wikilink">Ohio State</a> team coached by <a href="Paul_Brown" title="wikilink">Paul Brown</a>, handing the school its only loss of the 1941 season. Northwestern ended the year with a 11th-place showing in the <a href="AP_Poll" title="wikilink">AP Poll</a> of the best college teams in the country.</p>
<p>As America's involvement in <a href="World_War_II" title="wikilink">World War II</a> intensified after the December 7, 1941 <a href="attack_on_Pearl_Harbor" title="wikilink">attack on Pearl Harbor</a>, Graham signed up for the service alongside many fellow student-athletes, entering the <a href="U.S._Navy_Air_Corps" title="wikilink">U.S. Navy Air Corps</a>. He was able to stay at Northwestern as he waited to be called for active duty. But the Wildcats struggled in 1942, winning only one game as players joined the war effort. Graham still set a <a href="Big_Ten_Conference" title="wikilink">Big Ten Conference</a> single-season passing record that year with 89 completions.</p>
<p>The following year, Graham and many of his teammates moved to the <a href="Naval_Air_Station_Glenview" title="wikilink">Naval Air Station Glenview</a> in <a href="Glenview,_Cook_County,_Illinois" title="wikilink">Glenview, Illinois</a> but continued to play for Northwestern along with enlistees from other schools. The 1943 season was a strong one for Northwestern. The team beat Ohio State, the defending national champions, and a good military team at <a href="Naval_Station_Great_Lakes" title="wikilink">Great Lakes Naval Station</a>. The Wildcats later lost to <a href="University_of_Notre_Dame" title="wikilink">Notre Dame</a> and <a href="Michigan_State_University" title="wikilink">Michigan</a>, however, and finished the season with an 8&lt;U+2013&gt;2 record and a ninth-place ranking in the AP Poll. Graham set another Big Ten passing record, was named conference MVP, received All-American honors and finished third in <a href="Heisman_Trophy" title="wikilink">Heisman Trophy</a> voting. By the end of his college career, he held a <a href="Big_Ten_Conference" title="wikilink">Big Ten Conference</a> record for passing yards with 2,132.</p>
<p>Impressed by Graham's performances in Northwestern's wins over Ohio State in 1941 and 1943, Paul Brown came and offered him a contract worth $7,500 per year and a monthly stipend of $250 until the end of the war to play for a professional team he was coaching in <a href="Cleveland" class="uri" title="wikilink">Cleveland</a> in the new <a href="All-America_Football_Conference" title="wikilink">All-America Football Conference</a> (AAFC). The stipend was a large amount of money at the time. &quot;All I asked was, where do I sign?&quot; Graham said later. &quot;Some of the other navy men said I was rooting for the war to last forever.&quot; Graham was also drafted by the <a href="National_Football_League" title="wikilink">National Football League</a>'s <a href="Detroit_Lions" title="wikilink">Detroit Lions</a>, but he did not sign a contract or play a game with the team as the war wore on.</p>
<p>Graham's career at Northwestern officially ended in February of 1944, when he moved to <a href="Colgate_University" title="wikilink">Colgate University</a> in <a href="Hamilton_(village),_New_York" title="wikilink">Hamilton, New York</a> as a trainee in the Navy's V-5 cadet program.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a><a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> He played basketball for Colgate before moving to North Carolina Pre-Flight later in 1944, where he played on the <a href="North_Carolina_Pre-Flight_Cloudbusters_football" title="wikilink">Cloudbusters football team</a> under coaches <a href="Glenn_Killinger" title="wikilink">Glenn Killinger</a> and <a href="Bear_Bryant" title="wikilink">Bear Bryant</a>.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>The war, however, did not last forever, and droves of athletes streamed home as the conflict wound down in Europe with <a href="German_Instrument_of_Surrender" title="wikilink">Germany's surrender</a> in the summer of 1945. The AAFC's first season was not set to start until the fall of 1946, and Graham occupied the intervening months by joining the <a href="Rochester_Royals" title="wikilink">Rochester Royals</a> of the <a href="National_Basketball_League_(United_States)" title="wikilink">National Basketball League</a> (NBL), a forerunner of the <a href="National_Basketball_Association" title="wikilink">National Basketball Association</a>. In March of 1946, the Royals swept a best-of-five series against the <a href="Sheboygan_Redskins" title="wikilink">Sheboygan Redskins</a> to win the NBL title.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="aafc-and-nfl-career">AAFC and NFL career</h2>
<p>By the time Graham was discharged from the Navy late in the summer of 1946, training camp for Brown's new team, the <a href="Cleveland_Browns" title="wikilink">Cleveland Browns</a>, had already begun. Concerned that Graham was not ready to start, Brown put in <a href="Cliff_Lewis" title="wikilink">Cliff Lewis</a> at quarterback in the first game of the season. Graham, however, soon replaced him, and he thrived as part of Brown's <a href="T_formation" title="wikilink">T formation</a> offense. Throwing to ends <a href="Dante_Lavelli" title="wikilink">Dante Lavelli</a> and <a href="Mac_Speedie" title="wikilink">Mac Speedie</a>, Graham led the team to a 12&lt;U+2013&gt;2 regular-season record and a spot in the championship game against the <a href="New_York_Yankees_(AAFC)" title="wikilink">AAFC's New York Yankees</a>. The Browns won that game, touching off a period of dominance. The team won each of the AAFC's four championships between 1946 and 1949, and had professional football's first perfect season in 1948.</p>
<p>Graham's play was crucial to Cleveland's success. He averaged 10.5 yards per pass and had a <a href="quarterback_rating" title="wikilink">quarterback rating</a> of 112.1 in 1946, a professional football record until <a href="Joe_Montana" title="wikilink">Joe Montana</a> surpassed it in 1989. Graham was the AAFC's MVP in 1947 and was co-MVP in 1948. He led the league in passing between 1947 and 1949. The AAFC dissolved after the 1949 season, and three of its teams, including the Browns, merged into the more established <a href="National_Football_League" title="wikilink">National Football League</a>. Graham was the AAFC's all-time leading passer, throwing for 10,085 yards and 86 touchdowns.</p>

</figure>
<p>Graham became the team's uncontested leader, but he was also &quot;just one of the guys,&quot; tackle <a href="Mike_McCormack_(American_football)" title="wikilink">Mike McCormack</a> later said. &quot;He was not aloof, which you see a lot of times today.&quot; He was good at spinning and moving in the <a href="Passing_pocket" title="wikilink">pocket</a>, skills he learned playing basketball. In his autobiography, Paul Brown praised Graham's ability to anticipate his receivers' route-running by watching their shoulders. &quot;I remember his tremendous peripheral vision and his great athletic skill, as well as his ability to throw a football far and accurately with just a flick of his arm,&quot; Brown said. Brown remembered a Northwestern game against Ohio State in which he ran to his left and flung a pass all the way to his right for a touchdown. His short passes were hard and accurate, teammates later said, and his long balls were soft. &quot;I used to catch a lot of them one-handed,&quot; Lavelli said. &quot;He had great touch in his hands.&quot; He was nicknamed &quot;Automatic Otto&quot; for his consistency and toughness.</p>
<p>With Graham at the helm, the Browns continued to succeed when they joined the NFL in 1950. The team put to rest doubts about its prowess; some observers thought the Browns were merely a good team in a weak AAFC. Graham led the Browns to a 10&lt;U+2013&gt;2 record, which set up a playoff against the <a href="New_York_Giants" title="wikilink">New York Giants</a> for a spot in the championship game. The Browns' only two losses of the season had come against the Giants, but in a frozen <a href="Cleveland_Stadium" title="wikilink">Cleveland Stadium</a> on December 17, Cleveland turned the tables. With game tied 3&lt;U+2013&gt;3 in the fourth quarter, Graham gained 45 yards rushing on a long drive to set up a 28-yard <a href="Lou_Groza" title="wikilink">Lou Groza</a> field goal. The Browns cemented the 8&lt;U+2013&gt;3 win with a safety after the ensuing kickoff.</p>
<p>The win against the Giants put Cleveland in the NFL championship game against the <a href="Los_Angeles_Rams" title="wikilink">Los Angeles Rams</a>. Graham's rushing and passing were again key to the Browns' 30&lt;U+2013&gt;28 victory. He drove the offense downfield as time expired to set up a last-minute Groza field goal that sealed the win. Graham had 99 yards rushing in the game, adding 298 yards of passing and four touchdowns.</p>
<p>Cleveland posted a 11&lt;U+2013&gt;1 record in 1951, losing its only game to the <a href="San_Francisco_49ers" title="wikilink">San Francisco 49ers</a> in the season opener. That gave the Browns another spot in the championship game, again against the Rams. This time, however, the Rams won 27&lt;U+2013&gt;17. Graham fumbled the ball in the third quarter, setting up a Rams touchdown that put them ahead 14&lt;U+2013&gt;10. He also threw three interceptions, but otherwise put up respectable numbers, with 280 yards of passing and a touchdown. After the season, Graham was named the league's MVP.</p>
<p>Cliff Lewis, Graham's longtime backup, retired before the 1952 season, and Paul Brown began to consider the team's future after Graham. Graham by then was 30 years old and still had a few good years left, but Brown brought in <a href="George_Ratterman" title="wikilink">George Ratterman</a> as his backup. With Graham behind center, Cleveland finished the 1952 season with a 9&lt;U+2013&gt;3 record and faced the <a href="Detroit_Lions" title="wikilink">Detroit Lions</a> in the championship game. It was a frustrating contest for Graham and the Browns; despite registering 384 total yards to Detroit's 258, the team lost its second straight championship, 17&lt;U+2013&gt;7. The Browns had several long drives that ended with missed field goals, and a fourth-quarter touchdown was negated because Graham's throw to <a href="Pete_Brewster" title="wikilink">Pete Brewster</a> was first tipped by receiver <a href="Ray_Renfro" title="wikilink">Ray Renfro</a>; under rules in place at the time, balls deflected by offensive teammates were automatic incompletions. The pain of losing a second straight championship, however, paled in comparison to the misfortune that befell Graham on January 2, 1953. While Graham was practicing for the <a href="Pro_Bowl" title="wikilink">Pro Bowl</a> in Los Angeles, his six-week-old son Stephen died from a severe cold.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>

</figure>
<p>The 1953 season began with a 27&lt;U+2013&gt;0 shutout of the <a href="Green_Bay_Packers" title="wikilink">Green Bay Packers</a> in which Graham passed for 292 yards and ran for two touchdowns. It was the first of 11 straight victories for the Browns, whose only loss came in the final game of the season at the hands of the <a href="Philadelphia_Eagles" title="wikilink">Philadelphia Eagles</a>. Near the end of the season in a game against the 49ers, Graham took a forearm to the face from <a href="Art_Michalik" title="wikilink">Art Michalik</a> that opened a gash on his chin requiring 15 stitches. Graham's helmet was fitted with a clear plastic face mask, and he came back into the game; the injury helped inspire the development of the modern face mask, which was soon made mandatory. Despite an 11&lt;U+2013&gt;1 record, Cleveland lost in the championship game for the third straight year, falling to the Detroit Lions 17&lt;U+2013&gt;16. Graham threw a couple of interceptions and was not his usual self. He said after the game that he wanted to &quot;jump off a building&quot; for letting his teammates down. &quot;I was the main factor in losing,&quot; he said. &quot;If I had played my usual game, we would have won.&quot; Still, Graham finished the season as the NFL's leading passer and again won the MVP award.</p>
<p>Before the start of the Browns' 1954 training camp, Graham was questioned as part of the infamous <a href="Sam_Sheppard" title="wikilink">Sam Sheppard</a> murder case. Sheppard, an <a href="osteopath" class="uri" title="wikilink">osteopath</a>, was accused of bludgeoning his pregnant wife to death, and Graham and his wife, Beverly, were friends with the couple. Graham told police that while he and Beverly liked the Sheppards, they did not know much about their relationship.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p>The 1954 season was a transitional one for the Browns. Many of the players who joined the 1946 team had retired or were nearing the end of their careers. Graham, meanwhile, told Brown that he would retire after the season. Yet despite all the change, the 1954 season was another strong one for Graham and the Browns. After losing the first three games, Cleveland won eight in a row and earned another shot at the championship, again against the Lions. This time, the score was not close. The Browns won 56&lt;U+2013&gt;10 as Graham ran for three touchdowns and passed for three more. He announced his retirement after the game.</p>
<p>After Graham's potential heirs struggled during the 1955 training camp and preseason, Brown convinced Graham to come back and play one more year. He was offered a salary of $25,000, making him the highest-paid player in the NFL. The Browns lost the opener against the <a href="Washington_Redskins" title="wikilink">Washington Redskins</a>, but went on to a 10&lt;U+2013&gt;2 regular-season record and yet another chance at a championship. Graham threw two touchdowns and ran for two more as the Browns beat the Rams 38&lt;U+2013&gt;14. When Brown pulled Graham near the end of the game, the crowd in the <a href="Los_Angeles_Coliseum" title="wikilink">Los Angeles Coliseum</a> gave him a standing ovation. It was the final performance of a 10-year career in which Graham's team reached the championship each year and won seven. &quot;Nothing would induce me to come back,&quot; he said later. He was the NFL's passing leader and MVP in 1955. He also won the <a href="Hickok_Belt" title="wikilink">Hickok Belt</a>, awarded to the best professional athlete of the year.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> Without Graham, the Browns floundered the following year and posted a 5&lt;U+2013&gt;7 record, their first-ever losing season.</p>
<p>Graham's record as a starter was 114&lt;U+2013&gt;20&lt;U+2013&gt;4, including a 9&lt;U+2013&gt;3 mark in the playoffs. He still holds the NFL career record for yards per pass attempt, averaging nine.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> Graham was inducted into the <a href="Pro_Football_Hall_of_Fame" title="wikilink">Pro Football Hall of Fame</a> in 1965.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> Having won seven championships in 10 seasons and reached the championship game in every year he played, Graham is widely regarded as one of the greatest winners of all time and one of the best professional quarterbacks ever to play the game.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a><a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a><a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> He never missed a game in his career.</p>
<p>Graham wore number 60 to for much of his career, but he was forced to change it to 14 in 1952 after the NFL passed a rule requiring <a href="offensive_line" title="wikilink">offensive linemen</a> to wear jersey numbers 50-79 so referees could more easily identify <a href="eligible_receiver" title="wikilink">ineligible receivers</a>.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> The Browns retired his number 14, while 60 remains in circulation.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> While at Northwestern, Graham wore number 48.</p>
<h2 id="coaching-career">Coaching career</h2>
<p>When Graham retired from football, he said he was going to focus on managing insurance and appliance businesses he owned.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> In 1957, however, Graham signed on as an assistant coach for the college squad in the annual <a href="College_All-Star_Game" title="wikilink">College All-Star Game</a>, a now-defunct contest between the NFL champion and a selection of the best collegiate players.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> The next year, he was named head coach of the team.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> With Graham at the helm in 1958, the all-stars beat the Detroit Lions 35&lt;U+2013&gt;19.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a></p>
