<h3 id="background">Background</h3>
<p>Allen was born with a deformed left arm, actually caused by the effects of an Innocence, and abandoned by his parents. He later worked at a circus and met <a href="List_of_D.Gray-man_characters#Mana_Walker" title="wikilink">Mana Walker</a>, a clown. Mana adopted Allen the day his contract with the circus expired, December 25.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a><a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> When Mana died, Allen attempted to resurrect him through the <a href="List_of_D.Gray-man_characters#Millennium_Earl" title="wikilink">Millennium Earl</a>'s offer, instead turning Mana into an akuma. The resurrected Mana was ordered to kill Allen, slicing him through the left eye. Allen's deformed left arm awakened as an anti-akuma weapon, destroying Mana, and his left eye became cursed, allowing him to see the souls of akuma. As a result of this experience, Allen's hair became white. Shortly after, <a href="Exorcist" class="uri" title="wikilink">Exorcist</a> General <a href="List_of_D.Gray-man_characters#Cross_Marian" title="wikilink">Cross Marian</a> offered to take Allen as a disciple and train him as an Exorcist.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> Allen trained under Cross until the General decided to send him to the Black Order headquarters in Great Britain.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> At an unknown time, <a href="List_of_D.Gray-man_characters#The_14th" title="wikilink">the 14th</a>, a traitor member of the Noah Family and Mana's younger brother, implanted his memories into Allen.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="personality">Personality</h3>
<p>Allen is a friendly and kind-hearted person. Because he can see the souls of the akuma, he decided to live and fight for their souls. Eventually, he realizes that human souls also need salvation and learns the importance of his friends and comrades. He then devotes himself equally to both causes.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> Because he wishes to save humanity, he is at odds with fellow Exorcist <a href="List_of_D.Gray-man_characters#Yu_Kanda" title="wikilink">Yu Kanda</a>, who tells him that Exorcists are not saviors.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> Allen is loyal to his friends and comrades and protects them at any cost.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a><a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> <img src="AllenWalkerCrownedClown.jpg" title="fig:|Allen&#39;s Crowned Clown form" alt="|Allen&#39;s Crowned Clown form" width="200" /> He loves his adoptive father Mana Walker and is greatly influenced by him, so much so that he is said to be wearing a &quot;mask of Mana&quot;.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> Allen promised Mana to keep moving forward on the path he chose for himself and to never give up.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> Because of this promise, Allen remains optimistic regardless of the situation.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> Allen is also well-mannered and always speaks formally, just as Mana had done.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> As the series progresses, he begins to speak in a more informal tone.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="abilities">Abilities</h3>
<p>Allen is one of the rare parasite-type Exorcists and controls Innocence with his body.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> When his anti-akuma weapon is not invoked, it appears as his deformed left arm; however, his arm is actually composed of a different cellular structure than the rest of his body.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> The weapon goes through two forms before reaching its true form. Originally, it appears as a giant claw with great strength and swiftness.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> It later &quot;evolves&quot; into a gun-like structure, allowing him to shoot beam-like objects.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> Its final form, the , takes the form of a type of fur cape and a claw-like hand.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> In the Crown Clown's true form, Allen's left arm no longer appears deformed.

<p>Shortly after Allen resurrected Mana as an akuma, Mana sliced through the boy's left eye, granting him the ability to see the souls of akuma, allowing him to detect a disguised akuma.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> His eye later &quot;evolves&quot;, allowing him to extend his akuma detecting abilities to others.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> His eye is also able to detect akuma within a range of ; objects no longer impede his detecting abilites.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> Allen is also able to control Noah's Ark.
