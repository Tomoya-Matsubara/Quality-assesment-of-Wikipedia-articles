<p><strong><em>Halloween</em></strong> is a <a href="2007_in_film" title="wikilink">2007</a> <a href="Remake#Reimagining" title="wikilink">remake</a> of the 1978 <a href="slasher_film" title="wikilink">slasher</a> <a href="Halloween_(1978_film)" title="wikilink">film of the same name</a>. The film was written, produced, and directed by <a href="Rob_Zombie" title="wikilink">Rob Zombie</a>. The film stars <a href="Malcolm_McDowell" title="wikilink">Malcolm McDowell</a> as <a href="Samuel_J._Loomis" title="wikilink">Dr. Sam Loomis</a>, <a href="Tyler_Mane" title="wikilink">Tyler Mane</a> as the adult <a href="Michael_Myers_(Halloween)" title="wikilink">Michael Myers</a>, and <a href="Scout_Taylor-Compton" title="wikilink">Scout Taylor-Compton</a> as <a href="Laurie_Strode" title="wikilink">Laurie Strode</a>; <a href="Daeg_Faerch" title="wikilink">Daeg Faerch</a> portrays a ten year old Michael Myers. Rob Zombie's &quot;reimagining&quot; follows the premise of <a href="John_Carpenter" title="wikilink">John Carpenter</a>'s original, with Michael Myers stalking Laurie Strode and her friends on Halloween night. Zombie's film goes deeper into the character's psyche, trying to answer the question of what drove him to kill people, whereas in Carpenter's original film Michael did not have an explicit reason for killing.</p>
<p>Working from Carpenter's advice to &quot;make [the film] his own&quot;,<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> Zombie chose to develop the film as both a prequel and a remake, allowing for more original content than simply refilming the same scenes. Despite mostly negative reviews, the film, which cost $15 million to make,<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> went on to gross $78.5 million worldwide.</p>
<h2 id="plot">Plot</h2>
<p>On <a href="Halloween" class="uri" title="wikilink">Halloween</a> in <a href="Haddonfield,_Illinois" title="wikilink">Haddonfield, Illinois</a>, having already shown signs of <a href="Psychopathy" title="wikilink">psychopathic tendencies</a>, ten year old <a href="Michael_Myers_(Halloween)" title="wikilink">Michael Myers</a> (<a href="Daeg_Faerch" title="wikilink">Daeg Faerch</a>) murders his sister <a href="Judith_Myers" title="wikilink">Judith</a> (<a href="Hanna_R._Hall" title="wikilink">Hanna R.

After the longest trial in the state&lt;U+2019&gt;s history, Michael is found guilty of <a href="first_degree_murder" title="wikilink">first degree murder</a> and sent to <a href="Smith&#39;s_Grove_-_Warren_County_Sanitarium" title="wikilink">Smith's Grove Sanitarium</a> under the care of <a href="child_psychologist" title="wikilink">child psychologist</a> <a href="Samuel_J._Loomis" title="wikilink">Dr. Sam Loomis</a> (<a href="Malcolm_McDowell" title="wikilink">Malcolm McDowell</a>). Michael initially cooperates with Dr. Loomis, claiming no memory of the killings; his mother, <a href="List_of_characters_in_the_Halloween_series#Donald_Myers_&amp;_Edith_Myers_(Deborah_Myers)" title="wikilink">Deborah</a> (<a href="Sheri_Moon_Zombie" title="wikilink">Sheri Moon Zombie</a>), visits him regularly. After a year, Michael becomes fixated on his <a href="papier-m&lt;U+00E2&gt;ch&lt;U+00E9&gt;" class="uri" title="wikilink">papier-m&lt;U+00E2&gt;ch&lt;U+00E9&gt;</a> masks, closing himself off from everyone, even his mother. When Michael kills a nurse (<a href="Sybil_Danning" title="wikilink">Sybil Danning</a>) during one of her visits, Deborah can no longer handle the situation and commits <a href="suicide" class="uri" title="wikilink">suicide</a>. For the next fifteen years, Michael (<a href="Tyler_Mane" title="wikilink">Tyler Mane</a>) continues making his masks and not speaking to anyone. Dr. Loomis, having continued to treat Michael over the years, attempts to move on with his life and closes Michael&lt;U+2019&gt;s case. Later, while being prepared for transfer to maximum security, Michael escapes Smith&lt;U+2019&gt;s Grove, killing the sanitarium guards and a truck driver (<a href="Ken_Foree" title="wikilink">Ken Foree</a>) for his clothes, and heads to Haddonfield. On Halloween, Michael arrives at his old home, now abandoned, and finds a kitchen knife and Halloween mask he stored under the floorboards the night he killed his sister.</p>
<p>The story shifts to <a href="Laurie_Strode" title="wikilink">Laurie Strode</a> (<a href="Scout_Taylor-Compton" title="wikilink">Scout Taylor-Compton</a>), and her friends <a href="Annie_Brackett" title="wikilink">Annie Brackett</a> (<a href="Danielle_Harris" title="wikilink">Danielle Harris</a>) and <a href="Lynda_Van_Der_Klok" title="wikilink">Lynda Van Der Klok</a> (<a href="Kristina_Klebe" title="wikilink">Kristina Klebe</a>) on Halloween. Throughout the day, Laurie witnesses Michael watching her from a distance. That night, she heads to the Doyle residence to watch their son <a href="Tommy_Doyle" title="wikilink">Tommy</a> (<a href="Skyler_Gisondo" title="wikilink">Skyler Gisondo</a>). Meanwhile, Lynda meets with her boyfriend <a href="List_of_characters_in_the_Halloween_series#Bob_Simms" title="wikilink">Bob</a> (Nick Mennell) at Michael's childhood home. Michael appears, murders them, and then heads to the Strode home, where he murders <a href="List_of_characters_in_the_Halloween_series#Morgan_&amp;_Pamela_Strode" title="wikilink">Laurie's parents</a>. Having been alerted to Michael's escape, Dr. Loomis comes to Haddonfield looking for Michael. After obtaining a handgun, Loomis attempts to warn <a href="List_of_characters_in_the_Halloween_series#Sheriff_Leigh_Brackett" title="wikilink">Sheriff Brackett</a> (<a href="Brad_Dourif" title="wikilink">Brad Dourif</a>) that Michael has returned to Haddonfield. Brackett and Dr. Loomis head to the Strode home, with Brackett explaining along the way that Laurie is actually Michael Myers' baby sister.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Annie convinces Laurie to babysit <a href="Lindsey_Wallace" title="wikilink">Lindsey Wallace</a> (Jenny Gregg Stewart), a girl Annie is supposed to be watching, long enough so she can have sex with her boyfriend <a href="List_of_characters_in_the_Halloween_series#Paul_Freedman" title="wikilink">Paul</a> (<a href="Max_Van_Ville" title="wikilink">Max Van Ville</a>). Annie and Paul return to the Wallace home; during sex, Michael kills Paul and attacks Annie. Bringing Lindsey home, Laurie finds Annie on the floor, bloodied but alive, and calls 911. She is attacked by Michael, who chases her back to the Doyle home. Sheriff Brackett and Loomis hear the 911 call and head to the Wallace residence. Michael kidnaps Laurie, and takes her back to his home. Michael approaches Laurie and tries to show her that she is his younger sister. Unable to understand, Laurie grabs Michael's knife and stabs him before escaping the house; Michael chases her, but is repeatedly shot by Dr. Loomis. Laurie and Loomis are just about to leave when Michael grabs Laurie and heads back to the house. Loomis intervenes, but Michael attacks him by squeezing Loomis's skull with his hands. Laurie takes Loomis' gun and runs upstairs; she is chased by Michael, who, after cornering her on a balcony, charges her head-on and knocks both of them over the railing. Laurie finds herself on top of a bleeding Michael. Aiming Loomis' gun at his face, she repeatedly pulls the trigger until the gun finally goes off just as Michael's hand grips Laurie's wrist.</p>

<h3 id="development">Development</h3>
<p>On June 4, 2006, <a href="Dimension_Films" title="wikilink">Dimension</a> announced that <a href="Rob_Zombie" title="wikilink">Rob Zombie</a>, director of <em><a href="House_of_1000_Corpses" title="wikilink">House of 1000 Corpses</a></em> and <em><a href="The_Devil&#39;s_Rejects" title="wikilink">The Devil's Rejects</a></em>, would be creating the next installment in the <em>Halloween</em> franchise.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> The plan was for Zombie to hold many positions in the production; he would write, direct, produce, and serve as music supervisor.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> Bob Weinstein approached him about making the film, and Zombie, who was a fan of the original <em><a href="Halloween_(1978_film)" title="wikilink">Halloween</a></em>, and friend of <a href="John_Carpenter" title="wikilink">John Carpenter</a>, jumped at the chance to make a <em>Halloween</em> film for Dimension Studios.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> Before Dimension went public with the news, Zombie felt obligated to inform John Carpenter, out of respect, of the plans to remake his film.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> Carpenter's request was for Zombie to &quot;make it his own&quot;.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> During a June 16, 2006 interview, Zombie announced that his film would combine the elements of prequel and remake with the original concept. He insisted that there would be considerable original content in the new film, as opposed to mere rehashed material.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> The <a href="BBC" class="uri" title="wikilink">BBC</a> reported that the new film would disregard the numerous sequels that followed <em>Halloween</em>.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<p>His intention is to reinvent Michael Myers, because, in his opinion, the character, along with <a href="Freddy_Krueger" title="wikilink">Freddy Krueger</a>, <a href="Jason_Voorhees" title="wikilink">Jason Voorhees</a>, and <a href="Pinhead_(Hellraiser)" title="wikilink">Pinhead</a>, has become more familiar to audiences, and as a result, less scary.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a><a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> The idea behind the new film was to delve deeper into Michael Myers' <a href="back_story" title="wikilink">back story</a>. A deeper back story would add &quot;new life&quot; to the character, as Zombie put it.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> Michael's mask will be given its own story, to provide an explanation as to why he wears it, instead of having the character simply steal a random mask from a hardware store, as in the original film.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> Zombie explained that he wanted Michael to be truer to what a <a href="psychopath" class="uri" title="wikilink">psychopath</a> really is, and wanted the mask to be a way for Michael to hide. He wants the young Michael to have <a href="charisma" class="uri" title="wikilink">charisma</a>, which would be projected onto the adult Michael. Zombie has decided that Michael's motives for returning to Haddonfield should be more ambiguous. As Zombie explains, &quot;was he trying to kill Laurie, or just find her because he loves her?&quot;<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<p>Moreover, Michael would not be able to drive in the new film, unlike his 1978 counterpart who stole Loomis' car so that he could drive back to Haddonfield.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> Zombie also wants the Dr. Loomis character to be more intertwined with that of Michael Myers; Zombie said that the character's role in the original was &quot;showing up merely to say something dramatic&quot;.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> Although Zombie has added more history to the Michael Myers character, hence creating more original content for the film, he chose to keep the character's trademark mask and Carpenter's theme song intact for his version (despite an apparent misinterpretation in an interview suggesting the theme would be ditched).<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> Production officially began on January 29 2007.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> Shortly before production began, Zombie reported that he had seen the first production of Michael's signature mask. Zombie commented, &quot;It looks perfect, exactly like the original. Not since 1978 has The Shape looked so good&quot;.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> Filming occurred in the same neighborhood that Carpenter used for the original <em>Halloween</em>.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="casting">Casting</h3>
<p>On December 19, 2006, Zombie mailed <em>Bloody-Disgusting</em> in which he announced that Deag Faerch would play the part of ten year old Michael Myers.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> On December 22, 2006, <a href="Malcolm_McDowell" title="wikilink">Malcolm McDowell</a> was officially announced to be playing Dr. Loomis.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> McDowell stated that he wanted a tremendous ego in Loomis, who is out to get a new book from the ordeal.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> On December 24, 2006, Zombie announced that <a href="Tyler_Mane" title="wikilink">Tyler Mane</a>, who had previously worked with Zombie on <em><a href="The_Devils_Rejects" title="wikilink">The Devils Rejects</a></em>, would portray the adult Michael Myers.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> Mane stated that it was very difficult to act only with his eyes.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> <a href="Scout_Taylor-Compton" title="wikilink">Scout Taylor-Compton</a> endured a long audition process, but as director Zombie explains, &quot;Scout was my first choice. There was just something about her; she had a genuine quality. She didn't seem actor-y.&quot;<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> She was one of the final people to be cast for a lead role after Faerch, Mane, McDowell, Forsythe and Harris.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> A contest was held for a walk on role in the next <em>Halloween</em> film, at the time called <em>Halloween 9</em>; it was won by Heather Bowen.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="release">Release</h2>
<p>Approximately four days before the theatrical release of the film, a <a href="workprint" class="uri" title="wikilink">workprint</a> version of the film appeared online and was circulated around various <a href="BitTorrent_(protocol)" title="wikilink">BitTorrent</a> sites. Upon hearing of the leaked copy, Zombie stated that whatever version had been leaked was an older version of the film, unlike what was about to be released in theaters.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> The leak of Zombie's workprint led to speculation that the film's box office success could be damaged the same way director <a href="Eli_Roth" title="wikilink">Eli Roth</a> attributed the financial failure of his film, <em><a href="Hostel:_Part_II" title="wikilink">Hostel: Part II</a></em>, to the leaking of a workprint version of that film.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> <a href="Dark_Horizons" title="wikilink">Dark Horizons</a> webmaster, Garth Franklin, notes that watching the workprint allows a viewer to see what things were changed after the test screenings in June 2007.

<p><em><a href="Daily_News_(New_York)" title="wikilink">New York Daily News</a></em> critic Jack Matthews believed the film lacked tension, and went more for cheap shocks&lt;U+2014&gt;focusing more on enhancing the &quot;imagery of violence&quot;&lt;U+2014&gt;than real attempts to scare the audience; he gave the film one and a half stars out of five.<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a> Dennis Harvey, from <em><a href="Variety_(magazine)" title="wikilink">Variety</a></em> magazine, echoed Matthew's opinion that the film failed to deliver on the suspense; he also felt that you could not tell one teenage character from the next, whereas in Carpenter's original each teenager had real personalities.<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a> In contrast, Rossiter Drake of <em>The Examiner</em> applauded Michael's backstory, feeling that it was a &quot;compelling take on the mythology&quot; that managed to be &quot;unique&quot; and &quot;shocking&quot; at the same time.<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a> In agreement with other critics, <em><a href="Empire_(magazine)" title="wikilink">Empire</a></em> magazine's <a href="Kim_Newman" title="wikilink">Kim Newman</a> felt that, because Zombie seemed less focused on the teenagers being stalked and killed by Michael, the film &quot;[fell] flat&quot; when it came to delivering suspense or anything &quot;remotely scary&quot;; Newman did praise McDowell for his portrayal of the &quot;dogged pschiatrist&quot;.<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a> Ben Walter, of <em><a href="Time_Out" title="wikilink">Time Out London</a></em>, felt Zombie added &quot;surprising realism&quot; to the development of Michael Myers&lt;U+2019&gt; psychopathic actions, but agreed with Newman that the director replaced the original film&lt;U+2019&gt;s &quot;suspense and playfulness&quot; with a convincing display of &quot;black-blooded brutality&quot;.<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a></p>
<p>Frank Scheck, of the <em>Hollywood Reporter</em>, believed that even though Zombie's remake of Carpenter's <em>Halloween</em> was better than getting another sequel in the long running franchise it still was not comparable to the 1978 original. For Scheck, Zombie replaced Carpenter's building suspense, which made it so &quot;brilliant&quot;, with graphic violence and extended scenes of nudity; he also criticized McDowell for lacking the intensity that Donald Pleasence brought to the Loomis character.<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a> By contrast, <a href="TV_Guide" title="wikilink">TV Guide</a>'s Ken Fox felt that Zombie did deliver a &quot;scary horror movie&quot;, not by copying Carpenter, but by making the film his own.
