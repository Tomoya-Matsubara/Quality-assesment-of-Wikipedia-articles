<p><strong>Michael Joseph Jackson</strong> (born August 29, 1958) is a <a href="United_States" title="wikilink">US</a> <a href="musician" class="uri" title="wikilink">musician</a> and <a href="entertainment" title="wikilink">entertainer</a>. The seventh child of the <a href="Jackson_family" title="wikilink">Jackson family</a>, he debuted on the professional music scene at the age of 11 as a member of <a href="The_Jackson_5" title="wikilink">The Jackson 5</a> and began a solo career in 1971 while still a member of the group. In the early 1980s, he became a dominant figure in <a href="popular_music" title="wikilink">popular music</a> as the first <a href="African-American" class="uri" title="wikilink">African-American</a> entertainer to amass a strong <a href="crossover_(music)" title="wikilink">crossover</a> following on <a href="MTV" class="uri" title="wikilink">MTV</a>. Referred to as the &quot;King of Pop&quot; in subsequent years, five of his solo <a href="studio_album" title="wikilink">studio albums</a> have become some of the world's best-selling records: <em><a href="Off_the_Wall_(album)" title="wikilink">Off the Wall</a></em> (1979), <em><a href="Thriller_(album)" title="wikilink">Thriller</a></em> (1982), <em><a href="Bad_(album)" title="wikilink">Bad</a></em> (1987), <em><a href="Dangerous_(album)" title="wikilink">Dangerous</a></em> (1991) and <em><a href="HIStory:_Past,_Present_and_Future,_Book_I" title="wikilink">HIStory: Past, Present and Future, Book I</a></em> (1995).</p>
<p>The popularity of his <a href="music_videos" title="wikilink">music videos</a> airing on MTV, such as &quot;<a href="Beat_It" title="wikilink">Beat It</a>&quot;, &quot;<a href="Billie_Jean" title="wikilink">Billie Jean</a>&quot; and <em><a href="Thriller_(music_video)" title="wikilink">Thriller</a></em>&lt;U+2014&gt;credited for transforming the music video into an art form and a promotional tool&lt;U+2014&gt;helped bring the relatively new channel to fame. Videos such as &quot;<a href="Black_or_White" title="wikilink">Black or White</a>&quot; and &quot;<a href="Scream/Childhood" title="wikilink">Scream</a>&quot; kept Jackson as a staple on MTV into the 1990s. With stage performances and music videos, Jackson popularized a number of physically complicated dance techniques, such as the <a href="robot_(dance)" title="wikilink">robot</a> and the <a href="moonwalk_(dance)" title="wikilink">moonwalk</a>. His distinctive musical sound and vocal style influenced numerous <a href="hip_hop" title="wikilink">hip hop</a>, <a href="pop_music" title="wikilink">pop</a> and <a href="contemporary_R&amp;B" title="wikilink">contemporary R&amp;B</a> artists.</p>
<p>Jackson has donated and raised millions of dollars for beneficial causes through his <a href="Dangerous_World_Tour" title="wikilink">Dangerous World Tour</a>, charity <a href="singles_(music)" title="wikilink">singles</a> and support of 39 charities.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> However, other aspects of his personal life&lt;U+2014&gt;including his <a href="plastic_surgery" title="wikilink">plastic surgery</a>, his lightening skin, and his eccentric behavior&lt;U+2014&gt;have generated significant controversy and have damaged his public image. He was accused of <a href="1993_child_sexual_abuse_accusations_against_Michael_Jackson" title="wikilink">child sexual abuse in 1993</a>, although the matter was settled out of court. Jackson then married twice and fathered three children, all of which caused further controversy. In 2005, Jackson was <a href="People_v._Jackson" title="wikilink">tried and later acquitted</a> of further sexual abuse allegations and several other charges. He has experienced <a href="Michael_Jackson&#39;s_health_and_appearance" title="wikilink">health concerns</a> since the early 1990s and reported financial difficulties since the late 1990s.</p>
<p>One of the few artists to have been inducted into the <a href="Rock_and_Roll_Hall_of_Fame" title="wikilink">Rock and Roll Hall of Fame</a> twice, his other achievements include multiple <em><a href="Guinness_World_Records" title="wikilink">Guinness World Records</a></em>&lt;U+2014&gt;including one for <em>Thriller</em> as the <a href="List_of_best-selling_albums_worldwide" title="wikilink">world's best-selling album</a>&lt;U+2014&gt;13 <a href="Grammy_Award" title="wikilink">Grammy Awards</a>, 13 <a href="List_of_artists_who_reached_number_one_on_the_Hot_100_(U.S.)#J" title="wikilink">number one singles</a> in his solo career&lt;U+2014&gt;more than any other male artist after the creation of the <a href="Billboard_Hot_100" title="wikilink"><em>Billboard</em> Hot 100</a>&lt;U+2014&gt;and the sale of over 750 million units worldwide.

<p>Michael Joseph Jackson was born in <a href="Gary,_Indiana" title="wikilink">Gary, Indiana</a> (an industrial suburb of <a href="Chicago,_Illinois" title="wikilink">Chicago, Illinois</a>) to a working-class family on August 29, 1958.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> The son of <a href="Joseph_Jackson" title="wikilink">Joseph &quot;Joe&quot; Walter</a> and <a href="Katherine_Jackson" title="wikilink">Katherine Esther</a> (<a href="n&lt;U+00E9&gt;e" class="uri" title="wikilink">n&lt;U+00E9&gt;e</a> Scruse),<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> he is the seventh of nine children.

<p>From a young age Jackson was physically and mentally abused by his father, enduring incessant rehearsals, whippings and name-calling. Jackson's abuse as a child affected him throughout his grown life.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> In one altercation&lt;U+2014&gt;later recalled by Marlon Jackson&lt;U+2014&gt;Joseph held Michael upside down by one leg and &quot;pummelled him over and over again with his hand, hitting him on his back and buttocks&quot;.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> Joseph would often trip up, or push the male children into walls.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> One night while Jackson was asleep, Joseph climbed into his room through the bedroom window. Wearing a fright mask, he entered the room screaming and shouting. Joseph said he wanted to teach his children not to leave the window open when they went to sleep. For years afterward, Jackson suffered nightmares about being kidnapped from his bedroom.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<p>Jackson first spoke openly about his childhood abuse in a 1993 interview with <a href="Oprah_Winfrey" title="wikilink">Oprah Winfrey</a>. He said that during his childhood he often cried from loneliness and would sometimes get sick or start to <a href="regurgitate" class="uri" title="wikilink">regurgitate</a> upon seeing his father.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a><a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a><a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a><a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> In Jackson's other high profile interview, <em><a href="Living_with_Michael_Jackson" title="wikilink">Living with Michael Jackson</a></em> (2003), the singer covered his face with his hand and began crying when talking about his childhood abuse.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> Jackson recalled that Joseph sat in a chair with a belt in his hand as he and his siblings rehearsed and that &quot;[i]f you didn't do it the right way, he would tear you up, really get you.&quot;<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
<p>Jackson showed musical talent early in his life, performing in front of classmates and others during a <a href="Christmas" class="uri" title="wikilink">Christmas</a> recital at the age of five.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> In 1964, Jackson and Marlon joined the Jackson Brothers&lt;U+2014&gt;a band formed by brothers Jackie, Tito and Jermaine&lt;U+2014&gt;as backup musicians playing <a href="congas" class="uri" title="wikilink">congas</a> and <a href="tambourine" class="uri" title="wikilink">tambourine</a>, respectively. Jackson later began performing backup vocals and dancing; at the age of eight, he and Jermaine assumed lead vocals, and the group's name was changed to <a href="The_Jackson_5" title="wikilink">The Jackson 5</a>.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> The band toured <a href="Midwestern_United_States" title="wikilink">the Midwest</a> extensively from 1965 to 1967. The band frequently performed at a string of black clubs and venues collectively known as the &quot;<a href="chitlin&#39;_circuit" title="wikilink">chitlin' circuit</a>&quot;, where they often opened for <a href="striptease" title="wikilink">stripteases</a> and other adult acts. In 1966, they won a major local talent show with renditions of <a href="Motown_sound" title="wikilink">Motown</a> hits and <a href="James_Brown" title="wikilink">James Brown</a>'s &quot;<a href="I_Got_You_(I_Feel_Good)" title="wikilink">I Got You (I Feel Good)</a>&quot;, led by Michael.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a></p>
<p>The Jackson 5 recorded several songs for the local record label <a href="Steeltown_Records" title="wikilink">Steeltown</a> in 1967 and signed with <a href="Motown_Records" title="wikilink">Motown Records</a> in 1968.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> <em><a href="Rolling_Stone" title="wikilink">Rolling Stone</a></em> magazine later described the young Michael as &quot;a prodigy&quot; with &quot;overwhelming musical gifts&quot;, noting that Michael &quot;quickly emerged as the main draw and lead singer&quot; after he began to dance and sing with his brothers.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> Though Michael sang with a &quot;child's piping voice, he danced like a grown-up hoofer and sang with the R&amp;B/gospel inflections of <a href="Sam_Cooke" title="wikilink">Sam Cooke</a>, <a href="James_Brown" title="wikilink">James Brown</a>, <a href="Ray_Charles" title="wikilink">Ray Charles</a> and <a href="Stevie_Wonder" title="wikilink">Stevie Wonder</a>&quot;.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> The group set a record when its first four singles (&quot;<a href="I_Want_You_Back" title="wikilink">I Want You Back</a>&quot;, &quot;<a href="ABC_(song)" title="wikilink">ABC</a>&quot;, &quot;<a href="The_Love_You_Save" title="wikilink">The Love You Save</a>&quot; and &quot;<a href="I&#39;ll_Be_There" title="wikilink">I'll Be There</a>&quot;) charted at number one on the <a href="Billboard_Hot_100" title="wikilink"><em>Billboard</em> Hot 100</a>.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> During The Jackson 5's early years, Motown's public relations team claimed that Jackson was nine years old&lt;U+2014&gt;two years younger than he actually was&lt;U+2014&gt;to make him appear cuter and more accessible to the mainstream audience.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> Starting in 1972, Jackson released a total of four solo studio albums with Motown, among them <em><a href="Got_to_Be_There" title="wikilink">Got to Be There</a></em> and <em><a href="Ben_(album)" title="wikilink">Ben</a></em>. These were released as part of the Jackson 5 franchise, and produced successful singles such as &quot;<a href="Got_to_Be_There_(song)" title="wikilink">Got to Be There</a>&quot;, &quot;<a href="Ben_(song)" title="wikilink">Ben</a>&quot; and a remake of <a href="Bobby_Day" title="wikilink">Bobby Day</a>'s &quot;<a href="Rockin&#39;_Robin_(song)" title="wikilink">Rockin' Robin</a>&quot;. The group's sales began declining in 1973, and the band members chafed under Motown's strict refusal to allow them creative control or input.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> Although the group scored several top 40 hits, including the top 5 <a href="disco" class="uri" title="wikilink">disco</a> single &quot;<a href="Dancing_Machine" title="wikilink">Dancing Machine</a>&quot; and the top 20 hit &quot;<a href="I_Am_Love" title="wikilink">I Am Love</a>&quot;, the Jackson 5 left Motown in 1975.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a></p>

<p>The Jackson 5 signed a new contract with <a href="Columbia_Records" title="wikilink">CBS Records</a> in June 1975, joining first the Philadelphia International Records division and then <a href="Epic_Records" title="wikilink">Epic Records</a>.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> As a result of legal proceedings, the group was renamed The Jacksons.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> After the name change, the band continued to tour internationally, releasing six more albums between 1976 and 1984. From 1976 to 1984, Michael Jackson was the lead songwriter of the group, writing hits such as &quot;<a href="Shake_Your_Body_(Down_to_the_Ground)" title="wikilink">Shake Your Body (Down to the Ground)</a>&quot;, &quot;<a href="This_Place_Hotel" title="wikilink">This Place Hotel</a>&quot; and &quot;<a href="Can_You_Feel_It" title="wikilink">Can You Feel It</a>&quot;.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1978, Jackson starred as <a href="Scarecrow_(Oz)" title="wikilink">Scarecrow</a> in the film musical <em><a href="The_Wiz_(film)" title="wikilink">The Wiz</a></em>.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> The musical scores were arranged by <a href="Quincy_Jones" title="wikilink">Quincy Jones</a>, who formed a partnership with Jackson during the film's production and agreed to produce the singer's solo album <em><a href="Off_the_Wall_(album)" title="wikilink">Off the Wall</a></em>.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> In 1979, Jackson broke his nose during a complex dance routine. His subsequent <a href="rhinoplasty" class="uri" title="wikilink">rhinoplasty</a> surgery was not a complete success, and Jackson complained of breathing difficulties that would affect his career. He was referred to Dr. Steven Hoefflin, who performed Jackson's second rhinoplasty and other subsequent operations.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a></p>
<p>Jones and Jackson jointly produced <em>Off the Wall</em>, whose songwriters included Jackson, <a href="Heatwave_(band)" title="wikilink">Heatwave</a>'s <a href="Rod_Temperton" title="wikilink">Rod Temperton</a>, <a href="Stevie_Wonder" title="wikilink">Stevie Wonder</a> and <a href="Paul_McCartney" title="wikilink">Paul McCartney</a>.

<h3 id="u20131985-thriller">1982&lt;U+2013&gt;1985: <em>Thriller</em></h3>
<p>In 1982, Jackson contributed the song &quot;Someone In the Dark&quot; to the storybook for the film <em><a href="E.T._the_Extra-Terrestrial" title="wikilink">E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial</a></em>; the record won a Grammy for Best Album for Children.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> That year Jackson issued his second Epic album, <em><a href="Thriller_(album)" title="wikilink">Thriller</a></em>. <em>The New York Times</em> called him a &quot;musical phenomenon&quot;, saying that &quot;in the world of pop music, there is Michael Jackson and there is everybody else&quot;.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> The album remained in the top 10 of the <a href="Billboard_200" title="wikilink"><em>Billboard</em> 200</a> for 80 consecutive weeks there and 37 of those weeks at the peak position.

How does he do it? As a technician, he is a great illusionist, a genuine mime. His ability to keep one leg straight as he glides while the other bends and seems to walk requires perfect timing&quot;.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a></p>
<p>Jackson suffered a setback on January 27, 1984. While filming a <a href="Pepsi_Cola" title="wikilink">Pepsi Cola</a> commercial at the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles, Jackson suffered second degree burns to his scalp after pyrotechnics accidentally set his hair on fire. Happening in front of a full house of fans during a simulated concert, the incident was the subject of heavy media scrutiny and elicited an outpouring of sympathy.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a> PepsiCo settled a lawsuit out of court, and Jackson gave his $1.5 million settlement to the &quot;Michael Jackson Burn Center&quot; which was a piece of new technology to help people with severe burns.<ref name = "tara 279<U+2013>287&quot;/&gt; Jackson had his third rhinoplasty shortly afterward and grew self conscious about his appearance.<ref name = "tara 205<U+2013>210&quot;/&gt;</p>
<p>On May 14, 1984, Jackson was invited to the <a href="White_House" title="wikilink">White House</a> to receive an award presented by American President <a href="Ronald_Reagan" title="wikilink">Ronald Reagan</a>. The award was given for Jackson's support of charities that helped people overcome alcohol and drug abuse.<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a> Jackson won eight awards during the 1984 Grammys. Unlike later albums, <em>Thriller</em> did not have an official tour to promote it, but the 1984 <a href="Victory_Tour" title="wikilink">Victory Tour</a>, headlined by The Jacksons, showcased much of Jackson's new solo material to more than two million Americans.<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a> He donated his five million dollar share from the Victory Tour to charity.<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a></p>
<p>Jackson changed the way the industry functioned; as an artistic entity and a financial, profitable organisation. His attorney <a href="John_Branca" title="wikilink">John Branca</a> noted that Jackson had the highest royalty rate in the music industry at that point; approximately $2 for every album sold. He was also making record breaking profit from compact discs or the sale of <em>The Making of Michael Jackson's Thriller</em>; a documentary produced by Jackson and <a href="John_Landis" title="wikilink">John Landis</a>. Funded by MTV, the documentary sold over 350,000 copies in a few months of sale. The era saw the arrival of novelties like the Michael Jackson doll, that appeared in stores in May 1984 at a price of $12.<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a> <em>Thriller</em> retains a position in <a href="Culture_of_the_United_States" title="wikilink">American culture</a>; biographer <a href="J._Randy_Taraborrelli" title="wikilink">J.

<p>Gil Friesen, President of <a href="A&amp;M_Records" title="wikilink">A&amp;M Records</a>, said &quot;the whole industry has a stake in this success&quot;.<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a> <em>Thriller</em> raised the importance of albums, but multiple hits also changed notions about the number of singles to release.<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a> <em><a href="Time_(magazine)" title="wikilink">Time</a></em> magazine explained that &quot;the fallout from <em>Thriller</em> has given the [music] business its best years since the heady days of 1978, when it had an estimated total domestic revenue of $4.1 billion&quot;.<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a> <em>Time</em> summed up <em>Thriller</em>'s impact as a &quot;restoration of confidence&quot; for an industry bordering on &quot;the ruins of punk and the chic regions of synthesizer pop&quot;. The publication described Jackson's influence at that point as &quot;Star of records, radio, rock video. A one-man rescue team for the music business. A songwriter who sets the beat for a decade. A dancer with the fanciest feet on the street. A singer who cuts across all boundaries of taste and style and color too&quot;.<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a> According to the <em><a href="The_Washington_Post" title="wikilink">The Washington Post</a></em>, <em>Thriller</em> paved the way for other acts such as <a href="Prince_(musician)" title="wikilink">Prince</a>.<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a></p>
<p>With help from <a href="Lionel_Richie" title="wikilink">Lionel Richie</a>, Jackson co-wrote the charity single &quot;<a href="We_Are_the_World" title="wikilink">We Are the World</a>&quot;, released worldwide to aid people in Africa and the US. Jackons was one of many music celebrities who performed on the record. Released in March 1985, the single became one of the best-selling singles of all time, with nearly 20 million copies sold and millions of dollars raised for charity. It was the first time Jackson was seen as a humanitarian.<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a> The singer purchased <a href="Northern_Songs" title="wikilink">Northern Songs</a>, a music catalog holding thousands of songs.

The pair became friendly, occasionally visiting one another. In one discussion, McCartney told Jackson about the millions of dollars he had made from music catalogs; he was earning approximately $40 million a year from other peoples songs.<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a></p>
<p>Jackson began a business career buying music and shortly afterward Northern Songs was put up for sale. He was warned that he would face strong competition, excited, he skipped around the room saying, &quot;I don't care. I want those songs. Get me those songs Branca [his attorney]&quot;. Branca then contacted the attorney of McCartney, who clarified that his client was not interested in bidding because, &quot;It's too pricey&quot;. After Jackson had started negotiations, McCartney changed his mind and tried to persuade Yoko Ono to join him in a joint bid, she declined, so he pulled out. Jackson eventually beat off the rest of the competition in negotiations that lasted 10 months. When McCartney found out he said, &quot;I think it's dodgy to do things like that. To be someones friend and then buy the rug they're standing on&quot;. Reacting to that statement, biographer J. Randy Taraborrelli observed that McCartney made millions of dollars from the music of other people. He had more money than Jackson at that point so could have made a substantial bid for his own music and would not have suffered financial danger from Jackson owning the catalog.<a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a></p>

<p>With the industry expecting another major hit, Jackson's first album in five years, <em><a href="Bad_(album)" title="wikilink">Bad</a></em> (1987), was highly anticipated.<a href="#fn77" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref77"><sup>77</sup></a> <em>Bad</em> had lower sales than <em>Thriller</em>, but was still a significant commercial success.

<h3 id="u20132002-label-dispute-and-invincible">2000&lt;U+2013&gt;2002: Label dispute and <em>Invincible</em></h3>
<p>In 2000, Jackson was waiting for the licenses to the masters of his albums to revert back to him; this allowed him to promote his old material how he liked and prevented Sony from getting a cut of the profit. Jackson expected this to occur early in the new millennium, however, due to the fine print and various clauses in the contract, this revert date is still many years away. Jackson began an investigation, and it emerged that the attorney who represented the singer in the deal was also representing Sony, creating a <a href="conflict_of_interest" title="wikilink">conflict of interest</a>.<ref name = "tara 610<U+2013>611&quot;/&gt; Jackson was also concerned about another conflict of interest. For a number of years, Sony had been pushing to buy all of the <a href="Northern_Songs" title="wikilink">Northern Songs</a> catalog from the singer. If Jackson's career or financial situation were to deteriorate, he would have to sell his catalog. Thus, Sony had something to gain from Jackson's career failing.<ref name = "tara 614<U+2013>617&quot;/&gt; Jackson was able to use these conflicts as leverage to exit his contract early.<ref name = "tara 610<U+2013>611&quot;/&gt; Just before the release of <em><a href="Invincible_(Michael_Jackson_album)" title="wikilink">Invincible</a></em>, Jackson informed the head of Sony Music Entertainment, <a href="Tommy_Mottola" title="wikilink">Tommy Mottola</a>, that he was leaving Sony.<ref name = "tara 610<U+2013>611&quot;/&gt; As a result, all singles releases, video shootings and promotions concerning the <em>Invincible</em> album were canceled.

<p>Six years after his last studio album and after spending much of the late 1990s to early millennium out of the public eye, Jackson released <em>Invincible</em> in October 2001 to much anticipation.
