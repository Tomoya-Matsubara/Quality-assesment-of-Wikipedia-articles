<p><strong>Preston</strong> () is a <a href="city" class="uri" title="wikilink">city</a> and <a href="non-metropolitan_district" title="wikilink">non-metropolitan district</a> of <a href="Lancashire" class="uri" title="wikilink">Lancashire</a>, in <a href="North_West_England" title="wikilink">North West England</a>. It is located on the north bank of the <a href="River_Ribble" title="wikilink">River Ribble</a>, and was granted <a href="City_status_in_the_United_Kingdom" title="wikilink">city status</a> in 2002, becoming England's 50th city in the 50th year of <a href="Elizabeth_II_of_the_United_Kingdom" title="wikilink">Queen Elizabeth II</a>'s reign.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> Preston has a population of 131,900, and lies at the centre of the wider Preston sub-area, which has a population of 184,836, and the Central Lancashire sub-region, with a population of 335,000.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>Preston and its surroundings have provided evidence of ancient <a href="Roman_Britain" title="wikilink">Roman</a> activity in the area, largely in the form of a <a href="Roman_road" title="wikilink">Roman road</a> which led to a camp at <a href="Walton-le-Dale" class="uri" title="wikilink">Walton-le-Dale</a>. The <a href="Saxons" class="uri" title="wikilink">Saxons</a> established Preston; the name Preston is derived from <a href="Old_English" title="wikilink">Old English</a> words meaning &quot;Priest settlement&quot; and in the <em><a href="Domesday_Book" title="wikilink">Domesday Book</a></em> appears as &quot;Prestune&quot;. During the <a href="Middle_Ages" title="wikilink">Middle Ages</a>, Preston formed a parish and <a href="township" class="uri" title="wikilink">township</a> in the hundred of <a href="Amounderness" class="uri" title="wikilink">Amounderness</a> and was granted a Guild Merchant charter in 1179, giving it the status of a <a href="market_town" title="wikilink">market town</a>. Textiles have been produced in Preston since the middle of the 13th century, when locally produced wool was woven in people's houses. <a href="Flemish_people" title="wikilink">Flemish</a> weavers who settled in the area during the 14th century helped to develop the industry. Sir <a href="Richard_Arkwright" title="wikilink">Richard Arkwright</a>, inventor of the <a href="spinning_frame" title="wikilink">spinning frame</a>, was a weaver born in Preston. The most rapid period of growth and development in Preston's history coincided with the industrialisation and expansion of <a href="textile_manufacture_during_the_Industrial_Revolution" title="wikilink">textile manufacturing</a>. Preston was a <a href="boomtown" class="uri" title="wikilink">boomtown</a> of the <a href="Industrial_Revolution" title="wikilink">Industrial Revolution</a>, becoming a densely populated engineering centre, with large industrial plants.</p>
<p>In the early 18th century a writer said Preston was &quot;a pretty town with an abundance of gentry in it, commonly called Proud Preston&quot;.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> Preston's textile sector fell into a terminal decline from the mid-20th century. Preston has subsequently faced similar challenges to other <a href="Post-industrial_society" title="wikilink">post-industrial</a> <a href="Northern_England" title="wikilink">northern</a> towns, including <a href="deindustrialisation" class="uri" title="wikilink">deindustrialisation</a>, economic deprivation and housing issues. However, Preston has continued to develop; it is the seat of <a href="Lancashire_County_Council" title="wikilink">Lancashire County Council</a> and <a href="Preston_North_End_F.C." title="wikilink">Preston North End F.C.</a>, one of the oldest football clubs, now houses the <a href="National_Football_Museum" title="wikilink">National Football Museum</a>.</p>
<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<h3 id="etymology">Etymology</h3>
<p>Preston is recorded in the <em><a href="Domesday_Book" title="wikilink">Domesday Book</a></em> as &quot;Prestune&quot; in 1086.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> Various other spellings occur in early documents: &quot;Prestonam&quot; (1094), &quot;Prestone&quot; (1160), &quot;Prestona&quot; (1160), &quot;Presteton&quot; (1180), and &quot;Prestun&quot; (1226). The modern spelling occurs in 1094, 1176, 1196, 1212 and 1332.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> The town's name is derived from <a href="Old_English" title="wikilink">Old English</a> <em>Presta</em> and <em>Tun</em>, the <em>Tun</em>(enclosure, farmstead, village, manor, estate).<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> of the <em>Presta</em> (priest or priests).<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="early-development">Early development</h3>
<p>During the <a href="Ancient_Rome" title="wikilink">Roman</a> period, the main road from <a href="Luguvalium" class="uri" title="wikilink">Luguvalium</a> (Carlisle) to <a href="Mamucium" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mamucium</a> (Manchester) forded the <a href="River_Ribble" title="wikilink">River Ribble</a> at <a href="Walton-le-Dale" class="uri" title="wikilink">Walton-le-Dale</a>, &lt;U+00BE&gt; mile (1 km) southeast of the centre of Preston. Here was a Roman camp, probably a regional depot for military equipment or other supplies. At Withy Trees, 1&lt;U+00BD&gt; miles (2 km) north of Preston, the road crossed another Roman road from <a href="Bremetennacum" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bremetennacum</a> (the Roman fort at <a href="Ribchester" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ribchester</a>) to the coast.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p>In <a href="Ripon" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ripon</a> in 705 AD the lands near the <a href="River_Ribble" title="wikilink">River Ribble</a> were set on a new foundation, and the parish church was probably erected. This parish church was probably situated on the grounds of the present Anglican parish of St. John the Evangelist on Church Street, which was originally dedicated to <a href="St._Wilfrid" title="wikilink">St. Wilfrid</a> and then later <a href="St._John_the_Baptist" title="wikilink">St. John the Baptist</a>. Later, <a href="Edward_the_Elder" title="wikilink">Edward the Elder</a> endowed the lands to the Cathedral at <a href="York" class="uri" title="wikilink">York</a> and then, by means of successive transfers the lands were exchanged between lesser churches, hence the origin of the name <em>Priest's Town</em> or Preston. An alternative explanation of the origin of the name is that the Priest's Town refers to a priory set up by <a href="St._Wilfrid" title="wikilink">St. Wilfrid</a> near the Ribble's lowest ford. This idea is supported by the similarity of the <a href="Paschal_lamb" title="wikilink">Paschal lamb</a> on Preston's crest with that on St. Wilfrid's.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<p>When first mentioned in the 1086 <a href="Domesday_Book" title="wikilink">Domesday Book</a>, Preston was already the most important town in <a href="Amounderness" class="uri" title="wikilink">Amounderness</a> (the area of Central Lancashire between the rivers <a href="River_Ribble" title="wikilink">Ribble</a> and <a href="River_Cocker_(Lancashire)" title="wikilink">Cocker</a>, including the <a href="Fylde" class="uri" title="wikilink">Fylde</a> and the <a href="Forest_of_Bowland" title="wikilink">Forest of Bowland</a>). When assessed for tax purposes in 1218 - 19 it was the wealthiest town in the whole county.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="guild-merchant">Guild Merchant</h3>
<p>The right to hold a <a href="Guild_Merchant" title="wikilink">Guild Merchant</a> was conferred upon the Burgesses of Preston by a charter of 1179;<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> the associated Preston Guild is a civic celebration held every 20 years, with the next one due in 2012.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<p>Before 1328 a celebration had been held on an irregular basis, but at the Guild of that year it was decreed that subsequent Guilds should be held every twenty years. After this there were breaks in the pattern for various reasons, but an unbroken series were held from 1542 to 1922. A full 400 year sequence was frustrated by the cancellation of the 1942 Guild due to <a href="World_War_II" title="wikilink">World War II</a>, but the cycle resumed in 1952. The expression '(Once) every Preston Guild', meaning 'very infrequently', has passed into fairly common use, especially in Lancashire.</p>
<p>Guild week is always started by the opening of the Guild Court, which since the Sixteenth century has traditionally been on the first Monday after the feast of the decollation (the beheading) of <a href="St_John_the_Baptist" title="wikilink">St John the Baptist</a>. As well as concerts and other exhibitions, the main events are a series of processions through the city. Numerous street parties are typically also held in the locality.</p>
<p>In 1952, the emphasis was on the bright new world emerging after <a href="World_War_II" title="wikilink">World War II</a>. The major event held in the city's <a href="Avenham_Park" title="wikilink">Avenham Park</a> had every school participating, and hundreds of children, from toddlers to teenagers, demonstrated different aspects of physical education in the natural amphitheatre of the park.</p>
<h3 id="pre-industrial-preston">Pre-Industrial Preston</h3>
<p>In the mid-12th century, Preston was in the hundred of <a href="Amounderness" class="uri" title="wikilink">Amounderness</a>, in the deanery of Amounderness and the archdeaconry of <a href="Richmond,_North_Yorkshire" title="wikilink">Richmond</a>. The name &quot;Amounderness&quot; is more ancient than the name of any other &quot;Wapentake&quot; or hundred in the County of Lancashire, and the fort at Tulketh, strengthened by <a href="William_the_Conqueror" title="wikilink">William the Conqueror</a>, shows that the strategic importance of the area was appreciated even then.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<p>Served by the <a href="River_Ribble" title="wikilink">River Ribble</a> which flows through the city, Preston was so much the principal port of Lancashire that in the run-up to the English Civil War <a href="Charles_I_of_England" title="wikilink">King Charles I</a> demanded a quarter more ship money from Preston than from nearby <a href="Lancaster,_Lancashire" title="wikilink">Lancaster</a> and twice as much as from <a href="Liverpool" class="uri" title="wikilink">Liverpool</a>. </p>
<p>The location of the city, almost exactly mid-way between <a href="Glasgow" class="uri" title="wikilink">Glasgow</a> and <a href="London" class="uri" title="wikilink">London</a>, led to many decisive battles being fought here, most notably during the <a href="English_Civil_War" title="wikilink">English Civil War</a> (1648), and the first <a href="Jacobitism" title="wikilink">Jacobite</a> rebellion whose invasion of England was brought to a conclusion by the defeat of the pro-Catholic and pro-monarchial Jacobite army at the <a href="Battle_of_Preston_(1715)" title="wikilink">Battle of Preston (1715)</a> which remains the most recent major battle on English soil (though there were further battles with Jacobite or allied forces in Scotland in 1718, 1745 and 1746). </p>
<p>In the last great Jacobite Rising, on 27 November 1745 the Jacobite Prince of Wales and Regent, <a href="Bonnie_Prince_Charlie" title="wikilink">Bonnie Prince Charlie</a> passed through Preston with his Highland Army on the way south through Chorley and Manchester to Derby intending to take London and the Crown. Preston was the first of the very few places in England where the Prince was cheered as he rode by and where he was actually joined by some English volunteers for his Army. From 10 to 12 December the Prince gave his retreating Army a rest in Preston on their long, last and fatal retreat from Derby through Lancaster and Carlisle to their dreadful day of destiny the following 16 April on <a href="Culloden" class="uri" title="wikilink">Culloden</a> Moor near <a href="Inverness" class="uri" title="wikilink">Inverness</a>.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>

<p>The 19th century saw a transformation in Preston from a small market town to a much larger industrial one, as the innovations of the latter half of the previous century such as <a href="Richard_Arkwright" title="wikilink">Richard Arkwright</a>'s <a href="water_frame" title="wikilink">water frame</a> (invented in Preston) brought cotton mills to many northern English towns. With industrialisation came examples of both oppression and enlightenment.</p>
<p>The town's forward-looking spirit is typified by it being the first English town outside London to be lit by gas. The Preston Gas Company was established in 1815 by, amongst others, a Catholic priest: Rev. Joseph &quot;Daddy&quot; Dunn of the <a href="Society_of_Jesus" title="wikilink">Society of Jesus</a>.</p>
<p>The more oppressive side of industrialisation was seen on Saturday 13 August 1842, when a group of cotton workers demonstrated against the poor conditions in the town's mills. The <a href="Riot_Act" title="wikilink">Riot Act</a> was read and armed troops corralled the demonstrators in front of the Corn Exchange on Lune Street. Shots were fired and four of the demonstrators were killed. A commemorative sculpture now stands on the spot (although the soldiers and demonstrators represented are facing the wrong way). In the 1850s, <a href="Karl_Marx" title="wikilink">Karl Marx</a> visited Preston and later described the town as &quot;the next <a href="St._Petersburg" title="wikilink">St. Petersburg</a>&quot;.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> <a href="Charles_Dickens" title="wikilink">Charles Dickens</a> visited Preston in January 1854 during a strike by cotton workers that had by that stage lasted for 23 weeks. This was part of his research for the novel <em><a href="Hard_Times" title="wikilink">Hard Times</a></em> in which the town of &quot;Coketown&quot; is based on the city of Preston.</p>

<p>The Preston Temperance Society, led by Joseph Livesey pioneered the <a href="Teetotalism" title="wikilink">Temperance Movement</a> in the 19th century. Indeed the term <a href="teetotalism" class="uri" title="wikilink">teetotalism</a> is believed to have been coined at one of its meetings. The website of the <a href="University_of_Central_Lancashire" title="wikilink">University of Central Lancashire</a> library has a great deal of information on Joseph Livesey and the Temperance Movement in Preston.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
<p>Preston was one of only a few industrial towns in Lancashire to have a functioning corporation (local council) in 1835, its charter dating to 1685, and was reformed as a <a href="municipal_borough" title="wikilink">municipal borough</a> by the <a href="Municipal_Corporations_Act_1835" title="wikilink">Municipal Corporations Act 1835</a>. It became a <a href="county_borough" title="wikilink">county borough</a> under the <a href="Local_Government_Act_1888" title="wikilink">Local Government Act 1888</a>. In 1974, county boroughs were abolished, and it became the larger part of the new non-metropolitan district of Preston in Lancashire, also including <a href="Fulwood,_Lancashire" title="wikilink">Fulwood</a> and part of <a href="Preston_Rural_District" title="wikilink">Preston Rural District</a>.</p>

<p>Preston has a strong <a href="Christian" class="uri" title="wikilink">Christian</a> (particularly <a href="Roman_Catholicism" title="wikilink">Catholic</a>) history and tradition, and has been called the most Catholic city in England . One of the proposed derivations of the name Preston is from 'Priests town' and the lamb on the city's shield is a biblical image of Jesus Christ, the same image that represented St. Wilfrid, a 7th century bishop and the city's patron saint, who is historically linked to the city's establishment. The &quot;PP&quot; on the shield stands for either &quot;Proud Preston&quot; or &quot;Princeps Pacis&quot; (Prince of Peace), another title for Christ invoking Him as protector of the city. </p>
<p>As well as mainstream denominations like <a href="Roman_Catholicism" title="wikilink">Roman Catholicism</a> and the <a href="Church_of_England" title="wikilink">Church of England</a>, the city has seen a recent emergence of new evangelical churches. Preston has a strong history for <a href="Free_Methodism" title="wikilink">Free Methodism</a>, as there are currently four Free Methodist churches in the area. Preston's Guild Hall plays host to a large <a href="Evangelicalism" title="wikilink">evangelical</a> worship music event called 'Encounter' every year. </p>
<p>Preston was the location of the world's first foreign mission of the <a href="Church_of_Christ_(Latter_Day_Saints)" title="wikilink">Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints</a> (commonly known as the Mormons). As early as 1837 the first <a href="Mormon_missionaries" title="wikilink">Mormon missionaries</a> to Great Britain began preaching in Preston and, in particular, other small towns situated along the river Ribble. Preston is home to the world's oldest continuous <a href="Ward_(LDS_Church)#Branches" title="wikilink">branch</a> (a small congregation) of the Mormon Church.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> An official memorial to the church pioneers may be found in the Japanese Garden in Avenham Park. In 1998 the LDS erected a large temple at <a href="Chorley" class="uri" title="wikilink">Chorley</a>, near Preston, described by <a href="The_Daily_Telegraph" title="wikilink">The Telegraph</a> newspaper as &quot;spectacular&quot;.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> The temple is officially known as the <a href="Preston_England_Temple" title="wikilink">Preston England Temple</a>.</p>

<p><img src="Prestoncity.jpg" title="fig:Entering the city centre from Fylde Road" alt="Entering the city centre from Fylde Road" />The City of Preston is divided into 22 district council wards represented by 57 councillors. There are nine wards with two councillors and 13 wards with three councillors. The two seat wards cover c. 3600 electors and the three seat wards c. 5400 electors. Preston City councillors serve a four-year term. Preston City Council is elected &quot;by thirds&quot;, 19 at a time. One councillor from each of the three-member wards is elected every year for three years. In each of those years six of the nine two-seat wards also elect a councillor. Every fourth year there are no Preston City Council elections, <a href="Lancashire_County_Council" title="wikilink">Lancashire County Council</a> elections taking place instead.</p>
<p>After the <a href="Preston_Council_election,_2007" title="wikilink">2007 local election</a> the Labour Party was the largest Group with 24 members but the Conservatives with 20 seats in alliance with the Liberal Democrats with 10 seats took control of the Cabinet and all committees except the Scrutiny committee. This situation continued after the <a href="Preston_Council_election,_2008" title="wikilink">2008 local election</a> at which the Conservatives, with 21 Councillors took a net seat from the Liberal Democrats who had 9 seats. Labour remained the largest party with 24 members.</p>

<h2 id="geography">Geography</h2>
<h3 id="physical-geography">Physical geography</h3>
<p>The <a href="River_Ribble" title="wikilink">River Ribble</a> provides a southern border for the city. The <a href="Forest_of_Bowland" title="wikilink">Forest of Bowland</a> forms a backdrop to Preston to the east while <a href="the_Fylde" title="wikilink">the Fylde</a> lies to the west.

<p>Preston is located on top of a hill to the west of the <a href="Pennines" class="uri" title="wikilink">Pennines</a>. It therefore, like most of inland Lancashire, receives a higher than UK average total of rainfall, and is slightly colder. On 10 August 1893 Preston entered the <a href="UK_Weather_Records" title="wikilink">UK Weather Records</a>, with the <em>Highest 5-min total</em> <a href="rainfall" class="uri" title="wikilink">rainfall</a> of 32 mm.

<p>As with many cities, Preston has developed from a number of former towns and villages.</p>
<h3 id="civic-geography">Civic geography</h3>
<p>The southern part of the district is mostly urbanised but the northern part is quite rural. The current borders came into effect on 1 April 1974, when the <a href="Local_Government_Act_1972" title="wikilink">Local Government Act 1972</a> merged the existing <a href="County_Borough" title="wikilink">County Borough</a> of Preston with <a href="Fulwood,_Lancashire" title="wikilink">Fulwood</a> <a href="Urban_District" title="wikilink">Urban District</a> and part of <a href="Preston_Rural_District" title="wikilink">Preston Rural District</a>.

However, the existing <a href="M6_motorway" title="wikilink">M6</a> between junctions 30 and 32 was widened extensively between 1993-95 to compensate for this. A new junction, 31A was opened in 1997 to serve a new business park close to the motorway. As well as the M6 (North and South), there are 3 other motorways which terminate close to the city -</p>
