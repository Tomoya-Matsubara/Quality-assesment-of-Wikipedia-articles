<p><strong>Rhyolite</strong> is a <a href="ghost_town" title="wikilink">ghost town</a> in <a href="Nye_County,_Nevada" title="wikilink">Nye County</a>, in the U.S. state of <a href="Nevada" class="uri" title="wikilink">Nevada</a>. It is in the <a href="Bullfrog_Hills" title="wikilink">Bullfrog Hills</a>, about  northwest of <a href="Las_Vegas,_Nevada" title="wikilink">Las Vegas</a>, near the eastern edge of <a href="Death_Valley" title="wikilink">Death Valley</a>. The town began in early 1905 as one of several mining camps that sprang up after a <a href="prospecting" class="uri" title="wikilink">prospecting</a> discovery in the surrounding hills. During an ensuing <a href="gold_rush" title="wikilink">gold rush</a>, thousands of gold-seekers, developers, miners and service providers flocked to the Bullfrog Mining District. Many settled in Rhyolite, which lay in a sheltered desert basin near the region's biggest producer, the Montgomery Shoshone Mine.</p>
<p>Industrialist <a href="Charles_M._Schwab" title="wikilink">Charles M. Schwab</a> bought the Montgomery Shoshone Mine in 1906 and invested heavily in infrastructure, including piped water, electric lines and railroad transportation, that served the town as well as the mine. By 1907, Rhyolite had electric lights, water mains, telephones, newspapers, a hospital, a school, an opera house, and a <a href="stock_exchange" title="wikilink">stock exchange</a>. Published estimates of the town's peak population vary widely, but scholarly sources generally place it in a range between 3,500 and 5,000 in 1907&lt;U+2013&gt;08.</p>
<p>Rhyolite declined almost as rapidly as it rose. After the richest <a href="ore" class="uri" title="wikilink">ore</a> was exhausted, production fell. The <a href="1906_San_Francisco_earthquake" title="wikilink">1906 San Francisco earthquake</a> and the financial <a href="panic_of_1907" title="wikilink">panic of 1907</a> made it more difficult to raise development capital. In 1908, investors in the Montgomery Shoshone Mine, concerned that it was overvalued, ordered an independent study. When the study's findings proved unfavorable, the company's stock value crashed, further restricting funding. By the end of 1910, the mine was operating at a loss, and it closed in 1911. By this time, many out-of-work miners had moved elsewhere, and Rhyolite's population dropped well below 1,000. By 1920, it was close to zero.</p>
<p>After 1920, Rhyolite and its ruins became a tourist attraction and a setting for motion pictures. Most of its buildings crumbled, were salvaged for building materials, or were moved to nearby <a href="Beatty,_Nevada" title="wikilink">Beatty</a> or other towns, although the railway depot and a house made chiefly of empty bottles were repaired and preserved. From 1988 to 1998, three companies operated a profitable <a href="open-pit_mine" title="wikilink">open-pit mine</a> at the base of Ladd Mountain, about  south of Rhyolite. The <a href="Goldwell_Open_Air_Museum" title="wikilink">Goldwell Open Air Museum</a> lies on private property just south of the ghost town, which is on property overseen by the <a href="Bureau_of_Land_Management" title="wikilink">Bureau of Land Management</a>.</p>

<p>&quot;Bullfrog&quot; was the name Frank &quot;Shorty&quot; Harris and Ernest &quot;Ed&quot; Cross, the prospectors who started the Bullfrog gold rush, gave to their mine. As quoted by Robert D. McCracken in <em>A History of Beatty, Nevada</em>, Harris said during a 1930 interview for <em>Westways</em> magazine, &quot;The rock was green, almost like turquoise, spotted with big chunks of yellow metal, and looked a lot like the back of a frog.&quot;<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> The Bullfrog Mining District, the Bullfrog Hills, the town of Bullfrog, and other geographical entities in the region took their name from the Bullfrog Mine.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> <img src="Rhyolite_Train_Station_20061124.JPG" title="fig:The town&#39;s former train station as it appeared in 2006|alt=An ornate, two-story masonry building rests under a cloudless blue sky in a setting of gravel, two spiny trees, and many low shrubs.

Strong surface heating occurs by day and rapid cooling by night, and usually even the hottest days have cool nights. The average percentage of possible sunshine in southern Nevada is more than 80 percent.

<p>By 1907, about 4,000 people lived in Rhyolite, according to Richard E.

<p>Rhyolite in 1907 had concrete sidewalks, electric lights, water mains, telephone and telegraph lines, daily and weekly newspapers, a monthly magazine, police and fire departments, a hospital, school, train station and railway depot, at least three banks, a <a href="stock_exchange" title="wikilink">stock exchange</a>, an opera house, a public swimming pool and two formal church buildings. Most prominent was the three-story John S. Cook and Co. Bank on Golden Street. Finished in 1908, it cost more than $90,000,<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a> equivalent to $ in .<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> Much of the cost went for Italian marble stairs, imported stained-glass windows, and other luxuries. The building housed <a href="brokerage_firm" title="wikilink">brokerage</a> offices, and a post office, as well as the bank. Other large buildings included the train depot, the three-story Overbury Block, and the two-story eight-room school. A miner named Tom T. Kelly built the Bottle House in February 1906 from 50,000 discarded beer and liquor bottles.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a> Another building housed the Rhyolite Mining Stock Exchange, which opened on March 25, 1907, with 125 members, including brokers from New York, Philadelphia, Los Angeles, and other large cities. The small, modestly equipped storefront listed shares of 74 Bullfrog companies and a similar number of companies in nearby mining districts. Sixty thousand shares changed hands on the first day, and by the end of the second week the number had topped 750,000.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a></p>

<p>Although the mine produced more than $1 million (equivalent to about $24 million in 2009)<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a> in <a href="Precious_metal#Bullion" title="wikilink">bullion</a> in its first three years, its shares declined from $23 a share (in historical dollars) to less than $3.<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a> In February 1908, a committee of minority stockholders, suspecting that the mine was overvalued, hired a British mining engineer to conduct an inspection. The engineer's report was unfavorable, and news of this caused a sudden further decline in share value from $3 to 75 cents.<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a> Schwab expressed disappointment when he learned that &quot;the wonderful high-grade [ore] that had brought [the mine] fame was confined to only a few stringers and that what he had actually bought was a large low-grade mine.&quot;<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a> Although the mine was still profitable, by 1909 no new ore was being discovered, and the value of the remaining ore steadily decreased. In 1910, the mine operated at a loss for most of the year, and on March 14, 1911, it was closed. By then, the stock, which had fallen to 10 cents a share, slid to 4 cents and was dropped from the exchanges.<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a></p>

<p>Rhyolite began to decline before the final closing of the mine. At roughly the same time that the Bullfrog mines were running out of high-grade ore, the <a href="1906_San_Francisco_earthquake" title="wikilink">1906 San Francisco earthquake</a> diverted capital to California while interrupting rail service, and the financial <a href="panic_of_1907" title="wikilink">panic of 1907</a> restricted funding for mine development. As mines in the district reduced production or closed, unemployed miners left Rhyolite to seek work elsewhere, businesses failed, and by 1910, the <a href="census" class="uri" title="wikilink">census</a> reported only 675 residents.<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a> All three banks in the town closed by March 1910. The newspapers, including the <em>Rhyolite Herald</em>, the last to go, all shut down by June 1912. The post office closed in November 1913; the last train left Rhyolite Station in July 1914, and the Nevada-California Power Company turned off the electricity and removed its lines in 1916.<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a> Within a year the town was &quot;all but abandoned&quot;,<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a> and the 1920 census reported a population of only 14.<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a> A 1922 motor tour by the <em>Los Angeles Times</em> found only one remaining resident, a 92-year-old man who died in 1924.<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a></p>
<p>Much of Rhyolite's remaining infrastructure became a source of building materials for other towns and mining camps. Whole buildings were moved to Beatty. The Miners' Union Hall in Rhyolite became the Old Town Hall in Beatty, and two-room cabins were moved and reassembled as multi-room homes. Parts of many buildings were used to build a Beatty school.<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a></p>
