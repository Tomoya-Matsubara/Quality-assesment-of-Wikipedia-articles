The film is directed by <a href="Zack_Snyder" title="wikilink">Zack Snyder</a> with Frank Miller attached as an <a href="executive_producer" title="wikilink">executive producer</a> and consultant, and was shot mostly with <a href="bluescreen" class="uri" title="wikilink">bluescreen</a> to duplicate the imagery of the original comic book.</p>
<p><a href="Sparta" title="wikilink">Spartan</a> <a href="Leonidas_I" title="wikilink">King Leonidas</a> (<a href="Gerard_Butler" title="wikilink">Gerard Butler</a>) and 300 Spartans fight to the last man against <a href="Persian_Empire" title="wikilink">Persian</a> <a href="Xerxes_I_of_Persia" title="wikilink">King Xerxes</a> (<a href="Rodrigo_Santoro" title="wikilink">Rodrigo Santoro</a>) and his army of over one million soldiers, while in Sparta, <a href="Gorgo_(Sparta)" title="wikilink">Queen Gorgo</a> (<a href="Lena_Headey" title="wikilink">Lena Headey</a>) attempts to rally support for her husband. The story is framed by a <a href="voice-over" class="uri" title="wikilink">voice-over</a> narrative by the Spartan soldier Dilios (<a href="David_Wenham" title="wikilink">David Wenham</a>). Through this narrative technique, various fantastical creatures are introduced, placing <em>300</em> within the genre of <a href="historical_fantasy" title="wikilink">historical fantasy</a>.</p>
<p><em>300</em> was released in both conventional and <a href="IMAX" class="uri" title="wikilink">IMAX</a> theaters in the United States on <a href="March_9" title="wikilink">March 9</a>, <a href="2007" class="uri" title="wikilink">2007</a>, and on <a href="DVD" class="uri" title="wikilink">DVD</a>, <a href="Blu-Ray" class="uri" title="wikilink">Blu-Ray</a> and <a href="HD_DVD" title="wikilink">HD DVD</a> on <a href="July_31" title="wikilink">July 31</a>, <a href="2007" class="uri" title="wikilink">2007</a>. The film broke <a href="box_office" title="wikilink">box office</a> records, although critics were divided over its look and style. Some acclaimed it as an original achievement, while others criticized it for favoring visuals over <a href="characterization" class="uri" title="wikilink">characterization</a> and its controversial depiction of the ancient Persians.</p>
<h2 id="plot">Plot</h2>
<p>A Spartan orator named Dilios narrates of the young <a href="Leonidas_I" title="wikilink">Leonidas</a> undergoing his <a href="Agoge" title="wikilink">childhood training</a>, explaining the rigors of Spartan life. Leonidas is cast out into the wild, and survives the harsh winter to return to his home, when he is crowned King. Dilios then tells the story of the Persian messengers arriving at <a href="Sparta" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sparta</a> and demanding Sparta's submission to King <a href="Xerxes_I_of_Persia" title="wikilink">Xerxes</a>. Outraged and offended at their behavior, King <a href="Leonidas_I" title="wikilink">Leonidas</a> kicks the messenger into a pit; the other messengers suffer the same fate. Resolving to face the Persians, Leonidas visits <a href="Pythia" title="wikilink">the Oracle</a>, proposing a strategy to repel the numerically superior enemy, and offers the priests a customary payment in gold. The priests, called <a href="Ephors" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ephors</a>, having already been bribed by Xerxes, interpret the Oracle's message to mean that Sparta should not go to war, so as to not interrupt the sacred <a href="Carneian_festival" title="wikilink">Carneian festival</a>.</p>

</figure>
<p>Despite the warning, Leonidas gathers 300 of his best soldiers to fight the Persians, selecting only those who have already sired male children, so that their <a href="family_name" title="wikilink">family name</a> can continue even after their death. As they march north, they are joined by a group of <a href="Arcadia" title="wikilink">Arcadians</a> and other <a href="Greeks" class="uri" title="wikilink">Greeks</a>. Arriving at the narrow cliffs of <a href="Thermopylae" class="uri" title="wikilink">Thermopylae</a> (referred to as the &quot;Hot Gates&quot;), in sight of the Persian army, they build a wall to contain the Persians' advance immediately in front of their position. <a href="Ephialtes_of_Trachis" title="wikilink">Ephialtes</a>, a hunchbacked Spartan whose parents had fled to save him from <a href="Sparta#Society" title="wikilink">customary infanticide</a>, approaches Leonidas, requesting to redeem his father's name in battle, and warning him about a secret goat path that the Persians could use to outflank them, and surround them. Leonidas turns him away because he is unable to properly hold the shield, and would therefore create a weak spot in the <a href="phalanx_formation" title="wikilink">phalanx</a>.</p>
<p><img src="300-_Leonidas_and_Xerxes_discuss_surrender.jpg" title="fig:Xerxes encourages Leonidas to surrender" alt="Xerxes encourages Leonidas to surrender" width="225" /> Before the battle starts, the Persians ask that the 300 drop their arms. Leonidas responds; &quot;Persians! <a href="Molon_labe" title="wikilink">Come and get them</a>!&quot; The Spartans use the phalanx formation, the narrow terrain, and their fighting skill with shield, spear and sword to effectively fight off numerically superior waves of attackers, driving the regular Persian infantry off of a cliff and withstanding a calvary charge without any losses. Xerxes, impressed after the two armies' first engagement, personally approaches Leonidas and attempts to bribe him with wealth and power in exchange for his surrender. The Spartan king declines, saying that he will instead make the &quot;<a href="Divine_king" title="wikilink">God King</a>&quot; bleed. The Spartans then face the <a href="Persian_Immortals" title="wikilink">Immortals</a>, losing a few of their number to the Persian elite guards but still defeating them, with Leonidas personally killing the Uber-Immortal. The Spartans prevail over other types of troops from the vast reaches of the Persian empire, including Mongolian barbarians and their rhinos, soldiers with explosive grenades, and Indian war elephants. However, their last victory is overshadowed by the death of Captain Artemis' eldest son Astinos. Two days after the fighting begins, an embittered Ephialtes reveals the location of the goat path to Xerxes, having been promised a lucrative and powerful position in the Persian Empire.</p>
<p>Back in Sparta, <a href="Gorgo,_Queen_of_Sparta" title="wikilink">Queen Gorgo</a>, upon the advice of a loyal councilman, attempts to enlist the influential Theron to help her persuade the Spartan council to send reinforcements to Leonidas. Theron agrees to help, but demands that Gorgo submit sexually to him; Gorgo reluctantly consents to his advances. Meanwhile, the Greeks realize that Ephialtes has betrayed them, and the Arcadians decide to retreat in the face of certain death. The Spartans refuse to follow, <a href="Battle_of_Thermopylae#Epitaph_of_Simonides" title="wikilink">obedient to their law</a>. Leonidas orders only one man, Dilios, to retreat and use his rhetorical skills to tell the story of the 300 to the Spartan people, ensuring that they be remembered. Dilios reluctantly leaves with the Arcadians. At Sparta, Queen Gorgo appears in front of the council, but is not supported by Theron, who furthermore accuses her of adultery. The Queen, enraged at this betrayal, snatches a sword from a nearby soldier and kills Theron. When Persian coins fall from his purse, the Council denounces him as a traitor and unites against Persia.</p>
<p>At Thermopylae, the Persians have surrounded the 300 on all sides. Xerxes's <a href="General_Officer" title="wikilink">general</a> demands their surrender, saying that Leonidas may keep his title as <a href="Kings_of_Sparta" title="wikilink">King of Sparta</a> and become <a href="warlord" class="uri" title="wikilink">warlord</a> of all Greece, answerable only to Xerxes. Ephialtes begs him to do so as well; Leonidas quips back &quot;may you live forever&quot; (the ultimate Spartan insult, as they wish to die in battle). After feinting submission Leonidas orders his man to cut down the general, causing Xerxes to order his troops to attack. The remaining Spartans are killed in the hail of arrows; Leonidas finally falls, but not before delivering on his promise to &quot;make the 'God King' bleed&quot;, wounding him on the cheek with a thrown spear. The Persian king is visibly shaken at this reminder of his own mortality. Dilios eventually returns to Sparta and inspires the council with the bravery of the 300.</p>
<p>Dilios finishes his tale on a new battlefield surrounded by raptly listening soldiers. He concludes that the Persian army, who lost countless numbers defeating a mere 300 Spartans a year earlier, must now be terrified to face 10,000 Spartans and 30,000 Greeks from the other <a href="city-state" title="wikilink">city-states</a>. The roused Greek host charges the Persian army, beginning the <a href="Battle_of_Plataea" title="wikilink">Battle of Plataea</a>.</p>

<p>Producer Gianni Nunnari was not the only person planning a film about the <a href="Battle_of_Thermopylae" title="wikilink">Battle of Thermopylae</a>; director <a href="Michael_Mann_(film_director)" title="wikilink">Michael Mann</a> already planned a film of the battle based on the book <em><a href="Gates_of_Fire" title="wikilink">Gates of Fire</a></em>. Nunnari discovered Frank Miller's <a href="graphic_novel" title="wikilink">graphic novel</a> <em>300</em>, which impressed him enough to acquire the film rights.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a><a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> <em>300</em> was jointly produced by Nunnari and Mark Canton, and Michael B. Gordon wrote the script.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> Director <a href="Zack_Snyder" title="wikilink">Zack Snyder</a> was hired in June 2004<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> as he had attempted to make a film on Miller's novel before making his debut with the remake of <em><a href="Dawn_of_the_Dead_(2004_film)" title="wikilink">Dawn of the Dead</a></em>,<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> Snyder then got Screenwriter Kurt Johnstad to rewrite Gordon's script for production<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> and Frank Miller was retained as consultant and executive producer.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p>The film is a <a href="shot-for-shot_adaptation" title="wikilink">shot-for-shot adaptation</a> of the <a href="comic_book" title="wikilink">comic book</a>, similar to the film adaptation of <em><a href="Sin_City_(film)" title="wikilink">Sin City</a></em>.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> Snyder photocopied panels from the comic book, from which he planned the preceding and succeeding shots. &quot;It was a fun process for me... to have a frame as a goal to get to,&quot; he said.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> Like the comic book, the adaptation also used the character Dilios as a narrator. Snyder used this narrative technique to show the audience that the surreal &quot;Frank Miller world&quot; of <em>300</em> was related from a subjective perspective. By utilizing Dilios' gift of storytelling, he is able to introduce fantasy elements into the film, explaining that &quot;Dilios is a guy who knows how not to wreck a good story with truth.&quot;<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> Snyder also added the <a href="Subplot" title="wikilink">sub-plot</a> in which Queen Gorgo attempts to rally support for her husband.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<p>Two months of <a href="pre-production" class="uri" title="wikilink">pre-production</a> were required to create hundreds of shields, spears and swords, some of which were recycled from <em><a href="Troy_(film)" title="wikilink">Troy</a></em> and <em><a href="Alexander_(film)" title="wikilink">Alexander</a></em>. An <a href="Audio-Animatronics" title="wikilink">animatronic</a> wolf and thirteen animatronic horses were also created. The actors trained alongside the stuntmen, and even Snyder joined in. Upwards of 600 costumes were created for the film, as well as extensive prosthetics for various characters and the corpses of Persian soldiers.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<p><em>300</em> entered active production on <a href="October_17" title="wikilink">October 17</a>, <a href="2005" class="uri" title="wikilink">2005</a> in <a href="Montreal" class="uri" title="wikilink">Montreal</a>,<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> and was shot over the course of sixty days<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> in chronological order<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> with a budget of $60 million.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> Employing the <a href="digital_backlot" title="wikilink">digital backlot</a> technique, Snyder shot at the now-defunct Icestorm Studios in Montreal using <a href="bluescreen" title="wikilink">bluescreens</a>. Butler said that while he didn't feel constrained by Snyder's direction, fidelity to the comic imposed certain limitations on his performance. Wenham said there were times when Snyder wanted to precisely capture iconic moments from the comic book, and other times when he gave actors freedom &quot;to explore within the world and the confines that had been set&quot;.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> Headey said of her experience with the bluescreens, &quot;It's very odd, and emotionally, there's nothing to connect to apart from another actor.&quot;<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> Only one scene, in which horses travel across the countryside, was shot outdoors.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> The film was an intensely physical production, and Butler pulled an arm tendon and developed a <a href="foot_drop" title="wikilink">foot drop</a>.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>
<p><a href="Post-production" class="uri" title="wikilink">Post-production</a> was handled by Montreal's Meteor Studios and Hybride Technologies filled in the bluescreen footage with more than 1500 <a href="visual_effects" title="wikilink">visual effects</a> shots. <a href="Visual_effects_supervisor" title="wikilink">Visual effects supervisor</a> Chris Watts and <a href="production_designer" title="wikilink">production designer</a> Jim Bissell created a process dubbed &quot;The Crush,&quot;<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> which allowed the Meteor artists to manipulate the colors by increasing the contrast of light and dark. Certain sequences were <a href="Saturation_(color_theory)" title="wikilink">desaturated</a> and tinted to establish different moods. Ghislain St-Pierre, who led the team of artists, described the effect: &quot;Everything looks realistic, but it has a kind of a gritty illustrative feel.&quot;<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a><a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> Various <a href="computer_program" title="wikilink">computer programs</a>, including <a href="Maya_(software)" title="wikilink">Maya</a>, <a href="PhotoRealistic_RenderMan" title="wikilink">RenderMan</a> and RealFlow, were used to create the &quot;spraying blood.&quot;<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> The post-production lasted for a year and was handled by a total of ten <a href="special_effect" title="wikilink">special effects</a> companies.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="soundtrack">Soundtrack</h2>

<p>In July 2005, composer <a href="Tyler_Bates" title="wikilink">Tyler Bates</a> had begun work on the film, describing the score as having, &quot;beautiful themes on the top and large choir,&quot; but &quot;tempered with some extreme heaviness.&quot; The composer had scored for a test scene that the director wanted to show to Warner Bros. to illustrate the path of the project. Bates said that the score had &quot;a lot of weight and intensity in the low end of the percussion&quot; that Snyder found agreeable to the film.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> The score was recorded at <a href="Abbey_Road_Studios" title="wikilink">Abbey Road Studios</a> and features the vocals of <a href="Azam_Ali" title="wikilink">Azam Ali</a>.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> A standard edition and a <a href="special_edition" title="wikilink">special edition</a> of the soundtrack containing 25 tracks was released on <a href="March_6" title="wikilink">March 6</a>, <a href="2007" class="uri" title="wikilink">2007</a>, with the special edition containing a 16-page booklet and three two-sided <a href="trading_card" title="wikilink">trading cards</a>.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a></p>
<p>The score has given rise to some controversy in the film composer community, garnering criticism for its striking similarity to several other recent soundtracks, including <a href="James_Horner" title="wikilink">James Horner</a> and <a href="Gabriel_Yared" title="wikilink">Gabriel Yared</a>'s work for the film <em><a href="Troy_(film)" title="wikilink">Troy</a></em>. The heaviest borrowings are allegedly from <a href="Elliot_Goldenthal" title="wikilink">Elliot Goldenthal</a>'s 1999 score for <em><a href="Titus_(film)" title="wikilink">Titus</a></em>. &quot;Remember Us,&quot; from <em>300</em>, is identical in parts to the &quot;Finale&quot; from <em>Titus</em>, and &quot;Returns a King&quot; is similar to the cue &quot;Victorius Titus.&quot;<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a><a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a><a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> Commentators have also noted that the melody of &quot;Message for the Queen&quot; is identical to the song &quot;Zajdi, zajdi&quot; by composer Aleksandar Sarievski.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a><a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> Macedonian portal On.net published a response by Tyler Bates, who claims that he &quot;can't say there is a specific source of inspiration for the cue.&quot;<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a>. However, on August 3, 2007, Warner Bros. Pictures acknowledged in an official statement, &quot;a number of the music cues for the score of <em>300</em> were, without our knowledge or participation, derived from music composed by Academy Award winning composer Elliot Goldenthal for the motion picture <em>Titus</em>. Warner Bros. Pictures has great respect for Elliot, our longtime collaborator, and is pleased to have amicably resolved this matter.&quot;<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="historical-accuracy">Historical accuracy</h2>
<p><em>300</em>'s director Zack Snyder stated in an MTV interview that &quot;The events are 90 percent accurate. It's just in the visualization that it's crazy.... I've shown this movie to world-class historians who have said it's amazing. They can't believe it's as accurate as it is.&quot; He continues that the film is &quot;an opera, not a documentary. That's what I say when people say it's historically inaccurate&quot;.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> However he is quoted in a <a href="BBC_News" title="wikilink">BBC News</a> story that the film is, at its core &quot;a <a href="fantasy_film" title="wikilink">fantasy film</a>.&quot; He also describes the film's narrator, Dilios, as &quot;a guy who knows how not to wreck a good story with truth.&quot;<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a></p>
<p><a href="Paul_Cartledge" title="wikilink">Paul Cartledge</a>, Professor of <a href="History_of_Greece" title="wikilink">Greek History</a> at <a href="Cambridge_University" title="wikilink">Cambridge University</a>, advised the filmmakers on the <a href="Ancient_Greek_phonology" title="wikilink">pronunciation of Greek</a> names, and states that they &quot;made good use&quot; of his published work on Sparta. He praises the film for its portrayal of &quot;the Spartans' heroic code,&quot; and of &quot;the key role played by women in backing up, indeed reinforcing, the male martial code of heroic honor,&quot; while expressing reservations about its &quot;'West' (goodies) vs 'East' (baddies) polarization.&quot;<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> Cartledge writes that he enjoyed the film, although he found Leonidas' description of the Athenians as &quot;boy lovers&quot; ironic, given his views on the <a href="Spartan_pederasty" title="wikilink">institutional pederasty</a> of the Spartan educational system.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a></p>
<p>Ephraim Lytle, assistant professor of Hellenistic History at the <a href="University_of_Toronto" title="wikilink">University of Toronto</a>, states that <em>300</em> selectively idealizes Spartan society in a &quot;problematic and disturbing&quot; fashion, as well as portraying the &quot;hundred nations of the Persians&quot; as monsters and non-Spartan Greeks as weak. He suggests that the film's moral universe would have seemed as &quot;bizarre to <a href="Ancient_Greece" title="wikilink">ancient Greeks</a> as it does to modern historians.&quot;<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a></p>

He remarks that <a href="Simonides_of_Ceos" title="wikilink">Simonides</a>, <a href="Aeschylus" class="uri" title="wikilink">Aeschylus</a> and <a href="Herodotus" class="uri" title="wikilink">Herodotus</a> viewed Thermopylae as a battle against &quot;Eastern centralism and collective serfdom&quot;, which opposed &quot;the idea of the free citizen of an autonomous polis&quot;.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> He further states that the film portrays the battle in a &quot;surreal&quot; manner, and that the intent was to &quot;entertain and shock first, and instruct second.&quot;<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a></p>

While it received a <a href="standing_ovation" title="wikilink">standing ovation</a> at the public premiere,<a href="#fn75" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref75"><sup>75</sup></a> it was reportedly panned at a press screening hours earlier, where many attendees left during the showing and those who remained booed at the end.<a href="#fn76" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref76"><sup>76</sup></a> In North America, critical reviews of <em>300</em> are divided.

<h3 id="controversy">Controversy</h3>
<p>Prior to the release of <em>300</em>, Warner Brothers expressed concerns about the political aspects of the film's theme. Snyder relates that &quot;There was a huge sensitivity about East versus West with the studio.&quot;<a href="#fn89" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref89"><sup>89</sup></a> Media speculation about a possible parallel between the Greco-Persian conflict and current events began in an interview with Snyder that was conducted before the Berlin Film Festival.<a href="#fn90" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref90"><sup>90</sup></a> The interviewer remarked that &quot;everyone is sure to be translating this [film] into contemporary politics.&quot; Snyder replied that, while he was aware that people would read the film through the lens of contemporary events, no parallels between the film and the contemporary world were intended.<a href="#fn91" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref91"><sup>91</sup></a></p>
<p>Outside the current political parallels, some critics have raised more general questions about the film's ideological orientation. The <em><a href="New_York_Post" title="wikilink">New York Post</a></em>'s <a href="Kyle_Smith" title="wikilink">Kyle Smith</a> writes that the film would have pleased &quot;<a href="Adolf_Hitler" title="wikilink">Adolf</a>'s boys,&quot;<a href="#fn92" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref92"><sup>92</sup></a> and <a href="Slate_(magazine)" title="wikilink">Slate</a>'s Dana Stevens compares the film to <a href="The_Eternal_Jew_(film)" title="wikilink"><em>The Eternal Jew</em></a>, &quot;as a textbook example of how race-baiting fantasy and nationalist myth can serve as an incitement to total war&quot;.<a href="#fn93" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref93"><sup>93</sup></a> Roger Moore, a critic for the <em><a href="Orlando_Sentinel" title="wikilink">Orlando Sentinel</a></em>, matches <em>300</em> to <a href="Susan_Sontag" title="wikilink">Susan Sontag</a>'s definition of &quot;<a href="fascist" class="uri" title="wikilink">fascist</a> art.&quot;<a href="#fn94" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref94"><sup>94</sup></a></p>
<p>However, <em><a href="Newsday" class="uri" title="wikilink">Newsday</a></em> critic Gene Seymour states that such reactions are misguided, writing that &quot;the movie's just too darned silly to withstand any ideological theorizing.&quot;<a href="#fn95" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref95"><sup>95</sup></a> Snyder himself dismisses ideological readings, suggesting that reviewers who critique a &quot;graphic novel movie about a bunch of guys...stomping the snot out of each other&quot; using words like &quot; 'neocon,' 'homophobic,' 'homoerotic' or 'racist' &quot; are &quot;missing the point.&quot;<a href="#fn96" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref96"><sup>96</sup></a></p>

<p>Since its opening, <em>300</em> has also attracted controversy over its portrayal of people of the <a href="Persian_Empire" title="wikilink">Persian Empire</a>. Various critics, historians, journalists, and officials of the Iranian government including President <a href="Mahmoud_Ahmadinejad" title="wikilink">Mahmoud Ahmadinejad</a><a href="#fn97" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref97"><sup>97</sup></a> have denounced the film.<a href="#fn98" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref98"><sup>98</sup></a><a href="#fn99" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref99"><sup>99</sup></a><a href="#fn100" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref100"><sup>100</sup></a> As in the graphic novel, the Persians are depicted as a monstrous, barbaric and demonic horde, and King <a href="Xerxes_I_of_Persia" title="wikilink">Xerxes</a> is portrayed as <a href="androgynous" class="uri" title="wikilink">androgynous</a>.<a href="#fn101" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref101"><sup>101</sup></a><a href="#fn102" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref102"><sup>102</sup></a> Critics have suggested that this is meant to stand in stark contrast to the masculinity of the Spartan army.<a href="#fn103" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref103"><sup>103</sup></a> Steven Rea argues that the film's Persians are a vehicle for an anachronistic cross-section of Western stereotypes of Asian and African cultures.<a href="#fn104" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref104"><sup>104</sup></a></p>
<p>The film's portrayal of ancient <a href="Persian_people" title="wikilink">Persians</a> caused a particularly strong reaction in <a href="Iran" class="uri" title="wikilink">Iran</a>.<a href="#fn105" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref105"><sup>105</sup></a> <a href="Azadeh_Moaveni" title="wikilink">Azadeh Moaveni</a> of <em><a href="Time_(magazine)" title="wikilink">Time</a></em> reports that <a href="Tehran" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tehran</a> is &quot;outraged&quot; following the film's release. Moaveni identifies two factors which may have contributed to the intense reaction: its release on the eve of <a href="Norouz" class="uri" title="wikilink">Norouz</a>, the Persian <a href="New_Year" title="wikilink">New Year</a>, and the common Iranian view of the <a href="Achaemenid_Empire" title="wikilink">Achaemenid Empire</a> as &quot;a particularly noble page in their history.&quot;<a href="#fn106" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref106"><sup>106</sup></a><a href="#fn107" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref107"><sup>107</sup></a><a href="#fn108" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref108"><sup>108</sup></a> Various Iranian officials condemned the film.<a href="#fn109" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref109"><sup>109</sup></a><a href="#fn110" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref110"><sup>110</sup></a><a href="#fn111" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref111"><sup>111</sup></a><a href="#fn112" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref112"><sup>112</sup></a> The <a href="Iranian_Academy_of_the_Arts" title="wikilink">Iranian Academy of the Arts</a> submitted a formal complaint against the movie to <a href="UNESCO" class="uri" title="wikilink">UNESCO</a>, labelling it an attack on the historical identity of Iran.<a href="#fn113" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref113"><sup>113</sup></a><a href="#fn114" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref114"><sup>114</sup></a> The Iranian mission to the U.N. protested the film in a <a href="News_release" title="wikilink">press release</a>,<a href="#fn115" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref115"><sup>115</sup></a> and Iranian embassies protested its screening in France, Thailand, Turkey and Uzbekistan.<a href="#fn116" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref116"><sup>116</sup></a><a href="#fn117" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref117"><sup>117</sup></a><a href="#fn118" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref118"><sup>118</sup></a><a href="#fn119" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref119"><sup>119</sup></a></p>
<p>In response to the criticisms, a Warner Bros. spokesman stated that the film <em>300</em> &quot;is a work of fiction inspired by the Frank Miller graphic novel and loosely based on a historical event.
