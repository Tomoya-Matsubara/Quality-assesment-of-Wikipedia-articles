<p><strong>Ann Arbor</strong> is a city in the <a href="U.S._state" title="wikilink">U.S. state</a> of <a href="Michigan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Michigan</a> and the <a href="county_seat" title="wikilink">county seat</a> of <a href="Washtenaw_County,_Michigan" title="wikilink">Washtenaw County</a>. As of the <a href="United_States_2000_Census" title="wikilink">2000 census</a>, the city had a total population of 114,024. Supposedly named for the spouses of the city's founders and for the stands of trees in the area, Ann Arbor is best known as the location of the main campus of the <a href="University_of_Michigan" title="wikilink">University of Michigan</a>, which moved there from <a href="Detroit,_Michigan" title="wikilink">Detroit</a> in 1837.</p>
<p>The city's economy, which was once noted for production of agricultural implements, carriages, furniture, pianos and organs, pottery, and flour, is now dominated by <a href="education" class="uri" title="wikilink">education</a>, <a href="high-tech" class="uri" title="wikilink">high-tech</a>, and <a href="biotechnology" class="uri" title="wikilink">biotechnology</a>. Average home prices and property taxes are well above the state and national medians. The city is also well known locally as a destination for dining out and entertainment, as it contains a wide and eclectic variety of restaurants and performance venues.</p>
<h2 id="history">History</h2>

<p>Ann Arbor was founded in January 1824 by <a href="John_Allen_(founder)" title="wikilink">John Allen</a> and <a href="Elisha_Rumsey" title="wikilink">Elisha Rumsey</a>, both of whom were land speculators. There are various accounts concerning the origin of the settlement's name, but one states that Allen and Rumsey decided to name it &quot;Annarbour&quot; for their spouses, both named Ann, and for the stands of burr <a href="oak" class="uri" title="wikilink">oak</a> in the 640 <a href="acre" title="wikilink">acres</a> (260 <a href="hectare" title="wikilink">hectares</a>) of land they had purchased for <a href="United_States_dollar" title="wikilink">$</a>800 from the federal government.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> The <a href="Native_Americans_(U.S.)" title="wikilink">Native Americans</a> of the region knew the settlement as <em>Kaw-goosh-kaw-nick</em>, after the sound of Allen's grist mill.</p>

The town set aside 40 acres (16 hectares) of undeveloped land and offered it to the State of Michigan as the site of the state capitol, but it lost the bid to <a href="Lansing,_Michigan" title="wikilink">Lansing</a> in 1836. In 1837 the unused land was given to the <a href="University_of_Michigan" title="wikilink">University of Michigan</a>, forever linking Ann Arbor and its history with the university.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> The town became a regional transportation hub in 1839 with the arrival of the <a href="Michigan_Central_Railroad" title="wikilink">Michigan Central Railroad</a>. Ann Arbor was chartered as a city in 1851.</p>
<p>During <a href="World_War_II" title="wikilink">World War II</a>, <a href="Ford_Motor_Company" title="wikilink">Ford Motor Company</a>'s nearby <a href="Willow_Run" title="wikilink">Willow Run</a> plant turned out <a href="B-24_Liberator" title="wikilink">B-24 Liberator</a> bombers. The population of Ann Arbor exploded with an influx of military personnel, war workers, and their families.</p>
<p>The city gained a reputation as an important center for liberal politics over the course of the 1960s and 1970s. Presidential candidate <a href="John_F._Kennedy" title="wikilink">John F. Kennedy</a> unveiled his <a href="Peace_Corps" title="wikilink">Peace Corps</a> proposal in 1960 at the University of Michigan, and there in 1964 President <a href="Lyndon_B._Johnson" title="wikilink">Lyndon B. Johnson</a> first called for a &quot;<a href="Great_Society" title="wikilink">Great Society</a>.&quot; <a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> The city also became a locus for <a href="left-wing_politics" title="wikilink">left-wing</a> activism, serving as a hub for the <a href="American_civil_rights_movement" title="wikilink">civil-rights movement</a> and <a href="Opposition_to_U.S._involvement_in_the_Vietnam_War" title="wikilink">anti-Vietnam War movement</a>, as well as the student movement. The first major meetings of the national left-wing campus group <a href="Students_for_a_Democratic_Society" title="wikilink">Students for a Democratic Society</a> took place in Ann Arbor in 1960, and in 1965 the city was home to the first U.S. <a href="teach-in" class="uri" title="wikilink">teach-in</a> against the <a href="Vietnam_War" title="wikilink">Vietnam War</a>.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> Over the course of the ensuing fifteen years, a plethora of <a href="counterculture" title="wikilink">countercultural</a> and <a href="New_Left" title="wikilink">New Left</a> enterprises sprang up and developed strong constituencies within the city.</p>
<p>These influences washed into municipal politics during the early and mid-1970s when three members of the local, progressive <a href="Human_Rights_Party" title="wikilink">Human Rights Party</a> (HRP) won city-council seats on the strength of the student vote. During their time on the council, HRP representatives successfully fought for measures ranging from pioneering <a href="civil_rights" title="wikilink">antidiscrimination</a> ordinances to <a href="Marijuana_laws_in_Ann_Arbor,_Michigan" title="wikilink">measures decriminalizing marijuana possession</a> to a <a href="rent_control" title="wikilink">rent-control</a> ordinance &lt;U+2013&gt; many of which remain in effect in modified form today.</p>
<p>Alongside these liberal and left-wing efforts, a small handful of conservative institutions were also born in Ann Arbor. These include <a href="Word_of_God_(movement)" title="wikilink">Word of God</a> (established in 1967), a charismatic Catholic movement of national scope;<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> and the <a href="Thomas_More_Law_Center" title="wikilink">Thomas More Law Center</a> (established in 1999), a leading religious-conservative advocacy group.</p>
<p>The economy of Ann Arbor underwent a gradual shift from a manufacturing base to a service and technology base over the course of the 20th century, a shift which accelerated in the 1970s and 1980s. At the same time, the downtown has transformed from one dominated primarily by retail establishments dealing in staple goods to one comprised mainly of eateries, caf&lt;U+00E9&gt;s, bars and clubs, and specialty shops.</p>
<p>Over the past several decades, the city has increasingly found itself grappling with the effects of sharply rising land values and <a href="gentrification" class="uri" title="wikilink">gentrification</a>, as well as <a href="urban_sprawl" title="wikilink">urban sprawl</a> stretching far into the outlying countryside. On <a href="November_2" title="wikilink">November 2</a>, <a href="2004" class="uri" title="wikilink">2004</a>, voters approved a <a href="greenbelt" class="uri" title="wikilink">greenbelt</a> plan under which the city government would buy development rights to pieces of land adjacent to Ann Arbor to preserve them from sprawling development. Since then, a vociferous local debate has hinged on whether, and how, to accommodate and guide development within city limits.</p>

<p>Ann Arbor is situated on the <a href="Huron_River_(Michigan)" title="wikilink">Huron River</a>, in a productive agricultural and fruit-growing region. The landscape of Ann Arbor consists of rolling hills and <a href="valley" title="wikilink">valleys</a>, with the terrain becoming steeper near the Huron River. The elevation ranges from about 750 <a href="foot_(unit_of_length)" title="wikilink">feet</a> (230 <a href="metre" title="wikilink">m</a>) along the Huron River to about 900 feet (275 m) above sea level in southern and northeastern Ann Arbor.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> The elevation is about 839 feet (256 m) at Ann Arbor Municipal Airport, which is located at .</p>

<p>Ann Arbor's &quot;Tree Town&quot; moniker stems from the dense forestation of its parks and residential areas. The city holds almost as many trees as residents, with more than 50,000 trees sited along city streets and an equal number in city parks.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> In recent years, the <a href="emerald_ash_borer" title="wikilink">emerald ash borer</a> has destroyed many of the city's approximately 10,500 <a href="ash_tree" title="wikilink">ash trees</a>.</p>
<p>The city contains 147 municipal parks, ranging from neighborhood vest-pocket parks to large recreation areas, with several large city parks and a university park bordering sections of the Huron River. The largest are Argo Park, Riverside Park, County Farm Park, and Gallup Park (near the Huron Parkway), while Fuller Recreation Area, near the <a href="University_of_Michigan_Health_System" title="wikilink">University Hospital</a> complex, contains sports fields, pedestrian and <a href="bike_path" title="wikilink">bike paths</a>, and swimming pools. <a href="Nichols_Arboretum" title="wikilink">Nichols Arboretum</a>, which is jointly owned by the City of Ann Arbor and the <a href="University_of_Michigan" title="wikilink">University of Michigan</a> (and known locally as &quot;The Arboretum&quot; or just &quot;The Arb&quot;), is a 123-acre (50 hectare) preserve containing hundreds of plant and tree species on the east side of the city near downtown.</p>
<p>The Kerrytown Shops, Main Street Business District, the State Street Business District, and the South University Business District are commercial areas in downtown. Three commercial areas south of downtown include the areas near <a href="Interstate_94" title="wikilink">I-94</a> and Ann Arbor-Saline Road, Briarwood Mall, and the South Industrial area. Other commercial areas include the Arborland/Washtenaw Avenue and Packard Road merchants on the east side, the Plymouth Road area in the northeast, and the Westgate/West Stadium areas on the west side. The downtown contains a mix of 19th and early 20th-century structures and modern-style buildings, as well as a <a href="farmers&#39;_market" title="wikilink">farmers' market</a> in the Kerrytown district. The city's commercial districts are mostly comprised of two to four-story structures, although the downtown and the area near Briarwood Mall contain a small number of high-rise buildings.</p>
<p>Ann Arbor's residential neighborhoods contain a range of architectural styles, from classic 19th and early 20th-century designs to <a href="ranch-style_house" title="wikilink">ranch-style houses</a>. More contemporary-style houses are located farther from the downtown district. Surrounding the University of Michigan campus are houses and apartment complexes occupied primarily by student renters. The 19th-century buildings and streetscape of the Old West Side neighborhood have been preserved virtually intact; in 1972, the district was listed on the <a href="National_Register_of_Historic_Places" title="wikilink">National Register of Historic Places</a>, and it is further protected via city ordinances and a nonprofit preservation group.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>

<h3 id="events">Events</h3>
<p>A number of annual events &lt;U+2013&gt; many of them centered on performing and visual arts &lt;U+2013&gt; draw visitors to Ann Arbor from around the state and the region. The Ann Arbor Folk Festival, an annual <a href="benefit_concert" title="wikilink">benefit concert</a> held in late January for the <a href="Ark_(folk_venue)" title="wikilink">Ark</a>, features many folk musicians.

Since 1986, it has featured students <a href="Streaking" title="wikilink">running naked</a> through the streets in late April to celebrate the end of the winter semester. Originally police blocked off the streets to allow the run, but beginning in 2000, a crackdown by university and city police citing safety concerns has forced participants to adapt, with the event appearing in various reduced forms since.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a></p>
<p>Many large-scale events occur during the summer months. These include the Taste of Ann Arbor, a one-day event held during the first week of June in the downtown area; and the Ann Arbor Summer Festival, a three-and-a-half-week series of concerts, plays, and films typically held from mid-June through early July at the Power Center and atop the adjacent parking structure, which is host to the free &quot;Top of the Park&quot; events.</p>

<p>The streets in downtown Ann Arbor conform to a grid pattern, though this pattern is less apparent in the surrounding areas. Several major roads branch out from the downtown district like spokes on a wheel to the highways surrounding the city. Some of the major surface arteries lead to the I-94/M-14 juncture in the west, US 23 in the east, and the city's southern areas. Also, a large network of <a href="bike_path" title="wikilink">bike paths</a> crisscrosses the city.</p>

A separate free bus service operates within the University of Michigan campuses. Plans have been floated several times to operate a trolley service between downtown and Briarwood Mall along disused rail tracks, although these have not come to fruition as of 2005. A downtown bus depot served by <a href="Greyhound_Lines" title="wikilink">Greyhound Lines</a> provides out-of-town bus service, and is the city's only remaining example of the <a href="Streamline_Moderne" title="wikilink">Streamline Moderne</a> architectural style.</p>
