<p><strong>Benjamin Claude Cecil Tipper</strong> (<a href="7_July" title="wikilink">7 July</a> <a href="1896" class="uri" title="wikilink">1896</a> - <a href="11_July" title="wikilink">11 July</a> <a href="1970" class="uri" title="wikilink">1970</a>) was an <a href="England" title="wikilink">English</a> <a href="cricketer" class="uri" title="wikilink">cricketer</a> who played five <a href="first-class_cricket" title="wikilink">first-class</a> matches for <a href="Worcestershire_County_Cricket_Club" title="wikilink">Worcestershire</a> in <a href="1919_English_cricket_season" title="wikilink">1919</a>. All were friendlies, as Worcestershire did not re-enter the <a href="County_Championship" title="wikilink">County Championship</a> until <a href="1920_English_cricket_season" title="wikilink">the following year</a>.</p>
<p>Tipper made his debut on <a href="23_June" title="wikilink">23 June</a> against <a href="Gloucestershire_County_Cricket_Club" title="wikilink">Gloucestershire</a>, and his 42 in the first innings helped avert a crisis; he had come in with the score on 27/5, but his steadying knock helped the team to 201. He also took 2-49 in Gloucestershire's own first innings (his first victim being his near-namesake <a href="Alfred_Dipper" title="wikilink">Alfred Dipper</a>), but second time around he was out for 3 and he took no more wickets before the game finished in <a href="the_result_in_cricket" title="wikilink">a draw</a>.</p>
<p>He had no notable success in his next three games, although in mid-August (once more against Gloucestershire) he took the final two wickets in the first innings to record his best <a href="bowling_analysis" title="wikilink">bowling analysis</a> of 1.2-1-0-2. He played only one more first-class match, against <a href="Warwickshire_County_Cricket_Club" title="wikilink">Warwickshire</a> a week later. Here he made 43, his career best, and 0; his five overs of bowling were unsuccessful.</p>
<p>Tipper was born in <a href="King&#39;s_Norton" title="wikilink">King's Norton</a>, then in <a href="Worcestershire" class="uri" title="wikilink">Worcestershire</a>, and died just after his 74th birthday in <a href="Norton_Lindsay" title="wikilink">Norton Lindsay</a>, <a href="Warwickshire" class="uri" title="wikilink">Warwickshire</a>.</p>
