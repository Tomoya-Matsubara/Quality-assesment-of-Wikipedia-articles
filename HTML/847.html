<p><strong>Hurricane Floyd</strong> was the sixth named storm, fourth <a href="hurricane" class="uri" title="wikilink">hurricane</a>, and third major hurricane in the <a href="1999_Atlantic_hurricane_season" title="wikilink">1999 Atlantic hurricane season</a>. Floyd triggered the second largest evacuation in US history (behind Hurricane Rita) when 2.6 million coastal residents of five states including Florida were ordered from their homes as Hurricane Floyd approached. The <a href="Cape_Verde-type_hurricane" title="wikilink">Cape Verde-type hurricane</a> formed off the coast of Africa and lasted from <a href="September_7" title="wikilink">September 7</a> to <a href="September_19" title="wikilink">September 19</a>, peaking in strength as a very strong Category 4 hurricane — just short of the highest possible rating — on the <a href="Saffir-Simpson_Hurricane_Scale" title="wikilink">Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale</a>. It was among the largest <a href="Atlantic_hurricane" title="wikilink">Atlantic hurricanes</a> of its strength ever recorded.</p>
<p>Floyd struck <a href="The_Bahamas" title="wikilink">The Bahamas</a> at peak strength, causing heavy damage. It then paralleled the <a href="East_Coast_of_the_United_States" title="wikilink">East Coast of the United States</a>, causing massive evacuations and costly preparations. The storm weakened significantly, however, before making landfall in <a href="North_Carolina" title="wikilink">North Carolina</a> as a Category 2 hurricane, and caused further damage as it traveled up the <a href="Mid-Atlantic_States" title="wikilink">Mid-Atlantic</a> region and into <a href="New_England" title="wikilink">New England</a>.</p>
<p>The hurricane produced torrential rainfall in eastern North Carolina, adding more rain to an area hit by <a href="Hurricane_Dennis_(1999)" title="wikilink">Hurricane Dennis</a> just weeks earlier. The rains caused widespread flooding over a period of several weeks; nearly every river basin in the eastern part of the state exceeded 500-year flood levels. In total, Floyd was responsible for 57 fatalities and $4.5 billion ($5.7 billion in 2006 <a href="United_States_dollar" title="wikilink">U.S. dollars</a>) in damage, mostly in North Carolina.</p>
<h2 id="storm-history">Storm history</h2>

<p>Floyd originated as a <a href="tropical_wave" title="wikilink">tropical wave</a> that exited the coast of <a href="Africa" class="uri" title="wikilink">Africa</a> on <a href="September_2" title="wikilink">September 2</a>. It moved steadily westward and remained disorganized and devoid of deep convection until <a href="September_7" title="wikilink">September 7</a>, when a curved band of deep convection developed over the center in response to a developing anticyclone. At this point, the <a href="National_Hurricane_Center" title="wikilink">National Hurricane Center</a> designated it as Tropical Depression Eight, while it was approximately 1,000 miles (1600 km) east of the <a href="Lesser_Antilles" title="wikilink">Lesser Antilles</a>. A strong ridge of high pressure to its north forced the developing tropical cyclone westward over warmer waters, allowing it to strengthen to Tropical Storm Floyd on the 8th.<ref name="tcr">{{</p>

<p>Although a large storm, Floyd initially lacked a well-defined inner core, resulting in slow strengthening and preventing rapid intensification. On <a href="September_10" title="wikilink">September 10</a> it organized enough to reach hurricane status, and on the 11th Floyd approached major hurricane strength with winds of 110 mph (175 km/h) while north of the <a href="Leeward_Islands" title="wikilink">Leeward Islands</a>. The central Atlantic upper tropospheric trough, along with an upper-level low in the eastern <a href="Caribbean_Sea" title="wikilink">Caribbean Sea</a>, produced shear over the hurricane and caused its winds to weaken to 85 mph (135 km/h). A turn to the west, caused by building of high pressures, was followed by a period of rapid intensification: in 24 hours maximum sustained winds increased from 110 mph (175 km/h) to 155 mph (250 km/h), while the pressure dropped to 921 <a href="mbar" class="uri" title="wikilink">mbar</a> (<a href="hPa" class="uri" title="wikilink">hPa</a>) by morning on the 13th.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> One contributor to the intensification was the high oceanic heat content along the storm's path.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>

<p>Hurricane Floyd remained just below Category 5 status on the <a href="Saffir-Simpson_Hurricane_Scale" title="wikilink">Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale</a> for 12 hours while crossing the Bahamas, making landfalls on <a href="Eleuthera" class="uri" title="wikilink">Eleuthera</a> and <a href="Abaco" class="uri" title="wikilink">Abaco</a> islands,<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> before an <a href="eye_(cyclone)#Eyewall_replacement_cycle" title="wikilink">eyewall replacement cycle</a> weakened it to a Category 3 hurricane with winds of 120 mph (195 km/h). The new, larger eyewall contracted slightly, and the hurricane briefly re-intensified to Category 4 status. A strong mid- to upper-level trough eroded the western portion of the high-pressure ridge, steering Floyd to the northwest. It paralleled the eastern <a href="Florida" class="uri" title="wikilink">Florida</a> coast 110 miles (175 km) off shore, and steadily weakened because of entrainment of dry air and upper-level shear.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> The storm remained extremely large, however; at its peak, tropical storm-force winds spanned a diameter of 580 miles (935 km), making Floyd one of the largest Atlantic hurricanes of its intensity ever recorded.<ref>{{</p>

<p>Floyd accelerated to the north and northeast, and weakened greatly to a Category 2 hurricane with 105 mph (165 km/h) winds at its <a href="Cape_Fear" title="wikilink">Cape Fear</a> landfall on <a href="September_16" title="wikilink">September 16</a>.

The storm gradually lost its tropical characteristics due to an approaching frontal zone and became <a href="Extratropical_cyclone" title="wikilink">extratropical</a> over southern <a href="Maine" class="uri" title="wikilink">Maine</a> late on the 17th.

<p>A hurricane warning was issued for the North Carolina coastline 27 hours prior to landfall.

<h3 id="ecological-effects">Ecological effects</h3>
<p><img src="Floyd_runoff.png" title="fig:Runoff in the aftermath of the hurricane" alt="Runoff in the aftermath of the hurricane" /> Runoff from the hurricane created significant problems for the ecology of North Carolina's rivers and sounds.</p>
<p>In the immediate aftermath of the storm, freshwater runoff, sediment, and decomposing organic matter caused salinity and oxygen levels in <a href="Pamlico_Sound" title="wikilink">Pamlico Sound</a> and its tributary rivers to drop to nearly zero. This raised fears of massive fish and shrimp kills, as had happened after <a href="Hurricane_Fran" title="wikilink">Hurricane Fran</a> and <a href="Hurricane_Bonnie_(1998)" title="wikilink">Hurricane Bonnie</a>, and the state government responded quickly to provide financial aid to fishing and shrimping industries. Strangely, however, the year's shrimp and crab harvests were extremely prosperous; one possible explanation is that runoff from <a href="Hurricane_Dennis_(1999)" title="wikilink">Hurricane Dennis</a> caused marine animals to begin migrating to saltier waters, so they were less vulnerable to Floyd's ill effects.<ref>{{</p>

<p>}}</ref></p>
<p>Pollution from runoff was also a significant fear. Numerous pesticides were found in low but measurable quantities in the river waters, particularly in the <a href="Neuse_River" title="wikilink">Neuse River</a>. Overall, however, the concentration of contaminants was slightly lower than had been measured in <a href="Hurricane_Fran" title="wikilink">Hurricane Fran</a>, likely because Floyd simply dropped more water to dilute them.<ref>{{</p>

<p>A 2004 study by the <a href="University_of_North_Carolina_at_Chapel_Hill" title="wikilink">University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill</a>, published in the <em>American Journal of Preventive Medicine</em>, found some evidence that small children living in the hardest-hit part of North Carolina suffered increased rates of child abuse during the six months following the storm. This is likely due to parental stress in rebuilding and grieving their losses in the aftermath of a catastrophe. Dr. Heather T. Keenan, co-author of the study, said, &quot;This information may be useful in future disaster planning. To the extent possible, vulnerable families should receive additional support—both immediately after a disaster and during the recovery period.&quot;<ref>{{</p>
