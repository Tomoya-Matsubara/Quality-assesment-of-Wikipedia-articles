<p><strong><em>The Malay Archipelago</em></strong> is a book by the British naturalist <a href="Alfred_Russel_Wallace" title="wikilink">Alfred Russel Wallace</a> that chronicles his scientific exploration, during the eight-year period 1854 to 1862, of the southern portion of the <a href="Malay_Archipelago" title="wikilink">Malay Archipelago</a> including <a href="Malaysia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Malaysia</a>, <a href="Singapore" class="uri" title="wikilink">Singapore</a>, the islands of <a href="Indonesia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Indonesia</a>, then known as the <a href="Dutch_East_Indies" title="wikilink">Dutch East Indies</a>, and the island of <a href="New_Guinea" title="wikilink">New Guinea</a>. It was published in two volumes in 1869, delayed by Wallace's ill health and the work needed to describe the many specimens he brought home. The book went through ten editions in the nineteenth century; it has been reprinted many times since, and has been translated into at least eight languages.</p>
<p>The book described each island that he visited in turn, giving a detailed account of its <a href="physical_geography" title="wikilink">physical</a> and <a href="human_geography" title="wikilink">human geography</a>, its volcanoes, and the variety of animals and plants that he found and collected. At the same time, he describes his experiences, the difficulties of travel, and the help he received from the different peoples that he met. The preface notes that he travelled over 14,000 miles and collected 125,660 <a href="natural_history" title="wikilink">natural history</a> specimens, mostly of <a href="insects" class="uri" title="wikilink">insects</a> though also thousands of <a href="molluscs" class="uri" title="wikilink">molluscs</a>, <a href="birds" class="uri" title="wikilink">birds</a>, <a href="mammals" class="uri" title="wikilink">mammals</a> and <a href="reptiles" class="uri" title="wikilink">reptiles</a>.</p>
<p><em>The Malay Archipelago</em> attracted many reviews, with interest from scientific, geographic, church and general periodicals. Reviewers noted and sometimes disagreed with various of his theories, especially the division of <a href="fauna" class="uri" title="wikilink">fauna</a> and <a href="flora" class="uri" title="wikilink">flora</a> along what soon became known as the <a href="Wallace_line" title="wikilink">Wallace line</a>, <a href="natural_selection" title="wikilink">natural selection</a> and <a href="uniformitarianism" class="uri" title="wikilink">uniformitarianism</a>. Nearly all agreed that he had provided an interesting and comprehensive account of the <a href="geography" class="uri" title="wikilink">geography</a>, natural history, and peoples of the archipelago, which was little known to their readers at the time, and that he had collected an astonishing number of specimens. The book is much cited, and is Wallace's most successful, both commercially and as a piece of literature.</p>
<h2 id="context">Context</h2>
<p>In 1847, Wallace and his friend <a href="Henry_Walter_Bates" title="wikilink">Henry Walter Bates</a>, both in their early twenties, agreed that they would jointly make a collecting trip to the Amazon &quot;towards solving the problem of origin of species&quot;.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> (<a href="Charles_Darwin" title="wikilink">Charles Darwin</a>'s book on the <em><a href="Origin_of_Species" title="wikilink">Origin of Species</a></em> was not published until 11 years later, in 1859. It was based on Darwin's own long collecting trip on <a href="The_Voyage_of_the_Beagle" title="wikilink">HMS Beagle</a>, its publication precipitated by a famous letter from Wallace which described the theory of evolution by natural selection in outline.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a>) Wallace and Bates had been inspired by reading the American <a href="entomologist" class="uri" title="wikilink">entomologist</a> <a href="William_Henry_Edwards" title="wikilink">William Henry Edwards</a>'s pioneering 1847 book <em>A Voyage Up the River Amazon, with a residency at Par&lt;U+00E1&gt;</em>.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> Bates stayed in the Amazons for 11 years, going on to write <em><a href="The_Naturalist_on_the_River_Amazons" title="wikilink">The Naturalist on the River Amazons</a></em> (1863); however, Wallace, ill with fever, went home in 1852 with thousands of specimens, some for science and some for sale. The ship and his collection were destroyed by fire at sea near the Guianas. Rather than giving up, Wallace wrote about the Amazon in both prose and poetry, and then set sail again, this time for the Malay Archipelago.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="publication">Publication</h2>
<p><em>The Malay Archipelago</em> was first published in 1869 in two volumes by Macmillan (London), and the same year in one volume by Harper &amp; Brothers (New York). Wallace returned to England in 1862, but explains in the Preface that given the large quantity of specimens and his poor health after his stay in the tropics, it took a long time. He noted that he could at once have printed his notes and journals, but felt that doing that would have been disappointing and unhelpful. Instead, therefore, he waited until he had published papers on his discoveries, and other scientists had described and named as new species some 2,000 of his beetles (<a href="Coleoptera" class="uri" title="wikilink">Coleoptera</a>), and over 900 <a href="Hymenoptera" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hymenoptera</a> including 200 new species of <a href="ant" class="uri" title="wikilink">ant</a>.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> The book went through 10 editions, with the last published in 1890.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>

<p>The preface summarizes Wallace&lt;U+2019&gt;s travels, the thousands of specimens he collected, and some of the results from their analysis after his return to <a href="England" class="uri" title="wikilink">England</a>. In the preface he notes that he travelled over 14,000 miles and collected 125,660 specimens, mostly of <a href="insects" class="uri" title="wikilink">insects</a>: 83,200 <a href="beetles" class="uri" title="wikilink">beetles</a>, 13,100 <a href="Lepidoptera" title="wikilink">butterflies and moths</a>, 13,400 other insects. He also returned to England 7,500 &quot;shells&quot; (such as <a href="molluscs" class="uri" title="wikilink">molluscs</a>), 8,050 <a href="birds" class="uri" title="wikilink">birds</a>, 310 <a href="mammals" class="uri" title="wikilink">mammals</a> and 100 <a href="reptiles" class="uri" title="wikilink">reptiles</a>.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p>The book is dedicated to <a href="Charles_Darwin" title="wikilink">Charles Darwin</a>, but as Wallace explains in the preface, he has chosen to avoid discussing the <a href="evolution" title="wikilink">evolutionary</a> implications of his discoveries. Instead he confines himself to the &quot;interesting facts of the problem, whose solution is to be found in the principles developed by Mr. Darwin&quot;,<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> so from a scientific point of view, the book is largely a descriptive <a href="natural_history" title="wikilink">natural history</a>. This modesty belies the fact that while in <a href="Sarawak" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sarawak</a> in 1855 Wallace wrote the paper <em>On the Law which has Regulated the Introduction of New Species</em>, concluding with the evolutionary &quot;Sarawak Law&quot;, &quot;Every species has come into existence coincident both in space and time with a closely allied species&quot;, three years before he fatefully wrote to Darwin proposing the concept of <a href="natural_selection" title="wikilink">natural selection</a>.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<p>The first chapter describes the <a href="physical_geography" title="wikilink">physical geography</a> and <a href="geology" class="uri" title="wikilink">geology</a> of the islands with particular attention to the role of <a href="volcanoes" class="uri" title="wikilink">volcanoes</a> and earthquakes. It also discusses the overall pattern of the flora and fauna including the fact that the islands can be divided, by what would eventually become known as the <a href="Wallace_line" title="wikilink">Wallace line</a>, into two parts, those whose animals are more closely related to those of Asia and those whose fauna is closer to that of Australia.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<p>The following chapters describe in detail the places Wallace visited. Wallace includes numerous observations on the people, their languages, ways of living, and social organization, as well as on the plants and animals found in each location. He talks about the <a href="biogeographic" class="uri" title="wikilink">biogeographic</a> patterns he observes and their implications for <a href="natural_history" title="wikilink">natural history</a>, in terms both of the movement of species and of the geologic history of the region. He also narrates some of his personal experiences during his travels.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> The final chapter is an overview of the ethnic, linguistic, and cultural divisions among the people who live in the region and speculation about what such divisions might indicate about their history.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>

<dt>5 Borneo&lt;U+2014&gt;Journey In The Interior</dt>
<dd>Wallace returns to Sarawak, where he stays in the circular 'head-house' of a Dyak village, travels upriver, and describes the Durian, praising it as the king of fruits with exquisite and unsurpassed flavour,<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> and the Dyak's slender bamboo bridges,<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> as well as ferns and <em><a href="Nepenthes" class="uri" title="wikilink">Nepenthes</a></em> pitcher plants. On a mountain he finds the only place in his entire journey where <a href="moth" title="wikilink">moths</a> are abundant; he collected 1,386 moths on a total of 26 nights, but over 800 of these were caught on four very wet and dark nights. He attributes the reason to having a ceiling that effectively trapped the moths; in other houses the moths at once escaped into the roof, and he recommends naturalists to bring a verandah-shaped tent to enable them to catch moths.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a>

<dl>
<dt>6 Borneo&lt;U+2014&gt;The Dyaks</dt>
<dd>Wallace describes the <a href="Dayak_people" title="wikilink">Dyak people</a>, expressing surprise that despite <a href="Thomas_Malthus" title="wikilink">Thomas Malthus</a>'s predictions for the human population of the world, and the lack of any obvious restraints, the Dyak population appeared to be stable.

<dl>
<dt>7 <a href="Java" class="uri" title="wikilink">Java</a></dt>
<dd>Wallace stayed three and a half months in Java, where he admires the system of government and the contented people. The population is, he notes, rapidly increasing, from 3.5 million in 1800 to 5.5 million in 1826 and 14 million in 1865. He enjoys the fine Hindu archaeological sites, and the flora of the mountain tops which have plants resembling those of Europe, including the Royal Cowslip, <em>Primula imperialis</em>, <a href="endemism" title="wikilink">endemic</a> to one mountain top.
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>8 <a href="Sumatra" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sumatra</a></dt>
<dd>He visits Sumatra while the coastal forest of <em><a href="Nipa" class="uri" title="wikilink">Nipa</a></em> palms is flooded to a distance of several miles from the sea. The river houses at Palembang are built on rafts moored to piles, rising and falling with the tide. He admires the <a href="rumah_adat" title="wikilink">traditional houses</a> of the villages, but had difficulty getting any food there, the people living entirely on rice through the rainy season. He discovers some new species of butterfly including <em><a href="Papilio_memnon" title="wikilink">Papilio memnon</a></em> which occurs in different forms, some being <a href="Batesian_mimicry" title="wikilink">Batesian mimics</a> of <em><a href="Atrophaneura_coon" title="wikilink">Papilio coon</a></em>. He admires the <a href="camouflage" class="uri" title="wikilink">camouflage</a> of a species of <a href="Kallima" title="wikilink">dead leaf butterfly</a>, <em><a href="Paphia_paralekta" title="wikilink">Kallima paralekta</a></em>. He is pleased that one of his hunters brings him a male <a href="Hornbill" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hornbill</a>, shot at its nest hole while feeding the female.
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>9 <a href="Natural_History" title="wikilink">Natural History</a> Of The Indo-Malay Islands.</dt>
<dd>Wallace sketches the natural history of the islands to the West of the Wallace line, noting that the flora is like that of <a href="India" class="uri" title="wikilink">India</a>, as described by the <a href="botany" title="wikilink">botanist</a> <a href="Joseph_Dalton_Hooker" title="wikilink">Joseph Dalton Hooker</a> in his 1855 <em>Flora Indica</em>. Similarly the mammals are similar to those of India, including the <a href="tiger" class="uri" title="wikilink">tiger</a>, <a href="leopard" class="uri" title="wikilink">leopard</a>, <a href="rhinoceros" class="uri" title="wikilink">rhinoceros</a> and <a href="elephant" class="uri" title="wikilink">elephant</a>. The bird species had diverged, but the <a href="genus" title="wikilink">genera</a> were mainly the same, and some species of (for example) woodpecker, parrot, kingfisher and pheasant were found from India to Java and Borneo, while many more were found both in Sumatra and the Malay peninsula.

<dd>Wallace is grateful for an involuntary stop in Bali, which he finds one of the most interesting places of his trip, as Hindu customs and religion are still practised, while on Lombok he finds Australian birds such as Cockatoos, observing that this is the most westerly point of that family's range.
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>11 Lombock&lt;U+2014&gt;Manners And Customs</dt>
<dd>On Lombok, Wallace observes how guns are made, witnessing the boring of gun barrels by two men rotating a pole which is weighted down by a basket of stones. He describes the Sasak people of the island, and the custom of running <a href="amok" class="uri" title="wikilink">amok</a>.
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>12 Lombock&lt;U+2014&gt;How The Rajah Took The Census</dt>
<dd>The whole chapter is taken up with a legend, which Wallace calls an anecdote, about the Rajah (king) of Lombok. It involves taxation, needles and sacred <a href="kris" title="wikilink">krisses</a>.
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>13 <a href="Timor" class="uri" title="wikilink">Timor</a></dt>
<dd>Wallace describes the island of Timor, its abundance of fan-palms, its people who are like Papuans, and the Portuguese government which he considers extremely poor. On some hills he finds <em><a href="Eucalyptus" class="uri" title="wikilink">Eucalyptus</a></em> (gum) trees, a genus from <a href="Australia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Australia</a>; he finds the vegetation monotonous also.
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>14 Natural History Of The Timor Group</dt>
<dd>He finds the mixture of bird species intermediate between those of Java and Australia, with 36 species actually Javan, and 11 closely related; while there are only 13 actually Australian, with 35 closely related. Wallace interprets this to mean that a small number of birds from Australia, and a larger number from Java, colonised Timor and then evolved into new species endemic to the island. The land mammals were very few in number: the six species were endemic or related to those of Java or the Moluccas, with none from Australia, so he doubts there was ever a land bridge to that continent.

<dt>17 Celebes&lt;U+2014&gt;Menado</dt>
<dd>Wallace visits <a href="Menado" class="uri" title="wikilink">Menado</a> on the northeast coast of Celebes. The people of the Minahasa region are fair-skinned, unlike anywhere else in the archipelago. He stays high in the mountains by the coffee plantations, and is often cold, but finds that the animals are no different from those lower down. The forest was full of <a href="orchids" class="uri" title="wikilink">orchids</a>, <a href="bromeliads" class="uri" title="wikilink">bromeliads</a>, <a href="clubmosses" class="uri" title="wikilink">clubmosses</a> and <a href="moss" title="wikilink">mosses</a>.

He finds that the people, under the guidance of <a href="missionaries" class="uri" title="wikilink">missionaries</a>, are the most hard-working, peaceful and civilized of the whole archipelago. He obtains (apparently by purchase) skulls of the <a href="Babirusa" class="uri" title="wikilink">Babirusa</a> (pig-deer) and the rare <a href="Bubalus_depressicornis" title="wikilink">Sapiutan</a> (midget buffalo).
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>18 Natural History of Celebes</dt>
<dd>He describes the range of species in each group in some detail, concluding that the birds are unlike those of any of the surrounding countries and are quite isolated, but are related to those of distant places including New Guinea, Australia, India and Africa; he thinks there is nowhere else where so many such species occur in one place. Similarly in the <a href="Nymphalidae" class="uri" title="wikilink">Nymphalidae</a> (he mentions the English member, the <a href="Purple_Emperor" title="wikilink">Purple Emperor</a> butterfly), there are 48 species of which 35 are endemic to Celebes. He concludes that the Celebes group of islands is a major faunal division of the archipelago.

The Celebes Babirusa is, oddly, found on Bouru, which he supposes it reached partly by swimming, citing <a href="Charles_Lyell" title="wikilink">Sir Charles Lyell</a>'s <em>Principles of Geology</em> to confirm this ability. The other mammals are <a href="marsupial" class="uri" title="wikilink">marsupial</a>, so, he presumes, true natives. In contrast to the few mammals, there are at least 265 bird species, more than all of Europe, which had 257, but of these just three groups &lt;U+2014&gt; parrots, kingfishers and pigeons &lt;U+2014&gt; make up nearly a third, compared to only a twentieth of the birds of India. Wallace suggests this is because they came from New Guinea, which has a similar lack of some groups, and adds that many New Guinea birds have not reached the Moluccas, implying that the islands have been isolated for a long time.

<h3 id="contemporary">Contemporary</h3>
<p><em>The Malay Archipelago</em> was warmly received on publication, often in lengthy reviews that attempted to summarize the book, from the perspective that suited the reviewing periodical. It was reviewed in more than 40 periodicals: a selection of those reviews is summarized below.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a></p>
<h4 id="anthropological-review"><em>Anthropological Review</em></h4>
<p>The <em>Anthropological Review</em> notes that while the descriptions of animal life are &quot;full of interest&quot;, &quot;our readers, as anthropologists, will, however, take a keener interest&quot; in the &quot;great man-like ape of Borneo,&lt;U+2014&gt;the orang-utan, or <em>mias</em>, as it is called by the aborigines&quot;. Two pages are taken up with a discussion of the orang utan. The review then turns to Wallace's observations on &quot;the races of man&quot; in the book, observing that the anthropological details given are useful but perhaps chosen to support &quot;a particular theory&quot;, namely Wallace's belief that there were eastern and western races&lt;U+2014&gt;&quot;Malays&quot; and &quot;Papuans&quot;, though the boundary between them was east of the Wallace line. The review accepts Wallace's data on natural history, but suspects he was selective in recording details of individuals. It notes that Wallace agreed with French authors that the Polynesians (included in his Papuans) &quot;had a local origin&quot;. The review remarks that &quot;Mr Wallace relies more on the diversity of moral features to prove differences of race than on physical peculiarities, although he declares that these are strongly marked&quot; and doubts the difference, and wonders whether the &quot;Javan chief&quot; and the Dyak do not differ more. The review, after ten pages of reflections on race, concludes by recommending the book to its readers as much better than ordinary travel books &quot;and even in the absence of any very stirring incidents&quot; that it will &quot;amply repay the perusal&quot; of both scientific and general readers.<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a></p>

It remarks that Wallace greatly extends knowledge of the people of Timor, Celebes, and the Maluccas, while also adding to what is known of the Malays and Papuans, reprinting his entire description and his engraving of a Papuan. The reviewer remarks that the portrait &quot;would as well suit a Papuan of the south-east coast of New Guinea as any of those whom Mr. Wallace saw&quot;, noting however that the southern tribes are more varied in skin colour. The reviewer disagrees with Wallace about the extension of this &quot;Papuan race&quot; as far as Fiji, noting that there are or were people like that in Tasmania, but that their features and height varied widely, perhaps forming a series. The reviewer disagrees also that the Sandwich Islanders and &quot;New Zealanders&quot; (Maori) are related to the Papuans; and with Wallace's claim that the presence of Malay words in Polynesian languages is caused by the &quot;roaming habits&quot; &lt;U+2014&gt; trade and navigation &lt;U+2014&gt; of the Malays, arguing instead that the Polynesians long ago migrated from &quot;some common seat in, or near, the Malay Archipelago&quot;.

He points out the same principle between the <a href="British_Isles" title="wikilink">British Isles</a> and continental Europe, though there the conclusion is rather that the same fauna and flora is found on both sides.

<p><em>The Popular Science Review</em> began by writing that &quot;We never remember to have taken up a book which gave us more pleasure&quot;.<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a> It was quite unlike the dull journey logs of most travel books; it was &quot;a romance, which is, nevertheless, plain matter of fact&quot;. The review especially admires the way that Wallace &quot;has generalised on the facts&quot; rather than just shooting &quot;a multitude of birds&quot; and interminably describing them. The account notes that Wallace was the joint originator of the theory of natural selection, and summarizes the discovery of the Wallace line in some detail. The review ends by placing the <em>Malay Archipelago</em> between <a href="Charles_Lyell" title="wikilink">Charles Lyell</a>'s <em><a href="Principles_of_Geology" title="wikilink">Principles of Geology</a></em> and <a href="Charles_Darwin" title="wikilink">Darwin's</a> <em><a href="Origin_of_Species" title="wikilink">Origin of Species</a></em>. <a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a></p>
<h4 id="american-quarterly-church-review"><em>American Quarterly Church Review</em></h4>
<p><a href="File:Malay_Archipelago_Bird_of_Paradise_shooting.jpg" title="wikilink">thumb|upright=0.8|Natives of Aru shooting the Great Bird of Paradise</a> The <em>American Quarterly Church Review</em> admires Wallace's bravery in going alone among the &quot;barbarous races&quot; in a &quot;villainous climate&quot; with all the hardships of travel, and his hard work in skinning, stuffing, drying and bottling so many specimens. Since &quot;As a scientific man he follows Darwin&quot; the review finds &quot;his theories sometimes need as many grains of salt as his specimens.&quot; But the review then agrees that the book will &quot;make the world wiser about its more solitary and singular children, hid away over the seas&quot;, and opines that no-one will mind paying the price of the book to read about the birds of paradise, &quot;those bird-angels, with flaming wings of crimson and gold and scarlet, who twitter and gambol and make merry among the great island trees, while the Malay hunts for them with his blunt-headed arrows...&quot; The review concludes that the book is a fresh and valuable record of &quot;a remote and romantic land&quot;.<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a></p>
<h4 id="australian-town-and-country-journal"><em>Australian Town and Country Journal</em></h4>
<p>The <em>Australian Town and Country Journal</em> begins by stating that<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a></p>

<p>and quickly makes clear that it objects to Wallace's doubts about &quot;indications of design&quot; in plants. Despite this &quot;grave&quot; fault, the reviewer considers the book to be of immense value, and that it would become a standard work on the region.<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a> The review quotes a paragraph that paints &quot;a picture of country life in the Celebes&quot;, where Wallace describes his host, a Mr. M., who relied on his gun to supply his table with wild pigs, deer, and jungle fowl, while enjoying his own milk, butter, rice, coffee, ducks, palm wine and tobacco. However, the Australian reviewer doubted Wallace's judgement about flavours, given that he praised the <a href="Durian" class="uri" title="wikilink">Durian</a> fruit, namely that it tastes of custard, cream cheese, onion sauce, brown sherry &quot;and other incongruities&quot;, whereas &quot;most Europeans&quot; found it &quot;an abomination&quot;.<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a></p>
<p>Otherwise, the review notes that Wallace seemed to have enjoyed his time in the Celebes, with the hornbills flapping past, and the baboons staring down from their trees, and enjoys his enthusiasm for the <a href="birds_of_paradise" title="wikilink">birds of paradise</a>. The review is respectful of his account of the Wallace line, having no difficulty agreeing that the Australian-type vegetation continues into the archipelago as far as Lombok and Celebes. It concludes that he covers almost every natural phenomenon he came across &quot;with the accuracy and discriminating sagacity of an accomplished naturalist&quot;, and explains that the &quot;great charm&quot; of the book is &quot;a truthful simplicity&quot; which inspires confidence.<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a></p>
<h4 id="calcutta-review"><em>Calcutta Review</em></h4>
<p><img src="The_Museum,_Chowringhee.jpg" title="fig:The Indian Museum, Calcutta" alt="The Indian Museum, Calcutta" /> The <em>Calcutta Review</em> starts by noting that this is a book that cannot be done justice in a brief notice, that Wallace is a most eminent naturalist, and chiefly known as a Darwinian. the book was the most interesting to cross the reviewer's desk since <a href="William_Gifford_Palgrave" title="wikilink">Palgrave</a>'s <em>Arabia</em> (1865) and Sir <a href="Samuel_Baker" title="wikilink">Samuel Baker</a>'s <em>Explorations of the Nile</em> (1866). By combining geography, geology and ethnology into one narrative, the reader is saved &quot;the monotony of traversing the same regions several times&quot;. The review describes in detail Wallace's findings of different birds and mammals either side of the Wallace line. It notes Wallace's cheerfulness and good temper in the face of &quot;the difficulties and inconveniences attendant upon foreign travel&quot;, such as having to cross &quot;a hundred miles of open sea in a little boat of four tons burthen&quot;,<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a> which Wallace calmly describes as comparatively comfortable. The reviewer remarks that Wallace was &quot;set down as a conjuror by these simple people&quot; with unimaginable purposes from a faraway country, but is less admiring about Wallace's moralising tone, especially when he supposes that &quot;wild communities&quot; can be happier than &quot;in a more highly civilised society&quot;. The review ends with some reflections of surprise on how little-known the Malay Archipelago is in India, given that they were closely connected with <a href="Prambanan" title="wikilink">Hindu temples in Java</a> and <a href="Balinese_Hinduism" title="wikilink">Bali</a>, and hopes that soon there will be some &quot;productions&quot; of the archipelago in the <a href="Indian_Museum" title="wikilink">Indian Museum</a> of <a href="Kolkata" title="wikilink">Calcutta</a>.<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a></p>
<h4 id="revue-des-deux-mondes"><em>Revue des Deux Mondes</em></h4>
<p>The book's fame spread beyond the English-speaking world. R. Radau wrote a lengthy review of <em>Un naturaliste dans l'Archipel Malais</em> in the <a href="France" title="wikilink">French</a> <em>Revue des Deux Mondes</em>. Radau notes the many deaths from volcanic eruptions in the archipelago, before explaining the similarity of the fauna of Java and Sumatra with that of central Asia, while that of the Celebes carries the mark of Australia, seeming to be the last representatives of another age. Radau describes Wallace's experiences in Singapore, where goods were far cheaper than in Europe &lt;U+2014&gt; wire, knives, corkscrews, gunpowder, writing-paper, and he remarks on the spread of the <a href="Society_of_Jesus" title="wikilink">Jesuits</a> into the interior, though the missionaries had to live on just 750 francs a year. Singapore was covered in wooded hills, and the sawn wood and rotten trunks supported innumerable beetles for the naturalist to study. The only disagreeable element was that the tigers that roared in the forest devoured on average one Chinese per day, especially in the ginger plantations.<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a></p>
<p>Radau summarizes one passage from the book after another: the orang utans of Borneo wrestling open the jaws of a crocodile, or killing a python; the Timorese walking up tall trees, leaning back on ropes as they pull themselves upwards; the indescribable taste of a <a href="Durian" class="uri" title="wikilink">Durian</a> fruit, at once recalling custard, almond paste, roasted onions, sherry and a host of other things, that melts on the tongue, that one does not want to stop eating; more, the fruit has a repulsive odour, and the tree is dangerous, as the hard and heavy fruits can fall on your head. Radau follows Wallace up to the high plateaux of Java, where there are Cypress forests covered in moss and lichen; finally at the summit the vegetation seems European, an island vegetation recalling the resemblance between the plants of the high Alps and of Lapland. And in Celebes, men run <a href="amok" class="uri" title="wikilink">amok</a>, generally killing a dozen people before meeting their own death.<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a></p>
<p>Radau returns to food, describing sago and the breadfruit tree. The breadfruit tastes like <a href="Yorkshire_pudding" title="wikilink">Yorkshire pudding</a> or mashed potato; with meat it is the best of vegetables; with sugar, milk, butter or molasses, it is a delicious pudding with a special flavour; Radau hopes that perhaps it will one day be found in European markets. As for the sago palm, one tree yields 1,800 cakes, enough to feed a man for a year.<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a></p>
<p>There is torrential rain; there are savages; there are dangerous trips in small boats. Only in the final paragraph does Radau reflect on it all: &quot;We have tried, in this study on Wallace's two volumes, to give an idea of what he saw in his eight year stay in the Far East.&quot; He admits he has left out most of the natural history, and regrets not having space for more &quot;charming pages&quot; which would have taken him too far. He joins Wallace in reflecting on the relative state of &quot;civilized&quot; and &quot;savage&quot;, wondering which is morally superior, and notes the &quot;nostalgia for the primitive state&quot;, concluding that civilization brings the benefit of reason to restrain hasty action.<a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a></p>

<p>In McKie's view, Wallace was a gifted writer with &quot;an eye for catchy observation&quot;, and this is one of the finest of travel books.
