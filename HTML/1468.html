<p><strong>Istv&lt;U+00E1&gt;n T&lt;U+00FC&gt;rr</strong> (, ), (August 10, 1825, <a href="Baja,_Hungary" title="wikilink">Baja, Hungary</a> &lt;U+2013&gt; May 3, 1908, <a href="Budapest" class="uri" title="wikilink">Budapest</a><a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>) was a Hungarian soldier, revolutionary, canal architect and engineer, remembered in Italy for his role in that country's <a href="Unification_of_Italy" title="wikilink">unification</a> and his association with <a href="Garibaldi" class="uri" title="wikilink">Garibaldi</a>. In the later years of his life became known as a <a href="peace_activist" title="wikilink">peace activist</a>.</p>
<h2 id="young-age-and-enlistment">Young age and Enlistment</h2>
<p>T&lt;U+00FC&gt;rr was born in the city of <a href="Baja,_Hungary" title="wikilink">Baja, Hungary</a>, the fifth child of an <a href="ironmonger" class="uri" title="wikilink">ironmonger</a>. His mother was Ter&lt;U+00E9&gt;zia Udvary, whose father was a medical doctor. When young he was not a diligent pupil and left school early. As a teenager he tried his father's profession as well as working in a mill and as an unskilled mason, but did not show great aptitude for any of these three jobs.</p>
<p>The first time he tried to enlist in the Austrian Army he was rejected, but on his re-application in 1842 he was accepted at the age of 17. Moreover, officers found in him a hitherto unnoticed promise and encouraged him to improve himself and undergo officer's training at <a href="P&lt;U+00E9&gt;cs" class="uri" title="wikilink">P&lt;U+00E9&gt;cs</a>. By 1848 he was already a military engineer at the rank of <a href="lieutenant" class="uri" title="wikilink">lieutenant</a> in a Hungarian <a href="grenadier" class="uri" title="wikilink">grenadier</a> regiment.</p>
<h2 id="deserting-the-austrian-army-fighting-for-the-1848-revolution-in-italy">Deserting the Austrian Army, fighting for the 1848 Revolution in Italy</h2>
<p>At the time when the <a href="Hungarian_Revolution_of_1848" title="wikilink">Hungarian Revolution of 1848</a> engulfed his homeland, T&lt;U+00FC&gt;rr was stationed in <a href="Lombardy" class="uri" title="wikilink">Lombardy</a>, Italy. He was involved in early fighting against Piedmont and witnessed the cruel retaliations inflicted on rebellious Italians at <a href="Monza" class="uri" title="wikilink">Monza</a>, where he was stationed &lt;U+2013&gt; which caused him to change his loyalties.</p>
<p>On January 19, 1849 T&lt;U+00FC&gt;rr crossed the bridge over the <a href="Ticino" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ticino</a> and went over to the <a href="Kingdom_of_Piedmont-Sardinia" title="wikilink">Piedmont</a> side. He was immediately placed in command of the newly-formed &quot;Hungarian Legion&quot;, comprising numerous deserters of the Austrian Imperial Army. Its ranks were swelled by the increasing desertion of Hungarian soldiers and officers, crossing the Ticino in small boats every night until the Austrian command moved them away.</p>
<p>In a parallel development, another Hungarian Legion &lt;U+2013&gt; headed by Lajos Winkler (1810&lt;U+2013&gt;1861) who would later become T&lt;U+00FC&gt;rr's close associate &lt;U+2013&gt; was formed at <a href="Venice" class="uri" title="wikilink">Venice</a> and fought in defence of the revolutionary <a href="Repubblica_di_San_Marco" title="wikilink">Repubblica di San Marco</a> headed by <a href="Daniele_Manin" title="wikilink">Daniele Manin</a>.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>Thus, T&lt;U+00FC&gt;rr became involved in the <a href="First_Italian_War_of_Independence" title="wikilink">First Italian War of Independence</a>, under the leadership of King <a href="Carlo_Alberto" title="wikilink">Carlo Alberto</a> of Piedmost. However, before he could lead the Hungarian Legion to the field and take part in actual fighting against his former Austrian comarades in arms. the final Austrian victory at <a href="Battle_of_Novara_(1849)" title="wikilink">Novara</a> dashed the Italian hopes. Carlo Alberto had to abdicate and go into exile, and Piedmonst could no longer carry on the struggle.</p>
<h2 id="from-italy-to-baden">From Italy to Baden</h2>
<p>Under the terms of the ceasefire imposed on Piedmont, the Hungarian Legion (and a similar Polish Legion, also composed of deserters from the Austrian Army) were to be disbanded. Privates and NCO's up to the rank of sergeant-major were offered a pardon and a return home. This did not include the officers, but the Austrians did not object to their accepting commissions in the Piedmontese Army.</p>
<p>However, when T&lt;U+00FC&gt;rr put it to his men, they voted by acclamation to reject the Austrian pardon, stay together and leave Piedmont in search of a place whose revolution was still holding out. At first they set out for the <a href="Roman_Republic_(19th_century)" title="wikilink">Roman Republic</a>, but were blocked by the French forces besieging the city (thus, T&lt;U+00FC&gt;rr's meeting with <a href="Garibaldi" class="uri" title="wikilink">Garibaldi</a>, at this time directing Rome's defence, was delayed for ten years).</p>
<p>Next, the Hungarians entered France itself via <a href="Nice" class="uri" title="wikilink">Nice</a>, where they had to give up their arms and the authorities regarded them with considerable suspicion. The Hungarians, kept for a considerable time in <a href="Toulon" class="uri" title="wikilink">Toulon</a>, conceived the idea of going to the <a href="Ottoman_Empire" title="wikilink">Ottoman Empire</a>, where some Hungarians already got refuge (and many more would follow in the coming years). However, the French disliked this idea, attempting to send them instead to <a href="Algiers" class="uri" title="wikilink">Algiers</a> &lt;U+2013&gt; where, T&lt;U+00FC&gt;rr feared, the Hungarian Legion would &quot;melt down&quot;. He then decided to try heading to Britain, in the hope that from there it would be easier to get to Turkey.</p>
<p>Hearing of the revolutionary ferment at <a href="History_of_Baden#Revolution_of_1848/49" title="wikilink">Baden</a>, Germany, where &quot;the army had joined with the people to overthrow the monarchial government&quot;, T&lt;U+00FC&gt;rr decided to set out in that direction &lt;U+2013&gt; also in the hope of eventually returning to a liberated Hungary via Germany. Two contingents of the Hungarian Legion did manage to cross into Germany and reach Baden; a third was stopped by the French and diverted to <a href="Folkstone" class="uri" title="wikilink">Folkstone</a>, where the British put them on a ship headed to Turkey.</p>
<p>Bringing sorely needed reinforcements, T&lt;U+00FC&gt;rr was warmly welcomed in Baden, made immediately upon arrival a colonel in its revolutionary army, and got three battalions of German troops under his command in addition to the Hungarians who came with him. He did not hold this position long, however, as the Baden revolution soon succumbed to an overwhelming <a href="Prussia" title="wikilink">Prussian</a> attack. Together with the overthrown Baden Government, he and his troops had to seek refuge in Switzerland. The victors, in control of occupied Baden, were summarily executing those officers of the revolutionary army who fell into their hands.</p>
<p>In <a href="Berne" class="uri" title="wikilink">Berne</a> T&lt;U+00FC&gt;rr got the bitter news of the revolution being crushed in his own homeland, too, after prolonged fighting throughout Hungary. He was faced with the prospect of an exile life of indefinite duration, his life forfeit should he ever try to go home.</p>
<h2 id="sending-exiles-to-america">Sending exiles to America</h2>
<p>In the wake of the Hungarian Army's <a href="surrender_at_Vil&lt;U+00E1&gt;gos" title="wikilink">surrender at Vil&lt;U+00E1&gt;gos</a> (now <a href="&lt;U+015E&gt;iria,_Romania" title="wikilink">&lt;U+015E&gt;iria, Romania</a>) on August 13, 1849, the Austrians on the following month, September, renewed the offer of a free pardon to the men of the Hungarian Legion. This time, a considerable part of them accepted the offer &lt;U+2013&gt; &quot;tired of incessant fatigues and disappointments, and having lost all hope of ever being able to fight for their country's cause&quot; &lt;U+2013&gt; and went back to defeated Hungary.</p>
<p>The sympathetic <a href="Swiss_Federal_Council#Free_Democratic_hegemony,_1848&lt;U+2013&gt;1891" title="wikilink">Government of Switzerland</a> &lt;U+2013&gt; described by T&lt;U+00FC&gt;rr as &quot;always humane and noble minded&quot; &lt;U+2013&gt; financed and facilitated the sending the rest of the Hungarian soldiers to <a href="Hungarian_Americans" title="wikilink">America</a>. (This Federal Swiss government was newly installed, composed of the <a href="Free_Democratic_Party_of_Switzerland" title="wikilink">Radicals</a>, who won the Swiss <a href="civil_war" title="wikilink">civil war</a> two years earlier &lt;U+2013&gt; one of the few regimes established by the <a href="Revolutions_of_1848" title="wikilink">Revolutions of 1848</a> which remained in power, inclined to help the less fortunate revolutionary refugees.)</p>
<p>T&lt;U+00FC&gt;rr himself, dejected and in bad health, remained in Europe, alternating between Switzerland and Piedmont, and living on a pension which the <a href="Piedmont-Sardinia" title="wikilink">Piedmont-Sardinian</a> Government granted to him.</p>
<p>In October 1850, the above-mentioned Captain Lajos Winkler, who had fought at Venice, came over from <a href="Lombardy#History" title="wikilink">Lombardy</a>, in command of a party of about a hundred Hungarian privates which he had kept together under discipline. T&lt;U+00FC&gt;rr's 1856 brochure, mentioning this and other events of the 1850s,<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> does not relate where Winkler and his men had been and what they had been doing during the year since the fall of Venice; evidently, they had gotten the help of sympathetic Italians.</p>
<p>With the Hungarian fortunes at their nadir, T&lt;U+00FC&gt;rr and Winkler devised a plan of sailing with this troop to <a href="Montevideo" class="uri" title="wikilink">Montevideo</a>, to join the Liberal forces fighting against <a href="Juan_Manuel_de_Rosas" title="wikilink">Juan Manuel de Rosas</a> in the <a href="Uruguayan_Civil_War" title="wikilink">Uruguayan Civil War</a>. Since the 1830s, the prolonged struggle &lt;U+2013&gt; especially the perilous Siege of Montevideo &lt;U+2013&gt; gained the considerable support and sympathy of progressive Europeans, and it was there that <a href="Garibaldi" class="uri" title="wikilink">Garibaldi</a> first gained his reputation as a freedom fighter. With the European revolutions crushed, the war in Uruguay seemed to offer T&lt;U+00FC&gt;rr the only place where he could still &quot;contribute to the protection of freedom against oppression and tyranny&quot;.</p>
<p>Had T&lt;U+00FC&gt;rr carried out this plan, his subsequent career might have been considerably different. However, at <a href="Genoa" class="uri" title="wikilink">Genoa</a> they were faced with a firm Austrian demand for the extradition of the Hungarian deserters. To save them, T&lt;U+00FC&gt;rr falsely declared that they had all belonged to the former Piedmontese-Hungarian Legion which he had commanded and thus covered by the amnesty offered to these.</p>
<p>T&lt;U+00FC&gt;rr gained the Piedmontese Government's permission to take the Hungarian troops to Switzerland, whose friendly Federal Council in turn obtained French permission for them to go to America. As the Austrians had not completely given up their demands, T&lt;U+00FC&gt;rr personally conducted the exiled troops as they made their way on foot to <a href="Havre" class="uri" title="wikilink">Havre</a>, and saw them safely embarked to their destination.</p>
<p>From the Austrian point of view, the demand for the Hungarian troops' extradition turned out to be a serious blunder. Instead of letting T&lt;U+00FC&gt;rr neatly get rid of himself and devote his energies to Latin American struggles, the Austrians themselves ensured that he would stay on in Europe and become an increasingly disturbing thorn in the Habsburg Empire's side.</p>
<p>Many of the Hungarian &quot;<a href="Forty-Eighters" class="uri" title="wikilink">Forty-Eighters</a>&quot; who arrived in the US at this time are known to have later fought on the Union side in the <a href="American_Civil_War" title="wikilink">American Civil War</a>. The ones sent off by T&lt;U+00FC&gt;rr might have been among them.</p>
<h2 id="mazzinian-conspiracies-and-the-crimean-war">Mazzinian conspiracies and the Crimean War</h2>
<p>Between 1850 and 1853 the exile T&lt;U+00FC&gt;rr, facing execution as a deserter should he return to Hungary, moved between Switzerland, France, England and Piedmont.</p>
<p>In the early 1850s he became closely involved with fellow exile in <a href="Mazzini" title="wikilink">Mazzinian</a> conspiracies, such as the failed <a href="Milan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Milan</a> uprising of February 6, 1853.</p>
<p>Following the outbreak of the <a href="Crimean_War" title="wikilink">Crimean War</a> T&lt;U+00FC&gt;rr was also involved in the plan of <a href="Gy&lt;U+00F6&gt;rgy_Klapka" title="wikilink">Gy&lt;U+00F6&gt;rgy Klapka</a>, former War Minister of the 1848 revolutionary Hungarian government, to raise a force of Hungarian exiles to fight against Russia, whose intervention in 1848&lt;U+2013&gt;49 had tipped the scales against the Hungarian rebels.</p>
<p>Even before the Crimean War, a considerable number of exiled Hungarians had already taken service with the <a href="Ottoman_Empire" title="wikilink">Ottomans</a>, some reaching high positions without having to convert to Islam (see <a href="Islam_in_Hungary#Modern_era" title="wikilink">Islam in Hungary</a>). During the <a href="Siege_of_Kars" title="wikilink">Siege of Kars</a> in eastern Anatolia, Hungarian exiles took an active part in defending this border city against the invading Russians.</p>
<p>As T&lt;U+00FC&gt;rr would later disclose to Italian friends, supporting the Ottoman Empire against the Russian Empire was far less satisfactory to him than taking part in the Italian struggle for liberation. It was more in the nature of &quot;<em>serving one barbarism, out of the hatred of another barbarism</em>&quot;.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="arrest-by-the-austrians-court-martial-release">Arrest by the Austrians, court martial, release</h2>
<p>In 1855 T&lt;U+00FC&gt;rr was required to procure supplies for the British forces in the <a href="Danubian_Principalities" title="wikilink">Danubian Principalities</a>, at the time occupied by Austria though not annexed to the Habsburg Empire. He trusted to the protection of the British and to promises of safe-conduct by locally-stationed Austrian officers, which were apparently overruled by Vienna.</p>
<p>In <a href="Bucharest" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bucharest</a> T&lt;U+00FC&gt;rr was arrested and sent on to Kronstant (the present <a href="Brasov" class="uri" title="wikilink">Brasov</a>) where he was interrogated and court-martialed. Sentenced to death for desertion and treason (&quot;seeking to detach Italy and Hungary from Austrian rule&quot;), he was sentenced to death. However, the Emperor commuted his punishment to perpetual banishment, due to the strong British protests, apparently involving <a href="Queen_Victoria" title="wikilink">Queen Victoria</a> personally.</p>
<p>At the time, the whole affair got considerable press attention all over Europe, and on his release T&lt;U+00FC&gt;rr published a long and detailed account of it.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="disputed-british-naturalization">Disputed British naturalization</h2>
<p>It was in 1856, after this intervention to save him, that Turr asked for British citizenship. This was granted &lt;U+2013&gt; but his naturalization was thereafter strongly contested, as can be seen from a then-classified British document stating tersely:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Naturalization by certificate of secretary of state: Naturalization Act 1844: Certificate obtained by fraud: Colonel Etienne Turr. False statements as to residence and intention to reside. Law officers advised that certificate could not be revoked by secretary of state.</em><a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The document was declassified only thirty years later, and not given particular prominence even then. It does not seem to have influenced Turr's reputation.</p>
<h2 id="fighting-wounded-at-brescia">1859 fighting, wounded at Brescia</h2>
<p>With the outbreak of the <a href="Second_Italian_War_of_Independence" title="wikilink">Second Italian War of Independence</a> in 1859 T&lt;U+00FC&gt;rr returned to that country and joined <a href="Garibaldi" class="uri" title="wikilink">Garibaldi</a>'s volunteer unit <a href="Cacciatori_delle_Alpi" title="wikilink">Cacciatori delle Alpi</a> (&quot;Hunters of the Alps&quot;). Garibaldi held T&lt;U+00FC&gt;rr in great esteem and in one speech dubbed him &quot;The Fearless Hungarian&quot;.</p>
<p>On the circumstances of Turr's wounding on June 15, 1859, an eye-witness report is provided in a letter by Frank Leward, an English volunteer fighting with Garibaldi:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Col T&lt;U+00FC&gt;rr, an' Hungarian who hates the Austrians like sin, had been sent with a lot more of our men to <a href="Rezzato" class="uri" title="wikilink">Rezzato</a> a few miles from <a href="Brescia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Brescia</a> on the road to Preschiera and a battalion of Austrians came at them but T&lt;U+00FC&gt;rr sent them off and was so excited he followed them up too far and fell into a sort of ambuscade they had waiting for him and he got awfully cut up. However he managed to keep the enemy at bay for some time. Castenodolo the place was called I think [where] T&lt;U+00FC&gt;rr lost a heap of men</em>(...).</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>The General [Garibaldi] was in an awful stew, [he] made me go with him to Castenodolo. On the way we met T&lt;U+00FC&gt;rr badly wounded in an ambulance he was very bad but tried to sit up and sang out viva Italia then we met a lot more wounded being carried off</em>.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>

</figure>
<p>T&lt;U+00FC&gt;rr had completely recovered from his wounds by the next year (1860), when he again followed Garibaldi and took a major part in the <a href="Expedition_of_the_Thousand" title="wikilink">Expedition of the Thousand</a>.</p>
<p>The 500 <a href="Hungary" title="wikilink">Hungarians</a> led by T&lt;U+00FC&gt;rr &lt;U+2013&gt; helped by fellow exiles Adolf Mogy&lt;U+00F3&gt;rody, N&lt;U+00E1&gt;ndor &lt;U+00C9&gt;ber and Guszt&lt;U+00E1&gt;v Frigyesy &lt;U+2013&gt; were the largest contingent of foreign volunteers fighting with Garibaldi, alongside French, <a href="Poland" title="wikilink">Poles</a>, Swiss, German and other nationalities. Like the Hungarians, most of the other internationals were fighting with a view to follow up the liberation of Italy with that of their own countries from foreign or domestic tyranny (see <a href="International_Legion" title="wikilink">International Legion</a>).</p>
<p>In later parts of the campaign, as Garibaldi's campaign gathered momentum and many local recruits in Sicily and South Italy, T&lt;U+00FC&gt;rr was in command also of an increasing number of Italian troops.</p>
<p>In <a href="Talamone" class="uri" title="wikilink">Talamone</a>, en route to <a href="Sicily" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sicily</a>, Garibaldi promoted T&lt;U+00FC&gt;rr to General and included him in the General Staff formed for the expedition. After the capture of <a href="Palermo" class="uri" title="wikilink">Palermo</a>, T&lt;U+00FC&gt;rr led the force which went through the rugged Sicilian interior towards <a href="Messina" class="uri" title="wikilink">Messina</a>, while Garibladi himself went on along the island's north shore. After crossing to the mainland, T&lt;U+00FC&gt;rr led a force of 1,500 men towards <a href="Salerno" class="uri" title="wikilink">Salerno</a>.</p>
<p>Franco Catalano, analysing the <a href="Battle_of_Volturnus_(1860)" title="wikilink">Battle of Volturnus (1860)</a>, accuses Turr of &quot;reckleness&quot; which contributed to the initial Garibaldian defeats at <a href="Caiazzo" class="uri" title="wikilink">Caiazzo</a> and <a href="Castel_Morrone" title="wikilink">Castel Morrone</a> <a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> &lt;U+2013&gt; though the overall battle ended with Garibaldi's decisive victory, and at the time there were no recriminations.</p>
<p>In the aftermath of the fighting T&lt;U+00FC&gt;rr was appointed by Garibaldi as Governor of <a href="Naples" class="uri" title="wikilink">Naples</a>. In this role he conducted the plebiscite of October 21, 1860, in which the city's population voted overwhelmingly in favour of incorporation in the new <a href="Kingdom_of_Italy_(1861&lt;U+2013&gt;1946)" title="wikilink">Kingdom of Italy</a>.</p>
<p>During the famous meeting of Garibaldi with King <a href="Victor_Emmanuel_II" title="wikilink">Victor Emmanuel II</a> at <a href="Teano#The_&quot;Handshake_of_Teano&quot;" title="wikilink">Teano</a>, the king refused Garibaldi's request that the soldiers and officers who took part in the Expedition of the Thousand be taken into the Italian Army, and most of them were in fact dismissed. Garibaldi afterwards went back to his home in <a href="Caprera" class="uri" title="wikilink">Caprera</a>, and his later relations with the King and the royal government were often tense. However, the King not only confirmed T&lt;U+00FC&gt;rr's rank as a general, but also made him a royal <a href="aide-de-camp" class="uri" title="wikilink">aide-de-camp</a>, and subsequently entrusted to T&lt;U+00FC&gt;rr the handling of some sensitive diplomatic matters. Despite this divergence of political courses, however, T&lt;U+00FC&gt;rr remained on highly cordial and friendly relations with Garibaldi until the Italian revolutionary's death in 1882.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, back in Austrian-ruled Hungary, the city of <a href="Debrecen" class="uri" title="wikilink">Debrecen</a> on February 6, 1861, declared T&lt;U+00FC&gt;rr &lt;U+2013&gt; as well as Kossuth, Klapka and other exiled nationalists &lt;U+2013&gt; to be its honorary citizen. This was an act of defiance, as at the time T&lt;U+00FC&gt;rr stood to be executed out of hand had he attempted to arrive at the city whose honorary citizen he became,<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="wedding-and-the-napoleonic-connection">Wedding and the Napoleonic connection</h2>
<p>On September 10, 1861 T&lt;U+00FC&gt;rr married in <a href="Mantova" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mantova</a> Adelina Bonaparte Wyse (1838&lt;U+2013&gt;1899), granddaughter of <a href="Lucien_Bonaparte" title="wikilink">Lucien Bonaparte</a>, the brother of the Emperor Napoleon &lt;U+2013&gt; which made her a cousin of the then Emperor <a href="Napoleon_III" title="wikilink">Napoleon III</a> of France <a href="http://www.geneall.net/U/per_page.php?id=110088">10</a>. (Her parents were Sir <a href="Thomas_Wyse" title="wikilink">Thomas Wyse</a>, British Minister to Athens, and Princess Maria Letizia Bonaparte, Lucien Bonaparte's daughter).</p>
<p>Moreover, Adelina's sister, <a href="Laetitia_Marie_Wyse_Bonaparte" title="wikilink">Laetitia Marie Wyse Bonaparte</a>, married in the same year the Piedmontese statesman <a href="Urbano_Rattazzi" title="wikilink">Urbano Rattazzi</a> &lt;U+2013&gt; Italian Prime Minister several times during the 1860s &lt;U+2013&gt; who thus became T&lt;U+00FC&gt;rr's brother in law.</p>
<p>T&lt;U+00FC&gt;rr is mentioned as having, with the help of his wife, with her help, carried out an extensive diplomatic activity. Among other things, both of them are known to have conducted extensive correspondence with <a href="Prince_Napoleon" title="wikilink">Prince Napoleon</a>, the Emperor's cousin and advisor, a proponent of the anti-Clerical forces in the French imperial court and opponent of the policy of letting French troops preserve the Pope's <a href="Temporal_power_(Papal)" title="wikilink">temporal power</a> over Rome <a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<p>Istv&lt;U+00E1&gt;n T&lt;U+00FC&gt;rr and his wife had one son, Raoul T&lt;U+00FC&gt;rr (1865&lt;U+2013&gt;1906).</p>
<h2 id="pallanza-dignitary">Pallanza Dignitary</h2>
<p>In October 1862, T&lt;U+00FC&gt;rr acquired from the Milanese Carlo Lattuada a villa in <a href="Pallanza" class="uri" title="wikilink">Pallanza</a>, described as &quot;an elegant dwelling with a garden facing the lake&quot; (i.e. <a href="Lake_Maggiore" title="wikilink">Lake Maggiore</a>).</p>
<p>The T&lt;U+00FC&gt;rrs immediately became prominent figures in the town's social life, as seen in repeated reports in the local paper, the &quot;<em>Il Lago Maggiore</em>&quot;. The return after a visit to France of &quot;The Valorous Hungarian General and his Most Beautiful and Amiable Consort, Princess Bonaparte&quot; was a major local news item. The couple were hosted and feted by the town's dignitaries &lt;U+2013&gt; sub-prefect, municipal councillors and the commander of the local National Guard &lt;U+2013&gt; with a civic band playing various pieces, prominently ones associated with Garibaldi.</p>
<p>The T&lt;U+00FC&gt;rrs also took considerable interest in the lower classes. T&lt;U+00FC&gt;rr became the Honorary President of the local Labourers' Society (Societ&lt;U+00E0&gt; Operaia di Pallanza) and gave donations to be distributed among the needy. On November 4, 1862, the paper noted with regret that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>(...)Now that the summer is over, the T&lt;U+00FC&gt;rr Family has left and are not expected back until next spring. They carry with them the esteem and affection of the townspeople, who have come to appreciate their rare qualities. Before her departure, Mrs. Adelina T&lt;U+00FC&gt;rr insisted upon visiting the orphanages, where the children greeted her with a most abundant dose of confetti. It was wonderful to see this scion of one of the greatest and most powerful families of Europe caress and kiss the sons of our labourers, and make the effort of conversing with them in their Pallanzese dialect.</em><a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In 1876, the Pallanza villa was sold to Cesar Bozzotti &lt;U+2013&gt; apparently due to T&lt;U+00FC&gt;rr being able to return to Hungary after 1867 (see below) and therefore spending less time in Italy.</p>
<h2 id="romanian-negotiations">Romanian Negotiations</h2>
<p>In 1863 T&lt;U+00FC&gt;rr returned to the <a href="Romanian_Principalities" title="wikilink">Romanian Principalities</a>, now under the government of <a href="Alexandru_Ioan_Cuza" title="wikilink">Alexandru Ioan Cuza</a>, who had shown some sympathy to the Hungarian exiles. Following upon an earlier (1861) delegation headed by Klapka, T&lt;U+00FC&gt;rr sought an agreement on establishing Hungarian weapons and supplies depots on Moldavian soil, with a view to a new uprising against Habsburg rule.</p>
<p>In case of their independence being achieved, the Hungarians promised &quot;a full autonomy&quot; to the Romanian population of <a href="Transylvania" class="uri" title="wikilink">Transylvania</a>. Nevertheless, disagreement on the Question of Transylvania prevented T&lt;U+00FC&gt;rr and his fellows from reaching an agreement.</p>
<p>At the time, T&lt;U+00FC&gt;rr was a confidential adviser to Italian King Vittorio Emanuele. With <a href="Venetia_(region)" title="wikilink">Venetia</a> still held by the Austrians and a new war a distinct possibility, it was clearly in Italy's interest to have a Hungarian rebellion open a second front for the Austrians.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="planned-hungarian-uprising-in-1866">Planned Hungarian uprising in 1866</h2>
<p>In 1866, in coordination with the <a href="Third_Italian_War_of_Independence" title="wikilink">Third Italian War of Independence</a> and Garibaldi's campaign against the Austrians in the <a href="Trentino" class="uri" title="wikilink">Trentino</a>, T&lt;U+00FC&gt;rr was assigned to prepare an uprising in Hungary involving <a href="Gy&lt;U+00F6&gt;rgy_Klapka" title="wikilink">Gy&lt;U+00F6&gt;rgy Klapka</a> and other Hungarian exiles. It was supposed to be launched from <a href="Serbia" title="wikilink">Serbian</a> territory, but &lt;U+2013&gt; due to the fast ending of the <a href="Prussian-Austrian_War" title="wikilink">Prussian-Austrian War</a> including its Italian part &lt;U+2013&gt; never came to implementation, and the next year's developments rendered all such plans moot.</p>

<p>Defeat in the war forced the Emperor <a href="Franz_Josef" title="wikilink">Franz Josef</a> to grant a Liberal Constitution as well as a <a href="Austro-Hungarian_Compromise_of_1867" title="wikilink">renewed autonomy for the ancient Kingfom of Hungary</a>; the unitary Austria became the dual <a href="Austro-Hungary" class="uri" title="wikilink">Austro-Hungary</a>. The changed political climate also included an amnesty for exiles such as T&lt;U+00FC&gt;rr, who could at last return to his homeland.</p>
<p>Not long after his return T&lt;U+00FC&gt;rr &lt;U+2013&gt; no longer an implacable foe of Austrian interests &lt;U+2013&gt; was informally involved in (ultimately unsuccessful) negotiations aimed at creating an alliance between Austria, Italy and France.</p>
<h2 id="canal-architect-and-engineer">Canal Architect and Engineer</h2>
<p>Though often referred to as &quot;General T&lt;U+00FC&gt;rr&quot; until the end of his life, in practice T&lt;U+00FC&gt;rr did not take up an active military or political career in Hungary. Rather, he chose to devote his later years to working as a canal architect and engineer.</p>
<p>Using his wide international experience and personal contacts, he was a leading proponent of the building of navigation canals and river navigation systems in Hungary.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> On the basis of his international experience, T&lt;U+00FC&gt;rr was charged with &lt;U+00E9&gt;laborating a plan for navigable canals connecting the <a href="Danube" class="uri" title="wikilink">Danube</a> and <a href="Tisza" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tisza</a> rivers.</p>
<p>T&lt;U+00FC&gt;rr was deeply involved with the <a href="Panama_Canal" title="wikilink">Panama Canal</a> at its earlier stage, being himself the President of the &quot;Societe Civile Internationale du Canal Interoceanique&quot; which proposed to build it.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> In 1876 T&lt;U+00FC&gt;rr as well as <a href="B&lt;U+00E9&gt;la_Gerster" title="wikilink">B&lt;U+00E9&gt;la Gerster</a>, a younger Hungarian engineer who would be his partner in later projects &lt;U+2013&gt; accompanied <a href="Ferdinand_Lesseps" title="wikilink">Ferdinand Marie de Lesseps</a> in an international expedition with the task of locating the most suitable route of an interoceanic canal that would eventually become the <a href="Panama_Canal" title="wikilink">Panama Canal</a>.</p>
<p>However, T&lt;U+00FC&gt;rr was no longer involved in later stages of the French Panama project, having shifted his interest and gave his full attention to another canal, closer to home (see below). This saved T&lt;U+00FC&gt;rr from public responsibility for the fiasco of the collapse of French Panama project and the appalling loss of thousands of workers to disease at Panama.</p>
<p>After 1881 T&lt;U+00FC&gt;rr &lt;U+2013&gt; together with Gerster &lt;U+2013&gt; were involved with the Greek Government's major project of planning and implementing the <a href="Corinth_Canal" title="wikilink">Corinth Canal</a> &lt;U+2013&gt; a project which gained considerable international attention. In his 1883 travel book, &quot;To the Gold Coast for Gold&quot;, <a href="Richard_Burton" title="wikilink">Richard Burton</a> mentioned meeting &quot;that talented and energetic soldier, General T&lt;U+00FC&gt;rr&quot; in <a href="Venice" class="uri" title="wikilink">Venice</a>, and predicted that the hitherto impoverished <a href="Patras" class="uri" title="wikilink">Patras</a> &quot;will have a fine time when [T&lt;U+00FC&gt;rr] begins the piercing of the Isthmus.&quot;</p>
<p>In 1888, the company constructing the canal failed, putting the project's completion in danger. T&lt;U+00FC&gt;rr the led a successful effort to get governments and individuals to invest further sums &lt;U+2013&gt; so that on August 6, 1893, <a href="King_George_I_of_Greece" title="wikilink">King George I of Greece</a> and his wife, <a href="Olga_Constantinovna_of_Russia" title="wikilink">Queen Olga</a> could solemnly inaugurate the artificial waterway.</p>
<p>Also in partnership with Gerster, T&lt;U+00FC&gt;rr formulated monumental plans of water-supply engineering in Hungary itself. As well as promoting the canalization of the <a href="Danube" class="uri" title="wikilink">Danube</a> he was distinguished for supporting the newborn Hungarian national industry.</p>
<h2 id="s-transylvania-controversy">1890's Transylvania Controversy</h2>
<p>Like other Hungarian Nationalists, T&lt;U+00FC&gt;rr in his later years was mainly concerned, not with confronting Austrian rule &lt;U+2013&gt; a goal mostly if not completely achieved through the compromise of 1867 &lt;U+2013&gt; but in preserving Hungarian territory and interests against the demands of other nationalities.</p>
<p>In particular, T&lt;U+00FC&gt;rr was opposed to the <a href="Transylvanian_Memorandum" title="wikilink">Transylvanian Memorandum</a> movement of 1892, whose initiators demanded greater autonomy for Romanians &lt;U+2013&gt; a demand seen as the prelude for altogether detaching <a href="Transylvania" class="uri" title="wikilink">Transylvania</a> from Hungarian rule, and therefore causing the Manifesto's organisers to be imprisoned by the Hungarian authorities.</p>
<p>In 1894&lt;U+2013&gt;95 T&lt;U+00FC&gt;rr published articles condemning the <em>Memorandum</em> participants and their Bucharest-based partisans.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> One of the latter, <a href="V._A._Urechia" title="wikilink">V. A. Urechia</a>, answered in kind in a series of articles of his own, debating T&lt;U+00FC&gt;rr on the pages of the European press and in various international forums.</p>
<h2 id="the-pacifist-general-of-the-universal-peace-congresses">&quot;The Pacifist General&quot; of the Universal Peace Congresses</h2>
<p>In 1878 the International Peace Congress (&quot;Congr&lt;U+00E8&gt;s International de la Paix&quot;) was held in Paris, bringing together a great a variety of peace activists from all over Europe to debate ways of working to prevent war. One of the organizers, the Swiss Valentine de Sellon who would later write a book on the congress <a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> noted with great satisfaction the participation of workers and women, and &quot;even [of] a former general&quot;.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> The former general referred to was Istv&lt;U+00E1&gt;n T&lt;U+00FC&gt;rr.</p>
<p>From that time until his death, T&lt;U+00FC&gt;rr would increasingly become known in the role of &quot;The Pacifist General&quot;, who became &quot;a prominent personality of the international peace movement&quot;.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> In the 1890s, T&lt;U+00FC&gt;rr was &quot;a regular fixture&quot; in the annual <a href="Universal_Peace_Congress" title="wikilink">Universal Peace Congresses</a>, held every year at a different location. In 1896 he was elected President of the Seventh Congress, held at <a href="Budapest" class="uri" title="wikilink">Budapest</a>.</p>
<p>The well-known Austrian pacifist <a href="Bertha_Von_Suttner" title="wikilink">Bertha Von Suttner</a> recalls in her memoires the great impression of meeting, on that occasion, &quot;the old warrior, General T&lt;U+00FC&gt;rr&quot; (he was seventy one at the time) and hearing from him that &quot;he had seen so much of war that he came to throughly detest it&quot;.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a></p>
<p>T&lt;U+00FC&gt;rr recalled &lt;U+2013&gt; and Von Suttner later published &lt;U+2013&gt; some horrors which he had witnessed during the <a href="Expedition_of_the_Thousand" title="wikilink">Expedition of the Thousand</a>, and which had not been published in 1860 itself. For example, entering a village and discovering the bodies of Bourbon soldiers who had been burned to death by the inhabitants. When Garibaldi became extremely furious with the villagers for having perpetrated such an act, they responded that it was done in retaliation for the soldiers having earlier set on fire houses in the village and prevented their inhabitants from escaping.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="yellow-peril-and-the-boxer-rebellion">&quot;Yellow Peril&quot; and The Boxer Rebellion</h2>
<p>T&lt;U+00FC&gt;rr was the first person known to have used in public the term &quot;The <a href="Yellow_Peril" title="wikilink">Yellow Peril</a>&quot; (<a href="http://passingstrangeness.wordpress.com/2009/04/20/the-yellow-peril/">19</a>). He used it in June 1895; in an article mainly concerned with <a href="Otto_von_Bismark" title="wikilink">Otto von Bismark</a>, there was a passage referring to Japan's recent victory over China where T&lt;U+00FC&gt;rr remarked: &quot;The 'yellow peril' is more threatening than ever. Japan has made in a few years as much progress as other nations have made in centuries.&quot; This was widely re-published and translated throughout the world (the quotation here is from the text published at the time in a <a href="Ohio" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ohio</a> paper, <a href="The_Sandusky_Register" title="wikilink">The Sandusky Register</a>)<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a></p>
<p>A few months later, on September 1895, <a href="Kaiser_Wilhelm_II" title="wikilink">Kaiser Wilhelm II</a> took up the term and made extensive use of it, being indeed often credited as its originator. As interpreted by the German Emperor (and subsequently, by many others) this implied a concrete threat by &quot;Yellow Hordes&quot; in the Far East, poised to invade and overwhelm the West by sheer numbers. This attitude to &quot;Yellow-skinned people&quot; had very concrete results in Wilhelm, a few years later, explicitly exhorting German troops involved in putting down the <a href="Boxer_Rebellion" title="wikilink">Boxer Rebellion</a> in China to particularly ruthless and cruel conduct.</p>
<p>There is, however, no record of T&lt;U+00FC&gt;rr sharing such attitudes. In fact, &quot;General Etienne Turr, Buda&quot; is duly noted in the list of participants at the Tenth <a href="Peace_congress#Universal_Peace_Congress" title="wikilink">Universal Peace Congress</a> held at <a href="Glasgow" class="uri" title="wikilink">Glasgow</a> in 1901, where that Western expedition against the <a href="Boxer_Rebellion" title="wikilink">Boxer Rebellion</a>, in the previous year, was strongly condemned. In that gathering, Dr. Spence Watson got applause when stating at the podium that &quot;<em>The swooping down of the Christian nations on China [was] the most detestable bit of greed that history records</em>&quot;. The conference as a whole adopted resolutions clearly condemning that Western intervention in China (though in milder terms) and stating that defence of Western missionaries active in non-European countries, or of connverts to Christianity, was no an acceptable reason for waging war.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a></p>
<p>The transcript does not record, however, any speech made by T&lt;U+00FC&gt;rr himself, who was 76 years old at the time and had recently lost his wife.</p>
<h2 id="last-years">Last years</h2>
<p>T&lt;U+00FC&gt;rr's wife Adelina died on July 8, 1899 at <a href="Berck" class="uri" title="wikilink">Berck</a>, France. His son Raoul predeceased him and died in 1906.</p>
<p>In his last years T&lt;U+00FC&gt;rr spent much of his time in Paris. He died in <a href="Budapest" class="uri" title="wikilink">Budapest</a> on May 3, 1908.</p>
<p>He was survived by his granddaughter Maria Stephanie T&lt;U+00FC&gt;rr (1895 &lt;U+2013&gt; 1994) <a href="http://www.geneall.net/U/per_page.php?id=110090">23</a>.</p>
<p>Today there are only a few desendence of Istv&lt;U+00E1&gt;n T&lt;U+00FC&gt;rr and the grandgaughter of Lucien Bonaparte, Adelina. A small family living in Germany.</p>
