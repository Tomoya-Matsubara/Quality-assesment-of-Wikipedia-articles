<p>Gilbert was born at 17 Southampton Street, Strand, London. His father, also named <a href="William_Gilbert_(author)" title="wikilink">William</a>, was a naval surgeon who later became a novelist and short story writer. Some of his books were illustrated by his son. Gilbert's mother was the former Ann Morris. Gilbert's parents were distant and stern, and he did not have a particularly close relationship with either of them. Following the breakup of their marriage in 1876, his relationships with them, especially with his mother, became even more strained. Gilbert had three younger sisters: Jane, Maud, and Florence.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p>As a child, Gilbert traveled in Europe with his parents (they finally settled in London in 1849), and was educated at <a href="Boulogne" class="uri" title="wikilink">Boulogne</a>, France (he later kept his diary in French so that the servants could not read it),<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> and then at the Great Ealing School and <a href="King&#39;s_College_London" title="wikilink">King's College London</a>, graduating in 1856. He applied for a military commission in the <a href="Gordon_Highlanders" title="wikilink">Gordon Highlanders</a>, but, with the unexpected end of the <a href="Crimean_War" title="wikilink">Crimean War</a>, fewer recruits were needed, and only a line commission was available to Gilbert. He served in the Civil Service instead for four years and hated it. In 1859, he joined the newly formed <a href="Volunteer_Army_(British)" title="wikilink">Volunteer Army</a>, continuing with them until 1878 (in between writing and other work), and reaching the rank of Captain.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> Finally, in 1863, he received a bequest of &lt;U+00A3&gt;300 that he used to quit the civil service and take up a brief career as a <a href="barrister" class="uri" title="wikilink">barrister</a>, but he was not successful, averaging just five clients a year.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> <img src="Gentle_Alice_Brown.jpg" title="fig:One of Gilbert&#39;s illustrations for his Bab Ballad &quot;Gentle Alice Brown&quot;." alt="One of Gilbert&#39;s illustrations for his Bab Ballad &quot;Gentle Alice Brown&quot;." width="225" /></p>
<p>To supplement his income from 1861 on, Gilbert wrote a variety of stories, comic rants, theatre reviews (many in the form of a parody of the play being reviewed),<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> and, under the pseudonym &quot;Bab&quot; (his childhood nickname), illustrated poems for several comic magazines, primarily <em>Fun</em>, started in 1861 by <a href="Henry_James_Byron" title="wikilink">H. J. Byron</a>. The poems, illustrated humourously by Gilbert, proved immensely popular and were reprinted in book form as the <em><a href="Bab_Ballads" title="wikilink">Bab Ballads</a></em>.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> He would later return to many of these as source material for his various plays and comic operas. Gilbert and his colleagues from <em>Fun</em>, including <a href="Thomas_William_Robertson" title="wikilink">Tom Robertson</a>, <a href="Tom_Hood" title="wikilink">Tom Hood</a>, <a href="Clement_Scott" title="wikilink">Clement Scott</a> and <a href="F._C._Burnand" title="wikilink">F. C. Burnand</a> (who defected to <em><a href="Punch_(magazine)" title="wikilink">Punch</a></em> in 1862) frequented the Arundel Club, the <a href="Savage_Club" title="wikilink">Savage Club</a>, and especially Evans's caf&lt;U+00E9&gt;, where they had a table in competition with the <em>Punch</em> &quot;Round table&quot;.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<p>Gilbert married Lucy Agnes Turner in 1867 (she was 11 years younger than he). He wrote many affectionate letters to her over the years. In addition, Gilbert and Lucy were socially active both in London and later at Grim's Dyke, often holding dinner parties and being invited to others' homes for dinner, in contrast to the picture painted by fictionalizations like the film <em><a href="Topsy-Turvy" class="uri" title="wikilink">Topsy-Turvy</a></em>.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="first-plays">First plays</h3>
<p>Gilbert wrote and directed a number of plays at school, but his first professionally produced play was <em>Uncle Baby</em>, which ran for seven weeks in the fall of 1863.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> His next produced work, <em><a href="Dulcamara,_or_the_Little_Duck_and_the_Great_Quack" title="wikilink">Dulcamara, or the Little Duck and the Great Quack</a></em> (an 1866 <a href="burlesque" class="uri" title="wikilink">burlesque</a> of <a href="Gaetano_Donizetti" title="wikilink">Gaetano Donizetti</a>'s <em><a href="L&#39;elisir_d&#39;amore" title="wikilink">L'elisir d'amore</a></em>), was Gilbert's first commercial success, rushed to the stage in 10 days at the request of his friend Tom Robertson. <em>Dulcamara</em>'s popularity ensured a long series of further burlesques, <a href="pantomime" title="wikilink">pantomimes</a> and farces, full of awful puns (traditional in burlesques of the period),<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> though they do, at times, show signs of the satire that would later be a defining part of his work.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> For instance:</p>

<p>Theatre, at the time Gilbert began writing, had fallen into disrepute. Badly translated and adapted French <a href="operetta" title="wikilink">operettas</a> and poorly written, prurient <a href="burlesque" title="wikilink">burlesques</a> dominated the London stage. As <a href="Jessie_Bond" title="wikilink">Jessie Bond</a> vividly described it, &quot;stilted tragedy and vulgar farce were all the would-be playgoer had to choose from, and the theatre had become a place of evil repute to the righteous British householder.&quot;<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>
<p>From 1869 to 1875, Gilbert joined with one of the leading figures in theatrical reform, <a href="Thomas_German_Reed" title="wikilink">Thomas German Reed</a> (and his wife), whose <a href="German_Reed_Entertainment" title="wikilink">Gallery of Illustration</a> sought to regain some of theatre's lost respectability by offering family entertainments in London.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> Three months before the opening of Gilbert's last burlesque (<em>The Pretty Druidess</em>), the first of his pieces for the Gallery of Illustration, <em><a href="No_Cards" title="wikilink">No Cards</a></em>, was produced. Gilbert created six musical entertainments for the German Reeds, some with music composed by Thomas German Reed himself.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a></p>
<p>The environment of the German Reeds' intimate theatre allowed Gilbert quickly to develop a personal style and freedom to control all aspects of production, including set, costumes, direction and stage management.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> These works were a success,<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> with Gilbert's first big hit at the Gallery of Illustration, <em><a href="Ages_Ago" title="wikilink">Ages Ago</a></em>, opening in 1869. <em>Ages Ago</em> was also the beginning of a collaboration with the composer <a href="Frederic_Clay" title="wikilink">Frederic Clay</a> that would last seven years and produce four works.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> It was at a rehearsal for <em>Ages Ago</em> that Clay formally introduced Gilbert to his friend, <a href="Arthur_Sullivan" title="wikilink">Arthur Sullivan</a>.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a></p>
<p>Many of the plot elements of the German Reed Entertainments (as well as some from his earlier plays and Bab Ballads) would be reused by Gilbert later in the <a href="Gilbert_and_Sullivan" title="wikilink">Gilbert and Sullivan</a> operas. These elements include paintings coming to life (<em>Ages Ago</em>, used again in <em><a href="Ruddigore" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ruddigore</a></em>), the forceful mature lady who is &quot;an acquired taste&quot; (<em><a href="Eyes_and_No_Eyes" title="wikilink">Eyes and No Eyes</a></em>, reused in <em><a href="The_Mikado" title="wikilink">The Mikado</a></em>), and a deaf nursemaid binding a respectable man's son to a &quot;pirate&quot; instead of to a &quot;pilot&quot; by mistake (<em><a href="Our_Island_Home" title="wikilink">Our Island Home</a></em>, 1870, reused in <em><a href="The_Pirates_of_Penzance" title="wikilink">The Pirates of Penzance</a></em>).<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> During this time, Gilbert perfected the &quot;topsy-turvy&quot; style that he had been developing in his Bab Ballads, where the humour was derived by setting up a ridiculous premise and working out its logical consequences, however absurd.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a></p>
<p>At the same time, Gilbert created several &quot;fairy comedies&quot; at the <a href="Haymarket_Theatre" title="wikilink">Haymarket Theatre</a>. This series of plays was founded upon the idea of self-revelation by characters under the influence of some magic or some supernatural interference.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> The first was <em><a href="The_Palace_of_Truth" title="wikilink">The Palace of Truth</a></em> (1870), based on a story by <a href="Madame_de_Genlis" title="wikilink">Madame de Genlis</a>. In 1871, with <em><a href="Pygmalion_and_Galatea" title="wikilink">Pygmalion and Galatea</a></em>, one of seven plays that he produced that year, Gilbert scored his greatest hit to date. Together, these plays and their successors such as <em>The Wicked World</em> (1873), <em>Sweethearts</em> (1874) and <em><a href="Broken_Hearts" title="wikilink">Broken Hearts</a></em> (1875), did for Gilbert on the dramatic stage what the German Reed entertainments had done for him on the musical stage: they established that his capabilities extended far beyond burlesque, won him artistic credentials, and demonstrated that he was a writer of wide range, as comfortable with human drama as with farcical humour. The success of these plays, especially <em>Pygmalion and Galatea</em>, gave Gilbert a prestige that would be crucial to his later collaboration with as respected a musician as Sullivan.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a></p>
<p>Though dated, these works demonstrate Gilbert's desire to give respectable and well-educated theatre audiences comedies that were more refined and tasteful than the usual farces and burlesques playing in London.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> On the other hand, during the same period, Gilbert pushed the boundaries of how far satire could go in the theatre. He collaborated with <a href="Gilbert_Arthur_&lt;U+00E0&gt;_Beckett" title="wikilink">Gilbert Arthur &lt;U+00E0&gt; Beckett</a> on <em>The Happy Land</em> (1873), a political satire (in part, a parody of his own <em>The Wicked World</em>), which was briefly banned because of its unflattering caricatures of <a href="William_Ewart_Gladstone" title="wikilink">Gladstone</a> and his ministers.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> Similarly, <em>The Realm of Joy</em> (1873) was set in the lobby of a theatre performing a scandalous play (in the <em>Happy Land</em> mold), with many jokes at the expense of the <a href="Lord_Chamberlain" title="wikilink">Lord Chamberlain</a> (the &quot;Lord High Disinfectant&quot;, as he's referred to in the play), and two men having an affair with the other man's wife.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> In <em><a href="Charity_(play)" title="wikilink">Charity</a></em> (1874), however, Gilbert uses the freedom of the stage in a different way: to provide a tightly-written critique of the contrasting ways in which Victorian society treated men and women who had sex outside of marriage, which anticipated the &quot;problem plays&quot; of <a href="George_Bernard_Shaw" title="wikilink">Shaw</a> and <a href="Henrik_Ibsen" title="wikilink">Ibsen</a>.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a></p>

<p>Gilbert was the stage director for his plays and operas and had strong opinions on how they should best be performed. Gilbert was strongly influenced by the innovations in &quot;stagecraft&quot;, or what we now call stage direction, by the playwrights <a href="James_Planche" title="wikilink">James Planche</a> and especially <a href="Thomas_William_Robertson" title="wikilink">Tom Robertson</a>.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> Gilbert attended rehearsals directed by Robertson to learn this art firsthand from the older director, and he began to apply it in some of his earliest plays.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> He sought realism in acting, if not in content of his plays, shunned interaction with the audience, and insisted on a standard of characterisation where the characters were never aware of their own absurdity, but were coherent internal wholes.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> In Gilbert's burlesque, <em>Rosencratz and Guildenstern</em> (1874), the character Hamlet, in his speech to the players, sums up Gilbert's theory of comic acting: &quot;I hold that there is no such antick fellow as your bombastical hero who doth so earnestly spout forth his folly as to make his hearers believe that he is unconscious of all incongruity&quot;. With his work along these lines, Gilbert set the ground for later playwrights such as <a href="George_Bernard_Shaw" title="wikilink">George Bernard Shaw</a> and <a href="Oscar_Wilde" title="wikilink">Oscar Wilde</a> to be able to flourish on the English stage.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a></p>
<p>Gilbert insisted that his actors knew their words perfectly and obeyed his stage directions, which was something quite new to many actors of the day.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> Even during long runs and revivals, Gilbert closely supervised the performances of his plays, making sure that the actors did not make unauthorised additions, deletions or paraphrases.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> Gilbert was famous for demonstrating the action himself, even as he grew older.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> Gilbert himself went on stage in a number of productions throughout his lifetime, including several performances as &quot;the Associate&quot; in the <em><a href="Trial_by_Jury" title="wikilink">Trial by Jury</a></em>, as substitute for an ailing actor in his play <em><a href="Broken_Hearts" title="wikilink">Broken Hearts</a></em>, and in charity matinees of his one-act plays, such as King Claudius in <em>Rosencrantz and Guildenstern</em>.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a></p>

<p><img src="Sullivan-GS.jpg" title="fig:Sir Arthur Seymour Sullivan" alt="Sir Arthur Seymour Sullivan" /> In <a href="1871" class="uri" title="wikilink">1871</a>, John Hollingshead commissioned Gilbert to work with Sullivan on a holiday piece for Christmas, <em><a href="Thespis_(opera)" title="wikilink">Thespis, or The Gods Grown Old</a></em>, at the <a href="Gaiety_Theatre,_London" title="wikilink">Gaiety Theatre</a>. <em>Thespis</em> outran five of its nine competitors for the 1871 holiday season and was later revived for a benefit performance. However, nothing more came of it at that point, and Gilbert and Sullivan went their separate ways. Gilbert worked again with Clay on <em><a href="Happy_Arcadia" title="wikilink">Happy Arcadia</a></em> (1872), and with <a href="Alfred_Cellier" title="wikilink">Alfred Cellier</a> on <em><a href="Topsyturveydom" class="uri" title="wikilink">Topsyturveydom</a></em> (1874), as well as writing several farces, operetta libretti, extravaganzas, fairy comedies, adaptations from novels, translations from the French, and the dramas described above. Also in 1874, he published his last contibution for <em>Fun</em> magazine (<em>&quot;Rosencratz and Guildenstern&quot;</em>), after a gap of three years, then resigned due to disapproval of the new owner's other publishing interests.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a></p>
<p>It would be nearly four years after <em>Thespis</em> was produced before the two men worked together again. In 1868, Gilbert had published a short comedic piece entitled &quot;Trial by Jury: An Operetta&quot;. In 1873, Gilbert arranged with the theatrical manager and composer, <a href="Carl_Rosa" title="wikilink">Carl Rosa</a>, to expand the piece into a one-act libretto. Rosa's wife was to sing the role of the plaintiff. However, Rosa's wife died in childbirth in 1874. Later in 1874 Gilbert offered the libretto to <a href="Richard_D&#39;Oyly_Carte" title="wikilink">Richard D'Oyly Carte</a>, but Carte could not use the piece at that time. By early 1875, Carte was managing the <a href="Royalty_Theatre" title="wikilink">Royalty Theatre</a>, and he needed a short opera to be played as an afterpiece to <a href="Offenbach" class="uri" title="wikilink">Offenbach</a>'s <em><a href="La_P&lt;U+00E9&gt;richole" title="wikilink">La P&lt;U+00E9&gt;richole</a></em>. He contacted Gilbert, asked about the piece, and suggested Sullivan to set the work. Sullivan was enthusiastic, and <em><a href="Trial_by_Jury" title="wikilink">Trial by Jury</a></em> was composed in a matter of weeks. The little piece was a runaway hit, outlasting the run of <em>La P&lt;U+00E9&gt;richole</em> and being revived at another theatre.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> <img src="Ws_gilbert_cartoon.png" title="fig:Caricature from Punch, 1881" alt="Caricature from Punch, 1881" /></p>
<p>Gilbert continued his quest to gain respect in and respectability for his profession. One thing that may have been holding dramatists back from respectability was that plays were not published in a form suitable for a &quot;gentleman's library&quot;, as, at the time, they were generally cheaply and unattractively published for the use of actors rather than the home reader. To help rectify this, at least for himself, Gilbert arranged in late 1875 for publishers Chatto and Windus to print a volume of his plays in a format designed to appeal to the general reader, with an attractive binding and clear type, containing Gilbert's most respectable plays, including his most serious works, but mischievously capped off with <em>Trial by Jury</em>.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a></p>
<p>After the success of <em>Trial by Jury</em>, there were discussions towards reviving <em>Thespis</em>, but Gilbert and Sullivan were not able to agree on terms with Carte and his backers. The score to <em>Thespis</em> was never published, and most of the music is now lost. It took some time for Carte to gather funds for another Gilbert and Sullivan opera, and in this gap Gilbert produced several works including <em><a href="Tom_Cobb" title="wikilink">Tom Cobb</a></em> (1875), <em><a href="Eyes_and_No_Eyes" title="wikilink">Eyes and No Eyes</a></em> (1875, his last German Reed Entertainment), and <em><a href="Princess_Toto" title="wikilink">Princess Toto</a></em> (1876), his last and most ambitious work with Clay, a three-act comic opera with full orchestra, as opposed to the shorter works for much reduced accompaniment that came before. Gilbert also wrote two serious works during this time, <em><a href="Broken_Hearts" title="wikilink">Broken Hearts</a></em> (1875) and <em>Dan'l Druce, Blacksmith</em> (1877).<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a></p>
<p>Also during this period, Gilbert wrote his most successful comic play, <em><a href="Engaged_(play)" title="wikilink">Engaged</a></em> (1877), which inspired <a href="Oscar_Wilde" title="wikilink">Oscar Wilde</a>'s <em><a href="The_Importance_of_Being_Earnest" title="wikilink">The Importance of Being Earnest</a></em>. <em>Engaged</em> is a parody of romantic drama written in the &quot;topsy-turvy&quot; satiric style of many of Gilbert's Bab Ballads and the <a href="Savoy_Operas" title="wikilink">Savoy Operas</a>, with one character pledging his love, in the most poetic and romantic language possible, to every single woman in the play; the &quot;innocent&quot; Scottish rustics being revealed to be making a living through throwing trains off the lines and then charging the passengers for services, and, in general, romance being gladly thrown over in favour of monetary gain. <em>Engaged</em> continues to be performed today by both professional and amateur companies.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a></p>

<p><img src="Sorc-Pin-Trial.jpg" title="fig:An early poster showing the first three Gilbert and Sullivan operas after Thespis." alt="An early poster showing the first three Gilbert and Sullivan operas after Thespis." width="300" />  Carte finally assembled a syndicate in 1877 and formed the Comedy Opera Company to launch a series of original English comic operas, beginning with a third collaboration between Gilbert and Sullivan, <em><a href="The_Sorcerer" title="wikilink">The Sorcerer</a></em> in November 1877. This work was a modest success,<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a> and <em><a href="H.M.S._Pinafore" title="wikilink">H.M.S. Pinafore</a></em> followed in May 1878. Despite a slow start, mainly due to a scorching summer, <em>Pinafore</em> became a red-hot favourite by autumn. After a dispute with Carte over the division of profits, the other Comedy Opera Company partners hired thugs to storm the theatre one night to steal the sets and costumes, intending to mount a rival production. The attempt was repelled by stagehands and others at the theatre loyal to Carte, and Carte continued as sole impresario of the newly renamed <a href="D&#39;Oyly_Carte_Opera_Company" title="wikilink">D'Oyly Carte Opera Company</a>.<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a></p>
<p>For the next decade, the <a href="Savoy_opera" title="wikilink">Savoy Operas</a> (as the series came to be known, after the <a href="Savoy_Theatre" title="wikilink">theatre</a> Carte later built to house them) were Gilbert's principal activity. The successful comic operas with Sullivan continued to appear every year or two, several of them being among the longest-running productions up to that point in the history of the musical stage.<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a> After <em>Pinafore</em> came <em><a href="The_Pirates_of_Penzance" title="wikilink">The Pirates of Penzance</a></em> (1879), <em><a href="Patience_(opera)" title="wikilink">Patience</a></em> (1881), <em><a href="Iolanthe" class="uri" title="wikilink">Iolanthe</a></em> (1882), <em><a href="Princess_Ida" title="wikilink">Princess Ida</a></em> (1884), <em><a href="The_Mikado" title="wikilink">The Mikado</a></em> (1885), <em><a href="Ruddigore" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ruddigore</a></em> (1887), <em><a href="The_Yeomen_of_the_Guard" title="wikilink">The Yeomen of the Guard</a></em> (1888), and <em><a href="The_Gondoliers" title="wikilink">The Gondoliers</a></em> (1889). Gilbert not only directed and oversaw all aspects of production for these works, but he actually <em>designed</em> the costumes himself for <em>Patience</em>, <em>Iolanthe</em>, <em>Princess Ida</em>, and <em>Ruddigore</em>.<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a></p>
<p>During this time, Gilbert and Sullivan also collaborated on one other major work, the oratorio <em><a href="The_Martyr_of_Antioch" title="wikilink">The Martyr of Antioch</a></em>, premiered at the Leeds music festival in October 1880. Gilbert arranged the original epic poem into a libretto suitable for the music, and it contains some original work. During this period, Gilbert occasionally wrote plays to be performed elsewhere – both serious dramas (for example <em>The Ne'er-Do-Weel</em>, 1878) and humorous works (for example <em><a href="Foggerty&#39;s_Fairy" title="wikilink">Foggerty's Fairy</a></em>, 1881). However, he no longer needed to turn out multiple plays each year, as he had done before. Indeed, during the more than nine years that separated <em>The Pirates of Penzance</em> and <em>The Gondoliers</em>, he wrote just three plays outside of the partnership with Sullivan.<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a> None of these works proved very successful.<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="the-carpet-quarrel-and-end-of-the-collaboration">The Carpet Quarrel and end of the collaboration</h3>
<p>Gilbert sometimes had a strained working relationship with Sullivan, partly caused by the fact that each man saw himself allowing his work to be subjugated to the other's, and partly caused by the opposing personalities of the two—Gilbert was often confrontational and notoriously thin-skinned (though prone to acts of extraordinary kindness), while Sullivan eschewed conflict. In addition, Gilbert imbued his libretti with &quot;topsy-turvy&quot; situations in which the social order was turned upside down. After a time, these subjects were often at odds with Sullivan's desire for realism and emotional content.<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a> In addition, Gilbert's political satire often poked fun at those in the circles of privilege, while Sullivan was eager to socialize among the wealthy and titled people who would become his friends and patrons.<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a></p>
<p>Throughout their collaboration, Gilbert and Sullivan quarreled several times over the choice of a subject. After both <em>Princess Ida</em> and <em>Ruddigore</em>, which were less successful than the seven other operas from <em>H.M.S. Pinafore</em> through <em>The Gondoliers</em>, Sullivan asked to leave the partnership, saying that he found Gilbert's plots repetitive and that the operas were not artistically satisfying to him. While the two artists worked out their differences, Carte kept the Savoy open with revivals of their earlier works. On each occasion, after a few months' pause, Gilbert responded with a libretto that met Sullivan's objections, and the partnership was able to continue successfully.<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a></p>
<p>During the run of <em>The Gondoliers</em>, however, Gilbert challenged Carte over the expenses of the production. Carte had charged the cost of a new carpet for the Savoy Theatre lobby to the partnership. Gilbert believed that this was a maintenance expense that should be charged to Carte alone. As scholar Andrew Crowther has explained:</p>
<dl>

<dd>After all, the carpet was only one of a number of disputed items, and the real issue lay not in the mere money value of these things, but in whether Carte could be trusted with the financial affairs of Gilbert and Sullivan. Gilbert contended that Carte had at best made a series of serious blunders in the accounts, and at worst deliberately attempted to swindle the others. It is not easy to settle the rights and wrongs of the issue at this distance, but it does seem fairly clear that there was something very wrong with the accounts at this time. Gilbert wrote to Sullivan on 28 May, 1891, a year after the end of the &quot;Quarrel&quot;, that Carte had admitted &quot;an unintentional overcharge of nearly &lt;U+00A3&gt;1,000 in the electric lighting accounts alone.&quot;<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a>
</dd>
</dl>
<p><img src="Utopia_Limited_Poster.jpg" title="fig:The Drawing Room Scene from Utopia, Limited." alt="The Drawing Room Scene from Utopia, Limited." width="400" /> Sullivan sided with Carte, who was building a theatre in London for the production of new English grand operas, with Sullivan's <em><a href="Ivanhoe_(opera)" title="wikilink">Ivanhoe</a></em> as the inaugural work. While the protracted quarrel worked itself out in the courts and in public, Gilbert wrote <em><a href="The_Mountebanks_(opera)" title="wikilink">The Mountebanks</a></em> with <a href="Alfred_Cellier" title="wikilink">Alfred Cellier</a> and the flop <em><a href="Haste_to_the_Wedding" title="wikilink">Haste to the Wedding</a></em> with <a href="George_Grossmith" title="wikilink">George Grossmith</a>.<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1891, after many failed attempts at reconciliation by the pair, <a href="William_Chappell" title="wikilink">Tom Chappell</a>, the music publisher responsible for printing the Gilbert and Sullivan operas, stepped in to mediate between two of his most profitable artists, and within two weeks had succeeded.<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a> Two more operas resulted: <em><a href="Utopia,_Limited" title="wikilink">Utopia, Limited</a></em> (1893) and <em><a href="The_Grand_Duke" title="wikilink">The Grand Duke</a></em> (1896). Gilbert also offered a third libretto to Sullivan (<em><a href="His_Excellency_(opera)" title="wikilink">His Excellency</a></em>, 1894), but Gilbert's insistance on casting <a href="Nancy_McIntosh" title="wikilink">Nancy McIntosh</a>, his proteg&lt;U+00E9&gt;e from <em>Utopia</em>, led to Sullivan's refusal.<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a> <em>Utopia</em> was a very modest success, and <em>The Grand Duke</em> was an outright failure, after which the partnership ended for good.<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a></p>

<h2 id="later-years">Later years</h2>
<p>Gilbert had moved to <a href="Grim&#39;s_Dyke" title="wikilink">Grim's Dyke</a> <a href="Harrow" class="uri" title="wikilink">Harrow</a> in 1890,<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a> and in 1891 was named a <a href="Justice_of_the_Peace" title="wikilink">Justice of the Peace</a> for <a href="Middlesex" class="uri" title="wikilink">Middlesex</a>.<a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a> Having met Nancy McIntosh and cast her in <em>Utopia, Limited</em> and <em>His Excellency</em>, Gilbert and Lady Gilbert both developed an affection for her, and she became their unofficially adopted daughter, eventually moving to Grim's Dyke to live with them. Even after Gilbert's death, McIntosh continued to live with Lady Gilbert for another 25 years until Lady Gilbert's death in 1936.<a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a></p>
<p>Although Gilbert announced a retirement from the theatre after the poor initial run of his last work with Sullivan, <em><a href="The_Grand_Duke" title="wikilink">The Grand Duke</a></em> (1896), he produced four more plays over the last 15 years of his life, including an unsuccessful opera, <em><a href="Fallen_Fairies" title="wikilink">Fallen Fairies</a></em> (1909), with <a href="Edward_German" title="wikilink">Edward German</a>.<a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a> Gilbert also continued to personally supervise the various revivals of his works by the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company.<a href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a> His last play, <em><a href="The_Hooligan" title="wikilink">The Hooligan</a></em>, produced just four months before his death, is a study of a young condemned thug in a prison cell. The piece was so grim and powerful that, according to Mrs. Alec Tweedie, &quot;women [in the audience] had gone out fainting&quot;. <em>The Hooligan</em> was one of Gilbert's most successful serious dramas, and experts conclude that, in those last months of Gilbert's life, he was developing a new style, a &quot;mixture of irony, of social theme, and of grubby realism,&quot;<a href="#fn67" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a> to replace the old &quot;Gilbertianism&quot; that he had grown weary of.<a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a> <img src="Memorial_To_WS_Gilbert.jpg" title="fig:Memorial to W. S. Gilbert on Victoria Embankment, London" alt="Memorial to W. S. Gilbert on Victoria Embankment, London" /></p>
<p>Gilbert has been accused of being prickly and hard to get along with, but he could be extraordinarily kind.<a href="#fn69" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref69"><sup>69</sup></a> During the final illness of the theatre critic <a href="Clement_Scott" title="wikilink">Clement Scott</a> in 1904, for instance, Gilbert visited nearly every day and assisted Scott's wife.<a href="#fn70" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a> Similarly, Gilbert had written some plays at the behest of comic actor Ned Sothern, including <em>Foggerty&lt;U+2019&gt;s Fairy</em>. However, Sothern died before he could perform the piece. Gilbert purchased the play back from the grateful legatee.<a href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a> In addition, as the writings about Gilbert by husband and wife <a href="Seymour_Hicks" title="wikilink">Seymour Hicks</a> and <a href="Ellaline_Terriss" title="wikilink">Ellaline Terriss</a> (frequent guests at his home), vividly illustrate, Gilbert's relationships with women were generally more successful than his relationships with men.<a href="#fn72" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref72"><sup>72</sup></a></p>
<p>Gilbert was knighted in 1907 in recognition of his contributions to drama. Sullivan had been knighted for his contributions to music almost a quarter of a century earlier, in 1883. Gilbert was, however, the first British writer ever to receive a <a href="knighthood" class="uri" title="wikilink">knighthood</a> for his plays alone—earlier dramatist knights, such as <a href="Sir_William_Davenant" title="wikilink">Sir William Davenant</a> and <a href="Sir_John_Vanbrugh" title="wikilink">Sir John Vanbrugh</a>, were knighted for political and other services.<a href="#fn73" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref73"><sup>73</sup></a></p>
<p>On <a href="29_May" title="wikilink">29 May</a> <a href="1911" class="uri" title="wikilink">1911</a>, Gilbert was giving swimming lessons to two young ladies in the lake of his home <a href="Grim&#39;s_Ditch_(Harrow)" title="wikilink">Grim's Dyke</a> when one of them lost her footing and called for help. Gilbert dived in to save her, but suffered a heart attack in the middle of the lake and drowned.<a href="#fn74" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref74"><sup>74</sup></a></p>
<p>He was buried in a cemetery in <a href="Stanmore" class="uri" title="wikilink">Stanmore</a>.</p>
