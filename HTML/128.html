<p><strong>Operation Storm</strong> (, ) was the last major battle of the <a href="Croatian_War_of_Independence" title="wikilink">Croatian War of Independence</a>. It was a <a href="decisive_victory" title="wikilink">decisive victory</a> for the <a href="Croatian_Army" title="wikilink">Croatian Army</a> (HV), which attacked across a  front against the <a href="Republic_of_Serbian_Krajina" title="wikilink">Republic of Serbian Krajina</a> (RSK). The HV was supported by the <a href="Croatian_special_police_order_of_battle_in_1991&lt;U+2013&gt;95" title="wikilink">Croatian special police</a> advancing from the <a href="Velebit" class="uri" title="wikilink">Velebit</a> Mountain, and the <a href="Army_of_the_Republic_of_Bosnia_and_Herzegovina" title="wikilink">Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina</a> (ARBiH) located in the <a href="Biha&lt;U+0107&gt;_pocket" title="wikilink">Biha&lt;U+0107&gt; pocket</a>, in the <a href="Army_of_the_Republic_of_Serb_Krajina" title="wikilink">Army of the Republic of Serb Krajina</a> (ARSK) rear. The battle, launched to restore <a href="Croatia" title="wikilink">Croatian</a> control of  of territory, representing 18.4% of the country, was the largest European land battle since the <a href="World_War_II" title="wikilink">Second World War</a>. Operation Storm commenced at dawn on 4 August 1995 and was declared complete on the evening of 7 August, despite significant mopping-up operations against pockets of resistance lasting until 14 August.</p>
<p>Operation Storm was also a <a href="strategic_victory" title="wikilink">strategic victory</a> in the <a href="Bosnian_War" title="wikilink">Bosnian War</a> as the <a href="siege_of_Biha&lt;U+0107&gt;" title="wikilink">siege of Biha&lt;U+0107&gt;</a> was lifted and the HV, <a href="Croatian_Defence_Council" title="wikilink">Croatian Defence Council</a> (HVO) and the ARBiH were placed in a position to change the military balance of power in <a href="Bosnia_and_Herzegovina" title="wikilink">Bosnia and Herzegovina</a> through the subsequent <a href="Operation_Mistral_2" title="wikilink">Operation Mistral 2</a>. The operation built on HV and HVO advances gained during <a href="Operation_Summer_&#39;95" title="wikilink">Operation Summer '95</a> when strategic positions allowing the rapid capture of the RSK capital <a href="Knin" class="uri" title="wikilink">Knin</a> were gained, and on the continued arming and training of the HV since the beginning of the Croatian War of Independence, when the RSK was created during the Serb <a href="Log_revolution" title="wikilink">rebellion</a> and <a href="Yugoslav_People&#39;s_Army" title="wikilink">Yugoslav People's Army</a> (JNA) intervention. The operation itself followed an unsuccessful <a href="United_Nations" title="wikilink">United Nations</a> (UN) peacekeeping mission and diplomatic efforts to settle the conflict.</p>
<p>The HV's success was a result of a series of improvements to the HV itself, and crucial breakthroughs made in the ARSK positions that were subsequently exploited by the HV and the ARBiH. The attack was not immediately successful at all points, but seizing key positions led to the collapse of the ARSK command structure and overall defensive capability. The HV capture of <a href="Bosansko_Grahovo" title="wikilink">Bosansko Grahovo</a>, just before Operation Storm and the special police's advance to <a href="Gra&lt;U+010D&gt;ac" class="uri" title="wikilink">Gra&lt;U+010D&gt;ac</a>, made it nearly impossible to defend Knin. In <a href="Lika" class="uri" title="wikilink">Lika</a>, two guard brigades quickly cut the ARSK-held area lacking tactical depth and mobile reserve forces, isolating pockets of resistance and positioning a mobile force for a decisive northward thrust into the <a href="Karlovac" class="uri" title="wikilink">Karlovac</a> Corps <a href="area_of_responsibility" title="wikilink">area of responsibility</a> (AOR) and pushing ARSK towards <a href="Banovina_(region)" title="wikilink">Banovina</a>. The defeat of the ARSK at <a href="Glina,_Croatia" title="wikilink">Glina</a> and <a href="Petrinja" class="uri" title="wikilink">Petrinja</a>, after a tough defence, defeated the ARSK Banija Corps as well, as its reserve was pinned down by the ARBiH. The RSK relied on the <a href="Republika_Srpska" title="wikilink">Republika Srpska</a> and the <a href="Serbia_and_Montenegro" title="wikilink">Yugoslav</a> militaries as its strategic reserve, but they did not intervene in the battle.</p>
<p>The HV and the special police suffered 174–211 killed or missing, while the ARSK had 560 soldiers killed. Four UN peacekeepers were also killed. The HV captured 4,000 <a href="Prisoner_of_war" title="wikilink">prisoners of war</a>. The number of Serb civilian deaths is disputed—Croatia claims that 214 were killed, while Serbian sources cite 1,192 civilians killed or missing. During and after the offensive, 150,000&lt;U+2013&gt;200,000 Serbs&lt;U+2014&gt;or nearly the entire <a href="Serbs_of_Croatia" title="wikilink">Serb population</a> of the area formerly held by the ARSK&lt;U+2014&gt;fled and a variety of crimes were committed against the remaining civilians there. The <a href="International_Criminal_Tribunal_for_the_Former_Yugoslavia" title="wikilink">International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia</a> (ICTY) later <a href="Trial_of_Gotovina_et_al" title="wikilink">tried three Croatian generals</a> charged with <a href="war_crime" title="wikilink">war crimes</a> and partaking in a <a href="joint_criminal_enterprise" title="wikilink">joint criminal enterprise</a> designed to force the Serb population out of Croatia; they were all ultimately acquitted and the tribunal ruling refuted the charges that Operation Storm was planned as a criminal enterprise. , the Croatian judiciary has convicted 2,380 persons for various crimes committed during Operation Storm.</p>

<p>In 1990, following the <a href="Croatian_parliamentary_election,_1990" title="wikilink">electoral defeat</a> of the government of the <a href="Socialist_Republic_of_Croatia" title="wikilink">Socialist Republic of Croatia</a>, ethnic tensions between <a href="Croats" class="uri" title="wikilink">Croats</a> and <a href="Serbs" class="uri" title="wikilink">Serbs</a> worsened.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> Serbian <a href="President_of_Serbia" title="wikilink">President</a> <a href="Slobodan_Milo&lt;U+0161&gt;evi&lt;U+0107&gt;" title="wikilink">Slobodan Milo&lt;U+0161&gt;evi&lt;U+0107&gt;</a> used <a href="Franjo_Tu&lt;U+0111&gt;man" title="wikilink">Franjo Tu&lt;U+0111&gt;man</a>'s actions to his advantage, portraying the Croatian leader and his <a href="Croatian_Democratic_Union" title="wikilink">Croatian Democratic Union</a> (HDZ) as a reincarnation of the <a href="Usta&lt;U+0161&gt;e" class="uri" title="wikilink">Usta&lt;U+0161&gt;e</a>.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>

<p>As the <a href="Yugoslav_People&#39;s_Army" title="wikilink">Yugoslav People's Army</a> (JNA) increasingly supported the RSK and the <a href="Croatian_Police" title="wikilink">Croatian Police</a> was unable to cope with the situation, the <a href="Croatian_National_Guard" title="wikilink">Croatian National Guard</a> (ZNG) was formed in May 1991. The ZNG was renamed the <a href="Croatian_Army" title="wikilink">Croatian Army</a> (HV) in November.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> The establishment of the <a href="military_of_Croatia" title="wikilink">military of Croatia</a> was hampered by a UN <a href="arms_embargo" title="wikilink">arms embargo</a> introduced in September.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> The final months of 1991 saw the fiercest fighting of the war, culminating in the <a href="Battle_of_the_Barracks" title="wikilink">Battle of the Barracks</a>,<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> the <a href="Siege_of_Dubrovnik" title="wikilink">Siege of Dubrovnik</a>,<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> and the <a href="Battle_of_Vukovar" title="wikilink">Battle of Vukovar</a>.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>

<p>As the JNA disengaged in Croatia, its personnel prepared to set up a new <a href="Bosnian_Serb" title="wikilink">Bosnian Serb</a> army, as Bosnian Serbs declared the Serbian Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina on 9 January 1992, ahead of a 29 February – 1 March 1992 referendum on the independence of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The referendum was later cited as a pretext for the <a href="Bosnian_War" title="wikilink">Bosnian War</a>.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> Bosnian Serbs set up barricades in the capital, <a href="Sarajevo" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sarajevo</a>, and elsewhere on 1 March, and the next day the first fatalities of the war were recorded in Sarajevo and <a href="Doboj" class="uri" title="wikilink">Doboj</a>.

<p>In November 1994, the <a href="Siege_of_Biha&lt;U+0107&gt;" title="wikilink">Siege of Biha&lt;U+0107&gt;</a>, a battle of the Bosnian War, entered a critical stage as the VRS and the ARSK came close to capturing the town of Biha&lt;U+0107&gt; from the <a href="Army_of_the_Republic_of_Bosnia_and_Herzegovina" title="wikilink">Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina</a> (ARBiH). It was a strategic area and,<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> since June 1993, <a href="Biha&lt;U+0107&gt;" class="uri" title="wikilink">Biha&lt;U+0107&gt;</a> had been one of six <a href="United_Nations_Safe_Areas" title="wikilink">United Nations Safe Areas</a> established in Bosnia and Herzegovina.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> The <a href="US_administration" title="wikilink">US administration</a> felt that its capture by Serb forces would intensify the war and lead to a humanitarian disaster greater than any other in the conflict to that point. Amongst the <a href="United_States" title="wikilink">United States</a>, <a href="France" class="uri" title="wikilink">France</a> and the <a href="United_Kingdom" title="wikilink">United Kingdom</a>, division existed regarding how to protect the area.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a><a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> The US called for <a href="airstrikes" class="uri" title="wikilink">airstrikes</a> against the VRS, but the French and the British opposed them citing safety concerns and a desire to maintain the neutrality of French and British troops deployed as a part of the UNPROFOR in Bosnia and Herzegovina. In turn, the US was unwilling to commit ground troops.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> On the other hand, the Europeans recognized that the US was free to propose military confrontation with the Serbs while relying on the European powers to block any such move,<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> since <a href="French_President" title="wikilink">French President</a> <a href="Fran&lt;U+00E7&gt;ois_Mitterrand" title="wikilink">Fran&lt;U+00E7&gt;ois Mitterrand</a> discouraged any military intervention, greatly aiding the Serb war effort.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> The French stance reversed after <a href="Jacques_Chirac" title="wikilink">Jacques Chirac</a> was elected president of France in May 1995,<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> pressuring the British to adopt a more aggressive approach as well.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> Denying Biha&lt;U+0107&gt; to the Serbs was also strategically important to Croatia,<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> and <a href="General" class="uri" title="wikilink">General</a> <a href="Janko_Bobetko" title="wikilink">Janko Bobetko</a>, the <a href="General_Staff_of_the_Armed_Forces_of_the_Republic_of_Croatia" title="wikilink">Chief of the Croatian General Staff</a>, considered the potential fall of Biha&lt;U+0107&gt; to represent an end to Croatia's war effort.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a></p>
<p>In March 1994, the <a href="Washington_Agreement" title="wikilink">Washington Agreement</a> was signed,<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a> ending the Croat&lt;U+2013&gt;Bosniak War, and providing Croatia with US military advisors from <a href="Military_Professional_Resources_Inc." title="wikilink">Military Professional Resources Incorporated</a> (MPRI).<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> The US involvement reflected a new military strategy endorsed by <a href="Bill_Clinton" title="wikilink">Bill Clinton</a> in February 1993.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a> Because the UN arms embargo was still in place, MPRI was hired ostensibly to prepare the HV for participation in the <a href="NATO" class="uri" title="wikilink">NATO</a> <a href="Partnership_for_Peace" title="wikilink">Partnership for Peace</a> programme.

As the US officials gave no response to the proposal, the Croatian General Staff ordered <a href="Operation_Winter_&#39;94" title="wikilink">Operation Winter '94</a> the same day, to be carried out by the HV and the <a href="Croatian_Defence_Council" title="wikilink">Croatian Defence Council</a> (HVO)—the main military force of the <a href="Croats_of_Bosnia_and_Herzegovina" title="wikilink">Bosnian Croats</a>.

<p>In 1994, the United States, <a href="Russia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Russia</a>, the <a href="European_Union" title="wikilink">European Union</a> (EU) and the UN sought to replace the Vance plan, which brought in the UNPROFOR.

Neither Croatia nor the RSK liked the plan. Croatia was concerned that the RSK might accept it, but Tu&lt;U+0111&gt;man realised that Milo&lt;U+0161&gt;evi&lt;U+0107&gt;, who would ultimately make the decision for the RSK,<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a> would not accept the plan for fear that it would set a precedent for a political settlement in <a href="Kosovo" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kosovo</a>—allowing Croatia to accept the plan with little possibility for it to be implemented.<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a> The RSK refused to receive, let alone accept, the plan.<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a></p>
<p>In December 1994, Croatia and the RSK made an economic agreement to restore road and rail links, water and gas supplies, and use of a part of the <a href="Adria_oil_pipeline" title="wikilink">Adria oil pipeline</a>.

<p>On 17 July, the ARSK and the VRS started a fresh effort to capture Biha&lt;U+0107&gt; by expanding on gains made during <a href="Operation_Spider" title="wikilink">Operation Spider</a>. The move provided the HV with a chance to extend their territorial gains from Operation Winter '94 by advancing from the Livno valley. On 22 July, Tu&lt;U+0111&gt;man and Bosnian President <a href="Alija_Izetbegovi&lt;U+0107&gt;" title="wikilink">Alija Izetbegovi&lt;U+0107&gt;</a> signed the <a href="Split_Agreement" title="wikilink">Split Agreement</a> for <a href="Mutual_Defense_Treaty" title="wikilink">mutual defence</a>, permitting the large-scale deployment of the HV in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The HV and HVO responded quickly through <a href="Operation_Summer_&#39;95" title="wikilink">Operation Summer '95</a> (), capturing <a href="Bosansko_Grahovo" title="wikilink">Bosansko Grahovo</a> and <a href="Glamo&lt;U+010D&gt;" class="uri" title="wikilink">Glamo&lt;U+010D&gt;</a> on 28–29 July.<a href="#fn67" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a> The attack drew some ARSK units away from Biha&lt;U+0107&gt;,<a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a><a href="#fn69" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref69"><sup>69</sup></a> but not as many as expected. However, it put the HV in an excellent position,<a href="#fn70" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a> as it isolated Knin from the Republika Srpska, as well as <a href="FR_Yugoslavia" title="wikilink">Yugoslavia</a>.<a href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a></p>
<p>In late July and early August, there were two more attempts at resurrecting the Z-4 Plan and the 1994 economic agreement. Talks proposed on 28 July were ignored by the RSK, and last-ditch talks were held in <a href="Geneva" class="uri" title="wikilink">Geneva</a> on 3 August. These quickly broke down as Croatia and the RSK rejected a compromise proposed by <a href="Thorvald_Stoltenberg" title="wikilink">Thorvald Stoltenberg</a>, a Special Representative of the <a href="Secretary-General_of_the_United_Nations" title="wikilink">UN Secretary-General</a>, essentially calling for further negotiations at a later date. In addition, the RSK dismissed a set of Croatian demands, including to disarm, and failed to endorse the Z-4 Plan once again. The talks were used by Croatia to prepare diplomatic ground for the imminent Operation Storm,<a href="#fn72" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref72"><sup>72</sup></a> whose planning was completed during the <a href="Brijuni" class="uri" title="wikilink">Brijuni</a> Islands meeting between Tu&lt;U+0111&gt;man and military commanders on 31 July.<a href="#fn73" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref73"><sup>73</sup></a> The HV started large-scale <a href="mobilization" class="uri" title="wikilink">mobilization</a> in late July, soon after General <a href="Zvonimir_&lt;U+010C&gt;ervenko" title="wikilink">Zvonimir &lt;U+010C&gt;ervenko</a> became its new Chief of General Staff on 15 July.<a href="#fn74" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref74"><sup>74</sup></a></p>

The Gospi&lt;U+0107&gt; Corps, assigned a  section of the front, was tasked with cutting the RSK in half and linking up with the ARBiH, while the ARBiH was tasked with pinning down ARSK forces that were in contact with the Biha&lt;U+0107&gt; pocket.<a href="#fn86" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref86"><sup>86</sup></a></p>
<p>The HV Karlovac Corps, commanded by Major General <a href="Miljenko_Crnjac" title="wikilink">Miljenko Crnjac</a>, on the left flank of the Gospi&lt;U+0107&gt; Corps, covered the area extending from <a href="Ogulin" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ogulin</a> to Karlovac, including Kordun,<a href="#fn87" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref87"><sup>87</sup></a> and executed the Storm-2 plan.

<p>The HV Zagreb Corps, assigned the Storm-1 plan, initially commanded by Major General <a href="Ivan_Basarac" title="wikilink">Ivan Basarac</a>, on the left flank of the Karlovac Corps, was deployed on three main axes of attack—towards <a href="Glina,_Croatia" title="wikilink">Glina</a>, <a href="Petrinja" class="uri" title="wikilink">Petrinja</a> and <a href="Hrvatska_Kostajnica" title="wikilink">Hrvatska Kostajnica</a>.

Their secondary mission was compromised when a battalion of the special police and the 81st Guards Battalion planned to spearhead the advance were deployed elsewhere forcing modifications to the plan. The Zagreb Corps was composed of 30,000 troops, while the ARSK had 9,000 facing them and about 1,000 ARBiH troops in the Biha&lt;U+0107&gt; pocket to their rear. At the start of Operation Storm, about 3,500 ARSK troops were in contact with the ARBiH.<a href="#fn94" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref94"><sup>94</sup></a> HV Bjelovar Corps, on the left flank of the Zagreb Corps, covering the area along the <a href="Una_(Sava)" title="wikilink">Una River</a>, had a forward command post in <a href="Novska" class="uri" title="wikilink">Novska</a>.

<p>The ARSK divided its forces in the area in two, subordinating the North Dalmatia and Lika Corps to the ARSK General Staff, and grouping the rest into the Kordun Operational Group commanded by <a href="Lieutenant_Colonel_General" title="wikilink">Lieutenant Colonel General</a> <a href="Mile_Novakovi&lt;U+0107&gt;" title="wikilink">Mile Novakovi&lt;U+0107&gt;</a>.

<p>Operation Storm started at 5 a.m. on 4 August 1995 when coordinated attacks were executed by reconnaissance and sabotage detachments in concert with <a href="Croatian_Air_Force_and_Air_Defence" title="wikilink">Croatian Air Force</a> (CAF) air strikes aimed at disrupting ARSK <a href="command,_control,_and_communications" title="wikilink">command, control, and communications</a>.<a href="#fn110" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref110"><sup>110</sup></a> UN peacekeepers, known as <a href="United_Nations_Confidence_Restoration_Operation" title="wikilink">United Nations Confidence Restoration Operation</a> (UNCRO),<a href="#fn111" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref111"><sup>111</sup></a> were notified three hours in advance of the attack when Tu&lt;U+0111&gt;man's chief of staff, <a href="Hrvoje_&lt;U+0160&gt;arini&lt;U+0107&gt;" title="wikilink">Hrvoje &lt;U+0160&gt;arini&lt;U+0107&gt;</a>, telephoned UNCRO commander, <a href="French_Army" title="wikilink">French Army</a> General Bernard Janvier. In addition, each HV corps notified the UNCRO sector in its path of the attack, requesting written confirmations of receipt of the information. The UNCRO relayed the information to the RSK,<a href="#fn112" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref112"><sup>112</sup></a> confirming the warnings RSK received from the Yugoslav Army General Staff the previous day.<a href="#fn113" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref113"><sup>113</sup></a></p>

Moving against the ARSK 3rd <a href="Battlegroup_(army)" title="wikilink">Battlegroup</a>, consisting of elements of the North Dalmatian Corps and RSK police, the 7th Guards achieved its objectives for the day and allowed the 4th Guards Brigade to attack. The HV <a href="Sinj" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sinj</a> Operational Group (OG), on the left flank of the two brigades, joined the attack and the 126th Home Guard Regiment captured <a href="Uni&lt;U+0161&gt;ta_(Bosansko_Grahovo)" title="wikilink">Uni&lt;U+0161&gt;ta</a>, gaining control of the area overlooking the Sinj–Knin road. The 144th Brigade and the 6th Home Guard Regiment also pushed ARSK forces back. The <a href="&lt;U+0160&gt;ibenik" class="uri" title="wikilink">&lt;U+0160&gt;ibenik</a> OG units faced the ARSK 75th Motorized Brigade and a part of the 2nd Infantry Brigade of the ARSK North Dalmatian Corps. There, the 142nd and the 15th Home Guard Regiments made minor progress in the area between <a href="Krka_(Croatia)" title="wikilink">Krka</a> and <a href="Drni&lt;U+0161&gt;" class="uri" title="wikilink">Drni&lt;U+0161&gt;</a>, while the 113th Infantry Brigade made a slightly greater advance on their left flank, to <a href="&lt;U+010C&gt;ista_Velika" title="wikilink">&lt;U+010C&gt;ista Velika</a>. In the <a href="Zadar" class="uri" title="wikilink">Zadar</a> OG area, the 134th Home Guard Regiment (without its 2nd Battalion) failed to advance, while the 7th Home Guard Regiment and the 112th HV Brigade gained little ground against the ARSK 92nd Motorized and 3rd Infantry Brigades at <a href="Benkovac" class="uri" title="wikilink">Benkovac</a>. On the Velebit, the 2nd Battalion of the 9th Guards Brigade, reinforced with a company from the 7th Home Guard Regiment, and the 2nd Battalion of the 134th Home Guard Regiment met stiff resistance but advanced sufficiently to secure use of the <a href="Obrovac,_Croatia" title="wikilink">Obrovac</a>–<a href="Sveti_Rok" title="wikilink">Sveti Rok</a> road. At 4:45 p.m., a decision to evacuate the population in the Northern Dalmatia and Lika areas was made by RSK President <a href="Milan_Marti&lt;U+0107&gt;" title="wikilink">Milan Marti&lt;U+0107&gt;</a>.<a href="#fn114" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref114"><sup>114</sup></a><a href="#fn115" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref115"><sup>115</sup></a> According to RSK Major General <a href="Milisav_Sekuli&lt;U+0107&gt;" title="wikilink">Milisav Sekuli&lt;U+0107&gt;</a>, Marti&lt;U+0107&gt; ordered the evacuation hoping to coax Milo&lt;U+0161&gt;evi&lt;U+0107&gt; and the international community to help the RSK.<a href="#fn116" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref116"><sup>116</sup></a> Nonetheless, the evacuation was extended the whole sectors North and South, except Kordun region.<a href="#fn117" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref117"><sup>117</sup></a> In the evening the ARSK General Staff moved from Knin to <a href="Srb" class="uri" title="wikilink">Srb</a>,<a href="#fn118" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref118"><sup>118</sup></a> about  to the northwest.<a href="#fn119" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref119"><sup>119</sup></a></p>
<p>At 5 a.m., Croatian special police advanced to the Mali Alan pass on the Velebit, encountering strong resistance from the ARSK Lika Corps' 4th Light Brigade and elements of the 9th Motorized Brigade. The pass was captured at 1 p.m., and Sveti Rok village was captured at about 5 p.m. The special police advanced further beyond Mali Alan, meeting more resistance at 9 p.m. and then <a href="Bivouac_shelter" title="wikilink">bivouacking</a> until 5 a.m. The ARSK 9th Motorized Brigade withdrew to <a href="Udbina" class="uri" title="wikilink">Udbina</a> after being forced out of its positions on the Velebit. In the morning, the special police captured <a href="Lovinac" class="uri" title="wikilink">Lovinac</a>, <a href="Gra&lt;U+010D&gt;ac" class="uri" title="wikilink">Gra&lt;U+010D&gt;ac</a> and <a href="Medak,_Croatia" title="wikilink">Medak</a>.<a href="#fn120" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref120"><sup>120</sup></a></p>
<p>In the Gospi&lt;U+0107&gt; Corps AOR, the 138th Home Guard Regiment and the 1st Battalion of the 1st Guards Brigade began an eastward attack in the <a href="Mala_Kapela" title="wikilink">Mala Kapela</a> area in the morning, meeting heavy resistance from the ARSK 70th Infantry Brigade. The rest of the 1st Guards joined in around midnight. The 133rd Home Guard Regiment attacked east of <a href="Oto&lt;U+010D&gt;ac" class="uri" title="wikilink">Oto&lt;U+010D&gt;ac</a>, towards <a href="Vrhovine" class="uri" title="wikilink">Vrhovine</a>, attempting to encircle the ARSK 50th Infantry Brigade and elements of the ARSK 103rd Infantry Brigade in a <a href="pincer_movement" title="wikilink">pincer movement</a>. Even though the regiment advanced, it failed to achieve its objective for the day. On the regiment's right flank, the HV 128th Brigade advanced together with the 3rd Battalion of the 8th Home Guard Regiment and cut through the Vrhovine–Korenica road. The rest of the 9th Guards Brigade, the bulk of the HV 118th Home Guard Regiment and the 111th Infantry Brigade advanced east from Gospi&lt;U+0107&gt; and Li&lt;U+010D&gt;ki Osik, coming up against very strong resistance from the ARSK 18th Infantry Brigade. As a result of these setbacks, the Gospi&lt;U+0107&gt; Corps ended the day short of the objectives it had been given.<a href="#fn121" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref121"><sup>121</sup></a></p>
<h4 id="sector-north">Sector North</h4>
<p>In the Ogulin area of the HV Karlovac Corps AOR, the 99th Brigade, reinforced by the 143rd Home Guard Regiment's <a href="Saborsko" class="uri" title="wikilink">Saborsko</a> Company, moved towards <a href="Pla&lt;U+0161&gt;ki" class="uri" title="wikilink">Pla&lt;U+0161&gt;ki</a> at 5 a.m., but the force was stopped and turned back in disarray by 6 p.m. The 143rd Home Guard Regiment advanced from <a href="Josipdol" class="uri" title="wikilink">Josipdol</a> towards Pla&lt;U+0161&gt;ki, encountering minefields and strong ARSK resistance. Its elements connected with the 14th Home Guard Regiment, advancing through <a href="Barilovi&lt;U+0107&gt;" class="uri" title="wikilink">Barilovi&lt;U+0107&gt;</a> towards <a href="Slunj" class="uri" title="wikilink">Slunj</a>. Near the city of Karlovac, the 137th Home Guard Regiment deployed four <a href="Reconnaissance" title="wikilink">reconnaissance groups</a> around midnight of 3–4 August, followed by artillery preparation and crossing of the <a href="Korana" class="uri" title="wikilink">Korana</a> River at 5 a.m. The advance was fiercely resisted by the ARSK 13th Infantry Brigade, but the <a href="bridgehead" class="uri" title="wikilink">bridgehead</a> was stable by the end of the day. The 110th Home Guard Regiment, reinforced by a company of the 137th Home Guard Regiment, advanced east to the road leading south from Karlovac to <a href="Vojni&lt;U+0107&gt;" class="uri" title="wikilink">Vojni&lt;U+0107&gt;</a> and Slunj, where it met heavy resistance and suffered more casualties to landmines, demoralizing the unit and preventing its further advance. In addition, the attached company of the 137th Home Guard Regiment and the 104th Brigade failed to secure the regiment's flanks. The 104th Brigade tried to cross the <a href="Kupa" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kupa</a> River at 5 a.m., but failed and fell back to its starting position by 8 a.m., at which time it was shifted to the bridgehead established by the 110th Home Guard Regiment. A company of the 99th Brigade was attached to the 143rd Home Guard Regiment for operations the next day, and a 250-strong battlegroup was removed from the brigade and subordinated to the Karlovac Corps directly.<a href="#fn122" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref122"><sup>122</sup></a></p>
<p>In the Zagreb Corps area, the HV moved across the Kupa River at two points towards Glina—in and near <a href="Pokupsko" class="uri" title="wikilink">Pokupsko</a>, using the 20th Home Guard Regiment and the 153rd Brigade. Both crossings established bridgeheads, although the bulk of the units were forced to retreat as the ARSK counter-attacked—only a battalion of the 153rd Brigade and elements of the 20th Home Guard Regiment held their ground. The crossings prompted the ARSK General Staff to order the 2nd Armoured Brigade of the Special Units Corps to move from Slunj to the bridgeheads,<a href="#fn123" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref123"><sup>123</sup></a> as the HV advance threatened a vital road in Glina.<a href="#fn124" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref124"><sup>124</sup></a> The HV 2nd Guards Brigade and the 12th Home Guard Regiment were tasked with the quick capture of Petrinja from the ARSK 31st Motorized Brigade in a pincer movement.<a href="#fn125" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref125"><sup>125</sup></a> The original plan, involving thrusts  south of Petrinja, was amended by Basarac to a direct assault on the city.<a href="#fn126" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref126"><sup>126</sup></a> On the right flank, the regiment was soon stopped by minefields and forced to retreat, while the bulk of the 2nd Guards Brigade advanced until it wavered following the loss of a company commander and five soldiers. The rest of the 2nd Guards Brigade—reinforced by the 2nd Battalion, elements of the 12th Home Guard Regiment, the 5th Antitank Artillery Battalion and the 31st Engineers Battalion—formed Tactical Group 2 (TG2) operating on the left flank of the attack. TG2 advanced from <a href="Mo&lt;U+0161&gt;&lt;U+0107&gt;enica" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mo&lt;U+0161&gt;&lt;U+0107&gt;enica</a>, a short distance from Petrinja, but was stopped after the 2nd Battalion's commander and six soldiers were killed. The ARSK 31st Motorized Brigade also panicked but managed to stabilize its defences as it received reinforcements. The HV 57th Brigade advanced south of Petrinja, intent on reaching the Petrinja–Hrvatska Kostajnica road, but ran into a minefield where the brigade commander was killed, while the 101st Brigade to its rear suffered heavy artillery fire and casualties. In the Sunja area, the 17th Home Guard Regiment and a company of the 151st Brigade unsuccessfully attacked the ARSK 26th Infantry Brigade. Later that day, a separate attack by the rest of the 151st Brigade also failed. The HV 103rd Brigade advanced to the Sunja–<a href="Sisak" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sisak</a> railroad, but had to retreat under heavy fire. The Zagreb Corps failed to meet any objective of the first day. This was attributed to inadequate manpower and as a result the corps requested the mobilization of the 102nd Brigade and the 1st and 21st Home Guard Regiments. The 2nd Guards Brigade was reinforced by the 1st Battalion of the 149th Brigade previously held in reserve in <a href="Ivani&lt;U+0107&gt;_Grad" title="wikilink">Ivani&lt;U+0107&gt; Grad</a>.<a href="#fn127" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref127"><sup>127</sup></a></p>
<p>In the Bjelovar Corps AOR, two battalions of the 125th Home Guard Regiment crossed the <a href="Sava" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sava</a> River near <a href="Jasenovac,_Sisak-Moslavina_County" title="wikilink">Jasenovac</a>, secured a bridgehead for trailing HV units and advanced towards <a href="Hrvatska_Dubica" title="wikilink">Hrvatska Dubica</a>. The two battalions were followed by an additional company of the same regiment, a battalion of the 52nd Home Guard Regiment, the 265th Reconnaissance Company and finally the 24th Home Guard Regiment battlegroup. A reconnaissance platoon of the 52nd Home Guard Regiment crossed the Sava River into the Republika Srpska, established a bridgehead for two infantry companies and subsequently demolished the <a href="Dubica,_Bosnia_and_Herzegovina" title="wikilink">Bosanska Dubica</a>–<a href="Gradi&lt;U+0161&gt;ka,_Bosnia_and_Herzegovina" title="wikilink">Gradi&lt;U+0161&gt;ka</a> road before returning to Croatian soil. The Bjelovar Corps units reached the outskirts of Hrvatska Dubica before nightfall. That night, the town of Hrvatska Dubica was abandoned by the ARSK troops and the civilian population. They fled south across the Sava River into Bosnia and Herzegovina.<a href="#fn128" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref128"><sup>128</sup></a></p>

The ARSK North Dalmatian Corps became increasingly uncoordinated as the HV 4th Guards Brigade advanced south towards Knin, protecting the right flank of the 7th Guards Brigade. The latter met little resistance and entered the town at about 11 a.m. Lieutenant General <a href="Ivan_&lt;U+010C&gt;ermak" title="wikilink">Ivan &lt;U+010C&gt;ermak</a> was appointed commander of the newly established HV Knin Corps. Sinj OG completed its objectives, capturing <a href="Veliki_Kozjak" title="wikilink">Kozjak</a> and <a href="Vrlika" class="uri" title="wikilink">Vrlika</a>, and meeting little resistance as the ARSK 1st Light Brigade disintegrated, retreating to Knin and later to Lika.

<p>The 138th Home Guard Regiment and the 1st Guards Brigade advanced to Li&lt;U+010D&gt;ka Jasenica, the latter pressing their attack further towards Saborsko, with the 2nd Battalion of the HV 119th Brigade reaching the area in the evening. The HV reinforced the 133rd Home Guard Regiment with a battalion of the 150th Brigade enabling the regiment to achieve its objectives of the previous day, partially encircling the ARSK force in Vrhovine. The 154th Home Guard Regiment was mobilized and deployed to the <a href="Li&lt;U+010D&gt;ko_Le&lt;U+0161&gt;&lt;U+0107&gt;e" title="wikilink">Li&lt;U+010D&gt;ko Le&lt;U+0161&gt;&lt;U+0107&gt;e</a> area.

<p>The 143rd Home Guard Regiment advanced towards Pla&lt;U+0161&gt;ki, capturing it that evening, while the 14th Home Guard Regiment captured Primi&lt;U+0161&gt;lje,  northwest of Slunj. At 0:30 a.m., the ARSK 13th Infantry Brigade and a company of the 19th Infantry Brigade counter-attacked at the Korana bridgehead, causing the bulk of the 137th Home Guard Regiment to panic and flee across the river. A single platoon of the regiment remained but the ARSK troops did not exploit the opportunity to destroy the bridgehead. In the morning, the regiment reoccupied the bridgehead, reinforced by a 350-strong battlegroup drawn from the 104th Brigade (including a tank platoon and <a href="multiple_rocket_launcher" title="wikilink">multiple rocket launchers</a>), and a company of the 148th Brigade from the Karlovac Corps operational reserve. The regiment and the battlegroup managed to extend the bridgehead towards the Karlovac–Slunj road. The 110th Home Guard Regiment attacked again south of Karlovac, but was repelled by prepared ARSK defences. That night, the Karlovac Corps decided to move elements of the 110th Home Guard Regiment and the 104th Brigade to the Korana bridgehead, while the ARSK 13th Infantry Brigade retreated to the right bank of Korana in an area extending about  north from Slunj.<a href="#fn131" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref131"><sup>131</sup></a></p>
<p>The Zagreb Corps made little or no progress on day two of the battle. Part of the 2nd Guards Brigade was ordered to drive towards Glina with the 20th Home Guards Regiment making a modest advance, while the 153rd Brigade abandoned its bridgehead. In the area of Petrinja, the HV advanced gradually only to be pushed back in some areas by an ARSK counter-attack. The results were reversed at significant cost by a renewed push by the 2nd Guards Brigade. The Zagreb Corps commander was replaced by Lieutenant General <a href="Petar_Stipeti&lt;U+0107&gt;" title="wikilink">Petar Stipeti&lt;U+0107&gt;</a> on orders from President Tu&lt;U+0111&gt;man. The HV reassigned the 102nd Brigade to drive to Glina, and the 57th Brigade was reinforced with the 2nd Battalion of the 149th Brigade. The 145th Brigade was moved from <a href="Popova&lt;U+010D&gt;a" class="uri" title="wikilink">Popova&lt;U+010D&gt;a</a> to the Sunja area, where the 17th Home Guard Regiment and the 151st Brigade made minor advances into the ARSK-held area.<a href="#fn132" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref132"><sup>132</sup></a></p>
<p>In the Bjelovar Corps AOR, Hrvatska Dubica was captured by the 52nd and the 24th Home Guard Regiments advancing from the east and the 125th Home Guard Regiment approaching from the north. The 125th Home Guard Regiment garrisoned the town, while the 52nd Home Guard Regiment moved northwest towards expected Zagreb Corps positions, but the Zagreb Corps' delays prevented any link-up. The 24th Home Guard Regiment advanced about  towards Hrvatska Kostajnica when it was stopped by ARSK troops. In response, the Corps called in a battalion and a reconnaissance platoon of the 121st Home Guard Regiment from <a href="Nova_Gradi&lt;U+0161&gt;ka" title="wikilink">Nova Gradi&lt;U+0161&gt;ka</a> to aid the push to the town.<a href="#fn133" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref133"><sup>133</sup></a> The ARBiH <a href="505th_Brigade" title="wikilink">505th</a> and 511th Mountain Brigades advanced north to Dvor and engaged the ARSK 33rd Infantry Brigade—the only reserve unit of the Banija Corps.<a href="#fn134" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref134"><sup>134</sup></a></p>

<p>The TG2 advanced to Petrinja at about 7 a.m. after a heavy artillery preparation. The 12th Home Guard Regiment entered the city from the west and was subsequently assigned to garrison Petrinja and its surrounding area. After the loss of Petrinja to the HV, the bulk of the ARSK Banija Corps started to retreat towards <a href="Dvor,_Croatia" title="wikilink">Dvor</a>. The HV 57th Brigade advanced against light resistance and took control of the Petrinja–Hrvatska Kostajnica road. During the night of 6/7 August, the 20th Home Guard Regiment, supported by Croatian police and elements of the 153rd Brigade, captured Glina despite strong resistance. The 153rd Brigade then took positions that allowed the advance to continue towards the village of <a href="Maja,_Croatia" title="wikilink">Maja</a> in coordination with the 2nd Guards Brigade, which drove south from Petrinja towards <a href="Zrinska_gora" title="wikilink">Zrinska gora</a> conducting mop-up operations. The 140th Home Guard Regiment flanked the 2nd Guards Brigade on the northern slope of Zrinska Gora, while the 57th Brigade captured <a href="Umeti&lt;U+0107&gt;" class="uri" title="wikilink">Umeti&lt;U+0107&gt;</a>. The 103rd and the 151st Brigades, and the 17th Home Guard Regiment, advanced towards Hrvatska Kostajnica, with the addition of a battalion of the HV 145th Brigade which would arrive that afternoon. Around noon, the 151st Brigade connected with the Bjelovar Corps units on the Sunja–Hrvatska Dubica road. They were assigned to secure roads in the area afterwards.<a href="#fn144" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref144"><sup>144</sup></a></p>
<p>By capturing Glina, the HV trapped the bulk of the ARSK Kordun Corps and about 35,000 evacuating civilians in the area of Topusko, prompting its commander to request UNCRO protection. The 1st Guards Brigade, approaching Topusko from Vojni&lt;U+0107&gt;, received orders to engage the ARSK Kordun Corps, but the orders were cancelled at midnight by the chief of the HV General Staff. Instead, the Zagreb Corps was instructed to prepare a brigade-strength unit to escort unarmed persons and ARSK officers and <a href="non-commissioned_officer" title="wikilink">non-commissioned officers</a> with <a href="side_arm" title="wikilink">side arms</a> to Dvor and allow them to cross into Bosnia and Herzegovina.

<p>A forward command post of the HV General Staff was moved from Ogulin to Slunj, and it assumed direct command of the 1st Guards Brigade, the 14th Home Guard Regiment and the 99th Brigade. The 14th Home Guard Regiment secured the Slunj area and deployed to the left bank of Korana to connect with the advancing Karlovac special police. Elements of the regiment and the 99th Brigade secured the national border in the area. The 1st Guards Brigade advanced towards Kordun, as the Karlovac Corps reoriented its main axis of attack. The 110th Home Guard Regiment and elements of the 104th Brigade reached a largely deserted Vojni&lt;U+0107&gt; in early afternoon, followed by the 1st Guards Brigade, the 143rd Home Guard Brigade and the 137th Home Guard Regiment.

<p>The 2nd Guards Brigade advanced from Maja towards Dvor, but was stopped approximately  short by ARSK units protecting the withdrawal of the ARSK and civilians towards the town.

<h2 id="assessment-of-the-battle">Assessment of the battle</h2>

<p>Operation Storm became the largest European land battle since the Second World War,<a href="#fn187" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref187"><sup>187</sup></a> encompassing a  frontline.<a href="#fn188" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref188"><sup>188</sup></a> It was a <a href="decisive_victory" title="wikilink">decisive victory</a> for Croatia,<a href="#fn189" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref189"><sup>189</sup></a> restoring its control over  of territory, representing 18.4% of the country.<a href="#fn190" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref190"><sup>190</sup></a> Losses sustained by the HV and the special police are most often cited as 174 killed and 1,430 wounded,<a href="#fn191" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref191"><sup>191</sup></a> but a government report prepared weeks after the battle specified 211 killed or missing, 1,100 wounded and three captured troops. By 21 August, Croatian authorities recovered and buried 560 ARSK troops killed in the battle. The HV captured 4,000 <a href="Prisoner_of_war" title="wikilink">prisoners of war</a>,<a href="#fn192" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref192"><sup>192</sup></a> 54 armoured and 497 other vehicles, six aircraft, hundreds of artillery pieces and over 4,000 infantry weapons.<a href="#fn193" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref193"><sup>193</sup></a> Four UN peacekeepers were killed—three as a result of HV actions and one as a result of ARSK activities—and 16 injured. The HV destroyed 98 UN observation posts.<a href="#fn194" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref194"><sup>194</sup></a></p>
<p>The HV's success was a result of a series of improvements to the HV itself and crucial breakthroughs made in the ARSK positions that were subsequently exploited by the HV and the ARBiH. The attack was not immediately successful everywhere, but the seizing of key positions led to the collapse of the ARSK command structure and overall defensive capability.<a href="#fn195" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref195"><sup>195</sup></a> The HV's capture of Bosansko Grahovo just before Operation Storm and the special police's advance to Gra&lt;U+010D&gt;ac made Knin nearly impossible to defend.<a href="#fn196" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref196"><sup>196</sup></a> In Lika, two Guards brigades rapidly cut the ARSK-held area lacking tactical depth or mobile reserve forces, isolating pockets of resistance and placing the 1st Guards Brigade in a position that allowed it to move north into the Karlovac Corps AOR, pushing ARSK forces towards Banovina. The defeat of the ARSK at Glina and Petrinja, after heavy fighting, also defeated the ARSK Banija Corps, as its reserve became immobilized by the ARBiH. The ARSK force was capable of containing or substantially holding assaults by regular HV brigades and the Home Guard, but attacks by the Guards brigades and the special police proved to be decisive.<a href="#fn197" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref197"><sup>197</sup></a> Colonel <a href="Andrew_Leslie_(general)" title="wikilink">Andrew Leslie</a>, commanding the UNCRO in the Knin area,<a href="#fn198" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref198"><sup>198</sup></a> assessed Operation Storm as a textbook operation that would have &quot;scored an <a href="A+_(grade)" title="wikilink">A-plus</a>&quot; by NATO standards.<a href="#fn199" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref199"><sup>199</sup></a></p>
<p>Even if the ARBiH had not provided aid, the HV would almost certainly have defeated the Banija Corps on its own, albeit at greater cost. The lack of reserves was the ARSK's key weakness that was exploited by the HV and the ARBiH since the ARSK's static defence could not cope with fast-paced attacks. The ARSK military was unable to check outflanking manoeuvres and their Special Units Corps failed as a mobile reserve, holding back the HV's 1st Guards Brigade south of Slunj for less than a single day.<a href="#fn200" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref200"><sup>200</sup></a> The ARSK traditionally counted on the VRS and the Yugoslav military as its strategic reserve, but the situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina immobilized the VRS reserves and Yugoslavia did not intervene militarily as Milo&lt;U+0161&gt;evi&lt;U+0107&gt; did not order it to do so. Even if he had wished to intervene, the speed of the battle would have allowed a very limited time for Yugoslavia to deploy appropriate reinforcements to support the ARSK.<a href="#fn201" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref201"><sup>201</sup></a></p>

<h3 id="return-of-the-refugees">Return of the refugees</h3>
<p>At the beginning of the Croatian War of Independence, in 1991–1992, a non-Serb population of more than 220,000 was forcibly removed from Serb-held territories in Croatia, as the RSK was established.<a href="#fn261" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref261"><sup>261</sup></a> In the wake of Operation Storm, a part of those refugees, as well as Croat refugees from Bosnia and Herzegovina, settled in a substantial number of housing units in the area formerly held by the ARSK, presenting an obstacle to the return of Serb refugees.<a href="#fn262" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref262"><sup>262</sup></a> , out of 300,000–350,000 Serbs who fled from Croatia during the entire war,<a href="#fn263" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref263"><sup>263</sup></a> 132,707 are registered as having returned,<a href="#fn264" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref264"><sup>264</sup></a> but only 60–65% of those are believed to reside permanently in the country. However, only 20,000–25,000 more are interested in returning to Croatia.<a href="#fn265" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref265"><sup>265</sup></a> , approximately 60,000 Serb refugees from Croatia remained in Serbia.<a href="#fn266" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref266"><sup>266</sup></a></p>
<p>The return of refugees has been hampered by several obstacles. These include property ownership and accommodation, as Croat refugees settled in vacated homes,<a href="#fn267" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref267"><sup>267</sup></a> and Croatian war-time legislation that stripped the refugees once living in government-owned housing of their tenancy rights. The legislation was abolished after the end of the war,<a href="#fn268" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref268"><sup>268</sup></a> and alternative accommodation is offered to returnees.<a href="#fn269" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref269"><sup>269</sup></a> 6,538 housing units were allocated by November 2010. Another obstacle is the difficulty for refugees to obtain residency status or Croatian citizenship. Applicable legislation has been relaxed since, and by November 2010, Croatia has allowed the validation of identity documents issued by the RSK.<a href="#fn270" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref270"><sup>270</sup></a> Even though Croatia declared a general amnesty, refugees fear legal prosecution,<a href="#fn271" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref271"><sup>271</sup></a> as the amnesty does not pertain to war crimes.<a href="#fn272" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref272"><sup>272</sup></a> The final obstacle to the return of refugees is the lack of vocational opportunities due to the poor economic situation in Croatia.<a href="#fn273" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref273"><sup>273</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="war-crimes">War crimes</h2>

<p>The <a href="International_Criminal_Tribunal_for_the_former_Yugoslavia" title="wikilink">International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia</a> (ICTY), set up in 1993 based on the <a href="United_Nations_Security_Council_Resolution_827" title="wikilink">UN Security Council Resolution 827</a>,<a href="#fn274" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref274"><sup>274</sup></a> indicted Gotovina, &lt;U+010C&gt;ermak and Marka&lt;U+010D&gt; for war crimes, specifically for their roles in Operation Storm, citing their participation in a <a href="joint_criminal_enterprise" title="wikilink">joint criminal enterprise</a> (JCE) aimed at the permanent removal of Serbs from the ARSK-held part of Croatia. The ICTY charges specified that other participants in the JCE were Tu&lt;U+0111&gt;man, &lt;U+0160&gt;u&lt;U+0161&gt;ak, and Bobetko and &lt;U+010C&gt;ervenko,<a href="#fn275" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref275"><sup>275</sup></a> however all except Bobetko were dead before the first relevant ICTY indictment was issued in 2001.<a href="#fn276" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref276"><sup>276</sup></a> Bobetko was indicted by the ICTY, but died a year later, before he could be extradited for trial at the ICTY.<a href="#fn277" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref277"><sup>277</sup></a> The <a href="Trial_of_Gotovina_et_al" title="wikilink">Trial of Gotovina et al</a> began in 2008,<a href="#fn278" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref278"><sup>278</sup></a> leading to convictions of Gotovina and Marka&lt;U+010D&gt; and the acquittal of &lt;U+010C&gt;ermak three years later.<a href="#fn279" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref279"><sup>279</sup></a> Gotovina and Marka&lt;U+010D&gt; were acquitted on appeal in November 2012,<a href="#fn280" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref280"><sup>280</sup></a> in a ruling that exonerated the two generals as well as Croatia's political leaders of the 1990s, as the ICTY no longer considered Operation Storm to have been aimed at ethnic persecution.<a href="#fn281" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref281"><sup>281</sup></a></p>
<p>The number of civilian casualties in Operation Storm is disputed. The State Attorney's Office of the Republic of Croatia claims that 214 civilians were killed—156 in 24 instances of war crimes and another 47 as victims of murder—during the battle and in its immediate aftermath. The <a href="Croatian_Helsinki_Committee" title="wikilink">Croatian Helsinki Committee</a> disputes the claim and reports that 677 civilians were killed during the same period,<a href="#fn282" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref282"><sup>282</sup></a> however their report was rejected by the ICTY, when submitted as evidence, due to unsourced statements and double entries contained in the report.<a href="#fn283" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref283"><sup>283</sup></a> Serbian sources quote 1,192 civilians dead or missing.<a href="#fn284" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref284"><sup>284</sup></a> The ICTY prosecutors set civilian deaths at 324.<a href="#fn285" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref285"><sup>285</sup></a></p>
<p>Although it was very difficult to determine the number of properties destroyed during and after Operation Storm since a large number of houses sustained some degree of damage since the beginning of the war,<a href="#fn286" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref286"><sup>286</sup></a> <a href="Human_Rights_Watch" title="wikilink">Human Rights Watch</a> estimated that more than 5,000 houses were destroyed in the area during and after the battle.<a href="#fn287" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref287"><sup>287</sup></a> Out of the 122 <a href="Serbian_Orthodox_Church" title="wikilink">Serbian Orthodox</a> churches in the area, one was destroyed and 17 were damaged, but most of the damage to the churches occurred prior to the Serb retreat.<a href="#fn288" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref288"><sup>288</sup></a></p>

<p>, Croatian authorities have received 6,390 reports of crimes committed in the area during or after Operation Storm and have convicted 2,380 persons for looting, arson, murders, war crimes and other illegal acts. As of the same date, 24 more trials of war crimes related to Operation Storm were in progress.<a href="#fn289" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref289"><sup>289</sup></a> In 2012, Serbian authorities were investigating five cases of war crimes committed during Operation Storm.<a href="#fn290" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref290"><sup>290</sup></a> The military operation also allowed Croatian authorities access to areas where, , a total of 144 <a href="mass_grave" title="wikilink">mass</a> and 1,200 individual graves have been discovered, in which a total of 3,809 Croatian civilians and military personnel were buried.<a href="#fn291" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref291"><sup>291</sup></a></p>
