<p>In the <a href="Ancient_Egypt" title="wikilink">Egyptian</a>, <a href="Ancient_Greece" title="wikilink">Greek</a> and <a href="Roman_empire" title="wikilink">Roman empires</a>, women usually fed only their own children. However, breastfeeding began to be seen as something too common to be done by royalty, and <a href="wet_nurse" title="wikilink">wet nurses</a> were employed to breastfeed the children of the royal families. This was extended over the ages, particularly in western Europe, where <a href="nobility" title="wikilink">noble women</a> often made use of wet nurses. The <a href="Moche_(culture)" title="wikilink">Moche</a> artisans of Peru (1&lt;U+2013&gt;800 A.D.) represented women breastfeeding their children in ceramic vessels.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>

<p>Traditionally, Japanese women <a href="home_birth" title="wikilink">gave birth at home</a> and breastfed with the help of breast <a href="massage" class="uri" title="wikilink">massage</a>. Weaning was often late, with breastfeeding in rare cases continuing until early adolescence. After World War II <a href="Western_medicine" title="wikilink">Western medicine</a> was taken to Japan and the women began <a href="childbirth" title="wikilink">giving birth</a> in hospitals, where the baby was usually taken to the nursery and fed formula. In 1974 a new breastfeeding promotional campaign by the government helped to boost the awareness of its benefits and its prevalence has sharply increased. Japan became the first developed country to have a <a href="Baby_Friendly_Hospital_Initiative" title="wikilink">baby-friendly hospital</a>, and as of 2006 has another 24 such facilities.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>

<p><img src="Siemiginowski_close-up.jpg" title="fig:|Queen Marie Casimire with her son, 1684." alt="|Queen Marie Casimire with her son, 1684." /> In the 18th century male medical practitioners started to work on the areas of pregnancy, birth and babies. These areas were traditionally dominated by women.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> Also in the 18th century the emerging natural sciences argued that women should stay at home to nurse and raise their children, like animals also do.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> Governments in Europe started to worry about the decline of the workforce because of the high mortality rates among newborns. Wet nursing was considered one of the main problems. Campaigns were launched against the custom among the higher class to use a wet nurse. Women were advised or even forced by law to nurse their own children.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> The biologist and physician <a href="Linnaeus" class="uri" title="wikilink">Linnaeus</a>, the English doctor Cadogan,<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> Rousseau, and the midwife Anel le Rebours described in their writings the advantages and necessity of women breastfeeding their own children and discouraged the practice of wet nursing. In 1752 Linnaeus wrote a pamphlet against the use of a wet nurse. Linnaeus considered this against the law of nature. A baby not nursed by the mother was deprived of the laxative colostrum. Linnaeus thought that the lower class wet nurse ate too much fat, drank alcohol and had contagious (venereal) diseases, therefore producing lethal milk.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p>Mother's milk was considered a miracle fluid which could cure people and give wisdom. The mythical figure Philosophia-Sapientia, the personification of wisdom, suckled philosophers at her breast and by this way they absorbed wisdom and moral virtue.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> On the other hand, lactation was what connected humans with animals. Linnaeus &lt;U+2013&gt; who classified the realm of animals &lt;U+2013&gt; did not by accident rename the category 'quadrupedia' (four footed) in 'mammalia' (mammals). With this act he made the lactating female breast the icon of this class of animals in which humans were classified.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a><a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="nineteenth-century">Nineteenth century</h2>
<p>Historian Rima D. Apple writes in her book <em>Mothers and Medicine. A Social History of Infant Feeding, 1890&lt;U+2013&gt;1950</em> that in the United States of America most babies got breastmilk.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> Dutch historian Van Eekelen researched the small amount of available evidence of breastfeeding practices in The Netherlands. Around 1860 in the Dutch province of Zeeland about 67% of babies were nursed, but there were big differences within the region.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> Women were obliged to nurse their babies: &lt;U+201C&gt;Every mother ought to nurse her own child, if she is fit to do it (...) no woman is fit to have a child who is not fit to nurse it.&lt;U+201D&gt;<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<p>Mother's milk was considered best for babies, but the quality of the breastmilk was found to be varied. The quality of breastmilk was considered good only if the mother had a good diet, had physical exercise and was mentally in balance.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> In Europe (especially in France) and less in the USA it was a practice among the higher and middle class to hire a wet nurse. If it was too difficult to find a wet nurse, people used formula to feed their babies, but this was considered very dangerous for the health and life of the baby.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="decline-and-resurgence-in-the-20th-and-21st-centuries">Decline and resurgence in the 20th and 21st centuries</h2>
<p>Breastfeeding in the Western world declined significantily from the late 1800s to the 1960s.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> By the 1950s, the predominant attitude to breastfeeding was that is was something practiced by the uneducated and those of lower classes. The practice was consider old-fashion and &quot;a little disgusting&quot; for those who could not afford infant formula and discouraged by medical practioners and media of the time.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> Letters and editorials to <a href="Chatelaine_(magazine)" title="wikilink">Chatelaine</a> from 1945 to as late as 1995 regarding breastfeeding were predominately negative.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> However, since the middle 1960s there has been a steady resurgence in the practice of breastfeeding in Canada and the US, especially among more educated, affluent women.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="canada">Canada</h3>
<p>A 1994 Canadian government health survey found that 73% of Canadian mothers initiated breastfeeding, up from 38% in 1963. It has been speculated that the gap between breastfeeding generations in Canada contributes to the lack of success of those who do attempt it: new parents cannot look to older family members for help with breastfeeding since they are also ignorant on the topic.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> Western Canadians are more likely to breastfeed; just 53% of Atlantic province mothers breastfeed, compared to 87% in British Columbia. More than 90% of women surveyed said they breastfeed because it provides more benefits for the baby than does formula. Of women who did not breastfeed, 40% said formula feeding was easier (the most prevalent answer). Women who were older, more educated, had higher income, and were married were the most likely to breastfeed. Immigrant women were also more likely to breastfeed. About 40% of mothers who breastfeed do so for less than three months. Women were most likely to discontinue breastfeeding if they perceived themselves to have insufficient milk. However, among women who breastfed for more than three months, returning to work or a previous decision to stop at that time were the top reasons.</p>
<p>A 2003 <a href="La_Leche_League_International" title="wikilink">La Leche League International</a> study found that 72% of Canadian mothers initiate breastfeeding and that 31% continue to do so past four to five months.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a></p>
<p>A 1996 article in the Canadian Journal of Public Health found that, in Vancouver, 82.9% of mothers initiated breastfeeding, but that this differed by Caucasian (91.6%) and non-Caucasian (56.8%) women.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> Just 18.2% of mothers breastfeed at nine months; breastfeeding practices were significantly associated with the mothers' marital status, education and family income.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="cuba">Cuba</h3>
<p>Since 1940, <a href="Cuba" class="uri" title="wikilink">Cuba</a>'s constitution has contained a provision officially recognising and supporting breastfeeding. Article 68 of the 1975 constitution reads, in part: <em>During the six weeks immediately preceding childbirth and the six weeks following, a woman shall enjoy obligatory vacation from work on pay at the same rate, retaining her employment and all the rights pertaining to such employment and to her labour contract. During the nursing period, two extraordinary daily rest periods of a half hour each shall be allowed her to feed her child</em>.</p>
<h3 id="developing-nations">Developing nations</h3>
<p>In many countries, particularly those with a generally poor level of health, <a href="malnutrition" class="uri" title="wikilink">malnutrition</a> is the major cause of death in children under 5, with 50% of all those cases being within the first year of life.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> International organisations such as <a href="Plan_International" title="wikilink">Plan International</a> and <a href="La_Leche_League" title="wikilink">La Leche League</a> have helped to promote breastfeeding around the world, educating new mothers and helping the governments to develop strategies to increase the number of women exclusively breastfeeding.</p>
<p>Traditional beliefs in many developing countries give different advice to women raising their newborn child. In <a href="Ghana" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ghana</a> babies are still frequently fed with tea alongside breastfeeding, reducing the benefits of breastfeeding and inhibiting the absorption of iron, important in the prevention of <a href="iron_deficiency_anemia" title="wikilink">anaemia</a>.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="publicity-promotion-and-law">Publicity, promotion and law</h2>
<p>In response to public pressure, the health departments of various governments have recognised the importance of encouraging mothers to breastfeed. The required provision of <a href="baby_changing_facilities" title="wikilink">baby changing facilities</a> was a large step towards making public places more accessible for parents and in many countries there are now laws in place to protect the rights of a breastfeeding mother when feeding her child in public.</p>
<p>The <a href="World_Health_Organization" title="wikilink">World Health Organization</a> (WHO), along with grassroots non-governmental organisations like the <a href="International_Baby_Food_Action_Network" title="wikilink">International Baby Food Action Network</a> (IBFAN) have played a large role in encouraging these governmental departments to promote breastfeeding. Under this advice they have developed national breastfeeding strategies, including the promotion of its benefits and attempts to encourage mothers, particularly those under the age of 25, to choose to feed their child with breast milk.</p>
<p>Government campaigns and strategies around the world include:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.breastfeeding.nhs.uk/nb_nbaw.asp">National Breastfeeding Week</a> in the United Kingdom</li>
<li>The <a href="http://www.health.gov.au/pubhlth/strateg/brfeed/index.htm">Department of Health and Ageing Breastfeeding Strategy</a> in Australia</li>

<li><a href="http://www.waba.org.my/">World Breastfeeding Week</a></li>
</ul>
<p>However, there has been a long, ongoing struggle between corporations promoting artificial substitutes and grassroots organisations and WHO promoting breastfeeding. The <a href="International_Code_of_Marketing_of_Breast-milk_Substitutes" title="wikilink">International Code of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes</a> was developed in 1981 by WHO, but violations have been reported by organisations, including those networked in IBFAN. In particular, <a href="Nestl&lt;U+00E9&gt;" class="uri" title="wikilink">Nestl&lt;U+00E9&gt;</a> took three years before it initially implemented the code, and in the late 1990s and early 2000s was again found in violation. Nestl&lt;U+00E9&gt; had previously faced a <a href="boycott" class="uri" title="wikilink">boycott</a>, beginning in the U.S. but soon spreading through the rest of the world, for marketing practices in the third world (see <a href="Nestl&lt;U+00E9&gt;_boycott" title="wikilink">Nestl&lt;U+00E9&gt; boycott</a>).</p>
<h3 id="breastfeeding-in-public">Breastfeeding in public</h3>

<p>A breastfeeding mother <a href="public_space" title="wikilink">in public</a> with her baby will often need to breastfeed her child. A baby's need to feed cannot be determined by a set schedule, so legal and social rules about <a href="indecent_exposure" title="wikilink">indecent exposure</a> and <a href="dress_code" title="wikilink">dress code</a> are often adapted to meet this need.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> Many laws around the world make public breastfeeding legal and disallow companies from prohibiting it in the workplace, but the reaction of some people to the sight of breastfeeding can make things uncomfortable for those involved.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> Some breastfeeding mothers feel reluctant to breastfeed in public.</p>

<p>Feeding vessels dating from about 2000 BC have been found in Egypt. A mother holding a very modern-looking nursing bottle in one hand and a stick, presumably to mix the food, in the other is depicted in a relief found in the ruins of the palace of King <a href="Ashurbanipal" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ashurbanipal</a> of <a href="Nineveh" class="uri" title="wikilink">Nineveh</a>&lt;U+2014&gt;who died in 888 BC.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> Clay feeding vessels were found in graves with infants from the first to fifth centuries AD in Rome.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a></p>
<p>Valerie Fildes writes in her book <em>Breasts, bottles and babies. A history of Infant Feeding</em> about examples from the 9th to 15th centuries of children getting animal's milk. In the 17th and 18th century Icelandic babies got cow's milk with cream and butter.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1582, the Italian physician <a href="Geronimo_Mercuriali" title="wikilink">Geronimo Mercuriali</a> wrote in <em>De morbis mulieribus</em> (<em>On the diseases of women</em>) that women generally finished breastfeeding an infant exclusively after the third month and entirely around 13 months of age.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a></p>
<p>The feeding of flour or cereal mixed with <a href="broth" class="uri" title="wikilink">broth</a> or water became the next alternative in the 19th century, but once again quickly faded. Around this time there became an obvious disparity in the feeding habits of those living in rural areas and those in urban areas. Most likely due to the availability of alternative foods, babies in urban areas were breastfed for a much shorter length of time, supplementing the feeds earlier than those in rural areas.</p>
<p>Though first developed by <a href="Henri_Nestl&lt;U+00E9&gt;" title="wikilink">Henri Nestl&lt;U+00E9&gt;</a> in the 1860s, <a href="infant_formula" title="wikilink">infant formula</a> received a huge boost during the <a href="post&lt;U+2013&gt;World_War_II_baby_boom" title="wikilink">post&lt;U+2013&gt;World War II baby boom</a>. When business and births decreased, and government strategies in <a href="industrialised_countries" title="wikilink">industrialised countries</a> attempted to highlight the benefits of breastfeeding, <a href="Nestl&lt;U+00E9&gt;" class="uri" title="wikilink">Nestl&lt;U+00E9&gt;</a> and other such companies focused their aggressive marketing campaigns on <a href="developing_countries" title="wikilink">developing countries</a>. In 1979 the <a href="International_Baby_Food_Action_Network" title="wikilink">International Baby Food Action Network</a> (IBFAN) was formed to help raise awareness of such practices as supplementary feeding of <a href="neonate" title="wikilink">new babies</a> with formula and the inappropriate promotion of baby formula, and to help change attitudes that discourage or inhibit mothers from breastfeeding their babies.</p>
