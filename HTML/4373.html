<p>Launched on July 26, 1941, by Richard Field Lewis, Jr., WINC was Winchester's first radio station. It remained in the hands of the Lewis family until sold to North Carolina-based <a href="Centennial_Broadcasting" title="wikilink">Centennial Broadcasting</a> in 2007. The station's current <a href="Radio_format" title="wikilink">format</a>, established in 1996, consists mostly of <a href="Conservative_talk_radio" title="wikilink">conservative talk</a> programs and top-of-the-hour news from <a href="Fox_News_Radio" title="wikilink">Fox News Radio</a>. Sports programming from <a href="Virginia_Tech" title="wikilink">Virginia Tech</a> is also broadcast.

<p>Several milestones have occurred during the station's more-than-70 years of history. WINC was the station on which <a href="country_music" title="wikilink">country music</a> legend <a href="Patsy_Cline" title="wikilink">Patsy Cline</a> made her debut in 1948, when Cline asked the leader of a &quot;hillbilly band&quot; for a chance to perform with them on air.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> In the late 1950s, the station's chief engineer, Philip Whitney, designed a <a href="CONELRAD" class="uri" title="wikilink">CONELRAD</a> alarm device for FM stations to warn listeners in the event of an enemy attack during the <a href="Cold_War" title="wikilink">Cold War</a>. Whitney also created many of the <a href="radio_control" title="wikilink">remote control systems</a> used by radio stations. He was awarded for his work by the <a href="National_Association_of_Broadcasters" title="wikilink">National Association of Broadcasters</a> in 1970. WINC had difficulty renewing its license in the early 1970s, as it was airing 22 minutes of commercials per hour&lt;U+2014&gt;in excess of what the <a href="Federal_Communications_Commission" title="wikilink">Federal Communications Commission</a> (FCC) permitted. The station encountered further trouble in 1988 when a local prosecutor called one of its promotions an &quot;illegal cash lottery&quot;; a judge disagreed.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> In that same year, the news department at WINC received an Associated Press Broadcasters Association national award for &quot;Best Radio Spot News&quot;.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
