<p><strong>Tom Wesselmann</strong> (<a href="February_23" title="wikilink">February 23</a> <a href="1931" class="uri" title="wikilink">1931</a>, <a href="Cincinnati,_Ohio" title="wikilink">Cincinnati</a> - <a href="December_17" title="wikilink">December 17</a> <a href="2004" class="uri" title="wikilink">2004</a>) was an <a href="United_States" title="wikilink">American</a> <a href="pop_art" title="wikilink">pop artist</a> who specialized in <a href="found_art" title="wikilink">found art</a> <a href="collage" title="wikilink">collages</a>.</p>
<h2 id="early-years">Early years</h2>
<p>From 1949 to 1951 he attended college in Ohio; first at <a href="Hiram_College" title="wikilink">Hiram College</a>, and then transferred to major in Psychology at the <a href="University_of_Cincinnati" title="wikilink">University of Cincinnati</a>. He was drafted into the <a href="US_Army" title="wikilink">US Army</a> in 1952, but spent his service years stateside. During that time he made his first cartoons, and became interested in pursuing a career in cartooning. After his discharge he completed his psychology degree in 1954, whereupon he began to study drawing at the <a href="Art_Academy_of_Cincinnati" title="wikilink">Art Academy of Cincinnati</a>. He achieved some initial success when he sold his first cartoon strips to the magazines <em>1000 Jokes</em> and <em><a href="True_(magazine)" title="wikilink">True</a>.</em></p>
<p><a href="Cooper_Union" title="wikilink">Cooper Union</a> accepted him in 1956, and he continued his studies in New York. During a visit to the <a href="MoMA" class="uri" title="wikilink">MoMA</a> he was inspired by the <a href="Robert_Motherwell" title="wikilink">Robert Motherwell</a> painting <em>Elegy to the Spanish Republic</em>: &lt;U+201C&gt;The first aesthetic experience&lt;U+2026&gt; He felt a sensation of high visceral excitement in his stomach, and it seemed as though his eyes and stomach were directly connected&lt;U+201D&gt;<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Wesselmann also admired the work of <a href="Willem_de_Kooning" title="wikilink">Willem de Kooning</a>, but he soon rejected <a href="action_painting" title="wikilink">action painting</a>: &lt;U+201C&gt;He realized he had to find his own passion he felt he had to deny to himself all that he loved in de Kooning, and go in as opposite a direction as possible.&quot;<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a>.</p>
<p>In 1957 Wesselmann met Claire Selley, another Cooper Union student who was to become his friend, model, and later, his wife. 1958 was a pivotal year for Wesselmann. A landscape painting trip to Cooper Union's Green Camp in rural <a href="New_Jersey" title="wikilink">New Jersey</a>, brought him to the realization that he could pursue painting, rather than cartooning, as a career. <a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a>.</p>
<h2 id="career-in-the-1960s">Career in the 1960s</h2>
<p><strong>1959-1964</strong> - After graduation Wesselmann became one of the founding members of the Judson Gallery, along with Marc Ratliff and <a href="Jim_Dine" title="wikilink">Jim Dine</a>, also from Cincinnati, who had just arrived in New York. He and Ratliff showed a number of small collages in a two-man exhibition at Judson Gallery. He began to teach art at a public school in <a href="Brooklyn" class="uri" title="wikilink">Brooklyn</a>, and later at the <a href="High_School_of_Art_and_Design" title="wikilink">High School of Art and Design</a>.</p>
<p>Wesselmann's series <em>Great American Nude</em> (begun 1961) first brought him to the attention of the art world. After a dream concerning the phrase &quot;red, white, and blue&quot;, he decided to paint a <em>Great American Nude</em> in a palette limited to those colors and any colors associated with patriotic motifs such as gold and khaki <a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a>. The series incorporated representational images with an accordingly patriotic theme, such as American landscape photos and portraits of founding fathers. Often these images were collaged from magazines and discarded posters, which called for a larger format than Wesselmann had used previously. As works began to approach a giant scale he approached advertisers directly to acquire billboards. Through <a href="Henry_Geldzahler" title="wikilink">Henry Geldzahler</a> Wesselmann met <a href="Alex_Katz" title="wikilink">Alex Katz</a>, who offered him a show at the <a href="Tenth_street_galleries" title="wikilink">Tanager Gallery</a>. Wesselmann's first solo show was held there later that year, representing both the large and small <em>Great American Nude</em> collages. In 1962 Richard Bellamy offered him a one-man exhibition at the Green Gallery. About the same time, Ivan Karp of the <a href="Leo_Castelli" title="wikilink">Leo Castelli</a> <a href="Gallery" class="uri" title="wikilink">Gallery</a> put Wesselmann in touch with several collectors and talked to him about <a href="Roy_Lichtenstein" title="wikilink">Roy Lichtenstein</a> and <a href="James_Rosenquist" title="wikilink">James Rosenquist</a>&lt;U+2019&gt;s works. These Wesselmann viewed without noting any similarities with his own .</p>
<p>While not a cohesive movement, the idea of <a href="Pop_Art" title="wikilink">Pop Art</a> (a name coined by <a href="Lawrence_Alloway" title="wikilink">Lawrence Alloway</a> and others) was gradually spreading among international <a href="art_critics" title="wikilink">art critics</a> and the public. In As Henry Geldzahler observed: &lt;U+201C&gt;About a year and a half ago I saw the works of Wesselmann..., Warhol, Rosenquist and Lichtenstein in their studios (it was more or less July 1961). They were working independently, unaware of each other, but drawing on a common source of imagination. In the space of a year and a half they put on exhibitions, created a movement and we are now here discussing the matter in a conference. This is instant history of art, a history of art that became so aware of itself as to make a leap that went beyond art itself&lt;U+201D&gt; <a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="Sidney_Janis" title="wikilink">Sidney Janis</a> <a href="Gallery" class="uri" title="wikilink">Gallery</a> held the <em>New Realist Exhibition</em> in November 1962, which included works by the American artists <a href="Jim_Dine" title="wikilink">Jim Dine</a>, <a href="Robert_Indiana" title="wikilink">Robert Indiana</a>, <a href="Roy_Lichtenstein" title="wikilink">Roy Lichtenstein</a>, <a href="Claes_Oldenburg" title="wikilink">Claes Oldenburg</a>, <a href="James_Rosenquist" title="wikilink">James Rosenquist</a>, <a href="George_Segal_(artist)" title="wikilink">George Segal</a>, and <a href="Andy_Warhol" title="wikilink">Andy Warhol</a>; and Europeans such as <a href="Arman" class="uri" title="wikilink">Arman</a>, Baj, <a href="Christo" class="uri" title="wikilink">Christo</a>, <a href="Yves_Klein" title="wikilink">Yves Klein</a>, Festa, Rotella, <a href="Jean_Tinguely" title="wikilink">Jean Tinguely</a>, and Schifano. It followed the <a href="Nouveau_R&lt;U+00E9&gt;alisme" title="wikilink">Nouveau R&lt;U+00E9&gt;alisme</a> exhibition at the Galerie Rive Droite in <a href="Paris" class="uri" title="wikilink">Paris</a>, and marked the international debut of the artists who soon gave rise to what came to be called <a href="Pop_Art" title="wikilink">Pop Art</a> in Britain and The United States and <a href="Nouveau_R&lt;U+00E9&gt;alisme" title="wikilink">Nouveau R&lt;U+00E9&gt;alisme</a> on the European continent. Wesselmann took part in the <em>New Realist</em> show with some reservations <a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a>, exhibiting two 1962 works: <em>Still life #17</em> and <em>Still life #22</em>.</p>
<p>Wesselmann never liked his inclusion in <a href="United_States" title="wikilink">American</a> <a href="Pop_Art" title="wikilink">Pop Art</a>, pointing out how he made an <a href="aesthetic" class="uri" title="wikilink">aesthetic</a> use of everyday objects and not a criticism of them as consumer objects: &lt;U+201C&gt;I dislike labels in general and 'Pop' in particular, especially because it overemphasizes the material used. There does seem to be a tendency to use similar materials and images, but the different ways they are used denies any kind of group intention&lt;U+201D&gt; <a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a>.</p>
<p>That year, Wesselmann had begun working on a new series of still lifes. These continued to use collage but also incorporating found objects: he accumulated shelves, television sets, a refrigerator (for <em>Still Life #20</em>) and used them in new <a href="assemblage" title="wikilink">assemblages</a>. The plastic corncob in <em>Still Life #24</em> was bought by Wesselmann from a corn seller for 50 dollars .</p>
<p>His experimentation with still life intensified: in <em>Still Life #28</em> he included a television set that was turned on, &lt;U+201C&gt;interested in the competitive demands that a TV, with moving images and giving off light and sound, can make on painted portions&lt;U+201D&gt; <a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> He concentrated on the juxtapositions of different elements and depictions, which were at the time truly exciting for him: &lt;U+201C&gt;Not just the differences between what they were, but the aura each had with it. They each had such a fulfilled reality: the reverberations seemed a way of making a picture more intense. A painted pack of cigarettes next to a painted apple wasn&lt;U+2019&gt;t enough for me. They are both the same kind of thing. But if one is from a cigarette ad and the other a painted apple, they are two different realities and they trade on each other; lots of things &lt;U+2013&gt; bright strong colors, the qualities of materials, images from art histories or advertising &lt;U+2013&gt; trade on each other. This kind of relationship helps establish a momentum throughout the picture..., therefore throughout the picture all the elements compete with each other. At first glance, my pictures seem well behaved, as if &lt;U+2013&gt; that is a still life, O.K. But these things have such crazy give-and-take that I feel they get really very wild&lt;U+201D&gt; <a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a>. He married Claire Selley in November of 1963.</p>
<p>In 1964 Ben Birillo, an artist and business partner of gallery owner Paul Bianchini, contacted Wesselmann and other Pop artists with the goal of organizing <em>The American Supermarket</em> at the Bianchini Gallery in New York. This was an installation of a large supermarket where Pop works (Warhol&lt;U+2019&gt;s Campbell&lt;U+2019&gt;s Soup, Watts&lt;U+2019&gt;s colored wax eggs etc.) were shown among real food and neon signs. In the same year Wesselmann began working on landscapes, including one that includes the noise of a <a href="Volkswagen" class="uri" title="wikilink">Volkswagen</a> starting up. The first <a href="shaped_canvas" title="wikilink">shaped canvas</a> nudes also appeared this year.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<p><strong>1965-1968</strong></p>
<p>His works in these years: <em>Great American Nude #53</em>, <em>Great American Nude #57</em>, show an accentuated, more explicit, sensuality, as though celebrating the rediscovered sexual fulfilment of his new relationship <a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a>. He carried on working on his landscapes, but also made the <em>Great American Nude #82</em>, reworking the nude in a third dimension not defined by drawn lines but by medium: molded <a href="plexiglass" class="uri" title="wikilink">plexiglass</a> modeled on the female figure, then painted. His compositional focus also became more daring, narrowing down to isolate a single detail: the <em>Mouth</em> series began in 1965, his <em>Seascapes</em> began the following year. Two other new subjects also appeared: ''Bedroom Painting '', and <em>Smoker Study</em>, the latter of which developed from observation of his model for the <em>Mouth</em> series. The <em>Smoker Study</em> series of works would become one of the most recurrent themes in the 1970s <a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Beginning in 1965, Wesselmann made several studies for seascapes in <a href="oil_painting" title="wikilink">oil</a> while vacationing in <a href="Cape_Cod" title="wikilink">Cape Cod</a> and upstate New York. In his New York City studio, he used an old projector to enlarge them into large-format works. This series of views, called the <em>Drop-Out series</em> were constructed from the negative space around a breast. The breast and torso frame one side of the image while the arm and the leg form the other two sides. This series of works would become one of the most recurrent themes in the 1970s <a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a>. He started working on <a href="shaped_canvas" title="wikilink">shaped canvases</a> and opted for increasingly large formats. A participant at the 9th Biennale in <a href="S&lt;U+00E3&gt;o_Paulo,_Brazil" title="wikilink">S&lt;U+00E3&gt;o Paulo, Brazil</a>, the following year he was in <a href="Kassel" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kassel</a> for the fourth <a href="Documenta" class="uri" title="wikilink">Documenta</a>.</p>
<p><strong>1969-1970</strong></p>
<p>He worked constantly on the Bedroom Painting series in which elements of the Great American Nude, Still Lifes and Seascapes were juxtaposed (as can be seen in <em>Bedroom Painting #26</em>). With these works Wesselmann began to concentrate on a few details such as hands, feet (the first appear in <em>Little Seascape #1</em> of 1965), and breasts surrounded by flowers and objects. A major motivation of the Bedroom Paintings was to shift the focus and scale of the attendant objects around a nude; these objects are relatively small in relation to the nude, but become major, even dominant elements when the central element is a body part. He continued to rework his own vocabulary: the mouths of the Smokers can only just be seen through the clouds of smoke, and he started on the <em>Great American Nude #100</em>, 1970, the last of his <em>Great American Nudes,</em> which he finished in 1973. The breast of a concealed woman appeared in a box among Wesselmann's sculpted still life elements in a piece entitled <em>Bedroom Tit Box</em>, a key work that<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a>. <em>Still Life# 57</em> was purchased by MoMA, the Sidney Janis Gallery put on a new solo exhibit, and the <a href="Newport" class="uri" title="wikilink">Newport</a> Harbor Art Museum in California presented the monographic Early Still Lifes: 1962-1964.</p>
<h2 id="s">1970s</h2>
<p><strong>1970-1975</strong> - In 1972 Wesselmann had exhibitions in New York at the Sidney Janis Gallery, the Rosa Esman Gallery, and in Europe at the Aronowitsch Gallery in <a href="Stockholm" class="uri" title="wikilink">Stockholm</a>. He made <em>Still Life #59</em>, five panels that form a large, complex dimensional, freestanding painting: here too the elements are enlarged, and part of a telephone can be seen. A nail-polish bottle is tipped up on one side, and there is a vase of roses with a crumpled handkerchief next to it, and the framed portrait of a woman, actress <a href="Mary_Tyler_Moore" title="wikilink">Mary Tyler Moore</a>, whom Wesselmann considered as the ideal prototype girlfriend. These are works in which he made more recognizable portraits, with a less anonymous feel. In Bedroom painting #12 he inserted a self-portrait. <em>Still Life #60</em> appeared in 1974: the monumental outline, almost 26 feet (eight meters) long, of the sunglasses acts as a frame for the lipstick, nail polish and jewelry; a microcosm of contemporary femininity that Wesselmann took to the level of gigantism. His Smokers continued to change: he introduced the hand, with polished fingernails sparkling in the smoke. <a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a>. He exhibited at the Sidney Janis Gallery and at the Galerie des Quatre Mouvements in Paris, where he showed a series of Smokers Studies and sketches for his Bedroom Paintings, as well as the <em>Great American Nude #100</em> which he had just finished. With this he brought to an end the series devoted to the Great American Nude which, in its very name recalls the ironic cartoon-style titles of the Sixties: the &lt;U+201C&gt;Great American Dream&lt;U+201D&gt; and the &lt;U+201C&gt;Great American Novel&lt;U+201D&gt;. But of course the incontrovertible sensuality of Wesselmann&lt;U+2019&gt;s nudes was constantly accompanied by an ironic guiding thread that was clearly revealed in the artist&lt;U+2019&gt;s own words: <a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a>. His works were shown in a solo exhibit, Wesselmann &lt;U+2013&gt; The Early Years &lt;U+2013&gt; Collages 1959-1962 at <a href="California_State_University" title="wikilink">California State University</a> at <a href="Long_Beach" title="wikilink">Long Beach</a>, and in <em>American Art Since 1945</em> from the Collection of the Museum of Modern Art group exhibition at the <a href="Worcester_Art_Museum" title="wikilink">Worcester Art Museum</a>. This last exhibition toured to seven venues in 1975 and 1976.</p>
<p><strong>1976-1978</strong></p>
<p>In 1976 there was an exhibition at the Sidney Janis Gallery, followed by another the next year. The Galleria Gi&lt;U+00F2&gt; Marconi hosted a solo exhibition in Milan. Early in 1977 he was selected for the <em>American Art Since 1945</em> group show at MoMA, and started work on a new series of Bedroom Paintings. In these works he revised the formal construction of the composition, which was now cut by a diagonal, with one entire section being taken up by a woman&lt;U+2019&gt;s face in the very near foreground: <em>Bedroom Painting #43</em>, <em>Bedroom Painting #38</em>, <em>Bedroom Painting #39</em> (all made in ''1978). The <a href="Institute_of_Contemporary_Art" title="wikilink">Institute of Contemporary Art</a> in <a href="Boston" class="uri" title="wikilink">Boston</a> organized ''Tom Wesselmann: Graphics 1964-1977, and he exhibited at the Grand Palais in Paris and at the Galerie Serge de Bloe in <a href="Brussels" class="uri" title="wikilink">Brussels</a>.</p>

<p><strong>1979-1982</strong> In 1980 what is still today one of the most accurate and complete study of the evolution of the artist&lt;U+2019&gt;s work was published. The monograph <em>Tom Wesselmann</em> is an autobiography written under the pseudonym Slim Stealingworth. A new exhibition, <em>New Sculpture &amp; Paintings</em> by Tom Wesselmann, a solo exhibition at the Sidney Janis Gallery was held in 1980. His family was complete when, after daughter Jenny and son Lane, his daughter Kate was born. He made Sneakers and Purple Panties in 1981: a large still life on shaped canvas with simply a pair of sneakers and purple panties as the subject. The Margo Leavin Gallery of Los Angeles presented a solo exhibition.</p>
<p><strong>1983-1984</strong></p>
<p>New Work by Tom Wesselmann was shown at Sidney Janis Gallery, and works were displayed at the Sander Gallery in New York and at the Delahunty Gallery in <a href="Dallas,_Texas" title="wikilink">Dallas, Texas</a>. He made his first work in metal, <em>Steel Drawing #1</em>, which led to a series of works in steel and aluminum to which Wesselmann devoted all his energy in these years. The incorporation of negative space that had begun in the Drop-Out series was continued into a new medium and format. They started out as works in black and white, enabling him to redevelop the theme of the nude and its composition: <a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a>. At the same time he was also able to work on a variety of applications of drawing: <a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a>. In 1983 Wesselmann was seized by the idea of doing a drawing in steel, as if the lines on paper could be lifted off and placed on a wall. Once in place the drawings appeared to be drawn directly on the wall. This idea preceded the available technology for lasers to mechanically cut metal with the accuracy Wesselmann needed. He had to invest in the development of a system that could accomplish this, but it took another year for that to be ready. The impact of the first six steel drawings attached to the white wall was amazing, but Wesselmann took his idea further and decided to make them in color: he took <em>Steel Drawing #5</em> and painted it white. Then came color: <a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a>. As well as colored metal nudes, in 1984 he started working on new landscapes. These were rapid sketches that were then enlarged and made in aluminum. In 1984 curator <a href="Barbara_Haskell" title="wikilink">Barbara Haskell</a> included his work in <em>BLAM! The explosion of Pop, Minimalism &amp; Performance 1958-64</em> at the <a href="Whitney_Museum_of_American_Art" title="wikilink">Whitney Museum of American Art</a>.</p>
<p><strong>1985-1988</strong></p>
<p>The use of metals obliged Wesselmann to experiment with various techniques: those in aluminum were cut by hand, and those in steel were shaped by laser, though not without some difficulty. The most effective system, that of working the image on the computer, came a few years later with the development of that technology. Wesselmann researched and launched the first artistic use of laser-cut metal. Metal fabricators, who would not ordinarily be so inclined, were adapting the new technology to meet Wesselmann's requests and needs. Early in this period, however, an assistant was still cutting the steel by hand. He exhibited in <a href="D&lt;U+00FC&gt;sseldorf" class="uri" title="wikilink">D&lt;U+00FC&gt;sseldorf</a> with his solo show <em>Cut-Outs</em> at the Galerie Denise Ren&lt;U+00E9&gt; Hans Mayer. He then took part in the group exhibition entitled The 60s, organized by the Fondation Cartier in Paris. He was included in the Contemporary Cut-Outs exhibition at the Whitney Museum. His 1988 exhibition at Sidney Janis Gallery, <em>Tom Wesselmann, New Works</em>, was exclusively works on cut-out steel or aluminum The following year he exhibited at the 43rd Biennale in <a href="Venice" class="uri" title="wikilink">Venice</a>, and then with a one-man show at the Tokoro Gallery in <a href="Tokyo" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tokyo</a>. The Stein Bartlow Gallery in <a href="Chicago" class="uri" title="wikilink">Chicago</a> put on a traveling retrospective entitled <em>Tom Wesselmann Retrospective-Graphics &amp; Multiples</em>.</p>
<h2 id="s-2">1990s</h2>
<p><strong>1989-1992</strong> - Blum Helman Gallery in Santa Monica held a one-man show in 1989, as did Galerie Joachim Becker in Cannes. In 1990 Wesselmann exhibited cut-out landscapes at the Sidney Janis Gallery, and the Studio Trisorio in Naples showed Tom Wesselmann, Laser Nudes. These were followed by the solo Wesselmann: Graphics/Multiples Retrospective 1964-1990 at the Contemporary Art Center in Cincinnati; Tom Wesselmann Black and Gray, at the Edward Totah Gallery in London; Tom Wesselmann - Recent Still Lifes and Landscapes, at the Galerie Tokoro in Tokyo. His metal works continued to go through a constant metamorphosis: My Black Belt, 1990, a seventies subject, acquired a new vivacity that forcefully defined space in the new medium. The Drawing Society made a video directed by Paul Cummings in which Wesselmann makes a portrait of a model and a work in aluminum. He took part in the Figures of Contemporary Sculpture group exhibition at the Isetan Museum in Tokyo, and in the 20th Century Masters-Works on Paper, at the Sidney Janis Gallery, and in Azur at the Fondation Cartier in Jouy-en-Josas.</p>
<p><strong>1993-1998</strong></p>
<p>&lt;U+201C&gt;Since 1993 I&lt;U+2019&gt;ve basically been an abstract painter. This is what happened: in 1984 I started making steel and aluminum cut-out figures. First I painted them, and then hung transparent plastic panels on them and...got the colors and the positioning right (the image was very often fairly complex, and I only had a black-and-white ink drawing: it wasn&lt;U+2019&gt;t easy to pull out the colors from the complex web of white lines). After finishing the work, I cut the panels in pieces and cast them aside. One day I got muddled up with the remnants and I was struck by the infinite variety of abstract possibilities. That was when I understood I was going back to what I had desperately been aiming for in 1959, and I started making abstract three-dimensional images in cut metal. I was happy and free to go back to what I wanted: but this time not on De Kooning&lt;U+2019&gt;s terms but on mine&quot;. (interview with E. Giustacchini, Stile Arte, 2003, p. 29). The Sidney Janis Gallery put on a solo exhibit called New Metal Paintings and a new travelling retrospective (1959-1992) was presented at the Isetan Museum of Art in Shinjuku, Japan. A video was made by Mick Rock for this Japanese tour. Another important retrospective (1959-1993) organized by Thomas Buchsteiner and Otto Letze for the Institut fur Kulturaustausch T&lt;U+00FC&gt;bingen, Germany, traveled to Palais des Beaux- Arts, Brussels; Altes Museum, Berlin; Museum Villa Stuck, Munich; Kunsthal, Rotterdam, The Netherlands; Historisches Museum der Pfalz, Speyer, Germany; Foundation Cartier pour l'Art Contemporain, Paris; Fundacion Juan March, Madrid; Palais de la Virreina, Barcelona; Culturgest, Lisbon; Mus&lt;U+00E9&gt;e de l'Art Moderne, Nice, France. Wesselmann was then passionately devoted to two subjects; the new Abstract format, and his long standing interest in the female nudes. For the abstracts he preferred an uncontrolled, almost random approach, making compositions in which the metal cut-outs shapes were more akin to painted gestural brushstrokes, as in Breakout, 1996, Round Two, 1997, and Pink Pearl, 1998. His nudes, on the other hand, reveal echoes of the past, as can be seen in the small series made in 1997 which comes back to life in the rectangular outlines of a canvas and in the change of technique to oil painting. These are reworkings of 1960s images: 1962 Plus 35 Nude Sketch I, II, III; 32-Year-old on the Beach, and, from the late 1970s, Face with Goldfish. These canvases: &lt;U+201C&gt;...constitute an unexpected but highly satisfying nostalgic return to a youthful episode in the very midst of one of the most radical changes of style in Wesselmann&lt;U+2019&gt;s career. Self-contained and complete in themselves, they seem more likely to stand alone rather than to lead to further reinterpretations of Sixties motifs. In other words they should not be taken as a sign that Wesselmann is embarking on an extended re-engagement with his classic Pop phase, in the way that Warhol and Lichtenstein did towards the end of their lives in their Reversals and Reflections series respectively&lt;U+201D&gt; (M. Livingstone, 1999, p. 6). Alongside them there are works made of aluminum, with brilliant colors and an accentuated thickness of lines and flat backgrounds that anticipate the final outcome of his Sunset Nudes. 1996 brought numerous solo exhibitions: Paper Maquettes at Sidney Janis Gallery, a retrospective (1959-1995) at Fred Hoffman&lt;U+2019&gt;s in Santa Monica, in Singapore at the Wetterling Teo Gallery and at Maxwell Davidson Gallery in New York. The following year, 1998, he was at Hans Mayer&lt;U+2019&gt;s in D&lt;U+00FC&gt;sseldorf, and at Benden &amp; Klimczak in Viersen, Germany.</p>

<p><strong>1999-2000</strong> - In 1999 he made his final Smoker work with <em>Smoker #1 (3-D)</em>,as a relief in aluminum, taking up the subject of smoke again, but this time in three dimensions. In the same year there were several solo exhibitions including: <em>Small Survey: Small Scale</em> at the Maxwell Davidson Gallery, and Gallery Camino Real in <a href="Boca_Raton,_Florida" title="wikilink">Boca Raton, Florida</a>. The ambiguity between line and color, between drawing and painting, continued in his oils: <em>Blue Nude Drawing</em>; <em>Claire 3/21/97</em> (both dated 1999); <em>Blue Nude (2000)</em>, a painting that led on to a series of blue nudes made in shaped aluminum that went on exhibition in December 2000 at the Joseph Helman Gallery. These played on the alternation of positive shapes (in blue) and negative (in white) and were closely inspired by the cut-out figures made by <a href="Matisse" class="uri" title="wikilink">Matisse</a> in his later years, floating on the walls with elegance and sensuality. He had two shows with Benden &amp; Klimczak; Paintings and Metal Works in Viersen and Abstract Maquettes, in <a href="Cologne" class="uri" title="wikilink">Cologne</a> in 2000.</p>
<h3 id="final-years">Final years</h3>
<p>The abstract works in these years underwent a further change with a return to compositions, with firmer lines and a chromatic range that favored primary colors, making clear reference to <a href="Mondrian" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mondrian</a>: <em>Manhattan Beauty</em>; and <em>New York City Beauty</em> (both 2001). Works were shown at the <em>Pop Impact!</em> group exhibition, at the Whitney Museum, and at the Les Ann&lt;U+00E9&gt;es Pop exhibition at the <a href="Centre_Pompidou" title="wikilink">Centre Pompidou</a>, <a href="Paris" class="uri" title="wikilink">Paris</a>. He started working on the <em>Sunset Nude series</em>, in which he went back to a pictorial classicism that shows the influence of Matisse&lt;U+2019&gt;s nudes. Though he had loved Matisse during his early years of training, he had to move away from his influence in order to render with greater self-assurance the complex compositions of nudes and interiors that struck him most: &lt;U+201C&gt;Matisse was just so incredibly good&lt;U+2026&gt; He was the painter I most idolized&lt;U+201D&gt; <a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a>. He was able to take a first-hand look at the works of the French master in the <em>Gouaches D&lt;U+00E9&gt;coup&lt;U+00E9&gt;es</em> exhibition at MoMA in 1960, and forty years later paid homage in his Sunset Nudes, in <em>Sunset Nude with Matisse</em>, 2002, in which he inserted the painting <em>La Blouse Romaine</em>, 1939-1940. In <em>Sunset Nude with Pin<small>Small Text</small>k and Yellow Tulips,</em> in <em>Sunset Nude #3,</em> which is dominated by the juxtaposition of swathes of flat color, the absence of chiaroscuro and an intricate play of lines makes it possible to see continuous cross-references of positive and negative shapes. It is the mixture between background and figure, the simplification and concision of the details, and the linear compositional skill that Wesselmann takes from the works of Matisse. He painted <em>Sunset Nude with Matisse,</em> and <em>Apples on Pink Table Cloth</em> in 2003. His last major paintings of the series Sunset Nudes (2003/2004) were shown after his death at the Robert Miller Gallery in New York in April 2006. <a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> Wesselmann also held important solo exhibitions at the <a href="University_of_California" title="wikilink">University of California</a>, Long Beach, and at Galleria Flora Bigai in <a href="Venice" class="uri" title="wikilink">Venice</a>: here, the catalog included an essay signed by Stealingworth.</p>
<p>The following year he made the abstract Five Stop in aluminum, and exhibited a series of Sunset Nudes at Bernard Jacobson Gallery in <a href="London" class="uri" title="wikilink">London</a>. These nudes are set against exotic backgrounds, lit up by sanguine sunsets, enveloped by tropical vegetation in <em>Sunset Nude with Palm Trees</em> or <em>Sunset Nude with Big Palm Trees</em>, 2004. The female icon of the new millennium is painted but not described, the compositional planes overlap, and the borderline between the two most significant areas of his work, figurative work and abstraction, is diminished. In the last ten years Wesselmann's health was showing the consequences of heart disease, but his studio work remained constant. He made <em>Bedroom Breast</em>, 2004, a painted metal relief, referring back to his earlier work, and two Sunset Nudes: <em>Sunset Nude with Frame</em>, a painted metal work, and <em>Man Ray at the Dance</em>, a large canvas painting, at more than eight by six feet. Following surgery for his heart condition, Tom Wesselmann died on <a href="December_17" title="wikilink">December 17</a>, <a href="2004" class="uri" title="wikilink">2004</a>.</p>
