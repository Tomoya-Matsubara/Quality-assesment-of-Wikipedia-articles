<p>The <strong>Boydell Shakespeare Gallery</strong> was a three-part project initiated in November 1786 by <a href="engraver" class="uri" title="wikilink">engraver</a> and publisher <a href="John_Boydell" title="wikilink">John Boydell</a> in an effort to foster a <a href="School_(discipline)" title="wikilink">school</a> of British <a href="history_painting" title="wikilink">history painting</a>. Boydell planned to focus on an illustrated edition of <a href="William_Shakespeare" title="wikilink">William Shakespeare's</a> plays and a folio of prints, but during the 1790s the <a href="London" class="uri" title="wikilink">London</a> gallery that showed the original paintings emerged as the project's most popular element.</p>
<p>Shakespeare enjoyed a renewed popularity in <a href="18th-century" class="uri" title="wikilink">18th-century</a> Britain: several new editions of his works were published; his plays were revived in the theatre; and numerous works of art were created illustrating Shakespeare productions and the plays themselves. Capitalising on this interest, Boydell decided to publish a grand illustrated edition of Shakespeare's plays that would showcase the talents of British painters and engravers. He chose the noted scholar and Shakespeare editor <a href="George_Steevens" title="wikilink">George Steevens</a> to oversee the edition, which was released between 1791 and 1803.</p>
<p>The press reported weekly on the building of Boydell's gallery, designed by <a href="George_Dance_the_Younger" title="wikilink">George Dance the Younger</a>, on a site in <a href="Pall_Mall,_London" title="wikilink">Pall Mall</a>. Boydell commissioned works from famous painters of the day, such as <a href="Joshua_Reynolds" title="wikilink">Joshua Reynolds</a>, and the folio of engravings proved the enterprise's most lasting legacy. However, the long delay in publishing the prints and the illustrated edition prompted criticism. Because they were hurried, and many illustrations had to be done by lesser artists, the final products of Boydell's venture were judged to be disappointing. The project caused the Boydell firm to become insolvent, and they were forced to sell the gallery at a lottery.</p>

Shakespeare's plays were integral to the theatre's resurgence at this time. Despite the upsurge in theatre-going, writing tragedies was not profitable, and thus few good tragedies were written.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> Shakespeare's works filled the gap in the repertoire, and his reputation grew as a result. By the end of the 18th century, one out of every six plays performed in London was by Shakespeare.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>The actor, director, and producer <a href="David_Garrick" title="wikilink">David Garrick</a> was a key figure in Shakespeare's theatrical renaissance.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> His reportedly superb acting, unrivalled productions, numerous and important Shakespearean portraits, and his spectacular 1769 <a href="Shakespeare_Jubilee" title="wikilink">Shakespeare Jubilee</a> helped promote Shakespeare as a marketable product and the national playwright. Garrick's <a href="Theatre_Royal,_Drury_Lane" title="wikilink">Drury Lane theatre</a> was the centre of the Shakespeare mania which swept the nation.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p>The visual arts also played a significant role in expanding Shakespeare's popular appeal. In particular, the <a href="conversation_piece" title="wikilink">conversation pieces</a> designed chiefly for homes generated a wide audience for literary art, especially Shakespearean art.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> This tradition began with <a href="William_Hogarth" title="wikilink">William Hogarth</a> (whose prints reached all levels of society) and attained its peak in the <a href="Royal_Academy" title="wikilink">Royal Academy</a> exhibitions, which displayed paintings, drawings, and sculptures. The exhibitions became important public events: thousands flocked to see them, and newspapers reported in detail on the works displayed. They became a fashionable place to be seen (as did Boydell's Shakespeare Gallery, later in the century). In the process, the public was refamiliarized with Shakespeare's works.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="shakespeare-editions">Shakespeare editions</h3>
<p><img src="George_Steevens.JPG" title="fig:George Steevens, one of the greatest Shakespeare scholars of the 18th century and the editor of the Boydell Shakespeare edition" alt="George Steevens, one of the greatest Shakespeare scholars of the 18th century and the editor of the Boydell Shakespeare edition" /> The rise in Shakespeare's popularity coincided with Britain's accelerating change from an <a href="oral_tradition" title="wikilink">oral</a> to a <a href="print_culture" title="wikilink">print culture</a>. Towards the end of the century, the basis of Shakespeare's high reputation changed. He had originally been respected as a playwright, but once the theatre became association with the masses, Shakespeare's status as a &quot;great writer&quot; shifted. Two strands of Shakespearean print culture emerged: <a href="bourgeois" class="uri" title="wikilink">bourgeois</a> popular editions and scholarly critical editions.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<p>In order to turn a profit, booksellers chose well-known authors, such as <a href="Alexander_Pope" title="wikilink">Alexander Pope</a> and <a href="Samuel_Johnson" title="wikilink">Samuel Johnson</a>, to edit Shakespeare editions. According to Shakespeare scholar <a href="Gary_Taylor_(English_literature_scholar)" title="wikilink">Gary Taylor</a>, Shakespearean criticism became so &quot;associated with the dramatis personae of 18th-century English literature ... [that] he could not be extracted without uprooting a century and a half of the national canon&quot;.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> The 18th century's first Shakespeare edition, which was also the first illustrated edition of the plays, was published in 1709 by <a href="Jacob_Tonson" title="wikilink">Jacob Tonson</a> and edited by <a href="Nicholas_Rowe_(dramatist)" title="wikilink">Nicholas Rowe</a>.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> The plays appeared in &quot;pleasant and readable books in small format&quot; which &quot;were supposed ... to have been taken for common or garden use, domestic rather than library sets&quot;.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> Shakespeare became &quot;domesticated&quot; in the 18th century, particularly with the publication of family editions such as Bell's in 1773 and 1785â€“86, which advertised themselves as &quot;more instructive and intelligible; especially to the young ladies and to youth; glaring indecencies being removed&quot;.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<p>Scholarly editions also proliferated. At first, these were edited by author-scholars such as Pope (1725) and Johnson (1765), but later in the century this changed. Editors such as <a href="George_Steevens" title="wikilink">George Steevens</a> (1773, 1785) and <a href="Edmund_Malone" title="wikilink">Edmund Malone</a> (1790) produced meticulous editions with extensive footnotes. The early editions appealed to both the middle class and to those interested in Shakespeare scholarship, but the later editions appealed almost exclusively to the latter. Boydell's edition, at the end of the century, tried to reunite these two strands. It included illustrations but was edited by George Steevens, one of the foremost Shakespeare scholars of the day.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>

</figure>
<p>Boydell's Shakespeare project contained three parts: an illustrated edition of Shakespeare's plays; a folio of prints from the gallery (originally intended to be a folio of prints from the edition of Shakespeare's plays); and a public gallery where the original paintings for the prints would hang.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
<p>The idea of a grand Shakespeare edition was conceived during a dinner at the home of <a href="Josiah_Boydell" title="wikilink">Josiah Boydell</a> (John's nephew) in late 1786.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> Five important accounts of the occasion survive.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> From these, a guest list and a reconstruction of the conversation have been assembled. The guest list reflects the range of Boydell's contacts in the artistic world: it included <a href="Benjamin_West" title="wikilink">Benjamin West</a>, painter to <a href="George_III" title="wikilink">King George III</a>; <a href="George_Romney_(painter)" title="wikilink">George Romney</a>, a renowned portrait painter; <a href="George_Nicol_(bookseller)" title="wikilink">George Nicol</a>, bookseller to the king; <a href="William_Hayley" title="wikilink">William Hayley</a>, a poet; <a href="John_Hoole" title="wikilink">John Hoole</a>, a scholar and translator of <a href="Tasso" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tasso</a> and <a href="Aristotle" class="uri" title="wikilink">Aristotle</a>; and Daniel Braithwaite, secretary to the postmaster general and a patron of artists such as Romney and <a href="Angelica_Kauffmann" title="wikilink">Angelica Kauffmann</a>. Most accounts also place the painter <a href="Paul_Sandby" title="wikilink">Paul Sandby</a> at the gathering.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>
<p>Boydell wanted to use the edition to help stimulate a British <a href="School_(discipline)" title="wikilink">school</a> of <a href="history_painting" title="wikilink">history painting</a>. He wrote in the &quot;Preface&quot; to the folio that he wanted &quot;to advance that art towards maturity, and establish an English School of Historical Painting&quot;.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> A court document used by Josiah to collect debts from customers after Boydell's death relates the story of the dinner and Boydell's motivations:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[Boydell said] he should like to wipe away the stigma that all foreign critics threw on this nation&lt;U+2014&gt;that they had no genius for historical painting. He said he was certain from his success in encouraging engraving that Englishmen wanted nothing but proper encouragement and a proper subject to excel in historical painting. The encouragement he would endeavor to find if a proper subject were pointed out. Mr. Nicol replied that there was one great National subject concerning which there could be no second opinion, and mentioned Shakespeare. The proposition was received with acclaim by the <a href="Alderman" class="uri" title="wikilink">Alderman</a> [John Boydell] and the whole company.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, as Frederick Burwick argues in his introduction to a collection of essays on the Boydell Gallery, &quot;[w]hatever claims Boydell might make about furthering the cause of history painting in England, the actual rallying force that brought the artists together to create the Shakespeare Gallery was the promise of engraved publication and distribution of their works.&quot;<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a></p>
<p>After the initial success of the Shakespeare Gallery, many wanted to take credit. <a href="Henry_Fuseli" title="wikilink">Henry Fuseli</a> long claimed that his planned Shakespeare ceiling (in imitation of the <a href="Sistine_Chapel_ceiling" title="wikilink">Sistine Chapel ceiling</a>) had given Boydell the idea for the gallery.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> <a href="James_Northcote" title="wikilink">James Northcote</a> claimed that his <em>Death of Wat Tyler</em> and <em>Murder of the Princes in the Tower</em> had motivated Boydell to start the project.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> However, according to Winifred Friedman, who has researched the Boydell Gallery, it was probably <a href="Joshua_Reynolds" title="wikilink">Joshua Reynolds's</a> <a href="Royal_Academy" title="wikilink">Royal Academy</a> lectures on the superiority of history painting that influenced Boydell the most.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a></p>
<p>The logistics of the enterprise were difficult to organise. Boydell and Nicol wanted to produce an illustrated edition of a multi-volume work and intended to bind and sell the 72 large prints separately in a folio. A gallery was required to exhibit the paintings from which the prints were drawn. The edition was to be financed through a subscription campaign, during which the buyers would pay part of the price up front and the remainder on delivery. This unusual practice was necessitated by the fact that over <a href="Pound_sterling" title="wikilink">&lt;U+00A3&gt;</a>350,000â€”an enormous sum at the timeâ€”was eventually spent.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> The gallery opened in 1789 with 34 paintings and added 33 more in 1790 when the first engravings were published. The last volume of the edition and the <em>Collection of Prints</em> were published in 1803. In the middle of the project, Boydell decided that he could make more money if he published different prints in the folio than in the illustrated edition; as a result, the two sets of images are not identical.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a></p>
<p>Advertisements were issued and placed in newspapers. When a subscription was circulated for a medal to be struck, the copy read: &quot;The encouragers of this great national undertaking will also have the satisfaction to know, that their names will be handed down to Posterity, as the Patrons of Native Genius, enrolled with their own hands, in the same book, with the best of Sovereigns.&quot;<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> The language of both the advertisement and the medal emphasised the role each subscriber played in the patronage of the arts. The subscribers were primarily middle-class Londoners, not aristocrats. <a href="Edmund_Malone" title="wikilink">Edmund Malone</a>, himself an editor of a rival Shakespeare edition, wrote that &quot;before the scheme was well-formed, or the proposals entirely printed off, near six hundred persons eagerly set down their names, and paid their subscriptions to a set of books and prints that will cost each person, I think, about ninety guineas; and on looking over the list, there were not above twenty names among them that anybody knew&quot;.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="illustrated-shakespeare-edition-and-folio">Illustrated Shakespeare edition and folio</h2>

<p><img src="Westall-Ophelia.jpg" title="fig:Richard Westall&#39;s Ophelia, engraved by J.

Parker for Boydell&#39;s illustrated edition of Shakespeare&#39;s Dramatic Works" width="180" /> The &quot;magnificent and accurate&quot; Shakespeare edition which Boydell began in 1786 was to be the focus of his enterpriseâ€”he viewed the print folio and the gallery as offshoots of the main project.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> In an advertisement prefacing the first volume of the edition, Nicol wrote that &quot;splendor and magnificence, united with correctness of text were the great objects of this Edition&quot;.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> The volumes themselves were handsome, with <a href="gild" title="wikilink">gilded</a> pages that, unlike those in previous scholarly editions, were unencumbered by footnotes. Each play had its own title page followed by a list of &quot;Persons in the Drama&quot;. Boydell spared no expense. He hired the <a href="typography" class="uri" title="wikilink">typography</a> experts William Bulmer and William Martin to develop and cut a new typeface specifically for the edition. Nicol explains in the preface that they &quot;established a printing-house ... [and] a foundry to cast the types; and even a manufactory to make the ink&quot;.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> Boydell also chose to use high-quality wove <a href="Whatman_paper" title="wikilink">Whatman paper</a>.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> The illustrations were printed independently and could be inserted and removed as the purchaser desired. The first volumes of the <em>Dramatic Works</em> were published in 1791 and the last in 1805.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a></p>
<p>Boydell was responsible for the &quot;splendor&quot;, and <a href="George_Steevens" title="wikilink">George Steevens</a>, the general editor, was responsible for the &quot;correctness of text&quot;. Steevens, according to Evelyn Wenner, who has studied the history of the Boydell edition, was &quot;at first an ardent advocate of the plan&quot; but &quot;soon realized that the editor of this text must in the very scheme of things give way to painters, publishers and engravers&quot;.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> He was also ultimately disappointed in the quality of the prints, but he said nothing to jeopardize the edition's sales.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> Steevens, who had already edited two complete Shakespeare editions, was not asked to edit the text anew; instead, he picked which version of the text to reprint. Wenner describes the resulting hybrid edition:  Throughout the edition, modern (i.e. 18th-century) spelling was preferred as were <a href="First_Folio" title="wikilink">First Folio</a> readings.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a></p>
<p>Boydell sought out the most eminent painters and engravers of the day to contribute paintings for the gallery, engravings for the folio, and illustrations for the edition. Artists included <a href="Richard_Westall" title="wikilink">Richard Westall</a>, <a href="Thomas_Stothard" title="wikilink">Thomas Stothard</a>, <a href="George_Romney_(painter)" title="wikilink">George Romney</a>, <a href="Henry_Fuseli" title="wikilink">Henry Fuseli</a>, <a href="Benjamin_West" title="wikilink">Benjamin West</a>, <a href="Angelica_Kauffmann" title="wikilink">Angelica Kauffmann</a>, <a href="Robert_Smirke_(painter)" title="wikilink">Robert Smirke</a>, <a href="John_Opie" title="wikilink">John Opie</a>, <a href="Francesco_Bartolozzi" title="wikilink">Francesco Bartolozzi</a>, <a href="Thomas_Kirk_(artist)" title="wikilink">Thomas Kirk</a>, and Boydell's nephew and business partner, <a href="Josiah_Boydell" title="wikilink">Josiah Boydell</a>.</p>
<p>The folio and the illustrated Shakespeare edition were &quot;by far the largest single engraving enterprise ever undertaken in England&quot;.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> As print collector and dealer Christopher Lennox-Boyd explains, &quot;had there not been a market for such engravings, not one of the paintings would have been commissioned, and few, if any, of the artists would have risked painting such elaborate compositions&quot;.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> Scholars believe that a variety of engraving methods were employed and that <a href="line_engraving" title="wikilink">line engraving</a> was the &quot;preferred medium&quot; because it was &quot;clear and hardwearing&quot; and because it had a high reputation. <a href="Stipple" class="uri" title="wikilink">Stipple</a> engraving, which was quicker and often used to produce shading effects, wore out quicker and was valued less.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> Many plates were a mixture of both.

<p><img src="A_Scene_from_Troilus_and_Cressida_-_Angelica_Kauffmann.jpg" title="fig:Angelica Kauffmann described her scene from Troilus and Cressida, engraved by Luigi Schiavonetti for the folio: Troilus &quot;sees his wife in loving discourse with Diomedes and he wants to rush into the tent to catch them by surprise, but Ulysses and the other keep him back by force&quot;." alt="Angelica Kauffmann described her scene from Troilus and Cressida, engraved by Luigi Schiavonetti for the folio: Troilus &quot;sees his wife in loving discourse with Diomedes and he wants to rush into the tent to catch them by surprise, but Ulysses and the other keep him back by force&quot;." width="250" /> Boydell's relationships with his illustrators were generally congenial. One of them, <a href="James_Northcote" title="wikilink">James Northcote</a>, praised Boydell's liberal payments. He wrote in an 1821 letter that Boydell &quot;did more for the advancement of the arts in England than the whole mass of the nobility put together! He paid me more nobly than any other person has done; and his memory I shall ever hold in reverence&quot;.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a> Boydell typically paid the painters between &lt;U+00A3&gt;105 to &lt;U+00A3&gt;210, and the engravers between &lt;U+00A3&gt;262 and &lt;U+00A3&gt;315.<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> <a href="Joshua_Reynolds" title="wikilink">Joshua Reynolds</a> at first declined Boydell's offer to work on the project, but he agreed when pressed. Boydell offered Reynolds <em>carte blanche</em> for his paintings, giving him a down payment of &lt;U+00A3&gt;500, an extraordinary amount for an artist who had not even agreed to do a specific work. Boydell eventually paid him a total of &lt;U+00A3&gt;1,500.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a></p>
<p>There are 96 illustrations in the nine volumes of the illustrated edition and each play has at least one. Approximately two-thirds of the plays, 23 out of 36, are each illustrated by a single artist. Approximately two-thirds of the total number of illustrations, or 65, were completed by three artists: <a href="William_Hamilton_(painter)" title="wikilink">William Hamilton</a>, <a href="Richard_Westall" title="wikilink">Richard Westall</a>, and <a href="Robert_Smirke_(painter)" title="wikilink">Robert Smirke</a>. The primary illustrators of the edition were known as book illustrators, whereas a majority of the artists included in the folio were known for their paintings.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a> Lennox-Boyd argues that the illustrations in the edition have a &quot;uniformity and cohesiveness&quot; that the folio lacks because the artists and engravers working on them understood book illustration while those working on the folio were working in an unfamiliar medium.<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a></p>
<p>The print folio, <em>A Collection of Prints, From Pictures Painted for the Purpose of Illustrating the Dramatic Works of Shakspeare, by the Artists of Great-Britain</em> (1805), was originally intended to be a collection of the illustrations from the edition, but a few years into the project, Boydell altered his plan. He guessed that he could sell more folios and editions if the pictures were different. Of the 97 prints made from paintings, two-thirds of them were made by ten of the artists. Three artists account for one-third of the paintings. In all, 31 artists contributed works.<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a></p>

<p>In June 1788, Boydell and his nephew secured the lease on a site at 52 <a href="Pall_Mall,_London" title="wikilink">Pall Mall</a> to build the gallery and engaged <a href="George_Dance_the_Younger" title="wikilink">George Dance</a>, then the Clerk of the City Works, as the architect for the project.<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a> Pall Mall at that time had a mix of expensive residences and commercial operations, such as bookshops and gentleman's clubs, popular with fashionable London society. The area also contained some less genteel establishments: King's Place (now Pall Mall Place), an alley running to the east and behind Boydell's gallery, was the site of Charlotte Hayes's high-class <a href="brothel" class="uri" title="wikilink">brothel</a>.<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a> Across King's Place, immediately to the east of Boydell's building, 51 Pall Mall had been purchased on <a href="26_February" title="wikilink">26 February</a> <a href="1787" class="uri" title="wikilink">1787</a> by <a href="George_Nicol_(bookseller)" title="wikilink">George Nicol</a>, bookseller and future husband of Josiah's elder sister, Mary Boydell.

Begun as a gambling establishment for wealthy young men, it had later become a reformist political club that counted <a href="William_Pitt_the_Younger" title="wikilink">William Pitt</a> and <a href="William_Wilberforce" title="wikilink">William Wilberforce</a> as members.<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a></p>

Three interconnecting exhibition rooms occupied the upper floor, with a total of more than  of wall space for displaying pictures. The two-storey fa&lt;U+00E7&gt;ade was not especially large for the street, but its solid classicism had an imposing effect.<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a> Some reports describe the exterior as &quot;sheathed in copper&quot;.<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a></p>
<p>The lower storey of the fa&lt;U+00E7&gt;ade was dominated by a large, rounded-arched doorway in the centre. The <a href="Molding_(decorative)" title="wikilink">unmoulded</a> arch rested on wide piers, each broken by a narrow window, above which ran a simple <a href="cornice" class="uri" title="wikilink">cornice</a>. Dance placed a <a href="Transom_(architectural)" title="wikilink">transom</a> across the doorway at the level of the cornice bearing the inscription &quot;Shakespeare Gallery&quot;. Below the transom were the main entry doors, with glazed panels and side lights matching the flanking windows. A radial <a href="fanlight" class="uri" title="wikilink">fanlight</a> filled the <a href="lunette" class="uri" title="wikilink">lunette</a> above the transom. In each of the <a href="spandrels" class="uri" title="wikilink">spandrels</a> to the left and right of the arch, Dance set a carving of a lyre inside a ribboned wreath. Above all this ran a panelled <a href="band_course" title="wikilink">band course</a> dividing the lower storey from the upper.<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a></p>
<p>The upper fa&lt;U+00E7&gt;ade contained paired <a href="pilaster" title="wikilink">pilasters</a> on either side, and a thick <a href="entablature" class="uri" title="wikilink">entablature</a> and triangular <a href="pediment" class="uri" title="wikilink">pediment</a>. The architect <a href="Sir_John_Soane" title="wikilink">Sir John Soane</a> criticised Dance's combination of slender pilasters and a heavy entablature as a &quot;strange and extravagant absurdity&quot;.<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a> The capitals topping the pilasters sported <a href="volute" title="wikilink">volutes</a> in the shape of <a href="ammonite" class="uri" title="wikilink">ammonite</a> fossils. Dance invented this neo-classical feature specifically for the gallery that became known as the <a href="Ammonite_Order" title="wikilink">Ammonite Order</a>. In a recess between the pilasters, Dance placed <a href="Thomas_Banks" title="wikilink">Thomas Banks's</a> sculpture <em>Shakespeare attended by Painting and Poetry</em>, for which the artist was paid 500 <a href="guineas" class="uri" title="wikilink">guineas</a>. The sculpture depicted Shakespeare, reclining against a rock, between the Dramatic Muse and the Genius of Painting. Beneath it was a panelled pedestal inscribed with a quotation from <em>Hamlet</em>: &quot;He was a Man, take him for all in all, I shall not look upon his like again&quot;.<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a><a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a></p>

<p>The Shakespeare Gallery, when it opened on <a href="4_May" title="wikilink">4 May</a> <a href="1789" class="uri" title="wikilink">1789</a>, contained 34 paintings, and by the end of its run it had between 167 and 170.<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a> (The exact inventory is uncertain and most of the paintings have disappeared; only around 40 paintings can be identified with any certainty.<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a>) According to Frederick Burwick, during its sixteen-year operation, the Gallery reflected the transition from <a href="Neoclassicism" class="uri" title="wikilink">Neoclassicism</a> to <a href="Romanticism" class="uri" title="wikilink">Romanticism</a>.<a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a> Works by artists such as <a href="James_Northcote" title="wikilink">James Northcote</a> represent the conservative, neoclassical elements of the gallery, while those of <a href="Henry_Fuseli" title="wikilink">Henry Fuseli</a> represent the newly emerging Romantic movement. <a href="William_Hazlitt" title="wikilink">William Hazlitt</a> praised Northcote in an essay entitled &quot;On the Old Age of Artists&quot;, writing &quot;I conceive any person would be more struck with Mr. Fuseli at first sight, but would wish to visit Mr. Northcote oftener.&quot;<a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a></p>
<p>The gallery itself was a fashionable hit with the public. Newspapers carried updates of the construction of the gallery, down to drawings for the proposed fa&lt;U+00E7&gt;ade.<a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a> The <em>Daily Advertiser</em> featured a weekly column on the gallery from May through August (exhibition season). Artists who had influence with the press, and Boydell himself, published anonymous articles to heighten interest in the gallery, which they hoped would increase sales of the edition.<a href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a></p>
<p>At the beginning of the enterprise, reactions were generally positive.<a href="#fn67" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a> The <em><a href="Public_Advertiser" title="wikilink">Public Advertiser</a></em> wrote on <a href="6_May" title="wikilink">6 May</a> <a href="1789" class="uri" title="wikilink">1789</a>: &quot;the pictures in general give a mirror of the poet ...

<blockquote>
<p>West said He looked over the Shakespeare prints and was sorry to see them of such inferior quality. He said that excepting that from His Lear by Sharpe, that from Northcote's children in the Tower, and some small ones, there were few that could be approved. Such a mixture of dotting and engraving, and such a general deficiency in respect of drawing which He observed the Engravers seemed to know little of, that the volumes presented a mass of works which He did not wonder many subscribers had declined to continue their subscription.<a href="#fn75" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref75"><sup>75</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The mix of engraving styles was criticised; line engraving was considered the superior form and artists and subscribers disliked the mixture of lesser forms with it.<a href="#fn76" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref76"><sup>76</sup></a> Moreover, Boydell's engravers fell behind schedule, delaying the entire project.<a href="#fn77" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref77"><sup>77</sup></a> He was forced to engage lesser artists, such as Hamilton and Smirke, at a lower price to finish the volumes as his business started to fail.<a href="#fn78" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref78"><sup>78</sup></a> Modern art historians have generally concurred that the quality of the engravings, particularly in the folio, was poor. Moreover, the use of so many different artists and engravers led to a lack of stylistic cohesion.<a href="#fn79" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref79"><sup>79</sup></a></p>
<p>Although the Boydells ended with 1,384 subscriptions,<a href="#fn80" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref80"><sup>80</sup></a> the rate of subscriptions dropped, and remaining subscriptions were also increasingly in doubt. Like many businesses at the time, the Boydell firm kept few records. Only the customers knew what they had purchased.<a href="#fn81" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref81"><sup>81</sup></a> This caused numerous difficulties with debtors who claimed they had never subscribed or had subscribed for less. Many subscribers also defaulted, and Josiah Boydell spent years after John's death attempting to force them to pay.</p>
<p>The Boydells focused all their attention on the Shakespeare edition and other large projects, such as <em>The History of the River Thames</em> and <em>The Complete Works of John Milton</em>, rather than on lesser, more profitable ventures.<a href="#fn82" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref82"><sup>82</sup></a> When both the Shakespeare enterprise and the Thames book failed, the firm had no capital to fall back upon. Beginning in 1789, with the onset of the <a href="French_revolution" title="wikilink">French revolution</a>, John Boydell's export business to Europe was cut off. By the late 1790s and early 1800s, the two-thirds of his business which depended upon the export trade was in serious financial difficulty.<a href="#fn83" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref83"><sup>83</sup></a><a href="#fn84" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref84"><sup>84</sup></a></p>
<p>John Boydell decided to appeal to Parliament for a <a href="private_bill" title="wikilink">private bill</a> to authorise a lottery to dispose of everything in his business. He died before the lottery was held but lived long enough to see each of the 22,000 tickets purchased at three <a href="guinea" title="wikilink">guineas</a> apiece. The lottery was drawn on <a href="28_January" title="wikilink">28 January</a> <a href="1805" class="uri" title="wikilink">1805</a>: there were 64 winning tickets, the highest prize being the Gallery itself and its collection of paintings. This went to <a href="William_Tassie" title="wikilink">William Tassie</a>, a gem engraver and modeller, of Leicester Fields (now <a href="Leicester_Square" title="wikilink">Leicester Square</a>). Josiah offered to buy the gallery and its paintings back from Tassie for &lt;U+00A3&gt;10,000, but Tassie refused and auctioned the paintings at <a href="Christie&#39;s" class="uri" title="wikilink">Christie's</a>.<a href="#fn85" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref85"><sup>85</sup></a> The painting collection and two reliefs by <a href="Anne_Seymour_Damer" title="wikilink">Anne Damer</a> fetched a total of &lt;U+00A3&gt;6,181 18s. 6d. The Banks sculpture group from the fa&lt;U+00E7&gt;ade was initially intended to be kept as a monument for Boydell's tomb. Instead, it remained part of the fa&lt;U+00E7&gt;ade of the building in its new guise as the <a href="British_Institution" title="wikilink">British Institution</a> until the building was torn down in 1868&lt;U+2013&gt;69.

In April 1788, after the announcement of the Shakespeare Gallery, but a year before its opening, <a href="Thomas_Macklin" title="wikilink">Thomas Macklin</a> opened a Gallery of the Poets in the former <a href="Royal_Academy" title="wikilink">Royal Academy</a> building on the south side of Pall Mall. The first exhibition featured one work from each of 19 artists, including Fuseli, Reynolds, and <a href="Thomas_Gainsborough" title="wikilink">Thomas Gainsborough</a>. The gallery added new paintings of subjects from poetry each year, and from 1790 supplemented these with scenes from the Bible. The Gallery of the Poets closed in 1797, and its contents were offered by lottery.<a href="#fn87" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref87"><sup>87</sup></a> This did not deter <a href="Henry_Fuseli" title="wikilink">Henry Fuseli</a> from opening a <a href="John_Milton" title="wikilink">Milton</a> Gallery in the same building in 1799. Another such venture was the Historic Gallery opened by <a href="Robert_Bowyer" title="wikilink">Robert Bowyer</a> in Schomberg House at 87 Pall Mall in about 1793. The gallery accumulated 60 paintings (many by the same artists who worked for Boydell) commissioned to illustrate a new edition of <a href="David_Hume" title="wikilink">David Hume's</a> <em><a href="The_History_of_Great_Britain" title="wikilink">The History of Great Britain</a></em>.<a href="#fn88" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref88"><sup>88</sup></a> Ultimately, Bowyer had to seek parliamentary approval for a sale by lottery in 1805, and the other ventures, like Boydell's, also ended in financial failure.<a href="#fn89" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref89"><sup>89</sup></a><ref name="Bruntjen 118<U+2013>21&quot;/&gt;</p>
<p>The paintings and engravings that were part of the Boydell Gallery affected the way Shakespeare's plays were staged, acted, and illustrated in the 19th century. They also became the subject of criticism in important works such as <a href="Romantic_poetry" title="wikilink">Romantic poet</a> and essayist <a href="Samuel_Taylor_Coleridge" title="wikilink">Samuel Taylor Coleridge's</a> &quot;Lectures on Shakespeare&quot; and <a href="William_Hazlitt" title="wikilink">William Hazlitt's</a> dramatic criticism. Despite <a href="Charles_Lamb" title="wikilink">Charles Lamb's</a> criticism of the Gallery's productions, <a href="Charles_Lamb" title="wikilink">Charles</a> and <a href="Mary_Lamb" title="wikilink">Mary Lamb's</a> children's book, <em><a href="Tales_from_Shakespeare" title="wikilink">Tales from Shakespeare</a></em> (1807), was illustrated using plates from the project.<a href="#fn90" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref90"><sup>90</sup></a></p>
<p>The Boydell enterprise's most enduring legacy was the folio. It was reissued throughout the 19th century, and in 1867, &quot;by the aid of photography the whole series, excepting the portraits of their Majesties George III. and Queen Charlotte, is now presented in a handy form, suitable for ordinary libraries or the drawing-room table, and offered as an appropriate memorial of the tercentenary celebration of the poet's birth&quot;.<a href="#fn91" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref91"><sup>91</sup></a> Scholars have described Boydell's folio as a precursor to the modern <a href="coffee_table_book" title="wikilink">coffee table book</a>.<a href="#fn92" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref92"><sup>92</sup></a></p>
