<h2 id="timeline">Timeline</h2>
<p>According to <a href="Samdhong_Rinpoche" title="wikilink">Samdhong Rinpoche</a> and the <a href="14th_Dalai_Lama" title="wikilink">14th Dalai Lama</a>, on <a href="January_1" title="wikilink">January 1</a> 1950 the PRC promised to &quot;liberate&quot; Tibet. The People's Liberation Army first entered eastern Tibet (<a href="Chamdo" class="uri" title="wikilink">Chamdo</a>) on <a href="October_7" title="wikilink">October 7</a> 1950.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> The highly mobile units of the PLA quickly surrounded the outnumbered Tibetan forces, and by <a href="October_19" title="wikilink">October 19</a> 1950, 5,000 Tibetan troops had surrendered.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> After confiscating their weapons, the PLA soldiers gave their prisoners lectures on socialism, and a small amount of money, and allowed them to return to their homes.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a></p>
<p>The PLA then continued on to central Tibet, but halted its advance 200km to the east of <a href="Lhasa" class="uri" title="wikilink">Lhasa</a>, at what China claimed was the <em>de jure</em> boundary of Tibet<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a><a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a>, where they stopped and demanded Tibet's &quot;peaceful liberation.&quot;<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a></p>
<p>The PLA, while possessing overwhelming military advantage, was also set on winning the hearts and minds of the Tibetan populace.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> At first, they treated the local populace very well, building roads, and paying locals for their labor.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> According to <a href="Tenzin_Gyatso,_14th_Dalai_Lama" title="wikilink">Tenzin Gyatso</a>, the current Dalai Lama, the PLA did not attack civilians: &quot;The Chinese were very disciplined. They were like the British soldiers (in 1904). Even better than the British, because they distributed some money (to villagers and local leaders). So they carefully planned.&quot;<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a></p>
<p>The PLA sent released prisoners (among them <a href="Ngapoi_Ngawang_Jigme" title="wikilink">Ngapoi Ngawang Jigme</a>, a captured governor) to Lhasa to negotiate with the Dalai Lama on the PLA's behalf.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> The PLA promised that if Tibet was &quot;peacefully liberated&quot;, the Tibetan elites would keep their privileges and power. At the same time, Jigme and other released captives testified to their good treatment by the PLA.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> As the PLA had stopped and was asking for peaceful negotiations instead of entering Lhasa unimpeded, the United Nations unanimously dropped the issue from the agenda.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> The combination of military pressure, reports of good treatment from locals and released prisoners, and the lack of international support convinced the Tibetan representatives to enter negotiations with the PLA.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a></p>
<p>Several months later, in May <a href="1951" class="uri" title="wikilink">1951</a>, the Tibetan representatives signed a <a href="Seventeen_Point_Agreement_for_the_Peaceful_Liberation_of_Tibet" title="wikilink">seventeen-point agreement</a> in Beijing with the PRC's <a href="Central_People&#39;s_Government" title="wikilink">Central People's Government</a> affirming China's sovereignty over Tibet. The agreement was ratified in <a href="Lhasa" class="uri" title="wikilink">Lhasa</a> a few months later.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a><a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> Point 15 of the agreement stated that the Chinese government would set up a military and administrative committee and a military area headquarters in Tibet. PLA troops entered Lhasa peacefully in the fall of 1951.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> An article releasd by the Tibetan Government in Exile in 1996 states that the treaty was imposed on Tibet by force and it &quot;was never validly concluded and was rejected by Tibetans&quot;<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a>, a position that was supported by a UK parliamentary review.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a><a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a></p>

<h3 id="tibetans">Tibetans</h3>
<p><a href="Samdhong_Rinpoche" title="wikilink">Samdhong Rinpoche</a>, the <a href="14th_Dalai_Lama" title="wikilink">14th Dalai Lama</a>, and other <a href="Central_Tibetan_Administration" title="wikilink">Tibetans in exile</a> have accused the PRC government of a campaign of terror which led to the destruction of monasteries and disappearance of up to 1.2 million Tibetans. By 1962 only 70 of the original 2,500 monasteries in the <a href="Tibet_Autonomous_Region" title="wikilink">Tibet Autonomous Region</a> were left and 93% of the monks were forced out. The &quot;1.2 million&quot; figure for deaths since 1950 dates to a figure from the Tibetan Government-in-exile which they break down to 433,000 through military action, 343,000 through famine, 173,000 through imprisonment, 157,000 through execution, 93,000 through torture and 9,000 through suicide.&lt;ref name&quot;IL&quot;&gt;Robert McCorquodale, Nicholas Orosz (eds.) <em>The Posiion of Tibet in International Law</em>, Serindia Publishers.''</ref></p>
<p>The high casualty reported by the Tibetans has been questioned by western scholars. Tom Grunfeld finds that the figure is &quot;without documentary evidence.&quot;<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> According to Patrick French, a supporter of the Tibetan cause who was able to view the data and calculations, the estimate is not reliable. The Tibetans were not able to process the data well enough to produce a credible total. French says this total was based on refugee interviews, but prevented outsider access to the data. French, who did gain access, found no names, but &quot;the insertion of seemingly random figures into each section, and constant, unchecked duplication.&quot;<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> Prior to 1950, population figures for Tibet, estimated by the Lhasa government and foreign visitors, generally ranged from 1 to 1.5 million. The official Tibetan census in 1953 only recorded a population of 1,273,969.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a></p>
<p>A document allegedly sourced to the PLA claims 87,000 deaths in the 1959-60 period.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a></p>

<p>Traditionally, a portion of the population in Tibet were serfs (&quot;<em>mi ser</em>&quot;),<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a><a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> bound to land often owned by wealthy Tibetan <a href="monasteries" class="uri" title="wikilink">monasteries</a> and Tibetan aristocrats. This however was untrue of eastern and northeastern two-thirds of Tibet where the nomads owned their own land.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a> The Chinese government claims that most Tibetans were still serfs in 1951, and have proclaimed that the Tibetan government inhibited the development of Tibet during its self-rule from 1913 to 1959, and opposed any modernization efforts proposed by the Chinese government.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a> Announcements were made via <a href="Radio_Peking" title="wikilink">Radio Peking</a> on October 25 to state the troops were there to &quot;free Tibetans from imperialist oppression&quot;.<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a> First generation Communist party leaders such as <a href="Mao_Zedong" title="wikilink">Mao Zedong</a> stated that the decision to unite Tibet into the PRC was done to achieve ethnic equality.<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a></p>

<h2 id="aftermath">Aftermath</h2>
<p>The seventeen-point agreement was initially put into effect in Tibet proper. However, Eastern <a href="Kham" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kham</a> and <a href="Amdo" class="uri" title="wikilink">Amdo</a> (the provinces of <a href="Xikang" class="uri" title="wikilink">Xikang</a> and <a href="Qinghai" class="uri" title="wikilink">Qinghai</a> in the Chinese administrative hierarchy) were outside the administration of the Tibetan government in Lhasa, and were thus treated like any other Chinese province with land redistribution implemented in full -- a peculiar idea given that the Khampas and nomads of Amdo traditionally owned their own land.<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a> Unsurprisingly, resistance broke out in <a href="Amdo" class="uri" title="wikilink">Amdo</a> and eastern <a href="Kham" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kham</a> in June 1956.</p>
<p>According to John Knaus, the author of the <em>Orphans of the Cold War</em>, by 1957, <a href="Kham" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kham</a> was in chaos. PLA reprisals against Khampa resistance fighters became increasingly brutal and included beatings, starving prisoners, and the repeated rape of prisoners' wives in front of them until they confessed. Monks and nuns were forced to have sex with each other and forcibly renounce their celebacy vows. After torture, these men and women were often killed.<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a> Even monastic networks came to be used by guerilla forces to relay messages and hide rebels.<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a> According to John Roberts II, a freelance writer, by the late 1950s, the number of Tibetan freedom fighters numbered in the tens of thousands. The resistance, supported by the <a href="Central_Intelligence_Agency" title="wikilink">Central Intelligence Agency</a> (CIA) under <a href="Eisenhower" class="uri" title="wikilink">Eisenhower</a>, eventually spread to Lhasa, which had become crowded with refugees.<a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a></p>
<p>According to John Roberts II, the &quot;peaceful liberation&quot; of Tibet culminated in the <a href="Lhasa_uprising" title="wikilink">Lhasa uprising</a> on March 10, 1959, when Chinese shelled a crowd of 30,000 Tibetan civilians with artillery.<a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a> The casualty was estimated in captured Chinese documents to be as many as 85,000.<a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a> During the <a href="Kennedy_administration" title="wikilink">Kennedy administration</a> special operations Air Force planes that were ready to drop supplies and ammunition were forced to stand by, resulting in the massacre of between six and eight thousand Tibetan resistance fighters.<a href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a> According to the Tibetan Government in Exile during the struggle tens of thousands of Tibetans were killed by the Chinese.<a href="#fn67" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a> The 14th Dalai Lama and other government principals fled to exile in India. Isolated <a href="Tibetan_resistance_movement" title="wikilink">resistance</a> continued in Tibet until 1972 when President Nixon pursued a new policy towards China and withdrew military and financial support.<a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a> The month of fighting along the route of the Dalai Lama's escape had virtually decimated the fighters and, according to the CIA, &quot;the backbone of the rebellion had been smashed.&quot;<a href="#fn69" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref69"><sup>69</sup></a></p>
<p>According to <a href="Felix_Greene" title="wikilink">Felix Greene</a>, the 1959 uprising failed to gain support from the Tibetans. &lt;U+201C&gt;Even western sources never estimated that more than 20,000 were involved&lt;U+2026&gt;this does not sound like mass support.&lt;U+201D&gt; <a href="#fn70" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a> (That figure would have been nearly 2% of Tibet's population.) UNHCR said tens of thousands of Tibetans fled. <a href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a> The CIA officer, Bruce Walker, who oversaw the operations of CIA trained Tibetan agents, was troubled by the hostility from the Tibetans: &lt;U+201C&gt;the radio teams were experiencing major resistance from the population inside Tibet.&lt;U+201D&gt;<a href="#fn72" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref72"><sup>72</sup></a> The CIA trained Tibetans, mostly Buddhists,<a href="#fn73" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref73"><sup>73</sup></a> from 1957 to 1972, in the United States, and parachuted them back into Tibet to organize rebellions against the PLA. But with little support from fellow Tibetans they often fell to the hands of the PLA quickly. In one incident, one agent was immediately reported by his own brother and all three agents in the team were arrested. They were not mistreated. After less than a month of propaganda sessions they were escorted to the Indian border and released. <a href="#fn74" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref74"><sup>74</sup></a></p>
