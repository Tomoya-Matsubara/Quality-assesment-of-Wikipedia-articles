Written by Blu Sanders, Natalie Hemby, and Lindsay Chapman, and produced by <a href="Dann_Huff" title="wikilink">Dann Huff</a>, it features <a href="country_music" title="wikilink">country music</a> singer <a href="Vince_Gill" title="wikilink">Vince Gill</a> on backing vocals. The song premiered on <a href="WSIX-FM" class="uri" title="wikilink">WSIX-FM</a> radio station on October 29th, 2012 and was made available for purchase on <a href="iTunes_store" title="wikilink">iTunes store</a> on the following day. It was officially sent to country radio stations on November 15, 2012. Musically, &quot;Don't Rush&quot; is a country song with influences of <a href="southern_soul" title="wikilink">country soul</a> and <a href="soft_rock" title="wikilink">soft rock</a>. It is Clarkson's second country single as a main act.</p>
<p>&quot;Don't Rush&quot; received critical acclaim from <a href="Music_journalism" title="wikilink">music critics</a> who praised its production for resonating the sound of country songs from the early '70s and '80s. Despite that, some critics felt the song is not as powerful as &quot;<a href="Don&#39;t_You_Wanna_Stay" title="wikilink">Don't You Wanna Stay</a>&quot;, Clarkson's country duet with <a href="Jason_Aldean" title="wikilink">Jason Aldean</a>.

The song's accompanying music video is composed of the live footage from the Country Music Association awards which was directed by Glenn Weiss.</p>
<h2 id="background-and-release">Background and release</h2>
<p>&quot;Don't Rush&quot; was originally written by Natalie Hemby and Blu Sanders in 2008.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> The idea of writing the song came from Hemby. She explained &quot;My friend Blu Sanders and I were together, and he goes, &lt;U+2018&gt;Have you ever met Lindsay Champan?&lt;U+2019&gt; And I was like, &lt;U+2018&gt;Nope!&lt;U+2019&gt; Basically he was like, &lt;U+2018&gt;Why don&lt;U+2019&gt;t we write with her? She has an absolutely gorgeous R&amp;B voice.&lt;U+2019&gt; He was like &lt;U+2018&gt;Let&lt;U+2019&gt;s get together and see what we can develop.&quot; Hemby also admitted that the song was written for Lindsay Chapman because the song's genre fit Chapman's musical direction at that time. She added, &quot;It had an Al Green-ish feel with a '70s throwback kind of vibe, and that's kind of what we were going for with her sound.&quot; Once the collaboration was completed, the song was never recorded and Hemby said that it &quot;just kind of fell by the wayside&quot;.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> Being a good friend with Clarkson, Sanders decided to take the initiative to send the song with a few other songs to the singer.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>According to Clarkson, when she first heard the song on March 2012, she decided to put it on hold. She explained, &quot;My goal as a singer is to capture the sentiment of a song and emote what the feeling is. I'm in a relationship and super happy, and I don't think I would have been able to sing this song eight months ago. Love should be celebrated, and this is a great description of where I'm at in my life. This is a couple's skate, not an all skate song.&quot;<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> &quot;Don't Rush&quot; is one of the three new tracks (the other two being &quot;<a href="Catch_My_Breath" title="wikilink">Catch My Breath</a>&quot; and &quot;People Like Us&quot;) that Clarkson recorded for her first greatest hits album, <em><a href="Greatest_Hits:_Chapter_One_(Kelly_Clarkson_album)" title="wikilink">Greatest Hits: Chapter One</a></em>.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> In an interview with <em><a href="Billboard_(magazine)" title="wikilink">Billboard</a></em>, Clarkson expressed her excitement of recording the song, saying</p>
<blockquote>
<p>People have been wanting me to release something specifically for country radio for years, but I didn't want to just release something that has a steel guitar on it [...] I wanted to release something I'm proud of, and we finally found that song. It's my favorite kind of country music; it's like 80s, 90s country music, that throwback, two-steppin' style. And I'm freakin' stoked I got Vince Gill to sing on it with me, so I win 'cause he's like one of my favorite people.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>&quot;Don't Rush&quot; is Clarkson's second country single as a main act and her fourth overall. Her first solo country single was the country remix version of &quot;<a href="Mr._Know_It_All" title="wikilink">Mr. Know It All</a>&quot;.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> It is also her fourth country duet with other artists. She first collaborated with <a href="Reba_McEntire" title="wikilink">Reba McEntire</a> on the 2007 country version of &quot;<a href="Because_of_You_(Kelly_Clarkson_song)#Reba_McEntire_and_Kelly_Clarkson_version" title="wikilink">Because of You</a>&quot;, followed by a collaboration with <a href="Jason_Aldean" title="wikilink">Jason Aldean</a> on &quot;<a href="Don&#39;t_You_Wanna_Stay" title="wikilink">Don't You Wanna Stay</a>&quot;, and another duet with <a href="Blake_Shelton" title="wikilink">Blake Shelton</a> on a song entitled &quot;There&lt;U+2019&gt;s a New Kid in Town&quot;.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> The song premiered on <a href="WSIX-FM" class="uri" title="wikilink">WSIX-FM</a> radio station on October 29th, 2012. It was made available for purchase on <a href="iTunes_Store" title="wikilink">iTunes Store</a> the following day, on October 30th, 2012, as the second single of the album.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> It received an immediate response from fans and an overwhelming demand from radio stations following Clarkson's performance of the song on <a href="Country_Music_Association_Awards" title="wikilink">Country Music Association Awards</a> on November 1, 2012.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> The song was officially sent to country radio stations on November 15, 2012.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="composition">Composition</h2>

<p>&quot;Don't Rush&quot; is a country song written by Blu Sanders, Natalie Hemby and Lindsay Dawn Chapman, and produced by <a href="Dann_Huff" title="wikilink">Dann Huff</a>.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> It features American country <a href="singer-songwriter" class="uri" title="wikilink">singer-songwriter</a> <a href="Vince_Gill" title="wikilink">Vince Gill</a>.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> The song is set in a &quot;drowsy, take-it-easy beat&quot;<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> which is composed of a layer of Clarkson's and Gill's soulful harmonies.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> The song begins with a breezy soft-rock tune. In the first verse, Clarkson sings &quot;I see the way you&lt;U+2019&gt;re looking at me / Baby know I&lt;U+2019&gt;m feeling it too / We can just light up every candle / Move from room to room&quot; which was ensued by the sound of Gill's guitar.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> As the song launches into the chorus, both Clarkson and Gill are heard singing &quot;Stopping every minute just because you're in it/Wishing everyday was Sunday, you're right next to me/It's how it's supposed to be&quot;, a vocal chorus deemed as &quot;slightly awkward&quot; by Will Hermes of <em><a href="Rolling_Stone" title="wikilink">Rolling Stone</a></em>.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> In the final chorus, the pair pauses before the key changes at minute three.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a><a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a></p>
<p>Jonathan Keefe of <a href="Slant_Magazine" title="wikilink">Slant Magazine</a> praised the production of the song for its light-handed approach which resonates the early-'80s work of artists like <a href="Barbara_Mandrell" title="wikilink">Barbara Mandrell</a> and <a href="Ronnie_Milsap" title="wikilink">Ronnie Milsap</a>.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> Mark Blankenship of <a href="Logo_(TV_channel)" title="wikilink">Logo</a> also opined that the song &quot;sounds like an easy listening hit from the 70s or 80s, with gently groovy music underneath a laid-back vocal.&quot;<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> It is noted that the sound of <a href="Hammond_organ" title="wikilink">Hammond organ</a> is instrumental in resonating the vibe of early '80s in the song.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> Zara Golden of <a href="VH1" class="uri" title="wikilink">VH1</a> called the instrumentation of the song as &quot;bright and breezy&quot; and remarked that it is more <a href="soft_rock" title="wikilink">soft-rock-y</a> than &quot;Don't You Wanna Stay&quot;.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> Sam Lansky of <em><a href="Idolator_(website)" title="wikilink">Idolator</a></em> noted that Clarkson's restrained vocals are imbued with a country twang which is suitable for the song's country instrumentation. She also added that having a duet partner in the song &quot;brings Clarkson's impressively emotive vocals to life&quot;.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a></p>
<p>Lyrically, the song finds Clarkson taking her time in love,<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> and crooning about praising her lover.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> Sam Wilbur of <a href="AOL_Radio" title="wikilink">AOL Radio</a> is contented with the song's central theme, writing &quot;It's a simple, laid back love song that is a nice change of pace for Clarkson who, along with 'Catch My Breath,' is singing more about love and happiness, instead of break-ups and heartbreak.&quot;<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="reception">Reception</h2>
<h3 id="critical-reception">Critical reception</h3>
<p>&quot;Don't Rush&quot; has generally received critical acclaim from music critics. Rachel Brodsky of <a href="MTV" class="uri" title="wikilink">MTV</a> gave a positive review towards the song, writing &quot;It's true -- we're not totally used to hearing Kelly exploring her country side (though she is from Texas, so go figure), but judging by the vocals on &quot;Don't Rush,&quot; we think we could get used to Country Kelly&quot;.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> Sam Wilbur of AOL Radio complimented the song for being &quot;a feel-good track with a nostalgic, classic country feel&quot;.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> Billy Dukes of <em><a href="Taste_of_Country" title="wikilink">Taste of Country</a></em> gave the song four stars and a half, writing &quot;It&lt;U+2019&gt;s difficult for a female vocalist to sound sexy without drawing criticism. Clarkson&lt;U+2019&gt;s voice is a wine and roses romance, instead of the wanton yearn of a beauty in a too-short skirt. The original &lt;U+2018&gt;American Idol&lt;U+2019&gt; may have found her niche.&quot;<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> Michaelangelo Matos of <em><a href="New_York_Post" title="wikilink">New York Post</a></em> gave the song three stars out of five and praised Clarkson for &quot;getting completely into character&quot; and successfully delivering the emotion of the song.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> Mark Blankenship of Logo complimented Clarkson for embracing her country side. Calling the song as &quot;a good song&quot;, he concluded his review by writing &quot;Even better, it&lt;U+2019&gt;s a flirty, seductive love song, not a furious break-up anthem, which is a nice change after ten years of Kelly&lt;U+2019&gt;s heartbroken rage.&quot;<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> The same opinion was echoed by Jessica Sager of <a href="Townsquare_Media" title="wikilink">PopCrush</a> who deemed the song as &quot;an easy, breezy, midtempo tune&quot;. She added that although the single is not as powerful as Clarkson's duet with Jason Aldean on &quot;Don't You Wanna Stay&quot;, she opined that it is &quot;a great reminder that Clarkson is capable of much more than breakup anthems.&quot;<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> Chuck Dauphin of <em>Billboard</em> ranked &quot;Don't Rush&quot; at number eight in his list of Top 10 Country Songs of 2012, writing &quot;One of the most luscious sounding love songs I have heard in a while. It's the definition of 'Ear Candy.' If you&lt;U+2019&gt;re not in love, you'll want to be after hear it.&quot;<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a></p>
