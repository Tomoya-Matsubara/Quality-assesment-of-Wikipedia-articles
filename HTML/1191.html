<p>The <strong>porbeagle</strong> (<em>Lamna nasus</em>) is a <a href="species" class="uri" title="wikilink">species</a> of <a href="Lamniformes" title="wikilink">mackerel shark</a> in the <a href="family_(biology)" title="wikilink">family</a> <a href="Lamnidae" class="uri" title="wikilink">Lamnidae</a>, distributed widely in the cold and temperate marine waters of the <a href="North_Atlantic" title="wikilink">North Atlantic</a> and <a href="Southern_Hemisphere" title="wikilink">Southern Hemisphere</a>. In the <a href="North_Pacific" title="wikilink">North Pacific</a>, its ecological equivalent is the closely related <a href="salmon_shark" title="wikilink">salmon shark</a> (<em>L. ditropis</em>). The porbeagle typically reaches  in length and a weight of ; North Atlantic sharks grow larger than Southern Hemisphere sharks and differ in coloration and aspects of life history. Gray above and white below, the porbeagle has a very stout midsection that tapers towards the long, pointed snout and the narrow <a href="caudal_peduncle" title="wikilink">base of the tail</a>. It has large <a href="pectoral_fin" title="wikilink">pectoral</a> and first <a href="dorsal_fin" title="wikilink">dorsal fins</a>, tiny <a href="pelvic_fin" title="wikilink">pelvic</a>, second dorsal, and <a href="anal_fin" title="wikilink">anal fins</a>, and a crescent-shaped <a href="caudal_fin" title="wikilink">caudal fin</a>. The most distinctive features of this species are its three-cusped teeth, the white blotch at the aft base of its first dorsal fin, and the two pairs of lateral keels on its tail.</p>
<p>The porbeagle is an opportunistic hunter that preys mainly on <a href="bony_fish" title="wikilink">bony fishes</a> and <a href="cephalopod" title="wikilink">cephalopods</a> throughout the <a href="water_column" title="wikilink">water column</a>, including the bottom. Most commonly found over food-rich <a href="bank_(topography)" title="wikilink">banks</a> on the outer <a href="continental_shelf" title="wikilink">continental shelf</a>, it makes occasional forays both close to shore and into the <a href="open_ocean" title="wikilink">open ocean</a> to a depth of . It also conducts long-distance seasonal <a href="fish_migration" title="wikilink">migrations</a>, generally shifting between shallower and deeper water. The porbeagle is fast and highly active, with <a href="endothermy" title="wikilink">physiological adaptations</a> that enable it to maintain a higher body temperature than the surrounding water. It can be solitary or gregarious, and has been known to perform seemingly <a href="play_(activity)" title="wikilink">playful</a> behavior. This shark is <a href="aplacental_viviparous" title="wikilink">aplacental viviparous</a> with <a href="oophagy" class="uri" title="wikilink">oophagy</a>, developing <a href="embryo" title="wikilink">embryos</a> being retained within the mother's <a href="uterus" class="uri" title="wikilink">uterus</a> and subsisting on <a href="trophic_egg" title="wikilink">non-viable eggs</a>. Females typically bear four pups every year.</p>
<p>Only a few <a href="shark_attack" title="wikilink">shark attacks</a> of uncertain provenance have been attributed to the porbeagle. It is well regarded as a <a href="game_fish" title="wikilink">game fish</a> by <a href="recreational_fishing" title="wikilink">recreational anglers</a>. The meat and fins of the porbeagle are highly valued, which has led to a long history of intense human exploitation. However, this species cannot sustain heavy fishing pressure due to its low reproductive capacity. Direct <a href="commercial_fishing" title="wikilink">commercial fishing</a> for the porbeagle, principally by <a href="Norway" title="wikilink">Norwegian</a> <a href="longline_fishing" title="wikilink">longliners</a>, led to <a href="fish_stock" title="wikilink">stock</a> collapses in the eastern North Atlantic in the 1950s, and the western North Atlantic in the 1960s. The porbeagle continues to be caught throughout its range, both intentionally and as <a href="bycatch" class="uri" title="wikilink">bycatch</a>, with varying degrees of monitoring and management. The <a href="International_Union_for_Conservation_of_Nature" title="wikilink">International Union for Conservation of Nature</a> (IUCN) has assessed the porbeagle as <a href="Vulnerable_species" title="wikilink">Vulnerable</a> worldwide, and as either <a href="Endangered" class="uri" title="wikilink">Endangered</a> or <a href="Critically_Endangered" title="wikilink">Critically Endangered</a> in different parts of its northern range.</p>

<h2 id="distribution-and-habitat">Distribution and habitat</h2>
<p>The porbeagle has an almost global amphitemperate distribution, i.e. it is absent from the tropics; in the North Pacific, its <a href="ecological_niche" title="wikilink">niche</a> is assumed by the salmon shark.

<p>Porbeagle populations in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres appear to be completely separate.

Several discrete stocks are likely present in the Southern Hemisphere as well. This species segregates by size and sex in the North Atlantic, and at least by size in the South Pacific. For example, males outnumber females 2:1 off <a href="Spain" class="uri" title="wikilink">Spain</a>, females are 30% more numerous than males off <a href="Scotland" class="uri" title="wikilink">Scotland</a>, and immature males are predominant in the <a href="Bristol_Channel" title="wikilink">Bristol Channel</a>.

<p>In the western North Atlantic, porbeagles feed mainly on pelagic fishes and squid in spring, and on groundfishes in the fall; this pattern corresponds to the spring-fall migration of these sharks from deeper to shallower waters, and the most available prey types in those respective habitats. Therefore, the porbeagle seems to be an opportunistic <a href="predator" class="uri" title="wikilink">predator</a> without strong diet specificity.<a href="#fn70" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a> During spring and summer in the <a href="Celtic_Sea" title="wikilink">Celtic Sea</a> and on the outer Nova <a href="Scotian_Shelf" title="wikilink">Scotian Shelf</a>, porbeagles congregate at <a href="tidal" title="wikilink">tidally</a> induced thermal fronts to feed on fish that have been drawn by high concentrations of <a href="zooplankton" class="uri" title="wikilink">zooplankton</a>.<a href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a><a href="#fn72" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref72"><sup>72</sup></a> Hunting porbeagles regularly dive from the surface all the way to the bottom, cycling back every few hours; this vertical movement may aid in the detection of <a href="olfaction" title="wikilink">olfactory</a> cues.<a href="#fn73" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref73"><sup>73</sup></a> There is a report of a one-year-old porbeagle  long, which had fed on <a href="krill" class="uri" title="wikilink">krill</a> and <a href="polychaete_worm" title="wikilink">polychaete worms</a>.<a href="#fn74" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref74"><sup>74</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="life-history">Life history</h3>

<p>The timing of the porbeagle's reproductive cycle is unusual in that it is largely similar in both hemispheres, rather than being offset by six months. This suggests that its reproduction is not significantly affected by temperature or day length, perhaps owing to its endothermic physiology.<a href="#fn75" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref75"><sup>75</sup></a> Mating takes place mainly between September and November, though females with fresh mating scars have been reported as late as January off the <a href="Shetland_Islands" title="wikilink">Shetland Islands</a>. The male bites at the female's pectoral fins, gill region, and flanks while courting and to hold on for <a href="animal_sexual_behavior" title="wikilink">copulation</a>.<a href="#fn76" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref76"><sup>76</sup></a> Two mating grounds are known for western North Atlantic porbeagles, one off <a href="Newfoundland_(island)" title="wikilink">Newfoundland</a> and the other on <a href="Georges_Bank" title="wikilink">Georges Bank</a> in the <a href="Gulf_of_Maine" title="wikilink">Gulf of Maine</a>.<a href="#fn77" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref77"><sup>77</sup></a><a href="#fn78" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref78"><sup>78</sup></a> Adult females have a single functional <a href="ovary" class="uri" title="wikilink">ovary</a>, on the right, and two functional <a href="uteruses" class="uri" title="wikilink">uteruses</a>. They probably reproduce every year. The litter size is typically four, with two embryos oriented in opposing directions sharing each uterus; on rare occasions a litter may contain as few as one or as many as five pups.<a href="#fn79" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref79"><sup>79</sup></a> The <a href="gestation_period" title="wikilink">gestation period</a> is 8&lt;U+2013&gt;9 months.<a href="#fn80" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref80"><sup>80</sup></a><a href="#fn81" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref81"><sup>81</sup></a></p>
<p>Like other members of its family, the porbeagle is <a href="aplacental_viviparous" title="wikilink">aplacental viviparous</a> with <a href="oophagy" class="uri" title="wikilink">oophagy</a>, i.e. the main source of embryonic nutrition are unfertilized eggs. During the first half of pregnancy, the mother <a href="ovulation" title="wikilink">ovulates</a> enormous numbers of tiny <a href="ovum" title="wikilink">ova</a>, packed into <a href="egg_case_(Chondrichthyes)" title="wikilink">capsules</a> up to  long, into her uteruses. A newly conceived embryo is sustained by a <a href="yolk_sac" title="wikilink">yolk sac</a> and emerges from its egg capsule at  long. At this time, the embryo has well-developed <a href="external_gills" title="wikilink">external gills</a> and a <a href="spiral_valve" title="wikilink">spiral valve</a> <a href="intestine" class="uri" title="wikilink">intestine</a>. When the embryo is  long, it has resorbed its external gills and most of its yolk sac, but cannot yet feed as it lacks the means to open egg capsules. At a length of , the embryo grows two massive, recurved &quot;fangs&quot; in the lower jaw for tearing open capsules, as well as two much smaller teeth in the upper jaw. It begins to feed voraciously on yolk, acquiring an enormously distended stomach; to accommodate this, the muscles on the belly split down the middle and the skin on the abdomen stretches greatly.<a href="#fn82" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref82"><sup>82</sup></a><a href="#fn83" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref83"><sup>83</sup></a></p>
<p>At  long, the embryo appears pink because it lacks <a href="pigment" class="uri" title="wikilink">pigment</a> except in its eyes, and its head and gill region are laterally enlarged and gelatinous. The yolk stomach can comprise up to 81% of the embryo's total weight when it is  long. The embryo gains pigment and sheds its fangs at a length of . Around this time, the mother stops producing ova. From then on, the embryo relies mainly on the yolk stored in its stomach, though it may continue to feed on remaining eggs by squishing the capsules between its jaws or swallowing them whole. It begins to transfer its energy stores from its stomach to its liver, causing the former to shrink and the latter to grow exponentially. The embryo is essentially fully pigmented by a length of , and has assumed its newborn appearance by a length of . By then, its stomach has shrunk enough for the abdominal muscles to close, leaving what has been termed an &quot;umbilical scar&quot; or &quot;yolk sac scar&quot; (neither is accurate). Several series of single-cusped teeth grow in both jaws, though they lie flat and remain non-functional until birth.<a href="#fn84" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref84"><sup>84</sup></a><a href="#fn85" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref85"><sup>85</sup></a></p>

<p>Intensive fishing for the porbeagle dates back the 1930s, when <a href="Norway" class="uri" title="wikilink">Norway</a> and to a lesser extent <a href="Denmark" class="uri" title="wikilink">Denmark</a> began operating longline vessels in the western North Atlantic. The Norwegian annual catch rose from 279 tons in 1926 to 3,884 tons in 1933, and peaked at around 6,000 tons in 1947, with the resumption of fishing after <a href="World_War_II" title="wikilink">World War II</a>. Soon after the stock collapsed: Norwegian annual catches declined steadily to 1,200&lt;U+2013&gt;1,900 tons from 1953 to 1960, 160&lt;U+2013&gt;300 tons in the early 1970s, and 10&lt;U+2013&gt;40 tons in the late 1980s to early 1990s. Similarly, Danish annual catches fell from 1,500 tons in the early 1950s to under 100 tons in the 1990s.<a href="#fn118" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref118"><sup>118</sup></a><a href="#fn119" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref119"><sup>119</sup></a> Presently, many European countries continue to catch porbeagles in the eastern North Atlantic, with Norway, Denmark, France, and Spain foremost among them. France and Spain began to target porbeagles in the eastern North Atlantic in the 1970s. French fishers operate mainly in the Celtic Sea and the <a href="Bay_of_Biscay" title="wikilink">Bay of Biscay</a>, and saw a decline from an annual catch of over 1,000 tons in 1979 to 300&lt;U+2013&gt;400 tons in the late 1990s. Catches by Spanish fishers have been highly variable, ranging from negligible to over 4,000 tons per year, which may reflect shifts of fishing effort into historically less-exploited waters.<a href="#fn120" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref120"><sup>120</sup></a></p>
<p>As porbeagles had become scarce in the eastern North Atlantic, in the 1960s the Norwegian fishing fleet moved west to the waters off New England and Newfoundland. A few years later, they were joined by longline vessels from the <a href="Faroe_Islands" title="wikilink">Faroe Islands</a>. Norwegian annual catches rose from 1,900 tons in 1961 to over 9,000 tons in 1965;<a href="#fn121" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref121"><sup>121</sup></a> the catch was largely exported to <a href="Italy" class="uri" title="wikilink">Italy</a>, where porbeagle (<em>smerglio</em>) is an extremely popular food fish.<a href="#fn122" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref122"><sup>122</sup></a><a href="#fn123" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref123"><sup>123</sup></a> Again, the stock collapsed, this time in only six years: by 1970 Norwegian catches had fallen to under 1,000 tons per year, and Faroese catches observed a similar trend. With the population decimated, most fishers moved on or switched to other species. Porbeagle numbers gradually recovered in the ensuing 25 years, to about 30% of pre-exploitation levels. In 1995, <a href="Canada" class="uri" title="wikilink">Canada</a> established an <a href="Exclusive_Economic_Zone" title="wikilink">Exclusive Economic Zone</a> (EEZ) and became the primary fisher of porbeagles in the region. Between 1994 and 1998, Canadian fishing vessels landed 1,000&lt;U+2013&gt;2,000 tons per year, which depleted the population to 11&lt;U+2013&gt;17% of pre-exploitation levels by 2000.<a href="#fn124" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref124"><sup>124</sup></a> Strict regulations and greatly reduced fishing quotas introduced in 2000 have since begun to reverse the stock decline, though recovery of the stock is projected to take decades due to the low productivity of the species.<a href="#fn125" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref125"><sup>125</sup></a> There is evidence that incidental <a href="artificial_selection" title="wikilink">artificial selection</a> caused by heavy fishing has led to a <a href="compensatory_growth" title="wikilink">compensatory growth</a> response, i.e. faster growth and earlier maturation.<a href="#fn126" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref126"><sup>126</sup></a></p>
<p>In the Southern Hemisphere, commercial fishing for the porbeagle is mostly undocumented. Substantial numbers are caught incidentally by pelagic longline fisheries targeting more valuable species such as <a href="southern_bluefin_tuna" title="wikilink">southern bluefin tuna</a> (<em>Thunnus maccoyii</em>), <a href="swordfish" class="uri" title="wikilink">swordfish</a> (<em>Xiphius gladius</em>), and <a href="Patagonian_toothfish" title="wikilink">Patagonian toothfish</a> (<em>Dissostichus eleginoides</em>), including vessels operated by <a href="Japan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Japan</a>, <a href="Uruguay" class="uri" title="wikilink">Uruguay</a>, <a href="Argentina" class="uri" title="wikilink">Argentina</a>, <a href="South_Africa" title="wikilink">South Africa</a>, and <a href="New_Zealand" title="wikilink">New Zealand</a>. Porbeagle catches by the Uruguayan tuna pelagic longline fishery peaked in 1984 with 150 tons landed. Records of <a href="catch_per_unit_effort" title="wikilink">catch per unit effort</a> (CPUE) for this fishery have shown a 90% decline in porbeagle landings from 1988 to 1998, though it is uncertain whether this reflects a real population decline or changing fishing habits. New Zealand has reported annual catches of 150&lt;U+2013&gt;300 tons, mostly of immature individuals, from 1998 to 2003.<a href="#fn127" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref127"><sup>127</sup></a></p>

Factors including a small litter size, long maturation time, and the capture of multiple age classes all contribute to this shark's susceptibility to <a href="overfishing" class="uri" title="wikilink">overfishing</a>.<a href="#fn128" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref128"><sup>128</sup></a> The <a href="International_Union_for_Conservation_of_Nature" title="wikilink">International Union for Conservation of Nature</a> has assessed the porbeagle globally as <a href="Vulnerable_species" title="wikilink">Vulnerable</a>,<a href="#fn129" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref129"><sup>129</sup></a> <a href="Endangered" class="uri" title="wikilink">Endangered</a> in the western North Atlantic,<a href="#fn130" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref130"><sup>130</sup></a> and <a href="Critically_Endangered" title="wikilink">Critically Endangered</a> in the eastern North Atlantic<a href="#fn131" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref131"><sup>131</sup></a> and Mediterranean Sea.<a href="#fn132" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref132"><sup>132</sup></a></p>
<p>The porbeagle is listed on Annex 1 (Highly Migratory Species) of the <a href="UN_Convention_on_the_Law_of_the_Sea" title="wikilink">UN Convention on the Law of the Sea</a> (UNCLOS) and on Annex 1 of the <a href="Bonn_Convention" title="wikilink">Conservation of Migratory Species</a> (CMS; also known as the <a href="Bonn_Convention" title="wikilink">Bonn Convention</a>) <a href="Migratory_Sharks_MoU" title="wikilink">Migratory Shark Memorandum of Understanding</a>. Although the Animals Committee of the UN <a href="Convention_on_International_Trade_in_Endangered_Species_of_Wild_Fauna_and_Flora" title="wikilink">Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora</a> (CITES) recommended additional conservation actions for the porbeagle, CITES rejected proposals to list the species in 2008 and again in 2010. This species benefits from bans on shark finning instituted by several nations and supranational entities, including Canada, the United States, Brazil, <a href="Australia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Australia</a>, the <a href="European_Union" title="wikilink">European Union</a>, and the <a href="International_Commission_for_the_Conservation_of_Atlantic_Tunas" title="wikilink">International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas</a> (ICCAT).<a href="#fn133" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref133"><sup>133</sup></a></p>
<p>The only regulation of porbeagle catches in the Southern Hemisphere is New Zealand's total allowable catch (TAC) of 249 tons per year, instituted in 2004.<a href="#fn134" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref134"><sup>134</sup></a> In the eastern North Atlantic, porbeagle fisheries have never been restricted despite well-documented historical declines. Since 1985, Norway and the Faroe Islands are allowed annual quotas of 200 tons and 125 tons respectively from <a href="European_Community" title="wikilink">European Community</a> waters. Although these quotas are lower than the originals set in 1982 (500 tons for Norway and 300 tons for the Faroe Islands), they are still consistently higher than the yearly total porbeagle catch in the region and thus have no practical effect.<a href="#fn135" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref135"><sup>135</sup></a></p>
<p>In the Mediterranean Sea, the porbeagle is on the verge of extinction, with a population decline of over 99.99% since the mid-20th century. Its range has contracted to the waters around the <a href="Italian_Peninsula" title="wikilink">Italian Peninsula</a>, where there may be a nursery area. Only a few dozen specimens have been recorded in the past few decades, from scientific surveys, swordfish fishery bycatch, and sport fishers.<a href="#fn136" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref136"><sup>136</sup></a><a href="#fn137" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref137"><sup>137</sup></a> In 1995, it was included in Annex III (&quot;species whose exploitation is regulated&quot;) of the Barcelona Convention Protocol on protected areas and biodiversity in the Mediterranean, which has not been ratified. In 1997, it was listed on Appendix III of the Bern Convention (the Convention on the Conservation of European Wildlife and Natural Habitats). However, these listings have yet to result in the implementation of new management plans, despite the recognized need for urgent action.<a href="#fn138" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref138"><sup>138</sup></a></p>
<p>The western North Atlantic porbeagle population has a more positive prospect than in the eastern North Atlantic. Fishing in Canadian waters was originally regulated by the 1995 Fisheries Management Plan for pelagic sharks in Atlantic Canada, which established an annual quota of 1,500 tons, restricted the time, place, and gear types allowed for commercial fishing, and set limits for bycatch and recreational fishing. In 2000&lt;U+2013&gt;2001, Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO) prepared a detailed population model and concluded that a quota of 200&lt;U+2013&gt;250 tons would allow for population growth, resulting in a quota of 250 tons being adopted for the period of 2002&lt;U+2013&gt;2007. The mating ground off of Newfoundland was also closed to shark fishing. In 2004, the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC) listed the porbeagle as Endangered, largely on the basis of the low population abundance (&lt;25% of original numbers). Canada decided not to list the species under its Species At Risk Act, but further reduced the total fishing quota to 185 tons.<a href="#fn139" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref139"><sup>139</sup></a> In US waters, the 1993 Fishery Management Plan for Sharks of the Atlantic Ocean sets an annual quota of 92 tons (post-processing) for the porbeagle.<a href="#fn140" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref140"><sup>140</sup></a> In 2006, this species was listed as a &quot;Species of Concern&quot; by the <a href="National_Marine_Fisheries_Service" title="wikilink">National Marine Fisheries Service</a> (NMFS), meaning that it merits conservation concern but there is insufficient data for inclusion on the US <a href="Endangered_Species_Act" title="wikilink">Endangered Species Act</a>.<a href="#fn141" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref141"><sup>141</sup></a></p>
