<p><strong>St Kilda</strong> () is an isolated <a href="archipelago" class="uri" title="wikilink">archipelago</a> 64 kilometres (40 mi) west-northwest of <a href="North_Uist" title="wikilink">North Uist</a> in the North <a href="Atlantic_Ocean" title="wikilink">Atlantic Ocean</a>. It contains the westernmost islands of the <a href="Outer_Hebrides" title="wikilink">Outer Hebrides</a> of <a href="Scotland" class="uri" title="wikilink">Scotland</a>.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> The largest island is <a href="Hirta" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hirta</a>, whose sea cliffs are the highest in the United Kingdom. The Gaelic-speaking population probably never exceeded 180 and was never more than 100 after 1851. Although St Kilda was permanently inhabited for at least two millennia, and despite the inhabitants' unique way of life, the entire population was evacuated in 1930. The only residents are now military personnel.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> The islands are administratively a part of the <a href="Comhairle_nan_Eilean_Siar" title="wikilink">Comhairle nan Eilean Siar</a> local authority area.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>The origin of the name <em>St Kilda</em> is a matter of conjecture. The islands' human heritage includes numerous unique architectural features from the historic and prehistoric periods, although the earliest written records of island life date from the <a href="Late_Middle_Ages" title="wikilink">Late Middle Ages</a>. The medieval village on Hirta was rebuilt in the 19th century, but the influences of religion, tourism and the <a href="World_War_I" title="wikilink">First World War</a> contributed to the island's evacuation in 1930.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> The story of St Kilda has attracted artistic interpretations, including a recent <a href="opera" class="uri" title="wikilink">opera</a>.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>The entire archipelago is owned by the <a href="National_Trust_for_Scotland" title="wikilink">National Trust for Scotland</a>. It became one of Scotland's four <a href="World_Heritage_Site" title="wikilink">World Heritage Sites</a> in 1986 and is one of the few in the world to hold joint status for its natural, marine and cultural qualities.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> The islands are a breeding ground for many important <a href="seabird" class="uri" title="wikilink">seabird</a> species including <a href="Northern_Gannet" title="wikilink">Northern Gannets</a>, <a href="Atlantic_Puffin" title="wikilink">Atlantic Puffins</a>, and <a href="Northern_Fulmar" title="wikilink">Northern Fulmars</a>. The St Kilda <a href="Winter_Wren" title="wikilink">Wren</a> and <a href="St._Kilda_Field_Mouse" title="wikilink">St Kilda Field Mouse</a> are endemic sub-species.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> Parties of volunteers work on the islands in the summer months to restore the many ruined buildings the native St Kildans left behind.

<h2 id="origin-of-names">Origin of names</h2>
<p><img src="Sraidhiort2.jpg" title="fig:The Street, showing the unmaintained houses" alt="The Street, showing the unmaintained houses" /> No saint is known by the name of <em>Kilda</em>, and various theories have been proposed for the word's origin. Haswell-Smith (2004) notes that the full name <em>St Kilda</em> first appears on a Dutch map of 1666, and that it may have been derived from Norse <em>sunt kelda</em> (&quot;sweet wellwater&quot;) or from a mistaken Dutch assumption that the spring <em>Tobar Childa</em> was dedicated to a saint. (In fact it is a combination of the <a href="Scottish_Gaelic_language" title="wikilink">Gaelic</a> and Norse words for <em>well</em>, i.e., &quot;well well&quot;).<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<p><a href="Martin_Martin" title="wikilink">Martin Martin</a>, who visited in 1697, believed that the name &quot;is taken from one Kilder, who lived here; and from him the large well Toubir-Kilda has also its name&quot;.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a><a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> Maclean (1972) similarly suggests it may come from a corruption of the <a href="Old_Norse" title="wikilink">Old Norse</a> name for the spring on Hirta, <em>Childa</em>, and states that a 1588 map identifies the archipelago as <em>Kilda</em>. He also speculates that it may refer to the <em><a href="Culdee" title="wikilink">Culdees</a></em>, <a href="anchorite" title="wikilink">anchorites</a> who may have brought Christianity to the island, or be a corruption of the Gaelic name for the main island of the group, since the islanders tended to pronounce <em>r</em> as <em>l</em>, and thus habitually referred to the island as <em>Hilta.</em><a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> Steel (1988) adds weight to the idea, noting that the islanders pronounced the <em>H</em> with a &quot;somewhat guttural quality&quot;, making the sound they used for <em>Hirta</em> &quot;almost&quot; <em>Kilta</em>.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<p>Maclean (1972) further suggests that the Dutch may have simply made a cartographical error, and confused Hirta with <em>Skildar</em>, the old name for <a href="Haskeir" class="uri" title="wikilink">Haskeir</a> island much nearer the main <a href="Outer_Hebrides" title="wikilink">Outer Hebrides</a> archipelago.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a><a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> Quine (2000) hypothesises that the name is derived from a series of cartographical errors, starting with the use of the Old <a href="Iceland" title="wikilink">Icelandic</a> <em>Skildir</em> (&quot;shields&quot;) and appearing as <em>Skildar</em> on a map by Nicholas de Nicolay (1583). This, so the hypothesis goes, was transcribed in error by Lucas J. Waghenear in his 1592 charts without the trailing <em>r</em> and with a period after the <em>S</em>, creating <em>S.Kilda</em>. This was in turn assumed to stand for a saint by others, creating the form that has been used for several centuries, <em>St Kilda</em>.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a><a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a><a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
<p><img src="Sraidhiort.jpg" title="fig:The Village Street, showing restoration work" alt="The Village Street, showing restoration work" /> The origin of 'Hirta' is similarly open to interpretation. Martin (1703) avers that &quot;Hirta is taken from the Irish <em>Ier</em>, which in that language signifies west&quot;.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> Maclean offers several options, including an (unspecified)<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> Celtic word meaning 'gloom' or 'death', or the Scots Gaelic <em>h-Iar-Tir</em> (&quot;westland&quot;). Drawing on an Icelandic <a href="Icelanders&#39;_sagas" title="wikilink">saga</a> describing an early 13th-century voyage to <a href="Ireland" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ireland</a> that mentions a visit to the islands of <em>Hirtir</em>, he speculates that the shape of Hirta resembles a <a href="stag" class="uri" title="wikilink">stag</a>, <em>Hirtir</em> (&quot;stags&quot; in Norse).<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> Steel (1998) quotes the view of Reverend Neil Mackenzie, who lived there from 1829 to 1844, that the name is derived from the Gaelic <em>I-&lt;U+00C0&gt;rd</em> (English: &quot;high island&quot;), and a further possibility that it is from the Norse <em>Hirt</em> (&quot;shepherd&quot;).<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> In a similar vein, Murray (1966) speculates that the Norse <em>Hird&lt;U+00F6&gt;</em>, pronounced 'Hirtha' (&quot;herd island&quot;), may be the origin.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> All the names of and on the islands are fully discussed by Coates (1990).<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="geography">Geography</h2>
<p><img src="St_Kilda_map.png" title="fig:The St Kilda archipelago" alt="The St Kilda archipelago" /> The islands are comprised of <a href="Tertiary" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tertiary</a> <a href="igneous" class="uri" title="wikilink">igneous</a> formations of <a href="granites" class="uri" title="wikilink">granites</a> and <a href="gabbro" class="uri" title="wikilink">gabbro</a>, heavily weathered by the elements. The archipelago represents the remnants of a long extinct ring volcano rising from a seabed plateau approximately 40 metres (130 ft) below sea level.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a></p>
<p>At 670 ha (1,656 acres) in extent <a href="Hirta" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hirta</a> is the largest island in the group and comprises more than 78% of the land area of the archipelago. Next in size are <a href="Soay,_St_Kilda" title="wikilink">Soay</a> (English: 'sheep island') at 99 ha (247 acres) and <a href="Boreray,_St_Kilda" title="wikilink">Boreray</a> ('the fortified isle'), 77 ha (190 acres).<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> Soay is 0.5 kilometres (0.3 mi) northwest of Hirta, Boreray 6 kilometres (4 mi) to the northeast. Smaller <a href="islet" title="wikilink">islets</a> and <a href="Stack_(geology)" title="wikilink">stacks</a> in the group include <a href="Stac_an_Armin" title="wikilink">Stac an Armin</a> ('warrior's stack'), <a href="Stac_Lee" title="wikilink">Stac Lee</a> ('grey stack') and <a href="Stac_Levenish" title="wikilink">Stac Levenish</a> ('stream' or 'torrent').<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a><a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> The island of <a href="D&lt;U+00F9&gt;n,_St_Kilda" title="wikilink">D&lt;U+00F9&gt;n</a> ('fort'), which protects Village Bay from the prevailing southwesterly winds, was at one time joined to Hirta by a natural arch. MacLean (1972) suggests that the arch was broken when struck by a <a href="galleon" class="uri" title="wikilink">galleon</a> fleeing the defeat of the <a href="Spanish_Armada" title="wikilink">Armada</a>, but other sources, such as Mitchell (1992) and Fleming (2005), provide the more credible (if less romantic) explanation that the arch was simply swept away by one of the many fierce storms that batter the islands every winter.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a><a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a></p>
<p>The highest point in the archipelago, Conachair ('the beacon') at 430 metres (1,411 ft), is on Hirta, immediately north of the village. In the southeast is Oiseval ('east fell'), which reaches 290 metres (951 ft), and Mullach M&lt;U+00F2&gt;r ('big hill summit') 361 metres (1,185 ft) is due west of Conachair. Ruival ('red fell') 137 metres (449 ft) and Mullach Bi ('pillar summit') 358 metres (1,192 ft) dominate the western cliffs. Boreray reaches 384 metres (1,260 ft) and Soay 378 metres (1,240 ft).<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> The extraordinary Stac an Armin reaches 196 metres (643 ft), and Stac Lee, 172 metres (564 ft), making them the highest <a href="sea_stack" title="wikilink">sea stacks</a> in Britain.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a><a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> <img src="Staclevenish.jpg" title="fig:Cliff face silhouette on Stac Levenish" alt="Cliff face silhouette on Stac Levenish" /> In modern times St Kilda's only settlement was at Village Bay (<a href="Scottish_Gaelic_language" title="wikilink">Scottish Gaelic</a>: <em>B&lt;U+00E0&gt;gh a' Bhaile</em> or <em>Loch Hiort</em>) on Hirta, although Gleann M&lt;U+00F2&gt;r on the north coast of Hirta and Boreray also contain the remains of earlier habitations.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> The sea approach to Hirta into Village Bay suggests a small settlement flanked by high rolling hills in a semi-circle behind it. This is misleading.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> The whole north face of Conachair is a vertical cliff up to 427 metres (1,400 ft) high,<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> falling sheer into the sea and constituting the highest sea cliff in the UK.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a></p>
<p>Indeed, the archipelago is the site of what many consider the most spectacular sea cliffs in the British Isles. Baxter and Crumley (1988) suggest that St Kilda: &quot;...is a mad, imperfect God's hoard of all unnecessary lavish landscape luxuries he ever devised in his madness. These he has scattered at random in Atlantic isolation 100 miles from the corrupting influences of the mainland, 40 miles west of the westmost Western Isles. He has kept for himself only the best pieces and woven around them a plot as evidence of his madness.&quot;<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a></p>
<p>Although 64 kilometres (40 mi) from the nearest land, St Kilda is visible from as far as the summit ridges of the <a href="Skye" class="uri" title="wikilink">Skye</a> <a href="Cuillin" class="uri" title="wikilink">Cuillin</a>, some 129 kilometres (80 mi) distant.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> The climate is oceanic with high levels of rainfall (1,400 mm or 55 in) and humidity. Temperatures are generally cool, averaging 5.6<a href="&lt;U+00B0&gt;C" class="uri" title="wikilink">&lt;U+00B0&gt;C</a> (42.1<a href="&lt;U+00B0&gt;F" class="uri" title="wikilink">&lt;U+00B0&gt;F</a>) in January and 11.8 &lt;U+00B0&gt;C (53.2 &lt;U+00B0&gt;F) in July. The prevailing winds, especially strong in winter, are southerly and southwesterly. Wind speeds average 13 <a href="kilometres_per_hour" title="wikilink">kilometres per hour</a> (8 <a href="mph" class="uri" title="wikilink">mph</a>) approximately 85 percent of the time and over 24 kilometres per hour (15 mph) more than 30 percent of the time. Gale force winds occur for under 2 percent of the time in any one year, but gusts of 185 kilometres per hour (115 mph) and more occur regularly on the high tops, and speeds of 209 kilometres per hour (130 mph) have occasionally been recorded near sea level.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> The tidal range is 2.9 metres (9.5 ft), and ocean swells of 5 metres (16.4 ft) frequently occur, which can make landings difficult or impossible at any time of year.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a><a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> However, the oceanic location protects the islands from snow, which lies for only about a dozen days per annum.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a></p>
<p>The archipelago's remote location and oceanic climate are matched in the UK only by a few smaller outlying islands such as the <a href="Flannan_Isles" title="wikilink">Flannan Isles</a>, <a href="North_Rona" title="wikilink">North Rona</a> and <a href="Sula_Sgeir" title="wikilink">Sula Sgeir</a>, and the <a href="Barra_Isles" title="wikilink">Bishop's Isles</a> at the southern edge of the Outer Hebrides. Administratively, St Kilda was part of the <a href="List_of_civil_parishes_in_Scotland" title="wikilink">parish</a> of <a href="Harris" class="uri" title="wikilink">Harris</a> in the traditional county of <a href="Invernesshire" class="uri" title="wikilink">Invernesshire</a>.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> Today it is incorporated in the <a href="Comhairle_nan_Eilean_Siar" title="wikilink">Comhairle nan Eilean Siar</a> (Western Isles) <a href="unitary_authority" title="wikilink">unitary authority</a>.</p>

<p><img src="Soaysheepkilda.jpg" title="fig:Soay ram on St Kilda" alt="Soay ram on St Kilda" /> St Kilda is a breeding ground for many important <a href="seabird" class="uri" title="wikilink">seabird</a> species including 30,000 pairs of <a href="Northern_Gannet" title="wikilink">Northern Gannets</a>; this is the world's largest colony, amounting to 24 percent of the global population.

<p>The predominant theme of life on St Kilda was isolation. When <a href="Martin_Martin" title="wikilink">Martin Martin</a> visited the islands in 1697,<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a> the only means of making the journey was by open longboat, which could take several days and nights of rowing and sailing across the open ocean and was all but impossible except in spring and summer. In all seasons, waves up to 12 metres (40 ft) high lash the beach of Village Bay, and even on calmer days landing on the slippery rocks can be hazardous. Cut off by distance and weather, the natives knew little of the rest of the world. After the <a href="Battle_of_Culloden" title="wikilink">Battle of Culloden</a> in 1746, it was rumoured that <a href="Prince_Charles_Edward_Stuart" title="wikilink">Prince Charles Edward Stuart</a> and some of his senior <a href="Jacobitism" title="wikilink">Jacobite</a> aides had escaped to St Kilda. An expedition was launched, and in due course British soldiers were ferried ashore to Hirta. They found a deserted village, as the St Kildans, fearing pirates, had fled to caves to the west. When the St Kildans were persuaded to come down, the soldiers discovered that the isolated natives knew nothing of the prince and had never heard of <a href="George_II_of_Great_Britain" title="wikilink">King George II</a> either.<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a></p>
<p>Even in the late 19th century, the islanders could communicate with the rest of the world only by lighting a bonfire on the summit of Conachair and hoping a passing ship might see it, or by using the &quot;St Kilda mailboat&quot;. The mailboat was the invention of <a href="John_Sands" title="wikilink">John Sands</a>, who visited in 1877. During his stay, a shipwreck left nine Austrian sailors marooned there, and by February supplies were running low. Sands attached a message to a lifebuoy salvaged from the <em>Peti Dubrovacki</em> and threw it into the sea.<a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a> Nine days later it was picked up on the <a href="Orkney" class="uri" title="wikilink">Orkney</a> island of <a href="Birsay" class="uri" title="wikilink">Birsay</a>, and a rescue was arranged. The St Kildans, building on this idea, fashioned a piece of wood into the shape of a boat and placed in it a small bottle or tin containing a message. Launched when the wind came from the northwest, two thirds of the messages were later found on the west coast of Scotland or, less conveniently, in <a href="Norway" class="uri" title="wikilink">Norway</a>.<a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a> <img src="Puffin1.jpg" title="fig:Atlantic Puffin (Fratercula arctica). Seabirds were the mainstay of the St Kildan diet." alt="Atlantic Puffin (Fratercula arctica). Seabirds were the mainstay of the St Kildan diet." /></p>
<p>Another significant feature of St Kildan life was the diet. The islanders kept sheep and a few cattle and were able to grow a limited amount of food crops such as <a href="barley" class="uri" title="wikilink">barley</a> and <a href="potatoes" class="uri" title="wikilink">potatoes</a> on the better drained land in Village Bay. <a href="Samuel_Johnson" title="wikilink">Samuel Johnson</a> reported that in the 18th century <a href="Domestic_sheep#As_food" title="wikilink">sheep's milk</a> was made &quot;into small cheeses&quot; by the St Kildans.<a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a> They eschewed fishing due to the heavy seas and unpredictable weather. The mainstay of their food supplies was the profusion of island birds, especially gannet and fulmar. These they harvested as eggs and young birds and ate both fresh and cured. Adult puffins were also caught by the use of <a href="fowling" class="uri" title="wikilink">fowling</a> rods.<a href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a> However, this feature of island life came at a price. When <a href="Henry_Brougham" title="wikilink">Henry Brougham</a> visited in 1799 he noted that &quot;the air is infected by a stench almost insupportable – a compound of rotten fish, filth of all sorts and stinking sea-fowl&quot;.<a href="#fn67" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a> An excavation of the <em>Taigh an t-Sithiche</em> (the 'house of the faeries' – see below) in 1877 by Sands unearthed the remains of gannet, sheep, cattle and limpets amidst various stone tools. The building is between 1,700 and 2,500 years old, which suggests that the St Kildan diet had changed little over the millennia. Indeed the tools were recognised by the St Kildans, who could put names to them as similar devices were still in use.<a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a></p>
<p>These fowling activities involved considerable skills in climbing, especially on the precipitous sea stacks. An important island tradition involved the 'Mistress Stone', a door-shaped opening in the rocks northwest of Ruival over-hanging a gully. Young men of the island had to undertake a ritual there to prove themselves on the crags and worthy of taking a wife. Martin Martin wrote: <img src="Mistress_Stone.jpg" title="fig:The Mistress Stone" alt="The Mistress Stone" /></p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the face of the rock, south from the town, is the famous stone, known by the name of the mistress-stone; it resembles a door exactly; and is in the very front of this rock, which is twenty or thirty fathom perpendicular in height, the figure of it being discernable about the distance of a mile; upon the lintel of this door, every bachelor-wooer is by an ancient custom obliged in honour to give a specimen of his affection for the love of his mistress, and it is thus; he is to stand on his left foot, having the one half of his sole over the rock, and then he draws the right foot further out to the left, and in this posture bowing, he puts both his fists further out to the right foot; and then after he has performed this, he has acquired no small reputation, being always after it accounted worthy of the finest mistress in the world: they firmly believe that this achievement is always attended with the desired success.</p>
<p>This being the custom of the place, one of the inhabitants very gravely desired me to let him know the time limited by me for trying of this piece of gallantry before I design&lt;U+2019&gt;d to leave the place, that he might attend me; I told him this performance would have a quite contrary effect upon me, by robbing me both of my life and mistress at the same moment.<a href="#fn69" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref69"><sup>69</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another important aspect of St Kildan life was the daily 'Parliament'. This was a meeting held in the street every morning after prayers and attended by all the adult males during the course of which they would decide upon the day's activities. No one led the meeting, and all had the right to speak. According to Steel (1988), &quot;Discussion frequently spread discord, but never in recorded history were feuds so bitter as to bring about a permanent division in the community&quot;.<a href="#fn70" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a></p>
<p>Whatever the privations, the St Kildans were fortunate in some respects, for their isolation spared them some of the evils of life elsewhere. Martin noted in 1697 that the citizens seemed &quot;happier than the generality of mankind as being almost the only people in the world who feel the sweetness of true liberty&quot;,<a href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a> and in the 19th century their health and well being was contrasted favourably with conditions elsewhere in the <a href="Hebrides" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hebrides</a>.<a href="#fn72" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref72"><sup>72</sup></a> Theirs was not a utopian society; the islanders had ingenious wooden locks for their property, and financial penalties were exacted for misdemeanours.<a href="#fn73" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref73"><sup>73</sup></a> Nonetheless, no resident St Kildan is known to have fought in a war, and in four centuries of history, no serious crime committed by an islander was recorded there.<a href="#fn74" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref74"><sup>74</sup></a></p>

<h3 id="prehistory">Prehistory</h3>
<p>It has been known for some time that St Kilda was continuously inhabited for two millennia or more, from the Bronze Age to the 20th century.<a href="#fn75" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref75"><sup>75</sup></a> Recently, the first direct evidence of earlier <a href="Neolithic" class="uri" title="wikilink">Neolithic</a> settlement emerged—shards of pottery of the 'Hebridean Ware' style, found to the east of the village. The subsequent discovery of a quarry for stone tools on Mullach Sgar above Village Bay led to finds of numerous stone hoe-blades, grinders and Skaill knives<a href="#fn76" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref76"><sup>76</sup></a> in the Village Bay <em>cleitan</em>—unique stone storage buildings (see below). These tools are also probably of Neolithic origin.<a href="#fn77" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref77"><sup>77</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="fourteenth-to-17th-century">Fourteenth to 17th century</h3>
<p>Little is known of the early history, and the first written record may date from 1202 when an Icelandic cleric wrote of taking shelter on &quot;the islands that are called Hirtir&quot;.<a href="#fn78" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref78"><sup>78</sup></a> Early reports mentioned finds of brooches, an iron sword and Danish coins, and the enduring Norse place names indicate a sustained Viking presence on Hirta, but the visible evidence has been lost.<a href="#fn79" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref79"><sup>79</sup></a> The first English language reference is from the late 14th century, when <a href="John_of_Fordun" title="wikilink">John of Fordun</a> mentioned 'the isle of Irte, which is agreed to be under the Circius and on the margins of the world'.<a href="#fn80" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref80"><sup>80</sup></a> The islands were historically part of the domain of the <a href="Clan_MacLeod" title="wikilink">MacLeods</a> of <a href="Harris" class="uri" title="wikilink">Harris</a>, whose steward was responsible for the collection of rents in kind and other duties. The first detailed report of a visit to the islands dates from 1549, when Donald Munro suggested that: &quot;The inhabitants thereof ar simple poor people, scarce learnit in aney religion, but M&lt;U+2019&gt;Cloyd of Herray, his stewart, or he quhom he deputs in sic offfice, sailes anes in the zear ther at midsummer, with some chaplaine to baptize bairnes ther.&quot;<a href="#fn81" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref81"><sup>81</sup></a></p>
<p>The chaplain's best efforts notwithstanding, the islanders' isolation and dependence on the bounty of the natural world meant their philosophy bore as much relationship to <a href="Druidism" class="uri" title="wikilink">Druidism</a> as it did to <a href="Christianity" class="uri" title="wikilink">Christianity</a><a href="#fn82" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref82"><sup>82</sup></a> until the arrival of Rev John MacDonald in 1822. Macauley (1764) reported the existence of five druidic altars including a large circle of stones fixed perpendicularly in the ground near the Stallir House on <a href="Boreray,_St_Kilda" title="wikilink">Boreray</a>.<a href="#fn83" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref83"><sup>83</sup></a></p>
<p>Coll MacDonald of <a href="Colonsay" class="uri" title="wikilink">Colonsay</a> raided Hirta in 1615, removing 30 sheep and a quantity of barley.<a href="#fn84" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref84"><sup>84</sup></a> The islands developed a reputation for abundance. At the time of Martin's visit in 1697 the population was 180 and the steward travelled with a &quot;company&quot; of up to 60 persons to which he: &quot;elected the most &quot;meagre&quot; among his friends in the neighbouring islands, to that number and took them periodically to St. Kilda to enjoy the nourishing and plentiful, if primitive, fare of the island, and so be restored to their wonted health and strength.&quot;<a href="#fn85" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref85"><sup>85</sup></a></p>

<p>However, visiting ships in the 18th century brought <a href="cholera" class="uri" title="wikilink">cholera</a> and <a href="smallpox" class="uri" title="wikilink">smallpox</a><a href="#fn86" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref86"><sup>86</sup></a>. In 1727 the loss of life was so high that too few residents remained to man the boats, and new families were brought in from <a href="Harris" class="uri" title="wikilink">Harris</a> to replace them.<a href="#fn87" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref87"><sup>87</sup></a> By 1758 the population had risen to 88 and reached just under 100 by the end of the century. This figure remained fairly constant from the 18th century until 1851, when 36 islanders emigrated to <a href="Australia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Australia</a> on board the <em>Priscilla</em>, a loss from which the island never fully recovered. The emigration was in part a response to the laird's closure of the church and manse for several years during the <a href="Disruption_of_1843" title="wikilink">Disruption</a> that created the <a href="Free_Church_of_Scotland_(1843&amp;ndash;1900)" title="wikilink">Free Church of Scotland</a>.<a href="#fn88" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref88"><sup>88</sup></a><a href="#fn89" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref89"><sup>89</sup></a></p>
<p>One factor in the decline was thus the influence of religion. A missionary called Alexander Buchan came to St Kilda in 1705, but despite his long stay, the idea of organised religion did not take hold. This changed when Rev John MacDonald, the 'Apostle of the North', arrived in 1822. He set about his mission with zeal, preaching 13 lengthy sermons during his first 11 days. He returned regularly and fundraised on behalf of the St Kildans, although privately he was appalled by their lack of religious knowledge. The islanders took to him with enthusiasm and wept when he left for the last time eight years later. His successor, who arrived on <a href="3_July" title="wikilink">3 July</a> <a href="1830" class="uri" title="wikilink">1830</a>, was Rev Neil Mackenzie, a resident <a href="Church_of_Scotland" title="wikilink">Church of Scotland</a> minister who greatly improved the conditions of the inhabitants. He reorganised island agriculture, was instrumental in the rebuilding of the village (see below) and supervised the building of a new church and manse. With help from the Gaelic School Society, MacKenzie and his wife introduced formal education to Hirta, beginning a daily school to teach reading, writing and arithmetic and a <a href="Sunday_school" title="wikilink">Sunday school</a> for religious education.<a href="#fn90" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref90"><sup>90</sup></a></p>
<p>Mackenzie left in 1844, and although he had achieved a great deal, the weakness of the St Kildans' dependence on external authority was exposed in 1865 with the arrival of Rev John Mackay. Despite their fondness for Mackenzie, who stayed in the <a href="Church_of_Scotland" title="wikilink">Church of Scotland</a>, the St Kildans 'came out' in favour of the new Free Church during the Disruption. Unfortunately, Mackay, the new Free Church minister, was a religious zealot who may have done more than anyone to destroy the St Kildan way of life. He introduced a routine of three two- to three-hour services on Sunday at which attendance was effectively compulsory. One visitor noted in 1875 that: &quot;The Sabbath was a day of intolerable gloom. At the clink of the bell the whole flock hurry to Church with sorrowful looks and eyes bent upon the ground. It is considered sinful to look to the right or to the left.&quot;<a href="#fn91" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref91"><sup>91</sup></a> <img src="Insidestkildachurch.jpg" title="fig:The interior of the church at Oiseabhal, St Kilda" alt="The interior of the church at Oiseabhal, St Kilda" /></p>
<p>Time spent in religious gatherings interfered seriously with the practical routines of the island. Old ladies and children who made noise in church were lectured at length and warned of dire punishments in the afterworld. During a period of food shortages on the island, a relief vessel arrived on a Saturday, but the minister said that the islanders had to spend the day preparing for church on the Sabbath, and it was Monday before supplies were landed. Children were forbidden to play games and required to carry a Bible wherever they went. The St Kildans endured Mackay for 24 years.<a href="#fn92" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref92"><sup>92</sup></a></p>
<p>Tourism had a different but similarly destabilising impact on St Kilda. During the 19th century, steamers began to visit Hirta, enabling the islanders to earn money from the sale of <a href="Tweed_(cloth)" title="wikilink">tweeds</a> and birds' eggs but at the expense of their self-esteem as the tourists regarded them as curiosities.<a href="#fn93" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref93"><sup>93</sup></a> The boats brought other previously unknown diseases, especially <em><a href="tetanus" title="wikilink">tetanus infantum</a></em>, which resulted in infant mortality rates as high as 80 percent during the late 19th century.<a href="#fn94" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref94"><sup>94</sup></a> The <em>cnatan na gall</em> or boat-cough, an illness that struck after the arrival of a ship to Hirta, became a regular feature of life.<a href="#fn95" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref95"><sup>95</sup></a><a href="#fn96" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref96"><sup>96</sup></a></p>
<p>By the turn of the 20th century, formal schooling had become a feature of the islands, and in 1906 the church was extended to make a schoolhouse. The children all now learned English and their native Gaelic. Improved <a href="midwifery" class="uri" title="wikilink">midwifery</a> skills, denied to the island by Reverend Mackay, reduced the problems of childhood tetanus. From the 1880s, <a href="trawler" title="wikilink">trawlers</a> fishing the north Atlantic made regular visits, bringing additional trade. Talk of an evacuation occurred in 1875 during MacKay's period of tenure, but despite occasional food shortages and a flu epidemic in 1913, the population was stable at between 75 and 80, and no obvious sign existed that within a few years the millennia-old occupation of the island was to end.<a href="#fn97" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref97"><sup>97</sup></a><a href="#fn98" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref98"><sup>98</sup></a><a href="#fn99" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref99"><sup>99</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="world-war-i">World War I</h3>
<p>Early in the <a href="Great_War" title="wikilink">Great War</a> the <a href="Royal_Navy" title="wikilink">Royal Navy</a> erected a signal station on Hirta, and daily communications with the mainland were established for the first time in St Kilda's history. In a belated response a German submarine arrived in Village Bay on the morning of <a href="15_May" title="wikilink">15 May</a> <a href="1918" class="uri" title="wikilink">1918</a>, and, after issuing a warning, started shelling the island. Seventy two shells were fired, and the wireless station was destroyed. The manse, church and jetty storehouse were damaged, but no loss of life occurred.<a href="#fn100" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref100"><sup>100</sup></a> One eye-witness recalled: &quot;It wasn't what you would call a bad submarine because it could have blowed every house down because they were all in a row there. He only wanted Admiralty property. One lamb was killed&lt;U+2026&gt; all the cattle ran from one side of the island to the other when they heard the shots.&quot;<a href="#fn101" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref101"><sup>101</sup></a></p>
<p>As a result of this attack, a <a href="QF_4.5_inch_naval_gun" title="wikilink">Mark III QF gun</a> was erected on a promontory overlooking Village Bay, but it never saw military use. Of greater long-term significance to the islanders were the introduction of regular contact with the outside world and the slow development of a money-based economy. This made life easier for the St Kildans but also made them less self-reliant. Both were factors in the evacuation of the island little more than a decade later.<a href="#fn102" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref102"><sup>102</sup></a></p>

The islands had existed for centuries in relative isolation until tourism and the presence of the military in World War I induced the islanders to seek alternatives to privations they routinely suffered. Despite construction of a small jetty in 1902, the islands remained at the weather's mercy.<a href="#fn103" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref103"><sup>103</sup></a> The authorities were unable (or unwilling) to do much to assist them, although reliable radios and other infrastructure denied to the civilian islanders were later provided for the military base at a cost of millions of pounds.<a href="#fn104" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref104"><sup>104</sup></a></p>
<p>After World War I most of the young men left the island, and the population fell from 73 in 1920 to 37 in 1928.<a href="#fn105" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref105"><sup>105</sup></a> After the death of four men from <a href="influenza" class="uri" title="wikilink">influenza</a> in 1926 and a succession of crop failures in the 1920s, the last straw came with the death from <a href="appendicitis" class="uri" title="wikilink">appendicitis</a> of a young woman, Mary Gillies, in January 1930. On <a href="29_August" title="wikilink">29 August</a> <a href="1930" class="uri" title="wikilink">1930</a>, the last 36 inhabitants were evacuated to <a href="Morvern" class="uri" title="wikilink">Morvern</a> on the Scottish mainland at their own request.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The morning of the evacuation promised a perfect day. The sun rose out of a calm and sparkling sea and warmed the impressive cliffs of Oiseval&lt;U+2026&gt;. Observing tradition the islanders left an open Bible and a small pile of oats in each house, locked all the doors and at 7 a.m. boarded the <em>Harebell</em>&lt;U+2026&gt; They were reported to have stayed cheerful throughout the operation. But as the long antler of Dun fell back onto the horizon and the familiar outline of the island grew faint, the severing of an ancient tie became a reality and the St Kildans gave way to tears.<a href="#fn106" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref106"><sup>106</sup></a></p>

<p>On his death on <a href="14_August" title="wikilink">14 August</a> <a href="1956" class="uri" title="wikilink">1956</a>, the Marquess of Bute's will bequeathed the archipelago to the <a href="National_Trust_for_Scotland" title="wikilink">National Trust for Scotland</a> provided they accepted the offer within six months. After much soul-searching, the Executive Committee agreed to do so in January 1957. The slow renovation and conservation of the village began, much of it undertaken by summer volunteer work parties.<a href="#fn114" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref114"><sup>114</sup></a> In addition, scientific research began on the feral Soay sheep population and other aspects of the natural environment.

<p><img src="St_Kilda.jpg" title="fig:Ruins in Gleann M&lt;U+00F2&gt;r" alt="Ruins in Gleann M&lt;U+00F2&gt;r" />The oldest structures on St Kilda are the most enigmatic. Large <a href="sheepfold" title="wikilink">sheepfolds</a> lie inland from the existing village at <em>An Lag Bho'n Tuath</em> (English: the hollow in the north) and contain curious 'boat-shaped' stone rings, or 'settings'. Soil samples suggest a date of 1850 BC, but they are unique to St Kilda, and their purpose is unknown. In Gleann M&lt;U+00F2&gt;r, (north west of Village Bay beyond Hirta's central ridge), there are 20 'horned structures', essentially ruined buildings with a main court measuring about 3 x 3 m (10 ft by 10 ft), two or more smaller cells and a forecourt formed by two curved or horn-shaped walls. Again, nothing like them exists anywhere else in Britain or Europe, and their original use is unknown.<a href="#fn125" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref125"><sup>125</sup></a><a href="#fn126" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref126"><sup>126</sup></a> Also in Gleann M&lt;U+00F2&gt;r is <em>Taigh na Bana-ghaisgich</em>, the 'Amazon's House'. As Martin (1703) reported, many St Kilda tales are told about this female warrior.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This Amazon is famous in their traditions: her house or dairy of stone is yet extant; some of the inhabitants dwell in it all summer, though it be some hundred years old; the whole is built of stone, without any wood, lime, earth, or mortar to cement it, and is built in form of a circle pyramid-wise towards the top, having a vent in it, the fire being always in the centre of the floor; the stones are long and thin, which supplies the defect of wood; the body of this house contains not above nine persons sitting; there are three beds or low vaults that go off the side of the wall, a pillar betwixt each bed, which contains five men apiece; at the entry to one of these low vaults is a stone standing upon one end fix&lt;U+2019&gt;d; upon this they say she ordinarily laid her helmet; there are two stones on the other side, upon which she is reported to have laid her sword: she is said to have been much addicted to hunting, and that in her time all the space betwixt this isle and that of Harries, was one continued tract of dry land.<a href="#fn127" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref127"><sup>127</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Similar stories of a female warrior who hunted the now submerged land between the Outer Hebrides and St Kilda are reported from <a href="Harris" class="uri" title="wikilink">Harris</a>.<a href="#fn128" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref128"><sup>128</sup></a> The structure's forecourt is akin to the other 'horned structures' in the immediate area, but like Martin's &quot;Amazon&quot; its original purpose is the stuff of legend rather than archaeological fact.</p>
<p>Much more is known of the unique <em>cleitean</em> that decorate the archipelago in their hundreds. They are dome-shaped structures constructed of flat boulders with a cap of turf on the top. This enables the wind to pass through the cavities in the wall but keeps the rain out. They were used for storing peat, nets, <a href="Corn_(disambiguation)" title="wikilink">corn</a>, preserved flesh and eggs, manure, hay and even used as a shelter for lambs in winter. The date of origin of this St Kildan invention is unknown, but they were in continuous use from prehistoric times until the 1930 evacuation. More than 1,200 ruined or intact <em>cleitan</em> remain on Hirta and a further 170 on the neighbouring islands.<a href="#fn129" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref129"><sup>129</sup></a><a href="#fn130" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref130"><sup>130</sup></a> House no. 16 in the modern village has an early Christian stone cross built into the front wall, which may date from the 7th century.<a href="#fn131" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref131"><sup>131</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="medieval-village">Medieval village</h3>
<p><img src="St_Kilda_village.jpg" title="fig:The Village. The Head Wall surrounds the site, with Tobar Childa top left, the 19th century Street at centre and the new military base to the right." alt="The Village. The Head Wall surrounds the site, with Tobar Childa top left, the 19th century Street at centre and the new military base to the right." /> A medieval village lay near Tobar Childa, about 350 metres (400 yards) from the shore, at the foot of the slopes of Connachair. The oldest building is an underground passage with two small annexes called <em>Taigh an t-Sithiche</em> (house of the faeries) which dates to between 500 BC and 300 AD. The St Kildans believed it was a house or hiding place, although a more recent theory suggests that it was an <a href="ice_house" title="wikilink">ice house</a>.<a href="#fn132" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref132"><sup>132</sup></a></p>
<p>Extensive ruins of field walls and <em>cleitan</em> and the remnants of a <a href="medieval" class="uri" title="wikilink">medieval</a> 'house' with a beehive-shaped annex remain. Nearby is the 'Bull's House', a roofless rectangular structure in which the island's bull was kept during winter. Tobar Childa itself is supplied by two springs that lie just outside the Head Wall that was constructed around the Village to prevent sheep and cattle gaining access to the cultivated areas within its boundary.<a href="#fn133" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref133"><sup>133</sup></a> There were 25 to 30 houses altogether. Most were <a href="black_house" title="wikilink">black houses</a> of typical Hebridean design, but some older buildings were made of corbelled stone and turfed rather than thatched. The turf was used to prevent ingress of wind and rain, and the older 'beehive' buildings resembled green hillocks rather than dwellings.<a href="#fn134" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref134"><sup>134</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="recent-structures">Recent structures</h3>
<p>The Head Wall was built in 1834 when the medieval village was abandoned and a new one planned between Tobar Childa and the sea some 200 metres (700 ft) down the slope. This came about as the result of a visit by Sir Thomas Dyke Ackland, the <a href="Member_of_Parliament" title="wikilink">MP</a> for <a href="Devon" class="uri" title="wikilink">Devon</a>. Appalled by the primitive conditions, he made a donation that led to the construction of a completely new settlement of 30 new black houses. These were further modified after several of the new dwellings were damaged by a severe gale in October 1860. Sixteen modern houses were then constructed amidst the blackhouses and a new <a href="Factor_(Scotland)" title="wikilink">Factor's</a> house as well.</p>
<p>These houses were made of dry stone, had thick walls and were roofed with turf. Each typically had only one tiny window and a small aperture for letting out smoke from the peat fire that burnt in the middle of the room. As a result, the interiors were blackened by soot. The cattle occupied one end of the house in winter, and once a year the straw from the floor was stripped out and spread on the ground.<a href="#fn135" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref135"><sup>135</sup></a> <img src="Featherstorestkilda.jpg" title="fig:The Feather Store, where fulmar and gannet feathers were kept, and sold to pay the rent" alt="The Feather Store, where fulmar and gannet feathers were kept, and sold to pay the rent" /> One of the more poignant ruins on Hirta is the site of 'Lady Grange's House'. Lady Grange had been married to the <a href="Jacobitism" title="wikilink">Jacobite</a> sympathiser <a href="James_Erskine,_Lord_Grange" title="wikilink">James Erskine of Grange</a> for 25 years when he decided that she might have overheard too many of his treasonable plottings. He had her kidnapped and secretly confined in <a href="Edinburgh" class="uri" title="wikilink">Edinburgh</a> for six months. From there she was sent to the <a href="Monach_Isles" title="wikilink">Monach Isles</a>, where she lived in isolation for two years whilst he maintained that she had died and arranged her funeral. She was then taken to Hirta from 1734 to 1742, which she described as a &quot;a vile neasty, stinking poor isle&quot;. After a failed rescue attempt, she was removed by Erskine to the <a href="Isle_of_Skye" title="wikilink">Isle of Skye</a>, where she died. The 'house' is a large cleit in the Village meadows.<a href="#fn136" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref136"><sup>136</sup></a><a href="#fn137" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref137"><sup>137</sup></a><a href="#fn138" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref138"><sup>138</sup></a><a href="#fn139" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref139"><sup>139</sup></a></p>
<p><a href="James_Boswell" title="wikilink">Boswell</a> and <a href="Samuel_Johnson" title="wikilink">Johnson</a> discussed the subject during their 1773 tour of the Hebrides. Boswell wrote: &quot;After dinner to-day, we talked of the extraordinary fact of Lady Grange&lt;U+2019&gt;s being sent to St Kilda, and confined there for several years, without any means of relief. Dr Johnson said, if M&lt;U+2019&gt;Leod would let it be known that he had such a place for naughty ladies, he might make it a very profitable island.&quot;<a href="#fn140" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref140"><sup>140</sup></a></p>
<p><img src="Notquiteheathrow.jpg" title="fig:This &#39;International Sea &amp; Airport Lounge&#39; is situated adjacent to the helipad and landing craft slipway." alt="This &#39;International Sea &amp; Airport Lounge&#39; is situated adjacent to the helipad and landing craft slipway." width="200" /> In the 1860s unsuccessful attempts were made to improve the landing area by blasting rocks. A small jetty was erected in 1877, but it was washed away in a storm two years later. In 1883 representations to the <a href="Napier_Commission" title="wikilink">Napier Commission</a> suggested the building of a replacement, but it was 1901 before the <a href="Congested_Districts_Board_(Scotland)" title="wikilink">Congested Districts Board</a> provided an engineer to enable one to be completed the following year. Nearby on the shore line are some huge boulders which were known throughout the <a href="Highlands_and_Islands" title="wikilink">Highlands and Islands</a> in the 19th century as <em>Doirneagan Hirt</em>, Hirta's pebbles.<a href="#fn141" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref141"><sup>141</sup></a><a href="#fn142" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref142"><sup>142</sup></a></p>
<p>At one time, three churches stood on Hirta. Christ Church, in the site of the graveyard at the centre of the Village, was in use in 1697 and was the largest, but this thatched-roof structure was too small to hold the entire population, and most of the congregation had to gather in the churchyard during services. St Brendan's Church lay over a kilometre away on the slopes of Ruival, and St Columba's at the west end of the Village street, but little is left of these buildings. A new <a href="kirk" class="uri" title="wikilink">kirk</a> and <a href="rectory" title="wikilink">manse</a> were erected at the east end of the village in 1830 and a <a href="Factor_(Scotland)" title="wikilink">Factor's</a> house in 1860.<a href="#fn143" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref143"><sup>143</sup></a><a href="#fn144" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref144"><sup>144</sup></a></p>

<p>Soay has a primitive hut known as <em>Taigh Dugan</em> (Dugan's house). This is little more than an excavated hole under a huge stone with two rude walls on the sides. The story of its creation relates to two sheep-stealing brothers from <a href="Lewis" class="uri" title="wikilink">Lewis</a> who came to St Kilda only to cause further trouble. Dugan was exiled to Soay, where he died; the other, called Fearchar M&lt;U+00F2&gt;r, was sent to Stac an Armin, where he found life so intolerable he cast himself into the sea.</p>
<p>Boreray boasts the <em>Cleitean MacPh&lt;U+00E0&gt;idein</em>, a 'cleit village' of three small bothies used on a regular basis during fowling expeditions. Here too are the ruins of <em>Taigh Stallar</em> (the steward's house), which was similar to the Amazon's house in Gleann M&lt;U+00F2&gt;r although somewhat larger, and which had six bed spaces. The local tradition was that it was built by the 'Man of the Rocks', who led a rebellion against the landlord's steward.<a href="#fn146" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref146"><sup>146</sup></a> It may be an example of an <a href="Iron_Age" title="wikilink">Iron Age</a> <a href="Atlantic_roundhouse" title="wikilink">wheelhouse</a>.<a href="#fn147" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref147"><sup>147</sup></a></p>

<li id="fn18">However, Martin (1703) states: &quot;all seamen call it St. Kilda; and in sea maps St. Kilder, particularly in a Dutch sea map from Ireland to Zeland, published at Amsterdam by Peter Goas in the year, 1663&quot;. This is nearly a century after the publication of Waghenaer's charts, but it is unclear whether his misspelling led to a common spoken usage or the spoken version has a quite different origin. In a later passage concerning the traditions relating to the <a href="Flannan_Isles" title="wikilink">Flannan Isles</a>, Martin adds &quot;It is absolutely unlawful to call the island of St Kilda (which lies thirty leagues southward) by its proper Irish name Hirt, but only the high country&quot;.
