<p><img src="Francis_of_Assisi.jpg" title="fig:100|right|Francis of Assisi, an early stigmatic." alt="100|right|Francis of Assisi, an early stigmatic." /> <strong>Stigmata</strong> are bodily marks, sores, or sensations of pain in locations corresponding to the <a href="crucifixion" class="uri" title="wikilink">crucifixion</a> wounds of <a href="Jesus_Christ" title="wikilink">Jesus Christ</a>. An individual bearing stigmata is referred to as a <strong>stigmatic</strong>.</p>
<p>The causes of stigmata are the subject of considerable debate. Some contend that they are <a href="miracle" title="wikilink">miraculous</a>, while others argue they are <a href="Hoax" title="wikilink">hoaxes</a> or can be explained medically.</p>
<p>Stigmata are primarily associated with the <a href="Roman_Catholic" title="wikilink">Roman Catholic</a> faith. Many reported stigmatics are members of Catholic religious orders. The majority of reported stigmatics are female.<a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14294b.htm">1</a></p>
<h2 id="description">Description</h2>
<p><img src="Receiving_stigmata.jpg" title="fig:A depiction of St Francis receiving the Stigmata, by Cigoli. Like other depictions of the event, rays of light are seen emanating from the Heavens to pierce St Francis&#39;s hands" alt="A depiction of St Francis receiving the Stigmata, by Cigoli. Like other depictions of the event, rays of light are seen emanating from the Heavens to pierce St Francis&#39;s hands" width="300" /> Reported cases of stigmata take various forms. Many show some or all of the five <a href="Holy_Wounds" title="wikilink">Holy Wounds</a> that were, according to the <a href="Bible" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bible</a>, inflicted on Jesus during his crucifixion: wounds in the hands and feet, from nails, and in the side, from a <a href="Spear_of_Destiny" title="wikilink">lance</a>. Some stigmatics display wounds to the forehead similar to those caused by the <a href="crown_of_thorns" title="wikilink">crown of thorns</a>. Other reported forms include tears of blood or sweating blood, wounds to the back as from <a href="scourging" class="uri" title="wikilink">scourging</a>, or wounds to the shoulder as from bearing the cross.</p>
<p>Some stigmatics feel the pain of wounds with no external marks; these are referred to as <em>invisible stigmata</em>. In other cases, stigmata are accompanied by extreme pain. Some stigmatics' wounds do not appear to clot and stay fresh and uninfected. The blood from the wounds is said, in some cases, to have a pleasant, perfumed odor.</p>
<p>Cases of stigmata have been reported at different ages for different stigmatics. Some have manifested stigmata continually after the first appearance; others have shown periodic stigmata that re-occur at certain times of the day or on certain, sometimes holy, days through out the year.</p>
<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<p>The first reported cases of stigmata, in a Flemish nun and a young Englishman, occurred in the early 13th century. The first well-documented case, and the first to be accepted by Roman Catholic authorities as authentic, was that of <a href="Francis_of_Assisi" title="wikilink">Saint Francis of Assisi</a> (<a href="1182" class="uri" title="wikilink">1182</a>–<a href="1226" class="uri" title="wikilink">1226</a>), who first experienced stigmata in La Verna, Italy, in <a href="1224" class="uri" title="wikilink">1224</a> <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06221a.htm">2</a>.</p>
<p>In the century after St. Francis's death, more than twenty additional cases of stigmata were reported. Stigmata have continued to be reported since, with over three hundred cases by the end of the 19th century <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14294b.htm">3</a>. In the 20th century, the number of cases increased dramatically; over 500 cases have now been recorded. In modern times, increasing numbers of ordinary people – rather than mystics or members of religious orders – began to report stigmata. Cases were also reported among non-Catholic Christians <a href="http://www.livingmiracles.net/Stigmata.html">4</a>.</p>
<p>The first written record of a woman to have received stigmata is the Mediaeval <a href="Codex_Iuliacensis" title="wikilink">Codex Iuliacensis</a>, ca. 1320-1350, reporting the stigmata of <a href="Beatification" title="wikilink">Blessed</a> <a href="Christina_von_Stommeln" title="wikilink">Christina von Stommeln</a>, or Christina Bruso (died 1312), whose relics rest in the Propsteikirche in <a href="J&lt;U+00FC&gt;lich" class="uri" title="wikilink">J&lt;U+00FC&gt;lich</a>, near <a href="Aachen" class="uri" title="wikilink">Aachen</a> <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03724a.htm">5</a>. It is claimed that one can still see marks from the crown of thorns on her skull, which is publicly displayed annually during the octave beginning 6th November.</p>

<h2 id="skepticism">Skepticism</h2>
<p>There have been historical stigmatics that were known to have faked wounds, such as <a href="Magdalena_de_la_Cruz" title="wikilink">Magdalena de la Cruz</a> (<a href="1487" class="uri" title="wikilink">1487</a>–<a href="1560" class="uri" title="wikilink">1560</a>), who admitted the fraud.</p>
<p>Similarly self-inflicted wounds can be associated with certain <a href="mental_illness" title="wikilink">mental illnesses</a>. Some people who fake stigmata suffer from <a href="Munchausen_syndrome" title="wikilink">Munchausen syndrome</a> which is characterised by an intense desire for attention. People with Munchausen hurt themselves or fake an illness hoping to end up in a hospital where they can be given attention and care.</p>
<p>People also fake stigmata knowing that some who had stigmata were declared <a href="holy" class="uri" title="wikilink">holy</a> by the <a href="Pope" class="uri" title="wikilink">Pope</a>. In this way they try to gain recognition.</p>
<p>Skeptics also point out that stigmata have appeared on hands in some cases, wrists in others, and the lance wound has appeared on different sides of the body. This suggests some form of internally generated phenomena, based on the victim's own imagination and subjective in character, rather than something of external divine origin. It is unknown, either through the gospels or other historical accounts, whether <a href="crucifixion" class="uri" title="wikilink">crucifixion</a> involved nails being driven through the hands, or wrists, or what side the lance pierced Christ's body, and this would appear to be reflected in the inconsistent placement of stigmatists' wounds.</p>
<p>It should be noted however, that many stigmatics have wounds piercing the palms of their hands as is common in our conception of Christ hanging on the cross and is visible in much of Christian imagery. However, it would have been impossible for Jesus to have been suspended on the cross by his hands - it would have been a physcial impossibilty for the hands to support the entire weight of the body without breaking through the fragile bones in the human hand. In actuality, Christ's arms would have to have been nailed to the cross by his wrists in order to be able to support the weight. In fact, it has been proven in several studies that the hands would be unable to support the necessary weight, so many advocate the wrist theory; traditional art, however, often presents the opposite view. A new study and documentary called &quot;Quest for Truth: The Crucifixion&quot; on the National Geographic Channel have shown that a person can be suspended by the wrists, as the ankles are nailed to the side of the cross producing little strain on the wrists. However, the study also claims the palms are a likely place for the nails to be driven, as it would cause the maximum amount of pain and trauma, and the victim would be tied to the cross to support the weight. <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/7291066/#storyContinued">6</a></p>
<p>Similarly, no case of stigmata is known to have occurred before the thirteenth century, when the crucified <a href="Jesus" class="uri" title="wikilink">Jesus</a> became a standard icon of <a href="Christianity" class="uri" title="wikilink">Christianity</a> in the west.<a href="http://skepdic.com/stigmata.html">7</a>.</p>
<p>Some believe that the condition can be explained by 'frontier science' such as with the unexplained phenomena of the mind exerting physical effects on the body. There have been claims that non-religious people under deep hypnosis, when told that they had a crown of thorns on their heads cutting into their flesh (in the manner similar to Christ), have had bleeding welts appear on their foreheads even when nothing had come into contact with the skin. Thus if this is true, the effects have been inflicted by the mind onto the body. Other accounts of this strong mind-body connection have been observed and documented in experiments such as the case in which heart disease patients were administered a placebo pill, but told that it was a new 'super-medicine', and their conditions noticeably improved. It is thought by some that the deep trance-like state which deeply religious people claim to go into mimics this type of hypnosis, and the extremely strong and vivid impressions of the wounds and suffering are somehow transmitted from the mind to the body. This also fits with the fact that stigmata was first observed at around the time when graphic detail of the crucifixion started to appear in Christian art, making the wounds and suffering easier to comprehend and imagine in the minds of observers of the art.</p>
<h2 id="psychosomatic-explanation">Psychosomatic explanation</h2>
<p>In his paper <em>Hospitality and Pain</em>, iconoclastic Christian theologian <a href="Ivan_Illich" title="wikilink">Ivan Illich</a> touches on the phenomenon of stigmata with characteristic terseness: &quot;Compassion with Christ... is faith so strong and so deeply incarnate that it leads to the individual embodiment of the contemplated pain.&quot; His thesis is that stigmata result from exceptional poignancy of religious faith and desire to associate oneself with the suffering Messiah.</p>
