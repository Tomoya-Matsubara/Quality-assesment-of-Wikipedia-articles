<p>The <strong>meteorological history of Hurricane Wilma</strong>, the most intense known <a href="tropical_cyclone" title="wikilink">tropical cyclone</a> in the <a href="Western_Hemisphere" title="wikilink">Western Hemisphere</a>, began in the second week of October 2005. A large area of disturbed weather developed across much of the <a href="Caribbean_Sea" title="wikilink">Caribbean Sea</a> and gradually organized to the southeast of <a href="Jamaica" class="uri" title="wikilink">Jamaica</a>. By late on <a href="October_15" title="wikilink">October 15</a>, the system was sufficiently organized for the <a href="National_Hurricane_Center" title="wikilink">National Hurricane Center</a> to designate it as <a href="Tropical_depression" title="wikilink">Tropical Depression</a> Twenty-Four.</p>
<p>The depression drifted southwestward, and under favorable conditions, it <a href="tropical_cyclogenesis" title="wikilink">strengthened</a> into <a href="Tropical_Storm" title="wikilink">Tropical Storm</a> <em><a href="Wilma" class="uri" title="wikilink">Wilma</a></em> on <a href="October_17" title="wikilink">October 17</a>. Initially, development was slow due to its large size, though <a href="convection#Atmospheric_convection" title="wikilink">convection</a> steadily organized. From <a href="October_18" title="wikilink">October 18</a>, and through the following day, Wilma underwent <a href="rapid_deepening" title="wikilink">explosive deepening</a> over the open waters of the Caribbean; in a 30-hour period, the system's central <a href="atmospheric_pressure" title="wikilink">atmospheric pressure</a> dropped from 982 <a href="bar_(unit)" title="wikilink">mbar</a> (29.00 <a href="inch_of_mercury" title="wikilink">inHg</a>) to the record-low value of 882 mbar (26.05 inHg), while the winds increased to 185 mph (295 km/h). At its peak intensity, the <a href="eye_(cyclone)" title="wikilink">pinhole eye</a> of Wilma was about 3 miles (5 km) in diameter, the smallest known eye in an <a href="Atlantic_hurricane" title="wikilink">Atlantic hurricane</a>. After the inner eye dissipated due to an <a href="eyewall_replacement_cycle" title="wikilink">eyewall replacement cycle</a>, Wilma weakened to <a href="Saffir-Simpson_Hurricane_Scale" title="wikilink">Category 4 status</a>, and on <a href="October_21" title="wikilink">October 21</a>, it made <a href="landfall_(meteorology)" title="wikilink">landfall</a> on <a href="Cozumel" class="uri" title="wikilink">Cozumel</a> and on the <a href="Mexico" title="wikilink">Mexican mainland</a> with winds of about 150 mph (240 km/h).</p>
<p>Wilma weakened over the <a href="Yucat&lt;U+00E1&gt;n_Peninsula" title="wikilink">Yucat&lt;U+00E1&gt;n Peninsula</a>, and reached the southern <a href="Gulf_of_Mexico" title="wikilink">Gulf of Mexico</a> before accelerating northeastward. Despite increasing amounts of <a href="wind_shear" title="wikilink">wind shear</a>, the hurricane re-strengthened to hit <a href="Cape_Romano" title="wikilink">Cape Romano</a>, <a href="Florida" class="uri" title="wikilink">Florida</a> as a major hurricane. Wilma weakened as it quickly crossed the state, and entered the <a href="Atlantic_Ocean" title="wikilink">Atlantic Ocean</a> near <a href="Jupiter,_Florida" title="wikilink">Jupiter, Florida</a>. The hurricane again re-intensified before cold air and wind shear penetrated the inner core of convection. On <a href="October_26" title="wikilink">October 26</a>, it transitioned into an <a href="extratropical_cyclone" title="wikilink">extratropical cyclone</a>, and the next day, the remnants of Wilma were absorbed by another extratropical storm over <a href="Atlantic_Canada" title="wikilink">Atlantic Canada</a>.</p>

<p><img src="TD_24_16_oct_2005_1605Z.jpg" title="fig:Tropical Depression Twenty-Four on October 16" alt="Tropical Depression Twenty-Four on October 16" /> The origin of Hurricane Wilma is complicated. During the second week of October, an unusually large, <a href="monsoon_trough" title="wikilink">monsoon</a>-like lower-level circulation and a broad area of disturbed weather developed over much of the <a href="Caribbean_Sea" title="wikilink">Caribbean Sea</a>. The system was enhanced by <a href="diffluence" class="uri" title="wikilink">diffluence</a>&lt;U+2014&gt;the rate at which a fluid moves&lt;U+2014&gt;from an upper-level low across the southwestern Atlantic.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> By <a href="October_13" title="wikilink">October 13</a>, a broad <a href="low_pressure_area" title="wikilink">area of low pressure</a> developed and persisted about 150 miles (240 km) southeast of <a href="Jamaica" class="uri" title="wikilink">Jamaica</a>,<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> possibly aided by the passage of <a href="tropical_wave" title="wikilink">tropical waves</a> through the area at the time.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> <a href="Convection" class="uri" title="wikilink">Convection</a> increased and became slightly better organized, though upper-level wind shear initially prevented <a href="tropical_cyclogenesis" title="wikilink">development</a>. The system drifted westward,<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> and early on <a href="October_14" title="wikilink">October 14</a> the convection became more concentrated and a little better organized as upper-level wind shear lessened slightly.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>Later on <a href="October_14" title="wikilink">October 14</a>, the system became much better defined, with increasingly organized shower and thunderstorm activity, as conditions in the upper levels of the atmosphere became significantly more favorable. It was then that the <a href="National_Hurricane_Center" title="wikilink">National Hurricane Center</a> first indicated that it was possible for a tropical depression to develop in the area.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> <a href="Dvorak_technique" title="wikilink">Dvorak classifications</a> were initiated on <a href="October_15" title="wikilink">October 15</a>.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> The system continued to organize, with the National Hurricane Center remarking the system could ultimately become a hurricane.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> By late on <a href="October_15" title="wikilink">October 15</a>, the surface circulation became defined well-enough, with sufficiently organized deep convection, for the National Hurricane Center to designate the system as Tropical Depression Twenty-Four while it was located about 220 miles (345 km) east-southeast of <a href="Grand_Cayman" title="wikilink">Grand Cayman</a>.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<p>The depression tracked slowly westward, a motion due to weak steering currents caused by a <a href="ridge_(meteorology)" title="wikilink">high pressure system</a> to its north across the Gulf of Mexico. Initially, the center of circulation was broad without a defined inner core; forecaster <a href="Lixion_Avila" title="wikilink">Lixion Avila</a> remarked, &quot;The area of minimum pressure could [have been] anywhere within 60 miles (95 km) of its [initial advisory position].&quot; Initially, the tropical depression was forecast to drift west-southwestward before turning to the north; within 120 hours of the forecast's issuance, the system was predicted to be located about 80 miles (130 km) south of the <a href="Isle_of_Youth" title="wikilink">Isle of Youth</a> as a 105 mph (170 km/h) hurricane. However, the National Hurricane Center noted in the first advisory on the depression that there were &quot;all indications that there could a dangerous hurricane in the northwestern Caribbean Sea in 3 to 5 days.&quot; This was due to the depression being located within an environment very conducive for <a href="tropical_cyclogenesis" title="wikilink">development</a>, specifically low amounts of wind shear and very warm <a href="sea_surface_temperature" title="wikilink">water temperatures</a>.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<p>As Tropical Depression Twenty-Four drifted southwestward, it steadily organized; by early on <a href="October_16" title="wikilink">October 16</a>, <a href="tropical_cyclone#Physical_structure" title="wikilink">rainbands</a> began to gradually consolidate with well-established <a href="tropical_cyclone#Physical_structure" title="wikilink">outflow</a>, and a large upper-level <a href="anticyclone" class="uri" title="wikilink">anticyclone</a> developed over the depression.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> Although deep convection and <a href="tropical_cyclone#Physical_structure" title="wikilink">banding features</a> increased, mid-level dry air from the north prevented significant organization, and the convection was split into two primary areas. <a href="weather_buoy" title="wikilink">Surface buoy</a> reports indicated that, due to its large size, the system failed to strengthen beyond tropical depression status, even though it received <a href="tropical_storm" title="wikilink">tropical storm</a> strength <a href="Dvorak_technique" title="wikilink">Dvorak classifications</a> from The National Hurricane Center's Tropical Analysis and Forecast Branch and the <a href="National_Oceanic_and_Atmospheric_Administration" title="wikilink">National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration</a>'s Satellite Analysis Branch.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> Continued <a href="Hurricane_Hunters" title="wikilink">reconnaissance flights</a> reported peak winds of about 30 mph (50 km/h).<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>

<p>By early on <a href="October_17" title="wikilink">October 17</a>, the outer rainbands, which had previously dominated the structure of the cyclone, dissipated, while deep convection developed near and to the south of the center. <a href="Numerical_weather_prediction" title="wikilink">Computer models</a> predicted steady strengthening as the depression tracked westward before turning to the north. Of the intensity models, the <a href="Geophysical_Fluid_Dynamics_Laboratory" title="wikilink">Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory</a> predicted an intensity of 135 mph (215 km/h) within 36 hours, with other forecasts being more conservative in their predictions.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> Deep convection continued to develop to the south of the center, and the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Wilma at 0600 UTC on <a href="October_17" title="wikilink">October 17</a>, while located about 200 miles (320 km) southeast of Grand Cayman. Upon becoming a tropical storm, the National Hurricane Center predicted Wilma to track west-northwestward, reaching winds of 105 mph (170 km/h) before striking the northeastern portion of the <a href="Yucat&lt;U+00E1&gt;n_Peninsula" title="wikilink">Yucat&lt;U+00E1&gt;n Peninsula</a>.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> The storm continued to the southwest while deep convection persisted near the center. National Hurricane Center forecaster <a href="James_Franklin_(meteorologist)" title="wikilink">James Franklin</a> remarked, &quot;Confidence at the later ranges [of the forecast track] was unusually low&quot;, due to wide divergences between computer models.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> Late on <a href="October_17" title="wikilink">October 17</a>, a <a href="Hurricane_Hunters" title="wikilink">Hurricane Hunters</a> flight into Wilma recorded winds of 50 mph (85 km/h), but an unusually low pressure of 989 mbar (29.21 inHg), which would be more typical of a minimal hurricane. This was due to unusually low pressures across the region, which resulted in a lesser <a href="pressure_gradient" title="wikilink">pressure gradient</a> and thus lighter winds. Convection continued to develop near the center and became much more symmetrical.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
<p><img src="Wilma1315z-051019-1kg12.jpg" title="fig:Hurricane Wilma near peak intensity" alt="Hurricane Wilma near peak intensity" width="250" /> Tropical Storm Wilma began to turn to the west-northwest on <a href="October_18" title="wikilink">October 18</a>,<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> during which the storm developed a small, intermittent and ragged <a href="eye_(cyclone)" title="wikilink">eye feature</a> as well as a mid-level eye feature.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> It continued to intensify, and at 1200 UTC on <a href="October_18" title="wikilink">October 18</a>, Wilma attained hurricane status while located about 225 miles (360 km) south-southeast of Grand Cayman.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> Shortly after reaching hurricane strength, the hurricane began undergoing <a href="rapid_deepening" title="wikilink">explosive deepening</a>, subsequent to the development of a &quot;pinhole&quot; eye 9 miles (14 km) in diameter. This small eye was surrounded by a ring of deep convection, with cloud-top temperatures of about -125 <a href="Fahrenheit" title="wikilink">&lt;U+00B0&gt;F</a> (-87 <a href="Celsius" title="wikilink">&lt;U+00B0&gt;C</a>).<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a></p>
<p>Early on <a href="October_19" title="wikilink">October 19</a>, Wilma attained <a href="major_hurricane" title="wikilink">major hurricane</a> status while continuing to rapidly intensify, and by 0600 UTC, the storm's maximum sustained winds increased to 165 mph (270 km/h), making Wilma a dangerous <a href="List_of_Category_5_Atlantic_hurricanes" title="wikilink">Category 5 storm</a> on the <a href="Saffir-Simpson_Hurricane_Scale" title="wikilink">Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale</a>.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> In the span of just 24 hours, Wilma had intensified from a 70 mph (110 km/h) tropical storm to a 175 mph (280 km/h) Category 5 hurricane, an unprecedented event for an <a href="Atlantic_hurricane" title="wikilink">Atlantic hurricane</a>.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> The eye continued to contract to a diameter of about 3 miles (5 km), the smallest known eye in an Atlantic hurricane, and at 1200 UTC on <a href="October_19" title="wikilink">October 19</a>, Wilma attained peak winds of 185 mph (295 km/h). The central pressure rapidly dropped 54 mbar (1.65 inHg) from 0000 to 0600 UTC, and at 0800 UTC, a Hurricane Hunters flight recorded a minimum central pressure of 884 mbar (26.10 inHg) in a <a href="dropsonde" class="uri" title="wikilink">dropsonde</a> near the center of the extremely small eye. As the dropsonde did not reach the calm winds in the center, the pressure was estimated at 882 mbar (26.05 inHg), the lowest pressure in an Atlantic hurricane on record.
