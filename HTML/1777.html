<p><img src="Dark_Run_looking_downstream.JPG" title="fig:Dark Run looking downstream near Ringtown" alt="Dark Run looking downstream near Ringtown" /> Dark Run begins in <a href="Union_Township,_Schuylkill_County,_Pennsylvania" title="wikilink">Union Township</a>, a few tenths of a mile west of the community of Pattersonville. The stream flows north for several tenths of a mile, passing through a <a href="pond" class="uri" title="wikilink">pond</a>. It eventually turns east and passes through another pond before turning northeast. After some distance, the stream receives two unnamed tributaries and turns north-northeast, cutting through a <a href="ridge" class="uri" title="wikilink">ridge</a>. On the other side of the ridge, it receives another unnamed tributary and passes through the southeastern corner of <a href="Ringtown,_Pennsylvania" title="wikilink">Ringtown</a> before returning to Union Township. The stream continues north-northeast and receives another unnamed tributary before cutting through another ridge. It then meanders northeast for approximately a mile until it reaches its confluence with Catawissa Creek on the border between Union Township and <a href="East_Union_Township,_Schuylkill_County,_Pennsylvania" title="wikilink">East Union Township</a>.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
