<p><strong>Archimedes of Syracuse</strong> (<a href="Greek_language" title="wikilink">Greek</a>:  <em>c</em>. 287 BC – <em>c.</em> 212 BC) was an <a href="Ancient_Greece" title="wikilink">ancient Greek</a> <a href="mathematician" class="uri" title="wikilink">mathematician</a>, <a href="physicist" class="uri" title="wikilink">physicist</a> and <a href="engineer" class="uri" title="wikilink">engineer</a>. Although little is known of his life, he is regarded as one of the leading <a href="scientist" title="wikilink">scientists</a> in <a href="classical_antiquity" title="wikilink">classical antiquity</a>. In addition to making discoveries in the fields of <a href="mathematics" class="uri" title="wikilink">mathematics</a> and <a href="geometry" class="uri" title="wikilink">geometry</a>, he is credited with designing <a href="machine" title="wikilink">machines</a> that were innovative. He laid the foundations of <a href="hydrostatics" class="uri" title="wikilink">hydrostatics</a>, and explained the principle of the <a href="lever" class="uri" title="wikilink">lever</a>, the device on which <a href="mechanics" class="uri" title="wikilink">mechanics</a> is based. His early advances in <a href="calculus" class="uri" title="wikilink">calculus</a> included the first known <a href="summation" class="uri" title="wikilink">summation</a> of an <a href="infinite_series" title="wikilink">infinite series</a> with a method that is still used today.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> The historians of <a href="Ancient_Rome" title="wikilink">Ancient Rome</a> showed a strong interest in Archimedes and wrote accounts of his life and works, while the relatively few copies of his treatises that survived through the <a href="Middle_Ages" title="wikilink">Middle Ages</a> were an influential source of ideas for scientists during the <a href="Renaissance" class="uri" title="wikilink">Renaissance</a>.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>Archimedes died during the <a href="Siege_of_Syracuse_(212_BC)" title="wikilink">Siege of Syracuse</a>, when he was killed by a Roman soldier despite orders that he should not be harmed. At his request, his tomb carried a carving of his favorite mathematical proof. Modern experiments have tested claims that he built a &quot;death ray&quot; capable of setting ships on fire at a distance, and that he constructed a device that could sink ships by lifting them out of the water. <a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> The discovery of previously unknown works by Archimedes in the <a href="Archimedes_Palimpsest" title="wikilink">Archimedes Palimpsest</a> has provided new insights into how he obtained mathematical results. <a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p><a href="Carl_Friedrich_Gauss" title="wikilink">Carl Friedrich Gauss</a> is said to have remarked that Archimedes was one of the three  mathematicians, with the others being <a href="Sir_Isaac_Newton" title="wikilink">Sir Isaac Newton</a> and <a href="Ferdinand_Eisenstein" title="wikilink">Ferdinand Eisenstein</a>.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>

It was sculpted by Gerhard Thieme and unveiled in 1972." /> Archimedes was born <em>c</em>. 287 BC in the seaport city of <a href="Syracuse,_Sicily" title="wikilink">Syracuse, Sicily</a>, at that time a colony of <a href="Magna_Graecia" title="wikilink">Magna Graecia</a>. The date of birth is based on an assertion by the <a href="Byzantine_Greeks" title="wikilink">Byzantine Greek</a> historian <a href="John_Tzetzes" title="wikilink">John Tzetzes</a> that Archimedes lived for 75 years.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> In <em><a href="The_Sand_Reckoner" title="wikilink">The Sand Reckoner</a></em>, Archimedes gives his father's name as Phidias, an <a href="astronomer" class="uri" title="wikilink">astronomer</a> about whom nothing is known. <a href="Plutarch" class="uri" title="wikilink">Plutarch</a> wrote in his <em><a href="Parallel_Lives" title="wikilink">Parallel Lives</a></em> that Archimedes was related to King <a href="Hiero_II_of_Syracuse" title="wikilink">Hiero II</a>, the ruler of Syracuse.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> A biography of Archimedes was written by his friend Heracleides but this work has been lost, leaving the details of his life obscure.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> It is unknown, for instance, whether he ever married or had children. Archimedes probably spent part of his youth in <a href="Alexandria" class="uri" title="wikilink">Alexandria</a>, <a href="Egypt" class="uri" title="wikilink">Egypt</a>, where <a href="Conon_of_Samos" title="wikilink">Conon of Samos</a> and <a href="Eratosthenes" title="wikilink">Eratosthenes of Cyrene</a> were contemporaries. He referred to Conon of Samos as his friend, while two of his works (<em>The Sand Reckoner</em> and the <em><a href="Archimedes&#39;_Cattle_Problem" title="wikilink">Cattle Problem</a></em>) have introductions addressed to Eratosthenes.</p>
<p>Archimedes died <em>c</em>. 212 BC during the <a href="Second_Punic_War" title="wikilink">Second Punic War</a>, when Roman forces under General <a href="Marcus_Claudius_Marcellus" title="wikilink">Marcus Claudius Marcellus</a> captured the city of Syracuse after a two year long <a href="siege" class="uri" title="wikilink">siege</a>. According to the popular account given by Plutarch, Archimedes was contemplating a mathematical diagram when the city was captured. A Roman soldier commanded him to come and meet General Marcellus but he declined, saying that he had to finish working on the problem. The soldier was enraged by this, and killed Archimedes with his sword. Plutarch also gives a  account of the death of Archimedes which suggests that he may have been killed while attempting to surrender to a Roman soldier. According to this story, Archimedes was carrying mathematical instruments, and was killed because the soldier thought that they were valuable items. General Marcellus was reportedly angered by the death of Archimedes, as he had ordered him not to be harmed.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<p>The last words attributed to Archimedes are &quot;Do not disturb my circles&quot; (<a href="Greek_language" title="wikilink">Greek</a>: &lt;U+03BC&gt;&lt;U+03AE&gt; &lt;U+03BC&gt;&lt;U+03BF&gt;&lt;U+03C5&gt; &lt;U+03C4&gt;&lt;U+03BF&gt;&lt;U+03CD&gt;&lt;U+03C2&gt; &lt;U+03BA&gt;&lt;U+03CD&gt;&lt;U+03BA&gt;&lt;U+03BB&gt;&lt;U+03BF&gt;&lt;U+03C5&gt;&lt;U+03C2&gt; &lt;U+03C4&gt;&lt;U+03AC&gt;&lt;U+03C1&gt;&lt;U+03B1&gt;&lt;U+03C4&gt;&lt;U+03C4&gt;&lt;U+03B5&gt;), a reference to the circles in the mathematical drawing that he was supposedly studying when disturbed by the Roman soldier. This quote is often given in <a href="Latin" class="uri" title="wikilink">Latin</a> as &quot;Noli turbare circulos meos&quot;, but there is no reliable evidence that Archimedes uttered these words and they do not appear in the account given by Plutarch.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>

<p><img src="Archimedes_sphere_and_cylinder_crop.png" title="fig:The sphere has 2/3 the surface area and volume of the circumscribing cylinder. A sphere and cylinder were carved on the tomb of Archimedes at his request." alt="The sphere has 2/3 the surface area and volume of the circumscribing cylinder. A sphere and cylinder were carved on the tomb of Archimedes at his request." /> The tomb of Archimedes had a carving of his favorite mathematical diagram, which was a <a href="sphere" class="uri" title="wikilink">sphere</a> inside a <a href="cylinder_(geometry)" title="wikilink">cylinder</a> of the same height and diameter. Archimedes had proved that the volume and surface area of the sphere would be two thirds that of the cylinder. In 75 BC, 137 years after his death, the Roman <a href="orator" class="uri" title="wikilink">orator</a> <a href="Cicero" class="uri" title="wikilink">Cicero</a> was serving as <a href="quaestor" class="uri" title="wikilink">quaestor</a> in <a href="Sicily" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sicily</a>. He had heard stories about the tomb of Archimedes, but none of the locals was able to give him the location. Eventually he found the tomb near the Agrigentine gate in Syracuse, in a neglected condition and overgrown with bushes. Cicero had the tomb cleaned up, and was able to see the carving and read some of the verses that had been added as an inscription.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<p>The standard versions of the life of Archimedes were written long after his death by the historians of Ancient Rome. The account of the siege of Syracuse given by <a href="Polybius" class="uri" title="wikilink">Polybius</a> in his <em>Universal History</em> was written around seventy years after Archimedes' death, and was used subsequently as a source by Plutarch and <a href="Livy" class="uri" title="wikilink">Livy</a>. It sheds little light on Archimedes as a person, and focuses on the war machines that he is said to have built in order to defend the city.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="discoveries-and-inventions">Discoveries and inventions</h2>
<p>The most commonly related <a href="anecdote" class="uri" title="wikilink">anecdote</a> about Archimedes tells how he invented a method for measuring the volume of an object with an irregular shape. According to <a href="Vitruvius" class="uri" title="wikilink">Vitruvius</a>, a new crown in the shape of a <a href="laurel_wreath" title="wikilink">laurel wreath</a> had been made for <a href="Hiero_II_of_Syracuse" title="wikilink">King Hiero</a>, and Archimedes was asked to determine whether it was of solid <a href="gold" class="uri" title="wikilink">gold</a>, or whether <a href="silver" class="uri" title="wikilink">silver</a> had been added by a dishonest goldsmith.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> Archimedes had to solve the problem without damaging the crown, so he could not melt it down in order to measure its <a href="density" class="uri" title="wikilink">density</a> as a cube, which would have been the simplest solution. While taking a bath, he noticed that the level of the water rose as he got in. He realized that this effect could be used to determine the <a href="volume" class="uri" title="wikilink">volume</a> of the crown, and therefore its density after weighing it. The density of the crown would be lower if cheaper and less dense metals had been added. He then took to the streets naked, so excited by his discovery that he had forgotten to dress, crying &quot;<a href="Eureka_(word)" title="wikilink">Eureka</a>!&quot; &quot;I have found it!&quot; (<a href="Greek_language" title="wikilink">Greek</a>: &quot;&lt;U+03B5&gt;&lt;U+03CD&gt;&lt;U+03C1&gt;&lt;U+03B7&gt;&lt;U+03BA&gt;&lt;U+03B1&gt;!&quot;)<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<p>The story about the golden crown does not appear in the known works of Archimedes, but in his treatise <em>On Floating Bodies</em> he gives the principle known in <a href="hydrostatics" class="uri" title="wikilink">hydrostatics</a> as <a href="Archimedes&#39;_Principle" title="wikilink">Archimedes' Principle</a>. This states that a body immersed in a fluid experiences a buoyant force equal to the weight of the displaced fluid.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
<p>While Archimedes did not invent the <a href="lever" class="uri" title="wikilink">lever</a>, he wrote the earliest known rigorous explanation of the principle involved. According to <a href="Pappus_of_Alexandria" title="wikilink">Pappus of Alexandria</a>, his work on levers caused him to remark: &quot;Give me a place to stand on, and I will move the Earth.&quot; (<a href="Greek_language" title="wikilink">Greek</a>: &quot;&lt;U+03B4&gt;&lt;U+03BF&gt;&lt;U+03C2&gt; &lt;U+03BC&gt;&lt;U+03BF&gt;&lt;U+03B9&gt; &lt;U+03C0&gt;&lt;U+03B1&gt; &lt;U+03C3&gt;&lt;U+03C4&gt;&lt;U+03C9&gt; &lt;U+03BA&gt;&lt;U+03B1&gt;&lt;U+03B9&gt; &lt;U+03C4&gt;&lt;U+03B1&gt;&lt;U+03BD&gt; &lt;U+03B3&gt;&lt;U+03B1&gt;&lt;U+03BD&gt; &lt;U+03BA&gt;&lt;U+03B9&gt;&lt;U+03BD&gt;&lt;U+03AC&gt;&lt;U+03C3&gt;&lt;U+03C9&gt;&quot;)<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> Plutarch describes how Archimedes designed <a href="block_and_tackle" title="wikilink">block and tackle</a> <a href="pulley" class="uri" title="wikilink">pulley</a> systems, allowing sailors to use the principle of <a href="leverage" class="uri" title="wikilink">leverage</a> to lift objects that would otherwise have been too heavy to move.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> <img src="Archimedes-screw_one-screw-threads_with-ball_3D-view_animated_small.gif" title="fig:The Archimedes&#39; screw was operated by hand and could raise water efficiently." alt="The Archimedes&#39; screw was operated by hand and could raise water efficiently." /> A large part of Archimedes' work in engineering arose from fulfilling the needs of his home city of Syracuse. The Greek writer <a href="Athenaeus" title="wikilink">Athenaeus of Naucratis</a> described how King Hieron II commissioned Archimedes to design a huge ship, the <em><a href="Syracusia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Syracusia</a></em>, which could be used for luxury travel, carrying supplies, and as a naval warship. The <em>Syracusia</em> is said to have been the largest ship built in classical antiquity.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> According to Athenaeus, it was capable of carrying 600 people and included garden decorations, a <a href="Gymnasium_(ancient_Greece)" title="wikilink">gymnasium</a> and a temple dedicated to the goddess <a href="Aphrodite" class="uri" title="wikilink">Aphrodite</a> among its facilities. Since a ship of this size would leak a considerable amount of water through the hull, the <a href="Archimedes&#39;_Screw" title="wikilink">Archimedes' Screw</a> was purportedly developed in order to remove the bilge water. The screw was a machine with a revolving screw shaped blade inside a cylinder. It was turned by hand, and could also be used to transfer water from a  body of water into irrigation canals. Versions of the Archimedes' screw are still in use today in developing countries. The Archimedes' screw described in Roman times by Vitruvius may have been an improvement on a screw pump that was used to irrigate the <a href="Hanging_Gardens_of_Babylon" title="wikilink">Hanging Gardens of Babylon</a>.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a><a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a><a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a></p>
<p>The <a href="Claw_of_Archimedes" title="wikilink">Claw of Archimedes</a> is another weapon that he is said to have designed in order to defend the city of Syracuse. Also known as &quot;the ship shaker&quot;, the claw consisted of a crane-like arm from which a large metal grappling hook was suspended. When the claw was dropped on to an attacking ship the arm would swing upwards, lifting the ship out of the water and possibly sinking it. There have been modern experiments to test the feasibility of the claw, and in 2005 a television documentary entitled <em>Superweapons of the Ancient World</em> built a version of the claw and concluded that it was a workable device.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a><a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a></p>
<p>Archimedes has also been credited with improving the power and accuracy of the <a href="catapult" class="uri" title="wikilink">catapult</a>, and with inventing the <a href="odometer" class="uri" title="wikilink">odometer</a> during the <a href="First_Punic_War" title="wikilink">First Punic War</a>. The odometer was described as a cart with a gear mechanism that dropped a ball into a container after each mile traveled.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a></p>
<p><a href="Cicero" class="uri" title="wikilink">Cicero</a> (106 BC–43 BC) mentions Archimedes briefly in his <a href="dialogue" class="uri" title="wikilink">dialogue</a> <em><a href="De_re_publica" title="wikilink">De re publica</a></em>, which portrays a fictional conversation taking place in 129 BC. After the capture of Syracuse <em>c.</em> 212 BC, General <a href="Marcus_Claudius_Marcellus" title="wikilink">Marcus Claudius Marcellus</a> is said to have taken back to Rome two mechanisms used as aids in astronomy, which showed the motion of the Sun, Moon and five planets. Cicero mentions similar mechanisms designed by <a href="Thales" title="wikilink">Thales of Miletus</a> and <a href="Eudoxus_of_Cnidus" title="wikilink">Eudoxus of Cnidus</a>. The dialogue says that Marcellus kept one of the devices as his only personal loot from Syracuse, and donated the other to the Temple of Virtue in Rome. Marcellus' mechanism was demonstrated, according to Cicero, by <a href="Gaius_Sulpicius_Gallus" title="wikilink">Gaius Sulpicius Gallus</a> to <a href="Lucius_Furius_Philus" title="wikilink">Lucius Furius Philus</a>, who described it thus:</p>

<p>This is a description of a <a href="planetarium" class="uri" title="wikilink">planetarium</a> or <a href="orrery" class="uri" title="wikilink">orrery</a>. <a href="Pappus_of_Alexandria" title="wikilink">Pappus of Alexandria</a> stated that Archimedes had written a manuscript (now lost) on the construction of these mechanisms entitled . Modern research in this area has been focused on the <a href="Antikythera_mechanism" title="wikilink">Antikythera mechanism</a>, another device from classical antiquity that was probably designed for the same purpose. Constructing mechanisms of this kind would have required a sophisticated knowledge of <a href="gear" title="wikilink">differential gearing</a>. This was once thought to have been beyond the range of the technology available in ancient times, but the discovery of the Antikythera mechanism in 1902 has confirmed that devices of this kind were known to the ancient Greeks.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a><a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="death-ray">&quot;Death ray&quot;</h3>
<p><img src="Archimedes_Heat_Ray_conceptual_diagram.png" title="fig:Archimedes may have used mirrors acting as a parabolic reflector to burn ships attacking Syracuse" alt="Archimedes may have used mirrors acting as a parabolic reflector to burn ships attacking Syracuse" /> <a href="Lucian" class="uri" title="wikilink">Lucian</a> wrote that during the <a href="Siege_of_Syracuse_(212_BC)" title="wikilink">Siege of Syracuse</a> (<em>c.</em> 214–212 BC), Archimedes repelled an attack by Roman forces with a <a href="burning_glass" title="wikilink">burning glass</a>.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> The device was used to focus sunlight on to the approaching ships, causing them to catch fire. This claim, sometimes called the &quot;Archimedes death ray&quot;, has been the subject of ongoing debate about its credibility since the Renaissance. <a href="Ren&lt;U+00E9&gt;_Descartes" title="wikilink">Ren&lt;U+00E9&gt; Descartes</a> rejected it as false, while modern researchers have attempted to recreate the effect using only the means that would have been available to Archimedes.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> It has been suggested that a large array of highly polished <a href="bronze" class="uri" title="wikilink">bronze</a> or <a href="copper" class="uri" title="wikilink">copper</a> shields acting as mirrors could have been employed to focus sunlight on to a ship. This would have used the principle of the <a href="parabolic_reflector" title="wikilink">parabolic reflector</a> in a manner similar to a <a href="solar_furnace" title="wikilink">solar furnace</a>.</p>
<p>In October 2005 a group of students from the <a href="Massachusetts_Institute_of_Technology" title="wikilink">Massachusetts Institute of Technology</a> carried out an experiment with 127 one-foot (30 cm) square mirror tiles, focused on a  wooden ship at a range of around 100 feet (30 m). Flames broke out on a patch of the ship, but only after the sky had been cloudless and the ship had remained stationary for around ten minutes. It was concluded that the weapon was a feasible device under these conditions. The MIT group repeated the experiment for the television show <em><a href="MythBusters" class="uri" title="wikilink">MythBusters</a></em>, using a wooden fishing boat in <a href="San_Francisco" title="wikilink">San Francisco</a> as the target. Again some charring occurred, along with a small amount of flame. When <em>Mythbusters</em> broadcast the result of the San Francisco experiment in January 2006, the claim was placed in the category of '<a href="wikt:http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/busted" title="wikilink">busted</a>' (a slang expression used here in the sense of 'invalidated') because of the length of time and ideal weather conditions required for combustion to occur. <a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> Critics of the MIT experiments have argued that the moisture content of the wood needs to be taken into consideration. However, the <a href="flash_point" title="wikilink">flash point</a> of wood is around 300 degrees Celsius (572 degrees F), and this is hotter than the maximum temperature produced by domestic ovens.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a></p>
<p>A similar test of the &quot;Archimedes death ray&quot; was carried out in 1973 by the Greek scientist Ioannis Sakkas. The experiment took place at the <a href="Skaramagas" class="uri" title="wikilink">Skaramagas</a> naval base outside <a href="Athens" class="uri" title="wikilink">Athens</a>. On this occasion 70 mirrors were used, each with a copper coating and a size of around five by three feet (1.5 by 1 m). The mirrors were pointed at a plywood  of a Roman warship at a distance of around 160 feet (50 m). When the mirrors were focused accurately, the ship burst into flames within a few seconds. The plywood ship had a coating of <a href="bitumen" title="wikilink">tar</a> paint, which is flammable and may have aided combustion.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="mathematics">Mathematics</h2>
<p>While he is often regarded as a designer of mechanical devices, Archimedes also made contributions to the field of mathematics. <a href="Plutarch" class="uri" title="wikilink">Plutarch</a> wrote: &lt;U+201C&gt;He placed his whole affection and ambition in those purer speculations where there can be no reference to the vulgar needs of life.&lt;U+201D&gt;<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> <img src="Archimedes_pi.svg" title="fig:Archimedes used the method of exhaustion to approximate the value of &lt;U+03C0&gt;." alt="Archimedes used the method of exhaustion to approximate the value of &lt;U+03C0&gt;." /> Archimedes was able to use <a href="infinitesimals" class="uri" title="wikilink">infinitesimals</a> in a way that is similar to modern <a href="integral_calculus" title="wikilink">integral calculus</a>. By assuming a proposition to be true and showing that this would lead to a <a href="contradiction" class="uri" title="wikilink">contradiction</a>, he could give answers to problems to an arbitrary degree of accuracy, while specifying the limits within which the answer lay. This technique is known as the <a href="method_of_exhaustion" title="wikilink">method of exhaustion</a>, and he employed it to approximate the value of <a href="Pi" title="wikilink">&lt;U+03C0&gt;</a> (Pi). He did this by drawing a larger <a href="polygon" class="uri" title="wikilink">polygon</a> outside a <a href="circle" class="uri" title="wikilink">circle</a> and a smaller polygon inside the circle. As the number of sides of the polygon increases, it becomes a more accurate approximation of a circle. When the polygons had 96 sides each, he calculated the lengths of their sides and showed that the value of &lt;U+03C0&gt; lay between  (approximately 3.1429) and  (approximately 3.1408). He also proved that the <a href="area" class="uri" title="wikilink">area</a> of a circle was equal to &lt;U+03C0&gt; multiplied by the <a href="square_(geometry)" title="wikilink">square</a> of the <a href="radius" class="uri" title="wikilink">radius</a> of the circle.</p>
<p>In <em>The Measurement of a Circle</em>, Archimedes gives the value of the <a href="square_root" title="wikilink">square root</a> of 3 as being more than  (approximately 1.732) and less than  (approximately 1.7320512). The actual value is around 1.7320508076, making this a very accurate estimate. He introduced this result without offering any explanation of the method used to obtain it. This aspect of the work of Archimedes caused <a href="John_Wallis" title="wikilink">John Wallis</a> to remark that he was: &quot;as it were of set purpose to have covered up the traces of his investigation as if he had grudged posterity the secret of his method of inquiry while he wished to extort from them assent to his results.&quot;<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a></p>

<p>In <em><a href="The_Sand_Reckoner" title="wikilink">The Sand Reckoner</a></em>, Archimedes set out to calculate the number of grains of sand that the universe could contain. In doing so, he challenged the notion that the number of grains of sand was too large to be counted. He wrote: &quot;There are some, King Gelo (Gelo II, son of <a href="Hiero_II" title="wikilink">Hiero II</a>), who think that the number of the sand is infinite in multitude; and I mean by the sand not only that which exists about Syracuse and the rest of Sicily but also that which is found in every region whether inhabited or uninhabited.&quot; To solve the problem, Archimedes devised a system of counting based around the <a href="myriad" class="uri" title="wikilink">myriad</a>. The word is based on the Greek for uncountable, <em>murious</em>, and was also used to denote the number 10,000. He proposed a number system using powers of myriad myriads (100 million) and concluded that the number of grains of sand required to fill the universe would be 8 in modern notation.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a></p>
