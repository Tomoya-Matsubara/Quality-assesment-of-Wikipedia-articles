<h4 id="election-petition-tribunal">Election Petition Tribunal</h4>
<p>Ugochukwu sought redress at the Abia State Election Petition Tribunal. Governor <a href="Theodore_Orji" title="wikilink">Theodore Orji's</a> election was annulled on February 25, 2008, on the grounds that he was ineligible to contest for the office. Orji and his deputy had failed to resign their respective positions in the Abia State government, 30 days prior to the election as stipulated in the <a href="Constitution_of_Nigeria" title="wikilink">1999 Constitution</a>. The Tribunal also cited Governor Orji's failure to prove beyond a reasonable doubt, his affiliation with a secret cult.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> Ugochukwu was thus declared the lawful winner of the April 2007 gubernatorial election, and <a href="Governor_of_Abia_State" title="wikilink">Governor-elect of Abia State</a> -- pending the outcome at the <a href="Port_Harcourt" title="wikilink">Port Harcourt</a> Appeals Court <a href="http://africa.reuters.com/wire/news/usnL25378284.html">9</a>.
