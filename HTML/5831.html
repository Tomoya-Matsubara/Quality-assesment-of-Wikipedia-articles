<p><strong><em>Jimmy White's Whirlwind Snooker</em></strong> was a <a href="computer_game" title="wikilink">computer game</a> by veteran programmer <a href="Archer_MacLean" title="wikilink">Archer MacLean</a>, released by <a href="Virgin_Interactive" title="wikilink">Virgin Games</a> in <a href="1991_in_video_gaming" title="wikilink">1991</a> for the <a href="Commodore_Amiga" title="wikilink">Commodore Amiga</a>, <a href="Atari_ST" title="wikilink">Atari ST</a> and <a href="IBM_PC_compatible" title="wikilink">PC</a> (later for the <a href="Sega_Mega_Drive" title="wikilink">Sega Mega Drive</a>). Although the game was not the first to simulate a <a href="snooker" class="uri" title="wikilink">snooker</a> or <a href="Pocket_billiards" title="wikilink">pool</a> <a href="Billiard_table" title="wikilink">table</a> in <a href="3D_computer_graphics" title="wikilink">3D</a>, it made full use of the <a href="Instructions_per_second" title="wikilink">processing power</a> and <a href="Graphics_card" title="wikilink">graphics capabilities</a> of <a href="16-bit" class="uri" title="wikilink">16-bit</a> <a href="Personal_computer" title="wikilink">home computers</a> and was praised for its then ground-breaking realism and easy-to-use <a href="User_interface_design" title="wikilink">interface</a>. Many remarked that the game was the closest thing to being on a real snooker table that existed at that time, and that it could be used by a player to refine their real-life snooker skills.</p>

<p>The game took MacLean several years to complete; the <a href="Billiard_ball" title="wikilink">Billiard ball</a> <a href="physics" class="uri" title="wikilink">physics</a> alone taking several months of <a href="Game_programming" title="wikilink">programming</a>. One of the reasons why the game runs as quickly as it does is the way in which each  is played. The next shot is effectively pre-played while the  is being  â€“ the position and movement of each ball being calculated <a href="Film_frame#Video_frame" title="wikilink">frame</a>-by-frame and kept in a list in <a href="Computer_memory" title="wikilink">memory</a>. Each frame of the next shot is then displayed by <a href="Rendering_(computer_graphics)" title="wikilink">rendering</a> each ball from this list, frame-by-frame, instead of rendering it in <a href="Real-time_computer_graphics" title="wikilink">real-time</a>.</p>

<p><img src="JWWS_Amiga_Taunt.png" title="fig:A red ball taunts the player." alt="A red ball taunts the player." />Despite being a accurate (for the time) and serious <a href="Computer_simulation" title="wikilink">simulation</a> of the sport, MacLean's irreverent sense of humour was prominent throughout. The <a href="sound_effect" title="wikilink">sound effect</a> used for a successful  was a resounding &quot;pop&quot; (regardless of the speed at which the ball reached the <a href="Pocket_(billiards)" title="wikilink">pocket</a>) and numerous <a href="Computer_animation" title="wikilink">animations</a> provided comic relief should a player take more than a few seconds to take their shot. Balls would sprout eyeballs and arms, making faces at the player or holding up signs that read &quot;Get on with it!&quot; and such.</p>
<p>Also present was an extensive <a href="trick_shot" title="wikilink">trick shot</a> editor, featuring a number of pre-set table arrangements with instructions on how they should be played. An <a href="Easter_egg_(media)" title="wikilink">easter egg</a> enabled the option to watch the computer player complete a <a href="147_break" title="wikilink">maximum break</a>.</p>
<p>The game's title music was similar to (and probably intended to pay homage to) that of snooker TV programme <em><a href="Pot_Black" title="wikilink">Pot Black</a></em>.</p>

<p>Following the game's release, Virgin launched a nationwide tournament in the UK. Regional heats were held at <a href="Virgin_Megastores" title="wikilink">Virgin's stores</a>; the eventual winner went on to challenge MacLean himself in the first series of <a href="Channel_4" title="wikilink">Channel 4</a>'s <em><a href="GamesMaster" class="uri" title="wikilink">GamesMaster</a></em> with snooker pro <a href="Jimmy_White" title="wikilink">Jimmy White</a> commentating.</p>
