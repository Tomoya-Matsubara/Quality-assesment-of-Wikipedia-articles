<p><strong>Anna Elisabeth Johansson B&lt;U+00E5&gt;genholm</strong> (born 1970)<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> is a Swedish <a href="radiologist" class="uri" title="wikilink">radiologist</a> from <a href="V&lt;U+00E4&gt;nersborg" class="uri" title="wikilink">V&lt;U+00E4&gt;nersborg</a>. In 1998, she became a surgeon assistant at the hospital in <a href="Narvik" class="uri" title="wikilink">Narvik</a>, Norway. While skiing in the mountains outside of the town on May 20, 1999, she accidentally fell into a frozen stream and got stuck under a layer of ice for eighty minutes until she was rescued. B&lt;U+00E5&gt;genholm was able to find an air pocket under the ice, but became <a href="Clinical_death" title="wikilink">clinically dead</a> after forty minutes in the water. Her <a href="Normal_human_body_temperature" title="wikilink">body temperature</a> decreased to &lt;U+2014&gt;the lowest survived body temperature ever recorded in a human.</p>
<p>B&lt;U+00E5&gt;genholm was transported by helicopter to the <a href="University_Hospital_of_North_Norway" title="wikilink">Troms&lt;U+00F8&gt; University Hospital</a>, where a team of more than a hundred doctors and nurses worked for nine hours to save her life. B&lt;U+00E5&gt;genholm woke up <a href="Paralysis" title="wikilink">paralyzed</a> from the neck down on 30 May 1999, and recovered in an <a href="intensive_care_unit" title="wikilink">intensive care unit</a> for two months. Although she has made an almost full recovery from the incident, she still suffers from minor <a href="nerve_damage" title="wikilink">nerve damage</a> in her hands and feet. B&lt;U+00E5&gt;genholm is currently working as a radiologist at the hospital where her life was saved.</p>

B&lt;U+00E5&gt;genholm soon recovered from the paralysis, however, and later apologized to her friends;<a href="#fn70" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a> &quot;I was very irritated when I realized they had saved me.

<p>Doctor Petter Andreas Steen, professor at the <a href="Rikshospitalet" title="wikilink">National Hospital in Oslo</a>, said it was &quot;an extraordinary medical achievement&quot; that B&lt;U+00E5&gt;genholm's life could he saved. He believed the reason she was able to recover was that her <a href="metabolism" class="uri" title="wikilink">metabolism</a> slowed down during the incident and the tissues inside her body required less oxygen at the low temperatures.<a href="#fn76" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref76"><sup>76</sup></a> According to the journal <em>Proto Magazine</em> by <a href="Massachusetts_General_Hospital" title="wikilink">Massachusetts General Hospital</a>, B&lt;U+00E5&gt;genholm's metabolism slowed down to ten percent of &quot;its baseline rate&quot; and thus she barely needed any oxygen at all.<a href="#fn77" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref77"><sup>77</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="aftermath">Aftermath</h2>
<p>Despite the severe damages to B&lt;U+00E5&gt;genholm's body, she did not suffer any <a href="brain_damage" title="wikilink">brain damage</a>; Gilbert commented on this: &quot;Her body had time to cool down completely before the heart stopped. Her brain was so cold when the heart stopped that the <a href="brain_cell" title="wikilink">brain cells</a> needed very little oxygen, so the brain could survive for quite a prolonged time.&quot;<a href="#fn78" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref78"><sup>78</sup></a> B&lt;U+00E5&gt;genholm's case and the cases of others who have survived extreme hypothermia have, according to <em><a href="The_Sydney_Morning_Herald" title="wikilink">The Sydney Morning Herald</a></em>, &quot;informed modern medicine to such an extent that cooling patients is emerging as a way to save victims of <a href="heart_attack" title="wikilink">heart attack</a>, <a href="head_trauma" title="wikilink">head trauma</a>, <a href="stroke" class="uri" title="wikilink">stroke</a> and <a href="Spinal_cord_injury" title="wikilink">spinal cord injuries</a>.&quot;<a href="#fn79" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref79"><sup>79</sup></a></p>
