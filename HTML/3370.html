<p><strong>World War II</strong>, or the <strong>Second World War</strong><a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> (often abbreviated <strong>WWII</strong> or <strong>WW2</strong>), was a global <a href="War" title="wikilink">military conflict</a> between 1939 and 1945, which involved <a href="Participants_in_World_War_II" title="wikilink">most of the world's nations</a>, including all <a href="great_power" title="wikilink">great powers</a>, organised into two opposing military alliances: the <a href="Allies_of_World_War_II" title="wikilink">Allies</a> and the <a href="Axis_powers" title="wikilink">Axis</a>. It was the most widespread war in history, with more than 100 million military personnel mobilised. In a state of &quot;<a href="total_war" title="wikilink">total war</a>,&quot; the major participants placed their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities at the service of the war effort, erasing the distinction between civilian and military resources. Over <a href="World_War_II_casualties" title="wikilink">seventy million people</a>, the majority civilians, were killed, making it <a href="List_of_wars_and_disasters_by_death_toll" title="wikilink">the deadliest conflict</a> in <a href="History_of_the_world" title="wikilink">human history</a>.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>The start of the war is generally held to be September 1, 1939, with the <a href="Invasion_of_Poland_(1939)" title="wikilink">invasion of Poland</a> by <a href="Nazi_Germany" title="wikilink">Nazi Germany</a> and subsequent <a href="declaration_of_war" title="wikilink">declarations of war</a> on Germany by most of the countries in the <a href="British_Empire" title="wikilink">British Empire</a> and <a href="Commonwealth_of_Nations" title="wikilink">Commonwealth</a>, and by <a href="French_Third_Republic" title="wikilink">France</a>. Many countries were already at war before this date, such as <a href="Ethiopia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ethiopia</a> and <a href="Italy" class="uri" title="wikilink">Italy</a> in the <a href="Second_Italo-Abyssinian_War" title="wikilink">Second Italo-Abyssinian War</a> and <a href="Republic_of_China" title="wikilink">China</a> and <a href="Empire_of_Japan" title="wikilink">Japan</a> in the <a href="Second_Sino-Japanese_War" title="wikilink">Second Sino-Japanese War</a>.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> Many who were not initially involved joined the war later, as a result of events such as the <a href="Operation_Barbarossa" title="wikilink">German invasion of the Soviet Union</a>, the Japanese attacks on <a href="attack_on_Pearl_Harbor" title="wikilink">Pearl Harbor</a> and <a href="Japanese_invasion_of_Malaya" title="wikilink">British colonies</a>, and subsequent declarations of war on Japan by the <a href="United_States" title="wikilink">United States</a>, the <a href="British_Commonwealth" title="wikilink">British Commonwealth</a>,<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> and the <a href="Netherlands" class="uri" title="wikilink">Netherlands</a>.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1945, the war ended in a victory for the Allies. The <a href="Soviet_Union" title="wikilink">Soviet Union</a> and the <a href="United_States" title="wikilink">United States</a> subsequently emerged as the world's two <a href="superpower" title="wikilink">superpowers</a>, setting the stage for the <a href="Cold_War" title="wikilink">Cold War</a> which lasted for the next 46 years. The <a href="United_Nations" title="wikilink">United Nations</a> was formed in the hope of preventing another world conflict. The acceptance of the principle of <a href="self-determination" class="uri" title="wikilink">self-determination</a> accelerated <a href="decolonization" class="uri" title="wikilink">decolonization</a> movements in Asia and Africa, while <a href="Western_Europe" title="wikilink">Western Europe</a> itself began moving toward <a href="European_integration" title="wikilink">integration</a>. </p>
<h2 id="chronology">Chronology</h2>

<p>The start of the war is generally held to be September 1, 1939 beginning with the German invasion of Poland; Britain and France declared war on Germany two days later. Other dates for the beginning of war include the <a href="Japanese_invasion_of_Manchuria" title="wikilink">Japanese invasion of Manchuria</a> on September 13, 1931;<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> the start of the <a href="Second_Sino-Japanese_War" title="wikilink">Second Sino-Japanese War</a> on July 7, 1937;<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a><a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> or one of several other events.</p>
<p>Others follow <a href="A._J._P._Taylor" title="wikilink">A. J. P. Taylor</a>, who held that there was a simultaneous Sino-Japanese War in East Asia, and a Second European War in Europe and her colonies. The two wars merged in 1941, becoming a single global conflict, at which point the war continued until 1945. This article uses the conventional dating.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<p>The exact date of the war's end is not universally agreed upon. It has been suggested that the war ended at the armistice of August 14, 1945 (<a href="Victory_over_Japan_Day" title="wikilink">V-J Day</a>), rather than the formal surrender of Japan (September 2, 1945); in some European histories, it ended on <a href="Victory_in_Europe_Day" title="wikilink">V-E Day</a> (May 8, 1945). The <a href="Treaty_of_San_Francisco" title="wikilink">Treaty of Peace with Japan</a> was not signed until 1951.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="background">Background</h2>

<p>A variety of events led to the escalation of hostilities between the Axis and Allied powers prior to the start of the war. In the <a href="aftermath_of_World_War_I" title="wikilink">aftermath of</a> <a href="World_War_I" title="wikilink">World War I</a>, a defeated <a href="History_of_Germany_during_World_War_I" title="wikilink">Germany</a> signed the <a href="Treaty_of_Versailles" title="wikilink">Treaty of Versailles</a>.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> This caused Germany to lose around 13 percent of its home territory and all of its overseas colonies, prohibited German annexation of other states, imposed massive reparations and limited the size and makeup of Germany's armed forces.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<p>The <a href="Russian_Civil_War" title="wikilink">Russian Civil War</a> led to the creation of the <a href="Soviet_Union" title="wikilink">Soviet Union</a>. After Lenin's death, Stalin seized power in the USSR and repudiated the <a href="New_Economic_Policy" title="wikilink">New Economic Policy</a> favouring the Five Year Plans instead.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> In Italy, <a href="Benito_Mussolini" title="wikilink">Benito Mussolini</a> <a href="March_on_Rome" title="wikilink">seized power</a> as a <a href="fascist" class="uri" title="wikilink">fascist</a> <a href="dictator" class="uri" title="wikilink">dictator</a>, promising to create a &quot;<a href="Italian_colonial_empire" title="wikilink">New Roman Empire</a>.&quot;<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<p>The <a href="Kuomintang" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kuomintang</a> (KMT) party in <a href="China" class="uri" title="wikilink">China</a> launched a <a href="Northern_Expedition_(1926&lt;U+2013&gt;1927)" title="wikilink">unification campaign</a> against regional warlords and nominally unified China in the mid-1920s, but was soon embroiled in a <a href="Chinese_Civil_War" title="wikilink">civil war</a> against its former <a href="Chinese_communist" title="wikilink">Chinese communist</a> allies.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> In 1931, an <a href="Militarism-Socialism_in_Showa_Japan" title="wikilink">increasingly militaristic</a> <a href="Empire_of_Japan" title="wikilink">Japanese Empire</a>, which had long sought influence in China<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> as the first step of its <a href="Hakko_ichiu" title="wikilink">right to rule Asia</a>, used the <a href="Mukden_Incident" title="wikilink">Mukden Incident</a> as justification to <a href="Japanese_invasion_of_Manchuria" title="wikilink">invade Manchuria</a> and established the <a href="puppet_state" title="wikilink">puppet state</a> of <a href="Manchukuo" class="uri" title="wikilink">Manchukuo</a>.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> Too weak to resist Japan, China appealed to the <a href="League_of_Nations" title="wikilink">League of Nations</a> for help. Japan withdrew from the League of Nations after being <a href="Lytton_Report" title="wikilink">condemned</a> for its incursion into Manchuria.

He abolished <a href="democracy" class="uri" title="wikilink">democracy</a>, espousing a <a href="Nazism_and_race" title="wikilink">radical, racially-motivated revision of the world order</a>, and soon began a massive <a href="German_re-armament" title="wikilink">rearmament campaign</a>.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> Meanwhile, France, to secure its alliance, <a href="Franco&lt;U+2013&gt;Italian_Agreement" title="wikilink">allowed Italy a free hand in Ethiopia</a>, which Italy desired as a colonial possession. The situation was aggravated in early 1935 when the <a href="Saarland" class="uri" title="wikilink">Saarland</a> was legally reunited with Germany and Hitler repudiated the Treaty of Versailles, speeding up his rearmament programme and introducing <a href="conscription" class="uri" title="wikilink">conscription</a>.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>
<p>Hoping to contain Germany, the United Kingdom, France and Italy formed the <a href="Stresa_Front" title="wikilink">Stresa Front</a>. The Soviet Union, concerned due to <a href="Drang_nach_Osten" title="wikilink">Germany's goals of capturing vast areas of eastern Europe</a>, wrote a treaty of mutual assistance with France. Before taking effect though, the <a href="Franco-Soviet_Treaty_of_Mutual_Assistance" title="wikilink">Franco-Soviet pact</a> was required to go through the bureaucracy of the <a href="League_of_Nations" title="wikilink">League of Nations</a>, which rendered it essentially toothless.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a><a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a></p>
<p>In June 1935, the United Kingdom made an <a href="Anglo-German_Naval_Agreement" title="wikilink">independent naval agreement</a> with Germany, easing prior restrictions. The United States, concerned with events in Europe and Asia, passed the <a href="Neutrality_Act" title="wikilink">Neutrality Act</a> in August.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> In October, Italy invaded Ethiopia, with Germany the only major European nation supporting her invasion.

Both sides used the conflict to test new weapons and methods of warfare,<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> and the nationalists won the war in early 1939. Mounting tensions led to several efforts to strengthen or consolidate power. In October 1936, Germany and Italy formed the <a href="Rome-Berlin_Axis" title="wikilink">Rome-Berlin Axis</a>. A month later, Germany and Japan signed the <a href="Anti-Comintern_Pact" title="wikilink">Anti-Comintern Pact</a>, which Italy would join in the following year.

<p>In June 1938, Chinese forces stalled the Japanese advance by <a href="1938_Yellow_River_flood" title="wikilink">flooding the Yellow River</a>; although this manoeuvre bought time for the Chinese to prepare their defences at <a href="Wuhan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Wuhan</a>, the <a href="Battle_of_Wuhan" title="wikilink">city was taken</a> by October.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> However, Japanese military victories did not bring about the collapse of Chinese resistance that Japan had hoped to achieve, instead the Chinese government relocated to <a href="Chongqing" class="uri" title="wikilink">Chongqing</a> to contiunue their resistance.</p>

Although the battle was a Soviet victory, the Japanese dismissed it as an inconclusive draw, and on May 11, 1939 decided to move the Japanese-Mongolian border up to the Khalkin Gol River by force. Stalin replaced the former Soviet commander with <a href="Zhukov" class="uri" title="wikilink">Zhukov</a> on <a href="Timoshenko" class="uri" title="wikilink">Timoshenko</a>'s advice. Zhukov, along with reinforcements sent from <a href="Moscow" class="uri" title="wikilink">Moscow</a>, checked the Japanese assault on <a href="Mongolia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mongolia</a> and handed the Japanese <a href="Kwangtung_Army" title="wikilink">Kwangtung Army</a> their first major defeat.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a><a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a></p>
<p>These two battles were significant in that they persuaded the Japanese Government to favor the anti-American plan proposed by the Japanese Navy, this ensured that the USSR would only be engaged in single front warfare against Nazi Germany.

<p>Soon after the end of World War II, conflict flared again in many parts of the world. In China, nationalist and communist forces quickly resumed their <a href="Chinese_Civil_War" title="wikilink">civil war</a>.

<p>Following the end of the war, a rapid period of <a href="decolonization" class="uri" title="wikilink">decolonization</a> also took place within the holdings of the various European colonial powers.<a href="#fn254" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref254"><sup>254</sup></a> These primarily occurred due to shifts in ideology, the economic exhaustion from the war and increased demand by indigenous people for self-determination.

<p>Estimates for the total casualties of the war vary, due to the fact that many deaths went unrecorded. Most suggest that some 60 million people died in the war, including about <a href="Battle_casualties_of_World_War_II" title="wikilink">20 million soldiers</a> and 40 million civilians.<a href="#fn268" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref268"><sup>268</sup></a><a href="#fn269" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref269"><sup>269</sup></a><a href="#fn270" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref270"><sup>270</sup></a> Many civilians died because of <a href="Infectious_disease" title="wikilink">disease</a>, <a href="starvation" class="uri" title="wikilink">starvation</a>, <a href="List_of_massacres" title="wikilink">massacres</a>, <a href="Strategic_bombing_during_World_War_II" title="wikilink">bombing</a> and deliberate <a href="genocide" class="uri" title="wikilink">genocide</a>.

<p>Of the total deaths in World War II, approximately 85 percent were on the Allied side (mostly Soviet and Chinese) and 15 percent were on the Axis side. One estimate is that 12 million civilians died in Nazi concentration camps,<a href="#fn272" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref272"><sup>272</sup></a> 1.5 million by bombs, 7 million in Europe from other causes, and 7.5 million in China from other causes.<a href="#fn273" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref273"><sup>273</sup></a></p>

<p><img src="Bundesarchiv_Bild_101I-031-2436-03A,_Russland,_Hinrichtung_von_Partisanen.jpg" title="fig:Soviet partisans hanged by German forces in January 1943" alt="Soviet partisans hanged by German forces in January 1943" /> In Europe, occupation came under two very different forms. In Western, Northern and Central Europe (France, Norway, Denmark, the Low Countries, and the <a href="Protectorate_of_Bohemia_and_Moravia" title="wikilink">annexed portions of Czechoslovakia</a>) Germany established economic policies through which it collected roughly 69.5 billion <a href="German_Reichsmark" title="wikilink">reichmarks</a> (27.8 billion US Dollars) by the end of the war; this figure does not include the <a href="Nazi_plunder" title="wikilink">sizable plunder</a> of industrial products, military equipment, raw materials and other goods.<a href="#fn319" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref319"><sup>319</sup></a> Thus, the income from occupied nations was over 40 percent of the income Germany collected from taxation, a figure which increased to nearly 40 percent of total German income as the war went on.<a href="#fn320" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref320"><sup>320</sup></a></p>
<p>In the East, the much hoped for bounties of <em>Lebensraum</em> were never attained as fluctuating front-lines and Soviet <a href="scorched_earth" title="wikilink">scorched earth</a> policies denied resources to the German invaders.<a href="#fn321" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref321"><sup>321</sup></a> Unlike in the West, the <a href="Racial_policy_of_Nazi_Germany" title="wikilink">Nazi racial policy</a> encouraged excessive brutality against what it considered to be the &quot;<a href="Untermensch" title="wikilink">inferior people</a>&quot; of Slavic descent; most German advances were thus followed by <a href="Generalplan_Ost" title="wikilink">mass executions</a>.<a href="#fn322" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref322"><sup>322</sup></a> Although <a href="Resistance_during_World_War_II" title="wikilink">resistance groups</a> did form in most occupied territories, they did not significantly hamper German operations in either the East<a href="#fn323" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref323"><sup>323</sup></a> or the West<a href="#fn324" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref324"><sup>324</sup></a> until late 1943.</p>
<p>In Asia, Japan termed nations under its occupation as being part of the <a href="Greater_East_Asia_Co-prosperity_Sphere" title="wikilink">Greater East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere</a>, essentially a Japanese <a href="hegemony" class="uri" title="wikilink">hegemony</a> which it claimed was for purposes of liberating colonised peoples.<a href="#fn325" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref325"><sup>325</sup></a> Although Japanese forces were originally welcomed as liberators from European domination in many territories, their excessive brutality turned local public opinions against them within weeks.<a href="#fn326" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref326"><sup>326</sup></a> During Japan's initial conquest it captured 4 million barrels of oil (~5.5&lt;U+00D7&gt;10<sup>5</sup> tonnes) left behind by retreating Allied forces, and by 1943 was able to get production in the Dutch East Indies up to , 76 percent of its 1940 output rate.<a href="#fn327" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref327"><sup>327</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="advances-in-technology-and-warfare">Advances in technology and warfare</h3>

<p>During the war, aircraft continued their roles of reconnaissance, <a href="fighter_aircraft" title="wikilink">fighters</a>, <a href="bomber" title="wikilink">bombers</a> and ground-support from World War I, though each area was advanced considerably. Two important additional roles for aircraft were those of the <a href="airlift" class="uri" title="wikilink">airlift</a>, the capability to quickly move high-priority supplies, equipment and personnel, albeit in limited quantities;<a href="#fn328" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref328"><sup>328</sup></a> and of <a href="strategic_bombing" title="wikilink">strategic bombing</a>, the targeted use of bombs against civilian areas in the hopes of hampering enemy industry and morale.<a href="#fn329" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref329"><sup>329</sup></a> <a href="Anti-aircraft_warfare" title="wikilink">Anti-aircraft weaponry</a> also continued to advance, including key defences such as <a href="radar" class="uri" title="wikilink">radar</a> and greatly improved anti-aircraft artillery, such as the German <a href="88_mm_gun" title="wikilink">88 mm gun</a>. <a href="Jet_aircraft" title="wikilink">Jet aircraft</a> saw their first limited operational use during World War II, and though their late introduction and limited numbers meant that they had no real impact during the war itself, the few which saw active service pioneered a mass-shift to their usage following the war.<a href="#fn330" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref330"><sup>330</sup></a> <img src="U995_2004_1.jpg" title="fig:U-995 Type VIIC at the German navy memorial at Laboe" alt="U-995 Type VIIC at the German navy memorial at Laboe" /> At sea, while advances were made in almost all aspects of naval warfare, the two primary areas of development were focused around aircraft carriers and submarines. Although at the start of the war <a href="Aeronautics" title="wikilink">aeronautical</a> warfare had relatively little success, actions at Taranto, Pearl Harbor, the South China Sea and the Coral Sea soon established the carrier as the dominant capital ship in place of the battleship.<a href="#fn331" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref331"><sup>331</sup></a><a href="#fn332" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref332"><sup>332</sup></a><a href="#fn333" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref333"><sup>333</sup></a> In the Atlantic, <a href="escort_carrier" title="wikilink">escort carriers</a> proved to be a vital part of Allied convoys, increasing the effective protection radius dramatically and helping to close the <a href="Mid-Atlantic_gap" title="wikilink">Mid-Atlantic gap</a>.<a href="#fn334" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref334"><sup>334</sup></a> Beyond their increased effectiveness, carriers were also more economical than battleships due to the relatively low cost of aircraft<a href="#fn335" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref335"><sup>335</sup></a> and their not requiring to be as heavily armoured.<a href="#fn336" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref336"><sup>336</sup></a> Submarines, which had proved to be an effective weapon during the First World War<a href="#fn337" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref337"><sup>337</sup></a> were anticipated by all sides to be important in the second. The British focused development on <a href="Anti-submarine_warfare" title="wikilink">anti-submarine</a> <a href="anti-submarine_weapon" title="wikilink">weaponry</a> and tactics, such as <a href="sonar" class="uri" title="wikilink">sonar</a> and convoys, while Germany focused on improving its offensive capability, with designs such as the <a href="German_Type_VII_submarine" title="wikilink">Type VII submarine</a> and <a href="Wolf_pack" title="wikilink">Wolf pack</a> tactics.<a href="#fn338" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref338"><sup>338</sup></a> Gradually, continually improving Allied technologies such as the <a href="Leigh_light" title="wikilink">Leigh light</a>, <a href="Hedgehog_(weapon)" title="wikilink">hedgehog</a>, <a href="Squid_(weapon)" title="wikilink">squid</a>, and <a href="Mark_24_FIDO_Torpedo" title="wikilink">homing torpedoes</a> proved victorious.</p>
<p>Land warfare changed drastically from the static front lines predominating in World War I to become much more fluid and mobile. An important change was the concept of <a href="combined_arms" title="wikilink">combined arms</a> warfare, wherein tight coordination was sought between the various elements of military forces; the <a href="tank" class="uri" title="wikilink">tank</a>, which had been used predominantly for infantry support in the First World War, had evolved into the primary weapon of these forces during the second.<a href="#fn339" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref339"><sup>339</sup></a> In the late 1930s, tank design was considerably more advanced in all areas then it had been during World War I,<a href="#fn340" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref340"><sup>340</sup></a> and <a href="Tanks_in_World_War_II" title="wikilink">advances continued throughout the war</a> in increasing speed, armour and firepower.</p>
<p>At the start of the war, most armies considered the tank to be the best weapon against itself, and developed special-purpose tanks to that effect.<a href="#fn341" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref341"><sup>341</sup></a> This line of thinking was all but negated by the poor performance of the relatively light early tank armaments against armour, and German doctrine of avoiding tank-versus-tank combat; the latter factor, along with Germany's use of combined arms, were among the key elements of their highly successful blitzkrieg tactics across Poland and France.<a href="#fn342" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref342"><sup>342</sup></a> Many means of <a href="anti-tank_warfare" title="wikilink">destroying tanks</a>, including <a href="Indirect_fire" title="wikilink">indirect artillery</a>, <a href="anti-tank_gun" title="wikilink">anti-tank guns</a> (both towed and <a href="self-propelled_gun" title="wikilink">self-propelled</a>), <a href="anti-tank_mine" title="wikilink">mines</a>, short-ranged infantry antitank weapons, and other tanks were utilised.<a href="#fn343" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref343"><sup>343</sup></a> Even with large-scale mechanisation of the various armies, the infantry remained the backbone of all forces,<a href="#fn344" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref344"><sup>344</sup></a> and throughout the war, most infantry equipment was similar to that utilised in World War I.<a href="#fn345" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref345"><sup>345</sup></a></p>
<p>The United States became the first country to arm its soldiers with a <a href="semi-automatic_rifle" title="wikilink">semi-automatic rifle</a>, in this case the <a href="M-1_Garand" title="wikilink">M-1 Garand</a>. Some of the primary advances though, were the widespread incorporation of portable <a href="machine_gun" title="wikilink">machine guns</a>, a notable example being the German <a href="MG42" class="uri" title="wikilink">MG42</a>, and various <a href="submachine_gun" title="wikilink">submachine guns</a> which were well suited to close-quarters combat in urban and jungle settings.<a href="#fn346" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref346"><sup>346</sup></a> The <a href="assault_rifle" title="wikilink">assault rifle</a>, a late war development which incorporated many of the best features of the <a href="rifle" class="uri" title="wikilink">rifle</a> and submachine gun, became the standard postwar infantry weapon for nearly all armed forces.<a href="#fn347" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref347"><sup>347</sup></a><a href="#fn348" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref348"><sup>348</sup></a></p>
<p>In terms of communications, most of the major belligerents attempted to solve the problems of complexity and security presented by using large <a href="codebook" title="wikilink">codebooks</a> for <a href="cryptography" class="uri" title="wikilink">cryptography</a> with the creation of various <a href="cipher" title="wikilink">ciphering</a> machines, the most well known being the German <a href="Enigma_machine" title="wikilink">Enigma machine</a>.<a href="#fn349" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref349"><sup>349</sup></a><a href="#fn350" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref350"><sup>350</sup></a> <a href="SIGINT" class="uri" title="wikilink">SIGINT</a> (<em>sig</em>nals <em>int</em>elligence) was the countering process of decryption, with the notable examples being the British <a href="ULTRA" class="uri" title="wikilink">ULTRA</a> and the Allied breaking of <a href="Japanese_naval_codes" title="wikilink">Japanese naval codes</a>.<a href="#fn351" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref351"><sup>351</sup></a> Another important aspect of <a href="military_intelligence" title="wikilink">military intelligence</a> was the use of <a href="deception" class="uri" title="wikilink">deception</a> operations, which the Allies successfully used on several occasions to great effect, such as operations <a href="Operation_Mincemeat" title="wikilink">Mincemeat</a> and <a href="Operation_Bodyguard" title="wikilink">Bodyguard</a>.<a href="#fn352" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref352"><sup>352</sup></a><a href="#fn353" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref353"><sup>353</sup></a> Other important technological and engineering feats achieved during, or as a result of, the war include the the world's first programmable <a href="computer" title="wikilink">computers</a> (<a href="Z3_(computer)" title="wikilink">Z3</a>, <a href="Colossus_computer" title="wikilink">Colossus</a>, and <a href="ENIAC" class="uri" title="wikilink">ENIAC</a>), <a href="V-1_flying_bomb" title="wikilink">guided missiles</a> and <a href="V-2_rocket" title="wikilink">modern rockets</a>, the <a href="Manhattan_Project" title="wikilink">Manhattan Project</a>'s development of <a href="nuclear_weapon" title="wikilink">nuclear weapons</a>, the development of <a href="Mulberry_harbour" title="wikilink">artificial harbours</a> and <a href="Operation_Pluto" title="wikilink">oil pipelines under the English Channel</a>.<a href="#fn354" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref354"><sup>354</sup></a></p>

<li id="fn1">{{ cite web |quote=Official military histories in Commonwealth and Western nations refer to the conflict as the Second World War (e.g. <a href="C.P._Stacey" title="wikilink">C.P.
