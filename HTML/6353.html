<p>Kolkata has long been known for its literary, artistic and revolutionary heritage. As the former capital of India, Kolkata was the birthplace of modern Indian literary, artistic and scholastic thought. Kolkatans tend to have a special appreciation for art and literature; its tradition of welcoming new talent has made it a &quot;city of furious creative energy&quot;.<ref name=sinha>{{</p>

<h2 id="para-adda-and-club-culture">Para, Adda, and &quot;club&quot; culture</h2>
<p><a href="Para" title="wikilink">Paras</a> in Kolkata signify a neighbourhood with a strong sense of community, and are usually sharply defined on the basis of loyalties (like which households contribute economically to which public or &quot;<a href="barowari" class="uri" title="wikilink">barowari</a>&quot; <a href="Puja_(Hinduism)" title="wikilink">puja</a>). <a href="Para" title="wikilink">Paras</a> culture typically segregate Kolkata communities on the basis of origin (West Bengal origin &quot;<a href="ghotis" class="uri" title="wikilink">ghotis</a>&quot; versus East Bengal origin &quot;<a href="bangal" title="wikilink">bangals</a>&quot; - there are <a href="para" title="wikilink">paras</a> which have names like &quot;prothom bangal para&quot; (first bangal para)), occupation and socio-economic status (paras have names like &quot;kumorpara&quot; (potter para)), and sometimes even politics and religion.</p>
<p>Typically, every <a href="para" class="uri" title="wikilink">para</a> has its own community club, with a club room (&quot;club ghar&quot;), and often a playing field. People of a <a href="para" class="uri" title="wikilink">para</a> habitually indulge in <a href="adda" class="uri" title="wikilink">adda</a> or leisurely chat in &quot;rock&quot;s or &quot;rowacks&quot; (porches) and teashops in the evenings after work. North Kolkata <a href="para" title="wikilink">paras</a> typically have more street life at late nights with respect to South Kolkata <a href="para" title="wikilink">paras</a>. Sports (<a href="cricket" class="uri" title="wikilink">cricket</a>, <a href="football_(soccer)" title="wikilink">football</a>, <a href="badminton" class="uri" title="wikilink">badminton</a>) and indoor games (<a href="carrom" class="uri" title="wikilink">carrom</a>) tournaments are regularly organized on an inter-para basis.</p>
<p>The <a href="para" class="uri" title="wikilink">para</a> culture is fast waning, for good or bad, with the rise of apartment complexes, and the rise of the cosmopolitan nature of Kolkata.</p>
<p>An <a href="adda" class="uri" title="wikilink">adda</a> involves an informal discussion usually involving friends talking over a <em>bhaar</em>(cup) of tea on current issues. An <em>adda</em> may be viewed as a form of intellectual exchange among members of the same socio-economic strata. It is most popular among the youths belonging to the so-called &quot;middle-class intelligentsia&quot;.</p>
<h2 id="graffiti">Graffiti</h2>
<p>Graffiti was used not for vandalism, or counterculture art, but mainly for political propaganda. Walls were &quot;captured&quot; for fixed numbers of years, and graffiti over-painting was tantamount to political transgression. Generations of political graffiti artists have been at work on Kolkata's walls, producing slander, witty banter and limericks, caricatures and propaganda. However, such acts being clear cases of defacing private property, the <a href="Calcutta_High_Court" title="wikilink">Calcutta High Court</a> ruled to ban political graffiti from private properties without express consent of the property owner. Graffiti lives on in &quot;club&quot; walls, unclaimed property walls, and the occasional flouting of the order. Graffiti artists have become a part of Kolktata's heritage. Many house owners now welcome them to paint on their walls so that these are not captured by political parties. Social messages like AIDS awareness, environmental issues etc., are now getting more popularity.</p>
<h2 id="traffic-and-commuter-culture">Traffic and commuter culture</h2>
<p>Calcuttans are aggressive commuters, but with a sense of humour. The local and suburban rails and buses, as well as the underground <a href="Kolkata_Metro" title="wikilink">Kolkata Metro</a> railway are usually packed during office hours. The practice of &quot;reserving&quot; public seats by daily passengers is widespread. <a href="Share_taxi" title="wikilink">Share taxis</a> are a common occurrence for travel to and from railway stations and such. The practice of <a href="car_pool" title="wikilink">car pools</a> is also growing after the construction of the <a href="Eastern_Metropolitan_Bypass" title="wikilink">Eastern Metropolitan Bypass</a> and the emergence of the CBD in <a href="Bidhan_Nagar" title="wikilink">Bidhan Nagar</a>.</p>
<p>Another phenomenon of Kolkata traffic is the Auto-rikshaws. Auto-rikshaws or autos as they are acronymed are small contraptions on the roads. They have three wheels, and are extremely agile. The regulation is three passengers at back, one in front along with the driver. This regulation is disregarded with impunity and often six or more people get in. Autos ply on fixed routes and the fare ranges from Rs.4 to Rs. 15, depending on the distance covered.</p>
<h2 id="cinema">Cinema</h2>
<p>While <a href="Mumbai" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mumbai</a> is the capital of commercial cinemas in India, Kolkata is the house of art-films. Stallwarts like <a href="Satyajit_Ray" title="wikilink">Satyajit Ray</a>, <a href="Ritwik_Ghatak" title="wikilink">Ritwik Ghatak</a>, <a href="Mrinal_Sen" title="wikilink">Mrinal Sen</a> are the pride of Kolkata. The biggest event of Indian cinema was the release of <em><a href="Pather_Panchali" title="wikilink">Pather Panchali</a></em> in 1955 made by <a href="Satyajit_Ray" title="wikilink">Satyajit Ray</a> based on a novel of Bibhutibhusan Banerjee. This film connected Indian film to the rest of the world. The movie was acclaimed throughout the world specially in the Western world as a symbol of undying human spirit. Presently, <a href="Aparna_Sen" title="wikilink">Aparna Sen</a>, <a href="Budhdhadeb_Dasgupta" title="wikilink">Budhdhadeb Dasgupta</a>, <a href="Gautam_Ghose" title="wikilink">Gautam Ghose</a>, <a href="Rituparno_Ghosh" title="wikilink">Rituparno Ghosh</a> are bearing the mantle of the great tradition. <a href="Kolkata_Film_Festival" title="wikilink">Kolkata Film Festival</a>, held annually across several cinema theatres in the city serves to the taste of Kolkata people for cinema from all over the world. <a href="Nandan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Nandan</a> is a popular cinema complex in the premiers of <a href="Rabindra_Sadan" title="wikilink">Rabindra Sadan</a>, maintained by the state government. This theater complex holds regular shows of national and international cinema.<img src="Satyajit_Ray.jpg" title="fig:Satyajit Ray" alt="Satyajit Ray" /></p>
<p>In 1897, films were shown for the first time in Calcutta. Couple of years later, Hiralal Sen from north Calcutta started making films at the Classic Theatres. In 1901, Hiralal Sen set up Royal Bioscope, produced scenes and dance sequences from popular Bengali plays. The first Bengali movie was &quot;Billwamangal&quot; in 1919 which happened to be a silent movie. The first Bengali talkie, Dena Paona was released in 1931, directed by Premankur Atarthi and produced by New Theatres. The first popular hero in Bengali film was probably Pramathesh Barua, who was a director himself too.</p>
<p>The commercial Bengali cinema industry, known as &quot;Tollywood&quot;, is based in <a href="Tollygunge" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tollygunge</a> locality of the city. Several film studios are located here. Though the popularity of the commercial Bengali cinemas has dwindled in the urban area, they continue to be popular in the rural West Bengal. The golden age of commercial Bengali cinema is said to be 1950-1970 and involved actors such as <a href="Uttam_Kumar" title="wikilink">Uttam Kumar</a>, <a href="Soumitra_Chatterjee" title="wikilink">Soumitra Chatterjee</a>, <a href="Utpal_Dutta" title="wikilink">Utpal Dutta</a>, <a href="Suchitra_Sen" title="wikilink">Suchitra Sen</a>, Chobi Biswas, Sabitri Chottopadhya, Pahari Sanyal, Bikash Roy. <a href="Suchitra_Sen" title="wikilink">Suchitra Sen</a> received best actress award in <a href="Moscow_Film_Festival" title="wikilink">Moscow Film Festival</a> for her role in <em>Saat Paake Badha</em> co-starring <a href="Soumitra_Chatterjee" title="wikilink">Soumitra Chatterjee</a>.</p>

The Kolkata litt&lt;U+00E9&gt;rateurs still borrow a lot from Tagore. In the 1940s, 1950s and 1950s, a new breed of Bengali writers and poets came into being in Kolkata exemplified by <a href="Jibanananda_Das" title="wikilink">Jibanananda Das</a>, <a href="Sukanta_Bhattacharya" title="wikilink">Sukanta Bhattacharya</a>, <a href="Bishnu_Dey" title="wikilink">Bishnu Dey</a>, <a href="Premendra_Mitra" title="wikilink">Premendra Mitra</a>, <a href="Buddhadeb_Guha" title="wikilink">Buddhadeb Guha</a> etc. They wanted to break free from the traditional <a href="mysticism" class="uri" title="wikilink">mysticism</a> and <a href="surrealism" class="uri" title="wikilink">surrealism</a> of Tagore style and present various concepts such as <a href="modernism" class="uri" title="wikilink">modernism</a>, <a href="post-modernism" class="uri" title="wikilink">post-modernism</a>, <a href="cubism" class="uri" title="wikilink">cubism</a> through their writings. <a href="Satyajit_Ray" title="wikilink">Satyajit Ray</a> was also a writer, especially for children.
