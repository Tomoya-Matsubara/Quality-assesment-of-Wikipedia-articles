<p><strong>Sixto Escobar</strong> (March 23, 1913 &lt;U+2013&gt; November 17, 1979) was a <a href="Puerto_Rican_people" title="wikilink">Puerto Rican</a> professional <a href="boxing" title="wikilink">boxer</a>. Competing in the <a href="bantamweight" class="uri" title="wikilink">bantamweight</a> division, he became <a href="Puerto_Rico" title="wikilink">Puerto Rico</a>'s first world champion. Escobar was born in <a href="Barceloneta,_Puerto_Rico" title="wikilink">Barceloneta</a> and raised in San Juan. There he received his primary education and took interest in boxing. After gathering a record of 21-1-1 as an amateur, Escobar debuted as a professional in 1931 defeating Luis &quot;Kid Dominican&quot; P&lt;U+00E9&gt;rez by <a href="knockout" class="uri" title="wikilink">knockout</a>. Early in his career, he moved to Venezuela due to the lack of opponents in his division. There he received an opportunity for the Venezuelan Bantamweight championship, but lost by <a href="Unanimous_decision" title="wikilink">points</a>. Subsequently he moved to New York and began boxing in other states, eventually capturing the Montreal Athletic Commission World Bantamweight Title. In 1936, he defeated Tony Marino to unify this championship with the one recognized by the <a href="International_Boxing_Union" title="wikilink">International Boxing Union</a>, in the process becoming the third Latin American undisputed world boxing champion. After retiring, he worked as a spokesperson for beer companies in New York, before returning to Puerto Rico in the 1960s, where he resided until his death. He received several posthumous recognitions and his name was used in several sports venues and buildings. In 2002, Escobar was inducted into the <a href="International_Boxing_Hall_of_Fame" title="wikilink">International Boxing Hall of Fame</a>.</p>
<h2 id="early-life-and-amateur-career">Early Life and amateur career</h2>
<p>Escobar was born in Barrio Palmas Altas, a sector of Barceloneta, Puerto Rico, to Jacinto Escobar and Adela Vargas.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> Early in his life, he moved to Tras Talleres in Santurce, a subsection of San Juan, Puerto Rico. There he received his elementary and secondary education, up until the eighth grade, when he decided to dedicate himself full-time to his sports career.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> In Tras Talleres, he began developing an interest in boxing and received instruction in said discipline. Although at this time, boxing was illegal in Puerto Rico; remote places such as a house&lt;U+2019&gt;s backyard or rooftops were used to organize clandestine fights without attracting attention from the local police.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> In 1928, a Puerto Rican boxer named &lt;U+00C1&gt;ngel &quot;Sotito&quot; Soto moved from New York to a house near the Escobar family&lt;U+2019&gt;s residence and established a gym in his backyard. There he gave boxing classes to Escobar and several other young athletes.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> After several months of instruction, Soto prepared a boxing card with included three-round fights, in which each round lasted two minutes. In this event, Escobar earned his first victory, defeating a pugilist identified as &quot;Gombar&quot; by knockout in the first round.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> After this match, Escobar continued fighting in clandestine gyms. He met and was received by Ignacio Pe&lt;U+00F1&gt;agaricano, the owner of Victoria Gym.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> Escobar received his boxing license through Pe&lt;U+00F1&gt;agaricano. On February 16, 1927, governor <a href="Horace_Mann_Towner" title="wikilink">Horace Mann Towner</a> legalized boxing and allowed the establishment of organized boxing matches. Professionals would fight Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays which, were considered the best days of the week, while amateurs could compete the remaining days of the week without limitations.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> As an amateur, he fought in 23 combats, gathering a record of 21 wins, one loss and a draw.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> His draw was against Ram&lt;U+00F3&gt;n Rodr&lt;U+00ED&gt;guez of <a href="San_Lorenzo,_Puerto_Rico" title="wikilink">San Lorenzo</a> and his only loss was in the hands of <a href="Pedro_Monta&lt;U+00F1&gt;ez" title="wikilink">Pedro Monta&lt;U+00F1&gt;ez</a> from <a href="Cayey,_Puerto_Rico" title="wikilink">Cayey</a>, in a fight that took place in March 1930.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="professional-career">Professional career</h2>
<p>Escobar turned professional on September 1, 1930, in a <a href="fight_card" title="wikilink">fight card</a> organized at the Victory Garden gym in San Juan. In this event, he defeated Luis &quot;Kid Dominican&quot; P&lt;U+00E9&gt;rez, who entered the fight as the Dominican Republic's champion, by knockout in the third round.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> In Puerto Rico, Escobar fought in 15 contests, before moving to Venezuela after the popularity of professional boxing declined in his home country.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> This move was motivated by Roberto Andrade, who provided transportation to the country. In Venezuela, he fought in Caracas, competing against Jos&lt;U+00E9&gt; Lugo, Sindulfo D&lt;U+00ED&gt;az, Rafael &quot;Moralito&quot; Morales, Pica Pica and Sim&lt;U+00F3&gt;n Ch&lt;U+00E1&gt;vez among others.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> On November 11, 1931, Escobar competed against Enrique Chaffardet for the Venezuelan Bantamweight Title, but lost by decision. After 17 fights, he returned to Puerto Rico and competed in five cards. But professional boxing suffered another decline in interest, which forced Escobar to work as an accommodator in baseball games three days of the week, generally on weekends.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> In the meanwhile, Tony Rojas, a friend of his managers Gustavo Jim&lt;U+00E9&gt;nez and Arturo Gigante, convinced them to release Escobar of the contract which binded them.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> Since Escobar turned professional while he was still legally a minor, his father had to sign the unbinding agreement. After succeeding in this task, Rojas presented Escobar with a steam boat ticket to New York, which covered his food, clothes and hotel expenses.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> Escobar reached New York in early 1934, intending to &quot;obtain fame and honor&quot; for &quot;[his] motherland&quot;, there he was received by Rojas and professional trainer <a href="Whitey_Bimstein" title="wikilink">Whitey Bimstein</a>. His first fight in the United States took place in <a href="Holyoke,_Massachusetts" title="wikilink">Holyoke, Massachusetts</a> on May 7, 1934.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> In this contest he was paired against Canadian bantamweight titleholder Bobby Leitham, defeating him by technical knockout in the seventh round. <img src="Sixto_Escobar_El_Mundo.jpg" title="fig:El Mundo newspaper headline" alt="El Mundo newspaper headline" /> Escobar's manager, Lou Brix and his trainer recognized that Escobar could be close to a championship fight once the incumbent, Panamian <a href="Panama_Al_Brown" title="wikilink">Alfonso Te&lt;U+00F3&gt;filo Brown</a>, refused to defend the championship against the first contender, which led to it being stripped by the <a href="World_Boxing_Association" title="wikilink">National Boxing Association</a> (NBA).<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> A rematch was then organized against Leitham. This was an eliminatory card organized by the Montreal Athletic Commission, which was to determine a contender for their vacant Bantamweight World Championship, against first contender Baby Casanova, who attended the card. After scoring three knockdowns in the fourth round, Escobar connected another punch that injured Leitham, after which Leitham's manager surrendered the fight. This marked Leitham's last fight. Following this result, the NBA immediately called for a fight between Escobar and Casanova.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> By this time he had gained a reputation as a quick and technical boxer, capable of gathering quick knockouts with body punches if confronted by an unprepared opponent.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> The fight took place on June 26, 1934, and it was organized in <a href="Montreal" class="uri" title="wikilink">Montreal</a>, Canada. Escobar scored a knockdown in the third round; the fight concluded in the ninth round when Casanova lost by knockout. With this win, Escobar won the Montreal Athletic Commission World Bantamweight Title, thus becoming the first Puerto Rican to win a world boxing championship title.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> This had a signifficant impact on Puerto Rico, where it was constantly discussed by the general public. Songs, decimas and poetry were written about this accomplishment.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> However, the <a href="New_York_State_Athletic_Commission" title="wikilink">New York State Athletic Commission</a> (NYSAC) and <a href="International_Boxing_Union" title="wikilink">International Boxing Union</a> (IBU) of France didn't recognize the outcome of this fight, conserving Tony Marino and Brown as their recognized champions.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="undisputed-world-bantamweight-title">Undisputed world bantamweight title</h3>
<p>On August 8, 1934, he defeated Eugene Hart by points in a non-title match organized in Canada. This was the first time in his career that Escobar completed a 15-round contest. After this event, he stayed in Montreal expecting to fight against the winner of a matchup between <a href="Louis_Salica" title="wikilink">Louis Salica</a> and Bobby Quintana, which was schelueded to take place on December of that year. However, Escobar was forced to cancel his plans after suffering a heel injury when he was hit by a car.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> He spent a month in inactivity while recovering, and in the winter he returned to Puerto Rico.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> The governor ordered to have all government buildings closed so that public employees could attend a welcoming ceremony.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> The event, which took place in <a href="Old_San_Juan,_Puerto_Rico" title="wikilink">Old San Juan</a>'s dock, was followed by a parade.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> Upon arriving in Barceloneta, Escobar was recognized as a &quot;predilect son&quot; of that municipality by the city's mayor, which was followed by a week of festivities in his name.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> Escobar pursued a fight with Brown, but his offers were refused while the Panamian pugilist promoted a campaign protesting the removal of his recognition as champion, demanding to be reinstated.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a></p>
<p>On August 7, 1935, Escobar defeated Peter Santol, who was considered Canada's best bantaweight and held the Canadian Boxing Federation &amp; Montreal Athletic Commission (MAC) world titles, by unanimous decision in 12 rounds.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> However, Escobar still wasn't considered the division's <a href="Undisputed_Champion" title="wikilink">Undisputed Champion</a> because Baltazar Sangchili had defeated Panama Al Brown and was recognized by the IBU. Due to this, Santol sent a letter to the NYSAC noting that the fight was of eliminatory nature, even though it was recognized as a titular contest by the NBA and MAC.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> Wanting to be recognized as such, Escobar pursued a title unification fight against Tony Marino, who had defeated Sangchili by knockout in his previous fight.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> He won the fight by knockout in the tenth round, receiving the &quot;undisputed world champion&quot; distinction.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> On November 13, 1935, Escobar became the first Puerto Rican to win a title fight in the first round, defeating &quot;Indian&quot; Quintana by knockout.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a></p>
<p>This outcome made it possible to organize a fight against Louis Salica, it was the first time that Escobar fought a title fight in Puerto Rico.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> The card was promoted by Arturo Gigante and Gustavo Jim&lt;U+00E9&gt;nez Sicard&lt;U+00F3&gt;. Escobar won the fight by unanimous decision, while <a href="Jack_Dempsey" title="wikilink">Jack Dempsey</a> served as referee.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> He participated in Mike Jacobs's &quot;Carnival of Champions&quot; on September 23, 1937 and lost the title to <a href="Harry_Jeffra" title="wikilink">Harry Jeffra</a> by unanimous decision.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> Shortly after, he recovered from this loss and he returned to the gym; he defeated Johnny Defoe in a preparaty contest.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> On February 20, 1938, Escobar faced Jeffra in a rematch organized at the <em>El Escambr&lt;U+00F3&gt;n</em> baseball park in <a href="Puerta_de_Tierra,_Puerto_Rico" title="wikilink">Puerta de Tierra</a>. He won the contest by unanimous decision, scoring three knockdowns.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> This became an early example of fights that attracted the attention and criticism of boxing analists, particularly those in New York.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> On April 2, 1939, Escobar defeated Kayo Morgan before a sold-out crowd of 15,000 at the <em><a href="Estadio_Sixto_Escobar" title="wikilink">Estadio Sixto Escobar</a></em>, which had been inaugurated three years earlier.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> After this fight, he received <a href="The_Ring_(magazine)" title="wikilink"><em>The Ring</em></a> Bantamweight Championship, which was presented by the magazine's editor, <a href="Nat_Fleischer" title="wikilink">Nat Fleischer</a>.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> Later in 1939, Escobar received a draft notice from the <a href="United_States_Army" title="wikilink">United States Army</a>, ordering him to take a physical exam for possible military service.

Subsequently he returned to Puerto Rico where he worked selling liquor in bars. In May 1947, Escobar and Jim&lt;U+00E9&gt;nez Sicard&lt;U+00F3&gt; co-promoted a fight with the intention of bringing fans back to boxing.<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> In the main event, Diego Sosa was matched against Francisco Col&lt;U+00F3&gt;n Garc&lt;U+00ED&gt;a.

This contributed to the development of Escobar's alcoholic tendencies.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a> His alcoholism would later combine with his diabetes and contribute to his death when he was 66 years old.
