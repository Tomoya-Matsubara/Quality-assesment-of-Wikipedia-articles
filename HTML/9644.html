<p><strong>Television Broadcasts Limited</strong> (,), commonly known as <strong>TVB</strong>, was the first over-the-air commercial <a href="television_station" title="wikilink">television station</a> in <a href="Hong_Kong" title="wikilink">Hong Kong</a>.

<h2 id="development">Development</h2>
<p>TVB dominates most of the television market in Hong Kong, but it is not considered the powerhouse it used to be. It started in 1965 as a competitor to what was then called <a href="Rediffusion_Television" title="wikilink">Rediffusion Television</a>, later to become ATV, a cable operator that charged subscription fees for its operation, and the only terrestrial competitor to TVB One of the first show launched was <a href="Enjoy_Yourself_Tonight" title="wikilink">Enjoy Yourself Tonight</a> in 1967.</p>
<p>TVB receives praise for its programming from a wide range of demographics, including the middle class, as was the case with its 2004 historical drama series <em><a href="War_and_Beauty" title="wikilink">War and Beauty</a></em>. Its programme line-up features a steady stream of soap operas, variety shows and other populist fare.</p>
<p>TVB has been criticised for signing exclusive contracts with many local celebrities which restrict them from appearing on other local television stations. Hong Kong's Cable T.V. claims it is unfair competition (although <a href="Asia_Television_Ltd" title="wikilink">Asia Television Ltd</a>, another major television station in Hong Kong, disagrees). In fact, many artists do not have exclusive contracts with TVB and are free to show up in programmes produced by other local television stations or out-sourcing production houses.</p>
<p>The annual TVB Music Awards ceremony is one of the biggest for <a href="Cantopop" class="uri" title="wikilink">Cantopop</a> personalities. It is widely rumoured that TVB distributes the awards to those who are obedient to the company's demands, and the <a href="Independent_Commission_Against_Corruption_(Hong_Kong)" title="wikilink">Independent Commission Against Corruption (Hong Kong)</a> has investigated the arrangement of the awards.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> It ruled that three TVB staff members under scrutiny were not guilty. Afterwards, TVB reformed its music programmes in a bid to reestablish their authority.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p>On the other hand, TVB was awarded the <a href="National_Association_of_Broadcasters" title="wikilink">National Association of Broadcasters</a>'s (NAB) International Broadcasting Excellence Award in 2001. The award recognised the company's outstanding contributions to the community through a wide range of charitable programmes and activities. Hong Kong thus becomes the first city in Asia to receive this prestigious award in this area.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a><a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<p>In 2005, TVB, in association with the <a href="Hong_Kong_Jockey_Club" title="wikilink">Hong Kong Jockey Club</a>, organised the biggest fundraising campaign in the company's history in response to South-East Asia's recent tsunami. It raised over one hundred million <a href="Hong_Kong_Dollar" title="wikilink">Hong Kong dollars</a> to assist those affected.</p>
<p>From 31 March 2008, TVBS-Europe launched their &quot;Multi-channel&quot; package in Europe. It consists of 5 different channels which include the existing TVBS-Europe Channel plus the addition of TVBN, TVB Entertainment News, TVB Classic and TVB Lifestyle.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>

<p>To cope with future development and expansion, TVB began planning in 1998 to develop a replacement facility at the <a href="Tseung_Kwan_O_Industrial_Estate" title="wikilink">Tseung Kwan O Industrial Estate</a>.

</ul>
<h2 id="criticism">Criticism</h2>
<p>In 2009, TVB drew criticism on internet forums when its news department lightly dabbed the issue on 4th June Incident during the 20th Anniversary of the event. This was seen as a deliberate act to gain the favor of the Chinese Central Government, and to make their programming more acceptable by Chinese censors. Many mocked TVB that it had become &quot;<a href="China_Central_Television" title="wikilink">CCTVB</a>&quot;. TVB is also criticised for not reporting news that may harm their own interests, such as the mid-term review of both aTV's and TVB's broadcast licensing.</p>
<p>The standard of TVB's entertainment programmes, from soap operas to games shows, have also been criticised to be of reducing quality. Soap operas reflect less and less of the lives of the average Hong Kong citizen, and game shows are said to resort to the use of bad language and borderline eroticism, wastage of food and resources, and polluting the minds and children and adolescents.</p>
<p>TVB has also been criticised for being a copycat, copying many elements from the more successful shows on aTV, sometimes even copying the entire format of a show, such as <a href="Hong_Kong_Today" title="wikilink">Hong Kong Today</a>, with which TVB made <a href="Focus_on_Focus" title="wikilink">Focus on Focus</a>.</p>
