<p><strong>Hurricane Diane</strong> was the costliest <a href="Atlantic_hurricane" title="wikilink">Atlantic hurricane</a> of its time. One of three hurricanes to hit <a href="North_Carolina" title="wikilink">North Carolina</a> during the <a href="1955_Atlantic_hurricane_season" title="wikilink">1955 Atlantic hurricane season</a>, it <a href="tropical_cyclogenesis" title="wikilink">formed</a> on August 7 from a <a href="tropical_wave" title="wikilink">tropical wave</a> between the <a href="Lesser_Antilles" title="wikilink">Lesser Antilles</a> and <a href="Cape_Verde" title="wikilink">Cape Verde</a>. Diane initially moved west-northwestward with little change in its intensity, but began to <a href="rapid_deepening" title="wikilink">strengthen rapidly</a> after turning to the north-northeast. On August 12, the hurricane reached peak <a href="maximum_sustained_winds" title="wikilink">sustained winds</a> of 120 mph (195 km/h), making it a <a href="tropical_cyclone_scales" title="wikilink">major hurricane</a>.{{#tag:ref|A major hurricane is a tropical cyclone with <a href="maximum_sustained_winds" title="wikilink">maximum sustained winds</a> of at least 111 mph (179 km/h), or a Category 3 or higher on the <a href="Saffir-Simpson_Hurricane_Scale" title="wikilink">Saffir–Simpson hurricane scale</a>.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>|group=&quot;nb&quot;}} Gradually weakening after veering back west, Diane made <a href="landfall_(meteorology)" title="wikilink">landfall</a> near <a href="Wilmington,_North_Carolina" title="wikilink">Wilmington, North Carolina</a>, as a minimal hurricane on August 17, just five days after <a href="Hurricane_Connie" title="wikilink">Hurricane Connie</a> struck near the same area. Diane weakened further after moving inland, at which point the <a href="National_Oceanic_and_Atmospheric_Administration" title="wikilink">United States Weather Bureau</a> noted a decreased threat of further destruction. The storm turned to the northeast, and warm waters from the Atlantic Ocean helped produce record rainfall across the northeastern United States. On August 19, Diane emerged into the Atlantic Ocean southeast of New York City, becoming <a href="extratropical_cyclone" title="wikilink">extratropical</a> the next day and completely dissipating by August 21.</p>
<p>The first area affected by Diane was North Carolina, which suffered coastal flooding but little wind and rain damage. After the storm weakened in Virginia, it maintained an area of moisture that resulted in heavy rainfall after interacting with the <a href="Blue_Ridge_Mountains" title="wikilink">Blue Ridge Mountains</a>, a process known as <a href="orographic_lift" title="wikilink">orographic lift</a>. Flooding affecting roads and low-lying areas along the <a href="Potomac_River" title="wikilink">Potomac River</a>. The northernmost portion of Delaware also saw freshwater flooding, although to a much lesser extent than adjacent states. Diane produced heavy rainfall in eastern Pennsylvania, causing the worst floods on record there, largely in the <a href="Poconos" class="uri" title="wikilink">Poconos</a> and along the <a href="Delaware_River" title="wikilink">Delaware River</a>. Rushing waters demolished about 150 road and rail bridges and breached or destroyed 30 dams. The swollen <a href="Brodhead_Creek" title="wikilink">Brodhead Creek</a> virtually submerged a summer camp, killing 37 people. Throughout Pennsylvania, the disaster killed 101 people and caused an estimated $70 million in damage (1955 <a href="United_States_dollar" title="wikilink">USD</a>).{{#tag:ref|All damage totals are in 1955 <a href="United_States_dollar" title="wikilink">United States dollars</a> unless otherwise noted.|group=&quot;nb&quot;}} Additional flooding spread through the northwest portion of neighboring New Jersey, forcing hundreds of people to evacuate and destroying several bridges, including one built in 1831. Storm damage was evident but less significant in southeastern New York.</p>
<p>Damage from Diane was heaviest in Connecticut, where rainfall peaked at 16.86 in (428 mm) near <a href="Torrington,_Connecticut" title="wikilink">Torrington</a>. The storm produced the state's largest flood on record, which effectively split the state into two by destroying bridges and cutting communications. All major streams and valleys were flooded, and 30 <a href="stream_gauge" title="wikilink">stream gauges</a> reported their highest levels on record. The <a href="Connecticut_River" title="wikilink">Connecticut River</a> at <a href="Hartford,_Connecticut" title="wikilink">Hartford</a> reached a water level of 30.6 ft (9.3 m), the third highest on record there. The flooding destroyed a large section of downtown <a href="Winsted,_Connecticut" title="wikilink">Winsted</a>, much of which was never rebuilt. Record-high tides and flooded rivers heavily damaged <a href="Woonsocket,_Rhode_Island" title="wikilink">Woonsocket, Rhode Island</a>. In Massachusetts, flood water levels surpassed those during the <a href="1938_Long_Island_hurricane" title="wikilink">1938 Long Island hurricane</a>, breaching multiple dams and inundating adjacent towns and roads. Throughout New England, 206 dams were damaged or destroyed, and about 7,000 people were injured. Nationwide, Diane killed at least 184 people and destroyed 813 houses, with another 14,000 homes heavily damaged. Monetary losses totaled $754.7 million, although the inclusion of loss of business and personal revenue increased the total to over $1 billion. In the hurricane's wake, eight states were declared federal disaster areas, and the name Diane was <a href="List_of_retired_Atlantic_hurricane_names" title="wikilink">retired</a>.</p>
<h2 id="meteorological-history">Meteorological history</h2>

<p>Hurricane Diane originated in a <a href="tropical_wave" title="wikilink">tropical wave</a> first observed as a tropical depression on August 7 between the <a href="Lesser_Antilles" title="wikilink">Lesser Antilles</a> and <a href="Cape_Verde" title="wikilink">Cape Verde</a>.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> The system moved generally to the west-northwest, intensifying into a tropical storm on August 9.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> By the time it was first classified on August 10, Diane was south of the <a href="Azores_High" title="wikilink">Bermuda high</a>, a semi-permanent <a href="ridge_(meteorology)" title="wikilink">ridge in the jet stream</a> just east of <a href="Nova_Scotia" title="wikilink">Nova Scotia</a>. Ships in the region of the storm reported winds of . During the next day, the <a href="Hurricane_Hunters" title="wikilink">Hurricane Hunters</a> reported no increase in strength, and Diane initially remained disorganized.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> The storm interacted with <a href="Hurricane_Connie" title="wikilink">Hurricane Connie</a> to its northwest in a process known as the <a href="Fujiwhara_effect" title="wikilink">Fujiwhara effect</a>, in which Diane turned toward the north. Quick intensification ensued, potentially due to interaction with a <a href="cold-core_low" title="wikilink">cold-core low</a> that increased <a href="atmospheric_instability" title="wikilink">atmospheric instability</a>.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> On August 12, the storm <a href="rapid_deepening" title="wikilink">rapidly intensified</a> into a hurricane, and later that day reached peak winds of 120 mph (195 km/h),<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> as recorded by <a href="reconnaissance_aircraft" title="wikilink">reconnaissance aircraft</a>. The intensification was so quick that a ship southeast of the center believed Diane was undergoing a loop due to a steady drop in <a href="atmospheric_pressure" title="wikilink">barometric pressure</a>, despite moving away from the hurricane.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p>At its peak, Diane developed a well-defined <a href="eye_(cyclone)" title="wikilink">eye</a> about  in diameter, described by reconnaissance aircraft as taking the shape of an &quot;inverted teacup&quot;. The strongest winds were located in the northeast quadrant, where there was a secondary pressure minimum located  northeast of the eye.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> After moving to the north for about a day, Diane resumed its westward motion on August 13, after Hurricane Connie to the northwest had weakened. That day, Diane reached its lowest pressure of .<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> It maintained its peak winds for about 54 hours,<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> after which it weakened due to cooler air in the region. By August 15, the eye had become poorly defined, and winds steadily weakened. As it approached land, its center deteriorated, with minimal precipitation near the center; the eye was observed on a radar installed in July 1955. On August 17, Diane made <a href="landfall_(meteorology)" title="wikilink">landfall</a> on the coast of <a href="North_Carolina" title="wikilink">North Carolina</a> near <a href="Wilmington,_North_Carolina" title="wikilink">Wilmington</a>.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> Pressure at landfall was estimated at , accompanied by winds equivalent to Category 1 intensity on the <a href="Saffir-Simpson_hurricane_scale" title="wikilink">Saffir-Simpson hurricane scale</a>.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> Diane struck the state only five days after Hurricane Connie struck the same general area.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<p>Diane quickly weakened into a tropical storm over the mountainous terrain of central North Carolina.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> The associated area of precipitation expanded and spread away from the center to the north and northeast.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> The weakening system turned to the north and recurved toward the northeast through Virginia after a ridge built in from the west.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> It did not interact much with the non-tropical <a href="westerlies" class="uri" title="wikilink">westerlies</a>, and as a result it remained a distinct tropical cyclone over land. Convection redeveloped as the storm approached the Atlantic coast once again.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> Diane passed through the <a href="Mid-Atlantic_states" title="wikilink">Mid-Atlantic states</a>, exiting New Jersey on August 19 into the Atlantic Ocean southeast of New York City. Paralleling the southern coast of <a href="New_England" title="wikilink">New England</a>, the storm later accelerated east-northeastward, becoming <a href="extratropical_cyclone" title="wikilink">extratropical</a> on August 20. Diane dissipated the next day while southeast of <a href="Newfoundland_(island)" title="wikilink">Newfoundland</a>.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
