<h3 id="origin-of-the-name">Origin of the name</h3>
<p>Hints about the derivation of the name <em>Radyr</em> can be found in Lifris's writings &quot;Life of St Cadog&quot; written between 1081 and 1104 but relating to the earlier period around 530 AD, which mentions a croft or &quot;tref&quot; on the site called <em>Aradur Hen</em>. Lifris also tells the story of <em>Tylyway</em>, a religious hermit who was held to have lived on the banks of the Taff. Tylyway's cell is the most likely origin of the name Radyr; from the Welsh <em>yr adur</em>, meaning &quot;the chantry&quot;, although <em>Arudur Hen</em> is also possible.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>

<p>Successful <a href="Tudor_dynasty" title="wikilink">Tudor</a> nobles were expected to have extensive <a href="Medieval_deer_park" title="wikilink">deer parks</a>, but Sir George created a deer park that partially caused the decline of the family fortune, as it ranged so far to the north of Radyr it caused the previous income from tenant farmers to cease when they were evicted from their farms.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> He also had twenty-four children, (eight of whom were illegitimate).

<p>The new owner of Radyr was wealthy landowner Sir Edward Lewis,<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> who was knighted by <a href="James_I_of_England" title="wikilink">King James I</a>.

<h3 id="development-from-the-18th-century">Development from the 18th century</h3>
<p>Built in 1749, the Melingriffith <a href="Tinplate" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tinplate</a> Works just across the <a href="River_Taff" title="wikilink">River Taff</a> from Radyr was built on or near the site of an old corn mill that had operated as far back as the late 1100s. Melingriffith was the largest working tin factory in the UK, until the much later construction of the Treforest Tin Works. People in Radyr would set their watches by the sound of the works hooters, which were also sounded to see in the new year.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> The tinplate works became the major employer for workers from Radyr and would remain so for nearly two hundred years. <img src="Melingriffith_feeder_stream.jpg" title="fig:Melingriffith Feeder" alt="Melingriffith Feeder" /> The tin mills were powered exclusively by water drawn from the River Taff down the Melingriffith feeder stream, a water course that doubled as a <a href="canal" class="uri" title="wikilink">canal</a> that carried raw <a href="iron_ore" title="wikilink">iron ore</a> from the Pentyrch Iron Works until around 1815, when the Pentyrch tramroad was completed.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> The tramroad crossed the River Taff over the Iron Bridge. The feeder&lt;U+2019&gt;s lock was permanently closed in 1871 when it was bridged over, but traces of it still remain.</p>
<p>The tin works closed in 1957,<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> and today the only signs that the works ever existed at all are the mostly dry bed of the original Melingriffith feeder stream that still runs down from the River Taff from just above the Radyr weir, and the recently restored water pump standing opposite Oak Cottage. The works site itself has been completely cleared, and is now a modern housing estate. <img src="Melingriffith_Water_Pump.jpg" title="fig:Melingriffith water pump" alt="Melingriffith water pump" /> The Melingriffith feeder stream made its way to the original <a href="Glamorganshire_Canal" title="wikilink">Glamorganshire Canal</a>, where they ran in parallel through the Tin Works and out the other side at Melingriffith Lock. Where they had come together north of the Tin Works, any overflow from the Canal was originally designed to empty into the feeder. This point is now at the southern end of the Glamorganshire Canal Local Nature Reserve and all the water from the canal runs into the feeder before disappearing into a piped water course that passes under the modern housing estate.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a></p>
<p>At the southern end of the housing estate, the feeder re-emerges at the point where the Melingriffith water pump stands, the pump originally designed to lift water from the bottom of the feeder back into the Canal at Melingriffith Lock.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> Today, the Glamorganshire Canal has been almost totally overbuilt. Ty Mawr Road has replaced the route of the canal from Melingriffith all the way to Whitchurch.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a></p>
<p>Samual Lewis says in his 1849 &quot;Topographical Dictionary of Wales&quot; says of Radyr:<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;A parish, in the poorlaw union of Cardiff, hundred of Kibbor, county of Glamorgan, in South Wales, 3&lt;U+00BD&gt; miles (N. W. by W.) from Cardiff; containing 279 inhabitants. This parish probably derives its name, signifying &quot;a cataract,&quot; from the rushing waters of the river T&lt;U+00E2&gt;f, by which it is bounded on the north-east. It was formerly comprehended within the hundred of Miskin, but has been recently separated therefrom. It comprises about eleven hundred acres of arable and pasture land, inclosed and in a profitable state of cultivation: the surface is in some parts elevated, and in others flat, but no where subject to inundation; the soil is a strong brown earth, favourable to the production of good crops of grain of all kinds, potatoes, and hay. The substratum is partly a hard brown stone, and partly limestone of very good quality. Radyr Court, formerly the seat of the family of Matthew, ancestors of the late Lord Llandaf, has been partially taken down, and the remainder has been modernised, and converted into a farmhouse. The turnpike-road leading from Cardiff to Llantrissent passes a little to the south of the parish; and the T&lt;U+00E2&gt;f-Vale railway runs through it, nearly parallel with the river, which is crossed by the line in this vicinity. Some of the inhabitants are employed at the iron-works in the parish of Pentyrch.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>The living is a vicarage, endowed with &lt;U+00A3&gt;200 royal bounty; patron and impropriator, the representative of the late Earl of Plymouth, who is lord of the manor: the tithes have been commuted for &lt;U+00A3&gt;113. 9s. 0d, of which a sum of &lt;U+00A3&gt;38. 9s. 0d is payable to the impropriator, and a sum of &lt;U+00A3&gt;75 to the vicar. The church, dedicated to St. John the Baptist, is a neat plain edifice, with a curious turret at the west end. There is a place of worship for Calvinistic Methodists; a Sunday school for gratuitous instruction is held in it, and another at Radyr Court. In the parish is a spring of very cold water, called Y Pistyll Goleu, &quot;the bright water-spout,&quot; issuing from the side of a hill, under a considerable depth of earth over a limestone rock: it has by some writers been termed mineral, but it is not known to possess any other properties than that of its extreme coldness, which renders it efficacious in curing sprains and weakness of the sinews.&quot;</em></p>

Since 1986 all maintenance and development of the reserve has been carried out by a volunteer group known as The Friends of Radyr Woods.<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="radyr-hawkweed">Radyr Hawkweed</h3>
<p><img src="Radyr_Hawkweed.JPG" title="fig:Radyr Hawkweed" alt="Radyr Hawkweed" /> Radyr Hawkweed is the common name of <em><a href="Hieracium_radyrense" title="wikilink">Hieracium radyrense</a></em>, a very rare <a href="endemism" title="wikilink">endemic</a> species related to the <a href="Asteraceae" title="wikilink">aster, daisy, or sunflower family</a>, so far only identified with Radyr, originally at the quarry. First identified in 1907 it was described as a variety in 1948 and a separate species in 1955 and belongs to Hieracium Section Vulgata. It has rarely been seen and regular surveys between 1998 and 2004 indicate that today only a single population of around twenty five plants survives in the wild.<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a></p>
<p>In the first survey during 1998, a total of just nine plants were then identified in one single Radyr garden, where it traditionally grew on grassy banks and lawns, often in shade. It was no longer found at the original locality of Radyr Quarry where examples were last seen in 1985. At <a href="Bridgend" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bridgend</a>, six possible plants of the Radyr genus were found on an old garden wall, but confirmation of identification is still awaited.<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a></p>
<p>Neither the species nor the sites have any current legal protection, and it could be under significant threat of survival in the long term from inappropriate gardening or care.<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a> Seed samples of the Radyr Hawkweed have been provided to the <a href="Millennium_Seed_Bank" title="wikilink">Millennium Seed Bank</a>, the international <a href="conservation_biology" title="wikilink">conservation</a> project coordinated by the <a href="Royal_Botanic_Gardens,_Kew" title="wikilink">Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew</a>, and plants are being carefully cultivated.<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a> The plant normally flowers between May and early July and Radyr residents are urged by botanists to be on the look out for further examples of the endangered species while walking in the area.</p>
