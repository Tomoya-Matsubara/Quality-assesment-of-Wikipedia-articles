<p><strong>George VI</strong> (Albert Frederick Arthur George; 14 December 1895 &lt;U+2013&gt; 6 February 1952) was <a href="Monarchy_of_the_United_Kingdom" title="wikilink">King of the United Kingdom</a> and the <a href="Dominion" title="wikilink">Dominions</a> of the <a href="Commonwealth_of_Nations" title="wikilink">British Commonwealth</a> from 11 December 1936 until his death. He was the last <a href="Emperor_of_India" title="wikilink">Emperor of India</a> and the first <a href="Head_of_the_Commonwealth" title="wikilink">Head of the Commonwealth</a>.</p>
<p>As the second son of <a href="George_V" title="wikilink">King George V</a>, he was not expected to inherit the throne and spent his early life in the shadow of his elder brother, <a href="Edward_VIII" title="wikilink">Edward</a>. He served in the <a href="Royal_Navy" title="wikilink">Royal Navy</a> and <a href="Royal_Air_Force" title="wikilink">Royal Air Force</a> during the <a href="World_War_I" title="wikilink">First World War</a>, and afterward took on the usual round of public engagements. He married <a href="Queen_Elizabeth_The_Queen_Mother" title="wikilink">Lady Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon</a> in 1923 and they had two daughters, <a href="Elizabeth_II" title="wikilink">Elizabeth</a> and <a href="Princess_Margaret,_Countess_of_Snowdon" title="wikilink">Margaret</a>.</p>
<p>George's elder brother ascended the throne as Edward VIII upon the death of their father in 1936. However, later that year Edward revealed his desire to marry the divorced American socialite <a href="Wallis_Simpson" title="wikilink">Wallis Simpson</a>. British Prime Minister <a href="Stanley_Baldwin" title="wikilink">Stanley Baldwin</a> advised Edward that for political and religious reasons he could not marry a divorced woman and remain king. <a href="Edward_VIII_abdication_crisis" title="wikilink">Edward abdicated</a> in order to marry, and George ascended the throne as the third monarch of the <a href="House_of_Windsor" title="wikilink">House of Windsor</a>.</p>
<p>During George's reign the break-up of the <a href="British_Empire" title="wikilink">British Empire</a> and its transition into the <a href="Commonwealth_of_Nations" title="wikilink">Commonwealth of Nations</a> accelerated. The parliament of the <a href="Irish_Free_State" title="wikilink">Irish Free State</a> <a href="Constitution_(Amendment_No._27)_Act_1936" title="wikilink">removed</a> direct mention of the monarch from <a href="Constitution_of_the_Irish_Free_State" title="wikilink">the country's constitution</a> on the day of his accession. Within three years, the Empire and Commonwealth, except the Irish Free State, was at <a href="World_War_II" title="wikilink">war</a> with <a href="Nazi_Germany" title="wikilink">Nazi Germany</a>. In the next two years, war with <a href="Kingdom_of_Italy_(1861&lt;U+2013&gt;1946)" title="wikilink">Italy</a> and <a href="Empire_of_Japan" title="wikilink">Japan</a> followed. Though <a href="Allies_of_World_War_II" title="wikilink">Britain and its allies</a> were ultimately victorious, the United States and the <a href="Soviet_Union" title="wikilink">Soviet Union</a> rose as pre-eminent <a href="superpower" title="wikilink">world powers</a> and the British Empire declined. After the <a href="Indian_Independence_Act_1947" title="wikilink">independence of India and Pakistan</a> in 1947, George remained as king of both countries, but the title <em>Emperor of India</em> was abandoned in June 1948. Ireland <a href="Republic_of_Ireland_Act_1948" title="wikilink">formally declared itself a republic</a> and left the Commonwealth in 1949, and India became a republic within the Commonwealth the following year. George adopted the new title of Head of the Commonwealth. He was beset by health problems in the later years of his reign. His elder daughter, Elizabeth, succeeded him.</p>

His mother was the Duchess of York (later <a href="Mary_of_Teck" title="wikilink">Queen Mary</a>), the eldest child and only daughter of <a href="Francis,_Duke_of_Teck" title="wikilink">the Duke</a> and <a href="Princess_Mary_Adelaide_of_Cambridge" title="wikilink">Duchess of Teck</a>.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>His birthday (14 December 1895) was the anniversary of the death of his great-grandfather, <a href="Albert,_Prince_Consort" title="wikilink">Prince Albert, the Prince Consort</a>.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> Uncertain of how the Prince Consort's widow, Queen Victoria, would take the news of the birth, the Prince of Wales wrote to the Duke of York that the Queen had been &quot;rather distressed&quot;. Two days later, he wrote again: &quot;I really think it would gratify her if you yourself proposed the name <em>Albert</em> to her&quot;.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> Queen Victoria was mollified by the proposal to name the new baby Albert, and wrote to the Duchess of York: &quot;I am all impatience to see the <em>new</em> one, born on such a sad day but rather more dear to me, especially as he will be called by that dear name which is a byword for all that is great and good&quot;.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> Consequently, he was <a href="baptism" title="wikilink">baptised</a> &quot;Albert Frederick Arthur George&quot; at <a href="St._Mary_Magdalene_Church,_Sandringham" title="wikilink">St. Mary Magdalene's Church</a> near Sandringham three months later. As a great-grandson of Queen Victoria, he was known formally as &quot;His Highness Prince Albert of York&quot; from birth. Within the family, he was known informally as &quot;Bertie&quot;.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> His maternal grandmother, the Duchess of Teck, did not like the first name the baby had been given, and she wrote prophetically that she hoped the last name &quot;may supplant the less favoured one&quot;.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p>Albert, as he was known, was fourth in line to the throne at birth, after his grandfather, father and elder brother, <a href="Edward_VIII" title="wikilink">Edward</a>. In 1898, Queen Victoria issued <a href="letters_patent" title="wikilink">Letters Patent</a> that granted the children of the eldest son of the Prince of Wales the <a href="Style_(manner_of_address)" title="wikilink">style</a> <em><a href="Royal_Highness" title="wikilink">Royal Highness</a></em>, and at the age of two, Albert became &quot;His Royal Highness Prince Albert of York&quot;.</p>
<p>He often suffered from ill health and was described as &quot;easily frightened and somewhat prone to tears&quot;.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> His parents were generally removed from their children's day-to-day upbringing, as was the norm in aristocratic families of that era. He had a <a href="stutter" title="wikilink">stammer</a> that lasted for many years, and was forced to write with his right hand although he was naturally <a href="Left-handedness" title="wikilink">left-handed</a>. He suffered from chronic stomach problems as well as <a href="genu_valgum" title="wikilink">knock knees</a>, for which he was forced to wear painful corrective splints.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<p>Queen Victoria died on 22 January 1901, and the Prince of Wales succeeded her as King Edward VII. Prince Albert moved up to third-in-line to the throne, after his father and elder brother.</p>

<p>From 1909, Albert attended the <a href="Osborne_House" title="wikilink">Royal Naval College, Osborne</a>, as a naval <a href="cadet" class="uri" title="wikilink">cadet</a>. In 1911, he came bottom of the class in the final examination, but despite this he progressed to the <a href="Britannia_Royal_Naval_College" title="wikilink">Royal Naval College, Dartmouth</a>.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> When Edward VII died in 1910, Albert's father became King George V.

His fellow officers gave him the nickname &quot;Mr. Johnson&quot;.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> One year after his commission, he began service in the First World War. He was <a href="mentioned_in_despatches" title="wikilink">mentioned in despatches</a> for his action as a turret officer aboard <em>Collingwood</em> in the <a href="Battle_of_Jutland" title="wikilink">Battle of Jutland</a> (31 May &lt;U+2013&gt; 1 June 1916), an indecisive engagement with the <a href="German_Empire" title="wikilink">German</a> <a href="Imperial_German_Navy" title="wikilink">navy</a> that was the largest naval action of the war. He did not see further combat, largely because of ill health caused by a <a href="peptic_ulcer" title="wikilink">duodenal ulcer</a>, for which he had an operation in November 1917.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<p>In February 1918, he was appointed Officer in Charge of Boys at the <a href="Royal_Naval_Air_Service" title="wikilink">Royal Naval Air Service</a>'s training establishment at <a href="RAF_Cranwell" title="wikilink">Cranwell</a>.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> With the establishment of the <a href="Royal_Air_Force" title="wikilink">Royal Air Force</a> two months later and the transfer of Cranwell from Navy to Air Force control, he transferred from the Royal Navy to the Royal Air Force.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> He was appointed Officer Commanding Number 4 Squadron of the Boys' Wing at Cranwell until August 1918,<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> before reporting to the RAF's Cadet School at <a href="St_Leonards-on-Sea" title="wikilink">St Leonards-on-Sea</a> where he completed a fortnight's training and took command of a squadron on the Cadet Wing.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> He was the first member of the royal family to be certified as a fully qualified pilot.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> During the closing weeks of the war, he served on the staff of the RAF's <a href="Independent_Air_Force" title="wikilink">Independent Air Force</a> at its headquarters in <a href="Nancy,_France" title="wikilink">Nancy, France</a>.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> Following the disbanding of the Independent Air Force in November 1918, he remained on the Continent for two months as a staff officer with the Royal Air Force until posted back to Britain.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a></p>
<p>In October 1919, Albert went up to <a href="Trinity_College,_Cambridge" title="wikilink">Trinity College, Cambridge</a>, where he studied history, economics and civics for a year.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> On 4 June 1920, he was created <a href="Duke_of_York" title="wikilink">Duke of York</a>, <a href="Earl_of_Inverness" title="wikilink">Earl of Inverness</a> and <a href="Baron_Killarney" title="wikilink">Baron Killarney</a>.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> He began to take on more royal duties. He represented his father, and toured coal mines, factories, and railyards. Through such visits he acquired the nickname of the &quot;Industrial Prince&quot;.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> His stammer, and his embarrassment over it, together with his tendency to shyness, caused him to appear much less impressive than his older brother, Edward. However, he was physically active and enjoyed playing tennis.

<h2 id="marriage">Marriage</h2>

<p>In a time when royals were expected to marry fellow royals, it was unusual that Albert had a great deal of freedom in choosing a prospective wife. An infatuation with the already-married Australian socialite <a href="Sheila_Chisholm" title="wikilink">Sheila, Lady Loughborough</a>, came to an end in April 1920 when the King, with the promise of the dukedom of York, persuaded Albert to stop seeing her.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a><a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> That year, he met for the first time since childhood Lady <a href="Queen_Elizabeth_The_Queen_Mother" title="wikilink">Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon</a>, the youngest daughter of <a href="Claude_Bowes-Lyon,_14th_Earl_of_Strathmore_and_Kinghorne" title="wikilink">the Earl</a> and <a href="Cecilia_Bowes-Lyon,_Countess_of_Strathmore_and_Kinghorne" title="wikilink">Countess of Strathmore and Kinghorne</a>. He became determined to marry her.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> She rejected his proposal twice, in 1921 and 1922, reportedly because she was reluctant to make the sacrifices necessary to become a member of the royal family.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> In the words of Lady Elizabeth's mother, Albert would be &quot;made or marred&quot; by his choice of wife. After a protracted courtship, Elizabeth agreed to marry him.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a></p>
<p>They were married on 26 April 1923 in <a href="Westminster_Abbey" title="wikilink">Westminster Abbey</a>.

The Duke and Logue practised breathing exercises, and the Duchess rehearsed with him patiently.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> Subsequently, he was able to speak with less hesitation.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> With his delivery improved, the Duke opened the new <a href="Old_Parliament_House,_Canberra" title="wikilink">Parliament House</a> in <a href="Canberra" class="uri" title="wikilink">Canberra</a>, Australia, during a tour of the empire in 1927.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> His journey by sea to Australia, New Zealand and Fiji took him via Jamaica, where Albert played doubles tennis partnered with a black man, which was unusual at the time and taken locally as a display of equality between races.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a></p>
<p>The Duke and Duchess of York had two children: <a href="Elizabeth_II" title="wikilink">Elizabeth</a> (called &quot;Lilibet&quot; by the family), and <a href="Princess_Margaret,_Countess_of_Snowdon" title="wikilink">Margaret</a>. The Duke and Duchess and their two daughters lived a relatively sheltered life at their London residence, 145 <a href="Piccadilly" class="uri" title="wikilink">Piccadilly</a>.

<p>As Edward was unmarried and had no children, Albert was the <a href="heir_presumptive" title="wikilink">heir presumptive</a> to the throne. Less than a year later, on 11 December 1936, Edward VIII <a href="Edward_VIII_abdication_crisis" title="wikilink">abdicated</a> in order to marry his mistress, <a href="Wallis_Simpson" title="wikilink">Wallis Simpson</a>, who was divorced from her first husband and divorcing her second. Edward had been advised by British Prime Minister <a href="Stanley_Baldwin" title="wikilink">Stanley Baldwin</a> that he could not remain king and marry a divorced woman with two living ex-husbands. Edward chose abdication in preference to abandoning his marriage plans. Thus Albert became king, a position he was reluctant to accept.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> The day before the abdication, he went to London to see his mother, <a href="Mary_of_Teck" title="wikilink">Queen Mary</a>.

<p>On the day of the abdication, the <a href="Oireachtas" class="uri" title="wikilink">Oireachtas</a>, the parliament of the <a href="Irish_Free_State" title="wikilink">Irish Free State</a>, <a href="Constitution_(Amendment_No._27)_Act_1936" title="wikilink">removed all direct mention of the monarch</a> from the <a href="Constitution_of_the_Irish_Free_State" title="wikilink">Irish constitution</a>. The next day, it passed the <a href="Executive_Authority_(External_Relations)_Act_1936" title="wikilink">External Relations Act</a>, which made provision for the monarch to act as the state's representative in foreign affairs. The two acts made the Irish Free State a republic in essence without removing its links to the Commonwealth.<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a></p>
<p>Courtier and journalist Dermot Morrah alleged that there was brief speculation as to the desirability of bypassing Albert (and his children) and his brother, <a href="Prince_Henry,_Duke_of_Gloucester" title="wikilink">Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester</a>, in favour of their younger brother <a href="Prince_George,_Duke_of_Kent" title="wikilink">Prince George, Duke of Kent</a>.

He had been introduced as &quot;His Royal Highness Prince Edward&quot; for the abdication broadcast,<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a> but George VI felt that by abdicating and renouncing the succession Edward had lost the right to bear royal titles, including &quot;Royal Highness&quot;.<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a> In settling the issue, George's first act as king was to confer upon his brother the title and style &quot;His Royal Highness The <a href="Duke_of_Windsor" title="wikilink">Duke of Windsor</a>&quot;, but the <a href="letters_patent" title="wikilink">Letters Patent</a> creating the dukedom prevented any wife or children from bearing royal styles. George VI was also forced to buy from Edward the royal residences of <a href="Balmoral_Castle" title="wikilink">Balmoral Castle</a> and <a href="Sandringham_House" title="wikilink">Sandringham House</a>, as these were private properties and did not pass to George VI automatically.<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a> Three days after his accession, on his 41st birthday, he invested his wife, the new <a href="queen_consort" title="wikilink">queen consort</a>, with the <a href="Order_of_the_Garter" title="wikilink">Order of the Garter</a>.<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a></p>

<p>In May and June 1939, the <a href="1939_royal_tour_of_Canada" title="wikilink">King and Queen toured Canada</a> and the United States.
