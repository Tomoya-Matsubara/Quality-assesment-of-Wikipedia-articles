<p><strong>One Rincon Hill</strong> is a <a href="residential" class="uri" title="wikilink">residential</a> complex that is currently under <a href="construction" class="uri" title="wikilink">construction</a> on the apex of <a href="Rincon_Hill" title="wikilink">Rincon Hill</a> in <a href="San_Francisco,_California" title="wikilink">San Francisco</a>, <a href="California" class="uri" title="wikilink">California</a>, <a href="United_States" title="wikilink">United States</a>. The complex, designed by Solomon, Cordwell, Buenz and Associates and developed by Urban West Associates, consists of two <a href="skyscraper" title="wikilink">skyscrapers</a> that share a common <a href="townhouse" class="uri" title="wikilink">townhouse</a> podium. One tower, <em>One Rincon Hill North Tower</em>, is planned to reach a height 495 feet (151 m) with 45 <a href="Floor" title="wikilink">stories</a>.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> The other tower, <em>One Rincon Hill South Tower</em>, is 60 stories and stands 641 feet (195 m) tall. The South Tower contains a number of unique elements, such as high-speed elevations and a large water tank, designed to move residents effectively and help the skyscraper survive high-winds and <a href="earthquake" title="wikilink">earthquakes</a>, respectively. Both skyscrapers and the townhomes contain a total of 709 residential units.</p>
<p>The building site, located right next to the western approach of the <a href="San_Francisco_&lt;U+2013&gt;_Oakland_Bay_Bridge" title="wikilink">San Francisco &lt;U+2013&gt; Oakland Bay Bridge</a>, formerly contained a clock tower. The clock tower was demolished shortly after the city approved the One Rincon Hill project. Construction of the townhomes and the South Tower lasted from 2005 to 2008, but was stopped for brief periods of time due to seismic concerns and a construction accident. As the South Tower neared completion, it generated controversy concerning blocked views, pricing, and the architectural style of the One Rincon Hill complex.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>

<p>The complex is located on a 1.3 <a href="acre" class="uri" title="wikilink">acre</a> (0.5 <a href="hectare" title="wikilink">ha</a>)<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> on the apex of the Rincon Hill neighborhood. The site is bounded by Harrison Street to the west, the Fremont Street <a href="exit_ramp" title="wikilink">exit ramp</a> to the north, the western approach to the Bay Bridge (Interstate 80) on the east, and the First Street <a href="entrance_ramp" title="wikilink">entrance ramp</a> to the south.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a><a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>

<dt>Developer and architect</dt>

</dl>
<p>Solomon, Cordwell, Buenz and Associates, an architectural firm from <a href="Chicago" class="uri" title="wikilink">Chicago</a>, designed the complex. The developer of this complex is Urban West Associates, headed by Mike Kriozere.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> The developer's headquarters are located in <a href="San_Diego,_California" title="wikilink">San Diego</a>, although all its highrise projects over 14 stories are located in the San Francisco Bay Area.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> The Rincon Hill complex is the developer's second project in San Francisco, with the first being ONE Embarcadero South, a residential complex located near One Rincon Hill and across from <a href="AT&amp;T_Park" title="wikilink">AT&amp;T Park</a>.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> According to the developer, the total cost of the Rincon Hill project was <a href="United_States_dollar" title="wikilink">USD</a> $290 million,<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> rising to USD $300 million in 2008.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>

<p>The complex consists of two buildings joined together at the base by a row of townhomes. The South Tower and North Tower rise  and  above the corner of Fremont and Harrison streets, respectively. The North Tower contains 45 floors, while the South Tower contains 60.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> However, because of the sloped nature of the Rincon Hill site, the South Tower's lobby floor or the First Street entrance is located on the sixth floor, and the first floor is five levels underground from the First Street entrance.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> The skyscraper is one of the most significant additions to the San Francisco skyline in over 30 years.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a><a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> It is also one of the tallest all-residential towers west of the Mississippi River, towering 697 feet (212 m) above <a href="San_Francisco_Bay" title="wikilink">San Francisco Bay</a>.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a><a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a><a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>

<dt>Earthquake engineering</dt>

</dl>
<p>In order to support the 60 story condo tower, One Rincon Hill South Tower will have a 12 foot (4 m) thick massive foundation embedded deep into <a href="serpentine" class="uri" title="wikilink">serpentine</a> rock. Although some engineers view serpentine rock with suspicion, there are massive structures, such as the <a href="Golden_Gate_Bridge" title="wikilink">Golden Gate Bridge</a>, that have foundations on rock that is largely serpentine.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> Rising out of the foundation are the concrete core and large, tall columns of steel-reinforced concrete called outriggers. The core is attached to large outrigger columns by steel-buckling restrained braces that are designed to transfer building loads in an earthquake. These V-shaped restraining braces are said to act like a shock-absorber during earthquakes. The braces are also encased in a concrete and steel casing in order to prevent the braces from buckling and losing their strength. Many of these engineering technologies used in One Rincon Hill South Tower are new to the United States.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a><a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a></p>
<dl>
<dt>Water tanks</dt>

</dl>
<p>At the top of the building is a large tank, capable of holding up to 50,000 <a href="gallon" title="wikilink">gallons</a> (189,250 <a href="litre" title="wikilink">litres</a>) of water, which will weigh 416,500 <a href="pound_(mass)" title="wikilink">pounds</a> (185,440 kg).<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a><a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> A similar 50,000 gallon (189,250 liter) tank is located in the basement for firefighting purposes.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> There are two liquid damper screens in each tank to control the flow of the water in order to counter the sway from the powerful <a href="Pacific_Ocean" title="wikilink">Pacific</a> winds, which can sometimes reach hurricane-force.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a></p>
<dl>
<dt>Elevators</dt>

</dl>
<p>The South Tower contains one freight elevator and three for residents to use. The elevators are the second fastest in the city of San Francisco, second only to those in <a href="555_California_Street" title="wikilink">555 California Street</a> and tied with those in <a href="555_Mission_Street" title="wikilink">555 Mission Street</a>.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> Nevertheless, the elevators of the South Tower can travel from the first floor to level 61 (the mechanical level) in only 26 seconds to speed passenger traffic flow. This means the elevators can travel about 1,200 vertical feet (366 m) in a minute. In addition to the high speed, the elevators come equipped with artificial intelligence control systems. These systems figure out passenger traffic patterns and dispatch the three elevators to handle passenger needs accordingly. For safety purposes, the bottom of each elevator shaft has a cylinder filled with hydraulic oil to stop a falling elevator without injuring the passengers inside.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a></p>

<p>Three months after San Francisco approved of the project, construction began on the South Tower and townhouses with a groundbreaking ceremony on November 10, 2005. The South Tower was the <a href="List_of_tallest_buildings_in_San_Francisco#Under_construction" title="wikilink">second-tallest tower under construction</a> in San Francisco. However, building work began without an approved construction permit from the city's Department of Building Inspection and Construction, and city engineers stopped the project.</p>

<p>About a month after the ceremonial groundbreaking in November 2005, the project was put on hold by San Francisco's Department of Building Inspection and Construction.<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a><a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a> In addition, about a week after the ceremonial groundbreaking, department Chief Engineer Hanson Tom ordered that construction permits cannot be issued without his authorization.<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a> This construction hold came about when staff members of the Department of Building Inspection wanted further assurances about the seismic integrity of One Rincon Hill. Their concerns focused on the core-outrigger structural system of One Rincon Hill, which was new to the city of San Francisco.<a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a> After additional review, San Francisco's city officials agreed with the structural engineers and construction permits were issued in January 2006, although the <em><a href="San_Francisco_Chronicle" title="wikilink">San Francisco Chronicle</a></em> reported this over a month later.<a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a><a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a><a href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a></p>

<h2 id="criticism">Criticism</h2>
<p>With condo prices set at USD $5-600,000 to USD $2,000,000, many critics have noted that the One Rincon Hill complex is too expensive for most San Franciscans.<a href="#fn78" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref78"><sup>78</sup></a><a href="#fn79" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref79"><sup>79</sup></a> (As stated above, the total initial development cost was $290 million, so the average development cost per unit with 709 units total is approximately $409,000.) In addition, few construction workers currently building the south tower can afford to purchase a unit in the tower.<a href="#fn80" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref80"><sup>80</sup></a> However, the developer Urban West Associates has contributed a total of USD $38.5 million to funds like the South of Market Community Stabilization Fund in order to address this concern.<a href="#fn81" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref81"><sup>81</sup></a></p>

</figure>
<p>The height and placement of the South Tower is also a concern to residents living east to northeast of <a href="Twin_Peaks,_San_Francisco,_California" title="wikilink">Twin Peaks</a>, because new building projects in the <a href="South_of_Market" title="wikilink">South of Market</a> district are located on the line of sight between the Bay Bridge and Twin Peaks.<a href="#fn82" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref82"><sup>82</sup></a><a href="#fn83" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref83"><sup>83</sup></a> One Rincon Hill South Tower has obstructed the view of the bridge from <a href="Dolores_Park" title="wikilink">Dolores Park</a> and the hillside neighborhoods to its immediate south-southwest.

<p>The building's architectural design generated a wide range of opinions.<a href="#fn85" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref85"><sup>85</sup></a> Some residents of San Francisco and bloggers of the website SocketSite regarded the South Tower as an elegant structure.
