<p><strong>Tourism in the Republic of Ireland</strong> is one of the biggest contributors to the <a href="Economy_of_the_Republic_of_Ireland" title="wikilink">Economy of the Republic of Ireland</a>, with over 6.3 million people visiting the country in 2012, about 1.4 times Ireland's population.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> Each year about &lt;U+20AC&gt;5bn in revenue is made from economic activities directly related to tourists, accounting for about 4% of <a href="gross_national_product" title="wikilink">GNP</a> and employing over 200,000 people.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a><a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> In 2011 alone, Ireland was voted 'Favourite holiday destination in the World' by readers of <a href="Frommer&#39;s" title="wikilink">Frommer's Guide</a>, <a href="Lonely_Planet" title="wikilink">Lonely Planet</a> listed Ireland as the world's friendliest country and <a href="Cork_City" title="wikilink">Cork City</a> as one of the top ten cities in the world and the Irish tourist boards website, DiscoverIreland.com, was named the best tourist board website in the world.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a><a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> Most tourists visiting Ireland come from the United Kingdom, the United States, Germany and France.</p>
<h2 id="transport-in-ireland">Transport in Ireland</h2>

<p>Ireland's national flag carrier is Aer Lingus, which services Europe, North America and North Africa, but the vast majority of flights originating from continental Europe come from another Irish company, <a href="Ryanair" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ryanair</a>, the biggest low cost airline in the world. These airlines, along with others, fly into all three of Ireland's international airports, <a href="Shannon_Airport" title="wikilink">Shannon Airport</a>, <a href="Dublin_Airport" title="wikilink">Dublin Airport</a> and <a href="Cork_Airport" title="wikilink">Cork Airport</a>. Dublin Airport is by far the busiest, accounting for over 80% of passenger entering and leaving Ireland in 2011.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> Along with these airports there are several other regional airports in the country including <a href="Knock_Airport" title="wikilink">Knock Airport</a> and <a href="Kerry_Airport" title="wikilink">Kerry Airport</a>, which both operate international flights to Europe.<br />
For travellers from mainland Europe and the UK, another way to enter the country is by sea, with connections by ferry to <a href="Roscoff" class="uri" title="wikilink">Roscoff</a> and <a href="Cherbourg" class="uri" title="wikilink">Cherbourg</a> in France and <a href="Liverpool" class="uri" title="wikilink">Liverpool</a> and <a href="Pembroke,_Pembrokeshire" title="wikilink">Pembroke</a> in England, <a href="Fishguard" class="uri" title="wikilink">Fishguard</a> and <a href="Holyhead" class="uri" title="wikilink">Holyhead</a> in Wales and <a href="Douglas,_Isle_of_Man" title="wikilink">Douglas</a> on the <a href="Isle_of_Man" title="wikilink">Isle of Man</a>.

<a href="Motorways_in_the_Republic_of_Ireland" title="wikilink">Motorways</a> link Dublin with all the major cities in the country and there are plans to extend the motorway system in the future. In recent years the quality of Irish roads has improved dramatically with the advent of the <a href="Celtic_Tiger" title="wikilink">Celtic Tiger</a> and significant <a href="European_Union" title="wikilink">European Union</a> funding, although outside the main routes, roads can be quite unpredictable in terms of quality and upkeep, especially in rural areas such as <a href="County_Kerry" title="wikilink">Co. Kerry</a> and <a href="County_Donegal" title="wikilink">Co. Donegal</a>.<br />
The <a href="Rail_transport_in_Ireland" title="wikilink">rail and light rail network</a> in Ireland is not as extensive as it once was, but it is still possible to get from city to city using the rail system, although many rural stations have closed along these lines. At the moment there is only one <a href="Light_rail" title="wikilink">light rail system</a> in the country, the <a href="Luas" class="uri" title="wikilink">Luas</a> in Dublin. This system opened in 2004 and due to the number of people availing of it (27.5million in 2010) it was stated as being &quot;Dublin's best public transport success story&quot; by <a href="Minister_for_Transport,_Tourism_and_Sport" title="wikilink">Minister for Transport</a>, <a href="Leo_Varadkar" title="wikilink">Leo Varadkar</a> in 2011.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="cities">Cities</h2>
<h3 id="dublin">Dublin</h3>

<p>The Capital, and also the largest city in the <a href="Republic_of_Ireland" title="wikilink">Republic of Ireland</a> is <a href="Dublin" class="uri" title="wikilink">Dublin</a>. Due to its proximity to the USA, it was the most important city in Ireland during the <a href="Tudor_conquest_of_Ireland" title="wikilink">Tudor conquest of Ireland</a> and subsequent British Invasions until after 1922 when the <a href="Irish_Free_State" title="wikilink">Irish Free State</a> was formed. As the British held a presence here for over 500 years, most of the historic buildings from the 1500s on were built by them. As <a href="Dublin_Airport" title="wikilink">Dublin Airport</a> is located just outside the city, most international visitors to Ireland begin their stay here. Among the main attractions in Dublin are <a href="Dublin_Castle" title="wikilink">Dublin Castle</a>, the seat of British rule in Ireland until 1922, <a href="Phoenix_Park" title="wikilink">Phoenix Park</a>, one of the largest inner city parks in the world,<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> <a href="General_Post_Office_(Dublin)" title="wikilink">The General Post Office</a>, one of Ireland's most famous buildings due to the <a href="1916_Easter_rising" title="wikilink">1916 Easter rising</a>, <a href="Kilmainham_Gaol" title="wikilink">Kilmainham Gaol</a>, a former prison turned museum that held and executed the rebels of the 1916 Rising and <a href="Trinity_College,_Dublin" title="wikilink">Trinity College</a>, where the <a href="Book_of_Kells" title="wikilink">Book of Kells</a> and the <a href="Book_of_Durrow" title="wikilink">Book of Durrow</a> are held.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> In 2010, Dublin was awarded the title of <a href="UNESCO_City_of_Literature" title="wikilink">UNESCO City of Literature</a>, as many famous writers such as <a href="James_Joyce" title="wikilink">James Joyce</a> and <a href="Samuel_Beckett" title="wikilink">Samuel Beckett</a> are from the city.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>

<h3 id="cork">Cork</h3>
<p>Situated on the southern coast of Ireland, <a href="Cork_(city)" title="wikilink">Cork</a> is the second biggest city in the country. Due to a population explosion in the 1800s, many of its most famous buildings are from this era. In this period two cathedrals were built, <a href="Cathedral_of_St_Mary_and_St_Anne" title="wikilink">Cathedral of St Mary and St Anne</a> and <a href="Saint_Fin_Barre&#39;s_Cathedral" title="wikilink">Saint Fin Barre's Cathedral</a>. Another historic attraction from this time is Cork City Gaol which opened in 1824, it is now a visitor centre for people to feel what it was like to live in the city, and imprisoned in the jail, 200 years ago.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> Cork's most famous building and the symbol of the city, <a href="Church_of_St_Anne_(Shandon)" title="wikilink">The Church of St. Anne</a>, is known for its clock tower dubbed &quot;The Four Faced Liar&quot; on account of all four of the clocks showing slightly different times. <a href="Cork_Airport" title="wikilink">Cork Airport</a> is located just outside the city and connects Cork to many European cities, although most flight routes are only available in the summer.</p>

</ul>
<h3 id="limerick">Limerick</h3>
<p>Situated on the mouth of the <a href="River_Shannon" title="wikilink">River Shannon</a>, <a href="Limerick" class="uri" title="wikilink">Limerick</a> has been an important gateway city for over 800 years. Due to the city's location on the midpoint of the <a href="Atlantic_Corridor" title="wikilink">Atlantic Corridor</a>, it has become something of a base city for tourists travelling along the west coast of Ireland, although the city has many attractions in its own right. <a href="King_John&#39;s_Castle_(Limerick)" title="wikilink">King John's Castle</a> in the medieval quarter of the city is arguably the best known attraction in the city, dating back to 922AD. The old city walls of Limerick surround a small bit of the site, although most of the walls have collapsed.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> The <a href="Hunt_Museum" title="wikilink">Hunt Museum</a> in the city hosts one of the worlds greatest private collections in the world, winning the Museum of the year award many times over the years.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> The museum has a wide collection of both ancient and medieval pieces of art and sculpture, originating from varied locations and civilisations around the world including <a href="Ancient_Greece" title="wikilink">Ancient Greece</a>, <a href="Ancient_Rome" title="wikilink">Ancient Rome</a>, <a href="Ancient_Egypt" title="wikilink">Ancient Egypt</a> and the <a href="Olmec" title="wikilink">Olmec Civilisation</a>.

<li><a href="Foynes" title="wikilink">Foynes village and Museum</a>, a small village outside Limerick City that was the last port of call for <a href="Seaplanes" class="uri" title="wikilink">Seaplanes</a> heading towards <a href="Americas" title="wikilink">The Americas</a>. This stretch of the <a href="River_Shannon" title="wikilink">River Shannon</a> became one of the biggest civilian airports in Europe during <a href="World_War_II" title="wikilink">World War II</a>, and was where the drink <a href="Irish_Coffee" title="wikilink">Irish Coffee</a> was first served.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a><a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a></li>
<li><a href="St_John&#39;s_Cathedral_(Limerick)" title="wikilink">St John's Cathedral</a>, one of two cathedrals in the city, this one has been in continuous use since 1861 and its spire is the tallest in the country, topping out at 94m.

<h3 id="galway">Galway</h3>
<p>Achieving city status in 1484, <a href="Galway" class="uri" title="wikilink">Galway</a> celebrated its quincentenary in 1984. Galway in itself is not particularly known for its attractions, but rather for its lively atmosphere and entertainment scene.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> This is partly because 25% of the population of Galway (75,529 in 2011) is made up of students primarily from <a href="NUIG" title="wikilink">NUI Galway</a> and <a href="GMIT" class="uri" title="wikilink">GMIT</a>, two third level institutes in the city. Galway is particularly popular with American tourists as Galway is said to be the most 'Irish' of Ireland's cities, and is one of the few urban areas where you are likely to hear Irish spoken, due to the fact the <a href="Gaeltacht" class="uri" title="wikilink">Gaeltacht</a> area of <a href="Connemara" class="uri" title="wikilink">Connemara</a> is only a few kilometres away.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> The biggest lake in the country, <a href="Lough_Corrib" title="wikilink">Lough Corrib</a>, is situated north of the city.<br />
The ferry to the <a href="Aran_Islands" title="wikilink">Aran Islands</a> is located about 40 minutes away and departs from the village of <a href="Rossaveal" class="uri" title="wikilink">Rossaveal</a> regularly. The Aran Islands are located in <a href="Galway_Bay" title="wikilink">Galway Bay</a>, and the <a href="Irish_Language" title="wikilink">Irish Language</a> is by far the most used language on the islands, with the vast majority using the language regularly. As the islands are quite a bit from the mainland, cars are quite rare and the main form of transport is the bicycle.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="waterford">Waterford</h3>
<p>Waterford is a city in the <a href="South-East_Region,_Ireland" title="wikilink">South-East region</a> of Ireland. It is the smallest city in the country, with a population of just over 132,000 in 2011, although it is the oldest, being founded by <a href="Viking" title="wikilink">Vikings</a> in 324AD. Situated in the south east, the city has one of the coldest climates in Ireland, getting on average an extra hour of sunshine each day.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> The seaside town of <a href="Ballybeg" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ballybeg</a> is located just south of the city and has 5 km long beach, and is also a popular surfing spot.</p>
<h2 id="coastlines-and-resorts">Coastlines and resorts</h2>
<p>As the <a href="Republic_of_Ireland" title="wikilink">Republic of Ireland</a> occupies just over 80% of the <a href="Island_of_Ireland" title="wikilink">Island of Ireland</a>, the country has become famous for its scenic coastline and villages and towns by the shoreline. The most widely known of these are situated in the west of Ireland, mostly in <a href="Munster" class="uri" title="wikilink">Munster</a>, but other areas of the country have their own individual resorts as well. The <a href="Cliffs_of_Moher" title="wikilink">Cliffs of Moher</a> are the most famous cliffs in Ireland, but the highest cliffs in Ireland and Great Britain are the <a href="Croaghaun" class="uri" title="wikilink">Croaghaun</a>, on the Atlantic coast of <a href="Achill_Island" title="wikilink">Achill Island</a> off <a href="County_Mayo" title="wikilink">Co.

The south and south west of Ireland is particularly known for its seaside resorts including <a href="Kilkee" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kilkee</a>, <a href="Lahinch" class="uri" title="wikilink">Lahinch</a>, <a href="Quilty" class="uri" title="wikilink">Quilty</a>, <a href="Spanish_Point,_County_Clare" title="wikilink">Spanish Point</a> and <a href="Doonbeg" class="uri" title="wikilink">Doonbeg</a> in <a href="County_Clare" title="wikilink">Co.

The most famous by far is the <a href="Saint_Patrick&#39;s_Day#Ireland" title="wikilink">St Patrick's Festival</a> which takes place in every county all over Ireland and celebrates <a href="Irish_culture" title="wikilink">Irish culture</a> the world over. Although St. Patrick's Day festivals are held all over the world on 17 March, the festival in Ireland lasts over a week, and includes the parades on the 17 as well as the <a href="Skyfest" class="uri" title="wikilink">Skyfest</a> celebrations, a fireworks display held somewhere different in Ireland every year. Part of the celebrations include <a href="Seachtain_na_Gaeilge" title="wikilink">Seachtain na Gaeilge</a> (Irish Week), which aims to promote the <a href="Irish_language" title="wikilink">Irish language</a> during the two weeks proceeding the festival.

Another festival that celebrates the Irish Culture and Diaspora all over the world is the <a href="Rose_of_Tralee_(festival)" title="wikilink">Rose of Tralee</a>.

Kerry</a>. The winner is picked based on her personality and her ability to be a good role model for the festival and for Ireland during her travels around the world. Unlike other pageants, the competitors are not judged on their appearance nor their body. One of the only rules of the competition is that the potential roses have to have an Irish ancestry.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a><br />
The <a href="Galway_Races" title="wikilink">Galway Races</a> is an Irish <a href="horse-racing" class="uri" title="wikilink">horse-racing</a> festival that starts on the last Monday of July every year.

Held over the month of September every year, the festival attracts between 20,000 and 40,000 romantic hopefuls, coming from all over the world to take part in the events. In recent years the festival has become particularly popular with tourists from the Far East. Willie Daly, the prime matchmaker, uses his notebook of love-seeking profiles to match potential couples, and the festival has evolved to become the biggest matchmaking festival in Europe.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a><br />

<h2 id="geological-tourism">Geological tourism</h2>
<p>Ireland has many geological attractions, most being along the coastline of the country. The two most famous geologically important destinations are both in <a href="County_Clare" title="wikilink">Co. Clare</a>; the <a href="Cliffs_of_Moher" title="wikilink">Cliffs of Moher</a> and <a href="The_Burren" title="wikilink">The Burren</a>. The Cliffs of Moher are one of the most visited sites in the country, with the rocks at the bottom of the cliffs dated as being about 320 million years old, formed when Ireland was under water during the <a href="Carboniferous" title="wikilink">Carboniferous Period</a>.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> The Burren was also created during this period. When a tropical sea flooded the south of the country, a buildup of coral (<a href="Limestone" class="uri" title="wikilink">Limestone</a>) began, covering many places in Ireland. When the sea shallowed, rocks such as <a href="Sandstone" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sandstone</a> and <a href="Shale" class="uri" title="wikilink">Shale</a> were deposited over the Limestone, effectively covering it over again. The Burren is one of the largest <a href="karst" class="uri" title="wikilink">karst</a> landscapes in Europe and is one of the few places in the country where the limestone is visible above ground.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a><br />
Many <a href="Irish_mountains" title="wikilink">Irish mountains</a> are also of geological distinction, most of them being formed in the <a href="Caledonian_orogeny" title="wikilink">Caledonian</a> or Amorican era. These mountains, formed between 400 and 250 million years ago, would have been the same height as the <a href="Alps" class="uri" title="wikilink">Alps</a>, but due to weathering, have become much smaller over time.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a></p>
