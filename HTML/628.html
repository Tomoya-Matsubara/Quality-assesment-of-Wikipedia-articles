This cartoon's plot was re-worked for the <a href="1955" class="uri" title="wikilink">1955</a> cartoon <em><a href="Hare_Brush" title="wikilink">Hare Brush</a></em> and its opening music was re-used in the <a href="1946" class="uri" title="wikilink">1946</a> cartoon <em><a href="Hair-Raising_Hare" title="wikilink">Hair-Raising Hare</a></em>, the 1952 cartoon <em><a href="The_Super_Snooper" title="wikilink">The Super Snooper</a></em> and the 1955 cartoon <em><a href="Hyde_and_Hare" title="wikilink">Hyde and Hare</a></em>.</p>
<p>The title, instead of employing the usual &quot;hare&quot; vs. &quot;hair&quot; pun, is standard spelling, for the expression that indicates thoughtlessness or recklessness.</p>
<h2 id="plot">Plot</h2>
<p>Elmer is reading a book about <a href="hypnotism" class="uri" title="wikilink">hypnotism</a> but he bumps into a bear. He hypnotizes the bear into thinking he is a <a href="canary" class="uri" title="wikilink">canary</a>. Bugs then asks Elmer, &quot;What's up, doc?&quot;. Elmer states he has him right where he wants him and starts to hypnotize Bugs (&quot;Heh, '<a href="Dracula" class="uri" title="wikilink">Dracula</a>'&quot;, the rabbit observes). Bugs fools Elmer by giving him a <a href="balloon" class="uri" title="wikilink">balloon</a> with long ears and he hears the bear he hypnotized earlier chirping and falls to the ground. Then he chases Bugs and fights over the gun. Then he cries on a <a href="tree" class="uri" title="wikilink">tree</a> and Bugs asks what's wrong. Elmer tells him that he (Bugs) won't cooperate when he tries to hypnotize him. Bugs says he will cooperate.</p>
<p>Then, as Elmer hypnotizes Bugs, Bugs hypnotizes him instead, and commands him to be a <a href="rabbit" class="uri" title="wikilink">rabbit</a>. Elmer then starts to act like Bugs, inducing Bugs to act like Elmer (after furiously declaring, &quot;Who's the comedian in this picture, anyway?&quot;), and the role-reversing chase ensues. Bugs then looks for Elmer, who is right behind him. Bugs talks to the audience while chewing three <a href="carrot" title="wikilink">carrots</a> â€” two of which are in Elmer's hands. Then the chase starts again, until Bugs has a chance to &quot;un-hypnotize&quot; Elmer. Elmer then runs away and all seems normal. After sneering at Elmer's ability to hypnotize him, Bugs suddenly notices his watch, exclaiming, &quot;I'm overdue at the airport&quot;, and proceeds to take off and fly like an <a href="airplane" class="uri" title="wikilink">airplane</a>. Bugs states &quot;I'm the <a href="Douglas_XB-19" title="wikilink">B-19</a>!&quot; and flies away toward the airport. The cartoon ends with an iris-out.</p>
