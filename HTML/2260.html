<p>The <strong>Battle of Vukovar</strong> (, ) was an 87-day <a href="siege" class="uri" title="wikilink">siege</a> of <a href="Vukovar" class="uri" title="wikilink">Vukovar</a> in eastern <a href="Croatia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Croatia</a> by the <a href="Yugoslav_People&#39;s_Army" title="wikilink">Yugoslav People's Army</a> (JNA), supported by various <a href="paramilitary" class="uri" title="wikilink">paramilitary</a> forces from <a href="Serbia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Serbia</a>, between August and November 1991. Before the <a href="Croatian_War_of_Independence" title="wikilink">Croatian War of Independence</a> the <a href="Baroque_architecture" title="wikilink">Baroque</a> town was a prosperous, ethnically mixed community of <a href="Croats" class="uri" title="wikilink">Croats</a>, <a href="Serbs_of_Croatia" title="wikilink">Serbs</a> and other ethnic groups. In 1990, nationalist politics pursued by Serbia's President <a href="Slobodan_Milo&lt;U+0161&gt;evi&lt;U+0107&gt;" title="wikilink">Slobodan Milo&lt;U+0161&gt;evi&lt;U+0107&gt;</a> and Croatia's President <a href="Franjo_Tu&lt;U+0111&gt;man" title="wikilink">Franjo Tu&lt;U+0111&gt;man</a> led to the outbreak of an armed insurrection by <a href="Croatian_Serbs" title="wikilink">Croatian Serbs</a>, supported by the Serbian government and paramilitary groups. As Croatian Serb militias seized control of Serb-populated areas of Croatia, the JNA began to intervene in favour of the rebellion. Conflict broke out in the eastern Croatian region of <a href="Slavonia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Slavonia</a> in May 1991. In August the JNA launched a full-scale attack against Croatian-held territory in eastern Slavonia, including Vukovar.</p>
<p>Vukovar was defended by around 1,800 lightly armed soldiers of the <a href="Croatian_National_Guard" title="wikilink">Croatian National Guard</a> (ZNG) and civilian volunteers, against 36,000 JNA soldiers and Serbian paramilitaries equipped with heavy armour and artillery. During the battle shells and rockets were fired into the town at a rate of up to 12,000 a day.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> At the time it was the fiercest and most protracted battle in Europe, and Vukovar was the first major European town entirely destroyed since the <a href="Second_World_War" title="wikilink">Second World War</a>.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a><a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> When Vukovar fell on 18 November 1991, hundreds of soldiers and civilians were massacred by Serb forces and at least 31,000 civilians were deported from the town and its surroundings.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a><a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> Vukovar was <a href="ethnic_cleansing" title="wikilink">ethnically cleansed</a> of its non-Serb population and became part of the self-declared <a href="Republic_of_Serbian_Krajina" title="wikilink">Republic of Serbian Krajina</a>. Several Serb military and political officials, including Milo&lt;U+0161&gt;evi&lt;U+0107&gt;, were later indicted and in some cases jailed for <a href="war_crime" title="wikilink">war crimes</a> committed during and after the battle.</p>
<p>The battle exhausted the JNA and proved a turning point in the Croatian war. A ceasefire was declared a few weeks later. Vukovar remained in Serb hands until 1998 when it was peacefully reintegrated into Croatia. It has since been rebuilt but has less than half of its pre-war population and many buildings are still scarred by the battle. Its two principal ethnic communities remain deeply divided and it has not regained its former prosperity.</p>

<p><img src="Greetings_from_Vukovar_-_View_of_the_Danube_(front).jpg" title="fig:View of Vukovar from the Danube in 1917" alt="View of Vukovar from the Danube in 1917" /> Vukovar is an important regional centre on Croatia's eastern border, situated in eastern <a href="Slavonia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Slavonia</a> on the west bank of the <a href="Danube" class="uri" title="wikilink">Danube</a> river. The area has a diverse population of Croats, Serbs, <a href="Hungarians_of_Croatia" title="wikilink">Hungarians</a>, <a href="Slovaks" class="uri" title="wikilink">Slovaks</a>, <a href="Ruthenians" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ruthenians</a> and many other nationalities, who had lived together for centuries in relative harmony before the Croatian war. It was one of the wealthiest areas of Yugoslavia before the war.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> Vukovar's long-standing prosperity was reflected in one of Croatia's finest ensembles of <a href="Baroque_architecture" title="wikilink">Baroque architecture</a>.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p>The region underwent major demographic changes following the <a href="Second_World_War" title="wikilink">Second World War</a>, when its ethnic <a href="German_people" title="wikilink">German</a> inhabitants were expelled and replaced with Serb and Montenegrin settlers from elsewhere in Yugoslavia.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> In the last Yugoslav census in 1991, the Vukovar municipality, which included the town and surrounding villages, was recorded as having 84,189 inhabitants, of whom 43.8 per cent were Croats, 37.5 per cent were Serbs and the remainder were members of other ethnic groups. The town of Vukovar had 47 per cent Croats to 32.3 per cent Serbs.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<p>From 1945, the <a href="Socialist_Federal_Republic_of_Yugoslavia" title="wikilink">Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia</a> was governed as a federal communist state comprising six newly-created republicsÂ &lt;U+2013&gt; <a href="Slovenia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Slovenia</a>, Croatia, <a href="Bosnia_and_Herzegovina" title="wikilink">Bosnia and Herzegovina</a>, Serbia, <a href="Montenegro" class="uri" title="wikilink">Montenegro</a> and <a href="Republic_of_Macedonia" title="wikilink">Macedonia</a>.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> The current border between Serbia and Croatia was defined in 1945 by a Yugoslav federal government commission which assigned areas with a majority Serb population to the <a href="Socialist_Republic_of_Serbia" title="wikilink">Socialist Republic of Serbia</a> and those with a Croatian majority to the <a href="Socialist_Republic_of_Croatia" title="wikilink">Socialist Republic of Croatia</a>.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> This left a large Serb minority in Croatian territory.</p>
<p>After Yugoslavia's leader <a href="Josip_Broz_Tito" title="wikilink">Josip Broz Tito</a> died in 1980, long-suppressed ethnic nationalism revived, along with the power of the individual republics. Slovenia and Croatia moved towards multi-party democracy and economic reform, but Serbia's authoritarian communist President <a href="Slobodan_Milo&lt;U+0161&gt;evi&lt;U+0107&gt;" title="wikilink">Slobodan Milo&lt;U+0161&gt;evi&lt;U+0107&gt;</a> opposed reform and sought to increase the power of the communist Yugoslav government.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> In 1990, Slovenia and Croatia held elections that ended communist rule and brought pro-independence nationalist parties to power in both republics. In Croatia, the <a href="Croatian_Democratic_Union" title="wikilink">Croatian Democratic Union</a> (HDZ) party of <a href="Franjo_Tu&lt;U+0111&gt;man" title="wikilink">Franjo Tu&lt;U+0111&gt;man</a> took office, with Tu&lt;U+0111&gt;man as President.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<p>Tu&lt;U+0111&gt;man's programme was opposed by many members of Croatia's Serbian minority, towards whom he was overtly antagonistic.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> The <a href="Serb_Democratic_Party_(Croatia)" title="wikilink">Serb Democratic Party</a> (SDS) of Croatia, supported by Milo&lt;U+0161&gt;evi&lt;U+0107&gt;, denounced the HDZ as a reincarnation of the nationalist-fascist <a href="Ustasha" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ustasha</a> movement, which had massacred hundreds of thousands of Serbs during the Second World War.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> From mid-1990, the SDS mounted an armed rebellion in Serb-inhabited areas of Croatia and set up the self-declared <a href="Serbian_Autonomous_Oblast_of_Krajina" title="wikilink">Serbian Autonomous Oblast of Krajina</a> with covert support from the Serbian government and Serbian paramilitary groups. The Croatian government rapidly lost control of large areas of the republic.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> In February 1991, the Krajina Serbs declared independence from Croatia and announced that they would unite with Serbia. Other Serb communities around Croatia also announced that they would secede and established their own militias.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="prelude-to-the-battle">Prelude to the battle</h2>
<p>The conflict between Serbs and Croats spread to eastern Slavonia in early 1991. On 1 April, Serb villagers around Vukovar and other towns in eastern Slavonia began to erect barricades across main roads.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> The <a href="White_Eagles_(paramilitary)" title="wikilink">White Eagles</a>, a Serbian paramilitary group led by <a href="Vojislav_&lt;U+0160&gt;e&lt;U+0161&gt;elj" title="wikilink">Vojislav &lt;U+0160&gt;e&lt;U+0161&gt;elj</a>, moved into the Serb-populated village of <a href="Borovo_Selo" title="wikilink">Borovo Selo</a> just north of Vukovar.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> On 1 May, <a href="Gojko_&lt;U+0160&gt;u&lt;U+0161&gt;ak" title="wikilink">Gojko &lt;U+0160&gt;u&lt;U+0161&gt;ak</a>, a Croatian government minister and hardline nationalist, personally fired three <a href="Armbrust" class="uri" title="wikilink">Armbrust</a> shoulder-launched <a href="anti-tank_missile" title="wikilink">anti-tank missiles</a> at houses inhabited by Serbs in Borovo Selo. There were no casualties, but the attack aggravated and deepened ethnic tensions.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> The following day Serb paramilitaries ambushed two Croatian police buses in the centre of Borovo Selo, killing 12 policemen and injuring 22 more. Three Serbs were also killed.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> The <a href="Borovo_Selo_killings" title="wikilink">Borovo Selo killings</a> were the worst act of violence that had occurred between ethnic Serbs and Croats since the Second World War.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> They enraged many Croatians and led to a surge of ethnic violence across Slavonia.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a></p>

<p>Shortly after, units of the Yugoslav People's Army (JNA) moved into Borovo Selo. The army's intervention was welcomed by local Croatian leaders, but Croatian deputy interior minister <a href="Milan_Brezak" title="wikilink">Milan Brezak</a> accused the JNA of preventing the Croatian police from dealing with the paramilitaries.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a><a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> Gun battles broke out across the region between rival militias.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> In Vukovar, Croatians harassed Serb residents, sometimes violently. Croatian police forcibly took over the local radio station, Radio Vukovar, and Serb members of the station's ethnically mixed staff were fired and replaced with Croats.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> Serb militias systematically blocked transport routes in the predominately Serb-inhabited countryside around Vukovar, and within days the town could only be reached by an unpaved track running through Croat-inhabited villages. The atmosphere in Vukovar was said to be &quot;murderous&quot;.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a></p>
<p>On 19 May 1991, the Croatian government held a nationwide referendum on a declaration of sovereignty. In Vukovar, as elsewhere in Croatia, hardline Serb nationalists urged Serbs to boycott the referendum, while moderates advocated using the poll to register opposition to independence. Many local Serbs did vote,<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> but the referendum passed with 94 per cent nationally voting in favour.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a></p>
<p>Violence in and around Vukovar worsened after the independence referendum. Repeated gun and bomb attacks were reported in the town and surrounding villages.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> Serb paramilitaries expelled thousands of non-Serbs from their homes in the municipality.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> Croatian paramilitaries, led by <a href="Tomislav_Mer&lt;U+010D&gt;ep" title="wikilink">Tomislav Mer&lt;U+010D&gt;ep</a>, attacked Serbs in and around Vukovar; between thirty<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> and eighty-six Serbs were alleged to have disappeared or been killed, and thousands of others fled their homes.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> A Croatian government representative in Vukovar told the Zagreb authorities that &quot;the city is again [the] victim of terror, armed strife and provocative shoot-outs with potentially unfathomable consequences. The policy pursued so far has created an atmosphere of terror among the Croatian and Serbian population.&quot;<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> Gunmen from both sides burned and looted hundreds of houses and farms in the area.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a></p>
<p>The conflict blurred ethnic lines. Many Serbs who had lived in Vukovar for generationsÂ &lt;U+2013&gt; known as the <em>starosedioci</em> or &quot;old settlers&quot;Â &lt;U+2013&gt; resisted the propaganda coming from Belgrade and <a href="Knin" class="uri" title="wikilink">Knin</a> and continued to live peacefully with their Croatian neighbours. The <em>do&lt;U+0161&gt;ljaci</em>, or &quot;newcomers&quot;, whose families had relocated from southern Serbia and Montenegro to replace the deported Germans after 1945, were the most responsive to nationalist appeals. Paolo Rumiz describes how they &quot;tried to win their coethnics over to the patriotic mobilization, and when they had no success with that, they killed them, plundered their property and goods, or drove them away. The old settlers would not let themselves be stirred up against other nationalities.&quot;<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> When Croats fled the fighting they often gave their house keys for safekeeping to their Serb neighbours, whom they trusted, rather than to the Croatian police. Sabrina P. Ramet comments that the distinctive feature of the war in eastern Slavonia was &quot;the mobilization of those who were not integrated into the multi-cultural life of the cities against urban multi-culturalism.&quot;<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> The former mayor of Belgrade, Bogdan Bogdanovi&lt;U+0107&gt;, characterises the attack on Vukovar as an act of &quot;<a href="urbicide" class="uri" title="wikilink">urbicide</a>&quot;, a deliberate assault on urbanism.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a></p>

Paramilitaries, JNA soldiers and Serbian conscripts of the <a href="Territorial_Defense_Forces_(Yugoslavia)" title="wikilink">Territorial Defence Forces</a> (<em>Teritorijalna Obrana</em> or TO) were present in Serb-inhabited areas. There was a small JNA force in the town barracks in the Sajmi&lt;U+0161&gt;te district of Vukovar, surrounded by territory controlled by Croatian forces.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> Although the two sides were commonly referred to as &quot;Croatian&quot; and &quot;Serbian&quot; or &quot;Yugoslav&quot;, Serbs and Croats as well as many other of Yugoslavia's national groups fought on both sides. The first commander of the attacking force was a Macedonian,<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> and a substantial portion of the Croatian defenders were Serbs and other ethnicities.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="croatian-forces">Croatian forces</h3>
<p>The Croatian force in Vukovar comprised 1,800 men assembled from units of the newly created Croatian National Guard, including 400 members of the <a href="3rd_Guards_Brigade_(Croatia)" title="wikilink">3rd Guards Brigade</a> and the <a href="1st_Guards_Brigade_(Croatia)" title="wikilink">1st Guards Brigade</a>. The 4th Battalion of the 3rd Guards Brigade was stationed in the city from the beginning, while elements of the 1st Guards Brigade arrived retreating from elsewhere in western Syrmia. In addition to the guardsmen there were 300 police officers and 1,100 civilian volunteers from Vukovar and nearby communities.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> The bulk of the force had initially been organised in an improvised manner,<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> but was formally reorganised in late September 1991 as the <a href="204th_Vukovar_Brigade" title="wikilink">204th Vukovar Brigade</a>, also known as the 124th Brigade.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a></p>
<p>Volunteers arrived from other parts of Croatia, including from the far-right paramilitary <a href="Croatian_Defence_Forces" title="wikilink">Croatian Defence Forces</a> (HOS) backed by <a href="Dobroslav_Paraga" title="wikilink">Dobroslav Paraga</a>'s extreme nationalist <a href="Croatian_Party_of_Rights" title="wikilink">Croatian Party of Rights</a> (HSP).<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> The defenders were a cross-section of Vukovar society; as many as a third were non-Croats, including Serbs, Ruthenians, Hungarians and other ethnicities.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a> About a hundred of the defenders were Serbs. According to Zoran &lt;U+0160&gt;angut, one of the Croat defenders, &quot;We had complete confidence in them. They defended Vukovar alongside us.&quot;<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a></p>
<p>The Croatian force in Vukovar was commanded by <a href="Mile_Dedakovi&lt;U+0107&gt;" title="wikilink">Mile Dedakovi&lt;U+0107&gt;</a>, a former JNA officer who had joined the ZNG, Dedakovi&lt;U+0107&gt; volunteered for a post in Vukovar and took charge of the town's defences.<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a> During the siege of Vukovar he was referred to as <em>Jastreb</em> (&quot;Hawk&quot;).<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a> At the time, the <a href="Ministry_of_Defence_(Croatia)" title="wikilink">Croatian Minister of Defence</a> &lt;U+0160&gt;u&lt;U+0161&gt;ak publicly claimed that Dedakovi&lt;U+0107&gt; was a Serb,<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a> a claim that was later reprinted by independent sources,<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a> but was false.<ref name="Butkovi<U+0107>-Jutarnji-2010&quot;/&gt; Dedakovi&lt;U+0107&gt;'s second-in-command, Branko Borkovi&lt;U+0107&gt;, was another former JNA officer who had volunteered for service in Vukovar.<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a> The two men established a unified command structure, organised the defenders into a single brigade and implemented an integrated defence system.<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a> A defensive ring of six sectors was established, each assigned to one unit within the 204th Brigade.<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a> The defenders used a network of cellars, canals, ditches and trenches to redeploy around the sectors as needed.<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a></p>
<p>At the start of the battle they were poorly armed and many were equipped only with hunting rifles. They relied mostly on light infantry weapons, but obtained a few artillery pieces and anti-aircraft guns and improvised their own land mines.<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a> They also obtained several hundred anti-tank weapons such as <a href="M79_Rocket_Launcher" title="wikilink">M79</a> and <a href="M80_Rocket_Launcher" title="wikilink">M80</a> rocket launchers, but were critically short of ammunition throughout the battle.<ref name="<U+0160>ebetovsky11&quot; /&gt;<ref name="<U+0160>ebetovsky12&quot;/&gt; Although the Croatian government sent some supplies and reinforcements in the early stages, the defenders received little of significance.

<p>Although the battle was fought primarily by the federal Yugoslav military, the government of Serbia was directly involved.

<p>At the start of the war in Slovenia, the army still saw itself as the defender of a federal, communist Yugoslavia, rather than an instrument of Serbian nationalism.

It aimed to force Croatia's political leadership to capitulate and renegotiate its membership of Yugoslavia.<a href="#fn67" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a> The JNA's leadership was not yet dominated by ethnic Serbs, and these early goals reflected the &quot;Yugoslav&quot; outlook of its multiethnic leadership. Kadijevi&lt;U+0107&gt; was half-Croat and half-Serb, his deputy was a Slovene, the commander of JNA forces in the first phase of the battle was a Macedonian, and the head of the Yugoslav Air Force, which repeatedly bombed Vukovar during the battle, was a Croat.<a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a><a href="#fn69" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref69"><sup>69</sup></a></p>
<p>The loss of Slovenia in the <a href="Ten-Day_War" title="wikilink">Ten-Day War</a> made it impossible to fulfil the original objective of keeping Yugoslavia intact. Many of the Serb members of the army no longer wanted to fight for a multiethnic Yugoslavia. The army developed an increasingly Serbian character as non-Serbs deserted or refused to be drafted.<a href="#fn70" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a> Some JNA commanders overtly supported the Serb rebels in Croatia and provided them with weapons.<a href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a> Although Kadijevi&lt;U+0107&gt; and other senior JNA commanders initially argued that &quot;the JNA must defend all the nations of Yugoslavia&quot;,<a href="#fn72" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref72"><sup>72</sup></a> they eventually recognised that they had no chance of achieving their original goals, and threw their support behind the rebel Serbs of Croatia.<a href="#fn73" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref73"><sup>73</sup></a></p>
<p>Yugoslav and Serb propaganda portrayed the Croatians as genocidal Ustashas who had illegally taken over Yugoslav territory and were threatening Serb civilians in a reprise of the anti-Serb pogroms of the Second World War.<a href="#fn74" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref74"><sup>74</sup></a> Kadijevi&lt;U+0107&gt; later justified the JNA's offensive against Vukovar on the grounds that it was part of the &quot;backbone of the Croatian army&quot; and had to be &quot;liberated&quot;. The JNA's periodical <em>Narodna Armija</em> claimed after the battle that Vukovar &quot;had for decades been prepared to support German military penetration down the Danube.&quot;<a href="#fn75" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref75"><sup>75</sup></a> The paramilitary leader Vojislav &lt;U+0160&gt;e&lt;U+0161&gt;elj declared: &quot;We're all one army.

On 23 August <a href="Borovo_Naselje" title="wikilink">Borovo Naselje</a>, the Croatian-held northern suburb of Vukovar, came under heavy shellfire. Croatian forces shot down two Yugoslav <a href="Soko_G-2_Galeb" title="wikilink">G-2 Galeb</a> fighter aircraft using <a href="Man-portable_air-defense_systems" title="wikilink">shoulder-launched anti-aircraft missiles</a>. The following day the JNA, Yugoslav Air Force and Yugoslav Navy launched a major attack using aircraft, naval vessels on the Danube, tanks and artillery. The attack, which was mounted from both sides of the border, caused extensive damage and many civilian casualties.<a href="#fn80" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref80"><sup>80</sup></a></p>
<p>The Croatian government launched an attack on JNA garrisons and arms depots throughout its territory on 14 SeptemberÂ &lt;U+2013&gt; an offensive dubbed the <a href="Battle_of_the_Barracks" title="wikilink">Battle of the Barracks</a>. Vukovar's JNA barracks was one of those attacked that day, but the local Croatian forces failed to capture it. In retaliation, Serb paramilitaries attacked areas to the southwest of Vukovar from the direction of <a href="Negoslavci" class="uri" title="wikilink">Negoslavci</a>, forcing about 2,000 people to flee. There were reports of mass killings and scores of civilian deaths.<a href="#fn81" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref81"><sup>81</sup></a> Croatian forces outside the Vukovar perimeter received large quantities of arms and ammunition from depots captured elsewhere, enabling them to hold the line against JNA attacks.<a href="#fn82" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref82"><sup>82</sup></a></p>
<p>The JNA responded by launching a major offensive in eastern Slavonia, from where it intended to progress west via <a href="Vinkovci" class="uri" title="wikilink">Vinkovci</a> and <a href="Osijek" class="uri" title="wikilink">Osijek</a> to Zagreb. The army did not bypass Vukovar, because they wished to relieve the besieged barracks and to eliminate a possible threat to their supply lines. The JNA leadership did not intend to make Vukovar the main focus of the offensive but, as happened with <a href="Battle_of_Stalingrad" title="wikilink">Stalingrad in the Second World War</a>, an initially inconsequential engagement became an essential political symbol for both sides.<a href="#fn83" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref83"><sup>83</sup></a></p>
<p>On 19 September, a JNA force consisting of at least a hundred <a href="T-55" class="uri" title="wikilink">T-55</a> and <a href="M-84" class="uri" title="wikilink">M-84</a> tanks with armoured personnel carriers and heavy artillery pieces left Belgrade and crossed into Croatia near the Serbian town of <a href="&lt;U+0160&gt;id" class="uri" title="wikilink">&lt;U+0160&gt;id</a> on 20 September.<a href="#fn84" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref84"><sup>84</sup></a> Croatian units were quickly routed and fell back to Vukovar. The JNA's 1st Guards Mechanised Brigade quickly reached the Vukovar barracks and lifted the Croatian siege of the facility. They also moved to encircle Vukovar. By 30 September, the town was almost completely surrounded; all roads in and out were blocked, and the only route in was via a farm track through a perilously exposed cornfield.<a href="#fn85" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref85"><sup>85</sup></a></p>
<p>The JNA launched repeated assaults on Vukovar but failed to make any progress. Its armour, designed for combat in open country, was barely able to enter Vukovar's narrow streets. Support from regular infantry was lacking, and the poorly trained and motivated troops of the TO were inadequate substitutes.<a href="#fn86" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref86"><sup>86</sup></a> The JNA's soldiers appeared to have little understanding of how to conduct <a href="urban_warfare" title="wikilink">urban operations</a> and its officers displayed slow and reactive decision-making on the ground.<a href="#fn87" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref87"><sup>87</sup></a></p>
<p>Croatian forces countered the JNA's attacks by mining approach roads, sending out mobile teams equipped with anti-tank weapons, deploying many <a href="sniper" title="wikilink">snipers</a>, and fighting back from heavily fortified positions.<a href="#fn88" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref88"><sup>88</sup></a> The JNA initially relied on massing armoured spearheads which would advance along a street in a column followed by a few companies of infantry.<a href="#fn89" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref89"><sup>89</sup></a> The defenders responded by opening fire with anti-tank weapons at very close rangeÂ &lt;U+2013&gt; often as short as Â &lt;U+2013&gt; to disable the lead and rear vehicles, trapping the rest of the column where it could be systematically disabled.<a href="#fn90" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref90"><sup>90</sup></a> The defenders tried to avoid completely destroying enemy armour, as the materiel that they retrieved from disabled vehicles was an important source of resupply.<a href="#fn91" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref91"><sup>91</sup></a> They used a strategy of &quot;active defence&quot;, carrying out hit-and-run attacks to keep the JNA forces off balance.<a href="#fn92" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref92"><sup>92</sup></a> Anti-tank and anti-personnel mines hindered JNA manoeuvres. The defenders used unconventional tactics to undermine enemy morale, such as firing weather rockets at Serb forces<a href="#fn93" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref93"><sup>93</sup></a> and sabotaging JNA tanks by planting mines underneath them while they were parked at night, so that they would blow up when the crews started them in the morning.<a href="#fn94" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref94"><sup>94</sup></a> JNA casualties were heavy; on one road, dubbed the &quot;tank graveyard&quot;, about a hundred JNA armoured vehicles were destroyed, fifteen of them by Croatian <a href="Colonel" class="uri" title="wikilink">Colonel</a> <a href="Marko_Babi&lt;U+0107&gt;_(soldier)" title="wikilink">Marko Babi&lt;U+0107&gt;</a>.<a href="#fn95" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref95"><sup>95</sup></a> The high casualties had a debilitating effect on morale all the way up the chain of command.<a href="#fn96" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref96"><sup>96</sup></a></p>
<p>The JNA began launching artillery and rocket barrages against the town. By the end of the battle, over 700,000 shells and other missiles had been fired at Vukovar<a href="#fn97" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref97"><sup>97</sup></a> at a rate of up to 12,000 a day.<a href="#fn98" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref98"><sup>98</sup></a> It is estimated that Vukovar as well as its surroundings were bombarded with a total of over 2.5 million shells of mortar and artillery of over 20Â mm.<a href="#fn99" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref99"><sup>99</sup></a> Metre for metre, the bombardment was more intense than at Stalingrad.<a href="#fn100" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref100"><sup>100</sup></a> The thousands of civilians remaining in Vukovar took shelter from the bombardment in cellars and bomb shelters that had been built during the <a href="Cold_War" title="wikilink">Cold War</a>.<a href="#fn101" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref101"><sup>101</sup></a></p>

Many reservistsÂ &lt;U+2013&gt; who were drawn from all the Yugoslav republics, including CroatiaÂ &lt;U+2013&gt; refused to report for duty, and many serving soldiers deserted rather than fight.<a href="#fn102" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref102"><sup>102</sup></a> Serbia was never formally at war and no general mobilisation was carried out.<a href="#fn103" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref103"><sup>103</sup></a> An estimated 150,000 Serbs went abroad to avoid conscription, and many others deserted or went into hiding.<a href="#fn104" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref104"><sup>104</sup></a> Only 13 per cent of conscripts reported for duty.<a href="#fn105" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref105"><sup>105</sup></a> Another 40,000 staged rebellions in towns across Serbia; the Serbian newspaper <em><a href="Vreme" class="uri" title="wikilink">Vreme</a></em> commented in July 1991 that the situation was one of &quot;total military disintegration&quot;.<a href="#fn106" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref106"><sup>106</sup></a></p>
<p>Morale on the battlefield was poor. JNA commanders resorted to firing on their own positions to motivate their men to fight. When the commander of a JNA unit at Vukovar demanded to know who was willing to fight and who wanted to go home, the unit split in two; one conscript, unable to decide which side to take, shot himself on the spot.<a href="#fn107" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref107"><sup>107</sup></a> A JNA officer who served at Vukovar later described how his men refused to obey orders on several occasions, &quot;abandoning combat vehicles, discarding weapons, gathering on some flat ground, sitting and singing &quot;<a href="Give_Peace_a_Chance" title="wikilink">Give Peace a Chance</a>&quot; by John Lennon.&quot; In late October, an entire infantry battalion from <a href="Novi_Sad" title="wikilink">Novi Sad</a> in Serbia abandoned an attack on Borovo Naselje and fled. Another group of reservists threw away their weapons and went back to Serbia on foot across a nearby bridge.<a href="#fn108" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref108"><sup>108</sup></a> A tank driver, Vladimir &lt;U+017D&gt;ivkovi&lt;U+0107&gt;, drove his vehicle from the front line at Vukovar to the Yugoslav parliament in Belgrade, where he parked on the steps in front of the building. He was arrested and declared insane by the authorities. His treatment enraged his colleagues, who protested by taking over a local radio station at gunpoint and issuing a declaration that &quot;we are not traitors, but we do not want to be aggressors.&quot;<a href="#fn109" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref109"><sup>109</sup></a></p>
<p>In late September, Lieutenant Colonel General <a href="&lt;U+017D&gt;ivota_Pani&lt;U+0107&gt;" title="wikilink">&lt;U+017D&gt;ivota Pani&lt;U+0107&gt;</a> was put in charge of the operation against Vukovar. He established new headquarters and command-and-control arrangements to resolve the disorganisation that had hindered the JNA's operations. Pani&lt;U+0107&gt; divided the JNA forces into Northern and Southern <a href="Area_of_Responsibility" title="wikilink">Areas of Responsibility</a> (AORs). The northern AOR was assigned to Major General <a href="Mladen_Brati&lt;U+0107&gt;" title="wikilink">Mladen Brati&lt;U+0107&gt;</a>, while Colonel <a href="Mile_Mrk&lt;U+0161&gt;i&lt;U+0107&gt;" title="wikilink">Mile Mrk&lt;U+0161&gt;i&lt;U+0107&gt;</a> was given charge of the south.<a href="#fn110" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref110"><sup>110</sup></a> As well as fresh troops, paramilitary volunteers from Serbia were brought in. They were well armed and highly motivated but often undisciplined and brutal. They were formed into units of company and battalion size as substitutes for the missing reservists.<a href="#fn111" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref111"><sup>111</sup></a> The commander of the Novi Sad corps was videotaped after the battle praising the <a href="Serb_Volunteer_Guard" title="wikilink">Serb Volunteer Guard</a> (&quot;Tigers&quot;) of <a href="&lt;U+017D&gt;eljko_Ra&lt;U+017E&gt;natovi&lt;U+0107&gt;" title="wikilink">&lt;U+017D&gt;eljko Ra&lt;U+017E&gt;natovi&lt;U+0107&gt;</a>, known as &quot;Arkan&quot;:<a href="#fn112" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref112"><sup>112</sup></a></p>

<p>Pani&lt;U+0107&gt; combined well-motivated paramilitary infantry with trained engineering units to clear mines and defensive positions, supported by heavy armour and artillery.<a href="#fn113" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref113"><sup>113</sup></a> The paramilitaries spearheaded a fresh offensive that began on 30 September. The assault succeeded in cutting the Croatian supply route to Vukovar when the village of <a href="Marinci,_Croatia" title="wikilink">Marinci</a>, on the route out of the town, was captured on 1 October. Shortly afterwards, the Croatian 204th Brigade's commander, Mile Dedakovi&lt;U+0107&gt;, broke out with a small escort, slipping through the Serbian lines to reach the Croatian-held town of Vinkovci. His deputy, Branko Borkovi&lt;U+0107&gt;, took over command of Vukovar's defences. General <a href="Anton_Tus" title="wikilink">Anton Tus</a>, commander of the Croatian forces outside the Vukovar perimeter, put Dedakovi&lt;U+0107&gt; in charge of a breakthrough operation to relieve the town and launched a counter-offensive on 13 October.

A crisis committee was established, operating from a nuclear bunker underneath the municipal hospital. The committee took over the running of the town and organised the delivery of food, water and medical supplies. It kept the number of civilians on the streets to a minimum and ensured that each shelter was guarded and had at least one doctor and nurse assigned to it.<a href="#fn117" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref117"><sup>117</sup></a></p>
<p>The hospital had to deal with hundreds of wounded peopleÂ &lt;U+2013&gt; between sixteen and eighty each day, three quarters of them civilians, in the second half of September.<a href="#fn118" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref118"><sup>118</sup></a> Even though the building was marked with the <a href="Red_Cross_symbol" title="wikilink">Red Cross</a>, it was struck by over eight hundred shells during the battle.

The intensive care unit was moved into the building's nuclear bomb shelter.<a href="#fn119" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref119"><sup>119</sup></a> On 4 October, the Yugoslav Air Force attacked the hospital, destroying its operating theatre.

<p>Croatian forces adapted several <a href="Antonov_An-2" title="wikilink">Antonov An-2</a> biplanes to drop supplies by parachute on Vukovar.

<p>On 16 October the JNA mounted a major attack against Borovo Naselje. It achieved some gains, but became bogged down in the face of determined Croatian resistance.<a href="#fn128" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref128"><sup>128</sup></a> On 30 October the JNA launched a fully coordinated assault, spearheaded by paramilitary forces, with infantry and engineering troops systematically forcing their way through the Croatian defences. The JNA forces, divided into northern and southern operations sectors, attacked several points simultaneously and pushed back the defenders.<a href="#fn129" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref129"><sup>129</sup></a> The JNA also adopted new tactics, such as firing directly into houses and then driving tanks through them, using <a href="tear_gas" title="wikilink">tear gas</a> and <a href="smoke_bomb" title="wikilink">smoke bombs</a> to drive out the defenders, and using anti-tank and anti-aircraft guns to capture the town building by building.

<h3 id="croatian">Croatian</h3>
<p>Croatian forces and civilians suffered heavy casualties during the battle. Croatian general Anton Tus has stated that about 1,100 of Vukovar's defenders were killed and 2,600 defenders and civilians were listed as missing; another 1,000 Croatian soldiers were killed on the approaches to Vinkovci and Osijek. He noted that the intensity of the fighting can be judged by the fact that the losses in eastern Slavonia between September and November 1991 constituted half of all Croatian war casualties during the whole of 1991.<a href="#fn144" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref144"><sup>144</sup></a> According to figures published in 2006 by the <a href="Ministry_of_Defence_(Croatia)" title="wikilink">Croatian Ministry of Defence</a>, 879 Croatian soldiers were killed and 770 wounded in Vukovar.<a href="#fn145" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref145"><sup>145</sup></a> The <a href="Central_Intelligence_Agency" title="wikilink">Central Intelligence Agency</a> estimates Croatian casualties at around 4,000 to 5,000 dead across eastern Slavonia.

<h3 id="serbian-and-yugoslav">Serbian and Yugoslav</h3>
<p>Although JNA losses were undoubtedly substantial, the exact numbers are unclear because of a lack of official data. The JNA officially acknowledged 1,279 killed in action, including 177 officers, during the entire war in Croatia.<a href="#fn148" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref148"><sup>148</sup></a> According to Anton Tus, the JNA's Novi Sad corps alone lost 1,300 soldiers during the campaign in eastern Slavonia.

<h2 id="political-aspects">Political aspects</h2>
<h3 id="propaganda">Propaganda</h3>

<p>The Serbian and Croatian media waged a fierce propaganda battle over the progress and reasons for the battle. Both sides' propaganda machines aimed to promote ultranationalist sentiments and denigrate the other side with no pretence of objectivity or self-criticism.<a href="#fn194" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref194"><sup>194</sup></a> Croatian media described the Serbian forces as &quot;Serb terrorists&quot; and a &quot;Serbo-Communist army of occupation&quot; intent on crushing a thousand-year dream of an independent Croatia.<a href="#fn195" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref195"><sup>195</sup></a> The propaganda reached peak intensity in the wake of Vukovar's fall. The Croatian newspaper <em><a href="Novi_list" title="wikilink">Novi list</a></em> denounced the Serbs as &quot;cannibals&quot; and &quot;brutal Serb extremists&quot;,<a href="#fn196" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref196"><sup>196</sup></a> while the Serbian media depicted the JNA and Serbian forces as &quot;liberators&quot; and &quot;defenders&quot; of the Serbian people, and the Croatian forces as &quot;Ustashoid hordes&quot;, &quot;blackshirts&quot;, &quot;militants&quot; and &quot;drunk and stoned monsters&quot;.<a href="#fn197" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref197"><sup>197</sup></a> There were overt appeals to racial and gender prejudice, including claims that the Croatian defenders had &quot;put on female dress to escape from the town&quot; and had recruited &quot;black men&quot;.<a href="#fn198" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref198"><sup>198</sup></a></p>
<p>Victim status became a central aim for the propaganda machines of both sides, and the battle was used to support claims of atrocities. Victims became interchangeable as anonymous victims were identified as Croats on Zagreb television and as Serbs on Belgrade TV. According to the Serbian opposition periodical <em>Republika</em>, the state-owned station <a href="TV_Novi_Sad" title="wikilink">TV Novi Sad</a> was under orders to identify any bodies its reporters filmed as being &quot;Serbian corpses&quot;.<a href="#fn199" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref199"><sup>199</sup></a> After the battle, Belgrade television showed pictures of hundreds of corpses lined up outside Vukovar's hospital and claimed that they were Serbs who had been &quot;massacred&quot; by Croatians. According to <a href="Human_Rights_Watch" title="wikilink">Human Rights Watch</a>, the bodies belonged to those who had died of their injuries at the hospital, whose staff had been prevented from burying them by the intense Serbian bombardment, and had been forced to leave them lying in the open. Serbian television continued to broadcast claims of &quot;massacred Serbs in Vukovar&quot; for some time after the fall of the town.<a href="#fn200" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref200"><sup>200</sup></a></p>
<p>Such victim-centred propaganda had a powerful motivating effect. One Serbian volunteer said that he had never seen the town before the war, but had come to fight because &quot;the Croats had a network of catacombs under the city where they killed and tortured children just because they were Serbs.&quot;<a href="#fn201" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref201"><sup>201</sup></a> <a href="Reuters" class="uri" title="wikilink">Reuters</a> reported erroneously that <a href="Vukovar_children_massacre" title="wikilink">forty-one children had been massacred</a> in Vukovar by Croatian soldiers; although the claim was retracted a day later, it was used by the Serbian media to justify military action against Croatia.<a href="#fn202" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref202"><sup>202</sup></a> Many of those fighting at Vukovar believed that they were engaged in a struggle to liberate the town from a hostile occupier.<a href="#fn203" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref203"><sup>203</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="international-reaction">International reaction</h3>
<p>The international community made repeated unsuccessful attempts to end the fighting. Both sides violated ceasefires, often within hours. Calls by some European Community members for the <a href="Western_European_Union" title="wikilink">Western European Union</a> to intervene militarily were vetoed by the United Kingdom. Instead, a Conference for Yugoslavia was established under the chairmanship of <a href="Peter_Carington,_6th_Baron_Carrington" title="wikilink">Lord Carrington</a> to find a way to end the conflict. The United Nations (UN) imposed an <a href="arms_embargo" title="wikilink">arms embargo</a> on all of the Yugoslav republics in September 1991 under <a href="United_Nations_Security_Council_Resolution_713" title="wikilink">Security Council Resolution 713</a>, but this was ineffective, in part because the JNA had no need to import weapons. The European powers abandoned attempts to keep Yugoslavia united and agreed to recognise the independence of Croatia and Slovenia on 15 January 1992.<a href="#fn204" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref204"><sup>204</sup></a></p>
<p>International observers tried unsuccessfully to prevent the human rights abuses that followed the battle. A visit by UN envoys <a href="Marrack_Goulding" title="wikilink">Marrack Goulding</a> and Cyrus Vance was systematically obstructed by the JNA. Vance's demands to see the hospital, from which wounded patients were being dragged out to be killed, were rebuffed by one of the massacre's authors, Major Veselin &lt;U+0160&gt;ljivan&lt;U+010D&gt;anin.<a href="#fn205" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref205"><sup>205</sup></a> The major also blocked Red Cross representatives in an angry confrontation recorded by TV cameras: &quot;This is my country, we have conquered this.

<p>The Croatian media gave heavy coverage to the battle, repeatedly airing broadcasts from the besieged town by the journalist Sini&lt;U+0161&gt;a Glava&lt;U+0161&gt;evi&lt;U+0107&gt;. Much popular war art focused on the &quot;VukoWAR&quot;, as posters dubbed it.<a href="#fn207" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref207"><sup>207</sup></a> The Croatian government began suppressing Glava&lt;U+0161&gt;evi&lt;U+0107&gt;'s broadcasts when it became clear that defeat was inevitable,<a href="#fn208" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref208"><sup>208</sup></a> despite the confident slogans of &quot;Vukovar shall not fall&quot; and &quot;Vukovar must not fall.&quot; Two of the main daily newspapers, <em><a href="Ve&lt;U+010D&gt;ernji_list" title="wikilink">Ve&lt;U+010D&gt;ernji list</a></em> and <em><a href="Novi_list" title="wikilink">Novi list</a></em>, failed to report the loss of Vukovar and, on 20 November, two days after it had fallen, repeated the official line that the fight was still continuing. News of the surrender was dismissed as Serbian propaganda.<ref name="Kolst<U+00F8>74&quot; /&gt; Nevertheless, many people saw Western satellite broadcasts showing the ruined town and Serbian soldiers taking its inhabitants into custody.<a href="#fn209" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref209"><sup>209</sup></a> When the surrender could no longer be denied, the two newspapers interpreted the loss as a demonstration of Croatian bravery and resistance, blaming the international community for not intervening to help Croatia.<ref name="Kolst<U+00F8>74&quot; /&gt;</p>
<p>The Croatian government was criticised for its approach to the battle.<ref name="Kolst<U+00F8>74&quot; /&gt; Surviving defenders and right-wing political parties accused it of betrayal and of deliberately sacrificing Vukovar to secure international recognition for Croatia. The only explanation that many people were willing to accept for the town's fall was that it had been given up as part of a conspiracy.<a href="#fn210" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref210"><sup>210</sup></a> The commanders of the Croatian forces in Vukovar, Mile Dedakovi&lt;U+0107&gt; and Branko Borkovi&lt;U+0107&gt;, both survived the battle and spoke out publicly against the government's actions. In an apparent attempt to silence them, both men were briefly detained by Croatian military police,<a href="#fn211" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref211"><sup>211</sup></a> and the Croatian government suppressed an issue of the newspaper <em><a href="Slobodni_tjednik" title="wikilink">Slobodni tjednik</a></em> that published a transcript of a telephone call from Vukovar, in which Dedakovi&lt;U+0107&gt; had pleaded with an evasive Tu&lt;U+0111&gt;man for military assistance. The revelations caused public outrage and reinforced perceptions that the defenders had been betrayed.<a href="#fn212" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref212"><sup>212</sup></a></p>
<p>From a military point of view, the outcome at Vukovar was not a disaster for Croatia's overall war effort. The battle broke the back of the JNA offensive and left Croatia's main adversary exhausted and unable to press its offensive deeper into the country. Vukovar was probably indefensible, being almost surrounded by Serb-held territory and closer to Belgrade than to Zagreb, and although the defeat was damaging to morale, in a strategic context the damage and delays inflicted on the JNA more than made up for the loss of the town.<a href="#fn213" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref213"><sup>213</sup></a></p>
<p>Following the battle, Vukovar became a symbol of Croatian resistance and suffering. The survivors, veterans and journalists wrote numerous memoirs, songs and testimonies about the battle and its symbolism, calling it variously &quot;the phenomenon&quot;, &quot;the pride&quot;, &quot;the hell&quot; and &quot;the Croatian knight&quot;. Writers appealed to the &quot;Vukovar principle&quot;, the &quot;spirituality of Vukovar&quot; and &quot;Vukovar ethics&quot;, the qualities said to have been exhibited by the defenders and townspeople.<a href="#fn214" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref214"><sup>214</sup></a> Croatian war veterans were presented with medals bearing the name of Vukovar.<a href="#fn215" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref215"><sup>215</sup></a> In 1994, when Croatia replaced the <a href="Yugoslav_dinar" title="wikilink">Yugoslav dinar</a> with its new currency, the <a href="Croatian_kuna" title="wikilink">kuna</a>, it used the destroyed Eltz Castle in Vukovar and the <a href="Vu&lt;U+010D&gt;edol_culture" title="wikilink">Vu&lt;U+010D&gt;edol Dove</a>Â &lt;U+2013&gt; an artefact from an ancient Neolithic culture centred on eastern Slavonia, which was discovered near VukovarÂ &lt;U+2013&gt; on the new 20-kuna note.

A truck is partly visible parked in the driveway next to the building." /> Although the battle had been fought in the name of Serbian defence and unity, reactions in Serbia were deeply divided. The JNA, the state-controlled Serbian media and Serbian ultra-nationalists hailed the victory as a triumph. The JNA even erected a triumphal arch in Belgrade through which its returning soldiers could march, and officers were congratulated for taking &quot;the toughest and fiercest Ustashe fortress&quot;.<a href="#fn221" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref221"><sup>221</sup></a> The Serbian newspaper <em><a href="Politika" class="uri" title="wikilink">Politika</a></em> ran a front-page headline on 20 November announcing: &quot;Vukovar Finally Free&quot;.<a href="#fn222" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref222"><sup>222</sup></a> In January 1992, from the ruins of Vukovar, the ultranationalist painter <a href="Mili&lt;U+0107&gt;_od_Ma&lt;U+010D&gt;ve" title="wikilink">Mili&lt;U+0107&gt; Stankovi&lt;U+0107&gt;</a> wrote an article for the Serbian periodical <em>Pogledi</em> (&quot;Viewpoints&quot;), in which he declared: &quot;Europe must know Vukovar was liberated from the Croat Nazis. They were helped by Central European scum. They crawled from under the <a href="papal_tiara" title="wikilink">papal tiara</a>, as a dart of the serpent's tongue that protruded from the bloated <a href="Kraut" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kraut</a> and overstretched Eurocommunal anus.&quot;<a href="#fn223" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref223"><sup>223</sup></a></p>
<p>The Serbian geographer Jovan Ili&lt;U+0107&gt; set out a vision for the future of the region, envisaging it being annexed to Serbia and its expelled Croatian population being replaced with Serbs from elsewhere in Croatia. The redrawing of Serbia's borders would unite all Serbs in a single state, and would cure Croats of opposition to Serbian nationalism, which Ili&lt;U+0107&gt; termed an &quot;ethno-psychic disorder&quot;; thus, &quot;the new borders should primarily be a therapy for the treatment of ethno-psychic disorders, primarily among the Croatian population.&quot; Other Serbian nationalist writers acknowledged that historical evidence was that eastern Slavonia had been Croatian for centuries, but blamed the Croatian majority in the region on &quot;conversion to Catholicism, <a href="Uniate" title="wikilink">Uniating</a> and Croatisation&quot; plus &quot;genocidal destruction&quot;. Most <a href="irrendentism" title="wikilink">irredentist</a> propaganda focused on the region's proximity to Serbia and the large number of Serbs who inhabited the area.<a href="#fn224" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref224"><sup>224</sup></a></p>
<p>The Croatian Serb leadership also took a positive view of the outcome. During the rule of the <a href="Republic_of_Serbian_Krajina" title="wikilink">Republic of Serbian Krajina</a> (RSK) between 1991 and 1995, the fall of Vukovar on 18 November 1991 was officially commemorated as &quot;Liberation Day&quot;. It was portrayed as a successful struggle by local Serbs to defend their lives and property from the aggression of the Croatian state. Thousands of Vukovar's Serbs had suffered alongside their Croatian neighbours, sheltering in basements or bomb shelters for three months in appalling conditions, but after their &quot;liberation&quot; they were denigrated as the <em>podruma&lt;U+0161&gt;i</em>, the &quot;people from the basement&quot;. The Serb civilian dead were denied recognition, and the only people buried in the Serbian memorial cemetery at Vukovar were local Serbs who had fought with or alongside the JNA.<a href="#fn225" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref225"><sup>225</sup></a></p>
<p>In contrast, many people in Serbia were strongly opposed to the battle and the wider war and resisted efforts by the state to involve them in the conflict. When the JNA tried to call up reservists, parents and relatives gathered around JNA barracks to prevent their children taking part in the operation.<a href="#fn226" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref226"><sup>226</sup></a> Resistance to conscription became widespread across Serbia, ranging from individual acts of defiance to collective mutinies by hundreds of reservists at a time. Serbian opposition politicians condemned the war: Desimir To&lt;U+0161&gt;i&lt;U+0107&gt; of the <a href="Democratic_Party_(Serbia)" title="wikilink">Democratic Party</a> accused Slobodan Milo&lt;U+0161&gt;evi&lt;U+0107&gt; of &quot;using the conflict to cling to power&quot; and <a href="Vuk_Dra&lt;U+0161&gt;kovi&lt;U+0107&gt;" title="wikilink">Vuk Dra&lt;U+0161&gt;kovi&lt;U+0107&gt;</a>, leader of the <a href="Serbian_Renewal_Movement" title="wikilink">Serbian Renewal Movement</a>, appealed to JNA soldiers to &quot;pick up their guns and run&quot; from the front line.<a href="#fn227" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref227"><sup>227</sup></a> After the fall of Vukovar he condemned what had been done in the name of Yugoslavia, writing in the daily newspaper <em><a href="Borba_(newspaper)" title="wikilink">Borba</a></em>:</p>

<p>By late December 1991, just over a month after victory had been proclaimed in Vukovar, opinion polls found that 64 per cent wanted to end the war immediately and only 27 per cent were willing to continue the war. Milo&lt;U+0161&gt;evi&lt;U+0107&gt; and other senior Serbian figures decided against continuing the fighting, as they saw it as politically impossible to mobilise more conscripts to fight in Croatia. Desertions from the JNA continued and the well-motivated and increasingly well-equipped Croatian Army was becoming increasingly difficult to counter. By the end of 1991, Serbian politicians and JNA leaders alike had concluded that it would be counter-productive to continue the war. The looming conflict in Bosnia also required the military resources tied up in Croatia to be freed for future use.<a href="#fn228" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref228"><sup>228</sup></a></p>
<p>Although the battle was publicly portrayed as a triumph, behind the scenes it profoundly affected the JNA's character and leadership. The army's leaders realised that they had overestimated their ability to pursue operations against heavily defended urban targets. The central Croatian town of <a href="Gospi&lt;U+0107&gt;" class="uri" title="wikilink">Gospi&lt;U+0107&gt;</a>, for instance, was a strategic target of the JNA but was now assessed as potentially a &quot;second Vukovar&quot;. The &quot;Serbianisation&quot; of the army was greatly accelerated, and by the end of 1991 it was estimated to be 90 per cent Serb. Its formerly pro-Communist, pan-Yugoslav identity was abandoned, and new officers were now advised to &quot;love, above all else, their unit, their army, and their homelandÂ &lt;U+2013&gt; Serbia and Montenegro&quot;. The JNA's failure enabled the Serbian government to tighten its control over the military, whose leadership was purged and replaced with pro-Milo&lt;U+0161&gt;evi&lt;U+0107&gt; nationalists. After the battle General Veljko Kadijevi&lt;U+0107&gt;, commander of the JNA, was forced into retirement for &quot;health reasons&quot;, and in early 1992 another thirty-eight generals and other officers were forced to retire, with several put on trial for incompetence and treason.<a href="#fn229" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref229"><sup>229</sup></a></p>
<p>Many individual JNA soldiers who took part in the battle were revolted by what they had seen and protested to their superiors about the behaviour of the paramilitaries. Colonel Milorad Vu&lt;U+010D&gt;i&lt;U+0107&gt; later commented that &quot;they simply do not want to die for such things&quot;. The slaughter that they witnessed at Vukovar led some to experience subsequent feelings of trauma and guilt. A JNA veteran told a journalist from the Arabic newspaper <em><a href="Asharq_Al-Awsat" title="wikilink">Asharq Al-Awsat</a></em>:</p>

We do not want this war.&quot;<a href="#fn230" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref230"><sup>230</sup></a> When JNA troops transferred to the front via the <a href="Vi&lt;U+0161&gt;egrad" class="uri" title="wikilink">Vi&lt;U+0161&gt;egrad</a> region of north-eastern Bosnia, local Bosnian Croats and Muslims set up barricades and machine-gun posts. They halted a column of 60 JNA tanks but were dispersed by force the following day. More than 1,000 people had to flee the area.

<p>Macedonia's parliament adopted a declaration of independence from Yugoslavia in January 1991, but it did not take effect until a referendum in September 1991 confirmed it. A group of Macedonian JNA officers secretly sought to prevent soldiers from Macedonia being sent to Croatia, and busloads of soldiers' parents, funded by the Macedonian government, travelled to Montenegro to find their sons and bring them home.<a href="#fn232" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref232"><sup>232</sup></a> Meanwhile, Macedonians continued to be conscripted into the JNA and serve in the war in Croatia.<a href="#fn233" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref233"><sup>233</sup></a> The commander of JNA forces in the first phase of the battle, General Aleksandar Spirkovski, was a Macedonian; his ethnicity was probably a significant factor in the decision to replace him with &lt;U+017D&gt;ivota Pani&lt;U+0107&gt;, a Serb.<a href="#fn234" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref234"><sup>234</sup></a> In 2005, the Macedonian Army's Chief of Staff, General Miroslav Stojanovski, became the focus of international controversy after it was alleged that he had been involved in possible war crimes following the battle.<a href="#fn235" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref235"><sup>235</sup></a></p>

<p>Vukovar suffered catastrophic damage in the battle. Croatian officials estimated that 90 per cent of Vukovar's housing stock was damaged or destroyed,<a href="#fn236" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref236"><sup>236</sup></a> and put the cost at $2.5Â billion.<a href="#fn237" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref237"><sup>237</sup></a> The town barely recovered during its seven years under Serb control.<a href="#fn238" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref238"><sup>238</sup></a> Marcus Tanner of <em><a href="The_Independent" title="wikilink">The Independent</a></em> described post-battle Vukovar as:</p>

<p>When <a href="Michael_Ignatieff" title="wikilink">Michael Ignatieff</a> visited Vukovar in 1992, he found the inhabitants living in squalor:</p>

<p>The population increased to about 20,000 as Serb refugees from other parts of Croatia and Bosnia were relocated by RSK authorities. They initially lived without water or electricity, in damaged buildings patched up with plastic sheeting and wooden boards.<a href="#fn239" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref239"><sup>239</sup></a> Residents scavenged the ruins for fragments of glass that they could stick back together to make windows for themselves.<a href="#fn240" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref240"><sup>240</sup></a> The main sources of income were <a href="war_profiteering" title="wikilink">war profiteering</a> and smuggling, though some were able to find jobs in eastern Slavonia's revived oil industry.<a href="#fn241" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref241"><sup>241</sup></a> Reconstruction was greatly delayed by economic sanctions and lack of international aid.<a href="#fn242" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref242"><sup>242</sup></a></p>

<p>After the <a href="Erdut_Agreement" title="wikilink">Erdut Agreement</a> was signed in 1995, the <a href="United_Nations_Transitional_Authority_for_Eastern_Slavonia,_Baranja_and_Western_Sirmium" title="wikilink">United Nations Transitional Authority for Eastern Slavonia, Baranja and Western Sirmium</a> (UNTAES) was established to enable the return of Croatian refugees and to prepare the region for reintegration into Croatia. This UN peacekeeping force provided security during the transition period between 1996 and 1998.<a href="#fn243" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref243"><sup>243</sup></a> It was only in 1999 that Croats began returning to Vukovar in significant numbers, and many of the pre-war inhabitants never returned. By March 2001, the municipality was recorded as having 31,670 inhabitantsÂ &lt;U+2013&gt; less than half the pre-war totalÂ &lt;U+2013&gt; of whom 18,199 (57.46%) were Croats and 10,412 (32.88%) were Serbs. The community did not recover its mixed character: Croats and Serbs now lived separate social lives. Public facilities such as shops, caf&lt;U+00E9&gt;s, restaurants, sports clubs, schools, non-governmental organisations and radio stations were re-established on segregated lines, with separate facilities for each community.<a href="#fn244" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref244"><sup>244</sup></a></p>
<p>Although the Croatian government sponsored reconstruction efforts in and around Vukovar, the Serb-populated town centre remained in ruins until 2003.

Outlined against the blue sky are the cross and three vertically hung flags." /> Signs of the battle are still widely apparent in Vukovar, where many buildings remain visibly scarred by bullets and shrapnel. The riverside water tower has been preserved in its badly damaged state as a memorial. The town hospital presents an exhibition and reconstruction of the conditions in the building during the battle. At Ov&lt;U+010D&gt;ara, the site of the massacre is marked by a mass grave and exhibition about the atrocity. Local tourist guides, some of whom lived through the battle, offer tourists the opportunity to visit these and other sites on walking and bicycle tours.<a href="#fn249" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref249"><sup>249</sup></a></p>
<p>Every November, Vukovar's authorities hold four days of festivities to commemorate the fall of the town, culminating in a &quot;Procession of Memory&quot; held on 18 November. This represents the expulsion of the town's Croatian inhabitants and involves a five-kilometre (3.1 mile) walk from the city's hospital to the Croatian Memorial Cemetery of Homeland War Victims. It is attended by tens of thousands of people from across Croatia.<a href="#fn250" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref250"><sup>250</sup></a></p>
<p>Local Serbs have avoided participating in the Croatian commemorations, often preferring either to leave the town or stay indoors on 18 November. They have held a separate low-key commemoration at the Serbian military cemetery on 17 November,<a href="#fn251" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref251"><sup>251</sup></a> until 2003 and on 18 November since then. The RSK-era term &quot;Liberation Day&quot; has been dropped, but the Serbs also avoid the Croatian terminology, instead calling it simply &quot;18 November&quot;.<a href="#fn252" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref252"><sup>252</sup></a></p>
<p>The issue of how to remember the Serbian dead has posed particular difficulties. Local Serbs who died fighting alongside the JNA were buried by the Croatian Serb authorities on a plot of land where Croatian houses had once stood.<a href="#fn253" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref253"><sup>253</sup></a> The gravestones were originally topped with a sculptural evocation of the V-shaped Serbian military cap, or <em><a href="&lt;U+0161&gt;ajka&lt;U+010D&gt;a" class="uri" title="wikilink">&lt;U+0161&gt;ajka&lt;U+010D&gt;a</a></em>. After Vukovar's reintegration into Croatia the gravestones were repeatedly vandalised. The Serb community replaced them with more neutral gravestones without overt military connotations.<a href="#fn254" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref254"><sup>254</sup></a></p>
<p>Vukovar Serbs report feeling marginalised and excluded from places associated with Croatian nationalist sentiment, such as monuments to the Croatian defenders. The Croatian sociologist Kruno Kardov gives the example of a prominent memorial, a large cross made from white stone, where the <a href="Vuka" class="uri" title="wikilink">Vuka</a> flows into the Danube. According to Kardov, Serbs rarely if ever go there, and they feel great stress if they do. A Serb boy spoke of how he wanted to know what was written on the monument but was too frightened to go and read the inscription; one day he got up the courage, ran to the monument, read it and immediately ran back to &quot;safety&quot;. As Kardov puts it, Vukovar remains divided by an &quot;invisible boundary line ... inscribed only on the cognitive map of the members of one particular group.&quot;<a href="#fn255" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref255"><sup>255</sup></a></p>
<p>The battle is widely commemorated across Croatia. Almost every town has streets named after Vukovar,<a href="#fn256" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref256"><sup>256</sup></a> and the lead vessel of the <a href="Croatian_Navy" title="wikilink">Croatian Navy</a>'s two new <a href="Helsinki_class_missile_boat" title="wikilink"><em>Helsinki</em>-class missile boats</a> was named the <em>Vukovar</em> in January 2009.<a href="#fn257" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref257"><sup>257</sup></a> The Croatian Parliament has declared 18 November to be the &quot;Remembrance Day of the Sacrifice of Vukovar in 1991&quot;, when &quot;all those who participated in the defence of the city of Vukovar &lt;U+2013&gt; the symbol of Croatian freedom &lt;U+2013&gt; are appropriately honoured with dignity.&quot;<a href="#fn258" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref258"><sup>258</sup></a></p>
<p>As a symbol of Croatia's national identity, Vukovar has become a place of pilgrimage for people from across Croatia who seek to evoke feelings of &quot;vicarious insideness&quot;, as Kruno Kardov described them, in the suffering endured during the country's war of independence. Some gather in front of the town's main memorial cross on New Year's Eve to pray as the year ends, though such sentiments have attracted criticism from local Croats for not allowing them to &quot;rejoice for even a single night&quot;, as one put it.<a href="#fn259" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref259"><sup>259</sup></a> The town has thus become, in Kardov's words, &quot;the embodiment of a pure Croatian identity&quot;, and the battle &quot;the foundational myth of the Croatian state&quot;. This has led to it becoming as much an &quot;imagined place&quot;, a receptacle for Croatian national sentiment and symbolism, as a real place. Kardov concludes that it is questionable whether Vukovar can realise a vision of once again becoming &quot;one place for all its citizens&quot;.<a href="#fn260" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref260"><sup>260</sup></a></p>
<p>In November 2010 <a href="Boris_Tadi&lt;U+0107&gt;" title="wikilink">Boris Tadi&lt;U+0107&gt;</a> became the first President of Serbia to travel to Vukovar, when he visited the massacre site at Ov&lt;U+010D&gt;ara and expressed his &quot;apology and regret&quot;.<a href="#fn261" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref261"><sup>261</sup></a></p>
