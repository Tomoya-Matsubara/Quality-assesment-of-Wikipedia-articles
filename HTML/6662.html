<p><strong>Knowle West</strong> is a neighbourhood situated on a low plateau in the south of <a href="Bristol" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bristol</a>, England, about  from the centre of the city. Most of the area is coterminous with the <a href="Filwood_(ward)" title="wikilink">Filwood</a> ward of <a href="Bristol_City_Council" title="wikilink">Bristol City Council</a>, although a small part of the estate lies within <a href="Knowle,_Bristol" title="wikilink">Knowle</a> ward to the east. To the west are <a href="Bishopsworth" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bishopsworth</a> and <a href="Hartcliffe" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hartcliffe</a>. To the north are <a href="Bedminster,_Bristol" title="wikilink">Bedminster</a> and <a href="Windmill_Hill,_Bristol" title="wikilink">Windmill Hill</a> and to the south <a href="Whitchurch_Park_(ward)" title="wikilink">Whitchurch Park</a> and <a href="Hengrove" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hengrove</a>. The population as of 2008 was estimated as 11,787. The area is approximately  in extent.</p>
<p>There is evidence of late <a href="British_Iron_Age" title="wikilink">Iron Age</a> and <a href="Roman_Britain" title="wikilink">Roman</a> settlements in the area. At the time of the <a href="Domesday_Book" title="wikilink">Domesday Book</a>, Knowle was a rural area assessed at a taxable value of two <a href="Weregild" title="wikilink">geld</a> units. Knowle West remained rural in character until the 1930s when a <a href="council_house" title="wikilink">council housing</a> estate was developed to provide homes for Bristolians displaced by slum clearance in the centre of the city.</p>
<p>Famous former residents include the musician <a href="Tricky" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tricky</a>, the boxer <a href="Dixie_Brown" title="wikilink">Dixie Brown</a> and late 1950s <a href="rock_and_roll" title="wikilink">rock and roll</a> band <a href="The_Eagles_(UK_band)" title="wikilink">The Eagles</a>. There are five schools and four churches in Knowle West, as well as a number of open spaces, community centres, youth clubs and shopping facilities. Community activities include the Knowle West Media Centre, the Residents' Planning Group and the Knowle West Health Association. There are no major employers in Knowle West but there are many small local enterprises and larger businesses on nearby trading estates. The closure of the <a href="Imperial_Tobacco" title="wikilink">Imperial Tobacco</a> factory at nearby <a href="Hartcliffe" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hartcliffe</a> in 1990 caused a large number of job losses. Just under a third of the residents are classed as economically inactive and the area is one of the most economically deprived in Bristol.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> Knowle West has relatively high indices of crime and drug use, but community efforts to combat this have had some success.</p>
