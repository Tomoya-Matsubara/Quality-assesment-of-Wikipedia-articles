<p>With the end of communism, Pascu diversified his career as an entertainer.

<p>Pascu recalled that during the 1990s, Divertis had to perform dozens of consecutive encores while on tour, which interfered with the group's regular <em><a href="Twin_Peaks" title="wikilink">Twin Peaks</a></em> viewing parties.<a href="#fn82" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref82"><sup>82</sup></a> According to <em><a href="Gardianul" class="uri" title="wikilink">Gardianul</a></em> newspaper, Pascu's activity with <em>Divertis</em> turned him into &quot;one of the most popular figures in homegrown comedy&quot;.<a href="#fn83" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref83"><sup>83</sup></a> In his 2006 interview with <em><a href="Dilema_Veche" title="wikilink">Dilema Veche</a></em>, <em>Divertis</em> founder <a href="Toni_Grecu" title="wikilink">Toni Grecu</a> recalled that Pascu was notable as the only group member not born in the <a href="Historical_regions_of_Romania" title="wikilink">historical region</a> of <a href="Moldavia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Moldavia</a>.<a href="#fn84" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref84"><sup>84</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1993, Pascu experienced his first significant success in music with the album <em>Mixed Grill</em> and the single &quot;&lt;U+0162&gt;ara arde &lt;U+015F&gt;i babele se piapt&lt;U+0103&gt;n&lt;U+0103&gt;&quot; (&quot;The Country Is Burning and Old Women Are Combing Their Hair&quot;, referencing a Romanian proverb).<a href="#fn85" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref85"><sup>85</sup></a><a href="#fn86" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref86"><sup>86</sup></a> A poll conducted by the journal <em><a href="Evenimentul_Zilei" title="wikilink">Evenimentul Zilei</a></em> nominated the track as the best song of 1993, and the nation-wide station <a href="Kiss_FM_(Romania)" title="wikilink">Radio Contact</a> awarded Pascu its &quot;Composer of the Year&quot; title.<a href="#fn87" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref87"><sup>87</sup></a><a href="#fn88" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref88"><sup>88</sup></a> <em>Mixed Grill</em> marked Pascu's brief experimentation with a fusion of rock and reggae. Hits such as &quot;Gizzi&quot; and &quot;Mi-am luat colac&quot; (&quot;I Got Me a Lifebuoy&quot;) led some to consider him one of the pioneers of Romanian reggae, years ahead of acts like <a href="El_Negro_(band)" title="wikilink">El Negro</a> and <a href="Pacha_Man" title="wikilink">Pacha Man</a>.<a href="#fn89" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref89"><sup>89</sup></a> The mix of genres became characteristic of Pascu's work in music: &quot;When I was writing records, I figured that, should someone, say, be playing my record at a party, they would have several kinds to choose from, and they would not grow bored. But it's not because of that, I think that's how inspiration visits me, that this is how I write. I won't stick to any one musical genre.&quot;<a href="#fn90" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref90"><sup>90</sup></a> In addition to the piano, guitar and drums, Pascu also began playing the <a href="harmonica" class="uri" title="wikilink">harmonica</a>.<a href="#fn91" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref91"><sup>91</sup></a></p>

Bivolaru's legal troubles and allegations regarding MISA's sexual policies were the center of public debates; when contacted by reporters, Pascu stressed that it was a regular gig and stated, &quot;Those people have never harmed me and I have no reason to be avoiding their company.&quot;<a href="#fn163" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref163"><sup>163</sup></a> Pascu's activities for that year included other live concerts, including one held during the <a href="Bookfest" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bookfest</a> event of June.<a href="#fn164" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref164"><sup>164</sup></a> In November, he was a guest at the <a href="Mircea_Baniciu" title="wikilink">Mircea Baniciu</a> tribute concert, entertaining the public with musical impressions of folk singers <a href="Nicu_Alifantis" title="wikilink">Nicu Alifantis</a> and <a href="Victor_Socaciu" title="wikilink">Victor Socaciu</a>, and performing <a href="Pas&lt;U+0103&gt;rea_Colibri" title="wikilink">Pas&lt;U+0103&gt;rea Colibri</a> classics.<a href="#fn165" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref165"><sup>165</sup></a> Pascu also purchased his own drinking establishment and live music venue, a Bucharest tavern he named <em>Gyuri's Pub</em>, which hosted performances by the <a href="Moldova" title="wikilink">Moldovan</a> folk singer <a href="Radu_Captari" title="wikilink">Radu Captari</a>.

<h3 id="stroke-and-divertis-split">2010 stroke and <em>Divertis</em> split</h3>
<p>In late 2010, it was reported that Pascu had suffered a <a href="stroke" class="uri" title="wikilink">stroke</a> and was recovering at the <a href="University_Hospital_of_Bucharest" title="wikilink">University Hospital of Bucharest</a>.<a href="#fn168" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref168"><sup>168</sup></a><a href="#fn169" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref169"><sup>169</sup></a> Romania's media speculated that the stroke was caused by the stress of his divorce, although Pascu had stated that the separation was amiable.<a href="#fn170" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref170"><sup>170</sup></a> His career was jeopardized by the stroke, so Pascu decided to quit drinking alcohol.<a href="#fn171" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref171"><sup>171</sup></a> Pascu resumed artistic life, studying for the part of Cad&lt;U+00E2&gt;r in <a href="Victor_Ion_Popa" title="wikilink">Victor Ion Popa</a>'s comedy <em><a href="Take,_Ianke_and_Cad&lt;U+00E2&gt;r" title="wikilink">Take, Ianke and Cad&lt;U+00E2&gt;r</a></em>. The production went on a tour of Romanian theaters in the early months of 2011.<a href="#fn172" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref172"><sup>172</sup></a></p>
<p>Pascu returned to <em>Land of Jokes</em>, the comedic series produced by one half of <em>Divertis</em> for Pro TV, where he played the lead character <em>Nemuriciul</em> (a spoof on <em><a href="Highlander:_The_Series" title="wikilink">Highlander: The Series</a></em>).<a href="#fn173" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref173"><sup>173</sup></a><a href="#fn174" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref174"><sup>174</sup></a> His return highlighted the conflict between Toni Grecu, who was producing a political comedy show for the same station, and the less politicized <em>Land of Jokes</em>.<a href="#fn175" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref175"><sup>175</sup></a> In June 2011, Pascu and the other <em>Land of Jokes</em> comedians announced that their split with <em>Divertis</em> was final, and that their contract with Pro TV had reached an end.

<p>The new comedy troupe took the name <em>Distractis</em>, since &quot;the <em>Land of Jokes</em> brand was left with Pro TV&quot;,<a href="#fn179" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref179"><sup>179</sup></a> and in August 2011, signed with TVR 1.<a href="#fn180" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref180"><sup>180</sup></a><a href="#fn181" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref181"><sup>181</sup></a> Media analyst Iulian Comanescu stated about the move, &quot;The [<em>Distractis</em>] program managed a fifth place in ratings.
