<h2 id="early-years-and-iio">Early years and iiO</h2>
<p>Nadia Ali was born in <a href="Libya" class="uri" title="wikilink">Libya</a> to <a href="Pakistani_people" title="wikilink">Pakistani</a> parents in 1980. The family relocated to <a href="Queens" class="uri" title="wikilink">Queens</a>, <a href="New_York_City" title="wikilink">New York City</a>, when she was still a child, and has remained there.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>Ali has stated in interviews that the music that most influenced her growing up includes <a href="Stevie_Nicks" title="wikilink">Stevie Nicks</a>, <a href="Sade_(band)" title="wikilink">Sade</a>, <a href="Nusrat_Fateh_Ali_Khan" title="wikilink">Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan</a>, <a href="U2" class="uri" title="wikilink">U2</a>, <a href="Madonna_(entertainer)" title="wikilink">Madonna</a>, <a href="Led_Zeppelin" title="wikilink">Led Zeppelin</a>, <a href="Carole_King" title="wikilink">Carole King</a>, <a href="Carly_Simon" title="wikilink">Carly Simon</a> and <a href="The_Beatles" title="wikilink">The Beatles</a>.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>A 17 year old Ali was working in the New York offices of <a href="Gianni_Versace_S.p.A." title="wikilink">Versace</a>, and aspiring to start a music career, when a co-worker introduced her to producer Markus Moser, who was looking for a female singer to collaborate on some of his original dance music production.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> The two teamed up and started a group that was originally named &quot;Vaiio&quot;, named after the Sony laptop Nadia was working on. They later dropped the &quot;va&quot; to avoid causing problems in the future with <a href="Sony" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sony</a>. Working with Moser, she wrote the lyrics and the vocals for the songs. After the success of the 2001 hit &quot;<a href="Rapture_(iiO_song)" title="wikilink">Rapture</a>&quot;, the single was remixed many times by the likes of <a href="Armin_Van_Buuren" title="wikilink">Armin Van Buuren</a>, <a href="John_Creamer_&amp;_Stephane_K" title="wikilink">John Creamer &amp; Stephane K</a> and <a href="Deep_Dish" title="wikilink">Deep Dish</a> with <a href="Mashup_(music)" title="wikilink">bootleg</a> and <a href="white_label" title="wikilink">white label</a> remixes emerging as well. The duo toured all over the world for years and released more singles, including &quot;<a href="At_the_End" title="wikilink">At the End</a>&quot;, &quot;<a href="Runaway_(iiO_song)" title="wikilink">Runaway</a>&quot;, &quot;<a href="Smooth_(iiO_song)" title="wikilink">Smooth</a>&quot; and &quot;<a href="Kiss_You" title="wikilink">Kiss You</a>&quot;.</p>
<p>Ali left the group in 2005 to pursue a solo career and released her debut album, <em><a href="Poetica" class="uri" title="wikilink">Poetica</a></em>, in 2006, while Moser continues to release iiO material featuring her on vocals. Most notably, these releases include the 2006 single &quot;<a href="Is_It_Love?" title="wikilink">Is It Love?</a>&quot; which went to #1 in America on the Billboard Dance Chart, and the 2007 Album <em><a href="Reconstruction_Time:_The_Best_Of_iiO_Remixed" title="wikilink">Reconstruction Time: The Best Of iiO Remixed</a></em>.</p>
