Designed by architect <a href="Henry_Janeway_Hardenbergh" title="wikilink">Henry Janeway Hardenbergh</a>, Geology Hall was built in 1872 with funds raised by the college's president, <a href="William_H._Campbell" title="wikilink">William H. Campbell</a> for the purpose of facilitating the expansion of science and agriculture education. Rutgers expanded these programs after being named New Jersey's only <a href="Land-grant_university" title="wikilink">land grant college</a>. As part of the Queen's Campus, Geology Hall was included on the <a href="New_Jersey_Register_of_Historic_Places" title="wikilink">New Jersey Register of Historic Places</a> and the <a href="National_Register_of_Historic_Places" title="wikilink">National Register of Historic Places</a> in 1973.</p>
<p>At present, the building houses administrative offices and the university's geological museum. The museum, which is among the oldest collegiate geology collections in the United States, was founded by state geologist and Rutgers professor <a href="George_Hammell_Cook" title="wikilink">George Hammell Cook</a> in 1872.

<p>In 1864, Rutgers College was named New Jersey's sole <a href="Land-grant_university" title="wikilink">land grant college</a> which provided federal funding pursuant to the <a href="Morrill_Land-Grant_Acts" title="wikilink">Morrill Act of 1862</a> for the development of engineering, scientific, agricultural, and military education at one school in each state.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a><a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> The state's selection of Rutgers (instead of the <a href="Princeton_University" title="wikilink">College of New Jersey</a>, now Princeton University) was largely influenced by the efforts of <a href="George_Hammell_Cook" title="wikilink">George Hammell Cook</a> (1818&lt;U+2013&gt;1889), a professor of chemistry and natural sciences who became the college's vice president and appointed state geologist in 1864.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a><a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a><a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> With the college's land-grant status and funding appropriated for scientific studies, Cook's role would grow to include research and teaching in the areas of geology and agriculture.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a><a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>

<p>Hardenbergh's design was described as employing both Gothic elements and <a href="Classical_architecture" title="wikilink">classical</a> forms that preceded the extreme <a href="Eclecticism_in_architecture" title="wikilink">eclecticism</a> that was to mark a later <a href="Victorian_architecture" title="wikilink">Victorian</a> Gothic Revival period.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> The original plans called for the building to be constructed out of <a href="red_brick" title="wikilink">red brick</a>.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> However, Hardenbergh and the trustees agreed that building with brick would be too expensive, and the design was revised to use <a href="Brownstone" title="wikilink">New Jersey brownstone</a> that would complement the exterior of the college's oldest building, <a href="Old_Queens" title="wikilink">Old Queens</a> (built 1809&lt;U+2013&gt;1823).<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a><a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> Geology Hall, built on the south side of Old Queens, was the second of three projects that Hardenberg designed for the college, following an addition to a building (now <a href="Alexander_Johnston_Hall" title="wikilink">Alexander Johnston Hall</a>) that housed the college's grammar school (now <a href="Rutgers_Preparatory_School" title="wikilink">Rutgers Preparatory School</a>) the year before.

<p>Today, Geology Hall houses offices of the university's administration and the Rutgers Geology Museum.
