<h2 id="biography">Biography</h2>
<p>Rebecca West was born Cicely Isabel Fairfield in 1892 in London and grew up in a home full of intellectual stimulation, political debate, lively company, books, and music.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> Her mother, Isabella, a Scotswoman, was an accomplished pianist but did not pursue a musical career after her marriage to Charles Fairfield. Charles, an <a href="Anglo-Irish" class="uri" title="wikilink">Anglo-Irish</a> journalist of considerable reputation but financial incompetence, deserted his family when Cicely was 8 years old. He never rejoined them and died impoverished and alone in a boarding house in <a href="Liverpool" class="uri" title="wikilink">Liverpool</a> in 1906, when Cicely was 14.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> The rest of the family moved to <a href="Edinburgh" class="uri" title="wikilink">Edinburgh</a>, Scotland, where Cicely was educated at <a href="George_Watson&#39;s_Ladies_College" title="wikilink">George Watson's Ladies College</a>. She had to leave school in 1907 due to a bout of <a href="tuberculosis" class="uri" title="wikilink">tuberculosis</a>.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> Cicely did not have any formal schooling after the age of 16, due to lack of funds.</p>
<p>She had two older sisters. Letitia (&quot;Lettie&quot;), who was the best educated of the three, became one of the first fully qualified female doctors in Britain, as well as a <a href="barrister" class="uri" title="wikilink">barrister</a> at the <a href="Inns_of_Court" title="wikilink">Inns of Court</a>. Winifred (&quot;Winnie&quot;), the middle sister, married Norman Macleod, Principal Assistant Secretary in the <a href="Admiralty" class="uri" title="wikilink">Admiralty</a>, and eventually director general of Greenwich Hospital. Winnie's two children, Alison and Norman, became closely involved in Rebecca's life as she got older;<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> Alison Macleod would achieve a literary career of her own.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> West trained as an actress in London, taking the name 'Rebecca West' from the rebellious young heroine in <em><a href="Rosmersholm" class="uri" title="wikilink">Rosmersholm</a></em> by <a href="Henrik_Ibsen" title="wikilink">Henrik Ibsen</a>. She and Lettie became involved in the <a href="Women&#39;s_suffrage_in_the_United_Kingdom" title="wikilink">women's suffrage movement</a>, participating in street protests. Meanwhile, West worked as a journalist on <em><a href="Freewoman" class="uri" title="wikilink">Freewoman</a></em> and the <em><a href="Clarion_(newspaper)" title="wikilink">Clarion</a></em>, drumming up support for the suffragette cause. She met <a href="H._G._Wells" title="wikilink">H. G. Wells</a> in 1913, after her provocatively damning review of his novel <em>Marriage</em> prompted him to invite her to lunch. They fell in love, though Wells was still in his second marriage at the time, and their affair lasted ten years, producing a son, <a href="Anthony_West_(author)" title="wikilink">Anthony West</a>. West is also said to have had affairs with <a href="Charlie_Chaplin" title="wikilink">Charlie Chaplin</a> and newspaper magnate <a href="Max_Aitken,_1st_Baron_Beaverbrook" title="wikilink">Lord Beaverbrook</a>.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="early-career">Early career</h3>
<p><img src="RWestLowRes.jpeg" title="fig:Rebecca West ca. 1923" alt="Rebecca West ca. 1923" /> West established her reputation as an eloquent spokesperson for feminist and socialist causes and as a sharp-witted critic, turning out a staggering number of essays and reviews for <em><a href="The_New_Republic" title="wikilink">The New Republic</a></em>, <em><a href="New_York_Herald_Tribune" title="wikilink">New York Herald Tribune</a></em>, <em><a href="New_York_American" title="wikilink">New York American</a></em>, <em><a href="New_Statesman" title="wikilink">New Statesman</a></em>, <em><a href="The_Daily_Telegraph" title="wikilink">The Daily Telegraph</a></em>, and many more newspapers and magazines. <a href="George_Bernard_Shaw" title="wikilink">George Bernard Shaw</a> said in 1916 that &quot;Rebecca West could handle a pen as brilliantly as ever I could and much more savagely.&quot;<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> During the 1920s, West began a lifelong habit of visits to the U.S. to give lectures, meet artists, and get involved in the political scene. There, she befriended <a href="Central_Intelligence_Agency" title="wikilink">CIA</a> founder <a href="Allen_Dulles" title="wikilink">Allen Dulles</a>, Charlie Chaplin, <a href="Harold_Ross" title="wikilink">Harold Ross</a> of <em><a href="The_New_Yorker" title="wikilink">The New Yorker</a></em> , and historian <a href="Arthur_Schlesinger,_Jr." title="wikilink">Arthur Schlesinger, Jr.</a>, among many other significant figures of the day. Her lifelong fascination with the United States culminated in 1948 when <a href="Harry_S._Truman" title="wikilink">President Truman</a> presented her with the Women's Press Club Award for Journalism, calling her &quot;the world's best reporter.&quot;<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1930, at the age of 37, she married a banker, Henry Maxwell Andrews, and they remained together until his death in 1968. West's writing brought her considerable wealth, and by 1940 she owned a <a href="Rolls-Royce_(car)" title="wikilink">Rolls Royce</a> and a grand country estate, Ibstone House, in the <a href="Chiltern_Hills" title="wikilink">Chiltern Hills</a> of southern England. It is testament to her financial savvy that both the Rolls and the country estate were acquired for a fraction of their worth from insolvent owners. During World War II, West housed Yugoslav refugees in the spare rooms of her blacked-out manor, and she used the grounds as a small dairy farm and vegetable plot, agricultural pursuits that continued long after the war had ended.</p>
<h3 id="later-life">Later life</h3>
<p>As West grew older, she turned to broader political and social issues, including humankind's propensity to inflict violent injustice on itself. Before and during World War II, West traveled widely, collecting material for books on travel and politics. In 1936-38, she made three trips to Yugoslavia, a country she came to love, seeing it as the nexus of European history since the late Middle Ages. Her non-fiction masterpiece, <em>Black Lamb and Grey Falcon</em> is an amalgamation of her impressions from these trips. <em><a href="The_New_York_Times" title="wikilink">New York Times</a></em> reviewer Katherine Woods wrote: &quot;In two almost incredibly full-packed volumes one of the most gifted and searching of modern English novelists and critics has produced not only the magnification and intensification of the travel book form, but, one may say, its apotheosis.&quot; West was assigned by Ross' magazine to cover the <a href="Nuremberg_Trials" title="wikilink">Nuremberg Trials</a> for <em>The New Yorker</em>, an experience she memorialized in the book <em>A Train of Powder</em>. She also went to <a href="South_Africa" title="wikilink">South Africa</a> in 1960 to report on <a href="Apartheid" class="uri" title="wikilink">Apartheid</a> in a series of articles for the <em><a href="Sunday_Times" title="wikilink">Sunday Times</a></em>.</p>
<p>She traveled extensively well into old age. In 1966 and 1969, she undertook two long journeys to <a href="Mexico" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mexico</a>, becoming fascinated by the indigenous culture of the country and its <a href="mestizo" class="uri" title="wikilink">mestizo</a> population. She stayed with actor <a href="Romney_Brent" title="wikilink">Romney Brent</a> in <a href="Mexico_City" title="wikilink">Mexico City</a> and with Katherine (Kit) Wright, a long-time friend, in <a href="Cuernavaca" class="uri" title="wikilink">Cuernavaca</a>.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> She collected a large number of travel impressions and wrote tens of thousands of words for a &quot;follow-up&quot; volume to <em>Black Lamb and Grey Falcon</em>, tentatively titled &quot;Survivors in Mexico.&quot; The work, however, was never finished, and only saw publication posthumously in 2003. Even into her late 70s, she visited <a href="Lebanon" class="uri" title="wikilink">Lebanon</a>, <a href="Venice" class="uri" title="wikilink">Venice</a>, <a href="Monte_Carlo" title="wikilink">Monte Carlo</a>, and always went back to the United States.</p>
<h3 id="old-age">Old age</h3>
<p>After her husband's death in 1968, West moved to <a href="London" class="uri" title="wikilink">London</a>, where she bought a spacious apartment overlooking <a href="Hyde_Park,_London" title="wikilink">Hyde Park</a>. Unfortunately, it was next door to the <a href="Iran" title="wikilink">Iranian</a> embassy. During the <a href="Iranian_Embassy_Siege" title="wikilink">May 1980 incident</a>, West, then 87, had to be evacuated.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> In the last two decades of her life, West kept up a very active social life, making friends with <a href="Martha_Gellhorn" title="wikilink">Martha Gellhorn</a>, <a href="Doris_Lessing" title="wikilink">Doris Lessing</a>, <a href="Bernard_Levin" title="wikilink">Bernard Levin</a>, comedian <a href="Frankie_Howerd" title="wikilink">Frankie Howerd</a>, and film star and director <a href="Warren_Beatty" title="wikilink">Warren Beatty</a>, who filmed her for the movie <em><a href="Reds_(film)" title="wikilink">Reds</a></em>, a biography of journalist <a href="John_Reed_(journalist)" title="wikilink">John Reed</a> and his connection with the <a href="Russian_Revolution_(1917)" title="wikilink">Russian Revolution</a>. She also spent time with scholars such as <a href="Jane_Marcus" title="wikilink">Jane Marcus</a> and Bonnie Kime Scott, who began to chronicle her feminist career and varied work.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> She wrote at an unabated pace, penning masterful reviews for the <em><a href="Sunday_Telegraph" title="wikilink">Sunday Telegraph</a></em>, publishing her last novel <em>The Birds Fall Down</em> (1966), and overseeing the film version of the story by <a href="BBC" class="uri" title="wikilink">BBC</a> in 1978. The last work published in her lifetime was <em>1900</em> (1982). <em>1900</em> explored the last year of <a href="Victoria_of_the_United_Kingdom" title="wikilink">Queen Victoria</a>'s long reign, which was a watershed in many cultural and political respects.</p>
<p>At the same time, West worked on sequels to her autobiographically inspired novel <em>The Fountain Overflows</em> (1957); although she had written the equivalent of two more novels for the planned trilogy, she was never satisfied with the sequels and did not publish them. She also tinkered at great length with an autobiography, without coming to closure, and she started scores of stories without finishing them. Much of her work from the late phase of her life was published posthumously, including <em>Family Memories</em> (1987), <em>This Real Night</em> (1984), <em>Cousin Rosamund</em> (1985), <em>The Only Poet</em> (1992), and <em>Survivors in Mexico</em> (2003). Unfinished works from her early period, notably <em>Sunflower</em> (1986) and <em>The Sentinel</em> (2001) were also published after her death, so that her <em>oeuvre</em> was augmented by about one third by posthumous publications.</p>
<h3 id="relationship-with-her-son">Relationship with her son</h3>
<p>West's relationship with her son, Anthony Panther West, was not a happy one. The rancor between them came to a head when Anthony, himself a gifted writer, his father's biographer (<em>H. G. Wells: Aspects of a Life</em> [1984]), and a novelist of some repute, published <em>Heritage</em> (1955), a fictionalized autobiography. West never forgave her son for depicting in <em>Heritage</em> the relationship between an illegitimate son and his two world-famous, unmarried parents, and for portraying the mother in unflattering terms. Essentially, she felt Anthony was airing in public his accusations against her as a bad mother, which stemmed partly from the fact that she had made a fiction of his provenance. She had asked him to call her Auntie, and his father Wellsie, until he was about four or five. He also felt she had made a habit of leaving him in institutions in his early years while she developed her career in the United States. West countered by claiming that she spent as much time with him as any child could reasonably hope to spend with a mother who was a professional. She was exasperated at his focus on her parenting, when he did not accuse his father of abandonment, even though Wells had been even more absent during Anthony's youth. Anthony, in fact, idolized Wells. The depiction of West's alter ego in <em>Heritage</em> as a deceitful, unloving actress (West had trained as an actress in her youth) and poor caregiver so wounded West that she broke off relations with her son and threatened to sue any publisher who would bring out <em>Heritage</em> in England. She successfully suppressed an English edition of the novel, which was only published there after her death, in 1984. Although there were temporary rapprochements between her and Anthony, a state of alienation persisted between them, causing West grief until her dying hour. She fretted about her son's absence from her deathbed, but when asked whether he should be sent for, answered, &quot;perhaps not, if he hates me so much&quot;.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="death">Death</h3>
<p>West suffered from failing eyesight and high blood pressure in the late 1970s, and she became increasingly frail. Her last months were mostly spent in bed, sometimes delirious, sometimes lucid, and she complained that she was dying too slowly.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> She died on 15 March 1983 and is buried at <a href="Brookwood_Cemetery" title="wikilink">Brookwood Cemetery</a>, <a href="Woking" class="uri" title="wikilink">Woking</a>.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<p>On hearing of her death, <a href="William_Shawn" title="wikilink">William Shawn</a>, then editor in chief of <em>The New Yorker</em>, said: '''</p>
<h2 id="politics">Politics</h2>
<p>West grew up in a home filled with discussions of world affairs. Her father was a journalist who often involved himself in controversial issues. He brought home <a href="Russia" title="wikilink">Russian</a> revolutionaries and other political activists, and their debates helped to form West's sensibility, which took shape in novels such as <em>The Birds Fall Down</em>, set in pre-revolution Russia.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> But the crucial event that molded West's politics was the <a href="Dreyfus_Affair" title="wikilink">Dreyfus Affair</a>.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> The impressionable Rebecca learned early on just how powerful was the will to persecute minorities and to subject individuals to unreasonable suspicion based on flimsy evidence and mass frenzy.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> West had a keen understanding of the psychology of politics, how movements and causes could sustain themselves on the profound need to believe or disbelieve in a core of values&lt;U+2014&gt;even when that core contradicted reality.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
<p>It would seem that her father's ironic, sceptical temper so penetrated her sensibility that she could not regard any body of ideas as other than a starting point for argument. Although she was a militant feminist and active suffragette, and published a perceptive and admiring profile of <a href="Emmeline_Pankhurst" title="wikilink">Emmeline Pankhurst</a>, West also criticized the tactics of Pankhurst's daughter, Christabel, and the sometimes doctrinaire aspects of the Pankhursts' <a href="Women&#39;s_Social_and_Political_Union" title="wikilink">Women's Social and Political Union</a> (WSPU).<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a></p>
<p>The first major test of West's political outlook was the <a href="October_Revolution" title="wikilink">Bolshevik Revolution</a>. Many on the left saw it as the beginning of a new, better world, and the end of the crimes of <a href="capitalism" class="uri" title="wikilink">capitalism</a>. West regarded herself as a member of the left, having attending <a href="Fabian_Society" title="wikilink">Fabian socialist</a> summer schools as a girl. But to West, both the Revolution and the revolutionaries were suspect. Even before the <a href="Bolsheviks" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bolsheviks</a> took power in October 1917, West expressed her doubts that events in Russia could serve as a model for socialists in Britain or anywhere else.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>
<p>West paid a heavy price for her cool reaction to the Russian Revolution; her positions increasingly isolated her. When <a href="Emma_Goldman" title="wikilink">Emma Goldman</a> visited Britain in 1924 after seeing Bolshevik violence firsthand, West was exasperated that British intellectuals ignored Goldman's testimony and her warning against Bolshevik tyranny.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a></p>
<p>For all her censures of <a href="Communism" class="uri" title="wikilink">Communism</a>, however, West was hardly an uncritical supporter of the Western democracies. Thus in 1919-1920, she excoriated the U.S. government for deporting Goldman and for the infamous <a href="Palmer_raids" title="wikilink">Palmer raids</a>. She was also appalled at the failure of Western democracies to come to the aid of <a href="Republican_Spain" title="wikilink">Republican Spain</a>, and she gave money to the Republican cause.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a></p>
<p>A staunch <a href="anti-Fascist" class="uri" title="wikilink">anti-Fascist</a>, West attacked both the Conservative governments of her own country for appeasing <a href="Adolf_Hitler" title="wikilink">Adolf Hitler</a> and her colleagues on the left for their <a href="pacifism" class="uri" title="wikilink">pacifism</a>. Neither side, in her view, understood the evil Nazism posed. Unlike many on the left, she also distrusted <a href="Joseph_Stalin" title="wikilink">Joseph Stalin</a>. To West, Stalin had a criminal mentality that Communism facilitated.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> She was outraged when the Allies decided to back the Communist-led <a href="Yugoslav_Partisans" title="wikilink">Partisans</a> led by <a href="Josip_Broz_Tito" title="wikilink">Tito</a> in Yugoslavia, instead of the <a href="Chetniks" class="uri" title="wikilink">Chetniks</a> of <a href="Dra&lt;U+017E&gt;a_Mihailovi&lt;U+0107&gt;" title="wikilink">Dra&lt;U+017E&gt;a Mihailovi&lt;U+0107&gt;</a>, whom she considered the legitimate Yugoslav resistance.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> After the war, West's anti-Communism hardened as she saw <a href="Poland" class="uri" title="wikilink">Poland</a>, <a href="Czechoslovakia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Czechoslovakia</a>, <a href="Hungary" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hungary</a>, and other Eastern and Central European states succumb to Soviet domination.</p>
<p>It is not surprising in the context that West reacted to <a href="United_States_Senate" title="wikilink">U.S. Senator</a> <a href="Joseph_McCarthy" title="wikilink">Joseph McCarthy</a> differently from her colleagues. They saw a demagogue terrorizing liberals and leftists with baseless accusations of Communist conspiracy. West saw an oaf blundering into the minefield of Communist subversion. For her, McCarthy was right to pursue Communists with fervor, even if his methods were roughshod, though her mild reaction to McCarthy provoked powerful revulsion among those on the left and dismay even among anti-Communist liberals. She refused, however, to amend her views.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a></p>
<p>Although West's anti-Communism earned the high regard of conservatives, she never considered herself one of them. In postwar Britain, West voted <a href="Labour_Party_(UK)" title="wikilink">Labour</a> and welcomed the Labour landslide of 1945. But she spoke out against domination of the Labour Party by British trade unions, and thought leftwing politicians such as <a href="Michael_Foot" title="wikilink">Michael Foot</a> unimpressive. She had mixed feelings about the <a href="James_Callaghan" title="wikilink">Callaghan</a> government. West admired <a href="Margaret_Thatcher" title="wikilink">Margaret Thatcher</a>, not for Thatcher's policies, but for Thatcher's achievement in rising to the top of a male-dominated sphere.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> She admired Thatcher's willingness to stand up to trade-union bullying.</p>
<p>In the end, West's anti-Communism remained the centerpiece of her politics because she so consistently challenged the Communists as legitimate foes of the status quo in capitalist countries. In West's view, Communism, like fascism, was merely a form of authoritarianism. Communists were under party discipline and therefore could never speak for themselves. And West was a supreme example of an intellectual who spoke for herself, no matter how her comments might injure her. Indeed, few writers explicitly acknowledged how much West's embrace of unpopular positions hurt her on the left. A whole generation of writers abandoned West and refused to read her, as <a href="Doris_Lessing" title="wikilink">Doris Lessing</a> suggested.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="religion">Religion</h2>
<p>West considered herself a <a href="Christianity" title="wikilink">Christian</a> but she was an unconventional believer. At times, she found God to be wicked; at other times she considered Him merely ineffectual and defeated.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> However, she revered Christ as the quintessentially good man,<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> she had great respect for the literary, pictorial, and architectural manifestations of the Christian ethos, and she considered faith a valid tool to grapple with the conundrums of life and the mysteries of the cosmos.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> Although her writings are full of references to the Bible and ecclesiastical history, she was essentially anti-doctrinaire and occasionally blasphemous. In 1926 she expressed the unorthodox belief that &quot;Christianity must be regarded not as a final revelation but as a phase of revelation.&quot;<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> Moreover, she rejected specific articles of belief such as the <a href="Virgin_birth_of_Jesus" title="wikilink">virgin birth</a>, <a href="Original_sin" title="wikilink">Original sin</a>, the <a href="Atonement_in_Christianity" title="wikilink">Atonement</a>, and <a href="Divine_Providence" title="wikilink">Providence</a>. Her contribution to <a href="Virginia_Woolf" title="wikilink">Virginia Woolf</a>'s Hogarth Letters Series, <em>Letter to a Grandfather</em> (1933), is a declaration of &quot;my faith, which seems to some unfaith&quot;<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> disguised as philosophical fiction. Written in the midst of the Great Depression, <em>Letter to a Grandfather</em> traces the progressive degeneration of the notion of Providence through the ages, concluding skeptically that &quot;the redemptive power of divine grace no longer seemed credible, nor very respectable in the arbitrary performance that was claimed for it.&quot;<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> As for the Atonement, <em>Black Lamb and Grey Falcon</em> is in part meant as a refutation of that very doctrine, which she saw as having sparked a fatal obsession with sacrifice throughout the Christian era and, specifically, as having prompted <a href="Neville_Chamberlain" title="wikilink">Neville Chamberlain</a> to formulate his policy of <a href="appeasement" class="uri" title="wikilink">appeasement</a>, which she vehemently opposed. She wrote &quot;All our Western thought is founded on this repulsive pretence that pain is the proper price of any good thing... [Augustine] developed a theory of the Atonement which was pure nonsense, yet had the power to convince... This monstrous theory supposes that God was angry with man for his sins and that He wanted to punish him for these, not in any way that might lead to his reformation, but simply by inflicting pain on him; and that He allowed Christ to suffer this pain instead of man and thereafter was willing on certain terms to treat man as if he had not committed these sins. This theory flouts reason at all points, for it is not possible that a just God should forgive people who are wicked because another person who was good endured agony by being nailed to a cross.&quot;<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a></p>
<p>World War II shocked her into a more conventional belief: &quot;I believe if people are looking for the truth, the truth of the Christian religion will come out and meet them.&quot;<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> And in the early 1950s, she thought she had a mystical revelation in France and actively tried to convert to <a href="Roman_Catholic_Church" title="wikilink">Catholicism</a>.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> There was a precedent in her family for this action, as her sister, Letitia, had earlier converted to Catholicism, thereby causing quite a stir. But West's attempt was short-lived, and she confessed to a friend: &quot;I could not go on with being a Catholic... I don't want, I can't bear to, become a <a href="Graham_Greene" title="wikilink">Graham Greene</a> and <a href="Evelyn_Waugh" title="wikilink">Evelyn Waugh</a>, and I cannot believe that I am required to pay such a price for salvation.&quot;<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> Her writings of the 1960s and early 70s again betray a profound mistrust towards God: &quot;The case against religion is the responsibility of God for the sufferings of mankind, which makes it impossible to believe the good things said about Him in the Bible, and consequently to believe anything it says about Him.&quot;<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a></p>
<p>West's fluctuating attitude towards Christianity was offset by a more constant form of belief. She was informally a <a href="Manichaeism" title="wikilink">Manichaean</a> all her life.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> Although she was critical of Manichaeanism's puritanical excesses,<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> she did believe in dualism as the most fundamental working principle of the universe.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> Although she conceded, optimistically, that &quot;it is not possible to kill goodness,&quot;<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> she also indulged in pessimistic statements like &quot;natural man is mean,&quot;<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> which is as much as saying that she adhered to the Manichaean belief that the essence of goodness was diffused inside gross matter like particles of light trapped in darkness. In accordance with this Manichaean skepticism, West wrote in a draft of her own memoirs: &quot;I had almost no possibility of holding faith of any religious kind except a belief in a wholly and finally defeated God, a hypothesis which I now accept but tried for a long time to reject, I could not face it.&quot;<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a></p>
<p>Manichaean was also her life-long struggle with the very question of how to deal with dualisms. At times she appears to favor the merging of opposites, for which <a href="Byzantium" class="uri" title="wikilink">Byzantium</a> served as a model: &quot;church and state, love and violence, life and death, were to be fused again as in Byzantium.&quot;<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a> More dominant, however, was her tendency to view the tensions generated in the space between dualistic terms as life-sustaining and creative; hence, her aversion to <a href="homosexuality" class="uri" title="wikilink">homosexuality</a> and her warning not to confuse the drive for feminist emancipation with the woman's desire to become like a man. Her insistence on the fundamental difference between men and women reveals her essentialism,<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> but it also bespeaks her innate Manichaean sensibility. She wanted respect and equal rights for women, but at the same time she required that women retain their specifically feminine qualities, notably an affinity with the life force: &quot;Men have a disposition to violence; women have not. If one says that men are on the side of death, women on the side of life, one seems to be making an accusation against men. One is not doing that.&quot;<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a> One reason why she does not want to make an accusation against men is that they are simply playing their assigned role in a flawed universe, which is, of course, the result of an imperfect deity. Only love can alleviate destructive aspects of the sex-antagonism: &quot;I loathe the way the two cancers of sadism and masochism eat into the sexual life of humanity, so that the one lifts the lash and the other offers blood to the blow, and both are drunken with the beastly pleasure of misery and do not proceed with love's business of building a shelter from the cruelty of the universe.&quot;<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a> In addition to the operations of love, female emancipation is crucial to removing the moral, professional, and social stigma associated with the notion of the &quot;weaker sex,&quot; without trying to do away altogether with the temperamental and metaphysical aspects of the gender dualism itself. Thus, the &quot;sex war&quot; so graphically rendered in West's early short story &quot;Indissoluble Matrimony&quot; (1914) elevates the female character, Evadne, in the end because she accepts the terms of the contest without superficially trying to &quot;win&quot; that war.</p>
<p>Manichaeanism also informs West's political propensities. As <a href="Bernard_Schweizer" title="wikilink">Bernard Schweizer</a> has argued: &quot;St. Augustine and Schopenhauer emphasized the fallenness of human life, implying a quietistic stance that could be confused with conservatism, while the <a href="Reclus" class="uri" title="wikilink">Reclus</a> brothers [famous French anarchists] urged her to revolt against such pessimistic determinism. West's characteristically heroic personal and historic vision is a result of these two contending forces.&quot;<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a> West's conviction that humanity will only fulfill its highest potentials if it adheres to the principle of process similarly arises from her Manichaean temperament: &quot;Process is her most encompassing doctrine,&quot; states Peter Wolfe. &quot;Reconciling her dualism, it captures the best aspects of the male and female principles.&quot;<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a> In this way, West's Manichaean disposition infuses her religious sensibility, as well as her thinking about gender, politics, and art.</p>

<li>&quot;Only part of us is sane: only part of us loves pleasure and the longer day of happiness, wants to live to our nineties and die in peace, in a house that we built, that shall shelter those who come after us. The other half of us is nearly mad. It prefers the disagreeable to the agreeable, loves pain and its darker night despair, and wants to die in a catastrophe that will set back life to its beginnings and leave nothing of our house save its blackened foundations.&quot;<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a></li>
<li>&quot;All our Western thought is founded on this repulsive pretence that pain is the proper price of any good thing.&quot;<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a></li>

<li>&quot;Economists are like Aeolian harps, and the sounds that issue from them are determined by the winds that blow.&quot;<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a></li>
<li>&quot;It is the soul's duty to be loyal to its own desires. It must abandon itself to its master passion.&quot;</li>

<li>&quot;In these pages your imaginations, your desires, your passions are given life; Thoughts take shape that turn into dreams and our aspirations all start with a dream. Reading is where those dreams really can come true over and over again.&quot;</li>
