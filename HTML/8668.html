<p>The <strong>2005 Sugar Bowl</strong> was a postseason <a href="American_football" title="wikilink">American</a> <a href="college_football" title="wikilink">college football</a> <a href="bowl_game" title="wikilink">bowl game</a> between the <a href="2004_Virginia_Tech_Hokies_football_team" title="wikilink">Virginia Tech Hokies</a> and the <a href="2004_Auburn_Tigers_football_team" title="wikilink">Auburn Tigers</a> at the <a href="Louisiana_Superdome" title="wikilink">Louisiana Superdome</a> in <a href="New_Orleans,_Louisiana" title="wikilink">New Orleans</a>, <a href="Louisiana" class="uri" title="wikilink">Louisiana</a>, on January 3, 2005. It was the 71st edition of the annual <a href="Sugar_Bowl" title="wikilink">Sugar Bowl</a> football contest. Virginia Tech represented the <a href="Atlantic_Coast_Conference" title="wikilink">Atlantic Coast Conference</a> (ACC) in the contest, while Auburn represented the <a href="Southeastern_Conference" title="wikilink">Southeastern Conference</a> (SEC). In a defensive struggle, Auburn earned a 16–13 victory despite a late-game rally by Virginia Tech.</p>
<p>Virginia Tech was selected as a participant in the game after winning the <a href="List_of_Atlantic_Coast_Conference_football_champions" title="wikilink">ACC football championship</a> during the team's first year in the conference. Tech, which finished 10–2 in the regular season prior to the Sugar Bowl, defeated 16th-ranked Virginia and ninth-ranked Miami en route to the game. Auburn finished the regular season undefeated and 12–0. The Tigers defeated fourth-ranked <a href="LSU_Tigers_football" title="wikilink">LSU</a> and fifth-ranked <a href="Georgia_Bulldogs_football" title="wikilink">Georgia</a> during the course of the season, and were one of three teams to finish the regular season undefeated. The other two undefeated teams, <a href="USC_Trojans_football" title="wikilink">Southern California</a> and <a href="Oklahoma_Sooners_football" title="wikilink">Oklahoma</a>, were selected to play in the <a href="BCS_National_Championship_Game" title="wikilink">Bowl Championship Series national championship game</a>. Auburn, by virtue of its lower ranking in the <a href="Bowl_Championship_Series#Rankings" title="wikilink">BCS poll</a>, was left out of the national championship and was selected to play in the Sugar Bowl.</p>
<p>Pre-game media coverage of the game focused on Auburn being left out of the national championship game, a point of controversy for Auburn fans and other observers in the weeks leading up to the game. Much was made of that fact and the success of Auburn <a href="running_back" title="wikilink">running backs</a> <a href="Carnell_Williams" title="wikilink">Carnell Williams</a> and <a href="Ronnie_Brown" title="wikilink">Ronnie Brown</a>, each of whom were considered among the best at their position. On the Virginia Tech side, senior <a href="quarterback" class="uri" title="wikilink">quarterback</a> <a href="Bryan_Randall" title="wikilink">Bryan Randall</a> had a record-breaking season and was predicted to continue his success in the Sugar Bowl. Both teams also had high-ranked defenses, and Tech's appearance in the <a href="2000_Sugar_Bowl" title="wikilink">2000 Sugar Bowl</a> also was mentioned in the runup to the game.</p>
<p>The 2005 Sugar Bowl <a href="Kickoff_(American_football)" title="wikilink">kicked off</a> on January 3, 2005 at 8:00 p.m. <a href="Eastern_Standard_Time" title="wikilink">EST</a>. Early in the first quarter, the Tigers took an 3–0 lead. Following an <a href="interception" class="uri" title="wikilink">interception</a> by the Auburn defense, the Tigers were able to extend their lead to 6–0. In the second quarter, another <a href="Field_goal_(football)" title="wikilink">field goal</a> resulted in three points for the Tigers. At <a href="halftime" class="uri" title="wikilink">halftime</a>, Auburn led, 9–0. Auburn opened the second half with its first and only <a href="touchdown" class="uri" title="wikilink">touchdown</a> drive of the game, giving Auburn a 16–0 lead, which it held into the fourth quarter. In that quarter, Tech scored its first touchdown of the game but did not convert the <a href="two-point_conversion" title="wikilink">two-point try</a>, making the score 16–6. Late in the quarter, Tech quarterback Bryan Randall cut Auburn's lead to 16–13 on an 80-yard <a href="forward_pass" title="wikilink">pass</a> that resulted in another touchdown. With almost no time remaining in the game, Virginia Tech was forced to attempt an <a href="onside_kick" title="wikilink">onside kick</a> to have another chance on offense. When Auburn recovered the kick, the Tigers were able to <a href="running_out_the_clock" title="wikilink">run out the clock</a> and secure the win. In recognition of his game-winning performance, Auburn quarterback Jason Campbell was named the game's <a href="most_valuable_player" title="wikilink">most valuable player</a>.</p>
<p>Despite Auburn's victory and the Tigers' undefeated season, they were not named national champions. That honor went to the University of Southern California, which defeated Oklahoma in the <a href="2005_Orange_Bowl" title="wikilink">2005 national championship game</a>. Three voters in the final <a href="Associated_Press" title="wikilink">Associated Press</a> poll of the season voted Auburn the number one team in the country, but their votes were not enough to deny USC a national championship, as voted by members of the Associated Press and Coaches' polls. Several players from each team were selected in the <a href="2005_NFL_Draft" title="wikilink">2005 NFL Draft</a> and went on to careers in the <a href="National_Football_League" title="wikilink">National Football League</a>.</p>
<h2 id="team-selection">Team selection</h2>
<p>Virginia Tech and Auburn each earned automatic spots in a BCS bowl game due to their status as conference champions, and were selected by the 2005 Sugar Bowl. Virginia Tech finished the season 10–2 and was named ACC football champion its first year in the conference.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> Auburn, meanwhile, finished the season undefeated at 12–0, and was named champion of the SEC.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> Controversy erupted around Auburn's selection, as the Tigers had been denied a spot in the national championship game in favor of two other undefeated teams: the <a href="USC_Trojans_football" title="wikilink">University of Southern California (USC)</a> and <a href="2005_Oklahoma_Sooners_football_team" title="wikilink">Oklahoma</a>.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>

<p>The Virginia Tech Hokies entered the <a href="2004_NCAA_Division_I-A_football_season" title="wikilink">2004 college football season</a> having gone 8–5 in 2003, culminating with a 52–49 loss to <a href="California_Golden_Bears_football" title="wikilink">California</a> in the <a href="2003_Insight_Bowl" title="wikilink">2003 Insight Bowl</a>.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> The 2003 season had also been Virginia Tech's final year in the <a href="Big_East_Conference" title="wikilink">Big East Conference</a>, and Tech began the new season in the Atlantic Coast Conference.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> Tech started the season unranked for the first time since 1998, and was picked to finish sixth (out of 11 ACC teams) in the annual ACC preseason poll, held in July.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> The Hokies' first game in their new conference was a non-conference contest in <a href="Washington,_D.C." title="wikilink">Washington, D.C.</a> against the top-ranked USC Trojans.

<p>Following the loss, Virginia Tech was 2–2 on the season, and faced the potential of being <a href="Bowl_eligible" title="wikilink">ineligible for a postseason bowl game</a> if it did not improve its winning percentage. Those fears were for naught as the Hokies won their next eight games, finishing the season with a 10–2 record.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> With late-season wins over perennial rival, 16th-ranked Virginia,<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> and fellow ACC newcomer, ninth-ranked Miami,<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> Virginia Tech clinched the ACC football championship (the last year in which it would be decided without a <a href="ACC_Championship_Game" title="wikilink">conference championship game</a>) and a bid to a <a href="Bowl_Championship_Series" title="wikilink">Bowl Championship Series</a> game.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> Because the ACC's normal bowl destination, the Orange Bowl, was hosting the national championship game, Virginia Tech was selected to attend the Sugar Bowl in New Orleans, Louisiana, instead.</p>

The Tigers were using a new offensive scheme&lt;U+2014&gt;the <a href="West_Coast_offense" title="wikilink">West Coast offense</a>&lt;U+2014&gt;and boasted two highly rated running backs on offense.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> In its first game of the 2004 season, the 18th-ranked Auburn football team overwhelmed the <a href="University_of_Louisiana-Monroe" title="wikilink">University of Louisiana-Monroe</a>, 31–0. It was Auburn's first shutout since 2002.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> One week later, the Tigers backed up their good start with an emphatic 43–14 victory over <a href="Southeastern_Conference" title="wikilink">Southeastern Conference</a> foe <a href="Mississippi_State_University" title="wikilink">Mississippi State University</a>.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> In the third week of the season, Auburn faced its first challenge of the young season, against the fourth-ranked <a href="LSU_Tigers_football" title="wikilink">Louisiana State Tigers</a>.

<h2 id="pre-game-buildup">Pre-game buildup</h2>
<p>In the weeks leading up to the game, media coverage of the game focused on Auburn's exclusion from the national championship game, a controversial point for Auburn fans and other observers in the weeks leading up to the game. In addition, both teams boasted high-ranked defenses that had performed well during the year. Much was made of that fact and the success of Auburn running backs Carnell Williams and Ronnie Brown, each of whom were considered among the best players at their position. On the Virginia Tech side, senior quarterback Bryan Randall performed well for the Hokies during the regular season and was predicted to continue his success in the Sugar Bowl.</p>
<h3 id="rankings-controversy">Rankings controversy</h3>
<p>Shortly after the final pre-<a href="bowl_game" title="wikilink">bowl game</a> Bowl Championship Series standings were released on December 4, Auburn was among several teams disgruntled with the system. One of these was <a href="California_Golden_Bears_football" title="wikilink">California</a>, which only lost to top-ranked USC, but was denied a bid to the prestigious <a href="Rose_Bowl_(game)" title="wikilink">Rose Bowl</a> after <a href="2004_Texas_Longhorns_football_team" title="wikilink">Texas</a> vaulted it in the rankings despite having the same record. The Golden Bears were forced to attend the less-attractive <a href="Holiday_Bowl" title="wikilink">Holiday Bowl</a> instead.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> The Auburn Tigers, meanwhile, had completed their first 12-win regular season and won their first conference championship in 15 years, but in the final BCS rankings, Auburn was third, behind USC and Oklahoma.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> It was the first time since the creation of the BCS in 1998 that three major-conference college football teams were undefeated at the conclusion of the regular season.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> Some pundits and fans considered Auburn's failure to reach the championship game to be based on the fact that the Tigers had started with a lower ranking at the beginning of the season. The Tigers had been ranked 17th at the beginning of the season, while USC had been ranked first and Oklahoma second, the same spots they occupied at the end of the regular season.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a><a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a><a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a></p>
<p>Sportswriters also pointed to the Tigers' tougher conference schedule when compared to those of USC and Oklahoma. SEC commissioner Mike Slive remarked, &quot;If Auburn goes through this league undefeated, they deserve to play for the national championship.&quot;<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> Virginia Tech head coach Frank Beamer, in the runup to the game, seemingly agreed with the assessment, saying, &quot;We started out playing Southern Cal and I believe this Auburn team is better.&quot;<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> Some writers also indicated USC's five-point win&lt;U+2014&gt;in which the Trojans struggled&lt;U+2014&gt;over rival <a href="UCLA_Bruins_football" title="wikilink">UCLA</a> as an indicator that the Tigers could be the better team.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> In the end, such arguments were unable to sway voters, who ranked USC first, Oklahoma second, and Auburn third in all of the major polls decided by human voters.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> The <a href="Utah_Utes_football" title="wikilink">Utah Utes</a>, who were also undefeated at the conclusion of the regular season, received limited attention due to the fact that they were a member of a non-BCS conference.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a></p>
<p>Due to the controversy surrounding Auburn's failure to be given a chance to play for the national championship and controversies involving teams lobbying for improved ratings in the poll, the Associated Press sent a cease-and-desist order to BCS officials, forbidding them the use of the AP Poll in calculating BCS ratings.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="auburn-offense">Auburn offense</h3>

<p>Auburn head coach <a href="Tommy_Tuberville" title="wikilink">Tommy Tuberville</a> was named the Associated Press Coach of the Year on December 24, due in large part to his success in using Auburn's new West Coast offense to drive the Tigers to an undefeated 12–0 regular season.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> In response to his success, Auburn administrators agreed to a seven-year, $16 million contract extension with Tuberville prior to the Sugar Bowl.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> Tuberville planned an offense that finished the regular season averaging 33.4 points and 430.8 yards of <a href="total_offense" title="wikilink">total offense</a> per game.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a></p>
<p>Heading Auburn's offense on the field was quarterback Jason Campbell. Campbell finished the regular season with 2,511 yards and 19 touchdowns, one short of tying the Auburn record for most touchdowns in a single season. Campbell was second in the Southeastern Conference in <a href="forward_pass" title="wikilink">passing yards</a> per game (209.2), and was a first-team All-SEC selection.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a></p>
<p>Auburn's <a href="Rush_(American_football)" title="wikilink">rushing offense</a> was led by two highly regarded running backs: <a href="Carnell_Williams" title="wikilink">Carnell Williams</a> and <a href="Ronnie_Brown" title="wikilink">Ronnie Brown</a>. The two men, combined with quarterback Campbell, ran for 15,739 yards and 129 career touchdowns prior to the Sugar Bowl.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> Williams led the SEC in all-purpose yardage (137.2 yards per game) and average yards per <a href="punt_return" title="wikilink">punt return</a> (11.7). He finished the regular season with 1,104 rushing yards and 13 touchdowns. The touchdown mark was the most recorded by a running back in the SEC that year.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> For his accomplishments, Williams was named a first-team All-SEC pick. Despite missing most of his first two seasons due to injuries, he ranked second on Auburn's all-time rushing list with 3,770 yards&lt;U+2014&gt;behind only <a href="National_Football_League" title="wikilink">NFL</a> and <a href="Major_League_Baseball" title="wikilink">MLB</a> star <a href="Bo_Jackson" title="wikilink">Bo Jackson</a>. Williams also had the most rushing touchdowns in Auburn history (45) and was Auburn's leading scorer in school history (276 points).<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a> Brown accumulated 845 rushing yards and caught 34 passes for 314 yards during the season prior to the Sugar Bowl. He finished with eight touchdowns and was named a second-team All-SEC pick.<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> His 34 receptions were 10 more than he earned in his first three seasons combined.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a></p>
<p>Despite the attention focused on Auburn's two star running backs, the team also boasted a capable corps of <a href="wide_receiver" title="wikilink">wide receivers</a> as well. Prior to the game, Auburn receiver Ben Obomanu said, &quot;When you have your running game making big plays and the defense has to load the box (<a href="defensive_line" title="wikilink">defensive line</a>) to make plays and try to stop the running game, that opens up things in the passing game.&quot; Auburn averaged more yards passing (241.4 per game) than running (189.4 per game).<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="virginia-tech-offense">Virginia Tech offense</h3>
<p>Heading into the Sugar Bowl, the Virginia Tech offense was led by quarterback <a href="Bryan_Randall" title="wikilink">Bryan Randall</a>, who completed 149 of 268 passes (55.6 percent) for 1,965 yards, 19 touchdowns, and seven interceptions. He also rushed for 466 yards and held Tech career records for total offense and passing yards. His 37 consecutive <a href="starting_lineup" title="wikilink">starts</a> also are a school mark for a quarterback.<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a> In the preseason, Randall competed for the first-string quarterback spot with Marcus Vick until the latter was suspended from Tech for a semester after a criminal conviction.<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a> In the weeks leading up to the Sugar Bowl, Randall was named the Virginia Division I Offensive Player of the Year by the <em><a href="Roanoke_Times" title="wikilink">Roanoke Times</a></em><a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a> and was named the ACC Player of the Year.<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a></p>
<p>Tech's rushing offense featured two running backs who shared time on the field: <a href="Mike_Imoh" title="wikilink">Mike Imoh</a> and <a href="Cedric_Humes" title="wikilink">Cedric Humes</a>. During the regular season, Imoh rushed the ball 152 times for 704 yards, an average of 4.6 yards per carry. He scored four touchdowns and set a school record for rushing yards in a game when he ran for 243 yards in Virginia Tech's game against North Carolina.<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a> Humes was on the field slightly less than Imoh, but earned 595 yards and five touchdowns on 124 carries.<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a> Tech <a href="offensive_tackle" title="wikilink">offensive tackle</a> <a href="Jimmy_Martin" title="wikilink">Jimmy Martin</a> was expected to play in the game after recovering from a high ankle sprain.<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a></p>
<p>On special teams, Tech's Jim Davis blocked three field goals during the regular season, and teammate <a href="Darryl_Tapp" title="wikilink">Darryl Tapp</a> blocked a punt.<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a> Tech's success on special teams was at least partially due to head coach Frank Beamer's emphasis on that aspect of the game, a strategy known as &quot;<a href="Frank_Beamer#Beamerball" title="wikilink">Beamerball</a>.&quot; Due to Tech's acumen on special teams, Auburn was forced to spend extra time in preparing its special teams to face Virginia Tech in the Sugar Bowl.<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a></p>
<p>The Sugar Bowl was a homecoming for Tech punter Vinnie Burns, who played high school football  from the Louisiana Superdome, site of the Sugar Bowl. In addition, Burns' father, Ronnie Burns, was a longtime Sugar Bowl committee member, and Vinnie committed to attend Virginia Tech while the Hokies were in New Orleans to play in the 2000 Sugar Bowl, that year's national championship game.<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a></p>

<h3 id="first-quarter">First quarter</h3>
<p>Following the ceremonial pre-game coin toss, Auburn elected to kick off to Virginia Tech to begin the game, ensuring the Tigers would have possession to begin the second half. Tech began the first drive of the game from its 20-yard line following a <a href="touchback" class="uri" title="wikilink">touchback</a>. The Hokies initially had success moving the ball, as quarterback Bryan Randall rushed for seven yards on the game's first play, then completed a four-yard pass to wide receiver Eddie Royal two plays later for a first down. The Auburn defense recovered, however, and the Hokies did not gain another first down and were forced to <a href="Punt_(football)" title="wikilink">punt</a>. Auburn recovered the ball and began its first drive of the game from its 26-yard line. On the Tigers' first play, quarterback Jason Campbell threw a long pass to Cooper Wallace for 35 yards. This was followed by another long play as running back Ronnie Brown ran for 31 yards. After the initial shock of the Auburn offense, the Virginia Tech defense firmed up, and Auburn's next three plays were stopped for losses or minimal gains. Facing a fourth down at the Virginia Tech six-yard line, Auburn sent in kicker John Vaughn, who kicked a 23-yard <a href="field_goal" title="wikilink">field goal</a> for the game's first points. With 8:35 remaining in the first quarter, Auburn took an early 3–0 lead.<a href="#fn90" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref90"><sup>90</sup></a></p>
<p>Following the post-field goal kickoff, the Virginia Tech offense attempted to answer Auburn's quick score. Unfortunately for the Hokies, their second drive fared even worse than the first. Tech committed a 10-yard penalty, suffered an eight-yard loss on a play, then had a Bryan Randall pass <a href="interception" title="wikilink">intercepted</a> by Auburn <a href="Safety_(American_football)" title="wikilink">safety</a> Junior Rosegreen. Rosegreen returned the ball 31 yards, and put Auburn's offense into good field position for its second drive of the game. Auburn also suffered an early penalty in its drive, but moved the ball with another long play&lt;U+2014&gt;a 23-yard pass to Courtney Taylor&lt;U+2014&gt;to recover. Again, however, the Virginia Tech defense recovered to force Auburn into a fourth down and a field goal attempt. Vaughn returned to the field and kicked a 19-yard field goal, giving Auburn a 6–0 lead with 1:06 remaining in the quarter.<a href="#fn91" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref91"><sup>91</sup></a></p>
<p>With time in the quarter running out, Virginia Tech fielded the post-score kickoff and executed a quick series of plays, gaining a first down before time ran out. At the end of the first quarter, Auburn held an early 6–0 lead.<a href="#fn92" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref92"><sup>92</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="second-quarter">Second quarter</h3>
<p>Virginia Tech began the second quarter in possession of the ball and driving down the field. Bryan Randall completed a 10-yard pass for another first down, but after Tech failed to gain another, the Hokies were forced to punt. Auburn reciprocated by going <a href="three_and_out" title="wikilink">three and out</a> and punting the ball back to Virginia Tech. In its first full drive of the second quarter, the Hokies had their best drive of the first half. After a holding penalty nullified a long <a href="kickoff_return" title="wikilink">kickoff return</a>, Tech began at its 24-yard line. Randall completed a nine-yard pass to tight end Jeff King, then ran for another nine yards on a quarterback scramble. He followed the first-down run by completing three consecutive long passes of 16 yards, 13 yards, and 31 yards, respectively. The last pass, to wide receiver Josh Hyman, drove Virginia Tech inside the Auburn two-yard line. There, however, the Tech offense faltered. On three plays, Tech failed to cross the <a href="Goal_line_(American_football)" title="wikilink">goal line</a>, gaining only one yard in the process. Facing fourth down and needing just one yard for a touchdown, Virginia Tech head coach <a href="Frank_Beamer" title="wikilink">Frank Beamer</a> elected to attempt to gain the touchdown, rather than send in his kicker for a field goal attempt. The attempted touchdown pass by Randall fell <a href="incomplete_pass" title="wikilink">incomplete</a>, and Virginia Tech <a href="Glossary_of_American_football#T" title="wikilink">turned the ball over on downs</a> without scoring any points.<a href="#fn93" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref93"><sup>93</sup></a></p>
<p>Auburn's offense took over at its one-yard line after Tech's failure to score. Jason Campbell orchestrated a successful drive that took Auburn from the shadow of its own <a href="end_zone" title="wikilink">end zone</a>, completing passes of 16 yards, 15 yards, and 37 yards in the process. Inside the Virginia Tech <a href="red_zone" title="wikilink">red zone</a>, however, the Auburn offense again stumbled. As it had in its two previous scoring drives, Auburn was forced to send in kicker John Vaughn despite being inside the Virginia Tech 10-yard line. Vaughn's 24-yard kick was successful, and with 1:50 remaining in the second quarter, Auburn extended its lead to 9–0.<a href="#fn94" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref94"><sup>94</sup></a></p>
<p>With little time remaining before <a href="halftime" class="uri" title="wikilink">halftime</a>, Virginia Tech used a <a href="hurry-up_offense" title="wikilink">hurry-up offense</a>. Randall completed a 23-yard pass to Eddie Royal and ran for 22 yards on his own, but threw three consecutive incomplete passes to end the drive. Tech was forced to punt the ball away, and the first half came to an end. At halftime, Auburn led, 9–0.<a href="#fn95" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref95"><sup>95</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="halftime">Halftime</h3>
<p>The halftime show was presented by Bowl Games of America, a collection of <a href="Contemporary_dance" title="wikilink">dance troupes</a>, <a href="marching_band" title="wikilink">marching bands</a>, and <a href="cheerleader" title="wikilink">cheerleading squads</a> from across the United States.

<h3 id="third-quarter">Third quarter</h3>
<p>Because Virginia Tech received the ball to begin the game, Auburn received the ball to begin the second half. The Tigers started the first drive of the second half at their 22-yard line. Carnell Williams and Ronnie Brown alternated carries as Auburn gained 17 yards in their first three plays. Jason Campbell completed a pass for a five-yard loss, then, on the fifth play of the drive, completed a 53-yard pass to Anthony Mix. The pass was the longest play of the game, and drove the Tigers inside the Virginia Tech <a href="red_zone" title="wikilink">red zone</a>. Three plays later, Campbell connected with <a href="Devin_Aromashodu" title="wikilink">Devin Aromashodu</a> on a five-yard pass for the game's first touchdown. With 10:39 remaining in the third quarter, Auburn had taken a 16–0 lead.<a href="#fn97" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref97"><sup>97</sup></a></p>
<p>After Auburn's kickoff, Virginia Tech started its first drive of the second half at its 20-yard line. Down by 16 points, Tech needed to score. The Hokies gained a quick first down, but a five-yard penalty and a sack of Bryan Randall prevented Tech from gaining another. The Hokies were forced to punt, and Auburn took over at its 44-yard line. Despite having good field position, the Tigers went three and out. Following the punt, Virginia Tech reciprocated by also going three and out. With 3:47 remaining in the quarter, Auburn began an offensive drive from its 35-yard line. From the beginning of the drive, however, the Tigers had problems. The first play of Auburn's drive was a 10-yard penalty against the Tigers. The second resulted in a one-yard loss by Ronnie Brown, who attempted to rush through the middle of the <a href="defensive_line" title="wikilink">defensive line</a>. On the third play, Virginia Tech cornerback Jimmy Williams intercepted an errant pass by Jason Campbell. Though Williams was unable to advance the ball, the Hokies still took over on offense, and with 2:38 remaining in the quarter, had their best field position since the first half.<a href="#fn98" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref98"><sup>98</sup></a></p>
<p>The first play of the Tech drive resulted in a 12-yard gain as Josh Hyman rushed for 12 yards and a first down on an <a href="end-around" class="uri" title="wikilink">end-around</a>. Running back Cedric Humes was stopped for a loss on the first play after Hyman's rush, but earned 10 yards on two subsequent rushes, setting up a fourth down. Needing one yard for a first down, behind by 16 points, and with time running down in the quarter, Tech head coach Frank Beamer elected to attempt the first down play rather than kick a field goal. Humes again rushed the ball, and as time ran out in the third quarter, picked up enough ground for the first down. With one quarter of play remaining, Auburn led Virginia Tech 16–0, but the Hokies had picked up a first down inside the Auburn 10-yard line to begin the fourth quarter.<a href="#fn99" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref99"><sup>99</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="fourth-quarter">Fourth quarter</h3>
<p>Virginia Tech began the fourth quarter in possession of the ball, and facing a first down at the Auburn 10-yard line. In three consecutive plays, however, the Hokies only picked up a total of four yards. Needing six yards to get a touchdown, Virginia Tech sent in kicker Brandon Pace to attempt a 23-yard field goal. Despite the short distance, Pace missed the kick. With 13:56 remaining in the game, Auburn still held a 16–0 lead.<a href="#fn100" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref100"><sup>100</sup></a></p>
<p>Following the missed field goal, Auburn took over on offense at its six-yard line&lt;U+2014&gt;the point from which Tech had missed the kick. Ronnie Brown picked up 13 yards and a first down on three rushes. Carnell Williams then picked up three yards, and Jason Campbell threw a seven-yard pass that gave Auburn another first down. A five-yard penalty against Virginia Tech pushed Auburn's offense near midfield, and Ronnie Brown returned to the field, rushing the ball four consecutive times for 16 yards and driving the Tigers into Virginia Tech territory. Facing a fourth down and one yard, Auburn elected to give the ball to Brown again. On the one-yard run, however, Brown <a href="fumble" title="wikilink">fumbled</a> the ball, which was recovered by Virginia Tech's Mikal Baagee with 8:38 remaining.<a href="#fn101" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref101"><sup>101</sup></a></p>
<p>Virginia Tech's offense came on to the field desperately needing to score quickly. Though the deficit was only 16 points, and could be made up with two touchdowns and two two-point conversions, the limited time remaining meant the task would be difficult, even if Virginia Tech scored quickly. The Hokies began the drive with a 17-yard pass by quarterback Bryan Randall. Justin Hamilton rushed for five yards, and Randall completed a six-yard pass for another first down. The Tigers helped matters by committing a 15-yard penalty, which put the Hokies inside Auburn territory. Three plays later, Randall capitalized on the opportunity by completing a 29-yard pass to Josh Morgan for a touchdown and the Hokies' first points of the game. Tech attempted a two-point conversion, but the pass attempt fell incomplete. With 6:57 remaining, Virginia Tech now trailed 16–6.<a href="#fn102" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref102"><sup>102</sup></a></p>
<p>After receiving the post-touchdown kickoff, Auburn began to <a href="running_out_the_clock" title="wikilink">run out the clock</a>. The Tigers failed to pick up a first down, and after going three and out, punted the ball back to Virginia Tech. The Hokies started their drive at their two-yard line, and Randall began it successfully by completing a 20-yard pass, rushing for 10 yards, then completing a five-yard pass to bring the Hokies near midfield. On the fourth play of the drive, however, Randall was intercepted by Auburn's Derrick Graves. The Tigers, their offense again on the field, began running out the clock again. Tech attempted to interrupt Auburn's clock management by calling timeouts after each play, stopping the clock with each timeout. Virginia Tech forced Auburn into a three and out, and the Tigers again punted the ball away with 2:13 remaining.<a href="#fn103" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref103"><sup>103</sup></a></p>
<p>After the ball rolled into the end zone for a <a href="touchback" class="uri" title="wikilink">touchback</a>, Virginia Tech began its final drive at its 20-yard line. On the first play of the drive, Bryan Randall completed an 80-yard touchdown pass to Josh Morgan. The score plus the <a href="extra_point" title="wikilink">extra point</a> cut Auburn's lead to 16–13. With time in the game almost exhausted, Virginia Tech was forced to attempt an <a href="onside_kick" title="wikilink">onside kick</a> in order to have a chance to get another offensive drive. Because the Hokies had used their final timeouts to stop the clock on Auburn's previous drive, Auburn would be free to run out the game's final minutes. Despite the hopes of Virginia Tech for a last-second miracle, the Auburn Tigers recovered the kick, allowing them to run out the clock and clinch a 16–13 victory.<a href="#fn104" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref104"><sup>104</sup></a></p>

<p>With the win, Auburn finished the season undefeated, with 13 wins and zero losses.<a href="#fn116" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref116"><sup>116</sup></a> Virginia Tech's loss gave it a final record of 10–3.<a href="#fn117" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref117"><sup>117</sup></a></p>
<p>The victory gave Auburn fans hope that if Oklahoma won the <a href="2005_Orange_Bowl" title="wikilink">2005 BCS National Championship Game</a>, a split national championship would result. By contract, the winner of the BCS National Championship Game is voted number one in the USA Today Coaches' Poll. In contrast, the Associated Press poll has no such restriction. Auburn's thin margin of victory over Tech put the prospect of split national title in doubt, though not out of reach.<a href="#fn118" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref118"><sup>118</sup></a> <a href="2004_USC_Trojans_football_team" title="wikilink">USC</a>'s blowout 55–19 victory over <a href="2004_Oklahoma_Sooners_football_team" title="wikilink">Oklahoma</a>,<a href="#fn119" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref119"><sup>119</sup></a> however, made it likely that USC would be the overwhelming choice for first place.
