<p>In 2009, McKeon served as ranking member of the House Committee on Education and Labor. In June, President <a href="Barack_Obama" title="wikilink">Barack Obama</a> nominated Representative <a href="John_M._McHugh" title="wikilink">John M. McHugh</a> of <a href="New_York" title="wikilink">New York</a>, who was the ranking Republican on the Armed Services Committee, as <a href="Secretary_of_the_Army" title="wikilink">Secretary of the Army</a>. On June 9, the House Republican leadership appointed McKeon as the ranking Republican on the Armed Services Committee. Under rules of the <a href="United_States_House_of_Representatives" title="wikilink">House of Representatives</a>, McKeon was required to step down from his position as ranking member of the Education and Labor Committee, though he continues to serve on the committee. McKeon was named chairman of the Committee on Armed Services in January, following the Republican takeover of the House in the November 2010 elections.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>As a member of the House, he has made education and defense issues two of his main priorities. He was greatly involved in the reform of the Student Loan Aid Program, which reduced interest rates but controversially increased federal control over education policy, such as teacher training. He also supports a strong national defense budget. Along with <a href="Dean_Gallo" title="wikilink">Dean Gallo</a> of <a href="New_Jersey" title="wikilink">New Jersey</a>, McKeon introduced the <a href="Religious_Freedom_Restoration_Act" title="wikilink">Religious Freedom Restoration Act</a> on March 11, 1993. McKeon is a member of the <a href="Republican_Study_Committee" title="wikilink">Republican Study Committee</a>.</p>
<h2 id="political-campaigns">Political campaigns</h2>
<p>In 1992, California gained seven additional seats following the census. A &quot;new&quot; 25th District was created in the Santa Clarita and Antelope Valleys in north <a href="Los_Angeles_County" title="wikilink">Los Angeles County</a> and the communities of <a href="Chatsworth,_Los_Angeles,_California" title="wikilink">Chatsworth</a>, <a href="Granada_Hills" title="wikilink">Granada Hills</a>, <a href="Northridge,_Los_Angeles,_California" title="wikilink">Northridge</a>, and <a href="Porter_Ranch" title="wikilink">Porter Ranch</a> in the northwestern <a href="San_Fernando_Valley" title="wikilink">San Fernando Valley</a>. McKeon was thus the first congressman to represent the new district. In the 2002 reapportionment, the San Fernando Valley and portions of the Antelope Valley were removed from the 25th District while <a href="Inyo_County" title="wikilink">Inyo County</a>, <a href="Mono_County" title="wikilink">Mono County</a>, and about half of the land area within <a href="San_Bernardino_County" title="wikilink">San Bernardino County</a> were added. The Los Angeles County portion of the district still includes the cities of Santa Clarita, <a href="Palmdale" class="uri" title="wikilink">Palmdale</a>, and part of the city of <a href="Lancaster,_California" title="wikilink">Lancaster</a>. In 2012, the California Citizens Redistricting Commission drew new lines for the 25th district. The &quot;new&quot; district now only contains those previous held areas of Los Angeles County, adds parts of Porter Ranch and Chatsworth in the San Fernando Valley, and expands into parts of Ventura County, including most of Simi Valley.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>During the 2006 election cycle, McKeon received 60% of the vote in his district, defeating Democrat Robert Rodriguez and Libertarian David Erickson. The district has been considered to be &quot;safe&quot; for the Republican Party because it includes predominantly Republican areas in the Antelope and Santa Clarita Valleys and conservative rural areas of the High Sierras and desert regions of California. Changes in ethnic demographics in the district may make it less a safe Republican district in the future. McKeon handily won reelection with 58% of the vote in 2008, even though Democratic presidential candidate <a href="Barack_Obama" title="wikilink">Barack Obama</a> received more votes than his Republican rival John McCain.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>McKeon&lt;U+2019&gt;s campaigns have received the greatest financial support from the defense industry, especially aerospace companies such as <a href="Lockheed_Martin" title="wikilink">Lockheed Martin</a>, <a href="Northrop_Grumman" title="wikilink">Northrop Grumman</a>, and <a href="Boeing" class="uri" title="wikilink">Boeing</a>.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> Additionally, he is endorsed by the <a href="National_Rifle_Association" title="wikilink">National Rifle Association</a>, the <a href="National_Federation_of_Independent_Business" title="wikilink">National Federation of Independent Business</a>, and the California Pro-Life Council .<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="political-stance">Political Stance</h2>
<p>McKeon serves as the chairman on the Armed Services Committee. He assumed the position in January 2011, following the November 2010 elections. He was previously the ranking member of the committee. California&lt;U+2019&gt;s 25th District holds several military bases, including <a href="Fort_Irwin" title="wikilink">Fort Irwin</a>, <a href="Edwards_Air_Force_Base" title="wikilink">Edwards Air Force Base</a>, <a href="Naval_Air_Weapons_Station_China_Lake" title="wikilink">Naval Air Weapons Station China Lake</a>, and the <a href="Marine_Mountain_Warfare_Training_Center" title="wikilink">Marine Mountain Warfare Training Center</a>.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> Although he has spoken strongly against Obama&lt;U+2019&gt;s budgets and governmental support of the economy and has encouraged reducing spending, McKeon has opposed cutting the military budget, stating that &lt;U+201C&gt;a defense budget in decline portends an America in decline&lt;U+201D&gt;.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<p>McKeon voted in favor of American military intervention in Afghanistan and Iraq, as well as Barack Obama's Afghanistan &quot;surge&quot; strategy, and has voted for increasing money and supplies to troops there. He has gone on record saying that withdrawal from Afghanistan should be conditions-based, and done with full consultation with senior military leadership. In a statement from May 2010, McKeon outlined his personal philosophy on the role of the United States and its military, calling for a return to &lt;U+201C&gt;peace through strength&lt;U+201D&gt; and Reagan-esque policies, including full financial and material support for the military in its current wars, keeping Guantanamo Bay open, and military posturing.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<p>In a speech before the Foreign Policy Initiative research group in 2010, McKeon called for increases in government spending on defense above Obama's budgets.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> He has also called on Congress to &quot;embrace and build on&quot; <a href="Robert_Gates#Fiscal_restraint" title="wikilink">Robert Gates' plan</a> to find $100 billion in savings in the defense budget.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<p>In 2011 McKeon organized a fundraiser for the &quot;Lucky 13&quot; Republican freshmen on the House Armed Services Committee to get contributions from defense contractor political action committees.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<p>McKeon inserted language into the 2012 National Defense Authorization Bill that would grant the <a href="President_of_the_United_States" title="wikilink">President of the United States</a> unprecedented powers to wage war freely against persons abroad.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> Detractors, such as the <a href="American_Civil_Liberties_Union" title="wikilink">American Civil Liberties Union</a> and the <a href="New_York_Times" title="wikilink">New York Times</a>, have claimed that it could lead to &lt;U+201C&gt;unending conflict&lt;U+201D&gt; and an unchecked spread of the war on terrorism. Authorizing force against &lt;U+201C&gt;associated forces&lt;U+201D&gt; to Al Qaeda in the AUMF update have been criticized as so vague that it could unintentionally authorize attacks on Iran, Yemen, the Horn of Africa, and others, including U.S citizens living at home and abroad.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a><a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
<p>McKeon said if forced to choose between tax increases and cuts to the Pentagon budget, he would choose tax increases.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> However he would prefer to cut entitlement spending instead.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a><a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> In 2012, McKeon sought a one-year fix to stave off the defense budget cuts from sequestration, although he had previously voted for the <a href="Budget_Control_Act_of_2011" title="wikilink">Budget Control Act of 2011</a> which included sequestration.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>
<p>McKeon is pro-life, and is endorsed by the California Pro-Life Council.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> He does &lt;U+201C&gt;not support amnesty for those who have entered the country illegally,&lt;U+201D&gt; and believes &lt;U+201C&gt;that our country needs to remain focused on securing our borders and ports of entry&lt;U+201D&gt;.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> The congressman has threatened to derail the 2012 defense authorization bill unless it contained provisions prohibiting military chaplains from officiating at gay marriages and restricting access to the civil court system by persons suspected of terrorism.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="countrywide-financial-loan">Countrywide Financial loan</h2>
<p>In January 2012, it was reported that McKeon received a so-called &quot;VIP&quot; or &quot;Friends of Angelo&quot; loan from troubled mortgage lender <a href="Bank_of_America_Home_Loans" title="wikilink">Countrywide Financial</a>, in which loans were granted at lower interest rates than were available to the public. Former Countrywide CEO <a href="Angelo_Mozilo" title="wikilink">Angelo Mozilo</a> created the program to boost the company's standing with politicians, celebrities and well-connected business figures. The congressman received a $315,000 loan from Countrywide at below-market rates in the late 1990s. A congressional probe identified an internal Countrywide email regarding McKeon's loan that stated: &quot;Per Angelo&lt;U+2014&gt;'take off 1 point, no garbage fees, approve the loan and make it a no doc.'&quot;<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> McKeon and names of other legislators who received similar loans were subsequently referred to the <a href="United_States_House_Committee_on_Oversight_and_Government_Reform" title="wikilink">House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform</a> as part of an ethics investigation into improper gifts. McKeon denied knowing that he was part of Countrywide Financial's special loan program.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a><a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> In a response to a press inquiry about his knowledge of the loan discounts McKeon stated, &quot;If I had known we had got a good deal then I would have gotten all my loans from Countrywide.&quot;<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="spouse">Spouse</h2>
<p>McKeon is married to the former Patricia Kunz; they have six children. They are members of <a href="The_Church_of_Jesus_Christ_of_Latter-day_Saints" title="wikilink">The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints</a>.</p>
<p>Patricia Kunz McKeon has been active in her husband's political campaigns, serving as treasurer and drawing a salary which has been the subject of controversy. According to a study by <a href="Citizens_for_Responsibility_and_Ethics_in_Washington" title="wikilink">Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington</a>, McKeon's campaign committees paid her a total of $263,168 between 2001 and 2006 - the highest such payment in the group of Representatives studied by CREW.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> In the 2005-2006 election cycle she was paid $110,000 to do fundraising and prepare campaign finance reports.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> She has also worked as a lobbyist.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a></p>
