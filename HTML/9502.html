<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>Hirosaki Castle measures 612 meters east-west and 947 meters north-south. Its grounds are divided into six concentric <a href="bailey" title="wikilink">baileys</a>, which were formerly walled and separated by <a href="moat" title="wikilink">moats</a>. It is unusual in that its <a href="Edo_period" title="wikilink">Edo period</a> <a href="donjon" class="uri" title="wikilink">donjon</a> and most of its outline remains intact. Noted historian and author <a href="Ry&lt;U+014D&gt;tar&lt;U+014D&gt;_Shiba" title="wikilink">Shiba Ry&lt;U+014D&gt;tar&lt;U+014D&gt;</a> praised it as one of the &quot;Seven Famous Castles of Japan&quot; in his travel essay series <a href="Ry&lt;U+014D&gt;tar&lt;U+014D&gt;_Shiba#Kaid&lt;U+014D&gt;_wo_Yuku" title="wikilink"><em>Kaid&lt;U+014D&gt; wo Yuku</em></a>.</p>
<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<p>During the late <a href="Sengoku_period" title="wikilink">Sengoku period</a>, former <a href="Nambu_clan" title="wikilink">Nambu retainer</a> <a href="&lt;U+014C&gt;ura_Tamenobu" title="wikilink">&lt;U+014C&gt;ura Tamenobu</a> was awarded <a href="kokudaka" title="wikilink">revenues</a> of 45,000 <em>koku</em> by <a href="Toyotomi_Hideyoshi" title="wikilink">Toyotomi Hideyoshi</a> for his role in the <a href="Battle_of_Odawara" title="wikilink">Battle of Odawara</a> in 1590. He take the family name of Tsugaru at that time. At the <a href="Battle_of_Sekigahara" title="wikilink">Battle of Sekigahara</a>, he sided with <a href="Tokugawa_Ieyasu" title="wikilink">Tokugawa Ieyasu</a> and was subsequently confirmed as lord of <a href="Hirosaki_Domain" title="wikilink">Hirosaki Domain</a> with revenues increased to 47,000 <em>koku</em>.</p>
<p>In 1603, he began work on a castle in Hirosaki, however, work was suspended with his death in <a href="Kyoto" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kyoto</a> in 1604. Work was resumed by his successor, <a href="Tsugaru_Nobuhira" title="wikilink">Tsugaru Nobuhira</a> in 1609, who stripped Horikoshi Castle and &lt;U+014C&gt;ura Castle of buildings and materials in order to speed its completion. The new castle was completed in 1611. However, in 1627, the main <a href="keep" class="uri" title="wikilink">keep</a>, which was originally a 6-story, 5-roof structure was struck by lightning and exploded when the fire reached its <a href="gunpowder_magazine" title="wikilink">gunpowder magazine</a>. It was not rebuilt until 1810, when the present 3-story structure was erected by the 9th daimy&lt;U+014D&gt;, <a href="Tsugaru_Yasuchika" title="wikilink">Tsugaru Yasuchika</a>.</p>
<p>With the <a href="Meiji_Restoration" title="wikilink">Meiji Restoration</a> and subsequent <a href="abolition_of_the_han_system" title="wikilink">abolition of the han system</a>, the Tsugaru clan surrendered the castle to the new <a href="Meiji_government" title="wikilink">Meiji government</a>. In 1871, the castle was garrisoned by a detachment of the <a href="Imperial_Japanese_Army" title="wikilink">Imperial Japanese Army</a>, and in 1873 the palace structures, martial arts school and most of the castle walls were pulled down. In 1894, the castle properties were donated by the Tsugaru clan to the government for use as a park, which opened to the general public the following year. In 1898, an <a href="armory" class="uri" title="wikilink">armory</a> was established in the former Third Bailey by the <a href="IJA_8th_Division" title="wikilink">IJA 8th Division</a>. In 1906, two of the remaining <a href="yagura" class="uri" title="wikilink">yagura</a> burned down. In 1909, a four-meter tall bronze statue of Tsugaru Tamenobu was erected on the site of the donjon. In 1937, eight structures of the castle received protection from the government as &lt;U+201C&gt;national treasures&lt;U+201D&gt;. However, in 1944, during the height of <a href="World_War_II" title="wikilink">World War II</a>, all of the <a href="bronze" class="uri" title="wikilink">bronze</a> in the castle, including roof tiles and decorations, were stripped away for use in the war effort.</p>
<p>In 1950, under the new cultural properties protection system, all surviving structures in the castle (with the exception of the East Gate of the 3rd Bailey) were named National Important Cultural Properties (ICP). In 1952, the grounds received further protection with their nomination as a National Historic Monument. In 1953, after reconstruction, the East Gate of the 3rd Bailey also gained ICP status, giving a total of nine structures within the castle with such protection.</p>
<p>Extensive archaeological excavations from 1999-2000 revealed the foundations of the former palace structures and a <a href="Shinto_shrine" title="wikilink">Shinto shrine</a>. The castle was included in the listing of &lt;U+201C&gt;100 Famous Castles of Japan&lt;U+201D&gt; in 2006.</p>

<p>The current donjon of the castle was completed in 1811. It is a three-story building with three roofs, and a height of 14.4 meters. The design is smaller than early Edo-period varieties of donjons, and it was built on a corner of the inner bailey on the site of a <em><a href="yagura" class="uri" title="wikilink">yagura</a></em>, rather than the stone base of the original donjon. The small size was partly due to the restricted finances of the domain towards the end of the Edo period, but its location and design were also intended to alleviate concerns which might be raised by the <a href="Tokugawa_shogunate" title="wikilink">Tokugawa shogunate</a> should a larger structure be built. At present, it is a separate standing structure; however, prior to 1896 it had an attached gatehouse.</p>
<p>The donjon is surrounded by three surviving <em>yagura</em> from the Edo period (the Ninomaru Tatsumi Yagura, Ninomaru Hitsujisaru Yagura, Ninomaru Ushitora Yagura), on its second bailey, and five surviving gates (Sannomaru &lt;U+014C&gt;temon Gate, Sannomaru East Gate, Ninomaru South Gate, Ninomaru East Gate, Kitanokuruwa North Gate) in the walls of its second and third baileys. All of these structures, including the donjon itself, are National Important Cultural Properties.</p>
<p>The surrounding Hirosaki Park around the castle grounds is one of Japan's most famous <a href="sakura" title="wikilink">cherry blossom</a> spots. Over a million people enjoy the park's 2600 trees (which were originally planted around in grounds in 1903) during the <em>sakura matsuri</em> (cherry blossom festival) when the cherry blossoms are in bloom, usually during the Japanese <a href="Golden_Week_(Japan)" title="wikilink">Golden Week</a> holidays in the end of April and beginning of May.</p>
