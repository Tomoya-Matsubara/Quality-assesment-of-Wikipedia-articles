<p>Henry Nicholas Greenwell was born January 9, 1826 in <a href="Lanchester,_County_Durham" title="wikilink">Lanchester</a>, <a href="County_Durham" title="wikilink">County Durham</a>, <a href="England" class="uri" title="wikilink">England</a>. His father was William Thomas Greenwell (1777&lt;U+2013&gt;1856) and mother was Dorothy Smales (1789&lt;U+2013&gt;1871).<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> His oldest brother was <a href="William_Greenwell" title="wikilink">William Greenwell</a> (1820&lt;U+2013&gt;1918) an English <a href="archaeologist" class="uri" title="wikilink">archaeologist</a>. His sister Dorothy (1821&lt;U+2013&gt;1882) published poetry under the name <a href="Dora_Greenwell" title="wikilink">Dora Greenwell</a>.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> He had two other older brothers Francis Greenwell (1823&lt;U+2013&gt;1894) and Alan Gerenwell (1824&lt;U+2013&gt;1819).<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> As fourth son he had little chance of inheriting the family estate called Greenwell Ford.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> He attended <a href="Durham_School" title="wikilink">Durham School</a> and <a href="Royal_Military_Academy_Sandhurst" title="wikilink">Royal Military Academy Sandhurst</a> expecting a military career.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1844 Greenwell purchased a commission as a <a href="Lieutenant" class="uri" title="wikilink">Lieutenant</a> in the <a href="70th_(Surrey)_Regiment_of_Foot" title="wikilink">70th Regiment</a> of the British Army which was stationed in <a href="Ireland" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ireland</a> during the <a href="great_Famine_(Ireland)" title="wikilink">great Famine</a>.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> He became disenchanted, sold his commission in 1847 and on March 15, 1848, left for <a href="Melbourne" class="uri" title="wikilink">Melbourne</a>, <a href="Australia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Australia</a>. Arriving in June 1848, he traveled to <a href="Sydney" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sydney</a> looking for a sheep or cattle station, but came instead to <a href="California" class="uri" title="wikilink">California</a> in 1849 for the <a href="California_Gold_Rush" title="wikilink">California Gold Rush</a>.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> When the ship arrived in <a href="San_Francisco" title="wikilink">San Francisco</a>, the crew immediately left and headed for the gold fields, leaving him with goods he intended to sell. To recover from an injury during the unloading, he sailed to the <a href="Hawaiian_Islands" title="wikilink">Hawaiian Islands</a> in January 1850.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> After a brief time in <a href="Honolulu" class="uri" title="wikilink">Honolulu</a> working at the H. J. Holdsworth store, he moved to <a href="Kailua-Kona" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kailua-Kona</a>, and opened a retail store in the <a href="Kona_District,_Hawaii" title="wikilink">Kona District</a> in late 1850.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<p>In late 1852 one of his Chinese servants died after being accused of theft. Greenwell was arrested and charged with <a href="second_degree_murder" title="wikilink">second degree murder</a>. <a href="Asher_B._Bates" title="wikilink">Asher B. Bates</a> was prosecutor, <a href="William_Little_Lee" title="wikilink">William Little Lee</a> judge, and a jury of British subjects was found for the trial in January 1853. Witnesses testified that Greenwell had beaten or whipped the man, but others said the man was already ill and that Greenwell treated his employees fairly.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> After half an hour the jury unanimously found him not guilty.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> The case formed a precedent still cited in the Hawaii state criminal code.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<p>He became successful growing <a href="Orange_(fruit)" title="wikilink">Oranges</a> to send to the expanding California market. However, in 1866 the crop was destroyed by <a href="blight" class="uri" title="wikilink">blight</a>, so he looked to diversify.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> In 1867 on what would be a <a href="circumnavigation" class="uri" title="wikilink">circumnavigation</a> of the earth, he visited <a href="New_Zealand" title="wikilink">New Zealand</a> and returned to England to visit family. On his return he picked up a new variety of Oranges in <a href="Brazil" class="uri" title="wikilink">Brazil</a>, and ideas for other potential crops. He also met his future wife on the voyage.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> Greenwell married Elizabeth Caroline Hall (1841&lt;U+2013&gt;1934) April 9, 1868 and had six sons, four daughters, and 23 grandchildren. The new crop being grown in this area was <a href="coffea" class="uri" title="wikilink">coffea</a>, the tree bearing the fruit made into &quot;beans&quot; for <a href="coffee" class="uri" title="wikilink">coffee</a>. The first trees were brought to the Kona area by missionaries at nearby <a href="Kahikolu_Church" title="wikilink">Kahikolu Church</a> in the late 1820s. The few earlier attempts had uneven results, but the Greenwell brand developed a reputation for consistent quality for <a href="Kona_coffee" title="wikilink">Kona coffee</a>.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
<p>Greenwell served as Collector of Customs at the port at <a href="Kealakekua_Bay" title="wikilink">Kealakekua Bay</a>, and as Postmaster and area School Superintendent. A stone building was built just south of the wooden house, in the traditional land division (<em><a href="ahupuaa" title="wikilink">ahupuaa</a></em>) known as Kalukalu (for a type of grass that grows there).<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> The oranges continued to be mentioned by travelers through the area.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
<p><a href="Isabella_Bird" title="wikilink">Isabella Bird</a>, who knew Dora in England, visited the Greenwells in 1873.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> Greenwell's coffee was honored at the <a href="Weltausstellung_1873_Wien" title="wikilink">1873 World's Fair</a> in <a href="Vienna" class="uri" title="wikilink">Vienna</a>. In 1876 Greenwell provided coffee as part of the <a href="Centennial_Exposition" title="wikilink">Centennial Exposition</a> in <a href="Philadelphia,_Pennsylvania" title="wikilink">Philadelphia, Pennsylvania</a>.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> The Greenwell family traded in sheep skins and dairy products, eventually using the profits to buy more land in the area. Coffee only grows in a narrow elevation band, so drier areas above the usual cloud cover were used as pasture land for cattle, sheep, and horses. Early in 1879, the royal physician <a href="Georges_Phillipe_Trousseau" title="wikilink">Georges Phillipe Trousseau</a> sold all of his holdings in Kona to Greenwell.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> Other lands were purchased from the family of missionary <a href="John_Davis_Paris" title="wikilink">John Davis Paris</a>.</p>

<p>Greenwell died May 18, 1891 aboard a steamer that he often took between the islands.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> He and many family members are buried at the Christ Church Episcopal cemetery, near the store on the <a href="Hawaii_Belt_Road" title="wikilink">Hawaii Belt Road</a>.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> Elizabeth Greenwell operated the store after his death, and many children and grandchildren became active in farming and ranching on the nearby lands.</p>
<p>While the <a href="Reciprocity_Treaty_of_1875" title="wikilink">Reciprocity Treaty of 1875</a> had caused most large Hawaii coffee plantations to convert to <a href="sugar_plantations_in_Hawaii" title="wikilink">sugarcane</a>, this was not practical in the steep Kona district. Instead, small plots were leased to individual families, often Chinese, Japanese, or Portuguese immigrants after their labor contracts on sugar plantations expired. Quality improved further with the introduction of the <em>Guatemalan</em> variety via <a href="Hermann_A._Widemann" title="wikilink">Hermann A. Widemann</a>, which turned out to be well-adapted to higher elevations; it remains a popular variety through modern times.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a></p>
