<p>&quot;<strong>Nothing To My Name</strong>&quot; (; also known in English as &quot;I Have Nothing&quot;) is the English title of a 1986 <a href="Standard_Mandarin" title="wikilink">Mandarin</a> <a href="rock_music" title="wikilink">rock</a> song by <a href="Cui_Jian" title="wikilink">Cui Jian</a>. It is widely considered Cui's most famous and most important work, and one of the most influential songs in the history of the <a href="People&#39;s_Republic_of_China" title="wikilink">People's Republic of China</a>; the song was an unofficial <a href="anthem" class="uri" title="wikilink">anthem</a> for Chinese youth and activists during the <a href="Tiananmen_Square_protests_of_1989" title="wikilink">Tiananmen Square protests of 1989</a>.</p>
<p>Both in its lyrics and instruments, the song mixes <a href="Music_of_China#Traditional_music" title="wikilink">traditional Chinese styles</a> with modern <a href="rock_and_roll" title="wikilink">rock and roll</a> elements. The lyrics of the song evoke senses of disillusionment and lack of individual freedom that were common among the young generation in China during the 1980s.</p>
<h2 id="historical-context">Historical context</h2>

<p>By the late 1970s, <a href="Western_world" title="wikilink">Western</a> rock music was gaining popularity in <a href="mainland_China" title="wikilink">mainland China</a>; after the <a href="Cultural_Revolution" title="wikilink">Cultural Revolution</a> ended in the mid-1970s and the government began a period of economic reform called <em><a href="Economic_reform_in_the_People&#39;s_Republic_of_China" title="wikilink">gaige kaifang</a></em>, many students and businessmen went abroad and brought back Western music. Chinese singers began performing covers of popular Western rock songs.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>At the same time, Chinese society and the Chinese government were quickly abandoning <a href="Maoism" class="uri" title="wikilink">Maoism</a>, and pushing <a href="Capitalism" title="wikilink">capitalist</a> economic policies.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> Many Chinese teens and students were becoming disillusioned with their government, which they felt had abandoned its ideals;<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> furthermore, because of the rapid economic changes, many of them felt that they had no opportunities and no individual freedom.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> These factors contributed to the successful reception of &quot;Nothing To My Name&quot; among Chinese youth in the 1980s.</p>

<p>When Cui first performed the song in 1986, the government-controlled <em><a href="People&#39;s_Daily" title="wikilink">People's Daily</a></em> surprisingly gave it a positive review, considering its politically sensitive message.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> This song and others in Cui's performances had, however, a major influence on the underground movement among Chinese teens, and not long after his 1989 performance at Tiananmen Cui was restricted to playing in small venues; he did not play before a large audience in mainland China again until 2005.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="music-and-lyrics">Music and lyrics</h2>
<h3 id="musical-style">Musical style</h3>
<p>Cui was heavily influenced by Western artists such as <a href="Bob_Dylan" title="wikilink">Bob Dylan</a>, <a href="The_Beatles" title="wikilink">The Beatles</a>, <a href="The_Rolling_Stones" title="wikilink">The Rolling Stones</a>, and <a href="The_Talking_Heads" title="wikilink">The Talking Heads</a>;<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> in the late 1980s he even performed with a hair style meant to imitate that of <a href="John_Lennon" title="wikilink">John Lennon</a>.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> In &quot;Nothing To My Name&quot; and other songs, he intentionally altered the sounds of <a href="List_of_traditional_Chinese_musical_instruments" title="wikilink">traditional Chinese musical instruments</a> by mixing them with elements of rock music, such as <a href="electric_guitar" title="wikilink">electric guitar</a>.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> He also purposely divorced his musical style from that of the <a href="revolutionary_song" title="wikilink">revolutionary songs</a> and <a href="proletariat" title="wikilink">proletarian</a> operas that were common under Chairman <a href="Mao_Zedong" title="wikilink">Mao Zedong</a> during the <a href="Cultural_Revolution" title="wikilink">Cultural Revolution</a>â€”for example, he performed his music very loud, as high as 150 <a href="decibel" title="wikilink">decibels</a>, just because Mao had considered loud music disruptive to the social order.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="lyrics-and-meaning">Lyrics and meaning</h3>
<p>Throughout the song, the narrator addresses an unidentified girl, asking when she will &quot;go with&quot; him, and lamenting the fact that she ridicules him for having nothing to his name. Interpretations of the song's meaning vary from one listener to another; the song has been interpreted as being both a political song and a song about love or sex.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a><a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> One music scholar describes the lyrics as being directed &quot;as much to China as to a girlfriend.&quot;<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> This ambiguity stems partially from the structure of the phrase <em>y&lt;U+012B&gt; w&lt;U+00FA&gt; su&lt;U+014F&gt; y&lt;U+014F&gt;u</em>, an idiomatic <em><a href="chengyu" class="uri" title="wikilink">chengyu</a></em>: it literally means &quot;to have nothing,&quot; and has no <a href="subject_(grammar)" title="wikilink">subject</a>, and thus can be interpreted to mean &quot;<em>I</em> have nothing&quot; (suggesting that it is a song about two people), or &quot;<em>we</em> have nothing&quot; (suggesting that it is a song about society and politics).<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a></p>

<p>Music scholar <a href="Dennis_Rea" title="wikilink">Dennis Rea</a> describes the song's <a href="lyrics" class="uri" title="wikilink">lyrics</a> as a means of expressing politically sensitive ideas that couldn't be stated through other mediums; for example, the lyrics near the beginning, &quot;I've asked you without end / When will you go with me / But you always laughed at me / for having nothing to my name&quot; (&quot;&lt;U+6211&gt;&lt;U+66FE&gt;&lt;U+7ECF&gt;&lt;U+95EE&gt;&lt;U+4E2A&gt;&lt;U+4E0D&gt;&lt;U+4F11&gt; / &lt;U+4F60&gt;&lt;U+4F55&gt;&lt;U+65F6&gt;&lt;U+6839&gt;&lt;U+6211&gt;&lt;U+8D70&gt; / &lt;U+53EF&gt;&lt;U+4F60&gt;&lt;U+5374&gt;&lt;U+603B&gt;&lt;U+662F&gt;&lt;U+7B11&gt;&lt;U+6211&gt; / &lt;U+4E00&gt;&lt;U+65E0&gt;&lt;U+6240&gt;&lt;U+6709&gt;&quot;) are claimed to express the &quot;lack of freedom&quot; of people in China at that time,<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> and the &quot;sense of loss and disorientation&quot; among China's youth.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> The repeated lyric &quot;I have nothing to my name&quot; is thought to refer to the &quot;humiliation and lack of individuality, possession, and personal freedom&quot; among the younger generation in the 1980s.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> The narrator of the song worries that the girl he is addressing will ignore him because he has nothing to give her; likewise, the song's audience in the 1980sâ€”young students and workersâ€”were also suffering from not having resources to marry, to be with their girlfriends and boyfriends, or to attract members of the opposite sex.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> Brace has described this common analysis of the song lyrics as &quot;recast[ing] the setting of this piece from that of a boy talking to his girlfriend to that of a youthful generation talking to the nation as a whole.&quot;<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a></p>
<p>The lyrics also express Western concepts of <a href="individualism" class="uri" title="wikilink">individualism</a>,<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> and were some of the first popular song lyrics in China to promote self-expression and individual freedom, in contrast with older music, which had emphasized conformity and obedience.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> Near the end of the song, the narrator proclaims to the girl that he will &quot;grab her hands&quot; (&quot;&lt;U+6211&gt;&lt;U+8981&gt;&lt;U+6293&gt;&lt;U+8D77&gt;&lt;U+4F60&gt;&lt;U+7684&gt;&lt;U+53CC&gt;&lt;U+624B&gt;&quot;) and then she will go with him&lt;U+3000&gt;(&quot;&lt;U+4F60&gt;&lt;U+8FD9&gt;&lt;U+5C31&gt;&lt;U+8DDF&gt;&lt;U+6211&gt;&lt;U+8D70&gt;&quot;); in the end he suggests that she can love the fact that he has nothing (&quot;&lt;U+83AB&gt;&lt;U+975E&gt;&lt;U+4F60&gt;&lt;U+662F&gt;&lt;U+6B63&gt;&lt;U+5728&gt;&lt;U+544A&gt;&lt;U+8BC9&gt;&lt;U+6211&gt; / &lt;U+4F60&gt;&lt;U+7231&gt;&lt;U+6211&gt;&lt;U+4E00&gt;&lt;U+65E0&gt;&lt;U+6240&gt;&lt;U+6709&gt;&quot;). According to one interpretation, this suggests that the song is about &quot;love conquering all.&quot;<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a></p>
<p>Just as Cui adapts traditional Chinese sounds and instruments to a new format, in &quot;Nothing To My Name&quot; he also reappropriates traditional Chinese lyrical <a href="trope_(literature)" title="wikilink">tropes</a>: the song includes lines such as &quot;The earth under your feet is moving / The water around your body is flowing&quot; (&quot;&lt;U+811A&gt;&lt;U+4E0B&gt;&lt;U+7684&gt;&lt;U+5730&gt;&lt;U+5728&gt;&lt;U+8D70&gt; / &lt;U+8EAB&gt;&lt;U+8FB9&gt;&lt;U+7684&gt;&lt;U+6C34&gt;&lt;U+5728&gt;&lt;U+6D41&gt;&quot;), which are reminiscent of the use of natural <a href="imagery" class="uri" title="wikilink">imagery</a> in classical <a href="Chinese_poetry" title="wikilink">Chinese poetry</a> and <a href="Yayue" title="wikilink">music</a>, but here are intended to evoke the events going on around the song's listeners, and to provoke them to rebel against the authorities.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a></p>
