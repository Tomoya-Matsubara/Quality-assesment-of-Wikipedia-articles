<p>&quot;<strong>Nothing To My Name</strong>&quot; (; also known in English as &quot;I Have Nothing&quot;) is the English title of a 1986 <a href="Standard_Mandarin" title="wikilink">Mandarin</a> <a href="rock_music" title="wikilink">rock</a> song by <a href="Cui_Jian" title="wikilink">Cui Jian</a>. It is widely considered Cui's most famous and most important work, and one of the most influential songs in the history of the <a href="People&#39;s_Republic_of_China" title="wikilink">People's Republic of China</a>; the song was an unofficial <a href="anthem" class="uri" title="wikilink">anthem</a> for Chinese youth and activists during the <a href="Tiananmen_Square_protests_of_1989" title="wikilink">Tiananmen Square protests of 1989</a>.</p>
<p>Both in its lyrics and instruments, the song mixes <a href="Music_of_China#Traditional_music" title="wikilink">traditional Chinese styles</a> with modern <a href="rock_and_roll" title="wikilink">rock and roll</a> elements. The lyrics of the song evoke senses of disillusionment and lack of individual freedom that were common among the young generation in China during the 1980s.</p>
<h2 id="historical-context">Historical context</h2>

<p>By the late 1970s, <a href="Western_world" title="wikilink">Western</a> rock music was gaining popularity in <a href="mainland_China" title="wikilink">mainland China</a>; after the <a href="Cultural_Revolution" title="wikilink">Cultural Revolution</a> ended in the mid-1970s and the government began a period of economic reform called <em><a href="Economic_reform_in_the_People&#39;s_Republic_of_China" title="wikilink">gaige kaifang</a></em>, many students and businessmen went abroad and brought back Western music. Chinese singers began performing covers of popular Western rock songs.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>At the same time, Chinese society and the Chinese government were quickly abandoning <a href="Maoism" class="uri" title="wikilink">Maoism</a>, and pushing <a href="Capitalism" title="wikilink">capitalist</a> economic policies.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> Many Chinese teens and students were becoming disillusioned with their government, which they felt had abandoned its ideals;<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> furthermore, because of the rapid economic changes, many of them felt that they had no opportunities and no individual freedom.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> These factors contributed to the successful reception of &quot;Nothing To My Name&quot; among Chinese youth in the 1980s.</p>

<p>When Cui first performed the song in 1986, the government-controlled <em><a href="People&#39;s_Daily" title="wikilink">People's Daily</a></em> surprisingly gave it a positive review, considering its politically sensitive message.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> This song and others in Cui's performances had, however, a major influence on the underground movement among Chinese teens, and not long after his 1989 performance at Tiananmen Cui was restricted to playing in small venues; he did not play before a large audience in mainland China again until 2005.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="music-and-lyrics">Music and lyrics</h2>
<h3 id="musical-style">Musical style</h3>
<p>Cui was heavily influenced by Western artists such as <a href="Bob_Dylan" title="wikilink">Bob Dylan</a>, <a href="The_Beatles" title="wikilink">The Beatles</a>, <a href="The_Rolling_Stones" title="wikilink">The Rolling Stones</a>, and <a href="The_Talking_Heads" title="wikilink">The Talking Heads</a>;<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> in the late 1980s he even performed with a hair style meant to imitate that of <a href="John_Lennon" title="wikilink">John Lennon</a>.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> In &quot;Nothing To My Name&quot; and other songs, he intentionally altered the sounds of <a href="List_of_traditional_Chinese_musical_instruments" title="wikilink">traditional Chinese musical instruments</a> by mixing them with elements of rock music, such as <a href="electric_guitar" title="wikilink">electric guitar</a>.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> He also purposely divorced his musical style from that of the <a href="revolutionary_song" title="wikilink">revolutionary songs</a> and <a href="proletariat" title="wikilink">proletarian</a> operas that were common under Chairman <a href="Mao_Zedong" title="wikilink">Mao Zedong</a> during the <a href="Cultural_Revolution" title="wikilink">Cultural Revolution</a>—for example, he performed his music very loud, as high as 150 <a href="decibel" title="wikilink">decibels</a>, just because Mao had considered loud music disruptive to the social order.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="lyrics-and-meaning">Lyrics and meaning</h3>
<p>Throughout the song, the narrator addresses an unidentified girl, asking when she will &quot;go with&quot; him, and lamenting the fact that she ridicules him for having nothing to his name. Interpretations of the song's meaning vary from one listener to another; the song has been interpreted as being both a political song and a song about love or sex.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a><a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> One music scholar describes the lyrics as being directed &quot;as much to China as to a girlfriend.&quot;<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> This ambiguity stems partially from the structure of the phrase <em>y&lt;U+012B&gt; w&lt;U+00FA&gt; su&lt;U+014F&gt; y&lt;U+014F&gt;u</em>, an idiomatic <em><a href="chengyu" class="uri" title="wikilink">chengyu</a></em>: it literally means &quot;to have nothing,&quot; and has no <a href="subject_(grammar)" title="wikilink">subject</a>, and thus can be interpreted to mean &quot;<em>I</em> have nothing&quot; (suggesting that it is a song about two people), or &quot;<em>we</em> have nothing&quot; (suggesting that it is a song about society and politics).<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a></p>

<p>Music scholar <a href="Dennis_Rea" title="wikilink">Dennis Rea</a> describes the song's <a href="lyrics" class="uri" title="wikilink">lyrics</a> as a means of expressing politically sensitive ideas that couldn't be stated through other mediums; for example, the lyrics near the beginning, &quot;I've asked you without end / When will you go with me / But you always laughed at me / for having nothing to my name&quot; (&quot;&lt;U+6211&gt;&lt;U+66FE&gt;&lt;U+7ECF&gt;&lt;U+95EE&gt;&lt;U+4E2A&gt;&lt;U+4E0D&gt;&lt;U+4F11&gt; / &lt;U+4F60&gt;&lt;U+4F55&gt;&lt;U+65F6&gt;&lt;U+6839&gt;&lt;U+6211&gt;&lt;U+8D70&gt; / &lt;U+53EF&gt;&lt;U+4F60&gt;&lt;U+5374&gt;&lt;U+603B&gt;&lt;U+662F&gt;&lt;U+7B11&gt;&lt;U+6211&gt; / &lt;U+4E00&gt;&lt;U+65E0&gt;&lt;U+6240&gt;&lt;U+6709&gt;&quot;) are claimed to express the &quot;lack of freedom&quot; of people in China at that time,<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> and the &quot;sense of loss and disorientation&quot; among China's youth.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> The repeated lyric &quot;I have nothing to my name&quot; is thought to refer to the &quot;humiliation and lack of individuality, possession, and personal freedom&quot; among the younger generation in the 1980s.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> The narrator of the song worries that the girl he is addressing will ignore him because he has nothing to give her; likewise, the song's audience in the 1980s—young students and workers—were also suffering from not having resources to marry, to be with their girlfriends and boyfriends, or to attract members of the opposite sex.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> Brace has described this common analysis of the song lyrics as &quot;recast[ing] the setting of this piece from that of a boy talking to his girlfriend to that of a youthful generation talking to the nation as a whole.&quot;<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a></p>
<p>The lyrics also express Western concepts of <a href="individualism" class="uri" title="wikilink">individualism</a>,<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> and were some of the first popular song lyrics in China to promote self-expression and individual freedom, in contrast with older music, which had emphasized conformity and obedience.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> Near the end of the song, the narrator proclaims to the girl that he will &quot;grab her hands&quot; (&quot;&lt;U+6211&gt;&lt;U+8981&gt;&lt;U+6293&gt;&lt;U+8D77&gt;&lt;U+4F60&gt;&lt;U+7684&gt;&lt;U+53CC&gt;&lt;U+624B&gt;&quot;) and then she will go with him&lt;U+3000&gt;(&quot;&lt;U+4F60&gt;&lt;U+8FD9&gt;&lt;U+5C31&gt;&lt;U+8DDF&gt;&lt;U+6211&gt;&lt;U+8D70&gt;&quot;); in the end he suggests that she can love the fact that he has nothing (&quot;&lt;U+83AB&gt;&lt;U+975E&gt;&lt;U+4F60&gt;&lt;U+662F&gt;&lt;U+6B63&gt;&lt;U+5728&gt;&lt;U+544A&gt;&lt;U+8BC9&gt;&lt;U+6211&gt; / &lt;U+4F60&gt;&lt;U+7231&gt;&lt;U+6211&gt;&lt;U+4E00&gt;&lt;U+65E0&gt;&lt;U+6240&gt;&lt;U+6709&gt;&quot;). According to one interpretation, this suggests that the song is about &quot;love conquering all.&quot;<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a></p>
<p>Just as Cui adapts traditional Chinese sounds and instruments to a new format, in &quot;Nothing To My Name&quot; he also reappropriates traditional Chinese lyrical <a href="trope_(literature)" title="wikilink">tropes</a>: the song includes lines such as &quot;The earth under your feet is moving / The water around your body is flowing&quot; (&quot;&lt;U+811A&gt;&lt;U+4E0B&gt;&lt;U+7684&gt;&lt;U+5730&gt;&lt;U+5728&gt;&lt;U+8D70&gt; / &lt;U+8EAB&gt;&lt;U+8FB9&gt;&lt;U+7684&gt;&lt;U+6C34&gt;&lt;U+5728&gt;&lt;U+6D41&gt;&quot;), which are reminiscent of the use of natural <a href="imagery" class="uri" title="wikilink">imagery</a> in classical <a href="Chinese_poetry" title="wikilink">Chinese poetry</a> and <a href="Yayue" title="wikilink">music</a>, but here are intended to evoke the events going on around the song's listeners, and to provoke them to rebel against the authorities.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a></p>
