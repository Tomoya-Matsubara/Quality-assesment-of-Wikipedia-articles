As more and more zombie-fied creatures attack the group, they use every implement available to defend themselves.</p>
<h2 id="critical-reception">Critical reception</h2>
<p><em><a href="DVD_Talk" title="wikilink">DVD Talk</a></em> made note that being written, directed, and produced by Frank Sudol, the film &quot;is quite literally a one-man show.&quot; They wrote that as a &quot;crudely animated tale&quot; from an individual otherwise known for his work as an artist on <em><a href="South_Park:_Bigger,_Longer,_and_Uncut" title="wikilink">South Park: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut</a></em>, the film &quot;is a very interesting curiosity.&quot; They also note Sudol <a href="multi-task" title="wikilink">multi-tasking</a> as animator, musician, and the <a href="Voice_artist" title="wikilink">vocal artist</a> for all the characters. Noting that <em>Dead Fury</em> is not sucessful as a <a href="feature-length" class="uri" title="wikilink">feature-length</a> film, they praise Sudol by writing &quot;kudos to Sudol for sticking to his vision and making it.&quot; They also shared that in his commentrary track, Sudol spoke toward a number of films that inspired the creation of <em>Dead Fury</em>, including <em><a href="Friday_the_13th_(film)" title="wikilink">Friday the 13th</a></em>, but that the film was &quot; clearly a homage to <em><a href="The_Evil_Dead" title="wikilink">The Evil Dead</a></em> and <em><a href="The_Hills_Have_Eyes" title="wikilink">The Hills Have Eyes</a></em>&quot;. They also noted that while the film has a great deal of gore, &quot;its gore and over-the-top violence are played for laughs primarily.&quot; They wrote that there was much to admire in the film, but that the action became repetitive. They conclude that fans of &quot;gory horror films would probably find Dead Fury entertaining&quot;, and that it's &quot;creative enough for other movie fans to add it to their rental lists.&quot; But summarized that the film would have been better as a 25-minute short.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p><em><a href="Film_Threat" title="wikilink">Film Threat</a></em> panned the film, finding it to be &quot;shamelessly cartoonish&quot; in a maner that would leave horror fans &quot;speechless at this audience-insulting wreck&quot;. They granted that &quot;Those who treat <em><a href="Fangoria" class="uri" title="wikilink">Fangoria</a></em> as a pinup mag will smile at the demonic/punk zombies&quot; as conceived by Frank Sudol,&quot; but that those same fans &quot;will scratch their heads when seeing the zombie curse float as a ball of light, like <a href="Tinkerbell" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tinkerbell</a>.&quot; They noted that the characters were &quot;flat and move like cardboard across the screen,&quot; and felt that while some filmmakers were innovatotors in their field, they &quot;should never be an inspiration&quot;.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<p><em>Movie Cynics</em> praised Frank Sudol for his work on <em><a href="City_of_Rott" title="wikilink">City of Rott</a></em> acting as &quot;a testament to what one man can do with a shitload of time and some skill at animating,&quot; but noted that <em>Dead Fury</em> while interesting, was less successful. They noted its paying homage not only to <a href="zombie_film" title="wikilink">zombie movies</a> but also to &quot;every backwoods <a href="demonic_possession" title="wikilink">demonic possession</a> story that you&lt;U+2019&gt;ve ever seen&quot;, and how it could compare to <em><a href="Evil_Dead" title="wikilink">Evil Dead</a></em> if such were to be done by <a href="Adult_Swim" title="wikilink">Adult Swim</a>. They further expanded that its length was a major flaw in that the film &quot;falls apart after the first 45 minutes,&quot; and that it would have been better if shorter. They also note that while its &quot;characters are interesting, humorous, and fairly likable,&quot; the writing becomes &quot;boring and repetitive.&quot;<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<p><em><a href="Philadelphia_City_Paper" title="wikilink">Philadelphia City Paper</a></em> referred to the film's length as &quot;excruciating&quot; and made note that the film's flaws included production values that &quot;would barely pass muster on YouTube&quot;, a story concept that seemed &quot;borrowed ideas seemingly made in an afternoon in between Xbox games&quot;, and juvenile humor &quot;penned at a sixth-grade reading level.&quot;<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<p>Conversely, <em><a href="Dread_Central" title="wikilink">Dread Central</a></em> found no flaws. The reviewer made note that the film was from the same individual who created <em><a href="City_of_Rott" title="wikilink">City of Rott</a></em>, and that he was initially worried that <em>Dead Fury</em> might not favorable compare to the earlier film. After veiwing, he was able to state it &quot;not only remains on top of its game, but it outdoes <em>City of Rott</em> at every turn!&quot; The reviwer also noted that the film was was not a sequel, but was instead an original story that &quot;takes its cues from horror favorites <em><a href="The_Evil_Dead" title="wikilink">The Evil Dead</a></em> and <em><a href="The_Hills_Have_Eyes" title="wikilink">The Hills Have Eyes</a></em>,&quot; acting as an homage and &quot;absolute love letter to the films that it borrows from.&quot; The reviewer praised Frank Sudol as &quot;a crazed one-man army of mad animated genius,&quot; writing that he &quot;has delivered one of the single most carnage happy, no-holds-barred, mayhem filled, freak shows that I've had the pleasure of sitting through.&quot; He also praised the dialog and delivery as hilarious, writing of it &quot;This is one of those things that's better left to speak for itself. No description I give can do it justice.&quot; Speaking highly toward the DVD extras including an audio commentary by Sudol, the reviewer wrote it was &quot;just as funny as the movie itself,&quot; and concluded by writing &quot;<em>Dead Fury</em> is without question the ultimate experience in grueling animated horror.&quot;<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<p><em>Fatally Yours</em> noted that filmmaker Frank Sudol brought back his character of &quot;Pop&quot; from <em><a href="City_of_Rott" title="wikilink">City of Rott</a></em> for this film, but not in a lead role, nor the film as a sequel. They referred to <em>Dead Fury</em> as a &quot;leaner, meaner movie&quot; when compared to the earlier film, and that it has lots of gore and humor in a plot that is &quot;tighter and a lot more focused.&quot; They praised the filmmaker for &quot;bringing such a colorful and energetic movie to the screen,&quot; and for his work in every aspect of its production. They granted that while the animation style might not appeal to everyone, the film &quot;had its own unique charm&quot; in its hilarity.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="dvd">DVD</h2>
<p>The DVD extras include 40 minutes of excluded storyboards, deleted and extended scenes, the <em>Making of Dead Fury</em> where Sudol narrates his use of <a href="Photoshop" class="uri" title="wikilink">Photoshop</a> to create the film and its characters, a slide show of the original story art, a full commentary track where the filmmaker shares observations about his work and inspirarions, as well as a gallery that includes trailers for <em><a href="City_of_Rott" title="wikilink">City of Rott</a></em>, <em>Dead Fury</em>, <em><a href="Rock_&amp;_Rule" title="wikilink">Rock &amp; Rule</a></em>, <em><a href="Junk_(film)" title="wikilink">Junk</a></em>, and <em><a href="Frankenhooker" class="uri" title="wikilink">Frankenhooker</a></em>,<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a><a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a><a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
