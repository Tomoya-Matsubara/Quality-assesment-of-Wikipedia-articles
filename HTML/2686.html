<p><strong><em>The Boondock Saints</em></strong> is a 1999 <a href="crime_film" title="wikilink">crime</a> <a href="thriller_(genre)" title="wikilink">thriller</a> <a href="film" class="uri" title="wikilink">film</a> written and directed by <a href="Troy_Duffy" title="wikilink">Troy Duffy</a>. The film stars <a href="Sean_Patrick_Flanery" title="wikilink">Sean Patrick Flanery</a> and <a href="Norman_Reedus" title="wikilink">Norman Reedus</a> as <a href="fraternal_twins" title="wikilink">fraternal twins</a> Connor and Murphy MacManus, who become <a href="vigilantes" class="uri" title="wikilink">vigilantes</a> after killing two members of the <a href="Russian_mob" title="wikilink">Russian mob</a> in self-defense. After a message from God, the brothers, together with their friend <a href="David_Della_Rocco" title="wikilink">David Della Rocco</a>, set out to rid their home city of <a href="Boston,_Massachusetts" title="wikilink">Boston</a> of evil, all the while being pursued by <a href="FBI" class="uri" title="wikilink">FBI</a> agent Paul Smecker (<a href="Willem_Dafoe" title="wikilink">Willem Dafoe</a>).</p>
<p>Duffy indicates that the screenplay was inspired by <a href="personal_experience" title="wikilink">personal experience</a>, while living in Los Angeles. The film experienced a limited theatrical release of only five theaters for one week,<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> and was met with poor critical reviews. Nevertheless, it proved divisive among viewers, developing both a large cult following,<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a><a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> as well as enmity from viewers and critics who have called it a film undeserving of cult status.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> The film's cult following may have been partly due to the efforts of <a href="Blockbuster_Video" title="wikilink">Blockbuster Video</a>, which made the film a &quot;Blockbuster Exclusive.&quot; The ending credit sequence, which features the media asking the people of Boston, &quot;Are the 'saints' good or evil?&quot;, was shot by Mark Brian Smith, co-director of <em><a href="Overnight" class="uri" title="wikilink">Overnight</a></em>, a documentary film about the making of <em>The Boondock Saints</em>, and Troy Duffy himself.</p>
<h2 id="plot">Plot</h2>
<p>This film opens with mass in a Boston Catholic church, where fraternal twin brothers Connor McManus (<a href="Sean_Patrick_Flanery" title="wikilink">Sean Patrick Flanery</a>) and Murphy McManus (<a href="Norman_Reedus" title="wikilink">Norman Reedus</a>) pray very deeply while a sermon is read, mentioning <a href="Kitty_Genovese" title="wikilink">Kitty Genovese</a>, a real-life crime victim brutally murdered while her neighbors watched without intervening. As the priest begins his <a href="homily" class="uri" title="wikilink">homily</a>, the brothers, despite astonished stares from Father Macklepenny, approach the altar and kiss the feet of a <a href="crucifix" class="uri" title="wikilink">crucifix</a>. They depart as the priest reminds the congregation that they should fear not just evil but also the &quot;indifference of good men&quot;. The brothers conclude that the priest finally understands, Connor stating, &quot;I do believe the Monsignor's finally got the point...&quot; and Murphy replying, &quot;Aye&quot;.</p>
<p>Connor and Murphy are pious Catholics who work at a local meatpacking plant. While celebrating <a href="St._Patrick&#39;s_Day" title="wikilink">St. Patrick's Day</a> in a neighborhood bar, three Russian &quot;<a href="Mafia#Modern_terminology" title="wikilink">soldiers</a>&quot;, led by Ivan Checkov, enter and order everyone to leave, as <a href="Russian_mafia" title="wikilink">their organization</a> has decided to evict the pub. In the ensuing bar brawl, Connor, Murphy, and the patrons publicly humiliate the mobsters, who the next day ambush the brothers in their home. As Murphy is dragged into a nearby alley to be executed, Connor escapes to the roof and drops a toilet on the mobsters, killing them in <a href="self-defense_(theory)" title="wikilink">self-defense</a> and rescuing Murphy.</p>
<p>The Russian mob's involvement summons FBI agent Paul Smecker (<a href="Willem_Dafoe" title="wikilink">Willem Dafoe</a>) to the murder case, and he surmises that the mobsters' death was not a <a href="contract_killing" title="wikilink">professional hit</a> but self-defense. As the police begin a <a href="Manhunt_(law_enforcement)" title="wikilink">manhunt</a> for the killers, Connor and Murphy arrive at the police station to clear their names. During the initial interrogation, the brothers impress Smecker with their accomplished <a href="multilingualism" class="uri" title="wikilink">multilingualism</a> (including Gaelic, Russian, French, Spanish, Italian, and German) while recalling the specifics of the barfight and subsequent self-defense the next morning. Smecker believes their story and allows them to stay overnight in a holding cell to evade the press. That night in the cell, Connor and Murphy receive a vision from God telling them to destroy all that is evil so that which is good may flourish.</p>
<p>The brothers resolve to rid Boston of &quot;evil men&quot; with the help of their friend and former mob package boy David &quot;The Funnyman&quot; Della Rocco (<a href="David_Della_Rocco" title="wikilink">David Della Rocco</a>). The brothers trade in the weapons and valuables stolen from the mobsters' bodies for their own, and use Connor's knowledge of Russian to locate a meeting between Russian syndicate bosses at a local hotel. Crashing into the room through an overhead air duct, the brothers draw their guns and fire, miraculously killing the 8 underbosses. Forcing the leader, Yuri 'Big Man' Petrova (<a href="Victor_Pedtrchenko" title="wikilink">Victor Pedtrchenko</a>) to his knees, the brothers recite a short prayer and execute him, placing pennies over his eye sockets, in which both of his eyes were shot out. While the brothers are preparing to leave the hotel, they are surprised to find Rocco dressed as a bellboy knocking at the door with a tray of food. They decided &quot;to fuck with him&quot; and pull him into the hotel, concealing their identity with masks, and threaten to execute him. Eventually they reveal their identity much to Rocco's surprise who, after a few beers and some pizza back at Rocco's apartment, decides to join the brothers in their mission. Once again, Agent Smecker is brought to the front of the murder case. The fact that all the killings involved the Russian Mob leads Smecker to the theory that the executions were the result of the feud between the Russian and Italian mobs.</p>
<p>The following day, the bothers try to convince Rocco that he was sold out by Italian Mob Boss, Papa Joe Yakavetta (<a href="Carlo_Rota" title="wikilink">Carlo Rota</a>), because he was sent to the hotel with a six-shooter despite the fact there were eight mobsters in the hotel room. In retaliation, Rocco and the brothers hunt down and kill Vincenzo Lipazzi (<a href="Ron_Jeremy" title="wikilink">Ron Jeremy</a>), underboss of the Yakavetta <a href="crime_family" title="wikilink">crime family</a> at a local strip club. Also killed at the Strip Club are two street criminals with no connection to organized crime (thus defeating Smecker's mob war theory). The three vigilantes proceed on a series of increasingly violent missions, cleansing the city of vicious criminals and others who have eluded justice. Papa Joe, believing that the mob killings are an act of revenge from Rocco, contracts the infamous <a href="contract_killing" title="wikilink">contract killer</a> <a href="Duce" title="wikilink">Il Duce</a> (<a href="Billy_Connolly" title="wikilink">Billy Connolly</a>), to deal with the vengeful package boy.</p>
<p>Following a mission on a mob poker game, the trio is ambushed by Il Duce and in the resulting shootout, the trio manage to chase Il Duce away but Rocco's finger is shot off and each of the brothers receive serious, but not mortal gunshot wounds which they cauterize with a hot iron. Hours later at the crime scene, Smecker discovers the finger and secretly takes it to conduct his own investigation. Discovering that it belongs to Rocco, whom he previously met, Smecker begins to unravel the mystery surrounding the various murders. His sympathy for the brothers conflicting with his professional desire to bring them to justice, Smecker (a flamboyant homosexual) goes on a drinking binge at a gay bar before seeking advice from a nearby Catholic church. Bemoaning the futility of the courts that fail to punish evil men and his uncertainty with the MacManus brothers' actions in a confessional, Smecker is oblivious to the fact that Rocco, who has tracked Smecker to the church, is forcefully (with a gun to his head) directing the priest's responses to preserve the Boondock Saints' identities. Connor sees Rocco follow the priest into the confessional and, disgusted with the blasphemy, pulls Rocco's head through the other confessional at gun point. In whispered tones, Rocco tries to explain to Connor the circumstance all the while still holding his gun to the priest's head. Smecker is advised, reluctantly by the priest, that the Saint's are acting as messengers from God and that &quot;the laws of God are greater than the laws of man.&quot; Inspired by the advice, Smecker (deliriously drunk) decides to help the brothers.</p>
<p>The McManus brothers and Rocco infiltrate the Yakavetta headquarters to finish off the family, but are captured by Papa Joe and his henchmen who recently arrived to protect Papa Joe from such an attack. Papa Joe executes Rocco to intimidate the brothers. It doesn't quite work out that way... The brothers manage to free themselves and tend to Rocco while Smecker, disguised as a female prostitute, distracts the other mobsters. Smecker kills the remaining mobsters only to be knocked unconscious by Il Duce who mistakes Smecker for a woman. As the brothers say their family prayer over Rocco, Il Duce arrives and sneaks up behind them.</p>

<p>As he hears them recite the family prayer, and upon seeing that the man he was hired to kill (Rocco) is dead, he lowers his weapons and joins them. It becomes apparent that Il Duce is their long-lost father, as the brothers had previously refused to teach Rocco the prayer because it is only passed down in their family. He then joins them in their mission to rid the city of evildoers.</p>
<p>Three months later Papa Joe is sent to trial, and though there seems to be enough evidence to convict him, the reporters on scene anticipate his acquittal due to his <a href="John_Gotti" title="wikilink">Gotti</a>-esque charisma. The trial is forcibly interrupted when the two brothers and Il Duce, aided by Agent Smecker and several police officers, infiltrate and lock down the courtroom. The three then publicly declare their mission to destroy evil and recite their prayer one last time, killing Papa Joe with several bullets (and a shotgun blast) to the back of the head. The media dubs the three &quot;Saints&quot;, and the movie ends with various &quot;man-on-the-street&quot; interviews in which various Boston citizens reflect on the question &quot;Are the Saints ultimately good, or evil?&quot;</p>

<p>Writer and director Troy Duffy wrote the screenplay for <em>Boondock Saints</em>, while living in <a href="Los_Angeles,_California" title="wikilink">Los Angeles, California</a>, when he came home from his job to find a dead woman being wheeled out of a drug dealer's apartment across the hall. Duffy then rented a computer (he didn't own one himself) and wrote the screenplay about <em>The Boondock Saints</em>, based on his disgust at what he saw.  The film was directed by Duffy, who had moved to Hollywood to break into the music business. He was a bartender at a sports bar called J. Sloan's when he wrote <em>The Boondock Saints</em>.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> The <a href="documentary_film" title="wikilink">documentary</a> <em>Overnight</em>, which chronicled Duffy's &quot;rags-to-riches&quot; story,<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> showed that the script was worth $300,000, and the film itself was originally given a $15 million budget by <a href="Miramax" class="uri" title="wikilink">Miramax</a>'s <a href="Harvey_Weinstein" title="wikilink">Harvey Weinstein</a>.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> It was in <em>Overnight</em> that Duffy showed abrasive behavior, causing tension for many people involved in the project.

Sloan's, where Duffy worked.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>

Rabin went on to describe the film as &quot;all style and no substance, a film so gleeful in its endorsement of vigilante justice that it almost veers (or ascends) into self-parody.&quot;<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> Other reviews were more positive, with Robert Koehler of <a href="Variety_(magazine)" title="wikilink">Variety</a> describing the film in his review as,</p>

<p>Koehler also described Sean Patrick Flanery and Norman Reedus as &quot;curiously stolid and blank&quot;, while praising supporting actors Billy Connolly and <a href="Carlo_Rota" title="wikilink">Carlo Rota</a> for making the most of their screen time. Koehler also praised the tech personnel, &quot;This uneven exercise in pacing and cutting is abetted by an eclectic score by <a href="Jeff_Danna" title="wikilink">Jeff Danna</a> and whiz lensing by Adam Kane.

Reviewer Vince Leo wrote, &quot;<em>The Boondock Saints</em> is yet another recent entry in the <em>Pulp Fiction</em> clones, where huge doses of violence are mixed in with irreverently funny scenes of cleverness that entertain even if they are basically needless to the overall plot.&quot;<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="sequel">Sequel</h2>

<p>In late March 2002, Duffy posted a letter to fans of the first film, claiming that financial backing had been found for a sequel. It would reportedly have twice the budget of the original film, and &quot;experience a theatrical release.&quot; According to the film's official website, the release date of the sequel <em>The Boondock Saints: All Saints Day</em> would be September 2005, though this never materialized. In an interview with <a href="IGN" class="uri" title="wikilink">IGN</a>, Duffy explained the litigation with the company that controls the rights to the first film,<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> Duffy went on to express his, as well as most of the casts', interest in making the sequel. </p>
<p>In June 2006, it was announced that due to the success of <em>The Boondock Saints</em> on DVD, 20th Century Fox has agreed to finance a sequel.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> In September 2006, a video&lt;U+2014&gt;originally released for a one night showing in May 2006&lt;U+2014&gt;was posted to the Boondocks website.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> In this video, Duffy explains the legal issues of the sequel, confirms that the sequel will in fact be a reality, and mentions a new project called <em>The Good King</em>. It also announces that the film will have a theatrical release in the United States.</p>
<p>Troy Duffy posted a video on his <a href="YouTube" class="uri" title="wikilink">YouTube</a> account on March 17, 2008 (in possible accordance with the holiday <a href="St._Patrick&#39;s_Day" title="wikilink">St. Patrick's Day</a>) which detailed that the sequel has been given a green light by Sony and is set to have the entire cast return with the exception of Willem Dafoe. This film will begin shooting summer of 2008 according to Duffy.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> The clip was taken down from YouTube shortly after it was uploaded, but remains on other accounts.</p>
<p>On June 20, 2008, while being introduced at the <a href="Comedy_Connection" title="wikilink">Comedy Connection</a> in <a href="Boston" class="uri" title="wikilink">Boston</a>, <a href="Massachusetts" class="uri" title="wikilink">Massachusetts</a>, it was stated that <a href="Bob_Marley_(comedian)" title="wikilink">Bob Marley</a> was currently in production of the sequel, reprising his role from the first film.</p>
<p><a href="Pre-production" class="uri" title="wikilink">Pre-production</a> on the film started in early September and the first day of shooting is stated to begin October 20 in Canada. Some scenes may be shot in Boston depending on the film's financing. It has been announced by Duffy that there will be a lead female actress in the sequel (not a love interest). The sequel is supposed to take place 10 years after The Boondock Saints</p>
<p>On October 29, 2008, Troy Duffy revealed that Julie Benz is going to be the female lead and prot&lt;U+00E9&gt;g&lt;U+00E9&gt; of Agent Paul Smecker (<a href="Willem_Dafoe" title="wikilink">Willem Dafoe</a>'s character from the first film), named Eunice. Troy Duffy has been keeping a video diary of the movie's progress on <a href="YouTube" class="uri" title="wikilink">YouTube</a>, with some of the shooting sequences, and &quot;question and answer&quot; segments from fans answered by the film's stars.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a></p>
