<h2 id="biography">Biography</h2>
<p>Alison Krauss was born in <a href="Decatur,_Illinois" title="wikilink">Decatur, Illinois</a> to parents who were originally from <a href="Columbus,_Mississippi" title="wikilink">Columbus, Mississippi</a>. Krauss was raised in <a href="Champaign,_Illinois" title="wikilink">Champaign, Illinois</a>. She began studying <a href="European_classical_music" title="wikilink">classical</a> <a href="violin" class="uri" title="wikilink">violin</a> at five years of age but soon switched to bluegrass. Krauss said she first became involved with music because &quot;[my] mother tried to find interesting things for me to do&quot; and &quot;wanted to get me involved in music, in addition to art and sports.&quot;<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> At age eight she started entering local <a href="talent_show" title="wikilink">talent contests</a>, and at ten she had her own band. At 13 she won the <a href="Walnut_Valley_Festival" title="wikilink">Walnut Valley Festival</a> Fiddle Championship,<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> and the Society for the Preservation of Bluegrass in America named her the Most Promising Fiddler in the Midwest. Krauss first met <a href="Dan_Tyminski" title="wikilink">Dan Tyminski</a> around 1984 at a festival held by the Society. Every current member of her band, Union Station, first met her at these festivals.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>Krauss made her recording debut in 1985 on the independent album, <em>Different Strokes</em>, featuring her brother Viktor, Swamp Weiss, and Jim Hoiles. From the age of 12 she performed with <a href="bass_guitar" title="wikilink">bassist</a> and songwriter John Pennell in a band called &quot;Silver Rail&quot;. Pennell later formed Union Station,<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> and Krauss joined at his invitation, replacing their previous fiddler <a href="Andrea_Zonn" title="wikilink">Andrea Zonn</a>.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> Pennell remains one of her favorite songwriters<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> and wrote some of her early work including the popular &quot;Every Time You Say Goodbye.&quot; Later that year she signed to Rounder Records, and in 1987, at 16, she released her debut album <em>Too Late to Cry.</em> with Union Station as her backup band.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>

<p>Krauss' debut solo album was followed shortly by her first group album with Union Station in 1989 <em>Two Highways</em>.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> Many traditional bluegrass numbers appeared on the album, along with a bluegrass interpretation of <a href="The_Allman_Brothers_Band" title="wikilink">The Allman Brothers</a>' &quot;<a href="Midnight_Rider" title="wikilink">Midnight Rider</a>.&quot; Krauss' contract with Rounder required her to alternate between releasing a solo album and an album with Union Station, and she released the solo album <em>I've Got That Old Feeling</em> in 1990. It was her first album to rise onto the <a href="Billboard_charts" title="wikilink">Billboard charts</a>, peaking in the top seventy-five on the <a href="Hot_Country_Songs" title="wikilink">country chart</a>. The album also was a notable point in her career as she earned her first <a href="Grammy_Award" title="wikilink">Grammy Award</a>, the single &quot;Steel Rails&quot; was her first single tracked by Billboard, and the title single &quot;I've Got That Old Feeling&quot; was the first song for which she recorded a <a href="music_video" title="wikilink">music video</a>. Alison Krauss and Union Station performed at the 1989 <a href="Newport_Folk_Festival" title="wikilink">Newport Folk Festival</a>.</p>

<p>Krauss' second Union Station album <em>Everytime You Say Goodbye</em> was released in 1992, and she went on to win her second Grammy for Best Bluegrass Album of the year. She then joined the <a href="Grand_Ole_Opry" title="wikilink">Grand Ole Opry</a> in 1993 at the age of 21.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> She was the youngest cast member at the time, and the first bluegrass artist to join the Opry in twenty-nine years. She also collaborated on a project with the <a href="The_Cox_Family" title="wikilink">Cox Family</a> in 1994, a bluegrass album called <em>I Know Who Holds Tomorrow</em>. <a href="Mandolin" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mandolin</a> and <a href="guitar" class="uri" title="wikilink">guitar</a> player <a href="Dan_Tyminski" title="wikilink">Dan Tyminski</a> replaced Tim Stafford in Union Station in 1994. Late in the year, Krauss recorded with the band <a href="Shenandoah_(band)" title="wikilink">Shenandoah</a> on its single &quot;<a href="Somewhere_in_the_Vicinity_of_the_Heart" title="wikilink">Somewhere in the Vicinity of the Heart</a>,&quot; which brought her to the country music Top Ten for the first time.</p>
<p><em><a href="Now_That_I&#39;ve_Found_You:_A_Collection" title="wikilink">Now That I've Found You: A Collection</a></em>, a compilation of older releases and some covers of her favorite works by other artists, was released in 1995. Some of these covers include <a href="Bad_Company" title="wikilink">Bad Company</a>'s &quot;Oh Atlanta,&quot; <a href="The_Foundations" title="wikilink">The Foundations</a>' &quot;<a href="Baby,_Now_That_I&#39;ve_Found_You" title="wikilink">Baby, Now That I've Found You</a>,&quot; which was used in the Australian hit comedy movie <a href="The_Castle_(film)" title="wikilink"><em>The Castle</em></a>, and <a href="The_Beatles" title="wikilink">The Beatles</a>' &quot;I Will.&quot;<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> A cover of <a href="Keith_Whitley" title="wikilink">Keith Whitley</a>'s &quot;<a href="When_You_Say_Nothing_at_All" title="wikilink">When You Say Nothing at All</a>&quot; reached the top five on the Billboard country chart; the album peaked in the top fifteen on the all-genre <a href="Billboard_200" title="wikilink">Billboard 200</a> chart, and sold two million copies to become Krauss' first <a href="RIAA_certification" title="wikilink">double-platinum album</a>. Krauss also was nominated for four <a href="Country_Music_Association_Awards" title="wikilink">Country Music Association Awards</a> and won all of them.</p>
<p><em><a href="So_Long_So_Wrong" title="wikilink">So Long So Wrong</a></em>, another Union Station album, was released in 1997 and won the Grammy for Best Bluegrass Album. Some critics said it was &quot;untraditional&quot; and &quot;likely [to] change quite a few . . . minds about bluegrass.&quot;<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> Included on the album is the track &quot;It Doesn't Matter,&quot; which was featured in the second season premiere episode of <em><a href="Buffy_the_Vampire_Slayer_(TV_series)" title="wikilink">Buffy the Vampire Slayer</a></em><a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> and was included on the <em>Buffy</em> soundtrack in 1999.</p>
<p>Her next solo release in 1999, <em><a href="Forget_About_It" title="wikilink">Forget About It</a></em>, included one of her two tracks to appear on the Billboard <a href="Hot_Adult_Contemporary_Tracks" title="wikilink">adult contemporary chart</a>, &quot;Stay.&quot; The album was certified gold, and charted within the top seventy-five of the Billboard 200 and in the top five of the country chart. In addition, the track &quot;That Kind of Love&quot; was included in another episode of <em>Buffy the Vampire Slayer.</em><a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> Krauss was married to <a href="Pat_Bergeson" title="wikilink">Pat Bergeson</a> from 1997 to 2001, and they have one son, Sam, who was born in July 1999.</p>

<p>Adam Steffey left Union Station in 1998, and renowned <a href="Dobro" class="uri" title="wikilink">Dobro</a> player <a href="Jerry_Douglas_(musician)" title="wikilink">Jerry Douglas</a> replaced him.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> Douglas had provided studio back-up to Krauss's records since 1987's <em>Too Late To Cry</em>. Their next album, <em><a href="New_Favorite" title="wikilink">New Favorite</a></em>, was released on August 14, 2001. The album went on to win the Grammy for Best Bluegrass Album, with the single &quot;The Lucky One&quot; winning a Grammy as well. <em>New Favorite</em> was followed up by the double platinum <a href="double_album" title="wikilink">double album</a> <em>Live</em> in 2002 and a release of a DVD of the same live performance in 2003. Both the album and the DVD were recorded during a performance at <a href="The_Louisville_Palace" title="wikilink">The Louisville Palace</a>.</p>
<p><em><a href="Lonely_Runs_Both_Ways" title="wikilink">Lonely Runs Both Ways</a></em> was released in 2004, and eventually became another Alison Krauss &amp; Union Station gold certified album. Ron Block described <em>Lonely Runs Both Ways</em> as &quot;pretty much... what we've always done&quot; in terms of song selection and the style in which those songs were recorded. Krauss believes the group &quot;was probably the most unprepared we've ever been&quot; for the album and that songs were chosen as needed rather than planned beforehand.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> She also performed a duet with <a href="Brad_Paisley" title="wikilink">Brad Paisley</a> on his album <em><a href="Mud_on_the_Tires" title="wikilink">Mud on the Tires</a></em> in the single &quot;<a href="Whiskey_Lullaby" title="wikilink">Whiskey Lullaby</a>.&quot; The single was quite ranked in the top fifty of the <a href="Billboard_Hot_100" title="wikilink">Billboard Hot 100</a> and the top five of the <a href="Hot_Country_Songs" title="wikilink">Hot Country Songs</a>, and won the <a href="Country_Music_Association_Awards" title="wikilink">Country Music Association Awards</a> for &quot;Best Musical Event&quot; and &quot;Best Music Video&quot; of the year.</p>
<p>Krauss recorded a collaborative album, <em><a href="Raising_Sand" title="wikilink">Raising Sand</a></em> with <a href="Robert_Plant" title="wikilink">Robert Plant</a> in 2007 which would ultimately be RIAA certified platinum. <em>Raising Sand</em> was nominated for and won 5 Grammys at the <a href="51st_Grammy_Awards" title="wikilink">51st Grammy Awards</a> including Album of the Year, Best Contemporary Folk/Americana Album, and Record of the Year (&quot;<a href="Please_Read_the_Letter" title="wikilink">Please Read the Letter</a>&quot;). Krauss and Plant recorded a Crossroads special in October 2007 for the <a href="Country_Music_Television" title="wikilink">Country Music Television</a> network which first aired on February 12, 2008. The pair are currently working on a new album.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>

In 1993 she recorded vocals for the <a href="Phish" class="uri" title="wikilink">Phish</a> song &quot;If I Could&quot; in <a href="Los_Angeles" title="wikilink">Los Angeles</a>.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> In 1997 she contributed harmony vocals in both English and <a href="Irish_language" title="wikilink">Irish</a> to <a href="Irish_traditional_music" title="wikilink">Irish traditional</a> band <a href="Altan_(band)" title="wikilink">Altan</a>'s <em><a href="Runaway_Sunday" title="wikilink">Runaway Sunday</a></em> album. She has contributed to numerous motion picture soundtracks, most notably the soundtrack <em><a href="O_Brother,_Where_Art_Thou?_(soundtrack)" title="wikilink">O Brother, Where Art Thou?</a></em> in 2000. She and co-vocalist <a href="Dan_Tyminski" title="wikilink">Dan Tyminski</a> contributed multiple tracks to the soundtrack, including &quot;I'll Fly Away&quot; (with <a href="Gillian_Welch" title="wikilink">Gillian Welch</a>), &quot;Down to the River to Pray&quot;, and &quot;I Am a Man of Constant Sorrow.&quot; </p>
<p>In the film, Tyminski's vocals on &quot;I Am a Man of Constant Sorrow&quot; were used for <a href="George_Clooney" title="wikilink">George Clooney</a>'s character.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> The soundtrack sold over seven million copies and won the Grammy for Album of the Year in 2002. The unexpected success of the album has been partially credited, as was Krauss herself,<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> with bringing a new interest in bluegrass to the United States. She has said, however, that she believes Americans already liked bluegrass and other less-heard musical genres, and that the film merely provided easy exposure to the music.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> She did not appear in the movie, at her own request, as she was nine months pregnant during its filming.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a></p>
<p>In 2007, Krauss released the anthology <em>A Hundred Miles Or More: A Collection</em> which was a collection of soundtrack work, duets with artists such as <a href="John_Waite" title="wikilink">John Waite</a>, <a href="James_Taylor" title="wikilink">James Taylor</a>, <a href="Brad_Paisley" title="wikilink">Brad Paisley</a> and esteemed fiddle player <a href="Natalie_MacMaster" title="wikilink">Natalie MacMaster</a>, and newer tracks. The album was very commercially successful, but was received with a lukewarm reception from critics. One of the tracks, &quot;<a href="Missing_You_(John_Waite_song)" title="wikilink">Missing You</a>&quot;, a duet with Waite (and a cover of his hit single from 1984), was similarly received as a single. On August 11, television network <a href="Great_American_Country" title="wikilink">Great American Country</a> aired a one-hour special, &quot;Alison Krauss: A Hundred Miles or More&quot; based on the album and featured many of the album's duets and solo performances.</p>
<p>Other soundtracks for which Krauss has performed include <em><a href="Twister_(1996_film)" title="wikilink">Twister</a></em>, <em><a href="The_Prince_of_Egypt" title="wikilink">The Prince of Egypt</a></em>, <em><a href="Eight_Crazy_Nights" title="wikilink">Eight Crazy Nights</a></em>, <em><a href="Mona_Lisa_Smile" title="wikilink">Mona Lisa Smile</a></em>, <em><a href="Divine_Secrets_of_the_Ya-Ya_Sisterhood_(film)" title="wikilink">Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood</a></em>, <em><a href="Alias_(TV_series)" title="wikilink">Alias</a></em>, <em><a href="Bambi_II" title="wikilink">Bambi II</a></em> and <em><a href="Cold_Mountain_(film)" title="wikilink">Cold Mountain</a></em>. She also contributed the song &quot;Jubilee&quot; to the 2004 documentary <em><a href="Paper_Clips_Project" title="wikilink">Paper Clips</a></em>. The <em>Cold Mountain</em> songs &quot;The Scarlet Tide&quot; by <a href="T-Bone_Burnett" title="wikilink">T-Bone Burnett</a> and <a href="Elvis_Costello" title="wikilink">Elvis Costello</a>, and &quot;<a href="You_Will_Be_My_Ain_True_Love" title="wikilink">You Will Be My Ain True Love</a>&quot;, by herself and <a href="Sting_(musician)" title="wikilink">Sting</a> were nominated for an <a href="Academy_Awards" title="wikilink">Academy Award</a>, and she performed both songs at the <a href="76th_Academy_Awards" title="wikilink">76th Academy Awards</a>, the first one with Costello and Burnett and the other with <a href="Sting_(musician)" title="wikilink">Sting</a>.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> She also worked as a producer for <a href="Nickel_Creek" title="wikilink">Nickel Creek</a> on their debut <a href="Nickel_Creek_(album)" title="wikilink">self-titled album</a> in 2000 and the follow-up <em><a href="This_Side" title="wikilink">This Side</a></em> in 2002, which won Krauss her first Grammy as a <a href="music_producer" title="wikilink">music producer</a>.</p>
<h2 id="reception-and-influences">Reception and influences</h2>
<p>Krauss's earliest musical experience was as an instrumentalist, though her style has grown to focus more on her vocals<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> with a band providing most of the instrumentation. Musicians she enjoys include <a href="Lou_Gramm" title="wikilink">Lou Gramm</a> of <a href="Foreigner_(band)" title="wikilink">Foreigner</a> and <a href="Paul_Rodgers" title="wikilink">Paul Rodgers</a> of <a href="Bad_Company" title="wikilink">Bad Company</a>.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a><a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a><a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> Krauss' family listened to &quot;folk records&quot; while she was growing up, but she had friends who exposed her to groups such as <a href="AC/DC" class="uri" title="wikilink">AC/DC</a>, <a href="Carly_Simon" title="wikilink">Carly Simon</a>, <a href="The_Rolling_Stones" title="wikilink">The Rolling Stones</a>, <a href="Lynyrd_Skynyrd" title="wikilink">Lynyrd Skynyrd</a>, and <a href="Electric_Light_Orchestra" title="wikilink">ELO</a>.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> She cites <a href="Dolly_Parton" title="wikilink">Dolly Parton</a>, with whom she has since collaborated a number of times, as a major influence.

<p>Krauss generally sings as a <a href="soprano" class="uri" title="wikilink">soprano</a> with little to no vibrato: her clear vocals have been described as &quot;angelic&quot;.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> She has said her musical influences include <a href="J._D._Crowe" title="wikilink">J.

<p><img src="AKUS_Goodbye_is_All_We_Have.jpg" title="fig:The video for &quot;Goodbye is All We Have&quot; shows the group traveling, meeting at a crossroads, playing the song, and walking away together. " alt="The video for &quot;Goodbye is All We Have&quot; shows the group traveling, meeting at a crossroads, playing the song, and walking away together. " width="200" /> Krauss did not think she would make <a href="music_video" title="wikilink">music videos</a> at the beginning of her career, and after recording her first she was convinced it was so bad that she would never do another. Nonetheless, she has gone on to make further videos. Many of the first videos she saw were by bluegrass artists, although <a href="Dan_Tyminski" title="wikilink">Dan Tyminski</a> has noted that the <a href="Thriller_(music_video)" title="wikilink">video for <em>Thriller</em></a> was very popular at the time she was first exposed to music videos. She has made suggestions on the style or theme to some videos, though she tends to leave such decisions up to the <a href="music_video_director" title="wikilink">director</a> of the particular video. The group chooses directors by seeking out people who have previously directed videos bandmembers have enjoyed. The director for a video to &quot;If I Didn't Know Any Better&quot; from <em>Lonely Runs Both Ways</em>, for example, was selected because Krauss enjoyed work he had done with <a href="Def_Leppard" title="wikilink">Def Leppard</a>, and she wondered what he could do with their music. While style decisions are generally left to the various directors of the videos, many —including for &quot;Restless&quot;, &quot;Goodbye is All We Have&quot;, &quot;New Favorite&quot;, and &quot;If I Didn't Know Any Better&quot;—follow a pattern. In all of these videos Krauss walks, sometimes interacting with other people, while the rest of the band follows her.<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a><a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="performances">Performances</h3>
<p>Krauss has said she used to dislike working in the <a href="recording_studio" title="wikilink">studio</a> where she had to play the same song repeatedly, but has come to like studio work roughly the same as <a href="concert" title="wikilink">live stage performances</a>.

<p>At the <a href="76th_Academy_Awards" title="wikilink">76th Academy Awards</a> in February 2004, where she performed two nominated songs from the <em><a href="Cold_Mountain_(film)" title="wikilink">Cold Mountain</a></em> soundtrack, Alison Krauss was chosen by Hollywood shoe designer <a href="Stuart_Weitzman" title="wikilink">Stuart Weitzman</a> to wear a pair of $2 million 'Cinderella' sandals with 4&lt;U+00BD&gt; inch clear glass stiletto heels and two straps adorned with 565 Kwiat diamonds set in platinum. Feeling like a rather unglamorous choice, Krauss said, &quot;When I first heard, I was like, 'What were they thinking?' I have the worst feet of anybody who will be there that night!&quot; In addition to the fairy-tale-inspired shoes, Weitzman outfitted Krauss with a <a href="Palm_Tr&lt;U+0113&gt;o" title="wikilink">Palm Tr&lt;U+0113&gt;o</a> 600 smartphone, bejeweled with 3,000 clear-and-topaz-colored <a href="Swarovski" class="uri" title="wikilink">Swarovski</a> crystals. The shoes were returned, but Krauss kept the crystal-covered phone. Weitzman chose Krauss to show off his fashions at the urging of his daughters, who are fans of Krauss' music.<a href="#fn75" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref75"><sup>75</sup></a><a href="#fn76" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref76"><sup>76</sup></a></p>
