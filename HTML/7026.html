<h3 id="background">Background</h3>
<p>Early years of Faramir's life are described in the main narrative of <em>The Lord of the Rings</em> only passingly, with more detail revealed in the appendices. It is stated that Faramir was born in the year 2983 of the <a href="Third_Age" title="wikilink">Third Age</a>; his father, Denethor II, was a man of noble descent and the heir to the <a href="Stewards_of_Gondor" title="wikilink">Stewardship of Gondor</a>, ascending a year after Faramir's birth.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> Denethor had married <a href="Finduilas_of_Dol_Amroth" title="wikilink">Finduilas</a>, daughter of Prince <a href="Adrahil" class="uri" title="wikilink">Adrahil</a> of <a href="Dol_Amroth" title="wikilink">Dol Amroth</a>;<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> however, she died untimely when Faramir was five, and is said to have remained to him &quot;but a memory of loveliness in far days and of his first grief&quot;.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p>After her death Denethor became sombre, cold, and detached from his family, but the relationship between Faramir and <a href="Boromir" class="uri" title="wikilink">Boromir</a>, who was five years older, only grew closer. The brothers greatly loved and highly esteemed each other, and neither in childhood nor in later years was there any jealousy or rivalry between them, even though Denethor openly favoured his elder son. With a &quot;bossy&quot; brother and a stern father whose great force of character and status as a chief N&lt;U+00FA&gt;men&lt;U+00F3&gt;rean daunted Faramir, Tolkien describes that Faramir was used to giving way and not airing his own opinions.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> Among other things, Faramir displeased his father in that he welcomed the <a href="Wizard_(Middle-earth)" title="wikilink">wizard</a> <a href="Gandalf" class="uri" title="wikilink">Gandalf</a> who occasionally visited <a href="Minas_Tirith" title="wikilink">Minas Tirith</a>, the capital of Gondor. Being eager for knowledge, Faramir learned much from Gandalf about the history of the realm and about the death of <a href="Isildur" class="uri" title="wikilink">Isildur</a>.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a><a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<p>Gondor had long been threatened by the nearby realm of <a href="Mordor" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mordor</a>, and in 3018 the Dark Lord <a href="Sauron" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sauron</a> began the <a href="War_of_the_Ring" title="wikilink">War of the Ring</a>, attacking the ruined city of <a href="Osgiliath" class="uri" title="wikilink">Osgiliath</a> that guarded the passage to Minas Tirith.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> Faramir and Boromir commanded the defence, and were among those few who survived when the eastern half of Osgiliath was captured and the bridges across the <a href="River_Anduin" title="wikilink">River Anduin</a> were destroyed.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<p>In <em>The Fellowship of the Ring</em> it is recounted that shortly before the battle Faramir had a prophetic dream, which later often recurred to him and once to Boromir. In this dream a voice spoke about a <a href="Council_of_Elrond" title="wikilink">council</a> that was to be held at <a href="Rivendell" title="wikilink">Imladris</a> far to the north, about the awakening of &quot;Isildur's Bane&quot;, approaching of &quot;Doom&quot;, and appearance of &quot;the Halfling&quot;. Faramir decided to journey to Imladris and seek advice of <a href="Elrond" class="uri" title="wikilink">Elrond</a> the <a href="Half-elven" class="uri" title="wikilink">Half-elven</a>, but Boromir claimed the errand for himself, fearing for his brother, and was approved by Denethor and a council of the elders; Faramir remained to defend Gondor.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a><a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>

<p><img src="FaramirTrial.jpg" title="fig:Anke Ei&lt;U+00DF&gt;mann&#39;s portrayal of Faramir interrogating Frodo." alt="Anke Ei&lt;U+00DF&gt;mann&#39;s portrayal of Faramir interrogating Frodo." width="230" />Faramir first encountered the <a href="Hobbits" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hobbits</a> <a href="Frodo_Baggins" title="wikilink">Frodo Baggins</a> and <a href="Samwise_Gamgee" title="wikilink">Samwise Gamgee</a> in <a href="Ithilien" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ithilien</a> and recognized them to be the Halflings mentioned in his dreams. Faramir questioned Frodo of his quest, and Frodo revealed that he, along with eight other companions, had set out from Rivendell. During the interrogation, Faramir asked often about Boromir.</p>
<p>One night, while on guard, Faramir waded down to the <a href="Anduin" class="uri" title="wikilink">Anduin</a> river after seeing a boat there. It contained the dead body of his brother, who had been killed by <a href="Orc_(Middle-earth)" title="wikilink">Orcs</a>.</p>
<p>Faramir also asked about the <a href="One_Ring" title="wikilink">One Ring</a>, but Frodo tried to avoid the subject. Faramir determined that Frodo was carrying one of <a href="Sauron" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sauron</a>'s great weapons. At this point, he showed the crucial difference between him and his proud brother:</p>

<p>In the Rangers&lt;U+2019&gt; secret refuge behind the waterfall, <a href="Henneth_Ann&lt;U+00FB&gt;n" title="wikilink">Henneth Ann&lt;U+00FB&gt;n</a>, Sam accidentally spoke of Boromir&lt;U+2019&gt;s desire for the One Ring, thus revealing the item Frodo was carrying. Despite the Hobbits&lt;U+2019&gt; fears, Faramir was wise enough to realize that such a weapon was not to be used and if desired, should be resisted. With this knowledge, he also realized what his brother had to face, and wished that he had gone on the quest himself &lt;U+2014&gt; knowing that Boromir would not have been able to resist the temptation to seize the Ring for himself. Giving them provisions, he sent them on their way to continue their quest, but warned Frodo that their guide, <a href="Gollum" class="uri" title="wikilink">Gollum</a>, was a treacherous creature, and that an unknown terror lived in <a href="Cirith_Ungol" title="wikilink">Cirith Ungol</a>, where Gollum was leading them.</p>
<h4 id="the-return-of-the-king"><em>The Return of the King</em></h4>
<p>The following evening in <a href="Cair_Andros" title="wikilink">Cair Andros</a>, Faramir sent his company south to reinforce the garrison at <a href="Osgiliath" class="uri" title="wikilink">Osgiliath</a>, while he and three of his men rode to Minas Tirith. Along the way, they were pursued by Sauron's servants, the <a href="Nazg&lt;U+00FB&gt;l" class="uri" title="wikilink">Nazg&lt;U+00FB&gt;l</a>. Faramir rode back to help the fallen. Immediately, Gandalf rode out to their aid, temporarily banishing the Nazg&lt;U+00FB&gt;l.</p>
<p>Faramir arrived at Minas Tirith and reported to Denethor and Gandalf of his encounter with Frodo and Sam. Denethor became angry that Faramir had let Frodo and Sam pass into Mordor with the Ring, instead of bringing the Ring to Minas Tirith to be hidden.</p>
<p>Sauron's second-in-command, the <a href="Witch-king_of_Angmar" title="wikilink">Witch-king of Angmar</a>, led a much larger force from <a href="Minas_Morgul" title="wikilink">Minas Morgul</a>, and attacked Osgiliath. After Osgiliath was conquered, Faramir decided to stay with the rearguard in order to make sure that the retreat over <a href="Pelennor" class="uri" title="wikilink">Pelennor</a> would not turn into a rout. He was gravely wounded by a <a href="Southron" class="uri" title="wikilink">Southron</a> arrow and the <a href="Black_Breath" title="wikilink">Black Breath</a> of the Nazg&lt;U+00FB&gt;l. Fortunately, all of the mounted soldiers in the city rode to his aid and brought him back to Denethor in Minas Tirith.</p>
<p>When Faramir returned unconscious, Denethor believed him to be fatally injured. That blow, coupled with a vision in the <em><a href="palant&lt;U+00ED&gt;r" class="uri" title="wikilink">palant&lt;U+00ED&gt;r</a></em> of the forces arrayed against him, caused him to lose his mind. He ordered his servants to build a funeral pyre in the House of Stewards for him and his son. Denethor's temporary Hobbit servant, <a href="Peregrin_Took" title="wikilink">Peregrin Took</a>, went to alert Gandalf and <a href="Beregond" class="uri" title="wikilink">Beregond</a>, one of the Tower Guards he had befriended. Gandalf and Beregond stopped the impending sacrifice just in time. Mad with grief, Denethor jumped onto the lit pyre, burning himself alive.</p>
<p>Two days later, the battle over, <a href="Aragorn" class="uri" title="wikilink">Aragorn</a> came and revived Faramir with <em><a href="athelas" class="uri" title="wikilink">athelas</a></em> in the <a href="Houses_of_Healing" title="wikilink">Houses of Healing</a>. During his subsequent recuperation there, Faramir met the Lady <a href="&lt;U+00C9&gt;owyn" class="uri" title="wikilink">&lt;U+00C9&gt;owyn</a> of <a href="Rohan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Rohan</a>; moved by her sorrow, pride, and beauty, he eventually fell in love with her. At first, &lt;U+00C9&gt;owyn refused his advances, only desiring to go to war to find honour in death. But soon &lt;U+00C9&gt;owyn realized that she had come to love him in return.</p>
<p>Faramir briefly served as a Ruling Steward, and began preparing the city for the arrival of Aragorn, who was now King of Gondor. On the day of the King&lt;U+2019&gt;s official coronation, Faramir surrendered his office. Aragorn, however, announced that as long as his line would last, Faramir and his descendants would be Stewards of Gondor.</p>
<p>In addition, Aragorn appointed Faramir as the Prince of Ithilien and Beregond to be the Captain of his guard, the White Company. As Prince of Ithilien, he and the Prince of Dol Amroth became King Elessar's chief commanders. In a draft to a reader of <em>The Lord of the Rings</em>, J. R. R. Tolkien writes that as Prince of Ithilien, Faramir's duties also included acting as resident march-warden of Gondor's main eastward outpost, rehabilitating the lost territories, as well as clearing it of outlaws and <a href="Orc_(Middle-earth)" title="wikilink">Orcs</a> and cleansing Minas Morgul (an old Gondorian City that Sauron had taken once named <a href="Minas_Ithil" title="wikilink">Minas Ithil</a>) of evil remnants.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> Faramir also fulfilled the traditional role as Steward, acting as the King&lt;U+2019&gt;s chief counsellor and ruling Gondor in his absence.</p>
<p>With &lt;U+00C9&gt;owyn, he settled in <a href="Emyn_Arnen" title="wikilink">Emyn Arnen</a>, where the two had a son named <em>Elboron</em>. After Faramir&lt;U+2019&gt;s death at the age of 120, his son succeeded him in all of his titles. <em>Barahir</em>, Faramir's grandson, wrote <em><a href="The_Tale_of_Aragorn_and_Arwen" title="wikilink">The Tale of Aragorn and Arwen</a></em>, which was inserted (in an abbreviated form) in the <em><a href="Red_Book_of_Westmarch" title="wikilink">Thain's Book</a></em> by the writer Findegil,<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> and appears in <em>The Lord of the Rings</em> as part of Appendix A. Barahir may have been the son of Elboron, but nothing directly indicates this conclusion.</p>
<h3 id="characteristics">Characteristics</h3>
<p>Faramir's personality is prominently described in the appendices to <em>The Lord of the Rings</em>: </p>
<p>Tolkien recorded that Faramir greatly resembled Boromir in appearance,<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a><a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> who in his turn is described as &quot;a tall man with a fair and noble face, dark-haired and grey-eyed, proud and stern of glance&quot;.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> Members of the line of the Stewards were wont to be of a nobler appearance and bearing than most of the inhabitants of Gondor;<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> in case of Faramir, it is stated that &quot;by some chance the blood of <a href="N&lt;U+00FA&gt;menor" title="wikilink">Westernesse</a> [ran] nearly true&quot; in him, which was rare.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> This trait was elaborated by Tolkien through the speech of Pippin: </p>
<p>Faramir&lt;U+2019&gt;s leadership, skill-in-arms, and swift but hardy judgement proved valuable in battle, and earned him Gondor's respect during the War of the Ring.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> He defended Gondor from Sauron on many fronts, but did not enjoy fighting for its own sake.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> Long after completing <em>The Lord of the Rings</em>, Tolkien would write, &quot;As far as any character is 'like me', it is Faramir&quot;.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> Faramir's relationship to war in Tolkien's story reflected that of the author himself, who was a soldier in <a href="World_War_I" title="wikilink">World War I</a> and fought in the <a href="Battle_of_the_Somme_(1916)" title="wikilink">Battle of the Somme</a>.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a></p>
<p>Tolkien bestowed his dream of &quot;darkness unescapable&quot; upon Faramir's character, who relates it to &lt;U+00C9&gt;owyn in the fifth chapter of <em>The Return of the King</em>. Of this, Tolkien wrote, &quot;For when Faramir speaks of his private vision of the Great Wave, he speaks for me. That vision and dream has been ever with me &lt;U+2014&gt; and has been inherited (as I only discovered recently) by one of my children, Michael.&quot;<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="names-and-titles">Names and titles</h3>
<p>The meaning of the name <em>Faramir</em> was not explained by Tolkien; apparently he intended it to come from <a href="Sindarin" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sindarin</a>, an Elven language constructed by him and stated to have been used by the Stewards of Gondor for naming.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> The first part of <em>Faramir</em> could have been derived from Sindarin stems meaning 'suffice' and 'hunt',<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> and the final syllable is likely to have been the same as in his brother's name.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> <em>Boromir</em> was described by Tolkien as a name &quot;of mixed form&quot;,<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> and possibly combines Sindarin <em>bor(on)-</em> 'steadfast' with either Sindarin <em>m&lt;U+00EE&gt;r</em> or <a href="Quenya" class="uri" title="wikilink">Quenya</a> <em>m&lt;U+00ED&gt;re</em> 'jewel'.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> However, it is also stated that the Stewards of Gondor often bore names &quot;remembered in the songs and histories of the <a href="First_Age" title="wikilink">First Age</a>&quot;,<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> without paying a special attention to meaning. Thus one <a href="Boromir_(House_of_B&lt;U+00EB&gt;or)" title="wikilink">Boromir</a> appears in <em><a href="The_Silmarillion" title="wikilink">The Silmarillion</a></em>,<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> and the appendices to <em>The Lord of the Rings</em> introduce <a href="Faramir_(House_of_An&lt;U+00E1&gt;rion)" title="wikilink">Faramir</a>, son of King <a href="Ondoher" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ondoher</a> of Gondor,<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> although in this case the name was supposedly in Quenya, as the Kings are stated to have borne High-elven names,<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> and similarly did Ondoher's elder son, Artamir.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a></p>
<p>Throughout <em>The Lord of the Rings</em>, Faramir is given several titles and ranks, such as the <strong>Captain of Gondor</strong><a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> and <strong>Captain of the White Tower</strong>.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> (Boromir is given the latter title at an earlier point in the storyline,<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> and in <em>The Two Towers</em> he is referred to as Captain-General of Gondor and High Warden of the White Tower.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a>) After his father's death, Faramir became the Steward of Gondor,<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a><a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> but only briefly as he laid down his office at the crowning of Aragorn;<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> Tolkien stated that it was Denethor who was the last of the <em>Ruling</em> Stewards.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> Later Aragorn renewed Faramir's hereditary appointment as <strong>Steward to the King</strong>, and granted him the titles of the <strong>Prince of Ithilien</strong> and <strong>Lord of Emyn Arnen</strong>.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a><a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="concept-and-creation">Concept and creation</h2>
<p>The speed of the relationship of Faramir and &lt;U+00C9&gt;owyn reflects a culture which Tolkien describes to be &quot;less corrupt&quot;, and nobler in which the &quot;petty fencing and approaches&quot; of <a href="courtly_love" title="wikilink">courtly love</a> is disregarded.<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> A factor in the development of their love came from Tolkien's personal belief that feelings grew quickly in periods of great stress and under the expectation of death.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a> Originally, Tolkien employed the use of <em><a href="thou" class="uri" title="wikilink">thou</a></em> and <em>thee</em> in <em>The Lord of the Rings</em> to show a &quot;deliberate change to a form of affection or endearment&quot;.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a> His son has presented the original drafts for the chapter &quot;The Steward and the King&quot;, in which such usage was employed to emphasize the relationship's development:</p>

<p>The plot of the second film, <em><a href="The_Lord_of_the_Rings:_The_Two_Towers_(film)" title="wikilink">The Two Towers</a></em>, introduces a significant deviation from the book: Faramir does not at first let Frodo, Sam, and Gollum go, but decides to bring them and the Ring to Gondor. He takes them to Osgiliath and not until the Nazg&lt;U+00FB&gt;l attack the city and Frodo comes under the threat of capture does he release them. This change received some criticism, and the character in the film was jokingly dubbed &quot;Filmamir&quot; or &quot;Farfromthebookamir&quot;, among other names.<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a></p>
<p>Jackson's explanation is that he needed another adventure to delay Frodo and Sam, because the episode at Cirith Ungol was moved to the third movie, and so a new <a href="climax_(narrative)" title="wikilink">climax</a> was needed.<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a> In fact, according to the timeline given by Tolkien, Frodo and Sam had only reached the <a href="Black_Gate_(Middle-earth)" title="wikilink">Black Gate</a> at the time of the fall of <a href="Isengard" class="uri" title="wikilink">Isengard</a>.<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a> Jackson also argues that it was necessary for Faramir to be tempted by the Ring because in his films everyone else was tempted, and letting Faramir be immune would be inconsistent in the eyes of a film audience.<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a> Co-screenwriter Philippa Boyens and actor David Wenham defended the changes to Faramir's character in order to increase dramatic tension: Faramir's &quot;sea-green incorruptible&quot; nature in the book would not have &quot;[translated] well filmically&quot;.<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a> Wenham (who had not read the book until after filming had commenced) also found Tolkien's original &quot;dramatically dead&quot;.<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a></p>
<p>Some fans remain unconvinced by the cast and crew's justifications,<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a> and others note that Faramir was rendered too much like Boromir and thus the contrast between the two was severely weakened.<a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a> A scene that received additional criticism is the Rangers' treatment of Gollum, who is beaten up, and Faramir's implicit compliance.<a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a><a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a> In the book, Faramir called the creature <em>Sm&lt;U+00E9&gt;agol</em> instead of <em>Gollum</em>, and told his men to &quot;treat him gently, but watch him&quot;.<a href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a></p>
<p>In the extended edition of <em>The Two Towers</em>, Jackson included an invented flashback scene showing that Denethor had neglected him in favour of Boromir when sending him to Rivendell, so that Faramir wanted to please his father by bringing him the Ring. (The relationship is similarly strained in the book, but his father's favouritism does not seem to affect his decisions in Ithilien.) Reviewers have opined that the extended edition presents Faramir in a more favourable light.<a href="#fn67" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a><a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="video-games">Video games</h3>
<p>Faramir is a bonus playable character in the video game <em><a href="The_Lord_of_the_Rings:_The_Return_of_the_King_(video_game)" title="wikilink">The Return of the King</a></em>. In a bonus video track within this game, Wenham says that &quot;Faramir and Boromir were brothers, and it isn't beyond possibility that Faramir would have gone to Rivendell instead. And if that happened, Faramir would have survived and returned to Gondor.&quot;<a href="#fn69" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref69"><sup>69</sup></a></p>
<p>He also appears as a playable hero in E.A.'s <a href="The_Lord_of_the_Rings:_The_Battle_for_Middle-earth" title="wikilink">The Battle for Middle-earth</a>, and <a href="The_Lord_of_the_Rings:_The_Battle_for_Middle-earth_II" title="wikilink">The Battle for Middle-earth II</a> as well as its expansion pack, <a href="The_Lord_of_the_Rings:_The_Battle_for_Middle-earth_II:_The_Rise_of_the_Witch-king" title="wikilink">The Rise of the Witch-king</a>. Faramir has the unique ability within the game to change between 3 different classes, at the beginning of battle Faramir is set as an Archer but can be changed to use his sword for melee combat and can change to a rider for cavalry assaults. While in archer form he has reasonable attack strength but lacks the speed of Legolas. Faramir has the ability to raise the experience of a select group of archers once he reaches a certain level.</p>
<p>Faramir appears as a playable hero in <a href="The_Lord_of_the_Rings:_Conquest" title="wikilink">The Lord of the Rings: Conquest</a>. Faramir can be controlled in the Osgiliath level were you need to defend the city against battalions of orcs and afterwards defend the ring bearer Frodo until he reaches the city limits.</p>
<p>He also makes a guest hero appearance twice in <a href="The_Lord_of_the_Rings:_The_Third_Age" title="wikilink">The Lord of the Rings: The Third Age</a>. As with Conquest Faramir appears to help you during the Osgiliath level and helps the party take on the Orc leader <a href="Gothmog_(Third_Age)" title="wikilink">Gothmog</a></p>
