<p><strong>Van Morrison</strong>, <a href="Order_of_the_British_Empire" title="wikilink">OBE</a> (born <strong>George Ivan Morrison</strong>; 31 August 1945) is a <a href="Northern_Ireland" title="wikilink">Northern Irish</a> singer-songwriter and musician. His live performances at their best are regarded as transcendental<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a><a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> and inspired;<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> while some of his recordings, such as the studio albums <em><a href="Astral_Weeks" title="wikilink">Astral Weeks</a></em> and <em><a href="Moondance" class="uri" title="wikilink">Moondance</a></em>, and the live album <em><a href="It&#39;s_Too_Late_to_Stop_Now" title="wikilink">It's Too Late to Stop Now</a></em>, are widely viewed as among the greatest ever made.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a><a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a><a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p>Known as &quot;Van the Man&quot; to his fans,<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> Morrison started his professional career when, as a teenager in the late 1950s, he played a variety of instruments including guitar, harmonica, keyboards and saxophone in a range of <a href="Irish_showbands" title="wikilink">Irish showbands</a> who covered the popular hits of the day before rising to prominence in the mid-1960s as the <a href="lead_vocalist" title="wikilink">lead singer</a> of the gritty Northern Irish R&amp;B band <a href="Them_(band)" title="wikilink">Them</a> with whom he recorded the <a href="garage_band" title="wikilink">garage band</a> classic, &quot;<a href="Gloria_(Them_song)" title="wikilink">Gloria</a>&quot;. His solo career began under the <a href="pop_music" title="wikilink">pop</a>-hit oriented guidance of <a href="Bert_Berns" title="wikilink">Bert Berns</a> with the release of the hit single &quot;<a href="Brown_Eyed_Girl" title="wikilink">Brown Eyed Girl</a>&quot; in 1967. After Berns' death, <a href="Warner_Bros._Records" title="wikilink">Warner Bros. Records</a> bought out his contract and allowed him three sessions to record <em>Astral Weeks</em> in 1968.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> Even though this album would gradually garner high praise, it was initially poorly received; however, the next one, <em>Moondance</em>, established Morrison as a major artist,<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> and throughout the 1970s he built on his reputation with a series of critically acclaimed albums and live performances. Morrison continues to record and tour, producing albums and live performances that sell well and are generally warmly received, sometimes collaborating with other artists, such as <a href="Georgie_Fame" title="wikilink">Georgie Fame</a> and <a href="The_Chieftains" title="wikilink">The Chieftains</a>. In 2008 he performed <em>Astral Weeks</em> live for the first time since 1968.</p>
<p>Much of Morrison's music is structured around the conventions of <a href="soul_music" title="wikilink">soul music</a> and <a href="R&amp;B" class="uri" title="wikilink">R&amp;B</a>, such as the popular singles, &quot;Brown Eyed Girl&quot;, &quot;<a href="Jackie_Wilson_Said_(I&#39;m_in_Heaven_When_You_Smile)" title="wikilink">Jackie Wilson Said (I'm in Heaven When You Smile)</a>&quot;, &quot;<a href="Domino_(Van_Morrison_song)" title="wikilink">Domino</a>&quot; and &quot;<a href="Wild_Night" title="wikilink">Wild Night</a>&quot;. An equal part of his catalogue consists of lengthy, loosely connected, spiritually inspired musical journeys that show the influence of Celtic tradition, jazz, and <a href="Stream_of_consciousness_(narrative_mode)" title="wikilink">stream-of-consciousness</a> narrative, such as <em>Astral Weeks</em> and lesser-known works such as <em><a href="Veedon_Fleece" title="wikilink">Veedon Fleece</a></em> and <em><a href="Common_One" title="wikilink">Common One</a></em>.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a><a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> The two strains together are sometimes referred to as &quot;Celtic Soul&quot;.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<p>Morrison has received considerable acclaim, including six <a href="Grammy_Award" title="wikilink">Grammy Awards</a>, being inducted into both the <a href="Rock_and_Roll_Hall_of_Fame" title="wikilink">Rock and Roll Hall of Fame</a> and the <a href="Songwriters_Hall_of_Fame" title="wikilink">Songwriters Hall of Fame</a>, and appearing on several &quot;Greatest Artists&quot; lists.</p>

<p>Morrison's father bought him his first acoustic guitar when he was eleven, and he learned to play rudimentary <a href="chord_(music)" title="wikilink">chords</a> from the song book, <em>The <a href="Carter_Family" title="wikilink">Carter Family</a> Style</em>, edited by <a href="Alan_Lomax" title="wikilink">Alan Lomax</a>.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> A year later, when he was twelve years old, Morrison formed his first band,<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> a skiffle group, &quot;The Sputniks&quot;, named after the recently launched Soviet satellite, <a href="Sputnik_1" title="wikilink">Sputnik 1</a>.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> In 1958, the band played at some of the local cinemas, and Morrison took the lead, contributing most of the singing and arranging. Other short-lived groups followed &lt;U+2013&gt; at fourteen, he formed Midnight Special, another modified skiffle band and played at a school concert.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> Then, when he heard <a href="Jimmy_Giuffre" title="wikilink">Jimmy Giuffre</a> playing saxophone on &quot;The Train and The River&quot;, he talked his father into buying him a saxophone,<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> and took lessons in tenor sax and music reading.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> Now playing the saxophone, Morrison joined with various local bands, including one called Deanie Sands and the Javelins, with whom he played guitar and shared singing.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> Later the four main musicians of the Javelins, with the addition of Wesley Black as keyboard player, became known as the Monarchs.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a></p>
<p>Morrison attended <a href="Orangefield_High_School" title="wikilink">Orangefield High School</a>, leaving in July 1960 with no qualifications.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> As a member of a working-class community, it was expected that he would get a regular full-time job,<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> so after several short apprenticeship positions, he settled into a job as a <a href="window_cleaner" title="wikilink">window cleaner</a>&lt;U+2014&gt; later alluded to in his songs, &quot;<a href="Cleaning_Windows" title="wikilink">Cleaning Windows</a>&quot; and &quot;<a href="Saint_Dominic&#39;s_Preview_(song)" title="wikilink">Saint Dominic's Preview</a>&quot;.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> However, he had been developing his musical interests from an early age and continued playing with the Monarchs part-time. Young Morrison also played with the Harry Mack Showband, the Great Eight, with his older workplace friend, Geordie Sproule whom he later named as one of his biggest influences.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a></p>
<p>At age 17, he toured Europe for the first time with the Monarchs, now calling themselves the International Monarchs. This <a href="Irish_showband" title="wikilink">Irish showband</a>,<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> with Morrison playing saxophone, guitar and harp, in addition to back-up duty on bass and drums, toured steamy clubs and US Army bases in Scotland, England, and Germany, often playing five sets a night.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> While in Germany, the band recorded a single, &quot;Boozoo Hully Gully&quot;/&quot;Twingy Baby&quot;, under the name Georgie and The Monarchs. This was Morrison's first recording, taking place in November 1963 at Ariola Studios in Cologne with Morrison on saxophone; it made the lower reaches of the German charts.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a><a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a></p>
<p>Upon returning to Belfast in November 1963, the group disbanded,<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> so Morrison connected with Geordie Sproule again and played with him in the Manhattan Showband along with guitarist Herbie Armstrong. When Armstrong auditioned to play with Brian Rossi and the Golden Eagles, Morrison went along and was hired as a blues singer.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="them-1964u201366">Them: 1964&lt;U+2013&gt;66</h2>

<p>The roots of Them, the band that first broke Morrison on the international scene, came in April 1964 when Morrison responded to an advert for musicians to play at a new <a href="Rhythm_and_blues" title="wikilink">R&amp;B</a> club at the Maritime Hotel &lt;U+2013&gt; an old dance hall frequented by sailors.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> The new R&amp;B club needed a band for its opening night; however, Morrison had left the Golden Eagles (the group with which he had been performing at the time), so he created a new band out of The Gamblers, an <a href="Belfast_East_(UK_Parliament_constituency)" title="wikilink">East Belfast</a> group formed by Ronnie Millings, Billy Harrison, and Alan Henderson in 1962.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a><a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> Eric Wrixon, still a schoolboy, was the piano player and <a href="keyboardist" class="uri" title="wikilink">keyboardist</a>.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a> Morrison played saxophone and harmonica and shared vocals with Billy Harrison. They followed Eric Wrixon's suggestion for a new name, and The Gamblers morphed into <a href="Them_(band)" title="wikilink">Them</a>, their name taken from the Fifties horror movie <em><a href="Them!" class="uri" title="wikilink">Them!</a></em>.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a></p>
<p>The band's strong R&amp;B performances at the Maritime attracted attention. Them performed without a routine and Morrison <a href="ad_lib" title="wikilink">ad libbed</a>, creating his songs live as he performed.<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a> While the band did covers, they also played some of Morrison's early songs, such as &quot;Could You Would You&quot;, which he had written in <a href="Camden_Town" title="wikilink">Camden Town</a> while touring with The Manhattan Showband.<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a> The debut of Morrison's &quot;Gloria&quot; took place on stage here. Sometimes, depending on his mood, the song could last up to twenty minutes. Morrison has stated that &quot;Them lived and died on the stage at the Maritime Hotel,&quot; believing that the band did not manage to capture the spontaneity and energy of their live performances on their records.<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a> The statement also reflected the instability of the Them lineup, with numerous members passing through the ranks after the definitive Maritime period. Morrison and Henderson would remain the only constants, and a highly unsuccessful version of Them even soldiered on after Morrison's departure.<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a></p>
<p><a href="Dick_Rowe" title="wikilink">Dick Rowe</a> of <a href="Decca_Records" title="wikilink">Decca Records</a> became aware of the band's performances, and signed Them to a standard two-year contract. In that period, they released two albums and ten singles, with two more singles released after Morrison departed the band. They had three <a href="record_chart" title="wikilink">chart</a> hits, &quot;<a href="Baby,_Please_Don&#39;t_Go" title="wikilink">Baby, Please Don't Go</a>&quot; (1964), &quot;<a href="Here_Comes_the_Night_(Them_song)" title="wikilink">Here Comes the Night</a>&quot; (1965), and &quot;<a href="Mystic_Eyes" title="wikilink">Mystic Eyes</a>&quot; (1965),<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a> though it was the b-side of &quot;Baby, Please Don't Go&quot;, the <a href="garage_band" title="wikilink">garage band</a> classic, &quot;<a href="Gloria_(Them_song)" title="wikilink">Gloria</a>&quot;,<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a> that went on to become a rock standard covered by <a href="Patti_Smith" title="wikilink">Patti Smith</a>, <a href="The_Doors" title="wikilink">The Doors</a>, <a href="Shadows_of_Knight" title="wikilink">Shadows of Knight</a>, <a href="Jimi_Hendrix" title="wikilink">Jimi Hendrix</a> and others.<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a> </p>
<p>Building on the success of their singles in the United States, and riding on the back of the <a href="British_Invasion" title="wikilink">British Invasion</a>, Them undertook a two month tour of America in May and June 1966 that included a residency from 30 May to 18 June at the <a href="Whisky_a_Go_Go" title="wikilink">Whisky a Go Go</a> in Los Angeles.<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a> <a href="The_Doors" title="wikilink">The Doors</a> were the supporting act on the last week,<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a> and Morrison's influence on The Doors singer, <a href="Jim_Morrison" title="wikilink">Jim Morrison</a>, was noted by <a href="John_Densmore" title="wikilink">John Densmore</a> in his book <em>Riders On The Storm</em>. <a href="Brian_Hinton" title="wikilink">Brian Hinton</a> relates how &quot;Jim Morrison learned quickly from his near namesake's stagecraft, his apparent recklessness, his air of subdued menace, the way he would improvise poetry to a rock beat, even his habit of crouching down by the bass drum during instrumental breaks.&quot;<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a> On the final night, the two Morrisons and the two bands jammed together on &quot;Gloria&quot;.<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a><a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a><a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a></p>
<p>Toward the end of the tour the band members became involved in a dispute with their manager, Decca Records' Phil Solomon, over the revenues paid to the band; that, coupled with the expiry of their work visas, meant the band returned from America dejected. After two more concerts in Ireland, Them split up. Morrison concentrated on writing some of the songs that would appear on <em>Astral Weeks</em>, while the remnants of the band reformed in 1967 and relocated in America.<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a></p>

<p><a href="Bert_Berns" title="wikilink">Bert Berns</a>, Them&lt;U+2019&gt;s producer and composer of their 1965 hit, &quot;<a href="Here_Comes_the_Night_(Them_song)" title="wikilink">Here Comes the Night</a>&quot;, persuaded Morrison to return to New York to record solo for his new label, <a href="Bang_Records" title="wikilink">Bang Records</a>.<a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a> Morrison flew over and signed a contract he had not fully studied.<a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a> Then, during a two-day recording session at A &amp; R Studios starting 28 March 1967, eight songs were recorded originally intended to be used as four singles.<a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a> Instead, these songs were released as the album <em><a href="Blowin&#39;_Your_Mind!" title="wikilink">Blowin' Your Mind!</a></em> without Morrison being consulted. He said he only became aware of the album's release when a friend mentioned on a phone call that he had just bought a copy of it. He later commented to Donal Corvin in a 1973 interview: &quot;I wasn't really happy with it. He picked the bands and tunes. I had a different concept of it.&quot;<a href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a></p>
<p>However, from these early sessions, emerged &quot;<a href="Brown_Eyed_Girl" title="wikilink">Brown Eyed Girl</a>&quot;. Captured on the 22nd take on the first day,<a href="#fn67" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a> this song was released as a single in mid-June 1967,<a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a> reaching number ten in the US charts in 1967. &quot;Brown Eyed Girl&quot; became Morrison's most played song and over the years it has remained a classic; forty years later in 2007, it was the fourth most requested song of <a href="Disc_jockeys" title="wikilink">DJs</a> in the US.<a href="#fn69" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref69"><sup>69</sup></a></p>
<p>Following the death of Berns in 1967, Morrison became involved in a contract dispute with Berns' widow that prevented him from performing on stage or recording in the New York area.<a href="#fn70" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a> The song, &quot;Big Time Operators&quot;, released in 1993, is thought to allude to his dealings with the New York <a href="music_industry" title="wikilink">music business</a> during this time period.<a href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a> He then moved to <a href="Boston" title="wikilink">Boston, Massachusetts</a> and was soon confronted with personal and financial problems; he had &quot;slipped into a malaise&quot; and had trouble finding concert bookings.<a href="#fn72" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref72"><sup>72</sup></a> However, through the few gigs he could find, he regained his professional footing and started recording with the <a href="Warner_Bros._Records" title="wikilink">Warner Bros.

<p>During the 1990s, Morrison developed a close association with two vocal talents at opposite ends of their careers: <a href="Georgie_Fame" title="wikilink">Georgie Fame</a> (with whom Morrison had already worked occasionally) lent his voice and Hammond organ skills to Morrison's band; and <a href="Brian_Kennedy_(singer)" title="wikilink">Brian Kennedy</a>'s vocals complemented the grizzled voice of Morrison, both in studio and live performances.</p>
<p>The 1990s also saw an upsurge in collaborations by Morrison with other artists, a trend continuing into the new millennium.

<p>It is at the heart of Morrison&lt;U+2019&gt;s presence as a singer that when he lights on certain sounds, certain small moments inside a song&lt;U+2014&gt;hesitations, silences, shifts in pressure, sudden entrances, slamming doors&lt;U+2014&gt;can then suggest whole territories, completed stories, indistinct ceremonies, far outside anything that can be literally traced in the compositions that carry them.</p>

<p>As Morrison began live performances of the 40 year old album <em>Astral Weeks</em> in 2008, there were comparisons to his youthful voice of 1968.&lt;U+2014&gt;His early voice was described as &quot;flinty and tender, beseeching and plaintive&quot;.<a href="#fn250" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref250"><sup>250</sup></a> Forty years later, the difference in his vocal range and power were noticeable but reviewers and critic's comments were favourable: &quot;Morrison's voice has expanded to fill his frame; a deeper, louder roar than the blue-eyed soul voice of his youth &lt;U+2013&gt; softer on the diction &lt;U+2013&gt; but none the less impressively powerful.&quot;<a href="#fn251" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref251"><sup>251</sup></a> Morrison also commented on the changes in his approach to singing: &quot;The approach now is to sing from lower down [the diaphragm] so I do not ruin my voice.

<h3 id="songwriting-and-lyrics">Songwriting and lyrics</h3>
<p>Morrison has written hundreds of songs<a href="#fn253" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref253"><sup>253</sup></a><a href="#fn254" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref254"><sup>254</sup></a> during his career with a recurring theme reflecting a nostalgic yearning for the carefree days of his childhood in Belfast.<a href="#fn255" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref255"><sup>255</sup></a> Some of his song titles derive from familiar locations in his childhood such as: &quot;<a href="Cyprus_Avenue" title="wikilink">Cyprus Avenue</a>&quot; (a nearby street), &quot;<a href="Orangefield_(song)" title="wikilink">Orangefield</a>&quot; (the boys school he attended), &quot;On Hyndford Street&quot; (where he was born). Also frequently present in Morrison's best love songs is a blending of the sacred-profane as evidenced in &quot;<a href="Into_the_Mystic" title="wikilink">Into the Mystic</a>&quot; and &quot;So Quiet in Here&quot;.<a href="#fn256" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref256"><sup>256</sup></a><a href="#fn257" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref257"><sup>257</sup></a> Beginning with his 1979 album, <em><a href="Into_the_Music" title="wikilink">Into the Music</a></em> and the song &quot;<a href="And_the_Healing_Has_Begun" title="wikilink">And the Healing Has Begun</a>&quot;, a frequent theme of his music and lyrics has been based on his belief in the healing power of music combined with a form of <a href="mysticism" title="wikilink">mystic</a> <a href="Christianity" class="uri" title="wikilink">Christianity</a>.

<h3 id="performance-style">Performance style</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Van Morrison is interested, <em>obsessed</em> with how much musical or verbal information he can compress into a small space, and, almost, conversely, how far he can spread one note, word, sound, or picture. To capture one moment, be it a caress or a twitch. He repeats certain phrases to extremes that from anybody else would seem ridiculous, because he's waiting for a vision to unfold, trying as unobtrusively as possible to nudge it along...It's the great search, fueled by the belief that through these musical and mental processes illumination is attainable. Or may at least be glimpsed.&quot;</p>

<p>Critic <a href="Greil_Marcus" title="wikilink">Greil Marcus</a> argues that given the truly distinctive breadth and complexity of Morrison's work, it is almost impossible to cast his work among that of others: &quot;Morrison remains a singer who can be compared to no other in the history of rock &amp; roll, a singer who cannot be pinned down, dismissed, or fitted into anyone's expectations.&quot;<a href="#fn265" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref265"><sup>265</sup></a> Or in the words of <a href="Jay_Cocks" title="wikilink">Jay Cocks</a>: &quot;He extends himself only to express himself.

Although he freely crosses musical boundaries&lt;U+2014&gt;R. and B., Celtic melodies, jazz, rave-up rock, hymns, down-and-dirty blues&lt;U+2014&gt;he can unfailingly be found in the same strange place: on his own wavelength.&quot;<a href="#fn266" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref266"><sup>266</sup></a> His <a href="transcendence_(religion)" title="wikilink">transcendental</a> signature style came into full expression with his 1968 classic, <em><a href="Astral_Weeks" title="wikilink">Astral Weeks</a></em>. This musical art form was based on stream of consciousness songwriting and emotional vocalizing of lyrics that have no basis in normal structure or symmetry. His live performances are dependent on building dynamics with spontaniety between himself and his band, whom he controls with hand gestures throughout, sometimes signaling impromptu solos from a selected band member. The music and vocals build towards a hypnotic and trance-like state that depends on in-the-moment creativity.<a href="#fn267" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref267"><sup>267</sup></a> He has said he believes in the <a href="jazz" class="uri" title="wikilink">jazz</a> <a href="improvisational" class="uri" title="wikilink">improvisational</a> technique of never performing a song the same way twice and except for the unique rendition of the <em>Astral Weeks</em> songs live, doesn't perform a concert from a preconceived set list.<a href="#fn268" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref268"><sup>268</sup></a> Morrison has said he prefers to perform at smaller venues or symphony halls noted for their good <a href="acoustics" class="uri" title="wikilink">acoustics</a>.<a href="#fn269" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref269"><sup>269</sup></a> His ban against <a href="alcoholic_beverage" title="wikilink">alcoholic beverages</a>, which made entertainment news during 2008, was an attempt to prevent the disruptive and distracting movement of audience members leaving their seats during the performances.<a href="#fn270" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref270"><sup>270</sup></a> In a 2009 interview, Morrison stated: &quot;I do not consciously aim to take the listener anywhere.

Over the years he has recorded songs from a varying list of genres drawn from many influences and interests.

<p>Some of Morrison's music has been classified in a genre of its own and referred to as &quot;Celtic soul&quot;<a href="#fn274" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref274"><sup>274</sup></a> or what biographer Brian Hinton referred to as a new alchemy called &quot;Caledonian soul.&quot;<a href="#fn275" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref275"><sup>275</sup></a> Another biographer, <a href="Ritchie_Yorke" title="wikilink">Ritchie Yorke</a> quoted Morrison as believing that he has &quot;the spirit of Caledonia in his soul and his music reflects it.&quot;<a href="#fn276" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref276"><sup>276</sup></a> According to Yorke, Morrison claimed to have discovered &quot;a certain quality of soul&quot; when he first visited Scotland (his Belfast ancestors were of <a href="Ulster_Scots_people" title="wikilink">Ulster Scots</a> descent) and Morrison has said he believes there is some connection between soul music and Caledonia. Yorke relates that Morrison &quot;discovered several years after he first began composing music that some of his songs lent themselves to a unique major modal scale (without sevenths) which of course is the same scale as that used by <a href="bagpipes" title="wikilink">bagpipe</a> players and old Irish and Scottish folk music.&quot;<a href="#fn277" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref277"><sup>277</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="caledonia">Caledonia</h2>
<p>The name &quot;<a href="Caledonia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Caledonia</a>&quot; has played a prominent role in Morrison's life and career.
