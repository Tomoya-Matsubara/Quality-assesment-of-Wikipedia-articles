After spending six seasons with the organization, Collins spent a one year sojourn in the minor leagues before he was traded to the New York Yankees, where he spent the next three years and played in the famous 1927 <a href="Murderers&#39;_Row" title="wikilink">Murderers' Row</a> lineup. At the conclusion of the 1928 season, he was traded to the Boston Braves, with whom he played his last game on May 23, 1929. A two-time <a href="World_Series" title="wikilink">World Series</a> champion, he is famous for being the only major league player to <a href="Pinch_hitter" title="wikilink">pinch hit</a> and <a href="Pinch_runner" title="wikilink">pinch run</a> in the same game.</p>

<p>Collins began his professional baseball career in <a href="1917_in_baseball" title="wikilink">1917</a> with the <a href="Joplin_Miners" title="wikilink">Joplin Miners</a>, a <a href="minor_league_baseball" title="wikilink">minor league</a> baseball team that were members of the <a href="Class_A_(baseball)" title="wikilink">Class A</a> <a href="Western_League_(defunct_minor_league)" title="wikilink">Western League</a>.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> In 1919, his last season with the Miners, he had a breakthrough year, posting a <a href="Batting_average#Major_League_Baseball" title="wikilink">batting average</a> .316 and amassing 100 <a href="Hit_(baseball)" title="wikilink">hits</a>, 19 <a href="Double_(baseball)" title="wikilink">doubles</a> and 10 <a href="home_run" title="wikilink">home runs</a> in 96 <a href="games_played" title="wikilink">games played</a>.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> This caught the attention of the <a href="History_of_the_St._Louis_Browns" title="wikilink">St. Louis Browns</a>, who signed him near the end of the season.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="st.-louis-browns-1919u20131924">St. Louis Browns (1919&lt;U+2013&gt;1924)</h3>
<p>Collins made his major league debut for the Browns on September 5, 1919, at the age of 22,<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> entering the game as a <a href="pinch-hitter" class="uri" title="wikilink">pinch-hitter</a> for <a href="pitcher" class="uri" title="wikilink">pitcher</a> <a href="Bert_Gallia" title="wikilink">Bert Gallia</a> and drawing a <a href="Base_on_balls" title="wikilink">walk</a> in a 12&lt;U+2013&gt;3 loss against the <a href="Detroit_Tigers" title="wikilink">Detroit Tigers</a>.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> Between 1920 and 1922, he never played more than 31 games nor started more than 20 games a season as catcher, and his role was limited to occasional pinch-hitting appearances.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a></p>
<p>During the  season, Collins played 47 games (37 starts) and had the fifth highest <a href="caught_stealing" title="wikilink">caught stealing</a> percentage in the <a href="American_League" title="wikilink">American League</a> (AL) at 44.4%.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a><a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> During a June 8 road game at <a href="Shibe_Park" title="wikilink">Shibe Park</a>, he became the first and only major league player to <a href="Pinch_hitter" title="wikilink">pinch hit</a> and <a href="Pinch_runner" title="wikilink">pinch run</a> in the same game. His teammate <a href="Homer_Ezzell" title="wikilink">Homer Ezzell</a> reached base in the third inning, but needed to use the restroom. Collins was inserted into the game as a pinch runner until Ezzell returned. In the ninth inning, Collins returned to pinch hit for pitcher <a href="Ray_Kolp" title="wikilink">Ray Kolp</a> after the <a href="1923_Philadelphia_Athletics_season" title="wikilink">Philadelphia Athletics</a>' manager <a href="Connie_Mack" title="wikilink">Connie Mack</a> agreed to drop the no <a href="free_substitution" title="wikilink">free substitution</a> rule and allowed Collins to pinch hit.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a><a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> However, the official <a href="Box_score_(baseball)" title="wikilink">box score</a> lists his pinch hit appearance only.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a></p>
<p>In , there were two factors which limited Collins to just 20 games (11 starts) as catcher. Firstly, he dislocated the joint in his left thumb during <a href="spring_training" title="wikilink">spring training</a> after splitting the finger.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> Then on June 22, Collins&lt;U+2014&gt;along with Browns manager <a href="George_Sisler" title="wikilink">George Sisler</a> and coach <a href="Jimmy_Austin" title="wikilink">Jimmy Austin</a>&lt;U+2014&gt;were suspended indefinitely after arguing balls and strikes with the umpire.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> Sisler lodged a formal protest to AL president <a href="Ban_Johnson" title="wikilink">Ban Johnson</a>,<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> and the suspensions were rescinded four days later.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> After the season ended, Collins was not re-signed by the Browns, so he spent the  season with the <a href="St._Paul_Saints_(1901&lt;U+2013&gt;60)" title="wikilink">St. Paul Saints</a>, a <a href="minor_league_baseball" title="wikilink">minor league baseball</a> team that competed in the <a href="American_Association_(20th_century)" title="wikilink">American Association</a> (AA).
