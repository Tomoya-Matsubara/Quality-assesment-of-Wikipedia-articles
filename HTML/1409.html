<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<p>Colleges had hired physical educators since the early 1820s, but Edward Hitchcock Jr. is generally credited with being the first formal physical educator at the collegiate level. He believed in the importance of sound <a href="physical_health" title="wikilink">physical health</a> for college students, so that the mind could accomplish its best work and students could look forward to &quot;the promised labor of a long life.&quot; To achieve that goal, he developed systems of <a href="physical_training" title="wikilink">physical training</a> intended to appeal to the students both mentally and physically. His program at Amherst became a model for <a href="college" class="uri" title="wikilink">college</a> and <a href="secondary_school" title="wikilink">secondary school</a> programs nationally and internationally. The development of this first college program was Hitchcock's major contribution to the field of physical education.</p>
<h2 id="contributions">Contributions</h2>
<p>Edward Hitchcock Jr. contributed to Amherst College not only with his enlightened ideas concerning physical education, but also with his genuine personality. Hitchcock Jr. was noted as a kind, broad-minded, vigorous, optimistic, honest, faithfully religious man with shrewd <a href="common_sense" title="wikilink">common sense</a> and an intense loyalty to the college. Students were known for being rather fond of Hitchcock Jr. as well, and he was often affectionately referred to as &quot;Old Doc&quot;.</p>
<p>Old Doc is a noted &quot;crusader for <a href="fitness" class="uri" title="wikilink">fitness</a>&quot; he created schedules for <a href="physical_exercise" title="wikilink">physical exercises</a> to be completed at the college. <a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>. While Edward Hitchcock Jr. actively practiced and taught physical education at Amherst, he also conducted <a href="research" class="uri" title="wikilink">research</a> and intently studied the scientific functions that applied to his phys ed ideas. Hitchcock Jr. even worked with his aforementioned father Edward Hitchcock Sr to compile a <a href="textbook" class="uri" title="wikilink">textbook</a> titled, <a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> Elementary Anatomy and Physiology For Colleges, Academies and Other Schools. He named one of the earliest <a href="dinosaur" title="wikilink">dinosaurs</a> discovered in America, <em>Megadactylus polyzelus.</em> Later it was <a href="scientific_classification" title="wikilink">reclassified</a> as the <a href="holotype" title="wikilink">type</a> specimen of <em><a href="Anchisaurus" class="uri" title="wikilink">Anchisaurus</a> polyzelus</em> (ACM 41109), a <a href="prosauropoda" title="wikilink">prosauropod</a>.
