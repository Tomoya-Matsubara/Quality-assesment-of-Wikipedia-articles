<p><strong><em>Beautiful Garbage</em></strong> (also typeset <strong><em>beautifulgarbage</em></strong>) is the third <a href="album" class="uri" title="wikilink">album</a> by <a href="alternative_rock" title="wikilink">alternative rock</a> group <a href="Garbage_(band)" title="wikilink">Garbage</a>. The album was released worldwide in October 2001 by <a href="A&amp;E_Records" title="wikilink">Mushroom Records UK</a> and in <a href="North_America" title="wikilink">North America</a> by <a href="Interscope" class="uri" title="wikilink">Interscope</a> and was the followup to the band's <a href="Grammy" title="wikilink">Grammy-nominated</a> <em><a href="Version_2.0" title="wikilink">Version 2.0</a></em>. Marking a departure from the sound Garbage had established on their first two records, <em>Beautiful Garbage</em> was written and recorded over the course of a year, during which time <a href="lead_singer" title="wikilink">lead singer</a> <a href="Shirley_Manson" title="wikilink">Shirley Manson</a> chronicled their efforts weekly online, becoming one of the first high-profile musicians to keep an internet <a href="blog" class="uri" title="wikilink">blog</a>. The album is marked by expanding on the musical variety, with stronger melodies, more direct lyrics, and sounds that mix rock with <a href="electronica" class="uri" title="wikilink">electronica</a>, <a href="New_wave_music" title="wikilink">new wave</a>, <a href="Hip_hop_music" title="wikilink">hip hop</a> and <a href="girl_group" title="wikilink">girl groups</a>. The album's title is taken directly from a lyric in the song &quot;<a href="Celebrity_Skin_(song)" title="wikilink">Celebrity Skin</a>&quot; by <a href="Hole_(band)" title="wikilink">Hole</a>.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>Released three weeks after the <a href="September_11_attacks" title="wikilink">September 11 attacks</a>, the album suffered from lack of promotion, mixed reaction from critics and fans alike, and the failure of its <a href="lead_single" title="wikilink">lead single</a> &quot;<a href="Androgyny_(song)" title="wikilink">Androgyny</a>&quot; to achieve high chart positions.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> Despite faltering in major markets, <em>Beautiful Garbage</em> debuted at number 13 on the <a href="Billboard_200" title="wikilink"><em>Billboard</em> 200</a>, number 1 on <a href="Billboard_(magazine)" title="wikilink"><em>Billboard</em></a>'s <a href="Top_Electronic_Albums" title="wikilink">Top Electronic Albums</a>, topped the album charts in <a href="Australia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Australia</a>, and peaked within the top tens of multiple <a href="Europe" title="wikilink">European</a> countries. It was named one of <em><a href="Rolling_Stone" title="wikilink">Rolling Stone</a></em>'s &quot;Top 10 Albums of the Year&quot;.</p>
<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>The origins of <em>Beautiful Garbage</em> came from a three-day September 1999 <a href="recording_session" title="wikilink">recording session</a> during Garbage's <a href="Version_2.0_tour" title="wikilink">world tour</a> in support of their second album <em><a href="Version_2.0" title="wikilink">Version 2.0</a></em>.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> The sessions resulted in &quot;Silence Is Golden&quot; and &quot;Til the Day I Die&quot;, which were written for a proposed <a href="A-side_and_B-side" title="wikilink">B-sides</a> album.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a><a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> Both songs were loose and organic, contrasting the very dense layered production that featured on <em>Version 2.0</em>. &quot;Silence Is Golden&quot; in particular had been written with an odd <a href="Song_structure_(popular_music)" title="wikilink">structure</a> for a Garbage song: a <a href="Time_signature" title="wikilink">6/8</a> <a href="Swing_(jazz_performance_style)" title="wikilink">shuffle</a> that progressed to a straight <a href="Common_time" title="wikilink">4/4</a> <a href="Beat_(music)" title="wikilink">beat</a>.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p>The sale of the band's North American independent record label <a href="Almo_Sounds" title="wikilink">Almo Sounds</a> to <a href="Universal_Music_Group" title="wikilink">UMG</a> in early 2000 put the B-sides album on hold; Garbage decided to simply start work on recording their third album instead.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> Garbage began writing and recording the album at their own <a href="Smart_Studios" title="wikilink">Smart Studios</a>, in <a href="Madison,_Wisconsin" title="wikilink">Madison, Wisconsin</a> in April of that year. &quot;The only vision we had was that we wanted it to sound different,&quot; recalled guitarist <a href="Duke_Erikson" title="wikilink">Duke Erikson</a> about the influence that the two new tracks had cast, adding that the band wished to evolve the chemistry that the band had developed from <a href="Concert_tour" title="wikilink">touring</a> the previous two years.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="composition">Composition</h2>
<p>More diverse than their first two studio albums, musically more melodic and lyrically more direct, <em>Beautiful Garbage</em> featured <a href="electronica" class="uri" title="wikilink">electronica</a> fused with contemporary <a href="hip_hop" title="wikilink">hip hop</a>, with influences coming from 1980s <a href="New_wave_music" title="wikilink">new wave</a> to 1960s <a href="girl_groups" title="wikilink">girl groups</a>. Garbage acknowledged the broad span of sounds and styles, which range from <a href="Prince_(musician)" title="wikilink">Prince</a> to <a href="The_Rolling_Stones" title="wikilink">The Rolling Stones</a>, <a href="Blondie_(band)" title="wikilink">Blondie</a> to <a href="Phil_Spector" title="wikilink">Phil Spector</a>.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> Regarding the melancholic lyrics, Manson stated they happened because after two years touring &quot;we were very isolated and removed from our lives&quot;, so when writing the lyrics &quot;I felt an overwhelming sense that I need to reinvest in my 'relations'&quot;.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>

<p>Vig stated that the album is a &quot;much simpler record than <a href="Version_2.0" title="wikilink">Version 2.0</a>&quot;. &quot;All of the songs sort of came from us playing live downstairs [in Smart Studios] with guitar, bass and drums. Duke might be playing piano or keyboards too. That was the only conscious decision we made -- to make the songs simpler. Some of the songs are still layered in spots; compared to the last record, there're about half as many tracks. As far as sounds go, it's basically drums, bass, some heavy guitars and Shirley singing. There aren't 10 extra drum tracks or 10 extra guitars panning back and forth between channels.&lt;U+201D&gt; Erikson agreed that a more organic sound and simplistic approach with respect to production is embodied by the final mix of the album. &quot;A lot of songs took shape in just a few hours as opposed to a few months with the last record.[...]Some of the songs obviously took a long time, or we wouldn't have been in the studio for a full year. But a lot of them happened very quickly. 'Silence Is Golden' we recorded basically in three days and it was done. 'So Like a Rose,' for the most part, was recorded in three hours. I think we spent a lot of time just trying to resist adding stuff to [the new album]. Because that was our tendency on the other two records.&lt;U+201D&gt; On the lyrical content of the songs, Vig remarked that &quot;[Manson&lt;U+2019&gt;s lyrics] aren't specifically responses to the industry, but they could be read that way. Shirley has said that, for example, 'Shut Your Mouth' is about all the bullshit that's out there, but it's also a sort of note to self to keep your mouth shut, because she says she's the biggest, most opinionated loudmouth of anyone around. So they work on multiple levels.&quot;<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<p>Garbage decided the best way to start writing the album was to set up their <a href="Sound_recording_and_reproduction" title="wikilink">recording equipment</a>, guitars, keyboards, <a href="drum_kit" title="wikilink">drum kit</a> and a <a href="Sampler_(musical_instrument)" title="wikilink">sampler</a> and &quot;<a href="Jam_session" title="wikilink">jam</a>&quot; as a group.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> Their <a href="improvisation" class="uri" title="wikilink">improvisation</a> led the inspiration of a few songs such as &quot;<a href="Shut_Your_Mouth_(Garbage_song)" title="wikilink">Shut Your Mouth</a>&quot;, where the band played for three hours while Manson spontaneously composed melody and <a href="lyrics" class="uri" title="wikilink">lyrics</a>, while &quot;<a href="Breaking_Up_the_Girl" title="wikilink">Breaking Up the Girl</a>&quot; came from both Erikson and drummer <a href="Butch_Vig" title="wikilink">Butch Vig</a> <a href="strum" title="wikilink">strumming</a> acoustic guitars in the studio lounge.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> The band felt that it was foremost that the new songs worked on an emotional level with Shirley's vocals and lyrics.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> The initial sessions ultimately led to around 32 song ideas to develop further.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="recording">Recording</h2>
<p>Smart Studios had upgraded their <a href="mixing_console" title="wikilink">mixing console</a> to a <a href="Trident_Studios#The_Trident_&#39;A&#39;_Range_Console" title="wikilink">Trident A-Range</a> model, which the band used extensively. The band <a href="Multitrack_recording" title="wikilink">tracked</a> directly onto <a href="Magnetic_tape" title="wikilink">analogue tape</a> using a <a href="Studer" class="uri" title="wikilink">Studer</a> tape machine, which was then dumped into <a href="Pro_Tools" title="wikilink">Pro Tools</a> <a href="digital_audio_workstation" title="wikilink">digital audio workstation</a>. <a href="Overdubs" class="uri" title="wikilink">Overdubs</a> and <a href="Audio_mixing_(recorded_music)" title="wikilink">mixing</a> were carried out in Pro Tools.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>

<p>Vig kept the <a href="Drum_kit" title="wikilink">drums</a> and <a href="Percussion_instrument" title="wikilink">percussion</a> simpler than before. Percussive tracks were recorded through a thirty-year old <a href="Roger_Mayer_(engineer)" title="wikilink">Roger Meyer</a> <a href="Dynamic_range_compression" title="wikilink">compressor</a> to colour the sound (Vig: &quot;It's really saturated and distorted, but in a very musical way&quot;).<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> Some tracks however were fairly scrutinized: an <a href="instrumental" class="uri" title="wikilink">instrumental</a> <a href="bridge_(music)" title="wikilink">break</a> in &quot;Til the Day I Die&quot; incorporated <a href="reverse_tape_effects" title="wikilink">reverse tape effects</a>.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> Vig was not satisfied with his &quot;<a href="swing_(jazz_performance_style)" title="wikilink">swing</a>&quot; on a 6/8 <a href="Groove_(music)" title="wikilink">groove</a> written for a <a href="falsetto" class="uri" title="wikilink">falsetto</a> vocal Manson had recorded on &quot;Can't Cry These Tears&quot;, so he recruited <a href="Matt_Chamberlain" title="wikilink">Matt Chamberlain</a> to play the part. The recorded sequence incorporated Chamberlain's contribution, some of Vig's performance and some light <a href="Programming_(music)" title="wikilink">programming</a>.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> Chamberlain also performed a &quot;chopped-up&quot; <a href="Drum_beat" title="wikilink">drum pattern</a> for &quot;Cup of Coffee&quot; and a &quot;bitchin' funk groove&quot; on &quot;<a href="Breaking_Up_the_Girl#Commercial_track_listings" title="wikilink">Confidence</a>&quot;.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>
<p>Much of the recorded guitar work was <a href="Equalization_(audio)" title="wikilink">heavily processed</a>, the band using a <a href="Pod_(amp_modeler)" title="wikilink">Line 6 Pod</a> for <a href="Melody" title="wikilink">melodic parts</a> and <a href="Ornament_(music)" title="wikilink">embellishments</a>: for example, for the <a href="Thirty-two-bar_form" title="wikilink">middle eight</a> of &quot;So Like a Rose&quot;, Erikson played a <a href="Gibson_Les_Paul" title="wikilink">Les Paul</a> with an <a href="Ebow" title="wikilink">E-bow</a> through the Pod, while the <a href="Synthesizer" title="wikilink">synth-like</a> <a href="Introduction_(music)" title="wikilink">intro</a> to &quot;Parade&quot; was created by layering an acoustic guitar part with a clean electric guitar. A <a href="tremolo" class="uri" title="wikilink">tremolo</a> effect on &quot;Can't Cry These Tears&quot; was inspired by <a href="Wall_of_Sound" title="wikilink">1960s production techniques</a>.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> The <a href="Amplifier_modeling" title="wikilink">amp modelers</a> were used to pre-effect the recording prior to Pro Tools, in order to prevent <a href="phasing" class="uri" title="wikilink">phasing</a>. For electric guitar recording, the band utilized <a href="Isolation_cabinet_(guitar)" title="wikilink">cabinet miking</a> - four <a href="microphone" title="wikilink">mikes</a> recorded the output of a <a href="Marshall_Amplification" title="wikilink">Marshall</a> <a href="Guitar_amplifier" title="wikilink">amplifier</a>. Acoustics were recorded using a single <a href="Blue_Microphones" title="wikilink">Blue Bottle</a> mike.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> <a href="Daniel_Shulman" title="wikilink">Daniel Shulman</a>, who had performed bass guitar on <em>Version 2.0</em> and the band's two world tours, spent two separate weeks laying down bass parts. Shulman was given freedom by the band to come up with parts and be creative, creating new <a href="bassline" title="wikilink">basslines</a> on the <a href="Verse_(music)" title="wikilink">verses</a> of &quot;<a href="Androgyny_(song)" title="wikilink">Androgyny</a>&quot; and &quot;Nobody Loves You&quot;.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> Shulman revisited &quot;Silence Is Golden&quot;, breaking up the <a href="Swing_(jazz_performance_style)" title="wikilink">straight eighths</a> of the <a href="Coda_(music)" title="wikilink">coda</a> to make it more interesting.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a></p>
<p>Due to Manson's growing confidence and technical skill, the band decided that her vocals did not require much treatment; &quot;Shirley was singing so much better, and she was coming up with melodies that were longer and had more range to them...there wasn't any point in doing a lot with it. On something like 'Nobody Loves You' she sings really low on the verse, almost at the bottom of her range, and then and the end she's singing three and a half octaves higher, almost in falsetto, as the song turns into a big wall of sound&quot;, Vig remarked.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> Manson's original guide vocals were used in the final mixes of several songs; the vocal on &quot;So Like a Rose&quot; was recorded on the first <a href="take" class="uri" title="wikilink">take</a>.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> On some songs, however, Manson's vocal was subject to Pro Tools <a href="plug-in_(computing)" title="wikilink">plug-ins</a> and post effects. &quot;Til the Day Die&quot; featured a digital &quot;<a href="Scratching" title="wikilink">scratch</a>&quot;-effect, created by printing her vocal to <a href="Digital_Audio_Tape" title="wikilink">DAT</a> and using whatever edited passes sounded good. On &quot;Can't Cry These Tears&quot;, the four vocal parts were <a href="Multitrack_recording" title="wikilink">triple-tracked</a> using different mikes, while a <a href="guitar_riff" title="wikilink">guitar riff</a> was matched to her voice for a section of &quot;Breaking Up the Girl&quot;. On &quot;<a href="Cherry_Lips" title="wikilink">Cherry Lips</a>&quot;, her entire vocal was sped up and heavily EQ'd.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> On slower songs such as &quot;Drive You Home&quot;, Garbage were not overly concerned with <a href="Musical_phrasing" title="wikilink">phrasing</a> and <a href="pitch_(music)" title="wikilink">pitch</a>, giving it &quot;a rawer quality&quot;.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> Manson improved on her guitar skills and played more guitar in the studio and live on stage for the eventual tour.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a></p>
<p>Garbage finished recording <em>Beautiful Garbage</em> at the end of April 2001, and spent a month completing the <a href="Audio_mixing_(recorded_music)" title="wikilink">final mix</a> (some songs had gone through as many as 40 rough mixes).<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> Final EQ, compressing and <a href="Music_sequencer" title="wikilink">sequencing</a> on the album was handled by <a href="Scott_Hull_(mastering_engineer)" title="wikilink">Scott Hull</a> of Classic Sound in <a href="New_York" title="wikilink">New York</a>.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> Despite running a competition on their website to name the album, Manson's own working title, inspired by a lyric in <a href="Hole_(band)" title="wikilink">Hole</a>'s &quot;<a href="Celebrity_Skin_(song)" title="wikilink">Celebrity Skin</a>&quot; won out.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> The album artwork came from Garbage's wish for it to be &quot;something organic&quot;; The band came up with the fractured <a href="rose" class="uri" title="wikilink">rose</a> idea, thinking that it worked well with the album title. Garbage contracted <a href="London" class="uri" title="wikilink">London</a>-based designers Me Company to <a href="Computer-aided_design" title="wikilink">create the visuals</a>.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a></p>

<h2 id="critical-reception">Critical reception</h2>

<p>The album had a generally favorable reception.<a href="#fn67" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a> Both <em>Rolling Stone</em>'s US and Australian editions named <em>Beautiful Garbage</em> as one of their <a href="critics" class="uri" title="wikilink">critics</a> &quot;Top 10 Albums of the Year&quot;.<a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a><a href="#fn69" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref69"><sup>69</sup></a></p>
<p>Tom Laskin of <a href="Isthmus_(newspaper)" title="wikilink">Isthmus</a> wrote that the &quot;considerable sonic tweaking and abundant sampling that characterized the latter CD have been removed from Garbage's palette&quot;, noting that the songs are supported primarily by &quot;bass, drum, and guitar configurations&quot;. Manson, who might have been perceived as emotionally detached in past efforts, here &quot;exposes her core emotions with singular intent on two bittersweet reflections on failed relationships, the wistful &quot;Cup of Coffee&quot; and the crepuscular lover's lament &quot;Drive You Home&quot;.&lt;U+201D&gt; On observing a musical theme, &quot;it's the band's abandonment of digitally manipulated perfection in favor of rawer guitars and more immediate vocal performances.&quot; He added that, overall, the album is &quot;far less commercially accommodating than any of the band's previous work. It embraces no particular sound or style. It comes across with ideas and commentary that challenge rather than coerce, and the playing lacks the burnished, artificial quality that's characteristic of so much youth-oriented music these days.&quot;<a href="#fn70" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a></p>
<p><a href="NME" class="uri" title="wikilink">NME</a>'s Peter Robinson wrote that the album was a &quot;departure from the sound Garbage had established on their first two records&quot;; It is &quot;marked by expanding on the musical variety, with stronger melodies, more direct lyrics, and sounds that mix rock with hip hop, electronica, new wave, and girl groups.&quot;<a href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a> <a href="Sound_on_Sound" title="wikilink">Sound on Sound</a> described the band's approach to recording guitars as &quot;distinctive&quot;, observing the &quot;distorted crunches cheek-by-jowl with delicate acoustics and treated sounds which are almost unrecognizable.&quot;<a href="#fn72" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref72"><sup>72</sup></a></p>
<p>Michael Paoletta of <a href="Billboard_(magazine)" title="wikilink">Billboard</a> remarked that audiences expecting &quot;more of the same (that is, the predecessor, <em>Version 2.0</em>) are in for a wonderful surprise. [The album] finds [the band] eschewing disco-infused electronica foundations for more straight-up rock'n'pop ... The anthemic 'Parade' is lyrically deft, questioning all those cookie-cutter wannabes. With the spiky (and transgendered) 'Cherry Lips', replete with 'Chapel of Love'-styled wedding-bell chimes, Garbage has created a storyline for film director <a href="Gus_Van_Sant" title="wikilink">Gus Van Sant</a>. Modern tales for modern times, sung by the vocally versatile Manson, make for one of the year's best.&quot;<a href="#fn73" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref73"><sup>73</sup></a></p>
<p><a href="Q_(magazine)" title="wikilink">Q</a> described it as &quot;sharp, seductive music from a band at their peak.&quot;<a href="#fn74" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref74"><sup>74</sup></a> <a href="Uncut_(magazine)" title="wikilink">UNCUT</a> gave the album 4.5/5 stars, calling it &quot;their most accomplished and convincing album yet.&quot;<a href="#fn75" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref75"><sup>75</sup></a></p>
<p><a href="AllMusic" class="uri" title="wikilink">AllMusic</a>'s Stephen Thomas Erlewine commented that Garbage's penchant for absorbing elements from various genres, skillfully crafting them together is more evident in this album, in how they &quot;approximate contemporary R&amp;B with the sultry 'Androgyny', or the Minneapolis new wave bubblegum funk of 'Cherry Lips (Go Baby Go!),' or the bluesy <a href="PJ_Harvey" title="wikilink">PJ Harvey</a> strut of 'Silence Is Golden.'&quot; This penchant is enhanced by an &quot;unabashedly pop coating, an element that Garbage clearly revel in, as well as should the listener. This is every bit as enticingly postmodern as their other albums, and it sounds distinctly Garbage&quot;, and although the <a href="Music_genre#Fusion" title="wikilink">fusion</a> elements are perceptible, &quot;they seem less like magpies, more themselves, which means Beautiful Garbage is a more consistent record.&quot;<a href="#fn76" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref76"><sup>76</sup></a></p>
<p>David Browne of <a href="Entertainment_Weekly" title="wikilink">Entertainment Weekly</a> observed Manson's continued &quot;aggressive bite&quot; complemented by &quot;throbbing tracks like 'Till the Day I Die' and 'Shut Your Mouth'&quot;, as well as exposing &quot;tender aspects&quot; in &quot;heartfelt&quot; and &quot;subdued&quot; songs like 'Cup of Coffee' and 'So Like a Rose'. He noted however that the band's &quot;experiments with sonic expansion yield more mixed results&quot;; &quot;They thaw their sound by adding elements of trip-hop, which works for 'Cup of Coffee' and the first single, 'Androgyny' ... But on a record that's more self-consciously varied than 1998's <em><a href="Version_2.0" title="wikilink">Version 2.0</a></em> other attempts are gimmicky and less successful, like the girl-group opulence of the cloying 'Can't Cry These Tears' and the dated, '80s-new-wave bounce of 'Parade'. (Granted, the lyrics of the latter - &quot;So let's pray for something/To feel good in the morning&quot; - take on a new relevance now.) If you didn't know better, you'd think you were listening to a compilation, not a band album. Still, there's just enough to salvage from <em>beautifulgarbage</em>.&quot;<a href="#fn77" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref77"><sup>77</sup></a></p>
