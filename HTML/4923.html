<p><strong>George Hay, 7th Earl of Erroll</strong>  ( &lt;U+2013&gt; 30 January 1573) was a Scottish nobleman and politician.</p>
<h2 id="biography">Biography</h2>
<p>Hay was the grandson of <a href="William_Hay,_3rd_Earl_of_Erroll" title="wikilink">William Hay, 3rd Earl of Erroll</a>; George's father Thomas was killed alongside his older brother, <a href="William_Hay,_4th_Earl_of_Erroll" title="wikilink">William Hay, 4th Earl of Erroll</a>, at the <a href="Battle_of_Flodden" title="wikilink">Battle of Flodden</a> in 1513.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> <a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>After his cousin <a href="William_Hay,_6th_Earl_of_Erroll" title="wikilink">William Hay, 6th Earl of Erroll</a> died in 1541 leaving only a young daughter, George succeeded to the earldom and with it the family title of <a href="Lord_High_Constable_of_Scotland" title="wikilink">Lord High Constable of Scotland</a>. The sixth earl, who inherited the earldom as a toddler, died under the age of 21; by the time George inherited the titles, the barony had been in the possession of the crown for 19 years, four months.</p>
<p>In September and December 1741, the crown transferred into the new earl's hands the lands and baronies of <a href="Errol,_Perth_and_Kinross" title="wikilink">Errol</a>, Capeth, Inchiref, and Fossoquhy in <a href="Perthshire" class="uri" title="wikilink">Perthshire</a>; Cowie in <a href="Kincardine" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kincardine</a>, Cassingray in <a href="Fife" class="uri" title="wikilink">Fife</a>; Dronlaw and Innerpeffer in <a href="Forfarshire" class="uri" title="wikilink">Forfarshire</a>; and Slains in <a href="Aberdeenshire" class="uri" title="wikilink">Aberdeenshire</a>.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>The <a href="Peerage_of_Scotland" title="wikilink">Peerage of Scotland</a> is unique in that it allows the titles to descend along the female lines; Jean, the young daughter of the sixth earl of Erroll, could have conceivable inherited the earldom as Countess of Erroll. Instead, the crown negotiated for George to inherit, with the condition that he pay 4,000 <a href="Merk_(coin)" title="wikilink">merks</a> to Helen, Dowager Countess of Erroll and to marry one of his sons to Jean Hay &quot;at the King&lt;U+2019&gt;s pleasure.&quot;<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>

In April 1567, Erroll was a signatory to <a href="Ainslie_Tavern_Bond" title="wikilink">Ainslie's Tavern Band</a> agreeing to the marriage of <a href="Mary,_Queen_of_Scots" title="wikilink">Mary, Queen of Scots</a> to the <a href="James_Hepburn,_4th_Earl_of_Bothwell" title="wikilink">Earl of Bothwell</a>.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
