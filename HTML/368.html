<p><strong>Sha Tau Kok</strong> or <strong>Shataukok</strong> or '''Sathewkok ''' () is a town in the northeastern corner of <a href="Hong_Kong" title="wikilink">Hong Kong</a>. Located on the border with <a href="mainland_China" title="wikilink">mainland China</a>, there is another town of same Chinese name, <a href="Shatoujiao" class="uri" title="wikilink">Shatoujiao</a>, romanized using <a href="pinyin" class="uri" title="wikilink">pinyin</a>, across <a href="Shum_Chun_River" title="wikilink">Shum Chun River</a>-defined border in <a href="Shenzhen" class="uri" title="wikilink">Shenzhen</a>.</p>

<p>The rural town Sha Tau Kok is located besides <a href="Starling_Inlet" title="wikilink">Starling Inlet</a>, within the <a href="Closed_Area" title="wikilink">Closed Area</a>. The town centre is closer to the sea and north of town is a hill of Yuen Tuen Shan (&lt;U+5143&gt;&lt;U+58A9&gt;&lt;U+5C71&gt;). The control point of the access to Shenzhen is located northwest of the hill in Shan Tsui (&lt;U+5C71&gt;&lt;U+5480&gt;).</p>
<h2 id="closed-area">Closed Area</h2>
<p>Today, the Hong Kong-controlled Sha Tau Kok is a quiet rural town, part of <a href="North_District,_Hong_Kong" title="wikilink">North District</a> and lies within the <a href="Closed_Area" title="wikilink">Closed Area</a>. It has a post office, a bank, a few shops and a small population. Most of the residents are from <a href="Hakka" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hakka</a> farming or <a href="Hoklo_(ethnic_group)" title="wikilink">Hoklo</a> fishing backgrounds, although farming and fishing are no longer the main way of life, and most young people are well-educated and working in the urban areas. The Hong Kong portion of Sha Tau Kok is within the <a href="Closed_Area" title="wikilink">Closed Area</a>.</p>
<h2 id="border">Border</h2>
<p>Sha Tau Kok is one of the three road connections between <a href="Hong_Kong" title="wikilink">Hong Kong</a> and <a href="Mainland_China" title="wikilink">Mainland China</a>, the other two being <a href="Man_Kam_To" title="wikilink">Man Kam To</a> and <a href="Lok_Ma_Chau" title="wikilink">Lok Ma Chau</a>.</p>
<p><a href="Chung_Ying_Street" title="wikilink">Chung Ying Street</a> is special, as it previously lied on the border between <a href="China" class="uri" title="wikilink">China</a> and Hong Kong, one side of the road lying in each country. Currently, it may be perceived as a popular place for goods trafficking without getting through custom checks. There are a lot of goods leaving Hong Kong via Sha Tau Kok which goes into Chung Ying Street and eventually end up inside China. Likewise, foodstuffs come through from China into Hong Kong all day through, only limited by the closure of the Chinese custom post.</p>
<p>An influx of mainland workers flow into Chung Ying Street from 7am when the custom post is opened. Residents from the Chung Ying Street area are free to pass in and out of the Chinese border post, because they have residency passes. Other non-residents must be issued with permits to enter from the Chinese authorities. Tourists are also found visiting Chung Ying Street to buy Western products from Hong Kong first hand, and prices may be higher than within China, but equivalent products found within China are suspected by mainland residents as not being wholly genuine.</p>
<p>It is now possible to travel conveniently into mainland <a href="Shatoujiao" class="uri" title="wikilink">Shatoujiao</a> via the Sha Tau Kok border crossing. Coaches run a regular schedule from <a href="Luen_Wo_Market" title="wikilink">Luen Wo Market</a> (&lt;U+806F&gt;&lt;U+548C&gt;&lt;U+589F&gt;) (a small town near <a href="Fanling" class="uri" title="wikilink">Fanling</a>, in the <a href="New_Territories" title="wikilink">New Territories</a>) bus station, situated near the recently opened Luen Wo Market and Library complex, and from <a href="Fanling_(KCRC)" title="wikilink">Fanling train station</a> also. Tickets currently (2005) cost HK$20 for each passenger. The coaches also provide space for luggage. Travellers are taken through the Shek Chung Au (&lt;U+77F3&gt;&lt;U+6E67&gt;&lt;U+51F9&gt;) border check point without permit search, and are driven directly to the Sha Tau Kok Immigration checkpoint.</p>
<p>Here, passengers alight, go through customs, and have their documents processed, before reboarding the coach to be driven to the Shatoujiao KouYan (the mainland border immigration checkpoint). They alight and take all their belongings through the mainland Chinese customs and again have their documents processed. Travellers from outside China are advised to obtain entry visas from the appropriate authorities, or via a travel agent before attempting the entry. Hong Kong residents should hold Home Visit Permits (&lt;U+56DE&gt;&lt;U+9109&gt;&lt;U+8B49&gt;) (HuiXiang Zheng) for entry into China.</p>
<p>On the <a href="27th_January" title="wikilink">27th January</a> <a href="2005" class="uri" title="wikilink">2005</a>, it was announced that street maps for tourists were put up around Shatoujiao, in order to aid tourists' navigation.</p>
<h2 id="transport">Transport</h2>
<p>There was the terminus of <a href="Sha_Tau_Kok_Railway" title="wikilink">Sha Tau Kok Railway</a>, which was no longer run on <a href="1st_April" title="wikilink">1st April</a>, <a href="1929" class="uri" title="wikilink">1929</a> and replaced by <a href="Sha_Tau_Kok_Road" title="wikilink">Sha Tau Kok Road</a>. Sha Tau Kok Railway was built from the original <a href="narrow_gauge" title="wikilink">narrow gauge</a> of the <a href="KCR" class="uri" title="wikilink">KCR</a> British Section, which was replaced by <a href="standard_gauge" title="wikilink">standard gauge</a>. Since that time, the area in which the terminus occupied is still called the <em>train station</em> or fo cha teu in the local dialects (&lt;U+706B&gt;&lt;U+8ECA&gt;&lt;U+982D&gt; huochetou). Currently, both <a href="double_decker" title="wikilink">double decker</a> and <a href="minibus" class="uri" title="wikilink">minibus</a> services are available in the Shatoukok area.
