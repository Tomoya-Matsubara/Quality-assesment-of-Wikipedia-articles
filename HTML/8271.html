<p><a href="Street_hierarchy" title="wikilink">Street hierarchy</a> was first elaborated by Ludwig Hilberseimer in his book <em>City Plan</em>, 1927. Hilberseimer emphasized safety for school-age children to walk to school while increasing the speed of the vehicular circulation system.</p>
<p>Beginning in 1929 at the Bauhaus, Hilberseimer developed studies concerning town construction for the decentralization of large cities. Against the background of the economic and political fall of the Weimar Republic he developed a universal and global adaptable planning system (The new town center, 1944), which planned a gradual dissolution of major cities and a complete penetration of landscape and settlement. He proposed that in order to create a sustainable relationship between humans, industry, and nature; human habitation should be built in a way to secure all people against all disasters and crises.</p>
<p>His most notable built project is <a href="Lafayette_Park,_Detroit" title="wikilink">Lafayette Park, Detroit</a>, an urban renewal project designed in cooperation with architect <a href="Ludwig_Mies_van_der_Rohe" title="wikilink">Mies van der Rohe</a> and landscape architect <a href="Alfred_Caldwell" title="wikilink">Alfred Caldwell</a>.</p>
