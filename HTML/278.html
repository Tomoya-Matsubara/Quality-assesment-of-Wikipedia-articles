<p>The <strong>sinking of the RMS <em>Titanic</em></strong> occurred on the night of 14/15 April 1912 in the north <a href="Atlantic_Ocean" title="wikilink">Atlantic Ocean</a>, four days into her <a href="maiden_voyage" title="wikilink">maiden voyage</a> from <a href="Southampton" class="uri" title="wikilink">Southampton</a> to <a href="New_York_City" title="wikilink">New York City</a>. The largest <a href="superliner_(passenger_ship)" title="wikilink">passenger liner</a> in service at the time, <em><a href="RMS_Titanic" title="wikilink">Titanic</a></em> had 2,223 people on board when she struck an <a href="iceberg" class="uri" title="wikilink">iceberg</a> at 23:40 (ship's times clocks were set to 2 hours 2 minutes ahead of <a href="Eastern_Time_Zone" title="wikilink">Eastern Time Zone</a> (<a href="UTC&lt;U+2212&gt;05:00" class="uri" title="wikilink">UTC&lt;U+2212&gt;05:00</a>) and 2 hours 58 minutes behind <a href="Greenwich_Mean_Time" title="wikilink">Greenwich Mean Time</a>. In other words, her time was close to UTC-3 (only 2 minutes ahead).}}) on 14 April 1912. She sank a few hours later at 02:20 on 15 April, causing the deaths of 1,517 people in one of the deadliest <a href="List_of_maritime_disasters#Peacetime_disasters" title="wikilink">peacetime maritime disasters</a> in history.</p>
<p><em>Titanic</em> had received several warnings of sea ice during 14 April but was travelling near her maximum speed when she collided with the iceberg. The ship suffered a glancing blow that buckled her starboard (right) side and opened five of her sixteen compartments to the sea. <em>Titanic</em> had been designed to stay afloat with four flooded compartments but not five, and the crew soon realised that the ship was going to sink. They used rocket flares and wireless messages to attract help as the passengers were put into lifeboats. However, there were far too few lifeboats available and many were not filled to their full capacity due to a poorly managed evacuation.</p>
<p>The ship broke up as she sank with over a thousand passengers and crew members still aboard. Almost all of those who jumped or fell into the water died from <a href="hypothermia" class="uri" title="wikilink">hypothermia</a> within a matter of minutes. <a href="RMS_Carpathia" title="wikilink">RMS <em>Carpathia</em></a> arrived on the scene about an hour and a half after the sinking and had rescued the last of the survivors in the lifeboats by 09:15 on 15 April, little more than 24 hours after <em>Titanic</em>{{'}}s crew had received their first warnings of drifting ice. The disaster caused widespread public outrage over the lack of lifeboats, lax shipping regulations and the unequal treatment of the different classes aboard the ship. Enquiries set up in the wake of the disaster recommended sweeping changes to maritime regulations. This led in 1914 to the establishment of the <a href="International_Convention_for_the_Safety_of_Life_at_Sea" title="wikilink">International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea</a> (SOLAS), which still governs maritime safety today.</p>

It was reported to be streaked with paint from a ship&#39;s hull.|alt=Black and white photograph of a large iceberg with three &quot;peaks&quot;." /> During 14 April 1912, <em>Titanic</em>{{'}}s crew received six wireless messages from other ships warning of drifting ice, which passengers on <em>Titanic</em> began to notice during the afternoon. The ice conditions in the North Atlantic were the worst for any April in the previous 50 years, the result of a mild winter which caused large numbers of icebergs to break away from the west coast of <a href="Greenland" class="uri" title="wikilink">Greenland</a>.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> The weather improved significantly during the course of the day, from brisk winds and moderate seas in the morning to a crystal-clear calm by the evening as the ship entered an Arctic high-pressure system.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
<p>The first warning came at 09:00 from <a href="RMS_Caronia_(1905)" title="wikilink">RMS <em>Caronia</em></a> reporting &quot;bergs, growlers and field ice&quot;.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> Captain Smith acknowledged receipt of the message. At 13:42, <a href="RMS_Baltic_(1903)" title="wikilink">RMS <em>Baltic</em></a> relayed a report from the Greek ship <em>Athenia</em> that she had been &quot;passing icebergs and large quantities of field ice&quot;.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> This too was acknowledged by Smith, who showed the report to <a href="J._Bruce_Ismay" title="wikilink">J. Bruce Ismay</a>, the chairman of the White Star Line, aboard <em>Titanic</em> for her maiden voyage.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> Smith ordered a new course to be set further south.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> At 13:45, <em>Titanic</em> relayed a message from the German ship <a href="USS_America_(ID-3006)" title="wikilink">SS <em>Amerika</em></a>, which was a short distance to the south, stating that the German vessel had &quot;passed two large icebergs&quot;.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> The message never reached Captain Smith or the other officers on <em>Titanic</em>{{'}}s <a href="Bridge_(nautical)" title="wikilink">bridge</a>. The reason is unclear, but it may have been forgotten because the wireless operators had to fix faulty equipment.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a></p>
<p><a href="SS_Californian" title="wikilink">SS <em>Californian</em></a> reported &quot;three large bergs&quot; at 19:30, and at 21:40 the steamer <em>Mesaba</em> reported: &quot;Saw much heavy pack ice and great number large icebergs. Also field ice.&quot;<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> This message also never left the wireless cabin; the wireless operator, <a href="Jack_Phillips_(wireless_officer)" title="wikilink">Jack Phillips</a>, may have been preoccupied with transmitting messages for passengers via the relay station at <a href="Cape_Race" title="wikilink">Cape Race</a>, Newfoundland, and did not grasp the significance of the message.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> A final warning message was received at 22:30 from the <em>Californian</em>, which had stopped for the night in an ice field some miles away, but Phillips cut it off and signalled back: &quot;Shut up! Shut up! I'm working Cape Race.&quot;<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a></p>
<p>Although the crew were aware of ice in the vicinity, the ship's speed was not reduced, and she continued to steam at , only a little short of her maximum speed.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> <em>Titanic</em>{{'}}s high speed in waters where ice had been reported was later criticised as reckless, but it reflected standard maritime practice at the time. According to Fifth Officer <a href="Harold_Lowe" title="wikilink">Harold Lowe</a>, the custom was &quot;to go ahead and depend upon the lookouts in the crow's nest and the watch on the bridge to 'pick up' the ice in time to avoid hitting it.&quot;<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> The North Atlantic liners prioritised time-keeping above all other considerations, sticking rigidly to a schedule that would guarantee their arrival at a predetermined time. They were constantly driven at full speed, treating hazard warnings as advisories rather than calls to action. It was widely believed that ice posed little risk; near misses were not uncommon, and even head-on collisions were not disastrous. In 1907 <a href="SS_Kronprinz_Wilhelm" title="wikilink">SS <em>Kronprinz Wilhelm</em></a>, a German liner, had rammed an iceberg but was able to complete her voyage despite suffering a crushed bow. That same year, <em>Titanic</em>{{'}}s future captain, Edward Smith, declared in an interview that he could not &quot;imagine any condition which would cause a ship to founder. Modern shipbuilding has gone beyond that.&quot;<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a></p>

<p>As <em>Titanic</em> approached her fatal crash, most passengers had gone to bed and command of the bridge had passed from <a href="Second_Officer_(nautical)" title="wikilink">Second Officer</a> <a href="Charles_Lightoller" title="wikilink">Charles Lightoller</a> to <a href="Chief_mate" title="wikilink">First Officer</a> <a href="William_McMaster_Murdoch" title="wikilink">William Murdoch</a>. Lookouts <a href="Frederick_Fleet" title="wikilink">Frederick Fleet</a> and <a href="Reginald_Lee" title="wikilink">Reginald Lee</a> were occupying the <a href="crow&#39;s_nest" title="wikilink">crow's nest</a>  above the deck. Because of a mix-up at Southampton the lookouts had no binoculars, though because of the poor quality of optics at this time it is thought unlikely that they would have helped.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> The air temperature had dropped to near freezing and the ocean was completely calm. Colonel <a href="Archibald_Gracie_IV" title="wikilink">Archibald Gracie</a>, one of the survivors of the disaster, later wrote that &quot;the sea was like glass, so smooth that the stars were clearly reflected.&quot;<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> It is now known that such exceptionally calm water is a sign of nearby pack ice.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> Although the air was clear, there was no moon and with the sea so calm, there was nothing to give away the position of the nearby icebergs; had the sea been rougher, waves breaking at the foot of the icebergs would have made them more visible.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> The lookouts were well aware of the ice hazard, as Lightoller had ordered them and other crew members to &quot;keep a sharp look-out for ice, particularly small ice and growlers&quot;,<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> but they were unaware that they were about to steam at full speed into a line of drifting ice several miles wide and many miles long.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a></p>

<p>At 23:40, Fleet spotted an iceberg in <em>Titanic</em>{{'}}s path, rang the ship's bell three times and telephoned the bridge to inform Sixth Officer <a href="James_Paul_Moody" title="wikilink">James Moody</a>, who asked: &quot;What do you see?&quot; Fleet replied: &quot;Iceberg right ahead.&quot; After thanking Fleet, Moody relayed the message to Murdoch, who ordered Quartermaster <a href="Robert_Hichens_(RMS_Titanic)" title="wikilink">Robert Hitchens</a> to change the ship's course.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> Murdoch is generally said to have given an order of &quot;Hard a'starboard&quot; which would result in the ship's <a href="tiller" class="uri" title="wikilink">tiller</a> being moved all the way to <a href="starboard" class="uri" title="wikilink">starboard</a> (the right side of the ship) in an attempt turn the ship to <a href="port_(nautical)" title="wikilink">port</a> (left).<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> He also rang &quot;Full Astern&quot; on the <a href="Engine_order_telegraph" title="wikilink">ship's telegraphs</a>. According to Fourth Officer <a href="Joseph_Boxhall" title="wikilink">Joseph Boxhall</a>, Murdoch told Captain Smith that he was attempting to &quot;hard-a-port around [the iceberg]&quot;, suggesting that he was attempting a &quot;port around&quot; manoeuvre&lt;U+2014&gt;to first swing the bows around the obstacle, then swing the stern so that both ends of the ship would avoid a collision. There was a delay before either order went into effect; the steam-powered steering mechanism took up to 30 seconds to turn the ship's tiller,<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> and the complex task of setting the engines into reverse would also have taken some time to accomplish.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> The ship's heading changed just in time to avoid a head-on collision but resulted in <em>Titanic</em> striking the iceberg with a glancing blow. An underwater spur of ice scraped along the starboard side of the ship for about seven seconds, causing chunks of dislodged ice to fall onto her forward decks.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> A few minutes later, <em>Titanic</em>{{'}}s engines were stopped, leaving the ship facing north and drifting in the <a href="Labrador_Current" title="wikilink">Labrador Current</a>.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a></p>

According to Paul K. Matthias, who made the measurements, the damage consisted of a &quot;series of deformations in the starboard side that start and stop along the hull ... about  above the bottom of the ship.&quot;<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> The gaps, the longest of which measures about  long, appear to have followed the line of the hull plates. This suggests that the iron rivets along the plate seams snapped off or popped open to create narrow gaps through which water flooded. An engineer from <em>Titanic</em>{{'}}s builders, <a href="Harland_and_Wolff" title="wikilink">Harland and Wolff</a>, suggested this scenario at a British inquiry following the disaster but his view was discounted.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> <em>Titanic</em>{{'}}s discoverer Dr. <a href="Robert_Ballard" title="wikilink">Robert Ballard</a> has commented that the assumption that the ship had suffered a massive breach was &quot;a byproduct of the mystique of the <em>Titanic</em>. No one could believe that the great ship was sunk by a little sliver.&quot;<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a> Faults in the ship's hull may have been a contributing factor. Recovered pieces of the <em>Titanic</em>{{'}}s hull plates appear to have shattered on impact with the iceberg, without bending.<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> The steel plates were far weaker than comparable modern steel due to high levels of impurities and larger grain sizes. The rivets also had a high level of slag inclusions, making them more brittle and prone to snapping when put under stress.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a></p>
<p>Above the waterline, there was little evidence of the collision. The stewards in the First Class Dining Room noticed a shudder, which they thought might have been caused by the ship shedding a propeller blade. Many of the passengers felt a bump or shudder but did not know what it was.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a> Those on the lowest decks, nearest the site of the collision, felt it much more directly. Engine Oiler Walter Hurst recalled being &quot;awakened by a grinding crash along the starboard side.

The stokers and firemen were ordered to draw down the fires and vent the boilers, sending great quantities of steam up the funnel venting pipes. They were waist-deep in freezing water by the time they finished their work.<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a></p>

Each was separated from its neighbour by a bulkhead running the width of the ship; there were fifteen bulkheads in all. Each bulkhead could be sealed off by vertically descending watertight doors, many of which could be operated remotely from the bridge. However, although the bulkheads extended well above the water line, they were not sealed at the top. If too many compartments were flooded, the ship's bow would settle deeper in the water, and water would spill from one compartment to the next in sequence, rather like water spilling across the top of an ice cube tray. This was what happened to <em>Titanic</em>, which had suffered damage to the forepeak tank, the three forward holds and No. 6 boiler room.

Her initial list to starboard was caused by asymmetrical flooding of the starboard side as water poured down a passageway at the bottom of the ship.<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a> When the passageway was fully flooded, the list corrected itself but the ship later began to list to port by up to 10&lt;U+00B0&gt; as that side also flooded asymmetrically.<a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a> <em>Titanic{{'}}s</em> down angle altered fairly rapidly from 0&lt;U+00B0&gt; to about 4.5&lt;U+00B0&gt; during the first hour after the collision, but the rate at which the ship went down slowed greatly for the second hour, worsening only to about 5&lt;U+00B0&gt;.<a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a> This gave many of those aboard a false sense of hope that the ship might stay afloat long enough to them to be rescued. From about 01:45 to 02:15, however, the rate of increase in the angle began to accelerate until <em>Titanic</em> reached a down angle of about 10&lt;U+00B0&gt;. This put the forward deck underwater and caused a massive increase in the rate of flooding. At that point, <em>Titanic{{'}}s</em> longitudinal stability was lost and it took only another couple of minutes for the ship to tip over entirely, snapping her keel and causing <em>Titanic{{'}}s</em> final breakup and sinking.<a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a></p>

As the mail room flooded, the mail sorters made an ultimately futile attempt to save the 400,000 items of mail being carried aboard <em>Titanic</em>. Elsewhere, air could be heard being forced out by inrushing water.<a href="#fn69" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref69"><sup>69</sup></a> Above them, stewards went from door to door, rousing sleeping passengers and crew &lt;U+2013&gt; <em>Titanic</em> did not have a public address system &lt;U+2013&gt; and told them to go to the Boat Deck.<a href="#fn70" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a> The thoroughness of the muster was heavily dependent on the class of the passengers; the first-class stewards were in charge of only a few cabins, while those responsible for the second and third-class passengers had to manage large numbers of people. The first-class stewards provided hands-on assistance, helping their charges to get dressed and bringing them out onto the deck. With far more people to deal with, the second- and third-class stewards mostly confined their efforts to throwing open doors and telling passengers to put on lifebelts and come up top. In third class, passengers were largely left to their own devices after being informed of the need to come on deck.<a href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a></p>
<p>Many passengers and crew were reluctant to comply, either refusing to believe that there was a problem or preferring the warmth of the ship's interior to the bitterly cold night air. The passengers were not told that the ship was sinking, though a few noticed that she was listing.<a href="#fn72" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref72"><sup>72</sup></a> Around 00:15, the stewards began ordering the passengers to put on their lifebelts,<a href="#fn73" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref73"><sup>73</sup></a> though again, many passengers treated the order as a joke.<a href="#fn74" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref74"><sup>74</sup></a> Some set about playing an impromptu game of football with the ice chunks that were now strewn across the foredeck.<a href="#fn75" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref75"><sup>75</sup></a> It was difficult to hear anything over the noise of high-pressure steam being vented up the funnels from the boilers. Laurence Beesley described the sound as &quot;a harsh, deafening boom that made conversation difficult; if one imagines 20 locomotives blowing off steam in a low key it would give some idea of the unpleasant sound that met us as we climbed out on the top deck.&quot;<a href="#fn76" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref76"><sup>76</sup></a> The noise was so great that the crew had to rely on hand signals to communicate on the deck.<a href="#fn77" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref77"><sup>77</sup></a></p>
<p>Captain Smith was faced with the fact that there were too few lifeboats to save everyone onboard. <em>Titanic</em> had a total of 20 lifeboats, comprising 16 wooden boats on davits, 8 on either side of the ship, and 4 collapsible boats with wooden bottoms and canvas sides.<a href="#fn78" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref78"><sup>78</sup></a> The collapsibles were stored upside down with the sides folded in, and would have to be erected and moved to the davits for launching.<a href="#fn79" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref79"><sup>79</sup></a> Two were stored under the wooden boats and the other two were lashed atop the officers' quarters.<a href="#fn80" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref80"><sup>80</sup></a> The position of the latter would make them extremely difficult to launch, as they weighed several tons each and had to be manhandled down to the boat deck.<a href="#fn81" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref81"><sup>81</sup></a> On average, the lifeboats could take up to 68 people each, and collectively they could accommodate 1,178 &lt;U+2013&gt; barely half the number of people on board and only a third of the number the ship was licensed to carry. The shortage of lifeboats was not because of a lack of space &lt;U+2013&gt; <em>Titanic</em> had been designed to accommodate up to 68 lifeboats<a href="#fn82" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref82"><sup>82</sup></a> &lt;U+2013&gt; nor was it because of cost, as the price of an extra 32 lifeboats would only have been some $16,000, a tiny fraction of the $7.5 million that the company had spent on <em>Titanic</em>. The White Star Line had wished to have a wide promenade deck with uninterrupted views of the sea, which would have been obstructed by a continuous row of lifeboats.<a href="#fn83" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref83"><sup>83</sup></a> The company never envisaged that all of the crew and passengers would have to be evacuated at once, as <em>Titanic</em> was considered almost unsinkable. The lifeboats were instead intended to be used in the event of an emergency to transfer passengers off the ship and onto a nearby vessel providing assistance.<a href="#fn84" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref84"><sup>84</sup></a> It was commonplace for liners to have far fewer lifeboats than needed to accommodate all their passengers and crew, and <em>Titanic</em> had more lifeboats than the outdated British regulations required. Out of 39 British liners of the time of over , 33 had too few lifeboat places to accommodate everyone on board.<a href="#fn85" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref85"><sup>85</sup></a></p>
<p>Smith was an experienced sailor who had served for 40 years at sea, with 27 years in command. He would certainly have known that even if the boats were fully occupied, a thousand people would remain on the ship as she went down.<a href="#fn86" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref86"><sup>86</sup></a> As the enormity of what was about to happen sank in, he appears to have become paralysed by indecision. He did not issue a general call for evacuation, failed to order his officers to load the lifeboats, did not adequately organise the crew, withheld crucial information from his officers and crewmen, and gave sometimes ambiguous and impractical orders. Even some of his bridge officers were unaware for some time after the collision that the ship was sinking; Fourth Officer <a href="Joseph_Boxhall" title="wikilink">Joseph Boxhall</a> did not find out until 01:15, barely an hour before the ship went down,<a href="#fn87" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref87"><sup>87</sup></a> while Quartermaster George Rowe was so unaware of the emergency that after the evacuation had started, he phoned the bridge from his watch station to ask why he had just seen a lifeboat go past.<a href="#fn88" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref88"><sup>88</sup></a> Smith did not advise his officers that the ship did not have enough lifeboats to save everyone. He did not supervise the loading of the lifeboats and seemingly made no effort to find out if his orders were being followed.<a href="#fn89" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref89"><sup>89</sup></a><a href="#fn90" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref90"><sup>90</sup></a></p>
<p>The crew was likewise unprepared for the emergency, as lifeboat training had been minimal. Only one lifeboat drill had been carried out while the ship was docked. It was a cursory effort, consisting of two boats being lowered, each manned by one officer and four men who merely rowed around the dock for a few minutes before returning to the ship. The boats were supposed to be stocked with emergency supplies but <em>Titanic</em>{{'}}s passengers later found that they had only been partially provisioned.<a href="#fn91" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref91"><sup>91</sup></a> No lifeboat or fire drills had been carried out since <em>Titanic</em> left Southampton.<a href="#fn92" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref92"><sup>92</sup></a> A lifeboat drill had been scheduled for the morning before the ship sank, but was cancelled for unknown reasons by Captain Smith.<a href="#fn93" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref93"><sup>93</sup></a> Lists had been posted on the ship allocating crew members to particular lifeboat stations, but few appeared to have read them or to have known what they were supposed to do. Most of the crew were, in any case, not seamen, and even some of those had no prior experience of rowing a boat. They were now faced with the complex task of coordinating the lowering of 20 boats carrying 1,100 people  down the sides of the ship.<a href="#fn94" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref94"><sup>94</sup></a> Thomas E. Bonsall, a historian of the disaster, has commented that the evacuation was so badly organised that &quot;even if they had the number [of] lifeboats they needed, it is impossible to see how they could have launched them&quot; given the lack of time and poor leadership.<a href="#fn95" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref95"><sup>95</sup></a></p>
<p>By about 00:20, 40 minutes after the collision, the loading of the lifeboats was under way, though it was perhaps symptomatic of Captain Smith's apparent indecisiveness that it was at the suggestion of Second Officer Lightoller. As the latter recalled afterwards, &quot;I yelled at the top of my voice, 'Hadn't we better get the women and children into the boats, sir?' He heard me and nodded reply.&quot;<a href="#fn96" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref96"><sup>96</sup></a> Smith ordered Lightoller to put the &quot;women and children in and lower away&quot;. Lightoller took charge of the boats on the port side and Murdoch took those on the starboard side. The two officers interpreted the evacuation order differently; Murdoch took it to mean women and children <em>first</em> while Lightoller thought it meant women and children <em>only</em>. Lightoller lowered lifeboats with empty seats if there were no women and children waiting to board, while Murdoch allowed a limited number of men to board if all the nearby women and children had embarked.<a href="#fn97" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref97"><sup>97</sup></a> Neither officer knew how many people could safely be carried in the boats as they were lowered and erred on the side of caution by not filling them. They could have been lowered quite safely with their full complement of 68 people.<a href="#fn98" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref98"><sup>98</sup></a> Had this been done, an extra 500 people could have been saved; instead, hundreds of people, predominantly men, were left on board as lifeboats were launched with many seats empty.<a href="#fn99" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref99"><sup>99</sup></a><a href="#fn100" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref100"><sup>100</sup></a></p>
<p>Few passengers at first were willing to board the lifeboats and the officers in charge of the evacuation found it hard to persuade them. The millionaire <a href="John_Jacob_Astor_IV" title="wikilink">John Jacob Astor</a> declared: &quot;We are safer here than in that little boat.&quot;<a href="#fn101" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref101"><sup>101</sup></a> Some passengers refused flatly to embark. J. Bruce Ismay, realising the need for urgency, roamed the starboard deck and urged passengers and crew to evacuate. A trickle of women, couples and single men were persuaded to board starboard lifeboat No. 7, which became the first lifeboat to be lowered.<a href="#fn102" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref102"><sup>102</sup></a></p>

In the background men are loading other women into a lifeboat." /> At 00:45 lifeboat No. 7 was rowed away from <em>Titanic</em> with 28 passengers on board (despite a capacity of 65). <a href="RMS_Titanic_Lifeboat_No._6" title="wikilink">Lifeboat No. 6</a>, on the port side, was the next to be lowered at 00:55. It also had 28 people on board, among them the &quot;unsinkable&quot; <a href="Margaret_Brown" title="wikilink">Margaret &quot;Molly&quot; Brown</a>. Lightoller realised there was only one seaman on board and called for volunteers. Major <a href="Arthur_Godfrey_Peuchen" title="wikilink">Arthur Godfrey Peuchen</a> of the Royal Canadian Yacht Club stepped forward and climbed down a rope into the lifeboat; he was the only male passenger who Lightoller allowed to board during the port side evacuation.<a href="#fn103" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref103"><sup>103</sup></a> Peuchen's role highlighted a key problem during the evacuation: there were hardly any seamen to man the boats. Some had been sent below to open gangway doors to allow more passengers to be evacuated, but they never returned. They were presumably trapped and drowned by the rising water below decks.<a href="#fn104" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref104"><sup>104</sup></a></p>
<p>Other crewmen fought for their lives as water continued to pour into the ship. The engineers and firemen worked to vent steam from the boilers to prevent them from exploding on contact with the cold water. They set up extra pumps in the forward compartments in a futile bid to stem the torrent, and kept the electrical generators running to maintain lights and power throughout the ship. Steward F. Dent Ray narrowly avoided being swept away when a wooden wall between his quarters and the third-class accommodation on E deck collapsed, leaving him waist-deep in water.<a href="#fn105" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref105"><sup>105</sup></a> Two engineers died in boiler room No. 5 when, at around 00:45, the bunker door separating it from the flooded No. 6 boiler room collapsed and they were swept away by &quot;a wave of green foam&quot;.<a href="#fn106" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref106"><sup>106</sup></a> In boiler room No. 4, at around 01:20, water began flooding in from below, possibly indicating that the bottom of the ship had also been holed by the iceberg. The flow of water soon overwhelmed the pumps and forced the firemen to evacuate the forward boiler rooms.<a href="#fn107" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref107"><sup>107</sup></a> Further <a href="aft" class="uri" title="wikilink">aft</a>, Chief Engineer William Bell, his engineering colleagues and a handful of volunteer firemen and greasers stayed behind in the unflooded No. 1, 2 and 3 boiler and engine rooms. They continued working on the electrical generators in order to keep the ship's lights on and to power the wireless so that distress signals could be sent.<a href="#fn108" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref108"><sup>108</sup></a> They apparently remained at their posts until the very end, ensuring that <em>Titanic</em> remained lit until the final minutes of the sinking. None of the ship's engineers survived.<a href="#fn109" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref109"><sup>109</sup></a> <em>Titanic</em>{{'}}s five postal clerks were last seen struggling to save the mail bags they had rescued from the flooded mail room. They were caught by the rising water somewhere on D deck.<a href="#fn110" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref110"><sup>110</sup></a></p>
<p>Many of the third-class passengers were also confronted with the site of water pouring into their quarters on E, F and G decks. Carl Jansson, one of the relatively few third-class passengers to survive, later recalled:</p>
<dl>

<dd>Then I run down to my cabin to bring my other clothes, watch and bag but only had time to take the watch and coat when water with enormous force came into the cabin and I had to rush up to the deck again where I found my friends standing with lifebelts on and with terror painted on their faces. What should I do now, with no lifebelt and no shoes and no cap?<a href="#fn111" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref111"><sup>111</sup></a>

<p>The lifeboats were lowered every few minutes on each side, but most of the boats were greatly under-filled. No. 5 left with 41 aboard, No. 3 had 32 aboard, No. 8 left with 39<a href="#fn112" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref112"><sup>112</sup></a> and No. 1 left with just 12 out of a capacity of 40.<a href="#fn113" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref113"><sup>113</sup></a> The evacuation did not go smoothly and passengers suffered accidents and injuries as it progressed. One woman fell between lifeboat No. 10 and the side of the ship but someone caught her by the ankle and hauled her back onto the promenade deck, where she made a second successful attempt at boarding.<a href="#fn114" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref114"><sup>114</sup></a> First-class passenger Annie Stengel broke several ribs when an overweight German-American doctor and his brother jumped into No. 5, squashing her and knocking her unconscious.<a href="#fn115" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref115"><sup>115</sup></a><a href="#fn116" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref116"><sup>116</sup></a> The lifeboats' descent was likewise risky.

<p>By 01:20, the seriousness of the situation was now apparent to the passengers above decks, who began saying their goodbyes, with husbands escorting their wives and children to the lifeboats. <a href="Distress_rocket" title="wikilink">Distress rockets</a> were fired every few minutes to attract the attention of any ships nearby and the wireless operators repeatedly sent the <a href="distress_signal" title="wikilink">distress signal</a> <a href="CQD" class="uri" title="wikilink">CQD</a>. Wireless operator Harold Bride suggested to his colleague Jack Phillips that he should use the new <a href="SOS" class="uri" title="wikilink">SOS</a> signal, as it &quot;may be your last chance to send it&quot;.

<p>The vast majority of those who had boarded by this time were first and second-class passengers. Few third-class (steerage) passengers had made it up onto the deck, and most were still lost in the maze of corridors or trapped behind barriers and partitions which segregated the accommodation for the steerage passengers from the first and second-class areas.<a href="#fn132" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref132"><sup>132</sup></a> This segregation was not simply for social reasons, but was a requirement of United States immigration laws, which mandated that third-class passengers be segregated to control immigration and prevent the spread of infectious diseases. First and second-class passengers on transatlantic liners disembarked at the main piers in <a href="Manhattan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Manhattan</a>, but steerage passengers had to go through health checks and processing at <a href="Ellis_Island" title="wikilink">Ellis Island</a>.<a href="#fn133" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref133"><sup>133</sup></a> In at least some places, <em>Titanic</em>{{'}}s crew appear to have actively hindered the steerage passengers' escape. Some of the barriers were locked and guarded by crew members, apparently to prevent the steerage passengers rushing the lifeboats.<a href="#fn134" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref134"><sup>134</sup></a> Irish survivor Margaret Murphy wrote in May 1912:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Before all the steerage passengers had even a chance of their lives, the <em>Titanic</em>{{'}}s sailors fastened the doors and companionways leading up from the third-class section ... A crowd of men was trying to get up to a higher deck and were fighting the sailors; all striking and scuffling and swearing. Women and some children were there praying and crying. Then the sailors fastened down the hatchways leading to the third-class section. They said they wanted to keep the air down there so the vessel could stay up longer. It meant all hope was gone for those still down there.<a href="#fn135" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref135"><sup>135</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>A long and winding route had to be taken to reach topside; the steerage-class accommodation, located on decks C through G, was at the extreme ends of the decks, and so was furthest away from the lifeboats. By contrast, the first-class accommodation was located on the upper decks and so was nearest. Proximity to the lifeboats thus became a key factor in determining who got in them. To add to the difficulty, many of the steerage passengers did not understand English.

The deteriorating situation was reflected in the messages sent from the ship, which carried a tone of increasing desperation: &quot;We are putting the women off in the boats&quot; at 01:25, &quot;Engine room getting flooded&quot; at 01:35, and at 01:45, &quot;Engine room full up to boilers.&quot;<a href="#fn142" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref142"><sup>142</sup></a> This was <em>Titanic</em>{{'}}s last intelligible signal, sent as the ship's electrical system began to fail; subsequent messages were jumbled and broken.

No. 11 was filled with five people more than its rated capacity. As it was lowered, it was nearly flooded by water being pumped out of the ship, but made it safely to the sea. No. 13 narrowly avoided the same problem but those aboard were unable to release the ropes from which the boat had been lowered. It drifted astern, directly under No. 15 as it was being lowered. The ropes were cut in time and both boats made it away safely.<a href="#fn144" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref144"><sup>144</sup></a></p>
<p>The first signs of panic were seen when a group of passengers attempted to rush port-side lifeboat No. 14 as it was being lowered with 40 people aboard.

As first-class passenger Jack Thayer described it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Occasionally there had been a muffled thud or deadened explosion within the ship. Now, without warning she seemed to start forward, moving forward and into the water at an angle of about fifteen degrees. This movement with the water rushing up toward us was accompanied by a rumbling roar, mixed with more muffled explosions. It was like standing under a steel railway bridge while an express train passes overhead mingled with the noise of a pressed steel factory and wholesale breakage of china.<a href="#fn173" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref173"><sup>173</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Eyewitnesses saw <em>Titanic</em>{{'}}s stern lifting high into the air as the ship tilted down in the water.

He attributed it to &quot;the engines and machinery coming loose from their bolts and bearings, and falling through the compartments, smashing everything in their way&quot;.<a href="#fn177" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref177"><sup>177</sup></a> The lights went out, plunging <em>Titanic</em> into darkness. Jack Thayer recalled seeing &quot;groups of the fifteen hundred people still aboard, clinging in clusters or bunches, like swarming bees; only to fall in masses, pairs or singly as the great afterpart of the ship, two hundred fifty feet of it, rose into the sky.&quot;<a href="#fn178" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref178"><sup>178</sup></a> The stern began to settle back before rising again to a nearly vertical angle, where it remained for a few moments.<a href="#fn179" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref179"><sup>179</sup></a> Thayer reported that it rotated on the surface, &quot;gradually [turning] her deck away from us, as though to hide from our sight the awful spectacle ... Then, with the deadened noise of the bursting of her last few gallant bulkheads, she slid quietly away from us into the sea.&quot;<a href="#fn180" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref180"><sup>180</sup></a></p>
<p><em>Titanic</em>{{'}}s surviving officers and a number of prominent survivors later testified that the ship had sunk in one piece, a conclusion that was endorsed by the British and American inquiries into the disaster. Archibald Gracie stated that &quot;<em>Titanic</em>{{'}}s decks were intact at the time she sank, and when I sank with her, there was over seven-sixteenths of the ship already under water, and there was no indication then of any impending break of the deck or ship&quot;.<a href="#fn181" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref181"><sup>181</sup></a> However, many survivors' accounts clearly indicated that the ship had broken in two as it was sinking.<a href="#fn182" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref182"><sup>182</sup></a> As the engines are now known to have stayed in place along with most of the boilers, the &quot;great noise&quot; heard by witnesses and the momentary settling of the stern were evidently caused by the breakup of the ship rather than the loosening of her fittings or boiler explosions.<a href="#fn183" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref183"><sup>183</sup></a> <em>Titanic</em> was subjected to extreme opposing forces &lt;U+2013&gt; water in the bow pulling her down and air in the stern forcing her to the surface &lt;U+2013&gt; which were concentrated at one of the weakest points in the structure, the area of the engine room hatch. The ship split from side to side across No. 1 boiler room, between Nos. 3 and 4 funnels.<a href="#fn184" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref184"><sup>184</sup></a><a href="#fn185" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref185"><sup>185</sup></a> The submerged bow may have remained attached to the stern by the keel for a short time, pulling the stern to a high angle before separating and leaving the stern to float for a few minutes longer. The forward part of the stern would have flooded very rapidly, causing it to tilt until it reached its final near-vertical position.<a href="#fn186" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref186"><sup>186</sup></a></p>
<p>After they went under, the bow and stern took only a few minutes to fall , spilling a trail of heavy machinery, tons of coal and great quantities of debris from <em>Titanic</em>{{'}}s interior. The two parts of the ship landed about  apart on a gently undulating area of the seabed.<a href="#fn187" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref187"><sup>187</sup></a> The streamlined bow section continued to descend at about the angle it had taken on the surface, striking the seabed prow-first at a shallow angle<a href="#fn188" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref188"><sup>188</sup></a> at an estimated speed of . Its momentum caused it to dig a deep gouge into the seabed and buried the section up to  deep in sediment before it came to an abrupt halt. The sudden deceleration caused the bow's structure to buckle downwards by several degrees just forward of the bridge. The decks at the rear end of the bow section, which had already been weakened during the break-up, collapsed one atop another.<a href="#fn189" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref189"><sup>189</sup></a> The stern section seems to have descended almost vertically, probably rotating as it fell.<a href="#fn190" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref190"><sup>190</sup></a> Pockets of air still trapped in the hull imploded as it descended, tearing open the structure and ripping off the poop deck.<a href="#fn191" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref191"><sup>191</sup></a> The section landed with such force that it buried itself about  deep at the rudder. The decks pancaked down on top of each other and the hull plating splayed out to the sides.

An unknown number of people had gone down with the ship, trapped below decks or sucked down and drowned as the ship sank. <em>Titanic</em>{{'}}s disintegration during its descent to the seabed caused buoyant chunks of debris &lt;U+2013&gt; timber beams, wooden doors, furniture, panelling and chunks of cork from the bulkheads &lt;U+2013&gt; to rocket to the surface.

Among them were Archibald Gracie, Jack Thayer and Charles Lightoller, who made it to the capsized collapsible boat B. About 35 men climbed aboard the upturned hull and clung on precariously, trying to keep their balance and avoid being tipped off by the mass of swimmers around them. They paddled slowly away, ignoring the pleas of dozens of swimmers to be allowed on board. Collapsible boat A was upright but partly flooded, as its sides had not been properly raised, and its occupants had to sit for hours in a foot of freezing water.<a href="#fn199" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref199"><sup>199</sup></a> Further out, the other eighteen lifeboats &lt;U+2013&gt; most of which had empty seats &lt;U+2013&gt; drifted as the occupants debated what, if anything, they should do to rescue the swimmers. No. 4 boat seems to have been closest to the site of the sinking; this enabled several people to swim over and be picked up. A few more were pulled from the water, though two later died. In all of the other boats, the occupants eventually decided against returning, probably out of fear that they would be capsized in the attempt. Some put their objections more bluntly; Quartermaster Hitchens, commanding lifeboat No. 6, told the women aboard his boat that there was no point returning as there were &quot;only a lot of stiffs there.&quot;<a href="#fn200" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref200"><sup>200</sup></a></p>

Some, exhausted by the ordeal, fell off into the sea and were drowned.<a href="#fn207" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref207"><sup>207</sup></a> It became steadily harder for the rest to keep their balance on the hull, with waves washing across it.<a href="#fn208" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref208"><sup>208</sup></a> Archibald Gracie later wrote of how he and the other survivors sitting on the upturned hull were struck by &quot;the utter helplessness of our position.&quot;<a href="#fn209" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref209"><sup>209</sup></a></p>

The men on collapsible B finally managed to transfer to two other lifeboats, but one survivor died just before the transfer was made.<a href="#fn212" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref212"><sup>212</sup></a> Collapsible A was also in trouble and was now nearly awash; more than half of those aboard had died overnight.<a href="#fn213" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref213"><sup>213</sup></a> The remainder were transferred into another lifeboat, leaving behind three bodies in the boat, which was left to drift away. It was recovered a month later by the White Star liner <a href="RMS_Oceanic_(1899)" title="wikilink"><em>Oceanic</em></a>, with the bodies still aboard.<a href="#fn214" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref214"><sup>214</sup></a></p>
<p>The survivors and those on <em>Carpathia</em> were startled by the scene that greeted them as the sun came up: &quot;fields of ice on which, like points on the landscape, rested innumerable pyramids of ice.&quot;<a href="#fn215" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref215"><sup>215</sup></a> Captain <a href="Arthur_Rostron" title="wikilink">Arthur Rostron</a> of <em>Carpathia</em> saw ice all around, including 20 large bergs measuring up to  high and numerous smaller bergs, as well as ice floes and debris from <em>Titanic</em> drifting in the water.<a href="#fn216" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref216"><sup>216</sup></a> It appeared to <em>Carpathia</em>{{'}}s passengers that their ship was in the middle of a vast white plain of ice, studded with icebergs appearing like hills in the distance.<a href="#fn217" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref217"><sup>217</sup></a></p>
<p>As the lifeboats were brought alongside <em>Carpathia</em>, the survivors came aboard by various means. Some were strong enough to climb aboard on rope ladders; others were hoisted up in slings, and the children were hoisted aboard in mail sacks.<a href="#fn218" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref218"><sup>218</sup></a> The last lifeboat to reach the ship was Lightoller's boat No. 12, with 74 people aboard in a boat designed to carry 65. They were all aboard by 09:00.<a href="#fn219" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref219"><sup>219</sup></a> There were some scenes of joy on <em>Carpathia</em> as families and friends were reunited, but in most cases hopes were dashed as loved ones failed to reappear.<a href="#fn220" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref220"><sup>220</sup></a> <em>Carpathia</em> was bound for Fiume, <a href="Austria-Hungary" class="uri" title="wikilink">Austria-Hungary</a> (now <a href="Rijeka" class="uri" title="wikilink">Rijeka</a>, Croatia) but as she had neither the supplies nor the medical facilities aboard to cater for the survivors, Rostron ordered a course to be calculated to return the ship to her starting point, New York, where the survivors could be properly looked after.<a href="#fn221" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref221"><sup>221</sup></a> At 09:15, two more ships appeared on the scene &lt;U+2013&gt; <a href="SS_Mount_Temple" title="wikilink"><em>Mount Temple</em></a> and <em>Californian</em>, which had finally learned of the disaster a few hours earlier when her wireless operator returned to duty &lt;U+2013&gt; but by then there were no more survivors to be rescued. <em>Carpathia</em> then departed the area for New York, leaving the other ships to carry out a final, fruitless search for a couple of hours.<a href="#fn222" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref222"><sup>222</sup></a><a href="#fn223" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref223"><sup>223</sup></a></p>

A worried-looking man in a top hat marked &quot;Steamship Magnate&quot; looks on. In the distant background a ship can be seen sinking." /> <em>Carpathia</em> arrived at Pier 34 in New York on the evening of 18 April after a difficult voyage through pack ice, fog, thunderstorms and rough seas.<a href="#fn224" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref224"><sup>224</sup></a><a href="#fn225" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref225"><sup>225</sup></a> Some 40,000 people stood on the waterfront, alerted to the disaster by a stream of wireless messages from <em>Carpathia</em> and other ships. Due to communications difficulties, it was only after <em>Carpathia</em> docked &lt;U+2013&gt; a full three days after <em>Titanic</em>{{'}}s sinking &lt;U+2013&gt; that the events of the disaster became public knowledge.<a href="#fn226" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref226"><sup>226</sup></a> The heaviest loss was in Southampton, England, home to most of the crew; 699 members of the crew gave Southampton addresses,<a href="#fn227" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref227"><sup>227</sup></a> and 549 Southampton residents, almost all crew, were lost in the disaster.<a href="#fn228" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref228"><sup>228</sup></a></p>
<p>Even before <em>Carpathia</em> arrived in New York, efforts were getting underway to retrieve the dead. Four ships chartered by the White Star Line succeeded in retrieving 328 bodies; 119 were buried at sea, while the remaining 209 were brought ashore to the Canadian port of <a href="City_of_Halifax" title="wikilink">Halifax, Nova Scotia</a>,<a href="#fn229" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref229"><sup>229</sup></a> where 150 of them were buried.<a href="#fn230" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref230"><sup>230</sup></a> Memorials were raised in various places &lt;U+2013&gt; New York, Washington, Southampton, Liverpool, Belfast and Lichfield, among others<a href="#fn231" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref231"><sup>231</sup></a> &lt;U+2013&gt; and ceremonies were held on both sides of the Atlantic to commemorate the dead and raise funds to aid the survivors.<a href="#fn232" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref232"><sup>232</sup></a> The bodies of most of <em>Titanic</em>{{'}}s victims were never recovered, and the only evidence of their deaths was found 73 years later among the debris on the seabed: pairs of shoes lying side by side, where bodies had once lain before being devoured by sea creatures or dissolved by the steady currents of sea water.<a href="#fn233" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref233"><sup>233</sup></a></p>
<p>The prevailing public reaction to the disaster was one of shock and outrage, directed against a number of issues and people: why were there so few lifeboats? Why had Ismay saved his skin when so many others died? Why did <em>Titanic</em> proceed into the icefield at full speed?<a href="#fn234" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref234"><sup>234</sup></a> The outrage was driven not least by the survivors themselves; even while they were aboard <em>Carpathia</em> on their way to New York, Beesley and other survivors determined to &quot;awaken public opinion to safeguard ocean travel in the future&quot; and wrote a public letter to <em><a href="The_Times" title="wikilink">The Times</a></em> urging changes to maritime safety.<a href="#fn235" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref235"><sup>235</sup></a> In places closely associated with <em>Titanic</em>, there was a deep sense of grief. Crowds of weeping women, the wives, sisters and mothers of crew members, gathered outside the White Star Line's offices in Southampton to find out what had happened to their loved ones &lt;U+2013&gt; most of whom had perished.<a href="#fn236" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref236"><sup>236</sup></a> Churches in Belfast were packed and shipyard workers wept in the streets after the news was announced. The ship had been a symbol of Belfast's industrial achievements and there was not only a sense of grief but also of guilt, as those who had built <em>Titanic</em> came to feel that they had in some way been responsible for her loss.<a href="#fn237" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref237"><sup>237</sup></a></p>
<p>In the aftermath of the sinking, public enquiries were set up in Britain and the United States. The US enquiry began on 19 April under the chairmanship of <a href="United_States_Senate" title="wikilink">Senator</a> <a href="William_Alden_Smith" title="wikilink">William Alden Smith</a>,<a href="#fn238" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref238"><sup>238</sup></a> while the British enquiry commenced in London under <a href="John_Bigham,_1st_Viscount_Mersey" title="wikilink">Lord Mersey</a> on 2 May 1912.<a href="#fn239" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref239"><sup>239</sup></a> They reached broadly similar conclusions; the regulations on the number of lifeboats that ships had to carry were out of date and inadequate,<a href="#fn240" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref240"><sup>240</sup></a> Captain Smith had failed to take proper heed of ice warnings,<a href="#fn241" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref241"><sup>241</sup></a> the lifeboats had not been properly filled or crewed, and the collision was the direct result of steaming into a danger area at too high a speed.<a href="#fn242" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref242"><sup>242</sup></a> Captain Lord of the <em>Californian</em> was strongly criticised by both enquiries for failing to render assistance to <em>Titanic</em>.<a href="#fn243" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref243"><sup>243</sup></a> The disaster led to major changes in maritime regulations to implement new safety measures, such as ensuring that more lifeboats were provided, that lifeboat drills were properly carried out and that wireless equipment on passenger ships was manned around the clock.<a href="#fn244" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref244"><sup>244</sup></a> An <a href="International_Ice_Patrol" title="wikilink">International Ice Patrol</a> was set up to monitor the presence of icebergs in the North Atlantic, and maritime safety regulations were harmonised internationally through the <a href="International_Convention_for_the_Safety_of_Life_at_Sea" title="wikilink">International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea</a>; both measures are still in force today.<a href="#fn245" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref245"><sup>245</sup></a></p>
<p>The disaster became a cultural phenomenon, commemorated by numerous artists, film-makers, writers, composers, musicians and dancers from the time immediately after the sinking to the present day.<a href="#fn246" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref246"><sup>246</sup></a></p>
<p>On 1 September 1985 a joint US-French expedition led by Dr. Robert Ballard found <a href="The_wreck_of_the_RMS_Titanic" title="wikilink">the wreck of the <em>Titanic</em></a>,<a href="#fn247" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref247"><sup>247</sup></a> and the ship's rediscovery led to an explosion of interest in <em>Titanic</em>{{'}}s story.<a href="#fn248" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref248"><sup>248</sup></a> In 1997, <a href="James_Cameron" title="wikilink">James Cameron</a>'s eponymous film became the first movie ever to take $1 billion at the box office, and the <a href="Titanic:_Music_from_the_Motion_Picture" title="wikilink">film's soundtrack</a> became the best selling soundtrack recording of all time.<a href="#fn249" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref249"><sup>249</sup></a> Numerous expeditions have been launched to film the wreck and, controversially, to salvage objects from the debris field.<a href="#fn250" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref250"><sup>250</sup></a></p>
<p>Although many artefacts have been recovered and conserved, the wreck itself is steadily decaying, as iron-eating bacteria consume the hull at an estimated rate of  a day.<a href="#fn251" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref251"><sup>251</sup></a> <em>Titanic</em>{{'}}s structure will eventually collapse into a pile of iron and steel fragments. Eventually she will be reduced to a patch of rust on the seabed, with the remaining scraps of the ship's hull mingled with her more durable fittings.<a href="#fn252" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref252"><sup>252</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="casualties-and-survivors">Casualties and survivors</h3>

<p>The number of casualties of the sinking is unclear, due to a number of factors, including confusion over the passenger list, which included some names of people who cancelled their trip at the last minute, and the fact that several passengers travelled under aliases for various reasons and were double-counted on the casualty lists.<a href="#fn253" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref253"><sup>253</sup></a> The death toll has been put at between 1,490 and 1,635 people.<a href="#fn254" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref254"><sup>254</sup></a> The figures below are from the British Board of Trade report on the disaster.<a href="#fn255" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref255"><sup>255</sup></a></p>

<p>Less than a third of those aboard <em>Titanic</em> survived the disaster. Some survivors died shortly afterwards; injuries and the effects of exposure caused the deaths of several of those brought aboard <em>Carpathia</em>.<a href="#fn256" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref256"><sup>256</sup></a> The figures show stark differences in the survival rates of the different classes aboard <em>Titanic</em>. Although only 3 per cent of first-class women were lost, 54 per cent of those in third class died. Similarly, five of six first-class and all second-class children survived, but 52 of the 79 in third class perished.<a href="#fn257" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref257"><sup>257</sup></a> The only first-class child to perish was <a href="Allison_family" title="wikilink">Loraine Allison</a>, aged 2. Proportionately, the heaviest losses were suffered by the second-class men, of whom 92 per cent died. James Cameron, the director of the 1997 blockbuster film <em><a href="Titanic_(1997_film)" title="wikilink">Titanic</a></em>, notes: &quot;A third-class male stood about a one-in-eight chance ... If you were a first-class male ... it was about 50&lt;U+2013&gt;50. If you were a first-class female, it was 98 per cent in your favour. If you were a third-class female, it was about 50&lt;U+2013&gt;50.&quot; It was for this reason that he chose to centre his film on a love affair between a first-class female and a third-class male, individuals with respectively the greatest and least chance of survival.<a href="#fn258" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref258"><sup>258</sup></a></p>
