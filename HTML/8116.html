<p>Described as &quot;in-your-face&quot;, &quot;This Is What Rock n' Roll Looks Like&quot; draws influences from the genre of <a href="Rock_music" title="wikilink">rock</a>, <a href="dance-pop" class="uri" title="wikilink">dance-pop</a><a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> and <a href="power_pop" title="wikilink">power pop</a>, whilst containing elements of &quot;roaring&quot; guitars and lyrics which aim to remind listeners to be proud of who they are.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> Vocally, Porcelain Black sings as if straining through &quot;a maze of razorblades,&quot; according to Steven J. Horowitz of <em><a href="Yellow_Rat_Bastard" title="wikilink">YRB Magazine</a></em>.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> The RedOne-produced track employs a beat that is reminiscent of his work with <a href="Lady_Gaga" title="wikilink">Lady Gaga</a>.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> Porcelain Black screams in the chorus &quot;Hey hey hey if you're ready to rage / Raise your hands up, this what rock and roll looks like / Yeah yeah yeah, wearing leather and lace / Raise your hands up, this what rock and roll looks like.&quot;<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> While being interviewed by the <em><a href="Los_Angeles_Times" title="wikilink">Los Angeles Times</a></em>, Porcelain Black discussed in depth about the genre mix in &quot;This Is What Rock n' Roll Looks Like&quot;:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;I'm a pretty good representation of rock and roll, as far as I&lt;U+2019&gt;m concerned. I'm ... crazy. Some people might have their own opinions and say well this is kind of pop-y. I think we're in a world now where music is evolving and it doesn't have to be just one thing. It doesn't have to be just pop or just rock. You can mix it and have it still be legitimate rock 'n' roll. I like to say if Marilyn Manson and Britney Spears ... had a kid it would be me.&quot;<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Although the song's title references the physical appearance of what rock and roll looks like, Porcelain Black revealed in an interview with AOL's <em>NoiceCreep</em> that rock and roll is not dependent on the physical appearance of someone.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> She stated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Whatever you want it to look like. There are so many types of rock 'n' roll, you can't say one thing, this is what rock 'n' roll looks like. Rock 'n' roll I think is about attitude and the way you carry yourself, and that's what it looks like. It's not necessarily what you're wearing.&quot;<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>

<p>It was about getting revenge. People were always hating on me, because I was different.

This is what I'm going to do.&quot; And everybody was like, &quot;Yeah right.&quot; Even when I told everyone I was moving to LA to do music and had a going away party, only one person showed up, because no one believed that I was really going away. They were like, &quot;You'll be back.&quot; So it was kind of just like my revenge, and just a statement, like throwing it back in their face.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a></p>
