<p><strong>Charles Eaton</strong> <a href="Order_of_the_British_Empire" title="wikilink">OBE</a>, <a href="Air_Force_Cross_(United_Kingdom)" title="wikilink">AFC</a> (21 December 1895 – 12 November 1979) was a senior officer and aviator in the <a href="Royal_Australian_Air_Force" title="wikilink">Royal Australian Air Force</a> (RAAF), who later served as a diplomat. Born in London, he joined the <a href="British_Army" title="wikilink">British Army</a> upon the outbreak of <a href="World_War_I" title="wikilink">World War I</a> and saw action on the <a href="Western_Front_(World_War_I)" title="wikilink">Western Front</a> before transferring to the <a href="Royal_Flying_Corps" title="wikilink">Royal Flying Corps</a> in 1917. Posted as a bomber pilot to <a href="No._206_Squadron_RAF" title="wikilink">No. 206 Squadron</a>, he was twice captured by German forces, and twice escaped. Eaton left the military in 1920 and worked in India until moving to Australia in 1923. Two years later he joined the RAAF, serving initially as an <a href="Flight_instructor" title="wikilink">instructor</a> at No. 1 Flying Training School. Between 1929 and 1931, he was chosen to lead three expeditions to search for lost aircraft in <a href="Central_Australia" title="wikilink">Central Australia</a>, earning the <a href="Air_Force_Cross_(United_Kingdom)" title="wikilink">Air Force Cross</a> for his &quot;zeal and devotion to duty&quot;.</p>
<p>In 1939, on the eve of <a href="World_War_II" title="wikilink">World War II</a>, Eaton became the inaugural <a href="Commanding_Officer" title="wikilink">Commanding Officer</a> of <a href="No._12_Squadron_RAAF" title="wikilink">No. 12 (General Purpose) Squadron</a> at the newly established <a href="RAAF_Base_Darwin" title="wikilink">RAAF Station Darwin</a> in Northern Australia. Promoted <a href="Group_Captain" title="wikilink">Group Captain</a> the following year, he was appointed an <a href="Officer_of_the_Order_of_the_British_Empire" title="wikilink">Officer of the Order of the British Empire</a> in 1942. He took command of <a href="No._79_Wing_RAAF" title="wikilink">No. 79 Wing</a> at <a href="Batchelor,_Northern_Territory" title="wikilink">Batchelor</a>, Northern Territory in 1943, and was <a href="Mentioned_in_Despatches" title="wikilink">Mentioned in Despatches</a> during operations in the <a href="South_West_Pacific_theatre_of_World_War_II" title="wikilink">South West Pacific</a>. Retiring from the RAAF in December 1945, Eaton took up diplomatic posts in the <a href="Dutch_East_Indies" title="wikilink">Dutch East Indies</a>, heading a <a href="United_Nations" title="wikilink">United Nations</a> commission as <a href="Consul_(representative)" title="wikilink">Consul-General</a> during the <a href="Indonesian_National_Revolution" title="wikilink">Indonesian National Revolution</a>. He returned to Australia in 1950, and served in <a href="Canberra" class="uri" title="wikilink">Canberra</a> for a further two years. A farmer in later life, he died in 1979 at the age of 83.</p>

Three of the RAAF's five &quot;ancient&quot; <a href="Airco_DH.9" title="wikilink">DH.9</a> biplanes went down in the search—though all crews escaped injury—including Eaton's, which experienced what he labelled &quot;a good crash&quot; on 21 April near <a href="Tennant_Creek" title="wikilink">Tennant Creek</a> after the engine's pistons melted. With the wreck of the <em>Kookaburra</em> located by Captain Lester Brain in a <a href="QANTAS" class="uri" title="wikilink">QANTAS</a> aircraft, Eaton led the ground party that buried the crew, who had perished of thirst and exposure. Following the burial, Eaton, not a particularly religious man, recalled seeing a perfect cross formed by <a href="cirrus_cloud" title="wikilink">cirrus cloud</a> in an otherwise clear blue sky above the <em>Kookaburra</em>.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a><a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> The Air Board described the RAAF's search as taking 240 hours flying time &quot;under the most trying conditions ... where a forced landing meant certain crash&quot;.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> In November 1930, Eaton was selected to lead another expedition for a missing aircraft near <a href="Uluru" title="wikilink">Ayer's Rock</a>, but it was called off soon afterwards when the pilot showed up in <a href="Alice_Springs" title="wikilink">Alice Springs</a>. The next month, however, he was ordered to search for W.L. Pittendrigh and S.J. Hamre, who had disappeared in the biplane <em>Golden Quest 2</em> while attempting to discover <a href="Lasseter&#39;s_Reef" title="wikilink">Lasseter's Reef</a>. Employing a total of four DH-60 Moths, the RAAF team located the missing men near Dashwood Creek on 7 January 1931, and they were rescued four days later by a ground party accompanied by Eaton. While staying in nearby Alice Springs, he recommended a site for the town's new airfield, which was approved and has remained in use ever since.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a><a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> He was awarded the <a href="Air_Force_Cross_(United_Kingdom)" title="wikilink">Air Force Cross</a> on 10 March 1931 &quot;in recognition of his zeal and devotion to duty in conducting flights to Central Australia in search of missing aviators&quot;.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> The media called him the &quot;'Knight Errant' of the desert skies&quot;.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a></p>
<p>Aside from his crash landing in the desert while searching for the <em>Kookaburra</em>, Eaton had another narrow escape in 1929 when he and <a href="Sergeant" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sergeant</a> Eric Douglas were test flying a <a href="Lawrence_Wackett" title="wikilink">Wackett Warrigal I</a>. Having purposely put the biplane trainer into a spin and finding no response in the controls when he tried to recover, Eaton called on Douglas to bail out. When Douglas stood up to do so, the spin stopped, apparently due to his torso changing the airflow over the tail plane. Eaton then managed to land the aeroplane, he and his passenger both badly shaken by the experience.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> In December 1931, he was posted to No. 1 Aircraft Depot at Laverton, where he continued to fly in addition to performing administrative work.

They then began developing plans for the new station, to be commanded by Jones, and a new squadron that would be based there, led by Eaton. Delays meant that <a href="No._12_Squadron_RAAF" title="wikilink">No. 12 (General Purpose) Squadron</a> was not formed until 6 February 1939 at Laverton. Jones had moved on to another posting by this time but Eaton took up the squadron's command as planned. Promoted to Wing Commander on 1 March, he and his equipment officer, Flying Officer Hocking, were ordered to build up the unit as soon as possible, and established a complement of fourteen officers and 120 airmen, plus four Ansons and four Demons, with a week. An advance party of thirty <a href="Non-commissioned_officer" title="wikilink">NCOs</a> and airmen under Hocking began moving to Darwin on 1 July. Life at the newly established air base had a &quot;distinctly raw, pioneering feel about it&quot; according to Air Force historian Chris Coulthard-Clark, but morale was good.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> On 31 August, No. 12 Squadron launched its first patrol over the Darwin area, flown by one of seven Ansons that had so far been delivered.

He developed a good relationship with his Dutch personnel, who called him &quot;Oom Charles&quot; (Uncle Charles).<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a><a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a> Operating under the auspices of North Western Area Command (NWA), Darwin, Eaton's forces participated in the <a href="New_Guinea_campaign" title="wikilink">New Guinea</a> and <a href="North_Western_Area_Campaign" title="wikilink">North Western Area Campaigns</a> during 1944, in which he regularly flew on missions himself.<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a><a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a> Through March–April, his Beaufighters attacked enemy shipping, while the Mitchells and Beauforts bombed <a href="Timor" class="uri" title="wikilink">Timor</a> on a daily basis as a prelude to <a href="Operations_Reckless_and_Persecution" title="wikilink">Operations Reckless and Persecution</a>, the invasions of <a href="Hollandia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hollandia</a> and <a href="Aitape" class="uri" title="wikilink">Aitape</a>. On 19 April, he organised a large raid against <a href="South_Central_Timor_Regency" title="wikilink">Su</a>, Dutch Timor, employing thirty-five Mitchells, Beauforts and Beaufighters to destroy the town's barracks and fuel dumps, the results earning him the personal congratulations of the <a href="Air_Officer_Commanding" title="wikilink">Air Officer Commanding</a> NWA, Air Vice Marshal <a href="Adrian_Cole_(RAAF_officer)" title="wikilink">&quot;King&quot; Cole</a>, for his &quot;splendid effort&quot;.<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a><a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a> On the day of the Allied landings, 22 April, the Mitchells and Beaufighters made a daylight raid on <a href="Dili" class="uri" title="wikilink">Dili</a>, Portugese Timor. The ground assault met little opposition, credited in part to the air bombardment in the days leading up to it.<a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a> In June–July, No. 79 Wing supported the <a href="Battle_of_Noemfoor" title="wikilink">Allied attack on Noemfoor</a>.<a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a> Eaton was recommended to be <a href="Mentioned_in_Despatches" title="wikilink">Mentioned in Despatches</a> on 28 October 1944 for his &quot;Gallant and distinguished service&quot; in NWA; this was accepted and promulgated in the <em>London Gazette</em> on 9 March 1945.<a href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a><a href="#fn67" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a></p>
<p>Completing his tour with No. 79 Wing, Eaton was appointed Air Officer Commanding Southern Area, Melbourne, in January 1945. The German <a href="U-boat" class="uri" title="wikilink">U-boat</a> <a href="German_submarine_U-862" title="wikilink"><em>U-862</em></a> operated off southern Australia during the first months of 1945, and the small number of combat units in Eaton's command were heavily engaged in <a href="Anti-submarine_warfare" title="wikilink">anti-submarine patrols</a> which sought to locate this and any other U-boats in the area. The Air Officer Commanding RAAF Command, Air Vice Marshal <a href="William_Bostock" title="wikilink">Bill Bostock</a>, considered the sporadic attacks to be partly &quot;nuisance value&quot;, designed to draw Allied resources away from the front line of the South West Pacific war. In April, Eaton complained to Bostock that intelligence from <a href="British_Pacific_Fleet" title="wikilink">British Pacific Fleet</a> concerning its ships' movements eastwards out of Western Area was hours out of date by the time it was received at Southern Area Command, leading to RAAF aircraft missing their rendezvous and wasting valuable flying hours searching empty ocean. There had been no U-boat strikes since February, however, and by June the naval authorities indicated that the need for air cover was minor except for the most important vessels.<a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a></p>

He had seen an advertisement for the position and was the only applicant with experience of the area. While based there, he accompanied the provincial governor on visits to townships damaged in Allied raids during the war, taking care to be circumspect about the part played by his own forces from No. 79 Wing.<a href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a> In July 1947, Dutch forces launched a &quot;police action&quot; against territory held by the fledgling <a href="Indonesian_National_Revolution" title="wikilink">Indonesian Republic</a>, which had been declared shortly after the end of the war. Following a ceasefire, the <a href="United_Nations" title="wikilink">United Nations</a> set up a commission, chaired by Eaton as Consul-General, to monitor progress. Eaton and his fellow commissioners believed that the ceasefire was serving the Dutch as a cover for further penetration of republican enclaves. His requests to the Australian government for military observers led to deployment of the first peacekeeping force to the region; the Australians were soon followed by British and US observers, and enabled Eaton to display a more realistic impression of the situation to the outside world. The Dutch administration strongly opposed the presence of UN forces and accused Eaton of &quot;impropriety&quot;, but the Australian government refused to recall him.<a href="#fn72" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref72"><sup>72</sup></a> Following the transfer of sovereignty in December 1949, he became Australia's first secretary and <a href="charg&lt;U+00E9&gt;_d&#39;affaires" title="wikilink">charg&lt;U+00E9&gt; d'affaires</a> to the Republic of the United States of Indonesia.<a href="#fn73" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref73"><sup>73</sup></a> In 1950, he returned to Australia to serve with the Department of External Affairs in Canberra.<a href="#fn74" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref74"><sup>74</sup></a> After retiring from public service in 1951, he and his wife farmed at <a href="Metung,_Victoria" title="wikilink">Metung</a>, Victoria, and cultivated <a href="orchid" title="wikilink">orchids</a>.<a href="#fn75" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref75"><sup>75</sup></a><a href="#fn76" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref76"><sup>76</sup></a> They later moved to <a href="Frankston,_Victoria" title="wikilink">Frankston</a>, where Eaton was involved in promotional work.<a href="#fn77" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref77"><sup>77</sup></a></p>
<p>Charles Eaton died in Frankston on 12 November 1979. Survived by his wife and two sons, he was cremated. In accordance with his wishes, his ashes were scattered near Tennant Creek, site of his 1929 forced landing during the search for the <em>Kookaburra</em>, from an RAAF <a href="DHC-4_Caribou" title="wikilink">Caribou</a> on 15 April 1981.<a href="#fn78" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref78"><sup>78</sup></a><a href="#fn79" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref79"><sup>79</sup></a> His name figures prominently in the Northern Territory, commemorated by Lake Eaton in Central Australia, Eaton Place in the Darwin suburb of <a href="Karama,_Northern_Territory" title="wikilink">Karama</a>, Charles Eaton Drive on the approach to <a href="Darwin_International_Airport" title="wikilink">Darwin International Airport</a>, and the Charles Moth Eaton Saloon Bar in the Tennant Creek Goldfields Hotel.

Perhaps I might jog your memory to a more recent series of rescues no less hazardous for all concerned&lt;U+2014&gt;the amazing location of missing yachtsmen Thierry Dubois, <a href="Isabelle_Autissier" title="wikilink">Isabelle Autissier</a> and <a href="Tony_Bullimore" title="wikilink">Tony Bullimore</a> by our <a href="P-3_Orion" title="wikilink">P-3s</a> that guided the <a href="Royal_Australian_Navy" title="wikilink">Navy</a> to their eventual rescue.
