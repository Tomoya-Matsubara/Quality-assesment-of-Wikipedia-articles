<p>Born in northern <a href="New_South_Wales" title="wikilink">New South Wales</a>, Dowling entered the <a href="HMAS_Creswell" title="wikilink">Royal Australian Naval College</a> in 1915.

Following the cessation of hostilities, <em>Hobart</em> became flagship of HM Australian Squadron, and Dowling flag captain and chief of staff to Commodore <a href="John_Augustine_Collins" title="wikilink">John Collins</a>, the squadron commander.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a><a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> The war had taken a toll on Dowling's health, however, and he required leave before commencing his next appointment in May 1946 as Director of Ordnance, Torpedoes and Mines at the Navy Office.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a><a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> Rear Admiral <a href="James_Goldrick" title="wikilink">James Goldrick</a>, in the <em><a href="Australian_Dictionary_of_Biography" title="wikilink">Australian Dictionary of Biography</a></em>, observed that Dowling &quot;was thrust into the highest positions of the R.A.N. largely as a result of the heavy casualties of World War II&quot;. When John Armstrong—the only similarly qualified and more senior Navy captain—was pronounced unfit for seagoing duty, Dowling was given the chance to command Australia's first aircraft carrier, <a href="HMAS_Sydney_(R17)" title="wikilink">HMAS <em>Sydney</em></a>, commissioned in England on 16 December 1948.

<p>Dowling was an early advocate for the establishment of an Australian submarine fleet; it was not until 1963 however, after several false starts, that the first of six <a href="Oberon_class_submarine" title="wikilink"><em>Oberon</em> class submarines</a> were ordered.<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a><a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a> As part of a general Western trend that viewed with alarm the increasing capability of the <a href="Soviet_Navy" title="wikilink">Soviet Navy</a>'s surface fleet, Dowling also worked to improve the offensive power of the <a href="Fleet_Air_Arm_(RAN)" title="wikilink">Fleet Air Arm</a>. In March 1956 he went so far as proposing purchase of nuclear weaponry for the RAN's <a href="De_Havilland_Sea_Venom" title="wikilink">De Havilland Sea Venoms</a>. During much of Dowling's remaining time as CNS, faced with the obsolescence of HMAS <em>Sydney</em> and in accordance with its two-carrier policy, the Navy tried unsuccessfully to acquire a new and larger aircraft carrier to augment <a href="HMAS_Melbourne_(R21)" title="wikilink">HMAS <em>Melbourne</em></a>.<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a> Believing in the maintenance of traditionally close ties between the RAN and the Royal Navy, he worked to coordinate his policies as CNS with those of Britain's <a href="First_Sea_Lord" title="wikilink">First Sea Lord</a>, <a href="Louis_Mountbatten,_1st_Earl_Mountbatten_of_Burma" title="wikilink">Earl Mountbatten</a>.<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a><a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a> Taking into account the provisions of the <a href="ANZUS" class="uri" title="wikilink">ANZUS</a> treaty and the absence of suitable supplies from Britain, however, the RAN began to turn reluctantly towards the United States in terms of strategy and equipment,<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a> as Dowling explained to Mountbatten:</p>

<p>Other issues facing the RAN during Dowling's term as CNS were its relegation—since the beginning of the 1950s—to third place behind the other armed forces in terms of Federal budget allocations, its replacement by the RAAF as the country's first line of defence, and a shortage of manpower. Dowling himself considered &quot;separation from families, lack of houses, over employment, high wages and overtime payment in civvie street&quot; as the causes for the Navy's inability to attract and retain personnel; the Allison Report in 1958 resulted in various improvements to service conditions, which helped reduce wastage.<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a> The RANC had moved to Flinders Naval Depot in 1930, and Dowling was pleased to be able to oversee its return to Jervis Bay in 1958, the year before he relocated the office of the CNS to Canberra.<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a><a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a></p>

The position's rank remained the same as the heads of the Army, Navy and Air Force, and was only responsible for putting their views on military matters to the <a href="Minister_for_Defence_(Australia)" title="wikilink">Minister for Defence</a>.<a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a><a href="#fn69" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref69"><sup>69</sup></a> Other setbacks during his tenure included the Defence Department's decision—rescinded after his term—to disband the Fleet Air Arm, and the Federal government's failure to back him when he announced at a <a href="South_East_Asia_Treaty_Organization" title="wikilink">SEATO</a> press conference in March 1961 that Australia was prepared to intervene militarily in the <a href="Laotian_Civil_War" title="wikilink">second Laotian crisis</a> should it become necessary.<a href="#fn70" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a><a href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a> In September 1959, during the first Laotian crisis, the Australian government had authorised Dowling to commit &quot;an infantry battalion, a squadron of RAAF fighters, air transport, and two RAN destroyers&quot; to support US and SEATO forces, but no intervention took place.<a href="#fn72" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref72"><sup>72</sup></a></p>

<p>Dowling retired from the military on 27 May 1961 and was succeeded as Chairman of COSC by Air Marshal <a href="Frederick_Scherger" title="wikilink">Sir Frederick Scherger</a>.<a href="#fn73" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref73"><sup>73</sup></a><a href="#fn74" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref74"><sup>74</sup></a> Though keen to secure a diplomatic appointment, nothing was offered to him and, as a practising <a href="Church_of_England" title="wikilink">Anglican</a>, he instead busied himself with church affairs in Canberra. In July 1962, however, the government gave him responsibility for organising <a href="Elizabeth_II" title="wikilink">Queen Elizabeth II</a>'s upcoming royal tour.<a href="#fn75" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref75"><sup>75</sup></a> In this role he was required to liaise with the state governments to plan the Queen's itinerary, and to become a member of the royal household for the duration of the tour, the first time an Australian tour planner had been given such close access to a visiting monarch.<a href="#fn76" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref76"><sup>76</sup></a> He was rewarded with appointment as a <a href="Knight_Commander_of_the_Royal_Victorian_Order" title="wikilink">Knight Commander of the Royal Victorian Order</a> (KCVO) as of 27 March 1963, and became Australian Secretary to the Queen on 1 November the same year.<a href="#fn77" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref77"><sup>77</sup></a><a href="#fn78" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref78"><sup>78</sup></a> Dowling was also the <a href="Australian_Red_Cross" title="wikilink">Australian Red Cross Society</a>'s Canberra chairman from 1962 to 1967; at the time he took over the chairmanship, Lady Dowling was acting president of the organisation, in the absence of <a href="William_Oliver_(British_Army_officer)" title="wikilink">Lady William Oliver</a>.<a href="#fn79" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref79"><sup>79</sup></a><a href="#fn80" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref80"><sup>80</sup></a> Roy Dowling died of a <a href="coronary_occlusion" title="wikilink">heart attack</a> on 15 April 1969 in <a href="Canberra_Hospital" title="wikilink">Canberra Hospital</a>. He was given a naval funeral at <a href="St_John_the_Baptist_Church,_Reid" title="wikilink">St John's Church</a>, and cremated.
