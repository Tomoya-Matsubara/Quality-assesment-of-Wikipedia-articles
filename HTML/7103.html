<p><img src="Prokudin-Gorskii-25.jpg" title="fig:Railroad bridge on the Trans-Siberian across the Kama River near Perm." alt="Railroad bridge on the Trans-Siberian across the Kama River near Perm." width="300" /> The <strong>Eurasian Land Bridge</strong>, sometimes called the <strong>New Silk Road</strong>, is a term used to describe the <a href="rail_transport" title="wikilink">rail transport</a> route for moving freight and/or passengers overland from <a href="Pacific_Ocean" title="wikilink">Pacific</a> seaports in eastern <a href="Russia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Russia</a> and mainland <a href="People&#39;s_Republic_of_China" title="wikilink">China</a> to seaports in <a href="Europe" class="uri" title="wikilink">Europe</a>. The route comprises the <a href="Trans-Siberian_Railway" title="wikilink">Trans-Siberian Railway</a>, which runs through Russia and is sometimes called the <a href="Northern_East_West_Freight_Corridor" title="wikilink">Northern East-West Corridor</a>, and the New Eurasian Land Bridge or Second Eurasian Continental Bridge, running through China and <a href="Kazakhstan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kazakhstan</a>.</p>
<p>Completed in 1916, the Trans-Siberian connects <a href="Moscow" class="uri" title="wikilink">Moscow</a> with Russian Pacific seaports such as <a href="Vladivostok" class="uri" title="wikilink">Vladivostok</a>. From the 1960s until the early 1990s the railroad served as the primary land bridge between Asia and Europe, until several issues caused the use of the railway for transcontinental freight to dwindle. On issue is the railways of the former <a href="Union_of_Soviet_Socialist_Republics" title="wikilink">Union of Soviet Socialist Republics</a> (USSR) use a wider rail gauge than most of the rest of Europe and China. Recently, however, the Trans-Siberian has regained ground as a viable land route between the two continents.</p>
<p>In 1990 China linked its rail system to the Trans-Siberian via Kazakhstan, allowing freight from China to travel by rail to Europe. China calls it's uninterrupted rail link between the Chinese port city of <a href="Lianyungang" class="uri" title="wikilink">Lianyungang</a> and Kazakhstan the New Eurasian Land Bridge or Second Eurasian Continental Bridge. In addition to Kazakhstan, the railways connect with other countries in Central Asia, including Iran, but do not connect all the way to Europe through south Asia.</p>
<p>Proposed expansion of the Eurasian Land Bridge includes construction of a railway across Kazakhstan that is the same gauge as Chinese railways, rail links to <a href="India" class="uri" title="wikilink">India</a>, <a href="Myanmar" class="uri" title="wikilink">Myanmar</a>, <a href="Thailand" class="uri" title="wikilink">Thailand</a>, and <a href="Malaysia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Malaysia</a>, and construction of a rail tunnel or bridge across the <a href="Bering_Strait" title="wikilink">Bering Strait</a> to connect the Trans-Siberian to the <a href="North_America" title="wikilink">North American</a> rail system. The <a href="United_Nations" title="wikilink">United Nations</a> and <a href="LaRouche_movement" title="wikilink">LaRouche movement</a> have advocated further development of the Eurasian Land Bridge.</p>
<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>Commercial traffic between Europe and East Asia took place along the <a href="Silk_Road" title="wikilink">Silk Road</a> from at least the 2nd millennium <a href="Common_Era" title="wikilink">BCE</a>. The Silk Road was not a specific thoroughfare, but a general route used by traders to travel, much of it by land, between the two continents.,<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>Traffic along the route began to diminish with the development of the sea route around the <a href="Cape_of_Good_Hope" title="wikilink">Cape of Good Hope</a> in the 16th Century. By the 18th century, European influence on trade and new national boundries severely restricted the movement of traders along land routes between Europe and China, and overland trade between East Asia and Europe virtually disappeared.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="trans-siberian-railway">Trans-Siberian Railway</h2>
<p><img src="Map_Trans-Siberian_railway.png" title="fig:Map of the Trans-Siberian Railway" alt="Map of the Trans-Siberian Railway" /> The Trans-Siberian Railway and its various associated branches and supporting lines, completed in 1916, established the first rail connection between Europe and Asia, from Moscow to Vladivostok. The line, at , is the longest rail line in the world.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>Currently, the Trans-Siberian connects <a href="Pyongyang" class="uri" title="wikilink">Pyongyang</a>, <a href="Vladivostok" class="uri" title="wikilink">Vladivostok</a>, and <a href="Nakhodka" class="uri" title="wikilink">Nakhodka</a> with Moscow. Rail links at Moscow allow passengers and freight to connect to train lines running further west into Europe. By making further transfers, passengers and freight can eventually reach western European seaports.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>Former countries of the USSR use a track gauge of . The international standard rail gauge used in most of Europe and China is . As a result, trains cannot run from China or European countries into or out of the former USSR without <a href="Break-of-gauge" title="wikilink">changing bogies</a>. Changing the <a href="bogie" title="wikilink">bogies</a> on a rail car takes 5-6 hours and special, heavy equipment. In many cases, freight is transshipped from one train to another instead of changing the bogies. In the case of liquids, frozen goods, and hazardous materials, however, the bogies are usually changed.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>Originally built to allow the Soviet government to project political power into its territories in Asia, in the 1960s the USSR opened the Trans-Siberian as an international trade route connecting the western Pacific with Europe. Problems with shipping freight along the Trans-Siberian, however, including backlogs at the Russian Pacific ports caused by dilapidated rail infrastructures, theft, damaged freight, late trains, inflated freight fees, uncertain scheduling for return of containers, and geopolitical tension reduced the use of the route for international trade to almost zero by the 1990s.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p>According to <a href="Hofstra_University" title="wikilink">Hofstra University</a>, there is presently renewed interest in using the Trans-Siberian as a route across Asia to Europe. An advantage of the Trans-Siberian route over the China-Central Asian rail route (detailed below) is that trains must change bogies only once, at the borders of the former USSR.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> Also, the Trans-Siberian links directly to railroads which ultimately connect, via <a href="Finland" class="uri" title="wikilink">Finland</a> and <a href="Sweden" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sweden</a>, to the year-round ice-free port of <a href="Narvik" class="uri" title="wikilink">Narvik</a> in <a href="Norway" class="uri" title="wikilink">Norway</a>. At Narvik, freight can be transshipped to ships to cross the Atlantic to North America. Total transit time between Vladivostok and <a href="New_York_City" title="wikilink">New York City</a> using this route is reportedly 10 days. Rail links from Russia also connect to <a href="Rotterdam" class="uri" title="wikilink">Rotterdam</a>, but may encounter greater congestion along this route with resulting delays.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p>In an effort to attract use of the Trans-Siberian to transport goods from Japan, China, and Korea to Europe, in the mid-1990s Russia lowered tariffs on freight using the railway. As a result, freight volume over the rail line doubled in 1999 and 2000.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>

The section between <a href="&lt;U+00DC&gt;r&lt;U+00FC&gt;mqi" class="uri" title="wikilink">&lt;U+00DC&gt;r&lt;U+00FC&gt;mqi</a> and <a href="Alashankou_Railway_Station" title="wikilink">Alashankou</a> was completed on September 16, 1990, linking the train lines of the two countries at <a href="Dostyk" class="uri" title="wikilink">Dostyk</a>. In July 1991 the first freight train traveled along the line from China to Kazakhstan's then-capital of <a href="Almaty" class="uri" title="wikilink">Almaty</a>.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> Because Kazakhstan was once a member of the USSR, its train system connects with and carries the same rail gauge as the Russian rail system, as well as the other central Asian republics of <a href="Turkmenistan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Turkmenistan</a>, <a href="Uzbekistan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Uzbekistan</a>, <a href="Kyrgyzstan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kyrgyzstan</a>, and <a href="Tajikistan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tajikistan</a>.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<p>From Kazakhstan, three north-south railways connect with the Russian rail system. Two connect with the Trans-Siberian railway while the other goes directly to <a href="Moscow" class="uri" title="wikilink">Moscow</a>. These links to the Russian rail system are sometimes called the Eurasian Railway.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<p>In January 2008 China and Germany inaugurated a long distance freight train service between Beijing and <a href="Hamburg" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hamburg</a>. Traveling a total of , the train uses the China Railways, Inner Mongolia line to connect to <a href="Ulan_Bator" title="wikilink">Ulan Bator</a>, where it then continues north to the Trans-Siberian. After reaching the end of the Trans-Siberian at Moscow, the train continues to Germany via rail links in <a href="Belarus" class="uri" title="wikilink">Belarus</a> and <a href="Poland" class="uri" title="wikilink">Poland</a>. Total transit time is 15 days, as opposed to the 30 days average it would take for the freight to make the same journey by ship. The first train, carrying a mixed load of clothes, ceramics, and electronics, traveled on tracks operated by six different railways.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> <a href="Hartmut_Mehdorn" title="wikilink">Hartmut Mehdorn</a>, chairman of <a href="Deutsche_Bahn" title="wikilink">Deutsche Bahn</a>, stated that regularly scheduled China-Germany freight services should be in operation by 2010.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="new-eurasian-land-bridge">New Eurasian Land Bridge</h3>
<p>The New Eurasian Land Bridge, also called the New Eurasian Continental Bridge, is the name given to China's rail link with central Asia.

Together, the railways create an uninterrupted rail link between the port city of <a href="Lianyungang" class="uri" title="wikilink">Lianyungang</a> and Kazakhstan. In 1995 the Chinese and Kazakhstan governments signed an agreement which allows the latter to use Lianyungang as its primary seaport for exports and imports.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> China intends for Lianyungang to serve as the designated starting point for the New Eurasian Land Bridge.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>

The link with Kazakhstan is at the upper left corner of the map." /> On March 10, 2004 Kazakhstan Railway Co., Ltd announced that it was looking for investors to fund the construction of a railway stretching  from China across Kazakhstan that would be the same gauge as Chinese railways. Thus, the railway would allow trains from China to cross Kazakhstan without having to change bogies. The reported construction cost of the new railway was $3.5 billion. Chinese media reported that the railway would complete the link between China and Europe via central Asia, but it is unclear where the actual link to Europe would be. Also unclear is whether construction has yet to begin on the project.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a></p>
<p>The governments of <a href="India" class="uri" title="wikilink">India</a> and <a href="Myanmar" class="uri" title="wikilink">Myanmar</a> have proposed building, with China's cooperation, a link to the Eurasian Land Bridge that would start in India and/or Myanmar and connect to China's rail system in <a href="Yunnan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Yunnan</a>.
