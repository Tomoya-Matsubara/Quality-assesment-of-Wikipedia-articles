<p><strong>Oxley</strong> is a community on the lower Lachlan River in the Riverina district of New South Wales, Australia.  It is located near the junction of the Lachlan and Murrumbidgee rivers.  The township which developed in the mid 1860s was named after the noted Australian explorer, <a href="John_Oxley" title="wikilink">John Oxley</a>.</p>

<p>In about the mid-1840s Phelps and Chadwick took up a run on the lower Lachlan which they called &quot;Thelangerin West&quot;.  In 1848 the lease was purchased by Thomas D'Archy who re-named the run &quot;Oxley&quot;, and called the station homestead &quot;Oxley House&quot;.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>Opposite the &lt;U+201C&gt;Oxley&lt;U+201D&gt; run on the north bank of the Lachlan River was the &lt;U+201C&gt;Tupra&lt;U+201D&gt; run, held by the Tyson brothers since the 1840s.  By the 1860s it was held solely by James Tyson.</p>

<p>In the mid-1860s the squatter James Tyson saw a business opportunity and built a hotel at a new township which was developing at a crossing-place over the river on his &lt;U+201C&gt;Tupra&lt;U+201D&gt; run.  A report in the <em>Pastoral Times</em> newspaper in November 1866 stated that &lt;U+201C&gt;Mr. Tyson has built a brick hotel&lt;U+201D&gt; which was to be opened shortly at the &lt;U+201C&gt;new township of Oxley&lt;U+201D&gt;.  The report added: &lt;U+201C&gt;There is not much traffic past the house, and very few men in the neighborhood, so the prospects of doing a good trade are not very encouraging&lt;U+201D&gt;.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p><img src="OxleyLachlanRiverBridge.JPG" title="fig:Bridge over the Lachlan River" alt="Bridge over the Lachlan River" width="250" /> In December 1866 it was reported that a petition was to be sent to Government &lt;U+201C&gt;to place a sum of money on the estimates to build a bridge at a point of the Lachlan River, about eight miles above the government township of Oxley, which is opposite Mr. D'Archy's station&lt;U+201D&gt;.  The report added that &lt;U+201C&gt;there is a boat there at present, which is a great convenience to persons travelling&lt;U+201D&gt;.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>A Government land-sale, which included lots at Oxley township, was held at <a href="Hay,_New_South_Wales" title="wikilink">Hay</a> on 9 March 1868.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>Tyson&lt;U+2019&gt;s brick hotel was called the Oxley Hotel; during 1869 Thomas Donahee was recorded as the licensee.  In April 1870 at the Hay Police Court Daniel Murphy, &lt;U+201C&gt;formerly of <a href="Maude,_New_South_Wales" title="wikilink">Maude</a>&lt;U+201D&gt;, applied for a license for the Oxley Hotel (which was subsequently granted).  In December 1870 George Carter was successful in his application for a license for a second public-house at Oxley, called the Stockman&lt;U+2019&gt;s Hotel.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>George Carter remained publican of the Stockman&lt;U+2019&gt;s Hotel at Oxley until 1872 when he apparently closed his establishment to carry on the nearby Paika Creek Hotel at Paika Creek.  The Oxley Hotel was once again the sole public-house at the township; Daniel Murphy remained publican until 1874.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p>In June 1874 the publican's license for the Oxley Hotel was transferred from Daniel Murphy to John Murphy.  The ownership of the Oxley Hotel apparently remained in the hands of James Tyson (with the various publicans leasing the hotel).  In January 1875 advertisements were placed in the <em>Riverine Grazier</em> newspaper by Tyson&lt;U+2019&gt;s nephew, James Tyson Jnr., seeking a &lt;U+201C&gt;respectable tenant&lt;U+201D&gt; for the Oxley Hotel.  A month later it was reported that John Murphy&lt;U+2019&gt;s license for the Oxley Hotel was to be transferred to Mr. Robert Jackson.  Jackson was the publican of the Oxley Hotel during 1875 to 1877.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p><img src="OxleyAnglicanChurch.JPG" title="fig:St Barnabas Anglican Church, Oxley" alt="St Barnabas Anglican Church, Oxley" width="250" /> In 1878 Michael Joseph Delandre took over the license.  Delandre had previously been a policeman, stationed at Maude.  A traveller to Oxley in early 1879 reported that &lt;U+201C&gt;Mr. Delandre&lt;U+2026&gt; runs a hotel business with a little storekeeping combined&lt;U+201D&gt;.  The Oxley Hotel was described as &lt;U+201C&gt;one of the most comfortable and cleanly roadside houses I have met with; the building is substantial and commodious&lt;U+201D&gt;.  The writer reported that Delandre &lt;U+201C&gt;with an eye to business, is constructing a pontoon bridge, which he intends laying across the river in front of his house&lt;U+201D&gt;.  He added: &quot;In his undertaking [Delandre] deserves support and success, for the bridge will be a great boon to travelling stock, and also to the passengers from Hay to Balranald, as Messrs. Cobb and Co. will run coaches between those towns as soon as the bridge is completed, whereas at present the mails are carried on horseback&quot;.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1881 Oxley township once again had two hotels when the Royal Hotel was opened with John Westhead as the publican.  In 1882 there was a re-shuffle of publicans as Delandre left the Oxley Hotel to be replaced by William Westhead, and Daniel Murphy took over the license of the Royal.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<p>In about 1888 the Royal Hotel had ceased trading at Oxley.  In 1889 a license was granted to Thompson S. Page for a new public-house at the township, the Commercial Hotel (possibly a name-change of the old Royal Hotel premises).  In 1889 the publican of the Oxley Hotel was John Parr.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1890 &quot;Oxley&quot; station was purchased by the A.M.L.&amp;F. Company.  R.P. McFarland purchased &quot;Oxley&quot; station in 1912.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
