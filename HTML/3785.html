<p><strong>History</strong></p>
<p>The Gardens are very old, being designed in 1829 by <a href="J._C._Loudon" title="wikilink">J. C. Loudon</a>, a leading garden planner, horticultural journalist and publisher. The Gardens opened to the public in 1832.</p>
<p>The layout of the Botanical Gardens has changed very little since Loudon first designed it. There are four glasshouses which range from the exotic Tropical glasshouse, through to the Subtropical, Mediterranean and Arid Houses. There is a large lawn in front of the glasshouses with a range of beds and shrubberies around its perimeter. Overall, the character is that of a <a href="Victorian_era" title="wikilink">Victorian</a> public park with a <a href="bandstand" class="uri" title="wikilink">bandstand</a> set in  of landscaped greenery. It is hard to believe that the beautiful and tranquil Gardens are located just one and a half miles from the centre of Birmingham.</p>
<p><strong>Plants</strong> <img src="Juniperus_chinensis_bonsai.jpg" title="fig:The &quot;Omiya tree&quot; &lt;U+2013&gt; see text" alt="The &quot;Omiya tree&quot; &lt;U+2013&gt; see text" /> The Gardens contain over 7,000 different plants and are home to The British National <a href="Bonsai" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bonsai</a> Collection. One of the oldest specimens is the &quot;Omiya tree&quot;, a 250 year old <em><a href="Juniperus_chinensis" title="wikilink">Juniperus chinensis</a></em> in the informal upright style, presented to the collection in 1995 by the then <a href="&lt;U+014C&gt;miya,_Saitama" title="wikilink">city of Omiya</a>, <a href="Japan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Japan</a>. There are many unusual and notable plants in the gardens including two fine <a href="Cedrus_deodara" title="wikilink">Himalayan Cedars</a> near the fountain which were planted from seeds given to the gardens in the 1840s by James Watt Junior, son of <a href="James_Watt" title="wikilink">James Watt</a> whose improvements to the <a href="Newcomen_steam_engine" title="wikilink">Newcomen steam engine</a> were fundamental to the changes brought by the <a href="Industrial_Revolution" title="wikilink">Industrial Revolution</a>. A plant found nowhere else is the fern entitled <em>Dicksonia lathamii</em> which is a <a href="hybrid" class="uri" title="wikilink">hybrid</a> fern between <em>Dicksonia antartica</em> and <em>Dicksonia arborescens</em> raised by ex-Curator W. B. Latham more than one hundred years ago.</p>
