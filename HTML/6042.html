<p><strong>St Margaret's Church</strong> (dedicated in full to <strong>St Margaret of Antioch</strong>) is an <a href="Anglicanism" title="wikilink">Anglican</a> church in the village of <a href="West_Hoathly" title="wikilink">West Hoathly</a> in <a href="Mid_Sussex" title="wikilink">Mid Sussex</a>, one of seven <a href="Districts_of_England" title="wikilink">local government districts</a> in the <a href="England" title="wikilink">English</a> county of <a href="West_Sussex" title="wikilink">West Sussex</a>. By the late 11th century, a simple single-room stone building existed on the high, open ridge upon which the village developed. A series of medieval expansions doubled its size by the 15th century, and the present building has changed little since then&lt;U+2014&gt;despite a <a href="Victorian_restoration" title="wikilink">Victorian restoration</a> overseen by architect <a href="Richard_Carpenter_(architect)" title="wikilink">R.H. Carpenter</a>. A major addition was the heavily <a href="buttress" title="wikilink">buttressed</a> <a href="English_Gothic_architecture#Perpendicular_Gothic" title="wikilink">Perpendicular Gothic</a> west tower, topped with a tall <a href="broach_spire" title="wikilink">broach spire</a> and containing a peal of ancient bells. The large, steeply terraced churchyard also serves as a public cemetery and has far-reaching views across the <a href="Weald" class="uri" title="wikilink">Weald</a>. The original dedication to <a href="Margaret_the_Virgin" title="wikilink">Saint Margaret of Antioch</a> fell out of use for many centuries until a researcher rediscovered it. The church serves a large rural parish which was reduced in size in 1882 when two residents of the <a href="Hamlet_(place)" title="wikilink">hamlet</a> of Highbrook paid for an additional church to be built there. <a href="English_Heritage" title="wikilink">English Heritage</a> has <a href="Listed_building" title="wikilink">listed</a> it at Grade I for its architectural and historical importance.</p>

One extension, described in 1935 as &quot;recent&quot;, brought an artificial cave, possibly of medieval origin, into its boundaries. It is hewn out of the rock near the floor of the valley above which the churchyard sits.<a href="#fn93" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref93"><sup>93</sup></a></p>
<p>An ancient Sussex custom, also encountered at a few other churches nearby (such as those at <a href="All_Saints_Church,_Lindfield" title="wikilink">Lindfield</a> and <a href="St_Peter&#39;s_Church,_Ardingly" title="wikilink">Ardingly</a>), applied for many years at West Hoathly: every landowner in the parish was responsible for the upkeep of a specific section of the churchyard wall. Each person was listed and the piece of wall they had to maintain was marked. A list dated 1752 survives, showing 60 landowners' names. Some parts of the wall still have initials and dates inscribed upon them.<a href="#fn94" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref94"><sup>94</sup></a><a href="#fn95" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref95"><sup>95</sup></a></p>
<p>As well as serving the church, the churchyard is licensed as a public burial ground. The <a href="Diocese_of_Chichester" title="wikilink">Diocese of Chichester</a> does not directly manage it: instead it is looked after by the Parochial Church Council, who (along with the Friends of the Churchyard Trust, an independent body) pay for maintenance and improvements. The <a href="Heritage_Lottery_Fund" title="wikilink">Heritage Lottery Fund</a> awarded the church a grant in 1996 to restore many of the ancient tombs.<a href="#fn96" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref96"><sup>96</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="bells">Bells</h2>
<p>The church has a peal of five ancient bells. They bear inscriptions as follows (bell 1 is the tenor bell):<a href="#fn97" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref97"><sup>97</sup></a></p>

<li><p>{{#tag:ref|<a href="Richard_Phelps_(bell-founder)" title="wikilink">Richard Phelps</a>  was master of the <a href="Whitechapel_Bell_Foundry" title="wikilink">Whitechapel Bell Foundry</a> in London from 1701 until 1738.<a href="#fn98" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref98"><sup>98</sup></a> He also cast bell 3.<a href="#fn99" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref99"><sup>99</sup></a>|group=note}}</p></li>

<p>The wording &quot;Joseph Carter made me better&quot; suggests that bell 4 was restored in 1581 rather than being newly cast in that year.<a href="#fn100" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref100"><sup>100</sup></a> A reference to a bell in a will of 1554, when John Bryan wrote &quot;Also I bequeth unto the church of Westhothleygh to the casting of a bell vj s viij d&quot;,{{#tag:ref|i.e. six <a href="Shilling_(English_coin)" title="wikilink">shillings</a> and <a href="Penny_(British_pre-decimal_coin)" title="wikilink">eightpence</a>, or 80 old pence.|group=note}} may refer to bell 2,<a href="#fn101" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref101"><sup>101</sup></a> which was cast in the early 16th century by Thomas Bullisdon, another London-based bell-founder.<a href="#fn102" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref102"><sup>102</sup></a> A sixth bell was added in the 20th century.<a href="#fn103" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref103"><sup>103</sup></a><a href="#fn104" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref104"><sup>104</sup></a></p>
