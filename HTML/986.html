<p>In the 8th century B.C., <a href="Assyria" class="uri" title="wikilink">Assyria</a> was the superpower of the world. The smaller nations of <a href="Syria" class="uri" title="wikilink">Syria</a> (often called Aram) and the Northern <a href="Kingdom_of_Israel" title="wikilink">Kingdom of Israel</a> (often called <a href="Ephraim" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ephraim</a> because of the main tribe) formed a coalition in defense against the oncoming threat. They had previously been tributary nations to Assyria, and they finally decided to break away. The Southern Kingdom of <a href="Judah" class="uri" title="wikilink">Judah</a>, under King <a href="Ahaz" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ahaz</a>, was loyal to Assyria and refused to join the coalition. In 735 B.C. Syria, under Rezin, and Israel, under <a href="Pekah" class="uri" title="wikilink">Pekah</a>, attempted to dispose Ahaz through an invasion. Judah was being defeated and lost 120,000 troops in just one day. Many significant officials were killed and even the king's son was killed. Many others were taken away as slaves.</p>
<p>At the same time of the invasion, the <a href="Philistines" class="uri" title="wikilink">Philistines</a> and <a href="Edomites" class="uri" title="wikilink">Edomites</a> were taking advantage of the situation and raiding towns and villages. Ahaz called out to <a href="Tiglath-Pileser_III" title="wikilink">Tiglath-Pileser III</a> of Assyria for help. Rather than coming to help, he brought more trouble for Ahaz. Ahaz had to pay him with treasures from the Temple and the royal treasury. Eventually Assyria conquered both Syria and Israel.</p>
<h3 id="the-immanuel-child">The Immanuel Child</h3>
<p>The <a href="Immanuel" class="uri" title="wikilink">Immanuel</a> child of the book of <a href="Isaiah" class="uri" title="wikilink">Isaiah</a> is closely related to the Syro-Ephraimite War. In chapters 7-12, Isaiah narrates the Syro-Ephraimite War. He tells King Ahaz that the invasion will be unsuccessful and tells him to ask God for a sign. Ahaz, in his stubborn pride, refuses to ask God for a sign. Isaiah tells him that God will give a sign despite Ahaz's refusal. He says that the sign will be that <em>&quot;The virgin will be with child and will give birth to a son, and will call him Immanuel. He will eat curds and honey when he knows enough to reject the wrong and choose the right. But before the boy knows enough to reject the wrong and choose the right, the land of the two kings you dread will be laid waste</em> (Isaiah 7:14-16). Isaiah also says that because Ahaz trusted in Assyria, God will bring the king of Assyria to the gates of Jerusalem.</p>
<p>In Chapter 8, the prophecy is fulfilled. Isaiah sleeps with a young woman (the Hebrew word here, <em>&lt;U+00E1&gt;hmah</em> means a sexually ripe or mature woman, not the modern usage of the word virgin) and she conceives. The child is Maher-Shalal-Hash-Baz. God tells Isaiah that before this child can speak, Assyria will plunder Syria and Israel. It is obvious that Maher-Shalal-Hash-Baz is the Immanuel child (although the title is also applied to <a href="Jesus_Christ" title="wikilink">Jesus Christ</a> in the <a href="New_Testament" title="wikilink">New Testament</a>).</p>
