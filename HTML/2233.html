<p><a href="Lieutenant_Commander" title="wikilink">Lieutenant Commander</a> <strong><a href="John_Cyril_Porte" title="wikilink">John Cyril Porte</a></strong> RN <a href="Order_of_St_Michael_and_St_George" title="wikilink">CMG</a> US <a href="Distinguished_Conduct_Medal" title="wikilink">DCM</a> (<a href="26_February" title="wikilink">26 February</a> <a href="1884" class="uri" title="wikilink">1884</a> - <a href="22_October" title="wikilink">22 October</a> <a href="1919" class="uri" title="wikilink">1919</a><a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>) was a <a href="flying_boat" title="wikilink">flying boat</a> pioneer associated with the <a href="World_War_I" title="wikilink">World War I</a> <a href="Seaplane_Experimental_Station" title="wikilink">Seaplane Experimental Station</a> at <a href="Felixstowe" class="uri" title="wikilink">Felixstowe</a>.</p>
<p>At an early age Porte joined the <a href="Royal_Navy" title="wikilink">Royal Navy</a> submarine service, but contracted <a href="tuberculosis" class="uri" title="wikilink">tuberculosis</a> and was discharged in 1911. Instead he learnt to fly and participated in air races, before becoming interested in flying boats. He met American aircraft designer <a href="Glenn_Curtiss" title="wikilink">Glenn Curtiss</a> at <a href="Magnus_Volk" title="wikilink">Volk's</a> Seaplane Base at <a href="Brighton" class="uri" title="wikilink">Brighton</a>, and they worked together on a design in the USA for the &quot;<a href="Curtiss_Model_H" title="wikilink">America</a>&quot; flying boat, in which they intended to cross the Atlantic, but the commencement of hostilities in 1914 stopped this plan.</p>
<h2 id="war-service">War service</h2>
<p>His health not withstanding, he returned to England and was recommissioned a <a href="Wing_Commander_(rank)" title="wikilink">Wing Commander</a> in the <a href="Royal_Naval_Air_Service" title="wikilink">Royal Naval Air Service</a> and given command of a training unit in <a href="Hendon" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hendon</a> and later the <a href="Seaplane_Experimental_Station" title="wikilink">naval air base</a> at <a href="Felixstowe" class="uri" title="wikilink">Felixstowe</a>. While in this position he encouraged the purchase of <a href="Curtiss_Aeroplane_and_Motor_Company" title="wikilink">Curtiss</a> <a href="Curtiss_H-4" title="wikilink">H-4</a> flying boats, a military version of their earlier twin 100 h.p. &quot;America&quot; flying boat design. These early flying boats did not have sufficient power, and were soon re-engined with <a href="Anzani" class="uri" title="wikilink">Anzani</a> powerplants. More Curtiss aircraft were ordered, but their 160 h.p. Curtiss engines were soon replaced with 250 h.p. <a href="Rolls-Royce_Falcon" title="wikilink">Rolls-Royce Falcon</a> engines, being known as <a href="Curtiss_H-12" title="wikilink">H-12s</a> or 'Large Americas'.</p>
<p>Porte's first design to be implemented in Felixstowe was the <a href="Felixstowe_Porte_Baby" title="wikilink">Felixstowe Porte Baby</a>, a large, three-engined <a href="biplane" class="uri" title="wikilink">biplane</a> flying-boat powered by one central pusher and two outboard tractor <a href="Rolls-Royce_Eagle" title="wikilink">Rolls-Royce Eagle</a> engines.</p>
<p>Porte modified an H-4 with a new hull whose improved hydrodynamic qualities made taxiing, take-off and landing much more practical, and called it the <a href="Felixstowe_F.1" title="wikilink">Felixstowe F.1</a>. Porte then modified the hull of the larger <a href="Curtiss_H12" title="wikilink">Curtiss H12</a> flying boat, creating the <a href="Felixstowe_F.2" title="wikilink">Felixstowe F.2</a>, which was greatly superior to the original Curtiss boat. Under his supervision the Seaplane Experimental Station continued to enlarge and improve the design of the Felixstowe aircraft independently of Curtiss, through the <a href="Felixstowe_F.3" title="wikilink">F.3</a> and the <a href="Felixstowe_F.5" title="wikilink">F.5</a>; Porte's final design was the 123' span five-engined <a href="Felixstowe_Fury" title="wikilink">Felixstowe Fury</a> triplane (also known as the &quot;Porte Super-Baby&quot;).</p>

<p>The Felixstowes were mainly used on long range patrols to look for the German fleet or submarines, however the aircraft were also initially used successfully to intercept Zeppelins. To keep away from this danger Zeppelins were forced to fly higher, resulting in Porte developing the first <a href="Parasite_aircraft" title="wikilink">composite aircraft</a> experiments in 1916, with a Porte Baby carrying a small <a href="Bristol_Scout" title="wikilink">Bristol Scout</a> fighter piggyback. The flying boat would provide the long range while the fighter would be able to climb rapidly to engage the enemy. Porte successfully flew the Baby launch craft in its one and only trial flight, and, although the parasite was successfully released, the scheme was abandoned as impractical for <a href="North_Sea" title="wikilink">North Sea</a> conditions<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Several hundred seaplanes of Porte's design were built for war-time patrolling the east coast of England, for naval reconnaissance around the <a href="Mediterranean_Sea" title="wikilink">Mediterranean Sea</a>, and were even sold to the US for coast patrols. Armed with torpedoes and depth charges they could attack ships and <a href="U-boats" class="uri" title="wikilink">U-boats</a>. A measure of of the success of Porte's work is that the <a href="Curtiss_Aeroplane_and_Motor_Company" title="wikilink">Curtiss Aeroplane and Motor Company</a> manufactured the F.5 as the <a href="Felixstowe_F5L" title="wikilink">F5L and Aeromarine 75</a>.</p>
<p>In November 1917 Porte and William Augustus Casson were indicted in London's Central Criminal Court on charges of profiteering under the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1906. Before the war, Porte had arranged to receive a 20-25% commission on all Curtiss flying boats that he sold. Porte continued to receive monies secretly through Casson, as a commission agent, when he was in the position of ordering aircraft on behalf of the Navy, and was accused of receiving &lt;U+00A3&gt;48,000 in this manner<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a>. Casson was found guilty but, on the return of the money, charges against Porte were dropped in light on his failing health and important war service<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a>.</p>
<h2 id="death">Death</h2>
<p>Porte was in <a href="Brighton" class="uri" title="wikilink">Brighton</a> in 1919 when his tuberculosis at last overcame him and he died on 22 October. He is buried in <a href="West_Norwood_Cemetery" title="wikilink">West Norwood Cemetery</a> where his monument is a cross and anchor.</p>
<p>Sir Walter Raleigh, quoted in <a href="Flight_International" title="wikilink">Flight Magazine</a> in 1955, summed up the importance of Porte's work during the <a href="First_World_War" title="wikilink">First World War</a> as follows: &quot;The shortest possible list of those who saved the country in its hour of need would have to include his name.&quot; <a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>He was not quite 36 when he died.</p>
