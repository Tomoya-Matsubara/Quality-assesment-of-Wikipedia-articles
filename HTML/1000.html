The idea of Skat Kat came from the <a href="Gene_Kelly" title="wikilink">Gene Kelly</a> movie <em><a href="Anchors_Aweigh_(film)" title="wikilink">Anchors Aweigh</a></em>, in which Kelly's character dances with Jerry, the mouse from the <em><a href="Tom_and_Jerry" title="wikilink">Tom and Jerry</a></em> cartoon series. He was animated by members of the <a href="Walt_Disney_Animation_Studios" title="wikilink">Disney</a> animation team, working outside the studio between major projects, under the direction of <a href="Chris_Bailey_(animator)" title="wikilink">Chris Bailey</a>.</p>
<p>The character released an album entitled <em><a href="The_Adventures_of_MC_Skat_Kat_and_the_Stray_Mob" title="wikilink">The Adventures of MC Skat Kat and the Stray Mob</a></em> in 1991. Several of the songs made reference to Paula Abdul, but she did not provide vocals (except for the intro in &quot;On the Prowl&quot;); she did, however, make an appearance in the video of &quot;<a href="Skat_Strut" title="wikilink">Skat Strut</a>&quot;,<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> the only single to be released. Despite the popularity of its music video (it became one of the most requested on <a href="MTV" class="uri" title="wikilink">MTV</a>), the video never made an impact on any US Billboard chart. The release of the album flopped quickly after being issued in that same year.</p>

It premiered on MTV on April 10, 1991 (National Recycling Day), appeared as a trailer at AMC movie theaters, and was distributed on VHS and CD. It was later shown occasionally on <a href="Sesame_Street" title="wikilink">Sesame Street</a> during the early 1990s, although no Sesame Street characters were present. The video also appeared once on Nickelodeon in 1995.</p>

<h2 id="physical-appearance">Physical Appearance</h2>
<p>Skat Kat has a flat-top and a small, square soul patch and wears a white tanktop, blue, baggy pants with black suspenders, and big tennis shoes. He sported an earring on his left ear starting with the album artwork and the Skat Strut music video.</p>
<h2 id="the-stray-mob">The Stray Mob</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fatz</strong> — a short, raspy voiced cat who first appeared in the <em>Opposites Attract</em> video and made a brief cameo appearance with Skat Kat in &quot;Yakety Yak - Take it Back&quot;. He wears a round, green cap with an orange stripe and a zigzag pattern on it, a light-orange shirt, a sea-green vest, blue pants, a medallion (originally blank in <em>Opposites Attract</em> before it gained a peace symbol), and sometimes sunglasses. He also wears tennis shoes similar to Skat's, but slightly smaller. He is the most frequently heard character of the Stray Mob. His talents include beat boxing (Skat Strut) and playing the saxophone (Kat Stories). Formerly voiced by &quot;Squeak&quot; of the College Boyz.</li>
<li><strong>Taboo</strong> — a tall cat with black fur who appeared alongside Fatz in the <em>Opposites Attract</em> video. He wears a yellow t-shirt, red shorts, and shoes identical to Skat's. He also has a few tan-colored stripes on his tail. He is explicably and momentarily heard during the song <em>Kat Stories</em>. Formerly voiced by &quot;Rom&quot; of the College Boyz.</li>
<li><strong>Leo</strong> — a brawny mutt who seldom gets along with Skat, as evidenced in the <em>Skat Strut</em> video. He wears a maroon tanktop, orange and white striped shorts (orange and black on the album artwork), dark gray glovelettes, and light blue hat with a back flap. He's supposedly the driver of a turquoise-colored limousine with a mind of its own, as suggested in <em>New Kat Swing</em>.</li>
<li><strong>Micetro</strong> — a grayish mouse who made a silent appearance in the <em>Opposites Attract</em> video. He was seen mouthing the words &quot;We can boogie on down&quot; in the <em>Skat Strut</em> video. In the middle of the latter video, he holds up a baton like he was a maestro; hence, the name.</li>
<li><strong>Katleen</strong> — a cat with orange fur, a black-colored tip at the end of her tail, a pink hairdo, black-colored clothing, and light gray shoes. In the Skat Strut video, she also wore a blue bracelet or two and a necklace. Oddly, her name is shown to be the one providing the feminine voices in <em>So Sweet So Young</em> and <em>I Go Crazy,</em> since both voices sound different. However, in the unreleased <em>Big Time</em> music video, she not only had her own animated segments, but had her true voice heard as well.</li>
<li><strong>Silk</strong> — a cat with brown fur. In the <em>Skat Strut</em> music video, she has reddish-brown hair, blue eyes, earrings, a dark purple skirt, a black top, a light green vest, and purple shoes. On the album artwork, she had black hair, a red, sleeveless shirt, and a black skirt.</li>
