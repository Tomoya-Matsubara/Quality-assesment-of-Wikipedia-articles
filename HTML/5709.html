<p><strong>Julian Morton Carroll</strong> (born April 16, 1931) is a politician from the <a href="U.S._state" title="wikilink">U.S. state</a> of <a href="Kentucky" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kentucky</a>. A <a href="Democratic_Party_(United_States)" title="wikilink">Democrat</a>, he is presently a member of the <a href="Kentucky_Senate" title="wikilink">Kentucky Senate</a>, representing <a href="Anderson_County,_Kentucky" title="wikilink">Anderson</a>, <a href="Franklin_County,_Kentucky" title="wikilink">Franklin</a>, <a href="Woodford_County,_Kentucky" title="wikilink">Woodford</a>, and part of <a href="Fayette_County,_Kentucky" title="wikilink">Fayette</a> counties. From 1974 to 1979, he served as the <a href="List_of_Governors_of_Kentucky" title="wikilink">54th</a> <a href="Governor_of_Kentucky" title="wikilink">Governor of Kentucky</a>, succeeding <a href="Wendell_H._Ford" title="wikilink">Wendell H. Ford</a>, who resigned to accept a seat in the <a href="United_States_Senate" title="wikilink">U.S. Senate</a>. He was the first Kentucky governor from the state's far-western <a href="Jackson_Purchase" title="wikilink">Jackson Purchase</a> region, and his running mate <a href="Thelma_Stovall" title="wikilink">Thelma Stovall</a> was the first woman to be elected <a href="Lieutenant_Governor_of_Kentucky" title="wikilink">lieutenant governor of Kentucky</a>.</p>
<p>After graduating from the <a href="University_of_Kentucky" title="wikilink">University of Kentucky</a> and spending three years as an <a href="United_States_Air_Force" title="wikilink">Air Force</a> lawyer, Carroll returned to <a href="McCracken_County,_Kentucky" title="wikilink">McCracken County, Kentucky</a> where he gained acclaim for leading a campaign to allow the <a href="Tennessee_Valley_Authority" title="wikilink">Tennessee Valley Authority</a> to provide low-cost electricity to the county. He was elected to the first of five terms in the <a href="Kentucky_House_of_Representatives" title="wikilink">Kentucky House of Representatives</a> in 1962 and served as <a href="Speaker_of_the_Kentucky_House_of_Representatives" title="wikilink">speaker</a> of that body from 1968 to 1970. He ran for lieutenant governor in 1970 on an informal ticket with former governor <a href="Bert_T._Combs" title="wikilink">Bert T. Combs</a>. Combs lost in the <a href="Primary_election" title="wikilink">primary</a> to Wendell Ford, but Carroll defeated his primary opponents and went on to win the general election. He was elevated to governor in 1975 due to Ford's election to the Senate, and won a full term in his own right in 1976.</p>
<p>As governor, Carroll increased funding for public education and promoted the use of coal as a means of alleviating the <a href="1973_energy_crisis" title="wikilink">1973 energy crisis</a>. He also oversaw a major reorganization of the state's judicial system. Many natural and man-made disasters occurred during his term in office, including the <a href="Great_Blizzard_of_1978" title="wikilink">Great Blizzard of 1978</a> and the <a href="Beverly_Hills_Supper_Club_fire" title="wikilink">Beverly Hills Supper Club fire</a>, leading to better safety practices and stricter law enforcement in the state. When Carroll left office, both he and his predecessor were under the cloud of an investigation for an alleged insurance <a href="Political_corruption#Kickbacks" title="wikilink">kickback</a> scheme, but Carroll was not convicted of any wrongdoing. In 2004, he was elected to the Kentucky Senate. His present term is set to expire in 2012.</p>
<h2 id="early-life">Early life</h2>
<p>Julian Carroll was born in <a href="West_Paducah,_Kentucky" title="wikilink">West Paducah</a>, <a href="McCracken_County,_Kentucky" title="wikilink">McCracken County, Kentucky</a> on April 16, 1931.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> He was the third of eleven children born to Elvie B. &quot;Buster&quot; and Eva (Heady) Carroll.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> His father was a <a href="tenant_farmer" title="wikilink">tenant farmer</a>, but shortly after the <a href="Ohio_River_flood_of_1937" title="wikilink">Ohio River flood of 1937</a>, the family moved to <a href="Heath,_Kentucky" title="wikilink">Heath, Kentucky</a> where Buster Carroll sold tractor implements and opened a <a href="automobile_repair_shop" title="wikilink">automobile repair shop</a> in 1940.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> Through his early teenage years, Carroll lived with his grandparents to help care for an ailing grandfather.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1949, Carroll was selected to represent <a href="Heath_High_School_(Kentucky)" title="wikilink">Heath High School</a> at Kentucky <a href="Boys/Girls_State" title="wikilink">Boys State</a>, a week-long a civic affairs summer camp for high school seniors-to-be.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> Participants in the camp create a miniature state government based on their state's actual government.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> At the camp, Carroll was elected governor of the miniature government.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> The following year, he graduated as <a href="salutatorian" class="uri" title="wikilink">salutatorian</a> and student body president of Heath High School.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p>Carroll began dating Charlann Harting near the end of 1950.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> In mid-1951, they parted ways to attend college – Harting, whose family was better off financially, at the <a href="University_of_Kentucky" title="wikilink">University of Kentucky</a> and Carroll at nearby <a href="West_Kentucky_Community_and_Technical_College" title="wikilink">Paducah Junior College</a>.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> After their first year, Carroll and Harting decided to get married.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> The ceremony took place on July 22, 1951, and the couple eventually had four children – Kenneth, Patrice, Bradley, and Ellyn.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> Ellyn, born June 27, 1975, was the first child born to a Kentucky <a href="First_Family" title="wikilink">First Family</a> while they were residing in the <a href="Kentucky_Governor&#39;s_Mansion" title="wikilink">Governor's Mansion</a>.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<p>Carroll earned an <a href="Associate_in_Arts" title="wikilink">Associate in Arts</a> degree from Paducah Junior College in 1952.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> That summer, the family moved to <a href="Lexington,_Kentucky" title="wikilink">Lexington</a> where Carroll matriculated to the University of Kentucky.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> He funded his further education working for the Fayette County <a href="Agricultural_Stabilization_and_Conservation_Service" title="wikilink">Agriculture Stabilization and Conservation Office</a>.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> In 1954, he earned a <a href="Bachelor_of_Arts" title="wikilink">Bachelor of Arts</a> degree in <a href="political_science" title="wikilink">political science</a>, and in 1956, he earned a <a href="Bachelor_of_Laws" title="wikilink">Bachelor of Laws</a> degree.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
<p>While in college, Carroll had received training through the <a href="Air_Force_Reserve_Officer_Training_Corps" title="wikilink">Air Force Reserve Officer Training Corps</a>.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> By graduation, he had risen to the rank of Commandant of Cadets, the highest rank of any student at the university.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> After graduation, he enlisted in the <a href="United_States_Air_Force" title="wikilink">Air Force</a> and was stationed at <a href="Carswell_Air_Force_Base" title="wikilink">Carswell Air Force Base</a> in <a href="Fort_Worth,_Texas" title="wikilink">Fort Worth, Texas</a>.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> For three years, he served as an Air Force attorney, then returned to Paducah and joined the law firm of Reed, Scent, Reed, and Walton.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a><a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> He was active in civic affairs, including membership in the <a href="Jaycees" class="uri" title="wikilink">Jaycees</a> and serving as charter president of the Paducah <a href="Optimist_International" title="wikilink">Optimists Club</a> in 1962.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> He was a frequent lay speaker in the <a href="Cumberland_Presbyterian_Church" title="wikilink">Cumberland Presbyterian Church</a>, and from 1966 to 1967, served as moderator for the <a href="Kentucky_Synod" title="wikilink">Kentucky Synod</a>.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a></p>
<p>In January 1960, a group of local businessmen approached Carroll about leading a campaign to allow the <a href="Tennessee_Valley_Authority" title="wikilink">Tennessee Valley Authority</a> (TVA) to provide electricity to McCracken County. TVA could provide electricity at a much lower cost, but voters would first have to hold a public referendum on buying out <a href="Kentucky_Utilities" title="wikilink">Kentucky Utilities</a>, the private power provider in the area. Carroll agreed to lead the campaign, and nine months later, voters approved the buyout by a three-to-one margin.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="political-career">Political career</h2>
<p>The TVA campaign had put Carroll squarely in the public eye in McCracken County, and in 1962, he was elected to the first of five consecutive terms representing the county in the <a href="Kentucky_House_of_Representatives" title="wikilink">Kentucky House of Representatives</a>. He was chosen <a href="Speaker_of_the_Kentucky_House_of_Representatives" title="wikilink">Speaker of the House</a> from 1968 through 1970. In the 100-member House of Representatives, it was not uncommon for <a href="lobbyist" title="wikilink">lobbyists</a> to roam the floor freely, for members to bring their lunches to their desks, or for them to bring their friends and family members onto the floor during debate. Determined to bring a higher degree of decorum to the chamber's proceedings, Carroll opened the 1968 legislative session with a single, powerful whack of his gavel. The gavel shattered, stunning the legislators. Carroll subsequently barred outsiders from the floor during debate and forbade eating in the chamber. Carroll shattered three more gavels during the legislative session – he was finally given a sturdier one made of solid oak and <a href="formica" class="uri" title="wikilink">formica</a> – but he brought order to the chamber's proceedings. At the end of the session, a member of the opposing party declared from the floor &quot;The decorum of this House has improved 100 percent... I must compliment the present Speaker of this House for ... eliminating the abominable practices. Today every member has a right to speak ... without fear of interruption and catcalls or being shouted down.&quot;<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> The legislator's compliment was followed by a <a href="standing_ovation" title="wikilink">standing ovation</a> for Carroll.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a></p>
<p>Carroll had considered running for the <a href="United_States_Senate" title="wikilink">U.S. Senate</a> in 1968, but dropped out of the race after just two weeks when he discovered that it would take well over $100,000 to run a competitive <a href="primary_election" title="wikilink">primary</a> campaign.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> In 1971, former governor <a href="Bert_T._Combs" title="wikilink">Bert T. Combs</a> sought a second term as governor and chose Carroll as his informal running mate.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> (The governor and <a href="Lieutenant_Governor_of_Kentucky" title="wikilink">lieutenant governor</a> were elected separately at the time.) Combs, an <a href="Eastern_Kentucky" title="wikilink">Eastern Kentucky</a> native, sought geographic balance for the ticket by selecting Carroll, from the far-west <a href="Jackson_Purchase" title="wikilink">Jackson Purchase</a>.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> Combs said he would provide the needed financing, and Carroll agreed to enter the race.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a></p>
<p>Seven other Democratic candidates for lieutenant governor entered the race, the most formidable being sitting <a href="Attorney_General_of_Kentucky" title="wikilink">attorney general</a> <a href="John_B._Breckinridge" title="wikilink">John B. Breckinridge</a>.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> While Combs lost to Ford in the gubernatorial primary, Carroll won the separate primary for lieutenant governor, partly on the strength of the eastern Kentucky votes he gained from his association with Combs.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> Carroll went on to defeat <a href="Republican_Party_(United_States)" title="wikilink">Republican</a> Jim Host in the general election for lieutenant governor.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> As lieutenant governor, Carroll chaired the <a href="Legislative_Research_Commission" title="wikilink">Legislative Research Commission</a> and the <a href="National_Conference_of_Lieutenant_Governors" title="wikilink">National Conference of Lieutenant Governors</a>.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a></p>

<p>In the general election, Carroll faced Republican <a href="Robert_E._Gable" title="wikilink">Robert E. Gable</a>, a coal company owner from central Kentucky.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> The main issue of the campaign was the imposition of <a href="Desegregation_busing_in_the_United_States" title="wikilink">desegregation busing</a> on the city of <a href="Louisville,_Kentucky" title="wikilink">Louisville</a>.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> Both candidates opposed the busing, but Gable did so more vehemently and criticized the sitting governor for not &quot;doing something about it&quot;.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> In a televised debate with Carroll, Gable insisted on using what he called a &quot;truth bell&quot;.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> Gable rang the bell every time that he perceived that Carroll was not telling the truth.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> Eventually, the moderator of the debate ordered Gable to put the bell away, and Gable's credibility suffered in the eyes of voters.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> Carroll won the general election by a vote of 470,159 to 277,998, representing a record margin of victory in the Kentucky governor's race.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a> He carried every congressional district including <a href="Jefferson_County,_Kentucky" title="wikilink">Jefferson County</a>, where a Democrat had not won a race in twenty years.<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> His running mate, <a href="Thelma_Stovall" title="wikilink">Thelma Stovall</a>, became the first woman elected lieutenant governor of Kentucky.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a></p>
<p>With considerable experience in the <a href="Kentucky_General_Assembly" title="wikilink">General Assembly</a> – first as Speaker of the House, and later presiding over the Kentucky Senate as lieutenant governor – Carroll exercised a great deal of control over the proceedings of the legislature.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a> One observer quipped &quot;A cockroach couldn't crawl across the Senate floor without an OK from the governor stamped on his back.&quot;<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a> His reaction to criticism was often severe, prompting his political enemies to derisively refer to him as Emperor Julian.<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a> During the final year of Carroll's term, Lieutenant Governor Stovall, who was left as acting governor when Carroll had left the state on business, called a special session of the legislature to enact a tax cut that Carroll opposed.<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a> The General Assembly passed the tax cut, partly in retaliation for the governor's tight control of previous sessions.<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a></p>
<p>Carroll was charged with implementing an amendment to the state constitution approved by voters in 1975 to drastically reorganize the state's judicial system.<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a> The <a href="Kentucky_Court_of_Appeals" title="wikilink">Kentucky Court of Appeals</a>, the state's <a href="court_of_last_resort" title="wikilink">court of last resort</a>, was renamed the <a href="Kentucky_Supreme_Court" title="wikilink">Kentucky Supreme Court</a>, and a new Court of Appeals was created and interposed between the Supreme Court and the state's circuit and district courts.<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a> The position of <a href="county_judge" title="wikilink">county judge</a> was made a purely administrative position, and the office was renamed <a href="County_Judge/Executive" title="wikilink">county judge/executive</a>.<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a> Historian <a href="Lowell_H._Harrison" title="wikilink">Lowell H.

<p>Improvements in public schools were the hallmark of Carroll's term.<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a> Using money from a coal <a href="severance_tax" title="wikilink">severance tax</a> enacted by Ford's administration and increased revenue from an improving economy, Carroll increased teacher salaries and eliminated fees for required classes.<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a> He strengthened the state's Minimum Foundation Program and provided free textbooks.<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a> A School Building Authority was also created to help poor school districts construct new buildings.<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a> Vocational and <a href="Special_education_in_the_United_States" title="wikilink">special education</a> were expanded under the Carroll administration, and a program for gifted and talented students was piloted.<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a> Consequently, Kentucky improved in most national educational benchmarks, including moving from forty-sixth to thirty-eighth nationally in teacher salaries.<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a></p>
<p>Higher education did not fare as well under Carroll.
