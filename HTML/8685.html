<p>The <strong>First Hungarian Reformed Church of New York</strong> () is located on East 69th Street in the <a href="Upper_East_Side" title="wikilink">Upper East Side</a> of the <a href="New_York_City" title="wikilink">New York City</a> <a href="borough_(New_York_City)" title="wikilink">borough</a> of <a href="Manhattan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Manhattan</a>. It is a <a href="stucco" class="uri" title="wikilink">stucco</a>-faced brick building completed in 1916 in a Hungarian <a href="vernacular_architecture" title="wikilink">vernacular</a> <a href="architectural_style" title="wikilink">architectural style</a>, housing a congregation established in 1895.</p>
<p>It is the only Christian religious building designed by Hungarian-born architect <a href="Emery_Roth" title="wikilink">Emery Roth</a>, later known for his apartment buildings on <a href="Central_Park_West" title="wikilink">Central Park West</a>.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> As one of two <a href="Reformed_Church_in_Hungary" title="wikilink">Hungarian Reformed Churches</a> in Manhattan, it has a been a focal point for the city's <a href="Hungarian-American" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hungarian-American</a> community since its construction.</p>
<p>In 1983, its <a href="parsonage" class="uri" title="wikilink">parsonage</a> was listed on the <a href="National_Register_of_Historic_Places" title="wikilink">National Register of Historic Places</a> as a <a href="contributing_property" title="wikilink">contributing property</a> to the <a href="Rowhouses_at_322&lt;U+2013&gt;344_East_69th_Street" title="wikilink">Rowhouses at 322&lt;U+2013&gt;344 East 69th Street</a> <a href="historic_district_(United_States)" title="wikilink">historic district</a> to its immediate west. The parsonage was listed in its own right along with the church in 2000. Following the demolition of the German Evangelical Reformed Church a block to the south, it is now the oldest church in neighborhood.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>

<p>The church is located on the south side of the street midway between <a href="First_Avenue_(Manhattan)" title="wikilink">First</a> and <a href="Second_Avenue_(Manhattan)" title="wikilink">Second</a> avenues. It is in the middle of a group of old <a href="rowhouse" title="wikilink">rowhouses</a>. <a href="Rowhouses_at_322&lt;U+2013&gt;344_East_69th_Street" title="wikilink">Those on the west</a> are among the few remaining from the early development of this part of the Upper East Side around 1880. The rowhouse on the church's west serves as its <a href="parsonage" class="uri" title="wikilink">parsonage</a>. Across the street are larger, taller apartment buildings dating to the first half of the 20th century. Similar high-rises are to the south.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>The building itself is a two-story, three-<a href="bay_(architecture)" title="wikilink">bay</a> structure with raised basement in brick faced with yellow <a href="stucco" class="uri" title="wikilink">stucco</a>. A square <a href="bell_tower" title="wikilink">bell tower</a> rises from the center of a side-<a href="gable" title="wikilink">gabled</a> roof; behind it the roof is flat. There is a slightly projecting main entrance at the center and a basement entrance on the west.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>On the north-facing street <a href="facade" class="uri" title="wikilink">facade</a>'s first floor are two windows on either side of the main entrance with piers on either side. They are topped with decorative ceramic rectangular panels. Above them, on the second story, are double windows topped with similarly decorated semicircular panels. In the middle, on the projecting section, is a large <a href="oculus" class="uri" title="wikilink">oculus</a> with plaster surround.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>The roofline is marked by a <a href="bracket_(architecture)" title="wikilink">bracketed</a> overhanging <a href="eave" class="uri" title="wikilink">eave</a> with exposed <a href="rafter" class="uri" title="wikilink">rafter</a> tails. Above it the bell tower rises, with a single narrow window on the north above the roof topped by three similar windows on each face at the top. Each corner is topped with pyramid-shaped pinnacles; the tower itself has a conical roof in red tile with a <a href="weathervane" class="uri" title="wikilink">weathervane</a> on top.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p>A pent roof with wooden knee braces, below another rectangular ceramic panel, shelters the main entrance. Below it are double wooden doors beneath a <a href="stained_glass" title="wikilink">stained glass</a> tripartite <a href="transom_(architectural)" title="wikilink">transom</a> with an eagle in the center. It opens into a <a href="vestibule_(architecture)" title="wikilink">vestibule</a> with steps leading into the <a href="nave" class="uri" title="wikilink">nave</a>.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p>The nave has a mosaic tile floor with <a href="Meander_(art)" title="wikilink">Greek key</a> border and marble <a href="wainscoting" class="uri" title="wikilink">wainscoting</a>. A central aisle runs between two rows of original wooden <a href="pew" title="wikilink">pews</a>. Full-height <a href="pilaster" title="wikilink">pilasters</a> divide the walls into four bays. At the south end the walls are angled and filled with stained glass windows topped with a semicircular arch. A <a href="columbarium" class="uri" title="wikilink">columbarium</a> with bronze font is in the northeast corner.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p>Heating ducts are visible along the top of the west wall. The <a href="coffer" title="wikilink">coffered</a> ceiling is elliptical-arched with lateral beams springing from the pilaster <a href="capital_(architecture)" title="wikilink">capitals</a>. The coffers themselves are intricately painted and <a href="gilding" title="wikilink">gilded</a>. In the center of the ceiling are stained glass skylights. The light they let in is supplemented by artificial light from hanging fixtures.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<p>A stairwell in the northwest corner of the vestibule leads to the <a href="choir_loft" title="wikilink">choir loft</a>. It has <a href="marquetry" class="uri" title="wikilink">marquetry</a> panels with Hungarian folk art motifs below the <a href="balustrade" class="uri" title="wikilink">balustrade</a>. The church's basement has been remodeled into an auditorium with paneled walls and a dropped acoustic-tile ceiling. A door near the rear of the nave opens into the parsonage.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<p>The parsonage is a three-story <a href="Neo-Grec" class="uri" title="wikilink">Neo-Grec</a> <a href="brownstone" class="uri" title="wikilink">brownstone</a> <a href="rowhouse" class="uri" title="wikilink">rowhouse</a> with raised basement and <a href="Stoop_(architecture)" title="wikilink">stoop</a>.

Inside many original finishes remain, such as paneled doors, stair balustrade and high ceilings. The first floor is the church office, with the upper stories the living space.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<p>After the failure of the <a href="Hungarian_Revolution_of_1848" title="wikilink">1848 revolt</a> against <a href="Habsburg_Monarchy" title="wikilink">Habsburg rule</a>, <a href="Forty-Eighters#Forty-Eighters_in_the_U.S." title="wikilink">Hungarian refugees</a> began settling in New York. They started <em>Magyar Szamuzottek</em> (&quot;Hungarian Exiles' News&quot;), the first <a href="Hungarian_American" title="wikilink">Hungarian American</a> newspaper. The community grew again in the 1880s when immigrants began coming to America for better economic opportunities. Most settled along <a href="Second_Avenue_(Manhattan)" title="wikilink">Second Avenue</a>, either between <a href="1st_Street_(Manhattan)" title="wikilink">1st</a> and <a href="10th_Street_(Manhattan)" title="wikilink">10th</a> streets or <a href="55th_Street_(Manhattan)" title="wikilink">55th</a> and <a href="72nd_Street_(Manhattan)" title="wikilink">72nd</a>.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1895 The Rev. Bertalan Demeter established the First Hungarian Congregation, holding services in the Hope Chapel on 4th Street. Three years afterwards, in 1889, a new pastor, Zoltan Kuthy, led the congregation into joining the <a href="Reformed_Church_in_Hungary" title="wikilink">Hungarian Reformed churches</a> that had already been established elsewhere in the U.S. The church grew, and bought a house on East 7th Street for services.</p>
<p>The <a href="United_States_census,_1910" title="wikilink">1910 census</a> indicated that over 75,000 New Yorkers identified as of Hungarian origin. Most were from the regions of the <a href="Austro-Hungarian_Empire" title="wikilink">Austro-Hungarian Empire</a> that, in addition to modern Hungary, include portions of the <a href="Czech_Republic" title="wikilink">Czech Republic</a>, <a href="Austria" class="uri" title="wikilink">Austria</a>, <a href="Slovakia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Slovakia</a> and <a href="Slovenia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Slovenia</a>. Ethnically some were <a href="Romanian_people" title="wikilink">Romanian</a>, <a href="Slovak_people" title="wikilink">Slovak</a> and <a href="Croatian_people" title="wikilink">Croatian</a>. They were of diverse religious background, most <a href="Catholicism_in_Hungary" title="wikilink">Roman Catholic</a> or <a href="Eastern_Orthodox" title="wikilink">Eastern Orthodox</a>, but with significant <a href="Protestant" title="wikilink">Protestants</a> and <a href="Hungarian_Jews" title="wikilink">Jewish</a> populations.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1914 the church sold its house and bought the three lots on East 69th Street. Two of the existing houses were demolished to clear a site for the church; the one that remained was renovated for use as a parsonage. <a href="Emery_Roth" title="wikilink">Emery Roth</a>, a Hungarian immigrant from <a href="Se&lt;U+010D&gt;ovce" title="wikilink">G&lt;U+00E1&gt;lsz&lt;U+00E9&gt;cs</a>, was retained to design the new building. It was only his second religious building, and the only Christian building ever for Roth, who designed several <a href="synagogue" title="wikilink">synagogues</a> in the city. Since he was Jewish, it is likely that he was chosen for his familiarity with Hungarian <a href="vernacular_architecture" title="wikilink">vernacular architecture</a> and close ties with the Hungarian community.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<p>Roth's design reflects many Hungarian church building traditions, in keeping with the practice of many immigrant communities of the time. The stucco exterior is accented with inlaid <a href="faience" class="uri" title="wikilink">faience</a> tile, overhanging roof with rafter tails, and clay-tiled conical tower. Inside, the <a href="coffer" title="wikilink">coffered</a> ceiling is a common element in churches in eastern Hungary and <a href="Transylvania" class="uri" title="wikilink">Transylvania</a>. Its 322 individual coffers are handpainted with Hungarian folk motifs. It has been called &quot;a charmingly exotic adapation of Hungarian vernacular architecture&quot;.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
<p>The new building was <a href="consecration" title="wikilink">consecrated</a> in early 1916, using the bell from the old church. Since then there have been few changes other than the remodeling of the parsonage. The <a href="columbarium" class="uri" title="wikilink">columbarium</a> was added to the nave in the 1950s, and the basement was remodeled at some point. Old photographs also show all roofs having the same clay tiles as the tower.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
<p>New York's Hungarian community reached its zenith of almost 125,000 in the middle of the 20th century, the largest of any city in the nation. The area around the church had a strong Hungarian presence, with many bookstores and restaurants catering to its tastes. It declined over the rest of the century as the descendants of the original immigrants gradually <a href="assimilation_(sociology)" title="wikilink">assimilated</a> and moved to <a href="Queens" class="uri" title="wikilink">Queens</a> or the suburbs.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> New immigrants attended the church but often settled outside Manhattan as the area had begun to <a href="gentrification" title="wikilink">gentrify</a>.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> The church continues to serve them, holding services in Hungarian every Sunday.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a></p>
