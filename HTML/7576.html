<p>Alexander founded several cities in his new territories in the areas of the <a href="Oxus" class="uri" title="wikilink">Oxus</a> and <a href="Bactria" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bactria</a>, and Greek settlements further extended to the <a href="Khyber_Pass" title="wikilink">Khyber Pass</a>, <a href="Gandhara" class="uri" title="wikilink">Gandhara</a> (see <a href="Taxila" class="uri" title="wikilink">Taxila</a>) and the <a href="Punjab_region" title="wikilink">Punjab</a>. These regions correspond to a unique geographical passageway between the <a href="Himalayas" class="uri" title="wikilink">Himalayas</a> and the <a href="Hindu_Kush" title="wikilink">Hindu Kush</a> mountains, through which most of the interaction between India and Central Asia took place, generating intense cultural exchange and trade.</p>
<p>Following Alexander's death on <a href="June_10" title="wikilink">June 10</a>, 323 BCE, the <em><a href="Diadochoi" class="uri" title="wikilink">Diadochoi</a></em> (successors) founded their own kingdoms in <a href="Asia_Minor" title="wikilink">Asia Minor</a> and <a href="Central_Asia" title="wikilink">Central Asia</a>.

<p>The length of the Greek presence in Central Asia and northern India provided opportunities for interaction, not only on the artistic, but also on the religious plane.</p>

<p>When Alexander conquered the <a href="Bactria" title="wikilink">Bactrian</a> and <a href="Gandhara" title="wikilink">Gandharan</a> regions, these areas may already have been under Buddhist influence. According to a legend preserved in <a href="P&lt;U+0101&gt;li" title="wikilink">Pali</a>, the language of the <a href="Theravada" class="uri" title="wikilink">Theravada</a> canon, two <a href="merchant" class="uri" title="wikilink">merchant</a> brothers from Bactria, named Tapassu and Bhallika, visited the Buddha and became his disciples. They then returned to Bactria and built temples to the Buddha (Foltz).</p>

King <a href="Taxiles" title="wikilink">Ambhi</a>, ruler of <a href="Taxila" class="uri" title="wikilink">Taxila</a>, surrendered his city, a notable center of Buddhist faith, to Alexander. Alexander fought an epic battle against <a href="Porus" class="uri" title="wikilink">Porus</a>, a ruler of a region in the <a href="Punjab_region" title="wikilink">Punjab</a> in the <a href="Battle_of_Hydaspes" title="wikilink">Battle of Hydaspes</a> in (326 BC). Alexander continued on to conquer all the headwaters of the <a href="Indus_River" title="wikilink">Indus River</a>.</p>
<p>Several philosophers, such as <a href="Pyrrho" class="uri" title="wikilink">Pyrrho</a>, <a href="Anaxarchus" class="uri" title="wikilink">Anaxarchus</a> and <a href="Onesicritus" class="uri" title="wikilink">Onesicritus</a>, are said to have been selected by Alexander to accompany him in his eastern campaigns. During the 18 months they were in India, they were able to interact with Indian religious men, generally described as <a href="Gymnosophists" class="uri" title="wikilink">Gymnosophists</a> (&quot;naked philosophers&quot;). <a href="Pyrrho" class="uri" title="wikilink">Pyrrho</a> (360-270 BCE), returned to Greece and became the first <a href="Skeptic" class="uri" title="wikilink">Skeptic</a> and the founder of the school named <a href="Pyrrhonism" class="uri" title="wikilink">Pyrrhonism</a>. The Greek biographer <a href="Diogenes_Laertius" title="wikilink">Diogenes Laertius</a> explained that Pyrrhon's equanimity and detachment from the world were acquired in India.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> Few of his sayings are directly known, but they are clearly reminiscent of eastern, possibly Buddhist, thought:</p>

<p>Another of these philosophers, <a href="Onesicritus" class="uri" title="wikilink">Onesicritus</a>, a <a href="Cynic" class="uri" title="wikilink">Cynic</a>, is said by <a href="Strabo" class="uri" title="wikilink">Strabo</a> to have learnt in India the following precepts:</p>

<p>Buddhist manuscripts in cursive Greek have been found in Afghanistan, praising various Buddhas and including mentions of the Mahayana <a href="Avalokitesvara" title="wikilink">Lokesvara</a>-raja Buddha (&lt;U+03BB&gt;&lt;U+03C9&gt;&lt;U+03B3&gt;&lt;U+03BF&gt;&lt;U+03B1&gt;&lt;U+03C3&gt;&lt;U+03C6&gt;&lt;U+03B1&gt;&lt;U+03C1&gt;&lt;U+03BF&gt;&lt;U+03C1&gt;&lt;U+03B1&gt;&lt;U+03B6&gt;&lt;U+03BF&gt;&lt;U+03B2&gt;&lt;U+03BF&gt;&lt;U+03B4&gt;&lt;U+03B4&gt;&lt;U+03BF&gt;). These manuscripts have been dated later than the 2nd century CE. (Nicholas Sims-Williams, &quot;A Bactrian Buddhist Manuscript&quot;).</p>
<p>The <a href="Mahayana" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mahayana</a> movement probably began around the 1st century BCE in northwestern India, at the time and place of these interactions. According to most scholars, the main sutras of Mahayana were written after 100 BCE, when sectarian conflicts arose among <a href="Nikaya_Buddhism" title="wikilink">Nikaya Buddhist</a> sects regarding the humanity or super-humanity of the Buddha and questions of <a href="Metaphysics" title="wikilink">metaphysical</a> <a href="essentialism" class="uri" title="wikilink">essentialism</a>, on which Greek thought may have had some influence: &quot;It may have been a Greek-influenced and Greek-carried form of Buddhism that passed north and east along the Silk Road&quot; (McEvilly, &quot;The shape of ancient thought&quot;).</p>

<p>By that time they had already been in contact with Greek culture and the Indo-Greek kingdoms for more than a century.

<p>Numerous works of <a href="Greco-Buddhist_art" title="wikilink">Greco-Buddhist art</a> display the intermixing of Greek and Buddhist influences, around such creation centers as <a href="Gandhara" class="uri" title="wikilink">Gandhara</a>. The subject matter of Gandharan art was definitely Buddhist, while most motifs were of <a href="Southwest_Asia" title="wikilink">Western Asiatic</a> or <a href="Hellenistic" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hellenistic</a> origin.</p>
<h3 id="the-anthropomorphic-representation-of-the-buddha">The anthropomorphic representation of the Buddha</h3>
<p><img src="MaraAssault.JPG" title="fig:An aniconic representation of Mara&#39;s assault on the Buddha, 2nd century CE, Amaravati, India." alt="An aniconic representation of Mara&#39;s assault on the Buddha, 2nd century CE, Amaravati, India." width="180" /> Although there is still some debate, the first <a href="anthropomorphic" class="uri" title="wikilink">anthropomorphic</a> representations of the <a href="Buddha" class="uri" title="wikilink">Buddha</a> himself are often considered a result of the Greco-Buddhist interaction. Before this innovation, Buddhist art was &quot;<a href="aniconism" title="wikilink">aniconic</a>&quot;: the Buddha was only represented through his symbols (an empty <a href="throne" class="uri" title="wikilink">throne</a>, the <a href="Bodhi" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bodhi</a> tree, the <a href="Buddha_footprint" title="wikilink">Buddha's footprints</a>, the <a href="prayer_wheel" title="wikilink">prayer wheel</a>).</p>
<p>This reluctance towards anthropomorphic representations of the Buddha, and the sophisticated development of aniconic symbols to avoid it (even in narrative scenes where other human figures would appear), seem to be connected to one of the Buddha&lt;U+2019&gt;s sayings, reported in the <a href="Buddhist_texts#Long_discourses" title="wikilink">Digha Nikaya</a>, that discouraged representations of himself after the extinction of his body.</p>
<p>Probably not feeling bound by these restrictions, and because of &quot;their cult of form, the Greeks were the first to attempt a sculptural representation of the Buddha&quot; (Linssen, &quot;<a href="Zen" class="uri" title="wikilink">Zen</a> Living&quot;). In many parts of the Ancient World, the Greeks did develop <a href="syncretic" class="uri" title="wikilink">syncretic</a> divinities, that could become a common religious focus for populations with different traditions: a well-known example is the syncretic God <a href="Sarapis" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sarapis</a>, introduced by <a href="Ptolemy_I_of_Egypt" title="wikilink">Ptolemy I</a> in <a href="Egypt" class="uri" title="wikilink">Egypt</a>, which combined aspects of Greek and Egyptian Gods. In India as well, it was only natural for the Greeks to create a single common divinity by combining the image of a Greek God-King (The Sun-God <a href="Apollo" class="uri" title="wikilink">Apollo</a>, or possibly the deified founder of the <a href="Indo-Greek_Kingdom" title="wikilink">Indo-Greek Kingdom</a>, <a href="Demetrius_I_of_Bactria" title="wikilink">Demetrius</a>), with the traditional <a href="Physical_characteristics_of_the_Buddha" title="wikilink">attributes of the Buddha</a>.</p>
<p><img src="StandingBuddha.JPG" title="fig:Standing Buddha, ancient region of Gandhara, northern Pakistan, 1st century CE." alt="Standing Buddha, ancient region of Gandhara, northern Pakistan, 1st century CE." width="230" /> Many of the stylistic elements in the representations of the Buddha point to Greek influence: the <a href="Greco-Roman" class="uri" title="wikilink">Greco-Roman</a> <a href="toga" class="uri" title="wikilink">toga</a>-like wavy robe covering both shoulders (more exactly, its lighter version, the Greek <em><a href="himation" class="uri" title="wikilink">himation</a></em>), the <a href="contrapposto" class="uri" title="wikilink">contrapposto</a> stance of the upright figures (see: 1st–2nd century Gandhara standing Buddhas<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a>), the stylicized <a href="Mediterranean" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mediterranean</a> curly hair and top-knot apparently derived from the style of the Belvedere Apollo (330 BCE),<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> and the measured quality of the faces, all rendered with strong artistic <a href="realism" class="uri" title="wikilink">realism</a> (See: <a href="Greek_art" title="wikilink">Greek art</a>). A large quantity of <a href="sculpture" title="wikilink">sculptures</a> combining Buddhist and purely Hellenistic styles and <a href="iconography" class="uri" title="wikilink">iconography</a> were excavated at the <a href="Gandhara" title="wikilink">Gandharan</a> site of <a href="Hadda" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hadda</a>. The 'curly hair' of Buddha is described in the famous list of <a href="Physical_characteristics_of_the_Buddha" title="wikilink">32 external characteristics of a Great Being</a> (mahapurusa) that we find all along the Buddhist sutras. The curly hair, with the curls turning to the right is first described in the Pali canon of the Smaller Vehicle of Buddhism; we find the same description in e.g. the &quot;Dasasahasrika Prajnaparamita&quot;.</p>
<p>Greek artists were most probably the authors of these early representations of the Buddha, in particular the standing statues, which display &quot;a realistic treatment of the folds and on some even a hint of modelled volume that characterizes the best Greek work. This is Classical or Hellenistic Greek, not archaizing Greek transmitted by <a href="Persians" title="wikilink">Persia</a> or <a href="Bactria" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bactria</a>, nor distinctively <a href="Ancient_Rome" title="wikilink">Roman</a>&quot; (Boardman).</p>
<p>The Greek stylistic influence on the representation of the Buddha, through its idealistic realism, also permitted a very accessible, understandable and attractive visualization of the ultimate state of <a href="Bodhi" title="wikilink">enlightenment</a> described by Buddhism, allowing it reach a wider audience: &quot;One of the distinguishing features of the Gandharan school of art that emerged in north-west India is that it has been clearly influenced by the naturalism of the Classical Greek style. Thus, while these images still convey the inner peace that results from putting the Buddha's doctrine into practice, they also give us an impression of people who walked and talked, etc. and slept much as we do. I feel this is very important. These figures are inspiring because they do not only depict the goal, but also the sense that people like us can achieve it if we try&quot; (<a href="Tenzin_Gyatso,_14th_Dalai_Lama" title="wikilink">The Dalai Lama</a>, foreword to &quot;Echoes of Alexander the Great&quot;, 2000).</p>
<p>During the following centuries, this anthropomorphic representation of the Buddha defined the canon of Buddhist art, but progressively evolved to incorporate more <a href="India" title="wikilink">Indian</a> and <a href="Asia" title="wikilink">Asian</a> elements.</p>

For example, <a href="Herakles" class="uri" title="wikilink">Herakles</a> with a lion-skin (the protector deity of <a href="Demetrius_I_of_Bactria" title="wikilink">Demetrius I</a>) &quot;served as an artistic model for <a href="Vajrapani" class="uri" title="wikilink">Vajrapani</a>, a protector of the Buddha&quot; (Foltz, &quot;Religions and the Silk Road&quot;) (See<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a>). In <a href="Japan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Japan</a>, this expression further translated into the wrath-filled and muscular <a href="Nioo" title="wikilink">Ni&lt;U+014D&gt;</a> guardian gods of the Buddha, standing today at the entrance of many Buddhist temples.</p>
<p>According to Katsumi Tanabe, professor at Chuo University, Japan (in &quot;Alexander the Great. East-West cultural contact from Greece to Japan&quot;), besides Vajrapani, Greek influence also appears in several other gods of the <a href="Mahayana" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mahayana</a> pantheon, such as the Japanese Wind God <a href="Fujin" class="uri" title="wikilink">Fujin</a> inspired from the Greek <a href="Boreas" class="uri" title="wikilink">Boreas</a> through the Greco-Buddhist <a href="Wardo" class="uri" title="wikilink">Wardo</a>, or the mother deity <a href="Hariti" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hariti</a><a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> inspired by <a href="Tyche" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tyche</a>.</p>

<h2 id="greco-buddhism-and-the-rise-of-the-mahayana">Greco-Buddhism and the rise of the Mahayana</h2>
<p>The geographical, cultural and historical context of the rise of Mahayana Buddhism during the 1st century BCE in northwestern <a href="India" class="uri" title="wikilink">India</a>, all point to intense multi-cultural influences: &quot;Key formative influences on the early development of the <a href="Mahayana" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mahayana</a> and <a href="Pure_Land" title="wikilink">Pure Land</a> movements, which became so much part of <a href="East_Asia" title="wikilink">East Asian</a> <a href="civilization" class="uri" title="wikilink">civilization</a>, are to be sought in Buddhism's earlier encounters along the <a href="Silk_Road" title="wikilink">Silk Road</a>&quot; (Foltz, Religions on the Silk Road). As <a href="Mahayana" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mahayana</a> Buddhism emerged, it received &quot;influences from popular Hindu devotional cults (<a href="bhakti" class="uri" title="wikilink">bhakti</a>), <a href="Persia" title="wikilink">Persian</a> and <a href="Greco-Roman" class="uri" title="wikilink">Greco-Roman</a> theologies which filtered into India from the northwest&quot; (Tom Lowenstein, p63).</p>
<h3 id="conceptual-influences">Conceptual influences</h3>
<p><a href="Mahayana" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mahayana</a> is an inclusive faith characterized by the adoption of new texts, in addition to the traditional <a href="Pali_canon" title="wikilink">Pali canon</a>, and a shift in the understanding of Buddhism. It goes beyond the traditional <a href="Theravada" class="uri" title="wikilink">Theravada</a> ideal of the release from suffering (<a href="dukkha" class="uri" title="wikilink">dukkha</a>) and personal enlightenment of the <a href="arhat" title="wikilink">arhats</a>, to elevate the <a href="Buddha" class="uri" title="wikilink">Buddha</a> to a God-like status, and to create a pantheon of quasi-divine <a href="Bodhisattva" title="wikilink">Bodhisattvas</a> devoting themselves to personal excellence, ultimate knowledge and the salvation of humanity. These concepts, together with the sophisticated philosophical system of the Mahayana faith, may have been influenced by the interaction of Greek and Buddhist thought:</p>
<h4 id="the-buddha-as-an-idealized-man-god">The Buddha as an idealized man-god</h4>
<p>The Buddha was elevated to a man-god status, represented in idealized human form: &quot;One might regard the classical influence as including the general idea of representing a man-god in this purely human form, which was of course well familiar in the West, and it is very likely that the example of westerners' treatment of their gods was indeed an important factor in the innovation... The Buddha, the man-god, is in many ways far more like a Greek god than any other eastern deity, no less for the narrative cycle of his story and appearance of his standing figure than for his humanity&quot; (Boardman, &quot;The Diffusion of Classical Art in Antiquity&quot; ).</p>
<p>The supra-mundane understanding of the Buddha and Bodhisattvas may have been a consequence of the Greek&lt;U+2019&gt;s tendency to deify their rulers in the wake of Alexander&lt;U+2019&gt;s reign: &quot;The god-<a href="Monarch" title="wikilink">king</a> concept brought by Alexander (...) may have fed into the developing <a href="bodhisattva" class="uri" title="wikilink">bodhisattva</a> concept, which involved the portrayal of the Buddha in Gandharan art with the face of the <a href="Solar_deity" title="wikilink">sun god</a>, <a href="Apollo" class="uri" title="wikilink">Apollo</a>&quot; (McEvilley, &quot;The Shape of Ancient Thought&quot;).</p>
<h4 id="the-bodhisattva-as-a-universal-ideal-of-excellence">The Bodhisattva as a Universal ideal of excellence</h4>
<p><img src="HaddaTypes.JPG" title="fig:Portraits from the site of Hadda, 3rd century CE." alt="Portraits from the site of Hadda, 3rd century CE." width="230" /> Lamotte (1954) controversially suggests (though countered by Conze (1973) and others) that Greek influence was present in the definition of the Bodhisattva ideal in the oldest Mahayana text, the &quot;Perfection of Wisdom&quot; or <em><a href="Prajnaparamita" title="wikilink">praj&lt;U+00F1&gt;&lt;U+0101&gt; p&lt;U+0101&gt;ramit&lt;U+0101&gt;</a></em> literature, that developed between the 1st century BCE and the 1st century CE. These texts in particular redefine Buddhism around the universal Bodhisattva ideal, and its six central virtues of generosity, morality, patience, effort, meditation and, first and foremost, <a href="wisdom" class="uri" title="wikilink">wisdom</a>.</p>
<h4 id="philosophical-influences">Philosophical influences</h4>
<p>The close association between Greeks and Buddhism probably led to exchanges on the philosophical plane as well. Many of the early Mahayana theories of reality and knowledge can be related to Greek philosophical schools of thought. Mahayana Buddhism has been described as the &lt;U+201C&gt;form of Buddhism which (regardless of how Hinduized its later forms became) seems to have originated in the Greco-Buddhist communities of India, through a conflation of the Greek <a href="Democritus" title="wikilink">Democritean</a>-<a href="Sophism" title="wikilink">Sophistic</a>-<a href="Philosophical_skepticism" title="wikilink">Skeptical</a> tradition with the rudimentary and unformalized empirical and skeptical elements already present in early Buddhism&lt;U+201D&gt; (McEvilly, &quot;The Shape of Ancient Thought&quot;, p503).</p>
<ul>
<li>In the <a href="Prajnaparamita" class="uri" title="wikilink">Prajnaparamita</a>, the rejection of the reality of passing phenomena as &lt;U+201C&gt;empty, false and fleeting&lt;U+201D&gt; can also be found in Greek <a href="Pyrrhonism" class="uri" title="wikilink">Pyrrhonism</a>.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></li>
<li>The perception of ultimate reality was, for the <a href="Cynics" class="uri" title="wikilink">Cynics</a> as well as for the Madyamikas and Zen teachers after them, only accessible through a non-conceptual and non-verbal approach (Greek &quot;Phronesis&quot;), which alone allowed to get rid of ordinary conceptions.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a></li>
<li>The mental attitude of equanimity and dispassionate outlook in front of events was also characteristic of the <a href="Cynic" title="wikilink">Cynics</a> and <a href="Stoic" title="wikilink">Stoics</a>, who called it &quot;Apatheia&quot;<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a></li>

</ul>
<h5 id="cynicism-madhyamika-and-zen">Cynicism, Madhyamika and Zen</h5>
<p>Numerous parallels exist between the Greek philosophy of the <a href="Cynics" class="uri" title="wikilink">Cynics</a> and, several centuries later, the Buddhist philosophy of the <a href="Madhyamika" class="uri" title="wikilink">Madhyamika</a> and <a href="Zen" class="uri" title="wikilink">Zen</a>. The Cynics denied the relevancy of human conventions and opinions (described as <em>typhos</em>, literally &quot;smoke&quot; or &quot;mist&quot;, a metaphor for &quot;illusion&quot; or &quot;error&quot;), including verbal expressions, in favor of the raw experience of reality. They stressed the independence from externals to achieve happiness (&quot;Happiness is not pleasure, for which we need external, but virtue, which is complete without external&quot; 3rd epistole of Crates). Similarly the <a href="Prajnaparamita" class="uri" title="wikilink">Prajnaparamita</a>, precursor of the <a href="Madhyamika" class="uri" title="wikilink">Madhyamika</a>, explained that all things are like foam, or bubbles, &quot;empty, false, and fleeting&quot;, and that &quot;only the negation of all views can lead to enlightenment&quot; (N&lt;U+0101&gt;g&lt;U+0101&gt;rjuna, MK XIII.8). In order to evade the world of illusion, the Cynics recommended the discipline and struggle (&quot;ask&lt;U+0113&gt;sis kai mach&lt;U+0113&gt;&quot;) of philosophy, the practice of &quot;autarkia&quot; (self-rule), and a lifestyle examplified by <a href="Diogenes_of_Sinope" title="wikilink">Diogenes</a>, which, like Buddhist monks, renounced earthly possessions. These conceptions, in combination with the idea of &quot;philanthropia&quot; (universal loving kindness, of which <a href="Crates_of_Thebes" title="wikilink">Crates</a>, the student of Diogenes, was the best proponent), are strikingly reminiscent of Buddhist <a href="Praj&lt;U+00F1&gt;&lt;U+0101&gt;" title="wikilink">Prajna</a> (wisdom) and <a href="Karuna" class="uri" title="wikilink">Karuna</a> (compassion).<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>

<p>A popular figure in Greco-Buddhist art, the future Buddha <a href="Maitreya" class="uri" title="wikilink">Maitreya</a>, has sometimes been linked to the Iranian <a href="yazata" class="uri" title="wikilink">yazata</a> (<a href="Zoroastrianism" title="wikilink">Zoroastrian</a> divinity) <a href="Mithra" title="wikilink">Mi&lt;U+03B8&gt;ra</a> who was also adopted as a figure in a Greco-Roman syncretistic cult under the name of <a href="Mithras" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mithras</a>. Maitreya is the fifth Buddha of the present world-age, who will appear at some undefined future epoch. According to Foltz, he &quot;echoes the qualities of the <a href="Zoroastrian" class="uri" title="wikilink">Zoroastrian</a> Saoshyant and the Christian Messiah&quot; (Foltz). However, in character and function, Maitreya does not much resemble either Mitra, Mi&lt;U+03B8&gt;ra or Mithras; his name is more obviously derived from the Sanskrit <em>maitr&lt;U+012B&gt;</em> &quot;kindliness&quot;, equivalent to <a href="P&lt;U+0101&gt;li" title="wikilink">Pali</a> <em>mett&lt;U+0101&gt;</em>; the Pali (and probably older) form of his name, Metteyya, does not closely resemble the name Mi&lt;U+03B8&gt;ra.</p>
<p>The Buddha <a href="Amitabha" title="wikilink">Amit&lt;U+0101&gt;bha</a> (literally meaning &lt;U+201C&gt;infinite radiance&lt;U+201D&gt;) with his paradisiacal &quot;<a href="Pure_Land" title="wikilink">Pure Land</a>&quot; in the West, according to Foltz, &quot;seems to be understood as the Iranian god of light, equated with the sun&quot;. This view is however not in accordance with the view taken of Amit&lt;U+0101&gt;bha by present-day Pure Land Buddhists, in which Amit&lt;U+0101&gt;bha is neither &quot;equated with the sun&quot; nor, strictly speaking, a god.</p>

<p>Buddhist monks from the region of <a href="Gandhara" class="uri" title="wikilink">Gandhara</a>, where Greco-Buddhism was most influential, played a key role in the development and the transmission of Buddhist ideas in the direction of northern Asia. <img src="CentralAsianBuddhistMonks.JPG" title="fig:Blue-eyed Central Asian Buddhist monk, with an East-Asian colleague, Tarim Basin, 9th-10th century." alt="Blue-eyed Central Asian Buddhist monk, with an East-Asian colleague, Tarim Basin, 9th-10th century." width="180" /></p>

<li>In 485 CE, according to the Chinese historic treatise <a href="Liang_Shu" title="wikilink">Liang Shu</a>, five monks from Gandhara travelled to the country of <a href="Fusang" class="uri" title="wikilink">Fusang</a> (&quot;The country of the extreme East&quot; beyond the sea, probably eastern <a href="Japan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Japan</a>, although some historians suggest the American Continent), where they introduced Buddhism:</li>

(...) In former times, the people of Fusang knew nothing of the Buddhist religion, but in the second year of Da Ming of the <a href="Song_dynasty" title="wikilink">Song dynasty</a> (485 CE), five monks from Kipin (<a href="Kabul" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kabul</a> region of Gandhara) travelled by ship to Fusang. They propagated Buddhist doctrine, circulated scriptures and drawings, and advised the people to relinquish worldly attachments. As a results the customs of Fusang changed&quot; (Ch:&quot;&lt;U+6276&gt;&lt;U+6851&gt;&lt;U+5728&gt;&lt;U+5927&gt;&lt;U+6F22&gt;&lt;U+570B&gt;&lt;U+6771&gt;&lt;U+4E8C&gt;&lt;U+842C&gt;&lt;U+9918&gt;&lt;U+91CC&gt;,&lt;U+5730&gt;&lt;U+5728&gt;&lt;U+4E2D&gt;&lt;U+570B&gt;&lt;U+4E4B&gt;&lt;U+6771&gt;(...)&lt;U+5176&gt;&lt;U+4FD7&gt;&lt;U+820A&gt;&lt;U+7121&gt;&lt;U+4F5B&gt;&lt;U+6CD5&gt;,&lt;U+5B8B&gt;&lt;U+5927&gt;&lt;U+660E&gt;&lt;U+4E8C&gt;&lt;U+5E74&gt;,&lt;U+7F7D&gt;&lt;U+8CD3&gt;&lt;U+570B&gt;&lt;U+5617&gt;&lt;U+6709&gt;&lt;U+6BD4&gt;&lt;U+4E18&gt;&lt;U+4E94&gt;&lt;U+4EBA&gt;&lt;U+6E38&gt;&lt;U+884C&gt;&lt;U+81F3&gt;&lt;U+5176&gt;&lt;U+570B&gt;,&lt;U+6D41&gt;&lt;U+901A&gt;&lt;U+4F5B&gt;&lt;U+6CD5&gt;,&lt;U+7D93&gt;&lt;U+50CF&gt;,&lt;U+6559&gt;&lt;U+4EE4&gt;&lt;U+51FA&gt;&lt;U+5BB6&gt;,&lt;U+98A8&gt; &lt;U+4FD7&gt;&lt;U+9042&gt;&lt;U+6539&gt;.&quot;, <a href="Liang_Shu" title="wikilink">Liang Shu</a>, 7th century CE).

<p>Through art and religion, the influence of Greco-Buddhism on the cultural make-up of <a href="East_Asia" title="wikilink">East Asian</a> countries, especially <a href="China" class="uri" title="wikilink">China</a>, <a href="Korea" class="uri" title="wikilink">Korea</a> and <a href="Japan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Japan</a>, may have extended further into the intellectual area.</p>
<p>At the same time as <a href="Greco-Buddhist_art" title="wikilink">Greco-Buddhist art</a> and Mahayana schools of thought such as <a href="Dhyana" class="uri" title="wikilink">Dhyana</a> were transmitted to East Asia, central concepts of Hellenic culture such as <a href="virtue" class="uri" title="wikilink">virtue</a>, excellence or <a href="quality" class="uri" title="wikilink">quality</a> may have been adopted by the cultures of Korea and Japan after a long diffusion among the Hellenized cities of <a href="Central_Asia" title="wikilink">Central Asia</a>, to become a key part of their warrior and work <a href="ethics" class="uri" title="wikilink">ethics</a>.</p>
<h2 id="greco-buddhism-and-the-west">Greco-Buddhism and the West</h2>
<p>In the direction of the <a href="Western_world" title="wikilink">West</a>, the Greco-Buddhist syncretism may also have had some formative influence on the religions of the <a href="Mediterranean_Basin" title="wikilink">Mediterranean Basin</a>.</p>
<h3 id="exchanges">Exchanges</h3>
<p>Intense westward physical exchange at that time along the Silk Road is confirmed by the Roman craze for <a href="silk" class="uri" title="wikilink">silk</a> from the 1st century BCE to the point that the <a href="Roman_Senate" title="wikilink">Senate</a> issued, in vain, several edicts to prohibit the wearing of silk, on economic and moral grounds. This is attested by at least three significant authors:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="Strabo" class="uri" title="wikilink">Strabo</a> (64/ 63 BCE–c. 24 CE).</li>
<li><a href="Seneca_the_Younger" title="wikilink">Seneca the Younger</a> (c. 3 BCE–65 CE).</li>
<li><a href="Pliny_the_Elder" title="wikilink">Pliny the Elder</a> (23–79 CE).</li>
</ul>
<p>The aforementioned Strabo and <a href="Plutarch" class="uri" title="wikilink">Plutarch</a> (c. 45–125 CE) wrote about king <a href="Milinda" title="wikilink">Menander</a>, confirming that information was circulating throughout the Hellenistic world.</p>
<h2 id="religious-influences">Religious influences</h2>
<h3 id="christianity-and-judaism">Christianity and Judaism</h3>
<p>Although the philosophical systems of Buddhism and Christianity have evolved in rather different ways, the moral precepts advocated by Buddhism from the time of Ashoka through his edicts do have some similarities with the Christian moral precepts developed more than two centuries later: respect for life, respect for the weak, rejection of violence, pardon to sinners, tolerance.</p>
<p>One theory is that these similarities may indicate the propagation of Buddhist ideals into the Western World, with the Greeks acting as intermediaries and religious syncretists.</p>
<p>For example, the &quot;miracle&quot; of walking on water, which is frequently attributed to Jesus in the New Testament, is first found in Buddhist literature in the oldest Pali Canon Digha Nikaya 11, in the Kevatta Sutta. This is not found in any other literature in the world except 500 years later in the Christian New Testament.</p>
<dl>

<dd>&quot;Scholars have often considered the possibility that Buddhism influenced the early development of Christianity. They have drawn attention to many parallels concerning the births, lives, doctrines, and deaths of the Buddha and Jesus&quot; (Bentley, &quot;Old World Encounters&quot;).
</dd>
</dl>
<p>The story of the birth of the Buddha was well known in the West, and possibly influenced the story of the birth of Jesus: <a href="Saint_Jerome" title="wikilink">Saint Jerome</a> (4th century CE) mentions the birth of the Buddha, who he says &quot;was born from the side of a virgin&quot;. Also a fragment of <a href="Archelaos_of_Carrha" title="wikilink">Archelaos of Carrha</a> (278 CE) mentions the Buddha's virgin-birth.</p>
<p>Early 3rd-4th century Christian writers such as <a href="Hippolytus" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hippolytus</a> and <a href="Epiphanius" class="uri" title="wikilink">Epiphanius</a> write about a <a href="Scythianus" class="uri" title="wikilink">Scythianus</a>, who visited India around 50 AD from where he brought &quot;the doctrine of the Two Principles&quot;. According to these writers, Scythianus' pupil Terebinthus presented himself as a &quot;Buddha&quot; (&quot;he called himself Buddas&quot; <a href="Cyril_of_Jerusalem" title="wikilink">Cyril of Jerusalem</a>). Terebinthus went to <a href="Palestine" class="uri" title="wikilink">Palestine</a> and <a href="Judaea" class="uri" title="wikilink">Judaea</a> where he met the Apostles (&quot;becoming known and condemned&quot; Isaia), and ultimately settled in Babylon, where he transmitted his teachings to <a href="Mani" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mani</a>, thereby creating the foundation of what could be called Persian syncretic Buddhism, <a href="Manicheism" class="uri" title="wikilink">Manicheism</a>. One of the greatest thinkers and saints of western Christianity, <a href="Augustine_of_Hippo" title="wikilink">Augustine of Hippo</a> was originally a Manichean.</p>
<p>In the 2nd century CE, the Christian dogmatist <a href="Clement_of_Alexandria" title="wikilink">Clement of Alexandria</a> recognized Bactrian Buddhists (Sramanas) and Indian Gymnosophists for their influence on Greek thought:</p>
<dl>

<dd>&quot;Thus philosophy, a thing of the highest utility, flourished in antiquity among the barbarians, shedding its light over the nations. And afterwards it came to Greece. First in its ranks were the prophets of the Egyptians; and the Chaldeans among the Assyrians; and the Druids among the Gauls; and the Sramanas among the Bactrians (&quot;&lt;U+03A3&gt;&lt;U+03B1&gt;&lt;U+03C1&gt;&lt;U+03BC&gt;&lt;U+03B1&gt;&lt;U+03BD&gt;&lt;U+03B1&gt;&lt;U+03AF&gt;&lt;U+03BF&gt;&lt;U+03B9&gt; &lt;U+0392&gt;&lt;U+03AC&gt;&lt;U+03BA&gt;&lt;U+03C4&gt;&lt;U+03C1&gt;&lt;U+03C9&gt;&lt;U+03BD&gt;&quot;); and the philosophers of the Celts; and the Magi of the Persians, who foretold the Saviour's birth, and came into the land of Judaea guided by a star. The Indian gymnosophists are also in the number, and the other barbarian philosophers. And of these there are two classes, some of them called Sramanas (&quot;&lt;U+03A3&gt;&lt;U+03B1&gt;&lt;U+03C1&gt;&lt;U+03BC&gt;&lt;U+03AC&gt;&lt;U+03BD&gt;&lt;U+03B1&gt;&lt;U+03B9&gt;&quot;), and others Brahmins (&quot;&lt;U+0392&gt;&lt;U+03C1&gt;&lt;U+03B1&gt;&lt;U+03C6&gt;&lt;U+03BC&gt;&lt;U+03B1&gt;&lt;U+03BD&gt;&lt;U+03B1&gt;&lt;U+03B9&gt;&quot;).&quot; Clement of Alexandria &quot;The Stromata, or Miscellanies&quot; Book I, Chapter XV[21]

<li id="fn18">&quot;The ethics of both the methaphysical and the critical branches of the Greek tradition involves withdrawal from passionate belief and the development of equanimity&quot; (Mc Evilley, &quot;The shape of ancient thought&quot;, p420) &quot;Cynic sages, like Buddhist monks, renounced home and possessions and to the streets as wanderers and temple beggars. The closely related concepts <em>apatheia</em> (non-reaction, non-involvement) and <em>adiaphoria</em> (non-differentiation) became central to the Cynic discipline.&quot; (Mc Evilley, &quot;The shape of ancient thought&quot;, p439)<a href="#fnref18" class="footnote-back">↩</a></li>
<li id="fn19">&quot;Nagarjuna's work has the whole pattern of the Greek dialectic, with its complex and extensive system of arguments, which in Greece developed over a period of several centuries; yet it arises suddenly, without evidence of developmental stages, in its own tradition&quot; (Mc Evilly, &quot;The shape of ancient thought&quot;, p500)<a href="#fnref19" class="footnote-back">↩</a></li>
