<p><strong>Larisa Semyonovna Latynina</strong> (, ; born 27 December 1934) is a former Soviet <a href="gymnastics" title="wikilink">gymnast</a>. Between 1956 and 1964 she won <a href="List_of_multiple_Olympic_medalists" title="wikilink">14 individual Olympic medals</a> and four team medals. Her total of 18 Olympic medals was a record for 48 years until surpassed by American swimmer <a href="Michael_Phelps" title="wikilink">Michael Phelps</a> on 31 July 2012.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> Although Phelps broke her total medal count record, her record for individual event medals (14) still stands. She is credited with helping to establish the Soviet Union as a dominant force in gymnastics.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="early-life">Early life</h2>
<p>Born as <strong>Larisa Semyonovna Diriy</strong> in <a href="Ukraine" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ukraine</a>, she first practiced ballet, but turned to gymnastics after her choreographer moved out of <a href="Kherson" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kherson</a>. She graduated from high school in 1953 and moved to <a href="Kiev" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kiev</a> to attend the Lenin Polytechnic Institute and continue training, where she trained at the <a href="Burevestnik_(society)" title="wikilink">Burevestnik</a> <a href="Voluntary_Sports_Societies_of_the_USSR" title="wikilink">Voluntary Sports Society</a>. At the age of 19, she debuted internationally at the <a href="1954_World_Artistic_Gymnastics_Championships" title="wikilink">1954 Rome World Championships</a>, winning the gold medal in the team competition.</p>
<h2 id="gymnastics-career">Gymnastics career</h2>
<p>At the <a href="1956_Summer_Olympics" title="wikilink">1956 Summer Olympics</a>, she competed with <a href="&lt;U+00C1&gt;gnes_Keleti" title="wikilink">&lt;U+00C1&gt;gnes Keleti</a> of Hungary to become the most successful gymnast of the Olympics. Latynina beat Keleti in the all-around event, and the Soviet team also won the team event. In the event finals, Latynina won gold medals on the floor (shared with Keleti) and vault, a silver medal on the uneven bars, and a bronze medal in the now discontinued team event with portable apparatus. Keleti also won six medals: four golds and two silvers.</p>
<p>After a very successful <a href="1958_World_Artistic_Gymnastics_Championships" title="wikilink">World Championships</a> in 1958 (winning five out of six titles despite competing whilst four months pregnant), Latynina was the favorite for the <a href="1960_Summer_Olympics" title="wikilink">1960 Summer Olympics</a> in Rome.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> In the all-around event she led the Soviet Union to take the first four places, thereby also securing a win in the team competition by a margin of nine points. Latynina defended her floor title, took silver medals in the balance beam and uneven bars events, and bronze in the vault competition.</p>
<p><img src="Larisa_Latinina.jpg" title="fig:Latynina in 2008" alt="Latynina in 2008" />Latynina won all-around titles at the <a href="1962_World_Artistic_Gymnastics_Championships" title="wikilink">1962 World Championships</a>, beating <a href="V&lt;U+011B&gt;ra_&lt;U+010C&gt;&lt;U+00E1&gt;slavsk&lt;U+00E1&gt;" title="wikilink">V&lt;U+011B&gt;ra &lt;U+010C&gt;&lt;U+00E1&gt;slavsk&lt;U+00E1&gt;</a> of <a href="Czechoslovakia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Czechoslovakia</a>. Still the defending World Champion at the <a href="1964_Summer_Olympics" title="wikilink">1964 Summer Olympics</a>, she was beaten by &lt;U+010C&gt;&lt;U+00E1&gt;slavsk&lt;U+00E1&gt; in the all-around competition. Latynina added two more gold medals to her tally, winning the team event and the floor event both for the third time in a row. A silver medal and two bronzes in the other apparatus events brought her total of Olympic medals to eighteen&lt;U+2014&gt;nine gold medals, five silver and four bronze. She won a medal in every event in which she competed, except for the 1956 balance beam where she came in fourth.</p>
<p>Latynina's nine gold medals makes her second on the <a href="List_of_multiple_Olympic_gold_medalists" title="wikilink">list of most Olympic gold medalists</a> together with <a href="Mark_Spitz" title="wikilink">Mark Spitz</a>, <a href="Carl_Lewis" title="wikilink">Carl Lewis</a> and <a href="Paavo_Nurmi" title="wikilink">Paavo Nurmi</a>, only behind <a href="Michael_Phelps" title="wikilink">Michael Phelps</a>, who has 18.

She is the only woman to have won nine gold medals.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> She is also the only female athlete who at some point has held the <a href="List_of_multiple_Olympic_gold_medalists#Timeline_of_most_gold_medals" title="wikilink">record for most Olympic gold medals</a>. Additionally, within the sport of gymnastics, she is the only woman who has won an all-around medal in more than two Olympiads, the only woman who has won an individual event (floor exercise) in more than two Olympiads, and one of only three women who have won every individual event at either the World Championship or Olympic level.
