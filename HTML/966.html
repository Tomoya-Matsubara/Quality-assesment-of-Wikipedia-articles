<p><img src="IIT-locations.svg" title="fig:Location of IITs" alt="Location of IITs" width="270" /> The <strong>Indian Institutes of Technology</strong>, or IITs, are a group of seven autonomous <a href="engineering" class="uri" title="wikilink">engineering</a> and <a href="technology" class="uri" title="wikilink">technology</a> oriented institutes of <a href="higher_education" title="wikilink">higher education</a> established and declared as <em>Institutes of National Importance</em> by the <a href="Government_of_India" title="wikilink">Government of India</a>. The IITs were created to train <a href="science" title="wikilink">scientists</a> and engineers, with the aim of developing a skilled workforce to support the <a href="economy_of_India" title="wikilink">economic</a> and <a href="culture_of_India" title="wikilink">social</a> development of <a href="India" class="uri" title="wikilink">India</a> after independence in 1947. The students and alumni of IITs are colloquially referred to as <em>IITians</em>.</p>
<p>In order of establishment, the seven IITs are located at <a href="Kharagpur" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kharagpur</a>, <a href="Mumbai" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mumbai</a> (Bombay), <a href="Chennai" class="uri" title="wikilink">Chennai</a> (Madras), <a href="Kanpur" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kanpur</a>, <a href="Delhi" class="uri" title="wikilink">Delhi</a>, <a href="Guwahati" class="uri" title="wikilink">Guwahati</a>, and <a href="Roorkee" class="uri" title="wikilink">Roorkee</a>. Some IITs were established with financial assistance and technical expertise from <a href="UNESCO" class="uri" title="wikilink">UNESCO</a>, <a href="Germany" class="uri" title="wikilink">Germany</a>, the <a href="United_States" title="wikilink">United States</a>, and the <a href="Soviet_Union" title="wikilink">Soviet Union</a>. Each IIT is an autonomous university, linked to the others through a common IIT Council, which oversees their administration. They have a common admission process for undergraduate admissions, using the <a href="Indian_Institute_of_Technology_Joint_Entrance_Examination" title="wikilink">Joint Entrance Examination</a> (popularly known as IIT-JEE) to select around 4,000 undergraduate candidates a year. Graduate Admissions are done on the basis of the <a href="Graduate_Aptitude_Test_in_Engineering" title="wikilink">GATE</a>. About 15,500 <a href="undergraduate" class="uri" title="wikilink">undergraduate</a> and 12,000 <a href="graduate_student" title="wikilink">graduate</a> students study in the seven IITs, in addition to research scholars.</p>
<p>IITians have achieved success in a variety of professions, resulting in the establishment of the widely recognised <strong>Brand IIT</strong>.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> The autonomy of the IITs has helped them to create specialised degrees in technology at the undergraduate level, and consequently to award the Bachelor of Technology (B.Tech.) degree, as opposed to the Bachelor of Engineering (BE) degree awarded by most other Indian universities. The success of the IITs has led to the creation of similar institutes in other fields, such as the <a href="National_Institutes_of_Technology" title="wikilink">National Institutes of Technology</a>, the <a href="Indian_Institutes_of_Management" title="wikilink">Indian Institutes of Management</a> and the Institutes of Information Technology (<a href="IIIT" class="uri" title="wikilink">IIIT</a>).</p>

The 22-member committee, headed by <a href="Nalini_Ranjan_Sarkar" title="wikilink">Nalini Ranjan Sarkar</a>, recommended the establishment of these institutions in various parts of India, with affiliated secondary institutions. The committee felt that such institutes should not only produce undergraduates, but researchers and academics. The institutes were expected to maintain high educational standards.</p>
<p>With these recommendations in view, the first Indian Institute of Technology was founded in May 1950 at the site of the <a href="Hijli_Detention_Camp" title="wikilink">Hijli Detention Camp</a> in Kharagpur. On <a href="September_15" title="wikilink">September 15</a> <a href="1956" class="uri" title="wikilink">1956</a>, the <a href="Parliament_of_India" title="wikilink">Parliament of India</a> passed the <em>Indian Institute of Technology (Kharagpur) Act</em>, declaring it as an <em>Institute of National Importance</em>. <a href="Jawaharlal_Nehru" title="wikilink">Jawaharlal Nehru</a>, first <a href="Prime_Minister_of_India" title="wikilink">Prime Minister of India</a>, in the first convocation address of IIT Kharagpur in 1956 said:<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> </p>

<p>Based on the initial recommendations of the Sarkar Committee, it was decided that further IITs should be spread throughout the country. When the government expressed its willingness to correct this regional imbalance, 16 states demanded IITs. Since the S K Joshi Committee prescribed strict guidelines for institutions aspiring to be IITs,<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> only seven colleges were selected for final consideration.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> Plans are also reported to open IITs outside India, though not enough progress has been made in this regard.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> The Indian Union Human Resources Development ministry has planned to set up three more Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) &lt;U+2014&gt; one each in the states of <a href="Andhra_Pradesh" title="wikilink">Andhra Pradesh</a> (<a href="Medak" class="uri" title="wikilink">Medak</a> district), <a href="Bihar" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bihar</a> (<a href="Gaya" class="uri" title="wikilink">Gaya</a>), and <a href="Rajasthan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Rajasthan</a>.</p>

<h2 id="admission">Admission</h2>
<p>Admission to most undergraduate and postgraduate courses in IITs is granted through various written entrance examinations. Admission to <a href="Master&#39;s_degree" title="wikilink">M.S.</a> and <a href="Doctor_of_Philosophy" title="wikilink">Ph.D.</a> programs is based primarily on a personal interview, though candidates may also have to appear for written tests. The IITs are also well known for their special reservation policy, which stands out in contrast with the rest of India.</p>
<h3 id="entrance-examinations">Entrance examinations</h3>

<p><img src="Iitm.maingate.logo.jpg" title="fig:Entrance of IIT Madras" alt="Entrance of IIT Madras" /> Admission to undergraduate programs in all IITs is tied to the <em>Joint Entrance Examination</em>, popularly known as <em>IIT-JEE</em>. Candidates who qualify admission via IIT-JEE can apply for admission in B.Tech. (<em>Bachelor of Technology</em>), Dual Degree (Integrated <em>Bachelor of Technology</em> and <em>Master of Technology</em>) and Integrated M.Sc. (<em>Master of Sciences</em>) courses in IITs. IIT-JEE is a science-oriented entrance exam, testing candidate's knowledge of <a href="mathematics" class="uri" title="wikilink">mathematics</a>, <a href="physics" class="uri" title="wikilink">physics</a> and <a href="chemistry" class="uri" title="wikilink">chemistry</a>. It is conducted by an IIT chosen by a policy of rotation. Admission is very competitive, given the huge population of India; the undergraduate acceptance rate through JEE has a low ratio, around 1 in 55, with about 300,000<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> annual test takers for about 5,500 seats.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> Only about 4,000 of these seats are offered by IITs, the rest belonging to other institutes that use IIT-JEE. Only students who have completed (or will complete at the end of the current academic session) their higher secondary studies from a recognised educational board are allowed to appear for IIT-JEE. The IIT-JEE is well known for frequently changing the types of questions asked in order to discourage <a href="Rote_learning" title="wikilink">study by rote</a>. Since IIT-JEE 2006, the format of the question paper was changed to a single objective test-based paper, replacing the earlier system that employed two tests. The candidates belonging to the general category must secure a minimum aggregate of 60% marks in the qualifying examination of the XII<sup>th</sup> standard organised by various educational boards of India. Candidates belonging to <a href="Scheduled_Caste" title="wikilink">Scheduled Caste</a> (SC), <a href="Scheduled_Tribe" title="wikilink">Scheduled Tribe</a> (ST) and Physically Disabled (PD) categories must secure a minimum aggregate of 55% in the qualifying examination.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> The upper age limit for appearing for the IIT-JEE is 25 years. The age limit is relaxed to 30 years for candidates classified in the SC, ST and PD categories. Starting with IIT-JEE 2007, a candidate can take IIT-JEE a maximum of two times, and students who are selected for an IIT cannot attempt the examination again.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a></p>
<p>The admissions into the postgraduate programmes are made through various exams, primarily the <a href="Graduate_Aptitude_Test_in_Engineering" title="wikilink">Graduate Aptitude Test in Engineering</a> (GATE) for M.Tech. and some MS courses. Other prominent entrance exams include JAM (Joint Admission to M.Sc.) for M.Sc., and JMET (Joint Management Entrance Test) for Management Studies.</p>
<h3 id="reservation-policy">Reservation policy</h3>

<p>India is one of the countries<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> that practices a form of affirmative action on caste-based reserved quotas. As per the provisions in the <a href="Constitution_of_India" title="wikilink">Indian constitution</a>, the IITs have been reserving seats for <em><a href="Scheduled_Castes_and_Tribes" title="wikilink">Scheduled Castes</a></em> of society since 1973. The IITs follow a reservation policy that is notably different from the quota policy elsewhere in India.</p>
<p>As per the rules of admission to IITs, 15% of the admitted students must be of the Scheduled Castes, and 7.5% of seats are reserved for Scheduled Tribes.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> As of 2006, no separate reservation exists for the <em><a href="Other_Backward_Class" title="wikilink">Other Backward Classes</a></em> (OBCs, a group of castes which, though not <a href="Dalit_(outcaste)" title="wikilink">untouchable</a>, are socially and economically disadvantaged) in spite of the Mandal commission recommendations. The IITs are not bound to fill these quotas of seats, and many of them remain vacant owing to the nature of selection process. In 2004, 112 out of 279 seats reserved for ST candidates, and 11 out of 556 seats reserved for SC candidates, were left vacant.</p>
<p>As per the rules, all the Scheduled Caste (SC) and Scheduled Tribe (ST) candidates must take the IIT-JEE with the rest of the students. Based on the results of IIT-JEE, those SC/ST candidates who score more than two-third of the marks scored by the <em>General Category</em> student admitted with the lowest score are admitted directly to IITs.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> Another group of candidates who do not meet this relaxed admission criteria are offered a &quot;Preparatory Course&quot; comprising of <a href="English_language" title="wikilink">English</a>, Physics, Chemistry and Mathematics at the IIT concerned. After one year of study, those candidates who are able to secure a grade higher than the prescribed cut-off mark during end-of-semester exams are allowed to continue regular studies. There is no relaxation on the criteria for passing the exams or graduating a course. The candidates admitted through the reservation policy are also subjected to the same criteria as the general candidates for graduation.</p>
<p>In 1989, Prime Minister <a href="V._P._Singh" title="wikilink">V. P. Singh</a> accepted and implemented the proposals of the <a href="Mandal_Commission" title="wikilink">Mandal Commission</a> that recommended provisions of reservations for OBCs in private unaided institutions as well as high-end government jobs for minority communities. No changes took place in the IITs because of the legislation, but in 2005, based on the recommendations of a political panel, the <a href="United_Progressive_Alliance" title="wikilink">UPA</a> government proposed to implement the reserved-quota system for the OBCs in IITs and IIMs. It received critical objections by many scholars and critics, who described the proposal as &quot;dangerous and divisive&quot; and based solely on political (vote-bank) purposes. Many argued that the <a href="OBC" title="wikilink">OBCs</a> are not a backward community and enjoy good economic and social status and thus a reservation for <a href="OBC" title="wikilink">OBCs</a> becomes a mere strategy to gain votes. Though, the issue has simmered down as of now, it still remains a very hotly argued one. <a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> When the government planned to implement the quota system, <a href="Indian_anti-reservation_protests,_2006" title="wikilink">anti-reservation protests</a> were organised throughout India against the proposal. Student agitations also took place in the IITs and many students who opposed caste-based reservations resorted to <a href="hunger_strike" title="wikilink">hunger strikes</a>. They labelled the quota system as a government tactic to earn cheap votes, and that the system would lead to increased <a href="casteism" class="uri" title="wikilink">casteism</a> and a severe compromise on merit and talent.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a></p>
<p>The additional procedures for admission into the IITs (the preparatory course and the qualifying end-of-semester exams that follow) have also been criticised as unnecessary and counter-productive. One of the arguments opposing the modified policy of reservation and favouring direct admission is that a large number of seats remain vacant under the present scheme.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a></p>

<p><img src="IITKLibrary.jpg" title="fig:PK Kelkar Library, IIT Kanpur" alt="PK Kelkar Library, IIT Kanpur" width="300" /> The IITs receive disproportionately high grants compared to other engineering colleges in India.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> While the total government funding to most other engineering colleges is around <a href="Rupee" title="wikilink">Rs.</a> 100–200 million per year, the amount varies between Rs. 900–1,300 million per year for each IIT.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> Other sources of funds include student fees and research funding from industry. This has translated into superior infrastructure and better faculty in the IITs and consequently higher competition among students to gain admissions into the IITs. The faculty-to-student ratio in the IITs is between 1:6 and 1:8.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> The Standing Committee of IIT Council (SCIC) prescribes the lower limit for faculty-to-student ratio as 1:9, applied department wise. The IITs subsidise undergraduate student fees by approximately 80% and provide <a href="scholarship" title="wikilink">scholarships</a> to all <em>Master of Technology</em> students and <em>Research Scholars</em> in order to encourage students for higher studies, per the recommendations of the Thacker Committee (1959&lt;U+2013&gt;1961).<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> The cost borne by undergraduate students including boarding and mess expenses is around Rs. 50,000 per annum.</p>
<p>The various IITs function autonomously, and their special status as <em>Institutes of National Importance</em> facilitates the smooth running of IITs, virtually free from both regional as well as student <a href="Politics_of_India" title="wikilink">politics</a>. Such autonomy means that IITs can create their own <a href="curriculum" title="wikilink">curricula</a> and adapt rapidly to the changes in educational requirements, free from bureaucratic hurdles. The government has no direct control over internal policy decisions of IITs (like faculty recruitment and curricula) but has representation on the <em>IIT Council</em>. The medium of instruction in all IITs is English.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> The classes are usually held between 7:30 a.m. and 5:30 p.m., though there are some variations within each IIT. All the IITs have public libraries for the use of their students. In addition to a collection of prescribed books, the libraries have sections for <a href="fiction" class="uri" title="wikilink">fiction</a> and other <a href="literary_genre" title="wikilink">literary genres</a>. The electronic libraries allow students to access on-line <a href="journal" title="wikilink">journals</a> and <a href="periodical" title="wikilink">periodicals</a>.</p>
<p>The academic policies of each IIT are decided by its <em><a href="academic_senate" title="wikilink">Senate</a></em>. This comprises all professors of the IIT and student representatives. Unlike many western universities that have an elected senate, the IITs have an academic senate. It controls and approves the curriculum, courses, examinations and results, and appoints committees to look into specific academic matters. The teaching, training and research activities of the institute are periodically reviewed by the senate to maintain educational standards.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> The <em>Director</em> of an IIT is the ex-officio Chairman of the Senate.</p>
<p>All the IITs follow the credits system of performance evaluation, with proportional weighting of courses based on their importance. The total marks (usually out of 100) form the basis of <a href="grade_(education)" title="wikilink">grades</a>, with a grade value (out of 10) assigned to a range of marks. Sometimes, relative grading is done considering the overall performance of the whole class. For each semester, the students are graded on a scale of 0 to 10 based on their performance, by taking a weighted average of the grade points from all the courses, with their respective credit points. Each semester evaluation is done independently and then the weighted average over all semesters is used to calculate the cumulative <a href="Grade_Point_Average" title="wikilink">grade point average</a> (known as CGPA or CPI&lt;U+2014&gt;Cumulative Performance Index).</p>
<h3 id="undergraduate-education">Undergraduate education</h3>
<p>The B.Tech. degree is the most common undergraduate degree in the IITs in terms of student enrolment, although Dual Degrees and Integrated (five-year) Master of Science degrees are also offered. The B.Tech course is based on a 4-year program with eight semesters,<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> while the Dual Degree course is a 5-year program with ten semesters. In all IITs, the first year of B.Tech. and Dual Degree courses are marked by a common course structure for all the students,<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> though in some IITs, a single department introduction related course is also included.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> The common courses include the basics from most of the departments like Electronics, Mechanics, Chemistry, and Physics. At the end of first year (the end of first semester at IIT Madras), an option to change departments is given to meritorious students on the basis of their performance in the first two semesters.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> Few such changes ultimately take place as the criteria for them are usually strict,<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> limited to the most meritorious students.</p>
<p>From the second year onwards, the students study subjects exclusively from their respective departments.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> In addition to these, the students have to take compulsory advanced courses from other departments in order to broaden their education. Separate compulsory courses from <a href="humanities" class="uri" title="wikilink">humanities</a> and <a href="social_sciences" title="wikilink">social sciences</a> department, and sometimes management courses are also enforced.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a> At the end of third year, the undergraduate students have to undertake a summer project at an industry or reputed academic institute as part of the curriculum. In the last year of their studies, most of the students are placed into industries and organisations via the placement process of the respective IIT, though some students opt out of this either when going for higher studies or when they take up jobs by applying to the companies directly.<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="postgraduate-and-doctoral-education">Postgraduate and doctoral education</h3>
<p><img src="IITM_Library.JPG" title="fig:IIT Madras Library" alt="IIT Madras Library" width="300" /> The IITs offer a number of postgraduate programs including Master of Technology (M.Tech.), <a href="Master_of_Business_Administration" title="wikilink">Master of Business Administration</a> (MBA), (only for engineers and post graduates in science,) and Master of Science (M.Sc.). Some IITs offer specialised graduate programmes such as the Post Graduate Diploma in Information Technology (PGDIT), Master in Medical Science and Technology (MMST), Master of <a href="urban_planning" title="wikilink">City Planning</a> (MCP), Postgraduate Diploma in <a href="intellectual_property" title="wikilink">Intellectual Property</a> Law (PGDIPL), Master in Design (MDes), and the Postgraduate Diploma in Maritime Operation &amp; Management (PGDMOM). The IITs also offer the <a href="Doctor_of_Philosophy" title="wikilink">Doctor of Philosophy</a> degree (Ph.D.) as part of their <a href="Doctorate" title="wikilink">doctoral education programme</a>. In it, the candidates are given a topic of academic interest by the professor or have to work on a consultancy project given by the industries. The duration of the program is usually unspecified and depends on the specific discipline. Ph.D. candidates have to submit a <a href="dissertation" class="uri" title="wikilink">dissertation</a> as well as provide an oral defence for their thesis. <a href="Teaching_assistant" title="wikilink">Teaching Assistantships</a> (TA) and <a href="research_assistant" title="wikilink">Research Assistantships</a> (RA) are often provided. Some of the IITs offer an M.S. (by research) program; the M.Tech. and M.S. are similar to the US universities' non-thesis (course based) and thesis (research based) masters programs respectively. The IITs, along with NITs and IISc, account for nearly 80% of all PhDs in engineering.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a></p>
<p>The IITs also offer an unconventional B.Tech. and M.Tech. integrated educational program called &quot;Dual Degree&quot;. It integrates undergraduate and postgraduate studies in selected areas of specialisation. It is completed in five years<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a> as against six years in conventional B.Tech. (four years) followed by an M.Tech. (two years).<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a> This programme was started to allow IITians to complete postgraduate studies from IIT rather than having to go to another institute. All IITs (except IIT Guwahati) have schools of management offering degrees in management or business administration. </p>
<h2 id="culture-and-student-life">Culture and student life</h2>

<p><img src="Iitm.oat.scrn.jpg" title="fig:Open-air theatre in IIT Madras. It is used to host technical and cultural events." alt="Open-air theatre in IIT Madras. It is used to host technical and cultural events." width="225" /> All the IITs provide on-campus residential facilities to the students, research scholars and faculty. The students live in hostels (sometimes referred to as <em>halls</em>) throughout their stay in the IIT. Students in all IITs must choose between <a href="National_Cadet_Corps_(India)" title="wikilink">National Cadet Corps</a> (NCC), <a href="National_Service_Scheme_(India)" title="wikilink">National Service Scheme</a> (NSS) and <a href="National_Sports_Organization_(India)" title="wikilink">National Sports Organisation</a> (NSO) in their first years.<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a> All the IITs have sports grounds for <a href="cricket" class="uri" title="wikilink">cricket</a>, <a href="football_(soccer)" title="wikilink">football(soccer)</a>, <a href="field_hockey" title="wikilink">hockey</a>, <a href="volleyball" class="uri" title="wikilink">volleyball</a>, <a href="lawn_tennis" title="wikilink">lawn tennis</a>, <a href="badminton" class="uri" title="wikilink">badminton</a>, and <a href="athletics_(track_and_field)" title="wikilink">athletics</a>; and <a href="swimming_pool" title="wikilink">swimming pools</a> for aquatic events. Usually the hostels also have their own sports grounds.</p>
<h3 id="technical-and-cultural-festivals">Technical and cultural festivals</h3>
<p>All IITs organise annual technical festivals, typically lasting three or four days. The technical festivals are <a href="Shaastra" title="wikilink"><em>Shaastra</em> (IIT Madras)</a>, <a href="Techkriti" title="wikilink"><em>Techkriti</em> (IIT Kanpur)</a>, <a href="Student_Life_in_IIT_Kharagpur#Kshitij" title="wikilink"><em>Kshitij</em> (IIT Kharagpur)</a>, <a href="Cognizance_(culfest)" title="wikilink"><em>Cognizance</em> (IIT Roorkee)</a>, <a href="Techfest" title="wikilink"><em>Techfest</em> (IIT Bombay)</a>, <em>Tryst</em> (IIT Delhi), and <em>Techniche</em> (IIT Guwahati). Most of them are organised in the months of February or March. <em>Shaastra</em> holds the distinction of being the first student-managed event in the world to implement a formal <a href="Quality_Management_System" title="wikilink">Quality Management System</a>, earning the <a href="ISO_9001:2000" title="wikilink">ISO 9001:2000</a> certification.<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a></p>
<p>Annual <a href="Culfest" title="wikilink">cultural festivals</a> are also organised by the IITs and last three to four days. These include <a href="Mood_Indigo_(culfest)" title="wikilink">Mood Indigo (IIT Bombay)</a> (also known as <em>Mood-I</em>), <a href="Student_Life_in_IIT_Kharagpur#Spring_Fest" title="wikilink">Spring Fest (IIT Kharagpur)</a> (also known as <em>SF</em>), <a href="Saarang" title="wikilink">Saarang (IIT Madras)</a> (previously <em>Mardi Gras</em>), <a href="Antaragni" title="wikilink">Antaragni (IIT Kanpur)</a>, <a href="Alcheringa" title="wikilink">Alcheringa (IIT Guwahati)</a>, Rendezvous (IIT Delhi), and <a href="Thomso" class="uri" title="wikilink">Thomso</a> (IIT Roorkee). <img src="Illumination_festival.JPG" title="fig:Illumination festival in IIT Kharagpur. The outlines are made by earthen lamps." alt="Illumination festival in IIT Kharagpur. The outlines are made by earthen lamps." width="225" /> In addition to these cultural festivals, IIT Kharagpur and IIT Bombay celebrate unique festivals. IIT Kharagpur celebrates the <a href="Illumination_and_Rangoli" title="wikilink">Illumination festival</a> on the eve of <a href="Diwali" class="uri" title="wikilink">Diwali</a>. Large bamboo structures (called <em>chatais</em>) as high as 6 metres (20 feet) are made and earthen lamps (<a href="Diya_(light)" title="wikilink">diyas</a>) are placed on them to form outlines of people, monuments, or an event.<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a> Held as a competition between the hostels, it also receives by outside visitors. Coupled with the Illumination festival is the <a href="Rangoli" class="uri" title="wikilink">Rangoli</a> festival. In Rangoli, large panels showing an event or a concept, are made on the ground by fine powder, and sometimes even by crushed <a href="bangle" title="wikilink">bangles</a>.</p>
<p>Unique to IIT Bombay is the <a href="Performing_Arts_Festival" title="wikilink">Performing Arts Festival</a> (popularly known as <em>PAF</em>). Technically a drama, each PAF includes drama, literature, music, fine arts, debating, and dance. All PAFs are held in the Open Air Theater (OAT), on the main campus of IIT Bombay. Typically two or three hostels (of 14) group together by random draw for each PAF. All of the dialogues are delivered as <a href="voice_over" title="wikilink">voice overs</a> and not by the actors, mainly due to the structure and the huge size of the OAT. <img src="Inter-IIT.JPG" title="fig:A volleyball event at Inter IIT Sports Meet-2004" alt="A volleyball event at Inter IIT Sports Meet-2004" width="150" /></p>
<h3 id="inter-iit-sports-meet">Inter-IIT sports meet</h3>
<p>The IITs compete among themselves in a number of sports events held under the aegis of the <em>Annual Inter-IIT Sports Meet</em>. Started in 1961, the competition is held every December at an IIT chosen by rotation. The award consists of a running shield that is passed over to the winning IIT. The winner is decided based on the weighted sum of the points earned in various events held over a period of five days. Separate events for men and women are held and points are tallied separately for determining the final winner of the General Championship.<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a></p>
<p>The 12 events included in the Inter-IIT Sports are <a href="athletics_(track_and_field)" title="wikilink">athletics</a>, <a href="badminton" class="uri" title="wikilink">badminton</a>, <a href="basketball" class="uri" title="wikilink">basketball</a>, <a href="cricket" class="uri" title="wikilink">cricket</a>, <a href="football_(soccer)" title="wikilink">football</a>, <a href="field_hockey" title="wikilink">hockey</a>, <a href="swimming" class="uri" title="wikilink">swimming</a>, <a href="lawn_tennis" title="wikilink">lawn</a> and <a href="squash_tennis" title="wikilink">squash tennis</a>, <a href="table_tennis" title="wikilink">table tennis</a>, <a href="volleyball" class="uri" title="wikilink">volleyball</a>, <a href="water_polo" title="wikilink">water polo</a> and <a href="weightlifting" class="uri" title="wikilink">weightlifting</a>. As swimming and water polo are played in water, which is usually cold in the month of December, the <em>Inter-IIT Sports Meet</em> for them is held in the first week of October, and is called <em>Inter-IIT Aquatics Meet</em>.<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="recognition">Recognition</h2>
<p>The degrees provided by IITs are recognised by the <a href="All_India_Council_for_Technical_Education" title="wikilink">AICTE</a> and hence recognised by all institutions in India. Even outside India, IIT degrees are respected, largely due to the prestige of the IITs as created by their alumni. One of the contributing factors behind the success of IITs is the special status of the IITs as <em>Institutes of National Importance</em> under the <em>Indian Institute of Technology Act</em>. The IIT Act ensures that the IITs have special privileges and lays the foundation for them to evolve as world-class institutes. The autonomy ensured by the Act enables the IITs to implement changes quickly, to keep up with changing scenarios in both the educational world, and society in general. Student politics in IITs is kept under control with strict vigilance over the way student body elections are held. The IIT-JEE is another important factor behind the success of IITs, as it enables the IITs to accept only a select group of meritorious students. This combination of success factors has led to the concept of the <em>IIT Brand</em>.<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a> Other factors that have contributed to the success of IITs are stringent faculty recruitment procedures and industry collaboration. The procedure for selection of faculty in IITs is stricter as compared to other colleges offering similar degrees.<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a> The Ph.D. degree is a pre-requisite for all regular faculty appointments. The IITs have better interaction with various industries as compared to most other Indian colleges. The IITs are also considered highly successful institutions compared to other engineering colleges in India according to a number of educational surveys.</p>
<p>The view that IIT graduates are intelligent and hardworking people has been established by the success of IITians. Former IIT students get greater respect from their peers, academia and industry in general.<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a> The IIT brand was reaffirmed when the <a href="United_States_House_of_Representatives" title="wikilink">United States House of Representatives</a> passed a resolution honoring <a href="Indian_American" title="wikilink">Indian Americans</a> and especially graduates of IIT for their contributions to the American society.<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a> Similarly, <a href="People&#39;s_Republic_of_China" title="wikilink">China</a> also recognised the value of IITs and planned to replicate the model.<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="educational-rankings">Educational rankings</h3>
<p>Most IITs are consistently ranked above other engineering colleges in India in engineering education <a href="Statistical_survey" title="wikilink">surveys</a>,<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a> with regard to quality of faculty, teaching standards, research facilities and campus placements. In international surveys, the IITs fail to achieve top rankings. <a href="The_Times_Higher_Education_Supplement" title="wikilink">The Times Higher Education Supplement</a> (2006) ranked the IITs the 57<sup>th</sup> best overall universities in their <a href="The_Times_Higher_Education_Supplement" title="wikilink">World University Rankings</a><a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a> and gave IITs the 33<sup>th</sup> position globally for science. The IITs were ranked third-best worldwide for technology, after <a href="Massachusetts_Institute_of_Technology" title="wikilink">MIT</a> and <a href="University_of_California" title="wikilink">University of California</a>.<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a> In the <a href="Shanghai_Jiao_Tong_University" title="wikilink">Shanghai Jiao Tong University</a>'s <a href="Academic_Ranking_of_World_Universities" title="wikilink">Academic Ranking of World Universities</a>, only one IIT (IIT Kharagpur) was listed among the top 500 universities worldwide.<a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a> The IITs fall short in many parameters that are considered for educational rankings. The criteria for ranking<a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a> prominently include internationally recognised research output, in which the IITs do not achieve notable success.<a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a> Another criterion being the Social Science Citation Index, the rank of IITs suffers as they do not have large departments of liberal arts and social sciences. Since the IITs have only a few international faculty and students (except those by exchange programs), the rankings of IITs in many international surveys have suffered. Since the IITs have scored better under most educational ranking criteria than other Indian colleges and universities, they continue to achieve top positions in nationwide surveys.</p>

<h2 id="criticism">Criticism</h2>
<p>The IITs have faced criticism from within and outside academia. Major concerns include allegations that they encourage a <a href="brain_drain" title="wikilink">brain drain</a> and that their stringent entrance examinations encourage coaching colleges and skew the socio-economic profile of the student body. Other critics are concerned at the insufficient representation of women and the disadvantaged.</p>
<h3 id="brain-drain">Brain drain</h3>
<p>Among the criticisms of the IIT system by the media, academia and the people in general, the most prominent is that it encourages <a href="brain_drain" title="wikilink">brain drain</a>. Until the process of <a href="liberalisation" class="uri" title="wikilink">liberalisation</a> started in early 1990s, India was unable to provide good job opportunities to the graduates of IITs. This resulted in large scale emigration of IITians to western countries, especially to the United States. Since 1953, nearly twenty-five thousand IITians have settled in the USA.<a href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a> Since the USA benefited from subsidised education in IITs at the cost of Indian taxpayers' money, critics say that subsidising education in IITs is useless. Others support the emigration of graduates, arguing that the capital sent home by the IITians has been a major source of the expansion of <a href="Foreign_exchange_market" title="wikilink">foreign exchange</a> reserves for India, which, until the 1990s, had a substantial <a href="trade_deficit" title="wikilink">trade deficit</a>.</p>
<p>The extent of intellectual loss has receded substantially over the past decade, with the percentage of students going abroad dropping from as high as 70% to around 30% today.<a href="#fn67" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a> This is largely attributed to the liberalisation of the <a href="Economy_of_India" title="wikilink">Indian economy</a> and the opening of previously closed markets. Government initiatives are encouraging IIT students into entrepreneurship programs and are increasing foreign investment. Emerging scientific and manufacturing industries, and <a href="BPO" title="wikilink">outsourcing</a> of technical jobs from North America and Western Europe have created opportunities for aspiring graduates in India. Many undergraduates go abroad to pursue further studies, such as MS and PhD.</p>
<h3 id="entrance-competition">Entrance competition</h3>
<p>The highly competitive examination in the form of IIT-JEE has led to establishment of a large number of coaching institutes throughout the country that provide intensive, and specific preparation for the IIT-JEE for substantial fees. It is argued that this favours students from specific regions and richer backgrounds. Some coaching institutes say that they have individually coached nearly 800 successful candidates year after year.<a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a> According to some estimates, nearly 95% of all students who clear the IIT-JEE had joined coaching classes.<a href="#fn69" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref69"><sup>69</sup></a> The psychological stress and emotional trauma faced by candidates not able to pass the examination and their families is considered to be a serious problem. This has led to criticism of the way the examinations are conducted. The IIT-JEE format was restructured in 2006 following these complaints.<a href="#fn70" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a></p>
<p>After the change to the objective pattern of questioning, even the students who initially considered themselves not fit for subjective pattern of IIT-JEE decided to take the examination. Though the restructuring was meant to reduce the dependence of students on coaching classes, it led to an increase in students registering for coaching classes.<a href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a> Some people (mostly IITians) have criticised the changed pattern of the IIT-JEE. Their reasoning is that while IIT-JEE traditionally used to test students understanding of fundamentals and his ability to apply them to solve large unseen problems, the current pattern does not stress much on the application part.<a href="#fn72" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref72"><sup>72</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="alumni">Alumni</h2>
<p><img src="VGSOM_IITKGP.jpg" title="fig:Vinod Gupta School of Management in IIT Kharagpur" alt="Vinod Gupta School of Management in IIT Kharagpur" /> The IITians are known for their loyalty to their <a href="alma_mater" title="wikilink">alma mater</a> and many IIT Alumni Associations are active in India and abroad. The IIT alumni either help their alma mater in the form of donations, or by preferential job opportunities extended to students from the IITs. The <a href="Vinod_Gupta_School_of_Management" title="wikilink">Vinod Gupta School of Management</a> at IIT Kharagpur and <a href="Shailesh_J._Mehta_School_of_Management" title="wikilink">Shailesh J. Mehta School of Management</a> at IIT Bombay are management schools within IITs that have been established largely by alumni donations; these schools were named after their benefactors.</p>
<p>Many IIT alumni have become entrepreneurs, including <a href="N.R._Narayana_Murthy" title="wikilink">N.R.
