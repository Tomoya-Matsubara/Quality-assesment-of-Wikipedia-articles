<p><strong>Augustine of Canterbury</strong> (died <a href="May_26" title="wikilink">May 26</a>, <a href="604" class="uri" title="wikilink">604</a>) was a <a href="Benedictine" class="uri" title="wikilink">Benedictine</a> <a href="monk" class="uri" title="wikilink">monk</a> who became the first <a href="Archbishop_of_Canterbury" title="wikilink">Archbishop of Canterbury</a> in 598. He is considered the &quot;Apostle to the English&quot;,<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> and a founder of the English Church.</p>
<p>Augustine was the <a href="prior" class="uri" title="wikilink">prior</a> of a monastery in Rome when <a href="Pope_Gregory_I" title="wikilink">Pope Gregory the Great</a> chose him in 595 to lead a mission to Britain to convert the <a href="Paganism" title="wikilink">pagan</a> King <a href="&lt;U+00C6&gt;thelberht_of_Kent" title="wikilink">&lt;U+00C6&gt;thelberht</a> of <a href="Kingdom_of_Kent" title="wikilink">Kent</a> to <a href="Christianity" class="uri" title="wikilink">Christianity</a>. Kent was probably chosen because it was near the Christian kingdoms in <a href="Gaul" class="uri" title="wikilink">Gaul</a>, and because &lt;U+00C6&gt;thelberht had married a Christian princess, <a href="Bertha_of_Kent" title="wikilink">Bertha</a>, daughter of <a href="Charibert" class="uri" title="wikilink">Charibert</a>, the <a href="List_of_Frankish_kings" title="wikilink">King of Paris</a>, who was expected to exert some influence over her husband. Although the missionaries considered turning back before they reached Kent, Gregory urged them on, and in 597 Augustine landed on the <a href="Isle_of_Thanet" title="wikilink">Isle of Thanet</a> and proceeded to &lt;U+00C6&gt;thelberht's main town of Canterbury.</p>
<p>&lt;U+00C6&gt;thelberht allowed the missionaries to preach freely and converted to Christianity, giving the missionaries land to found a monastery outside the city walls. Augustine was consecrated bishop of the English, and converted many of the king's subjects, including thousands during a mass baptism on <a href="Christmas_Day" title="wikilink">Christmas Day</a> in 597. Pope Gregory sent more missionaries in 601, along with encouraging letters and gifts for the churches, although attempts to persuade the native <a href="Celt" title="wikilink">Celtic</a> bishops to submit to Augustine's authority failed. <a href="Roman_Catholic" title="wikilink">Roman Catholic</a> bishops were established at London and Rochester in 604, and a school was founded to train <a href="Anglo-Saxon" class="uri" title="wikilink">Anglo-Saxon</a> priests and missionaries. Augustine arranged the consecration of his successor, <a href="Laurence_of_Canterbury" title="wikilink">Laurence of Canterbury</a>.</p>
<p>Augustine died in 604 and was soon revered as a <a href="saint" class="uri" title="wikilink">saint</a>. The authority of the Roman Catholic Church over the <a href="Church_of_England" title="wikilink">Church of England</a> remained in place for ten centuries, until the latter broke away in the 16th century during the <a href="English_Reformation" title="wikilink">English Reformation</a>.</p>
<h2 id="background-to-the-mission">Background to the mission</h2>
<p>After the withdrawal of the <a href="Roman_Empire" title="wikilink">Roman</a> <a href="Roman_legion" title="wikilink">legions</a> from the province of Britannia in 410, the natives of the island of <a href="Great_Britain" title="wikilink">Great Britain</a> were left to defend themselves against the attacks of the Saxons. Before the withdrawal Britannia had been converted to Christianity and had even produced its own heretic in <a href="Pelagius" class="uri" title="wikilink">Pelagius</a>. After the legions left, pagan tribes settled the southern parts of the island, but Western Britain, beyond the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms, remained Christian. This native <a href="Celtic_Christianity" title="wikilink">British Church</a> developed in isolation from Rome under the influence of missionaries from Ireland.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a><a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> This British church was centred on monasteries instead of bishoprics. Other distinguishing characteristics were its calculation of the date of <a href="Easter" class="uri" title="wikilink">Easter</a> and the style of the <a href="tonsure" class="uri" title="wikilink">tonsure</a> haircut that clerics wore.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a><a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> Evidence for the survival of Christianity in the eastern part of Britain during this time includes the survival of the cult of <a href="Saint_Alban" title="wikilink">St Alban</a> and the occurrence of <em>eccles</em>, derived from the Latin for church, in place names.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> There is no evidence that these native Christians tried to convert the Anglo-Saxons.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a><a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p>It was against this background that Pope Gregory I decided to send a mission to convert the <a href="Anglo-Saxons" class="uri" title="wikilink">Anglo-Saxons</a> to Christianity in 595.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> The <a href="Kingdom_of_Kent" title="wikilink">Kingdom of Kent</a> was ruled by &lt;U+00C6&gt;thelberht, who had married a Christian princess named <a href="Bertha_of_Kent" title="wikilink">Bertha</a> before 588.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> Bertha was the daughter of <a href="Charibert_I" title="wikilink">Charibert I</a>, one of the <a href="Merovingian" class="uri" title="wikilink">Merovingian</a> kings of the <a href="Franks" class="uri" title="wikilink">Franks</a>. As one of the conditions of her marriage she had brought a bishop named Liudhard with her to Kent.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> Together in Canterbury, they restored a church that dated to Roman times<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a>â€”possibly the current <a href="St_Martin&#39;s_Church,_Canterbury" title="wikilink">St Martin's Church, Canterbury</a>. &lt;U+00C6&gt;thelberht was a <a href="Anglo-Saxon_paganism" title="wikilink">pagan</a> at this point but allowed his wife freedom of worship. One biographer of Bertha states that under his wife's influence, &lt;U+00C6&gt;thelberht asked Pope Gregory to send missionaries.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> The historian Ian Wood feels that the initiative came from the Kentish court as well as the queen.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> Other historians, however, feel that Gregory initiated the mission, although the exact reasons remain unclear. A famous story recorded by Bede relates that Gregory saw fair-haired Saxon slaves from Britain in the Roman slave market and was inspired to try to convert their people.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a><a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> More practical matters, such as the acquisition of new provinces acknowledging the primacy of the papacy, and a desire to influence the emerging power of the Kentish kingdom under &lt;U+00C6&gt;thelberht, were probably involved.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> The mission may have been an outgrowth of the missionary efforts against the <a href="Lombard" title="wikilink">Lombards</a>.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
<p>The choice of Kent and &lt;U+00C6&gt;thelberht was probably dictated by a number of factors, including the fact that &lt;U+00C6&gt;thelberht had allowed his wife to worship freely. Trade between the Franks and &lt;U+00C6&gt;thelberht's kingdom was well established, and the language barrier between the two regions was apparently only a minor obstacle, as the interpreters for the mission came from the Franks. Another reason for the mission was the growing power of the Kentish kingdom. Since the eclipse of King <a href="Ceawlin_of_Wessex" title="wikilink">Ceawlin of Wessex</a> in 592, &lt;U+00C6&gt;thelberht was the leading Anglo-Saxon ruler; <a href="Bede" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bede</a>, an eighth-century monk who wrote a history of the English church, refers to &lt;U+00C6&gt;thelberht as having <a href="imperium" class="uri" title="wikilink">imperium</a> (overlordship) south of the <a href="Humber" title="wikilink">River Humber</a>. Lastly, the location of Kent near the Franks allowed support from a Christian area.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a></p>
<p>In 595, Gregory chose Augustine, who was the prior of the abbey of St Anthony in Rome, to head the mission to Kent.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> Gregory selected monks to accompany Augustine and sought support from the Frankish kingdom. The Pope wrote to a number of Frankish bishops on Augustine's behalf, introducing the mission and asking that Augustine and his companions be made welcome. Copies of letters to some of these bishops survive in Rome. The pope wrote to King <a href="Theuderic_II" title="wikilink">Theuderic II</a> of <a href="Burgundy" class="uri" title="wikilink">Burgundy</a> and to King <a href="Theudebert_II" title="wikilink">Theudebert II</a> of <a href="Austrasia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Austrasia</a>, as well as their grandmother <a href="Brunhilda_of_Austrasia" title="wikilink">Brunhild</a>, seeking aid for the mission. Gregory thanked King <a href="Chlothar_II" title="wikilink">Chlothar II</a> of <a href="Neustria" class="uri" title="wikilink">Neustria</a> for aiding Augustine. Besides hospitality, the Frankish bishops and kings provided interpreters, and were asked to allow some Frankish priests to accompany the mission.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> By soliciting help from the Frankish kings and bishops, Gregory helped to assure a friendly reception for Augustine in Kent, as &lt;U+00C6&gt;thelbert was unlikely to mistreat a mission who visibly had the support of his wife's relatives and people.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> The Franks at this time were attempting to extend their influence in Kent, and helping Augustine's mission would further that goal. Chlothar, in particular, needed a friendly realm across the Channel to help guard his kingdom's flanks against his fellow Frankish kings.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a></p>
<p>Sources make no mention of why Pope Gregory chose a monk to head the mission. Pope Gregory once wrote to &lt;U+00C6&gt;thelberht complimenting Augustine's knowledge of the <a href="Bible" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bible</a>, so Augustine was evidently well-educated. Other qualifications included administrative ability, for Gregory was the abbot of St Anthony as well as being pope, which left the day-to-day running of the abbey to Augustine, the prior.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="arrival-and-first-efforts">Arrival and first efforts</h2>
<p>Augustine was accompanied by <a href="Laurence_of_Canterbury" title="wikilink">Laurence of Canterbury</a>, his eventual successor to the <a href="archbishop" title="wikilink">archbishopric</a>, and a group of about 40 companions, some of whom were monks.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> Soon after leaving Rome, the missionaries halted, daunted by nature of the task before them. They sent Augustine back to Rome to request papal permission to return. Gregory refused and sent Augustine back with letters encouraging the missionaries to persevere.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> In 597, Augustine and his companions landed in Kent.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> They achieved some initial success soon after their arrival:<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a><a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> &lt;U+00C6&gt;thelberht permitted the missionaries to settle and preach in his capital of <a href="Canterbury" class="uri" title="wikilink">Canterbury</a> where they used the church of St Martin's for services.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> Neither Bede nor Gregory mentions the date of &lt;U+00C6&gt;thelberht's conversion,<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> but it probably took place in 597. In the early medieval period, large scale conversions required the ruler's conversion first, and Augustine is recorded as making large numbers of converts within a year of his arrival in Kent.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> Also, by 601, Gregory was writing to both &lt;U+00C6&gt;thelberht and Bertha, calling the king his son and referring to his baptism.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> A late medieval tradition, recorded by the 15th-century chronicler <a href="Thomas_Elmham" title="wikilink">Thomas Elmham</a>, gives the date of the king's conversion as <a href="Pentecost" title="wikilink">Whit Sunday</a>, or <a href="June_2" title="wikilink">June 2</a> <a href="597" class="uri" title="wikilink">597</a>; there is no reason to doubt this date, although there is no other evidence for it.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a></p>
<p>Augustine established his <a href="episcopal_see" title="wikilink">episcopal see</a> at Canterbury.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> It is not clear when and where Augustine was consecrated as a bishop. Bede, writing about a century later, states that Augustine was consecrated by the Frankish Archbishop &lt;U+00C6&gt;therius of <a href="Arles" class="uri" title="wikilink">Arles</a> after the conversion of &lt;U+00C6&gt;thelberht. Contemporary letters from Pope Gregory, however, refer to Augustine as a bishop before he arrived in England. A letter of Gregory's from September 597 calls Augustine a bishop, and one ten months later says that Augustine had been consecrated on Gregory's command by bishops of the Germanies.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a></p>
<p><img src="English_kingdoms_600.gif" title="fig:Map of the general outlines of the British kingdoms about 600" alt="Map of the general outlines of the British kingdoms about 600" /> Soon after his arrival, Augustine founded the <a href="monastery" class="uri" title="wikilink">monastery</a> of Saints <a href="Saint_Peter" title="wikilink">Peter</a> and <a href="Saint_Paul" title="wikilink">Paul</a>, which later became <a href="St_Augustine&#39;s_Abbey" title="wikilink">St Augustine's Abbey</a>,<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> on land donated by the king.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> In a letter Gregory wrote to the <a href="patriarch_of_Alexandria" title="wikilink">patriarch of Alexandria</a> in 598, he claimed that more than 10,000 Christians had been baptised; the number may be exaggerated but there is no reason to doubt that a mass conversion took place.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a><a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> However, there were probably some Christians already in Kent before Augustine arrived, remnants of the Christians who lived in Britain in the later Roman Empire.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a></p>
<p>After these conversions, Augustine sent Laurence back to Rome with a report of his success along with questions about the mission.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> Bede records the letter and Gregory's replies in chapter 27 of his <em><a href="Historia_ecclesiastica_gentis_Anglorum" title="wikilink">Ecclesiastical History</a></em>: Augustine asked for Gregory's advice on a number of issues, including how to organise the church, the punishment for church robbers, guidance on who was allowed to marry whom, and the consecration of bishops. Other topics were relations between the churches of Britain and Gaul, childbirth and baptism, and when it was lawful for people to receive communion and for a priest to celebrate mass.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a></p>
<p>Further missionaries were sent from Rome in 601. They brought a <a href="pallium" class="uri" title="wikilink">pallium</a> for Augustine and a present of sacred vessels, <a href="vestment" title="wikilink">vestments</a>, <a href="relic" title="wikilink">relics</a>, and books. The pallium was the symbol of <a href="Metropolitan_bishop" title="wikilink">metropolitan</a> status, and signified that Augustine was now an archbishop. Along with the pallium, a letter from Gregory directed the new archbishop to ordain 12 <a href="suffragan_bishop" title="wikilink">suffragan bishops</a> as soon as possible and to send a bishop to <a href="York" class="uri" title="wikilink">York</a>. Gregory's plan was that there would be two metropolitans, one at York and one at London, with 12 suffragan bishops under each archbishop. As part of this plan, Augustine was expected to transfer his archiepiscopal see to <a href="London" class="uri" title="wikilink">London</a> from Canterbury. The move from Canterbury to London never happened; no contemporary sources give the reason,<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> but it was probably because London was not part of &lt;U+00C6&gt;thelberht's domains. Instead, London was part of the <a href="kingdom_of_Essex" title="wikilink">kingdom of Essex</a>, ruled by &lt;U+00C6&gt;thelberht's nephew <a href="Saebert_of_Essex" title="wikilink">Saebert of Essex</a>, who converted to Christianity in 604.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a><a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> The historian S. Brechter has suggested that the metropolitan see was indeed moved to London, and that it was only with the abandonment of London as a see after the death of &lt;U+00C6&gt;thelberht that Canterbury became the archiepiscopal see. This theory contradicts Bede's version of events, however.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="additional-work">Additional work</h2>
<p><img src="EthelbertofKent.jpg" title="fig:St &lt;U+00C6&gt;thelberht of Kent pictured in a statue from Rochester Cathedral" alt="St &lt;U+00C6&gt;thelberht of Kent pictured in a statue from Rochester Cathedral" /> In 604, Augustine founded two more bishoprics in Britain. Two men who had come to Britain with him in 601 were consecrated, <a href="Mellitus" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mellitus</a> as <a href="Bishop_of_London" title="wikilink">Bishop of London</a> and <a href="Justus" class="uri" title="wikilink">Justus</a> as <a href="Bishop_of_Rochester" title="wikilink">Bishop of Rochester</a>.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a><a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a><a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a> Bede relates that Augustine, with the help of the king, &quot;recovered&quot; a church which had been built by Roman Christians in Canterbury.<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a><a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a> It is not clear if Bede meant that Augustine rebuilt the church or that Augustine merely reconsecrated a building that had been used for pagan worship. Archaeological evidence seems to support the latter interpretation; in 1973 the remains of an aisled building dating from the Romano-British period were uncovered just south of the present <a href="Canterbury_Cathedral" title="wikilink">Canterbury Cathedral</a>.<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a></p>
<p>Augustine failed to extend his authority to the Christians in <a href="Wales" class="uri" title="wikilink">Wales</a> and <a href="Dumnonia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Dumnonia</a> to the west. Gregory had decreed that these Christians should submit to Augustine and that their bishops should obey him.<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a> According to the narrative of Bede, the Britons in these regions viewed Augustine with uncertainty, and their suspicion was compounded by a diplomatic misjudgement on Augustine's part.<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a> In 603, Augustine and &lt;U+00C6&gt;thelberht summoned the British bishops to a meeting. These guests retired early to confer with their people,<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a> who, according to Bede, advised them to judge Augustine based upon the respect he displayed at their next meeting. When Augustine failed to rise from his seat on the entrance of the British bishops,<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a> they refused to recognise him as archbishop.<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a><a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a> There were, however, deep differences between Augustine and the British church that perhaps played a more significant role in preventing an agreement. At issue were the <a href="tonsure" class="uri" title="wikilink">tonsure</a>, the observance of <a href="Easter" class="uri" title="wikilink">Easter</a>, and practical and deep-rooted differences in approach to asceticism, missionary endeavours, and how the church itself was organised.<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a> Some historians believe that Augustine had no real understanding of the history and traditions of the British church, damaging his relations with their bishops.<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="further-success">Further success</h2>
<p>Easier to implement were Rome's mandates concerning pagan temples and celebrations. Temples were to be consecrated for Christian use,<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a> and celebrations, if possible, transformed into feasts celebrating Christian martyrs. One religious site was revealed to be a shrine of a local St Sixtus, whose worshippers were unaware of details of the martyr's life or death. They may have been native Christians, but Augustine did not treat them as such. When Gregory was informed, he told Augustine to stop the cult and use the shrine for the Roman <a href="Pope_Sixtus_II" title="wikilink">St Sixtus</a>.<a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a></p>
<p>Gregory legislated on the behaviour of the laity and the clergy. He placed the new mission directly under papal authority and made it clear that English bishops would have no authority over Frankish counterparts nor vice versa. Other directives dealt with the training of native clergy and the missionaries' conduct.<a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a></p>
<p>The <a href="King&#39;s_School,_Canterbury" title="wikilink">King's School, Canterbury</a> claims Augustine as its founder, which would make it the world's oldest existing school, but the first documentary records of the school date from the 16th century.<a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a> Augustine did establish a school, and soon after his death Canterbury was able to send teachers out to support the East Anglian mission.<a href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a> Augustine received liturgical books from the pope, but their exact contents are unknown. They may have been some of the new mass books that were being written at this time. The exact liturgy that Augustine introduced to England remains unknown, but it would have been a form of the <a href="Latin" class="uri" title="wikilink">Latin</a> language liturgy which was in use at Rome.<a href="#fn67" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="death-and-legacy">Death and legacy</h2>
<p>Before his death, Augustine consecrated <a href="Laurence_of_Canterbury" title="wikilink">Laurence of Canterbury</a> as his successor to the archbishopric, probably to ensure an orderly transfer of office.<a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a> Although at the time of Augustine's death, <a href="May_26" title="wikilink">May 26</a> <a href="604" class="uri" title="wikilink">604</a>,<a href="#fn69" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref69"><sup>69</sup></a> the mission barely extended beyond Kent, his undertaking introduced a more active missionary style into the British Isles. Although there had been Christians in Ireland and Wales earlier, no efforts had been made to try to convert the Saxon invaders. Augustine was sent to convert the descendants of those invaders, and eventually became the decisive influence in Christianity in the British Isles.<a href="#fn70" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a><a href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a> Much of his success came about because of Augustine's close relationship with &lt;U+00C6&gt;thelberht, which gave the archbishop time to establish himself.<a href="#fn72" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref72"><sup>72</sup></a> Augustine's example also influenced the great missionary efforts of the Anglo-Saxon Church.<a href="#fn73" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref73"><sup>73</sup></a><a href="#fn74" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref74"><sup>74</sup></a></p>
<p>Augustine's body was originally buried in the portico of what is now St Augustine's, Canterbury,<a href="#fn75" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref75"><sup>75</sup></a> but it was later exhumed and placed in a tomb within the abbey church, where it became a place of pilgrimage and veneration. After the <a href="Norman_conquest_of_England" title="wikilink">Norman Conquest</a> the cult of St Augustine was actively promoted.<a href="#fn76" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref76"><sup>76</sup></a> During the <a href="English_Reformation" title="wikilink">English Reformation</a>, the shrine was destroyed and the relics were lost.<a href="#fn77" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref77"><sup>77</sup></a> Today a Celtic cross marks the area where Augustine first landed. It is situated near Pegwell village on the Isle of <a href="Thanet" class="uri" title="wikilink">Thanet</a> in <a href="East_Kent" title="wikilink">East Kent</a>.<a href="#fn78" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref78"><sup>78</sup></a></p>

<li id="fn52">The actual Latin is from Chapter 33, Book 1 of Bede, and an online version is <a href="http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/bede/bede1.shtml#33">here</a>. The sentence in question is &quot;AT Augustinus, ubi in regia ciuitate sedem episcopalem, ut praediximus, accepit, recuperauit in ea, regio fultus adminiculo, ecclesiam, quam inibi antiquo Romanorum fidelium opere factam fuisse didicerat, et eam in nomine sancti Saluatoris Dei et Domini nostri Iesu Christi sacrauit, atque ibidem sibi habitationem statuit et cunctis successoribus suis.&quot;  The Latin word <em>recuperauit</em> could be translated either &quot;repaired&quot; or &quot;recovered&quot;. Sherley-Price translates the sentence as &quot;Having been granted his episcopal see in the royal capital, as already recorded, Augustine proceeded with the king's help to repair a church which he was informed had been built long ago by Roman Christians.&quot; Bede <em>History of the English Church and People</em> p. 91<a href="#fnref52" class="footnote-back">â†©</a></li>
