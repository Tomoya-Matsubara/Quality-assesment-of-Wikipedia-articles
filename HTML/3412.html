<p>The <strong>1689 Boston revolt</strong> was a popular uprising on April 18, 1689, by <a href="Boston" title="wikilink">Bostonians</a> against the rule of Sir <a href="Edmund_Andros" title="wikilink">Edmund Andros</a>, the unpopular governor of the <a href="Dominion_of_New_England" title="wikilink">Dominion of New England</a>. A well-organized &quot;mob&quot; of provincial militia and citizens formed in the city, arresting dominion officials and adherents of the <a href="Church_of_England" title="wikilink">Church of England</a>, who were suspected of being sympathetic to the dominion rulers. Leaders of the former <a href="Massachusetts_Bay_Colony" title="wikilink">Massachusetts Bay Colony</a> then reclaimed control, and members of colonial governments replaced by that of the dominion retook control of their respective colonies.</p>
<p>Andros, commissioned governor of New England in 1686, had earned the enmity of the local populace by enforcing the restrictive <a href="Navigation_Acts" title="wikilink">Navigation Acts</a> and vacating land titles, among other actions, which included the appointments of unpopular regular officers to lead colonial militia. Furthermore, he had infuriated Boston <a href="Puritan" title="wikilink">Puritans</a> by promoting the <a href="Church_of_England" title="wikilink">Church of England</a>, disliked by many <a href="non-Conformist" class="uri" title="wikilink">non-Conformist</a> New England colonists.</p>
<h2 id="background">Background</h2>

<p>Sir <a href="Edmund_Andros" title="wikilink">Edmund Andros</a> was in 1686 appointed governor of the <a href="Dominion_of_New_England" title="wikilink">Dominion of New England</a>, which initially consisted of the territories of the <a href="Massachusetts_Bay_Colony" title="wikilink">Massachusetts Bay</a>, <a href="Connecticut_Colony" title="wikilink">Connecticut</a>, <a href="Province_of_New_Hampshire" title="wikilink">New Hampshire</a>, and <a href="Colony_of_Rhode_Island_and_Providence_Plantations" title="wikilink">Rhode Island</a> colonies,<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> but was expanded to include <a href="Province_of_New_York" title="wikilink">New York</a> and <a href="East_Jersey" title="wikilink">East</a> and <a href="West_Jersey" title="wikilink">West Jersey</a> in 1688.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> Andros' rule was extremely unpopular in New England. He ruled with disregard to local representation, vacated land titles in Massachusetts, restricted <a href="town_meeting" title="wikilink">town meetings</a>, and actively promoted the <a href="Church_of_England" title="wikilink">Church of England</a> in the largely <a href="Puritan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Puritan</a> colonies.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> He enforced the <a href="Navigation_Acts" title="wikilink">Navigation Acts</a>, unpopular laws that threatened the legality of certain New England trading practices.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> The royal troops stationed in Boston, many of whose officers were <a href="Conformists" class="uri" title="wikilink">Conformists</a>, were also disliked. Some of those officers, who were put in command of colonial militia, treated their men harshly, and were noted as supporters of the disliked governor.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>In England, <a href="James_II_of_England" title="wikilink">King James II</a>, who had established the dominion, became increasingly unpopular, and also alienated a number of important power centers in England. The king alienated otherwise supportive Tories with his attempts to relax <a href="Penal_law#English_statutes_on_religious_nonconformity" title="wikilink">penal laws</a>,<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> and in 1687 issued the <a href="Declaration_of_Indulgence" title="wikilink">Declaration of Indulgence</a>, a move opposed by the Anglican church hierarchy. He increased the power of the regular army, an action seen by many Parliamentarians as a threat to their authority, and placed Catholics in important military positions.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a><a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> James also attempted to place sympathisers in Parliament, in order to make the repealing of the <a href="Test_Act" title="wikilink">Test Act</a> (which required a strict Anglican religious test for many civil offices) an easier process.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> Matters reached crisis proportions in the Protestant community in England with the birth of his son <a href="James_Francis_Edward_Stuart" title="wikilink">James</a> in June 1688.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> Since this meant there would probably be a Catholic succession, some Whigs and Tories set aside their political differences and conspired to replace James with his Protestant son-in-law, <a href="William_III_of_England" title="wikilink">William, Prince of Orange</a>.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> The Dutch prince, who had been involved in fruitless efforts to get James to reconsider his policies,<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> was agreeable to an invasion, and the <a href="Glorious_Revolution" title="wikilink">nearly bloodless revolution</a> that followed in November and December 1688 established William and his wife <a href="Mary_II_of_England" title="wikilink">Mary</a> as <a href="William_and_Mary" title="wikilink">co-rulers</a>.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<p>The religious leaders of Massachusetts, led by <a href="Cotton_Mather" title="wikilink">Cotton</a> and <a href="Increase_Mather" title="wikilink">Increase Mather</a>, were opposed to the rule of Andros and organized dissent targeted to influence the court in London. After King James published the Declaration of Indulgence, Increase Mather sent an appreciation letter to the king regarding the declaration, and suggested to other Massachusetts pastors that they also express gratitude to the king as a means to gain favor and influence.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> Ten pastors agreed to do so, and they decided to send Mather to England to press their case against Andros.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> Despite dominion secretary Edward Randolph's repeated attempts to stop him (including criminal charges), Mather was clandestinely spirited aboard a ship bound for England in April 1688.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> He and other Massachusetts agents were received by James, who promised in October 1688 that the colony's concerns would be addressed. The events of the revolution, however, overtook this attempt to gain redress.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
<p><img src="Sir_Edmund_Andros.jpg" title="fig:Dominion Governor Sir Edmund Andros" alt="Dominion Governor Sir Edmund Andros" /> The Massachusetts agents then petitioned the new monarchs and the Lords of Trade (predecessors to the <a href="Board_of_Trade" title="wikilink">Board of Trade</a> that oversaw colonial affairs) for restoration of Massachusetts's colonial charter, revoked by Andros. Mather furthermore convinced the Lords of Trade to delay notifying Andros of the revolution.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> He had already dispatched, to previous colonial governor <a href="Simon_Bradstreet" title="wikilink">Simon Bradstreet</a>, a letter containing news of a report (prepared before the revolution) stating that the charter had been illegally annulled, and that the magistrates should &quot;prepare the minds of the people for a change.&quot;<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> News of the revolution apparently reached some individuals in Boston before official news arrived. <a href="John_Nelson_(merchant)" title="wikilink">John Nelson</a>, a Boston merchant who would figure prominently in the revolt, wrote of the events in a letter dated to late March,<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> and the news prompted a meeting of senior anti-Andros political and religious leaders in Massachusetts.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a></p>
<p>Andros had first received warnings of the impending revolution while leading an expedition to fortify Pemaquid (present-day <a href="Bristol,_Maine" title="wikilink">Bristol, Maine</a>) against French and Indian attacks. On January 19 (of either 1688 or 1689) he issued a proclamation warning against Protestant agitation and prohibiting an uprising against the dominion.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> The military force he led in Maine was comprised of British regulars and militia from Massachusetts and Maine. The militia companies were commanded by regulars, who imposed harsh discipline that did nothing to make the militia appreciate them.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> Alerted to the meetings taking place in Boston, Andros returned there from Maine in mid-March.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> Amid rumors that Andros had abandoned them as part of a &quot;popish plot&quot;, the militia in Maine mutinied, and those from Massachusetts began to make their way home.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> When a proclamation of the revolution reached Boston in early April, Andros had the messenger arrested, but his news was distributed, emboldening the people.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> Andros wrote to his commander at Pemaquid on April 16 that &quot;there is a general buzzing among the people, great with expectation of their old charter&quot;, even as he prepared to have the returning deserters arrested and shipped back to Maine.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> This increased tensions between the people of Boston and the dominion government, since it would involve some colonial militia arresting other colonists.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="revolt-in-boston">Revolt in Boston</h2>
<p>At about 5:00 am on April 18, militia companies began gathering outside Boston at <a href="Charlestown,_Massachusetts" title="wikilink">Charlestown</a> (then a separate community), just across the <a href="Charles_River" title="wikilink">Charles River</a>, and at <a href="Roxbury,_Boston" title="wikilink">Roxbury</a> (also then not part of Boston), at the far end of the <a href="Boston_Neck" title="wikilink">neck</a> connecting Boston to the mainland. At about 8:00 am the Charlestown companies boarded boats and crossed the river, while the Roxbury companies marched down the neck and into the city. While they did this, conspirators from the <a href="Ancient_and_Honorable_Artillery_Company_of_Massachusetts" title="wikilink">Ancient and Honorable Artillery Company</a> entered the homes of the regimental drummers in the city, confiscating their equipment. The militia companies joined forces at about 8:30, joined by a growing mob, and began arresting dominion and regimental leaders.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> They eventually surrounded Fort Mary, the garrison where Andros had his quarters.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a></p>
<p><img src="Boston1692.jpg" title="fig:In this detail from a 1692 map, the Boston peninsula is near the upper left, the Charlestown peninsula is at the top, and Castle Island is visible to the lower left. Fort Mary can be seen on the lower side of the Boston peninsula." alt="In this detail from a 1692 map, the Boston peninsula is near the upper left, the Charlestown peninsula is at the top, and Castle Island is visible to the lower left. Fort Mary can be seen on the lower side of the Boston peninsula." width="200" /> Among the first to be arrested was Captain John George of the HMS <em>Rose</em>, who came ashore between 9:00 and 10:00, only to be met by a platoon of militia.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> By about 10:00, most of the dominion and military officials had either been arrested or fled to the safety of <a href="Castle_Island_(Massachusetts)" title="wikilink">Castle Island</a> or one of the other fortified outposts. Most of Boston's Anglican population was rounded up by the mob.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> Sometime before noon an orange flag was raised on <a href="Beacon_Hill,_Boston" title="wikilink">Beacon Hill</a>, signaling another 1,500 militiamen to enter the city. These troops formed up in the market square, where a declaration was read. In it, the leaders claimed to support &quot;the noble Undertaking of the Prince of Orange&quot;, and were rising up because of a &quot;horrid <em>Popish Plot</em>&quot; that had been uncovered.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a></p>
<p>The old Massachusetts colonial leadership, headed by ex-governor Simon Bradstreet, then summoned Governor Andros to surrender, for his own safety because of the mob which they claimed &quot;whereof we were wholly ignorant&quot;.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> He refused and instead tried to escape to the <em>Rose</em>. The boat sent from the <em>Rose</em>, however, was intercepted by militia, and Andros was forced back into Fort Mary.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> Negotiations ensued and Andros agreed to leave the fort to meet with the rebel council. Promised safe conduct, he was marched under guard to the townhouse where the council had assembled. There he was told that &quot;they must and would have the Government in their own hands&quot;, and that he was under arrest.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> He was taken to the home of dominion treasurer John Usher, and held under close watch.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a></p>
<p>The <em>Rose</em> and Fort William on Castle Island refused to surrender immediately. On the 19th, when the ship's crew on the <em>Rose</em> was told that the captain had planned to take the ship to France to join the exiled James, a struggle ensued on board, with the Protestants among the crew succeeding in taking down the ship's rigging. This was seen by the troops on Castle Island, who surrendered not long after.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="aftermath">Aftermath</h2>
<p><a href="Image:Sbradstreet.jpg" title="wikilink">thumb|right|upright=0.5|Former Massachusetts Governor <a href="Simon_Bradstreet" title="wikilink">Simon Bradstreet</a></a> After Fort Mary fell on the 19th, Andros was moved there from Usher's house. He was confined with <a href="Joseph_Dudley" title="wikilink">Joseph Dudley</a> and other dominion officials until June 7, when he was transferred to Castle Island. It is during this period of captivity that he is said to have attempted an escape dressed in women's clothing. The story, although circulated widely, was disputed by the Anglican minister in Boston, Robert Ratcliff, who claimed that story and others had &quot;not the least foundation of Truth&quot;, and that they were &quot;falsehoods, and lies&quot; propagated to &quot;render the Governour odious to his people.&quot;<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> Andros did make a successful escape from Castle Island on August 2, after his servant plied the sentries with drink. He managed to flee to Rhode Island, but was recaptured soon thereafter and kept in what was virtually solitary confinement.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> He and others arrested in the wake of the revolt were held for 10 months before being sent to England for trial.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> Massachusetts agents in London refused to sign the documents making the charges against Andros, so he was summarily acquitted and released.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> He later served as governor of <a href="Province_of_Virginia" title="wikilink">Virginia</a> and <a href="Province_of_Maryland" title="wikilink">Maryland</a>.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="dissolution-of-the-dominion">Dissolution of the dominion</h2>
<p>When the other New England colonies in the dominion were informed of the overthrow of Andros, the old authorities moved quickly to restore their replaced governments.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> Rhode Island and Connecticut resumed governance under their earlier charters, and Massachusetts resumed governance according to its vacated charter.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a> New Hampshire was temporarily left without formal government and was controlled by Massachusetts and its governor, Simon Bradstreet, who served as <em>de facto</em> ruler of the northern colony.<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> Plymouth also resumed its previous form of governance.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a> In 1691 William and Mary issued a new charter for the <a href="Province_of_Massachusetts_Bay" title="wikilink">Province of Massachusetts Bay</a>, which encompassed the territories of both of the former colonies, Massachusetts Bay and Plymouth, as well as present-day Maine, <a href="Nova_Scotia" title="wikilink">Nova Scotia</a>, <a href="New_Brunswick" title="wikilink">New Brunswick</a>. The isles south of <a href="Cape_Cod" title="wikilink">Cape Cod</a>, such as <a href="Nantucket" class="uri" title="wikilink">Nantucket</a>, <a href="Martha&#39;s_Vineyard" title="wikilink">Martha's Vineyard</a>, and the <a href="Elizabeth_Islands" title="wikilink">Elizabeth Islands</a>, were also included under this charter.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a></p>
<p>During his captivity, Andros had been able to send a message to <a href="Francis_Nicholson" title="wikilink">Francis Nicholson</a>, his <a href="New_York_City" title="wikilink">New York</a>-based lieutenant governor. Nicholson received the request for assistance in mid-May, but rising tensions in New York, combined the fact that most of Nicholson's troops had been sent to Maine, meant that he was unable to take any effective action.<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a> Nicholson himself was <a href="Leisler&#39;s_Rebellion" title="wikilink">overthrown</a> by the faction led by <a href="Jacob_Leisler" title="wikilink">Jacob Leisler</a>, and he fled to England.<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a> Leisler governed New York until 1691, when first a detachment of troops,<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a> then <a href="Henry_Sloughter" title="wikilink">Henry Sloughter</a>, upon whom William and Mary had bestowed a commission as colonial governor, arrived.<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a> Sloughter had Leisler tried on charges of high treason; he was convicted and executed.<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a></p>
<p>After the suppression of Leisler's Rebellion and the reinstatement of colonial governments in New England, no further effort was made by English officials to restore the &quot;shattered&quot;<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a> dominion.</p>
