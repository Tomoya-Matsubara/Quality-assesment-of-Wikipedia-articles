<p><strong>Joseph-Maurice Ravel</strong> (7 March 1875 &lt;U+2013&gt; 28 December 1937) was a French composer, pianist and conductor. He is often associated with <a href="impressionism_in_music" title="wikilink">impressionism</a> along with his elder contemporary <a href="Claude_Debussy" title="wikilink">Claude Debussy</a>, although both composers rejected the term. In the 1920s and 30s Ravel was internationally regarded as France's greatest living composer.</p>
<p>Born to a music-loving family, Ravel attended France's premier music college, the <a href="Paris_Conservatoire" title="wikilink">Paris Conservatoire</a>; he was not well regarded by its conservative establishment, whose biased treatment of him caused a scandal. After leaving the conservatoire Ravel found his own way as a composer, developing a style of great clarity, incorporating elements of <a href="baroque_music" title="wikilink">baroque</a>, <a href="Neoclassicism_(music)" title="wikilink">neoclassicism</a> and, in his later works, jazz. He liked to experiment with musical form, as in his best-known work, <em><a href="Bol&lt;U+00E9&gt;ro" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bol&lt;U+00E9&gt;ro</a></em> (1928), in which repetition takes the place of development. He made some orchestral arrangements of other composers' music, of which his 1922 version of <a href="Modest_Mussorgsky" title="wikilink">Mussorgsky</a>'s <em><a href="Pictures_at_an_Exhibition" title="wikilink">Pictures at an Exhibition</a></em> is the best known.</p>
<p>As a slow and painstaking worker, Ravel composed fewer pieces than many of his contemporaries. Among his works to enter the repertoire are pieces for piano, chamber music, two piano concertos, ballet music, two operas, and eight song cycles; he wrote no symphonies or religious works. Many of his works exist in two versions: a first, piano score and a later orchestration. Some of his piano music, such as <em><a href="Gaspard_de_la_nuit" title="wikilink">Gaspard de la nuit</a></em> (1908), is exceptionally difficult to play, and his complex orchestral works such as <em><a href="Daphnis_et_Chlo&lt;U+00E9&gt;" title="wikilink">Daphnis et Chlo&lt;U+00E9&gt;</a></em> (1912) require skilful balance in performance.</p>
<p>Ravel was among the first composers to recognise the potential of recording to bring their music to a wider public. From the 1920s, despite limited technique as a pianist or conductor, he took part in recordings of several of his works; others were made under his supervision.</p>

His father, <a href="Pierre-Joseph_Ravel" title="wikilink">Pierre-Joseph Ravel</a>, was an educated and successful engineer, inventor and manufacturer, born in <a href="Versoix" class="uri" title="wikilink">Versoix</a> near the Franco-Swiss border.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>{{#tag:ref|Joseph's family is described in some sources as French and in others as Swiss; Versoix is in present-day (2015) Switzerland, but as the historian Philippe Morant observes, the nationality of families from the area changed several times over the generations as borders were moved; Joseph held a French passport,<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> but Ravel preferred to say simply that his paternal ancestors came from the <a href="Jura_Mountains" title="wikilink">Jura</a>.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a>|group= n}} His mother, Marie, <em>n&lt;U+00E9&gt;e</em> Delouart, was <a href="Basque_people" title="wikilink">Basque</a> but had grown up in Madrid. In 19th-century terms, Joseph had married beneath his status &lt;U+2013&gt; Marie was illegitimate and barely literate &lt;U+2013&gt; but the marriage was a happy one.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> Some of Joseph's inventions were successful, including an early <a href="internal_combustion_engine" title="wikilink">internal combustion engine</a> and a notorious circus machine, the &quot;Whirlwind of Death&quot;, an automotive loop-the-loop that was a big draw until a fatal accident at <a href="Ringling_Bros._and_Barnum_&amp;_Bailey_Circus" title="wikilink">Barnum and Bailey's Circus</a> in 1903.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>Both Ravel's parents were <a href="Catholic_Church" title="wikilink">Roman Catholics</a>; Marie was also something of a <a href="Freethought" title="wikilink">free-thinker</a>, a trait inherited by her elder son, who was always politically and socially progressive in outlook in adult life.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> He was baptised in the Ciboure parish church six days after he was born. The family moved to Paris three months later, and there a younger son, &lt;U+00C9&gt;douard, was born. He was close to his father, whom he eventually followed into the engineering profession.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> Maurice was particularly devoted to their mother; her Basque-Spanish heritage was a strong influence on his life and music.

<p>Ravel senior delighted in taking his sons to factories to see the latest mechanical devices, but he also had a keen interest in music and culture in general.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> In later life, Ravel recalled, &quot;Throughout my childhood I was sensitive to music.

<p>When he was seven Ravel started piano lessons with Henry Ghys, a friend of <a href="Emmanuel_Chabrier" title="wikilink">Emmanuel Chabrier</a>; five years later, in 1887, he began studying <a href="harmony" class="uri" title="wikilink">harmony</a>, <a href="counterpoint" class="uri" title="wikilink">counterpoint</a> and composition with Charles-Ren&lt;U+00E9&gt;, a pupil of <a href="L&lt;U+00E9&gt;o_Delibes" title="wikilink">L&lt;U+00E9&gt;o Delibes</a>.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> Without being anything of a child prodigy, he was a highly musical boy.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> Charles-Ren&lt;U+00E9&gt; found that Ravel's conception of music was natural to him &quot;and not, as in the case of so many others, the result of effort&quot;.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> Ravel's earliest known compositions date from this period: variations on a chorale by <a href="Robert_Schumann" title="wikilink">Schumann</a>, variations on a theme by <a href="Edvard_Grieg" title="wikilink">Grieg</a> and a single movement of a piano sonata.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> They survive only in fragmentary form.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1888 Ravel met the young pianist <a href="Ricardo_Vi&lt;U+00F1&gt;es" title="wikilink">Ricardo Vi&lt;U+00F1&gt;es</a>, who became not only a lifelong friend, but also one of the foremost interpreters of his works, and an important link between Ravel and Spanish music.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> The two shared an appreciation of <a href="Richard_Wagner" title="wikilink">Wagner</a>, Russian music, and the writings of <a href="Edgar_Allan_Poe" title="wikilink">Poe</a>, <a href="Charles_Baudelaire" title="wikilink">Baudelaire</a>, and <a href="St&lt;U+00E9&gt;phane_Mallarm&lt;U+00E9&gt;" title="wikilink">Mallarm&lt;U+00E9&gt;</a>.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> At the <a href="Exposition_Universelle_(1889)" title="wikilink">Exposition Universelle</a> in Paris in 1889, Ravel was much struck by the <a href="Russian_Symphony_Concerts" title="wikilink">new Russian works</a> conducted by <a href="Nikolai_Rimsky-Korsakov" title="wikilink">Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov</a>.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> This music had a lasting effect on both Ravel and his older contemporary <a href="Claude_Debussy" title="wikilink">Claude Debussy</a>, as did the exotic sound of the Javanese <a href="gamelan" class="uri" title="wikilink">gamelan</a>, also heard during the Exposition.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a></p>

<h3 id="paris-conservatoire">Paris Conservatoire</h3>
<p>With the encouragement of his parents, Ravel applied for entry to France's most important musical college, the <a href="Conservatoire_de_Paris" title="wikilink">Conservatoire de Paris</a>. In November 1889, playing music by <a href="Fr&lt;U+00E9&gt;d&lt;U+00E9&gt;ric_Chopin" title="wikilink">Chopin</a>, he passed the examination for admission to the preparatory piano class run by Eug&lt;U+00E8&gt;ne Anthi&lt;U+00F2&gt;me.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> Ravel won the first prize in the Conservatoire's piano competition in 1891, but otherwise he did not stand out as a student.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> Nevertheless, these years were a time of considerable advance in his development as a composer.

<p>Ravel placed high importance on melody, telling Vaughan Williams that there is &quot;an implied melodic outline in all vital music&quot;.<a href="#fn212" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref212"><sup>212</sup></a> His themes are frequently <a href="musical_mode" title="wikilink">modal</a> instead of using the familiar major or minor scales.<a href="#fn213" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref213"><sup>213</sup></a> As a result, there are few <a href="leading-tone" title="wikilink">leading notes</a> in his output.<a href="#fn214" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref214"><sup>214</sup></a> Chords of the <a href="extended_chord" title="wikilink">ninth and eleventh</a> and unresolved <a href="appoggiatura" title="wikilink">appoggiaturas</a>, such as those in the <em><a href="Valses_nobles_et_sentimentales" title="wikilink">Valses nobles et sentimentales</a></em>, are characteristic of Ravel's harmonic language.<a href="#fn215" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref215"><sup>215</sup></a></p>
<p>Dance forms appealed to Ravel, most famously the <a href="bolero" class="uri" title="wikilink">bolero</a> and pavane, but also the <a href="minuet" class="uri" title="wikilink">minuet</a>, <a href="forlane" class="uri" title="wikilink">forlane</a>, <a href="rigaudon" class="uri" title="wikilink">rigaudon</a>, <a href="Waltz_(music)" title="wikilink">waltz</a>, <a href="czardas" class="uri" title="wikilink">czardas</a>, <a href="Habanera_(music)" title="wikilink">habanera</a> and <a href="passacaglia" class="uri" title="wikilink">passacaglia</a>.

<h3 id="operas">Operas</h3>
<p>Ravel completed two operas, and worked on three others. The unrealised three were <em>Olympia</em>, <em>La cloche engloutie</em> and <em>Jeanne d'Arc</em>. <em>Olympia</em> was to be based on <a href="E._T._A._Hoffmann" title="wikilink">Hoffmann</a>'s <em>The Sandman</em>; he made sketches for it in 1898&lt;U+2013&gt;99, but did not progress far. <em>La cloche engloutie</em> after <a href="Gerhart_Hauptmann" title="wikilink">Hauptmann</a>'s <em><a href="The_Sunken_Bell" title="wikilink">The Sunken Bell</a></em> occupied him intermittently from 1906 to 1912, Ravel destroyed the sketches for both these works, except for a <em>&quot;Symphonie horlog&lt;U+00E8&gt;re&quot;</em> which he incorporated into the opening of <em>L'heure espagnole</em>.<a href="#fn220" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref220"><sup>220</sup></a> The third unrealised project was an operatic version of Joseph Delteil's 1925 novel about <a href="Joan_of_Arc" title="wikilink">Joan of Arc</a>. It was to be a large-scale, full-length work for the Paris Op&lt;U+00E9&gt;ra, but Ravel's final illness prevented him from writing it.<a href="#fn221" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref221"><sup>221</sup></a></p>
<p><img src="L&#39;heure-espagnole-1911.jpg" title="fig:Sketches of the cast for the 1911 premiere of L&#39;heure espagnole" alt="Sketches of the cast for the 1911 premiere of L&#39;heure espagnole" /> Ravel's first completed opera was <em>L'heure espagnole</em> (premiered in 1911), described as a &quot;com&lt;U+00E9&gt;die musicale&quot;.<a href="#fn222" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref222"><sup>222</sup></a> It is among the works set in or illustrating Spain that Ravel wrote throughout his career. Nichols comments that the essential Spanish colouring gave Ravel a reason for virtuoso use of the modern orchestra, which the composer considered &quot;perfectly designed for underlining and exaggerating comic effects&quot;.<a href="#fn223" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref223"><sup>223</sup></a> <a href="Edward_Burlingame_Hill" title="wikilink">Edward Burlingame Hill</a> found Ravel's vocal writing particularly skilful in the work, &quot;giving the singers something besides recitative without hampering the action&quot;, and &quot;commenting orchestrally upon the dramatic situations and the sentiments of the actors without diverting attention from the stage.&quot;<a href="#fn224" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref224"><sup>224</sup></a> Some find the characters artificial and the piece lacking in humanity.<a href="#fn225" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref225"><sup>225</sup></a> The critic David Murray writes that the score &quot;glows with the famous Ravel <em>tendresse</em>&quot;.<a href="#fn226" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref226"><sup>226</sup></a></p>
<p>The second opera, also in one act, is <em>L'enfant et les sortil&lt;U+00E8&gt;ges</em> (1926), a &quot;fantaisie lyrique&quot; to a libretto by Colette. She and Ravel had planned the story as a ballet, but at the composer's suggestion Colette turned it into an opera libretto. It is more uncompromisingly modern in its musical style than <em>L'heure espagnole</em>, and the jazz elements and <a href="bitonality" class="uri" title="wikilink">bitonality</a> of much of the work upset many Parisian opera-goers. Ravel was once again accused of artificiality and lack of human emotion, but Nichols finds &quot;profoundly serious feeling at the heart of this vivid and entertaining work&quot;.<a href="#fn227" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref227"><sup>227</sup></a> The score presents an impression of simplicity, disguising intricate links between themes, with, in Murray's phrase, &quot;extraordinary and bewitching sounds from the orchestra pit throughout&quot;.<a href="#fn228" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref228"><sup>228</sup></a></p>
<p>Although one-act operas are generally staged less often than full-length ones,<a href="#fn229" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref229"><sup>229</sup></a> Ravel's are produced regularly in France and abroad. For 2013&lt;U+2013&gt;15 <a href="Operabase" class="uri" title="wikilink">Operabase</a> records eight productions around the world of <em>L'heure espagnole</em> and twenty-four of <em>L'enfant et les sortil&lt;U+00E8&gt;ges</em>.<a href="#fn230" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref230"><sup>230</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="other-vocal-works">Other vocal works</h3>
<p>A substantial proportion of Ravel's output was vocal. His early works in that sphere include cantatas written for his unsuccessful attempts at the Prix de Rome. His other vocal music from that period shows Debussy's influence, in what Kelly describes as &quot;a static, recitative-like vocal style&quot;, prominent piano parts and rhythmic flexibility.<a href="#fn231" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref231"><sup>231</sup></a> By 1906 Ravel was taking even further than Debussy the natural, sometimes colloquial, setting of the French language in <em>Histoires naturelles</em>. The same technique is highlighted in <em>Trois po&lt;U+00E8&gt;mes de St&lt;U+00E9&gt;phane Mallarm&lt;U+00E9&gt;</em> (1913); Debussy set two of the three poems at the same time as Ravel, and the former's word-setting is noticeably more formal than the latter's, in which syllables are often elided. In the cycles <em>Sh&lt;U+00E9&gt;h&lt;U+00E9&gt;razade</em> and <em>Chansons mad&lt;U+00E9&gt;casses</em> Ravel gives vent to his taste for the exotic, even the sensual, in both the vocal line and the accompaniment.<a href="#fn232" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref232"><sup>232</sup></a><a href="#fn233" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref233"><sup>233</sup></a></p>
<p>Ravel's songs often draw on vernacular styles, using elements of many folk traditions in such works as <em>Cinq m&lt;U+00E9&gt;lodies populaires grecques</em>, <em>Deux m&lt;U+00E9&gt;lodies h&lt;U+00E9&gt;bra&lt;U+00EF&gt;ques</em> and <em>Chants populaires</em>.<a href="#fn234" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref234"><sup>234</sup></a> Among the poets on whose lyrics he drew were Marot, <a href="L&lt;U+00E9&gt;on-Paul_Fargue" title="wikilink">L&lt;U+00E9&gt;on-Paul Fargue</a>, <a href="Leconte_de_Lisle" title="wikilink">Leconte de Lisle</a> and Verlaine. For three songs dating from 1914&lt;U+2013&gt;15 he wrote his own texts.<a href="#fn235" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref235"><sup>235</sup></a></p>
<p>Although Ravel wrote for mixed choirs and male solo voices, he is chiefly associated, in his songs, with the soprano and mezzo-soprano voices. Even when setting lyrics clearly narrated by a man, he often favoured a female voice,<a href="#fn236" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref236"><sup>236</sup></a> and he seems to have preferred his best-known cycle, <em>Sh&lt;U+00E9&gt;h&lt;U+00E9&gt;razade</em>, to be sung by a woman, although a tenor voice is a permitted alternative in the score.<a href="#fn237" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref237"><sup>237</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="orchestral-works">Orchestral works</h3>
<p>During his lifetime it was above all as a master of orchestration that Ravel was famous.<a href="#fn238" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref238"><sup>238</sup></a> He minutely studied the ability of each orchestral instrument to determine its potential, putting its individual colour and timbre to maximum use.<a href="#fn239" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref239"><sup>239</sup></a> The critic <a href="Alexis_Roland-Manuel" title="wikilink">Alexis Roland-Manuel</a> wrote, &quot;In reality he is, with Stravinsky, the one man in the world who best knows the weight of a trombone-note, the harmonics of a 'cello or a <em>pp</em> <a href="tam-tam" class="uri" title="wikilink">tam-tam</a> in the relationships of one orchestral group to another.&quot;<a href="#fn240" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref240"><sup>240</sup></a></p>

All the other orchestral works were written either for the stage, as in <em>Daphnis et Chlo&lt;U+00E9&gt;</em>, or as a reworking of piano pieces, <em>Alborada del gracioso</em> and <em>Une barque sur l'ocean</em>, (<em>Miroirs</em>), <em>Valses nobles et sentimentales,</em> '' Ma m&lt;U+00E8&gt;re l'Oye'', <em>Tzigane</em> (originally for violin and piano) and <em>Le tombeau de Couperin.</em><a href="#fn241" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref241"><sup>241</sup></a> In the orchestral versions, the instrumentation generally clarifies the harmonic language of the score and brings sharpness to classical dance rhythms.<a href="#fn242" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref242"><sup>242</sup></a> Occasionally, as in the <em>Alborada del gracioso</em>, critics have found the later orchestral version less persuasive than the sharp-edged piano original.<a href="#fn243" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref243"><sup>243</sup></a></p>
<p>In some of his scores from the 1920s, including <em>Daphnis et Chlo&lt;U+00E9&gt;</em>, Ravel frequently divides his upper strings, having them play in six or even eight parts while the woodwind are required to play with extreme agility. His writing for the brass ranges from softly muted to triple-forte outbursts at climactic points.<a href="#fn244" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref244"><sup>244</sup></a> In the 1930s he tended to simplify his orchestral textures. The lighter tone of the G major Piano Concerto follows the models of <a href="Wolfgang_Amadeus_Mozart" title="wikilink">Mozart</a> and Saint-Sa&lt;U+00EB&gt;ns, alongside use of jazz-like themes.<a href="#fn245" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref245"><sup>245</sup></a> The critics <a href="Edward_Sackville-West" title="wikilink">Edward Sackville-West</a> and <a href="Desmond_Shawe-Taylor_(music_critic)" title="wikilink">Desmond Shawe-Taylor</a> comment that in the slow movement, &quot;one of the most beautiful tunes Ravel ever invented&quot;, the composer &quot;can truly be said to join hands with Mozart&quot;.<a href="#fn246" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref246"><sup>246</sup></a> The most popular of Ravel's orchestral works, <em>Bol&lt;U+00E9&gt;ro</em> (1928), was conceived several years before its completion; in 1924 he said that he was contemplating &quot;a symphonic poem without a subject, where the whole interest will be in the rhythm&quot;.<a href="#fn247" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref247"><sup>247</sup></a></p>
<p>Ravel made orchestral versions of piano works by Schumann, Chabrier, Debussy and Mussorgsky's piano suite <em>Pictures at an Exhibition</em>. Orchestral versions of the last by <a href="Mikhail_Tushmalov" title="wikilink">Mikhail Tushmalov</a>, <a href="Henry_Wood" title="wikilink">Sir Henry Wood</a> and <a href="Leo_Funtek" title="wikilink">Leo Funtek</a> predated Ravel's 1922 version, and many more have been made since, but Ravel's remains the best known.<a href="#fn248" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref248"><sup>248</sup></a> Kelly remarks on its &quot;dazzling array of instrumental colour&quot;,<a href="#fn249" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref249"><sup>249</sup></a> and a contemporary reviewer commented on how, in dealing with another composer's music, Ravel had produced an orchestral sound wholly unlike his own.<a href="#fn250" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref250"><sup>250</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="piano-music">Piano music</h3>

<p>Although Ravel wrote fewer than thirty works for the piano, they exemplify his range; Orenstein remarks that the composer keeps his personal touch &quot;from the striking simplicity of <em>Ma m&lt;U+00E8&gt;re l'Oye</em> to the transcendental virtuosity of <em>Gaspard de la nuit</em>.&quot;<a href="#fn251" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref251"><sup>251</sup></a> Ravel's earliest major work for piano, <em>Jeux d'eau</em> (1901), is frequently cited as evidence that he evolved his style independently of Debussy, whose major works for piano all came later.<a href="#fn252" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref252"><sup>252</sup></a> When writing for solo piano Ravel rarely aimed at the intimate chamber effect characteristic of Debussy, but sought a Lisztian virtuosity.<a href="#fn253" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref253"><sup>253</sup></a> The authors of <em>The Record Guide</em> consider that works such as <em>Gaspard de la Nuit</em> and <em>Miroirs</em> have a beauty and originality with a deeper inspiration &quot;in the harmonic and melodic genius of Ravel himself.&quot;<a href="#fn254" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref254"><sup>254</sup></a></p>
<p>Most of Ravel's piano music is extremely difficult to play, and presents pianists with a balance of technical and artistic challenges.<a href="#fn255" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref255"><sup>255</sup></a>{{#tag:ref|in 2009 the pianist <a href="Steven_Osborne_(pianist)" title="wikilink">Steven Osborne</a> wrote of <em>Gaspard</em>, &quot;This bloody opening!

Too much temperament, and the music loses its classical shape; too little, and it sounds pale.&quot;<a href="#fn257" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref257"><sup>257</sup></a> This balance caused a breach between the composer and Vi&lt;U+00F1&gt;es, who said that if he observed the nuances and speeds Ravel stipulated in <em>Gaspard de la nuit</em> &quot;Le gibet&quot; would &quot;bore the audience to death&quot;.<a href="#fn258" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref258"><sup>258</sup></a> Some pianists continue to attract criticism for over-interpreting Ravel's piano writing.<a href="#fn259" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref259"><sup>259</sup></a>{{#tag:ref|In a 2001 survey of recordings of <em>Gaspard de la nuit</em> the critic Andrew Clements wrote, &quot;<a href="Ivo_Pogorelich" title="wikilink">Ivo Pogorelich</a>&lt;U+2026&gt; deserves to be on that list too, but his his phrasing is so indulgent that in the end it cannot be taken seriously&lt;U+2026&gt; Ravel's writing is so minutely calculated and carefully defined that he leaves interpreters little room for manoeuvre; <a href="Vladimir_Ashkenazy" title="wikilink">Ashkenazy</a> takes a few liberties, so too does <a href="Martha_Argerich" title="wikilink">Argerich</a>.&quot;<a href="#fn260" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref260"><sup>260</sup></a> Ravel himself admonished Marguerite Long, &quot;You should not interpret my music: you should realise it&quot; (&quot;Il ne faut pas interpreter ma music, il faut le r&lt;U+00E9&gt;aliser.&quot;)<a href="#fn261" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref261"><sup>261</sup></a>|group= n}}</p>
<p>Ravel's regard for his predecessors is heard in several of his piano works; <em>Menuet sur le nom de Haydn</em> (1909), <em>&lt;U+00C0&gt; la mani&lt;U+00E8&gt;re de Borodine</em> (1912), <em>&lt;U+00C0&gt; la mani&lt;U+00E8&gt;re de Chabrier</em> (1913) and <em>Le tombeau de Couperin</em> all incorporate elements of the named composers interpreted in a characteristically Ravellian manner.<a href="#fn262" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref262"><sup>262</sup></a> Clark comments that those piano works which Ravel later orchestrated are overshadowed by the revised versions: &quot;Listen to <em>Le tombeau de Couperin</em> and the complete ballet music for <em>Ma m&lt;U+00E8&gt;re L'Oye</em> in the classic recordings conducted by <a href="Andr&lt;U+00E9&gt;_Cluytens" title="wikilink">Andr&lt;U+00E9&gt; Cluytens</a>, and the piano versions never sound quite the same again.&quot;<a href="#fn263" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref263"><sup>263</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="chamber-music">Chamber music</h3>
<p>Apart from a one-movement sonata for violin and piano dating from 1899, unpublished in the composer's lifetime, Ravel wrote seven chamber works.<a href="#fn264" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref264"><sup>264</sup></a> The earliest is the String Quartet (1902&lt;U+2013&gt;03), dedicated to Faur&lt;U+00E9&gt;, and showing the influence of Debussy's quartet of ten years earlier. Like the Debussy it differs from the more monumental quartets of the established French school of Franck and his followers, with more succinct melodies, fluently interchanged, in flexible tempos and varieties of instrumental colour.<a href="#fn265" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref265"><sup>265</sup></a> The Introduction and Allegro for harp, flute, clarinet, and string quartet (1905) was composed very quickly by Ravel's standards.

It contains Basque, Baroque and far Eastern influences, and shows Ravel's growing technical skill, dealing with the difficulties of balancing the percussive piano with the sustained sound of the violin and cello, &quot;blending the two disparate elements in a musical language that is unmistakably his own,&quot; in the words of the commentator Keith Anderson.<a href="#fn267" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref267"><sup>267</sup></a></p>
<p>Ravel's four chamber works composed after the First World War are the Sonata for Violin and Cello (1920&lt;U+2013&gt;22), the &quot;Berceuse sur le nom de Gabriel Faur&lt;U+00E9&gt;&quot; for violin and piano (1922), the chamber original of <em>Tzigane</em> for violin and piano (1924) and finally the Violin Sonata (1923&lt;U+2013&gt;27).<a href="#fn268" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref268"><sup>268</sup></a> The two middle works are respectively an affectionate tribute to Ravel's teacher,<a href="#fn269" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref269"><sup>269</sup></a> and a virtuoso display piece for the violinist <a href="Jelly_d&#39;Ar&lt;U+00E1&gt;nyi" title="wikilink">Jelly d'Ar&lt;U+00E1&gt;nyi</a>.<a href="#fn270" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref270"><sup>270</sup></a> The Violin and Cello Sonata is a departure from the rich textures and harmonies of the pre-war Piano Trio: the composer said that it marked a turning point in his career, with thinness of texture pushed to the extreme and harmonic charm renounced in favour of pure melody.<a href="#fn271" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref271"><sup>271</sup></a> His last chamber work, the Violin Sonata (sometimes called the Second after the posthumous publication of his student sonata), is a frequently dissonant work.

<p>Ravel's interpretations of some of his piano works were captured on <a href="piano_roll" title="wikilink">piano roll</a> between 1914 and 1928, although some rolls supposedly played by him may have been made under his supervision by <a href="Robert_Casadesus" title="wikilink">Robert Casadesus</a>, a better pianist.<a href="#fn275" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref275"><sup>275</sup></a> Transfers of the rolls have been released on compact disc.<a href="#fn276" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref276"><sup>276</sup></a> In 1913 there was a gramophone recording of <em>Jeux d'eau</em> played by <a href="Mark_Hambourg" title="wikilink">Mark Hambourg</a>, and by the early 1920s there were discs featuring the <em>Pavane pour une infante d&lt;U+00E9&gt;funte</em> and <em>Ondine</em>, and movements from the String Quartet, <em>Le tombeau de Couperin</em> and <em>Ma m&lt;U+00E8&gt;re l'Oye</em>.<a href="#fn277" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref277"><sup>277</sup></a> Ravel was among the first composers who recognised the potential of recording to bring their music to a wider public,{{#tag:ref|Other composers who made recordings of their music during the early years of the gramophone included <a href="Edward_Elgar" title="wikilink">Elgar</a>, <a href="Edvard_Grieg" title="wikilink">Grieg</a>, <a href="Sergei_Rachmaninoff" title="wikilink">Rachmaninoff</a> and <a href="Richard_Strauss" title="wikilink">Richard Strauss</a>.<a href="#fn278" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref278"><sup>278</sup></a>|group= n}} and throughout the 1920s there was a steady stream of recordings of his works, some of which featured the composer as pianist or conductor.<a href="#fn279" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref279"><sup>279</sup></a> A 1932 recording of the G major Piano Concerto was advertised as &quot;Conducted by the composer&quot;,<a href="#fn280" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref280"><sup>280</sup></a> although he had in fact supervised the sessions while a more proficient conductor took the baton.<a href="#fn281" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref281"><sup>281</sup></a> Recordings for which Ravel actually was the conductor included a <em>Bol&lt;U+00E9&gt;ro</em> in 1930, and a sound film of a 1933 performance of the D major concerto with Wittgenstein as soloist.<a href="#fn282" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref282"><sup>282</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="honours-and-legacy">Honours and legacy</h2>

<p>After Ravel's death his brother and legatee, Edouard, turned the composer's house at Montfort-l'Amaury into a museum, leaving it substantially as Ravel had known it.  the maison-mus&lt;U+00E9&gt;e de Maurice Ravel remains open for guided tours.<a href="#fn286" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref286"><sup>286</sup></a></p>
<p>In his later years Edouard Ravel declared his intention to leave the bulk of the composer's estate to the city of Paris for the endowment of a Nobel Prize in music, but evidently changed his mind.<a href="#fn287" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref287"><sup>287</sup></a> After his death in 1960 the estate passed through several hands.
