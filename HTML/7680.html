<p><strong>Chateau-sur-Mer</strong> is the first of the grand <a href="Bellevue_Avenue_Historic_District" title="wikilink">Bellevue Avenue</a> <a href="mansion" class="uri" title="wikilink">mansion</a> of the <a href="Gilded_Age" title="wikilink">Gilded Age</a> <a href="mansions" class="uri" title="wikilink">mansions</a> in <a href="Newport,_Rhode_Island" title="wikilink">Newport, Rhode Island</a>. It is now open to the public as a <a href="museum" class="uri" title="wikilink">museum</a>. Chateau-sur-Mer's grand scale and lavish parties ushered in the Gilded Age of Newport, as it was the most palatial residence in Newport until the <a href="Vanderbilt_family" title="wikilink">Vanderbilt</a> houses in the 1890s.</p>
<p>Chateau-sur-Mer was completed in 1852 as a French villa for <a href="William_Shepard_Wetmore" title="wikilink">William Shepard Wetmore</a>, a merchant in the <a href="China_trade" title="wikilink">China trade</a>, who was born on January 26, 1801, in <a href="St._Albans" title="wikilink">St. Albans</a> , <a href="Vermont" class="uri" title="wikilink">Vermont</a>. The builder was <a href="Seth_Bradford" title="wikilink">Seth Bradford</a> and is a landmark of Victorian architecture, furniture, wallpapers, ceramics and stenciling. Mr. Wetmore died on June 16, 1862, at Chateau-sur-Mer, leaving the bulk of his fortune to his son, <a href="George_Peabody_Wetmore" title="wikilink">George Peabody Wetmore</a> (later Governor of <a href="Rhode_Island" title="wikilink">Rhode Island</a> and a United States Senator), who married Edith Keteltas in 1869. During the 1870s, the Wetmores departed on an extended trip to Europe, leaving architect <a href="Richard_Morris_Hunt" title="wikilink">Richard Morris Hunt</a> to remodel and redecorate the house in the <a href="Second_Empire" title="wikilink">Second Empire</a> style. As a result, Chateau-sur-Mer displays most of the major design trends of the last half of the 19th century.</p>
<p>Unlike most of the &quot;cottages&quot; built in Newport during this period, Chateau-sur-Mer was one of the few built as a year round residence. This was because the Wetmore's were a New England family who made Newport their home.</p>
<p>The house was added to the <a href="List_of_Registered_Historic_Places_in_Rhode_Island" title="wikilink">National Register of Historic Places</a> in 1968 and purchased by the <a href="Preservation_Society_of_Newport_County" title="wikilink">Preservation Society of Newport County</a> in 1969.</p>
<p>In March 2006, Kathleen Styger and Michelle Styger, as interns for the <a href="Preservation_Society_of_Newport_County" title="wikilink">Preservation Society of Newport County</a>, conducted extensive research for descriptions on the interior of the Chateau-sur-Mer estate as part of the <a href="National_Historic_Landmark" title="wikilink">National Historic Landmark</a> nomination submitted to the <a href="Department_of_Interior" title="wikilink">Department of Interior</a> resulting in recognition as a National Historic Landmark.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>It was declared a <a href="National_Historic_Landmark" title="wikilink">National Historic Landmark</a> in 2006.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a><a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>The former carriage house and stables for the Chateau-Sur-Mer estate are owned by <a href="Salve_Regina_University" title="wikilink">Salve Regina University</a> and are currently being renovated as a center for visual art and cultural and historic preservation known as Wetmore Hall.</p>
<p>Two HABS photos and one other older photo are available.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
