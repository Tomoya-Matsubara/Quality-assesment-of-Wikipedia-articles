<h2 id="plot-summary">Plot summary</h2>
<p><a href="Leslie_Knope" title="wikilink">Leslie</a> (<a href="Amy_Poehler" title="wikilink">Amy Poehler</a>) throws her annual &quot;Galentine's Day&quot; party for her female friends, celebrated the day before <a href="Valentine&#39;s_Day" title="wikilink">Valentine's Day</a>. She asks her mother, <a href="Characters_of_Parks_and_Recreation#Marlene_Knope" title="wikilink">Marlene</a> (<a href="Pamela_Reed" title="wikilink">Pamela Reed</a>), to tell the story about how she fell in love with a lifeguard that saved her from drowning in 1968, but the two had to break it off over objections from Marlene's parents. Leslie later tells the story to <a href="Characters_of_Parks_and_Recreation#Justin_Anderson" title="wikilink">Justin</a> (<a href="Justin_Theroux" title="wikilink">Justin Theroux</a>), who is amazed by the tale and wants to unite the two. He successfully tracks down Marlene's old flame, Frank Beckerson (<a href="John_Larroquette" title="wikilink">John Larroquette</a>), and convinces Leslie to go with him to <a href="Illinois" class="uri" title="wikilink">Illinois</a> and reunite the two on Valentine's Day at the Senior Center Valentine's Dance, which the parks department oversees.</p>
<p>Leslie and Justin meet Frank, a strange and depressed man that has constant panic attacks. Leslie begins to have doubts about bringing him to her mother and tries to call it off, but Justin insists that they should &quot;let it play out&quot;. At the dance, where <a href="Andy_Dwyer" title="wikilink">Andy</a>'s (<a href="Chris_Pratt" title="wikilink">Chris Pratt</a>) band Mouse Rat is playing, Frank meets up with Marlene, who is repulsed by Frank's past, current unemployment and overall failure at life. She turns down his offer at a second chance at love, prompting him to storm onto the stage and denounce her over the microphone. Leslie apologizes to her mother for bringing Frank. She is later upset with Justin, but has trouble pinpointing the reasons for her dissatisfaction. <a href="Ron_Swanson" title="wikilink">Ron</a> (<a href="Nick_Offerman" title="wikilink">Nick Offerman</a>) explains that Justin is a &quot;tourist,&quot; meaning that he takes &quot;vacations in people's lives&quot; and only cares about telling interesting stories to impress other people, which makes him selfish. Two older women then recognize Ron as jazz saxophonist <a href="Practice_Date" title="wikilink">Duke Silver</a>, but he denies it. Leslie later breaks up with Justin, which <a href="Tom_Haverford" title="wikilink">Tom</a> (<a href="Aziz_Ansari" title="wikilink">Aziz Ansari</a>) takes especially hard, reacting as if his parents were getting divorced.</p>
<p>Before the senior dance, Tom invites his ex-wife <a href="Characters_of_Parks_and_Recreation#Wendy_Haverford" title="wikilink">Wendy</a> (<a href="Jama_Williamson" title="wikilink">Jama Williamson</a>) to his office to finally disclose his romantic feelings for her, but she rejects him. Not satisfied with the outcome, he attempts to blackmail her into a date using an alimony lawsuit as leverage. Tom and Wendy are later shown hugging and presumably making amends, although their conversation remains inaudible. Meanwhile, <a href="April_Ludgate" title="wikilink">April</a>'s (<a href="Aubrey_Plaza" title="wikilink">Aubrey Plaza</a>) boyfriend Derek (Blake Lee) and his boyfriend Ben (Josh Ducendeck) mock the senior citizens, causing April to question why their interactions must constantly be &quot;cloaked in irony&quot;. They accuse her of &quot;lameness&quot;, which they attribute to spending time with Andy, and provide her with several ultimatums. She breaks up with them in response. <a href="Ann_Perkins" title="wikilink">Ann</a> (<a href="Rashida_Jones" title="wikilink">Rashida Jones</a>) and <a href="Mark_Brendanawicz" title="wikilink">Mark</a> (<a href="Paul_Schneider_(actor)" title="wikilink">Paul Schneider</a>), at the same time, celebrate their first Valentine's Day together. In an interview with the camera crew, Ann describes the relationship as &quot;good&quot;, but her tone of voice and body language around Mark contradict her statements. She later becomes jealous when Andy dedicates a song to April, even going so far as to question April about the possibility of a budding relationship between April and Andy, to which April responds impatiently.</p>

<h2 id="reception">Reception</h2>

<p>In its original American NBC broadcast on February 11, 2010, &quot;Galentine's Day&quot; was seen by 4.98 million households, according to <a href="Nielsen_ratings" title="wikilink">Nielsen Media Research</a>.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> This marked a continued recent improvement in ratings for the series. &quot;Galentine's Day&quot; was seen by more viewers than the previous week's episode &quot;<a href="Sweetums_(Parks_and_Recreation)" title="wikilink">Sweetums</a>&quot;, which drew 4.87 million viewers and was an itself an increase from previous episodes.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> &quot;Galentine's Day&quot; drew an overall 3.1 rating/5 share, and a 2.3 rating/6 share among viewers between 18 and 49,<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> the latter of which tied with &quot;Sweetums&quot; as the highest of its age group for the series.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> The subsequent episode, &quot;<a href="Woman_of_the_Year_(Parks_and_Recreation)" title="wikilink">Woman of the Year</a>&quot;, would also tie the two episodes for a series-high rating in that 18 to 49 age group.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a></p>
<p>&quot;Galentine's Day&quot; received generally positive reviews. <em><a href="Entertainment_Weekly" title="wikilink">Entertainment Weekly</a></em> writer Sandra Gonzalez said, &quot;The show managed to cram more character development into 22 minutes than I thought possible. Almost every couple had a major milestone of sorts last night.&quot; Gonzalez complimented the acting of Aziz Ansari during his moments with Wendy, and praised the &quot;touching moment&quot; between Ron and Leslie when she realized she had to break up with Justin.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> Steve Kandell of <em><a href="New_York_(magazine)" title="wikilink">New York</a></em> magazine appreciated that Leslie was correct about Frank, and that Justin was the ignorant one. Kandell said the senior dance served as a &quot;poignant backdrop&quot; for the episode's romantic subplots, but said the most intriguing show's relationship is between Leslie and Ron.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> Alan Sepinwall, television columnist with <em><a href="The_Star-Ledger" title="wikilink">The Star-Ledger</a></em>, said the episode was funny, but focused more attention on advancing various romantic subplots. Sepinwall said the scenes about Ann and Mark were &quot;a nice reaction to the general blandness of that relationship&quot;, but found it &quot;frustrating&quot; that the episode left the reason for Wendy and Tom's resolution unclear in &quot;Galentine's Day&quot;.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a></p>
<p>Steve Heisler of <em><a href="The_A.V._Club" title="wikilink">The A.V. Club</a></em> praised the episode for displaying some of Leslie's stronger and more competent aspects, which he said makes audiences &quot;much more willing to put up with her many, many eccentricities&quot;. Heisler said he thought the Leslie and Justin relationship ended appropriately and praised Ansari's performance, but added he was a little &quot;taken aback&quot; by how rudely Tom treated Wendy.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> Matt Fowler of <em><a href="IGN" class="uri" title="wikilink">IGN</a></em> said the episode had many funny moments and good character development, but he said some of the romantic relationships risked skewing the balance between &quot;the sweet and the absurd&quot;, and that some of the character moments &quot;played out a bit too jarringly real for a show like this&quot;.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> Kona Gallagher of <em><a href="Weblogs,_Inc.#TV_Squad" title="wikilink">TV Squad</a></em> said she would like to see Leslie get a boyfriend who last longer than three episodes, unlike Justin Theroux and <a href="Louis_C.K." title="wikilink">Louis C.K.</a>, who played Leslie's love interest <a href="Characters_of_Parks_and_Recreation#Dave_Sanderson" title="wikilink">Dave Sanderson</a> earlier in the season. Gallagher praised Andy's band and the befuddlement with which Andy reacted to the senior citizen audience.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> Mike Murphy of <em><a href="The_Press_Democrat" title="wikilink">The Press Democrat</a></em> said the episode was funny, and he particularly praised the &quot;hilariously whacked-out&quot; performance of John Laroquette.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> Several commentators praised the joke about Andy's new rock song &quot;Sex Hair&quot;, about how one can tell whether someone had sex because their hair is matted.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a><a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a><a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a></p>
