<p><strong>New York State Route 22</strong> (NY 22) is <a href="New_York" title="wikilink">New York</a> <a href="state_highway" title="wikilink">state highway</a> running north–south parallel to the state's eastern edge from the outskirts of <a href="New_York_City" title="wikilink">New York City</a> to a short distance south of the <a href="United_States-Canada_border" title="wikilink">Canadian border</a>. At over , it is the state's longest north–south route and the third longest overall, after <a href="New_York_State_Route_5" title="wikilink">NY 5</a> and <a href="New_York_State_Route_17" title="wikilink">NY 17</a>. Many of the state's major east–west roads intersect with Route 22 just before crossing the state line into the neighboring <a href="New_England" title="wikilink">New England</a> states.</p>
<p>Almost all of Route 22 is a two-lane rural road that only passes through small villages and hamlets. The exceptions are its southern end in the heavily populated <a href="Bronx" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bronx</a> and lower <a href="Westchester_County,_New_York" title="wikilink">Westchester County</a>, and a section of that runs through the city of <a href="Plattsburgh_(city),_New_York" title="wikilink">Plattsburgh</a> near the northern end. The rural landscape that the road passes through varies from horse country and views of the large reservoirs of the <a href="New_York_City_water_supply_system" title="wikilink">New York City watershed</a> in the northern suburbs of city, to <a href="dairy_farm" title="wikilink">dairy farms</a> further upstate in the hilly <a href="Taconic_Mountains" title="wikilink">Taconics</a> and <a href="Berkshire_Mountains" title="wikilink">Berkshires</a>, to the undeveloped, heavily forested <a href="Adirondack_Park" title="wikilink">Adirondack Park</a> along the shores of <a href="Lake_Champlain" title="wikilink">Lake Champlain</a>. An  section from <a href="Fort_Ann_(village),_New_York" title="wikilink">Fort Ann</a> to <a href="Keeseville,_New_York" title="wikilink">Keeseville</a> is part of the <a href="All-American_Road" title="wikilink">All-American Road</a> known as the <a href="Lakes_to_Locks_Passage" title="wikilink">Lakes to Locks Passage</a>.</p>
<p>The southernmost section of the road was known as the <strong>White Plains Post Road</strong> in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, a major highway connecting New York City to <a href="White_Plains,_New_York" title="wikilink">White Plains</a>, the Westchester <a href="county_seat" title="wikilink">county seat</a>. Route 22 in its modern form was established in 1930 as one of the principal routes from New York City to Canada.</p>
<h2 id="route-description">Route description</h2>
<p>Route 22 starts as an urban arterial road, passing through the most populous communities along its route within its first . It changes direction slightly from north to northeast at a <a href="traffic_circle" title="wikilink">traffic circle</a> near <a href="Kensico_Reservoir" title="wikilink">Kensico Dam</a> and becomes a mostly two-lane rural route all the way to the Canadian border.</p>

<p><img src="NY_22_first_reassurance_shield.jpg" title="fig:First reassurance shield of NY 22" alt="First reassurance shield of NY 22" /> Route 22 starts as Provost Avenue at an intersection with <a href="U.S._Route_1_in_New_York" title="wikilink">US 1</a> in the <a href="Bronx" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bronx</a>, intersecting with <a href="East_233rd_Street_(Bronx)" title="wikilink">East 233rd Street</a> about  later.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> It soon crosses the <a href="Westchester_County,_New_York" title="wikilink">Westchester</a> county line into <a href="Mount_Vernon,_New_York" title="wikilink">Mount Vernon</a> and becomes South Third Avenue, beginning a  section in that county.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> Shortly after the county line, Route 22 makes a sharp turn to the right at the South Columbus Avenue intersection. It parallels the nearby <a href="Hutchinson_River_Parkway" title="wikilink">Hutchinson River Parkway</a> as it heads into the New York City suburbs of <a href="Bronxville,_New_York" title="wikilink">Bronxville</a> and <a href="Tuckahoe,_Westchester_County,_New_York" title="wikilink">Tuckahoe</a>. At <a href="Wilson_Woods_Lake" title="wikilink">Wilson Woods Lake</a>, it crosses a pair of railroad tracks and becomes North Columbus Avenue, then has its first interchange with a <a href="limited-access_road" title="wikilink">limited-access road</a> at the <a href="Cross_County_Parkway" title="wikilink">Cross County Parkway</a>. NY 22 is mostly locally maintained within the city of Mount Vernon.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>Two <a href="country_club" title="wikilink">country clubs</a> on either side herald NY 22's entry into the wealthy suburb of <a href="Scarsdale,_New_York" title="wikilink">Scarsdale</a>.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> It makes a turn to the northeast, passing the Vernon Hills Shopping Center to the right. After leaving Scarsdale, NY 22 continues north into the hamlet of <a href="Hartsdale,_New_York" title="wikilink">Hartsdale</a>.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>The route parallels the <a href="Bronx_River_Parkway" title="wikilink">Bronx River Parkway</a> (BRP) as it enters Westchester's county seat, <a href="White_Plains,_New_York" title="wikilink">White Plains</a>.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> Within the city of White Plains, NY 22 is maintained by Westchester County, with unsigned designations of County Road 53 (Scarsdale line to NY 125), County Road 108 (NY 125 to Westchester Avenue), and County Road 87 (Broadway to North Castle line).<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> NY 22 also intersects <a href="New_York_State_Route_125" title="wikilink">NY 125</a> and <a href="New_York_State_Route_119" title="wikilink">NY 119</a> in downtown White Plains, then bends to the northwest along North Broadway, eventually intersecting the <a href="Cross-Westchester_Expressway" title="wikilink">Cross-Westchester Expressway</a> (<a href="Interstate_287" title="wikilink">I-287</a>). <a href="White_Plains_Rural_Cemetery" title="wikilink">White Plains Rural Cemetery</a> is visible to the west as NY 22 continues northward out of the city.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p>In North White Plains, the area that the road passes through becomes a little less developed as it goes over a gentle rise to the <a href="traffic_circle" title="wikilink">traffic circle</a> where the BRP ends and the <a href="Taconic_State_Parkway" title="wikilink">Taconic State Parkway</a> begins, just south of <a href="Kensico_Dam" title="wikilink">Kensico Dam</a>.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="kensico-reservoir-to-brewster">Kensico Reservoir to Brewster</h3>
<p>While the Taconic State Parkway continues along the northwest heading Route 22 had been following, Route 22 itself veers to the northeast along the reservoir's south shore towards a short <a href="concurrency_(road)" title="wikilink">concurrency</a> with <a href="New_York_State_Route_120" title="wikilink">NY 120</a>,<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> just north of <a href="IBM" class="uri" title="wikilink">IBM</a>'s <a href="Armonk,_New_York" title="wikilink">Armonk</a> headquarters and the &quot;Duke's Trees angle&quot;, the westernmost point in <a href="Connecticut" class="uri" title="wikilink">Connecticut</a>.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> For the first time, NY 22 runs parallel to New York's eastern border, intersecting <a href="I-684" class="uri" title="wikilink">I-684</a> for the first of several times just north of the short portion of that highway in Connecticut. A short distance later, <a href="New_York_State_Route_433" title="wikilink">NY 433</a>, one of the state's shortest highways, heads south from NY 22 into <a href="Greenwich,_Connecticut" title="wikilink">Greenwich</a>.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<p>After that junction, NY 22 bends back to the north, paralleling I-684 as a narrow, shaded meandering two-lane rural route through the Westchester countryside of large wooded lots and houses well-screened from the road. In downtown <a href="Bedford_(CDP),_New_York" title="wikilink">Bedford</a>, the first settlement since White Plains, the highway overlaps with <a href="New_York_State_Route_172" title="wikilink">NY 172</a> for a few blocks, then intersects <a href="New_York_State_Route_121" title="wikilink">NY 121</a> at its southern terminus. Route 22 itself follows a due-north heading from the hamlet, passing the Caramoor Center, the <a href="John_Jay_Homestead_State_Historic_Site" title="wikilink">John Jay Homestead State Historic Site</a> (the first <a href="National_Historic_Landmark" title="wikilink">National Historic Landmark</a> along the highway), and <a href="Harvey_School" title="wikilink">Harvey School</a>, before it briefly widens at a major intersection with <a href="New_York_State_Route_35" title="wikilink">NY 35</a> near <a href="Katonah,_New_York" title="wikilink">Katonah</a>.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> Two miles north of that junction, NY 22 becomes parallel to I-684 into the <a href="Somers,_New_York" title="wikilink">Town of Somers</a> and the hamlet of <a href="Goldens_Bridge,_New_York" title="wikilink">Goldens Bridge</a>.

Turning left onto Hardscrabble Road, it follows the tracks away from the interstate to the site of <a href="Croton_Falls_(Metro-North_station)" title="wikilink">the next station</a>, <a href="North_Salem,_New_York" title="wikilink">North Salem</a>'s hamlet of <a href="Croton_Falls,_New_York" title="wikilink">Croton Falls</a>. Just north of the hamlet, Route 22 crosses under the tracks, and is joined by <a href="U.S._Route_202_in_New_York" title="wikilink">US 202</a>. Immediately afterward, the road crosses back under the railroad again and enters <a href="Putnam_County,_New_York" title="wikilink">Putnam County</a>, following the <a href="Croton_River" title="wikilink">Croton River</a> north past the <a href="spillway" class="uri" title="wikilink">spillway</a> of <a href="East_Branch_Reservoir" title="wikilink">East Branch Reservoir</a>.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
<p>After paralleling the reservoir for almost two miles, a third route, <a href="U.S._Route_6_in_New_York" title="wikilink">US 6</a>, joins the concurrency just east of the village of <a href="Brewster,_New_York" title="wikilink">Brewster</a>. The three routes cross under a high, long bridge carrying <a href="Interstate_84_(east)" title="wikilink">I-84</a>, then veer east to an interchange with the north end of I-684. US 6 and 202 continue east for <a href="Danbury,_Connecticut" title="wikilink">Danbury</a> while NY 22 uses the northbound on-ramp of the I-684 roadway.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> The short expressway connector that carries northbound I-684 traffic to northbound NY 22 is NY Reference Route 981B.</p>

<p><img src="NY_22_with_Harlem_Valley_view.jpg" title="fig:NY 22 looking north into the Harlem Valley from Patterson" alt="NY 22 looking north into the Harlem Valley from Patterson" /> Route 22 continues heading northeast along a narrow strip of land between the East Branch and <a href="Bog_Brook_Reservoir" title="wikilink">Bog Brook</a> reservoirs. It then resumes its northward heading, following a much straighter course than it had up to this point, on two lanes through wooded areas of the town of <a href="Patterson,_New_York" title="wikilink">Patterson</a>, where two local state highways, <a href="New_York_State_Route_312" title="wikilink">NY 312</a> and <a href="New_York_State_Route_164" title="wikilink">164</a>, come in from the west. The highway gradually expands to three and sometimes four lanes as it passes through built-up areas of strip development. Shortly after intersecting a third state highway, <a href="New_York_State_Route_311" title="wikilink">NY 311</a>, and passing another strip plaza, NY 22 crosses into <a href="Dutchess_County,_New_York" title="wikilink">Dutchess County</a>.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
<p>After another supermarket strip to the east, a long, gentle <a href="divided_highway" title="wikilink">divided</a> bend in the road almost a mile long ends with an overpass where <a href="New_York_State_Route_55" title="wikilink">NY 55</a> comes in from the west. It joins NY 22 as the two routes, returning to two lanes, pass through the eastern fringe of the village of <a href="Pawling_(village),_New_York" title="wikilink">Pawling</a> and then by <a href="Trinity-Pawling_School" title="wikilink">Trinity-Pawling School</a>. Past the village, the railroad tracks edge closer to the highway as NY 22 enters the scenic Harlem Valley, which lends its name to the railroad line.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> The road curves more gently and takes longer straightaways, with lower density of residential and commercial development. Two miles from Pawling, the <a href="Appalachian_Trail" title="wikilink">Appalachian Trail</a> crosses the road next to [[Appalachian Trail (Metro-North station)|] <a href="flag_stop" title="wikilink">flag stop</a> on the line.</p>
<p>Routes 22 and 55 continue their long curve into the town of <a href="Dover,_New_York" title="wikilink">Dover</a>, past the <a href="Harlem_Valley-Wingdale_(Metro-North_station)" title="wikilink">Harlem Valley-Wingdale</a> station next to the road across from the now-closed buildings of <a href="Harlem_Valley_State_Hospital" title="wikilink">Harlem Valley Psychiatric Center</a>. The NY 55 concurrency ends when that road heads towards Connecticut at <a href="Wingdale,_New_York" title="wikilink">Wingdale</a>, once the last stop on the Harlem Line. As a result of a service extension in 2002, the diesel engines can be seen along the reopened track beyond here, through <a href="Dover_Plains_(Metro-North_station)" title="wikilink">Dover Plains</a> and into <a href="Amenia,_New_York" title="wikilink">Amenia</a>, where an overlap with <a href="New_York_State_Route_343" title="wikilink">NY 343</a> begins. The railroad line ends at <a href="Wassaic_(Metro-North_station)" title="wikilink">Wassaic</a>, the most distant Metro-North station from the city in <a href="as_the_crow_flies" title="wikilink">direct miles</a>. Route 343 remains joined with Route 22 into the hamlet of Amenia, where it separates and heads towards state line. At the same junction, <a href="U.S._Route_44" title="wikilink">US 44</a> comes in from <a href="Millbrook,_New_York" title="wikilink">Millbrook</a> to begin an overlap with Route 22.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> The valley opens up as the southern <a href="Taconic_Mountains" title="wikilink">Taconics</a> loom ahead. <img src="NY_22_and_NY_343.jpg" title="fig:NY 343 and NY 22 concurrency near Dover, New York" alt="NY 343 and NY 22 concurrency near Dover, New York" width="200" /> After intersecting with <a href="New_York_State_Route_199" title="wikilink">NY 199</a> at its eastern end, NY 22 and US 44 veer northeast into the small village of <a href="Millerton,_New_York" title="wikilink">Millerton</a> in the northern protrusion of Dutchess County's Oblong, an area once the subject of a boundary dispute between New York and Connecticut in the late 17th century. US 44 continues eastward towards Connecticut while NY 22 resumes its northward course into the shadow of the ridge ahead, where three states converge near the  <a href="Brace_Mountain" title="wikilink">Brace Mountain</a>, Dutchess County's highest, and Connecticut's highest point on <a href="Mount_Frissell" title="wikilink">Mount Frissell</a>'s southern slope. At another gentle curve, NY 22 slips into <a href="Columbia_County,_New_York" title="wikilink">Columbia County</a> and the town of <a href="Ancram,_New_York" title="wikilink">Ancram</a>.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> North of the county line, <a href="Massachusetts" class="uri" title="wikilink">Massachusetts</a> becomes the state behind <a href="Alander_Mountain" title="wikilink">Alander Mountain</a> and the other peaks visible to the east. The southernmost route from New York to the Massachusetts state line, <a href="New_York_State_Route_344" title="wikilink">NY 344</a>, leaves for <a href="Bash_Bish_Falls" title="wikilink">Bashbish Falls State Park</a> at the hamlet of <a href="Copake_Falls,_New_York" title="wikilink">Copake Falls</a>.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a></p>
<p>The next major junction is in <a href="Hillsdale,_New_York" title="wikilink">Hillsdale</a> where <a href="New_York_State_Route_23" title="wikilink">NY 23</a> crosses NY 22 on its way to <a href="Catamount_Ski_Center" title="wikilink">Catamount Ski Center</a>, which straddles the New York–Massachusetts state line. At the hamlet of Green River, <a href="New_York_State_Route_71" title="wikilink">NY 71</a>, the state's shortest two-digit route, begins at NY 22 heading east into Massachusetts. NY 22 then crosses into <a href="Austerlitz,_New_York" title="wikilink">Austerlitz</a>, where the surrounding terrain becomes much more wooded and the valleys become narrower. In the center of town, East Hill Road offers a short detour to <a href="Steepletop" class="uri" title="wikilink">Steepletop</a>, the farm where <a href="Edna_St._Vincent_Millay" title="wikilink">Edna St. Vincent Millay</a> lived. A short distance later, NY 22 intersects with <a href="New_York_State_Route_203" title="wikilink">NY 203</a> at its eastern end.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a></p>
<p>Route 22 then veers sharply to the northeast, resuming a northward direction only a short distance from the state line, a few hundred feet to the east. It then rounds a mountain and heads west, paralleling the <a href="New_York_State_Thruway" title="wikilink">New York State Thruway</a>'s Berkshire section (<a href="Interstate_90_in_New_York" title="wikilink">I-90</a>) for a mile. NY 980D (an unsigned <a href="reference_route_(New_York)" title="wikilink">reference route</a>) leaves to the east, where it becomes <a href="Massachusetts_Route_102" title="wikilink">Massachusetts Route 102</a> at the state line. After Thruway exit B3, NY 22 resumes its northerly heading. From here it intersects <a href="New_York_State_Route_295" title="wikilink">NY 295</a>, then passes <a href="Queechy_Lake" title="wikilink">Queechy Lake</a>. NY 22 then straightens out to reach <a href="New_Lebanon,_New_York" title="wikilink">New Lebanon</a>, where it intersects <a href="U.S._Route_20_in_New_York" title="wikilink">US 20</a>. New York's longest east–west route (US 20) overlaps with its longest north–south route (NY 22) for a mile before the former continues to <a href="Pittsfield,_Massachusetts" title="wikilink">Pittsfield</a> and the latter returns to the border-paralleling course, which takes it into <a href="Rensselaer_County,_New_York" title="wikilink">Rensselaer County</a>.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> <img src="NYSR22_WashingtonCty.jpg" title="fig:Route 22 through Washington County" alt="Route 22 through Washington County" /> As NY 22 continues north, it remains, at first, within a mile of Massachusetts, moving to the east to intersect with <a href="New_York_State_Route_43" title="wikilink">NY 43</a> in <a href="Stephentown,_New_York" title="wikilink">Stephentown</a>. North of that junction, it begins to run through a deep, isolated, lightly populated valley in the New York section of the <a href="Berkshire_Mountains" title="wikilink">Berkshires</a>. Wide curves take the road through <a href="Berlin,_New_York" title="wikilink">Berlin</a>, where <a href="Berlin_Mountain" title="wikilink">Berlin Mountain</a>, the highest peak in the state outside of the Catskills and Adirondacks, caps the eastern skyline. Route 22 trends further west, then back east to where <a href="New_York_State_Route_2" title="wikilink">NY 2</a> crosses via an overpass at <a href="Petersburgh,_New_York" title="wikilink">Petersburgh</a> on its way to Petersburg Pass, the northernmost crossing of the New York-Massachusetts state line. The next road to head east from NY 22, <a href="New_York_State_Route_346" title="wikilink">NY 346</a> at North Petersburgh, enters <a href="Vermont" class="uri" title="wikilink">Vermont</a>.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a></p>
<p>Shortly afterward, the highway descends gently from the Berkshires to meet another major state road, <a href="New_York_State_Route_7" title="wikilink">NY 7</a>, and overlaps with it for a short distance. Two miles after that concurrency ends, NY 22 follows the upper <a href="Hoosic_River" title="wikilink">Hoosic River</a> to <a href="Hoosick_Falls,_New_York" title="wikilink">Hoosick Falls</a>, the first village it has passed through since Millerton. There are no other state routes here, but after another , at North Hoosick, <a href="New_York_State_Route_67" title="wikilink">NY 67</a> comes in from the east and the two roads overlap as they leave Rensselaer County.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="washington-county">Washington County</h3>
<p>Almost immediately after the joined roads cross the county line, NY 67 splits off to the west, crossing the Hoosick back into Rensselaer County, while NY 22 straightens out again to go due north. After , it reaches <a href="Cambridge_(village),_New_York" title="wikilink">Cambridge</a>, where <a href="New_York_State_Route_313" title="wikilink">NY 313</a> forks off to the east. In the middle of town, <a href="New_York_State_Route_372" title="wikilink">NY 372</a>, a local connector to <a href="Greenwich,_New_York" title="wikilink">Greenwich</a>, ends.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> <img src="NY_22_-_US_4_concurrency_signs.jpg" title="fig:NY 22 along with its concurrency with U.S. Route 4 south of Whitehall" alt="NY 22 along with its concurrency with U.S. Route 4 south of Whitehall" /> North of Cambridge, the highway continues through a rolling landscape of fields and farms, the low transitional country between the <a href="Appalachian_Mountains" title="wikilink">Appalachians</a> and the <a href="Adirondack_Mountains" title="wikilink">Adirondacks</a>. Beyond <a href="New_York_State_Route_29" title="wikilink">NY 29</a>'s eastern terminus at Greenwich Junction, Route 22 heads eastward again through  of countryside until, just before reaching <a href="Granville_(village),_New_York" title="wikilink">Granville</a>, it comes within a  of the state line, the closest it has come to that boundary since Austerlitz. At the village's south end, NY 22 intersects <a href="New_York_State_Route_149" title="wikilink">NY 149</a> and the two routes overlap for several blocks until NY 149 begins its short journey to Vermont. Just north of Granville, the first of NY 22's two suffixed routes, <a href="New_York_State_Route_22A" title="wikilink">NY 22A</a>, begins its route running closely parallel to the state line and then into Vermont, where it becomes <a href="Vermont_Route_22A" title="wikilink">VT 22A</a>, paralleling the parent route for some distance on the other side of the state line.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a></p>
<p>Immediately after this junction, NY 22 begins a long curve away from the state line that has it running due west at the end of <a href="New_York_State_Route_40" title="wikilink">NY 40</a> in North Granville.

<p>The road from the modern-day Bronx (then part of Westchester County) through White Plains to Bedford and points north was originally an old Indian path.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> This path was later used and widened by the first European settlers.

<p>Once <a href="White_Plains,_New_York" title="wikilink">White Plains</a> became the county seat of <a href="Westchester_County,_New_York" title="wikilink">Westchester</a> in 1759, the road between this village and the city of New York (then encompassing only <a href="Manhattan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Manhattan</a>) became an important route and was established as the <strong>White Plains Post Road</strong>. Before 1797, the main road heading to points north and east out of Manhattan went via <a href="Kingsbridge,_Bronx" title="wikilink">Kingsbridge</a> along the old <a href="Boston_Post_Road" title="wikilink">Boston Post Road</a>.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a> A new bridge over the <a href="Harlem_River" title="wikilink">Harlem River</a> (the original <a href="Harlem_Bridge" title="wikilink">Harlem Bridge</a>) was opened in 1797, shortening the route out of Manhattan.
