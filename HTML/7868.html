<p><strong>Stephens City</strong> () is an <a href="List_of_towns_in_Virginia" title="wikilink">incorporated town</a> in the southern part of <a href="Frederick_County,_Virginia" title="wikilink">Frederick County</a>, <a href="Virginia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Virginia</a>, United States, with a population of 1,146 at the time of the <a href="2000_United_States_Census" title="wikilink">2000 Census</a> and an estimated population of 1,503 in 2009.</p>
<p>Founded by <a href="Peter_Stephens_(pioneer)" title="wikilink">Peter Stephens</a> in the 1730s, the colonial town was chartered and named for Lewis Stephens in September 1758. It was originally settled by German <a href="Protestant" title="wikilink">Protestants</a> from <a href="Heidelberg" class="uri" title="wikilink">Heidelberg</a>. Stephens City is the second-oldest municipality in the <a href="Shenandoah_Valley" title="wikilink">Shenandoah Valley</a> after nearby <a href="Winchester,_Virginia" title="wikilink">Winchester</a>, which is about  to the north. &quot;Crossroads&quot;, the first <a href="free_black" title="wikilink">free black</a> community in the Valley in the pre-<a href="American_Civil_War" title="wikilink">Civil War</a> years, was founded east of town in the 1850s. Crossroads remained until the beginning of the Civil War when the freed blacks either escaped or were recaptured. Stephens City was saved from being burnt in 1864 by <a href="Union_(American_Civil_War)" title="wikilink">Union</a> Major Joseph K. Stearns. The town has gone through several name changes in its history, starting as Stephensburg, then Newtown, and finally winding up as Stephens City, though it nearly became Pantops. <a href="Interstate_81" title="wikilink">Interstate 81</a> and <a href="U.S._Route_11" title="wikilink">U.S. Route 11</a> pass close to and through the town, respectively.</p>
<p>A large section of the center of the town, including buildings and homes, covering , is part of the <a href="Newtown-Stephensburg_Historic_District" title="wikilink">Newtown-Stephensburg Historic District</a> and was listed on the <a href="National_Register_of_Historic_Places" title="wikilink">National Register of Historic Places</a> in 1992. Stephens City celebrated its 250th anniversary on September 1, 2008. The town is a part of the <a href="Winchester,_VA-WV_MSA" title="wikilink">Winchester, Virginia-West Virginia Metropolitan Statistical Area</a>, an offshoot of the <a href="Baltimore&lt;U+2013&gt;Washington_Metropolitan_Area" title="wikilink">Washington&lt;U+2013&gt;Baltimore&lt;U+2013&gt;Northern Virginia, DC&lt;U+2013&gt;MD&lt;U+2013&gt;VA&lt;U+2013&gt;WV Combined Statistical Area</a>.

<p>Jost Hite, a German immigrant, purchased a large land grant in the northern <a href="Shenandoah_Valley" title="wikilink">Shenandoah Valley</a> in 1731.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a><a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> Peter Stephens and a small party of German <a href="Protestant" title="wikilink">Protestants</a> from <a href="Heidelberg" class="uri" title="wikilink">Heidelberg</a>, in the <a href="Palatinate_(region)" title="wikilink">Palatinate</a>, arrived about 1732 to buy and settle that land, including the site of what became Stephens City, named for the Stephens family.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a><a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a><a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> Although Hite's title to the land was challenged by <a href="Thomas_Fairfax,_6th_Lord_Fairfax_of_Cameron" title="wikilink">Thomas Fairfax, 6th Lord Fairfax of Cameron</a>, the land baron of the area,<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> the matter was settled amicably.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a><a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<p>Town lots were laid out beginning in 1754, and in 1758 the <a href="Virginia_General_Assembly" title="wikilink">Virginia General Assembly</a> granted a charter for the town of &quot;Stephensburgh&quot;. The mostly German-speaking residents soon left off the &quot;h&quot;; the town was usually spelled &quot;Stephensburg&quot;.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> By the start of the <a href="Revolutionary_War" title="wikilink">Revolutionary War</a>, Stephensburg was often called simply &quot;New Town&quot; or &quot;Newtown&quot;, as the new settlement on the <a href="Great_Wagon_Road" title="wikilink">Great Wagon Road</a> south of Winchester.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<p>Shenandoah Valley and Newtown's central location attracted heavy traffic through the region, and wagon-making emerged as an important industry for the town; Newtown artisans supplied wagons throughout the state.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>

<p>By 1830, the town's population had reached 800.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> In the late 1850s, free blacks began a settlement about a mile east of town which became known as Crossroads or Freetown. The community lasted until the Civil War began, when some of the free blacks left for the North; others were captured and forced to fight for the Confederates.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<p>When the <a href="American_Civil_War" title="wikilink">American Civil War</a> broke out in 1861, the majority of Newtown's young men joined <a href="Confederate_States_of_America" title="wikilink">Confederate</a> forces.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a><a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> During the war, the town was &quot;between the lines&quot;,<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> nominally controlled by the <a href="Union_(American_Civil_War)" title="wikilink">Union</a> but with much Confederate <a href="Partisan_(political)" title="wikilink">partisan</a> activity.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> On May 24, 1864, <a href="Stonewall_Jackson" title="wikilink">Stonewall Jackson</a>'s Confederate <a href="Jackson&#39;s_Valley_Campaign" title="wikilink">forces</a> advanced northward on the Valley Pike and attacked Union troops.

Stearns of the 1st New York Cavalry arrived under orders to burn the town down to help stop Confederate ambushes on the wagon road. Because the remaining population mostly consisted of women, children and the elderly, Stearns allowed the town to stand. He required the adult residents to take the &quot;<a href="Ironclad_oath" title="wikilink">Ironclad oath</a>&quot;,<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a><a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> in which they swore that they had not voluntarily provided aid to the Confederacy.

<p>In April 1867, the Virginia General Assembly granted a charter to the Winchester and Strasburg Railroad Company. The company was authorized to construct a rail line between Winchester and Strasburg, linking Newtown to the rest of the nation by railroad for the first time. Though the railroad improved the local economy, which had lagged after the end of the war, it decimated the wagon-building trade.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> In 1880, the United States Post Office Department, faced with nearly a dozen Newtowns in Virginia, announced that the local post office would be renamed Pantops.

<p>The 20th century brought improvements to energy and domestic systems: electrical service was introduced in 1915; and in 1941, just before World War II, the town installed a water system.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> The construction of <a href="Interstate_81" title="wikilink">Interstate 81</a> (I-81) during the early 1960s depressed business development in the town. The wagon road, which had been made part of <a href="U.S._Route_11" title="wikilink">U.S. Route 11</a>, had led traffic through the center of town, but the interstate passed less than a tenth of a mile to the east, encouraging development east of town and causing the downtown businesses to decline. Developers constructed new residential subdivisions both within and outside the town boundaries to the east for access to I-81.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a></p>
<p>The town surveyed its older buildings to establish architectural significance and to determine those that contributed to the town's historic center. The <a href="Newtown-Stephensburg_Historic_District" title="wikilink">Newtown-Stephensburg Historic District</a> was listed on the <a href="National_Register_of_Historic_Places" title="wikilink">National Register of Historic Places</a> in August 1992.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> Renovation of the town center has attracted <a href="heritage_tourism" title="wikilink">heritage tourism</a>.

While hurricanes (or their remnants) occasionally track through the area in late summer and early fall, they have often weakened by the time they reach Stephens City, partly due to the city's far inland location.
