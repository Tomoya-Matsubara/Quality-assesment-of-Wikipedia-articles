<p><strong><em>Night Fishing</em></strong> (stylized as <strong><em>NIGHT FISHING</em></strong>) is the second <a href="studio_album" title="wikilink">studio album</a> by <a href="Japanese_people" title="wikilink">Japanese</a> band <a href="Sakanaction" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sakanaction</a>. It was released on January 23, 2008 through <a href="Victor_Entertainment" title="wikilink">Victor Entertainment</a>'s BabeStar Label.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> The album was the band's second and final album to be recorded in their native Hokkaido. It primarily featured music written by vocalist Ichiro Yamaguchi since the release of their debut album <em><a href="Go_to_the_Future" title="wikilink">Go to the Future</a></em> (2007), and was their first album to be purposely conceived of as an album.</p>
<p>The album was preceded by the digital singles &quot;Word&quot;, &quot;Sample&quot; and &quot;Night Fishing Is Good&quot; in December 2007. Out of these, &quot;Sample&quot; was chosen as the main promotional track for the album, receiving high radio play in Hokkaido. <em>Go to the Future</em> was more commercially successful than <em>Go to the Future</em>, reaching number 53 on the <a href="Oricon" class="uri" title="wikilink">Oricon</a> singles chart. Critically, the band was praised for their new direction on <em>Night Fishing</em>, with critics praising the album's word-play, melodies and arrangements.</p>
<p>In 2009, the album was made available globally as a digital download, alongside the band's debut and third albums <em>Go to the Future</em> (2007) and <em><a href="Shin-shiro_(album)" title="wikilink">Shin-shiro</a></em> (2009). In 2015, the album was reissued on CD, <a href="LP_record" title="wikilink">LP record</a> and <a href="Lossless_compression" title="wikilink">lossless</a> digital formats.</p>
<h2 id="background-and-development">Background and development</h2>
<p>Sakanaction was first formed in 2005 in <a href="Sapporo" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sapporo</a>, <a href="Hokkaido" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hokkaido</a>. The band gained notoriety in Hokkaido after winning the audition to perform as a newcomer artist at the <a href="Rising_Sun_Rock_Festival" title="wikilink">Rising Sun Rock Festival</a> in <a href="Otaru,_Hokkaido" title="wikilink">Otaru</a> in August 2006, and after demos of their songs &quot;Mikazuki Sunset&quot; and &quot;Shiranami Top Water&quot; performed well on College Radio Japan Sapporo.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> The band were signed to major label <a href="Victor_Entertainment" title="wikilink">Victor Entertainment</a>, and released their debut album <em><a href="Go_to_the_Future" title="wikilink">Go to the Future</a></em> on May 7, 2007, through Victor's BabeStar Label. The group performed a short tour of Japan to promote the album's release, performing concerts in <a href="Tokyo" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tokyo</a>, <a href="Osaka" class="uri" title="wikilink">Osaka</a> and <a href="Nagoya" class="uri" title="wikilink">Nagoya</a> from May 11 to May 13, and held a solo-billed live at Bessie Hall in Sapporo on May 27.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> Many of the songs that were later included on <em>Night Fishing</em> were performed at the Sapporo concert, including &quot;Teenage&quot; and &quot;Amsfish&quot;.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a><a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>Since their debut, the band was based in Sapporo, and recorded their albums there.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a><a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> This would become their last Hokkaido-based release, after the group moved to Tokyo in mid 2008.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="writing-and-production">Writing and production</h2>
<h3 id="album-creation">Album creation</h3>
<p>Due to the response to the band's debut album <em>Go to the Future</em>, Sakanaction's <a href="Artists_and_repertoire" title="wikilink">A&amp;R</a> team pushed them to quickly follow this up with a second album.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> Sakanaction felt extremely pressured while creating the album, especially by Sakanaction's Victor Entertainment musical director.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a><a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> The song &quot;Word&quot; was inspired by this pressure, and in place of the lyric  found on the final cut, in the original Yamaguchi had used the lyric , in reference to their director and Victor.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<p>The majority of the songs present on the album were written specifically for it. The band members felt like <em>Night Fishing</em> was their first release that they had made together as a five-member band, as opposed to <em>Go to the Future</em>, which Yamaguchi described as feeling like a &quot;business card&quot; due to the inclusion of mostly old material.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a><a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> The material for the album was created based on the response and criticism for their debut album, and the members realization that they should not be frightened to make bold changes.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a><a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> However, several songs were already written beforehand: &quot;Sample&quot; was originally a song released by Yamaguchi's high school band Dutchman 2002, and &quot;Amsfish&quot; was a song written during Sakanaction's early days in 2005 that did not make the album cut of <em>Go to the Future</em>, because Yamaguchi felt that the song did not fit well on their debut release.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a><a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> The band attempted to make a more commercial sound compared to <em>Go to the Future</em>, and attempted to strike a balance between including underground, <a href="Minimal_music" title="wikilink">minimal</a> electronic music and &quot;high entertainment&quot; popular music.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> The band did not want to remove the feeling of fun from their music, so added <a href="progressive_rock" title="wikilink">progressive rock</a> aspects as well as sudden choral singing, and further expanded their sound by incorporating elements of <a href="Ambient_music" title="wikilink">ambient</a> and <a href="Folk_music" title="wikilink">folk</a> music.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a><a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> After performing their first Japanese tour in 2008, Sakanaction put more consideration into chosing arrangements that would work better at live concerts.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a></p>
<p>The album was created at a point where each of the band members wanted to put more of their own personalities into the music of Sakanaction, which led to <em>Night Fishing</em> becoming their most fought-over album.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a><a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> Sakanaction also had difficulty between themselves and their record label over deciding which song should have been the leading song. The label had chosen &quot;Sample&quot;, however there was a lot of opposition to this from Yamaguchi, who preferred &quot;Night Fishing Is Good&quot;.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> When the band unveiled their song to their director at Studio Milk , he did not react very well to the song, and the label chose not to promote this song due to its six-minute length.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a><a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> During this time, Yamaguchi had begun to realize the power of music videos after the rise in popularity of video-sharing websites such as <a href="YouTube" class="uri" title="wikilink">YouTube</a>, so decided to make his own low-budget video for the song; describing &quot;Night Fishing Is Good&quot; as the underground leading song for the album.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a><a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a></p>
<p>Lyrically, Yamaguchi worked around a &quot;night&quot; theme, and was inspired by creating film-like imagery for each song.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> Yamaguchi wanted to compile lyrics featuring introspective feelings of worry and sadness that people primarily felt at night.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> Yamaguchi was further inspired to write more autobiographically, creating a documentary-like non-fiction work.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> He was inspired to create lyrics closer to the style of <a href="haiku" class="uri" title="wikilink">haiku</a> than standard pop lyricisim, in order to express many things with as few phrases as possible.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a></p>

<p>Demo recording sessions for <em>Night Fishing</em> began several days before the release of the band's debut album <em>Go to the Future</em> in May 2007.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a><a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> The band members proposed the album concepts officially to Victor Entertainment staff in June 2007.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> The album's official studio recording sessions began in September 2007 and concluded in October, and were entirely undertaken at Discovery Studio in the Maruyama Nishi-machi area of <a href="Ch&lt;U+016B&gt;&lt;U+014D&gt;-ku,_Sapporo" title="wikilink">Ch&lt;U+016B&gt;&lt;U+014D&gt;-ku, Sapporo</a>.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a><a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a><a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> After the album sessions had finished, however, the band immediately kept on recording for their future projects.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> The album's track order was not considered until the very final, mastering stages of the album.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> Yamaguchi did much of the album's final mixing himself personally.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a></p>
<p>Several plans for the album did not come into being. Originally the band had planned for &quot;Ame wa Kimagure&quot; to be the leading song on the album, but after producing the song, Yamaguchi felt that the song's arrangement was too stylish and not easily accessible.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> The band had wanted to shoot a video for &quot;Atarashii Sekai&quot; on location in <a href="Kyoto" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kyoto</a>, however they had to abandon plans for this.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a></p>

</figure>
<p>Despite &quot;Word&quot; being inspired by the pressure by the band's musical director, it was strongly influenced by the album's night theme. Yamaguchi created the image of walking next to a river with a girl as the basis for the song, and wanted to create a song that would make a person cry if they heard it on a winter's night.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a><a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> Initially he struggled to actualize this, but managed to become inspired after creating the lyric <em>yoru ga bokura o tameshiteru na</em>.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a> When the song was first performed in concert, it originally was given the temporary title , and was written as a song to give to former <a href="Judy_and_Mary" title="wikilink">Judy and Mary</a> vocalist <a href="Yuki_(singer)" title="wikilink">Yuki</a>, however plans did not come to fruition.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a><a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a></p>
<p>The song &quot;Sample&quot; had many different arrangements initially. As they had not intended for the song to becoming the leading promotional track, they had decided to use an arrangement with strong synthesizer sounds, instead of a more easy to understand, commercial sound.<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a> Originally Ymaguchi had wanted to make the song faster, but after finding that speeding up the song distorted the song's melody and lyrical impression settled on 126BPM.<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a></p>
<p>For the song &quot;Night Fishing Is Good&quot;, Yamaguchi wanted to create a song that mimicked the emotions of fishing: initially deep in meditative thought that is suddenly broken when a fish gets hooked, and finally experiencing joy at catching the fish.<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a><a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a> Guitarist Motoharu Iwadera was the member who spent the most time contributing to the production of the song, and the band tried to have as much fun as possible with the arrangement.<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a><a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a> Yamaguchi quickly wrote the song after reading a review in <em>Musica</em> of <a href="Clammbon" class="uri" title="wikilink">Clammbon</a>'s album <em>Musical</em> (2007). He had wanted to make a song inspired by <a href="Musical_theatre" title="wikilink">musicals</a> and <a href="classical_music" title="wikilink">classical music</a>, however felt that Clammbon might have beaten him to the punch.<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a> &quot;Night Fishing Is Good&quot; was one of several Sakanaction songs where he created the music and lyrics simultaneously; it was only later that part of the song's title was chosen to become the album's title.<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a><a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a> The other members of Sakanaction were hesitant about the song first, after hearing how complex it was when Yamaguchi performed it solo on guitar during studio demo sessions, and suggested that they split it into two songs.<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a> Part way through the song's recording, Yamaguchi was suddenly inspired to make the song similar to music of English rock band <a href="Queen_(band)" title="wikilink">Queen</a>, which pianist Okazaki responded well to. Iwadera added Queen-style guitar riffs to the song, and the group decided to add chorus work in the style of Queen.<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a></p>
<p>Despite the album's track order not being decided until the very end, Yamaguchi had from the start thought that &quot;Ame wa Kimagure&quot;, &quot;Malaysia 32&quot; and &quot;Uneri&quot; should be in that order.<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a> After plans for &quot;Ame wa Kimagure&quot; to become the leading song were scrapped, Yamaguchi decided to elaborate on the &quot;oriental&quot; feel of the song.<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a> &quot;Malaysia 32&quot; is the band's first instrumental song, and was based on a synthesizer riff made by Iwadera which was then completed with ideas from everyone in the band.<a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a><a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a> The song was called &quot;Malaysia&quot; because of how at one point they added a vocal melody that sounded like the name of the city <a href="Kuala_Lumpur" title="wikilink">Kuala Lumpur</a>.<a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a> The number 32 in the title is a reference to the fact that the song is based on a synthesizer loop of 32 <a href="Bar_(music)" title="wikilink">bars</a>.<a href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a> Originally &quot;Uneri&quot; had been envisioned as a rock song, but the band decided against this after creating &quot;Night Fishing Is Good&quot;. The band's musical director suggested that they make the song acoustically instead, which led to the final studio arrangement of &quot;Uneri&quot;.<a href="#fn67" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a></p>

<p>The album was first announced on November 12, 2007.<a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a> In December, Sakanaction traveled to the Tokyo area to promote the album, including a performance at the <em>Countdown Japan 07/08</em> new year's music festival.<a href="#fn69" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref69"><sup>69</sup></a><a href="#fn70" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a></p>
