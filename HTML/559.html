<p><strong><em>Sherlock</em></strong> is a British television <a href="crime_drama" title="wikilink">crime drama</a> that presents a contemporary update of Sir <a href="Arthur_Conan_Doyle" title="wikilink">Arthur Conan Doyle</a>'s <a href="Sherlock_Holmes" title="wikilink">Sherlock Holmes</a> detective stories. It stars <a href="Benedict_Cumberbatch" title="wikilink">Benedict Cumberbatch</a> as Holmes and <a href="Martin_Freeman" title="wikilink">Martin Freeman</a> as <a href="Doctor_Watson" title="wikilink">Doctor John Watson</a>. <a href="List_of_Sherlock_episodes" title="wikilink">Six episodes</a>, broadcast since 2010, have been produced, with three more episodes scheduled to begin production in March 2013. The series has been sold to over 180 territories.</p>
<p>The show was conceived by <a href="Steven_Moffat" title="wikilink">Steven Moffat</a> and <a href="Mark_Gatiss" title="wikilink">Mark Gatiss</a> during train journeys to and from the <em><a href="Doctor_Who" title="wikilink">Doctor Who</a></em> production base in <a href="Cardiff" class="uri" title="wikilink">Cardiff</a>, where they were both writers. They aspired to produce a modern-day version of Conan Doyle's stories in which Sherlock uses the technologies that are available to him today in order to find things out and solve crime. Credited as co-creators, Moffat and Gatiss each write one episode per series, with the other written by <a href="Stephen_Thompson_(writer)" title="wikilink">Steve Thompson</a>. <a href="Hartswood_Films" title="wikilink">Hartswood Films</a> produced the series for the <a href="BBC" class="uri" title="wikilink">BBC</a> and co-produced it with <a href="WGBH-TV" title="wikilink">WGBH</a> Boston for its <em><a href="Masterpiece_(TV_series)" title="wikilink">Masterpiece</a></em> <a href="anthology_series" title="wikilink">anthology series</a>. The series is primarily filmed in Cardiff, although the production also uses a variety of other locations. <a href="North_Gower_Street" title="wikilink">North Gower Street</a> in <a href="London" class="uri" title="wikilink">London</a> was used for exterior shots of Holmes and Watson's <a href="221B_Baker_Street" title="wikilink">221B Baker Street</a> residence.</p>
<p><em>Sherlock</em> depicts &quot;consulting detective&quot; Holmes, assisting the <a href="Metropolitan_Police_Service" title="wikilink">Metropolitan Police Service</a>, primarily <a href="Inspector_Lestrade" title="wikilink">DI Greg Lestrade</a> (<a href="Rupert_Graves" title="wikilink">Rupert Graves</a>), in solving various crimes. Holmes is assisted by his flatmate, Dr John Watson, who has returned from military service in <a href="Afghanistan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Afghanistan</a>. Although the series depicts a variety of crimes and perpetrators, Holmes' conflict with his nemesis <a href="Professor_Moriarty" title="wikilink">Jim Moriarty</a> (<a href="Andrew_Scott_(actor)" title="wikilink">Andrew Scott</a>) is a recurring feature. Pathologist Molly Hooper (<a href="Louise_Brealey" title="wikilink">Louise Brealey</a>) assists Holmes in her laboratory. Other recurring roles include <a href="Una_Stubbs" title="wikilink">Una Stubbs</a> as <a href="Mrs._Hudson" title="wikilink">Mrs. Hudson</a>, Holmes and Watson's landlady; <a href="Vinette_Robinson" title="wikilink">Vinette Robinson</a> as Sgt. Sally Donovan; and Mark Gatiss as Sherlock's brother, <a href="Mycroft_Holmes" title="wikilink">Mycroft Holmes</a>.</p>
<p>After an unbroadcast pilot in 2009, the first series of three 90-minute episodes was transmitted on <a href="BBC_One" title="wikilink">BBC One</a> and <a href="BBC_HD" title="wikilink">BBC HD</a> in 2010, with a second series of three episodes first broadcast in 2012. Critical reception was overwhelmingly positive, with many reviews commending the quality of the writing, performances and direction. <em>Sherlock</em> has been <a href="List_of_awards_and_nominations_received_by_Sherlock" title="wikilink">nominated for numerous awards</a>, including <a href="British_Academy_Television_Awards" title="wikilink">BAFTAs</a> and <a href="Emmy_Awards" title="wikilink">Emmys</a>, winning several across a variety of categories. All six episodes have been released on DVD and <a href="Blu-ray" class="uri" title="wikilink">Blu-ray</a> Disc in the United Kingdom, alongside <a href="tie-in" class="uri" title="wikilink">tie-in</a> editions of some of Conan Doyle's original books. Soundtrack albums from each series have also been released.</p>

<h3 id="conception-and-development">Conception and development</h3>
<p><a href="Steven_Moffat" title="wikilink">Steven Moffat</a> and <a href="Mark_Gatiss" title="wikilink">Mark Gatiss</a> devised the concept of the series, both of whom had experience adapting or using <a href="Victorian_literature" title="wikilink">Victorian literature</a> for television and are both big <a href="Sherlock_Holmes" title="wikilink">Sherlock Holmes</a> fans.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a><a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> Moffat had previously adapted the <em><a href="Strange_Case_of_Dr_Jekyll_and_Mr_Hyde" title="wikilink">Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde</a></em> for the 2007 series <em><a href="Jekyll_(TV_series)" title="wikilink">Jekyll</a></em>,<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> while Gatiss had written the <a href="Charles_Dickens" title="wikilink">Dickensian</a> <em><a href="Doctor_Who" title="wikilink">Doctor Who</a></em> episode &quot;<a href="The_Unquiet_Dead" title="wikilink">The Unquiet Dead</a>&quot;.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> Moffat and Gatiss, both of whom are <em>Doctor Who</em> writers, discussed plans for a Holmes adaptation during their numerous train journeys to <a href="Cardiff" class="uri" title="wikilink">Cardiff</a> where <em>Doctor Who</em> production is based.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> While they were in <a href="Monte_Carlo" title="wikilink">Monte Carlo</a> for an awards ceremony, Moffat's wife, producer <a href="Sue_Vertue" title="wikilink">Sue Vertue</a>, encouraged Moffat and Gatiss to develop the project themselves before another creative team had the same idea.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> Moffat and Gatiss invited <a href="Stephen_Thompson_(writer)" title="wikilink">Steve Thompson</a> to write for the series in September 2008.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p>Gatiss has criticised recent television adaptations of the Conan Doyle stories as &quot;too reverential and too slow&quot;, aiming instead to be as irreverent to the <a href="Canon_(fiction)" title="wikilink">canon</a> as the <a href="Sherlock_Holmes_(1939_film_series)" title="wikilink">1930s and 1940s films</a> starring <a href="Basil_Rathbone" title="wikilink">Basil Rathbone</a>.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> Benedict Cumberbatch's Sherlock uses modern technology, such as texting, the internet, and <a href="Global_Positioning_System" title="wikilink">GPS</a>, to solve crimes.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> <a href="Paul_McGuigan_(filmmaker)" title="wikilink">Paul McGuigan</a>, who directed two episodes of <em>Sherlock</em>, says that this is in keeping with Conan Doyle's character, pointing out that &quot;[i]n the books he would use any device possible and he was always in the lab doing experiments. It's just a modern-day version of it. He will use the tools that are available to him today in order to find things out.&quot;<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<p>The update maintains some traditional elements of the stories, such as the <a href="221B_Baker_Street" title="wikilink">Baker Street address</a> and Holmes's archenemy <a href="Professor_Moriarty" title="wikilink">Moriarty</a>.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> Although the events of the books are transferred to the present day, canonical elements are incorporated into the story. For example, Martin Freeman's Watson has returned from military service in <a href="War_in_Afghanistan_(2001&lt;U+2013&gt;present)" title="wikilink">Afghanistan</a>.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> While discussing the fact that the original Watson was invalided home after serving in the <a href="Second_Anglo-Afghan_War" title="wikilink">Second Anglo-Afghan War</a> (1878&lt;U+2013&gt;1880), Gatiss realised that &quot;[i]t is the same war now, I thought. The same unwinnable war.&quot;<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<p><em>Sherlock</em> was announced as a single 60-minute drama production at the <a href="Edinburgh_International_Television_Festival" title="wikilink">Edinburgh International Television Festival</a> in August 2008,<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> with broadcast set for mid to late 2009.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> The intention was to produce a series of six 60-minute episodes should the pilot prove to be successful.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a><a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> However, the first version of the pilot&lt;U+2014&gt;reported by <em><a href="The_Guardian" title="wikilink">The Guardian</a></em> to have cost &lt;U+00A3&gt;800,000&lt;U+2014&gt;led to rumours within the <a href="BBC" class="uri" title="wikilink">BBC</a> and wider media that <em>Sherlock</em> was a potential disaster.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a><a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> The BBC decided not to transmit the pilot, requesting a reshoot and a total of three 90-minute episodes.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a><a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> The original pilot was included on the DVD of the first series.

<h3 id="cast-and-characters">Cast and characters</h3>

<p>Moffat and Vertue became interested in casting Cumberbatch as the title character after watching his performance in the 2007 drama/war film <em><a href="Atonement_(film)" title="wikilink">Atonement</a></em>. The actor was cast after <a href="audition" title="wikilink">reading the script</a> for the creative team.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> &quot;Cumberbatch&quot;, says <em><a href="The_Guardian" title="wikilink">The Guardian</a></em>, &quot;has a reputation for playing odd, brilliant men very well, and his Holmes is cold, techie, slightly <a href="Asperger_syndrome" title="wikilink">Aspergerish</a>.&quot;<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> Cumberbatch said, &quot;There's a great charge you get from playing him, because of the volume of words in your head and the speed of thought&lt;U+2014&gt;you really have to make your connections incredibly fast. He is one step ahead of the audience, and of anyone around him with normal intellect. They can't quite fathom where his leaps are taking him.&quot;<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> <a href="Piers_Wenger" title="wikilink">Piers Wenger</a>, Head of Drama at <a href="BBC_Wales" title="wikilink">BBC Wales</a>, described the series' rendering of Sherlock as &quot;a dynamic <a href="superhero" class="uri" title="wikilink">superhero</a> in a modern world, an arrogant, genius sleuth driven by a desire to prove himself cleverer than the perpetrator and the police&lt;U+2014&gt;everyone in fact.&quot;<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> Addressing changing social attitudes and broadcasting regulations, Cumberbatch's Holmes replaced the <a href="Pipe_smoking" title="wikilink">pipe</a> with multiple <a href="nicotine_patches" title="wikilink">nicotine patches</a>.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> The writers believed that Sherlock should not talk like &quot;a completely modern person&quot;, says Moffat, but were initially intent that &quot;he never sounded like he's giving a lecture.&quot; However, Moffat turned the character &quot;more Victorian&quot; in the second series, capitalising more on Cumberbatch's &quot;beautiful voice&quot; to make it sound like &quot;he's giving a lecture&quot;.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a></p>
<p>In an interview with <em><a href="The_Observer" title="wikilink">The Observer</a></em>, co-creator Mark Gatiss says that they experienced more difficulty finding the right actor to play <a href="Doctor_Watson" title="wikilink">Dr. John Watson</a> than they had for the title character.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> Producer Sue Vertue said, &quot;Benedict was the only person we actually saw for [the part of] Sherlock... Once Benedict was there it was really just making sure we got the chemistry for John [Watson]&lt;U+2014&gt;and I think you get it as soon as they come into the room, you can see that they work together&quot;.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> Several actors auditioned for the part of Watson,<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> and Martin Freeman eventually took the role. Steven Moffat said that <a href="Matt_Smith_(actor)" title="wikilink">Matt Smith</a> was the first to audition unsuccessfully. He was rejected for being too &quot;barmy&quot;, as the producers required someone &quot;straighter&quot; for Watson.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> Shortly after, Moffat cast Smith as the <a href="Eleventh_Doctor" title="wikilink">Eleventh Doctor</a> in <em><a href="Doctor_Who" title="wikilink">Doctor Who</a></em>.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a></p>
<p>The writers said that Freeman's casting developed the way in which Cumberbatch played Holmes.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> The theme of &quot;friendship&quot; appealed to both Gatiss and Moffat.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> Gatiss asserted the importance of achieving the correct tone for the character. &quot;Watson is not an idiot, although it's true that Conan Doyle always took the piss out of him,&quot; said Gatiss. &quot;But only an idiot would surround himself with idiots.&quot;<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> Moffat said that Freeman is &quot;the sort of opposite of Benedict in everything except the amount of talent... Martin finds a sort of poetry in the ordinary man. I love the fastidious realism of everything he does.&quot;<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> Freeman describes his character as Sherlock's &quot;moral compass&quot; because the eponymous character doesn't always consider the morality and ethics of his actions.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a></p>
<p><a href="Rupert_Graves" title="wikilink">Rupert Graves</a> was cast as <a href="Inspector_Lestrade" title="wikilink">DI Greg Lestrade</a>. The writers referred to the character as &quot;Inspector Lestrade&quot; during development until Gatiss realised that in contemporary England the character would have the title &quot;Detective Inspector&quot;. Moffat and Gatiss pointed out that Lestrade does not appear often in the stories and is quite inconsistent in them. They decided to go with the version who appeared in &quot;<a href="The_Six_Napoleons" title="wikilink">The Six Napoleons</a>&quot;: a man who is frustrated by Holmes but admires him, and whom Holmes considers as the best person at <a href="Scotland_Yard" title="wikilink">Scotland Yard</a>.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> Several candidates took a comedic tack in their auditions, but the creative team preferred the gravitas that Graves brought to the role.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> His first name is revealed to be Greg in &quot;The Hounds of Baskerville.&quot;<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a></p>
<p><a href="Andrew_Scott_(actor)" title="wikilink">Andrew Scott</a> made his first appearance as <a href="Professor_Moriarty" title="wikilink">Jim Moriarty</a> in &quot;The Great Game&quot;. Moffat said, &quot;We knew what we wanted to do with Moriarty from the very beginning. Moriarty is usually a rather dull, rather posh villain so we thought someone who was genuinely properly frightening. Someone who's an absolute psycho.&quot;<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a> Moffat and Gatiss were originally not going to put a confrontation into these three episodes between Moriarty and Sherlock but realised that they &quot;just had to do a confrontation scene. We had to do a version of the scene in '<a href="The_Final_Problem" title="wikilink">The Final Problem</a>' in which the two archenemies meet each other.&quot;<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a></p>
<p>The remainder of the regular cast includes <a href="Una_Stubbs" title="wikilink">Una Stubbs</a> as <a href="Mrs._Hudson" title="wikilink">Mrs. Hudson</a> and co-creator <a href="Mark_Gatiss" title="wikilink">Mark Gatiss</a> as <a href="Mycroft_Holmes" title="wikilink">Mycroft Holmes</a>.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a> <a href="Vinette_Robinson" title="wikilink">Vinette Robinson</a>, <a href="Jonathan_Aris" title="wikilink">Jonathan Aris</a> and <a href="Louise_Brealey" title="wikilink">Louise Brealey</a> play the recurring roles of Sergeant Sally Donovan, Anderson and Molly Hooper, respectively.</p>

<p>Costumes for the pilot were designed by <a href="BAFTA_Cymru" title="wikilink">BAFTA Cymru</a> award-winning costume designer Ray Holman.<a href="#fn75" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref75"><sup>75</sup></a> Cumberbatch wore a &lt;U+00A3&gt;1,000 <a href="Belstaff" class="uri" title="wikilink">Belstaff</a> coat in the series.<a href="#fn76" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref76"><sup>76</sup></a> Sarah Arthur, the series' costume designer, explained how she achieved the detective's look. &quot;Holmes wouldn't have any interest in fashion so I went for classic suits with a modern twist: narrow-leg trousers and a two-button, slim-cut jacket.

<p>The writers say that they did not want to force modernity onto the story.<a href="#fn78" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref78"><sup>78</sup></a> There were some creative challenges, such as the decision to include the sign &quot;221B&quot; on Holmes' front door. Gatiss and Moffat reflect that in the modern world the door would only display the number of the house, and there would be doorbells for each flat. The full house number is so iconic that they felt unable to change it.<a href="#fn79" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref79"><sup>79</sup></a> The writers also decided that the lead characters would address each other by their first names, rather than the traditional Holmes and Watson.<a href="#fn80" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref80"><sup>80</sup></a> This was also reflected in the title of the series. Director Paul McGuigan came up with the idea of putting text messages on the screen instead of having cut-away shots of a hand holding the phone.<a href="#fn81" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref81"><sup>81</sup></a></p>
