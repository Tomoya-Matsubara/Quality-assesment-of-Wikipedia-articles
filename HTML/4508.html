<p><strong>Vil&lt;U+00E9&gt;m Flusser</strong> (May 12, 1920 &lt;U+2013&gt; November 27, 1991) was a <a href="Czechs" title="wikilink">Czech</a>-born <a href="philosopher" class="uri" title="wikilink">philosopher</a>, <a href="writer" class="uri" title="wikilink">writer</a> and <a href="journalist" class="uri" title="wikilink">journalist</a>. He lived for a long period in <a href="S&lt;U+00E3&gt;o_Paulo" title="wikilink">S&lt;U+00E3&gt;o Paulo</a> (where he became a <a href="Brazil" title="wikilink">Brazilian</a> citizen) and later in <a href="France" class="uri" title="wikilink">France</a>, and his works are written in several different languages.</p>
<p>His early work was marked by discussion of the thought of <a href="Martin_Heidegger" title="wikilink">Martin Heidegger</a>, and by the influence of <a href="existentialism" class="uri" title="wikilink">existentialism</a> and <a href="Phenomenology_(philosophy)" title="wikilink">phenomenology</a>. Phenomenology would play a major role in the transition to the later phase of his work, in which he turned his attention to the philosophy of communication and of artistic production. He contributed to the <a href="dichotomy" class="uri" title="wikilink">dichotomy</a> in history: the period of image worship, and period of text worship, with deviations consequently into idolatry and &quot;textolatry&quot;.</p>
<h2 id="life">Life</h2>
<p>Flusser was born in 1920 in <a href="Prague" class="uri" title="wikilink">Prague</a> into a family of <a href="Jewish" class="uri" title="wikilink">Jewish</a> <a href="intellectual" title="wikilink">intellectuals</a>. His father, <a href="Gustav_Flusser" title="wikilink">Gustav Flusser</a>, studied mathematics and physics (under <a href="Albert_Einstein" title="wikilink">Albert Einstein</a> among others). Flusser attended German and Czech primary schools and later a German grammar school.</p>
<p>In 1938, Flusser started to study philosophy at the Juridical Faculty of the <a href="Charles_University_in_Prague" title="wikilink">Charles University in Prague</a>. In 1939, shortly after the <a href="Nazi_Germany" title="wikilink">Nazi</a> occupation, Flusser emigrated to London (with Edith Barth, his later wife, and her parents) to continue his studies for one term at the <a href="London_School_of_Economics" title="wikilink">London School of Economics and Political Science</a>. Vil&lt;U+00E9&gt;m Flusser lost all of his family in the German concentration camps: his father died in <a href="Buchenwald" class="uri" title="wikilink">Buchenwald</a> in 1940; his grandparents, his mother and his sister were brought to <a href="Auschwitz" class="uri" title="wikilink">Auschwitz</a> and later to <a href="Theresienstadt" class="uri" title="wikilink">Theresienstadt</a> where they were killed. The next year, he emigrated to Brazil, living both in <a href="S&lt;U+00E3&gt;o_Paulo" title="wikilink">S&lt;U+00E3&gt;o Paulo</a> and <a href="Rio_de_Janeiro" title="wikilink">Rio de Janeiro</a>. He started working at a Czech import/export company and then at Stabivolt, a manufacturer of radios and transistors.</p>
<p>In 1960 he started to collaborate with the Brazilian Institute for Philosophy (IBF) in S&lt;U+00E3&gt;o Paulo and published in the <em>Revista Brasileira de Filosofia</em>; by these means he seriously approached the Brazilian intellectual community. During that decade he published and taught at several schools in S&lt;U+00E3&gt;o Paulo, being Lecturer for Philosophy of Science at the Escola Polit&lt;U+00E9&gt;cnica of the <a href="University_of_S&lt;U+00E3&gt;o_Paulo" title="wikilink">University of S&lt;U+00E3&gt;o Paulo</a> and Professor of Philosophy of Communication at the Escola Dram&lt;U+00E1&gt;tica and the Escola Superior de Cinema in S&lt;U+00E3&gt;o Paulo. He also participated actively in the arts, collaborating with the <a href="Bienal_de_S&lt;U+00E3&gt;o_Paulo" title="wikilink">Bienal de S&lt;U+00E3&gt;o Paulo</a>, among other cultural events.</p>
<p>Beginning in the 1950s he taught philosophy and functioned as a journalist, before publishing his first book <em>L&lt;U+00ED&gt;ngua e realidade</em> (<em>Language and Reality</em>) in 1963. In 1972 he decided to leave Brazil. Some say it was because it was becoming difficult to publish because of the military regime. Others dispute this reason, since his work on communication and language did not threaten the military. In 1970, when a reform in the University of S&lt;U+00E3&gt;o Paulo made all lecturers of Philosophy members of the Department of Philosophy, Flusser, who taught at the Engineering School (Escola Polit&lt;U+00E9&gt;cnica), was dismissed; but it should be remembered that most members of the Department were critics of the military r&lt;U+00E9&gt;gime and considered Flusser as a rather conservative thinker. He lived in both Germany and the South of France. To the end of his life, he was quite active writing and giving lectures around <a href="media_theory" title="wikilink">media theory</a>. He died in 1991 in a car accident, while visiting his native Prague to give a lecture.</p>
<p>Vil&lt;U+00E9&gt;m Flusser is the cousin of <a href="David_Flusser" title="wikilink">David Flusser</a>.</p>
<h2 id="philosophy">Philosophy</h2>
<p>Flusser's essays are short, provocative and lucid, with a resemblance to the style of journalistic articles. Critics have noted he is less a 'systematic' thinker than a 'dialogic' one, purposefully eclectic and provocative (Cubitt 2004). However, his early books, written in the 1960s, primarily in <a href="Portuguese_language" title="wikilink">Portuguese</a>, and published in Brazil, have a slightly different style.</p>
<p>Flusser&lt;U+2019&gt;s writings relate to each other, however, which means that he intensively works over certain topics and dissects them into a number of brief essays. His main topics interest were: epistemology, ethics, aesthetics, ontology, language philosophy, semiotics, philosophy of science, the history of Western culture, the philosophy of religion, the history of symbolic language, technology, writing, the technical image, photography, migration, media and literature, and, especially in his later years, the philosophy of communication and of artistic production.</p>
<p>His writings reflect his wandering life: although the majority of his work was written in <a href="German_language" title="wikilink">German</a> and <a href="Portuguese_language" title="wikilink">Portuguese</a>, he also wrote in <a href="English_language" title="wikilink">English</a> and <a href="French_language" title="wikilink">French</a>, with scarce translation to other languages. Because Flusser's writings in different languages are dispersed in the form of books, articles or sections of books, his work as a media philosopher and cultural theorist is only now becoming more widely known. The first book by Flusser to be published in English was <em>Towards a Philosophy of Photography</em> in 1984 by European Photography, which was his own translation of the work. <em>The Shape of Things</em>, was published in London in 1999 and was followed by a new translation of <em>Towards a Philosophy of Photography</em>.</p>
<p>Flusser's archives have been held by the <a href="Academy_of_Media_Arts" title="wikilink">Academy of Media Arts</a> in <a href="Cologne" class="uri" title="wikilink">Cologne</a> and are currently housed at the <a href="Berlin_University_of_the_Arts" title="wikilink">Berlin University of the Arts</a>.</p>
<h3 id="philosophy-of-photography">Philosophy of photography</h3>
<p>Writing about photography in the 1970s and 80s, in the face of the early worldwide impact of computer technologies, Flusser argued that the photograph was the first in a number of technical image forms to have fundamentally changed the way in which the world is seen. Historically, the importance of photography had been that it introduced nothing less than a new epoch: 'The invention of photography constitutes a break in history that can only be understood in comparison to that other historical break constituted by the invention of linear writing.'<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>Whereas ideas might previously have been interpreted in terms of their written form, photography heralded new forms of perceptual experience and knowledge. As one recent commentator put it: 'For Flusser, photography is not only a reproductive imaging technology, it is a dominant cultural technique through which reality is constituted and understood'.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> In this context, Flusser argued that photographs have to be understood in strict separation from 'pre-technical image forms'. For example, he contrasted them to paintings which he described as images that can be sensibly 'decoded', because the viewer is able to interpret what he or she sees as more or less direct signs of what the painter intended. By contrast, even though photography produces images that seem to be 'faithful reproductions' of objects and events they cannot be so directly 'decoded'. The crux of this difference stems, for Flusser, from the fact that photographs are produced through the operations of an apparatus. And the photographic apparatus operates in ways that are not immediately known or shaped by its operator. For example, he described the act of photographing as follows:</p>

<p>Roughly put, the person using a camera might think that they are operating its controls to produce a picture that shows the world the way they want it to be seen, but it is the pre-programmed character of the camera that sets the parameters of this act and it is the apparatus that shapes the meaning of the resulting image. Given the central role of photography to almost all aspects of contemporary life, the programmed character of the photographic apparatus shapes the experience of looking at and interpreting photographs as well as most of the cultural contexts in which we do so.</p>
<p>Flusser developed a lexicon of terms that have proven influential and that continue to be useful for thinking about contemporary photography, digital imaging technologies and their online uses. These include: the 'apparatus' (a tool that changes the meaning of the world in contrast to what he calls mechanical tools that work to change the world itself); the 'functionary' (the photographer or operator of the camera who is bound by the rules it sets); the 'programme' (a 'system in which chance becomes necessity' and a game 'in which every virtuality, even the least probable, will be realized of necessity if the game is played for a sufficiently long time';<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> the 'technical image' (the first example of which is the photograph, with its particular kind of significant surface that looks like a traditional image but harbours encoded and obscure concepts that cannot be 'immediately' deciphered<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a>). Whilst Flusser did write a number of short essays on the work of specific photographers,<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> his major focus was the critical and philosophical need to understand late Twentieth Century media culture and the emergent possibilities and threats presented by the larger forces at work in an increasingly technical and automated world.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
