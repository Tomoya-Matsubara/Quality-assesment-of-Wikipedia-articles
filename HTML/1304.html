<p><strong>Turon National Park</strong> is located along a section of the <strong><a href="Turon_River,_New_South_Wales" title="wikilink">Turon River</a></strong> in central <a href="New_South_Wales" title="wikilink">New South Wales</a>, <a href="Australia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Australia</a>. Proposed as an area worth protecting in 1983, the park was not established until 2002. The park is 150 km north-west of <a href="Sydney" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sydney</a>, approximately 5km west of Capertee, near <a href="Lithgow,_New_South_Wales" title="wikilink">Lithgow, New South Wales</a>.</p>
<p>Turon National Park was one of the sites of the <a href="Australian_gold_rushes" title="wikilink">1851 gold rush</a> and remains from this era are still evident. Pasture land cleared in the past remain obvious. Sheoak grows along the river and a variety of gums cover the slopes. A large variety of native birds live within the park and red wallabies spend the day on the sandstone tops and descend at dusk to the valley. The Park is at a relatively high altitude (valley floor at around 750m above sea level, the tops at around 850m) due to the park's location within the Great Dividing Range. Sub-zero temperatures are common in the cooler months.</p>
<p>Access to the valley floor is difficult for 2WD vehicles and after heavy rainfall even 4WD access is doubtful.</p>
<p>Two campsites are identified on <a href="Wikimapia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Wikimapia</a>.</p>
