<p><strong>Autism</strong> is a <a href="Neurodevelopmental_disorders" title="wikilink">brain development disorder</a> characterized by impairments in social interaction and communication, and restricted and repetitive behavior, all exhibited before a child is three years old. These characteristics distinguish autism from milder <a href="autism_spectrum_disorders" title="wikilink">autism spectrum disorders</a> (ASD).</p>
<p><a href="Heritability" class="uri" title="wikilink">Heritability</a> contributes a large fraction of the risk of a child's developing the disorder, although the <a href="Heritability_of_autism" title="wikilink">genetics of autism</a> are complex, and it is generally unclear which genes are responsible.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> In rare cases, autism is strongly associated with <a href="Teratology" title="wikilink">agents</a> that cause birth defects.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> Other proposed <a href="Causes_of_autism" title="wikilink">causes</a>, such as the exposure of children to vaccines, are <a href="Controversies_in_autism" title="wikilink">controversial</a> and the vaccine hypotheses are unsupported by convincing <a href="Evidence-based_medicine" title="wikilink">scientific evidence</a>.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> Most recent reviews estimate a <a href="prevalence" class="uri" title="wikilink">prevalence</a> of one to two cases per 1,000 people for autism, and about six per 1,000 for ASD, with ASD averaging a 4.3:1 male-to-female ratio. The number of people known to have autism has increased dramatically since the 1980s, at least partly due to changes in diagnostic practice; the question of whether prevalence has increased is unresolved.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>Autism affects many parts of the brain; how this occurs is poorly understood. Parents usually notice signs in the first year or two of their child's life. Early intervention may help children gain self-care and social skills, although few of these interventions are supported by scientific studies; there is no cure.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> With severe autism, independent living is unlikely; with milder autism, there are some success stories for adults,<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> and an <a href="Sociological_and_cultural_aspects_of_autism" title="wikilink">autistic culture</a> has developed, with some seeking a cure and others believing that autism is a condition rather than a disorder.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>

<p>Of the other four autism spectrum disorders, <a href="Asperger&#39;s_syndrome" title="wikilink">Asperger's syndrome</a> is closest to autism in signs and likely causes; <a href="Rett_syndrome" title="wikilink">Rett syndrome</a> and <a href="childhood_disintegrative_disorder" title="wikilink">childhood disintegrative disorder</a> share several signs with autism, but may have unrelated causes; <a href="PDD-NOS" title="wikilink">pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS)</a> is diagnosed when the criteria are not met for a more specific disorder.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> Unlike autism, Asperger's has no substantial delay in <a href="language_development" title="wikilink">language development</a>.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> The terminology of autism can be bewildering, with autism, Asperger's and PDD-NOS sometimes called the <em>autistic disorders</em>,<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> whereas autism itself is often called <em>autistic disorder</em>, <em>childhood autism</em>, or <em>infantile autism</em>. In this article, <em>autism</em> refers to the classic autistic disorder, while other sources sometimes use <em>autism</em> to refer to autistic disorders or even ASD. ASD, in turn, is a subset of the broader autism <a href="phenotype" class="uri" title="wikilink">phenotype</a> (BAP), which describes individuals who may not have ASD but do have autistic-like <a href="Trait_(biology)" title="wikilink">traits</a>, such as avoiding eye contact.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<p>The manifestations of autism cover a wide spectrum, ranging from individuals with severe impairments&lt;U+2014&gt;who may be silent, <a href="Developmental_Disability" title="wikilink">mentally disabled</a>, and locked into hand flapping and rocking&lt;U+2014&gt;to less impaired individuals who may have active but distinctly odd social approaches, narrowly focused interests, and verbose, pedantic communication.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> Sometimes the syndrome is divided into low-, medium- and <a href="high-functioning_autism" title="wikilink">high-functioning autism</a> (LFA, MFA, and HFA), based on <a href="IQ" class="uri" title="wikilink">IQ</a> thresholds,<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> or on how much support the individual requires in daily life; these subdivisions are not standardized and are controversial.

<p>Some studies have reported diagnoses of autism in children due to a loss of language or social skills, as opposed to a failure to make progress. Several terms are used for this phenomenon, including <a href="regressive_autism" title="wikilink">regressive autism</a>, setback autism, and developmental stagnation. The validity of this distinction remains controversial; it is possible that regressive autism is a specific subtype.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a><a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="characteristics">Characteristics</h2>
<p>Autism is distinguished by a pattern of symptoms rather than one single symptom. The main characteristics are impairments in social interaction, impairments in communication, restricted interests and repetitive behavior. Other aspects, such as atypical eating, are also common but are not essential for diagnosis.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="social-development">Social development</h3>
<p>People with autism have social impairments and often lack the intuition about others that many people take for granted. Noted autistic <a href="Temple_Grandin" title="wikilink">Temple Grandin</a> described her inability to understand the social communication of <a href="neurotypical" title="wikilink">neurotypicals</a> as leaving her feeling &quot;like an anthropologist on Mars&quot;.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a></p>
<p>Social impairments become apparent early in childhood and continue through adulthood. Autistic infants show less attention to social stimuli, smile and look at others less often, and respond less to their own name. Autistic toddlers have more striking social deviance; for example, they have less <a href="eye_contact" title="wikilink">eye contact</a> and anticipatory postures and are less likely to use another person's hand or body as a tool.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> Three- to five-year-old autistic children are less likely to exhibit social understanding, approach others spontaneously, imitate and respond to emotions, communicate nonverbally, and take turns with others. However, they do form <a href="Attachment_(psychology)" title="wikilink">attachments</a> to their primary caregivers.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> They display moderately less <a href="Attachment_in_children#Secure_attachment" title="wikilink">attachment security</a> than usual, although this feature disappears in children with higher mental development or less severe ASD.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> Older children and adults with ASD perform worse on tests of face and emotion recognition.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a></p>
<p>Contrary to common belief, autistic children do not prefer to be alone. Making and maintaining friendships often proves to be difficult for those with autism. For them, the quality of friendships, not the number of friends, predicts how lonely they are.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a></p>
<p>There are many anecdotal reports, but few systematic studies, of aggression and violence in individuals with ASD. The limited data suggest that in children with mental retardation, autism is associated with aggression, destruction of property, and tantrums. Dominick <em>et al.</em> interviewed the parents of 67 children with ASD and reported that about two-thirds of the children had periods of severe tantrums and about one third had a history of aggression, with tantrums significantly more common than in children with a history of language impairment.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="communication">Communication</h3>
<p>About a third to a half of individuals with autism do not develop enough natural speech to meet their daily communication needs.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> Differences in communication may be present from the first year of life, and may include delayed onset of <a href="babbling" class="uri" title="wikilink">babbling</a>, unusual gestures, diminished responsiveness, and the desynchronization of vocal patterns with the caregiver. In the second and third years, autistic children have less frequent and less diverse babbling, consonants, words, and word combinations; their gestures are less often integrated with words. Autistic children are less likely to make requests or share experiences, and are more likely to simply repeat others' words (<a href="echolalia" class="uri" title="wikilink">echolalia</a>)<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a><a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> or <a href="Pronoun_reversal" title="wikilink">reverse pronouns</a>.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> Autistic children may have difficulty with imaginative play and with developing symbols into language.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a><a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> They are more likely to have problems understanding pointing; for example, they may look at a pointing hand instead of the pointed-at object.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a><a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a></p>
<p>In a pair of studies, high-functioning autistic children aged 8&lt;U+2013&gt;15 performed equally well, and adults better than individually matched controls at basic language tasks involving vocabulary and spelling. Both autistic groups performed worse than controls at complex language tasks such as figurative language, comprehension and inference. As people are often sized up initially from their basic language skills, these studies suggest that people speaking to autistic individuals are more likely to overestimate what their audience comprehends.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="repetitive-behavior">Repetitive behavior</h3>
<p><img src="Autistic-sweetiepie-boy-with-ducksinarow.jpg" title="fig:A young boy with autism, and the precise line of toys he made" alt="A young boy with autism, and the precise line of toys he made" /> Autistic individuals display many forms of repetitive or restricted behavior, which the Repetitive Behavior Scale-Revised (RBS-R) categorizes as follows.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="Stereotypy_(psychiatry)" title="wikilink">Stereotypy</a></strong> is apparently purposeless movement, such as hand flapping, head rolling, body rocking, or spinning a plate.</li>
<li><strong><a href="OCD" title="wikilink">Compulsive behavior</a></strong> is intended and appears to follow rules, such as arranging objects in a certain way.</li>
<li><strong>Sameness</strong> is resistance to change; for example, insisting that the furniture not be moved or refusing to be interrupted.</li>
<li><strong><a href="Ritual#Psychology" title="wikilink">Ritualistic behavior</a></strong> involves the performance of daily activities the same way each time, such as an unvarying menu or dressing ritual.</li>
<li><strong>Restricted behavior</strong> is limited in focus, interest, or activity, such as preoccupation with a single television program.</li>
<li><strong><a href="Self-injury" class="uri" title="wikilink">Self-injury</a></strong> includes movements that injure or can injure the person, such as biting oneself. Dominick <em>et al.</em> reported that self-injury at some point affected about 30% of children with ASD.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a></li>
</ul>
<p>No single repetitive behavior seems to be specific to autism, but only autism appears to have an elevated pattern of occurrence and severity of these behaviors.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="other-symptoms">Other symptoms</h3>
<p>Autistic individuals may have symptoms that are independent of the diagnosis, but that can affect the individual or the family.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> A small fraction of individuals with ASD show unusual abilities, ranging from splinter skills such as the memorization of trivia to the extraordinarily rare talents of prodigious <a href="autistic_savant" title="wikilink">autistic savants</a>.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a></p>
<p>Unusual responses to <a href="Stimulus_(physiology)" title="wikilink">sensory stimuli</a> are more common and prominent in autistic children, although there is no good evidence that sensory symptoms differentiate autism from other developmental disorders.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> The responses may be more common in children: a pair of studies found that autistic children had impaired <a href="Tactition" title="wikilink">tactile perception</a> while autistic adults did not. The same two studies also found that autistic individuals had more problems with complex memory and reasoning tasks such as <a href="Twenty_Questions" title="wikilink">Twenty Questions</a>; these problems were somewhat more marked among adults.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> Several studies have reported associated motor problems that include <a href="poor_muscle_tone" title="wikilink">poor muscle tone</a>, <a href="Apraxia" title="wikilink">poor motor planning</a>, and <a href="toe_walking" title="wikilink">toe walking</a>; ASD is not associated with severe motor disturbances.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a></p>
<p>Atypical eating behavior occurs in about three-quarters of children with ASD, to the extent that it was formerly a diagnostic indicator. Selectivity is the most common problem, although eating rituals and food refusal also occur;<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> this does not appear to result in <a href="malnutrition" class="uri" title="wikilink">malnutrition</a>. Some children with autism also have <a href="gastrointestinal" class="uri" title="wikilink">gastrointestinal</a> (GI) symptoms, but there is a lack of published rigorous data to support the theory that autistic children have more or different GI symptoms than usual.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a></p>
<p><a href="Sleep" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sleep</a> problems are known to be more common in children with developmental disabilities, and there is some evidence that children with ASD are more likely to have even more sleep problems than those with other developmental disabilities; autistic children may experience problems including difficulty in falling asleep, frequent nocturnal <a href="Wakefulness" title="wikilink">awakenings</a>, and early morning awakenings. Dominick <em>et al.</em> found that about two-thirds of children with ASD had a history of sleep problems.<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="causes">Causes</h2>

<p>Although many genetic and environmental causes of autism have been proposed, its <a href="Etiology" title="wikilink">theory of causation</a> is still incomplete.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a> Some researchers argue this is because autism is not a single disorder, but rather a triad of core aspects (social impairment, communication difficulties, and repetitive behaviors) that have distinct causes but often co-occur.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a></p>
<p>Genetic factors are the most significant cause for autism spectrum disorders. Early studies of twins estimated <a href="heritability" class="uri" title="wikilink">heritability</a> to be more than 90%; in other words, that genetics explains more than 90% of autism cases.<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a> This may be an overestimate; new twin data and models with structural genetic variation are needed.<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a> When only one identical twin is autistic, the other often has learning or social disabilities. For adult siblings, the risk of having one or more features of the broader autism phenotype might be as high as 30%,<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a> much higher than the risk in controls.<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a></p>
<p>The <a href="Heritability_of_autism" title="wikilink">genetics of autism</a> is complex.<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a> <a href="Linkage_analysis" title="wikilink">Linkage analysis</a> has been inconclusive; many <a href="Genetic_association" title="wikilink">association analyses</a> have had inadequate power.<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a> For each autistic individual, <a href="mutation" title="wikilink">mutations</a> in more than one gene may be implicated. Mutations in different sets of genes may be involved in different autistic individuals. There may be significant interactions among mutations in several genes, or between the environment and mutated genes. By identifying genetic markers inherited with autism in family studies, numerous candidate genes have been located, most of which encode proteins involved in <a href="neural_development" title="wikilink">neural development</a> and function.<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a> However, for most of the candidate genes, the actual mutations that increase the risk for autism have not been identified. Typically, autism cannot be traced to a <a href="Mendelian" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mendelian</a> (single-gene) mutation or to a single <a href="chromosome_abnormality" title="wikilink">chromosome abnormality</a> such as <a href="fragile_X_syndrome" title="wikilink">fragile X syndrome</a> or <a href="22q13_deletion_syndrome" title="wikilink">22q13 deletion syndrome</a>.<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a><a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a></p>
<p><img src="Single_Chromosome_Mutations.png" title="fig:Deletion (1), duplication (2) and inversion (3) are all chromosome abnormalities that have been implicated in autism." alt="Deletion (1), duplication (2) and inversion (3) are all chromosome abnormalities that have been implicated in autism." /> The large number of autistic individuals with unaffected family members may result from <a href="copy_number_variation" title="wikilink">copy number variations</a> (CNVs)&lt;U+2014&gt;spontaneous alterations in the genetic material during <a href="meiosis" class="uri" title="wikilink">meiosis</a> that <a href="Deletion_(genetics)" title="wikilink">delete</a> or <a href="gene_duplication" title="wikilink">duplicate</a> genetic material. Sporadic (non-inherited) cases have been examined to identify candidate <a href="Locus_(genetics)" title="wikilink">genetic loci</a> involved in autism. Using <a href="array_comparative_genomic_hybridization" title="wikilink">array comparative genomic hybridization</a> (array CGH), a technique for detecting CNVs, one study found them in 10% of families with one affected child.<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a> Some of the altered loci had been identified in previous studies of inherited autism; many were unique to the sporadic cases examined in this study. Hence, a substantial fraction of autism may be highly heritable but not inherited: that is, the mutation that causes the autism is not present in the parental genome. Although the fraction of autism traceable to a genetic cause may grow to 30&lt;U+2013&gt;40% as the resolution of array CGH improves,<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a> several results in this area have been described incautiously, possibly misleading the public into thinking that a large proportion of autism is caused by CNVs and is detectable via array CGH, or that detecting CNVs is tantamount to a genetic diagnosis.<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a> The Autism Genome Project database contains <a href="genetic_linkage" title="wikilink">genetic linkage</a> and CNV data that connect autism to genetic <a href="loci" class="uri" title="wikilink">loci</a> and suggest that every human <a href="chromosome" class="uri" title="wikilink">chromosome</a> may be involved.<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a></p>
<p><a href="Teratogen" title="wikilink">Teratogens</a> (agents that cause <a href="birth_defect" title="wikilink">birth defects</a>) related to the risk of autism include exposure of the embryo to <a href="thalidomide" class="uri" title="wikilink">thalidomide</a>, <a href="valproic_acid" title="wikilink">valproic acid</a>, or <a href="misoprostol" class="uri" title="wikilink">misoprostol</a>, or to <a href="rubella" class="uri" title="wikilink">rubella</a> infection in the mother.

<p>There is overwhelming scientific evidence showing no causal association between the <a href="MMR_vaccine_controversy" title="wikilink">measles-mumps-rubella vaccine and autism</a>, and there is no convincing evidence that the vaccine preservative <a href="Thiomersal_controversy" title="wikilink">thiomersal helps cause autism</a>. However, parents may first become aware of autistic symptoms in their child around the time of a routine vaccination, and parental concern has led to a decreasing uptake of <a href="childhood_immunizations" title="wikilink">childhood immunizations</a> and the increasing likelihood of <a href="Measles#Public_health" title="wikilink">measles outbreaks</a>,<a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a><a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a> such as the measles cases in Britain during summer 2007.<a href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a></p>

<h2 id="mechanism">Mechanism</h2>
<p>Despite extensive investigation, how autism occurs is not well understood. Its mechanism can be divided into two areas: the <a href="pathophysiology" class="uri" title="wikilink">pathophysiology</a> of brain structures and processes associated with autism, and the <a href="neuropsychological" class="uri" title="wikilink">neuropsychological</a> linkages between brain structures and behaviors.<a href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="pathophysiology">Pathophysiology</h3>
<p><img src="Autismbrain.jpg" title="fig:Autism affects many parts of the brain." alt="Autism affects many parts of the brain." /> Autism appears to result from developmental factors that affect many or all functional brain systems, as opposed to localized physical damage.<a href="#fn72" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref72"><sup>72</sup></a> <a href="Neuroanatomy" title="wikilink">Neuroanatomical</a> studies and the associations with teratogens strongly suggest that autism's mechanism includes alteration of brain development soon after conception.<a href="#fn73" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref73"><sup>73</sup></a> Many major structures of the <a href="human_brain" title="wikilink">human brain</a> have been implicated.

<p>Interactions between the <a href="immune_system" title="wikilink">immune system</a> and the nervous system begin early during <a href="embryogenesis" class="uri" title="wikilink">embryogenesis</a>, and successful neurodevelopment depends on a balanced immune response. Several symptoms consistent with a poorly regulated immune response have been reported in autistic children. It is possible that aberrant immune activity during critical periods of neurodevelopment is part of the mechanism of some forms of ASD.<a href="#fn76" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref76"><sup>76</sup></a> Given the lack of data in this area, it is still hard to draw conclusions about the role of immune factors in autism.<a href="#fn77" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref77"><sup>77</sup></a></p>
<p>Several <a href="neurotransmitter" class="uri" title="wikilink">neurotransmitter</a> abnormalities have been detected in autism, notably increased blood levels of <a href="serotonin" class="uri" title="wikilink">serotonin</a>. Whether these lead to structural or behavioral abnormalities is unclear.<a href="#fn78" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref78"><sup>78</sup></a></p>
<p>The <a href="Mirror_neuron" title="wikilink">mirror neuron system</a> (MNS) theory of autism hypothesizes that distortion in the development of the MNS interferes with imitation and leads to autism's core features of social impairment and communication difficulties. The MNS operates when an animal performs an action or observes another animal of the same species perform the same action. The MNS may contribute to an individual's understanding of other people by enabling the modeling of their behavior via embodied simulation of their actions, intentions, and emotions.<ref>MNS and autism:</p>
<ul>
<li></li>
<li><p></ref> Several studies have tested this hypothesis by demonstrating structural abnormalities in MNS regions of individuals with ASD, delay in the activation in the core circuit for imitation in individuals with Asperger's, and a correlation between reduced MNS activity and severity of the syndrome in children with ASD.<a href="#fn79" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref79"><sup>79</sup></a></p></li>

<h3 id="neuropsychology">Neuropsychology</h3>
<p>Two major categories of <a href="cognitive" class="uri" title="wikilink">cognitive</a> theories have been proposed about the links between autistic brains and behavior.</p>
<p>The first category focuses on deficits in social cognition. Hyper-systemizing hypothesizes that autistic individuals can systematize&lt;U+2014&gt;that is, they can develop internal rules of operation to handle internal events&lt;U+2014&gt;but are less effective at <a href="Empathy" title="wikilink">empathizing</a> by handling events generated by other agents.<a href="#fn84" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref84"><sup>84</sup></a> It extends the extreme male brain theory, which hypothesizes that autism is an extreme case of the male brain, defined psychometrically as individuals in whom <a href="EQ_SQ_Theory" title="wikilink">systemizing is better than empathizing</a>.<a href="#fn85" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref85"><sup>85</sup></a> This in turn is related to the earlier <a href="theory_of_mind" title="wikilink">theory of mind</a>, which hypothesizes that autistic behavior arises from an inability to ascribe mental states to oneself and others. The theory of mind is supported by autistic children's atypical responses to the <a href="Sally-Anne_test" title="wikilink">Sally-Anne test</a> for reasoning about others' motivations,<a href="#fn86" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref86"><sup>86</sup></a> and is mapped well from the mirror neuron system theory of autism.<a href="#fn87" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref87"><sup>87</sup></a></p>
<p>The second category focuses on nonsocial or general processing. <a href="Executive_dysfunction" title="wikilink">Executive dysfunction</a> hypothesizes that autistic behavior results in part from deficits in flexibility, planning, and other forms of <a href="executive_function" title="wikilink">executive function</a>. A strength of the theory is predicting stereotyped behavior and narrow interests;<a href="#fn88" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref88"><sup>88</sup></a> a weakness is that executive function deficits are not found in young autistic children.<a href="#fn89" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref89"><sup>89</sup></a> <a href="Weak_central_coherence_theory" title="wikilink">Weak central coherence theory</a> hypothesizes that a limited ability to see the big picture underlies the central disturbance in autism. One strength of this theory is predicting special talents and peaks in performance in autistic people.<a href="#fn90" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref90"><sup>90</sup></a> A related theory&lt;U+2014&gt;enhanced perceptual functioning&lt;U+2014&gt;focuses more on the superiority of locally oriented and <a href="perceptual" class="uri" title="wikilink">perceptual</a> operations in autistic individuals.<a href="#fn91" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref91"><sup>91</sup></a> These theories map well from the underconnectivity theory of autism.</p>
<p>Neither category is satisfactory on its own; social cognition theories poorly address autism's rigid and repetitive behaviors, while the nonsocial theories have difficulty explaining social impairment and communication difficulties.<a href="#fn92" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref92"><sup>92</sup></a> A combined theory based on multiple deficits may prove to be more useful.<a href="#fn93" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref93"><sup>93</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="screening">Screening</h2>
<p>Parents are usually the first to notice unusual behaviors in their child.<a href="#fn94" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref94"><sup>94</sup></a> As postponing treatment may affect long-term outcome, any of the following signs is reason to have a child evaluated by a specialist without delay:</p>
<ul>
<li>No <a href="babbling" class="uri" title="wikilink">babbling</a> by 12 months.</li>
<li>No <a href="Gesture" title="wikilink">gesturing</a> (pointing, waving goodbye, etc.) by 12 months.</li>
<li>No single words by 16 months.</li>
<li>No two-word spontaneous phrases (not including <a href="echolalia" class="uri" title="wikilink">echolalia</a>) by 24 months.</li>
<li>Any loss of any language or social skills, at any age.<a href="#fn95" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref95"><sup>95</sup></a></li>
</ul>
<p>The <a href="American_Academy_of_Pediatrics" title="wikilink">American Academy of Pediatrics</a> recommends that all children be <a href="Screening_(medicine)" title="wikilink">screened</a> for ASD at the 9-, 18-, and 30-month well-child doctor visits, using autism-specific formal screening tests.<a href="#fn96" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref96"><sup>96</sup></a> In contrast, the UK National Screening Committee recommends against screening for ASD in the general population, because screening tools have not been fully validated and interventions lack sufficient evidence for effectiveness.<a href="#fn97" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref97"><sup>97</sup></a></p>
<p>Genetic screening for autism is generally still impractical. As genetic tests are developed several ethical, legal, and social issues will emerge. Commercial availability of tests may precede adequate understanding of how to use test results, given the complexity of autism's genetics.<a href="#fn98" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref98"><sup>98</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="diagnosis">Diagnosis</h2>
<p>Autism is defined in the <a href="DSM-IV-TR" class="uri" title="wikilink">DSM-IV-TR</a> as exhibiting at least six symptoms total, including at least two symptoms of qualitative impairment in social interaction, at least one symptom of qualitative impairment in communication, and at least one symptom of restricted and repetitive behavior. Sample symptoms include lack of social or emotional reciprocity, stereotyped and repetitive use of language or idiosyncratic language, and persistent preoccupation with parts of objects. Onset must be prior to age three years, with delays or abnormal functioning in either social interaction, language as used in social communication, or symbolic or imaginative play. The disturbance must not be better accounted for by <a href="Rett_syndrome" title="wikilink">Rett syndrome</a> or <a href="childhood_disintegrative_disorder" title="wikilink">childhood disintegrative disorder</a>.<a href="#fn99" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref99"><sup>99</sup></a> <a href="ICD-10" class="uri" title="wikilink">ICD-10</a> uses essentially the same definition.<a href="#fn100" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref100"><sup>100</sup></a></p>
<p>Several diagnostic instruments are available. Two are commonly used in autism research: the <a href="Autism_Diagnostic_Interview-Revised" title="wikilink">Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised</a> (ADI-R) is a semistructured parent interview, and the <a href="Autism_Diagnostic_Observation_Schedule" title="wikilink">Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule</a> (ADOS) uses observation and interaction with the child. The Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS) is used widely in clinical environments to assess severity of autism based on observation of children.<a href="#fn101" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref101"><sup>101</sup></a></p>
<p>A <a href="pediatrician" class="uri" title="wikilink">pediatrician</a> commonly performs a preliminary investigation by taking developmental history and physically examining the child. If warranted, diagnosis and evaluations are conducted with help from ASD specialists, observing and assessing cognitive, communication, family, and other factors using standardized tools, and taking into account any associated medical conditions. A <a href="differential_diagnosis" title="wikilink">differential diagnosis</a> for ASD at this stage might also consider <a href="mental_retardation" title="wikilink">mental retardation</a>, <a href="hearing_impairment" title="wikilink">hearing impairment</a>, and a <a href="specific_language_disorder" title="wikilink">specific language disorder</a><a href="#fn102" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref102"><sup>102</sup></a> such as <a href="Landau-Kleffner_syndrome" title="wikilink">Landau-Kleffner syndrome</a>.<a href="#fn103" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref103"><sup>103</sup></a> In the UK the National Autism Plan for Children recommends at most 30 weeks from first concern to completed diagnosis and assessment, though few cases are handled that quickly in practice.<a href="#fn104" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref104"><sup>104</sup></a> ASD can sometimes be diagnosed by age 14 months,<a href="#fn105" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref105"><sup>105</sup></a> but a 2006 U.S. study found the average age of first evaluation by a qualified professional was 48 months and of formal ASD diagnosis was 61 months, reflecting an average 13-month delay, all far above recommendations.<a href="#fn106" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref106"><sup>106</sup></a></p>
<p>Underdiagnosis and overdiagnosis are problems in marginal cases, and much of the recent increase in the number of reported ASD cases is likely due to changes in diagnostic practices. The increasing popularity of drug treatment options and the expansion of benefits has given providers incentives to diagnose ASD, resulting in some overdiagnosis of children with uncertain symptoms. Conversely, the cost of screening and diagnosis and the challenge of obtaining payment can inhibit or delay diagnosis.<a href="#fn107" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref107"><sup>107</sup></a> It is particularly hard to diagnose autism among the <a href="visually_impaired" title="wikilink">visually impaired</a>, partly because some of its diagnostic criteria depend on vision, and partly because autistic symptoms overlap with those of common blindness syndromes.<a href="#fn108" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref108"><sup>108</sup></a></p>
<p>The symptoms of autism and ASD begin early in childhood but are occasionally missed. Adults may seek retrospective diagnoses to help them or their friends and family understand themselves, to help their employers make adjustments, or in some locations to claim disability living allowances or other benefits.<a href="#fn109" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref109"><sup>109</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="treatment">Treatment</h2>

<p>The goal of treatment is to manage and improve symptoms and functioning. No single treatment is best and treatment is typically tailored to the child's needs. Intensive, sustained special education programs and behavior therapy early in life can help children acquire self-care, social, and job skills;<a href="#fn110" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref110"><sup>110</sup></a><a href="#fn111" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref111"><sup>111</sup></a> claims that intervention by age 2&lt;U+2013&gt;3 years is crucial are not substantiated.<a href="#fn112" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref112"><sup>112</sup></a> Among the available approaches, <a href="applied_behavior_analysis" title="wikilink">applied behavior analysis</a> (ABA) has demonstrated <a href="efficacy" class="uri" title="wikilink">efficacy</a> in promoting social and language development and in reducing behaviors that interfere with learning and cognitive functioning;<a href="#fn113" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref113"><sup>113</sup></a> ABA focuses on teaching tasks one-on-one using the <a href="behaviorist" class="uri" title="wikilink">behaviorist</a> principles of stimulus, response and reward.<a href="#fn114" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref114"><sup>114</sup></a> Several programs are based on ABA. Some focus on discrete trial teaching; more-comprehensive ones use multiple assessment and intervention methods individually and dynamically.<a href="#fn115" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref115"><sup>115</sup></a> Cognitive therapies based on comprehensive programs in treatment centers are a common alternative: for example, <a href="Treatment_and_education_of_autistic_and_related_communication_handicapped_children" title="wikilink">TEACCH</a> focuses on structuring the physical environment and using visual supports for language development tasks.<a href="#fn116" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref116"><sup>116</sup></a> A 2005 California study found that early intensive behavior analytic treatment, a form of ABA, was substantially more effective for preschool children with autism than the mixture of methods provided in many programs,<a href="#fn117" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref117"><sup>117</sup></a> but a 2007 British study found that home-based early intensive behavioral interventions, another ABA form, was no more effective than nursery-based eclectic programs.<a href="#fn118" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref118"><sup>118</sup></a> The limited research on the effectiveness of adult residential programs shows mixed results.<a href="#fn119" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref119"><sup>119</sup></a></p>
<p>Medications are often used to treat problems associated with ASD. More than half of U.S. children diagnosed with ASD are prescribed <a href="psychoactive_drug" title="wikilink">psychoactive drugs</a> or <a href="anticonvulsant" title="wikilink">anticonvulsants</a>, with the most common drug classes being <a href="antidepressant" title="wikilink">antidepressants</a>, <a href="stimulant" title="wikilink">stimulants</a>, and <a href="antipsychotic" title="wikilink">antipsychotics</a>.<a href="#fn120" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref120"><sup>120</sup></a> In the United States, the antipsychotic <a href="risperidone" class="uri" title="wikilink">risperidone</a> is approved for treating symptomatic irritability in autistic children and adolescents.<a href="#fn121" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref121"><sup>121</sup></a> Other drugs are prescribed <a href="off-label" class="uri" title="wikilink">off-label</a>, which means they have not been approved for treating ASD.

</ul>
<p>The risk of autism is associated with several <a href="prenatal" class="uri" title="wikilink">prenatal</a> and <a href="perinatal" class="uri" title="wikilink">perinatal</a> risk factors. A 2007 review of <a href="risk_factors" title="wikilink">risk factors</a> found associated parental characteristics that included advanced maternal age, advanced paternal age, and maternal place of birth outside Europe or North America, and also found associated <a href="obstetric" class="uri" title="wikilink">obstetric</a> conditions that included <a href="low_birth_weight" title="wikilink">low birth weight</a> and <a href="gestation" class="uri" title="wikilink">gestation</a> duration, and <a href="Hypoxia_(medical)" title="wikilink">hypoxia</a> during <a href="childbirth" class="uri" title="wikilink">childbirth</a>.<a href="#fn148" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref148"><sup>148</sup></a></p>

<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<p>A few examples of autistic symptoms and treatments were described long before autism was named. The <em><a href="Table_Talk" title="wikilink">Table Talk</a></em> of <a href="Martin_Luther" title="wikilink">Martin Luther</a> contains a story of a 12-year-old boy who may have been severely autistic.<a href="#fn160" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref160"><sup>160</sup></a> According to Luther's notetaker <a href="Johannes_Mathesius" title="wikilink">Mathesius</a>, Luther thought the boy was a soulless mass of flesh <a href="demonic_possession" title="wikilink">possessed by the devil</a>, and suggested that he be suffocated.<a href="#fn161" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref161"><sup>161</sup></a> <a href="Victor_of_Aveyron" title="wikilink">Victor of Aveyron</a>, a <a href="feral_child" title="wikilink">feral child</a> caught in 1798, showed several signs of autism; the medical student <a href="Jean_Itard" title="wikilink">Jean Itard</a> treated him with a behavioral program designed to help him form social attachments and to induce speech via imitation.<a href="#fn162" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref162"><sup>162</sup></a></p>
<p>The <a href="New_Latin" title="wikilink">New Latin</a> word <em>autismus</em> (English translation <em>autism</em>) was coined by the <a href="Swiss" class="uri" title="wikilink">Swiss</a> psychiatrist <a href="Eugen_Bleuler" title="wikilink">Eugen Bleuler</a> in 1910 as he was defining symptoms of <a href="schizophrenia" class="uri" title="wikilink">schizophrenia</a>. He derived it from the <a href="Greek_language" title="wikilink">Greek</a> word <em>autos</em> (&lt;U+03B1&gt;&lt;U+1F50&gt;&lt;U+03C4&gt;&lt;U+03CC&gt;&lt;U+03C2&gt;, meaning <em>self</em>), and used it to mean morbid self-admiration, referring to &quot;autistic withdrawal of the patient to his fantasies, against which any influence from outside becomes an intolerable disturbance.&quot;<a href="#fn163" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref163"><sup>163</sup></a></p>
<p><img src="kanner_kl2.jpg" title="fig:Leo Kanner introduced the label early infantile autism in 1943." alt="Leo Kanner introduced the label early infantile autism in 1943." /> The word <em>autism</em> took its modern sense in 1943 when <a href="Leo_Kanner" title="wikilink">Leo Kanner</a> of the <a href="Johns_Hopkins_Hospital" title="wikilink">Johns Hopkins Hospital</a> reported 11 children with striking behavioral similarities and introduced the label <em>early infantile autism</em>.<a href="#fn164" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref164"><sup>164</sup></a> He suggested <em>autism</em> to describe the children's lack of interest in other people. Almost all the characteristics described in Kanner's first paper on the subject, notably &quot;autistic aloneness&quot; and &quot;insistence on sameness&quot;, are still regarded as typical of the autistic spectrum of disorders.<a href="#fn165" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref165"><sup>165</sup></a> About the same time, the <a href="Vienna" title="wikilink">Viennese</a> pediatrician <a href="Hans_Asperger" title="wikilink">Hans Asperger</a> described a similar form of ASD now known as <a href="Asperger&#39;s" class="uri" title="wikilink">Asperger's</a>, though for various reasons it was not widely recognized as a separate syndrome until 1981.<a href="#fn166" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref166"><sup>166</sup></a></p>
<p>Kanner's reuse of <em>autism</em> led to decades of confused terminology like &quot;infantile schizophrenia&quot;, and child psychiatry's focus on maternal deprivation during the mid-1900s led to misconceptions of autism as an infant's response to &quot;<a href="refrigerator_mother" title="wikilink">refrigerator mothers</a>&quot;. Starting in the late 1960s autism was established as a separate syndrome by demonstrating that it is lifelong, distinguishing it from mental retardation and schizophrenia and from other developmental disorders, and demonstrating the benefits of involving parents in active programs of therapy.<a href="#fn167" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref167"><sup>167</sup></a> As late as the mid-1970s there was little evidence of a genetic role in autism; now it is thought to be one of the most heritable of all psychiatric conditions.<a href="#fn168" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref168"><sup>168</sup></a> The rise of parent organizations and the <a href="Social_stigma" title="wikilink">destigmatization</a> of childhood ASD have deeply affected how we view ASD, its boundaries, and its treatments.<a href="#fn169" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref169"><sup>169</sup></a> The <a href="Internet" class="uri" title="wikilink">Internet</a> has helped autistic individuals bypass nonverbal cues and emotional sharing that they find so hard to deal with, and has given them a way to form online communities and work remotely.<a href="#fn170" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref170"><sup>170</sup></a> <a href="Sociological_and_cultural_aspects_of_autism" title="wikilink">Sociological and cultural aspects of autism</a> have developed: some in the community seek a cure, while others believe that autism is simply another way of being.<a href="#fn171" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref171"><sup>171</sup></a><a href="#fn172" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref172"><sup>172</sup></a></p>
