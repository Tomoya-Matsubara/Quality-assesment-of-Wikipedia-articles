<p>The <em><strong>'Party of the Guatemalan Revolution</strong></em>' (Partido de la Revolucion Guatemalteca), PRG. PRG was formed in June 1952 to unite non-Communist parties which were supporting the administration <a href="Jacobo_Arbenz_Guzm&lt;U+00E1&gt;n" title="wikilink">Jacobo Arbenz Guzm&lt;U+00E1&gt;n</a> (FPL, <a href="National_Renovation_Party" title="wikilink">National Renovation Party</a>, <a href="Revolutionary_Action_Party" title="wikilink">Revolutionary Action Party</a>, <a href="Socialist_Party" title="wikilink">Socialist Party</a>). The Communists <a href="Guatemalan_Labor_Party" title="wikilink">Guatemalan Labor Party</a> were very much opposed to the formation of the PRG, fearing that it would undermine their influence in the government. Later PAR and PRN withdrew. Although the PRG continued in existence until the overthrow of the President Arbenz, it had failed to maintain its original purpose of opposing Communist efforts to gain a predominant voice in the <a href="Jacobo_Arbenz_Guzm&lt;U+00E1&gt;n" title="wikilink">Arbenz Guzman's</a> government. It disbanded after the coup d'&lt;U+00E9&gt;tat of 1954.</p>
