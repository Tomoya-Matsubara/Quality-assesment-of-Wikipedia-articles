<p>The <strong>Manhattan Project</strong> was a research and development project that produced the first <a href="atomic_bomb" title="wikilink">atomic bombs</a> during <a href="World_War_II" title="wikilink">World War II</a>. It was led by the United States with the support of the United Kingdom and Canada. From 1942 to 1946, the project was under the direction of <a href="Major_general_(United_States)" title="wikilink">Major General</a> <a href="Leslie_Groves" title="wikilink">Leslie Groves</a> of the <a href="United_States_Army_Corps_of_Engineers" title="wikilink">U.S. Army Corps of Engineers</a>. The Army component of the project was designated the <strong>Manhattan District</strong>; &quot;Manhattan&quot; gradually superseded the official codename, <strong>Development of Substitute Materials</strong>, for the entire project. Along the way, the project absorbed its earlier British counterpart, <a href="Tube_Alloys" title="wikilink">Tube Alloys</a>. The Manhattan Project began modestly in 1939, but grew to employ more than 130,000 people and cost nearly US$2 billion (about $ in  dollars). Over 90% of the cost was for building factories and producing the <a href="fissionable_material" title="wikilink">fissionable materials</a>, with less than 10% for development and production of the weapons. Research and production took place at more than 30 sites across the United States, the United Kingdom and Canada.</p>
<p>Two types of atomic bomb were developed during the war. A relatively simple <a href="gun-type_fission_weapon" title="wikilink">gun-type fission weapon</a> was made using <a href="uranium-235" class="uri" title="wikilink">uranium-235</a>, an <a href="isotope" class="uri" title="wikilink">isotope</a> that makes up only 0.7 percent of natural uranium. Since it is chemically identical to the most common isotope, <a href="uranium-238" class="uri" title="wikilink">uranium-238</a>, and has almost the same mass, it proved difficult to separate. Three methods were employed for <a href="uranium_enrichment" title="wikilink">uranium enrichment</a>: <a href="calutron" title="wikilink">electromagnetic</a>, <a href="gaseous_diffusion" title="wikilink">gaseous</a> and <a href="Thermophoresis" title="wikilink">thermal</a>. Most of this work was performed at <a href="Oak_Ridge,_Tennessee" title="wikilink">Oak Ridge, Tennessee</a>. In parallel with the work on uranium was an effort to produce <a href="plutonium" class="uri" title="wikilink">plutonium</a>. Reactors were constructed at Oak Ridge and <a href="Hanford_Site" title="wikilink">Hanford, Washington</a>, in which uranium was irradiated and <a href="Nuclear_transmutation" title="wikilink">transmuted</a> into plutonium. The plutonium was then chemically separated from the uranium. The gun-type design proved impractical to use with plutonium so a more complex implosion-type weapon was developed in a concerted design and construction effort at the project's principal research and design laboratory in <a href="Los_Alamos_National_Laboratory" title="wikilink">Los Alamos, New Mexico</a>.</p>
<p>The project was also charged with gathering intelligence on the <a href="German_nuclear_energy_project" title="wikilink">German nuclear energy project</a>. Through <a href="Operation_Alsos" title="wikilink">Operation Alsos</a>, Manhattan Project personnel served in Europe, sometimes behind enemy lines, where they gathered nuclear materials and documents, and rounded up German scientists.</p>
<p>The first nuclear device ever detonated was an implosion-type bomb at the <a href="Trinity_test" title="wikilink">Trinity test</a>, conducted at New Mexico's <a href="White_Sands_Missile_Range" title="wikilink">Alamogordo Bombing and Gunnery Range</a> on 16 July 1945. <a href="Little_Boy" title="wikilink">Little Boy</a>, a gun-type weapon, and the implosion-type <a href="Fat_Man" title="wikilink">Fat Man</a> were used in the <a href="atomic_bombings_of_Hiroshima_and_Nagasaki" title="wikilink">atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki</a>, respectively. In the immediate postwar years, the Manhattan Project conducted weapons testing at <a href="Bikini_Atoll" title="wikilink">Bikini Atoll</a> as part of <a href="Operation_Crossroads" title="wikilink">Operation Crossroads</a>, developed new weapons, promoted the development of the network of <a href="United_States_Department_of_Energy_National_Laboratories" title="wikilink">national laboratories</a>, supported medical research into <a href="radiology" class="uri" title="wikilink">radiology</a> and laid the foundations for the <a href="nuclear_navy" title="wikilink">nuclear navy</a>. It maintained control over American atomic weapons research and production until the formation of the <a href="United_States_Atomic_Energy_Commission" title="wikilink">United States Atomic Energy Commission</a> in January 1947.</p>
<p>The Manhattan Project operated under a blanket of tight security, but Soviet <a href="atomic_spies" title="wikilink">atomic spies</a> still penetrated the program.</p>

<p>In August 1939, prominent physicists <a href="Le&lt;U+00F3&gt;_Szil&lt;U+00E1&gt;rd" title="wikilink">Le&lt;U+00F3&gt; Szil&lt;U+00E1&gt;rd</a> and <a href="Eugene_Wigner" title="wikilink">Eugene Wigner</a> drafted the <a href="Einstein&lt;U+2013&gt;Szil&lt;U+00E1&gt;rd_letter" title="wikilink">Einstein&lt;U+2013&gt;Szil&lt;U+00E1&gt;rd letter</a>, which warned of the potential development of &quot;extremely powerful bombs of a new type&quot;.

Briggs held a meeting on 21 October 1939, which was attended by Szil&lt;U+00E1&gt;rd, Wigner and <a href="Edward_Teller" title="wikilink">Edward Teller</a>. The committee reported back to Roosevelt in November that uranium &quot;would provide a possible source of bombs with a destructiveness vastly greater than anything now known.&quot;<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>Briggs proposed that the <a href="National_Defense_Research_Committee" title="wikilink">National Defense Research Committee</a> (NDRC) spend $167,000 on research into uranium, particularly the <a href="uranium-235" class="uri" title="wikilink">uranium-235</a> isotope, and the recently discovered <a href="plutonium" class="uri" title="wikilink">plutonium</a>.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> On 28 June 1941, Roosevelt signed Executive Order 8807, which created the <a href="Office_of_Scientific_Research_and_Development" title="wikilink">Office of Scientific Research and Development</a> (OSRD),<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> with <a href="Vannevar_Bush" title="wikilink">Vannevar Bush</a> as its director.

Oliphant then set out to find out why the committee's findings were apparently being ignored. He met with the Uranium Committee, and visited <a href="Berkeley,_California" title="wikilink">Berkeley, California</a>, where he spoke persuasively to <a href="Ernest_O._Lawrence" title="wikilink">Ernest O.

<p>At a meeting between President Roosevelt, Vannevar Bush, and Vice President <a href="Henry_A._Wallace" title="wikilink">Henry A.

To control it, he created a Top Policy Group consisting of himself&lt;U+2014&gt;although he never attended a meeting&lt;U+2014&gt;Wallace, Bush, Conant, <a href="United_States_Secretary_of_War" title="wikilink">Secretary of War</a> <a href="Henry_L._Stimson" title="wikilink">Henry L.

Roosevelt chose the Army to run the project rather than the Navy, as the Army had the most experience with management of large-scale construction projects. He also agreed to coordinate the effort with that of the British, and on 11 October he sent a message to Prime Minister <a href="Winston_Churchill" title="wikilink">Winston Churchill</a>, suggesting that they correspond on atomic matters.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>

To review this work and the general theory of fission reactions, Oppenheimer convened meetings at the University of Chicago in June and at the University of California, Berkeley, in July 1942 with theoretical physicists <a href="Hans_Bethe" title="wikilink">Hans Bethe</a>, <a href="John_Van_Vleck" title="wikilink">John Van Vleck</a>, <a href="Edward_Teller" title="wikilink">Edward Teller</a>, <a href="Emil_Konopinski" title="wikilink">Emil Konopinski</a>, Robert Serber, <a href="Stan_Frankel" title="wikilink">Stan Frankel</a>, and Eldred C.

They tentatively confirmed that a fission bomb was theoretically possible.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a></p>
<p>There were still many unknown factors. The properties of pure uranium-235 were relatively unknown, as were those of plutonium, an element that had only been discovered in February 1941 by <a href="Glenn_Seaborg" title="wikilink">Glenn Seaborg</a> and his team. The scientists at the Berkeley conference envisioned creating plutonium in nuclear reactors where uranium-238 atoms absorbed neutrons that had been emitted from fissioning uranium-235 atoms. At this point no reactor had been built, and only tiny quantities of plutonium were available from <a href="cyclotron" title="wikilink">cyclotrons</a>.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> Even by December 1943, only two <a href="milligram" title="wikilink">milligrams</a> had been produced.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> There were many ways of arranging the fissile material into a critical mass. The simplest was shooting a &quot;cylindrical plug&quot; into a sphere of &quot;active material&quot; with a &quot;tamper&quot;&lt;U+2014&gt;dense material that would focus neutrons inward and keep the reacting mass together to increase its efficiency.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> They also explored designs involving <a href="spheroid" title="wikilink">spheroids</a>, a primitive form of &quot;implosion&quot; suggested by <a href="Richard_C._Tolman" title="wikilink">Richard C.

<p>Considering the idea of the fission bomb theoretically settled&lt;U+2014&gt;at least until more experimental data was available&lt;U+2014&gt;the Berkeley conference then turned in a different direction. Edward Teller pushed for discussion of a more powerful bomb: the &quot;super&quot;, now usually referred to as a &quot;<a href="hydrogen_bomb" title="wikilink">hydrogen bomb</a>&quot;, which would use the explosive force of a detonating fission bomb to ignite a <a href="nuclear_fusion" title="wikilink">nuclear fusion</a> reaction in <a href="deuterium" class="uri" title="wikilink">deuterium</a> and <a href="tritium" class="uri" title="wikilink">tritium</a>.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> Teller proposed scheme after scheme, but Bethe refused each one.

<p>The <a href="Chief_of_Engineers" title="wikilink">Chief of Engineers</a>, Major General <a href="Eugene_Reybold" title="wikilink">Eugene Reybold</a>, selected <a href="Colonel_(United_States)" title="wikilink">Colonel</a> James C.

Marshall created a liaison office in Washington, D.C., but established his temporary headquarters on the 18th floor of <a href="Tower_270" title="wikilink">270 Broadway</a> in New York, where he could draw on administrative support from the Corps of Engineers' <a href="North_Atlantic_Division" title="wikilink">North Atlantic Division</a>. It was close to the Manhattan office of <a href="Stone_&amp;_Webster" title="wikilink">Stone &amp; Webster</a>, the principal project contractor, and to Columbia University.

Robbins</a>, and his deputy, Colonel <a href="Leslie_Groves" title="wikilink">Leslie Groves</a>. Reybold, Somervell and Styer decided to call the project &quot;Development of Substitute Materials&quot;, but Groves felt that this would draw attention. Since engineer districts normally carried the name of the city where they were located, Marshall and Groves agreed to name the Army's component of the project the Manhattan District. This became official on 13 August, when Reybold issued the order creating the new district. Informally, it was known as the Manhattan Engineer District, or MED. Unlike other districts, it had no geographic boundaries, and Marshall had the authority of a division engineer. Development of Substitute Materials remained as the official codename of the project as a whole, but was supplanted over time by &quot;Manhattan&quot;.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a></p>

After examining several sites, the survey team selected one near <a href="Elza,_Tennessee" title="wikilink">Elza, Tennessee</a>.

<p>Marshall and Nichols began assembling the resources they would need. The first step was to obtain a high priority rating for the project.

<p>Somervell and Styer selected Groves for the post, informing him on 17 September of this decision, and that General Marshall ordered that he be promoted to brigadier general,<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a> as it was felt that the title &quot;general&quot; would hold more sway with the academic scientists working on the Manhattan Project.<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> Groves' orders placed him directly under Somervell rather than Reybold, with Colonel Marshall now answerable to Groves.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a> Groves established his headquarters in Washington, D.C., on the fifth floor of the <a href="Harry_S._Truman_Building" title="wikilink">New War Department Building</a>, where Colonel Marshall had his liaison office.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a> He assumed command of the Manhattan Project on 23 September.

<p>On 19 September, Groves went to <a href="Donald_M._Nelson" title="wikilink">Donald Nelson</a>, the chairman of the <a href="War_Production_Board" title="wikilink">War Production Board</a>, and asked for broad authority to issue a AAA rating whenever it was required. Nelson initially balked but quickly caved in when Groves threatened to go to the President.<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a> Groves promised not to use the AAA rating unless it was necessary. It soon transpired that for the routine requirements of the project the AAA rating was too high but the AA-3 rating was too low. After a long campaign, Groves finally received AA-1 authority on 1 July 1944.<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a></p>
<p>One of Groves' early problems was to find a director for Project Y, the group that would design and build the bomb. The obvious choice was one of the three laboratory heads, Urey, Lawrence or Compton, but they could not be spared. Compton recommended Oppenheimer, who was already intimately familiar with the bomb design concepts. However, Oppenheimer had little administrative experience, and, unlike Urey, Lawrence or Compton, had not won a Nobel Prize, which many scientists felt that the head of such an important laboratory should have. There were also concerns about Oppenheimer's security status, as many of his associates were communists, including his brother, <a href="Frank_Oppenheimer" title="wikilink">Frank Oppenheimer</a>; his wife, Kitty; and his girlfriend, <a href="Jean_Tatlock" title="wikilink">Jean Tatlock</a>. A long conversation on a train in October 1942 convinced Groves and Nichols that Oppenheimer thoroughly understood the issues involved in setting up a laboratory in a remote area and should be appointed as its director. Groves personally waived the security requirements and issued Oppenheimer a clearance on 20 July 1943.<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a><a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="collaboration-with-the-united-kingdom">Collaboration with the United Kingdom</h3>
<p>The British and Americans exchanged nuclear information but did not initially combine their efforts. Britain rebuffed attempts by Bush and Conant in 1941 to strengthen cooperation with its own project, codenamed <a href="Tube_Alloys" title="wikilink">Tube Alloys</a>,<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a> because it was reluctant to share its technological lead and help the United States develop its own atomic bomb. An American scientist who brought a personal letter from Roosevelt to Churchill offering to pay for all research and development in an Anglo-American project was poorly treated, and Churchill did not reply to the letter. The United States as a result decided as early as April 1942 that its offer was rejected, and that it should proceed alone.<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a> The United Kingdom did not have the manpower or resources of the United States and despite its early and promising start, Tube Alloys soon fell behind its American counterpart.<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a> On 30 July 1942, Sir <a href="John_Anderson,_1st_Viscount_Waverley" title="wikilink">John Anderson</a>, the minister responsible for Tube Alloys, advised Churchill that: &quot;We must face the fact that ... [our] pioneering work ... is a dwindling asset and that, unless we capitalise it quickly, we shall be outstripped. We now have a real contribution to make to a 'merger.' Soon we shall have little or none.&quot;<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a> That month Churchill and Roosevelt made an informal, unwritten agreement for atomic collaboration.</p>
<p>The opportunity for an equal partnership no longer existed, however, as shown in August 1942 when the British unsuccessfully demanded substantial control over the project while paying none of the costs. By 1943 the roles of the two countries had reversed from late 1941; in January Conant notified the British that they would no longer receive atomic information except in certain areas. While the British were shocked by the abrogation of the Churchill-Roosevelt agreement, head of the Canadian <a href="National_Research_Council_(Canada)" title="wikilink">National Research Council</a> C. J. Mackenzie was less surprised, writing &quot;I can't help feeling that the United Kingdom group [over]emphasizes the importance of their contribution as compared with the Americans.&quot;<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a> As Conant and Bush told the British, the order came &quot;from the top&quot;. The British bargaining position had worsened; the American scientists had decided that the United States no longer needed outside help, and they and others on the bomb policy committee wanted to prevent Britain from being able to build a postwar atomic weapon. The committee supported, and Roosevelt agreed to, restricting the flow of information to what Britain could use during the war&lt;U+2014&gt;especially not bomb design&lt;U+2014&gt;even if doing so slowed down the American project. By early 1943 the British stopped sending research and scientists to America, and as a result the Americans stopped all information sharing. The British considered ending the supply of Canadian uranium and heavy water to force the Americans to again share, but Canada needed American supplies to produce them.<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a> They investigated the possibility of an independent nuclear program, but determined that it could not be ready in time to affect the outcome of the <a href="European_Theatre_of_World_War_II" title="wikilink">war in Europe</a>.<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a></p>
<p>By March 1943 Conant decided that British help would benefit some areas of the project. <a href="James_Chadwick" title="wikilink">James Chadwick</a> and one or two other British scientists were important enough that the bomb design team at Los Alamos needed them, despite the risk of revealing weapon design secrets.<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a> In August 1943 Churchill and Roosevelt negotiated the <a href="Quebec_Agreement" title="wikilink">Quebec Agreement</a>, which resulted in a resumption of cooperation<a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a> between scientists working on the same problem. Britain, however, agreed to restrictions on data on the building of large-scale production plants necessary for the bomb.<a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a> The subsequent Hyde Park Agreement in September 1944 extended this cooperation to the postwar period.<a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a> The Quebec Agreement established the <a href="Combined_Policy_Committee" title="wikilink">Combined Policy Committee</a> to coordinate the efforts of the United States, United Kingdom and Canada. Stimson, Bush and Conant served as the American members of the Combined Policy Committee, Field Marshal Sir <a href="John_Dill" title="wikilink">John Dill</a> and Colonel <a href="John_Jestyn_Llewellin,_1st_Baron_Llewellin" title="wikilink">J. J. Llewellin</a> were the British members, and <a href="C._D._Howe" title="wikilink">C. D. Howe</a> was the Canadian member.<a href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a> Llewellin returned to the United Kingdom at the end of 1943 and was replaced on the committee by Sir <a href="Ronald_Ian_Campbell" title="wikilink">Ronald Ian Campbell</a>, who in turn was replaced by the British Ambassador to the United States, <a href="Lord_Halifax" title="wikilink">Lord Halifax</a>, in early 1945. Sir John Dill died in Washington, D.C., in November 1944 and was replaced both as Chief of the <a href="British_Joint_Staff_Mission" title="wikilink">British Joint Staff Mission</a> and as a member of the Combined Policy Committee by Field Marshal Sir <a href="Henry_Maitland_Wilson" title="wikilink">Henry Maitland Wilson</a>.<a href="#fn67" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a></p>
<p>When cooperation resumed after the Quebec agreement, the Americans' progress and expenditures amazed the British. The United States had already spent more than $1 billion ($ today), while in 1943, the United Kingdom had spent about &lt;U+00A3&gt;0.5 million. Chadwick thus pressed for British involvement in the Manhattan Project to the fullest extent and abandon any hopes of a British project during the war. With Churchill's backing, he attempted to ensure that every request from Groves for assistance was honored.<a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a> The British Mission that arrived in the United States in December 1943 included <a href="Niels_Bohr" title="wikilink">Niels Bohr</a>, Otto Frisch, <a href="Klaus_Fuchs" title="wikilink">Klaus Fuchs</a>, Rudolf Peierls, and <a href="Ernest_William_Titterton" title="wikilink">Ernest Titterton</a>.<a href="#fn69" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref69"><sup>69</sup></a> More scientists arrived in early 1944. While those assigned to gaseous diffusion left by the fall of 1944, the 35 working with Lawrence at Berkeley were assigned to existing laboratory groups and stayed until the end of the war. The 19 sent to Los Alamos also joined existing groups, primarily related to implosion and bomb assembly, but not the plutonium-related ones. Part of the Quebec Agreement specified that nuclear weapons would not be used against another country without mutual consent. In June 1945, Wilson agreed that the use of nuclear weapons against Japan would be recorded as a decision of the Combined Policy Committee.<a href="#fn70" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a></p>
<p>The Combined Policy Committee created the Combined Development Trust in June 1944, with Groves as its chairman, to procure <a href="uranium_ore" title="wikilink">uranium</a> and <a href="thorium_ore" title="wikilink">thorium ores</a> on international markets. The <a href="Belgian_Congo" title="wikilink">Belgian Congo</a> and Canada held much of the world's uranium outside Eastern Europe, and the <a href="Belgian_Government_in_Exile" title="wikilink">Belgian government in exile</a> was in London. Britain agreed to give the United States most of the Belgian ore, as it could not use most of the supply without restricted American research.<a href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a> In 1944, the Trust purchased  of uranium oxide ore from companies operating mines in the Belgian Congo. In order to avoid briefing US Secretary of the Treasury <a href="Henry_Morgenthau_Jr." title="wikilink">Henry Morgenthau Jr.</a> on the project, a special account not subject to the usual auditing and controls was used to hold Trust monies. Between 1944 and the time he resigned from the Trust in 1947, Groves deposited a total of $37.5 million into the Trust's account.<a href="#fn72" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref72"><sup>72</sup></a></p>
<p>Groves appreciated the early British atomic research and the British scientists' contributions to the Manhattan Project, but stated that the United States would have succeeded without them. Whether or not he was correct, the British wartime participation was crucial to the success of the <a href="Nuclear_weapons_and_the_United_Kingdom" title="wikilink">United Kingdom's independent nuclear weapons program</a> after the war when the <a href="McMahon_Act" title="wikilink">McMahon Act</a> of 1946 temporarily ended American nuclear cooperation.</p>

<p>By December 1942 there were concerns that even Oak Ridge was too close to a major population center (Knoxville) in the unlikely event of a major nuclear accident. Groves recruited <a href="DuPont" class="uri" title="wikilink">DuPont</a> in November 1942 to be the prime contractor for the construction of the plutonium production complex.

The federal government relocated some 1,500 residents of <a href="White_Bluffs,_Washington" title="wikilink">White Bluffs</a> and <a href="Hanford,_Washington" title="wikilink">Hanford</a>, and nearby settlements, as well as the <a href="Wanapum" class="uri" title="wikilink">Wanapum</a> and other tribes using the area. A dispute arose with farmers over compensation for crops, which had already been planted before the land was acquired. Where schedules allowed, the Army allowed the crops to be harvested, but this was not always possible.<a href="#fn109" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref109"><sup>109</sup></a> The land acquisition process dragged on and was not completed before the end of the Manhattan Project in December 1946.<a href="#fn110" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref110"><sup>110</sup></a></p>
<p>The dispute did not delay work. Although progress on the reactor design at Metallurgical Laboratory and DuPont was not sufficiently advanced to accurately predict the scope of the project, a start was made in April 1943 on facilities for an estimated 25,000 workers, half of whom were expected to live on-site. By July 1944, some 1,200 buildings had been erected and nearly 51,000 people were living in the construction camp.

<p><a href="Cominco" class="uri" title="wikilink">Cominco</a> had produced electrolytic hydrogen at <a href="Trail,_British_Columbia" title="wikilink">Trail, British Columbia</a>, since 1930. Urey suggested in 1941 that it could produce <a href="heavy_water" title="wikilink">heavy water</a>. To the existing $10 million plant consisting of 3,215 cells consuming 75 MW of hydroelectric power, secondary electrolysis cells were added to increase the <a href="deuterium" class="uri" title="wikilink">deuterium</a> concentration in the water from 2.3% to 99.8%. For this process, Hugh Taylor of Princeton developed a platinum-on-carbon <a href="catalyst" class="uri" title="wikilink">catalyst</a> for the first three stages while Urey developed a nickel-<a href="Chromium(III)_oxide" title="wikilink">chromia</a> one for the fourth stage tower. The final cost was $2.8 million. The Canadian Government did not officially learn of the project until August 1942. Trail's heavy water production started in January 1944 and continued until 1956. Heavy water from Trail was used for <a href="Chicago_Pile_3" title="wikilink">Chicago Pile 3</a>, the first reactor using heavy water and natural uranium, which went critical on 15 May 1944.<a href="#fn115" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref115"><sup>115</sup></a></p>

<h3 id="heavy-water-sites">Heavy water sites</h3>
<p>Although DuPont's preferred designs for the nuclear reactors were helium cooled and used graphite as a moderator, DuPont still expressed an interest in using heavy water as a backup, in case the graphite reactor design proved infeasible for some reason. For this purpose, it was estimated that  of heavy water would be required per month. As the plant at Trail, which was then under construction, could produce  per month, additional capacity was required. Groves therefore authorized DuPont to establish heavy water facilities at the Morgantown Ordnance Works, near <a href="Morgantown,_West_Virginia" title="wikilink">Morgantown, West Virginia</a>; at the <a href="Newport_Chemical_Depot" title="wikilink">Wabash River Ordnance Works</a>, near <a href="Dana,_Indiana" title="wikilink">Dana</a> and <a href="Newport,_Indiana" title="wikilink">Newport, Indiana</a>; and at the <a href="Alabama_Army_Ammunition_Plant" title="wikilink">Alabama Ordnance Works</a>, near <a href="Childersburg,_Alabama" title="wikilink">Childersburg</a> and <a href="Sylacauga,_Alabama" title="wikilink">Sylacauga, Alabama</a>.

<h2 id="uranium">Uranium</h2>
<h3 id="ore">Ore</h3>
<p>The key raw material for the project was uranium, which was used as fuel for the reactors, as feed that was transformed into plutonium, and, in its enriched form, in the atomic bomb itself. There were four known major deposits of uranium in 1940: in Colorado, in northern Canada, in <a href="Joachimstal" class="uri" title="wikilink">Joachimstal</a> in Czechoslovakia, and in the <a href="Belgian_Congo" title="wikilink">Belgian Congo</a>.<a href="#fn120" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref120"><sup>120</sup></a> All but Joachimstal were in allied hands. A November 1942 survey determined that sufficient quantities of uranium were available to satisfy the project's requirements.<a href="#fn121" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref121"><sup>121</sup></a> Nichols arranged with the <a href="State_Department" title="wikilink">State Department</a> for export controls to be placed on <a href="uranium_oxide" title="wikilink">uranium oxide</a> and negotiated for the purchase of  of uranium ore from the Belgian Congo that was being stored in a warehouse on <a href="Staten_Island" title="wikilink">Staten Island</a> and the remaining stocks of mined ore stored in the Congo. He negotiated with <a href="Eldorado_Mining_and_Refining" title="wikilink">Eldorado Gold Mines</a> for the purchase of ore from its mine in Port Hope, Ontario, and its shipment in 100-ton lots. The Canadian government subsequently bought up the company's stock until it acquired a controlling interest.<a href="#fn122" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref122"><sup>122</sup></a></p>
<p>While these purchases assured a sufficient supply to meet wartime needs, the American and British leaders concluded that it was in their countries' interest to gain control of as much of the world's uranium deposits as possible. The richest source of ore was the <a href="Shinkolobwe" class="uri" title="wikilink">Shinkolobwe</a> mine in the Belgian Congo, but it was flooded and closed. Nichols unsuccessfully attempted to negotiate its reopening and the sale of the entire future output to the United States with <a href="Edgar_Sengier" title="wikilink">Edgar Sengier</a>, the director of the company that owned the mine, <a href="Union_Mini&lt;U+00E8&gt;re_du_Haut_Katanga" title="wikilink">Union Mini&lt;U+00E8&gt;re du Haut Katanga</a>.<a href="#fn123" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref123"><sup>123</sup></a> The matter was then taken up by the Combined Policy Committee.

<p>Natural uranium consists of 99.3% uranium-238 and 0.7% uranium-235, but only the latter is <a href="fissile" class="uri" title="wikilink">fissile</a>.

<h4 id="centrifuges">Centrifuges</h4>
<p>The centrifuge process was regarded as the only promising separation method in April 1942.<a href="#fn131" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref131"><sup>131</sup></a> <a href="Jesse_Beams" title="wikilink">Jesse Beams</a> had developed such a process at the <a href="University_of_Virginia" title="wikilink">University of Virginia</a> during the 1930s, but had encountered technical difficulties. The process required high rotational speeds, but at certain speeds harmonic vibrations developed that threatened to tear the machinery apart. It was therefore necessary to accelerate quickly through these speeds. In 1941 he began working with <a href="uranium_hexafluoride" title="wikilink">uranium hexafluoride</a>, the only known gaseous compound of uranium, and was able to separate uranium-235. At Columbia, Urey had Cohen investigate the process, and he produced a body of mathematical theory making it possible to design a centrifugal separation unit, which Westinghouse undertook to construct.<a href="#fn132" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref132"><sup>132</sup></a></p>
<p>Scaling this up to a production plant presented a formidable technical challenge. Urey and Cohen estimated that producing a kilogram (2.2 lb) of uranium-235 per day would require up to 50,000 centrifuges with  rotors, or 10,000 centrifuges with  rotors, assuming that 4-meter rotors could be built. The prospect of keeping so many rotors operating continuously at high speed appeared daunting,<a href="#fn133" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref133"><sup>133</sup></a> and when Beams ran his experimental apparatus, he obtained only 60% of the predicted yield, indicating that more centrifuges would be required. Beams, Urey and Cohen then began work on a series of improvements which promised to increase the efficiency of the process. However, frequent failures of motors, shafts and bearings at high speeds delayed work on the pilot plant.<a href="#fn134" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref134"><sup>134</sup></a> In November 1942 the centrifuge process was abandoned by the Military Policy Committee following a recommendation by Conant, Nichols and August C.

<h4 id="electromagnetic-separation">Electromagnetic separation</h4>
<p>Electromagnetic isotope separation was developed by Lawrence at the University of California Radiation Laboratory. This method employed devices known as <a href="calutron" title="wikilink">calutrons</a>, a hybrid of the standard laboratory <a href="mass_spectrometer" title="wikilink">mass spectrometer</a> and cyclotron. The name was derived from the words &quot;California&quot;, &quot;university&quot; and &quot;cyclotron&quot;.<a href="#fn136" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref136"><sup>136</sup></a> In the electromagnetic process, a magnetic field deflected charged particles according to mass.<a href="#fn137" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref137"><sup>137</sup></a> The process was neither scientifically elegant nor industrially efficient.<a href="#fn138" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref138"><sup>138</sup></a> Compared with a gaseous diffusion plant or a nuclear reactor, an electromagnetic separation plant would consume more scarce materials, require more manpower to operate, and cost more to build.

However, silver could be substituted, in an 11:10 ratio. On 3 August 1942, Nichols met with <a href="United_States_Deputy_Secretary_of_the_Treasury" title="wikilink">Under Secretary of the Treasury</a> <a href="Daniel_W._Bell" title="wikilink">Daniel W.

<p>The  silver bars were cast into cylindrical billets and taken to <a href="Phelps_Dodge" title="wikilink">Phelps Dodge</a> in Bayway, New Jersey, where they were extruded into strips  thick,  wide and  long. These were wound onto magnetic coils by <a href="Allis-Chalmers" class="uri" title="wikilink">Allis-Chalmers</a> in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. After the war, all the machinery was dismantled and cleaned and the floorboards beneath the machinery were ripped up and burned to recover minute amounts of silver.

<p>Responsibility for the design and construction of the electromagnetic separation plant, which came to be called <a href="Y-12_National_Security_Complex" title="wikilink">Y-12</a>, was assigned to Stone &amp; Webster by the S-1 Committee in June 1942. The design called for five first stage processing units, known as Alpha racetracks, and two units for final processing, known as Beta racetracks. In September 1943 Groves authorized construction of four more racetracks, known as Alpha II. Construction began in February 1943.<a href="#fn145" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref145"><sup>145</sup></a></p>
<p>When the plant was started up for testing on schedule in October, the 14-ton vacuum tanks crept out of alignment because of the power of the magnets, and had to be fastened more securely. A more serious problem arose when the magnetic coils started shorting out. In December Groves ordered a magnet to be broken open, and handfuls of rust were found inside. Groves then ordered the racetracks to be torn down and the magnets sent back to the factory to be cleaned. A pickling plant was established on-site to clean the pipes and fittings.<a href="#fn146" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref146"><sup>146</sup></a> The second Alpha I was not operational until the end of January 1944, the first Beta and first and third Alpha I's came online in March, and the fourth Alpha I was operational in April.

They were then turned over to trained Tennessee Eastman operators who had only a high school education.

They agreed to a production race and Lawrence lost, a morale boost for the Tennessee Eastman workers and supervisors. The girls were &quot;trained like soldiers not to reason why&quot;, while &quot;the scientists could not refrain from time-consuming investigation of the cause of even minor fluctuations of the dials.&quot;<a href="#fn149" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref149"><sup>149</sup></a></p>
<p>Y-12 initially enriched the uranium-235 content to between 13% and 15%, and shipped the first few hundred grams of this to Los Alamos in March 1944. Only 1 part in 5,825 of the uranium feed emerged as final product. Much of the rest was splattered over equipment in the process. Strenuous recovery efforts helped raise production to 10% of the uranium-235 feed by January 1945. In February the Alpha racetracks began receiving slightly enriched (1.4%) feed from the new S-50 thermal diffusion plant. The next month it received enhanced (5%) feed from the K-25 gaseous diffusion plant. By April K-25 was producing uranium sufficiently enriched to feed directly into the Beta tracks.<a href="#fn150" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref150"><sup>150</sup></a></p>
<h4 id="gaseous-diffusion">Gaseous diffusion</h4>
<p>The most promising but also the most challenging method of isotope separation was gaseous diffusion. <a href="Graham&#39;s_law" title="wikilink">Graham's law</a> states that the rate of <a href="effusion" class="uri" title="wikilink">effusion</a> of a gas is inversely proportional to the square root of its <a href="molecular_mass" title="wikilink">molecular mass</a>, so in a box containing a semi-permeable membrane and a mixture of two gases, the lighter molecules will pass out of the container more rapidly than the heavier molecules. The gas leaving the container is somewhat enriched in the lighter molecules, while the residual gas is somewhat depleted. The idea was that such boxes could be formed into a cascade of pumps and membranes, with each successive stage containing a slightly more enriched mixture. Research into the process was carried out at Columbia University by a group that included Harold Urey, <a href="Karl_P._Cohen" title="wikilink">Karl P. Cohen</a> and <a href="John_R._Dunning" title="wikilink">John R. Dunning</a>.<a href="#fn151" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref151"><sup>151</sup></a></p>

W. Kellogg</a> accepted an offer to construct the plant, which was codenamed K-25. A cost plus fixed fee contract was negotiated, eventually totaling $2.5 million. A separate corporate entity called Kellex was created for the project, headed by Percival C. Keith, one of Kellogg's vice presidents.<a href="#fn153" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref153"><sup>153</sup></a> The process faced formidable technical difficulties. The highly corrosive gas <a href="uranium_hexafluoride" title="wikilink">uranium hexafluoride</a> would have to be used, as no substitute could be found, and the motors and pumps would have to be vacuum tight and enclosed in inert gas. The biggest problem was the design of the barrier, which would have to be strong, porous and resistant to corrosion by uranium hexafluoride. The best choice for this seemed to be nickel. Edward Adler and Edward Norris created a mesh barrier from electroplated nickel. A six-stage pilot plant was built at Columbia to test the process, but the Norris-Adler prototype proved to be too brittle. A rival barrier was developed from powdered nickel by Kellex, the <a href="Bell_Telephone_Laboratories" title="wikilink">Bell Telephone Laboratories</a> and the <a href="Bakelite" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bakelite</a> Corporation. In January 1944, Groves ordered the Kellex barrier into production.<a href="#fn154" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref154"><sup>154</sup></a><a href="#fn155" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref155"><sup>155</sup></a></p>
<p>Kellex's design for K-25 called for a four-story  long U-shaped structure containing 54 contiguous buildings. These were divided into nine sections. Within these were cells of six stages. The cells could be operated independently, or consecutively within a section. Similarly, the sections could be operated separately or as part of a single cascade. A survey party began construction by marking out the  site in May 1943. Work on the main building began in October 1943, and the six-stage pilot plant was ready for operation on 17 April 1944. In 1945 Groves canceled the upper stages of the plant, directing Kellex to instead design and build a 540-stage side feed unit, which became known as K-27. Kellex transferred the last unit to the operating contractor, <a href="Union_Carbide" title="wikilink">Union Carbide and Carbon</a>, on 11 September 1945. The total cost, including the K-27 plant completed after the war, came to $480 million.<a href="#fn156" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref156"><sup>156</sup></a></p>
<p>The production plant commenced operation in February 1945, and as cascade after cascade came online, the quality of the product increased. By April 1945, K-25 had attained a 1.1% enrichment and the output of the S-50 thermal diffusion plant began being used as feed. Some product produced the next month reached nearly 7% enrichment. In August, the last of the 2,892 stages commenced operation. K-25 and K-27 achieved their full potential in the early postwar period, when they eclipsed the other production plants and became the prototypes for a new generation of plants.<a href="#fn157" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref157"><sup>157</sup></a></p>
<h4 id="thermal-diffusion">Thermal diffusion</h4>

<p>The thermal diffusion process was based on <a href="Sydney_Chapman_(mathematician)" title="wikilink">Sydney Chapman</a> and <a href="David_Enskog" title="wikilink">David Enskog</a>'s <a href="Chapman&lt;U+2013&gt;Enskog_theory" title="wikilink">theory</a>, which explained that when a mixed gas passes through a temperature gradient, the heavier one tends to concentrate at the cold end and the lighter one at the warm end. Since hot gases tend to rise and cool ones tend to fall, this can be used as a means of isotope separation. This process was first demonstrated by H. Clusius and G. Dickel in Germany in 1938.<a href="#fn158" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref158"><sup>158</sup></a> It was developed by US Navy scientists, but was not one of the enrichment technologies initially selected for use in the Manhattan Project. This was primarily due to doubts about its technical feasibility, but the inter-service rivalry between the Army and Navy also played a part.<a href="#fn159" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref159"><sup>159</sup></a></p>
<p><img src="S50plant.jpg" title="fig:The S-50 plant is the dark building to the upper left behind the Oak Ridge powerhouse (with smoke stacks).|alt=A factory with three smoking chimneys on a river bend, viewed from above" alt="The S-50 plant is the dark building to the upper left behind the Oak Ridge powerhouse (with smoke stacks).|alt=A factory with three smoking chimneys on a river bend, viewed from above" width="300" /> The Naval Research Laboratory continued the research under Philip Abelson's direction, but there was little contact with the Manhattan Project until April 1944, when Captain <a href="William_S._Parsons" title="wikilink">William S. Parsons</a>, the naval officer who was in charge of ordnance development at Los Alamos, brought Oppenheimer news of encouraging progress in the Navy's experiments on thermal diffusion. Oppenheimer wrote to Groves suggesting that the output of a thermal diffusion plant could be fed into Y-12. Groves set up a committee consisting of <a href="Warren_K._Lewis" title="wikilink">Warren K. Lewis</a>, Eger Murphree and Richard Tolman to investigate the idea, and they estimated that a thermal diffusion plant costing $3.5 million could enrich  of uranium per week to nearly 0.9% uranium-235. Groves approved its construction on 24 June 1944.<a href="#fn160" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref160"><sup>160</sup></a></p>
<p>Groves contracted with the <a href="H._K._Ferguson_Company" title="wikilink">H. K. Ferguson Company</a> of <a href="Cleveland" class="uri" title="wikilink">Cleveland</a>, Ohio, to build the thermal diffusion plant, which was designated S-50. Groves' advisers, Karl Cohen and W. I. Thompson from <a href="Esso" title="wikilink">Standard Oil</a>,<a href="#fn161" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref161"><sup>161</sup></a> estimated that it would take six months to build. Groves gave Ferguson just four. Plans called for the installation of 2,142  diffusion columns arranged in 21 racks. Inside each column were three concentric tubes. Steam, obtained from the nearby K-25 powerhouse at a pressure of  and temperature of , flowed downward through the innermost  nickel pipe, while water at  flowed upward through the outermost iron pipe. Isotope separation occurred in the uranium hexafluoride gas between the nickel and copper pipes.<a href="#fn162" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref162"><sup>162</sup></a></p>
<p>Work commenced on 9 July 1944, and S-50 began partial operation in September. Ferguson operated the plant through a subsidiary known as Fercleve. The plant produced just  of 0.852% uranium-235 in October. Leaks limited production and forced shutdowns over the next few months, but in June 1945 it produced .<a href="#fn163" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref163"><sup>163</sup></a> By March 1945, all 21 production racks were operating. Initially the output of S-50 was fed into Y-12, but starting in March 1945 all three enrichment processes were run in series. S-50 became the first stage, enriching from 0.71% to 0.89%. This material was fed into the gaseous diffusion process in the K-25 plant, which produced a product enriched to about 23%. This was, in turn, fed into Y-12,<a href="#fn164" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref164"><sup>164</sup></a> which boosted it to about 89%, sufficient for nuclear weapons.<a href="#fn165" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref165"><sup>165</sup></a></p>

When they collided, a polonium-beryllium <a href="modulated_neutron_initiator" title="wikilink">modulated neutron initiator</a> would produce a burst of neutrons, which would initiate a chain reaction in the uranium-235.<a href="#fn167" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref167"><sup>167</sup></a> The configuration of the critical mass determined how much of the fissile material reacted in the interval between assembly and dispersal, and therefore the explosive yield of the bomb. Even a 1% fission of the material would result in a workable bomb, equal to thousands of tons of high explosive. A poor configuration, or slow assembly, would release enough energy to disperse the critical mass quickly, and the yield would be greatly reduced, equivalent to only a few tons of high explosive.<a href="#fn168" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref168"><sup>168</sup></a> The bomb's design was known to be inefficient and prone to accidental discharge.<a href="#fn169" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref169"><sup>169</sup></a></p>
<p>The development effort on the gun-type device was carried out at Los Alamos by Parsons' O Division. <a href="Lieutenant_Commander_(United_States)" title="wikilink">Lieutenant Commander</a> A.

<h2 id="plutonium">Plutonium</h2>
<p>The second line of development pursued by the Manhattan Project used the fissile element plutonium. Although small amounts of plutonium exist in nature, the best way to obtain large quantities of the element is in a nuclear reactor, in which natural uranium is bombarded by neutrons. The uranium-238 is <a href="Nuclear_transmutation" title="wikilink">transmuted</a> into <a href="uranium-239" class="uri" title="wikilink">uranium-239</a>, which rapidly decays, first into <a href="neptunium-239" class="uri" title="wikilink">neptunium-239</a> and then into <a href="plutonium-239" class="uri" title="wikilink">plutonium-239</a>.<a href="#fn173" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref173"><sup>173</sup></a> Only a small amount of the uranium-238 will be transformed, so the plutonium must be chemically separated from the remaining uranium, from any initial impurities, and from <a href="fission_products" title="wikilink">fission products</a>.<a href="#fn174" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref174"><sup>174</sup></a></p>

Intended as a <a href="pilot_plant" title="wikilink">pilot plant</a> for the larger production facilities at Hanford, it included the air-cooled <a href="X-10_Graphite_Reactor" title="wikilink">X-10 Graphite Reactor</a>, a chemical separation plant, and support facilities. Because of the subsequent decision to construct water-cooled reactors at Hanford, only the chemical separation plant operated as a true pilot.<a href="#fn175" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref175"><sup>175</sup></a> The X-10 Graphite Reactor consisted of a huge block of graphite,  long on each side, weighing around , surrounded by  of high-density concrete as a radiation shield.<a href="#fn176" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref176"><sup>176</sup></a></p>
<p>The greatest difficulty was encountered with the uranium slugs produced by Mallinckrodt and Metal Hydrides. These somehow had to be coated in aluminum to avoid corrosion and the escape of fission products into the cooling system. The Grasselli Chemical Company attempted to develop a <a href="Tinning#Hot-dipping" title="wikilink">hot dipping process</a> without success. Meanwhile <a href="Alcoa" class="uri" title="wikilink">Alcoa</a> tried canning. A new process for flux-less welding was developed, and 97% of the cans passed a standard vacuum test, but high temperature tests indicated a failure rate of more than 50%. Nonetheless, production began in June 1943. The Metallurgical Laboratory eventually developed an improved welding technique with the help of <a href="General_Electric" title="wikilink">General Electric</a>, which was incorporated into the production process in October 1943.<a href="#fn177" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref177"><sup>177</sup></a></p>

<h3 id="hanford-reactors">Hanford reactors</h3>
<p>Although an air-cooled design was chosen for the reactor at Oak Ridge to facilitate rapid construction, it was recognized that this would be impractical for the much larger production reactors. Initial designs by the Metallurgical Laboratory and DuPont used helium for cooling, before they determined that a water-cooled reactor would be simpler, cheaper and quicker to build.<a href="#fn180" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref180"><sup>180</sup></a> The design did not become available until 4 October 1943; in the meantime, Matthias concentrated on improving the Hanford site by erecting accommodations, improving the roads, building a railway switch line, and upgrading the electricity, water and telephone lines.<a href="#fn181" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref181"><sup>181</sup></a></p>

They were <a href="Pickling_(metal)" title="wikilink">pickled</a> to remove dirt and impurities, dipped in molten bronze, tin, and <a href="silumin" title="wikilink">aluminum-silicon alloy</a>, canned using hydraulic presses, and then capped using <a href="arc_welding" title="wikilink">arc welding</a> under an argon atmosphere. Finally, they were subjected to a series of tests to detect holes or faulty welds. Disappointingly, most canned slugs initially failed the tests, resulting in an output of only a handful of canned slugs per day. But steady progress was made and by June 1944 production increased to the point where it appeared that enough canned slugs would be available to start <a href="B-Reactor" title="wikilink">Reactor B</a> on schedule in August 1944.<a href="#fn182" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref182"><sup>182</sup></a></p>

Over the next few days, 838 tubes were loaded and the reactor went critical. Shortly after midnight on 27 September, the operators began to withdraw the <a href="control_rod" title="wikilink">control rods</a> to initiate production. At first all appeared well but around 03:00 the power level started to drop and by 06:30 the reactor had shut down completely.

Working with the minute quantities of plutonium available at the Metallurgical Laboratory in 1942, a team under Charles M. Cooper developed a <a href="Fluoride_selective_electrode" title="wikilink">lanthanum fluoride process</a> for separating uranium and plutonium, which was chosen for the pilot separation plant. A second separation process, the <a href="bismuth_phosphate_process" title="wikilink">bismuth phosphate process</a>, was subsequently developed by Seaborg and Stanly G. Thomson.<a href="#fn192" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref192"><sup>192</sup></a> This process worked by toggling plutonium between its +4 and +6 <a href="oxidation_state" title="wikilink">oxidation states</a> in solutions of bismuth phosphate. In the former state, the plutonium was precipitated; in the latter, it stayed in solution and the other products were precipitated.<a href="#fn193" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref193"><sup>193</sup></a></p>
<p>Greenewalt favored the bismuth phosphate process due to the corrosive nature of lanthanum fluoride, and it was selected for the Hanford separation plants.<a href="#fn194" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref194"><sup>194</sup></a> Once X-10 began producing plutonium, the pilot separation plant was put to the test.

<p>At Hanford, top priority was initially given to the installations in the 300 area. This contained buildings for testing materials, preparing uranium, and assembling and calibrating instrumentation. One of the buildings housed the canning equipment for the uranium slugs, while another contained a small test reactor. Notwithstanding the high priority allocated to it, work on the 300 area fell behind schedule due to the unique and complex nature of the 300 area facilities, and wartime shortages of labor and materials.<a href="#fn196" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref196"><sup>196</sup></a></p>
<p>Early plans called for the construction of two separation plants in each of the areas known as 200-West and 200-East. This was subsequently reduced to two, the T and U plants, in 200-West and one, the B plant, at 200-East.<a href="#fn197" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref197"><sup>197</sup></a> Each separation plant consisted of four buildings: a process cell building or &quot;canyon&quot; (known as 221), a concentration building (224), a purification building (231) and a magazine store (213).

<p>Work began on 221-T and 221-U in January 1944, with the former completed in September and the latter in December. The 221-B building followed in March 1945. Because of the high levels of radioactivity involved, all work in the separation plants had to be conducted by remote control using closed-circuit television, something unheard of in 1943. Maintenance was carried out with the aid of an overhead crane and specially designed tools. The 224 buildings were smaller because they had less material to process, and it was less radioactive. The 224-T and 224-U buildings were completed on 8 October 1944, and 224-B followed on 10 February 1945. The purification methods that were eventually used in 231-W were still unknown when construction commenced on 8 April 1944, but the plant was complete and the methods were selected by the end of the year.<a href="#fn199" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref199"><sup>199</sup></a> On 5 February 1945, Matthias hand-delivered the first shipment of  of 95%-pure plutonium nitrate to a Los Alamos courier in Los Angeles.<a href="#fn200" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref200"><sup>200</sup></a></p>

Initial research on the properties of plutonium was done using <a href="cyclotron" class="uri" title="wikilink">cyclotron</a>-generated plutonium-239, which was extremely pure, but could only be created in very small amounts. Los Alamos received the first sample of plutonium from the Clinton X-10 reactor in April 1944 and within days Emilio Segr&lt;U+00E8&gt; discovered a problem: the reactor-bred plutonium had a higher concentration of plutonium-240, resulting in up to five times the spontaneous fission rate of cyclotron plutonium.<a href="#fn201" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref201"><sup>201</sup></a> Seaborg had correctly predicted in March 1943 that some of the plutonium-239 would absorb a neutron and become plutonium-240.<a href="#fn202" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref202"><sup>202</sup></a></p>
<p>This made reactor plutonium unsuitable for use in a gun-type weapon. The plutonium-240 would start the chain reaction too quickly, causing a <a href="predetonation" class="uri" title="wikilink">predetonation</a> that would release enough energy to disperse the critical mass with a minimal amount of plutonium reacted (a <a href="Fizzle_(nuclear_test)" title="wikilink">fizzle</a>). A faster gun was suggested but found to be impractical. The possibility of separating the isotopes was considered and rejected, as plutonium-240 is even harder to separate from plutonium-239 than uranium-235 from uranium-238.<a href="#fn203" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref203"><sup>203</sup></a></p>
<p>Work on an alternative method of bomb design, known as implosion, had begun earlier at the instigation of the physicist <a href="Seth_Neddermeyer" title="wikilink">Seth Neddermeyer</a>. Implosion used explosives to crush a subcritical sphere of fissile material into a smaller and denser form. When the fissile atoms are packed closer together, the rate of neutron capture increases, and the mass becomes a critical mass. The metal needs to travel only a very short distance, so the critical mass is be assembled in much less time than it would take with the gun method.<a href="#fn204" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref204"><sup>204</sup></a> Neddermeyer's 1943 and early 1944 investigations into implosion showed promise, but also made it clear that the problem would be much more difficult from a theoretical and engineering perspective than the gun design.<a href="#fn205" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref205"><sup>205</sup></a> In September 1943, <a href="John_von_Neumann" title="wikilink">John von Neumann</a>, who had experience with <a href="shaped_charge" title="wikilink">shaped charges</a> used in armor-piercing shells, argued that not only would implosion reduce the danger of predetonation and fizzle, but would make more efficient use of the fissionable material.<a href="#fn206" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref206"><sup>206</sup></a> He proposed using a spherical configuration instead of the cylindrical one that Neddermeyer was working on.<a href="#fn207" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref207"><sup>207</sup></a></p>

The accelerated effort on an implosion design, codenamed <a href="Fat_Man" title="wikilink">Fat Man</a>, began in August 1944 when Oppenheimer implemented a sweeping reorganization of the Los Alamos laboratory to focus on implosion.<a href="#fn208" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref208"><sup>208</sup></a> Two new groups were created at Los Alamos to develop the implosion weapon, X (for explosives) Division headed by <a href="George_Kistiakowsky" title="wikilink">George Kistiakowsky</a> and G (for gadget) Division under Robert Bacher.<a href="#fn209" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref209"><sup>209</sup></a><a href="#fn210" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref210"><sup>210</sup></a> The new design that von Neumann and T (for theoretical) Division, most notably Rudolf Peierls, had devised used <a href="explosive_lens" title="wikilink">explosive lenses</a> to focus the explosion onto a spherical shape using a combination of both slow and fast high explosives.<a href="#fn211" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref211"><sup>211</sup></a></p>

The lenses were designed primarily using this series of tests.<a href="#fn216" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref216"><sup>216</sup></a> In his history of the Los Alamos project, <a href="David_Hawkins_(philosopher)" title="wikilink">David Hawkins</a> wrote: &quot;RaLa became the most important single experiment affecting the final bomb design&quot;.<a href="#fn217" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref217"><sup>217</sup></a></p>
<p>Within the explosives was the  thick aluminum pusher, which provided a smooth transition from the relatively low density explosive to the next layer, the  thick tamper of natural uranium. Its main job was to hold the critical mass together as long as possible, but it would also reflect neutrons back into the core. Some part of it might fission as well.

On top of the trolley is a large cylindrical object." width="300" /> The ultimate task of the metallurgists was to determine how to cast plutonium into a sphere. The difficulties became apparent when attempts to measure the density of plutonium gave inconsistent results. At first contamination was believed to be the cause, but it was soon determined that there were multiple <a href="allotropes_of_plutonium" title="wikilink">allotropes of plutonium</a>.<a href="#fn224" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref224"><sup>224</sup></a> The brittle &lt;U+03B1&gt; phase that exists at room temperature changes to the plastic &lt;U+03B2&gt; phase at higher temperatures.

It was found that this was stable at room temperature when alloyed with aluminum, but aluminum emits neutrons when bombarded with <a href="alpha_particles" title="wikilink">alpha particles</a>, which would exacerbate the pre-ignition problem. The metallurgists then hit upon a <a href="plutonium-gallium_alloy" title="wikilink">plutonium-gallium alloy</a>, which stabilized the &lt;U+03B4&gt; phase and could be <a href="Hot_pressing" title="wikilink">hot pressed</a> into the desired spherical shape. As plutonium was found to corrode readily, the sphere was coated with nickel.<a href="#fn225" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref225"><sup>225</sup></a></p>
<p>The work proved dangerous. By the end of the war, half the experienced chemists and metallurgists had to be removed from work with plutonium when unacceptably high levels of the element appeared in their urine.<a href="#fn226" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref226"><sup>226</sup></a> A minor fire at Los Alamos in January 1945 led to a fear that a fire in the plutonium laboratory might contaminate the whole town, and Groves authorized the construction of a new facility for plutonium chemistry and metallurgy, which became known as the DP-site.<a href="#fn227" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref227"><sup>227</sup></a> The hemispheres for the first plutonium <a href="Pit_(nuclear_weapon)" title="wikilink">pit</a> (or core) were produced and delivered on 2 July 1945.

<h3 id="trinity">Trinity</h3>

<p>Because of the complexity of an implosion-style weapon, it was decided that, despite the waste of fissile material, an initial test would be required. Groves approved the test, subject to the active material being recovered. Consideration was therefore given to a controlled <a href="Fizzle_(nuclear_test)" title="wikilink">fizzle</a>, but Oppenheimer opted instead for a full-scale <a href="nuclear_test" title="wikilink">nuclear test</a>, codenamed &quot;Trinity&quot;.<a href="#fn229" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref229"><sup>229</sup></a></p>

Bainbridge selected the <a href="Alamogordo_Bombing_Range" title="wikilink">bombing range</a> near <a href="Alamogordo_Army_Airfield" title="wikilink">Alamogordo Army Airfield</a> as the site for the test.<a href="#fn230" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref230"><sup>230</sup></a> Bainbridge worked with Captain Samuel P. Davalos on the construction of the Trinity Base Camp and its facilities, which included barracks, warehouses, workshops, an explosive magazine and a commissary.<a href="#fn231" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref231"><sup>231</sup></a></p>
<p>Groves did not relish the prospect of explaining the loss of a billion dollars worth of plutonium to a Senate committee, so a cylindrical containment vessel codenamed &quot;Jumbo&quot; was constructed to recover the active material in the event of a failure. Measuring  long and  wide, it was fabricated at great expense from  of iron and steel by <a href="Babcock_&amp;_Wilcox" title="wikilink">Babcock &amp; Wilcox</a> in Barberton, Ohio. Brought in a special railroad car to a siding in Pope, New Mexico, it was transported the last  to the test site on a trailer pulled by two tractors.<a href="#fn232" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref232"><sup>232</sup></a> By the time it arrived, however, confidence in the implosion method was high enough, and the availability of plutonium was sufficient, that Oppenheimer decided not to use it. Instead, it was placed atop a steel tower  from the weapon as a rough measure of how powerful the explosion would be. In the end, Jumbo survived, although its tower did not, adding credence to the belief that Jumbo would have successfully contained a fizzled explosion.<a href="#fn233" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref233"><sup>233</sup></a><a href="#fn234" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref234"><sup>234</sup></a></p>
<p>A pre-test explosion was conducted on 7 May 1945 to calibrate the instruments. A wooden test platform was erected  from Ground Zero and piled with  of TNT spiked with <a href="nuclear_fission_product" title="wikilink">nuclear fission products</a> in the form of an irradiated uranium slug from Hanford, which was dissolved and poured into tubing inside the explosive. This explosion was observed by Oppenheimer and Groves's new deputy commander, Brigadier General <a href="Thomas_Farrell_(general)" title="wikilink">Thomas Farrell</a>. The pre-test produced data that proved vital for the Trinity test.<a href="#fn235" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref235"><sup>235</sup></a><a href="#fn236" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref236"><sup>236</sup></a></p>
<p>For the actual test, the weapon, nicknamed &quot;the gadget&quot;, was hoisted to the top of a  steel tower, as detonation at that height would give a better indication of how the weapon would behave when dropped from a bomber. Detonation in the air maximized the energy applied directly to the target, and generated less <a href="nuclear_fallout" title="wikilink">nuclear fallout</a>. The gadget was assembled under the supervision of <a href="Norris_Bradbury" title="wikilink">Norris Bradbury</a> at the nearby <a href="McDonald_Ranch_House" title="wikilink">McDonald Ranch House</a> on 13 July, and precariously winched up the tower the following day.<a href="#fn237" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref237"><sup>237</sup></a> Observers included Bush, Chadwick, Conant, Farrell, Fermi, Groves, Lawrence, Oppenheimer and Tolman. At 05:30 on 16 July 1945 the gadget exploded with an <a href="TNT_equivalent" title="wikilink">energy equivalent</a> of around 20 kilotons of TNT, leaving a crater of <a href="Trinitite" class="uri" title="wikilink">Trinitite</a> (radioactive glass) in the desert  wide.

<p>In June 1944, the Manhattan Project employed some 129,000 workers, of whom 84,500 were construction workers, 40,500 were plant operators and 1,800 were military personnel. As construction activity fell off, the workforce declined to 100,000 a year later, but the number of military personnel increased to 5,600. Procuring the required numbers of workers, especially highly skilled workers, in competition with other vital wartime programs proved very difficult.<a href="#fn240" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref240"><sup>240</sup></a> In 1943, Groves obtained a special temporary priority for labor from the <a href="War_Manpower_Commission" title="wikilink">War Manpower Commission</a>.

Warned that disclosing the project's secrets was punishable by 10 years in prison or a $10,000 ($ today) fine, they saw enormous quantities of raw materials enter factories with nothing coming out, and monitored &quot;dials and switches while behind thick concrete walls mysterious reactions took place&quot; without knowing the purpose of their jobs.<a href="#fn250" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref250"><sup>250</sup></a><a href="#fn251" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref251"><sup>251</sup></a></p>
<p>Everyone, including top military officials, and their automobiles were searched when entering and exiting project facilities. One Oak Ridge worker stated that &quot;if you got inquisitive, you were called on the carpet within two hours by government secret agents. Usually those summoned to explain were then escorted bag and baggage to the gate and ordered to keep going.&quot; Nonetheless, despite being told that their work would help end the war and perhaps all future wars,<a href="#fn252" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref252"><sup>252</sup></a> not seeing or understanding the results of their often tedious duties&lt;U+2014&gt;or even typical side effects of factory work such as smoke from smokestacks&lt;U+2014&gt;and the war in Europe ending without the use of their work, caused serious morale problems among workers and caused many rumors to spread. One manager stated after the war:</p>

<p>Another worker told of how, working in a laundry, she every day held &quot;a special instrument&quot; to uniforms and listened for &quot;a clicking noise&quot;. She learned only after the war that she had been performing the important task of checking for radiation with a <a href="geiger_counter" title="wikilink">geiger counter</a>. To improve morale among such workers Oak Ridge created an extensive system of intramural sports leagues, including 10 baseball teams, 81 softball teams, and 26 football teams.<a href="#fn253" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref253"><sup>253</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="censorship">Censorship</h3>
<p>Voluntary censorship of atomic information began before the Manhattan Project. After the start of the European war in 1939 American scientists began avoiding publishing military-related research, and in 1940 scientific journals began asking the <a href="National_Academy_of_Sciences" title="wikilink">National Academy of Sciences</a> to clear articles. <a href="William_L._Laurence" title="wikilink">William L.

<p>The Manhattan Project operated under tight security lest its discovery induce Axis powers, especially Germany, to accelerate their own nuclear projects or undertake covert operations against the project.<a href="#fn256" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref256"><sup>256</sup></a> The government's <a href="Office_of_Censorship" title="wikilink">Office of Censorship</a>, by contrast, relied on the press to comply with a voluntary code of conduct it published, and the project at first avoided notifying the office. By early 1943 newspapers began publishing reports of large construction in Tennessee and Washington based on public records, and the office began discussing with the project how to maintain secrecy. In June the Office of Censorship asked newspapers and broadcasters to avoid discussing &quot;atom smashing, atomic energy, atomic fission, atomic splitting, or any of their equivalents. The use for military purposes of radium or radioactive materials, heavy water, high voltage discharge equipment, cyclotrons.&quot; The office also asked to avoid discussion of &quot;polonium, uranium, ytterbium, hafnium, protactinium, radium, rhenium, thorium, deuterium&quot;; only uranium was sensitive, but was listed with other elements to hide its importance.<a href="#fn257" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref257"><sup>257</sup></a></p>

The bombs used on Hiroshima and Nagasaki were like laboratory pieces; work would be required to make them simpler, safer and more reliable. Implosion methods needed to be developed for uranium in place of the wasteful gun method, and composite uranium-plutonium cores were needed now that plutonium was in short supply because of the problems with the reactors. However, uncertainty about the future of the laboratory made it hard to induce people to stay. Oppenheimer returned to his job at the University of California and Groves appointed Norris Bradbury as an interim replacement. In fact, Bradbury would remain in the post for the next 25 years.<a href="#fn319" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref319"><sup>319</sup></a> Groves attempted to combat the dissatisfaction caused by the lack of amenities with a construction program that included an improved water supply, three hundred houses, and recreation facilities.<a href="#fn320" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref320"><sup>320</sup></a></p>

<p>After the bombings at Hiroshima and Nagasaki, a number of Manhattan Project physicists founded the <em><a href="Bulletin_of_the_Atomic_Scientists" title="wikilink">Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists</a></em>, which began as an emergency action undertaken by scientists who saw urgent need for an immediate educational program about atomic weapons.<a href="#fn323" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref323"><sup>323</sup></a> In the face of the destructiveness of the new weapons and in anticipation of the <a href="nuclear_arms_race" title="wikilink">nuclear arms race</a> several project members including Bohr, Bush and Conant expressed the view that it was necessary to reach agreement on international control of nuclear research and atomic weapons.

<p>The project expenditure through 1 October 1945 was $1.845 billion, equivalent to less than nine days of wartime spending, and was $2.191 billion when the AEC assumed control on 1 January 1947. Total allocation was $2.4 billion. Over 90% of the cost was for building plants and producing the fissionable materials, and less than 10% for development and production of the weapons.<a href="#fn328" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref328"><sup>328</sup></a><a href="#fn329" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref329"><sup>329</sup></a></p>
<p>A total of four weapons (the Trinity gadget, Little Boy, Fat Man, and an unused bomb) were produced by the end of 1945, making the average cost per bomb around $500 million in 1945 dollars. By comparison, the project's total cost by the end of 1945 was about 90% of the total spent on the production of US small arms (not including ammunition) and 34% of the total spent on US tanks during the same period.<a href="#fn330" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref330"><sup>330</sup></a> {{-}}</p>
<h2 id="legacy">Legacy</h2>

<p>The political and cultural impacts of the development of nuclear weapons were profound and far-reaching. William Laurence of the <em>New York Times</em>, the first to use the phrase &quot;<a href="Atomic_Age" title="wikilink">Atomic Age</a>&quot;,<a href="#fn331" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref331"><sup>331</sup></a> became the official correspondent for the Manhattan Project in spring 1945. In 1943 and 1944 he unsuccessfully attempted to persuade the Office of Censorship to permit writing about the explosive potential of uranium, and government officials felt that he had earned the right to report on the biggest secret of the war. Laurence witnessed both the Trinity test<a href="#fn332" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref332"><sup>332</sup></a> and the bombing of Nagasaki and wrote the official press releases prepared for them. He went on to write a series of articles extolling the virtues of the new weapon. His reporting before and after the bombings helped to spur public awareness of the potential of nuclear technology and motivated its development in the United States and the Soviet Union.<a href="#fn333" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref333"><sup>333</sup></a></p>
<p>The wartime Manhattan Project left a legacy in the form of the network of <a href="United_States_Department_of_Energy_National_Laboratories" title="wikilink">national laboratories</a>: the <a href="Lawrence_Berkeley_National_Laboratory" title="wikilink">Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory</a>, <a href="Los_Alamos_National_Laboratory" title="wikilink">Los Alamos National Laboratory</a>, <a href="Oak_Ridge_National_Laboratory" title="wikilink">Oak Ridge National Laboratory</a>, <a href="Argonne_National_Laboratory" title="wikilink">Argonne National Laboratory</a> and <a href="Ames_Laboratory" title="wikilink">Ames Laboratory</a>. Two more were established by Groves soon after the war, the <a href="Brookhaven_National_Laboratory" title="wikilink">Brookhaven National Laboratory</a> at <a href="Upton,_New_York" title="wikilink">Upton, New York</a>, and the <a href="Sandia_National_Laboratories" title="wikilink">Sandia National Laboratories</a> at Albuquerque, New Mexico. Groves allocated $72 million to them for research activities in fiscal year 1946&lt;U+2013&gt;1947.<a href="#fn334" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref334"><sup>334</sup></a> They would be in the vanguard of the kind of large-scale research that <a href="Alvin_Weinberg" title="wikilink">Alvin Weinberg</a>, the director of the Oak Ridge National Laboratory, would call <a href="Big_Science" title="wikilink">Big Science</a>.<a href="#fn335" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref335"><sup>335</sup></a></p>
<p>The Naval Research Laboratory had long been interested in the prospect of using nuclear power for warship propulsion, and sought to create its own nuclear project. In May 1946, Nimitz, now <a href="Chief_of_Naval_Operations" title="wikilink">Chief of Naval Operations</a>, decided that the Navy should instead work with the Manhattan Project. A group of naval officers were assigned to Oak Ridge, the most senior of whom was Captain <a href="Hyman_G._Rickover" title="wikilink">Hyman G. Rickover</a>, who became assistant director there. They immersed themselves in the study of nuclear energy, laying the foundations for a <a href="nuclear_navy" title="wikilink">nuclear-powered navy</a>.<a href="#fn336" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref336"><sup>336</sup></a> A similar group of Air Force personnel arrived at Oak Ridge in September 1946 with the aim of developing <a href="nuclear_aircraft" title="wikilink">nuclear aircraft</a>.<a href="#fn337" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref337"><sup>337</sup></a> Their <a href="Aircraft_Nuclear_Propulsion" title="wikilink">Nuclear Energy for the Propulsion of Aircraft</a> (NEPA) project ran into formidable technical difficulties, and was ultimately cancelled.<a href="#fn338" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref338"><sup>338</sup></a></p>
<p>The ability of the new reactors to create radioactive isotopes in previously unheard-of quantities sparked a revolution in <a href="nuclear_medicine" title="wikilink">nuclear medicine</a> in the immediate postwar years. Starting in mid-1946, Oak Ridge began distributing radioisotopes to hospitals and universities. Most of the orders were for <a href="iodine-131" class="uri" title="wikilink">iodine-131</a> and <a href="phosphorus-32" class="uri" title="wikilink">phosphorus-32</a>, which were used in the diagnosis and treatment of cancer. In addition to medicine, isotopes were also used in biological, industrial and agricultural research.<a href="#fn339" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref339"><sup>339</sup></a></p>
