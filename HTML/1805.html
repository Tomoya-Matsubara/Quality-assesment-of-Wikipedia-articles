<p><strong>Louise Bryant</strong> (December 5, 1885 – January 6, 1936) was an American <a href="journalist" class="uri" title="wikilink">journalist</a> known for her sympathetic coverage of Russia and the <a href="Bolsheviks" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bolsheviks</a> during the <a href="Russian_Revolution" title="wikilink">Russian Revolution</a>. Bryant, a feminist married in 1916 to the more famous writer <a href="John_Reed_(journalist)" title="wikilink">John Reed</a>, wrote about leading Russian women such as <a href="Catherine_Breshkovsky" title="wikilink">Katherine Breshkovsky</a> and <a href="Maria_Spiridonova" title="wikilink">Maria Spiridonova</a> as well as men including <a href="Alexander_Kerensky" title="wikilink">Alexander Kerensky</a>, <a href="Vladimir_Lenin" title="wikilink">Vladimir Lenin</a>, and <a href="Leon_Trotsky" title="wikilink">Leon Trotsky</a>. Her news stories, distributed by <a href="Hearst_Corporation" title="wikilink">Hearst</a> during and after her trips to <a href="Saint_Petersburg" title="wikilink">Petrograd</a> and Moscow, appeared in newspapers across the U.S. and Canada in the years immediately following World War I. A collection of articles from her first trip was published in book form as <em>Six Red Months in Russia</em> in 1918. In 1919, she defended the revolution in testimony before the <a href="Overman_Committee" title="wikilink">Overman Committee</a>, a <a href="U.S._Senate" title="wikilink">Senate</a> subcommittee established to investigate Bolshevik influence in the United States. Later that year, she undertook a nationwide speaking tour to encourage public support of the Bolsheviks and to discourage armed U.S. intervention in Russia.</p>
<p>Bryant grew up in rural <a href="Nevada" class="uri" title="wikilink">Nevada</a> and attended the <a href="University_of_Nevada,_Reno" title="wikilink">University of Nevada</a> in Reno and the <a href="University_of_Oregon" title="wikilink">University of Oregon</a>, graduating with a degree in history in 1909. Pursuing a career in journalism, she became society editor of the <a href="Portland,_Oregon" title="wikilink">Portland, Oregon</a>, <em>Spectator</em> and <a href="freelancer" title="wikilink">freelanced</a> for <em><a href="The_Oregonian" title="wikilink">The Oregonian</a></em>. During her years in Portland (1909–15), she became active in the <a href="Women&#39;s_suffrage_in_the_United_States" title="wikilink">women's suffrage</a> movement. Leaving her first husband in 1915 to follow Reed to <a href="Greenwich_Village" title="wikilink">Greenwich Village</a>, she formed friendships with leading feminists of the day, some of whom she met through Reed's associates at publications such as <em>The Masses</em>, or at meetings of a women's group, <a href="Heterodoxy_(group)" title="wikilink">Heterodoxy</a>, or through work with the <a href="Provincetown_Players" title="wikilink">Provincetown Players</a>. During a <a href="National_Woman&#39;s_Party" title="wikilink">National Woman's Party</a> suffrage rally in <a href="Washington,_D.C." title="wikilink">Washington, D.C.</a>, in 1919, she was arrested and spent three days in jail. Like Reed, she had lovers outside of marriage; during her Greenwich Village years (1916–20) these included playwright <a href="Eugene_O&#39;Neill" title="wikilink">Eugene O'Neill</a> and painter <a href="Andrew_Dasburg" title="wikilink">Andrew Dasburg</a>.</p>
<p>The 1981 film, <em><a href="Reds_(film)" title="wikilink">Reds</a></em>, tells the story of Bryant's time with Reed. After his death from <a href="typhus" class="uri" title="wikilink">typhus</a> in 1920, Bryant continued to write for Hearst about Russia as well as Turkey, Hungary, Greece, Italy, and other countries in Europe and the Middle East. Some of these articles were republished in book form in <em>Mirrors of Moscow</em> in 1923. Later that year she married <a href="William_Christian_Bullitt,_Jr." title="wikilink">William Christian Bullitt, Jr.</a>, with whom she had her only child, Anne, born in 1924. Suffering from a rare and painful disorder, Bryant wrote and published little in her last 10 years and drank heavily. Bullitt, winning sole custody of Anne, divorced her in 1930. Bryant died in Paris in 1936 and was buried in <a href="Versailles_(city)" title="wikilink">Versailles</a>. A group from Portland visited her neglected grave in 1998 and worked to restore it.</p>

<p>Attending high school in Wadsworth and Reno, then Nevada State University (which became the University of Nevada, Reno), Bryant developed interests in journalism, debate, illustration, social life, dancing, and basketball.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> She edited the &quot;Young Ladies Edition&quot; of the <em>Student Record</em> in 1905, wrote a short story, &quot;The Way of a Flirt&quot;, for a literary magazine, <em>Chuckwalla</em>, and contributed sketches to it and another publication, <em>Artemisia</em>.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> Depressed after the death of Say in 1906, Bryant left school for a job in <a href="Jolon,_California" title="wikilink">Jolon, California</a>, where for a few months she boarded at a cattle ranch and taught children, mostly young Mexicans.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> That summer she moved again, this time to <a href="Eugene,_Oregon" title="wikilink">Eugene, Oregon</a>, where her brother Louis worked for the Southern Pacific.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>

<p>Bryant, who retained her maiden name and her downtown apartment after her marriage to Trullinger, bridled at doing housework and yearned for professional advancement. Drawn toward politics by a new friend, <a href="Sara_Bard_Field" title="wikilink">Sara Bard Field</a>, she became involved in the <a href="Women&#39;s_suffrage_in_the_United_States" title="wikilink">women's suffrage</a> movement. In 1912, she joined the Oregon branch of the <a href="College_Equal_Suffrage_League" title="wikilink">College Equal Suffrage League</a>. She and Field gave pro-suffrage speeches in smaller Oregon cities, and Bryant rode on the suffrage float in Portland's annual <a href="Flag_Day_(United_States)" title="wikilink">Flag Day</a> parade.

Among the works the group staged in 1916 were Bryant's &quot;The Game&quot;, in which characters named <em>Life</em> and <em>Death</em> play dice for the lives of <em>Youth</em> (a poet) and <em>Girl</em> (a dancer).

In October, Bryant and Reed bought their own place in Croton-on-Hudson. Meanwhile, Reed, who had suffered from kidney ailments since childhood, was told by his doctors that he would need to have a kidney removed. The surgery, considered &quot;gravely serious&quot;, was scheduled for mid-November.

<p>In February 1919, while still based in New York, Bryant went to Washington, D.C., to speak, along with <a href="Albert_Rhys_Williams" title="wikilink">Albert Rhys Williams</a>, about the situation in Russia.<a href="#fn78" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref78"><sup>78</sup></a> She stayed in Washington long enough to participate in a <a href="National_Woman&#39;s_Party" title="wikilink">National Woman's Party</a> suffrage rally, during which she was arrested and spent three days in jail.<a href="#fn79" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref79"><sup>79</sup></a> Upon her release, she insisted on testifying as an unfriendly witness before the <a href="Overman_Committee" title="wikilink">Overman Committee</a>, which had been set up to investigate Bolshevik activity in the United States. Deflecting questions about her religious beliefs, marriages, and other personal matters during her two days of testimony, she tried to convince the subcommittee, led by Senator <a href="Lee_Slater_Overman" title="wikilink">Lee S. Overman</a>, that Russia had a right to self-determination.<a href="#fn80" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref80"><sup>80</sup></a> Soon thereafter, she began a cross-country speaking tour, &quot;The Truth About Russia&quot;, arranged by <a href="Anna_Louise_Strong" title="wikilink">Anna Louise Strong</a>, during which she addressed large audiences in Detroit, Chicago, Spokane, Seattle, San Francisco, Los Angeles, and other American cities.<a href="#fn81" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref81"><sup>81</sup></a> According to biographer Virginia Gardner, Bryant was &quot;...the first woman to go among the huskings to defend Lenin and Trotsky. Her message was simple: 'Hands off Russia!' 'Bring the boys home!' &quot;<a href="#fn82" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref82"><sup>82</sup></a></p>
<p>After Bryant returned from her lecture tour in May, she and Reed spent the next few months mainly in Croton-on-Hudson writing, gardening, and in Reed's case, recuperating from <a href="influenza" class="uri" title="wikilink">influenza</a>.<a href="#fn83" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref83"><sup>83</sup></a> In late August, Reed, who had joined the <a href="Socialist_Party_of_America" title="wikilink">Socialist Party of America</a>, was chosen by one of its factions, the <a href="Communist_Labor_Party_of_America" title="wikilink">Communist Labor Party of America</a> (CLP), to visit Moscow to seek recognition for the CLP as the sole representative of the <a href="Comintern" title="wikilink">Communist International</a> (Comintern) in the U.S.<a href="#fn84" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref84"><sup>84</sup></a>{{#tag:ref|Unlike Reed, Bryant avoided party membership.<a href="#fn85" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref85"><sup>85</sup></a>|group=n}} The U.S. government quickly outlawed the CLP and its competitor, the <a href="American_Communist_Party" title="wikilink">American Communist Party</a>, headed by <a href="Louis_Fraina" title="wikilink">Louis Fraina</a>.<a href="#fn86" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref86"><sup>86</sup></a> In danger of being arrested and unable to get a passport to go to Russia, Reed, disguised as a <a href="Fireman_(steam_engine)" title="wikilink">stoker</a>, left the U.S. in late September 1919 on a Scandinavian ship headed for Europe.<a href="#fn87" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref87"><sup>87</sup></a> During the <a href="Palmer_Raids" title="wikilink">Palmer Raids</a> and <a href="First_Red_Scare" title="wikilink">Red Scare</a> days beginning in November 1919, he would be charged with conspiring to overthrow the government by force.<a href="#fn88" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref88"><sup>88</sup></a> Succeeding in reaching Moscow, he was arrested and incarcerated in Finland in March 1920 on his way home.<a href="#fn89" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref89"><sup>89</sup></a> Three months later, he was returned to Moscow in a prisoner exchange between the White (anti-Bolshevik) Finns of the <a href="Finnish_Civil_War" title="wikilink">Finnish Civil War</a> and the Bolsheviks.<a href="#fn90" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref90"><sup>90</sup></a> From <a href="Tallinn" title="wikilink">Reval</a> (Tallinn), Estonia, he cabled Bryant, &quot;Passport home refused.

<h2 id="reeds-death">Reed's death</h2>
<p>When Bryant reached Petrograd, Reed was in <a href="Baku" class="uri" title="wikilink">Baku</a>, attending the &quot;first congress of peoples of the east&quot; (Oriental Congress) with the Comintern executive committee.<a href="#fn94" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref94"><sup>94</sup></a> He had left a letter for her with several possibilities for lodging, one of which was a room he had arranged for her at the Dielovoy Hotel in Moscow. This is where, on September 15, they finally reconnected, spending the next few days together and visiting Lenin, Trotsky, Hungarian revolutionary <a href="B&lt;U+00E9&gt;la_Kun" title="wikilink">B&lt;U+00E9&gt;la Kun</a>, and <a href="Enver_Pasha" title="wikilink">Enver Pasha</a>, a former minister of war in the <a href="Ottoman_Empire" title="wikilink">Ottoman Empire</a>.<a href="#fn95" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref95"><sup>95</sup></a> Bryant began filing Moscow news stories with the <a href="International_News_Service" title="wikilink">International News Service</a>, which had hired her before she left New York.<a href="#fn96" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref96"><sup>96</sup></a></p>
<p>A week after Reed's return from Baku, he began to experience dizziness and headaches, thought at first to be symptoms of influenza. Five days later, when he became delirious, doctors diagnosed <a href="typhus" class="uri" title="wikilink">typhus</a> and sent him to the hospital. There, with Bryant by his side, he died on October 17, 1920, a few days shy of his 33rd birthday. On the day of Reed's funeral, in keeping with Russian custom, Bryant walked alone behind the hearse, at the head of the funeral procession. Fainting during the burial, she awoke in her hotel room. Among those at her bedside were Emma Goldman and Alexander Berkman, who had been arrested in the U.S. and deported to Russia in late 1919.<a href="#fn97" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref97"><sup>97</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="further-reporting">Further reporting</h2>
<p>After Reed's death, Bryant obtained Lenin's approval for a trip to the southern Russian border and neighboring countries.<a href="#fn98" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref98"><sup>98</sup></a> She went by train over the <a href="Kazakh_Steppe" title="wikilink">Kazakh Steppe</a>, through areas hard hit by famine, to <a href="Tashkent" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tashkent</a> and <a href="Bukhara" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bukhara</a> and to the borders of <a href="Iran" class="uri" title="wikilink">Iran</a> and <a href="Afghanistan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Afghanistan</a>, interviewing and taking notes.<a href="#fn99" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref99"><sup>99</sup></a></p>
<p>She returned to the U.S. in mid-summer 1921, and stayed for about a year.<a href="#fn100" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref100"><sup>100</sup></a> In August, the <em>New York American</em>, a <a href="Hearst_Corporation" title="wikilink">Hearst</a> newspaper, began publishing a series of 16 of her articles describing famine in Russia, Lenin's <a href="New_Economic_Policy" title="wikilink">New Economic Policy</a>, the end of the Russian civil war, and related topics.<a href="#fn101" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref101"><sup>101</sup></a> In general, the tone of these articles was &quot;sober and at times unsparing, in contrast to her often rapturous reporting in her 1918 stories.&quot;<a href="#fn102" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref102"><sup>102</sup></a></p>
<p>In October, she was the main speaker at a memorial for Reed in New York City, and she spent some of her time collecting Reed's papers together for possible publication.<a href="#fn103" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref103"><sup>103</sup></a> In addition, she arranged with <a href="King_Features_Syndicate" title="wikilink">King Features Syndicate</a>, another Hearst agency, to return to Russia to write portraits of Russians. The first of these appeared in print in June 1922 and led to her second book, <em>Mirrors of Moscow</em>, in 1923.<a href="#fn104" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref104"><sup>104</sup></a> Bryant's travels in Europe this time included Moscow, Berlin, London, Paris, and other cities. By late October, she was in Rome, accompanied by <a href="William_Christian_Bullitt,_Jr." title="wikilink">William Christian Bullitt, Jr.</a>, who would become her third husband.<a href="#fn105" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref105"><sup>105</sup></a> Here in late 1922, she wrote about <a href="Benito_Mussolini" title="wikilink">Benito Mussolini</a>, the Fascist leader who had just come to power and with whom she obtained an interview. Gathering material from a variety of sources, including Madame Mussolini, Bryant wrote a feature article, &quot;Mussolini Relies Upon Efficiency to Restore Italy&quot;, published in the <em>New York American</em> in early 1923. She described the future dictator this way:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I will always think of Mussolini as one of the oddest characters in history, and I will remember him as I last saw him in the great white and gold foyer of the Grand Hotel, under a huge crystal candelabra slouching wearily into a graceful Louis XV ivory and enameled chair.</p>
<p>His pale, heavy-boned face showed signs of sleeplessness. His strong body was bulging over the sides of the seat; his legs were spread wide over the pale, rose-colored velvet carpet. There was a little cup of black coffee, absurdly delicate, beside his gnarled work-warped hand.<a href="#fn106" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref106"><sup>106</sup></a></p>

<p>Leaving Rome to cover the <a href="Turkish_War_of_Independence" title="wikilink">Turkish War of Independence</a> for the International News Service, Bryant lived with Bullitt in a villa in Constantinople in early 1923.<a href="#fn107" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref107"><sup>107</sup></a> Bullitt was a wealthy Philadelphian who would later become the first U.S. ambassador to the Soviet Union.<a href="#fn108" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref108"><sup>108</sup></a> While he worked on a novel, <em>It's Not Done</em>, published in 1926 and dedicated to Bryant, she covered events related to the rise of Turkish strongman <a href="Mustafa_Kemal_Atat&lt;U+00FC&gt;rk" title="wikilink">Mustafa Kemal Atat&lt;U+00FC&gt;rk</a>.<a href="#fn109" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref109"><sup>109</sup></a> From her base in Turkey, she ventured to <a href="Palermo" class="uri" title="wikilink">Palermo</a> to interview the deposed king of Greece, <a href="Constantine_I_of_Greece" title="wikilink">Constantine I</a>, and to Athens to interview his son, <a href="George_II_of_Greece" title="wikilink">George II</a>.<a href="#fn110" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref110"><sup>110</sup></a> Shortly thereafter, Bryant suspended her journalistic career to focus on family matters.<a href="#fn111" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref111"><sup>111</sup></a></p>

Bryant gave birth to her only child, Anne, in February 1924,<a href="#fn112" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref112"><sup>112</sup></a> and in 1925 she and Bullitt added to their family an 8-year-old boy, Refik Ismaili Bey, whom they had met in Turkey.<a href="#fn113" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref113"><sup>113</sup></a> As the wife of a rich man, Bryant had duties related to the running of an upper-class household: &quot;...the management of servants, the ordering of food and planning of menus, house decoration, flower arrangement, keeping a social calendar.&quot;<a href="#fn114" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref114"><sup>114</sup></a> She told one visitor to her home that she considered her new life &quot;useless&quot;, and the Bryant–Bullitt marriage began to unravel.<a href="#fn115" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref115"><sup>115</sup></a> In &quot;Louise Bryant Grows Old&quot;, historian Christine Stansell examines the great changes in Bryant's life after her marriage to Bullitt:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The entrance of William Bullitt into Louise Bryant's life confounds the intertwined stories of the grief-stricken war widow, the radical heroine, and the champion of the oppressed. The marriage is a puzzle, both biographically and historically. Biographically, it proved to be a disaster, in contrast to Bryant's earlier romantic choices, which had been smart and fulfilling.<a href="#fn116" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref116"><sup>116</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Although Bryant continued to write, little of her work toward the end of her life was published.<a href="#fn117" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref117"><sup>117</sup></a> Her last piece of journalism, &quot;A Turkish Divorce&quot;, about Atat&lt;U+00FC&gt;rk's treatment of women, appeared in <em>The Nation</em> in August 1925.<a href="#fn118" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref118"><sup>118</sup></a></p>
<p>By 1926, Bryant, who had generally abstained from alcohol earlier in life, was suffering from painful and incurable <a href="adiposis_dolorosa" title="wikilink">adiposis dolorosa</a> (Dercum's disease) and had begun drinking heavily.<a href="#fn119" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref119"><sup>119</sup></a> In 1930, Bullitt, citing his wife's drinking and alleging that she was involved in a lesbian relationship with Gwen Le Gallienne, a daughter of writer <a href="Richard_Le_Gallienne" title="wikilink">Richard Le Gallienne</a>, divorced Bryant and won sole custody of Anne.<a href="#fn120" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref120"><sup>120</sup></a> Bryant continued to live in Paris, occasionally advising writer <a href="Claude_McKay" title="wikilink">Claude McKay</a>,<a href="#fn121" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref121"><sup>121</sup></a> and briefly assisting researchers from Harvard University in preserving John Reed's papers.<a href="#fn122" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref122"><sup>122</sup></a></p>
