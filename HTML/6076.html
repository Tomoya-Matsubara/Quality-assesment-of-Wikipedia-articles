<p><strong>Michael Burns</strong> (born 6 February 1969) is an English reserve list <a href="Umpire_(cricket)" title="wikilink">cricket umpire</a> and former <a href="first-class_cricket" title="wikilink">first-class cricketer</a> who played <a href="county_cricket" title="wikilink">county cricket</a> for <a href="Warwickshire_County_Cricket_Club" title="wikilink">Warwickshire</a> and <a href="Somerset_County_Cricket_Club" title="wikilink">Somerset</a> in a <a href="first-class_cricket" title="wikilink">first-class</a> career which spanned from 1992 until 2005. He also played <a href="Minor_Counties_cricket" title="wikilink">minor counties cricket</a> for <a href="Cumberland_County_Cricket_Club" title="wikilink">Cumberland</a> and <a href="Cornwall_County_Cricket_Club" title="wikilink">Cornwall</a>. An adaptable cricketer, he appeared for Cumberland and Warwickshire as a <a href="wicket-keeper" class="uri" title="wikilink">wicket-keeper</a>, but when he moved to Somerset he developed into an aggressive <a href="Batting_(cricket)" title="wikilink">batsman</a> who <a href="Bowling_(cricket)" title="wikilink">bowled</a> at <a href="Fast_bowling#Categorisation_of_fast_bowling" title="wikilink">medium-pace</a> when needed.</p>
<p>Burns started his cricket career with Cumberland in 1988, but moved to Warwickshire in late 1990. He struggled to break into the first team with his new county, and spent most of his time with the club playing in the second team. As a wicket-keeper, his opportunities were limited by the presence of <a href="Keith_Piper_(cricketer)" title="wikilink">Keith Piper</a>, and he failed to make an impact as a batsman when he was given chances in the first team. He only started to play regularly for the county in 1996, but opted to move to Somerset the following year.</p>
<p>For Somerset, Burns passed 1,000 first-class <a href="Run_(cricket)" title="wikilink">runs</a> in a season twice, and was part of the team which won the <a href="2001_Cheltenham_&amp;_Gloucester_Trophy" title="wikilink">2001 Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester Trophy</a>. He provided Somerset with a batting <a href="all-rounder" class="uri" title="wikilink">all-rounder</a>, particularly in <a href="Limited_overs_cricket" title="wikilink">one-day cricket</a> in which he <a href="Batting_average#Cricket" title="wikilink">averaged</a> 27 with the bat and 30 <a href="Bowling_average" title="wikilink">with the ball</a> for the county. He took over as <a href="List_of_Somerset_cricket_captains" title="wikilink">Somerset captain</a> in 2003, primarily due to the lack of other suitable candidates. He continued in the role in the following year, though he was criticised throughout due to poor results, which at one stage resulted in a number of Somerset's players being threatened with <a href="Termination_of_employment" title="wikilink">being sacked</a>. He was replaced as captain in 2005 by <a href="Graeme_Smith" title="wikilink">Graeme Smith</a>, and retired from first-class cricket at the end of that year. He subsequently trained as an <a href="Umpire_(cricket)" title="wikilink">umpire</a>, and was promoted to the <a href="England_and_Wales_Cricket_Board" title="wikilink">England and Wales Cricket Board</a>'s (ECB) reserve list in 2012.</p>

Reeve was impressed by an innings in which Burns scored a <a href="Century_(cricket)" title="wikilink">half-century</a>, and arranged for Warwickshire to offer him a trial.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> Burns scored 83 runs in his trial match,<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> and signed a contract shortly thereafter.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> At the end of that 1990 season, Burns played a second-team match for Warwickshire; the following season he made his debut in professional cricket for the county, playing a <a href="Benson_&amp;_Hedges_Cup" title="wikilink">Benson &amp; Hedges Cup</a> match against <a href="Essex_County_Cricket_Club" title="wikilink">Essex</a>.

<p>Burns had more first team opportunities during the 1993 season, due to a series of hand injuries to the first-choice wicket-keeper, <a href="Keith_Piper_(cricketer)" title="wikilink">Keith Piper</a>.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> Burns' chances came particularly in one-day cricket; he appeared in eleven <a href="List_A_cricket" title="wikilink">List A</a> matches during the year. He scored 151 runs across nine batting innings at an average of 25.16,<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> and reached his highest score of the season, 48 <a href="not_out" title="wikilink">not out</a>, against the touring <a href="Zimbabwe_national_cricket_team" title="wikilink">Zimbabweans</a> in September.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> Despite making another large <a href="Century_(cricket)" title="wikilink">century</a> for the second team, scoring 172 against <a href="Yorkshire_County_Cricket_Club" title="wikilink">Yorkshire</a> seconds,<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> he struggled in first-class cricket; in six appearances he averaged just 9.60 for his 96 runs.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> The following year, his only first-class match was against <a href="Oxford_University_Cricket_Club" title="wikilink">Oxford University</a>, with Piper ever-present in the County Championship.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a><a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> Burns continued to be selected as a wicket-keeper batsman in one-day cricket, though he was less successful than the previous year, scoring 86 runs at 10.75.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1995, Burns was given a prolonged run in the Warwickshire team, playing both first-class and one-day cricket throughout April and May; he failed to impress during these matches, recording a highest score of 35 and averaging well under twenty in both forms of the game.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a><a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> He spent the rest of the season playing for the second team.

<p>Towards the end of the 1996 season, Warwickshire's captain <a href="Dermot_Reeve" title="wikilink">Dermot Reeve</a> was forced to retire with a chronic hip injury.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> He moved to <a href="Somerset_County_Cricket_Club" title="wikilink">Somerset</a> in 1997, where he took on the role of team <a href="Coach_(sport)" title="wikilink">coach</a>; Burns followed him soon after.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> Somerset did not have a vacancy for a wicket-keeper; in 1997, <em><a href="Wisden_Cricketers&#39;_Almanack" title="wikilink">Wisden Cricketers' Almanack</a></em> described <a href="Robert_Turner_(cricketer)" title="wikilink">Robert Turner</a> as top-class. As a result, Burns focussed on his batting, particularly in one-day cricket, and also developed as an occasional medium-pace bowler.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> He played significantly more cricket in 1997 than in any year previously; in first-class cricket he maintained his average from the previous year, scoring 510 runs at 25.50,<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> and in one-day cricket he scored his maiden century in top-level cricket.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> Having never scored more than 48 runs in a List A match prior to 1997, Burns scored five half-centuries in addition to the 115 not out that he hit against <a href="Middlesex_County_Cricket_Club" title="wikilink">Middlesex</a> in September.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a><a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> His average of 31.35 in List A cricket that year was the highest of any season during his career,<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> and <em>Wisden</em> judged that he had &quot;made a good impression&quot; in the season.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> As a bowler, Burns took almost a third of his List A <a href="Wicket#Dismissing_a_batsman" title="wikilink">wickets</a> during 1997, claiming 18 at a <a href="bowling_average" title="wikilink">bowling average</a> of 24.77,<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> while in the first-class game he was used more sparingly, and took 5 wickets at 53.20.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a></p>

<p>The signing of Smith, along with the youth policy adopted by Somerset's new first-team coach, <a href="Mark_Garaway" title="wikilink">Mark Garaway</a>, meant that Burns had limited opportunities in 2005; he played nine first-class<a href="#fn80" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref80"><sup>80</sup></a> and eight List A matches during the season,<a href="#fn81" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref81"><sup>81</sup></a> and did not appear for the first team after July. He scored an early-season century, hitting eleven boundaries on his way to 107 runs against Warwickshire in the totesport League,<a href="#fn82" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref82"><sup>82</sup></a> but only scored 63 runs across his remaining seven one-day matches.<a href="#fn83" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref83"><sup>83</sup></a> As a result of his lack of first-team action, he opted to retire from first-class cricket at the end of the 2005 season.<a href="#fn84" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref84"><sup>84</sup></a> In all, he scored 7,648 first-class runs at an average of 32.68, and 4,802 List A runs at 25.81. He also took 68 first-class wickets and 58 in List A cricket.<a href="#fn85" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref85"><sup>85</sup></a></p>
<p>Burns continued to play club cricket in Somerset for <a href="Taunton_St_Andrews_Cricket_Club" title="wikilink">Taunton St Andrews Cricket Club</a> until 2009,<a href="#fn86" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref86"><sup>86</sup></a> helping them to become <a href="West_of_England_Premier_League" title="wikilink">West of England Premier League</a> champions in his final season with the club.<a href="#fn87" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref87"><sup>87</sup></a> He made minor counties appearances for Cumberland throughout 2006, before switching to <a href="Cornwall_County_Cricket_Club" title="wikilink">Cornwall</a> in 2008.<a href="#fn88" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref88"><sup>88</sup></a> He also toured with the <a href="Marylebone_Cricket_Club" title="wikilink">Marylebone Cricket Club</a>, travelling to Brazil and Chile in March 2007, and to <a href="Saint_Kitts_and_Nevis" title="wikilink">Saint Kitts and Nevis</a> in March 2008.<a href="#fn89" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref89"><sup>89</sup></a> He has subsequently stood as an umpire, and after standing in second-eleven matches in 2011, he was added to the ECB's reserve list of umpires for 2012.<a href="#fn90" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref90"><sup>90</sup></a> He made his debut as an umpire in first-class matches in March 2012, officiating in the match between Somerset and the <a href="Cardiff_MCC_University" title="wikilink">Cardiff MCC University</a> side.<a href="#fn91" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref91"><sup>91</sup></a></p>
