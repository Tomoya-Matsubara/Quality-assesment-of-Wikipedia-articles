<p>Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'u'll&lt;U+00E1&gt;h taught that humanity is one single race and that the age has come for its unification in a global society. His claim to divine revelation resulted in <a href="Persecution_of_Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;&#39;&lt;U+00ED&gt;s" title="wikilink">persecution</a> and imprisonment by the <a href="Qajar_dynasty" title="wikilink">Persian</a> and <a href="Ottoman_Empire" title="wikilink">Ottoman</a> authorities, and his eventual 24-year confinement in the prison city of <a href="Acre,_Israel" title="wikilink">`Akka</a>, <a href="Palestine" class="uri" title="wikilink">Palestine</a> (present day <a href="Israel" class="uri" title="wikilink">Israel</a>), where he died.

<dd>&quot;In the corner where the divan met the wall sat a wondrous and venerable figure, crowned with a felt head-dress of the kind called t&lt;U+00E1&gt;j by dervishes (but of unusual height and make), round the base of which was wound a small white turban. The face of him on whom I gazed I can never forget, though I cannot describe it. Those piercing eyes seemed to read one's very soul; power and authority sat on that ample brow; while the deep lines on the forehead and face implied an age which the jet-black hair and beard flowing down in indistinguishable luxuriance almost to the waist seemed to belie. No need to ask in whose presence I stood, as I bowed myself before one who is the object of a devotion and love which kings might envy and emperors sigh for in vain!&quot;<a href="#fn118" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref118"><sup>118</sup></a><a href="#fn119" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref119"><sup>119</sup></a>

Persian inscription reads M&lt;U+00ED&gt;rz&lt;U+00E1&gt; &lt;U+1E24&gt;usayn-`Al&lt;U+00ED&gt; N&lt;U+00FA&gt;r&lt;U+00ED&gt;" width="150" /> There are two known photographs of Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'u'll&lt;U+00E1&gt;h. This photo was taken for passport purposes while he was in <a href="Adrianople" class="uri" title="wikilink">Adrianople</a> (present day <a href="Edirne" class="uri" title="wikilink">Edirne</a>) and is reproduced in <a href="William_McElwee_Miller" title="wikilink">William Miller</a>'s book on the Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt; Faith. Copies of both pictures are at the <a href="Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;&#39;&lt;U+00ED&gt;_World_Centre" title="wikilink">Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt; World Centre</a>, and one is on display in the <a href="Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;&#39;&lt;U+00ED&gt;_World_Centre_buildings#International_Archives" title="wikilink">International Archives</a> building, where the Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt;s view it as part of an organized <a href="pilgrimage" class="uri" title="wikilink">pilgrimage</a>. Outside of this experience Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt;s prefer not to view this photo in public, or even to display it in their private homes,<a href="#fn157" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref157"><sup>157</sup></a> and Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt; institutions have requested the press not to publish the image in the media.<a href="#fn158" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref158"><sup>158</sup></a></p>
<p>Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'u'll&lt;U+00E1&gt;h's image is not, itself, offensive to Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt;s. However, Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt;s are expected to treat the image of any <a href="Manifestation_of_God" title="wikilink">Manifestation of God</a> with extreme reverence. According to this practice, they avoid depictions <a href="Depiction_of_Jesus" title="wikilink">of Jesus</a> or <a href="depictions_of_Muhammad" title="wikilink">of Muhammad</a>, and refrain from portraying any of them in <a href="Play_(theatre)" title="wikilink">plays</a> and <a href="drama" class="uri" title="wikilink">drama</a>. For example, copies of the photographs are displayed on highly significant occasions, such as six conferences held in October 1967 commemorating the centenary of Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'u'll&lt;U+00E1&gt;h's writing of the <em><a href="Suriy-i-Mul&lt;U+00FA&gt;k" class="uri" title="wikilink">Suriy-i-Mul&lt;U+00FA&gt;k</a></em> (Tablet to the Kings), which <a href="Shoghi_Effendi" title="wikilink">Shoghi Effendi</a> describes as &quot;the most momentous Tablet revealed by Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'u'll&lt;U+00E1&gt;h&quot;.<a href="#fn159" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref159"><sup>159</sup></a> After a meeting in Adrianople, the <a href="Hands_of_the_Cause" title="wikilink">Hands of the Cause</a> travelled to the conferences, 'each bearing the precious trust of a photograph of the Blessed Beauty, which it will be the privilege of those attending the Conferences to view.'<a href="#fn160" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref160"><sup>160</sup></a></p>
<p>The official Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt; position on displaying the photograph of Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'u'll&lt;U+00E1&gt;h is:</p>
<dl>

<dd>&quot;There is no objection that the believers look at the picture of Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'u'll&lt;U+00E1&gt;h, but they should do so with the utmost reverence, and should also not allow that it be exposed openly to the public, even in their private homes.&quot;
<dl>

<dd>(From a letter written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to an individual believer, 6 December 1939)<a href="#fn161" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref161"><sup>161</sup></a>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>While the above passage clarifies that it is considered disrespectful to display his photograph to the public, regarding postings on other websites the <a href="Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;&#39;&lt;U+00ED&gt;_World_Centre" title="wikilink">Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt; World Centre</a> has written:</p>
<dl>

<dd>&quot;For Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt;s, the photograph of Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'u'll&lt;U+00E1&gt;h is very precious and it should not only be viewed but also handled with due reverence and respect, which is not the case here [on a non-Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt; web site]. Thus, it is indeed disturbing to Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt;s to have the image of Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'u'll&lt;U+00E1&gt;h treated in such a disrespectful way. However, as the creator of the site is not a Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt;, there is little, if anything, that can be done to address this matter. We hope these comments have been of assistance.&quot;
