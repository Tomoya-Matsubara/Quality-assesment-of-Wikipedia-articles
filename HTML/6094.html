<p><strong><em>Geist</em></strong> (early working title: <strong><em>Fear</em></strong>, changed to avoid legal issues with <em><a href="F.E.A.R." class="uri" title="wikilink">F.E.A.R.</a></em>, an unrelated video game<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a><a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a>) is a <a href="video_game" title="wikilink">video game</a> for the <a href="Nintendo_GameCube" title="wikilink">Nintendo GameCube</a> <a href="video_game_console" title="wikilink">video game console</a>, released on <a href="August_15" title="wikilink">August 15</a>, <a href="2005" class="uri" title="wikilink">2005</a> in the USA and on <a href="October_7" title="wikilink">October 7</a> of the same year in Europe. The game was not released in Japan. The gameplay bears a resemblance to that of <em><a href="Metroid_Prime" title="wikilink">Metroid Prime</a></em><a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> and <em><a href="Messiah_(video_game)" title="wikilink">Messiah</a></em>,<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> with a sprinkle of &quot;Doom&quot; thrown in.</p>
<p>A prototype of the game was developed by <a href="n-Space" class="uri" title="wikilink">n-Space</a>, who approached <a href="Nintendo" class="uri" title="wikilink">Nintendo</a> as first to be the game's publisher. Nintendo accepted, making <em>Geist</em> the second game published by Nintendo to receive an M-rating (the first being <em><a href="Eternal_Darkness:_Sanity&#39;s_Requiem" title="wikilink">Eternal Darkness: Sanity's Requiem</a></em>). In the following years, Nintendo and n-Space worked closely on <em>Geist</em>.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> The game was first shown at the <a href="E3" class="uri" title="wikilink">E3</a> <a href="2003" class="uri" title="wikilink">2003</a><a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> and was announced to be part of the GameCube's line-up for 2003. However, it was delayed for two years for fine-tuning. During that time, the game's genre changed from <a href="first-person_shooter" title="wikilink">first-person shooter</a> to first-person <a href="Action-adventure_game" title="wikilink">action-adventure</a>.</p>
<p>The <em>Geist</em> franchise is currently in the possession of Nintendo, due to their contract with n-Space.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> At the moment, there are no (announced) plans for a <a href="sequel" class="uri" title="wikilink">sequel</a>.

<h2 id="synopsis">Synopsis</h2>
<h3 id="storyline">Storyline</h3>
<p>According to the game's official website, it is set in the year <a href="2005" class="uri" title="wikilink">2005</a>.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> John Raimi is a <a href="civilian" class="uri" title="wikilink">civilian</a> <a href="scientist" class="uri" title="wikilink">scientist</a> and a member of a <a href="counter-terrorism" class="uri" title="wikilink">counter-terrorism</a> team sent to investigate the Volks Corporation. The team, called CR-2, sent Thomas Bryson, Raimi's best friend, to Volks Corporation for an undercover operation months earlier and now they have to get him out of there.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> After meeting up with Bryson, the alarm goes off and CR-2 is forced to battle their way out. On the way out, a monster appears and violently kills one of Raimi's squad members. At the end, one of the agents seemingly becomes possessed and kills the rest of the team with the exception of Raimi, who just gets badly wounded, and, as the latter later finds out, Bryson. It is not revealed what happens with the possessed agent though. (After Raimi is shot and the screen fades to black, we hear one more gunshot; presumably the possessed agent killed himself.) Raimi is captured and his <a href="soul" class="uri" title="wikilink">soul</a> is torn from his body by an experimental machine.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> Soon after, Alexander Volks himself puts Raimi into a machine to brainwash him, so he will become a new soldier for Project Z. However, the spirit of a young girl named Gigi blows the machine's power to save Raimi. She then teaches him the basics of being a ghost<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> and Raimi sets out to get his body back and save Bryson. His new ghost abilities (<a href="Spiritual_Possession" title="wikilink">possessing</a> other humans, animals and even inanimate objects) immediately prove to be essential if he wants to succeed.</p>
<p>Raimi damages the main piece of machinery used in the ghost separation in order to prevent Bryson's separation. In the chaos that follows, Rourke, the head of Volks' <a href="military" class="uri" title="wikilink">military</a> department, orders the computer operator to fire a &quot;catalyst beam&quot; at the machine, despite their loss of containment. Following his orders, the laser is fired. Suddenly the machine breaks down and a humongous monster emerges from the rift. Because people normally cannot see ghosts, this goes unnoticed by the members of Volks Corporation. They know &quot;something&quot; escaped, but that is said to happen all the time, thus no more precautions are taken than the regular ones. Raimi is not too far away, attempting to make it farther into the facility. He soon notices there are other beings free as well. Escaped creatures from the rift are roaming the <a href="Compound_(fortification)" title="wikilink">compound</a>, killing everything that is not from their world.</p>
<p>Raimi manages to save Bryson and get a <a href="helicopter" class="uri" title="wikilink">helicopter</a> to pick him up. They part ways, because Bryson has to go and inform his superiors of what is going on, while Raimi does not want to go without his body. However, when the helicopter takes off, Raimi's body, possessed by <a href="Wraith" class="uri" title="wikilink">Wraith</a>, takes the helicopter down with a <a href="Shoulder-launched_missile_weapon" title="wikilink">rocket launcher</a>. Raimi follows him and ends up in a deserted mansion. There, he meets Gigi again. She then reveals to Raimi what her connection to Volks Corporation is. When she was alive, she lived with her aunt and brother in the mansion. Her brother is now the owner of Volks Corporation: Alexander Volks. Alexander was obsessed with the <a href="occult" class="uri" title="wikilink">occult</a> and <a href="supernatural" class="uri" title="wikilink">supernatural</a> when he was a young boy, often reading about it in books. One day he was reading a book in the big tree in the garden. Gigi tried to get his attention, but he told her to go away. She then climbed in the tree to get to him, but fell and died. Desperate, Alexander came up with the plan to use his knowledge about the occult to save his sister. He brought her to a &quot;special place&quot; (a seal to a <a href="demon" class="uri" title="wikilink">demon</a> realm) and tried to bring her back to life using spells he found in his books. The ritual failed however, and instead of bringing Gigi back to life, turned her soul into a ghost. To make matters worse, Alexander himself became slightly possessed by an ancient demon (Volks' Demon), which gave him a symbol-like scar above his right eye. Unaware of both results, Alexander became a puppet of the demon. It is revealed that Volks' Demon wants to seize control over the world through Alexander and with all that Volks Corporation has to offer.</p>
<p>Raimi soon is captured once more and again, Volks Corporation attempts to brainwash him. Due to another attack from some monsters, Raimi manages to free himself and continues his search for his body. Eventually, he gets his body back when facing Wraith. Once Raimi destroys him, he goes on in an attempt to stop the Volks Corporation from killing and possessing the world leaders (Project Z). He manages to stop the attack and at the end, comes face to face with the possessed Alexander Volks. When Raimi kills Alexander's body, Gigi appears and gets pulled into Alexander's body by Volks' Demon. Raimi follows her (as a ghost) and ends up in some ethereal realm which could either be Alexander's psyche, or (part of) the world on the other side of the rift. Raimi kills Volks' Demon here and witnesses the reunion of Alexander and Gigi (both ghosts now). They thank him and fly away. Raimi escapes from the collapsing cave and is picked up by a helicopter. In the helicopter, he meets Bryson again, who survived the attack. Funny enough, he also sees Anna Richardson and Phantom again, two characters he has possessed for some time during the game. Apart from the &quot;happy end&quot; feel, this is likely also an indication CR-2 has already started cleaning up Volks Corporation's mess.</p>
<h3 id="characters">Characters</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>John Raimi</strong> is the <a href="Protagonist" title="wikilink">main character</a> of <em>Geist</em>. He's 35 years old and an expert on <a href="Biological_warfare" title="wikilink">biological</a> and <a href="Chemical_warfare" title="wikilink">chemical threats</a>. At the beginning of the game, he is contacted by CR-2 to assist in a mission to save his old friend from college, Thomas Bryson.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> He is shot during the mission and wakes up strapped in a machine which soon separates his soul from his body. His body is stored somewhere in the <a href="Compound_(fortification)" title="wikilink">compound</a>, later gets possessed by Wraith and is reunited with his Raimi's soul near the end of the game. Raimi's soul on the other hand first is subjected to a <a href="Brainwashing" title="wikilink">brainwash</a> project. Saved by Gigi, he goes on a quest to get back his body. He has to learn to think and act like a <a href="ghost" class="uri" title="wikilink">ghost</a> in order to succeed. He also needs to help Bryson and Gigi, his only two allies in the compound and eventually, save the world from an ancient ghost-demon. It is implied at the beginning of the game that before he was separated from his body, he did not believe in the <a href="supernatural" class="uri" title="wikilink">supernatural</a>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Thomas Bryson</strong> is the 48-years old friend and <a href="mentor" class="uri" title="wikilink">mentor</a> of John Raimi. Like Raimi, he's an expert on biological and chemical threats. At the beginning of the game, he is working <a href="undercover" class="uri" title="wikilink">undercover</a> at Volks Corporation in order to find out what they are working on.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> It is not shown what happened to him when the mission to get him out of there failed (like why he was not killed). During the first part of the game, it is revealed that he's next for the separation experiment. When Raimi prevents this, Bryson is brought back to the medical wing. The staff is ordered to let him die by not giving him the treatment he needs to stay alive (apparently, some <a href="medical_procedure" title="wikilink">medical procedures</a> are needed before one can get a separation) as he is no longer useful. Again, he is saved by Raimi with whom he then tries to escape the compound. When he eventually tries to leave with a <a href="helicopter" class="uri" title="wikilink">helicopter</a> sent by CR-2, he already knows Raimi will not leave until he has his body back and he says goodbye. Ironically enough, just a few seconds later, Bryson's helicopter is shot down by Wraith possessing Raimi's body. At the end, it is revealed he survived (it is never stated how he did and what became of the others in the helicopter) as he is the one who picks up Raimi after the final battle.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><img src="Geist,Gigi.JPG" title="fig:Gigi as a ghost" alt="Gigi as a ghost" /><strong>Gigi Volks</strong> is Alexander Volks younger sister and Raimi's mentor in being a ghost. She appears as a young girl, having died at the age of 5 (her aunt's diary entries indicate she was born in <a href="1925" class="uri" title="wikilink">1925</a> and died in <a href="1930" class="uri" title="wikilink">1930</a>), who is completely green and, unlike Raimi and the Spectral Operatives, resembles the looks of her physical body. When she was alive, she lived with her aunt and brother in a big <a href="mansion" class="uri" title="wikilink">mansion</a> which later became part of the Volks Corporation compound. It is not revealed who her parents were (though her mother's name apparently is Lucy) or what happened to them. She was turned into a ghost and forced to be stuck in this realm when her brother tried to revive her by using <a href="occult" class="uri" title="wikilink">occult</a> <a href="magic_(fantasy)" title="wikilink">magic</a>. She has haunted her old home for 75 years watching over her brother who had become semi-possessed by an ancient demon during the ritual. Though she saved Raimi out of <a href="altruism" class="uri" title="wikilink">altruism</a>, she hopes he is strong enough to be able to help her brother. When Raimi kills Alexander's body during the first phase of the final battle, she is pulled inside Alexander's body by Volks' Demon. After Raimi defeats him, both Gigi and Alexander come out of Alexander's body and play a little in the air before leaving for the next world. Gigi is very fond of her <a href="teddy_bear" title="wikilink">teddy bear</a>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Alexander Volks</strong> is the 86-years old head of Volks Corporation.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> During his childhood, he lived with his aunt and sister in a big mansion close to where he later would build Volks Corporation's compound. It is not revealed who his parents were (though his mother's name apparently is Lucy) or what happened to them. He was obsessed with the occult and supernatural when he was a young boy, often reading about it in the books from his aunt's library. He was 11 years old when his sister died and he tried to revive her with arcane knowledge. From that day, he has been slightly possessed by a demon, who likely has influenced him to found Volks Corporation. As a mark of that day, Alexander has a symbol-like scar above his right eye where the demon touched him. He has become quite cold through the years. The only time he is shown to still have some emotions is when he's thinking about Gigi. Halfway through the game, Alexander becomes completely possessed and ends up being the first boss in the final battle. When his body is killed during the first phase of the final battle, his spirit is still stuck in his body. Raimi enters it to kill Volks' Demon and finally break the bond between the demon and Alexander. Once he is defeated, Alexander (who is a ghost(child) now too) and Gigi emerge from Alexander's body, thank Raimi and go on to the afterlife.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Commander Rourke</strong> is Volks' right hand and called a <a href="mercenary" class="uri" title="wikilink">mercenary</a> by him at the beginning of the game. He has supervised the testing of military equipment at Volks Corporation for 15 years. Rourke is shown to have a bad temper and be incredibly aggressive and impatient. He threatens people a lot, kills one person in-game for not listening and is stated several times to have injured other members of the staff. His personal assistant is said to get extra pay for taking the risk of working for Rourke. The only person he always behaves properly towards is his boss, though Rourke at one time states he would have ignored Volks' orders just for his own fun had Raimi not been tougher than he had expected. The only weak point Rourke has, are dogs: he suffers from severe <a href="Fear_of_dogs" title="wikilink">cynophobia</a>. He also appears to be under a lot of <a href="Stress_(medicine)" title="wikilink">stress</a>. Rourke, possessed by Wraith, is one of the bosses in this game.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Volks' Demon</strong> is the game's real <a href="antagonist" class="uri" title="wikilink">antagonist</a>. He's a giant <a href="ghost" class="uri" title="wikilink">ghost</a>-<a href="demon" class="uri" title="wikilink">demon</a> who, unlike the other ghosts, can directly influence the physical world. He appears to be a friend or ally of Wraith. When Giselle Tallant's husband, Joshua, died, Volks' Demon started talking to her. He pretended to be the spirit of Joshua and convinced Giselle to build a mansion near the seal to the rift and to keep expending it. By doing so, he hoped to be released in this world again when someone by accident would open the seal. This was first done by Alexander, but Volks' Demon only managed to get a part of him in this world, in the body of Alexander. Somewhere near this event, Giselle and the workers discovered an old, abandoned <a href="monastery" class="uri" title="wikilink">monastery</a>. What Giselle found there caused her to question if the voice she had been hearing all those years was Joshua's. It is not revealed what happened to her, but years later, the semi-possessed Alexander is the boss of a huge corporation located on a huge terrain of which the mansion and monastery are part of. During the events of the game, Volks' Demon escapes completely and fully possesses Alexander. When Raimi prevents Project Z's launch, and later kills Alexander's body, Volks' Demon pulls Gigi into Alexander's body. Raimi follows them and destroys Volks' Demon.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="gameplay">Gameplay</h2>
<p>[[Image:Geist1.jpg|left|the <em>Geist</em> review|publisher=<a href="ArmChairEmpire" class="uri" title="wikilink">ArmChairEmpire</a>|accessdate=2007-02-25}}</ref> Normally, his sight is blue/white (possibly [condary function in the form of a <a href="grenade_launcher" title="wikilink">grenade launcher</a> or <a href="infrared" class="uri" title="wikilink">infrared</a> <a href="-scope" title="wikilink">scope</a>.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> Other possessable humans are <a href="professor" title="wikilink">professors</a>, <a href="engineer" title="wikilink">engineers</a> can crawl through some small holes and reach the room on the other side. Bats can fly their way to otherwise unreachable areas. Other animals are tools to make a human host possessable. The only exception to animals being useless for combat situations are <a href="#monsters" title="wikilink">imps</a>, but they can only be possessed in the multiplayer mode.</p>
<p>Each host has a different L button ability. Some human hosts can sprint by holding the L button and others can crawl by pressing it. This means a character that can sprint cannot crawl or the other way around and this goes for all L button abilities. In some cases, the L button activates the <a href="Zoom_lens" title="wikilink">zoom</a> function.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> Most humans in the multiplayer mode have a different L button ability: jumping. The L button ability of animals is hardly ever required or even available at all. Rats can squeak and dogs and rabbits can jump.</p>
<h3 id="collectibles">Collectibles</h3>
<p>In <em>Geist</em>, the player can find two kinds of <a href="collectibles" class="uri" title="wikilink">collectibles</a> as a <a href="Quest_(gaming)#Side-quest" title="wikilink">side-quest</a>. They are respectively called Ghost Collectibles (because they have be picked up as a ghost) and Host Collectibles (because they have be picked up when possessing a host). They can be found in every level, except for the first one, because Raimi is not a ghost yet and cannot possess anything yet. Ghost Collectibles (2 per level) look like Gigi's <a href="teddy_bear" title="wikilink">teddy bear</a> and are the diary entries of Giselle Tallant, Gigi and Alexander's aunt. By picking them up (and scanning a few books in the library), the player learns a deeper part of the story. They also increase Raimi's ghost meter, enabling him to stay without a host for a longer period of time. Host Collectibles (4 per level) look like two V's (from Volks). When obtaining two of them, new features for the multiplayer mode are unlocked.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a></p>
<p>Also, Raimi keeps a log of items he examined and objects he possessed.</p>
<h3 id="multiplayer">Multiplayer</h3>
<p>The <a href="Multiplayer_game#Single-system" title="wikilink">multiplayer section</a> of the game is played with up to four human players and up to seven <a href="Computer_game_bot" title="wikilink">bots</a> (and one human player). It has three different modes: <em>Possession <a href="Deathmatch_(gaming)" title="wikilink">DeathMatch</a></em>, <em><a href="Capture_the_flag" title="wikilink">Capture the Host</a></em> and <em>Hunt</em>.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> Though these modes mostly are common multiplayer modes, the ghost aspect gives them a unique touch.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> <em>Possession DeathMatch</em> is played between ghosts. Therefore, each player is invunerable until he/she possesses a host, after which the game plays as a normal deathmatch. To prevent players from staying a ghost, they have a timed ghost life. <em>Capture the Host</em> is a combination of <em><a href="Deathmatch_(gaming)" title="wikilink">Deathmatch</a></em> and <em><a href="Capture_the_flag" title="wikilink">Capture the Flag</a></em>. Again, the battle is between ghosts. However, this time, kills made are not kept until the player dispossess the host on a base. There is also a key mode where a shield will surround the base and the players have to find the key to open it. <em>Hunt</em> is a hosts vs. ghosts mode. The hosts, armed with anti-ghost weapons, try to kill the ghosts, while the ghosts try to get the hosts to commit <a href="suicide" class="uri" title="wikilink">suicide</a> by possessing the hosts and letting them walk into one of the various deathtraps. Hosts can attempt to free themselves from the ghosts' grasp in time. The first team to get rid of all their opponents' lives wins.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a></p>
<p>During the story mode, hidden <a href="#Collectibles" title="wikilink">host collectibles</a> can be collected in order to unlock more multiplayer levels and characters. The abilities of ghosts and most hosts are slightly different from the story mode. For instance, most soldier hosts use the L button to jump, instead of sprint or crawl. Also, roaches and imps can be possessed in the multiplayer mode, but not in the single player mode. Another difference is the presence of <a href="power-up" title="wikilink">power-ups</a>, with various effects. Like most multiplayer modes of games, the players can choose from a list of &quot;advanced settings&quot; to adjust the multiplayer mode to their wishes.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="enemies">Enemies</h2>
<p>There is a big variety of enemies in <em>Geist</em>.</p>
<h3 id="humans">Humans</h3>
<p><img src="Geist,Cord.jpg" title="fig:Cord holding a grenade" alt="Cord holding a grenade" /> The biggest group of enemies Raimi faces are humans (<a href="soldier" title="wikilink">soldiers</a>) working for Volks Corporation. They are the first enemies he has to battle. Most of them are unaware of Raimi's presence and will not start shooting until the possessed host attacks them or ignores their orders. There are several different classes with different outfits and weapons. Raimi will possess all of them at least once. The human enemies are mostly called (...) Soldiers, with (...) either being &quot;Volks&quot; or (part of) the name of the weapon that class carries. The following weapons are used by them: <a href="assault_rifle" title="wikilink">assault rifles</a>, <a href="over/under_assault_rifles" title="wikilink">over/under assault rifles</a>, <a href="heavy_machine_gun" title="wikilink">heavy machine guns</a>, <a href="proximity_mine" title="wikilink">proximity mines</a>, <a href="shotgun" title="wikilink">shotguns</a>, <a href="submachine_gun" title="wikilink">submachine guns</a> and <a href="Shoulder-launched_missile_weapon" title="wikilink">rocket launchers</a>. There's also a special kind of soldier known as Spirit Hunters. Spirit Hunters carry an orange suit that gives them the same speed as ghosts (though for a limited time) and allow them to see ghosts. They are armed with Spirit Hunter guns and Anti-Spirit grenade launchers, that harm both hosts/physical creatures and ghosts. They can also force a ghost out of its host and make the host temporarily unpossessable. Despite humans being the most seen and fought enemies, only three <a href="Boss_(video_games)" title="wikilink">boss characters</a> are human and only one of them is not possessed during the fight.</p>
<ul>
<li>Cord: A high-ranking member of Volks' army. He's rough, violent and easily a head taller than everybody else. He is the only human boss Raimi fights that is not possessed. He is fought twice, surviving the first battle by fleeing when his shield breaks but dies in the second.</li>
<li>Rourke: Volks' right-hand man is a cruel and violent individual who suffers from severe <a href="Fear_of_dogs" title="wikilink">cynophobia</a>. In the boss fight, he is possessed by the Wraith.</li>
<li>Alexander Volks: The head of Volks Corporation, now under direct control of the extraplanar creature which has influenced him for years. He fights using his floating wheelchair, which fires machine gun rounds and rockets.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="virtual-enemies">Virtual enemies</h3>
<p>In the first part of level 7, Raimi is trapped in a <a href="Simulation#Computer_simulation" title="wikilink">simulation</a> again and has to prove his worth as a soldier. All Volks Soldiers he encounters here are non-hostile and solely meant for Raimi to use as hosts. His &quot;real&quot; enemies in the simulation are <a href="Virtual_artifact" title="wikilink">virtual</a> summit agents, who are either armed with <a href="sniper_rifle" title="wikilink">sniper rifles</a> or submachine guns. Their goal is to protect the virtual dignitaries, who Raimi is ordered to kill. Fighting them is the same as fighting real humans, with the exception that they cannot kill Raimi. Instead, &quot;Raimi fails the simulation&quot; and has to start over.</p>
<h3 id="vehicles">Vehicles</h3>
<p>At two points in the game, Raimi has to defeat enemies in vehicles. In Level 5, they do not attack Raimi, but instead, attack Bryson as he tries to escape. The most common vehicles are <a href="motorcycle" title="wikilink">motorcycles</a>. Their riders are armed with guns. Several black cars also try to kill Bryson by shooting him with their <a href="Gatling_gun" title="wikilink">gatling turrets</a>. There are two vehicles who serve somewhat as a boss fight.</p>
<ul>
<li>Black <a href="Truck" class="uri" title="wikilink">Truck</a>: Not a real boss, but it has to be damaged enough within a certain amount of time, lest it hit Bryson, causing an instant death. Unlike the other vehicles (or their drivers), it does not have any ranged combat equipment.</li>
<li>Helicopter: Raimi encounters two of them. One is harmless, but does try to transport the Spectral Operatives to the Paris Summit to start Project Z. The other one emerges after taking the first one down, and does try to kill Raimi.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="monsters">Monsters</h3>
<p><img src="Geist,Monster.jpg" title="fig:A kind of monster not in the final game" alt="A kind of monster not in the final game" /> Several monsters have escaped from the rift and the <a href="Laboratory" title="wikilink">labs</a> and attempt to kill everything that's not a monster as well. Volks Corporation has captured and studied several of them in an attempt to create new weapons (in which they succeeded). Though not intelligent, the monsters are very strong and capable of ranged combat. Their toughness is also shown in the first level, where Raimi remarks that the cut-off <a href="tentacle" class="uri" title="wikilink">tentacle</a> from some creature is still full of life. In that same level, the boss character is a monster called the Tentacle Monster. Later, monsters become more common. Small, blue, <a href="bipedal" class="uri" title="wikilink">bipedal</a> creatures called <a href="imp" title="wikilink">imps</a> are the most common monster enemies. They spit a blue fireball and can detonate themselves (the latter only happens in multiplayer mode). A lot bigger <a href="crab" title="wikilink">crablike</a> creatures appear later. They either spit some sort of acid ball or pins. It is suggested there are more kinds of monsters, but they do not appear in the game.</p>
<ul>
<li>Tentacle Monster: It is assumed that the slug thing escaped the labs and not from the rift. It makes repeated appearances during Raimi's quest, traveling through the pipes and superstructure of the complex. The tentacle monster is an eyeless creature apparently composed of several fleshy stalks (no main body is seen). One stalk ends in a mouth full of teeth, others in razor claws. The beast can fire <a href="triangle" title="wikilink">triangular</a> bursts of <a href="Etheric_plane" title="wikilink">ethereal</a> energy at targets. Its skin appears to be extremely hard, able to deflect bullets. Only shots to its open mouth damage it.</li>
<li><a href="Lernaean_Hydra" title="wikilink">Hydra</a>: Despite the name, the Hydra monster does not have multiple heads. It resembles an elongated, armored worm with spindly legs. It is first found in a snail-like shell, which is destroyed during the first encounter. Later, it (or another, similar creature) constructs a new shell from scattered debris, such as chemical canisters and crates. The Hydra's main form of attack is to roll over its enemy with its huge body, though it also can fire a long, sustained stream of <a href="crimson" class="uri" title="wikilink">crimson</a> energy or ethereal blasts.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="ghosts">Ghosts</h3>
<p>It is not until the last two levels that Raimi has to fight his peers. Other ghosts have been created by Volks Corporation as well, as part of Project Z, and are called Spectral Operatives. Unlike Raimi, they are red and serve Volks Corporation. However, it is unknown if they are brainwashed or not and whether they serve Alexander Volks or the demon possessing him. They have Raimi's abilities: they cannot do direct damage, but they are fast and can possess the same host another ghost (Raimi) is currently possessing. When done so, they attempt to get Raimi's host body (his own by the time he has to face them) to commit <a href="suicide" class="uri" title="wikilink">suicide</a> and a struggle for control starts. If Raimi wins, the Spectral Operative is thrown out of the host and flies off a little before attacking again. They can only be killed with Anti-Spirit grenades. There are also two &quot;genuine&quot; ghosts in the game, who both escaped from the rift. Their names are not revealed, even though they are the game's actual villains. They both serve as a boss, each first possessing a human and then attacking straight on when the host is killed.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="Wraith" class="uri" title="wikilink">Wraith</a>: No official name is found for this monster, but it appears to be a close friend or ally of the demon possessing Volks. Its true form is nearly transparent. It appears to have a black, hunched, insectoid body with elongated spines. For a long time, it possesses Raimi's body. He appears to have the same abilities as the Spectral Operatives and Raimi.</li>
<li>Volks' <a href="Demon" class="uri" title="wikilink">Demon</a>: Again, no official name is given for the beast that controls Volks. It appears as a huge, red, <a href="reptile" title="wikilink">reptilian</a> creature with a long tail, horns, and blades sprouting from its back. Unlike other ghosts, it appears to have some physical abilities, as it destroyed the rings above the rift without possessing them and temporarily made its eyes visible to humans without the help of some <a href="Mediumship" title="wikilink">medium</a>. He is the final boss and is fought in a strange realm, apparently within Alexander Volks' body or psyche and possibly part of Volks' Demon's home world. There, Volks' Demon is surrounded by a strong shield, consisting of several rings which can be fired as well.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="other">Other</h3>
<p>One other enemy type appears as a boss battle.</p>
<ul>
<li>Twin Golems: Two giant stone guardians. It is not explained why they were built or by whom. It is also not explained if they are possessed objects or can move and attack on their own. They have a blue glowing substance beneath their armor, which is their weakness. They can shoot <a href="Missile_guidance" title="wikilink">guided balls of energy</a> from their eyes and create <a href="shockwave" title="wikilink">shockwaves</a> by walking.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="easter-eggs">Easter Eggs</h2>
<p>Like most games, <em>Geist</em> has its fair share of <a href="Easter_egg_(virtual)" title="wikilink">easter eggs</a>. In level 4, the player can check the lockers in the women's changing room. One has a <a href="Nintendo_GameCube" title="wikilink">Nintendo GameCube</a> system, and another one has the <a href="helmet" class="uri" title="wikilink">helmet</a> of <a href="Samus_Aran" title="wikilink">Samus Aran</a>, the protagonist of the <a href="Metroid_series" title="wikilink"><em>Metroid</em> series</a>.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> Similar, in level 5, in the Lounge room, the player can find two <a href="Nintendo_Entertainment_System" title="wikilink">Nintendo Entertainment Systems</a> and two <a href="Super_Nintendo_Entertainment_System" title="wikilink">Super Nintendo Entertainment Systems</a>.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> When possessing Rourke in his elite battle armor, the player comes through a room filled with computers and a few soldiers. Almost all of the computers will have a blue screen and the message &quot;The operating system has crashed on this computer&quot;. This is a reference to the <a href="blue_screen_of_death" title="wikilink">blue screen of death</a>, an infamous error message that indicates that a process or program has crashed a Windows operating system. <em>Geist</em> also contains a few references to people who developed <em>Geist</em>. In level 2, the player can possess a Schwalk <a href="Ale" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ale</a> can. This is a reference to one of <em>Geist</em>'s <a href="lead_programmer" title="wikilink">lead programmers</a>: Timothy Schwalk.(<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> Geist: Behind the Scenes) Another reference to the development team can be found in level 5, in which the player gets to learn the names of four other ghosts (Spectral Operatives). The names are: Forest Crump, Brian Miller, Amy Williams and Peetra Cooper. They refer to: Forrest Crump, Brian Miller, Amy Williams and Peet Cooper. Except for Brian Miller, who did <a href="Constructed_world" title="wikilink">World Building</a>, they all did <a href="Digital_character" title="wikilink">Character Modelling &amp; Animation</a>. In the medical level, after receiving the key to the morgue, you can go back to a previously locked room in which is a phone that, when activated speaks the names of some people who supposedly work in the Vorks Corp. It is possible that they are staff who worked on the game.</p>
<h2 id="development">Development</h2>
<p>Work on <em>Geist</em> officially started in 2002.(<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> Dan O'Leary Interview) N-Space learned that Nintendo was interested in a <a href="first-person_shooter" title="wikilink">first-person shooter</a>/<a href="action_game" title="wikilink">action game</a> with a unique feel to it. So, n-Space came up with the idea about making a game with an <a href="The_Invisible_Man" title="wikilink">invisible man</a> as the <a href="protagonist" class="uri" title="wikilink">protagonist</a>.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a><a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> From there, the concept changed from being an invisible person to being a <a href="ghost" class="uri" title="wikilink">ghost</a>.</p>
<p>After about eight months of work,<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> n-Space finished the <a href="prototype" class="uri" title="wikilink">prototype</a> and sent it to <a href="Nintendo_of_America" title="wikilink">Nintendo of America</a>, from which it was sent to <a href="Nintendo" title="wikilink">NCL</a>. Nintendo latched onto the game, and it was decided N-Space and Nintendo would closely work together to develop the game<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a><a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> After six months, object possession was introduced in the game after some suggestions from <a href="Shigeru_Miyamoto" title="wikilink">Shigeru Miyamoto</a>.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> <em>Geist</em> was first shown to the public at the <a href="E3" class="uri" title="wikilink">E3</a> <a href="2003" class="uri" title="wikilink">2003</a> and it was later stated that <em>Geist</em> would even be released in that same year.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> In the months after the E3 both companies realized they &quot;weren't working on the same game&quot;; N-Space had envisioned <em>Geist</em> to be a <a href="first-person_shooter" title="wikilink">first-person shooter</a> while Nintendo (more specifically, Kensuke Tanabe<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a>) considered it to be a <a href="first-person" class="uri" title="wikilink">first-person</a> <a href="action-adventure_game" title="wikilink">action-adventure</a>. The adjustments caused the game to eventually be delayed many times until it was finally released two years later in <a href="2005_in_video_gaming" title="wikilink">2005</a>, but <em>Geist</em> was present at both the E3 <a href="2004" class="uri" title="wikilink">2004</a> and E3 <a href="2005" class="uri" title="wikilink">2005</a>.</p>
<h3 id="e3-2003-demo-vs.-the-final-game">E3 2003 demo vs. The final game</h3>
<p>A lot of gameplay mechanics had changed during development in these two years. From the E3 2003 demo of <em>Geist</em>,<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> it can be concluded that many areas have been redone and placed in a different order. The story also appears to be a bit different. For instance, Bryson is not dying, but simply locked up when you meet him. As for gameplay, much more has changed. In the demo, Raimi does not have the violet tinge to his vision when he is not possessing anything, nor does the physical world become slower. Dispossessed hosts in the demo are unconscious, while in the game they are still awake. In the game, Raimi looks roughly like an <a href="Etheric_plane" title="wikilink">ethereal</a> version of his physical appearance, but in the E3 demo, he's a far more <a href="tradition" title="wikilink">traditional</a> ghost with a <a href="skeleton" title="wikilink">skeletal</a> appearance and no legs. Also, in the game, Raimi does not fight other ghosts until the final levels, while they appear to be common enemies in the demo. Two abilities ghost-Raimi possesses in the demo were heavily adjusted. In the demo, Raimi can shoot ethereal blasts in this realm, while he can only do that in the ethereal realm in the game. The ability to influence objects from a distance through <a href="psychokinesis" class="uri" title="wikilink">psychokinesis</a> was removed and replaced with the ability to influence objects through <a href="Spiritual_possession" title="wikilink">possession</a>.(<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> Ted Newman Interview)/</p>
<h2 id="voices">Voices</h2>
<p>Most of the voices done in the game were radio personalities from <a href="WTKS-FM" class="uri" title="wikilink">WTKS-FM</a> 104.1 based out of <a href="Orlando,_Florida" title="wikilink">Orlando</a>, <a href="Florida" class="uri" title="wikilink">Florida</a>, including members of <a href="The_Shannon_Burke_Show" title="wikilink">The Shannon Burke Show</a>, and <a href="The_Monsters_In_The_Morning" title="wikilink">The Monsters in the Morning</a>.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a></p>

<p><em>Geist</em> was Nintendo's <a href="E3" class="uri" title="wikilink">E3</a> 2003 surprise, as it was not a new title from one of their old(er) franchises and no rumours about it had been going around before the E3 2003. In general, people were enthusiastic about the demo.<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a><a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a><a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a></p>
<p>Two years later, while <em>Geist</em> was praised for its originality in idea, gameplay and story, it was held back by a weak engine (<a href="IGN" class="uri" title="wikilink">IGN</a>: <em>&quot;Unfortunately, a game engine incapable of matching n-Space's ambitions occasionally hampers the experience&quot;</em><a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a>) which caused <em>Geist</em> not to be able to maintain a smooth <a href="Frame_rate" title="wikilink">framerate</a> throughout the <a href="first-person_shooter" title="wikilink">first-person shooter</a> sequences. The game suffered from sluggish shooter controls that were not on par with other first-person shooters of its time. <a href="Nintendo_World_Report" title="wikilink">Nintendo World Report</a> wrote: <em>&quot;There's a constant struggle with the controls that makes the game more frustrating than it should be&quot;</em><a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a> and <a href="IGN" class="uri" title="wikilink">IGN</a> called it <em>&quot;not exactly poor, but it certainly doesn't compare to better shooters on the market, either&quot;</em>.<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a> <em>Geist</em> was also burdened by, at times, poor character <a href="animation" class="uri" title="wikilink">animation</a> and enemy <a href="Artificial_intelligence" title="wikilink">AI</a>. Some reviewers were disappointed the game only allowed one scare-<a href="Tactic_(method)" title="wikilink">tactic</a> per person or animal and did not allow the player to be creative. Or as <a href="GameSpot" class="uri" title="wikilink">GameSpot</a> put it: <em>&quot;You'll wonder how the game might have been different if it gave you more freedom to accomplish your objectives&quot;</em>.<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a></p>
<p>On the other hand, most reviews did praise the scare-tactics for always being different and fun (<a href="Nintendo_World_Report" title="wikilink">Nintendo World Report</a>: <em>&quot;Figuring out how to scare hosts is a lot of fun, especially because the ways in which you scare them are often very inventive&quot;</em>).<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a> Although the animation was not considered really good, the <a href="graphics" class="uri" title="wikilink">graphics</a> were positively criticized. Altogether, the game was mostly placed in the &quot;reasonable-to-good&quot; range, with remarks as <em>&quot;Geist at least serves as an important reminder that an original game design and a first-person perspective aren't mutually exclusive. The shooter portions of Geist aren't all that special, but there's a lot more to this game than meets the eye&quot;</em> from <a href="GameSpot" class="uri" title="wikilink">GameSpot</a> and <em>&quot;The concept is refreshingly inventive and Geist is propelled into something much greater than a FPS clone&quot;</em> from <a href="IGN" class="uri" title="wikilink">IGN</a>, but also <em>&quot;Unfortunately, no sooner does Geist suggest it can blossom into something fresh and exciting that it&lt;U+2019&gt;s undermined at every turn by a frustrating insistence on being nothing more than a mundane firstperson shooter&quot;</em> from <a href="Edge_(magazine)" title="wikilink">Edge</a>.<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a></p>
