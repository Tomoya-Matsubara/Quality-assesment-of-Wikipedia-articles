<p>The <strong>Indian Army during World War I</strong> sometimes called the <a href="British_Indian_Army" title="wikilink">British Indian Army</a> contributed a number of divisions and independent brigades to the European, Mediterranean and the Middle east theatres of war in <a href="World_War_I" title="wikilink">World War I</a>. One million Indian troops would serve overseas, of whom 62,000 died and another 67,000 were wounded. In total 74,187 Indian soldiers died during the war.</p>
<p>The Indian Army had undergone major reforms in 1903, after <a href="Horatio_Kitchener,_1st_Earl_Kitchener_of_Khartoum" title="wikilink">Kitchener</a> was appointed <a href="Commander-in-Chief,_India" title="wikilink">Commander-in-Chief, India</a>.

By mid-morning, a German mounted patrol ambushed a supply column and roughly 100 mules carrying water for the troops were stampeded away by the Germans. The British officers, with their now widely scattered troops, waited until darkness and having determined their situation to be untenable, withdrew down the mountain and marched back to British East Africa having accomplished nothing.<a href="#fn67" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a><a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a></p>

<li>On 2 September 1918 on the west bank of the <a href="River_Jordan" title="wikilink">River Jordan</a>, Palestine, when his squadron was charging a strong enemy position, Ressaidar Badlu Singh realised that heavy casualties were being inflicted from a small hill occupied by machine-guns and 200 infantry. Without any hesitation he collected six other ranks and with entire disregard of danger he charged and captured the position. He was mortally wounded on the very top of the hill when capturing one of the machine-guns single handed, but all the guns and infantry had surrendered to him before he died.<a href="#fn118" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref118"><sup>118</sup></a></li>
