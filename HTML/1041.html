A third category is for awarded trophies, such as recognition for league play or <a href="MVP" class="uri" title="wikilink">MVP</a> selection.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="ubo-patcher">UBO Patcher</h3>

The Rookie Clubhouse is designed for new players levels 1-9 while the Pickup Clubhouse is designed for players level 9-99. Other servers include the Practice Clubhouse, specifically used for practices, and Tournament Clubhouses, for special events.</p>
<p>All UBO Servers are located in <a href="Diamond_Bar,_CA" title="wikilink">Diamond Bar, CA</a>.</p>
<h3 id="character-creation">Character Creation</h3>
<p>Players can create and customize their <a href="avatar" class="uri" title="wikilink">avatar</a> as a unique baseball character, selecting their baseball position for playing and viewing all game play from the unique perspective.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> Some of the many avatar customization options that Ultimate Baseball Online offers are:</p>

<li><a href="Knuckleball" title="wikilink">Knuckle Ball</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="batting">Batting</h3>
<p>Hitters control everything in the hitting mode from swing power to hit location. Just like in real life, timing and accuracy is everything. Players can determine what type of swing they want (from bunt to all types of contact levels). Based on the speed of the pitch and reaction time to start the swing, a player can hit a <a href="Home_Run" title="wikilink">Home Run</a> out of the park or miss on a breaking ball low and away.</p>
<h3 id="fielding">Fielding</h3>
<p>Running, catching, throwing; all in the same play. Fielders must complete plays, make the outs, and prevent runs from scoring, much like in real life baseball. Players are not limited to their positions, as players can choose positions prior to the start of each game as well as during each game. From outfield to infield to foul ground, players can make plays just like real baseball players do, as well as dive and jump for the ball. In the event a full game is not reached, the AI takes the field and plays the position.</p>
<h3 id="stadiums">Stadiums</h3>
<p>The original Ultimate Baseball Online Stadium includes a jumbotron, billboards, stands, and normal features of a baseball stadium. One unique feature of the UBO Stadium is the outfield waterfalls. The stadium bares a striking resemblance to <a href="Kauffman_Stadium" title="wikilink">Kauffman Stadium</a>, the home of the <a href="Kansas_City_Royals" title="wikilink">Kansas City Royals</a>.</p>
<h2 id="tournaments">Tournaments</h2>
<p>Tournaments are designed to provide quick and intense competition between teams and individuals. Most tournaments are free and hosted weekly by Ultimate Baseball Online's development team. Any team, pending if requirements are met, can join tournaments and compete against each other at the specified time of the tournament. Entire tournaments may last several days, pending on how many teams are entered.</p>
<p>UBO pay-to-play tournaments costs an small entry fee, but the winners take home valuable prizes. There have been three prize tournaments featuring the <a href="Apple" class="uri" title="wikilink">Apple</a> <a href="iPod_mini" title="wikilink">iPod mini</a><a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a>, <a href="Nike,_Inc." title="wikilink">Nike</a> Sunglasses<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a>, and <a href="Sony_PSP" title="wikilink">Sony PSP</a>'s<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a>. Prizes were awarded to each individual player of the teams who won the tournament.</p>
<p>Netamin has also announced the &quot;Best of UBO 2007&quot; competition, featuring a total of $10,000USD.</p>
<h3 id="power-rankings">Power Rankings</h3>
<p>UBO 2006 included the awarding of Power Ranking Points for teams, based on their performance in a wide variety of UBO leagues and tournaments. Points are accumulated throughout the 2007 calendar year, with the top 64 UBO teams earning a berth in competition dubbed &quot;The Best of UBO 2007&quot;.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>

There are three league classes: Elite, All-Star, and Major. Leagues usually feature a 10-game regular season, 3 wildcard playoff games, 4 division final games, and a 5-game league championship.

<p>64 teams consisting of five to nine players will qualify during the year to compete in the tournament, which will run from November 26 to December 21, 2007. Each round will be a best-of-three series, and the championship round will be a best-of-five series. A team may qualify for a berth in the Best of UBO 2007 Tournament in any one of three ways:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Winning a UBO league (season)</strong> - There are four seasons in 2007, and three levels of play for teams (Minor, Major and Elite)</li>

</ul>
