<p><strong>Ancient Egyptian literature</strong> was written in the <a href="Egyptian_language" title="wikilink">Egyptian language</a> from <a href="Ancient_Egypt" title="wikilink">Ancient Egypt</a>'s <a href="History_of_ancient_Egypt" title="wikilink">pharaonic period</a> until the end of <a href="Egypt_(Roman_province)" title="wikilink">Roman domination</a>. It represents the oldest corpus of <a href="Literature_of_Egypt" title="wikilink">Egyptian literature</a>. Along with <a href="Sumerian_literature" title="wikilink">Sumerian literature</a>, it is considered the world's <a href="Ancient_literature" title="wikilink">earliest literature</a>.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p><a href="Writing_in_Ancient_Egypt" title="wikilink">Writing in Ancient Egypt</a>&lt;U+2014&gt;both <a href="Egyptian_hieroglyphs" title="wikilink">hieroglyphic</a> and <a href="hieratic" class="uri" title="wikilink">hieratic</a>&lt;U+2014&gt;first appeared in the late 4th millennium BC during the late phase of <a href="predynastic_Egypt" title="wikilink">predynastic Egypt</a>. By the <a href="Old_Kingdom" title="wikilink">Old Kingdom</a> (26th century BC to 22nd century BC), literary works included <a href="Ancient_Egyptian_funerary_texts" title="wikilink">funerary texts</a>, <a href="epistle" title="wikilink">epistles</a> and letters, religious hymns and poems, and commemorative <a href="Autobiography" title="wikilink">autobiographical</a> texts recounting the careers of prominent administrative officials. It was not until the early <a href="Middle_Kingdom_of_Egypt" title="wikilink">Middle Kingdom</a> (21st century BC to 17th century BC) that a narrative Egyptian literature was created. This was a &quot;media revolution&quot; which, according to <a href="Richard_B._Parkinson" title="wikilink">Richard B. Parkinson</a>, was the result of the rise of an intellectual class of <a href="scribe" title="wikilink">scribes</a>, new cultural sensibilities about individuality, unprecedented levels of literacy, and mainstream access to written materials.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> However, it is possible that the overall <a href="literacy_rate" title="wikilink">literacy rate</a> was less than one percent of the entire population. The creation of literature was thus an elite exercise, monopolized by a scribal class attached to government offices and the royal court of the ruling <a href="pharaoh" class="uri" title="wikilink">pharaoh</a>. However, there is no full consensus among modern scholars concerning the dependence of ancient Egyptian literature on the sociopolitical order of the royal court.</p>
<p><a href="Middle_Egyptian" title="wikilink">Middle Egyptian</a>, the <a href="spoken_language" title="wikilink">spoken language</a> of the Middle Kingdom, became a <a href="classical_language" title="wikilink">classical language</a> during the <a href="New_Kingdom" title="wikilink">New Kingdom</a> (16th century BC to 11th century BC), when the <a href="vernacular_language" title="wikilink">vernacular language</a> known as <a href="Late_Egyptian" title="wikilink">Late Egyptian</a> first appeared in writing. Scribes of the New Kingdom <a href="Wiktionary:Canon" title="wikilink">canonized</a> and copied many literary texts written in Middle Egyptian, which remained the language used for oral readings of sacred hieroglyphic texts. Some genres of Middle Kingdom literature, such as &quot;<a href="Sebayt" title="wikilink">teachings</a>&quot; and <a href="Traditional_stories" title="wikilink">fictional tales</a>, remained popular in the New Kingdom, although the genre of <a href="Prophecy" title="wikilink">prophetic texts</a> was not revived until the <a href="History_of_Ptolemaic_Egypt" title="wikilink">Ptolemaic period</a> (4th century BC to 1st century BC). Popular tales included the <em><a href="Story_of_Sinuhe" title="wikilink">Story of Sinuhe</a></em> and <em><a href="The_Eloquent_Peasant" title="wikilink">The Eloquent Peasant</a></em>, while important teaching texts include the <em><a href="Instructions_of_Amenemhat" title="wikilink">Instructions of Amenemhat</a></em> and <em><a href="The_Loyalist_Teaching" title="wikilink">The Loyalist Teaching</a></em>. By the New Kingdom period, the writing of commemorative graffiti on sacred temple and tomb walls flourished as a unique genre of literature, yet it employed formulaic phrases similar to other genres. The acknowledgment of rightful authorship remained important only in a few genres, while texts of the &quot;teaching&quot; genre were <a href="pseudonym" title="wikilink">pseudonymous</a> and falsely attributed to prominent historical figures.</p>
<p>Ancient Egyptian literature has been preserved on a wide variety of media. This includes <a href="papyrus" class="uri" title="wikilink">papyrus</a> scrolls and packets, limestone or ceramic <a href="ostracon" title="wikilink">ostraca</a>, wooden writing boards, <a href="Ancient_Egyptian_architecture" title="wikilink">monumental stone edifices</a> and <a href="Coffin_Texts" title="wikilink">coffins</a>. Texts preserved and unearthed by modern archaeologists represent a small fraction of ancient Egyptian literary material. The area of the <a href="Flooding_of_the_Nile" title="wikilink">floodplain of the Nile</a> is under-represented because the moist environment is unsuitable for the preservation of papyri and ink inscriptions. On the other hand, hidden caches of literature, buried for thousands of years, have been discovered in settlements on the dry desert margins of Egyptian civilization.</p>

<p>Hieratic is a simplified, cursive form of Egyptian hieroglyphs.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> Like hieroglyphs, hieratic was used in sacred and religious texts.

<p>By the mid-1st millennium BC, hieroglyphs and hieratic were still used for royal, monumental, religious, and funerary writings, while a new, even more cursive script was used for informal, day-to-day writing: <a href="Demotic_(Egyptian)" title="wikilink">Demotic</a>.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> The final script adopted by the ancient Egyptians was the <a href="Coptic_alphabet" title="wikilink">Coptic alphabet</a>, a revised version of the <a href="Greek_alphabet" title="wikilink">Greek alphabet</a>.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> Coptic became the standard in the 4th century AD when <a href="Christianity" class="uri" title="wikilink">Christianity</a> became the <a href="state_religion" title="wikilink">state religion</a> throughout the <a href="Roman_Empire" title="wikilink">Roman Empire</a>; hieroglyphs were discarded as <a href="Idolatry" title="wikilink">idolatrous images</a> of a pagan tradition, unfit for writing the <a href="Biblical_canon" title="wikilink">Biblical canon</a>.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a></p>

<p>Egyptian literature was produced on a variety of <a href="Media_(communication)" title="wikilink">media</a>. Along with the <a href="chisel" class="uri" title="wikilink">chisel</a>, necessary for making inscriptions on stone, the chief writing tool of ancient Egypt was the <a href="reed_pen" title="wikilink">reed pen</a>, a <a href="Phragmites" title="wikilink">reed</a> fashioned into a stem with a bruised, brush-like end.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> With pigments of carbon black and red <a href="ochre" class="uri" title="wikilink">ochre</a>, the reed pen was used to write on scrolls of <a href="papyrus" class="uri" title="wikilink">papyrus</a>&lt;U+2014&gt;a thin material made from beating together strips of <a href="pith" class="uri" title="wikilink">pith</a> from the <em><a href="Cyperus_papyrus" title="wikilink">Cyperus papyrus</a></em> plant&lt;U+2014&gt;as well as on small ceramic or limestone <a href="ostraca" class="uri" title="wikilink">ostraca</a> known as <a href="potsherd" title="wikilink">potsherds</a>.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> It is thought that papyrus rolls were moderately expensive commercial items, since many are <a href="palimpsest" title="wikilink">palimpsests</a>, manuscripts that have their original contents <a href="Eraser" title="wikilink">erased</a> to make room for new written works.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> This, alongside tearing off pieces of papyrus documents to make smaller letters, suggests that there were seasonal shortages caused by the limited growing season of <em>Cyperus papyrus</em>.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> It also explains the frequent use of ostraca and limestone flakes as writing media for shorter written works.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> In addition to stone, ceramic ostraca, and papyrus, writing media also included wood, ivory, and plaster.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a></p>

<p>Underground Egyptian tombs built in the desert provide possibly the most protective environment for the preservation of papyrus documents. For example, there are many well-preserved <em><a href="Book_of_the_Dead" title="wikilink">Book of the Dead</a></em> funerary papyri placed in tombs to act as afterlife guides for the souls of the deceased tomb occupants.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> However, it was only customary during the late Middle Kingdom and first half of the New Kingdom to place non-religious papyri in burial chambers. Thus, the majority of well-preserved literary papyri are dated to this period.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a></p>
<p>Most settlements in ancient Egypt were situated on the <a href="alluvium" class="uri" title="wikilink">alluvium</a> of the <a href="Flooding_of_the_Nile" title="wikilink">Nile floodplain</a>. This moist environment was unfavorable for long-term preservation of papyrus documents. Archaeologists have discovered a larger quantity of papyrus documents in desert settlements on land elevated above the floodplain,<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> and in settlements that lacked irrigation works, such as <a href="Elephantine" class="uri" title="wikilink">Elephantine</a>, <a href="El-Lahun" class="uri" title="wikilink">El-Lahun</a>, and <a href="El-Hiba" class="uri" title="wikilink">El-Hiba</a>.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> <img src="Egyptian_harvest.jpg" title="fig:Egyptian peasants harvesting papyrus, from a mural painting in a Deir el-Medina tomb dated to the early Ramesside Period (i.e. Nineteenth dynasty)" alt="Egyptian peasants harvesting papyrus, from a mural painting in a Deir el-Medina tomb dated to the early Ramesside Period (i.e. Nineteenth dynasty)" /></p>
<p>Writings on more permanent media have also been lost in various ways.

<p>Throughout ancient Egyptian history, reading and writing were the main requirements for serving in public office, although government officials were assisted in their day-to-day work by an elite, <a href="Literacy" title="wikilink">literate</a> social group known as <a href="scribe" title="wikilink">scribes</a>.<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a> As evidenced by <a href="Papyrus_Anastasi_I" title="wikilink">Papyrus Anastasi I</a> of the Ramesside Period, scribes could even be expected, according to Wilson, &quot;...to organize the excavation of a lake and the building of a brick ramp, to establish the number of men needed to transport an <a href="obelisk" class="uri" title="wikilink">obelisk</a> and to arrange the provisioning of a military mission&quot;.<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a> Besides government employment, scribal services in drafting letters, sales documents, and legal documents would have been frequently sought by illiterate people.<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a> Literate people are thought to have comprised only 1% of the population;<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a> the remainder being illiterate farmers, herdsmen, artisans, and other laborers,<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a> as well as merchants who required the assistance of scribal secretaries.<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a> The privileged status of the scribe over illiterate manual laborers was the subject of a popular Ramesside Period instructional text, <em><a href="The_Satire_of_the_Trades" title="wikilink">The Satire of the Trades</a></em>, where lowly, undesirable occupations, for example, potter, fisherman, laundry man, and soldier, were mocked and the scribal profession praised.<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a> A similar demeaning attitude towards the illiterate is expressed in the Middle Kingdom <em>Teaching of Khety</em>, which is used to reinforce the scribes' elevated position within the social hierarchy.<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a></p>
<p>The scribal class was the social group responsible for maintaining, transmitting, and canonizing literary classics, and writing new compositions.<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a> Classic works, such as the <em><a href="Story_of_Sinuhe" title="wikilink">Story of Sinuhe</a></em> and <em><a href="Instructions_of_Amenemhat" title="wikilink">Instructions of Amenemhat</a></em>, were copied by schoolboys as pedagogical exercises in writing and to instill the required ethical and moral values that distinguished the scribal social class.<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a> <a href="Wisdom_texts" title="wikilink">Wisdom texts</a> of the &quot;<a href="sebayt" title="wikilink">teaching</a>&quot; genre represent the majority of pedagogical texts written on ostraca during the Middle Kingdom; narrative tales, such as <em>Sinuhe</em> and <em><a href="King_Neferkare_and_General_Sasenet" title="wikilink">King Neferkare and General Sasenet</a></em>, were rarely copied for school exercises until the New Kingdom.<a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a> <a href="William_Kelly_Simpson" title="wikilink">William Kelly Simpson</a> describes narrative tales such as <em>Sinuhe</em> and <em>The shipwrecked sailor</em> as &quot;...instructions or teachings in the guise of narratives&quot;, since the main <a href="protagonist" title="wikilink">protagonists</a> of such stories embodied the accepted virtues of the day, such as love of home or self-reliance.<a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a></p>
<p>There are some known instances where those outside the scribal profession were literate and had access to classical literature.

<blockquote>
<p>What may be revealed by Hori's attack on the way in which some Ramesside scribes felt obliged to demonstrate their greater or lesser acquaintance with ancient literature is the conception that these venerable works were meant to be known in full and not to be misused as quarries for popular sayings mined deliberately from the past. The classics of the time were to be memorized completely and comprehended thoroughly before being cited.<a href="#fn67" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a></p>

<p>There is scant but solid evidence in Egyptian literature and <a href="Art_of_ancient_Egypt" title="wikilink">art</a> for the practice of oral reading of texts to audiences.<a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a> The oral performance word &quot;to recite&quot; (<em>&lt;U+0161&gt;dj</em>) was usually associated with <a href="biographies" class="uri" title="wikilink">biographies</a>, letters, and spells.<a href="#fn69" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref69"><sup>69</sup></a> Singing (<em>&lt;U+1E25&gt;sj</em>) was meant for praise songs, <a href="love_song" title="wikilink">love songs</a>, funerary <a href="lament" title="wikilink">laments</a>, and certain spells.<a href="#fn70" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a> <a href="Discourse" title="wikilink">Discourses</a> such as the <em><a href="Prophecy_of_Neferti" title="wikilink">Prophecy of Neferti</a></em> suggest that compositions were meant for oral reading among elite gatherings.<a href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a> In the 1st millennium BC Demotic <a href="short_story_cycle" title="wikilink">short story cycle</a> centered around the deeds of <a href="Petiese" class="uri" title="wikilink">Petiese</a>, the stories begin with the phrase &quot;The voice which is before Pharaoh&quot;, which indicates that an oral speaker and audience was involved in the reading of the text.<a href="#fn72" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref72"><sup>72</sup></a> A fictional audience of high government officials and members of the royal court are mentioned in some texts, but a wider, non-literate audience may have been involved.<a href="#fn73" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref73"><sup>73</sup></a> For example, a funerary stela of <a href="Senusret_I" title="wikilink">Senusret I</a> (r. 1971&lt;U+2013&gt;1926 BC) explicitly mentions people who will gather and listen to a scribe who &quot;recites&quot; the stela inscriptions out loud.<a href="#fn74" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref74"><sup>74</sup></a></p>
<p>Literature also served religious purposes. Beginning with the <em><a href="Pyramid_Texts" title="wikilink">Pyramid Texts</a></em> of the Old Kingdom, works of funerary literature written on tomb walls, and later on <a href="Coffin_Texts" title="wikilink">coffins</a>, and <a href="Book_of_the_Dead" title="wikilink">papyri</a> placed within tombs, were designed to protect and nurture souls in their afterlife.<a href="#fn75" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref75"><sup>75</sup></a> This included the use of magical spells, <a href="incantation" title="wikilink">incantations</a>, and lyrical hymns.<a href="#fn76" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref76"><sup>76</sup></a> Copies of non-funerary literary texts found in non-royal tombs suggest that the dead could entertain themselves in the afterlife by reading these teaching texts and narrative tales.<a href="#fn77" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref77"><sup>77</sup></a></p>
<p>Although the creation of literature was predominantly a male scribal pursuit, some works are thought to have been written by women. For example, several references to women writing letters and surviving private letters sent and received by women have been found.<a href="#fn78" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref78"><sup>78</sup></a> However, <a href="Edward_F._Wente" title="wikilink">Edward F.
