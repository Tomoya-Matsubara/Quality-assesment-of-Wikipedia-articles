<p>A <strong>battlement</strong>, (also called a <a href="crenellation" class="uri" title="wikilink">crenellation</a>) in defensive <a href="architecture" class="uri" title="wikilink">architecture</a> such as that of <a href="city_wall" title="wikilink">city walls</a> or <a href="castle" title="wikilink">castles</a>, comprises a <a href="parapet" class="uri" title="wikilink">parapet</a> (i.e. a short wall), in which portions have been cut out at intervals to allow the discharge of arrows or other missiles. These cut-out portions form <a href="crenel" title="wikilink">crenels</a> (also known as <em>carnels</em>, <em>embrasures</em>, <em>loops</em> or <em>wheelers</em>). The solid widths between the crenels are called <a href="merlon" title="wikilink">merlons</a> (also called <em>cops</em> or <em>kneelers</em>). Battlements often have openings between the supporting <a href="corbel" title="wikilink">corbels</a>, through which stones or burning objects could be dropped on attackers; these are known as <a href="machicolation" title="wikilink">machicolations</a>. A wall with battlements is said to be <em>crenellated</em> or <em>embattled</em>. <img src="Avignon-palais-des-papes.jpg" title="fig:The Palais des papes in Avignon shows characteristic battlements." alt="The Palais des papes in Avignon shows characteristic battlements." width="230" /> The term originated around the <a href="14th_century" title="wikilink">14th century</a> from the <a href="Old_French" title="wikilink">Old French</a> word <em>batailler</em>, &quot;to fortify with <em>batailles</em>&quot; (fixed or movable turrets of defence).</p>
<p>Battlements have been used for thousands of years; the earliest known example is in the palace at Medinet-Abu at <a href="Thebes,_Egypt" title="wikilink">Thebes</a> in <a href="Egypt" class="uri" title="wikilink">Egypt</a>, which allegedly derives from <a href="Syria" title="wikilink">Syrian</a> fortresses. Battlements were used in the walls surrounding <a href="Assyria" title="wikilink">Assyrian</a> towns, as shown on bas reliefs from <a href="Nimrud" class="uri" title="wikilink">Nimrud</a> and elsewhere. Traces of them remain at <a href="Mycenae" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mycenae</a> in <a href="Greece" class="uri" title="wikilink">Greece</a>, and some <a href="Ancient_Greece" title="wikilink">ancient Greek</a> vases suggest the existence of battlements.</p>
<p>The <a href="Ancient_Rome" title="wikilink">Romans</a> used low wooden pinnacles for their first <em>aggere</em>s (terreplains). In the battlements of <a href="Pompeii" class="uri" title="wikilink">Pompeii</a>, additional protection derived from small internal buttresses or spur walls against which the defender might place himself so as to gain complete protection on one side. In the battlements of the <a href="Middle_Ages" title="wikilink">Middle Ages</a> the crenel comprised one-third of the width of the merlon: the latter, in addition, could be provided with arrow-loops of various shapes (from simply round to cruciform), depending from the weapon to fire. Late merlons permitted fire from the first <a href="firearm" title="wikilink">firearms</a>. From the 13th century the merlons, moreover, could be connected with wooden shutters that provided added protection when closed. The shutters were designed to be opened to allow fire backwards against the attackers, and closed during reloading.</p>
<p>Loop-holes were frequent in Italian battlements, where the merlon has much greater height and a distinctive cap. Italian military architects devised the <em>Ghibelline</em> or <em>swallowtail</em> battlement, with V-shaped notches in the tops of the merlon, giving a horn-like effect. The normal rectangular-shaped merlons were called <em>Guelphic</em>. In <a href="Muslim" class="uri" title="wikilink">Muslim</a> and <a href="Africa" title="wikilink">African</a> fortifications the merlons often had a rounded shape.</p>

<p>The battlements of the <a href="Arabs" class="uri" title="wikilink">Arabs</a> had a more decorative and varied character, and continued from the <a href="13th_century" title="wikilink">13th century</a> onwards not so much for defensive purposes as for a crowning feature to their walls. They appear therefore in the same light as the cresting found in the <a href="Spain" title="wikilink">Spanish</a> <a href="renaissance" class="uri" title="wikilink">renaissance</a>. Similarly, European architects persistently used battlements as a purely decorative feature throughout the <a href="decorated_style" title="wikilink">Decorated</a> and <a href="perpendicular_style" title="wikilink">Perpendicular</a> periods. They not only occur on parapets but on the <a href="transom" title="wikilink">transoms</a> of windows and on the tie-beams of roofs and on screens, and even on <a href="Tudor_style" title="wikilink">Tudor</a> chimney-pots.</p>
<p>A further decorative treatment appears in the elaborate panelling of the merlons and that portion of the parapet walls rising above the <a href="cornice_(architecture)" title="wikilink">cornice</a>, by the introduction of <a href="quatrefoil" title="wikilink">quatrefoils</a> and other conventional forms filled with foliage and shields.</p>
