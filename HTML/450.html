<h2 id="plot">Plot</h2>
<p><a href="Homer_Simpson" title="wikilink">Homer</a> and <a href="Bart_Simpson" title="wikilink">Bart</a> watch a TV movie called <em>The Krusty the Clown Story: Booze, Drugs, Guns, Lies, Blackmail and Laughter</em>, which reveals that Krusty won four <a href="Emmy_Award" title="wikilink">Emmys</a>, but they keep getting interrupted by <a href="Lisa_Simpson" title="wikilink">Lisa</a> playing her <a href="saxophone" class="uri" title="wikilink">saxophone</a> in her bedroom. Homer asks her to stop and Lisa responds that she has to have an hour of practice everyday. Bart enters Lisa's bedroom and tries to grab the saxophone from her but he inadvertently tosses it out the window. It lands in the middle of the street and is run over by a car, a truck and stomped on by <a href="Nelson_Muntz" title="wikilink">Nelson Muntz</a>. In a period of mourning, Lisa reveals she cannot remember ever <em>not</em> having that saxophone, so Homer recounts the instrument's origins.</p>
<p>In a flashback to 1990, Bart goes to his first day of school, but things do not go so well for him. Bart's initial enthusiasm is crushed by an uncaring teacher who says that he would be a failure at life, and he draws a violent sketch of his feelings. Marge becomes worried that something is truly wrong with him. It is during discussions of Bart's future that the school <a href="psychologist" class="uri" title="wikilink">psychologist</a> realizes the young Lisa completed a complicated puzzle of <a href="Taj_Mahal" title="wikilink">Taj Mahal</a>, telling Homer and Marge that they need to nurture her gifted spirit. They try to send Lisa to a private school but the tuition fee cost $6,000. Meanwhile, a terrible heat wave hit Springfield and Homer saved $200 to buy an <a href="air_conditioner" title="wikilink">air conditioner</a>. Marge, however, asked Homer not to buy one until they figure out how to help Lisa. At the school, Bart talks with his future friend <a href="Milhouse_Van_Houten" title="wikilink">Milhouse</a> and makes a <a href="flatulance" title="wikilink">farting</a> sound, which Milhouse finds amusing. Encouraged, Bart entertains a group of children with rude words and when <a href="Seymour_Skinner" title="wikilink">Principal Skinner</a> tells him to stop, Bart replies &quot;<a href="eat_my_shorts" title="wikilink">eat my shorts</a>&quot; and starts humming the <a href="Batman_Theme" title="wikilink">Batman theme</a>, replacing the word &quot;Batman&quot; with &quot;Buttman&quot;, setting out on his path to become the school prankster.</p>
<p>On his way to purchase a new air conditioner, Homer discovers that a musical instrument is a way to encourage a gifted child, and subsequently sacrifices his air conditioner money to buy Lisa her first saxophone. He asks the clerk to engrave on the sax: &quot;<em>Dear Lisa. Never forget your daddy loves...</em>&quot;, but finishes the sentence with a &quot;<a href="d&#39;oh!" class="uri" title="wikilink">d'oh!</a>&quot; as he drops the saxophone by accident. In the present, Marge mentions that there is some money in the air conditioner account. Homer complains that the house has had no air conditioner for many years, but decides to buy another saxophone for Lisa, which was inscribed, &quot;<em>Dear Lisa: May your new saxophone bring you many years of D'oh!</em>&quot; Lisa then plays the saxophone hook from the song &quot;<a href="Baker_Street_(song)" title="wikilink">Baker Street</a>.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="image:Kingtoots.jpg" title="wikilink">thumb|right|King Toot's Music Store</a> &quot;Lisa's Sax&quot; is the first episode that <a href="Al_Jean" title="wikilink">Al Jean</a> had ever been credited as having written by himself. Before this episode, all of his writing credits had been shared with <a href="Mike_Reiss" title="wikilink">Mike Reiss</a>.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> The episode was written with a small staff that consisted of Jean, Reiss and <a href="David_M._Stern" title="wikilink">David Stern</a>, among others. According to Jean, the final episode contained 80-90% of Jean's original script.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> It is the sixth flashback episode done by the show. &quot;<a href="The_Way_We_Was" title="wikilink">The Way We Was</a>&quot; was the first flashback episode and in it, Homer graduated from high school in 1974 and that made it difficult to have a realistic timeframe as this episode is set in 1990.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> Jean conceived the idea for the <em><a href="All_in_the_Family" title="wikilink">All in the Family</a></em> style opening while waiting to get tickets to the <a href="O._J._Simpson_murder_case" title="wikilink">O.J. Simpson murder trial</a>.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> The episode was very short and the clip of Lisa playing the sax at the end was added to lengthen it.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p>The pastel drawing of Krusty was drawn entirely by Dominic Polcino. It was an easy episode for Polcino to direct due to the lack of crowds and being a &quot;grounded episode&quot;.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> This is the last episode in which <a href="Doris_Grau" title="wikilink">Doris Grau</a> has a speaking role as <a href="Springfield_Elementary_School#Lunchlady_Doris" title="wikilink">Lunchlady Doris</a>, although this episode aired nearly two years after her death. It would also mark the final time the character would speak until <a href="The_Simpsons_(season_18)" title="wikilink">Season 18</a>'s &quot;<a href="The_Mook,_the_Chef,_the_Wife_and_Her_Homer" title="wikilink">The Mook, the Chef, the Wife and Her Homer</a>&quot; when she was voiced by <a href="Tress_MacNeille" title="wikilink">Tress MacNeille</a>.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
