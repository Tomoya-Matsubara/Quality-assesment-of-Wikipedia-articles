 <strong>Rotavirus</strong> is the most common cause of <a href="virus" title="wikilink">viral</a> <a href="gastroenteritis" class="uri" title="wikilink">gastroenteritis</a> in infants and all children suffer from at least one rotavirus infection before their fifth birthday. Rotavirus is found all over the world but in the <a href="developing_country" title="wikilink">developing countries</a> approximately 100 million cases of rotavirus infection occur annually in children under five and around 600,000 die. In the US, rotaviruses cause an estimated one million episodes of gastroenteritis and 150 deaths of children every year.</p>
<p>Rotavirus is an <a href="RNA_virus" title="wikilink">RNA virus</a> and seven <a href="species" class="uri" title="wikilink">species</a> have been identified. Rotavirus A is the species that causes over 90% of infections in humans. There are different strains of Rotavirus A and many children suffer from more than one infection during their early years. The infection is spread via the <a href="fecal-oral_route" title="wikilink">fecal-oral route</a> and huge numbers of rotaviruses are excreted by infected children. The virus has a triple-layered <a href="protein" class="uri" title="wikilink">protein</a> coat and is very stable outside the body.</p>
<p>All strains of rotavirus infect the cells of <a href="small_intestine" title="wikilink">small intestine</a> and produce a powerful <a href="enterotoxin" class="uri" title="wikilink">enterotoxin</a> that causes diarhoea which helps to spread the infection rapidly within families and communities.</p>
<p>Rotavirus is also important in veterinary medicine, as it infects the young of many animals. As with <a href="Influenza" class="uri" title="wikilink">Influenza</a>, animals infected by rotavirus may act as a reservoir for new strains of rotavirus that could cause epidemics.</p>
<p>In 2003 the <a href="World_Health_Organization" title="wikilink">World Health Organization</a> and the US <a href="Centers_for_Disease_Control" title="wikilink">Centers for Disease Control</a> established the Rotavirus Vaccine Program to reduce child <a href="morbidity" class="uri" title="wikilink">morbidity</a> and <a href="Mortality_rate" title="wikilink">mortality</a> from diarrhoeal disease by making a vaccine against rotavirus available for use in developing countries.</p>

<p>In 1943 Light and Hodes described a virus, now known to be a rotavirus, that caused <a href="scours" class="uri" title="wikilink">scours</a> in cattle.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> In the 1960s, a similar virus that infects mice was discovered,<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> which was also subsequently shown to be a rotavirus.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> In 1973 rotaviruses were first seen in children with gastroenteritis by a research team, lead by Ruth Bishop, in Australia.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a><a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> In the same year, similar discoveries were reported from England by a research group led by <a href="Thomas_Henry_Flewett" title="wikilink">Tom Flewett</a>.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> In 1976 rotaviruses were discovered in several species of animals,<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> and they were soon recognised as a world-wide human and animal <a href="pathogen" class="uri" title="wikilink">pathogen</a>.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> In the early 1980s rotaviruses were discovered to be a diverse group of viruses.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a><a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> At this time, progress in research was slow because rotaviruses could not be grown artificially in <a href="cell_culture" title="wikilink">cell cultures</a>.

<p>Rotaviruses are not a single type of virus but are a diverse mixture.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> There are seven groups which are called rotavirus A, B, C, D, E, F, and G. Groups A, B and C infect humans and all groups can cause disease in animals. Group A rotavirus is by far the commonest cause of infections of humans. Within Group A rotaviruses there is further diversity and different strains, called <a href="serovar" title="wikilink">serotypes</a>, exist.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> As is the case with <a href="Influenza_virus" title="wikilink">Influenza virus</a>, two <a href="gene" title="wikilink">genes</a> determine rotavirus serotypes and these genes are inherited independently. For group A rotaviruses these genes produce two proteins called VP4 and VP7 which are on the surface of the <a href="virion" class="uri" title="wikilink">virion</a> and are <a href="antigen" title="wikilink">antigens</a>. Both of these proteins are important in <a href="immunity_(medical)" title="wikilink">immunity</a>. Rotavirus A is subdivided into the different serotypes based on the <a href="antibody" class="uri" title="wikilink">antibody</a> response to VP7 (designated as G types) and to VP4 (P types).<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="structure">Structure</h3>
<p>The <a href="genome" class="uri" title="wikilink">genome</a> of rotavirus consists of eleven double helix molecules of <a href="RNA" class="uri" title="wikilink">RNA</a> which are 18,555 <a href="nucleoside" class="uri" title="wikilink">nucleoside</a> base-pairs in total. Each helix, or segment, is a <a href="gene" class="uri" title="wikilink">gene</a> and they are numbered 1 to 11 by decreasing size. Each gene codes for one protein except genes 9 and 11 which each code for two.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> The RNA is surrounded by a three-layered <a href="icosahedron" title="wikilink">icosahedral</a> <a href="protein" class="uri" title="wikilink">protein</a> <a href="capsid" class="uri" title="wikilink">capsid</a>. The first layer is formed by the protein VP2, with each vertex having a copy of the proteins VP1 and VP3. VP stands for Viral Protein. The second layer is formed by the protein VP6. The outermost protein layer is composed of the structural <a href="glycoprotein" class="uri" title="wikilink">glycoprotein</a> VP7 and the spike protein VP4.

<p><img src="Rotavirus_Structure.png" title="fig:A simplified diagram of the location of rotavirus structural proteins" alt="A simplified diagram of the location of rotavirus structural proteins" width="300" /> There are six viral proteins, (VP) which form the virus particle (<a href="virion" class="uri" title="wikilink">virion</a>). These are called VP1, VP2, VP3, VP4, VP5, VP6 and VP7 and five non-structural proteins that are only produced in cells infected by rotavirus. These are called <a href="NSP1(Rotavirus)" title="wikilink">NSP1</a>, <a href="NSP2(Rotavirus)" title="wikilink">NSP2</a>, <a href="NSP3(Rotavirus)" title="wikilink">NSP3</a>, <a href="NSP4(Rotavirus)" title="wikilink">NSP4</a>, <a href="NSP5(Rotavirus)" title="wikilink">NSP5</a> and <a href="NSP6(Rotavirus)" title="wikilink">NSP6</a>.

<h3 id="replication">Replication</h3>
<p><img src="Rotavirus_replication.png" title="fig:A simplified drawing of the rotavirus replication cycle" alt="A simplified drawing of the rotavirus replication cycle" width="400" /> Rotaviruses infect the cells that line the small intestine. Their triple <a href="protein" class="uri" title="wikilink">protein</a> coats make them very resistant to the acidic <a href="pH" class="uri" title="wikilink">pH</a> of the stomach, and also the digestive enzymes (lipases and proteases) in the gut.</p>
<p>They enter cells by endocytosis and form a vesicle known as an <em>endosome</em>. Proteins in the third layer (VP7 and the VP4 spike) disrupt the membrane of the endosome, creating a difference in the Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration. This causes the breakdown of VP7 <a href="Trimer_(biochemistry)" title="wikilink">trimers</a> into single protein subunits, leaving the VP2 and VP6 coats around the viral ds<a href="RNA" class="uri" title="wikilink">RNA</a>, forming a double-layer particle (DLP).</p>
<p>While the eleven ds<a href="RNA" class="uri" title="wikilink">RNA</a> strands are still within the protection of the two protein shells, the viral <a href="RNA_replicase" title="wikilink">RNA-dependent RNA polymerase</a> creates <a href="mRNA" class="uri" title="wikilink">mRNA</a> transcripts of the double-stranded viral genome. By remaining in the core the viral RNA evades innate host immune responses called <a href="RNA_interference" title="wikilink">RNA interference</a> that are triggered by the presence of double-stranded RNA.</p>
<p>During the infection, rotavirus produces mRNA for both protein translation and genome replication. Most of the rotavirus proteins accumulate in structures known as <a href="viroplasm" title="wikilink">viroplasms</a>, where the RNA is replicated and the DLPs are assembled. Viroplasms are electron-dense structures found as early as two hours after virus infection around the cell nucleus. Viroplasms are viral factories and are thought to be formed by two viral non-structural proteins, NSP5 and NSP2. Inhibition of NSP5 by <a href="RNA_interference" title="wikilink">RNA interference</a> results in a sharp decrease in rotavirus replication. The DLPs migrate to the endoplasmic reticulum where they obtain their third, outer layer (formed by VP7 and VP4). The progeny viruses are released from the cell by lysis.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="pathogenesis">Pathogenesis</h2>
<p>Rotavirus gastroenteritis is a self-limiting, mild to severe disease characterized by <a href="vomiting" class="uri" title="wikilink">vomiting</a>, watery <a href="diarrhoea" class="uri" title="wikilink">diarrhoea</a>, and low-grade <a href="fever" class="uri" title="wikilink">fever</a>. The infective dose is 10&lt;U+2013&gt;100 infectious viral particles. Large numbers of virus are in the faeces (10<sup>8</sup>&lt;U+2013&gt;10<sup>10</sup> infectious particles per ml), and infection can be readily acquired through contaminated hands, objects, or utensils. <img src="Rotavirus_infected_gut.jpg" title="fig:Electron micrograph of a rotavirus infected enterocyte (top) compared to an uninfected cell (bottom). The bar = approx. 500 nM" alt="Electron micrograph of a rotavirus infected enterocyte (top) compared to an uninfected cell (bottom). The bar = approx. 500 nM" width="250" /> The virus infects <a href="enterocyte" title="wikilink">enterocytes</a> of the <a href="Intestinal_villus" title="wikilink">villi</a> of the <a href="small_intestine" title="wikilink">small intestine</a>, leading to structural changes of the <a href="epithelium" class="uri" title="wikilink">epithelium</a> and diarrhea. The result of this infection is complex, and it is affected by an interaction of host and viral factors. Rotavirus diarrhoea is caused by several mechanisms which include: malabsorption that occurs secondary to the destruction of enterocytes, a reduced supply of blood to the cells that line the small intestine, an activation of the enteric nervous system, and the flow of fluid into the gut from the tissues and blood that is caused by the rotavirus non-structural protein, NSP4, which is an <a href="enterotoxin" class="uri" title="wikilink">enterotoxin</a>. NSP4 causes an age and dose-dependent diarrhoea in young rodents that is similar to the natural infection. NSP4 also causes cells to become permeable and damages them. Antibody to NSP4 protects mouse pups from diarrhoea induced by different serotypes of rotaviruses.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> The incubation period ranges from one to three days. Symptoms often start with vomiting followed by four to eight days of diarrhoea. Recovery is usually complete. However, severe diarrhoea <em>without</em> fluid and electrolyte replacement may result in death.</p>
<h2 id="epidemiology">Epidemiology</h2>
<p>&quot;Infantile diarrhoea&quot;, &quot;winter diarrhoea&quot;, &quot;stomach 'flu&quot;, &quot;acute nonbacterial infectious gastroenteritis&quot;, and &quot;acute viral gastroenteritis&quot; are other names applied to this disease. Humans of all ages are susceptible to rotavirus infection, but children six months to two years of age, the elderly, and the immunocompromised are particularly susceptible to more severe symptoms. Rotaviruses are transmitted by the <a href="fecal-oral_route" title="wikilink">fecal-oral route</a>. Person-to-person spread through contaminated hands is probably the most important means by which rotaviruses are transmitted in close communities such as pediatric and geriatric wards, day care centers and family homes.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> Infected food handlers may contaminate foods that require handling and no further cooking, such as salads, fruits, and hors d'oeuvres. Rotaviruses are quite stable in the environment and have been found in estuary samples at levels as high as 1&lt;U+2013&gt;5 infectious particles per gallon. Sanitary measures adequate for <a href="bacteria" class="uri" title="wikilink">bacteria</a> and <a href="parasite" title="wikilink">parasites</a> seem to be ineffective in endemic control of rotavirus, as similar incidence of rotavirus infection is observed in countries with both high and low health standards.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> <img src="Rotavirus_seasonal_distribution.jpg" title="fig:The seasonal variation of rotavirus A infections in England.

It is the leading cause of severe diarrhoea among infants and children, being responsible for about 20% of cases, and accounts for about half of the cases requiring hospitalization.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> Boys are twice as likely to be admitted to hospital than girls,<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a><a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a><a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a><a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a> but the reason for this is not understood.<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a> Almost every child has been infected with rotavirus by age five.<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a> Over three million cases of rotavirus gastroenteritis occur annually in the U.S.<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a> In temperate areas, it occurs primarily in the winter, but in the tropics it occurs throughout the year.<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a><a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a> The number attributable to food contamination is unknown.<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a></p>
<p>Group B rotavirus, also called adult diarrhoea rotavirus or ADRV, has caused major epidemics of severe diarrhoea affecting thousands of persons of all ages in China. In a group B epidemic in China in 1982, more than a million people were affected.<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a> Group B rotavirus has also been identified after the Chinese epidemics from Calcutta, India in 1998 and this strain was named CAL. Unlike ADRV, the CAL strain is endemic and does not cause known epidemics.<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a></p>
<p>Group C rotavirus has been associated with rare and sporadic cases of diarrhoea in children in many countries.

<p>Specific diagnosis of the disease is made by identification of the virus in the patient's stool. <a href="Enzyme_immunoassay" title="wikilink">Enzyme immunoassay</a> (EIA) is the test most widely used to screen clinical specimens, and several commercial kits are available for group A rotavirus. <a href="Electron_microscopy" title="wikilink">Electron microscopy</a> and <a href="polyacrylamide_gel_electrophoresis" title="wikilink">polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis</a> are used in some laboratories in addition or as an alternative to EIA.<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a> A reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (<a href="RT-PCR" class="uri" title="wikilink">RT-PCR</a>) has been developed to detect and identify all groups and known serotypes of human rotaviruses.<a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="treatment">Treatment</h2>
<p>There is no cure for rotavirus, so treatment of the disease is aimed at managing the symptoms. Depending on the severity of these treatment consists of <a href="Oral_rehydration_therapy" title="wikilink">oral rehydration</a> with water, or fluids containing sugars and salts.<a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a> About one out of every 40 children develops severe enough dehydration to require hospitalisation. In these children fluids are given <a href="intravenous" title="wikilink">intravenously</a> or nasogastricly and laboratory tests to monitor the child's <a href="electrolyte" class="uri" title="wikilink">electrolyte</a> levels and sugar in the blood are carried out.<a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="vaccines">Vaccines</h2>
<p>In 1998 a rotavirus vaccine was licensed for use in the United States. Clinical trials in the United States, Finland, and Venezuela had found it to be 80 to 100% effective at preventing severe diarrhoea caused by group A rotavirus, and researchers had detected no statistically significant serious adverse effects. The manufacturer of the vaccine, however, withdrew it from the market in 1999, after it was discovered that the vaccine may have contributed to an increased risk for <a href="Intussusception_(medical_disorder)" title="wikilink">intussusception</a>, or bowel obstruction, in one of every 12,000 vaccinated infants. The experience provoked intense debate about the relative risks and benefits of a rotavirus vaccine.<a href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a> In 2006, two vaccines against Rotavirus infection were shown to be safe and effective in children: Rotarix by <a href="GlaxoSmithKline" class="uri" title="wikilink">GlaxoSmithKline</a><a href="#fn67" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a> and RotaTeq by <a href="Merck_&amp;_Co.,_Inc." title="wikilink">Merck</a>.<a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a> Both are taken orally and contain disabled live virus. <img src="Poliodrops.jpg" title="fig:Child receiving a live vaccine" alt="Child receiving a live vaccine" width="200" /> RotaTeq is a live, oral pentavalent vaccine that contains five rotaviruses produced by <a href="reassortment" class="uri" title="wikilink">reassortment</a>. The rotavirus parent strains of the reassortants were isolated from human and bovine hosts. Four reassortant rotaviruses express one of the outer capsid, VP7, proteins (serotypes G1, G2, G3, or G4) from the human rotavirus parent strain and the attachment protein VP4 (type P7) from the bovine rotavirus parent strain. The fifth reassortant virus expresses the attachment protein VP4, (type P1A), from the human rotavirus parent strain and the outer capsid protein VP7 (serotype G6) from the bovine rotavirus parent strain.</p>
<p>In February 2006, the <a href="U.S._Food_and_Drug_Administration" title="wikilink">U.S. Food and Drug Administration</a> approved RotaTeq for use in the United States. Merck announced a price of $187.50 for the standard three-dose regimen; this is much more expensive than other standard childhood immunisations and, even allowing for discounts, will probably prevent widespread use of the vaccine in poor countries. However, Merck is selling vaccines at dramatically lower prices in developing world countries and is working with a range of partners including the Rotavirus Vaccine Project, PATH, (Program for Appropriate Technology in Health) and other governmental and non-governmental organisations to develop and implement mechanisms for providing access to this vaccine in the developing world.<a href="#fn69" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref69"><sup>69</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="epidemics">Epidemics</h2>
<p><img src="Group_C_Rotavirus.jpg" title="fig:Rotavirus C particles clumped by antibodies" alt="Rotavirus C particles clumped by antibodies" width="200" /> Outbreaks of group A rotavirus diarrhea are common among hospitalised infants, young children attending day care centres, and elderly persons in nursing homes. Among adults, multiple foods served in banquets were implicated in two outbreaks. An outbreak due to contaminated municipal water occurred in <a href="Colorado" class="uri" title="wikilink">Colorado</a>, 1981.<a href="#fn70" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a></p>
<p>Several large epidemics of group B rotavirus involving millions of persons as a result of sewage contamination of drinking water supplies have occurred in <a href="China" class="uri" title="wikilink">China</a> since 1982.<a href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a><a href="#fn72" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref72"><sup>72</sup></a> Although to date outbreaks caused by group B rotavirus have been confined to mainland China, seroepidemiological surveys have indicated lack of immunity to this group of virus in the US. Recent studies led to the identification of group B rotavirus occurring at a sporadic frequency in <a href="Calcutta" class="uri" title="wikilink">Calcutta</a>, India and subsequently from other Asian countries.<a href="#fn73" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref73"><sup>73</sup></a></p>
<p>Rotavirus C had been previously implicated in rare and isolated cases of gastroenteritis. However, it has caused many epidemics among school children, particularly in <a href="Japan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Japan</a>.<a href="#fn74" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref74"><sup>74</sup></a><a href="#fn75" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref75"><sup>75</sup></a><a href="#fn76" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref76"><sup>76</sup></a></p>
<p>During 2005 the largest recorded epidemic of diarrhoea occurred in <a href="Nicaragua" class="uri" title="wikilink">Nicaragua</a>. After a detailed investigation this unusual large and severe outbreak was found to be associated with mutations in the rotavirus A genome, possibly helping the virus escape the prevalent immunity in the population which had no protection against this type.<a href="#fn77" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref77"><sup>77</sup></a> A similar large outbreak occurred in <a href="Brazil" class="uri" title="wikilink">Brazil</a> in 1977.<a href="#fn78" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref78"><sup>78</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="complications">Complications</h2>
<p>Rotavirus infections rarely cause other complications in the well managed child.<a href="#fn79" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref79"><sup>79</sup></a> There are reports in the literature of rare complications involving the <a href="central_nervous_system" title="wikilink">central nervous system</a> (CNS) where rotavirus was detected in the fluid of the CNS in cases of <a href="encephalitis" class="uri" title="wikilink">encephalitis</a> and <a href="meningitis" class="uri" title="wikilink">meningitis</a>,<a href="#fn80" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref80"><sup>80</sup></a><a href="#fn81" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref81"><sup>81</sup></a><a href="#fn82" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref82"><sup>82</sup></a> but these complications are uncommon even in the developing countries.<a href="#fn83" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref83"><sup>83</sup></a> Repeated rotavirus infections may increase the risk of <a href="celiac" class="uri" title="wikilink">celiac</a> disease in genetically susceptible children. A case-control study of infants with a genetic predisposition for celiac disease observed that the risk of developing the disease increased twofold in children who were infected with rotavirus once and almost fourfold for those who were infected with it multiple times.<a href="#fn84" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref84"><sup>84</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="rotavirus-infections-of-animals">Rotavirus infections of animals</h2>
<p>Rotaviruses infect and cause diarhoea in the young of many species of animals. They have been shown to commonly infect mammals; apes,<a href="#fn85" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref85"><sup>85</sup></a> cattle,<a href="#fn86" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref86"><sup>86</sup></a> pigs,<a href="#fn87" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref87"><sup>87</sup></a> sheep,<a href="#fn88" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref88"><sup>88</sup></a> rats,<a href="#fn89" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref89"><sup>89</sup></a> cats and dogs,<a href="#fn90" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref90"><sup>90</sup></a> mice,<a href="#fn91" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref91"><sup>91</sup></a> rabbits<a href="#fn92" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref92"><sup>92</sup></a> and birds including chickens and turkeys.<a href="#fn93" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref93"><sup>93</sup></a> These rotaviruses are a potential reservoir for genetic exchange with human rotaviruses. There is evidence that animal rotaviruses can infect humans, either by direct transmission of the virus or by contributing one or several RNA segments to reassortants with human strains.<a href="#fn94" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref94"><sup>94</sup></a><a href="#fn95" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref95"><sup>95</sup></a> Rotaviruses are a major cause of economic loss to farmers because of costs of treatment associated with high morbidity and mortality rates.<a href="#fn96" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref96"><sup>96</sup></a></p>
