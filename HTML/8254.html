The opponent was the WBC Lightweight champion and <em>Ring</em> No. 1-ranked Lightweight, <a href="Antonio_DeMarco" title="wikilink">Antonio DeMarco</a>. Broner started the fight off boxing DeMarco, working behind his jab and using his shoulder roll defense to frustrate DeMarco. In the early rounds, Broner was able to hit DeMarco with his quick counter left hook several times. By the 4th round, Broner and DeMarco decided to stand toe-to-toe in the center of the ring and trade punches. It was Broner who got the better of the inside fight though, with his speed and quick combination punching taking its toll on DeMarco. By the 6th round, DeMarco had cut and his face swollen in several places, as he still opted to stand toe-to-toe with Broner, with Broner barely missing his right uppercuts and working the body of DeMarco as well. Then, in the 8th round, Broner opened up another fast combination which hurt DeMarco and than a swinging left uppercut sent DeMarco to the canvas for the first time in his career. DeMarco's corner stopped the fight right after the knockdown, giving Broner his second world title in as many weight classes.</p>
<p>CompuBox had Broner landing 241 of his 451 total punches.

Broner is set to make his first title defense on February 16, 2013, at Boardwalk Hall in <a href="Atlantic_City" title="wikilink">Atlantic City</a>. Having no luck at getting fellow Lightweight champion Ricky Burns to fight him in February, Broner is set to fight <em>Ring</em> No. 6-ranked Lightweight <a href="Gavin_Rees" title="wikilink">Gavin Rees</a>.</p>
<p>Broner stopped Rees in five rounds, after Rees' corner threw in the towel at the end of the round. Rees had some success early, when Broner was clowning and showboating, landing jabs and body shots. By round 3, Broner was in complete control, hitting Rees with his counter left hook at will, as well as hitting Rees at will on the inside. In the 4th round, Broner sent Rees to the canvas with a quick right uppercut, and landed more combinations as the round ended.

<h4 id="broner-vs.-malignaggi">Broner vs. Malignaggi</h4>
<p>After failing to secure a fight with fellow Lightweight champion Ricky Burns, Broner decided to move up two weight classes to Welterweight in order to fight two division champion <a href="Paulie_Malignaggi" title="wikilink">Paulie Malignaggi</a>. Malignaggi was the WBA Welterweight Champion and ''Ring'' No. 6 ranked Welterweight.

Broner found his timing by the middle of the fight, effectively timing Malignaggi with lead right hands. CompuBox had the totaled Broner landing 246 (47%) of his total punches, and 214 (51%) of power punches. While Malignaggi landed 120 jabs throughout the fight, but only 94 (25%) power punches.

<h4 id="broner-vs.-maidana">Broner vs. Maidana</h4>
<p>Broner made his first defense at Welterweight against former Light Welterweight champion <a href="Marcos_Maidana" title="wikilink">Marcos Maidana</a>. Broner had stated before the fight that he did not take training camp seriously for the Malignaggi fight, and that he was going to make a statement in his first defense. From the opening bell, Maidana swarmed Broner, punishing him to the body and the head. In the second round, a left hook sent Broner down for the first time in his career. Broner recovered and seemed to be on the verge of taking control over a tiring Maidana, but a Maidana right to the body followed by a left hook to the head once again put Broner down in round 8. Maidana punished a humbled Broner for the remainder of the fight, winning the fight via unanimous decision and giving Broner his first loss as a pro.</p>
