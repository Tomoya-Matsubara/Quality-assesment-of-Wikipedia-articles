<p>Prior to the <a href="2014_NBA_draft" title="wikilink">2014 NBA draft</a>, Frazier worked out for several <a href="NBA" class="uri" title="wikilink">NBA</a> teams, including the <a href="Phoenix_Suns" title="wikilink">Phoenix Suns</a>, <a href="New_York_Knicks" title="wikilink">New York Knicks</a>, <a href="Boston_Celtics" title="wikilink">Boston Celtics</a>, <a href="Minnesota_Timberwolves" title="wikilink">Minnesota Timberwolves</a>, <a href="Philadelphia_76ers" title="wikilink">Philadelphia 76ers</a> and <a href="Washington_Wizards" title="wikilink">Washington Wizards</a>. Philadelphia worked him out two times, and head coach <a href="Brett_Brown" title="wikilink">Brett Brown</a> ultimately invited him to play for them at the <a href="2014_NBA_Summer_League" title="wikilink">2014 Las Vegas Summer League</a> within an hour after he was not selected in the draft. The move made comparisons with <a href="Khalif_Wyatt" title="wikilink">Khalif Wyatt</a>, who played for the 76ers through the 2013 edition of the summer league, and attended <a href="Temple_University" title="wikilink">Temple University</a> in the <a href="Philadelphia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Philadelphia</a> area.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a> Frazier said, &quot;When [the coaches] reached out to me and said they wanted me for the summer league, I was ready to go for it. I just want to go out, have fun, play my hardest and show Philly and other teams what they can get from me.&quot;.<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a> According to the 76ers assistant coach, Chad Iske, he impressed the team's staff by his &quot;poise&quot; and experience at the higher level.<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a> At Las Vegas, Frazier averaged 3.4 points, 4.0 rebounds, 2.0 assists and 1.2 steals in five games.<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a> On September 29, 2014, the <a href="Boston_Celtics" title="wikilink">Boston Celtics</a> signed Frazier to a non-guaranteed, training camp deal with the likely notion of auditioning with the <a href="Maine_Red_Claws" title="wikilink">Maine Red Claws</a> in the future.<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a><a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a><a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a> On October 27, 2014, he was waived by the Celtics after appearing in four preseason games where he went 1-for-2 from the field and recorded two rebounds, four assists and four steals.<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a> As expected, four days later, he was acquired by the Maine Red Claws as an affiliate player.<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a> Frazier opened his season in the D-League by contributing 18 points, 9 assists, and 4 rebounds against the <a href="Oklahoma_City_Blue" title="wikilink">Oklahoma City Blue</a>. He also shot 12-of-12 on free throws, helping the team win their first game.<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a></p>
