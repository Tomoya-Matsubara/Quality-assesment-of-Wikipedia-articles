<p><strong>Aberdour Castle</strong> is located in the village of <a href="Aberdour" title="wikilink">Easter Aberdour</a>, <a href="Fife" class="uri" title="wikilink">Fife</a>, <a href="Scotland" class="uri" title="wikilink">Scotland</a>. Parts of the <a href="castle" class="uri" title="wikilink">castle</a> date from around 1200, making Aberdour one of the two oldest datable standing castles in Scotland, along with <a href="Castle_Sween" title="wikilink">Castle Sween</a> in <a href="Argyll" class="uri" title="wikilink">Argyll</a>, which was built at around the same time.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>The earliest part of the castle comprised a modest hall house, on a site overlooking the Dour Burn. Over the next 400 years, the castle was successively expanded according to contemporary architectural ideas. The hall house became a <a href="tower_house" title="wikilink">tower house</a> in the 15th century, and was extended twice in the 16th century. The final addition was made around 1635, with refined <a href="Renaissance_architecture" title="wikilink">Renaissance</a> details, and the whole was complemented by a <a href="walled_garden" title="wikilink">walled garden</a> to the east and <a href="Terrace_(gardening)" title="wikilink">terraced</a> gardens to the south. The terraces, dating from the mid-16th century, form one of the oldest gardens in Scotland,<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> and offer extensive views across the <a href="Firth_of_Forth" title="wikilink">Firth of Forth</a> to <a href="Edinburgh" class="uri" title="wikilink">Edinburgh</a>.</p>
<p>The castle is largely the creation of the <a href="Clan_Douglas" title="wikilink">Douglas</a> <a href="Earl_of_Morton" title="wikilink">Earls of Morton</a>, who held Aberdour from the 14th century. The earls used Aberdour as a second home until 1642, when their primary residence, <a href="Dalkeith_Palace" title="wikilink">Dalkeith House</a>, was sold. A fire in the late 17th century was followed by some repairs, but in 1725 the family purchased nearby Aberdour House, and the medieval castle was allowed to fall into decay. Today, only the 17th-century wing remains roofed, while the tower has mostly collapsed. Aberdour Castle is now in the care of <a href="Historic_Scotland" title="wikilink">Historic Scotland</a>, and is open to the public all year.</p>

<p>The barony of Aberdour was acquired in 1126, by Sir Alan de Mortimer, on his marriage to Anicea, daughter of Sir John de Vipont.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> Sir Alan built St Fillan's Church, which still stands, next to the castle, in around 1140, and his family probably built the original hall house in around 1200,<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> or possibly even earlier.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> In 1216, another Alan de Mortimer is recorded granting land to the monks of <a href="Inchcolm_Abbey" title="wikilink">Inchcolm Abbey</a>.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> There is no record of what happened to the de Mortimers, but in the early 14th century, King <a href="Robert_I_of_Scotland" title="wikilink">Robert the Bruce</a> granted Aberdour to his kinsman, <a href="Thomas_Randolph,_Earl_of_Moray" title="wikilink">Thomas Randolph, Earl of Moray</a> (d. 1332).

However, he was compelled to spend much of his fortune in the royal interest, leading him into financial difficulty, and forcing him to sell Dalkeith to the <a href="Francis_Scott,_2nd_Earl_of_Buccleuch" title="wikilink">Earl of Buccleuch</a> in 1642.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> Earl William built the Renaissance east wing at Aberdour, probably around 1635.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> It was certainly standing in 1647, when an inventory records luxurious furniture, carpets, and tapestries.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> The walled garden was also built in the 1630s, and improvements made to the terraces.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> Aberdour was therefore a suitable principal residence for the Earls after the sale of Dalkeith.</p>

<h2 id="description">Description</h2>
<p><img src="Aberdour_Castle_plan.png" title="fig:Ground-floor plan of the castle" alt="Ground-floor plan of the castle" width="300" /> The castle originally comprised the 12th- or 13th-century hall house, which was extended in the 15th century. In the 16th century the central range was built to the south of the tower house, and new inner and outer courtyard walls were constructed.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> The east part of the inner courtyard wall is reduced to foundations, but the base of a round tower and a porter's lodge survive.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> To the west, the inner courtyard wall remains, enclosing the former service courtyard, which comprises a brewery and bakehouse, with ovens.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> The east range was added in the 17th century, along the south edge of the outer courtyard. The castle was originally approached from the north, with the entrance moved to the west, along with the 17th-century gate, when the Aberdour railway line was constructed in 1890.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="the-tower-house">The tower house</h3>
<p>The tower house measures  by  on a skewed rectangular plan.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> The lower two storeys comprise the oldest part of the castle, which can be dated to around 1200, while the upper parts are of the 15th century. The date for the original building is based on several pieces of evidence. The cubical blocks of masonry, the flat <a href="buttress" class="uri" title="wikilink">buttress</a> at the north-east, and the splaying, or widening, of the base of the walls, are all indicative of this date.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> The collapsed part of the south wall also formerly contained an early 13th-century style double-<a href="lancet_window" title="wikilink">lancet window</a>.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a> The original structure, of a type known as a hall house, was probably of two or three storeys, comprising a first-floor hall over an unvaulted basement, and may have been surrounded by a defensive timber <a href="stockade" class="uri" title="wikilink">stockade</a> or enclosure.<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> The 15th-century rebuilding added two upper floors, and rearranged the interior. <a href="Vault_(architecture)" title="wikilink">Vaulted</a> basements, including a kitchen, and a spiral stair were inserted, and the heightened wall was topped by a parapet with <a href="machicolation" title="wikilink">machicolations</a>; spaces through which objects could be dropped on attackers at the base of the wall.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a> The tower suffered major collapses in 1844 and 1919, and today just the basement survives, with only a small section of the south-east wall standing to its full height.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a></p>

<h3 id="the-central-range">The central range</h3>
<p>The central range was begun around 1500, possibly as a two-storey building containing a great hall, although only fragments of this building remain.<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a> The south entrance to the tower house was blocked up, and replaced with a ground floor entrance from the east. A new stair tower, with a broad spiral stair, was built at the south-east corner. Originally topped by a conical roof, this stair gave access to the upper floors in the tower, and to the central range.<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a> Around 1570, the 4th Earl of Morton rebuilt the block, extending it further south to form new apartments. This block, forming the present three-storey central range, includes a vaulted kitchen and cellar in the basement, with suites of rooms above. The two bedrooms on the first floor each have their own closets and <a href="garderobe" title="wikilink">garderobes</a>, or privies. The west apartment is accessed from the terraced garden, via another stair to the south-west, and has a private stair which led up to another chamber above, suggesting that these were the Earl and Countesses apartments.<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a> The upper storey, whose timber floor is now missing, comprised three more apartments, including one over the stair. The exterior of the block is decorated with a horizontal decorative strip of masonry known as a <a href="string_course" title="wikilink">string course</a>. One first-floor window is decorated with carved stone <a href="pilaster" title="wikilink">pilasters</a> and <a href="strapwork" class="uri" title="wikilink">strapwork</a>,<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a> in a similar style to windows at <a href="Edinburgh_Castle" title="wikilink">Edinburgh Castle</a> and Drochil Castle, in the <a href="Scottish_Borders" title="wikilink">Borders</a>, both of which were built under Morton's Regency.<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a></p>

It is the only part of the castle still roofed. The first floor of the wing is occupied by a <a href="long_gallery" title="wikilink">long gallery</a>, accessed from the central range, with stables and storerooms below. The long gallery was used for entertaining, and, in 1647, is recorded as containing 46 pictures and a <a href="harpsichord" class="uri" title="wikilink">harpsichord</a>, among other furniture.<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a> In the south-east wing are three chambers, one on each floor, linked by a spiral stair.

The east window of the long gallery is decorated with pilasters and a pediment.

<p>There were gardens at Aberdour Castle from at least 1540.<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a> The terraced garden dates from the time of the 4th Earl of Morton, who succeeded in 1553, and comprises four broad L-shaped terraces. At the bottom of the terraces was an orchard, laid out in 1690, and recently replanted.<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a> The extent of the terracing was only rediscovered following excavations in the 1970s, after parts of the garden had been in use as a <a href="market_garden" title="wikilink">market garden</a>.<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a> Archaeological investigations were undertaken between 1977 and 1980, to determine whether the lower terraces, which were depicted on a map of 1740, had indeed existed. Although the foundations of the terraces were found, the remains could not be precisely dated, but are thought to have been constructed in the second half of the 16th century.<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a> The high retaining walls were rebuilt in 1981,<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a> and the terraces were laid with grass, since the excavations had not revealed any evidence of historic planting schemes.<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a></p>

<p>The 17th-century walled garden covers around , with walls up to  high. It lies to the west of the outer courtyard, and was originally entered from doors in the south-west and north-east corners. These doors have carved pediments, with strapwork and the Douglas heart emblem over the west door, which led to the terraces. The east door led to St. Fillan's Church, and is carved with the date 1632, together with a <a href="monogram" class="uri" title="wikilink">monogram</a> of the initials of the Earl and Countess.<a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a> A kitchen garden was located across the Kirk Lane, and <a href="bee_bole" title="wikilink">bee boles</a> are located in the walls.

It is uncertain how much of Gibbs' proposals were executed, although the doorway has a surround in Gibbs' style.<a href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a> By the 20th century the house was disused, and was redeveloped as private flats in the 1990s. The house is Category A listed,<a href="#fn72" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref72"><sup>72</sup></a> and formerly had its own extensive gardens, which included the surviving  high <a href="obelisk" class="uri" title="wikilink">obelisk</a> of 1744&lt;U+2013&gt;45, built by the 13th Earl to be visible from his estate at <a href="Dalmahoy" class="uri" title="wikilink">Dalmahoy</a>, across the Firth of Forth.<a href="#fn73" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref73"><sup>73</sup></a></p>
