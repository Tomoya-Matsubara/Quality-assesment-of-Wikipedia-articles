<p>Although <em>Casablanca</em> was an <a href="A-list" class="uri" title="wikilink">A-list</a> film with established stars and first-rate writers, no one involved with its production expected it to be anything out of the ordinary.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> It was just one of hundreds of pictures produced by <a href="Cinema_of_the_United_States" title="wikilink">Hollywood</a> every year. <em>Casablanca</em> had its world premiere on November 26, 1942, in <a href="New_York_City" title="wikilink">New York City</a> and was released on January 23, 1943, in the <a href="United_States" title="wikilink">United States</a>.

<h2 id="plot">Plot</h2>
<p>It is early December 1941. American <a href="expatriate" class="uri" title="wikilink">expatriate</a> Rick Blaine is the proprietor of an upscale nightclub and gambling den in <a href="Casablanca" class="uri" title="wikilink">Casablanca</a>. &quot;Rick's Caf&lt;U+00E9&gt; Am&lt;U+00E9&gt;ricain&quot; attracts a varied clientele: <a href="Vichy_France" title="wikilink">Vichy French</a>, Italian, and German officials; <a href="Refugee#World_War_II_and_UNHCR" title="wikilink">refugees</a> desperate to reach the still neutral United States; and those who prey on them. Although Rick professes to be neutral in all matters, it is later revealed he <a href="Gunrunning" title="wikilink">ran guns</a> to <a href="Second_Italo-Ethiopian_War" title="wikilink">Ethiopia</a> during its war with Italy and fought on the <a href="Republican_faction_(Spanish_Civil_War)" title="wikilink">Loyalist</a> side against the fascist <a href="Francoist_Spain" title="wikilink">Nationalists</a> in the <a href="Spanish_Civil_War" title="wikilink">Spanish Civil War</a>.</p>

<p>Petty crook Ugarte shows up and boasts to Rick of &quot;letters of transit&quot; obtained by murdering two German couriers. The papers allow the bearer to travel freely around German-controlled Europe and to neutral <a href="Portugal_in_World_War_II" title="wikilink">Portugal</a>, and are thus almost priceless to the refugees stranded in Casablanca. Ugarte plans to sell them at the club later that night. Before he can, he is arrested by the local police under the command of Vichy Captain Louis Renault, an unabashedly corrupt official. Ugarte dies in custody without revealing that he had entrusted the letters to Rick.</p>
<p>At this point, the reason for Rick's bitterness&lt;U+2014&gt;his former lover, <a href="Norway" title="wikilink">Norwegian</a> Ilsa Lund&lt;U+2014&gt;walks into his establishment. Upon spotting Rick's friend and house pianist, Sam, Ilsa implores him to play <a href="As_Time_Goes_By_(song)" title="wikilink">&quot;As Time Goes By&quot;</a>. Rick storms over, furious that Sam has disobeyed his order never to perform that song, and is stunned to see Ilsa. She is accompanied by her husband, Victor Laszlo, a renowned fugitive <a href="Czech_resistance_to_Nazi_occupation" title="wikilink">Czech Resistance</a> leader. They need the letters to escape to America, where he can continue his work. German Major Strasser has come to Casablanca to see that Laszlo does not succeed.</p>
<p>When Laszlo makes inquiries, Ferrari, a major underworld figure and Rick's friendly business rival, divulges his suspicion that Rick has the letters. In private, Rick refuses to sell at any price, telling Laszlo to ask his wife the reason. They are interrupted when Strasser leads a group of officers in singing &quot;<a href="Die_Wacht_am_Rhein" title="wikilink">Die Wacht am Rhein</a>&quot;. Laszlo orders the house band to defiantly play &quot;<a href="La_Marseillaise" title="wikilink">La Marseillaise</a>&quot;. When the band looks to Rick, he nods his head. Laszlo starts singing, alone at first, then patriotic fervor grips the crowd and everyone joins in, drowning out the Germans. In retaliation, Strasser has Renault close the club.</p>

<p>That night, Ilsa confronts Rick in the deserted caf&lt;U+00E9&gt;. When he refuses to give her the letters, she threatens him with a gun, but then confesses that she still loves him. She explains that when they first met and fell in love in Paris in 1940, she believed that her husband had been killed attempting to escape from a <a href="concentration_camp" title="wikilink">concentration camp</a>. Later, while preparing to flee with Rick from the imminent <a href="Battle_of_France" title="wikilink">fall of the city</a> to the German army, she learned that Laszlo was alive and in hiding. She left Rick without explanation to tend her ill husband.</p>
<p>Rick's bitterness dissolves. He agrees to help, leading her to believe that she will stay with him when Laszlo leaves. When Laszlo unexpectedly shows up, having narrowly escaped a police raid on a Resistance meeting, Rick has waiter Carl spirit Ilsa away. Laszlo, aware of Rick's love for Ilsa, tries to persuade him to use the letters to take her to safety. When the police arrest Laszlo on a minor, trumped-up charge, Rick convinces Renault to release him by promising to set him up for a much more serious crime: possession of the letters of transit. To allay Renault's suspicions, Rick explains he and Ilsa will be leaving for America. When Renault tries to arrest Laszlo as arranged, Rick forces him at gunpoint to assist in their escape. At the last moment, Rick makes Ilsa board the plane to <a href="Lisbon" class="uri" title="wikilink">Lisbon</a> with her husband, telling her she would regret it if she stayed - &quot;Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but soon and for the rest of your life.&quot;</p>
<p>Strasser, tipped off by Renault, drives up alone. Rick kills him when he tries to intervene. When the police arrive, Renault pauses, then tells them to &quot;round up the usual suspects.&quot; Renault suggests to Rick that they join the <a href="Free_French" title="wikilink">Free French</a> in <a href="Brazzaville" class="uri" title="wikilink">Brazzaville</a>. As they walk away into the fog, Rick says, &quot;Louis, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship.&quot;</p>

<p>The entire picture was shot in the studio, except for the sequence showing Major Strasser's arrival, which was filmed at <a href="Van_Nuys_Airport" title="wikilink">Van Nuys Airport</a>, and a few short clips of stock footage views of Paris.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> The street used for the exterior shots had recently been built for another film, <em><a href="The_Desert_Song" title="wikilink">The Desert Song</a></em>,<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> and <a href="Set_dresser" title="wikilink">redressed</a> for the Paris <a href="flashback_(literary_technique)" title="wikilink">flashbacks</a>. It remained on the Warners <a href="backlot" class="uri" title="wikilink">backlot</a> until the 1960s. The set for Rick's was built in three unconnected parts, so the internal layout of the building is indeterminate. In a number of scenes, the camera looks through a wall from the cafe area into Rick's office. The background of the final scene, which shows a <a href="Lockheed_Model_12_Electra_Junior" title="wikilink">Lockheed Model 12 Electra Junior</a> airplane with personnel walking around it, was staged using <a href="Dwarfism" title="wikilink">little person</a> <a href="extra_(actor)" title="wikilink">extras</a> and a proportionate cardboard plane.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> Fog was used to mask the model's unconvincing appearance.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> Nevertheless, the <a href="Disney&#39;s_Hollywood_Studios" title="wikilink">Disney's Hollywood Studios</a> theme park in <a href="Orlando,_Florida" title="wikilink">Orlando, Florida</a> purchased a Lockheed 12A for its <a href="Great_Movie_Ride" title="wikilink">Great Movie Ride</a> attraction, and initially claimed that it was the actual plane used in the film.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> Film critic <a href="Roger_Ebert" title="wikilink">Roger Ebert</a> called <a href="Hal_Wallis" title="wikilink">Hal Wallis</a> the &quot;key creative force&quot; for his attention to the details of production (down to insisting on a real parrot in the Blue Parrot bar).<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a></p>
<p>The difference between Bergman's and Bogart's height caused some problems. She was some two inches (5 cm) taller than Bogart, and claimed Curtiz had Bogart stand on blocks or sit on cushions in their scenes together.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a></p>
<p>Later, there were plans for a further scene, showing Rick, Renault and a detachment of Free French soldiers on a ship, to incorporate the Allies' <a href="Operation_Torch" title="wikilink">1942 invasion of North Africa</a>. It proved too difficult to get Claude Rains for the shoot, and the scene was finally abandoned after <a href="David_O._Selznick" title="wikilink">David O.

<h3 id="writing">Writing</h3>
<p>The original play was inspired by a trip to Europe made by Murray Burnett and his wife in 1938, during which they visited Vienna shortly after the <a href="Anschluss" class="uri" title="wikilink">Anschluss</a> and were affected by the <a href="anti-Semitism" class="uri" title="wikilink">anti-Semitism</a> they saw. In the south of France, they went to a nightclub that had a multinational clientele, among them many exiles and refugees, and the prototype of Sam.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a><a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a></p>
<p>The first writers assigned to the script were twins <a href="Julius_J._Epstein" title="wikilink">Julius</a> and <a href="Philip_G._Epstein" title="wikilink">Philip Epstein</a>, who, against the wishes of <a href="Warner_Brothers" title="wikilink">Warner Brothers</a>, left at <a href="Frank_Capra" title="wikilink">Frank Capra</a>'s request early in 1942 to work on the <em><a href="Why_We_Fight" title="wikilink">Why We Fight</a></em> series in Washington, D.C.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a><a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a> While they were gone, the other credited writer, <a href="Howard_Koch_(screenwriter)" title="wikilink">Howard Koch</a>, was assigned; he produced some thirty to forty pages.<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> When the Epstein brothers returned after about a month, they were reassigned to <em>Casablanca</em> and&lt;U+2014&gt;contrary to what Koch claimed in two published books&lt;U+2014&gt;his work was not used.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a> In the final <a href="Warner_Bros." title="wikilink">Warner Bros.</a> budget for the film, the Epsteins were paid $30,416, while Koch earned $4,200.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a></p>
<p>In the play, the Ilsa character is an American named Lois Meredith; she does not meet Laszlo until after her relationship with Rick in Paris has ended. Rick is a lawyer. To make Rick's motivation more believable, Wallis, Curtiz, and the screenwriters decided to set the film before the <a href="attack_on_Pearl_Harbor" title="wikilink">attack on Pearl Harbor</a>.<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a></p>
<p>The uncredited <a href="Casey_Robinson" title="wikilink">Casey Robinson</a> assisted with three weeks of rewrites, including contributing the series of meetings between Rick and Ilsa in the cafe.<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a><a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a> Koch highlighted the political and melodramatic elements,<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a><a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a> while Curtiz seems to have favored the romantic parts, insisting on retaining the Paris flashbacks.<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a> Wallis wrote the final line, &quot;Louie, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship,&quot; after shooting had been completed. Bogart had to be called in a month after the end of filming to dub it.<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a></p>
<p>Despite the many writers, the film has what Ebert describes as a &quot;wonderfully unified and consistent&quot; script. Koch later claimed it was the tension between his own approach and Curtiz's which accounted for this: &quot;Surprisingly, these disparate approaches somehow meshed, and perhaps it was partly this tug of war between Curtiz and me that gave the film a certain balance.&quot;<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a> Julius Epstein would later note the screenplay contained &quot;more corn than in the states of Kansas and Iowa combined. But when corn works, there's nothing better.&quot;<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a></p>
<p>The film ran into some trouble with <a href="Joseph_Breen" title="wikilink">Joseph Breen</a> of the <a href="Production_Code_Administration" title="wikilink">Production Code Administration</a> (the Hollywood self-censorship body), who opposed the suggestions that Captain Renault extorted sexual favors from his supplicants, and that Rick and Ilsa had slept together in Paris.<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a> Extensive changes were made, with several lines of dialogue removed or altered. All direct references to sex were deleted; Renault's selling of visas for sex, and Rick and Ilsa's previous sexual relationship were implied elliptically rather than referenced explicitly.<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a> Also, in the original script, when Sam plays &quot;As Time Goes By&quot;, Rick remarks, &quot;What the &lt;U+2014&gt;&lt;U+2014&gt; are you playing?&quot;<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a> This line implying a curse word was removed at the behest of the Hays Office.</p>
<h3 id="direction">Direction</h3>
<p>Wallis' first choice for director was <a href="William_Wyler" title="wikilink">William Wyler</a>, but he was unavailable, so Wallis turned to his close friend <a href="Michael_Curtiz" title="wikilink">Michael Curtiz</a>.<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a> Curtiz was a Hungarian Jewish &lt;U+00E9&gt;migr&lt;U+00E9&gt;; he had come to the U.S. in the 1920s, but some of his family were refugees from Nazi Europe.</p>
<p><a href="Roger_Ebert" title="wikilink">Roger Ebert</a> has commented that in <em>Casablanca</em> &quot;very few shots... are memorable as shots,&quot; as Curtiz wanted images to express the story rather than to stand alone.<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a> He contributed relatively little to development of the plot. Casey Robinson said Curtiz &quot;knew nothing whatever about story ... he saw it in pictures, and you supplied the stories.&quot;<a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a></p>
<p>Critic <a href="Andrew_Sarris" title="wikilink">Andrew Sarris</a> called the film &quot;the most decisive exception to the <a href="auteur_theory" title="wikilink">auteur theory</a>&quot;,<a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a> of which Sarris was the most prominent proponent in the United States. <a href="Aljean_Harmetz" title="wikilink">Aljean Harmetz</a> has responded, &quot;nearly every Warner Bros. picture was an exception to the auteur theory&quot;.<a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a> Other critics give more credit to Curtiz. Sidney Rosenzweig, in his study of the director's work, sees the film as a typical example of Curtiz's highlighting of moral dilemmas.<a href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a></p>
<p>The <a href="second_unit" title="wikilink">second unit</a> <a href="Film_editing" title="wikilink">montages</a>, such as the opening sequence of the refugee trail and the invasion of France, were directed by <a href="Don_Siegel" title="wikilink">Don Siegel</a>.<a href="#fn67" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a></p>

Particular attention was paid to photographing Bergman. She was shot mainly from her preferred left side, often with a softening gauze filter and with <a href="catch_light" title="wikilink">catch lights</a> to make her eyes sparkle; the whole effect was designed to make her face seem &quot;ineffably sad and tender and nostalgic&quot;.<a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a> Bars of shadow across the characters and in the background variously imply imprisonment, the <a href="crucifix" class="uri" title="wikilink">crucifix</a>, the symbol of the <a href="Free_French_Forces" title="wikilink">Free French Forces</a> and emotional turmoil.<a href="#fn69" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref69"><sup>69</sup></a> Dark <em><a href="film_noir" title="wikilink">film noir</a></em> and <a href="expressionist" class="uri" title="wikilink">expressionist</a> lighting was used in several scenes, particularly towards the end of the picture.

<h3 id="music">Music</h3>
<p>The music was written by <a href="Max_Steiner" title="wikilink">Max Steiner</a>, who was best known for the <a href="film_score" title="wikilink">score</a> for <a href="Gone_with_the_Wind_(film)" title="wikilink"><em>Gone with the Wind</em></a>. The song &quot;<a href="As_Time_Goes_By_(song)" title="wikilink">As Time Goes By</a>&quot; by <a href="Herman_Hupfeld" title="wikilink">Herman Hupfeld</a> had been part of the story from the original play; Steiner wanted to write his own composition to replace it, but Bergman had already cut her hair short for her next role (Mar&lt;U+00ED&gt;a in <em><a href="For_Whom_the_Bell_Tolls_(film)" title="wikilink">For Whom the Bell Tolls</a></em>) and could not re-shoot the scenes which incorporated the song,<a href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a> so Steiner based the entire score on it and &quot;<a href="La_Marseillaise" title="wikilink">La Marseillaise</a>&quot;, the French <a href="national_anthem" title="wikilink">national anthem</a>, transforming them to reflect changing moods.<a href="#fn72" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref72"><sup>72</sup></a></p>
<p>Particularly notable is the &quot;duel of the songs&quot; between Strasser and Laszlo at Rick's cafe. In the soundtrack, &quot;La Marseillaise&quot; is played by a full orchestra. Originally, the opposing piece for this iconic sequence was to be the &quot;<a href="Horst_Wessel_Lied" title="wikilink">Horst Wessel Lied</a>&quot;, a Nazi anthem, but this was still under international copyright in non-Allied countries. Instead &quot;<a href="Die_Wacht_am_Rhein" title="wikilink">Die Wacht am Rhein</a>&quot; was used. The opening bars of the &quot;<a href="Deutschlandlied" class="uri" title="wikilink">Deutschlandlied</a>&quot;, the national anthem of Germany, are featured throughout the score as a motif to represent the Germans, much as &quot;La Marseillaise&quot; is used to represent the Allies.</p>

<p>The trade paper <em><a href="Variety_(magazine)" title="wikilink">Variety</a></em> commended the film's &quot;combination of fine performances, engrossing story and neat direction&quot; and the &quot;variety of moods, action, suspense, comedy and drama that makes <em>Casablanca</em> an A-1 entry at the <a href="Box_office" title="wikilink">b.o.</a>&quot;<a href="#fn84" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref84"><sup>84</sup></a> &quot;Film is splendid anti-Axis propaganda, particularly inasmuch as the propaganda is strictly a by-product of the principal action and contributes to it instead of getting in the way.&quot;<a href="#fn85" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref85"><sup>85</sup></a> The review also applauded the performances of Bergman and Henreid and note that &quot;Bogart, as might be expected, is more at ease as the bitter and cynical operator of a joint than as a lover, but handles both assignments with superb finesse.&quot;<a href="#fn86" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref86"><sup>86</sup></a></p>

<h3 id="lasting-influence">Lasting influence</h3>
<p>The film has grown in popularity. Murray Burnett called it &quot;true yesterday, true today, true tomorrow&quot;.<a href="#fn88" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref88"><sup>88</sup></a> By 1955, the film had brought in $6.8 million, making it the third most successful of Warners' wartime movies (behind <em><a href="Shine_On,_Harvest_Moon_(film)" title="wikilink">Shine On, Harvest Moon</a></em> and <em><a href="This_is_the_Army" title="wikilink">This is the Army</a></em>).<a href="#fn89" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref89"><sup>89</sup></a> On April 21, 1957, the <a href="Brattle_Theater" title="wikilink">Brattle Theater</a> of Cambridge, Massachusetts, showed the film as part of a season of old movies. It was so popular that it began a tradition of screening <em>Casablanca</em> during the week of final exams at <a href="Harvard_University" title="wikilink">Harvard University</a>, which continues to the present day. Other colleges have adopted the tradition. <a href="Todd_Gitlin" title="wikilink">Todd Gitlin</a>, a professor of sociology who had attended one of these screenings, has said that the experience was &quot;the acting out of my own personal rite of passage&quot;.<a href="#fn90" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref90"><sup>90</sup></a> The tradition helped the movie remain popular while other famous films of the 1940s have faded away. By 1977, <em>Casablanca</em> was the most frequently broadcast film on American television.<a href="#fn91" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref91"><sup>91</sup></a></p>
<p>On the film's 50th anniversary, the <em><a href="Los_Angeles_Times" title="wikilink">Los Angeles Times</a></em> called <em>Casablanca</em>{{'}}s great strength &quot;the purity of its Golden Age Hollywoodness [and] the enduring craftsmanship of its resonantly hokey dialogue&quot;. Bob Strauss wrote in the newspaper that the film achieved a &quot;near-perfect entertainment balance&quot; of comedy, romance, and suspense.<a href="#fn92" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref92"><sup>92</sup></a></p>
<p>According to <a href="Roger_Ebert" title="wikilink">Roger Ebert</a>, <em>Casablanca</em> is &quot;probably on more lists of the greatest films of all time than any other single title, including <em><a href="Citizen_Kane" title="wikilink">Citizen Kane</a></em>&quot; because of its wider appeal. Ebert opined that <em>Citizen Kane</em> is generally considered to be a &quot;greater&quot; film but <em>Casablanca</em> is more loved.<a href="#fn93" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref93"><sup>93</sup></a> In his opinion, the film was popular because &quot;the people in it are all so good&quot;, and it was &quot;a wonderful gem&quot;.<a href="#fn94" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref94"><sup>94</sup></a> Ebert said that he has never heard of a negative review of the film, even though individual elements can be criticized, citing unrealistic <a href="special_effect" title="wikilink">special effects</a> and the stiff character/portrayal of Laszlo.<a href="#fn95" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref95"><sup>95</sup></a></p>
<p>Rick, according to <a href="Rudy_Behlmer" title="wikilink">Rudy Behlmer</a>, is &quot;not a hero ... not a bad guy&quot;: he does what is necessary to get along with the authorities and &quot;sticks his neck out for nobody&quot;. The other characters, in Behlmer's words, are &quot;not cut and dried&quot; and come into their goodness over the course of the film. Renault begins as a collaborator with the Nazis who extorts sexual favors from refugees and has Ugarte killed. Even Ilsa, the least active of the main characters, is &quot;caught in the emotional struggle&quot; over which man she really loves.

<p>A few reviewers have had reservations. According to <a href="Pauline_Kael" title="wikilink">Pauline Kael</a>, &quot;It's far from a great film, but it has a special appealingly schlocky romanticism...&quot;<a href="#fn98" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref98"><sup>98</sup></a> <a href="Umberto_Eco" title="wikilink">Umberto Eco</a> wrote that &quot;by any strict critical standards... <em>Casablanca</em> is a very mediocre film.&quot; He viewed the changes the characters undergo as inconsistent rather than complex: &quot;It is a comic strip, a hotch-potch, low on psychological credibility, and with little continuity in its dramatic effects.&quot; However, he added that due to the presence of multiple archetypes which allow &quot;the power of Narrative in its natural state without Art intervening to discipline it&quot;, it is a movie reaching &quot;Homeric depths&quot; as a &quot;phenomenon worthy of awe.&quot;<a href="#fn99" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref99"><sup>99</sup></a></p>
<p>In the November/December 1982 issue of <em><a href="American_Film" title="wikilink">American Film</a></em>, Chuck Ross claimed that he retyped the screenplay to <em>Casablanca</em>, changing the title back to <em><a href="Everybody_Comes_to_Rick&#39;s" title="wikilink">Everybody Comes to Rick's</a></em> and the name of the piano player to <a href="Dooley_Wilson" title="wikilink">Dooley Wilson</a>, and submitted it to 217 agencies. Eighty-five of them read it; of those, thirty-eight rejected it outright, thirty-three generally recognized it (but only eight specifically as <em>Casablanca</em>), three declared it commercially viable, and one suggested turning it into a novel.<a href="#fn100" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref100"><sup>100</sup></a></p>

<p>Many subsequent films have drawn on elements of <em>Casablanca</em>. <em><a href="Passage_to_Marseille" title="wikilink">Passage to Marseille</a></em> reunited Bogart, Rains, Curtiz, Greenstreet and Lorre in 1944. There are similarities between <em>Casablanca</em> and two later Bogart films, <em><a href="To_Have_and_Have_Not_(film)" title="wikilink">To Have and Have Not</a></em> (1944) and <em><a href="Sirocco_(film)" title="wikilink">Sirocco</a></em> (1951).</p>
<p>Parodies have included the <a href="Marx_Brothers" title="wikilink">Marx Brothers</a>' <em><a href="A_Night_in_Casablanca" title="wikilink">A Night in Casablanca</a></em> (1946), <a href="Neil_Simon" title="wikilink">Neil Simon</a>'s <em><a href="The_Cheap_Detective" title="wikilink">The Cheap Detective</a></em> (1978), and <em><a href="Out_Cold_(2001_film)" title="wikilink">Out Cold</a></em> (2001). It provided the title for the 1995 hit <em><a href="The_Usual_Suspects" title="wikilink">The Usual Suspects</a></em>. <a href="Woody_Allen" title="wikilink">Woody Allen</a>'s <em><a href="Play_It_Again,_Sam_(1972_film)" title="wikilink">Play It Again, Sam</a></em> (1972) appropriated Bogart's <em>Casablanca</em> persona as the fantasy mentor for Allen's <a href="List_of_English_words_of_Yiddish_origin" title="wikilink">nebbishy</a> character, featuring actor <a href="Jerry_Lacy" title="wikilink">Jerry Lacy</a> in the role of Bogart.</p>
<p>The film <em>Casablanca</em> was a plot device in the science-fiction television movie <em><a href="Overdrawn_at_the_Memory_Bank" title="wikilink">Overdrawn at the Memory Bank</a></em> (1983), based on <a href="John_Varley_(author)" title="wikilink">John Varley</a>'s story.

<h2 id="interpretation">Interpretation</h2>
<p><em>Casablanca</em> has been subjected to many different readings. <a href="Semiotics" title="wikilink">Semioticians</a> account for the film's popularity by claiming that its inclusion of a whole series of <a href="stereotype" title="wikilink">stereotypes</a> paradoxically strengthens the film.<a href="#fn103" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref103"><sup>103</sup></a><a href="#fn104" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref104"><sup>104</sup></a><a href="#fn105" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref105"><sup>105</sup></a><a href="#fn106" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref106"><sup>106</sup></a> Umberto Eco explained:</p>

<p>Eco also singled out sacrifice as one of the film's key themes: &quot;the myth of sacrifice runs through the whole film.&quot;<a href="#fn107" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref107"><sup>107</sup></a> It was this theme which resonated with a wartime audience that was reassured by the idea that painful sacrifice and going off to war could be romantic gestures done for the greater good.<a href="#fn108" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref108"><sup>108</sup></a></p>
<p>Koch also considered the film a political <a href="allegory" class="uri" title="wikilink">allegory</a>. Rick is compared to President <a href="Franklin_D._Roosevelt" title="wikilink">Franklin D. Roosevelt</a>, who gambled &quot;on the odds of going to war until circumstance and his own submerged nobility force him to close his casino (partisan politics) and commit himself&lt;U+2014&gt;first by financing the Side of Right and then by fighting for it.&quot;<a href="#fn109" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref109"><sup>109</sup></a> The connection is reinforced by the film's title, which means &quot;<a href="White_House" title="wikilink">white house</a>&quot;.<a href="#fn110" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref110"><sup>110</sup></a></p>
<p><a href="Harvey_Greenberg" title="wikilink">Harvey Greenberg</a> presents a <a href="Freudian" class="uri" title="wikilink">Freudian</a> reading in his <em>The Movies on Your Mind</em>, in which the transgressions which prevent Rick from returning to the United States constitute an <a href="Oedipus_complex" title="wikilink">Oedipus complex</a>, which is resolved only when Rick begins to identify with the father figure of Laszlo and the cause which he represents.<a href="#fn111" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref111"><sup>111</sup></a> Sidney Rosenzweig argues that such readings are reductive, and that the most important aspect of the film is its ambiguity, above all in the central character of Rick; he cites the different names which each character gives Rick (Richard, Ricky, Mr. Rick, Herr Rick, boss, and so on) as evidence of the different meanings which he has for each person.<a href="#fn112" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref112"><sup>112</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="awards-and-honors">Awards and honors</h2>
<p>Because of its November 1942 release, the <a href="New_York_Film_Critics" title="wikilink">New York Film Critics</a> decided to include the film in its 1942 award season for best picture. <em>Casablanca</em> lost to <em><a href="In_Which_We_Serve" title="wikilink">In Which We Serve</a></em>.<a href="#fn113" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref113"><sup>113</sup></a> However, the Academy stated that since the film went into national release in the beginning of 1943, it would be included in that year's nominations.<a href="#fn114" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref114"><sup>114</sup></a> <em>Casablanca</em> was nominated for eight Academy Awards, and won three. When the award for <a href="Academy_Award_for_Best_Picture" title="wikilink">Best Picture</a> was announced, producer <a href="Hal_B._Wallis" title="wikilink">Hal B. Wallis</a> got up to accept but studio head <a href="Jack_Warner" title="wikilink">Jack Warner</a> rushed up to the stage &quot;with a broad, flashing smile and a look of great self-satisfaction,&quot; Wallis later recalled. &quot;I couldn&lt;U+2019&gt;t believe it was happening. <em>Casablanca</em> had been my creation; Jack had absolutely nothing to do with it. As the audience gasped, I tried to get out of the row of seats and into the aisle, but the entire Warner family sat blocking me. I had no alternative but to sit down again, humiliated and furious. ... Almost forty years later, I still haven't recovered from the shock.&quot;<a href="#fn115" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref115"><sup>115</sup></a> This incident would lead Wallis to leave Warner Bros. in April.<a href="#fn116" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref116"><sup>116</sup></a></p>

<p><img src="Casablanca_(colorized).jpg" title="fig:Stills from the controversial colorized version" alt="Stills from the controversial colorized version" /> <em>Casablanca</em> was part of the <a href="film_colorization" title="wikilink">film colorization</a> controversy of the 1980s,<a href="#fn139" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref139"><sup>139</sup></a> when a colorized version aired on the <a href="TBS_(TV_network)" title="wikilink">television network WTBS</a>. In 1984, <a href="Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer" title="wikilink">MGM-UA</a> hired Color Systems Technology to colorize the film for $180,000.<a href="#fn140" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref140"><sup>140</sup></a> When <a href="Ted_Turner" title="wikilink">Ted Turner</a> of <a href="Turner_Entertainment" title="wikilink">Turner Entertainment</a> purchased MGM-UA's film library two years later, he canceled the request, before contracting American Film Technologies (AFT) in 1988. AFT completed the colorization in two months at a cost of $450,000.<a href="#fn141" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref141"><sup>141</sup></a> Turner later reacted to the criticism of the colorization, saying, &quot;[<em>Casablanca</em>] is one of a handful of films that really doesn't have to be colorized. I did it because I wanted to. All I'm trying to do is protect my investment.&quot;<a href="#fn142" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref142"><sup>142</sup></a></p>
<p>The <a href="Library_of_Congress" title="wikilink">Library of Congress</a> deemed that the color change differed so much from the original film that it gave a new copyright to Turner Entertainment. When the colorized film debuted on WTBS, it was watched by three million viewers, not making the top-ten viewed cable shows for the week. Although Jack Matthews of the <em>Los Angeles Times</em> called the finished product &quot;state of the art&quot;, it was mostly met with negative critical reception.<a href="#fn143" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref143"><sup>143</sup></a> It was briefly available on home video. Gary Edgerton, writing for the <em><a href="Journal_of_Popular_Film_&amp;_Television" title="wikilink">Journal of Popular Film &amp; Television</a></em> criticized the colorization, &quot;... <em>Casablanca</em> in color ended up being much blander in appearance and, overall, much less visually interesting than its 1942 predecessor.&quot;<a href="#fn144" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref144"><sup>144</sup></a> Bogart's son Stephen said, &quot;if you're going to colorize <em>Casablanca</em>, why not put arms on the <a href="Venus_de_Milo" title="wikilink">Venus de Milo</a>?&quot;<a href="#fn145" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref145"><sup>145</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="rumors">Rumors</h2>
<p>Several rumors and misconceptions have grown up around the film, one being that <a href="Ronald_Reagan" title="wikilink">Ronald Reagan</a> was originally chosen to play Rick. This originates in a press release issued by the <a href="movie_studio" title="wikilink">studio</a> early on in the film's development, but by that time the studio already knew that he was going into the Army, and he was never seriously considered.<a href="#fn146" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref146"><sup>146</sup></a> <a href="George_Raft" title="wikilink">George Raft</a> claimed that he had turned down the lead role. Studio records make clear, however, that Wallis was committed to Bogart from the start.<a href="#fn147" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref147"><sup>147</sup></a></p>
<p>Another well-known story is that the actors did not know until the last day of shooting how the film was to end. The original play (set entirely in the cafe) ended with Rick sending Ilsa and Victor to the airport. During scriptwriting, the possibility was discussed of Laszlo being killed in Casablanca, allowing Rick and Ilsa to leave together, but as Casey Robinson wrote to Hal Wallis before filming began, the ending of the film &quot;set up for a swell twist when Rick sends her away on the plane with Victor. For now, in doing so, he is not just solving a love triangle. He is forcing the girl to live up to the idealism of her nature, forcing her to carry on with the work that in these days is far more important than the love of two little people.&quot;<a href="#fn148" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref148"><sup>148</sup></a> It was certainly impossible for Ilsa to leave Laszlo for Rick, as the <a href="United_States_Motion_Picture_Production_Code_of_1930" title="wikilink">production code</a> forbade showing a woman leaving her husband for another man. The concern was not whether Ilsa would leave with Laszlo, but how this result could be engineered.<a href="#fn149" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref149"><sup>149</sup></a> The problem was solved when the Epstein brothers, <a href="Julius_J._Epstein" title="wikilink">Julius</a> and <a href="Philip_G._Epstein" title="wikilink">Philip</a>, were driving down <a href="Sunset_Boulevard" title="wikilink">Sunset Boulevard</a> and stopped for the light at <a href="Beverly_Glen,_Los_Angeles" title="wikilink">Beverly Glen</a>. At that instant the identical twins turned to each other and simultaneously cried out, &quot;Round up the usual suspects!&quot;<a href="#fn150" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref150"><sup>150</sup></a> By the time they had driven past <a href="Fairfax_District,_Los_Angeles" title="wikilink">Fairfax</a> and the <a href="Cahuenga_Pass" title="wikilink">Cahuenga Pass</a> and through the <a href="Old_Warner_Brothers_Studio" title="wikilink">Warner Brothers studio's</a> portals at <a href="Burbank,_California" title="wikilink">Burbank</a>, in the words of Julius Epstein, &quot;the idea for the farewell scene between a tearful Bergman and a suddenly noble Bogart&quot; had been formed and all the problems of the ending had been solved.<a href="#fn151" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref151"><sup>151</sup></a></p>
<p>The confusion was probably caused by Bergman's later statement that she did not know which man she was meant to be in love with. While rewrites did occur during the filming, Aljean Harmetz's examination of the scripts has shown that many of the key scenes were shot after Bergman knew how the film would end; any confusion was, in critic <a href="Roger_Ebert" title="wikilink">Roger Ebert</a>'s words, &quot;emotional&quot;, not &quot;factual&quot;.<a href="#fn152" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref152"><sup>152</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="errors-and-inaccuracies">Errors and inaccuracies</h2>
<p>The film has several logical flaws, the foremost being the two &quot;letters of transit&quot; which enable their bearers to leave <a href="Vichy_France" title="wikilink">Vichy French</a> territory. According to the , Ugarte says the letters had been signed by (depending on the listener) either <a href="Free_French" title="wikilink">Free French</a> General <a href="Charles_de_Gaulle" title="wikilink">Charles de Gaulle</a> or Vichy General <a href="Maxime_Weygand" title="wikilink">Maxime Weygand</a>. The English subtitles on the official DVD read de Gaulle, while the French ones specify Weygand. Weygand had been the Vichy Delegate-General for the <a href="French_colonial_empire" title="wikilink">North African colonies</a> until November 1941, a month before the film is set. De Gaulle was the head of the Free French <a href="government_in_exile" title="wikilink">government in exile</a>, so a letter signed by him would have provided no benefit.<a href="#fn153" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref153"><sup>153</sup></a> A classic <a href="MacGuffin" class="uri" title="wikilink">MacGuffin</a>, the letters were invented by Joan Alison for the original play and never questioned.<a href="#fn154" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref154"><sup>154</sup></a> Rick suggests to Renault that the letters would not have allowed Ilsa to escape, let alone Laszlo: &quot;People have been held in Casablanca in spite of their legal rights.&quot;</p>
<p>In the same vein, though Laszlo asserts that the Nazis cannot arrest him, saying, &quot;This is still unoccupied France; any violation of neutrality would reflect on Captain Renault,&quot; Ebert points out, &quot;It makes no sense that he could walk around freely. ... He would be arrested on sight.&quot;<a href="#fn155" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref155"><sup>155</sup></a> Harmetz, however, suggests that Strasser intentionally allows Laszlo to move about, hoping that he will tell them the names of Resistance leaders in occupied Europe in exchange for Ilsa being allowed to leave for Lisbon.</p>
<p>In addition, no uniformed German troops were stationed in Casablanca during World War II, and neither American nor French troops occupied Berlin in 1918.<a href="#fn156" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref156"><sup>156</sup></a></p>
<p>According to Harmetz, few of the refugees portrayed would have gone to Casablanca at the time portrayed.<a href="#fn157" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref157"><sup>157</sup></a> The usual route out of Germany was via <a href="Vienna" class="uri" title="wikilink">Vienna</a>, Prague, Paris, and London. Others tried to go from Paris through the <a href="Pyrenees" class="uri" title="wikilink">Pyrenees</a> to Spain. The film's technical advisor, Robert Aisner, traced the path to Morocco shown in <em>Casablanca's</em> opening scene.</p>
<h2 id="quotations">Quotations</h2>
<p>One of the lines most closely associated with the film&lt;U+2014&gt;&quot;Play it again, Sam&quot;&lt;U+2014&gt;is a misquotation.<a href="#fn158" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref158"><sup>158</sup></a><a href="#fn159" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref159"><sup>159</sup></a> When Ilsa first enters the Caf&lt;U+00E9&gt; Americain, she spots Sam and asks him to &quot;Play it once, Sam, for old times' sake.&quot; After he feigns ignorance, she responds, &quot;Play it, Sam. Play '<a href="As_Time_Goes_By_(song)" title="wikilink">As Time Goes By</a>'.&quot; Later that night, alone with Sam, Rick says, &quot;You played it for her, you can play it for me,&quot; and &quot;If she can stand it, I can! Play it!&quot;</p>
<p>Rick's toast to Ilsa, &quot;Here's looking at you, kid&quot;, used four times, is not in the draft screenplays, but has been attributed to something Bogart said to Bergman as he taught her poker between takes.<a href="#fn160" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref160"><sup>160</sup></a> It was voted the fifth most memorable line in cinema in <a href="AFI&#39;s_100_Years&lt;U+2026&gt;100_Movie_Quotes" title="wikilink">AFI's 100 Years&lt;U+2026&gt;100 Movie Quotes</a> by the <a href="American_Film_Institute" title="wikilink">American Film Institute</a>.<a href="#fn161" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref161"><sup>161</sup></a></p>
<p>Six lines from <em>Casablanca</em> appeared in the AFI list, the most of any film (<em><a href="Gone_with_the_Wind_(film)" title="wikilink">Gone with the Wind</a></em> and <em><a href="The_Wizard_of_Oz_(1939_film)" title="wikilink">The Wizard of Oz</a></em> tied for second with three apiece). The other five are:</p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;Louis, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship.&quot;&lt;U+2014&gt;20th</li>
<li>&quot;Play it, Sam. Play 'As Time Goes By'.&quot;&lt;U+2014&gt;28th</li>
<li>&quot;Round up the usual suspects.&quot;&lt;U+2014&gt;32nd</li>
<li>&quot;We'll always have Paris.&quot;&lt;U+2014&gt;43rd</li>
