<p>George Doles was born in <a href="Milledgeville,_Georgia" title="wikilink">Milledgeville, Georgia</a>, the son of Josiah and Martha (Pierce) Doles. His father was a tailor by occupation. Doles was educated in the town's common schools.

<p>With the <a href="secession" class="uri" title="wikilink">secession</a> of Georgia and the start of the Civil War in 1861, Doles enlisted in the Confederate army along with most of his militia unit. He was commissioned a captain in the 4th Georgia Infantry and stationed at <a href="Norfolk,_Virginia" title="wikilink">Norfolk, Virginia</a>. In May 1862, he was appointed <a href="colonel" class="uri" title="wikilink">colonel</a> of the regiment and led it during the <a href="Peninsula_Campaign" title="wikilink">Peninsula Campaign</a> as a part of the <a href="Army_of_Northern_Virginia" title="wikilink">Army of Northern Virginia</a>. He was wounded at the <a href="Battle_of_Malvern_Hill" title="wikilink">Battle of Malvern Hill</a>.</p>
<p>During the 1862 <a href="Maryland_Campaign" title="wikilink">Maryland Campaign</a>, his regiment was a part of Ripley's Brigade in <a href="D._H._Hill" title="wikilink">D. H. Hill</a>'s Division. It helped in the defense of <a href="Battle_of_South_Mountain" title="wikilink">South Mountain</a> before withdrawing towards <a href="Sharpsburg,_Maryland" title="wikilink">Sharpsburg, Maryland</a>. When General <a href="Roswell_Ripley" title="wikilink">Roswell Ripley</a> fell with a wound at the <a href="Battle_of_Sharpsburg" title="wikilink">Battle of Sharpsburg</a> defending the &quot;Bloody Lane,&quot; Doles assumed temporary command of the brigade. This was made official in November 1862 with his promotion to <a href="brigadier_general" title="wikilink">brigadier general</a>. He led the brigade with efficiency during the battles of <a href="Battle_of_Fredericksburg" title="wikilink">Fredericksburg</a> and <a href="Battle_of_Chancellorsville" title="wikilink">Chancellorsville</a>.</p>

Pressure from Doles, as well as from fellow Georgia <a href="John_B._Gordon" title="wikilink">John B. Gordon</a> and other brigades, eventually forced much of the XI Corps to collapse and retire to <a href="Cemetery_Hill" title="wikilink">Cemetery Hill</a>. Doles' men did not see any significant action the rest of the battle, nor in the subsequent <a href="Bristoe_Campaign" title="wikilink">Bristoe</a> or <a href="Mine_Run_Campaign" title="wikilink">Mine Run Campaigns</a>.</p>

During the <a href="Battle_of_Cold_Harbor" title="wikilink">Battle of Cold Harbor</a> in June, a Union <a href="sharpshooter" class="uri" title="wikilink">sharpshooter</a> instantly killed Doles as he was inspecting the Confederate entrenchments near Bethesda Church, Virginia.</p>
