<h2 id="institutions">Institutions</h2>
<p>Most of the major musical organizations in Baltimore were founded by musicians who trained at the <a href="Peabody_Institute" title="wikilink">Peabody Institute</a>'s Conservatory of Music. These include <a href="Baltimore_Choral_Arts" title="wikilink">Baltimore Choral Arts</a> and the <a href="Baltimore_Opera" title="wikilink">Baltimore Opera</a>, as well as the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra (BSO).<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> The Baltimore Symphony Orchestra formed in 1916 and was the only orchestra in the country to operate as a branch of the city's government.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> In 1942, the orchestra was reorganized as a private institution.

<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<p>The documented music history of Maryland begins during the colonial era, in the 18th century. Prior to that, <a href="Native_Americans_in_the_United_States" title="wikilink">Native Americans</a> lived in the state, but left behind few traces of their musical life. The city of Annapolis was a major center for music during the colonial era; the city's Tuesday Club left behind documentation of musical life in Annapolis, one of the most complete sources for musical knowledge about that era in the United States. The larger city of Baltimore eventually replaced Annapolis as a center for music in Maryland, and eventually became home to most of the prominent music institutions in the state, especially the <a href="Peabody_Institute" title="wikilink">Peabody Institute</a>. Later still, Baltimore's Pennsylvania Avenue became a very well known home for <a href="African_American_music" title="wikilink">African American music</a>, especially <a href="jazz" class="uri" title="wikilink">jazz</a>, while Maryland began producing popular musicians like <a href="The_Orioles" title="wikilink">The Orioles</a>. In modern times, Maryland has been a home for styles including <a href="Emo_(music)" title="wikilink">emo</a> and <a href="hardcore_punk" title="wikilink">hardcore punk</a>.</p>
<h3 id="colonial-era">Colonial era</h3>
<p>There is little historical record of music in Maryland prior to the 18th century; the Native Americans of the area left little or no trace of their musical life. A few instruments, such as <a href="drum" title="wikilink">drums</a> and <a href="trumpet" title="wikilink">trumpets</a>, are known to have existed in the early history of the Maryland colony, probably as a functional means &quot;of calling the populace to church or to market, or in serving as symbols for sea captains and those from the military&quot;; some folk dancing and ballad singing is also substantiated by the historical record. The early colonists had little tradition of any performance art, due to the small number of individuals, their low standard of living and great poverty and disease.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
<p>With the arrival of large numbers of <a href="slavery" title="wikilink">slaves</a>, however, some white plantation owners earned enough wealth to invest in music and dance. The upper class used instruments like the <a href="flute" class="uri" title="wikilink">flute</a>, <a href="violin" class="uri" title="wikilink">violin</a> and <a href="harpsichord" class="uri" title="wikilink">harpsichord</a> and danced formal dances like the stately <a href="minuet" class="uri" title="wikilink">minuet</a> or <a href="English_country_dance" title="wikilink">English country dance</a>, while the lower classes preferred <a href="reel_(dance)" title="wikilink">reels</a> and <a href="jig" title="wikilink">jigs</a>, accompanied by various kinds of <a href="guitar" title="wikilink">guitars</a>, <a href="drum" title="wikilink">drums</a>, <a href="banjo" title="wikilink">banjos</a>, <a href="transverse_flute" title="wikilink">transverse flutes</a> and <a href="recorder_(musical_instrument)" title="wikilink">recorders</a>, as well as, more rarely, <a href="hammered_dulcimers" title="wikilink">hammered dulcimers</a> and <a href="harpsichord" title="wikilink">harpsichords</a>.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
<p>Local music groups during the colonial era did much to sponsor musical development. Annapolis, a major center for colonial music in North America, was home to the Homony Club and the Tuesday Club, while the <a href="Freemason" title="wikilink">Freemasons</a> held balls and concerts across Maryland. Unlike the northern United States, religious music did not prosper in Maryland until the end of the colonial period, and then only in Baltimore in the German communities of <a href="Carroll_County,_Maryland" title="wikilink">Carroll</a>, <a href="Montgomery_County,_Maryland" title="wikilink">Montgomery</a> and <a href="Frederick_County,_Maryland" title="wikilink">Frederick</a> countries.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> Tavern owners frequently sponsored dances and concerts during the colonial era. Beginning in 1752, theater became a major part of Maryland culture for colonists of all classes; performances included light dance and incidental music, <a href="ballad_opera" title="wikilink">ballad operas</a> and the works of <a href="William_Shakespeare" title="wikilink">William Shakespeare</a>.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> Aside from the cultural capital of Annapolis, the cities of Baltimore, <a href="Upper_Marlboro,_Maryland" title="wikilink">Upper Marlboro</a> and <a href="Chestertown,_Maryland" title="wikilink">Chestertown</a> were major homes for Maryland theater, home to the debuts of the latest and most popular dances. With the <a href="French_and_Indian_War" title="wikilink">French and Indian War</a> and then the <a href="American_Revolution" title="wikilink">American Revolution</a>, soldiers brought back home to Maryland military band music, especially <a href="Fife_(musical_instrument)" title="wikilink">fife</a> and drum ensembles.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="early-independence-and-19th-century">Early independence and 19th century</h3>
<p>Professional theater in Maryland died out during the Revolution but was reestablished by 1780, now with Baltimore having replaced Annapolis as a cultural capital in the state.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> Maryland ratified the Constitution on April 28, 1788 and became the 7th state. The Holiday Street Theater in Baltimore opened in 1793 and was one of the first large theaters in the country, showcasing light theater, opera, and concerts. In 1822, <a href="Arthur_Clifton" title="wikilink">Arthur Clifton</a> from Baltimore debuted his opera <em>The Enterprise</em>, while religious music flourished after the 1821 opening of the Catholic Cathedral in the country. The <a href="African_Methodist_Episcopal" title="wikilink">African Methodist Episcopal</a> churches in Maryland were home to singing traditions using the <a href="shape-note" class="uri" title="wikilink">shape-note</a> method.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a></p>
<p>By the turn of the century, the middle classes of Maryland were holding regular dances featuring the <a href="cotillion" class="uri" title="wikilink">cotillion</a>, <a href="quadrille" class="uri" title="wikilink">quadrille</a>, <a href="schottische" class="uri" title="wikilink">schottische</a>, <a href="polka" class="uri" title="wikilink">polka</a> and <a href="waltz" class="uri" title="wikilink">waltz</a>. Eastern European dances were also popular, brought by immigrants from various countries. Many immigrants in Maryland moved to Baltimore, forming their own distinct neighborhoods with German <a href="List_of_German_expressions_in_English" title="wikilink">liederkranz</a> singing societies, and Irish <a href="St._Patrick&#39;s_Day" title="wikilink">St. Patrick's Day</a> parades and Jewish chants flourished among their respective communities. Maryland was home to several folk traditions, including the <a href="work_song" title="wikilink">work songs</a> of rail and canal diggers and the crab- and oystermen of the Chesapeake Bay, whose repertoire varied from hymns to risqu&lt;U+00E9&gt; songs and <a href="music_of_the_Bahamas" title="wikilink">Bahaman shanties</a>.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a></p>
<p>By the middle of the 19th century, Baltimore was a major center of sheet music publishing, home to <a href="Joseph_Carr" title="wikilink">Joseph Carr</a>, <a href="F._D._Benteen" title="wikilink">F. D. Benteen</a>, <a href="John_Cole_(music_publisher)" title="wikilink">John Cole</a> and <a href="George_Willig" title="wikilink">George Willig</a>, as well as the piano-building businesses of <a href="William_Knabe" title="wikilink">William Knabe</a> and <a href="Charles_Stieff" title="wikilink">Charles Stieff</a>. This period also saw the rise of <a href="blackface" class="uri" title="wikilink">blackface</a> <a href="minstrel_show" title="wikilink">minstrel shows</a>, featuring the pseudo-African American songs of composers like <a href="Dan_Emmett" title="wikilink">Dan Emmett</a> and <a href="Stephen_Foster" title="wikilink">Stephen Foster</a>.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a></p>
<p>During the Civil War, Maryland was a <a href="border_states_(Civil_War)" title="wikilink">border state</a>, home to people who sympathized with both sides of the conflict. Federal troops occupied Baltimore, and some people who wrote music that favored the Confederacy were jailed; these pieces included &quot;The Confederacy March&quot;, &quot;Stonewall Jackson's Way&quot; and &quot;<a href="Maryland,_My_Maryland" title="wikilink">Maryland, My Maryland</a>&quot;, the last later becoming Maryland's <a href="state_song" title="wikilink">state song</a>. The Civil War left several lasting effects on American music nationwide, most importantly the normalization of white and black cultural mixing, especially in music, caused by the mixing of soldiers in multiracial units; military <a href="brass_band" title="wikilink">brass bands</a> became a popular part of the music scene during and after the war, one of the first being the Moxley Band from <a href="Frederick,_Maryland" title="wikilink">Frederick</a>.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a></p>
<p>The middle of the 19th century saw a wave of immigration from Europe into the United States, including a large number of German musicians who settled in Baltimore; the presence of these musicians, as well as the general growth in urban population with the <a href="industrial_revolution" title="wikilink">industrial revolution</a> and the continued rise of the music publishing industry, helped make music training more affordable for more Americans.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a></p>

<p><a href="Music_school" title="wikilink">Conservatories</a>, institutes of music education, were introduced to the United States in the mid to late 19th century, beginning with Baltimore's <a href="Peabody_Institute" title="wikilink">Peabody Institute</a>'s <a href="Peabody_Conservatory_of_Music" title="wikilink">Conservatory of Music</a>, founded in 1857. The Peabody trained numerous musicians who went on to found most of Baltimore's major musical organizations, including the <a href="Baltimore_Opera" title="wikilink">Baltimore Opera</a>, <a href="Baltimore_Choral_Arts" title="wikilink">Baltimore Choral Arts</a> and the <a href="Baltimore_Symphony_Orchestra" title="wikilink">Baltimore Symphony Orchestra</a>. Though founded in 1857, the Peabody Institute did not hold an orchestral concert until after the Civil War, when <a href="James_Monroe_Deems" title="wikilink">James Monroe Deems</a> directed a concert; Deems was a musician and composer, known for <em>Nebuchadnezzar</em>, one of the first American <a href="oratorio" title="wikilink">oratorios</a>. He was succeeded by <a href="Lucien_Southard" title="wikilink">Lucien Southard</a>, who failed to organize the Institute (then known as the <em>Academy of Music</em>), blaming the lack of a &quot;proper musical atmosphere&quot; in Baltimore. It was not until <a href="Asger_Hamerik" title="wikilink">Asger Hamerik</a>'s reign that the Peabody Symphony Orchestra finally became successful, one of only five professional orchestras in the country at the time. Hamerik was an advocate of American music and regularly included the works of American composers, eschewing the more typical European programs.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a></p>
<p>The Peabody during Hamerik's leadership produced such noted individuals as <a href="Otto_Sutro" title="wikilink">Otto Sutro</a>, publisher, music store owner and host of a music society called the Wednesday Club, and with fellow Peabody alum Fritz Finke, founder of the Oratorio Society. In 1871, Ford's Grand Opera House opened, followed three years later by the <a href="Academy_of_Music_(Baltimore)" title="wikilink">Academy of Music</a>; this new <em>Academy of Music</em> shared the name with the Peabody Institute's organization, but in the same year changed to the <em>Conservatory of Music</em>. The Academy's conductor, <a href="Adam_Itzel,_Jr." title="wikilink">Adam Itzel, Jr.</a> was a very popular composer, known for the national hit light opera <em>The Tar and the Tartar</em>.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="early-20th-century">Early 20th century</h3>
<p>There were a number of mostly informal musical societies in Maryland by the end of the 19th century, including the famous Saturday Night Club of <a href="H._L._Mencken" title="wikilink">H. L.

The <a href="Baltimore_Symphony_Orchestra" title="wikilink">Baltimore Symphony Orchestra</a> was the first permanent orchestra in the city since 1895, when the Peabody Orchestra dissolved; it opened in 1916 with conductor <a href="Gustav_Strube" title="wikilink">Gustav Strube</a>; this came only three year's after the formation of the short-lived Baltimore Opera Society, which was eventually replaced by the <a href="Baltimore_Opera" title="wikilink">Baltimore Opera</a> in 1927.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a></p>
<p>While the largely white middle- and upper-class Baltimoreans supported the orchestras and other societies, the city's African Americans formed their own Coloured Symphony Orchestra in 1931, which was municipally supported just like the BSO; the first performance included <a href="Ellis_Larkins" title="wikilink">Ellis Larkins</a> and <a href="Anne_Brown" title="wikilink">Anne Brown</a>, the latter known for creating the role of Bess in <em><a href="Porgy_and_Bess" title="wikilink">Porgy and Bess</a></em>. At the time, Pennsylvania Avenue (often known simply as <em>The Avenue</em>) was the major scene for Baltimore's black musicians, and was an early home for <a href="Eubie_Blake" title="wikilink">Eubie Blake</a> and <a href="Noble_Sissle" title="wikilink">Noble Sissle</a>, among others.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a></p>
