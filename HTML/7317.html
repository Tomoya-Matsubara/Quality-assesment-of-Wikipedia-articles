<p><strong>Lake Cumberland</strong> is a <a href="reservoir" class="uri" title="wikilink">reservoir</a> in <a href="Clinton_County,_Kentucky" title="wikilink">Clinton</a>, <a href="Laurel_County,_Kentucky" title="wikilink">Laurel</a>, <a href="McCreary_County,_Kentucky" title="wikilink">McCreary</a>, <a href="Pulaski_County,_Kentucky" title="wikilink">Pulaski</a>, <a href="Russell_County,_Kentucky" title="wikilink">Russell</a>, and <a href="Wayne_County,_Kentucky" title="wikilink">Wayne</a> counties in <a href="Kentucky" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kentucky</a>.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> The primary reasons for its construction were a means for flood control and the production of hydroelectric power. Its shoreline measures 1,255 miles (2,020 km) and the lake is spread over  at the top of the power pool. The reservoir ranks 9th in the U.S. in size, with a capacity of  of water, enough to cover the entire Commonwealth of Kentucky with 3 inches (76 mm) of water. The main lake is  long and over one mile (1.6 km) across at its widest point. The lake has become a major source of tourism and an economic engine for south-central Kentucky. As of September 2011 lake Cumberland is approximately  below its normal level due to a crack in the dam that is supposed to be fixed in the upcoming years. They have yet to come to a recognized solution to fix the dam because of the caverns that are underneath the structure so there is no best way to &quot;seal&quot; the crack.</p>
<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<p>Lake Cumberland was impounded from the <a href="Cumberland_River" title="wikilink">Cumberland River</a> by the <a href="United_States_Army_Corps_of_Engineers" title="wikilink">United States Army Corps of Engineers</a>' construction of the <a href="Wolf_Creek_Dam" title="wikilink">Wolf Creek Dam</a> in 1952.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> Wolf Creek Dam is the 25th largest dam in the United States, and cost $15 million to construct originally, with an additional $65 million needed almost immediately to fix problems which became soon apparent. It is estimated that the dam has prevented more than $500 million in flood damages since its construction.</p>
<h3 id="risk-of-dam-failure">Risk of dam failure</h3>
<p>In 1967 a leak was found at the Wolf Creek Dam. Repairs were made in the late seventies at a cost of over $96 million.</p>
<p>On January 22, 2007, the <a href="United_States_Army_Corps_of_Engineers" title="wikilink">United States Army Corps of Engineers</a> began lowering the water level in Lake Cumberland, fearing a break in Wolf Creek Dam. Water seepage has eroded the limestone under the dam, creating the potential for a breach and subsequent flood that would cause damages into the billions of dollars in cities downstream, including <a href="Nashville,_Tennessee" title="wikilink">Nashville, Tennessee</a>.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> The water level, currently at its winter fill level of 690 feet (210 m) altitude, is scheduled to be lowered to a level of  rather than being allowed to fill to its summer fill level of 723 feet (220 m), reducing the lake's summer surface area from . The Corps of Engineers will then attempt to curb the leakage by filling affected areas with <a href="grout" class="uri" title="wikilink">grout</a> while simultaneously filling a portion of the dam with concrete as a more permanent solution.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>The drop in water level is expected to have a negative impact on the area's <a href="tourism" class="uri" title="wikilink">tourism</a> industry as <a href="marina" title="wikilink">marinas</a> scramble to adjust their facilities for the lower water level. Total cost to tourism-related businesses is expected to exceed $12 million.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> By June 2007, wildlife officials were already beginning to notice higher-than-normal water temperatures in the river below Wolf Creek Dam, which posed a major threat to the river's <a href="brown_trout" title="wikilink">brown</a> and <a href="rainbow_trout" title="wikilink">rainbow trout</a> populations.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>

<h3 id="power-generation">Power generation</h3>
<p>Wolf Creek Dam's six turbines are capable of supplying the needs of an average city (population of 375,000) via 270 megawatts of electricity. The power generating capacity is considered &quot;dead&quot; when the lake's water level is below 673 feet (205 m).</p>
<h3 id="recreation">Recreation</h3>
<p>In 1999, approximately 4.75 million visitors added more than $152.4 million to the local economy. Of the 383 lakes controlled or maintained by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Lake Cumberland ranks 4th in the nation for the number of visitor hours. Over 1,500 <a href="houseboat" title="wikilink">houseboats</a> float on Lake Cumberland and numerous power boats play in its waters.</p>
<p>Lake Cumberland is home to two <a href="List_of_Kentucky_state_parks" title="wikilink">Kentucky state parks</a>: <a href="Lake_Cumberland_State_Resort_Park" title="wikilink">Lake Cumberland State Resort Park</a> on its shore and <a href="General_Burnside_State_Park" title="wikilink">General Burnside State Park</a> on an island in the middle of the lake.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
