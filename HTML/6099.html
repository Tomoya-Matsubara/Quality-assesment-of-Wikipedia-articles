<p><strong>&lt;U+014C&gt;uchi Yoshihiro</strong> (<a href="1356" class="uri" title="wikilink">1356</a>-<a href="1399" class="uri" title="wikilink">1399</a>) &lt;U+014C&gt;uchi Yoshihiro, the second son of <a href="&lt;U+014C&gt;uchi_Hiroyo" title="wikilink">&lt;U+014C&gt;uchi Hiroyo</a>, and a member of the <a href="&lt;U+014C&gt;uchi" class="uri" title="wikilink">&lt;U+014C&gt;uchi</a> family which served under <a href="Ashikaga_Takauji" title="wikilink">Ashikaga Takauji</a>. The &lt;U+014C&gt;uchi became known as the <a href="shugo" class="uri" title="wikilink">shugo</a> of <a href="Suo" class="uri" title="wikilink">Suo</a> and <a href="Nagato" class="uri" title="wikilink">Nagato</a> in <a href="1363" class="uri" title="wikilink">1363</a> for assisting the <a href="Ashikaga" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ashikaga</a> against many other opponents. Yoshihiro along with his father both also assisted <a href="Imagawa_Sadayo" title="wikilink">Imagawa Sadayo</a> in his <a href="Ky&lt;U+016B&gt;sh&lt;U+016B&gt;_campaign" title="wikilink">Ky&lt;U+016B&gt;sh&lt;U+016B&gt; campaign</a>. After Yoshihiro's father died during the year of <a href="1379" class="uri" title="wikilink">1379</a>, Yoshihiro and his brothe both became involved into a power struggle. Yoshihiro ended up defeating his brother at <a href="Sakariyama" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sakariyama</a> in <a href="1380" class="uri" title="wikilink">1380</a>. During the year of <a href="1591" class="uri" title="wikilink">1591</a>, in the name of the <a href="shogun" class="uri" title="wikilink">shogun</a>, <a href="Ashikaga_Yoshimitsu" title="wikilink">Ashikaga Yoshimitsu</a>, Yoshihiro led an army against the Southern Court adherents in the Capital region. Due to Yoshihiro's actions, Yoshimitsu awarded him with two more provinces.</p>
<p>Yoshihiro's greatest contribution to the Ashikaga took place during the year of <a href="1392" class="uri" title="wikilink">1392</a>, When Yoshihiro convinced the Southern Court Emperor to surrender, thus bringing the <a href="Nambuchuko_Period" title="wikilink">Nambuchuko Period</a> effectively to a close. Afterwards, the shogun told Yoshihiro to build him a villa at <a href="Kitayama" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kitayama</a>, in which Yoshihiro thought was an unreasonable demand. Due to this ironic fact, the &lt;U+014C&gt;uchi revolted against the <a href="Bakufu" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bakufu</a>. Yoshihiro was supported by many other Shugo, and withdrew his forces from <a href="Kyoto" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kyoto</a> to the city of <a href="Sakai,_Osaka" title="wikilink">Sakai</a>. The shogun, Yoshimitsu however wanted to solve the problem peacefully, but Yoshiro demanded to go out to battle him. Due to this fact, the shogun made the first move. Yoshimitsu gathered the armies of <a href="Hatakeyama" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hatakeyama</a>, <a href="Hosokawa" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hosokawa</a>, and the <a href="Shiba" class="uri" title="wikilink">Shiba</a>, and moved to the land of Sakai. Yoshihiro however made an agreement with some Inland Sea pirates to create a naval blockade against the enemy forces.</p>
<p>Yoshimitsu was then assisted by <a href="Ashikaga_Mitsukane" title="wikilink">Ashikaga Mitsukane</a> who promised that that he would assist him. All was not going well for Yoshihiro due to his <a href="Iwami_Province" title="wikilink">Iwami</a> and <a href="Izumi_Province" title="wikilink">Izumi</a> troops proving to be incompletely unreliable. Due to this fact, Yoshihiro's army seemed generally stubborn, and incompetent. During the 12th month of <a href="1399" class="uri" title="wikilink">1399</a> Bakufu troops managed to set fire to the city, and Yoshihiro ended up having to commit suicide from the invading forces under Yoshimitsu. Apart from military actions, Yoshihiro was involved with trading between China and worked towards securing &lt;U+014C&gt;uchi dominance in that area.</p>
