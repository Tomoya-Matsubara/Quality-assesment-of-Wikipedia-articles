<p><strong>Carol Martha Browner</strong> (born December 16, 1955) is an <a href="United_States" title="wikilink">American</a> lawyer, environmentalist, and businesswoman, who serves as director of the <a href="White_House_Office_of_Energy_and_Climate_Change_Policy" title="wikilink">White House Office of Energy and Climate Change Policy</a> in the <a href="Obama_administration" title="wikilink">Obama administration</a>. Browner previously served as <a href="Administrator_of_the_Environmental_Protection_Agency" title="wikilink">Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency</a> during the <a href="Clinton_administration" title="wikilink">Clinton administration</a>.</p>
<p>Browner grew up in <a href="Florida" class="uri" title="wikilink">Florida</a> and graduated from the <a href="University_of_Florida" title="wikilink">University of Florida</a> and the <a href="University_of_Florida_College_of_Law" title="wikilink">University of Florida College of Law</a>. After working for the <a href="Florida_House_of_Representatives" title="wikilink">Florida House of Representatives</a>, she was employed by <a href="Citizen_Action" title="wikilink">Citizen Action</a> in <a href="Washington,_D.C." title="wikilink">Washington, D.C.</a> She became a legislative assistant for Senators <a href="Lawton_Chiles" title="wikilink">Lawton Chiles</a> and <a href="Al_Gore" title="wikilink">Al Gore</a>. Browner then headed the <a href="Florida_Department_of_Environmental_Regulation" title="wikilink">Florida Department of Environmental Regulation</a> from 1991 to 1993, where she turned it into one of the most active departments in the state government.</p>
<p>She was the longest-serving administrator in the history of the EPA, staying through both terms of the Clinton presidency. During her tenure, she reorganized the agency's enforcement structure and oversaw two new programs designed to create flexible partnerships with industry as an alternative to traditional regulation. She started a successful program to deal with contaminated lands in urban areas. She took the lead within the administration in defending existing environmental laws and budgets, and was the driving force behind a stringent tightening of air quality standards that led to a prolonged political and legal battle. Afterward, Browner became a founding member of the <a href="Albright_Group" title="wikilink">Albright Group</a> and <a href="Albright_Capital_Management" title="wikilink">Albright Capital Management</a> during the 2000s. She also served on a number of boards of directors and committees dealing with environmental issues. She assumed her new post in the Obama administration in January 2009.</p>
