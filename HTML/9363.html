That clause prohibits the President from appointing a current or former member of Congress to a civil office position that was created, or to a civil office position for which the pay and/or benefits (collectively, &quot;emoluments&quot;) were increased, during the term for which that member was elected until the term has expired. The rollback, first implemented by an <a href="Act_of_Congress" title="wikilink">Act of Congress</a> in 1909, reverts the emoluments of the office to the amount they were when that member began his or her elected term.</p>
<p>To prevent ethical conflicts, <a href="James_Madison" title="wikilink">James Madison</a> proposed language at the <a href="Philadelphia_Convention" title="wikilink">Constitutional Convention</a> that was adopted as the Ineligibility Clause after debate and modification by other <a href="Founding_Fathers_of_the_United_States" title="wikilink">Founding Fathers</a>. Historically, a number of approaches have been taken to address the problem posed by restriction; these have included choosing another nominee, allowing the desired nominee's elected term of office to expire, ignoring the clause entirely, or using a &quot;Saxbe fix&quot; to reduce the offending emoluments. Although Congress passed the latter mechanism in 1909, it is named for Senator <a href="William_Saxbe" title="wikilink">William Saxbe</a>, who was confirmed as <a href="United_States_Attorney_General" title="wikilink">Attorney General</a> in 1973 after Congress reduced the office's salary to the level it had been before Saxbe's term commenced. Since the late 1970s, the use of the &quot;Saxbe fix&quot; has been common. The Saxbe fix has subsequently become relevant as a successful&lt;U+2014&gt;though not universally accepted&lt;U+2014&gt;solution for appointments by presidents of both parties of sitting members of the United States Congress to the <a href="United_States_Cabinet" title="wikilink">United States Cabinet</a>. Members of Congress have been appointed to <a href="United_States_federal_judge" title="wikilink">federal judgeships</a> without any fix being enacted; court challenges to such appointments have failed.</p>
<p>There were four Saxbe fixes for appointees of presidents prior to <a href="Barack_Obama" title="wikilink">Barack Obama</a>. The first two rollbacks concerned appointees of <a href="Republican_Party_(United_States)" title="wikilink">Republicans</a> <a href="William_Howard_Taft" title="wikilink">William Howard Taft</a> and <a href="Richard_Nixon" title="wikilink">Richard Nixon</a>, and the latter two were implemented for appointees of <a href="Democratic_Party_(United_States)" title="wikilink">Democrats</a> <a href="Jimmy_Carter" title="wikilink">Jimmy Carter</a> and <a href="Bill_Clinton" title="wikilink">Bill Clinton</a>. Congress approved two more in the weeks preceding Obama's presidency in preparation for his designated Cabinet nominees. Since the 1980s, Saxbe fixes have only been temporary, extending to the conclusion of the term for which the sitting member of Congress was elected. The Clause has received relatively little scholarly or judicial attention; the sparse extant debate centers on whether the reduction of salary satisfies the Ineligibility Clause, or whether affected members of Congress are ineligible for appointment in spite of the reduction.</p>
<h2 id="background">Background</h2>


<p>In his notes of the <a href="Philadelphia_Convention" title="wikilink">Philadelphia Convention</a> in 1787, <a href="James_Madison" title="wikilink">James Madison</a> expressed the fear that members of Congress would create new federal jobs, or increase the salaries for existing jobs, and then take those jobs for themselves. Madison wrote that corrupt legislative actions, in the form of the unnecessary creation of offices and the increase of salaries for personal benefit, were one of his greatest concerns.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> The delegates who were present agreed that no member of Congress should be eligible to be appointed to an executive position while serving in Congress.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> Madison originally proposed a one-year length on such a bar.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> However, <a href="Nathaniel_Gorham" title="wikilink">Nathaniel Gorham</a>, <a href="James_Wilson" title="wikilink">James Wilson</a>, and <a href="Alexander_Hamilton" title="wikilink">Alexander Hamilton</a> wanted no bar at all at the conclusion of congressional service.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> Eventually, Madison proposed a compromise: &quot;that no office ought to be open to a member, which may be created or augmented while he is in the legislature&quot;; this led to extensive debate.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>The delegates eliminated the prohibition on a member of Congress's assuming holding <em>state</em> office based on the rationale that there might be times when it might be in the best interest of the nation to allow such service. They eliminated the one-year ban because they judged it to be ineffective in protecting the Constitution.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a><a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> <a href="Charles_Cotesworth_Pinckney" title="wikilink">Charles Cotesworth Pinckney</a> moved that the states vote and the prohibition carried by vote of 8 states to 3.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> <a href="Robert_Yates_(politician)" title="wikilink">Robert Yates</a> noted that the clause &quot;which shall have been created, or the Emoluments whereof shall have been increased&quot; was an amendment passed in his absence, and that he did not place much faith in it as he felt unscrupulous politicians would circumvent it by creating new positions for persons who would subsequently place a member of Congress in a vacancy that they and not Congress created.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> Madison moved that the phrase &quot;or the Emoluments whereof shall have been augmented by the legislature of the United States, during the time they were members thereof, and for one year thereafter.&quot; This motion failed 2&lt;U+2013&gt;8, with one state divided.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> The clause was limited to &quot;civil&quot; offices so as not to restrict military service.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> Accordingly, the clause was passed in its current form without an explicit time consideration.</p>

<h2 id="history">History</h2>

<p>The Ineligibility Clause has interfered with appointments as far back as 1793. <a href="United_States_President" title="wikilink">President</a> <a href="George_Washington" title="wikilink">George Washington</a> attempted to appoint <a href="William_Paterson_(judge)" title="wikilink">William Paterson</a> to the <a href="United_States_Supreme_Court" title="wikilink">Supreme Court</a> on February 27, 1793, after the resignation of <a href="Associate_Justice_of_the_United_States_Supreme_Court" title="wikilink">Associate Justice</a> <a href="Thomas_Johnson_(Maryland)" title="wikilink">Thomas Johnson</a>. However, Paterson, who was serving as <a href="Governor_of_New_Jersey" title="wikilink">Governor of New Jersey</a>, had previously been elected to serve a Senate term that would expire at noon on March 4, 1793. Washington withdrew the nomination and withheld it until the afternoon of March 4, when the term for the disqualifying office had expired.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="th-century">19th century</h3>
<p>In 1882, a formal opinion by the <a href="Attorney_General" title="wikilink">Attorney General</a> concluded that resignation from Congress does not free a member to be appointed to civil office because the clause speaks to the <em>term</em> for which a member was elected, and that term still exists, even if a member resigns.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> Therefore, as in the Paterson matter nine decades earlier, <a href="Iowa_Governor" title="wikilink">Iowa Governor</a> <a href="Samuel_J._Kirkwood" title="wikilink">Samuel J. Kirkwood</a>, who had resigned a Senate seat with a term that did not expire until March 1883, was ineligible for appointment to the position of <a href="United_States_International_Trade_Commission" title="wikilink">United States Tariff Commissioner</a>.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> In 1896, the <a href="Comptroller_of_the_Treasury" title="wikilink">Comptroller of the Treasury</a> determined, after the fact, that former Senator <a href="Matthew_Ransom" title="wikilink">Matthew Ransom</a>'s appointment as Minister to Mexico was invalid, as that office's salary had been increased during Ransom's term; the belated discovery precluded Ransom from drawing a salary.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a></p>
<p>The practice of barring members of Congress from serving in other civil offices was not without exception. Ransom, after all, was in fact appointed.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> In another case, there may have been an inadvertent Saxbe fix. Senator <a href="Lot_M._Morrill" title="wikilink">Lot M. Morrill</a> began serving a six-year term in 1871, and in 1873, as part of the <a href="Salary_Grab_Act" title="wikilink">Salary Grab Act</a>, Congress increased Cabinet officers' salaries from $8,000 to $10,000; it repealed the increase in 1874, and two years later&lt;U+2014&gt;before the end of his term&lt;U+2014&gt;Morrill was appointed <a href="United_States_Secretary_of_the_Treasury" title="wikilink">United States Secretary of the Treasury</a>. The repeal of the &quot;salary grab&quot; was motivated by reaction to public outrage rather than concerns about a member's eligibility for office, but Acting United States Attorney General <a href="Robert_Bork" title="wikilink">Robert Bork</a> would later cite the Morrill case in his opinion about the Saxbe appointment.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="th-century-1">20th century</h3>
<p>In 1909, <a href="President-elect_of_the_United_States" title="wikilink">President-elect</a> Taft announced his <a href="Philander_C._Knox#Nomination_controversy" title="wikilink">intent to nominate</a> Senator <a href="Philander_C._Knox" title="wikilink">Philander C.

<p>In 1922, the boundaries of the Clause were further defined when Senator <a href="William_S._Kenyon_(Iowa_politician)" title="wikilink">William S.

<p>The <a href="Nixon_administration" title="wikilink">Nixon administration</a> skirted the Ineligibility Clause during its first year, when Nixon named Representative <a href="Donald_Rumsfeld" title="wikilink">Donald Rumsfeld</a> as Director of the <a href="Office_of_Economic_Opportunity" title="wikilink">Office of Economic Opportunity</a> in 1969. Although the salary for that office had been increased to $42,500 during Rumsfeld's term in Congress,<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> Rumsfeld was not paid a salary for the position.

<p>The rollback device gained its name when President Richard Nixon sought to appoint Senator William Saxbe as Attorney General following the <a href="Saturday_Night_Massacre" title="wikilink">Saturday Night Massacre</a>.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a> <a href="Elliot_Richardson" title="wikilink">Elliot Richardson</a> resigned on October 20, 1973 and Nixon nominated Saxbe on November 1.<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a> Saxbe was chosen in large part because, despite the confrontations of the ongoing <a href="Watergate_scandal" title="wikilink">Watergate scandal</a>, Nixon felt the Senate would want to confirm one of their own.<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a> Saxbe had been a senator in 1969 when the Congress passed a pay increase from $35,000 to $60,000 for Cabinet members.<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a> According to section 358 of title 2 of the <a href="United_States_Code" title="wikilink">United States Code</a>, &quot;After considering the report and recommendations of the Commission submitted under section 357 of this title, the President shall transmit to Congress his recommendations with respect to the exact rates of pay, for offices and positions within the purview of subparagraphs (A), (B), (C), and (D) of section 356 of this title, which the President considers to be fair and reasonable ...&quot;<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a> The President transmitted &quot;Salary Recommendations For 1969 Increases&quot; to Congress on January 15, 1969 following the first Commission Report submitted to him under Public Law 90-206 in December 1968.

<p>Although passage in the House was less controversial than it was in the Senate because the constitutional issues did not dominate consideration, the bill met with other procedural obstacles. At the time, Congress was under siege for what was widely perceived as abuse of members' <a href="franking" class="uri" title="wikilink">franking</a> privileges.<a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a> In April, the House had approved H.R. 3180 to clarify what was and was not proper use of franking, and the Senate amended the bill on October 11. The House requested a conference, but the Senate delayed. Supposedly, Senate Post Office and Civil Service Committee Chairman <a href="Gale_McGee" title="wikilink">Gale McGee</a> was delaying the franking bill until the Senate-passed post card voter registration bill (S. 352) was put to a House vote. Thus, at first the House inserted franking language in its Saxbe fix bill. On December 3, it suspended its rules to pass the bill 261&lt;U+2013&gt;129. The Senate then passed the Saxbe fix bill (H.R. 11710) on December 6 without the franking language.

<p>Over time, the Saxbe fix has become politically uncontroversial.<a href="#fn119" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref119"><sup>119</sup></a> Both Democratic and Republican Presidents have used the fix, and indeed Republican outgoing President George H.

<p>The constitutionality of the fix has been much debated, however, and the U.S. Supreme Court has never directly ruled on it.<a href="#fn124" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref124"><sup>124</sup></a><a href="#fn125" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref125"><sup>125</sup></a> Critical review of the clause begins with a study of the terms in the plain language of the clause: &quot;No Senator or Representative shall, during the Time for which he was elected, be appointed to any civil Office under the Authority of the United States, which shall have been created, or the Emoluments whereof shall have been increased during such time ....&quot; All of the terms have been at issue in past controversies and many of the terms have been well-settled.<a href="#fn126" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref126"><sup>126</sup></a> Historically, the excluded class of individuals affected by the clause has not been an issue: all scholars have agreed that the clause refers exclusively to all members of Congress.<a href="#fn127" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref127"><sup>127</sup></a> The clause uses the verb &quot;elected&quot;.

<p>The phrase &quot;During the time for which he was elected&quot; has not been controversial. <a href="Associate_Justice_of_the_Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States" title="wikilink">Justice</a> <a href="Joseph_Story" title="wikilink">Joseph Story</a> has expounded in his <em>Commentaries on the Constitution of the United States</em> that the disqualifying event expires at the conclusion of the elected term in which it occurred.<a href="#fn129" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref129"><sup>129</sup></a> This view is commonly accepted.<a href="#fn130" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref130"><sup>130</sup></a> Moreover, <a href="United_States_Department_of_Justice" title="wikilink">Department of Justice</a> memoranda, outlining official opinions by United States Attorney General, hold that &quot;the Ineligibility Clause covers only increases during the term that a Member of Congress is [or would be] currently serving&quot;.<a href="#fn131" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref131"><sup>131</sup></a> This principle was applied, for example, to the question of whether President <a href="Bill_Clinton" title="wikilink">Clinton</a> could appoint Representative <a href="Bill_Richardson" title="wikilink">Bill Richardson</a> as <a href="United_States_Ambassador_to_the_United_Nations" title="wikilink">Ambassador to the United Nations</a> despite a salary increase prior to his current term, and whether President <a href="Warren_G._Harding" title="wikilink">Harding</a> could appoint Senator <a href="William_Squire_Kenyon" title="wikilink">William Kenyon</a> as a <a href="United_States_Circuit_Court" title="wikilink">Judge</a> despite the Congressional increase of judicial salaries during his previous term.<a href="#fn132" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref132"><sup>132</sup></a> Opinions issued by the Clinton administration <a href="Office_of_Legal_Counsel" title="wikilink">Office of Legal Counsel</a> often presupposed the application of the clause,<a href="#fn133" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref133"><sup>133</sup></a> and conceded that &quot;[t]he tradition of interpreting the Clause has been 'formalistic' rather than 'functional{{'}}&quot;.<a href="#fn134" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref134"><sup>134</sup></a> Another clarification came in 1969, when newly re-elected Representative <a href="Melvin_Laird" title="wikilink">Melvin Laird</a> was President-elect Nixon's choice for <a href="United_States_Secretary_of_Defense" title="wikilink">Secretary of Defense</a> and Congress was expected to raise the pay of Cabinet members in the new term.<a href="#fn135" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref135"><sup>135</sup></a> Attorney General <a href="Ramsey_Clark" title="wikilink">Ramsey Clark</a> gave an official opinion, which Laird followed, that Laird could be sworn in and serve in the new term from January 3 to January 20 (when Nixon would take office) without running afoul of the Clause, as long as he joined the cabinet before the pay raise went into effect.<a href="#fn136" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref136"><sup>136</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="arguments-for-its-constitutionality">Arguments for its constitutionality</h3>
<p>One way to interpret the clause is by the <a href="intentionalist" class="uri" title="wikilink">intentionalist</a> view.<a href="#fn137" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref137"><sup>137</sup></a> As stated by <a href="University_of_North_Carolina_School_of_Law" title="wikilink">University of North Carolina School of Law</a> professor Michael J. Gerhardt, this is the position that &quot;the critical inquiry is not whether the <a href="letter_of_the_law" title="wikilink">letter of the law</a> has been broken (it has) but rather whether the problem that the clause exists to preclude&lt;U+2014&gt;conflicts of interest in nominating a member of Congress who has been able to vote himself or herself a raise&lt;U+2014&gt;has been avoided&quot;.<a href="#fn138" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref138"><sup>138</sup></a> The commonly-used term for this <a href="spirit_of_the_law" title="wikilink">spirit of the law</a> argument is &quot;net increases&quot;.<a href="#fn139" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref139"><sup>139</sup></a> According to conservative constitutional law attorney <a href="Bruce_Fein" title="wikilink">Bruce Fein</a>, &quot;The so-called fix fits the purpose of the clause like a glove.&quot;<a href="#fn140" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref140"><sup>140</sup></a></p>
<p>If the Saxbe fix is a solution for the primary problem of self-dealing, a relevant fact is that Congress has not voted to increase any Cabinet salary or benefits since the 1990s, when it granted that power to the president in the form of an across-the-board <a href="cost_of_living_adjustment" title="wikilink">cost of living adjustment</a> by executive order. However, the Ineligibility Clause does not distinguish between increases in emoluments by legislation, and increases by executive order.<a href="#fn141" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref141"><sup>141</sup></a> Perhaps the most lenient interpretation of self-dealing was made during the 1973 Saxbe hearings by <a href="Duke_University_School_of_Law" title="wikilink">Duke University School of Law</a> professor William Van Alstyne, who argued that the ineligibility clause only applied to new offices created during a congressional term, not to appointments to existing offices.<a href="#fn142" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref142"><sup>142</sup></a></p>
<p>Some scholars think that the phrase &quot;shall have been increased during such time&quot; is ambiguous and allows different interpretations. For instance, it could be interpreted as meaning either &quot;shall have been increased at least once&quot; or &quot;shall have been increased on net&quot;. In the latter case the Saxbe fix would be constitutional.<a href="#fn143" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref143"><sup>143</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="arguments-against-its-constitutionality">Arguments against its constitutionality</h3>
<p>Another way to interpret the clause is through the lens of <a href="textualism" class="uri" title="wikilink">textualism</a>, that is, giving primary consideration to what the law says rather than to its purpose. Most legal scholars who take this view argue that the Saxbe fix does not address the constitutional problem.<a href="#fn144" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref144"><sup>144</sup></a> Because to textualism believers the language of the rule is an absolute prohibition, law professor and textualist Michael Paulsen has said, a &quot;'fix' can rescind the salary, ... but it cannot repeal historical events. The emoluments of the office had been increased. The rule specified in the text still controls.&quot;<a href="#fn145" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref145"><sup>145</sup></a> Most textualists agree that the spirit of the Ineligibility Clause would be addressed by a Saxbe fix, but they dispute that a clause's &quot;spirit&quot; overrides its text.<a href="#fn146" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref146"><sup>146</sup></a><a href="#fn147" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref147"><sup>147</sup></a></p>
<p>This view is not confined to textualists; for example, law professors <a href="Jack_Balkin" title="wikilink">Jack Balkin</a> and <a href="Mark_Tushnet" title="wikilink">Mark Tushnet</a> share it, with Tushnet observing that the Saxbe fix &quot;smacks of clever manipulation&quot; and does not adequately address the issue because &quot;rescinding the increase does not mean that the salary 'shall not have been increased'; it simply means that the salary shall have been both increased and reduced during the term.&quot;<a href="#fn148" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref148"><sup>148</sup></a> Some intentionalists interpret the Ineligibility Clause as a safeguard against escalation of the size and scope of the federal government and its corresponding budget, in addition to being a safeguard against self-enrichment. They argue that reverting salary increases does not prevent members of congress from engaging in conduct that would bloat the government.<a href="#fn149" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref149"><sup>149</sup></a></p>
<p>Another argument presented during the Saxbe nomination hearings was that the constitutional framers wrote the Ineligibility Clause to prevent Congress from enacting laws to benefit one of its own members. Any Saxbe fix is such a law and should be disallowed based on this fact alone.<a href="#fn150" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref150"><sup>150</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="challenges">Challenges</h3>
<p>Once Congress approves a salary reduction and the nominee is confirmed, legal experts conclude that in practice it is unlikely that an appointment would be successfully challenged in the courts. The most likely claimant would be an individual who has been adversely affected by a discretionary decision under the nominee's authority&lt;U+2014&gt;-for example someone denied a <a href="passport" class="uri" title="wikilink">passport</a>.<a href="#fn151" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref151"><sup>151</sup></a> It is unlikely that anyone would be found to have standing to contest the appointment. The Supreme Court has become less solicitous of standing since retreating from the most expansive level of <em><a href="United_States_v._SCRAP" title="wikilink">United States v. SCRAP</a></em>. In particular, it has been unwilling to grant standing for a generalized constitutional injury other than to a plaintiff who is protected by a statute or when a statute grants standing.<a href="#fn152" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref152"><sup>152</sup></a><a href="#fn153" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref153"><sup>153</sup></a></p>
<p>It has already proven difficult to be recognized as having standing when a fix is not used for a controversial appointment. The courts have dismissed suits contesting the appointments of Justice <a href="Hugo_Black" title="wikilink">Hugo Black</a> (<em><a href="Ex_parte_Levitt" title="wikilink">Ex parte Levitt</a></em>, 302 U.S. 633 (1937)) and Judge <a href="Abner_Mikva" title="wikilink">Abner Mikva</a> (<em><a href="McClure_v._Carter" title="wikilink">McClure v. Carter</a></em>, 454 U.S. 1025 (1981)), each a member of the Senate prior to appointment and each appointed without a Saxbe fix, due to failure to establish legal standing.<a href="#fn154" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref154"><sup>154</sup></a> Other than these cases, most attempts to gain standing have been considered frivolous lawsuits brought by fringe groups.<a href="#fn155" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref155"><sup>155</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="precedents">Precedents</h3>
<p>There are several nuances to the Ineligibility Clause that determine the necessity of fixes in specific situations:<a href="#fn156" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref156"><sup>156</sup></a></p>
<ol>
<li>It applies to those members who have actually taken their seats, not to those who were elected but not yet sworn in.</li>
<li>According to <em><a href="Marbury_v._Madison" title="wikilink">Marbury v. Madison</a></em>, &quot;appointed&quot; means at the moment of nomination for civil office, not at the time of approval.<a href="#fn157" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref157"><sup>157</sup></a> Although Chief Justice <a href="John_Marshall" title="wikilink">John Marshall</a> stated that appointments by the President are completely voluntary, there are restrictions on his statutory authority.<a href="#fn158" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref158"><sup>158</sup></a> For example, the duty to commission officers of the United States is enjoined by the constitution and he must nominate with the advice and consent of the Senate.<a href="#fn159" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref159"><sup>159</sup></a></li>
<li>The bar cannot be evaded by resignation from Congress. In a written opinion of Attorney General <a href="Benjamin_H._Brewster" title="wikilink">Benjamin H. Brewster</a>,<a href="#fn160" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref160"><sup>160</sup></a> the clause applies for the term &quot;for which he was elected,&quot; not the time during which the member actually holds office.</li>
<li>According to <em>United States v. Hartwell</em>, &quot;Civil office&quot; is one in which the appointee exercises an authoritative role. It does not apply to temporary, honorific, advisory, or occasional postings.<a href="#fn161" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref161"><sup>161</sup></a> The terms civil office and civil officer are used only once each in the Constitution and civil office is never defined therein.<a href="#fn162" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref162"><sup>162</sup></a></li>
<li>According to <em>McLean v. United States</em>, &quot;Emoluments&quot; means not only salary, but also includes other benefits such as forage and rations.<a href="#fn163" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref163"><sup>163</sup></a></li>
<li>Under Presidents <a href="Lyndon_B._Johnson" title="wikilink">Lyndon B. Johnson</a> and Jimmy Carter, the <a href="United_States_Department_of_Justice" title="wikilink">United States Department of Justice</a> determined that it did not matter when Congress passed legislation increasing the salary for an office, so long as the former member of Congress was nominated before the salary increase went into effect.<a href="#fn164" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref164"><sup>164</sup></a><a href="#fn165" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref165"><sup>165</sup></a></li>

<li id="fn153">Justice <a href="William_J._Brennan,_Jr." title="wikilink">Brennan</a> favored standing for any injury in fact, economic or otherwise. .

But Justice Brennan left the court in 1990, and in cases like <em><a href="Lujan_v._Defenders_of_Wildlife" title="wikilink">Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife</a></em> and <em><a href="Steel_Co._v._Citizens_for_a_Better_Environment" title="wikilink">Steel Co. v.
