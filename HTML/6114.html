<h2 id="description">Description</h2>
<p>Located along <a href="Deansgate" class="uri" title="wikilink">Deansgate</a> at the junction with <a href="Great_Bridgewater_Street" title="wikilink">Great Bridgewater Street</a> and <a href="Liverpool_Road_(Manchester)" title="wikilink">Liverpool Road</a>, it has 47 floors and is <span style="white-space:nowrap">168.87 metres (554 ft)</span> in height, making it the tallest building in the UK outside of London and the UK's 7th tallest building.

The floor also has a bar and lounge, both operated by Hilton. From the 25th to 47th floors, the tower is occupied by residential apartments.</p>
<p>As part of the project, a 12-storey office block is due to be constructed adjacent to the tower,<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> with 6,506 square metres of floor space.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> The hotel also has a 4-storey annex, containing a swimming pool, ballroom, conference rooms and coffee shop.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p>The architect, <a href="Ian_Simpson" title="wikilink">Ian Simpson</a>, bought and resides in the top floor penthouse, which is the highest living space in <a href="United_Kingdom" title="wikilink">Britain</a>. It cost him &lt;U+00A3&gt;3 million.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> It features a semi internal garden containing 21 four-metre high olive, lemon and oak trees shipped from Italy and craned into the building before the roof was built. The penthouse covers the top two stories of the building.</p>

<h2 id="construction">Construction</h2>
<p>The site was originally occupied by an obsolete section of railway viaduct.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> Planning permission for the development was given in October 2003, at which point 206 of the 219 apartments had already been sold, as well as 4 of the 16 penthouses.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> The viaduct was demolished in March 2004, and the twin cores of the building were above ground level at the end of August 2004. One of the two cores reached a height of 125 m at the end of July 2005, at which point the building became the tallest UK skyscraper outside of London.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<p>The Beetham Hilton Tower was built entirely using post-tensioned flat slab concrete construction<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> and was the first building in the UK to use the Doka SKE 100 automatic climbing system and trapezoidal windshield.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
<p>The tower had its official &quot;topping-out&quot; ceremony on <a href="26_April" title="wikilink">26 April</a> <a href="2006" class="uri" title="wikilink">2006</a>. Due to local wind conditions, the building's height had to be reduced by just over 2 metres from its originally planned height of 171 m (561 ft).<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> The hotel opened and received its first guests on <a href="9_October" title="wikilink">9 October</a> <a href="2006" class="uri" title="wikilink">2006</a> with the first apartment residents moving in during 2007.</p>
<p>In total, the building cost &lt;U+00A3&gt;150 million to construct.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>

<h2 id="issues">Issues</h2>
<p>During the installation of the glass and steel 'blade' architectural feature on the roof, a strange noise problem emerged. People reported that the building &quot;whistles&quot; (more like an intermittent hum) in windy weather. The sound is close to standard musical C (approximately 262 Hertz); some say it is like a &quot;<a href="UFO" class="uri" title="wikilink">UFO</a> landing&quot; in sci-fi films. <a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> The noise also affected the production of local soap opera, <a href="Coronation_Street" title="wikilink">Coronation Street</a> with producers having to create extra background noise as the tower is close to the show's set. Despite apparently rectifying the problem, the humming sound can still be heard on occasion in the area, depending on wind direction.</p>
<p>Additionally, many residents of districts close to the city centre, including the <a href="Hulme" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hulme</a> area of Manchester, report a significant loss of television reception following construction of the tower.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> Effects have been reported as far away as <a href="Whalley_Range" title="wikilink">Whalley Range</a>.</p>
