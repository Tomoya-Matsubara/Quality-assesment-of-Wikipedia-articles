<h2 id="california">California</h2>

<p>On May 15, 2008, the Supreme Court of California overturned the ban on same-sex marriage, making California the second state, behind Massachusetts, to allow full marriage rights for same-sex partners. Citing a 1948 California Supreme Court decision that reversed interracial marriages ban, the Republican-dominated California Supreme Court, (in a 4-3 ruling, penned by Chief Justice <a href="Ronald_M._George" title="wikilink">Ronald George</a>) struck down California's 1977 one-man, one-woman marriage law and a similar voter-approved 2000 law (passed with 61%). Marriage licenses for same-sex couples will be available starting June 17, 2008. The 2006 census figures indicate that California has an estimated 108,734 same-sex households.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p>The California Office of Vital Records announced on May 28, 2008 that it planned to start issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples on June 17, 2008.<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/29/us/29gays.html?adxnnl=1&amp;adxnnlx=1212077106-jTPmIQ0KjbR7Sj+zy7X72g">1</a> The Office of Vital Records chose the date of June 17 to be prepared if the May 15, 2008 decision of the Supreme Court of California is not stayed.</p>
<p>In a one-page Resolution, the California Supreme Court on <a href="June_4" title="wikilink">June 4</a>, 2008 forthwith denied all petitions for rehearing and to reconsider the May 15 ruling, as it removed the final obstacle to same-sex marriages starting on <a href="June_17" title="wikilink">June 17</a>.

<p>2004: A constitutional amendment was passed defining civil marriage to be limited to opposite-sex couples. It was approved by wide margin, 66% favorable and only 34% against, in November 2004.</p>
<p>The amendment defines marriage as &quot;... the legal union between a man and a woman. No other domestic union, however denominated, may be recognized as a marriage or given the same or substantially equivalent legal effect.&quot;</p>
<p>2005: <a href="Utah" class="uri" title="wikilink">Utah</a> Governor <a href="Jon_Huntsman,_Jr." title="wikilink">Jon Huntsman, Jr.</a> proposed reciprocal benefits for all same-sex couples living in the state. The measure was defeated in the state Senate by 18 -10, and he has promised to revisit the issue in 2006.</p>
