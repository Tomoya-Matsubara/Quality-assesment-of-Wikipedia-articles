<p><a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> is a <a href="Nintendo_Entertainment_System" title="wikilink">Nintendo Family Computer</a> video game developed and published by <a href="Data_East" title="wikilink">Data East</a>, in 1988. It is based on <a href="McDonald&#39;s" class="uri" title="wikilink">McDonald's</a> characters.</p>
<p>The game's only background music is basically a derivative of the classic McDonald's theme song as heard through Japanese televisions of the 1980s.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>

<p>Unlike <em><a href="M.C._Kids" title="wikilink">M.C. Kids</a></em>, this game is simply a generic platformer without any puzzle elements to it.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> For example, players had to search outside Ronald's clubhouse for four of the puzzle cards to allow them access to the next level while the Donald Land video game simply consists of defeating enemies while avoiding damage.</p>
<p>The action game stars Ronald McDonald (known in Japan as <em>Donald McDonald</em>), the mascot of the McDonald's fast food chain.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> The objective is to bring peace to his magical land by controlling the famous <a href="fast_food" title="wikilink">fast food</a> clown.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> Most of Ronald's companions have been kidnapped, and the animals have turned <a href="feral" class="uri" title="wikilink">feral</a>.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> His brainwashed companions will occasionally attack.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> Ronald can defend himself using apple bombs, thrown in a carefully calculated <a href="parabola" class="uri" title="wikilink">parabola</a>.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> Being hit by the enemy causes damage, which decreases Ronald's &quot;Life&quot; meter. During various parts of a stage, players have the opportunity to collect up to 100 hamburger icons throughout the game. This will result in gaining a bonus life along with the hamburger counter resetting itself to zero. It is also possible to play a mini-game challenge, to earn commodities that the player orders from McDonald's.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<p>Ronald can replenish his life bar by finding heart icons that are scattered throughout the level; the maximum number of hits that he can withstand before dying is five.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> From the second stage onward, the levels become more demanding with emphasis on making jumps from platform to platform while avoid bottomless pits. Items also become more difficult to reach and falling into a pit results in instantly losing a life. An enemy appears in the second level that resembles <a href="Little_Red_Riding_Hood" title="wikilink">Little Red Riding Hood</a>; although she causes damage like a normal enemy and cannot be destroyed by the player's apple bombs.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> A few of the bosses look like something out of a <a href="horror_film" title="wikilink">horror film</a> instead of a kid-friendly 2D platform action game. The third boss looks like a giant mechanical dragon while the boss of level 5 is a bone dragon and players encounter a <a href="mental_illness" title="wikilink">mentally ill</a> disembodied head at the end of the eleventh level.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
