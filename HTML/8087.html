<p><strong>Clemens Johann Dreisewerd</strong> [Steamboat] (<a href="January_24" title="wikilink">January 24</a>, <a href="1916" class="uri" title="wikilink">1916</a> - <a href="September_11" title="wikilink">September 11</a>, <a href="2001" class="uri" title="wikilink">2001</a>) was a <a href="pitcher" class="uri" title="wikilink">pitcher</a> in <a href="Major_League_Baseball" title="wikilink">Major League Baseball</a> who played for three different teams between <a href="1944_in_baseball" title="wikilink">1944</a> and <a href="1948_in_baseball" title="wikilink">1948</a>. Listed at 6' 1.5&quot;, 195 lb., Dreisewerd batted and threw <a href="left_handed" title="wikilink">left handed</a>. He was born in <a href="Old_Monroe,_Missouri" title="wikilink">Old Monroe, Missouri</a>.</p>
<p>During 10 years, Dreisewerd struggled in the <a href="minor_league_baseball" title="wikilink">minor leagues</a> through the adversities and disappointments of baseball's contract system before attaining major league status. At the end of 1937, he decided to write a letter to the <a href="Baseball_commissioner" title="wikilink">Baseball Commissioner</a> <a href="Kenesaw_Mountain_Landis" title="wikilink">Kenesaw Mountain Landis</a>. In this letter, Dreisewerd complained about the manner in which he had been moved around to other organizations while under contract with the <a href="San_Francisco_Giants" title="wikilink">New York Giants</a>. On New Year's Day of 1938, Commissioner Landis granted him <a href="free_agent" title="wikilink">free agency</a>.</p>
<p>In 1944, while pitching for <a href="Sacramento_Solons" title="wikilink">Sacramento</a>, Dreisewerd turned things around recording 20 <a href="win_(baseball)" title="wikilink">wins</a> and a 1.61 <a href="earned_run_average" title="wikilink">ERA</a>, the lowest of the <a href="Pacific_Coast_League" title="wikilink">Pacific Coast League</a> pitchers. Finally, he reached the majors late in the season with the <a href="Boston_Red_Sox" title="wikilink">Boston Red Sox</a>, ending with a 2-4 mark in seven <a href="starting_pitcher" title="wikilink">starts</a>. After appearing in only two games in 1945, he was recruited by the <a href="United_States_Navy" title="wikilink">U.S. Navy</a> during <a href="World_War_II" title="wikilink">World War II</a>. While in the Navy, he pitched for a team that included major leaguers as <a href="Mickey_Owen" title="wikilink">Mickey Owen</a>, <a href="Jim_Konstanty" title="wikilink">Jim Konstanty</a> and <a href="Eddie_Yost" title="wikilink">Eddie Yost</a>. He was released from the Navy in time for the start of the <a href="1946_in_baseball" title="wikilink">1946</a> season with Boston.</p>
<p>Dreisewerd enjoyed his most productive season with the 1946 <a href="American_League" title="wikilink">American League</a> champions Red Sox, when he went 4-1 in 20 <a href="games_pitched" title="wikilink">games pitched</a> in <a href="relief_pitcher" title="wikilink">relief</a>, except for one start. He also pitched 1/3 of an <a href="innings_pitched" title="wikilink">inning</a> in Game 4 of the memorable <a href="1946_World_Series" title="wikilink">1946 World Series</a> between the Red Sox and <a href="St_Louis_Cardinals" title="wikilink">Cardinals</a>, retiring <a href="Enos_Slaughter" title="wikilink">Enos Slaughter</a>, who had four hits and needed another to set a Series record.</p>
<p>In 1947, Dreisewerd was sent down to the Red Sox Class Triple-A associate team in <a href="Louisville,_Kentucky" title="wikilink">Louisville</a>, as he led the <a href="American_Association_(20th_century)" title="wikilink">American Association</a> pitchers with 18 wins and a 2.15 ERA. After that, he divided his playing time with the <a href="Baltimore_Orioles" title="wikilink">St. Louis Browns</a> and New York Giants in 1948, his last major league season.</p>
<p>In a four-season career, Dreisewerd posted a 6-8 record with 39 <a href="strikeout" title="wikilink">strikeouts</a> and a 4.54 ERA in 46 appearances, including 10 starts, three <a href="complete_games" title="wikilink">complete games</a>, two <a href="save_(sport)" title="wikilink">saves</a>, and 140 2/3 innings pitched.</p>
<p>In October 1948 Dreisewerd tried winter baseball in <a href="Venezuela" class="uri" title="wikilink">Venezuela</a>, but after a month, a <em><a href="coup_d&#39;&lt;U+00E9&gt;tat" title="wikilink">coup d'&lt;U+00E9&gt;tat</a></em> caused the suspension of the baseball season. A year later he developed severe arm problems, and after unsuccessfully tries with various minor league teams, he was convinced that his baseball career was finished.</p>
<p>Following his playing retirement, Dreisewerd worked as a <a href="General_contractor" title="wikilink">construction contractor</a>, building homes in the <a href="New_Orleans" title="wikilink">New Orleans</a> area, where he lived for 50 years. By 1999, he was legally blind with <a href="macular_degeneration" title="wikilink">macular degeneration</a>. He died in <a href="Ocean_Springs,_Mississippi" title="wikilink">Ocean Springs, Mississippi</a> at age 85, of head injuries suffered in a fall while on vacation.</p>
