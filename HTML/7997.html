<p>is a <a href="Video_game_console" title="wikilink">console</a> <a href="role-playing_video_game" title="wikilink">role-playing video game</a> developed and published by <a href="Square_Enix" title="wikilink">Square Enix</a> for the <a href="PlayStation_3" title="wikilink">PlayStation 3</a> and the <a href="Xbox_360" title="wikilink">Xbox 360</a>. Released in 2009 in Japan and 2010 in North America and <a href="PAL_region" title="wikilink">PAL regions</a>, it is the thirteenth installment in the <em><a href="Final_Fantasy" title="wikilink">Final Fantasy</a></em> series. The game includes fast-paced <a href="Gameplay_of_Final_Fantasy#Parties_and_battles" title="wikilink">combat</a>, a new system for the series for determining which abilities are developed for the characters called &quot;Crystarium&quot;, and a customizable &quot;Paradigm&quot; system to control which abilities are used by the characters. <em>Final Fantasy XIII</em> includes elements from the previous games in the series, such as <a href="Final_Fantasy_character_jobs#Summoner" title="wikilink">summoned monsters</a>, <a href="chocobo" title="wikilink">chocobos</a>, and <a href="Gameplay_of_Final_Fantasy#Airships_and_transport" title="wikilink">airships</a>.</p>
<p>The game takes place in the fictional floating world of Cocoon, whose government, the Sanctum, is ordering a purge of civilians who have supposedly come into contact with Pulse, the much-feared world below. The former soldier Lightning begins her fight against the government in order to save her sister who has been branded as an unwilling servant to a god-like being from Pulse, making her an enemy of Cocoon. Lightning is soon joined by a band of allies, and together the group also become marked by the same Pulse creature. They rally against the Sanctum while trying to discover their assigned task and whether they can avoid being turned into monsters or crystals at the completion.</p>
<p>Development began in 2004 and the game was first announced at <a href="Electronic_Entertainment_Expo" title="wikilink">Electronic Entertainment Expo</a> (E3) 2006. <em>Final Fantasy XIII</em> is the flagship title of the <em><a href="Fabula_Nova_Crystallis_Final_Fantasy" title="wikilink">Fabula Nova Crystallis</a></em> collection of <em>Final Fantasy</em> games and is the first game to use Square Enix's <a href="Crystal_Tools" title="wikilink">Crystal Tools</a> engine. <em>Final Fantasy XIII</em> received mostly positive reviews from <a href="video_game_journalism" title="wikilink">video game publications</a>, which praised the game's graphics, presentation, and battle system. Reviewers were more mixed in their opinion about the game's story and <a href="Nonlinear_gameplay" title="wikilink">linearity</a> compared to previous games in the series. Selling 1.7 million copies in Japan in 2009, <em>Final Fantasy XIII</em> became the fastest-selling title in the history of the series. As of May 2010, the game had sold 6.2 million copies worldwide. On January 18, 2011, Square Enix announced a sequel titled <em><a href="Final_Fantasy_XIII-2" title="wikilink">Final Fantasy XIII-2</a></em>, to be released later that year.</p>
<h2 id="gameplay">Gameplay</h2>
<p>The player directly controls the on-screen character through a third-person perspective to interact with people, objects, and enemies throughout the game. The player can also turn the camera around the characters, which allows for a 360&lt;U+00B0&gt; view of the surroundings.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> The world of <em>Final Fantasy XIII</em> is rendered to scale relative to the characters in it; instead of a caricature of the character roaming around miniature terrain, as found in the earlier <em>Final Fantasy</em> games, every area is represented proportionally. The player navigates the <a href="overworld" title="wikilink">world</a> by foot or by <a href="Chocobo" class="uri" title="wikilink">Chocobo</a>.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> Players may save their game to a hard disk drive using save stations, where the player can also purchase items from retail networks or upgrade their weapons.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> An in-game datalog provides a <a href="bestiary" class="uri" title="wikilink">bestiary</a> and incidental information about the world of <em>Final Fantasy XIII</em>.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> The <em>Final Fantasy XIII Ultimate Hits International</em> version of the game, released in Japan, also contains an &quot;Easy&quot; mode option.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>

</figure>
<p>As in <em><a href="Final_Fantasy_XII" title="wikilink">Final Fantasy XII</a></em>, enemies are integrated into the open field and can be approached or avoided by the player. When the player's character touches an enemy, the screen transitions from the regular map to a separate battle screen similar to those used in previous <em>Final Fantasy</em> titles.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> A maximum of three characters may be used in battles, which use a variant on the series' traditional <a href="Gameplay_of_Final_Fantasy#Parties_and_battles" title="wikilink">Active Time Battle</a> (ATB) system designed by <a href="Hiroyuki_Ito" title="wikilink">Hiroyuki Ito</a> and first featured in <em><a href="Final_Fantasy_IV" title="wikilink">Final Fantasy IV</a></em>. Under this system, the player selects an action from the <a href="Menu_(computing)" title="wikilink">menus</a>, such as Attack, Magic, and Item. Unlike previous games in the series, the player only controls the lead character while the remaining two characters are controlled by the game's <a href="artificial_intelligence" title="wikilink">artificial intelligence</a> (AI). Each action requires a specific number of slots on the ATB bar, which continually refills to a set maximum number of slots. The ATB bar gradually increases in size throughout the game from two slots to six.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> The player may select less than the maximum number of possible actions or may stop the filling of the ATB bar and perform as many actions as can be done with the current ATB amount. The player may select an autobattle command, which fills the ATB slots with actions chosen automatically. Actions cannot be performed outside of battle, and the characters' health is fully restored after each battle.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p>Each enemy has a meter, called a chain counter, consisting of a percentage starting at 100 which increases when the enemy is struck by attacks or spells. Attacks by different roles have different effects; some raise the chain by a larger amount while others give the player longer before the chain counter resets. The amount of damage performed by an attack is multiplied by the chain percentage before it is applied to the enemy. When the chain counter reaches a preset amount, different for each enemy, the enemy is placed into Stagger State. In this mode, the enemy has lowered defense and may be launched into the air.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> The Paradigm system allows the player to program six different roles which the characters can then assume to perform certain formations in battle in response to the specific conditions. The roles consist of Commando, a <a href="Final_Fantasy_character_jobs#Warrior" title="wikilink">warrior</a>-type role; Ravager, a <a href="Final_Fantasy_character_jobs#Black_Mage" title="wikilink">black mage</a>-type role which uses damage-dealing magic; Medic, a <a href="Final_Fantasy_character_jobs#White_Mage" title="wikilink">White Mage</a>-type role which can heal; Saboteur, which can weaken enemies; Synergist, which can strengthens allies; and Sentinel, which has protective abilities.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> Each of the characters can initially take on only three roles, but the player has access to all of them later in the game (although the other three roles are limited in their abilities for those players which choose them). The player can select which roles the controlled character and the AI characters are using both outside and during battle, which is the only way that the player can control the AI characters during battle.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> The player can only choose from specific sets of paradigms that the player has set up beforehand outside of battle.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<p>Each character can summon a specific Eidolon into battle.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> These <a href="Final_Fantasy_character_jobs#Summoner" title="wikilink">summoned creatures</a> include series staples Odin, Shiva, Alexander, and Bahamut, and newcomers Hecatoncheir and Brynhildr.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> When summoned, the Eidolon stays in combat while the characters accompanying the summoner leave the party.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> While an Eidolon is summoned, the player can trigger a feature called Gestalt Mode, in which the Eidolon transforms into a different form and performs different attacks while the summoning character rides them.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="crystarium">Crystarium</h3>
<p>The Crystarium is a leveling system consisting of six crystals and resembles the <a href="Final_Fantasy_X#Sphere_Grid" title="wikilink">Sphere Grid</a> from <em><a href="Final_Fantasy_X" title="wikilink">Final Fantasy X</a></em>.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a><a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> Each crystal in the Crystarium represents one of the six Paradigms, and is divided into ten levels. Each level contains various nodes that supply bonuses to health, strength, or magic, or provide new abilities and accessory slots. These nodes are connected by a semi-linear path. The player may advance down the path by acquiring Crystarium Points, which are awarded after defeating enemies.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> The full Crystarium is not available to the player at the beginning of the game; at specific points in the game's plot, the player gains access to new crystals or levels.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="plot">Plot</h2>
<h3 id="setting">Setting</h3>
<p><em>Final Fantasy XIII</em> is set within the world of Gran Pulse. Central to the story is Cocoon, a massive artificial sphere that floats above Pulse's surface and is ruled by the Sanctum, a <a href="Theocracy" title="wikilink">theocratic</a> government. The two worlds are controlled by fal'Cie (), beings with godlike power. The Cocoon fal'Cie are responsible for keeping Cocoon floating, as well as providing light and water to the people that live inside. Each fal'Cie handles a specific task.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> The fal'Cie have the capability of marking the humans that live in Pulse and Cocoon as their servants. These servants, called l'Cie, are branded with a symbol representing either Pulse or Cocoon and are given a &quot;Focus&quot;&lt;U+2014&gt;a task to complete.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> If the l'Cie complete their task in time, they are transformed to crystal and according to legend gain eternal life; otherwise they become mindless monsters called Cie'th.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> The l'Cie are not explicitly told their Focus, but are instead given visions that they must interpret.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a></p>
<p>Several hundred years before the events of the game, a battle known as the War of Transgression took place between Pulse and Cocoon. During the battle, l'Cie from Pulse attacked and ripped a large hole in Cocoon.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> Eventually, the l'Cie completed their focus and were turned to crystal. The hole was patched with material lifted from Pulse, and Cocoon's citizens have since lived in fear of another invasion; this fear is used by the Sanctum to remain in power.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> The Sanctum oversees two military branches: the Guardian Corps, responsible for keeping order on Cocoon, and PSICOM, the special forces in charge of dealing with any threat related to Pulse.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> The fal'Cie have given the humans advanced technology, including flying airships and mechanical creatures, and a form of magic also exists. This magic is normally only accessible to l'Cie, fal'Cie, and various monsters in Cocoon and Pulse, though distilled chemical forms can be used by normal humans.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a></p>

<p><em>Final Fantasy XIII</em> begins in Cocoon as the citizens of the town of Bodhum are being evicted, or Purged, from Cocoon after coming in contact with something from Pulse.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> Over the course of the game, the player is shown flashbacks of the events of the previous 13 days, which began when a fal'Cie from Pulse was discovered near Bodhum. Lightning's sister Serah had found the fal'Cie from Pulse and been changed into a l'Cie by it. Lightning and Sazh derail a Purge train bound for Pulse in an attempt to save Serah. In the subsequent battle, Snow leads his resistance group, NORA, to rescue the Purge exiles. Several of them, including Hope's mother, are killed. As Snow heads to the fal'Cie Anima to save Serah, he is joined by two of the exiles: Hope and Vanille. The two groups meet at the fal'Cie, and find Serah just as she turns to crystal. Anima then brands them all as l'Cie and they are cast out into a different part of Cocoon. During this transformation, the newly crested l'Cie all have the same vision: a monster called Ragnarok.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> The group, arguing over the ambiguous nature of the dreamed Focus, find Serah in her crystallized form; Snow remains with her as the others leave.</p>
<p>Snow meets Cid and Fang after being captured and detained aboard the <a href="airship" class="uri" title="wikilink">airship</a> <em>Lindblum</em>. Meanwhile, the others escape from PSICOM, but are separated during an air strike; Hope and Lightning travel to Palumpolum, while Sazh and Vanille travel to Nautilus. In Lightning's scenario, she unintentionally supports Hope's goal of killing Snow as revenge for his mother's death.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> In Vanille's scenario, Sazh discusses how his son Dajh was turned into a l'Cie by a Cocoon fal'Cie and was taken by PSICOM to discover his Focus.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> At Palumpolum, Lightning tries to persuade Hope not to go through with his revenge and meets Snow and Fang. Fang reveals that she and Vanille were l'Cie from Pulse who were turned into crystals; they were turned back into humans 13 days prior to the start of the game, sparking the Purge.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> Hope attempts to murder Snow, but after Snow saves him from an airstrike, he decides not to go through with it.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> The party then escapes the city with Cid's aid. At Nautilus, Vanille reveals herself to Sazh as a l'Cie from Pulse, and indirectly the reason that Dajh was turned into a l'Cie.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a> PSICOM then captures Sazh and Vanille and detains them on board the airship <em>Palamecia</em>.</p>
<p>The other members of the party stage a rescue mission and reunite with Vanille and Sazh before they confront Galenth Dysley, the Sanctum's Primarch. Dysley reveals himself as the Cocoon fal'Cie ruler Barthandelus.<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> He tells them that their Focus is to transform into the beast Ragnarok and slay the sleeping fal'Cie Orphan, who keeps Cocoon afloat above Pulse. Slaying the fal'Cie Orphan will result in the destruction of Cocoon. The party escapes and learns from Cid that the fal'Cie believe that Cocoon's destruction will summon the Maker, the creator of the worlds. The fal'Cie cannot harm Orphan themselves.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a> Vanille and Fang reveal to the party that they were involved in the War of Transgression centuries prior, and that their Focus then had been the same: to transform into Ragnarok and attempt to destroy Orphan.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a> The party flies away to Pulse and travels to Oerba, Vanille and Fang's hometown, where they hope to learn how to remove their l'Cie marks. They are unsuccessful, and Dysley confronts the group again. He tells them that he is forcing Cid, now the head of the Sanctum, to create chaos in Cocoon to force the Cavalry to attack Cid and Orphan in a <a href="coup_d&#39;&lt;U+00E9&gt;tat" title="wikilink">coup d'&lt;U+00E9&gt;tat</a>.<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a></p>
<p>The party infiltrates Cocoon with the goal of preventing its destruction. They head towards Orphan only to find that the Cavalry have been turned into Cie'th. The party encounters Dysley and overpowers him, but Orphan awakens and merges with Dysley, then compels Fang to finish her Focus as Ragnarok while the others are seemingly transformed into Cie'th. The group reappears in human form, preventing Fang from transforming. The party engage and defeat Orphan<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a> and escape Cocoon, which is now falling towards Pulse. As the rest of the party turns to crystal for completing their Focus, Vanille and Fang remain on Cocoon and transform into Ragnarok together. They prevent a collision between Cocoon and Pulse by turning themselves into a crystal pillar between the two worlds. The rest of the party awaken from their crystallization on Pulse and find their l'Cie brands gone. The game ends with Lightning and Snow reuniting with Serah and Sazh reuniting with Dajh.</p>

<p>The developers for <em>Final Fantasy XIII</em> were divided into multiple areas, with each developer or team focusing only on a specific task such as developing a specific in-game area or modeling characters.<a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a> Each physical area of the game was developed separately; after an initial design was approved, teams were assigned to a specific location and filled in details without reusing assets from other areas.<a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a> Several of the game's developers had worked on previous installments of the series.

<p>Tsuchida's concept for the battle system was to maintain the strategic nature of command-based battles. The system stemmed from a desire to create battles similar to those found in the film <em><a href="Final_Fantasy_VII_Advent_Children" title="wikilink">Final Fantasy VII Advent Children</a></em>.<a href="#fn70" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a> <a href="Magic_point" title="wikilink">Magic points</a> (MP), which had been a part of the battle system in previous <em>Final Fantasy</em> titles, were removed in the game's battle system as Tsuchida and the other designers felt that it gave players an incentive to not use their most powerful magic attacks due to the MP cost, in turn making battles less interesting. The Paradigm system was designed early in the battle system's development, with the intent of making battles rely on quickly changing strategies and feel fast-moving. Originally there were only five roles, but the Saboteur was later added as the designers felt that its abilities were missing from the game and did not fit with the other roles. Together with the maximum of three characters in a combat situation, the groupings of enemies were designed to force the player to switch Paradigms to keep them engaged in the battles.<a href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a></p>
<p>Toriyama wanted Lightning to be a new type of female character with an athlete's body and a less feminine nature than some of the previous female characters of the series.<a href="#fn72" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref72"><sup>72</sup></a><a href="#fn73" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref73"><sup>73</sup></a> His guideline to Nomura was to make her &quot;strong and beautiful&quot;, and she was intended to be reminiscent of <em>Final Fantasy VII</em>{{'}}s <a href="Cloud_Strife" title="wikilink">Cloud Strife</a>.<a href="#fn74" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref74"><sup>74</sup></a><a href="#fn75" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref75"><sup>75</sup></a> Fang was initially meant to be a male character, but the gender was changed to coincide with the updated character designs during the latter part of development.<a href="#fn76" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref76"><sup>76</sup></a> The game's villains were intended by Kitase to have &quot;their own motivations and beliefs&quot; and act realistically.<a href="#fn77" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref77"><sup>77</sup></a> The graphics capabilities of the PS3 and Xbox 360 compared to previous consoles allowed Nomura to use more complex elements in the character designs than before, such as Lightning's cape and detailed facial features.<a href="#fn78" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref78"><sup>78</sup></a> This in turn meant that the art team had to do much more work for each character or area than in previous games.<a href="#fn79" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref79"><sup>79</sup></a> Nomura did not take an involved role in the creation of the <a href="Non-player_character#Computer_and_video_games" title="wikilink">non-playable characters</a>.<a href="#fn80" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref80"><sup>80</sup></a></p>
<p>Unlike previous games in the series which were more inspired by Asian locations and culture, <em>Final Fantasy XIII</em> was intended by the art team to be reminiscent of the United States. Pulse was based on landscape photographs the team took from across the country, and Cocoon was intended to be a &quot;<a href="melting_pot" title="wikilink">melting pot</a>&quot; of different ethnicities.<a href="#fn81" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref81"><sup>81</sup></a> Art director <a href="Isamu_Kamikokuryo" title="wikilink">Isamu Kamikokuryo</a> revealed that many additional scenarios such as Lightning's home, which were functioning in an unreleased build during development, were left out of the final version due to concerns about the game's length and volume.<a href="#fn82" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref82"><sup>82</sup></a> Kamikokuryo said the content they cut was, in itself, enough to make another game.<a href="#fn83" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref83"><sup>83</sup></a> According to Toriyama, the cuts were made in &quot;various stages of [the game's] development&quot;, and that some of the content was removed just before the game's completion.<a href="#fn84" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref84"><sup>84</sup></a> The game, unlike previous titles in the series, includes no explorable town areas; Toriyama said in an interview that the team was unable to make them as graphically appealing as the rest of the game and chose to eliminate them.<a href="#fn85" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref85"><sup>85</sup></a> Toriyama intended to have a piece of <a href="downloadable_content" title="wikilink">downloadable content</a> available for the game that would include a new area, weapons and quests, but was forced to cut it as well due to quality concerns so late in the project and difficulties with the different systems for extra content on the two gaming consoles.<a href="#fn86" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref86"><sup>86</sup></a></p>

The game was intended to appeal to both Western and Japanese audiences, and focus groups from both regions were used.

<h3 id="linearity">Linearity</h3>
<p>While critics generally praised Square Enix's attempt to revitalize the <em>Final Fantasy</em> series formula, many reacted negatively to the linear nature of the game, especially in the first ten chapters on Cocoon,<a href="#fn145" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref145"><sup>145</sup></a><a href="#fn146" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref146"><sup>146</sup></a> an issue which many felt was compounded by the large reduction of towns and interaction with non-player characters.<a href="#fn147" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref147"><sup>147</sup></a> <em><a href="GamePro" class="uri" title="wikilink">GamePro</a></em> described the gameplay as &quot;a long hallway toward an orange target symbol on your mini-map that triggers a cutscene, a boss fight, or both,&quot;<a href="#fn148" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref148"><sup>148</sup></a> and 1UP.com criticized the linear aspect as the game's &quot;biggest shortcoming&quot;, and felt the first section was &quot;superficial.&quot;<a href="#fn149" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref149"><sup>149</sup></a> <em>Edge</em> and others awarded the game especially lower scores as a result of these aspects, with <em>Edge</em> in particular lowering the score they awarded the game to a five out of ten primarily due to the game's linear nature.<a href="#fn150" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref150"><sup>150</sup></a></p>

<h3 id="response-to-criticism">Response to criticism</h3>
<p>After release, director Motomu Toriyama felt that the lower-than-expected review scores for a main <em>Final Fantasy</em> series game came from reviewers who approached the game from a Western point of view. These reviewers were used to games in which the player was given an <a href="open_world" title="wikilink">open world</a> to explore, he said, noting that this expectation contrasted with the vision the team set out to create. He noted that it &quot;becomes very difficult to tell a compelling story when you're given that much freedom&quot;.<a href="#fn160" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref160"><sup>160</sup></a> Toriyama and Kitase later said, in July 2011, that the biggest complaints about the game were that it was too linear and that there was not enough interaction between the player and the world, which they described as a lack of towns and <a href="Minigames_of_Final_Fantasy" title="wikilink">minigames</a>. They also named the amount of time it took to access all of the gameplay elements as a common criticism, saying that people interpreted it as a &quot;lengthy tutorial&quot;.<a href="#fn161" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref161"><sup>161</sup></a></p>
<p>Square Enix president <a href="Yoichi_Wada" title="wikilink">Yoichi Wada</a> made his thoughts about the reception of the game known to <a href="Gamasutra" class="uri" title="wikilink">Gamasutra</a>. He said, &quot;Some value it highly, while others really don't like it.&quot;<a href="#fn162" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref162"><sup>162</sup></a> He added, &quot;Should Final Fantasy become a new type of game or should Final Fantasy not become a new type of game? The customers have different opinions. It's very difficult to determine which way it should go.&quot;<a href="#fn163" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref163"><sup>163</sup></a></p>

The game takes place immediately after the events of <em>Final Fantasy XIII</em>. <em>Final Fantasy XIII-2</em> is set to star Lightning once again, and will feature a modified version of the Active Time Battle system from the original game.<a href="#fn166" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref166"><sup>166</sup></a> Toriyama stated in the <em><a href="List_of_Square_Enix_companion_books" title="wikilink">Ultimania Omega</a></em> companion book prior to the sequel's announcement that he hoped to write a story &quot;where Lightning ends up happy&quot;, though at the time Square Enix had no plans to make a sequel.<a href="#fn167" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref167"><sup>167</sup></a> {{-}}</p>
