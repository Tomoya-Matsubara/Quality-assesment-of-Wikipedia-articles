<p>The machine proved as commercial success. <a href="William_Morris,_1st_Viscount_Nuffield" title="wikilink">Lord Nuffield</a> bought a Envoy and won thereby the air race from <a href="London" class="uri" title="wikilink">London</a> to <a href="Johannesburg" class="uri" title="wikilink">Johannesburg</a> in 1934.. Soon after, orders came from the whole Commonwealth. Two aircraft went to the <a href="Ansett_Airlines" title="wikilink">Ansett Airlines</a> in <a href="Australia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Australia</a>. <a href="North_Eastern_Airways" title="wikilink">North Eastern Airways</a> also used the AS.6. In <a href="Czechoslovakia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Czechoslovakia</a>, the <a href="Czech_Airlines" title="wikilink">CSA</a> ordered four AS.6 Envoy JC in 1937.</p>
<p>The Airspeeds AS.6 Envoy also entered the Air Forces of different countries, besides Great Britain, the aircraft was used in Spain, Japan, South Africa, Finland and China was used and some others. The <a href="RAF" class="uri" title="wikilink">RAF</a> used a small number of AS.6 in a military configuration. Seven machines were ordered for joint use by the <a href="South_African_Air_Force" title="wikilink">South African Air Force</a> and <a href="South_African_Airways" title="wikilink">South African Airways</a>, with three being delivered in military form and four delivered to South African Airways, where they were used on the air route between Johannesburg - <a href="Bloemfontein" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bloemfontein</a> - <a href="Port_Elizabeth" title="wikilink">Port Elizabeth</a> on <a href="12_October" title="wikilink">12 October</a> <a href="1936" class="uri" title="wikilink">1936</a>.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> All seven could be transformed by four persons within four hours from the transportation version into a light bomber or reconnaissance aircraft. In this configuration the crew consisted of four; pilot, navigator, radio operator and gunner.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>The Envoy was involved in a tragic accident in Australia. The VH-UXY, carrying Lieutenant <a href="Charles_Ulm" title="wikilink">Charles Ulm</a>, disappeared in 1934, during an attempt to fly the Pacific route between <a href="Oakland" class="uri" title="wikilink">Oakland</a> and <a href="Honolulu" class="uri" title="wikilink">Honolulu</a>.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> Two AS.6 aircraft were to participate in the <a href="MacRobertson_Air_Race" title="wikilink">MacRobertson Air Race</a> in 1934, from England to Australia, but both remained on the ground, but one was damaged on the eve of the race and was withdrawn, and the other, a specially modified version with long range tanks (the <strong>AS 8 Viceroy</strong>) got as far as Athens before abandoning the race.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>During the <a href="Spanish_Civil_War" title="wikilink">Spanish Civil War</a>, two AS.6 Envoy were used on the nationalist side <a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a>as reconnaissance aircraft or light bombers.</p>
<p>In May 1937, the British King traded his <a href="de_Havilland_Dragon_Rapide" title="wikilink">de Havilland Dragon Rapide</a> for an Airspeed AS.6J Envoy III. The AS.6's good stability and flaps, as well as its low landing speed (less than 100 km/h) was decisive. The aircraft received had the identification code G-AEXX and was painted in distinctive red and blue colours .<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p>During the Second World War, the German <a href="Luftwaffe" class="uri" title="wikilink">Luftwaffe</a> captured some machines and used them as trainer aircraft. Luftwaffe gave one aircraft to Finland on <a href="22_January" title="wikilink">22 January</a> <a href="1942" class="uri" title="wikilink">1942</a>, as reparation for the mistakenly shooting down of a Finnish <a href="de_Havilland_Dragon_Rapide" title="wikilink">de Havilland Dragon Rapide</a>. This aircraft was used between 1942 and 1943. Likewise, one aircraft was used between 1941 to 1943 by the Slovaks.</p>
