<p><img src="Twoswiftsjrh.JPG" title="fig:Two Swifts" alt="Two Swifts" /> <img src="Swift_semifolded_SCP_jeh.jpg" title="fig:Folding" alt="Folding" /> The <strong>Swift Folder</strong> is a <a href="folding_bicycle" title="wikilink">folding bicycle</a>, designed by Peter Reich of Design Mobility Inc. of <a href="Brooklyn" class="uri" title="wikilink">Brooklyn</a>, New York, in collaboration with <a href="Jan_VanderTuin" title="wikilink">Jan VanderTuin</a> of the <a href="Center_for_Appropriate_Transport" title="wikilink">Center for Appropriate Transport</a> in Eugene, Oregon.</p>
<p>The Swift Folder is available from Design Mobility as a bare <a href="bicycle_frame" title="wikilink">frame</a> for customers to build up themselves, or assembled into a complete bicycle to the customer's requirements. The bicycle is also sold under license by <a href="Xootr" class="uri" title="wikilink">Xootr</a> as the Xootr Swift, fully assembled to one standard specification.</p>
<h2 id="folding-system">Folding System</h2>
<p>The Swift Folder design employs a vertical folding method, using the seat-post and a split seat-tube as the locking mechanism.</p>
<p>To fold, the seat-post is released from the two parts of the seat-tube by their respective quick release clamps, then pulled up into the upper part of the seat-tube to unlock the frame. A pivot in the main frame tube then allows the rear triangle (comprising the seat-stays, chain-stays and the lower portion of the seat-tube) and rear wheel to swing down and forward under the main tube. The seat-post is then slid back down through the upper part of the seat-tube to lock the rear wheel in the folded position.</p>
<p>To unfold, the seat-post is again pulled up to allow the rear triangle to swing back and up into the normal riding position. The seat-post is then slid down through the upper and lower parts of the seat-tube, locking the rear triangle and wheel into place. <a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>The Swift frame is simple and robust, and allows a quick fold, but when folded is not as compact as some other folding bicycle designs. The bottom bracket forms part of the folding rear triangle, and as a result the bottom bracket to rear fork-end distance remains constant throughout the fold. This keeps the chain tension constant, which is an advantage when the Swift frame is used in a fixed-gear, single speed, or <a href="hub_gear" title="wikilink">hub gear</a> bicycle.</p>
<h2 id="construction">Construction</h2>
<p>The Swift Folder <a href="bicycle_frame" title="wikilink">frame</a> is manufactured from <a href="Tungsten_inert_gas_welding" title="wikilink">TIG welded</a> aluminium alloy, while the fork is &quot;<a href="chromoly" class="uri" title="wikilink">chromoly</a>&quot; steel. The frame is generally built to common &quot;industry-standard&quot; sizes and threads, and can accommodate a wide variety of <a href="Bicycle_gearing" title="wikilink">gear systems</a>, <a href="Bicycle_brake_systems" title="wikilink">brakes</a> and other components. The rear fork spacing can accommodate most standard road and mountain bike wheel-hubs.</p>
<p>The Swift Folder is normally fitted with &quot;20 inch&quot; wheels. The standard <a href="ISO_5775" title="wikilink">ISO 5775</a> wheel size is 406mm (traditionally known as 20x1 to 20x2.125), the same size used on most <a href="BMX" class="uri" title="wikilink">BMX</a> bicycles. A wide variety of wheels and tires is available in this size.</p>
