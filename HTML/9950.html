<h2 id="course-of-events">Course of events</h2>
<p>The 19:31 freight train from <a href="Ellesmere_Port" title="wikilink">Ellesmere Port</a> to <a href="Mold,_Flintshire" title="wikilink">Mold</a> Junction consisted of 38 wagons hauled by a <a href="British_Rail_Class_24" title="wikilink">Class 24</a> diesel locomotive no. 5028. The first five wagons were tank wagons containing <a href="kerosene" class="uri" title="wikilink">kerosene</a>, <a href="petrol" class="uri" title="wikilink">petrol</a> and <a href="gas_oil" title="wikilink">gas oil</a>.</p>
<p>At around 20:50 the train was approaching Chester on a 1 in 100 falling <a href="gradient" class="uri" title="wikilink">gradient</a> when the driver discovered that the <a href="brakes" class="uri" title="wikilink">brakes</a> had failed. It ran past a signal at danger and through a set of points which were set for no. 11 <a href="bay_platform" title="wikilink">bay platform</a>, where an empty <a href="diesel_multiple_unit" title="wikilink">diesel multiple unit</a> was standing.</p>
<p>As there was nothing more he could do, the driver jumped out onto the platform with the train still travelling at around 20 mph. It ploughed straight into the DMU and completely destroyed the first coach. The second coach was torn from its <a href="bogie" title="wikilink">bogies</a> and thrown up onto the platform where it demolished the refreshment room wall. Fortunately there were very few people on that part of the station, although the staff in the refreshment room had to shelter themselves from falling <a href="masonry" class="uri" title="wikilink">masonry</a>.</p>
<p>A major fire broke out when the burst fuel tanks of the trains ignited, but fortunately the <a href="fire_brigade" title="wikilink">fire brigade</a> were based nearby and arrived within a couple of minutes. They were able to rescue a trapped postal worker and evacuated several passengers from an adjacent (fortunately lightly-loaded) train before it too was engulfed by the fire.</p>
<p>Damage caused to the trains was severe, especially after petrol from two of the tank wagons began to boil and was forced out of the pressure relief valves, whereupon it ignited. The fire was not extinguished until 00:20 the following day.</p>
<p>The trains involved were all written off and a section of the station roof was damaged and consequently removed.</p>
<h2 id="causes">Causes</h2>
<p>The first eight wagons were equipped with the <a href="vacuum_brake" title="wikilink">vacuum brake</a> but the pipes had not been connected up. The train had run from Ellesmere Port as an unbraked freight train and stopped at <a href="Helsby" class="uri" title="wikilink">Helsby</a>, where it needed to reverse. The guard had forgotten to connect up the vacuum pipes when the locomotive coupled up to the opposite end of the train, so that extra brake power was available on the falling gradient into Chester. The driver had also omitted to carry out a brake test before departure.</p>
