<p><strong>Margaret Grace Bondfield</strong>, <a href="Companion_of_Honour" title="wikilink">CH</a>, <a href="Privy_Council_of_the_United_Kingdom" title="wikilink">PC</a> (17 March 1873 &lt;U+2013&gt; 16 June 1953) was a British <a href="Labour_Party_(UK)" title="wikilink">Labour</a> politician, trades unionist and women's rights activist. She became the first female cabinet minister, and the first woman to be a <a href="privy_counsellor" title="wikilink">privy counsellor</a>, when she was appointed <a href="Secretary_of_State_for_Work_and_Pensions" title="wikilink">Minister of Labour</a> in the <a href="Second_MacDonald_ministry" title="wikilink">Labour government of 1929&lt;U+2013&gt;31</a>. She had earlier become the first woman to chair the General Council of the <a href="Trades_Union_Congress" title="wikilink">Trades Union Congress</a> (TUC).</p>
<p>Bondfield was born in humble circumstances and received limited formal education. After serving an apprenticeship to an embroidress she worked as a shop assistant in <a href="Brighton" class="uri" title="wikilink">Brighton</a> and London. She was shocked by the working conditions of shop staff, particularly within the &quot;living-in&quot; system, and became an active member of the shopworkers' union. She began to move in socialist circles, and in 1898 was appointed assistant secretary of the National Union of Shop Assistants, Warehousemen, and Clerks (NAUSAWC). She was later prominent in several women's socialist movements: she helped to found the <a href="Women&#39;s_Labour_League" title="wikilink">Women's Labour League</a> (WLL) in 1906, and was chair of the Adult Suffrage Society. Her standpoint on women's suffrage&lt;U+2014&gt;she favoured extending the vote to all adults regardless of gender or property, rather than the limited &quot;on the same terms as men&quot; agenda pursued by the militant suffragists&lt;U+2014&gt;divided her from the militant leadership.</p>
<p>After leaving her union post in 1908 Bondfield worked as organising secretary for the WLL and later as women's officer for the National Union of General and Municipal Workers (NUGMW). She was elected to the TUC Council in 1918, and became its chairman in 1923, the year she was first elected to parliament. In the short-lived minority <a href="First_MacDonald_ministry" title="wikilink">Labour government of 1924</a> she served as parliamentary secretary to the Ministry of Labour. Her term of cabinet office in 1929&lt;U+2013&gt;31 was marked by the economic crises that beset the second Labour government. Her willingness to contemplate cuts in unemployment benefit alienated her from much of the Labour movement, although she did not follow <a href="Ramsay_MacDonald" title="wikilink">Ramsay MacDonald</a> into the National Government that assumed office when the Labour government fell in August 1931.</p>
<p>Bondfield remained active in NUGMW affairs until 1938, and during the Second World War carried out investigations for the Women's Group on Public Welfare. She died in 1953; despite her years of service to party and union, and her successes in breaking through gender boundaries, she has not been greatly honoured within the Labour movement. According to a later female cabinet minister, <a href="Barbara_Castle" title="wikilink">Barbara Castle</a>, Bondfield's actions in office had brought her close to betrayal of the movement.</p>

<p>While Margaret was still an infant, William lost his job and was unable to find regular work.

<p><img src="Brighton_aquarium_photochrom.jpg" title="fig:Brighton in the 1890s" alt="Brighton in the 1890s" /> Bondfield was apprenticed to a drapery and embroidery business in Church Road, Hove,<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> where the young staff were treated as family members. Relations between customers and assistants were cordial, and Bondfield's later recollections of this period were uniformly happy.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> Her apprenticeship complete, she worked as a living-in assistant in a succession of Brighton drapery stores, where she quickly encountered the realities of shop staff life: unsympathetic employers, very long hours, appalling living conditions and no privacy.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> Bondfield reported on her experiences of living-in: &quot;Overcrowded, insanitary conditions, poor and insufficient food were the main characteristics of this system, with an undertone of danger ... In some houses both natural and unnatural vices found a breeding ground&quot;.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> She found some relief from this environment when she was befriended by a wealthy customer, <a href="Louisa_Martindale_(feminist)" title="wikilink">Louisa Martindale</a>, and her daughter Hilda. The Martindales, socially-conscious liberals and advocates for women's rights, found Bondfield a willing learner, and lent her books that began her lifelong interest in labour and social questions. Bondfield described Mrs Martindale as &quot;a most vivid influence on my life ... she put me in the way of knowledge that has been of help to many score of my shop mates&quot;.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> <img src="Beatrice_&amp;_Sidney_Webb,_c1895.jpg" title="fig:Beatrice and Sidney Webb, circa 1895; they were among Bondfield&#39;s early socialist acquaintances" alt="Beatrice and Sidney Webb, circa 1895; they were among Bondfield&#39;s early socialist acquaintances" /> Bondfield's brother Frank had established himself in London some years earlier as a printer and trades unionist,<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> and in 1894, having saved &lt;U+00A3&gt;5, she decided to join him. She found London shopworking conditions no better than in Brighton,<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> but through Frank her social and political circles widened. She became an active member of the <a href="Union_of_Shop,_Distributive_and_Allied_Workers" title="wikilink">National Union of Shop Assistants, Warehousemen, and Clerks</a> (NUSAWC), sometimes missing church on Sundays to attend union meetings.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> Her political and literary education was centred on the Ideal Club, where she met <a href="George_Bernard_Shaw" title="wikilink">Bernard Shaw</a>, and <a href="Sidney_Webb,_1st_Baron_Passfield" title="wikilink">Sidney</a> and <a href="Beatrice_Webb" title="wikilink">Beatrice Webb</a>.

<p>As a shopworker, Bondfield was expected to work between 80 and 100 hours a week for 51 weeks in the year,<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> and might be sent out late at night to check that rival shops had closed before her employer would do so.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a>{{#tag:ref|In 1873 the Liberal MP <a href="John_Lubbock,_1st_Baron_Avebury" title="wikilink">Sir John Lubbock</a> had introduced a parliamentary bill to limit shopworkers' hours to ten and a half per day.

Her accounts of squalor and exploitation were published in articles under the &quot;Grace Dare&quot; name, in both <em>The Shop Assistant</em> and the <em><a href="Daily_Chronicle" title="wikilink">Daily Chronicle</a></em> newspaper, and provided the basis for a WIC report on shopworkers' conditions published in 1898.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a></p>

In <a href="Reading,_Berkshire" title="wikilink">Reading</a> and Bristol she reported no success, although in <a href="Gloucester" class="uri" title="wikilink">Gloucester</a>, she thought, &quot;it should not be difficult to organise every shop worker&quot;.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> In 1899 Bondfield was the first woman delegate to the <a href="Trades_Union_Congress" title="wikilink">Trades Union Annual Congress</a>, that year held in <a href="Plymouth" class="uri" title="wikilink">Plymouth</a>,<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> where she participated in the vote that led to the formation in 1900 of the <a href="Labour_Representation_Committee_(1900)" title="wikilink">Labour Representation Committee</a> (LRC), forerunner of the <a href="Labour_Party_(UK)" title="wikilink">Labour Party</a>.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> NAUSAWC, its membership by then around 7,000, was one of the first unions to affiliate to the committee.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1902 Bondfield met <a href="Mary_Macarthur" title="wikilink">Mary Macarthur</a>, some eight years her junior, who chaired the <a href="Ayr" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ayr</a> branch of NAUSAWC. Macarthur, the daughter of a wealthy Scottish draper, had held staunchly Conservative views until a meeting in 1901 to discuss the formation of a NAUSAWC branch of the Shop Assistants' Union transformed her into an ardent trades unionist.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> In 1903 Macarthur moved to London where, with Bondfield's recommendation, she became secretary of the <a href="Women&#39;s_Trade_Union_League_(United_Kingdom)" title="wikilink">Women's Trade Union League</a>.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> The two became close comrades-in-arms during the next two decades, in a range of causes affecting women.

<p>The year 1904 saw the passage of the Shop Hours Act, which made some provision for limiting shop hours.{{#tag:ref|The Act gave local councils the power to fix trading hours, provided they could get the agreement of at least two-thirds of shopowners. Not until the Shops Act of 1911 did it become a statutory requirement that shopworkers had a half-day's holiday each week.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a>|group= n}} In 1907 the first steps were taken to end the Victorian &quot;living-in&quot; practice, which at the time still affected two-thirds of Britain's 750,000 shopworkers.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a> Initially, living-out privileges were only given to male employees; Bondfield campaigned for equivalent rights for women shop workers, arguing that if they were to become &quot;useful, healthy ... wives and mothers&quot;, they needed to live &quot;rational lives&quot;.<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> As part of her campaign, Bondfield advised the playwright <a href="Cicely_Hamilton" title="wikilink">Cicely Hamilton</a>, whose shop-based drama <em>Diana of Dobsons</em> appeared that year. Bondfield described the opening scene, set in a dreary, comfortless women's dormitory over a shop, as very like the real thing.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a></p>
<p>From 1904 onwards, Bondfield was increasingly occupied with the issue of women's suffrage. In that year she travelled with Dora Montefiore of the <a href="Women&#39;s_Social_and_Political_Union" title="wikilink">Women's Social and Political Union</a> (WSPU) to the International Congress of Women in Berlin, but she was not in sympathy with the main WSPU policy, which was to secure the vote for women on the same highly restricted basis that it was then given to men. This involved a property qualification, and thus largely excluded the working class. Bondfield saw no benefit in this policy to the women that she represented, and aligned herself with the <a href="Adult_Suffrage_Society" title="wikilink">Adult Suffrage Society</a> (ASS), which campaigned for universal adult suffrage, men and women alike, regardless of property.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a> In 1906 she became chairman of the society and supported the Franchise and Removal of Women's Disabilities bill, introduced to parliament by <a href="Sir_Charles_Dilke" title="wikilink">Sir Charles Dilke</a>.<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a> This proposed full adult suffrage, and the right of women to become MPs. The bill was &quot;<a href="Filibuster" title="wikilink">talked out</a>&quot; in the House of Commons,<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a> but Bondfield's support antagonised many militants in the WSPU, who considered the bill a distraction from their more limited aims. In 1907, in the course of a public debate with Teresa Billington-Greig of the Women's Freedom League (a breakaway group from the WSPU), Bondfield argued that the only way forward was a bill that enfranchised all men and all women, without qualification.<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a> She wished good luck to those fighting for a &quot;same terms as men&quot; suffrage bill, but &quot;don't let them come and tell me that they are working for my class&quot;.<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a>{{#tag:ref|The Adult Suffrage Society was relaunched in 1909 as the People's Suffrage Federation (PSF), under the leadership of Margaret Llewellyn Davies.<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a>|group= n}} The strains of her duties and constant campaigning began to undermine her health, and in 1908 she resigned her union post after ten years' service, during which NAUSAWC membership had risen to over 20,000.<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a> Her departure, she said, was &quot;alike a grief and a deliverance&quot;.<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="womens-labour-league">Women's Labour League</h3>

<p>After leaving NAUSAWC, Bondfield transferred the main focus of her energies to the <a href="Women&#39;s_Labour_League" title="wikilink">Women's Labour League</a> (WLL), which she had helped to found in 1906.<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a> The League's principal aims were &quot;to work for independent labour representation in connection with the Labour Party, and to obtain direct labour representation of women in Parliament and on all local bodies.&quot;<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a> The president of the League was <a href="Margaret_MacDonald_(social_reformer)" title="wikilink">Margaret MacDonald</a>, wife of the future Labour Party leader <a href="Ramsay_MacDonald" title="wikilink">Ramsay MacDonald</a>;<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a> Bondfield had known the MacDonalds since the 1890s, through their joint work for the WIC.<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a></p>
<p>With a government suffrage reform bill pending in parliament, the WLL introduced a motion to the 1909 Labour Party conference committing the party to oppose any suffrage extension bill that did not specifically include women. However, while the party was largely sympathetic to the principle of women's suffrage, it was unwilling to risk losing the limited reforms to male suffrage promised by the government's bill. When Bondfield tabled the WLL motion at the Labour conference, she was persuaded by <a href="Arthur_Henderson" title="wikilink">Arthur Henderson</a> to water it down.<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a> Many suffragists reacted angrily; the WSPU accused the WLL, and Bondfield in particular, of treachery. Fran Abrams, in a biographical essay, writes that although Bondfield &quot;was prepared to argue loud and long for adult suffrage, ... she was not prepared to damage her relationship with the Labour Party for it&quot;.<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a></p>
<p>Since the passing of the Qualification of Women Act in 1907, women had been eligible to vote in and stand as candidates in municipal elections.<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a> Several WLL members contested the <a href="London_County_Council" title="wikilink">London County Council</a> elections in 1910; Bondfield stood in <a href="Metropolitan_Borough_of_Woolwich" title="wikilink">Woolwich</a>, unsuccessfully (she contested the same seat in 1913, with a similar result).<a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a><a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a> The League was active in all types of elections, supporting and canvassing for candidates of either sex who spoke out for women's rights. Through these activities Bondfield experienced the lives of the poorest of families, writing: &quot;Oh! the lonely lives of these women, hidden away at the back of a network of small, mean streets!&quot;<a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a></p>
<p>Alongside her WLL duties, Bondfield maintained a range of other involvements. She spent part of 1910 in the United States, lecturing on suffrage issues with Maud Ward of the People's Suffrage Federation (PSF), and studying labour problems.<a href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a><a href="#fn67" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a> At home, she worked with the <a href="Women&#39;s_Co-operative_Guild" title="wikilink">Women's Co-operative Guild</a> (WCG) on maternity and child welfare, and was co-opted to the Parliamentary Standing Committee which piloted the introduction of state maternity benefits and other assistance to mothers.<a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a><a href="#fn69" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref69"><sup>69</sup></a> Her investigation on behalf of the WIC into the working conditions in the textile industries led her to join most of the Labour leadership in a &quot;War against Poverty&quot; campaign.<a href="#fn70" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a> In 1910 Bondfield accepted the chairmanship of the British section of the Women's International Council of Socialist and Labour Organisations.<a href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a></p>
<p>Between 1908 and 1910 the WLL and the WIC co-operated in a nationwide investigation of married women's working conditions. Bondfield carried out the fieldwork in Yorkshire. The relationship between the two bodies was sometimes fractious, and when the report was due to be published, there were disagreements over how it should be handled. As a result of these and other clashes, Bondfield, MacDonald and the other League women resigned from the Council.<a href="#fn72" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref72"><sup>72</sup></a> In 1911 Bondfield assumed the role of the WLL's Organising Secretary,<a href="#fn73" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref73"><sup>73</sup></a> and spent much of the year travelling: she formed a WLL branch in <a href="Ogmore_Vale" title="wikilink">Ogmore Vale</a>, <a href="Glamorgan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Glamorgan</a>,<a href="#fn74" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref74"><sup>74</sup></a> reformed the Manchester branch,<a href="#fn75" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref75"><sup>75</sup></a> and found time to advise laundrywomen engaged in a dispute in South Wales.<a href="#fn76" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref76"><sup>76</sup></a> The sudden death of Mary MacDonald in September 1911 added considerably to Bondfield's workload; the strain, together with internal animosities within the WLL, led her to resign her position in January 1912. The League made strenuous efforts to retain her, and only in September did its committee reluctantly accept her departure.

According to the historian <a href="Robert_Skidelsky" title="wikilink">Robert Skidelsky</a>: &quot;Ministers worried about the finances of the [unemployment] fund; backbenchers worried about the finances of the unemployed&quot;.<a href="#fn149" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref149"><sup>149</sup></a> Under increasing pressure from the TUC, Bondfield introduced a bill which reversed the &quot;Blanesburgh&quot; restrictions on unemployment benefit introduced by the previous government, but with visible reluctance.

<p>Although not a candidate herself, Bondfield campaigned for Labour in the <a href="United_Kingdom_general_election,_1945" title="wikilink">general election of July 1945</a>&lt;U+2014&gt;a reporter found her instructing a meeting in <a href="Bury_St_Edmunds" title="wikilink">Bury St Edmunds</a> on the benefits of nationalisation.<a href="#fn174" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref174"><sup>174</sup></a> She was active in her local Labour Party, and continued to chair the Women's Group of Public Welfare until 1948.<a href="#fn175" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref175"><sup>175</sup></a>{{#tag:ref|After the war the Group changed its name to &quot;Women's Forum&quot;, and continued until 1980 when it closed through lack of funding.<a href="#fn176" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref176"><sup>176</sup></a> |group= n}} Her main task in these years was her autobiography, published in 1948 under the title <em>A Life's Work</em>. The purpose of the book, she wrote, was not to celebrate her own achievements but in the hope that her experiences &quot;may be of some service to the younger generation&quot;.<a href="#fn177" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref177"><sup>177</sup></a> The book had an indifferent reception; in <em><a href="The_Observer" title="wikilink">The Observer</a></em>, <a href="Harold_Nicolson" title="wikilink">Harold Nicolson</a> described it as &quot;ill composed and badly proportioned&quot;, with too much space devoted to inconsequential meetings while truly important events were hurried over.

Bondfield wrote that her religious convictions gave her &quot;strength to meet defeat with a smile, to face success with a sense of responsibility; to be willing to do one's best without hope of reward [and] to bear misrepresentation without giving way to futile bitterness&quot;.<a href="#fn180" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref180"><sup>180</sup></a> In March 1948 Bondfield opened the Mary Macarthur Home at <a href="Poulton-le-Fylde" class="uri" title="wikilink">Poulton-le-Fylde</a>, near <a href="Blackpool" class="uri" title="wikilink">Blackpool</a> in <a href="Lancashire" class="uri" title="wikilink">Lancashire</a>, which provided subsidised holidays for low-paid women workers.<a href="#fn181" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref181"><sup>181</sup></a> In 1949 she made a six-month speaking tour of the United States, her final visit to the country; she left convinced that America would soon adopt a national health service.<a href="#fn182" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref182"><sup>182</sup></a></p>
<p>Bondfield, who never married, maintained her good health and interest in life until her final illness in 1953.

<h2 id="appraisal-and-legacy">Appraisal and legacy</h2>
<p>In his biographical sketch for the <a href="Oxford_Dictionary_of_National_Biography" title="wikilink">Oxford Dictionary of National Biography</a>, Philip Williamson depicts Bondfield as &quot;physically short and stout ... with sparkling eyes, a firm, brisk manner, and effective, sometimes inspired, public speaking&quot;.<a href="#fn185" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref185"><sup>185</sup></a> She had the self-confidence to exist and thrive in a male-dominated world,<a href="#fn186" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref186"><sup>186</sup></a> deriving inspiration from a childhood which, though materially impoverished, her obituarist has described as &quot;of great spiritual and mental wealth&quot;.<a href="#fn187" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref187"><sup>187</sup></a> She inherited a strong <a href="nonconformist" class="uri" title="wikilink">nonconformist</a> faith, which became a key element throughout her later career,<a href="#fn188" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref188"><sup>188</sup></a> and retained her links with the Congregational Church throughout her life.<a href="#fn189" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref189"><sup>189</sup></a> After her death <em>The Times</em> praised her &quot;unusually wide human sympathies ... her generous nature and real sense of humour&quot;.<a href="#fn190" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref190"><sup>190</sup></a> Skidelsky, however, describes her unsympathetically as &quot;a humourless and somewhat priggish person, with long black skirts and a voice that emitted a harsh cascade of sound&quot;.<a href="#fn191" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref191"><sup>191</sup></a></p>
<p>Bondfield's career was punctuated by &quot;firsts&quot;, in union, parliament and government spheres.<a href="#fn192" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref192"><sup>192</sup></a><a href="#fn193" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref193"><sup>193</sup></a> Her own view of these achievements was modest: &quot;Some woman was bound to be first.

<p>Bondfield was awarded an honorary <a href="Honorary_degree" title="wikilink">Doctor of Laws</a> degree by the <a href="University_of_Bristol" title="wikilink">University of Bristol</a>, and in 1930 received the <a href="Freedom_of_the_City" title="wikilink">freedom of the borough</a> from her home town of Chard,<a href="#fn202" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref202"><sup>202</sup></a> where in 2011 a plaque in her honour was fixed to the Guildhall wall.<a href="#fn203" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref203"><sup>203</sup></a> In 1948 she was appointed a <a href="Companion_of_Honour" title="wikilink">Companion of Honour</a> (CH).<a href="#fn204" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref204"><sup>204</sup></a> Many years after her death, streets and apartment buildings were named after her in the London boroughs of <a href="London_Borough_of_Tower_Hamlets" title="wikilink">Tower Hamlets</a> and <a href="London_Borough_of_Barking_and_Dagenham" title="wikilink">Barking</a>;<a href="#fn205" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref205"><sup>205</sup></a><a href="#fn206" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref206"><sup>206</sup></a> she was further commemorated in her old constituency of Northampton when a hall of residence in the <a href="University_of_Northampton" title="wikilink">University of Northampton</a> was named the Margaret Bondfield Hall.<a href="#fn207" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref207"><sup>207</sup></a> In 2014 a campaign began for a plaque on the shop in Church Street, Hove, where in 1886&lt;U+2013&gt;67 Bondfield had served her apprenticeship.<a href="#fn208" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref208"><sup>208</sup></a></p>
<p>To mark Bondfield's centenary in 1973, Linda Christmas in <em>The Guardian</em> reviewed the progress of women in parliament since the 1930s. To that point, Christmas reported, only 93 women had sat in parliament; their contributions had overall &quot;not been stunning&quot;.<a href="#fn209" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref209"><sup>209</sup></a> Their best numerical showing had been in the 1966 general election, when 29 women (out of 630 MPs) had been elected.

Thatcher believed that the concept of service to the customer was absolute; thus, Cox and Hobley assert, she would have had little sympathy for Bondfield's campaigns to better shopworkers' conditions.<a href="#fn212" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref212"><sup>212</sup></a> Despite the changes that have taken place in the retail industry since Bondfield's day, Cox and Hobley believe that, were she alive, &quot;she'd still be champing at the bit, trying to coax shop assistants to join a union, and fiercely championing shopworkers' rights to better pay and conditions&quot;.<a href="#fn213" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref213"><sup>213</sup></a></p>
