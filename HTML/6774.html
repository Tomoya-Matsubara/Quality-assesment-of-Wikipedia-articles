<p><img src="NOAA-NDBC-discus-buoy.jpg" title="fig:Weather buoy operated by the NOAA National Data Buoy Center" alt="Weather buoy operated by the NOAA National Data Buoy Center" /> <strong>Weather buoys</strong> are instruments which collect <a href="weather" class="uri" title="wikilink">weather</a> and <a href="ocean" class="uri" title="wikilink">ocean</a> data within the world's oceans, as well as aiding during emergency response to <a href="chemical_accident" title="wikilink">chemical spills</a>, <a href="trial" title="wikilink">legal proceedings</a>, and <a href="engineering_design_process" title="wikilink">engineering design</a>. Moored <a href="buoy" title="wikilink">buoys</a> have been in used since 1951, while drifting buoys have been used since 1979. Moored buoys are connected with the ocean bottom using either <a href="chain" title="wikilink">chains</a>, <a href="nylon" class="uri" title="wikilink">nylon</a>, or buoyant <a href="polypropylene" class="uri" title="wikilink">polypropylene</a>. With the decline of the <a href="weather_ship" title="wikilink">weather ship</a>, they have taken a more primary role in measuring conditions over the open seas since the 1970's. During the 1980s and 1990s, a network of buoys in the central and eastern tropical Pacific ocean helped study the <a href="El_Ni&lt;U+00F1&gt;o-Southern_Oscillation" title="wikilink">El Ni&lt;U+00F1&gt;o-Southern Oscillation</a>. Moored weather buoys range from  to  in diameter, while drifting buoys are smaller, with diameters of  to . Drifting buoys are the dominant form of weather buoy in sheer number, with 1250 located worldwide. <a href="Wind" class="uri" title="wikilink">Wind</a> data from buoys has smaller error than that from ships. There are differences in the values of <a href="sea_surface_temperature" title="wikilink">sea surface temperature</a> measurements between the two platforms as well, relating to the depth of the measurement and whether or not the water is heated by the ship which measures the quantity.</p>

<p><img src="Weather_Buoy_MDS.jpg" title="fig:Weather Buoy / Data Buoy / Oceanographic Buoy operated by the Marine Data Service" alt="Weather Buoy / Data Buoy / Oceanographic Buoy operated by the Marine Data Service" /> The first known proposal for <a href="surface_weather_observation" title="wikilink">surface weather observations</a> at sea occurred in connection with aviation in August 1927, when Grover Loening stated that &quot;weather stations along the ocean coupled with the development of the <a href="seaplane" class="uri" title="wikilink">seaplane</a> to have an equally long range, would result in regular ocean flights within ten years.&quot;<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> Starting in 1939, <a href="United_States_Coast_Guard" title="wikilink">United States Coast Guard</a> vessels were being used as weather ships to protect transatlantic air commerce.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> The Navy Oceanographic Meteorological Automatic Device (NOMAD) buoy's  hull was originally designed in the 1940&lt;U+2019&gt;s for the <a href="United_States_Navy" title="wikilink">United States Navy</a>&lt;U+2019&gt;s offshore data collection program. Between 1951 and 1970, a total of 21 NOMAD buoys were built and deployed at sea.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> Since the 1970s, weather buoy use has superseded the role of weather ships by design, as they are cheaper to operate and maintain.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> Drifting buoys have been used since 1979, and as of 2005, 1250 drifting buoys roamed the Earth's oceans.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>Between 1985 and 1994, an extensive array of moored and drifting buoys was deployed across the equatorial Pacific Ocean designed to help monitor and predict the <a href="El_Ni&lt;U+00F1&gt;o-Southern_Oscillation" title="wikilink">El Ni&lt;U+00F1&gt;o</a> phenomenon.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> <a href="Hurricane_Katrina" title="wikilink">Hurricane Katrina</a> capsized a  buoy for the first time in the history of the <a href="National_Data_Buoy_Center" title="wikilink">National Data Buoy Center</a> (NDBC) on August 28, 2005.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> On June 13, 2006, drifting buoy 26028 ended its long-term data collection of <a href="sea_surface_temperature" title="wikilink">sea surface temperature</a> after transmitting for 10 years, 4 months, and 16 days, which is the longest known data collection time for any drifting buoy.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> The first weather buoy in the <a href="Southern_Ocean" title="wikilink">Southern Ocean</a> was deployed by the Integrated Marine Observing System (IMOS) on March 17, 2010.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="instrumentation">Instrumentation</h2>

<p>Weather buoys, like other types of weather stations, measure parameters such as <a href="air_temperature" title="wikilink">air temperature</a> above the ocean surface, <a href="wind" class="uri" title="wikilink">wind</a> speed (steady and gusting), <a href="barometric_pressure" title="wikilink">barometric pressure</a>, and wind direction. Since they lie in oceans and lakes, they also measure <a href="water" class="uri" title="wikilink">water</a> temperature, <a href="wave_height" title="wikilink">wave height</a>, and dominant <a href="wave_period" title="wikilink">wave period</a>.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> Raw data is processed and can be logged on board the buoy and then transmitted via radio, cellular, or <a href="satellite_communications" title="wikilink">satellite communications</a> to <a href="meteorological" class="uri" title="wikilink">meteorological</a> centers for use in weather forecasting and climate study. Both moored buoys and drifting buoys (drifting in the open ocean currents) are used. Fixed buoys measure the water temperature at a depth of .<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> Many different drifting buoys exist around the world that vary in design and the location of reliable temperature sensors varies.

<h2 id="types">Types</h2>
<p><img src="Mooredbuoytypes.gif" title="fig:Types of moored buoys used by the National Data Buoy Center" alt="Types of moored buoys used by the National Data Buoy Center" /> Weather buoys can be recognized by their yellow color and flashing yellow light at night, and range in diameter from  to . Those that are placed in shallow waters are smaller in size and moored using only chains, while those in deeper waters use a combination of chains, nylon, and buoyant polypropylene.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> Discus buoys are round and moored in deep ocean locations, with a diameter of  to .<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> The aluminum  buoy is a very rugged meteorological ocean platform that has long term survivability. The expected service life of the  platform is in excess of 20 years and properly maintained, these buoys have not been retired due to corrosion. The NOMAD is a unique moored aluminum environmental monitoring buoy designed for deployments in extreme conditions near the coast and across the <a href="Great_Lakes" title="wikilink">Great Lakes</a>.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> NOMADs moored off the Canadian coast commonly experience winter storms with maximum wave heights approaching .</p>
<p>Drifting buoys are smaller than their moored counterparts, measuring  to  in diameter. They are made of plastic or fiberglass, and tend to be either bi-colored, with white on one half and another color on the other half of the float, or solidly black or blue. It measures a smaller subset of meteorological variables when compared to its moored counterpart, with a barometer measuring pressure in a tube on its top. They have a thermistor (metalic thermometer) on its base, and an underwater <a href="drogue" class="uri" title="wikilink">drogue</a>, or sea anchor, located  below the ocean surface connected with the buoy by a long, thin tether.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>

<p>A large network of coastal buoys near the United States is maintained by the National Data Buoy Center,<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> with deployment and maintenance performed by the United States Coast Guard.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> For <a href="South_Africa" title="wikilink">South Africa</a>, the <a href="South_African_Weather_Service" title="wikilink">South African Weather Service</a> deploys and retrieves they own buoys, while the <a href="Meteorological_Service_of_New_Zealand" title="wikilink">Meteorological Service of New Zealand</a> performs the same task for their country.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> <a href="Environment_Canada" title="wikilink">Environment Canada</a> operates and deploys buoys for their country.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> The <a href="Met_Office" title="wikilink">Met Office</a> in <a href="Great_Britain" title="wikilink">Great Britain</a> deploys drifting buoys across both the northern and southern Atlantic oceans.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="comparison-to-data-from-ships">Comparison to data from ships</h2>
<p>Wind reports from moored buoys have smaller error than those from ships.
