<p>The battle of the <strong>Falaise Pocket</strong>, fought during the <a href="Second_World_War" title="wikilink">Second World War</a> from 12–21 August 1944, was the decisive engagement of the <a href="Battle_of_Normandy" title="wikilink">Battle of Normandy</a>. Taking its name from the area around the town of <a href="Falaise,_Calvados" title="wikilink">Falaise</a> within which the German <a href="7th_Army_(Germany)" title="wikilink">Seventh</a> and <a href="5th_Panzer_Army_(Germany)" title="wikilink">Fifth Panzer</a> Armies became encircled by the advancing <a href="Western_Allies" title="wikilink">Western Allies</a>, the battle is also referred to as the <strong>Falaise Gap</strong> after the corridor which the Germans sought to maintain to allow their escape.{{#tag:ref|The engagement is also sometimes referred to as the Chambois pocket, the Falaise-Chambois pocket, the Argentan-Falaise pocket,<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> or the Trun-Chanbois gap.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a>|group=nb}} The battle resulted in the destruction of the bulk of Germany's forces west of the River <a href="Seine" class="uri" title="wikilink">Seine</a>, and opened the way to Paris and the German border.</p>
<p>Following <a href="Operation_Cobra" title="wikilink">Operation Cobra</a>, the successful American breakout from the Normandy <a href="beachhead" class="uri" title="wikilink">beachhead</a>, rapid advances were made to the south, the south-east, and into <a href="Brittany" class="uri" title="wikilink">Brittany</a>. Despite lacking the resources to cope with both the US penetration and simultaneous British and Canadian offensives around <a href="Caen" class="uri" title="wikilink">Caen</a>, Field Marshal <a href="G&lt;U+00FC&gt;nther_von_Kluge" title="wikilink">G&lt;U+00FC&gt;nther von Kluge</a>, in overall command of German armed forces on the <a href="Western_Front_(WWII)" title="wikilink">Western Front</a>, was not permitted by <a href="Adolf_Hitler" title="wikilink">Adolf Hitler</a> to withdraw; instead he was ordered to counterattack the Americans around <a href="Mortain" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mortain</a>. However, the remnants of four <a href="panzer_division" title="wikilink">panzer divisions</a>, which was all that von Kluge could scrape together, were not strong enough to make any impression on the United States <a href="First_United_States_Army" title="wikilink">First Army</a>, and <a href="Operation_L&lt;U+00FC&gt;ttich" title="wikilink">Operation L&lt;U+00FC&gt;ttich</a> was a disaster that merely served to drive the Germans deeper into the Allied lines, leaving them in a highly dangerous position. Seizing the opportunity to envelop von Kluge's entire force, on 8 August the Allied ground forces commander Field Marshal <a href="Bernard_Montgomery,_1st_Viscount_Montgomery_of_Alamein" title="wikilink">Bernard Montgomery</a> ordered his armies to converge on the Falaise–Chambois area. With the US First Army forming the southern arm, the British <a href="Second_Army_(United_Kingdom)" title="wikilink">Second Army</a> the base, and the Canadian <a href="First_Canadian_Army" title="wikilink">First Army</a> the northern arm of the encirclement, the Germans fought hard to keep an escape route open, although their withdrawal did not begin until 17 August. On 19 August the Allies linked up in Chambois but in insufficient strength to completely seal the pocket. Gaps were forced in the Allied lines by desperate German assaults, the most significant and hard-fought being a corridor past elements of the Polish <a href="1st_Armoured_Division_(Poland)" title="wikilink">1st Armoured Division</a>, who had established a commanding position in the mouth of the pocket.</p>
<p>By the evening of 21 August the pocket was closed for the last time, with around 50,000 Germans still trapped inside. Although it is estimated that significant numbers managed to escape, German losses in both men and materiel were huge, and the Allies had achieved a decisive victory. Two days later Paris was <a href="Liberation_of_Paris" title="wikilink">liberated</a>, and by 30 August the last German remnants had retreated across the Seine, effectively ending <a href="Operation_Overlord" title="wikilink">Operation Overlord</a>.</p>
<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>Early Allied objectives in the wake of the successful <a href="Operation_Overlord" title="wikilink">D-Day</a> invasion of German-occupied France included both the <a href="deep_water_port" title="wikilink">deep water port</a> of <a href="Cherbourg" class="uri" title="wikilink">Cherbourg</a> and the area surrounding the historic Normandy town of <a href="Caen" class="uri" title="wikilink">Caen</a>.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> However, attempts to rapidly expand the Allied lodgement areas met fierce opposition, and adverse weather conditions in the English Channel delayed the build-up of supplies and reinforcements.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a><a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> Cherbourg was able to hold out until 27 June, when it fell to the US VII Corps,<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> and Caen resisted a number of offensives until 20 July, when it was taken by the British and Canadians during Operations <a href="Operation_Goodwood" title="wikilink">Goodwood</a> and <a href="Operation_Atlantic" title="wikilink">Atlantic</a>.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a></p>

<p>Still expecting von Kluge to withdraw his forces from the tightening Allied noose, Montgomery had for some time been planning a &quot;long envelopment&quot;, by which the British and Canadians would pivot left from Falaise towards the River Seine while the US Third Army blocked the escape route between the Seine and Loire rivers, trapping all surviving German forces in western France.<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a> However, in a telephone conversation on 8 August, the <a href="Supreme_Headquarters_Allied_Expeditionary_Force" title="wikilink">Supreme Allied Commander</a> General <a href="Dwight_D._Eisenhower" title="wikilink">Dwight D.

<p>Disappointed that a significant portion of Seventh Army had eluded them, many in the Allied higher echelons—particularly among the Americans—were bitterly critical of what they perceived as Montgomery's lack of urgency in closing the pocket.<a href="#fn109" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref109"><sup>109</sup></a> Some historians agree that the gap could have been closed earlier; Wilmot notes that despite having British divisions in reserve Montgomery did not reinforce Simonds, and neither was the Canadian drive on Trun and Chambois as &quot;vigorous and venturesome&quot; as the situation demanded.<a href="#fn110" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref110"><sup>110</sup></a> Hastings writes that Montgomery, having witnessed what he characterises as a poor Canadian performance during Totalize, should have brought up veteran British divisions to take the lead.<a href="#fn111" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref111"><sup>111</sup></a> However, while acknowledging that Montgomery and Crerar might have done more to impart momentum to the British and Canadians, these and others such as D'Este and Blumenson dismiss as &quot;absurd over-simplification&quot; Patton's post-battle claim that the Americans could have prevented the German escape had Bradley not ordered him to stop at Argentan.<a href="#fn112" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref112"><sup>112</sup></a> Patton's troops did not take Argentan until 20 August—the day after the Poles and Canadians captured Chambois—and the American unit that closed the gap between Argentan and Chambois, the <a href="90th_Sustainment_Brigade_(United_States)" title="wikilink">90th Division</a>, was according to Hastings one of the least effective of any Allied army in Normandy. He speculates that the real reason Bradley halted Patton was not fears over accidental clashes with the British but an appreciation that with powerful German formations still effective at that stage of the battle, the Americans lacked the means to defend an early blocking position and would have suffered an &quot;embarrassing and gratuitous setback&quot; at the hands of the retreating <em><a href="Fallschirmj&lt;U+00E4&gt;ger" class="uri" title="wikilink">Fallschirmj&lt;U+00E4&gt;ger</a></em> and 2nd and 12th SS Panzer Divisions.<a href="#fn113" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref113"><sup>113</sup></a></p>
