This building was replaced with College Hall in 1891. The Westcott Building now stands on this site - the oldest site of higher education in Florida" width="320" /> Florida State University is one of the two oldest of the eleven institutions of higher learning in the State University System of Florida. Florida State University traces its origins to 1823 when the Territorial Legislature of Florida began planning a system of higher education.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> Two townships were set aside by the <a href="United_States_Congress" title="wikilink">United States Congress</a> for seminaries of higher learning, one on each side of the <a href="Suwannee_River" title="wikilink">Suwannee River</a>. By 1838, the first constitution of the State of Florida embraced and permanently guaranteed to provide for this system of general education (schools) and higher education (seminaries).<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> On January 24, 1851 the State of Florida Legislature established the two seminaries.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> A bitter competition then ensued between the cities of <a href="Marianna,_FL" title="wikilink">Marianna, FL</a>, <a href="Quincy,_FL" title="wikilink">Quincy, FL</a> and Tallahassee for the <strong>West Florida Seminary</strong>. By 1854, as an inducement to the Legislature, the leaders of <a href="Tallahassee" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tallahassee</a> built and operated an all-male academy called the Florida Institute in Tallahassee.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> <a href="Francis_W._Eppes" title="wikilink">Francis W. Eppes</a>, the grandson of <a href="Thomas_Jefferson" title="wikilink">Thomas Jefferson</a> and who grew up on <a href="Monticello" class="uri" title="wikilink">Monticello</a>, with the help of other city leaders, eventually won the competition for the location, which awarded Tallahassee the west seminary by the <a href="Florida_Legislature" title="wikilink">Florida Legislature</a> in 1856. <img src="Francis_Wayles_Eppes.jpg" title="fig:Francis W. Eppes VII" alt="Francis W. Eppes VII" width="175" /> The rise of land slightly west of the center of Tallahassee, formerly known as <a href="Gallows" class="uri" title="wikilink">Gallows</a> <a href="Hill" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hill</a>, (and which was the site and building of the ongoing Florida Institute) was offered and accepted as the site of the state seminary for male students. While the seminary did not officially hold classes until 1857, it absorbed the Tallahassee Female Academy<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a>, begun in 1843 as the Misses Bates School, thereby becoming co-educational.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> As a result of this merger Florida State University is the oldest university in Florida, with clear predecessor operations traceable to 1843, about two years before Florida became a state of the United States. The West Florida Seminary stood near the front of the Westcott Building on the existing FSU campus.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> This site is the oldest continually used location of higher learning in Florida.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a><a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a>The eastern seminary was located in <a href="Ocala,_FL" title="wikilink">Ocala, FL</a> in 1853 and was closed during the <a href="American_Civil_War" title="wikilink">American Civil War</a>. It reopened in 1866 in <a href="Gainesville,_FL" title="wikilink">Gainesville, FL</a> (and would eventually be combined with other schools to form what would be called the <a href="University_of_Florida" title="wikilink">University of Florida</a> in 1906).<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a></p>
<p>During the Civil War the name of the seminary was changed to <strong>The Florida Military and Collegiate Institute</strong> and began military training for students. Young cadets from the school, along with other soldiers from Tallahassee, defeated Union forces at the <a href="Battle_of_Natural_Bridge" title="wikilink">Battle of Natural Bridge</a> in 1865 .<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a><a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> As a result, Tallahassee was the only Confederate capital east of the <a href="Mississippi_River" title="wikilink">Mississippi River</a> not to fall to Union forces. The Army <a href="ROTC" class="uri" title="wikilink">ROTC</a> unit at Florida State University is one of only three ROTC units in the United States with permission to display a <a href="campaign_streamer" title="wikilink">campaign streamer</a>. The Florida State University ROTC streamer reads NATURAL BRIDGE 1865. After the fall of the Confederacy, campus buildings were occupied by Union forces for over a month. The West Florida Seminary reverted to a purely academic purpose after the war, and began a period of substantial growth and development. In <a href="1884" class="uri" title="wikilink">1884</a>, the school awarded its first diplomas, called Licentiates of Instruction. In 1885 the Florida Legislature renamed the seminary the <strong>University of Florida</strong> in a law which was part of an effort by the Board of Education to reorganize Florida's system of higher education. The school never embraced the title, apparently due to lack of funding from the Florida Legislature, but when other schools eventually tried to adopt the name &quot;University of Florida&quot; about 20 years later, officials from the Florida State College reminded the newcomers of the law and the original holder of the title in a 1903 university publication.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> By 1891 the seminary began to focus on what would be recognized today as post-secondary education and as of 1897 was clearly the first <a href="liberal_arts" title="wikilink">liberal arts</a> college in Florida.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a></p>
<p><img src="FSC_rc00002.jpg" title="fig:College Hall, circa 1903" alt="College Hall, circa 1903" width="350" /> In 1901 the seminary was renamed the <strong>Florida State College</strong> and was organized into four departments (the College, the College Academy, the School for Teachers and the School of Music). Florida State College was a four-year institution with authority to award the <a href="Master_of_Arts" title="wikilink">Master of Arts</a> graduate degree. The first <a href="master&#39;s_degree" title="wikilink">master's degree</a> was issued by the college in 1902.</p>
<p>The 1905 Buckman Act reorganized the existing seven Florida colleges into three institutions, <a href="segregated" class="uri" title="wikilink">segregated</a> by <a href="race" class="uri" title="wikilink">race</a> and <a href="gender" class="uri" title="wikilink">gender</a> - a school for <a href="Caucasian" class="uri" title="wikilink">Caucasian</a> <a href="males" class="uri" title="wikilink">males</a>, a school for Caucasian <a href="females" class="uri" title="wikilink">females</a> and a school for <a href="African_Americans" title="wikilink">African Americans</a>. As a result of this reorganization, the coeducational Florida State College was renamed the <strong>Florida Female College</strong>, (which by 1909 was changed to the <strong>Florida State College for Women</strong> (FSCW) after the initial women's title was generally rejected) and accepted only white female students.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> All male students were subsequently required to attend the school for males, taking with them the fraternity system and the football team. The Buckman bill was the brainchild of H.H. Buckman, a legislator from Duval County, Florida. The Buckman bill was hotly debated, one legislator said in debate: &quot;I believe in coeducation. Statistics prove satisfactory to me that separate institutions for male and female is detrimental (sic) to both--physically, mentally and morally.&quot;<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> Further, per Shira Birnbaum, Ph.D in her article <em>Making Southern belles in progressive era Florida: Gender in the formal and hidden curriculum of the Florida Female College</em> (Frontiers: A Journal of Women Studies, 1996) the Buckman Act:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>didn't merely standardize, consolidate and narrow opportunities for public higher education in Florida. It also inaugurated an era of new school gender practices. Right from the start, in fact, the Buckman Act's message to Florida's women was that the highest levels of educational attainment--the advanced degrees and professional schools of a &quot;university education--would be reserved for white males attending the new all-male University of the State of Florida. White women, by contrast, had to settle for a &quot;college.&quot; Furthermore, the Buckman Act mandated that the university would &quot;teach...the fundamental laws and...the rights and duties of citizens ...&quot; to its male students. The college, by contrast, would &quot;teach...all the useful arts and sciences that may be necessary or appropriate.&quot; A dual discourse had been laid out--one that framed education for white men as a matter of &quot;citizenship&quot; and education for white women as a matter of &quot;usefulness&quot;.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>A residence hall currently on the campus of the University of Florida bears the name <a href="Buckman_Hall" title="wikilink">Buckman Hall</a> in honor of the legislator. Curiously, no equivalent building exists on the campus of Florida State University.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a></p>
<p>Despite the impact of the Buckman Act, <a href="Albert_A._Murphree" title="wikilink">Albert A. Murphree</a>, then President of the Florida State College, determined to stress liberal studies and academic excellence.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> By 1933 the Florida State College for Women had grown to be the third largest women&lt;U+2019&gt;s college in the United States.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> In <a href="1935" class="uri" title="wikilink">1935</a>, the College was awarded the <a href="Alpha" class="uri" title="wikilink">Alpha</a> Chapter of <a href="Phi_Beta_Kappa" title="wikilink">Phi Beta Kappa</a> in Florida.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a><a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> The Florida State College for Women was the first state women's college in the <a href="South" class="uri" title="wikilink">South</a> to be awarded a chapter of Phi Beta Kappa, as well as the first university in Florida to be so honored for academic quality.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> <img src="Westcott_rc05025.jpg" title="fig:Westcott Building, circa 1933" alt="Westcott Building, circa 1933" width="320" /> After <a href="World_War_II" title="wikilink">World War II</a>, returning soldiers taking advantage of the new <a href="GI_Bill_of_Rights" title="wikilink">GI Bill of Rights</a> placed an unexpectedly heavy demand on the state university system. The Tallahassee Branch of the University of Florida (TBUF) was quickly opened on the campus of the Florida State College for Women.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a><a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> The men were housed in former <a href="barracks" class="uri" title="wikilink">barracks</a> on <a href="Dale_Mabry_Field" title="wikilink">Dale Mabry Field</a>, an existing WWII <a href="U.S._Army_Air_Force" title="wikilink">U.S. Army Air Force</a> training field west of Tallahassee, that was deactivated in part after the war. Male students were then enrolled into the Florida State College for Women and traveled to the main campus by bus. Part of Dale Mabry Field became known as &quot;West Campus&quot; during this brief period. By the end of the 1946-1947 school year, 954 men were enrolled in the TBUF program. By 1947 the Florida Legislature returned the FSCW to coeducational status and renamed the Florida State College for Women <strong>Florida State University</strong>.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> The FSU West Campus land and barracks plus other areas continually used as an <a href="airport" class="uri" title="wikilink">airport</a> later became the location of the <a href="Tallahassee_Community_College" title="wikilink">Tallahassee Community College</a>. <img src="Westcott_8445.jpg" title="fig:Westcott Building circa 2003" alt="Westcott Building circa 2003" width="480" /> The 1950s brought substantial growth and development to the university. Several colleges were added and the first <a href="Ph.D." class="uri" title="wikilink">Ph.D.</a> was awarded in <a href="Chemistry" class="uri" title="wikilink">Chemistry</a> by 1952 . Many buildings recognizable today were added to the university such as the Strozier Library, Tully Gymnasium and the original parts of the Business building. Programs supplementing the original liberal arts and education departments were added including Business, <a href="Journalism" class="uri" title="wikilink">Journalism</a> (discontinued in 1959), <a href="Library_Science" title="wikilink">Library Science</a>, <a href="Nursing" class="uri" title="wikilink">Nursing</a> and Social Welfare. Social Welfare was later split into the College of <a href="Criminology" class="uri" title="wikilink">Criminology</a> and the College of <a href="Social_Work" title="wikilink">Social Work</a>.</p>
<p>During the 1960s and 1970s Florida State University was known as a center of <a href="student_activism" title="wikilink">student activism</a> especially in the areas of <a href="racial_integration" title="wikilink">racial integration</a>, <a href="women&#39;s_rights" title="wikilink">women's rights</a> and the <a href="Vietnam_War" title="wikilink">Vietnam War</a>. The school acquired the nickname 'Berkeley of the South'<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> during this period, in reference to similar student activities at the <a href="University_of_California,_Berkeley" title="wikilink">University of California, Berkeley</a> and is also purported to be the site of the genesis of &quot;<a href="streaking" class="uri" title="wikilink">streaking</a>,&quot; which is said to have first been observed on Landis Green.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a><a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> Governor <a href="Claude_Kirk" title="wikilink">Claude Kirk</a> once spent a night on Landis Green, in the center of campus, discussing politics with protesting students. Elements of free speech activism still exist at FSU today. The Center for Participant Education was established in 1970 as an alternative to traditional university academics. Its purpose is to allow students to &quot;<em>explore socially relevant topics and to foster a healthier philosophy of education through classes in which anyone could teach or attend. Since then, CPE has been investigated by the Legislature, suspended by the Board of Regents, and challenged by FSU administration. CPE has managed to hold strong through all of this, and remains today as one of the last free universities in the country.</em>&quot;<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> Florida State also established the Institute of Molecular <a href="Biophysics" class="uri" title="wikilink">Biophysics</a>, Space Biosciences and the Programs in Medical Studies. In 1962 the first <a href="African_American" title="wikilink">African American</a> student enrolled at the university and the first African American Ph.D. students graduated in 1970.</p>
<p>Today, Florida State University aspires to become a top American research university with at least one-third of its graduate programs ranked in the Top-15 nationally. Florida State University owns more than 1,530 acres (6.2km&lt;U+00B2&gt;)<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> and is the home of the <a href="National_High_Magnetic_Field_Laboratory" title="wikilink">National High Magnetic Field Laboratory</a> among other advanced research facilities.

<p>Hymn to the Garnet and Gold: Here's a hymn to the Garnet and the Gold, ringing to the sky. Here's a song for the men and women bold. Sing with heads held high. Striving ere to seek to know, Fight for victory. Alma Mater, this our song to you. Echoes, F.S.U.</p>
<p><strong>FSU Fight Song</strong> <em>You've got to fight, fight, fight, for FSU, You've got to scalp 'em Seminoles, You've got to win, win, win, win this game, And roll on down to make those goals, For FSU is on the warpath now, and at the battle's end she's great.

Many came into being after the Morrill Act of 1863 provided the federal grants of land to the states to establish public universities.

Owing to lack of means for the support of this more ambitious project, and also owing to the fact that soon thereafter schools for technical training were established, this association soon dissolved. It remains to be remarked, however, that the legislative act passed in 1885, bestowing upon the institution the title of the University of Florida, has never been repealed.
