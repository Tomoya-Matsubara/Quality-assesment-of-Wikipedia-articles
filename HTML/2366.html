<p><strong><em>Doctor Who</em></strong> is a long-running <a href="United_Kingdom" title="wikilink">British</a> <a href="science_fiction_on_television" title="wikilink">science fiction television</a> programme produced by the <a href="BBC" class="uri" title="wikilink">BBC</a> about a mysterious <a href="time_travel" title="wikilink">time-travelling</a> adventurer known only as &quot;<a href="Doctor_(Doctor_Who)" title="wikilink">The Doctor</a>&quot;, who explores time and space with his companions, fighting evil. It is also the title of a <a href="Doctor_Who_(1996)" title="wikilink">1996 television movie</a> featuring the same character. It is common to see the show's title abbreviated as <strong><em>Dr Who</em></strong>, even by the BBC, although <a href="purist" title="wikilink">purists</a> consider this form incorrect.</p>
<p>The programme is one of the longest-running science fiction television series in the world and also a significant part of British <a href="popular_culture" title="wikilink">popular culture</a>. It has been recognised for its imaginative stories, creative low-budget <a href="special_effects" title="wikilink">special effects</a> and pioneering use of electronic music (originally produced by the <a href="BBC_Radiophonic_Workshop" title="wikilink">BBC Radiophonic Workshop</a>). Elements of the programme are well known and identifiable even to non-fans. In Britain and elsewhere, the show has become a <a href="cult_television" title="wikilink">cult television</a> favourite on a par with <em><a href="Star_Trek" title="wikilink">Star Trek</a></em> and has influenced generations of British television writers, many of whom grew up watching the series. It has received <a href="#Awards" title="wikilink">recognition</a> from critics and the public as one of the finest British television programmes, including a <a href="British_Academy_Television_Awards" title="wikilink">BAFTA Award</a> for Best Drama Series in 2006.</p>
<p>The programme originally ran from 1963 to 1989. A <a href="Doctor_Who_(1996)" title="wikilink">television movie</a> was made in 1996, and the programme was successfully <a href="History_of_Doctor_Who#The_2000s" title="wikilink">relaunched</a> in 2005, produced in-house by <a href="BBC_Wales" title="wikilink">BBC Wales</a>. Some development money is contributed by the <a href="Canadian_Broadcasting_Corporation" title="wikilink">Canadian Broadcasting Corporation</a> (CBC), which is credited as a co-producer in overseas markets, although they do not have creative input into the series. The <a href="United_States" title="wikilink">United States</a> broadcast of the <a href="List_of_Doctor_Who_serials#Series_1_(2005)" title="wikilink">2005 series</a> began on <a href="March_17" title="wikilink">March 17</a> <a href="2006" class="uri" title="wikilink">2006</a> on the <a href="Sci_Fi_Channel_(United_States)" title="wikilink">Sci Fi Channel</a>.</p>

The programme was born out of discussions and plans that had been going on for a year. The <a href="BBC_television_drama" title="wikilink">Head of Drama</a>, <a href="Sydney_Newman" title="wikilink">Sydney Newman</a>, was mainly responsible for developing it, with contributions by the Head of the Script Department (later Head of Serials), <a href="Donald_Wilson" title="wikilink">Donald Wilson</a>, staff writer <a href="C._E._Webber" title="wikilink">C. E. 'Bunny' Webber</a>, writer <a href="Anthony_Coburn" title="wikilink">Anthony Coburn</a>, <a href="script_editor" title="wikilink">story editor</a> <a href="David_Whitaker" title="wikilink">David Whitaker</a> and initial <a href="Television_producer" title="wikilink">producer</a>, <a href="Verity_Lambert" title="wikilink">Verity Lambert</a>. The series' distinctive, haunting title theme was composed by <a href="Ron_Grainer" title="wikilink">Ron Grainer</a> and realised by <a href="Delia_Derbyshire" title="wikilink">Delia Derbyshire</a> of the BBC Radiophonic Workshop.</p>
<p>The BBC drama department's Serials division produced the programme for twenty-six seasons, on <a href="BBC_One" title="wikilink">BBC One</a>. Falling viewing numbers, a decline in the public perception of the show and a less prominent transmission slot saw production suspended in 1989 by <a href="Jonathan_Powell" title="wikilink">Jonathan Powell</a>, Controller of BBC One. Although it was for all intents and purposes cancelled (series co-star <a href="Sophie_Aldred" title="wikilink">Sophie Aldred</a> said in the documentary <em>Doctor Who: More Than 30 Years in the TARDIS</em> that she was told it was cancelled), the BBC maintained the series was merely &quot;on hiatus&quot; and insisted the show would return.</p>
<p>While in-house production had ceased, the BBC was hopeful of finding an independent production company to re-launch the show. <a href="Philip_Segal" title="wikilink">Philip Segal</a>, a British <a href="expatriate" class="uri" title="wikilink">expatriate</a> who worked for <a href="Columbia_Pictures" title="wikilink">Columbia Pictures</a>' television arm in the <a href="United_States" title="wikilink">United States</a>, approached the BBC about such a venture. Segal's negotiations eventually led to a <a href="television_movie" title="wikilink">television movie</a>. The <a href="Doctor_Who_(1996)" title="wikilink">movie</a> was broadcast on the <a href="Fox_Broadcasting_Company" title="wikilink">Fox Network</a> in 1996 as a co-production between Fox, <a href="Universal_Studios" title="wikilink">Universal Pictures</a>, the <a href="BBC" class="uri" title="wikilink">BBC</a>, and <a href="BBC_Worldwide" title="wikilink">BBC Worldwide</a>. However, although the film was successful in the UK (with 9.1 million viewers), it was less so in the <a href="United_States" title="wikilink">United States</a> (possibly due to poor scheduling) and did not lead to a series.</p>
<p>Although <a href="Doctor_Who_spin-offs" title="wikilink">licensed</a> media such as novels and audio plays provided new stories, the programme remained dormant until 2003. In September of that year, BBC Television announced the production of a new in-house series after several years of unsuccessful attempts by BBC Worldwide to find backing for a feature film version.</p>
<p>The new series debuted with the episode <em><a href="Rose_(Doctor_Who)" title="wikilink">Rose</a></em> on BBC One on <a href="March_26" title="wikilink">March 26</a> <a href="2005" class="uri" title="wikilink">2005</a> and the series has since been sold to many other countries (see <a href="#Viewership" title="wikilink">Viewership</a>). The programme debuted on the American <a href="Sci_Fi_Channel_(United_States)" title="wikilink">Sci-Fi Channel</a> on <a href="17_March" title="wikilink">17 March</a> <a href="2006" class="uri" title="wikilink">2006</a>, one year after the UK showings.</p>
<p>On <a href="March_30" title="wikilink">March 30</a> <a href="2005" class="uri" title="wikilink">2005</a>, the BBC gave the go-ahead for a second series and Christmas special. On <a href="June_15" title="wikilink">June 15</a> <a href="2005" class="uri" title="wikilink">2005</a>, it was announced that another Christmas special and a third series had been commissioned.</p>
<h2 id="format">Format</h2>
<p>During the original 1963&lt;U+2013&gt;1989 run, each of the weekly episodes formed part of a story (or &quot;<a href="Serial#Film" title="wikilink">serial</a>&quot;) of several parts â€” usually four to six in earlier years and three to four in later years. Three notable exceptions were the epic <em><a href="The_Daleks&#39;_Master_Plan" title="wikilink">The Daleks' Master Plan</a></em>, which aired in 12 episodes (plus a one-episode teaser titled <em><a href="Mission_to_the_Unknown" title="wikilink">Mission to the Unknown</a></em>, featuring none of the regular cast); the 10-episode serial <em><a href="The_War_Games" title="wikilink">The War Games</a></em>; and <em><a href="The_Trial_of_a_Time_Lord" title="wikilink">The Trial of a Time Lord</a></em>, which ran for 14 episodes (containing four stories often referred to by individual titles, and connected by framing sequences) during <a href="List_of_Doctor_Who_serials#Season_23_(1986)" title="wikilink">Season 23</a>.</p>
<p>The programme was intended to be educational and for family viewing on the early Saturday evening schedule. The idea was to alternate stories set during important periods of human history (such as the <a href="French_Revolution" title="wikilink">French Revolution</a>, the <a href="Roman_Empire" title="wikilink">Roman Empire</a>, or the <a href="Battle_of_Culloden_Moor" title="wikilink">Battle of Culloden Moor</a>), which would educate younger audience members about those events, while stories set either in the future or in outer space would enlighten them about science. This was also reflected in the Doctor's original companions, one of whom was a science teacher and another a history teacher.</p>
<p>However, science fiction stories came to dominate the series and the &quot;historicals&quot;, which were not popular with the production team, were dropped after the first years. While the series continued to use historical settings, they were generally used as a backdrop for science fiction tales. The series featured only one more purely historical story during its original run: the 1982 serial <em><a href="Black_Orchid_(Doctor_Who)" title="wikilink">Black Orchid</a></em>, set in 1920s Britain.</p>
<p>The programme rapidly became a national institution, the subject of countless jokes, newspaper mentions and other popular culture references. Many renowned actors asked for or were offered and accepted <a href="Celebrity_appearances_in_Doctor_Who" title="wikilink">guest starring roles</a> in various stories.</p>
<p>There was some controversy over the show's suitability for children. The moral campaigner, <a href="Mary_Whitehouse" title="wikilink">Mary Whitehouse</a>, made a series of complaints to the BBC in the 1970s over its sometimes frightening or gory content. Ironically, her actions made the programme even more popular, especially with children. <a href="John_Nathan-Turner" title="wikilink">John Nathan-Turner</a>, who produced the series during the 1980s, was heard to say that he looked forward to Whitehouse's comments, as the show's ratings would increase soon after she had made them. During the 1970s, the <em><a href="Radio_Times" title="wikilink">Radio Times</a></em>, the BBC's listings magazine, announced that a child's mother said the theme music terrified her son. The <em>Radio Times</em> was apologetic, but the theme music remained.</p>
<p>There were more complaints about the programme's content than its music. During <a href="Jon_Pertwee" title="wikilink">Jon Pertwee</a>'s <a href="List_of_Doctor_Who_serials#Season_8_(1971)" title="wikilink">second season</a> as the Doctor, in the serial <em><a href="Terror_of_the_Autons" title="wikilink">Terror of the Autons</a></em>, images of murderous plastic dolls, daffodils killing unsuspecting victims and blank-featured android policemen marked the apex of the show's ability to frighten children. Other notable moments in that decade included the Doctor apparently being drowned by Chancellor Goth in <em><a href="The_Deadly_Assassin" title="wikilink">The Deadly Assassin</a></em>, and the supposedly negative portrayal of Chinese people in <em><a href="The_Talons_of_Weng-Chiang" title="wikilink">The Talons of Weng-Chiang</a></em>.</p>
<p>It has been said that watching <em>Doctor Who</em> from a position of safety &quot;<a href="behind_the_sofa" title="wikilink">behind the sofa</a>&quot; (as the <em>Doctor Who</em> exhibition at the <a href="Museum_of_the_Moving_Image" title="wikilink">Museum of the Moving Image</a> in London was titled) and peering cautiously out to see if the scary bit was over is one of the great shared experiences of British childhood. The phrase has become a common phrase in association with the programme and occasionally elsewhere.</p>
<p><em>Doctor Who</em> originally ran for <a href="List_of_Doctor_Who_serials" title="wikilink">26 seasons</a> on the BBC, from <a href="November_23" title="wikilink">November 23</a>, <a href="1963" class="uri" title="wikilink">1963</a> until <a href="December_6" title="wikilink">December 6</a>, <a href="1989" class="uri" title="wikilink">1989</a>. Writers over the years have included <a href="Terry_Nation" title="wikilink">Terry Nation</a>, <a href="Henry_Lincoln" title="wikilink">Henry Lincoln</a>, <a href="Douglas_Adams" title="wikilink">Douglas Adams</a>, <a href="Robert_Holmes_(scriptwriter)" title="wikilink">Robert Holmes</a>, <a href="Terrance_Dicks" title="wikilink">Terrance Dicks</a>, <a href="Dennis_Spooner" title="wikilink">Dennis Spooner</a>, <a href="Eric_Saward" title="wikilink">Eric Saward</a>, <a href="Malcolm_Hulke" title="wikilink">Malcolm Hulke</a>, <a href="Christopher_H._Bidmead" title="wikilink">Christopher H. Bidmead</a>, <a href="Stephen_Gallagher" title="wikilink">Stephen Gallagher</a>, <a href="Brian_Hayles" title="wikilink">Brian Hayles</a>, <a href="Chris_Boucher" title="wikilink">Chris Boucher</a>, <a href="Marc_Platt" title="wikilink">Marc Platt</a> and <a href="Ben_Aaronovitch" title="wikilink">Ben Aaronovitch</a>.</p>
<p>Over 700 <em>Doctor Who</em> instalments have been televised since 1963, ranging from 25-minute episodes (the most common format), to 50-minute episodes for a single season in 1985, to two feature-length productions (1983's <em><a href="The_Five_Doctors" title="wikilink">The Five Doctors</a></em> and the <a href="Doctor_Who_(1996)" title="wikilink">1996 television movie</a>).</p>
<p>The serial format changed for the 2005 revival. <a href="List_of_Doctor_Who_serials#Series_1_(2005)" title="wikilink">Series 1</a> consisted of thirteen 45-minute, self-contained episodes (60 minutes with commercials in Canada/USA), with three two-parters and a loose story arc whose elements were brought together in the season final&lt;U+00E9&gt;. The second series follows a similar pattern, preceded by a 60-minute Christmas special in 2005 with another planned for 2006. It is expected that <em>Doctor Who</em> will surpass the number of individual instalments of the <em><a href="Star_Trek" title="wikilink">Star Trek</a></em> franchise (around 726 episodes) during the third season of the new series.</p>
<p>The first two seasons of the 2005 <em>Doctor Who</em> revival were filmed in 625-line PAL <a href="Betacam#Digital_Beta" title="wikilink">DigiBeta</a> widescreen format. Sony had offered the use of a HD camera as part of a sponsorship deal <a href="http://filmforce.ign.com/articles/595/595354p1.html">1</a>, but the offer came too late to be considered for the new series (and the BBC is not currently capable of broadcasting in high-definition). The series will be upconverted for broadcast in high-definition. The BBC has reportedly been conducting HD tests, and the third season of the new <em>Doctor Who</em> and the first season of the <em>Torchwood</em> spinoff will reportedly be filmed in HD <a href="http://torchwoodtv.blogspot.com/2006/05/torchwoodhigh-definition-television.html">2</a>.</p>
<h2 id="the-doctor">The Doctor</h2>

<p><img src="10dr19.jpg" title="fig:The ten faces of the Doctor. Clockwise from top-left: William Hartnell, Patrick Troughton, Jon Pertwee, Tom Baker, Peter Davison, Colin Baker, Sylvester McCoy, Paul McGann, Christopher Eccleston and David Tennant." alt="The ten faces of the Doctor. Clockwise from top-left: William Hartnell, Patrick Troughton, Jon Pertwee, Tom Baker, Peter Davison, Colin Baker, Sylvester McCoy, Paul McGann, Christopher Eccleston and David Tennant." width="300" /> The character of the Doctor was initially shrouded in mystery. All that was known about him in the programme's early days was that he was an eccentric alien traveller of great intelligence who battled injustice while exploring Time and Space in an unreliable old time machine called the <a href="TARDIS" class="uri" title="wikilink">TARDIS</a>. (The TARDIS is much larger on the inside than on the outside, and is stuck in the shape of a 1950s-style British <a href="police_box" title="wikilink">police box</a>.)</p>
<p>The initially irascible and slightly sinister Doctor quickly mellowed into a more compassionate figure and it was eventually revealed that he had been &quot;on the run&quot; from his own people, the <a href="Time_Lord" title="wikilink">Time Lords</a> of the planet <a href="Gallifrey" class="uri" title="wikilink">Gallifrey</a>. Also, like all Time Lords, the Doctor had the ability to &quot;<a href="Doctor_(Doctor_Who)#Changing_faces" title="wikilink">regenerate</a>&quot; his body when near death. This concept allows for the convenient re-casting of the lead actor. Ten actors have played the part for television.</p>
<p>A Time Lord can regenerate twelve times and the Doctor has gone through this process (and its resulting after-effects) on nine occasions, with each of his incarnations having his own quirks and abilities:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="First_Doctor" title="wikilink">First Doctor</a>, played by <a href="William_Hartnell" title="wikilink">William Hartnell</a> (1963â€“1966)</li>

<li><a href="Tenth_Doctor" title="wikilink">Tenth Doctor</a>, played by <a href="David_Tennant" title="wikilink">David Tennant</a> (2005â€“present)</li>
</ol>
<p>Other actors have also played the Doctor, though rarely more than once (see the <a href="list_of_actors_who_have_played_the_Doctor" title="wikilink">list of actors who have played the Doctor</a> for details).</p>
<p>Despite these shifts in personality, the Doctor has always remained an intensely curious and highly moral adventurer, who would rather solve problems with his wits than through violence.</p>
<p>Throughout the programme's long history certain controversial revelations about the Doctor have been made. For example, in <em><a href="The_Brain_of_Morbius" title="wikilink">The Brain of Morbius</a></em>, it was hinted that the <a href="First_Doctor" title="wikilink">First Doctor</a> may not have been the Doctor's first incarnation; throughout the <a href="Seventh_Doctor" title="wikilink">Seventh Doctor</a>'s era it was hinted that the Doctor was more than just an ordinary Time Lord and in the 1996 television movie it was revealed that the Doctor is actually half-human on his mother's side. By the time of the 2005 series the Doctor, in his <a href="Ninth_Doctor" title="wikilink">ninth incarnation</a>, had become the last known surviving Time Lord.</p>
<h2 id="companions">Companions</h2>
<p><img src="Rosetyler.jpg" title="fig:Billie Piper as current companion Rose Tyler." alt="Billie Piper as current companion Rose Tyler." width="180" />The Doctor almost always shares his adventures with up to three <a href=":Category:Doctor_Who_companions" title="wikilink">companions</a> (the only exception being the serial <em><a href="The_Deadly_Assassin" title="wikilink">The Deadly Assassin</a></em>, in which he travels alone). The idea of the companion is to provide a <a href="audience_surrogate" title="wikilink">surrogate</a> with whom the audience can identify and to further the story by asking questions and getting into trouble. The Doctor regularly gains new companions and loses old ones; sometimes they return home or find new causes â€” or loves â€” on worlds they have visited. Some have even died during the course of the series.</p>
<p>There are some disputes as to the definition of a companion, but fans mostly agree that at least thirty (including <a href="K-9_(Doctor_Who)" title="wikilink">K-9</a> Marks I and II) meet the criteria for &quot;companion&quot; status in the television series, with <a href="list_of_Doctor_Who_spin-off_companions" title="wikilink">others being established in the various spin-offs</a>. For further details, see the notes in <a href="List_of_Doctor_Who_supporting_characters" title="wikilink">List of Doctor Who supporting characters</a>.</p>
<p>&quot;Companion&quot; is more generally used as a technical term in fandom; the press normally refers to them either as companions or assistants. The series does not apply the term consistently to those travelling with the Doctor, with him just as often introducing them simply as his friends.</p>
<p>Despite the fact that the majority of the Doctor's companions are young, attractive females, the production team for the 1963&lt;U+2013&gt;1989 series maintained a longstanding taboo against any overt romantic involvement in the TARDIS. However, that has not prevented fans from speculating about possible romantic involvements, most notably between the <a href="Fourth_Doctor" title="wikilink">Fourth Doctor</a> and the Time Lady <a href="Romana" class="uri" title="wikilink">Romana</a> (whose actors, <a href="Tom_Baker" title="wikilink">Tom Baker</a> and <a href="Lalla_Ward" title="wikilink">Lalla Ward</a>, shared a romance and brief marriage). The taboo was controversially broken in the 1996 television movie when the <a href="Eighth_Doctor" title="wikilink">Eighth Doctor</a> was shown kissing companion <a href="Grace_Holloway" title="wikilink">Grace Holloway</a>. The 2005 series played with this idea by having various characters think that the <a href="Ninth_Doctor" title="wikilink">Ninth Doctor</a> and <a href="Rose_Tyler" title="wikilink">Rose Tyler</a> were a couple, which they vehemently denied (see also <a href="Doctor_(Doctor_Who)#The_Doctor_and_romance" title="wikilink">&quot;The Doctor and romance&quot;</a>).</p>
<p>Previous companions have reappeared in the series, usually for anniversary specials. One former companion, <a href="Sarah_Jane_Smith" title="wikilink">Sarah Jane Smith</a> (played by <a href="Elisabeth_Sladen" title="wikilink">Elisabeth Sladen</a>), together with the robotic dog <a href="K-9_(Doctor_Who)" title="wikilink">K-9</a>, appeared in <a href="School_Reunion_(Doctor_Who)" title="wikilink">an episode</a> of the 2006 series more than twenty years after their last appearances in the 20th Anniversary story <em><a href="The_Five_Doctors" title="wikilink">The Five Doctors</a></em> (1983).</p>

<p><img src="Daleknew.jpg" title="fig:The Daleks are perhaps the best-known adversaries faced by the Doctor." alt="The Daleks are perhaps the best-known adversaries faced by the Doctor." width="180" /> When Sydney Newman commissioned the series, he specifically did not want to perpetuate the clich&lt;U+00E9&gt; of the &quot;bug-eyed monster&quot; of science fiction. However, <a href="list_of_Doctor_Who_monsters_and_aliens" title="wikilink">monsters</a> were a staple of <em>Doctor Who</em> almost from the beginning and were popular with audiences.</p>
<p>Notable adversaries of the Doctor include the <a href="Auton" title="wikilink">Autons</a>, the <a href="Cyberman" title="wikilink">Cybermen</a>, the <a href="Sontaran" title="wikilink">Sontarans</a>, the <a href="Sea_Devil" title="wikilink">Sea Devils</a>, the <a href="Ice_Warrior" title="wikilink">Ice Warriors</a>, the <a href="Yeti_(Doctor_Who)" title="wikilink">Yeti</a>, the <a href="Silurian_(Doctor_Who)" title="wikilink">Silurians</a>, the <a href="Slitheen" class="uri" title="wikilink">Slitheen</a> and <a href="Master_(Doctor_Who)" title="wikilink">the Master</a>, a rival Time Lord with a thirst for universal conquest. Of all the monsters and villains, the ones that arguably most secured the series' place in the public's imagination were the <a href="Dalek" title="wikilink">Daleks</a>. The Daleks are lethal mutants in tank-like mechanical armour from the planet <a href="Skaro" class="uri" title="wikilink">Skaro</a>. Their chief role in the great scheme of things, as they frequently remark in their instantly recognisable metallic voices, is to &quot;Exterminate!&quot; <a href="Davros" class="uri" title="wikilink">Davros</a>, the Daleks' fictional creator, also became a recurring villain after he was introduced.</p>
<p>The Daleks were created by writer <a href="Terry_Nation" title="wikilink">Terry Nation</a> (who intended them as an allegory of the <a href="Nazism" title="wikilink">Nazis</a>) and BBC designer <a href="Raymond_Cusick" title="wikilink">Raymond Cusick</a>.

The Daleks' debut in the programme's second serial, <em><a href="The_Daleks" title="wikilink">The Daleks</a></em>, caused a tremendous reaction in the viewing figures and the public, putting <em>Doctor Who</em> on the cultural map.

<h2 id="music">Music</h2>




<p>The original 1963 arrangement of the <em>Doctor Who</em> theme, as composed by Ron Grainer and realised by <a href="Delia_Derbyshire" title="wikilink">Delia Derbyshire</a> at the <a href="BBC_Radiophonic_Workshop" title="wikilink">BBC Radiophonic Workshop</a>, is widely regarded as a significant and innovative piece of electronic music, working from tape loops of an individually struck piano string and individual test <a href="oscillator" title="wikilink">oscillators</a> and filters. The Derbyshire arrangement served, with minor edits, as the theme tune up to the end of <a href="List_of_Doctor_Who_serials#Season_17_(1979-80)" title="wikilink">Season 17</a>.</p>
<p>A more modern and dynamic arrangement was composed by <a href="Peter_Howell" title="wikilink">Peter Howell</a> for <a href="List_of_Doctor_Who_serials#Season_18_(1980-81)" title="wikilink">Season 18</a> (1980), which was in turn replaced by <a href="Dominic_Glynn" title="wikilink">Dominic Glynn</a>'s less well received arrangement for Season 23's <em><a href="The_Trial_of_a_Time_Lord" title="wikilink">The Trial of a Time Lord</a></em> (1986). <a href="Keff_McCulloch" title="wikilink">Keff McCulloch</a> provided the new arrangement for the <a href="Seventh_Doctor" title="wikilink">Seventh Doctor</a>'s era which lasted from <a href="List_of_Doctor_Who_serials#Season_24_(1987)" title="wikilink">Season 24</a> (1987) until the series' suspension in 1989. For the new series in 2005, <a href="Murray_Gold" title="wikilink">Murray Gold</a> provided a new arrangement which featured samples from the 1963 original with further elements added.</p>
<p>In the early 1970s, <a href="Jon_Pertwee" title="wikilink">Jon Pertwee</a>, who had played the <a href="Third_Doctor" title="wikilink">Third Doctor</a>, recorded a version of the <em>Doctor Who Theme</em> with spoken lyrics, titled, &quot;Who Is The Doctor&quot;. In 1988 the band <a href="The_Justified_Ancients_of_Mu_Mu" title="wikilink">The Justified Ancients of Mu Mu</a> (later known as <a href="The_KLF" title="wikilink">The KLF</a>) released the single &quot;<a href="Doctorin&#39;_the_Tardis" title="wikilink">Doctorin' the Tardis</a>&quot; under the name <a href="The_Timelords" title="wikilink">The Timelords</a>, which reached No. 1 in the UK.

The theme tune has also appeared on many compilation CDs and has made its way into <a href="mobile_phone" title="wikilink">mobile phone</a> ring tones. Fans have also produced and distributed their own remixes of the theme.</p>
<h2 id="viewership">Viewership</h2>
<p><img src="3doctardis.jpg" title="fig:The image of the TARDIS is iconic in British popular culture." alt="The image of the TARDIS is iconic in British popular culture." width="180" /> <em>Doctor Who</em> has always appeared on the BBC's mainstream <a href="BBC_One" title="wikilink">BBC One</a> channel, drawing audiences of many millions of viewers. It was most popular in the late 1970s, with audiences frequently as high as 12 million. During the <a href="ITV" class="uri" title="wikilink">ITV</a> network strike of 1979, viewership peaked at 16 million. No first-run episode of <em>Doctor Who</em> has ever drawn fewer than three million viewers on BBC One, although its late 1980s performance of three to five million viewers was seen as poor at the time, and was according to the BBC Board of Control, a leading cause of the programme's 1989 suspension. Some fans considered this disingenuous, since the programme was scheduled against the <a href="soap_opera" title="wikilink">soap opera</a> <em><a href="Coronation_Street" title="wikilink">Coronation Street</a></em>, the most popular show at the time. The BBC One broadcast of <em><a href="Rose_(Doctor_Who)" title="wikilink">Rose</a></em>, the first episode of the 2005 revival, drew an average audience of 10.81 million, No. 3 for BBC One that week and No. 7 across all channels. The latest series has an audience of about 7.5 million, although the figures have not yet exceeded that of <em>Rose</em>. The episode <em><a href="Rise_of_the_Cybermen" title="wikilink">Rise of the Cybermen</a></em>, however, managed No. 6 in the charts across the week with 9.22 million viewers. The all-time highest chart placing for an episode of <em>Doctor Who</em> is No. 5 for episode two of <em><a href="The_Ark_in_Space" title="wikilink">The Ark in Space</a></em> in 1975.</p>
<p>The programme also gained a strong following in <a href="Australia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Australia</a>, where, until recently, it continued to be screened as a result of the close connection between the BBC and Australia's major public broadcaster, the <a href="Australian_Broadcasting_Corporation" title="wikilink">ABC</a>. The latest repeat of the classic series in Australia ran from September 2003 to February 2006, and the new 2006 series will be shown in early July. The series also has a fan base in the <a href="United_States" title="wikilink">United States</a>, where it was shown in syndication through the 1970s and 1980s, particularly on <a href="PBS" class="uri" title="wikilink">PBS</a> stations (see <a href="Doctor_Who_in_America" title="wikilink">Doctor Who in America</a>). <a href="New_Zealand" title="wikilink">New Zealand</a> was the first country outside the UK to screen <em>Doctor Who</em> beginning in September 1964, and continued to screen the series for many years, including the new series from 2005. In <a href="Canada" class="uri" title="wikilink">Canada</a>, the series debuted in January 1965, but the CBC only aired the first twenty-six episodes. <a href="TVOntario" class="uri" title="wikilink">TVOntario</a> picked-up the show in the 1976, and aired it through Season 24 in 1991.</p>
<p>Only four episodes have ever had their premiere showings on channels other than BBC One. The 1983 twentieth anniversary special <em><a href="The_Five_Doctors" title="wikilink">The Five Doctors</a></em> had its debut on <a href="November_23" title="wikilink">November 23</a> (the actual date of the anniversary) on the <a href="Chicago,_Illinois" title="wikilink">Chicago</a> <a href="PBS" class="uri" title="wikilink">PBS</a> station <a href="WTTW-TV" title="wikilink">WTTW</a> in the United States and various other PBS members two days prior to its BBC One broadcast. The 1988 story <em><a href="Silver_Nemesis" title="wikilink">Silver Nemesis</a></em> was broadcast with all three episodes edited together in compilation form on <a href="TVNZ" class="uri" title="wikilink">TVNZ</a> in New Zealand in November, after the first episode had been shown in the UK but before the final two instalments had aired there. Finally, the 1996 television movie premiered on <a href="May_12" title="wikilink">May 12</a> on <a href="CITV-TV" title="wikilink">CITV</a> in <a href="Edmonton,_Alberta" title="wikilink">Edmonton</a>, Canada, fifteen days before the BBC One showing, and two days before it aired on <a href="Fox_Broadcasting_Company" title="wikilink">Fox</a> in the USA.</p>
<p>A wide selection of serials is available from BBC Video on <a href="VHS" class="uri" title="wikilink">VHS</a> and <a href="DVD" class="uri" title="wikilink">DVD</a>, on sale in the United Kingdom, Australia, and the United States. Every fully extant serial has been released on VHS, and BBC Worldwide continues to regularly release serials on DVD. One disc of episodes from the 2005 series is available on <a href="Universal_Media_Disc" title="wikilink">UMD</a>, with more releases planned.</p>
<p>As of March 2006, the new series has been, or is currently, broadcast weekly in <a href="Australia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Australia</a> (<a href="Australian_Broadcasting_Corporation" title="wikilink">ABC</a>), <a href="Belgium" class="uri" title="wikilink">Belgium</a> (<a href="&lt;U+00C9&gt;&lt;U+00E9&gt;n_TV_Station" title="wikilink">&lt;U+00E9&gt;&lt;U+00E9&gt;n</a>), <a href="Canada" class="uri" title="wikilink">Canada</a> (in English on CBC and in French on <a href="Zt&lt;U+00E9&gt;l&lt;U+00E9&gt;" class="uri" title="wikilink">Zt&lt;U+00E9&gt;l&lt;U+00E9&gt;</a>), <a href="France" class="uri" title="wikilink">France</a> (<a href="France_4" title="wikilink">France 4</a>), <a href="Hong_Kong" title="wikilink">Hong Kong</a> (<a href="Asia_Television_Limited" title="wikilink">ATV World</a>), <a href="Hungary" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hungary</a> (<a href="RTL_Klub" title="wikilink">RTL Klub</a>-owned COOL TV), <a href="Israel" class="uri" title="wikilink">Israel</a> (<a href="Yes_Weekend" title="wikilink">Yes Weekend</a>), <a href="Italy" class="uri" title="wikilink">Italy</a> (<a href="Jimmy_(Italian_television_channel)" title="wikilink">Jimmy</a>), <a href="New_Zealand" title="wikilink">New Zealand</a> (<a href="Prime_Television_New_Zealand" title="wikilink">Prime TV</a>), <a href="Norway" class="uri" title="wikilink">Norway</a> (<a href="Norsk_Rikskringkasting" title="wikilink">NRK</a>), <a href="Russia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Russia</a> (<a href="STS_TV" title="wikilink">STS TV</a>), <a href="Spain" class="uri" title="wikilink">Spain</a> (<a href="People+Arts" class="uri" title="wikilink">People+Arts</a>), <a href="South_Korea" title="wikilink">South Korea</a> (<a href="KBS" class="uri" title="wikilink">KBS</a> - notable as the first time a British drama series has been sold to a Korean public station), the <a href="United_States" title="wikilink">United States</a> (<a href="Sci_Fi_Channel_(United_States)" title="wikilink">Sci Fi Channel</a>), and Style UK (a channel of <a href="Showtime_Arabia" title="wikilink">Showtime Arabia</a>) in the <a href="Middle_East" title="wikilink">Middle East</a> and <a href="North_Africa" title="wikilink">North Africa</a>.

<p>The 2006 series has been purchased by the CBC, though no broadcast date has been announced, however CBC staff are indicating that it will air starting in October 2006. The 2005 series episodes aired in Canada a couple of weeks after their UK broadcast, a situation made possible by the <a href="2004-05_NHL_lockout" title="wikilink">cancellation of the 2004-2005 National Hockey League season</a> which left vast gaps in CBC's schedule. For the Canadian broadcasts, Christopher Eccleston recorded special video introductions for each episode (including a trivia question as part of a viewer contest) and excerpts from the <em>Doctor Who Confidential</em> documentary were played over the closing credits; for the broadcast of <em>The Christmas Invasion</em> on December 26, 2005, Billie Piper recorded a special video introduction. The <a href="http://www.dwin.org/">Doctor Who Information Network</a> has indicated that CBC may air the series in Autumn 2006.</p>

<p><img src="10thplanet.jpg" title="fig:The First Doctor (William Hartnell) collapses prior to his regeneration. (From the surviving clip of The Tenth Planet, episode 4.)" alt="The First Doctor (William Hartnell) collapses prior to his regeneration. (From the surviving clip of The Tenth Planet, episode 4.)" width="180" /> Between about 1967 and 1978, large amounts of older material stored in the BBC's video tape and film libraries were destroyed or <a href="Wiping_(magnetic_tape)" title="wikilink">wiped</a>. This included many old episodes of <em>Doctor Who</em>, mostly stories featuring the first two Doctors â€” <a href="William_Hartnell" title="wikilink">William Hartnell</a> and <a href="Patrick_Troughton" title="wikilink">Patrick Troughton</a>. Archives are complete from the programme's move to colour television (starting from <a href="Jon_Pertwee" title="wikilink">Jon Pertwee</a>'s time as the Doctor), although a few Pertwee episodes have required substantial restoration and a handful have only been recovered in black and white. In all, <a href="List_of_incomplete_Doctor_Who_serials" title="wikilink">108</a> of 253 episodes produced during the first six years of the programme are not held in the BBC's archives.</p>
<p>Some episodes have been returned to the BBC from the archives of other countries who bought copies for broadcast, or by private individuals who got them by various means. Early colour videotape recordings made off-air by fans have also been retrieved, as well as excerpts recovered on 8 mm <a href="cine_film" title="wikilink">cine film</a> from clips shown on other programmes. Audio versions of all of the lost episodes exist from home viewers making tape recordings of the show.</p>
<p>In addition to these, there are photographs made by photographer <a href="John_Cura" title="wikilink">John Cura</a>, who was hired by the BBC to document the filming of many of their most popular programmes during the 1950s and 1960s, including <em>Doctor Who</em>. These have been used in fan reconstructions of the serials. These amateur reconstructions have been tolerated by the BBC, provided they are not sold for profit and distributed as low quality VHS copies.</p>
<p>One of the most sought-after lost episodes is Part Four of the last William Hartnell serial, <em><a href="The_Tenth_Planet" title="wikilink">The Tenth Planet</a></em>, which ends with the <a href="First_Doctor" title="wikilink">First Doctor</a> transforming into the <a href="Second_Doctor" title="wikilink">Second</a>. The only portion of this in existence, bar a few poor quality silent 8 mm clips, is the few seconds of the regeneration scene, thanks to it being shown on the children's magazine show <em><a href="Blue_Peter" title="wikilink">Blue Peter</a></em>. With the approval of the BBC, efforts are now under way to restore as many of the episodes as possible from the extant material.</p>
<p>Starting in the early 1990s, the BBC began to release audio recordings of missing serials on cassette and compact disc, with linking narration provided by former series actors. &quot;Official&quot; reconstructions have also been released by the BBC on VHS, on <a href="MP3" class="uri" title="wikilink">MP3</a> <a href="CD-ROM" class="uri" title="wikilink">CD-ROM</a> and as a special feature on a DVD.</p>
<p>In April 2006, the long running BBC children's television magazine <em><a href="Blue_Peter" title="wikilink">Blue Peter</a></em> launched a challenge to find these missing episodes with the promise of a full scale <a href="Dalek" class="uri" title="wikilink">Dalek</a> model.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="adaptations-and-other-appearances">Adaptations and other appearances</h2>
<h3 id="spin-offs">Spin-offs</h3>

<p><em>Doctor Who</em> has appeared on stage numerous times. In the early 1970s, <a href="Trevor_Martin" title="wikilink">Trevor Martin</a> played the role in <em><a href="Doctor_Who_and_the_Daleks_in_the_Seven_Keys_to_Doomsday" title="wikilink">Doctor Who and the Daleks in the Seven Keys to Doomsday</a></em> which also featured former companion actress <a href="Wendy_Padbury" title="wikilink">Wendy Padbury</a> (Pertwee's Doctor made a cameo appearance via film). In the early 1990s, Jon Pertwee and Colin Baker both played the Doctor at different times during the run of a musical play entitled <em><a href="Doctor_Who_-_The_Ultimate_Adventure" title="wikilink">Doctor Who - The Ultimate Adventure</a></em>. For two performances while Pertwee was ill, <a href="David_Banks" title="wikilink">David Banks</a> (best known for playing various <a href="Cyberman" title="wikilink">Cybermen</a>) played the Doctor. Other original plays have been staged as amateur productions, with other actors playing the Doctor, while <a href="Terry_Nation" title="wikilink">Terry Nation</a> wrote <em><a href="The_Curse_of_the_Daleks" title="wikilink">The Curse of the Daleks</a></em>, a stage play mounted in the late 1960s, but without the Doctor.</p>
<p>The Doctor has also appeared in two cinema films: <em><a href="Dr._Who_and_the_Daleks" title="wikilink">Dr. Who and the Daleks</a></em> in 1965 and <em><a href="Daleks_-_Invasion_Earth_2150_AD" title="wikilink">Daleks - Invasion Earth 2150 AD</a></em> in 1966. Both were essentially retellings of existing stories on the big screen, with a larger budget and numerous alterations to the series concept. In these films, <a href="Peter_Cushing" title="wikilink">Peter Cushing</a> played a human scientist named <a href="Cushing_Doctor" title="wikilink">Dr. Who</a>, who travelled with his two granddaughters and other companions in a time machine he invented. Due to this and numerous other changes (not to mention the storylines that duplicated televised episodes), the movies are not regarded as part of the ongoing continuity of the series, although the Cushing version of the character would reappear in both comic strip and literary form, the latter attempting to reconcile the film continuity with that of the series.</p>
<p>A pilot episode for a potential spin-off series, <em><a href="K-9_and_Company" title="wikilink">K-9 and Company</a></em>, was aired in 1981 with <a href="Elisabeth_Sladen" title="wikilink">Elisabeth Sladen</a> reprising her role as companion <a href="Sarah_Jane_Smith" title="wikilink">Sarah Jane Smith</a> and <a href="John_Leeson" title="wikilink">John Leeson</a> as the voice of <a href="K-9_(Doctor_Who)" title="wikilink">K-9</a>, but was not picked up as a regular series.</p>
<p><em>Doctor Who</em> books have been published from the mid-sixties through to the present day. The Doctor has also appeared in many audio plays and in webcasts.</p>
<p>Following the success of the 2005 series, the BBC commissioned Davies to produce a 13-part spin-off series titled <em><a href="Torchwood" class="uri" title="wikilink">Torchwood</a></em> (an <a href="anagram" class="uri" title="wikilink">anagram</a> of &quot;Doctor Who&quot;), set in modern-day Britain and investigating alien activities and crime. The series will star <a href="John_Barrowman" title="wikilink">John Barrowman</a>, playing his <em>Doctor Who</em> character of <a href="Jack_Harkness" title="wikilink">Jack Harkness</a>, and will begin shooting in Summer 2006.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> <a href="Eve_Myles" title="wikilink">Eve Myles</a>, who was a guest star in <em><a href="The_Unquiet_Dead" title="wikilink">The Unquiet Dead</a></em>, will also star.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>

Not taken seriously by many, the story had the <a href="Rani_(Doctor_Who)" title="wikilink">Rani</a> opening a hole in time, cycling the Doctor and his companions through his previous incarnations and menacing them with monsters from the show's past. It also featured a crossover with the soap opera <em><a href="EastEnders" class="uri" title="wikilink">EastEnders</a></em>, the action taking place in the latter's <a href="Albert_Square" title="wikilink">Albert Square</a> location and around <a href="Greenwich" class="uri" title="wikilink">Greenwich</a>, including the <em><a href="Cutty_Sark" title="wikilink">Cutty Sark</a></em>. The special was one of several special 3D programmes the BBC produced at the time, using a 3D system that made use of the <a href="Pulfrich_effect" title="wikilink">Pulfrich effect</a> requiring glasses with one darkened lens; the picture would look perfectly normal to those viewers who watched without the glasses.</p>
<p>In 1999, another special, <em><a href="Doctor_Who_and_the_Curse_of_Fatal_Death" title="wikilink">Doctor Who and the Curse of Fatal Death</a></em>, was made for <a href="Red_Nose_Day" title="wikilink">Red Nose Day</a> and later released on <a href="VHS" class="uri" title="wikilink">VHS</a>. An affectionate <a href="parody" class="uri" title="wikilink">parody</a> of the television series, it was split into four segments, mimicking the traditional serial format, complete with <a href="cliffhanger" title="wikilink">cliffhangers</a>. (The version released on <a href="video" class="uri" title="wikilink">video</a> was split into only two episodes.) In the story, the Doctor (<a href="Rowan_Atkinson" title="wikilink">Rowan Atkinson</a>) encounters both <a href="Master_(Doctor_Who)" title="wikilink">the Master</a> (<a href="Jonathan_Pryce" title="wikilink">Jonathan Pryce</a>) and the <a href="Dalek" title="wikilink">Daleks</a>. During the special the Doctor is forced to regenerate several times, with his subsequent incarnations played by, in order, <a href="Richard_E._Grant" title="wikilink">Richard E. Grant</a>, <a href="Jim_Broadbent" title="wikilink">Jim Broadbent</a>, <a href="Hugh_Grant" title="wikilink">Hugh Grant</a>, and <a href="Joanna_Lumley" title="wikilink">Joanna Lumley</a>. The script was written by comedy writer <a href="Steven_Moffat" title="wikilink">Steven Moffat</a>, who contributed two scripts to the 2005 series and one for the 2006 series.</p>
<p>As noted above, on <a href="November_18" title="wikilink">November 18</a>, <a href="2005" class="uri" title="wikilink">2005</a>, an untitled <a href="Doctor_Who_Children_in_Need_special_(2005)" title="wikilink">7-minute &quot;mini-episode&quot;</a>, set in the immediate aftermath of <em><a href="The_Parting_of_the_Ways" title="wikilink">The Parting of the Ways</a></em> and leading directly into <em><a href="The_Christmas_Invasion" title="wikilink">The Christmas Invasion</a></em>, was shown as part of the Children in Need <a href="telethon" class="uri" title="wikilink">telethon</a>.</p>

<p><em>Doctor Who</em> has been satirised and spoofed on many occasions by comedians including <a href="Spike_Milligan" title="wikilink">Spike Milligan</a> and <a href="Lenny_Henry" title="wikilink">Lenny Henry</a>. <a href="Doctor_Who_fandom" title="wikilink"><em>Doctor Who</em> fandom</a> has also been skewered on programmes such as <em><a href="Saturday_Night_Live" title="wikilink">Saturday Night Live</a></em>.</p>
<p><img src="Simpsons_Doctor_Who.jpg" title="fig:The Fourth Doctor on The Simpsons" alt="The Fourth Doctor on The Simpsons" width="150" /> The Doctor in his fourth incarnation (the one most Americans associate the Doctor with) has been represented on several episodes of <em><a href="The_Simpsons" title="wikilink">The Simpsons</a></em>, starting with the episode &quot;<a href="Sideshow_Bob&#39;s_Last_Gleaming" title="wikilink">Sideshow Bob's Last Gleaming</a>&quot; where (along with <a href="Krusty_the_Clown" title="wikilink">Krusty the Clown</a> and <a href="Steve_Urkel" title="wikilink">Steve Urkel</a>) he was part of a delegation to the Pentagon of &quot;the esteemed representatives of television&quot;.

<p><a href="Jon_Culshaw" title="wikilink">Jon Culshaw</a> frequently impersonates the Fourth Doctor in the BBC <em><a href="Dead_Ringers_(comedy)" title="wikilink">Dead Ringers</a></em> series. Culshaw's &quot;Doctor&quot; has telephoned four of the &quot;real&quot; Doctors &lt;U+2014&gt; Tom Baker, Peter Davison, Colin Baker and Sylvester McCoy &lt;U+2014&gt; in character as the Fourth Doctor. This prompted the bemused (and apparently confused) McCoy to ask the classic question: &quot;Have you been in the pub?&quot;. When Culshaw phoned Tom Baker himself and stated that he &quot;was the Doctor&quot;, Baker replied, &quot;But there must be some mistake...<em>I'm</em> the Doctor...&quot; Baker had previously worked with Culshaw and was aware of his impression but not when the call would come, if at all, so his reaction was genuine. On the other hand, McCoy has said that his reaction was faked, as he had been warned immediately before the call took place. In the 2005 <em>Dead Ringers</em> Christmas special, broadcast shortly before <em><a href="The_Christmas_Invasion" title="wikilink">The Christmas Invasion</a></em>, Culshaw impersonated both the Fourth and Tenth Doctors, while the Second, Seventh and Ninth Doctors were impersonated by <a href="Mark_Perry_(impressionist)" title="wikilink">Mark Perry</a>, <a href="Kevin_Connelly" title="wikilink">Kevin Connelly</a> and <a href="Phil_Cornwell" title="wikilink">Phil Cornwell</a>, respectively.</p>

<p>Although <em>Doctor Who</em> was fondly regarded during its original 1963&lt;U+2013&gt;1989 run, it received little critical recognition at the time. In 1975, <a href="List_of_Doctor_Who_serials#Season_11_(1973&lt;U+2013&gt;74)" title="wikilink">Season 11</a> of the series won a Writers' Guild of Great Britain award for Best Writing in a Children's Serial.
