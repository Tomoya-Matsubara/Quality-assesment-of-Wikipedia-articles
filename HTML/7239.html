When searching for a composer to work on the game's music, they realised that many of the compiled tracks were composed by <a href="Gustavo_Santaolalla" title="wikilink">Gustavo Santaolalla</a>. Straley described Santaolalla's music as &quot;organic instrumentation, minimalist, dissonance and resonance with the sounds&quot;.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> As a result, Sony reached out to Santaolalla, who agreed to work on the game's soundtrack.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> After hearing the game's pitch, Santaolalla was excited to work on the game; he previously wanted to work on video games, but refused to work on those without a focus on story and characters.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>Due to Santaolalla's stance on composing music&lt;U+2014&gt;he lacks knowledge in reading and writing <a href="sheet_music" title="wikilink">sheet music</a>, preferring to simply record&lt;U+2014&gt;he began working on <em>The Last of Us</em> early in development. To give Santaolalla a point to base his music, Druckmann simply told him about the story and themes, as opposed to giving specific instructions on composing; Santaolalla appreciated this freedom, feeling it assisted in the composing. To compose, Santaolalla felt the need to &quot;go into some more dark place, more textural and not necessarily melodic&quot;.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> To challenge himself, Santaolalla used a variety of unique instruments he was unfamiliar with, giving a sense of danger and innocence. For <em>The Last of Us</em>, he used a detuned guitar, producing deep noise. To produce unique tunes, Santaolalla recorded in various rooms, including a bathroom and kitchen.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> The team wanted the game's AI to affect the music. They also tried to make the music evoke a reaction from the player, as their familiarization with the sounds would trigger a previous emotion that they felt. Music manager Jonathan Mayer felt that the game's action music was atypical of action music in other games, stating that it's &quot;relatively low-key&quot;, and that taking it out of context changes the immediate reaction to it.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> The game's theme, &quot;The Last of Us&quot;, was the first piece of music that the team received, and they were very impressed.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> The team aimed for a soundtrack that was &quot;emotional&quot;, as opposed to being scary.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> Inspired by the sparing use of music in the film <em><a href="No_Country_for_Old_Men_(film)" title="wikilink">No Country for Old Men</a></em> (2007), the team used music judiciously and tried to find other ways to &quot;make your palms sweaty&quot;.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> The orchestral portions of the score were recorded at <a href="Ocean_Way_Studios" title="wikilink">Ocean Way Studios</a> in <a href="Nashville" class="uri" title="wikilink">Nashville</a> by the Nashville Scoring Orchestra.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<p>Aside from the official soundtracks, licensed tracks also appear in the game. In the main game, during the section aptly titled &quot;Alone and Forsaken&quot;, Joel and Ellie listen to the songs &quot;<a href="I&#39;ll_Never_Get_Out_Of_This_World_Alive" title="wikilink">I'll Never Get Out Of This World Alive</a>&quot; and &quot;Alone and Forsaken&quot; both by <a href="Hank_Williams" title="wikilink">Hank Williams</a>.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> In <em>Left Behind</em>, Ellie and Riley dance to the <a href="Etta_James" title="wikilink">Etta James</a> cover of the song &quot;<a href="I_Got_You_Babe" title="wikilink">I Got You Babe</a>&quot;. In addition, &quot;<a href="String_Quartet_No._3_(Tchaikovsky)" title="wikilink">String Quartet No. 3 in E-Flat Minor, Op. 30</a>&quot; by <a href="Tchaikovsky" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tchaikovsky</a> and &quot;String Quarter No. 4 in E-Minor (B.19)&quot; by <a href="Antonin_Dvorak" title="wikilink">Antonin Dvorak</a> are also present in <em>Left Behind</em>.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
