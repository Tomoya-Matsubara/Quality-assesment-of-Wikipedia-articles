From her rustic home on <a href="Elba_Island" title="wikilink">Elba Island</a>, a tiny piece of land in the <a href="Savannah_River" title="wikilink">Savannah River</a> near the <a href="Atlantic_Ocean" title="wikilink">Atlantic Ocean</a>, Martus would wave a handkerchief by day and a lantern by night. According to legend, not a ship was missed in her forty-four years on watch. A statue of Martus by the sculptor <a href="Felix_de_Weldon" title="wikilink">Felix de Weldon</a> has been erected in Morrell Park on the historic riverfront of <a href="Savannah,_Georgia" title="wikilink">Savannah</a>.</p>
<p>Many other legends endure about this woman, notably the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>The reason she greeted ships was because she had fallen in love as a young girl with a sailor and wanted to be sure he would find her when he returned.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></li>
<li>Sailors would bring her gifts<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></li>
<li>When the captain of the ship that brought her memorial statue to Savannah arrived, he refused to accept payment because of his fond memories of Martus<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></li>
</ul>
<p>While these old tales may be accurate, there is no strong supporting evidence for any of them.</p>
<p>On September 27, 1943 <a href="Liberty_ship" title="wikilink">Liberty ship</a> SS <em>Florence Martus</em> was named in her honor.</p>
