<p><strong>Andy Donato</strong> (<a href="1937" class="uri" title="wikilink">1937</a> - ) is an <a href="editorial_cartoon" title="wikilink">editorial cartoonist</a> for the <em><a href="Toronto_Sun" title="wikilink">Toronto Sun</a></em> newspaper chain.</p>
<p>He was born in <a href="Scarborough,_Ontario" title="wikilink">Scarborough, Ontario</a>. He graduated from <a href="Danforth_Technical_School" title="wikilink">Danforth Technical School</a> in <a href="1955" class="uri" title="wikilink">1955</a> and worked at <a href="Eaton&#39;s" class="uri" title="wikilink">Eaton's</a> as a layout artist. He joined the <em><a href="Toronto_Telegram" title="wikilink">Toronto Telegram</a></em> in 1961, working as a <a href="graphic_artist" title="wikilink">graphic artist</a> in the promotion department. In 1968, he was appointed art director and began cartooning on a part-time basis. After the demise of the Telegram, he joined The Toronto Sun and in 1974, started cartooning on a full-time basis. In 1985-86 he served as president of the <a href="Association_of_American_Editorial_Cartoonists" title="wikilink">Association of American Editorial Cartoonists</a>.</p>
<p>He is well known among <em>Sun</em> readers for his signature image of a <a href="bird" class="uri" title="wikilink">bird</a>, &quot;Donato's bird.&quot; Finding the bird, lost in the newspaper, has been a common device in <em>Sun</em> promotions over the years.</p>
<p>Some of his most famous work was done when <a href="Pierre_Eliott_Trudeau" title="wikilink">Pierre Eliott Trudeau</a> was Prime Minister, and <a href="Joe_Clark" title="wikilink">Joe Clark</a> was leader of the official opposition. As the two leaders battled it out, Donato lampooned both of them extensively - Joe Clark for years was drawn wearing children's mittens (attached to his suit with string), a reference to the time his luggage went missing on a trip to Israel. The final cartoon of the series came when Trudeau's airplane was hit by a bus, and pictured a puzzled Trudeau staring at the bus while one of his aids held up Clark's mittens and said, &quot;We don't know who the driver was, but we found his mittens.&quot; However, perhaps his most famous cartoon was a blank page entitled &quot;Canada's foreign ownership policy&quot; - parodying Canada's lack of controls over foreign ownership of Canadian companies.</p>
<p>While Donato's work is often praised, he was roundly criticized for a July 2004 cartoon which depicted <a href="Mayor_of_Toronto" title="wikilink">Toronto Mayor</a> <a href="David_Miller_(mayor_of_Toronto)" title="wikilink">David Miller</a> as <a href="Adolf_Hitler" title="wikilink">Adolf Hitler</a>.</p>
<p>Being pilloried by Donato is considered an honor by many Canadian politicians. When he drew a picture of Liberal MP <a href="Carolyn_Parrish" title="wikilink">Carolyn Parrish</a> with both feet stuck in her mouth (<a href="http://www.cbc.ca/stories/2003/02/26/bastards030226">Article on what she said here</a>) Parrish requested the original drawing, which Donato was happy to comply. The first time any a politician is targeted they get the original drawing on request.</p>

<p>&quot;<em>A cartoonist is a like a blind javelin thrower at the Olympics. He's not too accurate, but he sure gets the attention of the spectators.</em>&quot;</p>
