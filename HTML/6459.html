<p><strong>Scottish Ballet</strong> is <a href="Scotland" class="uri" title="wikilink">Scotland</a>'s national <a href="ballet" class="uri" title="wikilink">ballet</a> company, based in <a href="Glasgow" class="uri" title="wikilink">Glasgow</a>.</p>
<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<p>Founded by <a href="Peter_Darrell" title="wikilink">Peter Darrell</a> and <a href="Elizabeth_West" title="wikilink">Elizabeth West</a> as Western Theatre Ballet in Bristol in 1957, the Company moved to Glasgow in 1969 and was renamed Scottish Theatre Ballet, changing to Scottish Ballet in 1974. A year later its home theatre became the Theatre Royal, Glasgow when Scottish Opera bought it and transformed it as the first national opera house in Scotland. The Company performs across Scotland, the UK and abroad, with strong classical technique at the root of all of its work. Its broad repertory includes new version of the classics, seminal pieces from the 20th century modern ballet canon, signature pieces by living choreographers and new commissions. As a truly national company, Scottish Ballet performs at theatres in Aberdeen, Edinburgh, Glasgow and Inverness and in smaller venues throughout Scotland.</p>
<p>The Company&lt;U+2019&gt;s long history of touring internationally includes visits to China, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Portugal, Ireland and the rest of the UK. Scottish Ballet&lt;U+2019&gt;s many recent awards include the 2004 <a href="TMA_Award" title="wikilink">TMA Award</a> for Outstanding Achievement in Dance in recognition of its modernisation programme and dynamic performances. Scottish Ballet&lt;U+2019&gt;s Artistic Director, <a href="Ashley_Page" title="wikilink">Ashley Page</a> was also awarded <a href="OBE" class="uri" title="wikilink">OBE</a> for services to dance in the Queen&lt;U+2019&gt;s Birthday Honours list 2006.</p>
<p>Its education initiatives and classes include work with people of all ages and abilities and its Associate Programme encourages young dancers to train for a career in the industry. As part of this commitment to broadening audiences, Scottish Ballet was the first dance company in the UK to offer live audio-description for the visually impaired; it maintains a programme of regular audio-described performances today.</p>
<h2 id="repertoire">Repertoire</h2>
<p>The Company has a broad repertoire, encompassing classical ballet, contemporary dance and new versions of classic full-length ballets. From the esteemed work of <a href="Kevin_Walls" title="wikilink">Kevin Walls</a> to world premi&lt;U+00E8&gt;res by <a href="Stephen_Petronio" title="wikilink">Stephen Petronio</a>, Scottish Ballet's repertoire covers an impressive range.</p>
<p>2003 saw the Company reborn under the artistic direction of Ashley Page. That year, the Company's Autumn Season was a mixed bill comprising Petronio's arresting <em>Middlesexgorge</em>, <a href="Richard_Alston_(choreographer)" title="wikilink">Richard Alston's</a> <em>Dangerous Liaisons</em>, and <a href="Siobhan_Davies" title="wikilink">Siobhan Davies</a>' <em>White Man Sleeps</em>. In addition to this, three short works by Ashley Page appeared on the bill: <em>Cheating, Lying, Stealing</em>, <em>Walking In The Heat</em> and <em>Acrid Avid Jam</em>, all of which were created during his time at the Royal Ballet. In Christmas 2003, Page unveiled his first new work created on Scottish Ballet: <em>The Nutcracker</em>. A vibrant re-working of the classic festive ballet, it wowed both audiences and critics, provoking such reviews as &quot;To say Scottish Ballet is a phoenix risen from the ashes would be something of an understatement&lt;U+2026&gt; Scottish Ballet was reborn&quot; (The Scotsman) and &quot;This is still such stuff as dreams are made on&quot; (Daily Mail).</p>
<p>Further recognition of Scottish Ballet's talent came when they were granted permission to perform work by esteemed choreographer, balletmaster and co-founder of <a href="New_York_City_Ballet" title="wikilink">New York City Ballet</a>, <a href="George_Balanchine" title="wikilink">George Balanchine</a>. In Spring 2004, the Company performed <em><a href="The_Four_Temperaments_(ballet)" title="wikilink">The Four Temperaments</a></em> to critical acclaim. In Autumn 2004, Ashley Page premi&lt;U+00E8&gt;red his first short work created on the Company: <em>Nightswimming into day</em>, and the year came to an end with a reprise of <em>The Nutcracker</em>.</p>
<p>In 2005, Ashley Page created another short piece on Scottish Ballet, a strikingly modern piece called <em>The Pump Room</em>, set to pulsating music by <a href="Aphex_Twin" title="wikilink">Aphex Twin</a>. This piece was premiered during Spring Season. In August 2005, Scottish Ballet was invited to perform at the prestigious Edinburgh International Festival. The Company presented an all Balanchine programme, featuring <em><a href="Apollo_(ballet)" title="wikilink">Apollo</a></em>, <em><a href="Episodes_(ballet)" title="wikilink">Episodes</a></em> and <em><a href="Rubies_(ballet)" title="wikilink">Rubies</a></em> which exposed the Company to an international audience. The programme was a hit and the Company was invited to perform again in 2006 and 2007.</p>
<p>Christmas 2005 saw the world premi&lt;U+00E8&gt;re of Ashley Page's <em>Cinderella</em>. Peppered with the same dark humour, choreographic invention and post-modern twists as <em>The Nutcracker</em>, it was hugely successful and toured throughout Scotland. It also saw the Company perform at Sadler's Wells in London for the first time in many years in March 2006.</p>
<p>2006 was another great year for the Company. The Spring triple bill, comprising <a href="George_Balanchine" title="wikilink">Balanchine's</a> <em><a href="Episodes_(ballet)" title="wikilink">Episodes</a></em>, <a href="William_Forsythe_(dancer)" title="wikilink">Forsythe's</a> <em><a href="Artifact_Suite" title="wikilink">Artifact Suite</a></em> and a reprise of Middlesexgorge, was well received, and performances at EIF 2006 received rave reviews, with particular acclaim for <a href="Jerome_Robbins" title="wikilink">Jerome Robbins</a>' <em><a href="Afternoon_Of_A_Faun_(Robbins)" title="wikilink">Afternoon Of A Faun</a></em>. Scottish Ballet also embarked on a small scale Autumn Tour which saw the Company perform in small venues across Scotland, from Ullapool and Elgin to Stranraer, Oban and Galashiels. This mixed bill was mostly made up of short works by Ashley Page, and it also featured the choreographic debut of Diana Loosmore, a dancer with the Company. Her playful contemporary duet <em>Sirocco</em> established her as an exciting new choreographic force, and this talent was recognised when she was named joint winner of the 2007 Peter Darrell Choreographic Award.</p>
<h2 id="section">2007</h2>
<p>Spring Season 2007 saw Scottish Ballet perform Balanchine's <em>Agon</em>, Peter Darrell's <em>Othello</em>, Page's <em>Room Of Cooks</em> and Krzysztof Pastr's <em>In Light and Shadow</em>. The performance at Glasgow's Theatre Royal on Friday, 13 April was a special gala night to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the death of Scottish Ballet's founder, Peter Darrell, and this bill on this night featured the work of the 2007 Peter Darrell Choreographic Award winners, Diana Loosmore and Vanessa Haska, a choreographer who has worked with Scottish Dance Theatre. Loosmore unveiled new work <em>Chasing Ghosts</em>, while Scottish Dance Theatre performed Haska's dramatic <em>Sorry For The Missiles!</em>, a commentary on the effects of war.</p>
<p>In August, Scottish ballet returned to the Edinburgh International Festival with a striking new triple bill, featuring the Scottish premiere of Page's Oliver Award-winning <em>Fearful Symmetries</em>, esteemed choreographer Trisha Brown's <em>For M.G.: The Movie</em>, and the world premi&lt;U+00E8&gt;re of Stephen Petronio's <em>Ride The Beast</em>. <em>Ride The Beast</em> marked the first piece made on the Company by an outside choreographer since Page was appointed Artistic Director, and the production featured music by Radiohead and costumes by New York designer Benjamin Cho.</p>
<p>The Winter show was Scottish Ballet's third in a trilogy of fairytale themed productions. 'Sleeping Beauty', conceived by Ashley Page and Antony MacDonald, with music by Tchaikovsky, sought to reinvigorate and reinvent this classic for a contemporary audience. Set in Imperial Russia in the 19th Century, and moving to Modernist 1940s London after Aurora's awakening, the Production was heralded as a great success for the Company. The press celebrated Scottish Ballet's ability to entertain and be accessible to a family audience, as well as the lavish production detail in the costumes and set design, and Page's natural story-telling abilities.</p>
<h2 id="section-1">2008</h2>
<p>The Spring Summer Production of <em>Romeo and Juliet</em>, with music by Prokofiev and choreography by Krzysztof Pastor, took Scottish Ballet on another Scottish tour, playing in Edinburgh, Aberdeen, Inverness and Glasgow. Scottish Ballet once again took their modern and slick style to a classic piece, receiving critical success for their imaginative re-telling and forward-thinking choreography.</p>
<p>The Autumn 2008 Season included three works: Steven Petronio's <em>Ride the Beast</em>, with music by Radiohead, returning for a second run after its success in 2007, Trisha Brown's <em>For MG: The Movie</em>, also performed in 2007, and Ashley Page's <em>Pennies from Heaven</em>. The Contemporary programme, which toured Scotland, as well as being performed at London's Southbank Centre, was a high-energy, modern and thrilling performance, inspired by contemporary music, film techniques and the frivolity of the 1930s.</p>
<p>Scottish Ballet finished off 2008 with another hugely successful run of <em>The Sleeping Beauty</em>, taking the production to Cardiff and Belfast for the first time.</p>
<h2 id="current-production">Current Production</h2>
<p>Scottish Ballet returns to the Edinburgh International Festival with a brand new triple bill featuring the world premiere of Ian Spink's <em>Petrushka</em>, which will be performed with William Forsythe's <em>WorkWithinWork</em> and Frederick Ashton's <em>Scenes De Ballet.</em> Tour Dates:</p>
<p>The Playhouse, Edinburgh 4th September, 7.30pm, and 5th September, 2pm &amp; 7.30pm</p>
<h2 id="future">Future</h2>
<p>As Scottish Ballet prepares to celebrate its 40th Birthday, big changes are happening behind the scenes.</p>
<p>The 2009 programme includes a return to the Edinburgh International Festival with the world premiere of Ian Spink's <em>Petrushka</em>, William Forsythe's <em>WorkWithinWork</em> and Frederick Ashton's <em>Scenes De Ballet</em>. In October, the Company presents its 40th anniversary programme, featuring Balanchine's <em>Rubies</em> from full length Ballet <em>Jewels</em>, Forsythe's <em>WorkWithinWork</em> and Krzysztof Pastor's <em>In Light and Shadow,</em> rounding off the year with Ashley Page's take on <em>The Nutcracker</em>.</p>
<p>Also planned for 2009 is Scottish Ballet's move to new, purpose-built premises in Glasgow's Southside, next to the Tramway Theatre. The new, state of the art building, which will include three studios, a smaller practice studio, an education centre, and health and fitness centre, will give the dancers and the company the best facilities from which to develop and grow in the next stage of Scottish Ballet's existence.</p>
<p>With these new facilities Scottish Ballet will also be able to offer Scotland's first ever Conservatoire-based BA Degree in Modern Ballet, in association with Glasgow's Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama, which is due to start in Autumn 2009. Also run in association with the Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama will be a PGDip in Music (Pianist for Dance).</p>
<p>Scottish Ballet will also, with the help of their new premises, be offering pupils from over 217 primary schools the chance to experience ballet in 2009.</p>
<p>In 2009 Scottish Ballet will continue its Education programme for young ballet dancers with its Associates Programme, as well as offering three levels of classes for adults; beginner's, intermediate and advanced.</p>
