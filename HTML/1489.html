<h2 id="plot-summary">Plot summary</h2>
<p>Set on <a href="Halloween" class="uri" title="wikilink">Halloween</a> (a reference to the 1970s slasher <em><a href="Halloween_(1978_film)" title="wikilink">Halloween</a></em>). The movie starts with a young woman named &quot;Screw Frombehind&quot; making a call to <a href="Moviefone" class="uri" title="wikilink">Moviefone</a>. Another call comes in from a private number, although the caller ID still states that it is from &quot;The Killer.&quot; Screw answers the phone, and the caller says &quot;Hello, Cindy.&quot; However, he has the wrong number and is confused. When Screw asks who the caller is, he says &quot;The Killer.&quot; &quot;The Killer&quot; asks Screw if she likes movies. She replies saying she rented some, giving off the titles of various films which are obviously pornographic. &quot;The Killer&quot; asks if she likes scary movies, then takes offense when Screw asks if he is referring to Spike Lee films. &quot;The Killer&quot; asks Screw to play a game, but Screw blows him off when he asks a math question. &quot;The Killer&quot; is heard falling into water, obviously revealing that he is outside in Screw's pool. Screw hangs up and pulls out a spatula seemingly to defend herself, then starts putting frosting on the big cake that is on the kitchen counter. &quot;The Killer&quot; calls back, making a collect call, asking who buried in Grant's Tomb. &quot;The Killer&quot; pops out of the cake with a knife, wearing a black hooded robe and a hockey mask, and begins chasing Screw around the table repeatedly until the phone rings. The Killer answers it, and then gives it to Screw, who begins gossiping for a bit until &quot;The Killer&quot; becomes impatient. Screw hangs up and &quot;The Killer&quot; chases her outside. Screw is killed when she accidentally runs into a bug zapper.</p>
<p>&quot;The Killer&quot;, frustrated that he didn't kill Screw, takes out a cigarette to smoke. It causes his mask to burst into flames, and he puts it out by putting his face into a birdbath. The fire has caused &quot;The Killer's&quot; hockey mask to melt into the image of the killer from <a href="Scream_(film)" title="wikilink">Scream</a>.</p>
<p>The next day, new kid Dawson Deery is enrolling in Bulimia Falls High School, and is immediately bullied by Slab O'Beef (played by <a href="Simon_Rex" title="wikilink">Simon Rex</a>). The secretary introduces Dawson to &quot;The Administrator Formerly Known as the Principal&quot; (played by Coolio), who asks Bonner a.k.a. Boner, to show Dawson around the school. Barbara and Martina also come in and introduce themselves to Dawson. There is an awkward sexual attraction between Martina and Dawson.</p>
<p>Martina and the others are discussing Screw's murder. Meanwhile, &quot;The Killer&quot; attempts to strangle a student with dental floss. The student runs away, and &quot;The Killer&quot;, seemingly oblivious to the other students, pulls a knife out of a locker and walks away. The school is safe despite a violent child named &quot;Chucky&quot; (played by Steven Anthony Lawrence), terrorists, and a heavily armed, but clumsy Special Forces unit.</p>
<p>The gang believes that a serial killer is behind Screw's death, because she was &quot;white and popular&quot; like Barbara. They spot a news van outside where they meet Hagitha Utslay (played by <a href="Tiffany_Amber_Thiessen" title="wikilink">Tiffany Amber Thiessen</a>, who immediately fingers Dawson as the killer, going so far as having written a &quot;best selling pop-up book&quot; titled &quot;Dawson is a Murderer&quot;. Dawson, in full boxing gear, knocks Hagitha out with a right hook, to the delight of the gang, and the dismay of Barbara's step-brother, mall security guard Doughy Primesuspekt (played by <a href="Tom_Arnold_(actor)" title="wikilink">Tom Arnold</a>), who is investigating the murder due to the fact that the killer's costume was stolen from the mall. Doughy and Hagitha talk for a while, even revealing that they both wear the same black and white boots that worn by &quot;The Killer&quot;. Later, The bell rings for class and the janitor is seen sweeping dead bodies, presumably students who have been trampled by other students, while the hallway clears out.</p>
<p>Martina is in her class, taught by a substitute teacher, &quot;<a href="Teaching_Mrs._Tingle" title="wikilink">Mrs. Tingle</a>&quot;. As Mrs. Tingle discusses &quot;<a href="Holocaust" title="wikilink">the persecution of the Jewish people</a>&quot;, the entire class seemingly train sniper rifles on the back of her head. As Martina is cleaning her baseball glove she finds a note from &quot;The Killer&quot; (on The Killer's personal stationery) saying &quot;I no what you did last summer.&quot; After proofreading the note, she has a flashback where her mom reminds her to give her grandmother her laxatives. Martina goes out without doing so, going joyriding with Barbara, Boner, and Slab, who is drinking from a beer bong. They avoid running over a bag lady but hit a deer. The gang disposes of the deer's body at the docks, but Martina spots a sign saying &quot;No Dumping&quot; and remembers that she forgot to give the laxatives to her grandmother. The gang agrees that &quot;This never happened.&quot; After the end of the flashback &quot;The Killer&quot; in full view of the students, attempts to hang Mrs. Tingle.</p>
<p>Boner is thrown into the pool by the swimcoach to demonstrate CPR (performed by two sexy lifeguards) and is being recussitated. Before he gets an <a href="erection" class="uri" title="wikilink">erection</a> hence his name, a girl is kidnapped from the back of the class. When he awakes, Boner has a similar flashback after the Killer leaves a note in Boner's speedo after passing out in swimming class saying &quot;I Know What you did last semester.&quot; In his flashback, Boner's older brother Jimmy, who is on death row, gives Boner a letter to mail in the governor or else he'll be put to death by electric chair in two weeks. Two weeks later, Boner, Martina, Slab, and Barbara go joyriding again. In Boner's flashback, Barbara and Martina are enamoured with Boner. They hit a deer, just like in Martina's flashback, and dispose of it at the docks. Boner spots a mailbox, and remembers that he never mailed Jimmy's letter, because he was using it as a <a href="Bookmark_(books)" title="wikilink">bookmark</a> for a <a href="Penthouse_(magazine)" title="wikilink">Penthouse</a> magazine. They all agree that &quot;this never happened&quot;.</p>
<p>In the hall, everything is normal until the killer kidnaps another girl and drags her into a locker. Slab finds a letter in his locker, and finds a letter saying &quot;I know what you did last Chanakuh&quot;, a word which Slab cannot pronounce. In Slab's flashback, the gang is joyriding, and Slab is driving drunk. However, he is a British intellectual drinking a highball. They hit the deer, like in the past flashbacks. As they are disposing of the deer at the docks, Slab spots a sign saying &quot;No Smoking&quot; and remembers that he smoked his uncle's ashes. They then agree that &quot;this never happened&quot;.</p>
<p>Barbara goes to see <a href="Jack_Kevorkian" title="wikilink">Nurse Kevorkian</a>, the school nurse/funeral director, who tells Barbara that she has <a href="chlamydia" class="uri" title="wikilink">chlamydia</a>, <a href="gonorrhea" class="uri" title="wikilink">gonorrhea</a>, <a href="syphilis" class="uri" title="wikilink">syphilis</a>, crabs, and <a href="herpes" class="uri" title="wikilink">herpes</a>. She shows off an x-ray which reveals a note which Barbara had in her pocket, saying &quot;I know what you did last period&quot;. Barbara has a flashback, in which she tears the tag off of a mattress while having sex. She later goes joyriding, like in the other flashbacks. In Barbara's flashback, the gang sucks up to her. They hit the deer, and dispose of it at the docks, where Barbara reads the tag which says &quot;Under penalty of law, this tag not be removed&quot;. Barbara and the others then agree that &quot;this never happened&quot;</p>
<p>The gang eats lunch later, and they suspect Dawson to be the killer, as he's the only one who didn't get a note. Then he finds an envelope from &quot;The Killer&quot; in his burger. Dawson has a vision where a man in a cabin has forced him to put on a deer suit and eat <a href="salt_lick" title="wikilink">salt lick</a>. The man passes out from being drunk, and Dawson escapes. The cabin explodes when the unconscious man farts toward the fireplace. Dawson is then run down by Slab, Barbara, Boner, and Martina, who take him to the docks and throw him in the water, agreeing that &quot;this never happened&quot;</p>
<p>The gang agrees that the only way to escape the killer is to hide someplace safe, &quot;in the middle of nowhere&quot;, &quot;in the dark woods and pouring rain&quot;, and &quot;without any adult supervision or police protection anywhere in the the near vicinity.&quot; They agree to hide out at Slab's house. They all leave the lunch table with signs on their back.</p>
<p>The hallway clears and all of the students go to class except Barbara, who goes to the restroom, where she is attacked by the killer. A hilarious Mentos parody ensues and Barbara escapes.</p>
<p>In auto shop class, Slab is ridiculed by the other students for doing the &quot;Greased Lightning&quot; dance, and is also attacked by &quot;The Killer&quot; who almost runs him down, except that for some reason, the footage of the killer driving is stuck in a loop. &quot;The Killer&quot; is then pulled over by a cop. Slab walks away in shame, having pissed his pants.</p>
<p>Martina is running track, and &quot;The Killer&quot; begins chasing her. Eventually &quot;The Killer&quot; is racing with Martina. &quot;The Killer&quot; wins the race and celebrates his victory. He doesn't notice that Martina has gotten away until the crowd has lifted him above their shoulders in celebration.</p>
<p>Boner is attempting to peek at girls in the shower, but instead gets a glimpse of &quot;The Killer&quot; who attempts to stab him through the peephole that Boner has drilled.</p>
<p>Dawson has managed to enroll in sex ed. As he is preparing the projector so the class can watch the <a href="celebrity_sex_tape" title="wikilink">Pamela Anderson/Tommy Lee sex tape</a>, he is attacked by &quot;The Killer&quot;. Dawson grabs a rock to defend himself. &quot;The Killer&quot;, playing <a href="rock_paper_scissors" title="wikilink">rock paper scissors</a>, grabs a piece of paper, which Dawson cuts with a pair of scissors. &quot;The Killer&quot; smashes an emergency box to grab a bottle of Jack Daniels. Dawson then grabs a gun which he also smashes. The Killer manages to ground and pound Dawson, until he slips away.</p>
<p>The Killer's costume is laid out in a room, and The Administrator Formerly Known as the Principal is apparently playing sex games with Resusci-Annie, a CPR dummy. They lay in a jacuzzi and begin spying on the students. Unruly students begin throwing objects through the window. &quot;The Killer&quot; shows up and prepares to fight The Administrator Formerly Known as the Principal with a pair of <a href="Sock&#39;em_Boppers" title="wikilink">Sock'em Boppers</a>, but the AFKATP gets hit by a frying pan and falls into the jacuzzi and gets electrocuted to death.</p>
<p>That night, the students of Bulimia Falls have a party at Slab's house, while Doughy, Hagitha, and her cameraman have a stakeout, which involves looking at the stars, playing the drums, and playing strip poker. After Martina explains the rules of a parody, after which Boner seemingly dies. Barbara goes into the garage, and a hilarious parody of the garage scene in Scream ensues. Barbara attempts to escape through the garage door, but gets stuck. After pressing buttons that ring the doorbell, and activate a disco ball, &quot;The Killer&quot; manages to raise the garage door, which goes back down and up repeatedly. Barbara manages to escape by removing her breast implants but is killed after being stung by bees.</p>
<p>The other kids decide to leave the party after hearing that The AFKATP was killed and try to get to the corpse before the coroner so they can play <a href="Weekend_at_Bernie&#39;s" title="wikilink">Weekend at Bernie's</a> with it. Slab also leaves the room, and Martina begins to seduce Dawson, even using Nurse Kevorkian's &quot;safe sex kit&quot;. They then discover Slab in the bathroom, injecting steroids, and then his head explodes. &quot;The Killer&quot; then comes after them and a <a href="Pop-Up_Video" title="wikilink">Pop-Up Video</a>/Scooby-Doo style chase scene ensues.</p>
<p>Martina and Dawson run back into the house, where &quot;The Killer&quot; catches up to them. Dawson attempt to fight &quot;The Killer&quot;, but is ridiculously outmatched. Martina however easily dispatches &quot;The Killer&quot; while Dawson cheers her on. They begin unmasking &quot;The Killer&quot; going through multiple masks. Doughy and Hagitha, hearing the sound effect thay plays as each mask is removed, go to investigate.</p>
<p>Eventually the serial killer is revealed to be the evil twin cousin of the mall security officer investigating the case and is promptly killed. The film ends with the punkish girl and the new kid getting together, the nerd losing his <a href="virginity" class="uri" title="wikilink">virginity</a> (albeit to a male-female <a href="transsexual" class="uri" title="wikilink">transsexual</a>), and a new serial killer, in the same costume, is targeting high school teenagers.</p>
<p>The film seems to promises a sequel, but none is planned.</p>
