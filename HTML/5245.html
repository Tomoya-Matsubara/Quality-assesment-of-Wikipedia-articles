<p><strong>Kamianets-Podilskyi Castle</strong> (; ; ; ) is a former <a href="Ruthenia" title="wikilink">Ruthenian</a>-<a href="Lithuania" title="wikilink">Lithuanian</a><a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> castle located in the historic city of <a href="Kamianets-Podilskyi" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kamianets-Podilskyi</a>, <a href="Khmelnytskyi_Oblast" title="wikilink">Khmelnytskyi Oblast</a> (<a href="oblast" title="wikilink">province</a>), in the historic region of <a href="Podolia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Podolia</a> in western <a href="Ukraine" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ukraine</a>.

<p>The castle was built on top of a peninsula carved out by the winding <a href="Smotrych_River" title="wikilink">Smotrych River</a>, forming a natural defense system for the castle and Kamianets-Podilskyi's Old Town neighborhood; a bridge over the river forms the only entrance to the castle. The castle's name is attributed to the root <em>kamin</em>', from the <a href="Slavic_languages" title="wikilink">Slavic</a> word for stone. Today, along with the Old Town, the castle is listed as part of the National Historical-Architectural Sanctuary &quot;Kam'ianets,&quot; created to protect its architecture and cultural heritage. It is also a candidate <a href="UNESCO_World_Heritage_Site" title="wikilink">UNESCO World Heritage Site</a>, nominated in 1989 by the Ukrainian representatives.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>

<p>During the mid-14th to mid 15th centuries, the Kamianets-Podilskyi Castle was located on one of the main frontiers of the <a href="Polish-Lithuanian_Commonwealth" title="wikilink">Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth</a>. From 1434 until its annexation by the <a href="Russian_Empire" title="wikilink">Russian Empire</a> in 1793, the castle played a major role in the defense against the oncoming <a href="Cossacks" title="wikilink">Cossack</a>, <a href="Ottoman_Empire" title="wikilink">Ottoman</a> and Tatar invasions; through the 15th-17th centuries, the castle was attacked by Tatar <a href="Orda_(organization)" title="wikilink">hordes</a> a total of 51 times.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> The Tatar invasions of 1448, 1451, 1509 and 1528, as well as the Ottoman siege of 1533, caused damage to both the castle and the city but all of these invasions were successfully repelled.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>

<p>The walls of the northern terrace (about  in length) defend the whole inner courtyard. The courtyard's northwestern walls form the Old Castle, ending between the Day and Rozhanka Towers. They are made up of two parallel walls, which include the Petty Western Tower, the remnants of the Black Tower, and a two-level <a href="casemate" class="uri" title="wikilink">casemate</a>, or fortified gun emplacement. The older of the two walls dates back to the beginning of the 12th century and is built with <a href="crenelation" title="wikilink">crenelations</a>. Another casemate was located at the eastern walls.<a href="#fn73" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref73"><sup>73</sup></a> An entrance to the castle in the eastern walls is known as the New Castle Gate, and there were two more gates, one, in the northern walls, called the Old Castle Gate, and another, the Field Gate, connecting the Water Tower with the rest of the castle.<a href="#fn74" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref74"><sup>74</sup></a> The northern walls are reinforced with the Northern Bastion along their whole length.<a href="#fn75" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref75"><sup>75</sup></a> The bastion was built in 1790, just before the <a href="second_partition_of_Poland" title="wikilink">second partition of Poland</a>.<a href="#fn76" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref76"><sup>76</sup></a> There is also the New Castle that was designed as a <a href="hornwork" class="uri" title="wikilink">hornwork</a> and located west from the main castle complex.<a href="#fn77" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref77"><sup>77</sup></a></p>

Potocki.<a href="#fn80" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref80"><sup>80</sup></a> Next to the Kovpak Tower stood an Eastern Orthodox church where Prince Koriatovych was buried.<a href="#fn81" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref81"><sup>81</sup></a> In the courtyard along the southern walls between Kovpak and Tenchynska Towers were a <a href="granary" class="uri" title="wikilink">granary</a> and <a href="Carriage_house" title="wikilink">cart shed</a>.<a href="#fn82" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref82"><sup>82</sup></a> Across from these, near the northern walls and Lanckoro&lt;U+0144&gt;ska Tower, was the residence of the <a href="starosta" class="uri" title="wikilink">starosta</a>.<a href="#fn83" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref83"><sup>83</sup></a> Next to the Tenchynska Tower stood the &quot;Rurmush&quot; which served as a water storage tank for the castle.<a href="#fn84" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref84"><sup>84</sup></a> At the southern walls closer to the White Tower (between Tenchynska and White Towers) were a kitchen and a bakery.<a href="#fn85" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref85"><sup>85</sup></a> Adjacent to the White Tower at the southern walls between White and Day Towers stood the starosta's headquarters.<a href="#fn86" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref86"><sup>86</sup></a> Located against the western walls were the chelyadna, or serfs' quarters, which housed up to 70 serfs who served the castle.<a href="#fn87" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref87"><sup>87</sup></a> Located outside of the northern walls were the castle <a href="stable" title="wikilink">stables</a>, which could house up to 30 horses.<a href="#fn88" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref88"><sup>88</sup></a> In the 16th century the castle had a garrison of around 300 soldiers, who lived in the town.<a href="#fn89" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref89"><sup>89</sup></a></p>
<p><img src="Kamianets-Podilskyi-2.jpg" title="fig:Closeup of one of the 12 towers" alt="Closeup of one of the 12 towers" width="200" /> The Kamianets-Podilskyi Industrial <a href="Vocational_School#Eastern_Europe" title="wikilink">Vocational School</a> has investigated the castle walls. They discovered an area of <a href="quick_sand" title="wikilink">quick sand</a> at the roadside next to the &quot;Podzamche&quot;, or sub-castle, neighborhood of the city, which in the previous year had partially undermined the castle's supporting walls.<a href="#fn90" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref90"><sup>90</sup></a> The effects of the quick sand had uncovered the fortress's foundation walls, a little over  deep.<a href="#fn91" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref91"><sup>91</sup></a> The foundation walls were built on the limestone that creates a canyon along the river valley.<a href="#fn92" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref92"><sup>92</sup></a> Further excavation work showed that the walls stretched to the west, as well from the Old Castle to the bastions of the new one.<a href="#fn93" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref93"><sup>93</sup></a> The support footings for the old castle bridge were also found in the ditch.<a href="#fn94" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref94"><sup>94</sup></a> From the south in the wall there is a  wide and  tall opening, through which the Vocational School assumed water flowed.<a href="#fn95" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref95"><sup>95</sup></a></p>
<p>The preserved northwestern walls are now  high measured from the outside of the castle and  high from the courtyard. As a result of the numerous reconstructions, the walls' depth changed throughout the centuries, being  deep in the <a href="Middle_Ages" title="wikilink">Medieval</a> period,  during the 14th-15th centuries, and an average of  after the reconstruction of the 16th-17th centuries. Conservation works have recently been conducted on the walls to preserve the old Rus' fragments.<a href="#fn96" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref96"><sup>96</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="castle-bridge">Castle bridge</h3>
<p>As a result of the castle's unique location on a peninsula, the castle bridge () serves as the only transport link to the city's <a href="Old_Town" title="wikilink">Old Town</a> neighborhood. It is considered to represent a considerable feat of <a href="medieval" class="uri" title="wikilink">medieval</a> engineering.<a href="#fn97" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref97"><sup>97</sup></a> The bridge has a length of .<a href="#fn98" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref98"><sup>98</sup></a> At the entrance to the bridge, its width is around , while at the end, it narrows to .<a href="#fn99" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref99"><sup>99</sup></a> The bridge's height is  at the entrance, dropping to  on the far side.<a href="#fn100" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref100"><sup>100</sup></a></p>
<p>At the beginning of the 15th century, a large round gate tower was constructed at the castle end of the bridge; the bridge's height, including the tower, was equivalent to that of eight modern <a href="storey" title="wikilink">stories</a>.<a href="#fn101" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref101"><sup>101</sup></a> During the unsuccessful Polish siege of the city in 1687, the castle bridge was rebuilt and fortified by the Turks, acquiring the name &quot;Turkish bridge&quot; (),<a href="#fn102" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref102"><sup>102</sup></a> which many locals still call it today. The bridge's stone <a href="facade" title="wikilink">fa&lt;U+00E7&gt;ade</a> was in poor repair from 1841 until the end of the 19th century.<a href="#fn103" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref103"><sup>103</sup></a> A subsequent lack of preservation work, together with earthquake damage in 1986, contributed to its poor condition. In 2000, the <a href="World_Monuments_Fund" title="wikilink">World Monuments Fund</a> included the Kamianets-Podilskyi's castle bridge in the <a href="2000_World_Monuments_Watch" title="wikilink">2000 World Monuments Watch</a>.<a href="#fn104" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref104"><sup>104</sup></a></p>

<p>The Kamianets-Podilskyi Castle was the most recognized attraction in the city in 2005.<a href="#fn105" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref105"><sup>105</sup></a> The castle also sees a large number of tourists from across Ukraine and abroad,<a href="#fn106" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref106"><sup>106</sup></a> attracting thousands of tourists annually.<a href="#fn107" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref107"><sup>107</sup></a> The castle's legacy has left behind several local legends. According to one legend, when <a href="Ottoman_Dynasty" title="wikilink">Ottoman Sultan</a> <a href="Osman_II" title="wikilink">Osman II</a> came to Kamianets in 1621 to capture the city, he was allegedly impressed by its strength and fortifications and asked &quot;Who built this great city?&quot; . Someone then replied to him, &quot;God himself.&quot; When Osman could not capture the castle, he then replied &quot;Then let God himself take the city.&quot;<a href="#fn108" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref108"><sup>108</sup></a><a href="#fn109" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref109"><sup>109</sup></a> Another local legend has it that <a href="Sultani" title="wikilink">Turkish gold</a> is buried in the Smotrych River and that a  tunnel leads to the <a href="Khotyn_Fortress" title="wikilink">Khotyn Fortress</a> from the Kamianets-Podilskyi Castle.<a href="#fn110" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref110"><sup>110</sup></a></p>
