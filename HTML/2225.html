<p><strong><em>Quatermass and the Pit</em></strong> (<a href="United_States" title="wikilink">US</a> title: <strong><em>Five Million Years to Earth</em></strong>) is a 1967 <a href="Cinema_of_the_United_Kingdom" title="wikilink">British</a> <a href="science_fiction_film" title="wikilink">science fiction</a> <a href="horror_film" title="wikilink">horror film</a>. Made by <a href="Hammer_Film_Productions" title="wikilink">Hammer Film Productions</a> it is a <a href="sequel" class="uri" title="wikilink">sequel</a> to the earlier Hammer films <em><a href="The_Quatermass_Xperiment" title="wikilink">The Quatermass Xperiment</a></em> and <em><a href="Quatermass_2" title="wikilink">Quatermass 2</a></em>. Like its predecessors it is based on a <a href="BBC_Television" title="wikilink">BBC Television</a> serial &lt;U+2013&gt; <em><a href="Quatermass_and_the_Pit" title="wikilink">Quatermass and the Pit</a></em> &lt;U+2013&gt; written by <a href="Nigel_Kneale" title="wikilink">Nigel Kneale</a>. It was directed by <a href="Roy_Ward_Baker" title="wikilink">Roy Ward Baker</a> and stars <a href="Andrew_Keir" title="wikilink">Andrew Keir</a> in the title role as the eponymous professor, replacing <a href="Brian_Donlevy" title="wikilink">Brian Donlevy</a> who played the role in the two earlier films. <a href="James_Donald" title="wikilink">James Donald</a>, <a href="Barbara_Shelley" title="wikilink">Barbara Shelley</a> and <a href="Julian_Glover" title="wikilink">Julian Glover</a> appear in co-starring roles.</p>
<p>The plot, which is largely faithful to the original television production, centres around the discovery of a mysterious object buried in the ground at the site of an extension to the <a href="London_Underground" title="wikilink">London Underground</a>. Also uncovered nearby are the remains of early human ancestors more than five million years old. Realising that the object is in fact an ancient <a href="Mars" title="wikilink">Martian</a> spacecraft, Quatermass deduces that the aliens have influenced <a href="human_evolution" title="wikilink">human evolution</a> and the development of human <a href="intelligence" class="uri" title="wikilink">intelligence</a>. The spacecraft has an intelligence of its own and once uncovered begins to exert a malign influence, resurrecting Martian memories and instincts buried deep within the human <a href="psyche_(psychology)" title="wikilink">psyche</a>. Mayhem breaks out on the streets of London as the alien force grows in strength. It is only defeated when a metal object &lt;U+2013&gt; a building <a href="crane_(machine)" title="wikilink">crane</a> &lt;U+2013&gt; is swung into the centre of the force and the energy is <a href="ground_(electricity)" title="wikilink">discharged</a>.</p>
<p>Nigel Kneale wrote the first draft of the screenplay in 1961 but difficulties in attracting interest from American co-financiers meant the film did not go into production until 1967. The director, Roy Ward Baker, was chosen on account of his experience with technically demanding productions such as <em><a href="A_Night_to_Remember_(film)" title="wikilink">A Night to Remember</a></em>. This would be the first of many films he directed for Hammer. Andrew Keir, playing Quatermass, found making the film an unhappy experience, believing Baker had wanted <a href="Kenneth_More" title="wikilink">Kenneth More</a> to play the role. Due to lack of space the film was shot at the <a href="Elstree_Studios#Elstree_Way_Studios,_Borehamwood" title="wikilink">MGM studios</a> in <a href="Elstree" class="uri" title="wikilink">Elstree</a>, <a href="Borehamwood" class="uri" title="wikilink">Borehamwood</a> rather than Hammer's usual home at the time which was the <a href="Elstree_Studios#Elstree_Studios,_Borehamwood" title="wikilink">Associated British Studios</a>, also in Elstree.</p>
<p>The film opened in November 1967 to favourable reviews and remains generally well regarded. Hammer announced they would make a fourth <em>Quatermass</em> film but nothing ultimately came of this. A new adventure &lt;U+2013&gt; titled simply <em><a href="Quatermass_(TV_serial)" title="wikilink">Quatermass</a></em> &lt;U+2013&gt; was eventually made in 1979 by <a href="ITV" class="uri" title="wikilink">ITV</a> television in 1979 and received a limited cinema release under the title <em><a href="The_Quatermass_Conclusion" title="wikilink">The Quatermass Conclusion</a></em>.</p>
<h2 id="plot">Plot</h2>
<p>Workers building an extension to the London Underground at <a href="Hobbs_End" title="wikilink">Hobbs End</a> dig up skeletal remains. <a href="Palaeontology" title="wikilink">Palaeontologist</a> Dr Matthew Roney (<a href="James_Donald" title="wikilink">James Donald</a>) is called in and deduces that they are the remnants of a group of <a href="Hominidae" title="wikilink">apemen</a> over five million years old, more ancient than any previous finds of ancestral humans. During the dig one of Roney's assistants uncovers part of a metallic object. Believing it to be an <a href="unexploded_ordnance" title="wikilink">unexploded bomb</a>, they call in an army <a href="bomb_disposal" title="wikilink">bomb disposal</a> team.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Professor <a href="Bernard_Quatermass" title="wikilink">Bernard Quatermass</a> (<a href="Andrew_Keir" title="wikilink">Andrew Keir</a>) is dismayed to learn that his plans for the colonisation of the moon are to be handed over to the military. He gives a cold reception to Colonel Breen (<a href="Julian_Glover" title="wikilink">Julian Glover</a>) who has been assigned to join Quatermass' British Experimental Rocket Group. The meeting is interrupted when the bomb disposal team at Hobbs End call for Breen's assistance. Quatermass accompanies Breen to the site where Breen deduces it is a <a href="V-weapons" title="wikilink">V-weapon</a>. The bomb disposal team dig away the earth from around the missile and find another apeman skeleton in a chamber inside. Quatermass and Roney realise that this means that the missile must also be five million years old. Quatermass suspects the missile is alien but Roney is certain the apemen are of terrestrial origin.</p>
<p>Quatermass becomes intrigued by the name of the underground station &lt;U+2013&gt; Hobbs End &lt;U+2013&gt; recalling that &lt;U+201C&gt;hob&lt;U+201D&gt; is an old name for the <a href="Devil" class="uri" title="wikilink">Devil</a>. Working with Roney's assistant, Barbara Judd (<a href="Barbara_Shelley" title="wikilink">Barbara Shelley</a>), Quatermass makes inquiries into the history of the area and finds accounts going back over many centuries of hauntings and other spectral appearances. Quatermass and Judd deduce that these occurrences coincided with any disturbances of the ground around Hobbs End.</p>
<p>Breen and his men try to gain access to a sealed chamber at one end of the missile, inside of which, Breen believes, is a <a href="warhead" class="uri" title="wikilink">warhead</a>. An attempt to cut the chamber open with a <a href="borazon" class="uri" title="wikilink">borazon</a> drill has no effect except to cause an unbearable high-pitched vibration inside the missile. However, a few moments after the drill is stopped, a small hole can be seen in the surface of the chamber. The drill operator, Sladden (<a href="Duncan_Lamont" title="wikilink">Duncan Lamont</a>), is certain the hole was not created by his machine. The hole widens to reveal the contents of the sealed chamber: three-legged, insectoid, creatures with horned heads. Roney and Judd work to preserve the bodies before they can decay. An examination of the creatures' physiology suggests they came from the planet <a href="Mars" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mars</a>. Quatermass and Roney note the similarity between the appearance of the creatures and the Devil.</p>
<p>Sladden, who has been left alone to dismantle his drill, is overcome by a powerful <a href="psychokinesis" title="wikilink">telekinetic</a> force emanating from the missile and flees through the streets before finding sanctuary at a church. Sladden tells Quatermass he saw a vision of hordes of the creatures from the missile. Quatermass believes this is a <a href="race_memory" title="wikilink">race memory</a>. Seeking proof, he returns to Hobbs End, bringing a machine Roney has been working on which is designed to tap into the primeval <a href="psyche_(psychology)" title="wikilink">psyche</a> in the hope of better understanding the intelligence level of early humans. While trying to replicate the circumstances under which Sladden was affected by the alien force he notices that Judd has fallen under its influence. Using Roney's machine, he is able to record her thoughts.</p>
<p>Quatermass presents his theory to a Government Minister (<a href="Edwin_Richfield" title="wikilink">Edwin Richfield</a>) and his officials. The occupants of the missile came to Earth from the dying planet Mars. Unable to survive in Earth's environment, they chose to preserve some part of their race by creating a colony by proxy by significantly enhancing the intelligence of the native apemen. The descendants of these apemen evolved into modern humans but retain the vestiges of the Martian influence buried in their subconscious. He plays the recording of Judd's mind as evidence: it shows hordes of Martians engaged in a racial purge, cleansing the Martian hives of weaker members of the race. A disbelieving Breen offers an alternative theory: the missile was a failed <a href="Nazi_propaganda" title="wikilink">Nazi propaganda</a> exercise designed to sow fears of an alien invasion among the populace. The Minister rejects Quatermass' theory in favour of Breen's and decides the missile will be unveiled to the press.</p>
<p>Disaster strikes at the press event: the missile is able to draw extra power from the lights erected for the television cameras and the Martian influence takes holds again, this time over a wider area. The streets of London erupt into violence as those affected go on the rampage. Breen becomes drawn towards the missile and is killed by its energy. Quatermass falls under the alien influence but is snapped out of it by Roney who is unaffected. The two men realise that a small portion of the population are immune to the alien force. Those that are affected are reliving the Martian racial purges, killing those who don't fall under the influence. The psychic energy becomes stronger, ripping up streets and buildings, and the spectral image of a Martian looms over the city, centred on Hobbs End. Recalling stories about how the Devil could be defeated with iron and water, Quatermass theorises the alien energy could be <a href="ground_(electricity)" title="wikilink">discharged</a> into the earth with some metal. Roney climbs to the top of a building <a href="crane_(machine)" title="wikilink">crane</a> and swings it into the Martian spectre. The crane bursts into flames as it discharges the energy, killing Roney. With the alien influence defeated, Quatermass and Judd are left alone with their thoughts amid the devastation of London.</p>

<h3 id="origins">Origins</h3>

<p>Professor <a href="Bernard_Quatermass" title="wikilink">Bernard Quatermass</a> was first introduced to audiences in two BBC television serials &lt;U+2013&gt; <em><a href="The_Quatermass_Experiment" title="wikilink">The Quatermass Experiment</a></em> (1953) and <em><a href="Quatermass_II" title="wikilink">Quatermass II</a></em> (1955) &lt;U+2013&gt; written by <a href="Nigel_Kneale" title="wikilink">Nigel Kneale</a>. The rights to both these serials were acquired by <a href="Hammer_Film_Productions" title="wikilink">Hammer Film Productions</a> and the film adaptations &lt;U+2013&gt; <em><a href="The_Quatermass_Xperiment" title="wikilink">The Quatermass Xperiment</a></em> and <em><a href="Quatermass_2" title="wikilink">Quatermass 2</a></em> &lt;U+2013&gt; both directed by <a href="Val_Guest" title="wikilink">Val Guest</a> and starring <a href="Brian_Donlevy" title="wikilink">Brian Donlevy</a> as Quatermass were released in 1955 and 1957 respectively.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> Kneale went on to write a third Quatermass serial &lt;U+2013&gt; <em><a href="Quatermass_and_the_Pit" title="wikilink">Quatermass and the Pit</a></em> &lt;U+2013&gt; for the BBC which was broadcast in December 1958 and January 1959. Hammer were once again interested in making a film adaptation and Kneale, who had by then left the BBC and was working as a freelance screenwriter, completed a script in 1961. It was intended that Val Guest would once again direct and Brian Donlevy would reprise the role of Quatermass with production to commence in 1963.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> However, securing finance for the new Quatermass film proved problematic. In 1957 Hammer had stuck a deal with <a href="Columbia_Pictures" title="wikilink">Columbia Pictures</a> to distribute their pictures and the two companies would go on to collaborate on thirty films between 1957 and 1964.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> Columbia, who were not interested in Quatermass, passed on the script and production went into limbo for several years.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> In 1964 Kneale and <a href="Anthony_Hinds" title="wikilink">Anthony Hinds</a> submitted a revised, lower budget, script to Columbia but by this time the relationship between Hammer and Columbia had begun to sour and the script was once again rejected.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> In 1966 Hammer entered into a new distribution deal with <a href="Seven_Arts_Productions" title="wikilink">Seven Arts</a>, <a href="Associated_British_Picture_Corporation" title="wikilink">ABPC</a> and <a href="Twentieth_Century_Fox" title="wikilink">Twentieth Century Fox</a> and <em>Quatermass and the Pit</em> finally entered production.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="writing">Writing</h3>
<p>The script of <em>Quatermass and the Pit</em> is largely faithful to the television original. The plot was heavily condensed in order to fit the shorter running time of film with the main casualty being the removal of a <a href="subplot" class="uri" title="wikilink">subplot</a> involving the journalist James Fullalove who does not appear in the film adaptation at all.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> The climax was altered slightly to make it more cinematic with Roney using a crane to short out the Martian influence whereas in the television version he merely throws a metal chain into the pit.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> The setting for the pit itself was changed from a building site to the London Underground.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> The closing scene of the television version, in which Quatermass pleads with humanity to prevent Earth becoming the &lt;U+201C&gt;second dead planet&lt;U+201D&gt;, was also dropped in favour of a shot of Quatermass and Judd sitting alone amid the devastation wrought by the Martian spacecraft.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> The script was sent to <a href="John_Trevelyan_(censor)" title="wikilink">John Trevelyan</a> of the <a href="British_Board_of_Film_Classification" title="wikilink">British Board of Film Censors</a> in December 1966.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> Trevelyan replied that the film would require an <a href="X_rating" title="wikilink">&lt;U+2018&gt;X&lt;U+2019&gt;-Certificate</a> and raised concerns regarding the sound of the vibrations from the alien ship, the scenes of the Martian massacre, the scenes of destruction and panic as the Martian influence takes hold and the image of the Devil.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>

<p>By the time <em>Quatermass and the Pit</em> finally entered production Val Guest was occupied on <em><a href="Casino_Royale_(1967_film)" title="wikilink">Casino Royale</a></em> (1967) and so directing duties went instead to <a href="Roy_Ward_Baker" title="wikilink">Roy Ward Baker</a>.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> Baker's first film had been <em><a href="The_October_Man" title="wikilink">The October Man</a></em> (1947) and he was best known for <em><a href="The_One_That_Got_Away_(film)" title="wikilink">The One That Got Away</a></em> (1957) and <em><a href="A_Night_to_Remember_(1958_film)" title="wikilink">A Night to Remember</a></em> (1958).<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> Following the failure of <em><a href="Two_Left_Feet_(film)" title="wikilink">Two Left Feet</a></em> (1963), he moved into television directing episodes of <em><a href="The_Human_Jungle" title="wikilink">The Human Jungle</a></em> (1963-64), <em><a href="The_Saint_(TV_series)" title="wikilink">The Saint</a></em> (1962-69) and <em>The Avengers</em>.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> Producer Anthony Nelson Keys chose Baker as director because he felt his experience on such films as <em>A Night to Remember</em> gave him the technical expertise to handle the film's significant special effects requirements.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> Baker, for his part, felt that his background on fact-based dramas such as <em>A Night to Remember</em> and <em>The One That Got Away</em> enabled him to give <em>Quatermass and the Pit</em> the air of realism it needed to be convincing to audiences.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> He was impressed by Nigel Kneale's screenplay, feeling the script was &quot;taut, exciting and an intriguing story with excellent narrative drive.

<h2 id="reception">Reception</h2>
<p><em>Quatermass and the Pit</em> premiered on 9 November 1967 and went on general release in a <a href="double_feature" title="wikilink">double bill</a> with <em><a href="Circus_of_Fear" title="wikilink">Circus of Fear</a></em> on 19 November 1967.<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a> It was released under the title <em>Five Million Years to Earth</em> in the US in March 1968.<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a> The critical reception was generally positive. Writing in <em><a href="The_Times" title="wikilink">The Times</a></em>, <a href="John_Russell_Taylor" title="wikilink">John Russell Taylor</a> found that, &lt;U+201C&gt;After a slowish beginning, which shows up the deficiencies of acting and direction, things really start hopping when a mysterious missile-like object discovered in a London excavation proves to be a relic of a prehistoric Martian attempt (successful. it would seem) to colonize Earth [&lt;U+2026&gt;] The development of this situation is scrupulously worked out and the film is genuinely gripping even when (a real test this) the Power of Evil is finally shown personified in hazy glowing outline, a spectacle as a rule more likely to provoke titters than gasps of horror.&lt;U+201D&gt;<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a> Paul Errol of the <em><a href="Evening_Standard" title="wikilink">Evening Standard</a></em> described the film as a &lt;U+201C&gt;well-made, but wordy, blob of hokum&lt;U+201D&gt;, a view echoed by William Hall of the <em><a href="The_Evening_News_(London_newspaper)" title="wikilink">Evening News</a></em> who described the film as &lt;U+201C&gt;entertaining hokum&lt;U+201D&gt; with an &lt;U+201C&gt;imaginative ending&lt;U+201D&gt;.<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a> A slightly more critical view was espoused by <a href="Penelope_Mortimer" title="wikilink">Penelope Mortimer</a> in <em><a href="The_Observer" title="wikilink">The Observer</a></em> who said, &lt;U+201C&gt;This nonsense makes quite a good film, well put together, competently photographed, on the whole sturdily performed. What it totally lacks is imagination.&lt;U+201D&gt;<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a></p>

<p>The film was a success for Hammer and they quickly announced that Nigel Kneale was writing a new <em>Quatermass</em> story for them but the script never went further than a few prelimininary discussions.<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a> Kneale did eventually write a fourth <em>Quatermass</em> story, broadcast as a four-part serial, titled <em><a href="Quatermass_(TV_serial)" title="wikilink">Quatermass</a></em>, by <a href="ITV" class="uri" title="wikilink">ITV</a> television in 1979, an edited version of which was also given a limited cinema release under the title <em><a href="The_Quatermass_Conclusion" title="wikilink">The Quatermass Conclusion</a></em>.<a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a> <em>Quatermass and the Pit</em> marked the return to directing for the cinema for Roy Ward Baker and he went on to direct such films as <em><a href="The_Anniversary_(film)" title="wikilink">The Anniversary</a></em> (1968), <em><a href="Moon_Zero_Two" title="wikilink">Moon Zero Two</a></em> (1969), <em><a href="The_Vampire_Lovers" title="wikilink">The Vampire Lovers</a></em> (1970), <em><a href="Scars_of_Dracula" title="wikilink">Scars of Dracula</a></em> (1970), <em><a href="Dr._Jekyll_and_Sister_Hyde" title="wikilink">Dr. Jekyll and Sister Hyde</a></em> (1971) and <em><a href="The_Legend_of_the_7_Golden_Vampires" title="wikilink">The Legend of the 7 Golden Vampires</a></em> (1974) for Hammer.

<p><em>Quatermass and the Pit</em> continues to be generally well-regarded among critics. <a href="John_Baxter_(author)" title="wikilink">John Baxter</a> notes in <em>Science Fiction in the Cinema</em> that &lt;U+201C&gt;Baker's unravelling of this crisp thriller is tough and interesting. [&lt;U+2026&gt;] The film has moments of pure terror, perhaps the most effective that in which the drill operator, driven off the spaceship by the mysterious power within is caught up in a whirlwind that fills the excavation with a mass of flying papers.&lt;U+201D&gt;<a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a> <a href="John_Brosnan" title="wikilink">John Brosnan</a>, writing in <em>The Primal Scream</em>, found that, &lt;U+201C&gt;As a condensed version of the serial, the film is fine but the old black-and-white version, though understandably creaky in places and with inferior effects, still works surprisingly well, having more time to build up a disturbing atmosphere.<a href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a> <a href="Bill_Warren" title="wikilink">Bill Warren</a> in <em>Keep Watching the Skies!</em> said, &lt;U+201C&gt;The ambition of the storyline is contained in a well-constructed mystery that unfolds carefully and clearly&lt;U+201D&gt;.<a href="#fn67" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a> Nigel Kneale had mixed feelings about the end result: he said, &lt;U+201C&gt;I was very happy with Andrew Keir, who they eventually chose, and very happy with the film. There are, however, a few things that bother me... The special effects in Hammer films were always diabolical.&lt;U+201D&gt;<a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a></p>
