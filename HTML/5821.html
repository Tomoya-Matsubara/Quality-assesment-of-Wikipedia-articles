<p>--&gt; }} The <strong>Torre&lt;U+00F3&gt;n massacre</strong> was a racially-motivated <a href="massacre" class="uri" title="wikilink">massacre</a> that took place on 13&lt;U+2013&gt;15 May, 1911 in the <a href="Mexico" title="wikilink">Mexican</a> city of <a href="Torre&lt;U+00F3&gt;n" class="uri" title="wikilink">Torre&lt;U+00F3&gt;n</a>, <a href="Coahuila" class="uri" title="wikilink">Coahuila</a>. Over 300 <a href="Chinese_people" title="wikilink">Chinese</a> residents were killed by the revolutionary forces of <a href="Francisco_I._Madero" title="wikilink">Francisco I. Madero</a>. A large number of Chinese homes and establishments were looted and destroyed.</p>
<p>Torre&lt;U+00F3&gt;n was the last major city to be taken by the <a href="Factions_in_the_Mexican_Revolution#Maderistas" title="wikilink">Maderistas</a> during the <a href="Mexican_Revolution" title="wikilink">Mexican Revolution</a>. When the government forces withdrew, the rebels entered the city in the early morning and began a ten-hour massacre of the Chinese community.</p>
<p>The event touched off a diplomatic crisis between <a href="China" class="uri" title="wikilink">China</a> and Mexico, with the former demanding 30 million <a href="Mexican_peso" title="wikilink">pesos</a> in reparation. At one point it was rumored that China had even dispatched a warship to Mexican waters.</p>
<p>An investigation into the massacre concluded that it was an unprovoked act of racial hatred.</p>

<p><a href="Chinese_immigration_to_Mexico" title="wikilink">Chinese immigration to Mexico</a> began as early as the 17th century, with a number settling in <a href="Mexico_City" title="wikilink">Mexico City</a>. Immigration increased when Mexican president <a href="Porfirio_D&lt;U+00ED&gt;az" title="wikilink">Porfirio D&lt;U+00ED&gt;az</a> attempted to encourage foreign investment and tourism to boost the country's economy. The two countries signed a <a href="China&lt;U+2013&gt;Mexico_relations#History" title="wikilink">Treaty of Amity and Commerce</a> in 1899;<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a><a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> over time, the Chinese expatriates began to establish profitable businesses such as wholesale and retail groceries.

<p><a href="Torre&lt;U+00F3&gt;n" class="uri" title="wikilink">Torre&lt;U+00F3&gt;n</a> was an attractive destination for immigrants at the turn of the nineteenth century.

The Chinese community was easily the largest and most notable group of immigrants in the city.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> By 1903, it had formed the largest branch of the <a href="Baohuanghui" class="uri" title="wikilink">Baohuanghui</a> (Protect the Emperor Society) in Mexico.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p><img src="Portrait_of_Kang_Youwei.jpg" title="fig:A portrait of Kang Youwei from 1906 or earlier." alt="A portrait of Kang Youwei from 1906 or earlier." width="150" /> Mexico was one of the countries visited by <a href="Kang_Youwei" title="wikilink">Kang Youwei</a> after his exile from China.

<p>In 1907, a number of Mexican businessman gathered to form a chamber of commerce to protect their businesses from the foreigners. Instead of targeting Chinese specifically, they wrote: </p>
<p>Tensions and resentment of the Chinese ran high among the Mexican populace of Torre&lt;U+00F3&gt;n, stemming from the immigrants' prosperity and monopoly over the grocery trade.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> Nationwide resentment of the Chinese has also, conversely, been attributed to the fact that the Chinese represented a source of cheap-labor which was central to the Porfirian economic program. Therefore, opposing the Chinese was an indirect way to oppose the dictatorship.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a></p>
<p><a href="Sinophobia" title="wikilink">Anti-Chinese sentiments</a> were apparent in the <a href="Grito_de_Dolores" title="wikilink">Independence Day</a> speeches and demonstrations of 16 September 1910.

<p>The rebel forces entered the city at six o'clock, accompanied by a mob of over 4,000 men, women, and children from G&lt;U+00F3&gt;mez Palacio, <a href="Viesca" class="uri" title="wikilink">Viesca</a>, <a href="San_Pedro,_Coahuila" title="wikilink">San Pedro</a>, <a href="Lerdo" class="uri" title="wikilink">Lerdo</a>, and <a href="Matamoros,_Coahuila" title="wikilink">Matamoros</a>.<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a><a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a> They were joined by citizens of Torre&lt;U+00F3&gt;n and began the sacking of the <a href="Central_business_district" title="wikilink">business district</a>. The mob released prisoners from jail, looted stores, and attacked people on the street. They soon moved to the <a href="Chinatown" title="wikilink">Chinese district</a>. Men on horses drove Chinese from the gardens back into town, dragging them by their <a href="Queue_(hairstyle)" title="wikilink">queues</a> and shooting or trampling those who fell. Men, women, and children were killed indiscriminately when they fell in the way of the mob, and their bodies were robbed and mutilated.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a><a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a> It was reported that &quot;[i]n one instance the head of a Chinaman was severed from his body and thrown from the window into the street. In another instance a soldier took a little boy by the heels and battered his brains out against a lamp post. In many instances ropes were tied to the bodies of the Chinamen and they were dragged through the streets by men on horseback. In another instance a Chinaman was pulled to pieces in the street by horses hitched to his arms and legs.&quot;<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a><a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a> The mob finally reached the bank, where they killed the employees and hurled their severed body parts into the streets.<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a> A contemporary newspaper reported that &quot;heads of the murdered Chinese were rolled along the streets, and their bodies were tied to the tails of horses.&quot;<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a></p>
<p>A number of residents made attempts to save the Chinese from the mob.<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a> Seventy immigrants were saved by a tailor who stood atop the roof of a building where they were hiding and misdirected the mob that was hunting for them. Eleven were saved by Hermina Almar&lt;U+00E1&gt;z, the daughter of a Maderista leader, who told soldiers who wanted to take them from her home &quot;that they could only enter the house over her dead body.&quot; Another eight were saved by a second tailor, who stood in the rain in front of the laundry they worked at and lied to the rebels about their presence.<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a></p>
<p>Ten hours after the massacre had begun, at around four o'clock, Madero arrived in Torre&lt;U+00F3&gt;n on horseback and issued a proclamation decreeing the death penalty for anyone who killed a Chinese. This ended the massacre.<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a></p>

<p>Madero collected the surviving Chinese in a building and posted a hand-picked group of soldiers to protect them.<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a> Dead Mexicans were buried in the city's cemetery, but the bodies of the slain Chinese were stripped naked and <a href="Mass_grave" title="wikilink">buried together</a> in a trench.<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a></p>
<p>The same day as the massacre, Madero convened a <a href="Military_justice" title="wikilink">military tribunal</a> to hear testimony about the killings. The tribunal came to the conclusion that the Maderistas had &quot;committed atrocities&quot;, but the soldiers defended themselves by asserting that the Chinese had been armed and the massacre was an act of self-defense.<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a></p>
<p>Both the United States Consulate and the local Relief Committee began collecting donations from locals to support the Chinese. Between 17 May and 1 June, Dr. J. Lim and the Relief Committee collected over $6,000 dollars which they distributed at a rate of $30 per day to provide food and shelter for the survivors.<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a></p>

He concluded that the Maderistas' claims (that they had been fired on by the Chinese) were false, citing the 12 May circular by the reform society. He also dismissed the claim that the immigrants had been armed by General Lojero and his retreating Federales, pointing out that the reason for the evacuation was a dearth of ammunition. Furthermore, no witnesses reported any form of resistance by the Chinese. In his report, he called the incident &quot;an unprovoked massacre... conceived in <em>malice</em> and <em>race hatred</em>&quot; and concluded that it was a clear violation of the 1899 treaty between the two countries.<a href="#fn95" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref95"><sup>95</sup></a></p>
<p>Bassett, in collaboration with Owang King (a representative for China) and Antonio Ramos Pedrueza (representing Mexican President <a href="Francisco_Le&lt;U+00F3&gt;n_de_la_Barra" title="wikilink">Francisco Le&lt;U+00F3&gt;n de la Barra</a>), tendered a second report to Chang on 28 August, once again attempting to assess whether the Chinese themselves had prompted the massacre by resisting the Madistera troops.<a href="#fn96" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref96"><sup>96</sup></a> The editor of <em>Diogenes</em>, a local paper, stated that Lojero had &quot;authorized him to deny all allegations&quot; that he may have armed the Chinese. Upon further inquiry, the owners of local stores testified that they had not sold weapons to Chinese patrons before the massacre. The report concluded: </p>
<p>After failing to gain support from the United States, China reduced the demanded <a href="indemnity" class="uri" title="wikilink">indemnity</a> from thirty million to six million. However, it continued to demand an official apology, a guarantee of the safety of Chinese citizens in Mexico, and the punishment of the soldiers responsible for the massacre.<a href="#fn97" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref97"><sup>97</sup></a></p>
<p>As the 1911 Mexican Independence Day approached, the foreign community in Torre&lt;U+00F3&gt;n became restless, remembering the violence that had broken out at that time the previous year. To prevent another outbreak of violence, Francisco Madero sent 1,000 troops to the city.<a href="#fn98" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref98"><sup>98</sup></a></p>
<p>China and Mexico came to an agreement in November 1912, and a treaty was signed wherein Mexico granted 3,100,000 pesos in damages to China and extended an official apology. The deadline for payment was later extended to 15 February 1913.<a href="#fn99" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref99"><sup>99</sup></a> However, after the February 1913 assassination of Francisco Madero, Mexico entered a period of <a href="Economic_history_of_Mexico#Economic_woes_and_the_Great_Depression" title="wikilink">economic collapse</a>. They proposed to pay China in <a href="Bond_(finance)" title="wikilink">bonds</a>. The <a href="Netherlands" title="wikilink">Dutch</a> ambassador warned against it, believing that Mexico would be unable to obtain the foreign loans necessary for payment.<a href="#fn100" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref100"><sup>100</sup></a></p>
<p>The <a href="Senate_of_the_Republic_(Mexico)" title="wikilink">Mexican Senate</a> debated a number of ways to pay the indemnity through 1912 and 1913, including considering payment in <a href="silver" class="uri" title="wikilink">silver</a>. However, the bonds were never approved, and reparation was never made.<a href="#fn101" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref101"><sup>101</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="further-unrest">Further unrest</h3>

<p>The massacre in Torre&lt;U+00F3&gt;n was not the only instance of race violence against the Chinese during the revolution. In the first year alone, rebels and other Mexican citizens contributed to the deaths of some 324 Chinese. By 1919, another 129 had been killed in Mexico City, and 373 in <a href="Piedras_Negras,_Coahuila" title="wikilink">Piedras Negras</a>.<a href="#fn102" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref102"><sup>102</sup></a> The persecution and violence against the Chinese in Mexico finally culminated in 1931, with the expulsion of the remaining Chinese from Sonora.<a href="#fn103" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref103"><sup>103</sup></a></p>
