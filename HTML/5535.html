<p><strong>Wintjiya Napaltjarri</strong> (born c. 1923) (also spelt <strong>Wentjiya</strong> or <strong>Wentja</strong>), and also known as <strong>Wintjia Napaltjarri No. 1</strong>,<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> is a <a href="Pintupi_language" title="wikilink">Pintupi</a>-speaking <a href="Indigenous_Australian" title="wikilink">Indigenous</a> <a href="artist" class="uri" title="wikilink">artist</a> from <a href="Australia" title="wikilink">Australia's</a> <a href="Western_Desert_cultural_bloc" title="wikilink">Western Desert</a> region. She is the sister of artist <a href="Tjunkiya_Napaltjarri" title="wikilink">Tjunkiya Napaltjarri</a>.</p>
<p>Having commenced painting in 1994, Wintjiya has been involved in major collaborative art works at Haasts Bluff, and was a finalist in the 2007 and 2008 <a href="National_Aboriginal_and_Torres_Strait_Islander_Art_Award" title="wikilink">National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Art Awards</a>. Her work is held in major collections including the <a href="Art_Gallery_of_New_South_Wales" title="wikilink">Art Gallery of New South Wales</a>, the <a href="Museum_and_Art_Gallery_of_the_Northern_Territory" title="wikilink">Museum and Art Gallery of the Northern Territory</a>, and the <a href="National_Gallery_of_Victoria" title="wikilink">National Gallery of Victoria</a>.</p>

<p>'<a href="Napaljarri_(skin_name)" title="wikilink">Napaljarri</a>' (in Warlpiri) or 'Napaltjarri' (in Western Desert dialects) is a <a href="Australian_Aboriginal_kinship" title="wikilink">skin name</a>, one of sixteen used to denote the subsections or subgroups in the <a href="kinship_system" title="wikilink">kinship system</a> of central Australian Indigenous people. These names define kinship relationships that influence preferred marriage partners and may be associated with particular totems. Although they may be used as terms of address, they are not surnames in the sense used by Europeans.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a><a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> Thus 'Wintjiya' is the element of the artist's name that is specifically hers.</p>
<p>Wintjiya came from the area north west of Walungurru (the Pintupi language name for <a href="Kintore,_Northern_Territory" title="wikilink">Kintore, Northern Territory</a>) and, like a number of other artists in the region, settled first in <a href="Haasts_Bluff,_Northern_Territory" title="wikilink">Haasts Bluff</a> and then at <a href="Papunya,_Northern_Territory" title="wikilink">Papunya</a>.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> Johnson reports that she was born at Mulparingya, 'a swamp and spring to the northeast of Kintore', west of <a href="Alice_Springs,_Northern_Territory" title="wikilink">Alice Springs</a>. She is the sister of artist <a href="Tjunkiya_Napaltjarri" title="wikilink">Tjunkiya Napaltjarri</a>,<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> and both are widows of Toba Tjakamarra, father of one of the prominent founders of the <a href="Papunya_Tula" title="wikilink">Papunya Tula</a> art movement, Turkey Tolson.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> Wintjiya and Toba had five children: sons Bundy (born 1953) and Lindsey (born 1961 and now deceased); and daughters Rubilee (born 1955), Claire (born 1958) and Eileen (born 1960).<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="art">Art</h2>
<h3 id="background">Background</h3>
<p>Contemporary Indigenous art of the western desert began when Indigenous men at Papunya began painting in 1971, assisted by teacher <a href="Geoffrey_Bardon" title="wikilink">Geoffrey Bardon</a>.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> Their work, which used acrylic paints to create designs representing body painting and ground sculptures, rapidly spread across Indigenous communities of central Australia, particularly following the commencement of a government-sanctioned art program in central Australia in 1983.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> By the 1980s and 1990s, such work was being exhibited internationally.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> The first artists, including all of the founders of the <a href="Papunya_Tula" title="wikilink">Papunya Tula</a> artists' company, had been men, and there was resistance amongst the Pintupi men of central Australia to women painting.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> However, there was also a desire amongst many of the women to participate, and in the 1990s large numbers of them began to create paintings. In the western desert communities such as Kintore, <a href="Yuendumu,_Northern_Territory" title="wikilink">Yuendumu</a>, <a href="Balgo,_Western_Australia" title="wikilink">Balgo</a>, and on the <a href="outstation_movement" title="wikilink">outstations</a>, people were beginning to create art works expressly for exhibition and sale.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="career">Career</h3>
<p>Wintjiya first painted collaboratively: as one of a group of women who created murals on the Kintore Women's Centre walls in 1994 and then in 1994 joining a painting camp with other women from Kintore and Haasts Bluff to produce 'a series of very large collaborative canvases of the group's shared Dreamings'.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> Twenty-five women were involved in planning the works, which included three canvases that were three metres square, as well as two that were three by 1.5 metres, and Tjunkiya and Wintjiya performed a ceremonial dance as part of the preparations.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> Wintjiya and her sister were determined to participate in the project desite <a href="cataract" title="wikilink">cataracts</a> interfering with their vision.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> As was the case for <a href="Makinti_Napanangka" title="wikilink">Makinti Napanangka</a>, an operation to remove cataracts in 1999 resulted in a new brightness to Wintjiya's compositions.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> In the early 2000s she and her sister painted at Kintore, but in 2008 they were working from their home: &quot;the widows' camp ouside her 'son' Turkey Tolson's former residence&quot;.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a><a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> Tjunkiya and her sister Wintjiya did not confine their activities to painting canvases. The National Gallery of Victoria in 2001 purchased a collaborative <a href="batik" class="uri" title="wikilink">batik</a> work, created in 1994 by the sisters in cooperation with several other artists.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a></p>
<p>The work of Wintjiya has been included in a survey of the history of Papunya Tula painting, hosted by <a href="Flinders_University" title="wikilink">Flinders University</a> in the late 1990s. Reviewing the exhibition, Christine Nicholls remarked of Wintjiya's painting <em>Watanuma</em> that it was a germinal painting, with fine use of muted colour, and showed sensitivity to the relationships between objects and spaces represented in the work.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> Her painting <em>Rock holes west of Kintore</em> was a finalist in the 2007 <a href="National_Aboriginal_and_Torres_Strait_Islander_Art_Award" title="wikilink">National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Art Award</a>.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> This was followed up with another work, <em>Country west of Kintore</em>, being a finalist in 2008.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a></p>
<p>Works by Wintjiya are held in major private collections, such as Nangara (also known as the Ebes Collection).<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> In 1996, Wintjiya was represented in the <em>Papunya Women</em> group exhibition at Utopia Art Gallery in Sydney.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> Her work has been acquired my several major public art institutions, including the Art Gallery of New South Wales<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a><a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> and the National Gallery of Victoria.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> Works by both Wintjiya and her sister Tjunkiya are traded in the auction market, fetching prices of a few thousand dollars.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a><a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a></p>
