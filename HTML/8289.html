<p>The airport was originally planned as a conventional regional airport, but during its construction it was redesigned to accommodate larger jet aircraft. Originally owned by six local municipalities, it was taken over by the state in 1996. <a href="Norsk_Air" title="wikilink">Norsk Air</a> started operations in 1987, but terminated them the following year. <a href="Coast_Air" title="wikilink">Coast Air</a> introduced state-subsidized services in 1990, and continued until the contract was won by <a href="Teddy_Air" title="wikilink">Teddy Air</a> in 1996. From 2000 the airport was served by <a href="Guard_Air" title="wikilink">Guard Air</a>, but following their bankruptcy in 2001, services were taken over by <a href="Wider&lt;U+00F8&gt;e" class="uri" title="wikilink">Wider&lt;U+00F8&gt;e</a> for six months, when <a href="Arctic_Air" title="wikilink">Arctic Air</a> won a one-year contract. Coast Air resumed the service from 2003 to 2008, when they went bankrupt. <a href="Air_Norway" title="wikilink">Air Norway</a> then operated services for one year, pending <a href="DOT_LT" title="wikilink">DOT LT</a>'s take over in 2009.</p>

<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<p>Plans for an airport at Fagernes were initiated in 1975, and approved by the <a href="Storting" title="wikilink">Norwegian Parliament</a> in 1984, along with three other regional airports, at <a href="R&lt;U+00F8&gt;rvik_Airport,_Ryum" title="wikilink">R&lt;U+00F8&gt;rvik</a>, <a href="Mosj&lt;U+00F8&gt;en_Airport,_Kj&lt;U+00E6&gt;rstad" title="wikilink">Mosj&lt;U+00F8&gt;en</a> and <a href="F&lt;U+00F8&gt;rde_Airport,_Bringeland" title="wikilink">F&lt;U+00F8&gt;rde Airport, Bringeland</a>. Construction started in 1985, but plans were changed in 1986, when local authorities decided to build a longer runway to allow charter flights.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> The nearby <a href="Geilo_Airport,_Dagali" title="wikilink">Geilo Airport, Dagali</a>, a two-hour drive away, had already made a similar decision, and was in the process of extending its own runway.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> The airport opened on 31 October 1987. The state had initially paid 60% of the NOK 29.3 million investments for the  version of the airport, and the rest was financed by <a href="municipalities_of_Norway" title="wikilink">municipal</a> and <a href="county_municipality_(Norway)" title="wikilink">county</a> grants.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> The increased cost of building a longer runway was estimated at NOK 59 million, financed by loans and municipal grants, plus a NOK 10 million investment from Dansk Folkeferie. This gave the airport a  runway.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> The airport was owned by Valdres Lufthavn A/S, a privately held limited company with six municipalities as its principal shareholders.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> Following the airport's establishment, the <a href="Norwegian_State_Railways" title="wikilink">Norwegian State Railways</a>' <a href="Valdres_Line" title="wikilink">Valdres Line</a> was closed in 1989.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<p>By 1988, building costs had increased from NOK 88 to 131 million.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> The municipalities had <a href="co-sign" title="wikilink">co-signed</a> for a foreign loan, and were forced to pay NOK 3.5 million annually just in interest, in addition to the operating cost of the airport; these were aggravated by not only the loss of the sole scheduled service, but also considerably less charter traffic than estimated.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> In 1990, the airport company was forced to refinance, and NOK 61 of 85 million in dept was <a href="refinancing" title="wikilink">refinanced</a>, and the obligations transferred from the airport company to the municipalities and the county.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> However, by 1991, passenger numbers were above 20,000, three quarters coming from charter traffic.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> On 1 January 1996, Fagernes Airport was nationalized, along with 25 other regional airports, and put under the control of the <a href="Avinor" title="wikilink">Norwegian Airport Authority</a> (now Avinor).<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> Following the closure of <a href="Geilo_Airport,_Dagali" title="wikilink">Geilo Airport, Dagali</a> in 2003, Fagernes experienced an increase in charter traffic.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="operators">Operators</h3>
<p><a href="Norsk_Air" title="wikilink">Norsk Air</a> started a route from Fagernes to <a href="Oslo_Airport,_Fornebu" title="wikilink">Oslo Airport, Fornebu</a>, and <a href="Bergen_Airport,_Flesland" title="wikilink">Bergen Airport, Flesland</a>, on 4 November 1987, using <a href="Embraer_EMB_120_Brasilia" title="wikilink">Embraer EMB 120 Brasilia</a> aircraft.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> The route turned out to be unprofitable, and was terminated on 1 June 1988, after the company had lost NOK 5 million.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> About 4,500 passengers were using the airport each year, compared to the 120,000 carried annually by the <em><a href="NOR-WAY_Bussekspress" title="wikilink">Valdresekpressen</a></em> coach service on the  to Oslo.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a><a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> Local politicians contacted <a href="Wider&lt;U+00F8&gt;e" class="uri" title="wikilink">Wider&lt;U+00F8&gt;e</a> to discuss the possibility of introducing scheduled services, but the airline stated that it would only fly if it was granted subsidies.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a></p>
<p>An agreement for the provision of subsidies on services to Oslo and Bergen was not reached with the Ministry of Transport until 1990. The state agreed to provide NOK 4.5 million, with the the municipalities providing another NOK 2.6 million, and <a href="Oppland_County_Municipality" title="wikilink">Oppland County Municipality</a> NOK 2 million. The county and municipalities were allowed to reduce their subsidies in the event that passenger numbers increased. Although initially planned to be introduced in January 1990, Wider&lt;U+00F8&gt;e later dropped out, and the contract was awarded to <a href="Coast_Air" title="wikilink">Coast Air</a>, who began operating on 3 September 1990, using a <a href="de_Havilland_Canada_Twin_Otter" title="wikilink">de Havilland Canada Twin Otter</a> aircraft. The deal was the most expensive subsidy for regional aviation in the country; while the national average was NOK 156, the Fagernes route cost the authorities NOK 2,000 per passenger.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a><a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a></p>
<p>Coast Air continued to provide a service until 1 August 1996, when Fagernes became a trial for the use of <a href="public_service_obligation" title="wikilink">public service obligations</a> for regional aviation in Norway. The first contract was won by <a href="Teddy_Air" title="wikilink">Teddy Air</a>, to serve both Oslo and Bergen. The contract agreed a subsidy of NOK 23.7 million for three years, 15% less than Coast Air had been receiving.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> Teddy Air operated until 1 August 1999, when Wider&lt;U+00F8&gt;e took over using <a href="Bombardier_Dash_8" title="wikilink">de Havilland Canada Dash 8-100</a> aircraft. At the same time, the route from Fagernes to Bergen was dropped from the schedule.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> Wider&lt;U+00F8&gt;e's contract lasted only eight months, until 1 April 2000, when <a href="Guard_Air" title="wikilink">Guard Air</a>, who bid NOK 6.93 million per year, won the tender, and started flying with <a href="Dornier_228" title="wikilink">Dornier 228</a> aircraft.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> On 8 October 2001, Guard Air filed for bankruptcy, and the ministry signed an intermediate contract with Wider&lt;U+00F8&gt;e to fly the route.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> The subsequent tender was won by <a href="Arctic_Air" title="wikilink">Arctic Air</a>, who continued operation until 31 March 2003, using Dornier 228 aircraft.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a></p>
<p>From 1 April 2003, the contract was taken over by Coast Air, who put <a href="Jetstream_31" title="wikilink">Jetstream 31</a> aircraft into use. The same company won the contract again in 2006.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a><a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> Following Coast Air's bankruptcy on 23 January 2008, the route was taken over by <a href="Air_Norway" title="wikilink">Air Norway</a> on 4 February, after an extraordinary tender, using <a href="Fairchild_Metroliner" title="wikilink">Fairchild Metroliner</a> aircraft.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> From 1 April 2009, the service wil be provided by <a href="DOT_LT" title="wikilink">DOT LT</a>, who operate <a href="Saab_340" title="wikilink">Saab 340</a> aircraft.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a></p>
