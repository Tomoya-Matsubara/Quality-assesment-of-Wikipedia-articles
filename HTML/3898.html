<p><strong>Child labour</strong> refers to the employment of children at regular and sustained <a href="wage_labor" title="wikilink">labour</a>. This practice is considered exploitative by many <a href="international_organizations" title="wikilink">international organizations</a> and is illegal in many countries. Child labour was utilized to varying extents through most of history, but entered public dispute with the advent of <a href="universal_education" title="wikilink">universal schooling</a>, with changes in working conditions during the <a href="industrial_revolution" title="wikilink">industrial revolution</a>, and with the emergence of the concepts of <a href="labor_rights" title="wikilink">workers</a>' and <a href="children&#39;s_rights" title="wikilink">children's rights</a>.</p>
<p>In many developed countries, it is considered inappropriate or exploitative if a child below a certain age works (excluding household chores, in a family shop, or school-related work).<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> An employer is usually not permitted to hire a child below a certain minimum age. This minimum age depends on the country and the type of work involved. States ratifying the <a href="Minimum_Age_Convention,_1973" title="wikilink">Minimum Age Convention</a> adopted by the International Labor Organization in 1973, have adopted minimum ages varying from 14 to 16. <a href="Child_labor_laws_in_the_United_States" title="wikilink">Child labor laws in the United States</a> set the minimum age to work in an establishment without restrictions and without parents' consent at age 16.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>

<p>During the Industrial Revolution, children as young as four were employed in production factories with dangerous, and often fatal, working conditions.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> Based on this understanding of the use of children as labourers, it is now considered by wealthy countries to be a <a href="human_rights" title="wikilink">human rights</a> violation, and is outlawed, while some poorer countries may allow or tolerate child labour. Child labour can also be defined as the full-time employment of children who are under a minimum legal age.</p>
<p>The <a href="Victorian_era" title="wikilink">Victorian era</a> became notorious for employing young children in factories and mines and as chimney sweeps.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> Child labour played an important role in the <a href="Industrial_Revolution" title="wikilink">Industrial Revolution</a> from its outset, often brought about by economic hardship, <a href="Charles_Dickens" title="wikilink">Charles Dickens</a> for example worked at the age of 12 in a <a href="Blacking_(polish)" title="wikilink">blacking</a> factory, with his family in <a href="debtor&#39;s_prison" title="wikilink">debtor's prison</a>. The children of the poor were expected to help towards the family budget, often working long hours in dangerous jobs for low pay,<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> earning 10-20% of an adult male's wage. In England and Scotland in 1788, two-thirds of the workers in 143 water-powered <a href="cotton_mill" title="wikilink">cotton mills</a> were described as children.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> In 19th-century Great Britain, one-third of poor families were without a breadwinner, as a result of death or abandonment, obliging many children to work from a young age.</p>

<p>Children as young as three were put to work. A high number of children also worked as <a href="prostitute" title="wikilink">prostitutes</a>.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> Many children (and adults) worked 16 hour days.

These acts were largely ineffective and after radical agitation, by for example the &quot;Short Time Committees&quot; in 1831, a Royal Commission recommended in 1833 that children aged 11&lt;U+2013&gt;18 should work a maximum of 12 hours per day, children aged 9&lt;U+2013&gt;11 a maximum of eight hours, and children under the age of nine were no longer permitted to work.

<p>Child labour is still common in some parts of the <a href="world" class="uri" title="wikilink">world</a>, it can be factory work, mining,<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> <a href="prostitution_of_children" title="wikilink">prostitution</a>, quarrying, agriculture, helping in the parents' business, having one's own <a href="small_business" title="wikilink">small business</a> (for example selling food), or doing odd jobs. Some children work as guides for tourists, sometimes combined with bringing in business for shops and restaurants (where they may also work as waiters). Other children are forced to do tedious and repetitive jobs such as: assembling boxes, polishing shoes, stocking a store's products, or cleaning. However, rather than in factories and <a href="sweatshop" title="wikilink">sweatshops</a>, most child labour occurs in the informal sector, &quot;selling many things on the streets, at work in agriculture or hidden away in houses&lt;U+2014&gt;far from the reach of official labour inspectors and from media scrutiny.&quot; And all the work that they did was done in all types of weather; and was also done for minimal pay.

<h3 id="gap">GAP</h3>
<p>After the news of child labourers working in embroidery industry was uncovered in the <em>Sunday Observer</em> on 28 October 2007, BBA activists swung into action. The GAP Inc. in a statement accepted that the child labourers were working in production of GAP Kids blouses and has already made a statement to pull the products from the shelf.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a><a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> In spite of the documentation of the child labourers working in the high-street fashion and admission by all concerned parties, only the SDM (Sub-divisional Magistrate) could not recognise these children as working under conditions of slavery and bondage.</p>
<p>Distraught and desperate that these collusions by the custodians of justice, founder of BBA Kailash Satyarthi, Chairperson of Global March Against Child Labour appealed to the Honorable Chief Justice of Delhi High Court through a letter at 11.00 pm.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> This order by the Honorable Chief Justice comes when the government is taking an extremely reactionary stance on the issue of child labour in sweatshops in India and threatening 'retaliatory measures' against child rights organisations.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a></p>
<p>In a parallel development, Global March Against Child labour and BBA are in dialogue with the GAP Inc. and other stakeholders to work out a positive strategy to prevent the entry of child labour in to sweatshops and device a mechanism of monitoring and remedial action. GAP Inc. Senior Vice President, Dan Henkle in a statement said: &quot;We have been making steady progress, and the children are now under the care of the local government. As our policy requires, the vendor with which our order was originally placed will be required to provide the children with access to schooling and job training, pay them an ongoing wage and guarantee them jobs as soon as they reach the legal working age. We will now work with the local government and with Global March to ensure that our vendor fulfils these obligations.&quot;<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a><a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a></p>
<p>On October 28, Joe Eastman, president of Gap North America, responded, &quot;We strictly prohibit the use of child labor. This is non-negotiable for us &lt;U+2013&gt; and we are deeply concerned and upset by this allegation. As we've demonstrated in the past, Gap has a history of addressing challenges like this head-on, and our approach to this situation will be no exception. In 2006, Gap Inc. ceased business with 23 factories due to code violations. We have 90 people located around the world whose job is to ensure compliance with our Code of Vendor Conduct. As soon as we were alerted to this situation, we stopped the work order and prevented the product from being sold in stores.

<p>In 1997, research indicated that the number of child labourers in the silk-weaving industry in the district of Kanchipuram in India exceeded 40,000. This included children who were bonded labourers to loom owners. <a href="Rural_Institute_for_Development_Education" title="wikilink">Rural Institute for Development Education</a> undertook many activities to improve the situation of child labourers.

<p>On November 21, 2005, an Indian NGO activist Junned Khan,<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> with the help of the Labour Department and NGO Pratham mounted the country's biggest ever raid for child labour rescue in the Eastern part of New Delhi, the capital of India.

<p>Concerns have often been raised over the buying public's moral complicity in purchasing products assembled or otherwise manufactured in <a href="developing_countries" title="wikilink">developing countries</a> with child labour. However, others have raised concerns that <a href="boycott" title="wikilink">boycotting</a> products manufactured through child labour may force these children to turn to more dangerous or strenuous professions, such as prostitution or agriculture. For example, a <a href="UNICEF" class="uri" title="wikilink">UNICEF</a> study found that after the <a href="Child_Labor_Deterrence_Act" title="wikilink">Child Labor Deterrence Act</a> was introduced in the US, an estimated 50,000 children were dismissed from their garment industry jobs in <a href="Bangladesh" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bangladesh</a>, leaving many to resort to jobs such as &quot;stone-crushing, street hustling, and prostitution&quot;, jobs that are &quot;more hazardous and exploitative than garment production&quot;. The study suggests that boycotts are &quot;blunt instruments with long-term consequences, that can actually harm rather than help the children involved.&quot;<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a></p>
<p>According to <a href="Milton_Friedman" title="wikilink">Milton Friedman</a>, before the Industrial Revolution virtually all children worked in agriculture. During the Industrial Revolution many of these children moved from farm work to factory work. Over time, as real wages rose, parents became able to afford to send their children to school instead of work and as a result child labour declined, both before and after legislation.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> <a href="Austrian_school" title="wikilink">Austrian school</a> economist <a href="Murray_Rothbard" title="wikilink">Murray Rothbard</a> said that British and American children of the pre- and post-Industrial Revolution lived and suffered in infinitely worse conditions where jobs were not available for them and went &quot;voluntarily and gladly&quot; to work in factories.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a></p>

<dd><em>&quot;Fifty years ago it might have been assumed that, just as child labour had declined in the developed world in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, so it would also, in a trickle-down fashion, in the rest of the world.

<p>According to Thomas DeGregori, an economics professor at the <a href="University_of_Houston" title="wikilink">University of Houston</a>, in an article published by the <a href="Cato_Institute" title="wikilink">Cato Institute</a>, a <a href="Libertarianism" title="wikilink">libertarian</a> think-tank operating in Washington D.C., &quot;it is clear that technological and economic change are vital ingredients in getting children out of the workplace and into schools. Then they can grow to become productive adults and live longer, healthier lives. However, in poor countries like Bangladesh, working children are essential for survival in many families, as they were in our own heritage until the late 19th century. So, while the struggle to end child labour is necessary, getting there often requires taking different routes&lt;U+2014&gt;and, sadly, there are many political obstacles.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a></p>
