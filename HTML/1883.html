<p><strong>Henry Reynolds</strong> (born <a href="March_1" title="wikilink">March 1</a>, <a href="1938" class="uri" title="wikilink">1938</a>) is an eminent <a href="Australian" class="uri" title="wikilink">Australian</a> historian whose primary work has focused on the frontier conflict between European settlement of Australia and <a href="indigenous_Australians" title="wikilink">indigenous Australians</a>.</p>
<h2 id="education-and-career">Education and Career</h2>
<p>Reynolds received a state school education in <a href="Hobart" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hobart</a>, <a href="Tasmania" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tasmania</a> from 1944 to 1954, followed by attendance at the <a href="University_of_Tasmania" title="wikilink">University of Tasmania</a> to gain his Masters in Arts degree, then taught in secondary schools in Australia and England. He returned to Australia in 1964, accepting a post as lecturer and to set up the programme in Australian History at Townsville University College, now known as <a href="James_Cook_University" title="wikilink">James Cook University</a>. He gained his doctorate in history from James Cook University, and was later Associate Professor of History and Politics at the University from 1982 until retiring from there in 1998. He then took up an Australian Research Council post at the University of Tasmania in Launceston, and subsequently a post at Riawunna, the Centre for Aboriginal Education of the University of Tasmania</p>
<p>Henry Reynolds is married to <a href="Margaret_Reynolds" title="wikilink">Margaret Reynolds</a>, an <a href="Australian_Labor_Party" title="wikilink">ALP</a> Senator for <a href="Queensland" class="uri" title="wikilink">Queensland</a> in Federal Parliament (1983 until 1999).</p>
<h2 id="historical-research">Historical research</h2>

<p>In more than ten books and numerous academic articles Reynolds has researched and explained what he sees as the high level of violence and conflict involved in the colonisation of Australia, and the aboriginal resistance that resulted in numerous massacres of indigenous people. Reynolds, and other historians, estimate <a href="http://www.kooriweb.org/foley/news/story28.html">1</a> that up to 3,000 Europeans and 20,000 <a href="indigenous_Australians" title="wikilink">indigenous Australians</a> were killed directly in the frontier violence, and many more Aborigines died indirectly through the introduction of European diseases and starvation caused by being forced from their productive tribal lands.</p>
<p><a href="Geoffrey_Blainey" title="wikilink">Geoffrey Blainey</a> and <a href="Keith_Windschuttle" title="wikilink">Keith Windschuttle</a> categorise his approach as a <a href="Black_armband_view_of_history" title="wikilink">black armband view</a> of Australian history.</p>
<p>In 2002 historian and journalist, <a href="Keith_Windschuttle" title="wikilink">Keith Windschuttle</a>, in his book <em>The Fabrication of Aboriginal History, Volume One: Van Diemen's Land 1803-1847</em>, disputed whether the colonial settlers of Australia committed widespread <a href="genocide" class="uri" title="wikilink">genocide</a> against Indigenous Australians, especially focussing on the <a href="Black_War" title="wikilink">Black War</a> in Tasmania, and denied the claims by historians such as Reynolds and Professor <a href="Lyndall_Ryan" title="wikilink">Lyndall Ryan</a> that there was a campaign of guerrilla warfare against British settlement. He went further to accuse Reynolds of inventing evidence and making many claims without any documentary support at all.</p>
<p>Windschuttle's claims and research have been widely criticised by other historians, in an anthology edited and introduced by <a href="Robert_Manne" title="wikilink">Robert Manne</a>, Professor of politics at <a href="La_Trobe_University" title="wikilink">La Trobe University</a>. In 2004, John Dawson dissected the &quot;Whitewash&quot; anthology in <em>Washout: On the academic response to The Fabrication of Aboriginal History</em>, claiming to refute &quot;the fallacies, errors and distortion&quot; in &quot;Whitewash&quot;.</p>
