<p><strong>Paul Aloysius Hines</strong> (March 1, 1855 &lt;U+2013&gt; July 10, 1935) was an <a href="United_States" title="wikilink">American</a> <a href="center_fielder" title="wikilink">center fielder</a> in professional <a href="baseball" class="uri" title="wikilink">baseball</a> who played in the <a href="National_Association_of_Professional_Baseball_Players" title="wikilink">National Association</a> and <a href="Major_League_Baseball" title="wikilink">Major League Baseball</a> from 1872 to 1891. Born in <a href="Virginia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Virginia</a> , he is credited with winning baseball's first <a href="triple_crown_(baseball)" title="wikilink">triple crown</a> in ; the accomplishment was not noted at the time, as <a href="run_batted_in" title="wikilink">runs batted in</a> would not be counted until years later, <a href="home_run" title="wikilink">home runs</a> were rare and home run leadership obscure, and <a href="Abner_Dalrymple" title="wikilink">Abner Dalrymple</a> was then erroneously recognized as the batting champion. There is some controversy over whether Hines was also the first player to turn an <a href="unassisted_triple_play" title="wikilink">unassisted triple play</a>.</p>
<p>Hines probably practiced with the original <a href="Washington_Nationals_(NA)" title="wikilink">Washington Nationals</a> or played on its junior team before joining the National Association with that club in . When the original <a href="Chicago_Cubs" title="wikilink">Chicago White Stockings</a> resumed play in , the teenage Hines played every game, usually in center field. He remained with the club four seasons, including the inaugural <a href="National_League" title="wikilink">National League</a> championship season of , and then played eight seasons for the <a href="Providence_Grays" title="wikilink">Providence Grays</a> from 1878-85, that club's entire major league association including two more pennants. He remained an every day major league center fielder through two seasons for a new <a href="Washington_Nationals_(1886-1889)" title="wikilink">Washington Nationals</a> club and one for the <a href="Indianapolis_Hoosiers_(National_League)" title="wikilink">Indianapolis Hoosiers</a>, shifting to <a href="first_baseman" title="wikilink">first base</a> for a second Indianapolis season in 1889. He returned to center field with gradually declining playing time for the <a href="Pittsburgh_Pirates" title="wikilink">Pittsburgh Alleghenys</a>, <a href="Atlanta_Braves" title="wikilink">Boston Beaneaters</a> and <a href="Washington_Senators_(1891-1899)" title="wikilink">Washington Statesmen</a> in 1890 and . As of 2006 he is commonly listed as the oldest player in the major leagues during those seasons, ages 38 and 39, but recent research has shown that he was three years younger. He finished his professional career splitting <a href="1896_in_baseball" title="wikilink">1896</a> between <a href="Burlington,_Iowa" title="wikilink">Burlington, Iowa</a> and <a href="Mobile,_Alabama" title="wikilink">Mobile, Alabama</a> at age 41.</p>
<p>During the first five NL seasons, from 1876 through 1880, Hines made more <a href="hit_(baseball)" title="wikilink">base hits</a> than any other player, and he retired third to <a href="Cap_Anson" title="wikilink">Cap Anson</a> and <a href="Jim_O&#39;Rourke_(baseball)" title="wikilink">Jim O'Rourke</a> with 1,884 career hits in the majors. On May 8, <a href="1878_in_baseball" title="wikilink">1878</a> he made the 1st unassisted triple play in organized baseball. He also remained among the top ten major league career home run hitters as late as 1887. His total of 16 seasons as a major league team's primary center fielder was not surpassed until <a href="Tris_Speaker" title="wikilink">Tris Speaker</a> and <a href="Ty_Cobb" title="wikilink">Ty Cobb</a> in 1925.</p>
<p>Hines died at age 80 in <a href="Hyattsville,_Maryland" title="wikilink">Hyattsville, Maryland</a>, deaf and blind. His hearing had been impaired in the 1880s if not earlier.</p>
