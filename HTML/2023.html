<p>Born in <a href="Tampico,_Illinois" title="wikilink">Tampico, Illinois</a>, Reagan moved to <a href="Los_Angeles" title="wikilink">Los Angeles</a>, <a href="California" class="uri" title="wikilink">California</a> in 1937. He began a career as an <a href="actor" class="uri" title="wikilink">actor</a>, first in films and later television, appearing in over fifty movie productions and gaining enough success to become a famous man. Some of his most notable roles are in <em><a href="Knute_Rockne,_All_American" title="wikilink">Knute Rockne, All American</a></em> and <em><a href="Kings_Row" title="wikilink">Kings Row</a></em>.

Originally a member of the <a href="Democratic_Party_(United_States)" title="wikilink">Democratic Party</a>, he switched to the <a href="Republican_Party_(United_States)" title="wikilink">Republican Party</a> in 1962. After delivering a <a href="A_Time_for_Choosing" title="wikilink">rousing speech</a> in support of <a href="Barry_Goldwater" title="wikilink">Barry Goldwater</a>'s presidential candidacy in 1964, he was persuaded to seek the California governorship, winning <a href="California_gubernatorial_election,_1966" title="wikilink">two years later</a> and <a href="California_gubernatorial_election,_1970" title="wikilink">again in 1970</a>. He was defeated in his run for the Republican presidential nomination in <a href="United_States_presidential_election,_1968" title="wikilink">1968</a> as well as <a href="United_States_presidential_election,_1976" title="wikilink">1976</a>, but won both the nomination and election in <a href="United_States_presidential_election,_1980" title="wikilink">1980</a>.</p>
<p>As president, Reagan implemented sweeping new political and economic initiatives. His <a href="Supply-side_economics" title="wikilink">supply-side economic</a> policies, dubbed &quot;<a href="Reaganomics" class="uri" title="wikilink">Reaganomics</a>&quot;, advocated controlling the money supply to reduce inflation, and spurring economic growth by reducing <a href="Economic_Recovery_Tax_Act_of_1981" title="wikilink">tax rates</a>, government regulation of the economy, and certain types of government spending. In his first term he survived an <a href="Reagan_assassination_attempt" title="wikilink">assassination attempt</a>, <a href="Air_traffic_controllers&#39;_strike_of_1981" title="wikilink">took a hard line against labor unions</a>, and ordered <a href="Invasion_of_Grenada" title="wikilink">military actions</a> in <a href="Grenada" class="uri" title="wikilink">Grenada</a>.

His second term was primarily marked by foreign matters, such as the ending of the <a href="Cold_War" title="wikilink">Cold War</a>, the <a href="bombing_of_Libya" title="wikilink">bombing of Libya</a>, and the revelation of the <a href="Iran-Contra_affair" title="wikilink">Iran-Contra affair</a>. Publicly describing the Soviet Union as an &quot;<a href="evil_empire" title="wikilink">evil empire</a>&quot;,<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> he <a href="Reagan_Doctrine" title="wikilink">supported anti-Communist movements worldwide</a> and spent his first term forgoing the strategy of <a href="d&lt;U+00E9&gt;tente" class="uri" title="wikilink">d&lt;U+00E9&gt;tente</a> by ordering a massive military buildup in an arms race with the USSR. Reagan negotiated with <a href="General_Secretary_of_the_Communist_Party_of_the_Soviet_Union" title="wikilink">Soviet General Secretary</a> <a href="Mikhail_Gorbachev" title="wikilink">Mikhail Gorbachev</a>, culminating in the <a href="INF_Treaty" title="wikilink">INF Treaty</a> and the decrease of both countries' nuclear arsenals.</p>
<p>Reagan left office in 1989. In 1994, the former president disclosed that he had been diagnosed with <a href="Alzheimer&#39;s_disease" title="wikilink">Alzheimer's disease</a> earlier in the year; he <a href="Death_and_state_funeral_of_Ronald_Reagan" title="wikilink">died ten years later</a> at the age of 93.

<p>Reagan accepted the Republican nomination in <a href="Dallas" class="uri" title="wikilink">Dallas</a>, <a href="Texas" class="uri" title="wikilink">Texas</a>, on a wave of positive feeling.

With questions about Reagan's age, and a weak performance in the first presidential debate, it was questioned whether he was capable to be president for another term. This confused and forgetful behavior horrified his supporters at that moment, as they always knew him as clever and witty, and it is said that around this time were the early symptoms of Alzheimer's disease showing in him.<a href="#fn229" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref229"><sup>229</sup></a><a href="#fn230" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref230"><sup>230</sup></a> Reagan rebounded in the second debate, and confronted questions about his age, quipping, &quot;I will not make age an issue of this campaign.

<p>Reagan was sworn in as president for the second time on January 20, 1985, in a private ceremony at the <a href="White_House" title="wikilink">White House</a>. Because January 20 fell on a Sunday, a public celebration was not held but took place in the <a href="Capitol_Rotunda" title="wikilink">Capitol Rotunda</a> the following day.

Reagan issued a statement that called the Nazi soldiers buried in that cemetery &quot;victims&quot;, which ignited a stir over whether he had equated the SS men to <a href="The_Holocaust" title="wikilink">Holocaust</a> victims; <a href="Pat_Buchanan" title="wikilink">Pat Buchanan</a>, Director of Communications under Reagan, argued that the notion was false.<a href="#fn235" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref235"><sup>235</sup></a> Now strongly urged to cancel the visit,<a href="#fn236" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref236"><sup>236</sup></a> the president responded that it would be wrong to back down on a promise he had made to Chancellor Kohl.

<p>The first generation of writing about Reagan comprised studies on the right that approached <a href="hagiography" class="uri" title="wikilink">hagiography</a>, and on the left a devil theory, all relying on popular journalism for their facts.

<p>Historically, Ronald Reagan did not have the highest approval ratings as a sitting president,<a href="#fn392" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref392"><sup>392</sup></a> but his popularity has increased since 1989. Gallup polls in 2001 and 2007 have ranked him number one or number two when correspondents were asked for the greatest president in history, and third of post-World War II presidents in a 2007 <a href="Rasmussen_Reports" title="wikilink">Rasmussen Reports</a> poll, fifth in an ABC 2000 poll, ninth in another 2007 Rasmussen poll, and eighth in a late 2008 poll by United Kingdom newspaper <em><a href="The_Times" title="wikilink">The Times</a></em>.<a href="#fn393" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref393"><sup>393</sup></a><a href="#fn394" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref394"><sup>394</sup></a><a href="#fn395" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref395"><sup>395</sup></a> In a <a href="Siena_College" title="wikilink">Siena College</a> survey of over 200 historians, however, Reagan ranked sixteenth out of 42.<a href="#fn396" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref396"><sup>396</sup></a><a href="#fn397" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref397"><sup>397</sup></a> While the debate about Reagan's legacy is ongoing, the 2009 Annual <em><a href="C-SPAN" class="uri" title="wikilink">C-SPAN</a> Survey of Presidential Leaders</em> ranked Reagan the 10th greatest president. The survey of leading historians rated Reagan number 11 in 2000.<a href="#fn398" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref398"><sup>398</sup></a> <img src="Gallup_Poll-Approval_Rating-Ronald_Reagan.png" title="fig:Ronald Reagan&#39;s approval ratings (Gallup 1981&lt;U+2013&gt;89)" alt="Ronald Reagan&#39;s approval ratings (Gallup 1981&lt;U+2013&gt;89)" /></p>
<p>Reagan's ability to connect with the American people<a href="#fn399" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref399"><sup>399</sup></a> earned him the laudatory moniker &quot;The Great Communicator&quot;.<a href="#fn400" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref400"><sup>400</sup></a> Of it, Reagan said, &quot;I won the nickname the great communicator. But I never thought it was my style that made a difference&lt;U+2014&gt;it was the content. I wasn't a great communicator, but I communicated great things.&quot;<a href="#fn401" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref401"><sup>401</sup></a> His age and soft-spoken speech gave him a warm grandfatherly image.<a href="#fn402" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref402"><sup>402</sup></a><a href="#fn403" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref403"><sup>403</sup></a><a href="#fn404" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref404"><sup>404</sup></a></p>
<p>Reagan also earned the nickname &quot;the Teflon President&quot;, in that public perceptions of him were not tarnished by the controversies that arose during his administration.<a href="#fn405" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref405"><sup>405</sup></a> According to Congresswoman <a href="Patricia_Schroeder" title="wikilink">Patricia Schroeder</a>, who coined the phrase, and reporter Howard Kurtz, the epithet referred to Reagan's ability to &quot;do almost anything wrong<a href="#fn406" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref406"><sup>406</sup></a> and not get blamed for it.&quot;<a href="#fn407" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref407"><sup>407</sup></a><a href="#fn408" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref408"><sup>408</sup></a></p>
<p>Public reaction to Reagan was always mixed; the oldest president was supported by young voters, and began an alliance that shifted many of them to the Republican party.<a href="#fn409" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref409"><sup>409</sup></a> Reagan did not fare well with minority groups, especially <a href="African-Americans" class="uri" title="wikilink">African-Americans</a>.<a href="#fn410" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref410"><sup>410</sup></a> This was largely due to his opposition to affirmative action policies.<a href="#fn411" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref411"><sup>411</sup></a> However, his support of Israel throughout his presidency earned him support from many Jews.<a href="#fn412" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref412"><sup>412</sup></a> He emphasized <a href="family_values" title="wikilink">family values</a> in his campaigns and during his presidency, although he was the first president to have been divorced.<a href="#fn413" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref413"><sup>413</sup></a> The combination of Reagan's speaking style, unabashed patriotism, negotiation skills, as well as his savvy use of the media, played an important role in defining the 1980s and his future legacy.<a href="#fn414" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref414"><sup>414</sup></a></p>
<p>Reagan was known to gibe frequently during his lifetime, displayed humor throughout his presidency,<a href="#fn415" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref415"><sup>415</sup></a> and was famous for his <a href="storytelling" class="uri" title="wikilink">storytelling</a>.<a href="#fn416" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref416"><sup>416</sup></a> His numerous jokes and <a href="There_you_go_again_(Reagan)" title="wikilink">one-liners</a> have been labeled &quot;classic quips&quot; and &quot;legendary&quot;.<a href="#fn417" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref417"><sup>417</sup></a> Among the most notable of his jokes was one regarding the Cold War. As a sound check prior to his <a href="Presidential_address" title="wikilink">weekly radio address</a> in August 1984, Reagan made the following joke as a way to test the microphone: &quot;My fellow Americans, I'm pleased to tell you today that I've signed legislation that will outlaw Russia forever. <a href="Reagan&#39;s_&quot;We_begin_bombing_in_five_minutes&quot;_joke" title="wikilink">We begin bombing in five minutes</a>.&quot;<a href="#fn418" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref418"><sup>418</sup></a> Former aide <a href="David_Gergen" title="wikilink">David Gergen</a> commented, &quot;It was that humor... that I think endeared people to Reagan.&quot;<a href="#fn419" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref419"><sup>419</sup></a></p>
