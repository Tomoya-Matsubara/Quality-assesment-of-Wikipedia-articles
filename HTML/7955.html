He served three terms as <a href="Chief_of_Air_Force_(Australia)" title="wikilink">Chief of the Air Staff</a>, alternating with <a href="Wing_Commander_(rank)" title="wikilink">Wing Commander</a> (later <a href="Air_Marshal" title="wikilink">Air Marshal</a> Sir) <a href="Richard_Williams_(RAAF_officer)" title="wikilink">Richard Williams</a>. Goble came to national attention in 1924 when he and fellow RAAF pilot <a href="Ivor_McIntyre" title="wikilink">Ivor McIntyre</a> became the first men to <a href="Circumnavigation" title="wikilink">circumnavigate</a> Australia by air, journeying  in a single-engined <a href="floatplane" class="uri" title="wikilink">floatplane</a>.</p>
<p>During <a href="World_War_I" title="wikilink">World War I</a>, Goble flew <a href="Fighter_aircraft" title="wikilink">fighters</a> on the <a href="Western_Front_(World_War_I)" title="wikilink">Western Front</a> with the British <a href="Royal_Naval_Air_Service" title="wikilink">Royal Naval Air Service</a>. He became an <a href="Flying_ace" title="wikilink">ace</a>, commanded No. 5 Squadron (later <a href="No._205_Squadron_RAF" title="wikilink">No. 205 Squadron RAF</a>), and was awarded the <a href="Distinguished_Service_Order" title="wikilink">Distinguished Service Order</a> and the <a href="Distinguished_Service_Cross_(United_Kingdom)" title="wikilink">Distinguished Service Cross</a>. Returning to Australia, Goble assisted in the formation of the RAAF as an independent branch of the <a href="Australian_Defence_Force" title="wikilink">Australian armed forces</a>. On an exchange posting to Britain in the 1930s, he led <a href="No._2_Group_RAF" title="wikilink">No. 2 Group (Bomber) RAF</a>.</p>
<p>As Chief of the Air Staff at the onset of <a href="World_War_II" title="wikilink">World War II</a>, Goble clashed with the <a href="Government_of_Australia" title="wikilink">Federal Government</a> over implementation of the <a href="British_Commonwealth_Air_Training_Plan" title="wikilink">Empire Air Training Scheme</a>, which he believed would be detrimental to the defence of Australia. He stepped down as leader of the RAAF in early 1940, and spent the rest of the war in <a href="Ottawa" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ottawa</a> as Air Liaison Officer to Canada. Goble died in 1948 at the age of fifty-six, two years after his retirement from the military.</p>

<p>Born in <a href="Croydon,_Victoria" title="wikilink">Croydon, Victoria</a>, Stanley James Goble was one of four sons to an Australian father, George, and an English mother, Ann. He began his working life as a <a href="clerk" class="uri" title="wikilink">clerk</a> with the Victorian Railways at the age of sixteen and by twenty-three was, like his father, a stationmaster.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a><a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>Goble was prevented from joining the <a href="Australian_Imperial_Force" title="wikilink">Australian Imperial Force</a> at the beginning of <a href="World_War_I" title="wikilink">World War I</a> after failing the stringent medical criteria; he wrote later that &quot;only applicants of the finest physiques were considered suitable for the first contingent of Australian troops&quot;.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> With his three brothers already on active service, however, he decided to travel to <a href="England" class="uri" title="wikilink">England</a> at his own expense and enlist in the British armed forces.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>

<p>Goble was accepted for flying training with the <a href="Royal_Naval_Air_Service" title="wikilink">Royal Naval Air Service</a> in July 1915. After graduating as a Flight Sub-Lieutenant on 20 October 1915, he became a <a href="test_pilot" title="wikilink">test pilot</a> and undertook <a href="anti-submarine_warfare" title="wikilink">anti-submarine patrols</a> out of <a href="Dover" class="uri" title="wikilink">Dover</a>.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> Goble commenced operations with only three hours solo flying experience.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> Towards the end of the year he was posted across the <a href="English_Channel" title="wikilink">Channel</a> to <a href="Dunkirk" class="uri" title="wikilink">Dunkirk</a>, flying <a href="Caudron" class="uri" title="wikilink">Caudron</a> <a href="reconnaissance" class="uri" title="wikilink">reconnaissance</a>-<a href="bomber" title="wikilink">bombers</a> and <a href="Sopwith_Pup" title="wikilink">Sopwith Pup</a> <a href="Fighter_aircraft" title="wikilink">fighters</a>.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a><a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>

<p>On 17 February 1917, Goble was awarded the <a href="Distinguished_Service_Order" title="wikilink">Distinguished Service Order</a> (DSO) for his &quot;conspicuous bravery and skill&quot; in three separate actions while operating with No. 8 Squadron: on 7 November 1916 when he forced a hostile fighter down in a field, where it crashed attempting to land; on 27 November when he engaged four enemy aircraft, destroying one; and on 4 December when, in repeated combats while escorting Allied bombers, he helped drive off attacking fighters and shot down one of them.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> The same month he was awarded the DSO, Goble was posted to <a href="No._205_Squadron_RAF" title="wikilink">No. 5 Squadron RNAS</a> at <a href="Petite-Synthe" class="uri" title="wikilink">Petite-Synthe</a> near the Franco-Belgian border, flying <a href="Airco_DH.4" title="wikilink">Airco DH.4</a> two-seat light bombers.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>

<p>When a temporary Air Board was set up to examine the feasibility of an Australian Air Force (AAF), Goble was assigned as a Navy representative, with Lieutenant Colonel <a href="Richard_Williams_(RAAF_officer)" title="wikilink">Richard Williams</a>, an Australian Flying Corps veteran of World War I, acting as an <a href="Australian_Army" title="wikilink">Army</a> spokesman. The permanent Australian Air Board was established on 9 November 1920, and recommended creation of the AAF as an independent branch of the armed services.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> The AAF came into being on 31 March 1921—the 'Royal' prefix being granted five months later—and Goble resigned his commission in the RAF the same day to transfer to the new service as a Wing Commander.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a><a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a></p>
<p>The Navy had nominated Goble as First Air Member (later <a href="Chief_of_Air_Force_(Australia)" title="wikilink">Chief of the Air Staff</a>), however Williams took the post and Goble became Second Air Member and Director of Personnel and Training.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a><a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> Williams and Goble would serve as Chief of the Air Staff (CAS) three times each between 1922 and 1940.

<p>The rivalry between Goble and Williams was such that it was later alleged that government practice was to ensure that they were never in the country at the same time.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> In October 1921, Goble was posted to Britain on a marine observer's course.
