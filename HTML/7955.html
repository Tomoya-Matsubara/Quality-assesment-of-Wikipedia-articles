He served three terms as <a href="Chief_of_Air_Force_(Australia)" title="wikilink">Chief of the Air Staff</a>, alternating with <a href="Wing_Commander_(rank)" title="wikilink">Wing Commander</a> (later <a href="Air_Marshal" title="wikilink">Air Marshal</a> Sir) <a href="Richard_Williams_(RAAF_officer)" title="wikilink">Richard Williams</a>. Goble came to national attention in 1924 when he and fellow RAAF pilot <a href="Ivor_McIntyre" title="wikilink">Ivor McIntyre</a> became the first men to <a href="Circumnavigation" title="wikilink">circumnavigate</a> Australia by air, journeying  in a single-engined <a href="floatplane" class="uri" title="wikilink">floatplane</a>.</p>
<p>During <a href="World_War_I" title="wikilink">World War I</a>, Goble flew <a href="Fighter_aircraft" title="wikilink">fighters</a> on the <a href="Western_Front_(World_War_I)" title="wikilink">Western Front</a> with the British <a href="Royal_Naval_Air_Service" title="wikilink">Royal Naval Air Service</a>. He became an <a href="Flying_ace" title="wikilink">ace</a>, commanded No. 5 Squadron (later <a href="No._205_Squadron_RAF" title="wikilink">No. 205 Squadron RAF</a>), and was awarded the <a href="Distinguished_Service_Order" title="wikilink">Distinguished Service Order</a> and the <a href="Distinguished_Service_Cross_(United_Kingdom)" title="wikilink">Distinguished Service Cross</a>. Returning to Australia, Goble assisted in the formation of the RAAF as an independent branch of the <a href="Australian_Defence_Force" title="wikilink">Australian armed forces</a>. On an exchange posting to Britain in the 1930s, he led <a href="No._2_Group_RAF" title="wikilink">No. 2 Group (Bomber) RAF</a>.</p>
<p>As Chief of the Air Staff at the onset of <a href="World_War_II" title="wikilink">World War II</a>, Goble clashed with the <a href="Government_of_Australia" title="wikilink">Federal Government</a> over implementation of the <a href="British_Commonwealth_Air_Training_Plan" title="wikilink">Empire Air Training Scheme</a>, which he believed would be detrimental to the defence of Australia. He stepped down as leader of the RAAF in early 1940, and spent the rest of the war in <a href="Ottawa" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ottawa</a> as Air Liaison Officer to Canada. Goble died in 1948 at the age of fifty-six, two years after his retirement from the military.</p>

<p>Born in <a href="Croydon,_Victoria" title="wikilink">Croydon, Victoria</a>, Stanley James Goble was one of four sons to an Australian father, George, and an English mother, Ann. He began his working life as a <a href="clerk" class="uri" title="wikilink">clerk</a> with the Victorian Railways at the age of sixteen and by twenty-three was, like his father, a stationmaster.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a><a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>Goble was prevented from joining the <a href="Australian_Imperial_Force" title="wikilink">Australian Imperial Force</a> at the beginning of <a href="World_War_I" title="wikilink">World War I</a> after failing the stringent medical criteria; he wrote later that &quot;only applicants of the finest physiques were considered suitable for the first contingent of Australian troops&quot;.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> With his three brothers already on active service, however, he decided to travel to <a href="England" class="uri" title="wikilink">England</a> at his own expense and enlist in the British armed forces.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>

<p>Goble was accepted for flying training with the <a href="Royal_Naval_Air_Service" title="wikilink">Royal Naval Air Service</a> in July 1915. After graduating as a Flight Sub-Lieutenant on 20 October 1915, he became a <a href="test_pilot" title="wikilink">test pilot</a> and undertook <a href="anti-submarine_warfare" title="wikilink">anti-submarine patrols</a> out of <a href="Dover" class="uri" title="wikilink">Dover</a>.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> Goble commenced operations with only three hours solo flying experience.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> Towards the end of the year he was posted across the <a href="English_Channel" title="wikilink">Channel</a> to <a href="Dunkirk" class="uri" title="wikilink">Dunkirk</a>, flying <a href="Caudron" class="uri" title="wikilink">Caudron</a> <a href="reconnaissance" class="uri" title="wikilink">reconnaissance</a>-<a href="bomber" title="wikilink">bombers</a> and <a href="Sopwith_Pup" title="wikilink">Sopwith Pup</a> <a href="Fighter_aircraft" title="wikilink">fighters</a>.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a><a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>

<p>On 17 February 1917, Goble was awarded the <a href="Distinguished_Service_Order" title="wikilink">Distinguished Service Order</a> (DSO) for his &quot;conspicuous bravery and skill&quot; in three separate actions while operating with No. 8 Squadron: on 7 November 1916 when he forced a hostile fighter down in a field, where it crashed attempting to land; on 27 November when he engaged four enemy aircraft, destroying one; and on 4 December when, in repeated combats while escorting Allied bombers, he helped drive off attacking fighters and shot down one of them.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> The same month he was awarded the DSO, Goble was posted to <a href="No._205_Squadron_RAF" title="wikilink">No. 5 Squadron RNAS</a> at <a href="Petite-Synthe" class="uri" title="wikilink">Petite-Synthe</a> near the Franco-Belgian border, flying <a href="Airco_DH.4" title="wikilink">Airco DH.4</a> two-seat light bombers.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>

<p>When a temporary Air Board was set up to examine the feasibility of an Australian Air Force (AAF), Goble was assigned as a Navy representative, with Lieutenant Colonel <a href="Richard_Williams_(RAAF_officer)" title="wikilink">Richard Williams</a>, an Australian Flying Corps veteran of World War I, acting as an <a href="Australian_Army" title="wikilink">Army</a> spokesman. The permanent Australian Air Board was established on 9 November 1920, and recommended creation of the AAF as an independent branch of the armed services.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> The AAF came into being on 31 March 1921â€”the 'Royal' prefix being granted five months laterâ€”and Goble resigned his commission in the RAF the same day to transfer to the new service as a Wing Commander.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a><a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a></p>
<p>The Navy had nominated Goble as First Air Member (later <a href="Chief_of_Air_Force_(Australia)" title="wikilink">Chief of the Air Staff</a>), however Williams took the post and Goble became Second Air Member and Director of Personnel and Training.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a><a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> Williams and Goble would serve as Chief of the Air Staff (CAS) three times each between 1922 and 1940.

<p>The rivalry between Goble and Williams was such that it was later alleged that government practice was to ensure that they were never in the country at the same time.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> In October 1921, Goble was posted to Britain on a marine observer's course.
