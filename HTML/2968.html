<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<p>The precise date of foundation of the church is not known but the west tower was erected between 1490 and 1526. The body of the church was rebuilt in stone in 1800 following a bequest from Ralph Kirkham, a wealthy merchant of <a href="Manchester" class="uri" title="wikilink">Manchester</a>. This consisted of a nave and sanctuary with no architectural division, which Richards describes as being &quot;a poor attempt at imitation of the classical style&quot;. In 1870 there was a restoration as a result of which most of the fittings were lost. By 1936 the roof timbers were becoming unsafe and they were replaced by a steel roof.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
