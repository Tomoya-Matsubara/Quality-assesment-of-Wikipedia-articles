<p><strong>Anarchism</strong> is a <a href="political_philosophy" title="wikilink">political philosophy</a> encompassing <a href="anarchist_schools_of_thought" title="wikilink">theories and attitudes</a> which consider the <a href="Sovereign_state" title="wikilink">state</a> to be unnecessary, harmful, or otherwise undesirable, and favour instead a <a href="stateless_society" title="wikilink">stateless society</a> or <a href="anarchy" class="uri" title="wikilink">anarchy</a>.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a><a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> Individual anarchists may have additional criteria for what they conceive to be anarchism, and there is often broad disagreement concerning these broader conceptions. According to <em><a href="The_Oxford_Companion_to_Philosophy" title="wikilink">The Oxford Companion to Philosophy</a></em>, &quot;there is no single defining position that all anarchists hold, and those considered anarchists at best share a certain <a href="family_resemblance" title="wikilink">family resemblance</a>.&quot;<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>There are many types and traditions of anarchism, not all of which are mutually exclusive.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> Strains of anarchism have been divided into the categories of <a href="socialist_anarchism" title="wikilink">socialist</a> and <a href="individualist_anarchism" title="wikilink">individualist anarchism</a> or similar dual classifications.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a><a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> Anarchism is often considered to be a <a href="far_left" title="wikilink">radical left-wing</a> ideology,<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a><a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> and much of <a href="anarchist_economics" title="wikilink">anarchist economics</a> and <a href="anarchist_law" title="wikilink">anarchist legal philosophy</a> reflect <a href="anti-statism" title="wikilink">anti-statist</a> interpretations of <a href="anarcho-communism" title="wikilink">communism</a>, <a href="collectivist_anarchism" title="wikilink">collectivism</a>, <a href="anarcho-syndicalism" title="wikilink">syndicalism</a> or <a href="participatory_economics" title="wikilink">participatory economics</a>; however, anarchism has always included an <a href="individualist_anarchism" title="wikilink">individualist</a> strain,<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> with that strain supporting a <a href="market_economy" title="wikilink">market economy</a> and <a href="private_property" title="wikilink">private property</a>, or egoism.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a><a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>

<h2 id="etymology-and-terminology">Etymology and terminology</h2>

<p>The term <em><a href="wikt:anarchism" title="wikilink">anarchism</a></em> derives from the <a href="Greek_language" title="wikilink">Greek</a> &lt;U+1F04&gt;&lt;U+03BD&gt;&lt;U+03B1&gt;&lt;U+03C1&gt;&lt;U+03C7&gt;&lt;U+03BF&gt;&lt;U+03C2&gt;, <em>anarchos</em>, meaning &quot;without rulers&quot;,<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a><a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> from the prefix &lt;U+1F00&gt;&lt;U+03BD&gt;- (<em>an-</em>, &quot;without&quot;) + &lt;U+1F00&gt;&lt;U+03C1&gt;&lt;U+03C7&gt;&lt;U+03AE&gt; (<em>arch&lt;U+00EA&gt;</em>, &quot;sovereignty, realm, magistracy&quot;)<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> + -&lt;U+03B9&gt;&lt;U+03C3&gt;&lt;U+03BC&gt;&lt;U+03CC&gt;&lt;U+03C2&gt; (<em>-ismos</em>, from the <a href="Suffix_(linguistics)" title="wikilink">suffix</a> -&lt;U+03B9&gt;&lt;U+03B6&gt;&lt;U+03B5&gt;&lt;U+03B9&gt;&lt;U+03BD&gt;, <em>-izein</em> &quot;-izing&quot;).

<p>Anarchism as a <a href="social_movement" title="wikilink">social movement</a> has regularly endured fluctuations in popularity.

<p>In Europe, harsh reaction followed the <a href="revolutions_of_1848" title="wikilink">revolutions of 1848</a>, during which ten countries had experienced brief or long-term social upheaval as groups carried out nationalist uprisings. After most of these attempts at systematic change ended in failure, conservative elements took advantage of the divided groups of socialists, anarchists, liberals, and nationalists, to prevent further revolt.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> In 1864 the <a href="International_Workingmen&#39;s_Association" title="wikilink">International Workingmen's Association</a> (sometimes called the &quot;First International&quot;) united diverse revolutionary currents including French followers of <a href="Pierre-Joseph_Proudhon" title="wikilink">Proudhon</a>,<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> <a href="Blanquism" title="wikilink">Blanquists</a>, <a href="Philadelphes" class="uri" title="wikilink">Philadelphes</a>, English trade unionists, <a href="socialists" class="uri" title="wikilink">socialists</a> and <a href="social_democrats" title="wikilink">social democrats</a>.</p>
<p>Due to its links to active workers' movements, the International became a significant organization. <a href="Karl_Marx" title="wikilink">Karl Marx</a> became a leading figure in the International and a member of its General Council. Proudhon's followers, the <a href="Mutualism_(economic_theory)" title="wikilink">mutualists</a>, opposed Marx's <a href="state_socialism" title="wikilink">state socialism</a>, advocating political <a href="abstentionism" class="uri" title="wikilink">abstentionism</a> and small property holdings.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a><a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1868, following their unsuccessful participation in the <a href="League_of_Peace_and_Freedom" title="wikilink">League of Peace and Freedom</a> (LPF), Russian revolutionary <a href="Mikhail_Bakunin" title="wikilink">Mikhail Bakunin</a> and his <a href="collectivist_anarchism" title="wikilink">collectivist anarchist</a> associates and joined the First International (which had decided not to get involved with the LPF).<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> They allied themselves with the <a href="federalist" class="uri" title="wikilink">federalist</a> socialist sections of the International,<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a> who advocated the revolutionary overthrow of the state and the collectivization of property.</p>
<p>At first, the collectivists worked with the Marxists to push the First International in a more revolutionary socialist direction. Subsequently, the International became polarised into two camps, with Marx and Bakunin as their respective figureheads.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a> Bakunin characterised Marx's ideas as <a href="centralism" title="wikilink">centralist</a> and predicted that, if a Marxist party came to power, its leaders would simply take the place of the <a href="ruling_class" title="wikilink">ruling class</a> they had fought against.<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a><a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1872, the conflict climaxed with a final split between the two groups at the <a href="Hague_Congress_(1872)" title="wikilink">Hague Congress</a>, where Bakunin and <a href="James_Guillaume" title="wikilink">James Guillaume</a> were expelled from the International and its headquarters were transferred to New York. In response, the federalist sections formed their own International at the <a href="Anarchist_St._Imier_International" title="wikilink">St. Imier Congress</a>, adopting a revolutionary anarchist program.<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="organised-labour">Organised labour</h3>

<p>The anti-authoritarian sections of the First International were the precursors of the anarcho-syndicalists, seeking to &quot;replace the privilege and authority of the State&quot; with the &quot;free and spontaneous organization of labor.&quot;<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a> In 1886, the <a href="Federation_of_Organized_Trades_and_Labor_Unions" title="wikilink">Federation of Organized Trades and Labor Unions</a> (FOTLU) of the United States and Canada unanimously set 1 May 1886, as the date by which the <a href="Eight-hour_day" title="wikilink">eight-hour work day</a> would become standard.<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a></p>
<p>In response, unions across America prepared a <a href="general_strike" title="wikilink">general strike</a> in support of the event.<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a> On 3 May, in Chicago, a fight broke out when <a href="strikebreaker" title="wikilink">strikebreakers</a> attempted to cross the picket line, and two workers died when police opened fire upon the crowd.<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a> The next day, 4 May, anarchists staged a rally at Chicago's Haymarket Square.<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a> A bomb was thrown by an unknown party near the conclusion of the rally, killing an officer.<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a> In the ensuing panic, police opened fire on the crowd and each other.<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a> Seven police officers and at least four workers were killed.<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a> Eight anarchists directly and indirectly related to the organisers of the rally were arrested and charged with the murder of the deceased officer. The men became international political celebrities among the labour movement. Four of the men were executed and a fifth committed suicide prior to his own execution. The incident became known as the <a href="Haymarket_affair" title="wikilink">Haymarket affair</a>, and was a setback for the labour movement and the struggle for the eight hour day. In 1890 a second attempt, this time international in scope, to organise for the eight hour day was made. The event also had the secondary purpose of memorializing workers killed as a result of the Haymarket affair.<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a> Although it had initially been conceived as a once-off event, by the following year the celebration of <a href="International_Workers&#39;_Day" title="wikilink">International Workers' Day</a> on <a href="May_Day" title="wikilink">May Day</a> had become firmly established as an international worker's holiday.<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1907, the <a href="International_Anarchist_Congress_of_Amsterdam" title="wikilink">International Anarchist Congress of Amsterdam</a> gathered delegates from 14 different countries, among which important figures of the anarchist movement, including <a href="Errico_Malatesta" title="wikilink">Errico Malatesta</a>, <a href="Pierre_Monatte" title="wikilink">Pierre Monatte</a>, <a href="Luigi_Fabbri" title="wikilink">Luigi Fabbri</a>, <a href="Beno&lt;U+00EE&gt;t_Broutchoux" title="wikilink">Beno&lt;U+00EE&gt;t Broutchoux</a>, <a href="Emma_Goldman" title="wikilink">Emma Goldman</a>, <a href="Rudolf_Rocker" title="wikilink">Rudolf Rocker</a>, and <a href="Christiaan_Cornelissen" title="wikilink">Christiaan Cornelissen</a>. Various themes were treated during the Congress, in particular concerning the organisation of the anarchist movement, <a href="popular_education" title="wikilink">popular education</a> issues, the <a href="general_strike" title="wikilink">general strike</a> or <a href="antimilitarism" class="uri" title="wikilink">antimilitarism</a>. A central debate concerned the relation between anarchism and <a href="syndicalism" class="uri" title="wikilink">syndicalism</a> (or <a href="trade_union" title="wikilink">trade unionism</a>). Malatesta and Monatte were in particular disagreement themselves on this issue, as the latter thought that syndicalism was revolutionary and would create the conditions of a <a href="social_revolution" title="wikilink">social revolution</a>, while Malatesta did not consider syndicalism by itself sufficient.<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a> He thought that the trade-union movement was <a href="reformism" title="wikilink">reformist</a> and even <a href="Conservatism" title="wikilink">conservative</a>, citing as essentially bourgeois and anti-worker the phenomenon of professional union officials. Malatesta warned that the syndicalists aims were in perpetuating syndicalism itself, whereas anarchists must always have anarchy as their end and consequently refrain from committing to any particular method of achieving it.<a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a></p>
<p>The Spanish Workers Federation in 1881 was the first major anarcho-syndicalist movement; anarchist trade union federations were of special importance in Spain. The most successful was the <a href="Confederaci&lt;U+00F3&gt;n_Nacional_del_Trabajo" title="wikilink">Confederaci&lt;U+00F3&gt;n Nacional del Trabajo</a> (National Confederation of Labour: CNT), founded in 1910. Before the 1940s, the CNT was the major force in Spanish working class politics, attracting 1.58 million members at one point and playing a major role in the <a href="Spanish_Civil_War" title="wikilink">Spanish Civil War</a>.<a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a> The CNT was affiliated with the International Workers Association, a federation of anarcho-syndicalist trade unions founded in 1922, with delegates representing two million workers from 15 countries in Europe and Latin America. The largest organised anarchist movement today is in Spain, in the form of the <a href="Confederaci&lt;U+00F3&gt;n_General_del_Trabajo" title="wikilink">Confederaci&lt;U+00F3&gt;n General del Trabajo</a> (CGT) and the <a href="Confederaci&lt;U+00F3&gt;n_Nacional_del_Trabajo" title="wikilink">CNT</a>. CGT membership was estimated to be around 100,000 for the year 2003.<a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a> Other active syndicalist movements include the US <a href="Workers_Solidarity_Alliance" title="wikilink">Workers Solidarity Alliance</a> and the UK <a href="Solidarity_Federation" title="wikilink">Solidarity Federation</a>.

<p>In the 1920s and 1930s, the rise of <a href="fascism" class="uri" title="wikilink">fascism</a> in Europe transformed anarchism's conflict with the state.

<p>Since the revival of anarchism in the mid 20th century,<a href="#fn95" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref95"><sup>95</sup></a> a number of new movements and schools of thought emerged. Although feminist tendencies have always been a part of the anarchist movement in the form of <a href="anarcha-feminism" class="uri" title="wikilink">anarcha-feminism</a>, they returned with vigour during the second wave of feminism in the 1960s.

Therefore he does not believe in equal rights, but the person's life that should be favoured that is most conducive to the general good.<a href="#fn125" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref125"><sup>125</sup></a> Godwin opposed government because he saw it as infringing on the individual's right to &quot;private judgement&quot; to determine which actions most maximise utility, but also makes a critique of all authority over the individual's judgement. This aspect of Godwin's philosophy, stripped of utilitarian motivations, was developed into a more extreme form later by Stirner.<a href="#fn126" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref126"><sup>126</sup></a></p>
<p>The most extreme form of individualist anarchism, called &quot;egoism,&quot;<a href="#fn127" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref127"><sup>127</sup></a> or <a href="egoist_anarchism" title="wikilink">egoist anarchism</a>, was expounded by one of the earliest and best-known proponents of individualist anarchism, Max Stirner.<a href="#fn128" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref128"><sup>128</sup></a> Stirner's <em><a href="The_Ego_and_Its_Own" title="wikilink">The Ego and Its Own</a></em>, published in 1844, is a founding text of the philosophy.<a href="#fn129" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref129"><sup>129</sup></a> According to Stirner's conception, the only limitation on the rights of the individual is their power to obtain what they desire,<a href="#fn130" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref130"><sup>130</sup></a> without regard for God, state, or moral rules.<a href="#fn131" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref131"><sup>131</sup></a> To Stirner, rights were <em><a href="reification" title="wikilink">spooks</a></em> in the mind, and he held that society does not exist but &quot;the individuals are its reality&quot;.<a href="#fn132" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref132"><sup>132</sup></a> Egoist anarchists claim that egoism will foster genuine and spontaneous union between individuals.<a href="#fn133" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref133"><sup>133</sup></a> &quot;Egoism&quot; has inspired many interpretations of Stirner's philosophy. It was re-discovered and promoted by German philosophical anarchist and <a href="LGBT" class="uri" title="wikilink">LGBT</a> activist <a href="John_Henry_Mackay" title="wikilink">John Henry Mackay</a>. Individualist anarchism inspired by Stirner attracted a small following of European bohemian artists and intellectuals (see <a href="European_individualist_anarchism" title="wikilink">European individualist anarchism</a>). Stirner's philosophy has been seen as a precedent of <a href="existentialism" class="uri" title="wikilink">existentialism</a> with other thinkers like <a href="Friedrich_Nietzsche" title="wikilink">Friedrich Nietzsche</a> and <a href="S&lt;U+00F6&gt;ren_Kierkegaard" title="wikilink">S&lt;U+00F6&gt;ren Kierkegaard</a>.</p>

In contrast with most forms of individualist anarchism, which stresses the importance of private property or possession, socialist anarchism rejects private property, seeing it as a source of social inequality, and emphasises cooperation and mutual aid.<a href="#fn134" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref134"><sup>134</sup></a></p>
<p><a href="Collectivist_anarchism" title="wikilink">Collectivist anarchism</a>, also referred to as &quot;revolutionary socialism&quot; or a form of such,<a href="#fn135" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref135"><sup>135</sup></a><a href="#fn136" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref136"><sup>136</sup></a> is a revolutionary form of anarchism, commonly associated with <a href="Mikhail_Bakunin" title="wikilink">Mikhail Bakunin</a> and <a href="Johann_Most" title="wikilink">Johann Most</a>.<a href="#fn137" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref137"><sup>137</sup></a><a href="#fn138" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref138"><sup>138</sup></a> Collectivist anarchists oppose all private ownership of the means of production, instead advocating that ownership be collectivised.

Since the revival of anarchism in the United States in the 1960s,<a href="#fn151" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref151"><sup>151</sup></a> a number of new movements and schools have emerged.<a href="#fn152" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref152"><sup>152</sup></a> <a href="Anarcho-capitalism" class="uri" title="wikilink">Anarcho-capitalism</a> developed from radical anti-state <a href="libertarianism" class="uri" title="wikilink">libertarianism</a> and <a href="individualist_anarchism" title="wikilink">individualist anarchism</a>, drawing from <a href="Austrian_School" title="wikilink">Austrian School</a> economics, study of <a href="law_and_economics" title="wikilink">law and economics</a> and <a href="public_choice_theory" title="wikilink">public choice theory</a>,<a href="#fn153" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref153"><sup>153</sup></a> while the burgeoning <a href="feminism" title="wikilink">feminist</a> and <a href="environmentalism" title="wikilink">environmentalist</a> movements also produced anarchist offshoots. <a href="Anarcha-feminism" class="uri" title="wikilink">Anarcha-feminism</a> developed as a synthesis of <a href="radical_feminism" title="wikilink">radical feminism</a> and anarchism that views <a href="patriarchy" class="uri" title="wikilink">patriarchy</a> (male domination over women) as a fundamental manifestation of compulsory government.

<h2 id="internal-issues-and-debates">Internal issues and debates</h2>

<p>Anarchism is a philosophy which embodies many diverse attitudes, tendencies and schools of thought; as such, disagreement over questions of values, ideology and tactics is common. The compatibility of <a href="anarchism_and_capitalism" title="wikilink">capitalism</a>,<a href="#fn156" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref156"><sup>156</sup></a> <a href="anarchism_and_nationalism" title="wikilink">nationalism</a> and <a href="anarchism_and_religion" title="wikilink">religion</a> with anarchism is widely disputed. Similarly, anarchism enjoys complex relationships with ideologies such as <a href="Anarchism_and_Marxism" title="wikilink">Marxism</a>, <a href="Issues_in_anarchism#Communism" title="wikilink">communism</a> and <a href="Anarchism_and_capitalism" title="wikilink">capitalism</a>. Anarchists may be motivated by <a href="humanism" class="uri" title="wikilink">humanism</a>, <a href="Christian_anarchism" title="wikilink">divine authority</a>, <a href="ethical_egoism" title="wikilink">enlightened self-interest</a> or any number of alternative ethical doctrines.</p>
<p>Phenomena such as <a href="civilization" class="uri" title="wikilink">civilization</a>, <a href="technology" class="uri" title="wikilink">technology</a> (e.g. within <a href="anarcho-primitivism" class="uri" title="wikilink">anarcho-primitivism</a> and <a href="insurrectionary_anarchism" title="wikilink">insurrectionary anarchism</a>), and <a href="Issues_in_anarchism#Participation_in_statist_democracy" title="wikilink">the democratic process</a> may be sharply criticised within some anarchist tendencies and simultaneously lauded in others. Anarchist attitudes towards <a href="Issues_in_anarchism#Race" title="wikilink">race</a>, <a href="Issues_in_anarchism#Gender" title="wikilink">gender</a> and <a href="Issues_in_anarchism#The_environment" title="wikilink">the environment</a> have changed significantly since the modern origin of the philosophy in the 18th century.</p>
<p>On a tactical level, while <a href="propaganda_of_the_deed" title="wikilink">propaganda of the deed</a> was a tactic used by anarchists in the 19th century (e.g. the <a href="Nihilist_movement" title="wikilink">Nihilist movement</a>), contemporary anarchists espouse alternative <a href="direct_action" title="wikilink">direct action</a> methods such as <a href="nonviolence" class="uri" title="wikilink">nonviolence</a>, <a href="counter-economics" class="uri" title="wikilink">counter-economics</a> and <a href="Crypto-anarchism" title="wikilink">anti-state cryptography</a> to bring about an anarchist society. About the scope of an anarchist society, some anarchists advocate a <a href="global" class="uri" title="wikilink">global</a> one, while others do so by local ones.<a href="#fn157" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref157"><sup>157</sup></a> The diversity in anarchism has led to widely different use of identical terms among different anarchist traditions, which has led to many <a href="Issues_in_anarchism#Definitional_concerns" title="wikilink">definitional concerns in anarchist theory</a>.</p>
