<p>The <strong>speed of light</strong> in a <a href="vacuum" class="uri" title="wikilink">vacuum</a> is <em>exactly</em> <a href="Orders_of_magnitude_(speed)" title="wikilink">299,792,458</a> <a href="metres_per_second" title="wikilink">metres per second</a> or 1,079,252,848.8  <a href="kilometre" title="wikilink">kilometres</a> per hour. Converted to <em>approximate</em> <a href="imperial_units" title="wikilink">imperial units</a>, it is 186,282.397 <a href="mile" title="wikilink">miles</a> per second, or 670,616,629.384 miles per hour. This value is denoted by the letter <em>c</em>, reputedly from the <a href="Latin" class="uri" title="wikilink">Latin</a> <em><a href="celeritas" class="uri" title="wikilink">celeritas</a></em>, &quot;<a href="speed" class="uri" title="wikilink">speed</a>.&quot; Note that this speed is a <em>definition</em>, not a <em>measurement</em>, since the fundamental <a href="SI" class="uri" title="wikilink">SI</a> unit of distance, the <a href="metre" class="uri" title="wikilink">metre</a>, has been defined since <a href="21_October" title="wikilink">21 October</a> <a href="1983" class="uri" title="wikilink">1983</a> in terms of the speed of light—one metre is the distance light travels in a vacuum in 1/299,792,458 of a second. The speed of light through a transparent medium (that is, not in <a href="vacuum" class="uri" title="wikilink">vacuum</a>) is less than <em>c</em>; the ratio of <em>c</em> to this speed is called the <a href="refractive_index" title="wikilink">refractive index</a> of the medium.</p>
<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>According to standard modern <a href="physics" title="wikilink">physical theory</a>, all <a href="electromagnetic_radiation" title="wikilink">electromagnetic radiation</a>, including <a href="visible_light" title="wikilink">visible light</a>, propagates (or moves) at a constant speed (or velocity) in a vacuum, commonly known as the speed of light, which is a <a href="physical_constant" title="wikilink">physical constant</a> denoted as <em>c</em>. This speed <em>c</em> is also the speed of the propagation of <a href="gravity" class="uri" title="wikilink">gravity</a> in the theory of <a href="general_relativity" title="wikilink">general relativity</a>.</p>
<p>One consequence of the laws of electromagnetism (such as <a href="Maxwell&#39;s_equations" title="wikilink">Maxwell's equations</a>) is that the speed <em>c</em> of electromagnetic radiation does not depend on the velocity of the object emitting the radiation; thus for instance the light emitted from a rapidly moving light source would travel at the same speed as the light coming from a stationary light source (although the colour, frequency, energy, and momentum of the light will be shifted, which is called the <a href="relativistic_Doppler_effect" title="wikilink">relativistic Doppler effect</a>). If one combines this observation with the <a href="principle_of_relativity" title="wikilink">principle of relativity</a>, one concludes that all observers will measure the speed of light in vacuum as being the same, regardless of the <a href="frame_of_reference" title="wikilink">reference frame</a> of the observer or the velocity of the object emitting the light. Because of this, one can view <em>c</em> as a fundamental <a href="physical_constant" title="wikilink">physical constant</a>. This fact can then be used as a basis for the theory of <a href="special_relativity" title="wikilink">special relativity</a>. It is worth noting that it is the constant speed <em>c</em>, rather than light itself, which is fundamental to special relativity; thus if light is somehow manipulated to travel at less than <em>c</em>, this will not directly affect the theory of special relativity.</p>
<p>Observers travelling at large velocities will find that distances and times are distorted (&quot;dilated&quot;) in accordance with the <a href="Lorentz_transformation" title="wikilink">Lorentz transforms</a>; however, the transforms distort times and distances in such a way that the speed of light remains constant. A person travelling near the speed of light would also find that colours of lights ahead were <a href="blue_shift" title="wikilink">blue shifted</a> and of those behind were <a href="redshift" title="wikilink">redshifted</a>.</p>
<p>If information could travel faster than <em>c</em> in one reference frame, <a href="causality_(physics)" title="wikilink">causality</a> would be violated: in some other reference frames, the information would be received before it had been sent, so the 'cause' could be observed after the 'effect'. Due to special relativity's <a href="time_dilation" title="wikilink">time dilation</a>, the ratio between an external observer's perceived time and the time perceived by an observer moving closer and closer to the speed of light approaches zero. If something could move faster than light, this ratio would not be a <a href="real_number" title="wikilink">real number</a>. Such a violation of causality has never been observed.</p>

</figure>
<p>To put it another way, information propagates to and from a point from regions defined by a <a href="light_cone" title="wikilink">light cone</a>. The <a href="interval" class="uri" title="wikilink">interval</a> AB in the diagram to the right is '<a href="time-like" class="uri" title="wikilink">time-like</a>' (that is, there is a frame of reference in which event A and event B occur at the same location in space, separated only by their occurring at different times, and if A precedes B in that frame then A precedes B in all frames: there is no frame of reference in which event A and event B occur simultaneously). Thus, it is hypothetically possible for matter (or information) to travel from A to B, so there can be a causal relationship (with A the 'cause' and B the 'effect').</p>
<p>On the other hand, the interval AC in the diagram to the right is '<a href="space-like" class="uri" title="wikilink">space-like</a>' (that is, there is a frame of reference in which event A and event C occur simultaneously, separated only in space; see <a href="simultaneity" class="uri" title="wikilink">simultaneity</a>). However, there are also frames in which A precedes C (as shown) or in which C precedes A. Barring some way of travelling <a href="faster_than_light" title="wikilink">faster than light</a>, it is not possible for any matter (or information) to travel from A to C or from C to A. Thus there is no causal connection between A and C.</p>
<p>According to the currently prevailing definition, adopted in <a href="1983" class="uri" title="wikilink">1983</a>, the speed of light is exactly 299,792,458 metres per second (approximately 3 &lt;U+00D7&gt; 10<sup>8</sup> metres per second, or about thirty <a href="centimetre" title="wikilink">centimetres</a> (one <a href="foot_(unit_of_length)" title="wikilink">foot</a>) per <a href="nanosecond" class="uri" title="wikilink">nanosecond</a>). The value of <span class="math inline"><em>c</em></span> defines the <a href="permittivity" class="uri" title="wikilink">permittivity</a> of free space (<span class="math inline"><em>ϵ</em><sub>0</sub></span>) in <a href="SI" class="uri" title="wikilink">SI</a> units as:</p>

These constants appear in <a href="Maxwell&#39;s_equations" title="wikilink">Maxwell's equations</a>, which describe <a href="electromagnetism" class="uri" title="wikilink">electromagnetism</a>, and are related by:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math display">$$c= \frac {1} {\sqrt{\varepsilon_0\mu_0}}$$</span><br /></p>
<p><a href="astronomy" title="wikilink">Astronomical</a> distances are sometimes measured in <a href="light_year" title="wikilink">light years</a> (the distance that light would travel in one year, roughly <a href="1_E15_m" title="wikilink">9.46 &lt;U+00D7&gt; 10<sup>12</sup></a> kilometres or about 5.88 &lt;U+00D7&gt; 10<sup>12</sup> miles) especially in popularised texts.</p>
<h2 id="mnemonic">Mnemonic</h2>
<p>Since a nine-digit sequence is a bit hard to remember, a useful mnemonic for <em>c</em> in m/s, that uses the letters on a telephone keypad, is: <strong>C</strong>onstant <strong>W</strong>hich <strong>W</strong>e <strong>R</strong>emember <strong>W</strong>ell <strong>B</strong>ecause <strong>I</strong>t's <strong>L</strong>ight's <strong>V</strong>elocity. Another mnemonic is, &quot;We guarantee certainty, clearly referring to this light mnemonic.&quot; (Count the letters.)</p>
<h2 id="communications">Communications</h2>
<p>The speed of light is of relevance to <a href="communication" title="wikilink">communications</a>. For example, given that the equatorial circumference of the <a href="Earth" class="uri" title="wikilink">Earth</a> is 40,075 km and <em>c</em> = 299,792 km/s, the theoretical shortest amount of time for a piece of information to travel half the globe along the surface is 0.066838 s.</p>
<p>The actual transit time is longer, in part because the speed of light is slower by about 30% in an <a href="optical_fibre" title="wikilink">optical fibre</a> and straight lines rarely occur in global communications situations, but also because delays are created when the signal passes through an electronic switch or signal regenerator. A typical time as of <a href="2004" class="uri" title="wikilink">2004</a> for an <a href="Australia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Australia</a> or <a href="Japan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Japan</a> to <a href="United_States" title="wikilink">US</a> computer-to-computer <a href="ping" class="uri" title="wikilink">ping</a> is 0.18 s. The speed of light additionally affects <a href="wireless" class="uri" title="wikilink">wireless</a> communications design.</p>
<p>The finite speed of light became quite apparent to everybody following the communication of <a href="Houston" class="uri" title="wikilink">Houston</a> <a href="ground_control" title="wikilink">ground control</a> and <a href="Neil_Armstrong" title="wikilink">Neil Armstrong</a> when he <a href="Apollo_11" title="wikilink">became the first man</a> to set foot on the <a href="Moon" class="uri" title="wikilink">Moon</a>: For every question, Houston had to wait nearly 3 <a href="second" title="wikilink">seconds</a> for the answer to arrive, and would have to do so even if the astronauts replied immediately. <em>(<a href=":Image:Speed_of_light_from_Earth_to_Moon.gif" title="wikilink">See animation</a>.)</em></p>
<p>Similarly, instantaneous remote control of an interplanetary spacecraft is impossible, in the sense that the time it takes, for example, for the earth-based controllers to become aware of a problem, plus the time it takes for the spacecraft to receive their response, can be some hours.</p>
<p>The speed of light can also be of concern on short distances. In <a href="supercomputer" title="wikilink">supercomputers</a>, the speed of light imposes a limit on how quickly data can be sent between <a href="central_processing_unit" title="wikilink">processors</a>. If a processor operates at 1 <a href="GHz" class="uri" title="wikilink">GHz</a>, a signal can only travel a maximum of 300 mm in a single cycle. Processors must therefore be placed close to each other to minimise communication latencies. If clock frequencies continue to increase, the speed of light will eventually become a limiting factor for the internal design of single <a href="integrated_circuit" title="wikilink">chips</a>.</p>
<h2 id="physics">Physics</h2>
<h3 id="constant-velocity-from-all-reference-frames">Constant velocity from all reference frames</h3>
<p>It is important to realize that the speed of light is not a &quot;<a href="speed_limit" title="wikilink">speed limit</a>&quot; in the conventional sense. An observer chasing a beam of light will measure it moving away from him at the same speed as a stationary observer. This leads to some unusual consequences for velocities.</p>
<p>Most individuals are accustomed to the addition rule of velocities: if two cars approach each other from opposite directions, each travelling at a speed of 50 <a href="kilometres_per_hour" title="wikilink">kilometres per hour</a> (31 <a href="miles_per_hour" title="wikilink">miles per hour</a>), one expects that each car will perceive the other as approaching at a combined speed of 50 + 50 = 100 km/h (62 mph) to a very high degree of accuracy.</p>
<p>At velocities at or approaching the speed of light, however, it becomes clear from experimental results that this rule does not apply. Two spaceships approaching each other, each travelling at 90% the speed of light relative to some third observer between them, do not perceive each other as approaching at 90% + 90% = 180% the speed of light; instead they each perceive the other as approaching at slightly less than 99.5% the speed of light.</p>
<p>This last result is given by the <a href="Albert_Einstein" title="wikilink">Einstein</a> <a href="velocity_addition_formula" title="wikilink">velocity addition formula</a>:</p>
<dl>

<dd><span class="math inline">$u = {v + w \over 1 + v w / c^2} \,\!$</span>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>where <span class="math inline"><em>v</em></span> and <span class="math inline"><em>w</em></span> are the speeds of the spaceships as observed by the third observer, and <span class="math inline"><em>u</em></span> is the speed of either space ship as observed by the other.</p>
<p>Contrary to one's usual intuitions, regardless of the speed at which one observer is moving relative to another observer, both will <em>measure</em> the speed of an incoming light beam as the same constant value, the speed of light.</p>
<p>The above equation was derived by <a href="Albert_Einstein" title="wikilink">Albert Einstein</a> from his theory of <a href="special_relativity" title="wikilink">special relativity</a>, which takes the <a href="principle_of_relativity" title="wikilink">principle of relativity</a> as a main premise. This principle (originally proposed by <a href="Galileo_Galilei" title="wikilink">Galileo Galilei</a>) requires physical laws to act in the same way in all <a href="reference_frame" title="wikilink">reference frames</a>. As <a href="Maxwell&#39;s_equations" title="wikilink">Maxwell's equations</a> directly give a speed of light, it should be the same for every observer—a consequence which sounded obviously wrong to the <a href="19th_century" title="wikilink">19th century</a> physicists, who assumed that the speed of light given by Maxwell's theory is valid relative to the <a href="luminiferous_aether" title="wikilink">luminiferous aether</a>. But the <a href="Michelson-Morley_experiment" title="wikilink">Michelson-Morley experiment</a>, arguably the most famous and useful failed experiment in the history of physics, could not find this aether, suggesting instead that the speed of light <em>is</em> constant in all frames of reference.</p>
<p>Although it is uncertain whether Einstein knew the results of the Michelson-Morley experiment, he took the speed of light being constant as a given fact, understood it as reaffirming Galileo's principle of relativity, and deduced the consequences, now known as the theory of <a href="special_relativity" title="wikilink">special relativity</a> which includes the counter-intuitive addition formula above.</p>

</figure>
<p>In passing through materials, light is slowed to less than <em>c</em> by the ratio called the <a href="refractive_index" title="wikilink">refractive index</a> of the material. The speed of light in <a href="Earth&#39;s_atmosphere" title="wikilink">air</a> is only slightly less than <span class="math inline"><em>c</em></span>. Denser media, such as <a href="water" class="uri" title="wikilink">water</a> and <a href="glass" class="uri" title="wikilink">glass</a>, can slow light much more, to fractions such as 3/4 and 2/3 of <em>c</em>. This reduction in speed is also responsible for bending of light at an interface between two materials with different indices, a phenomenon known as <a href="refraction" class="uri" title="wikilink">refraction</a>.</p>
<p>Since the speed of light in a material depends on the refractive index, and the refractive index depends on the frequency of the light, light at different frequencies travels at different speeds through the same material. This can cause distortion of electromagnetic waves that consist of multiple frequencies, called <a href="dispersion" class="uri" title="wikilink">dispersion</a>.</p>
<p>Note that the speed of light referred to is the <strong>observed or measured speed in some medium</strong> and not the true speed of light (as observed in vacuum). On the microscopic scale, considering electromagnetic radiation to be like a particle, refraction is caused by continual absorption and re-emission (not necessarily in quite the same direction) of the <a href="photon" title="wikilink">photons</a> that compose the light by the atoms or molecules through which it is passing. In some sense, the light itself travels only through the vacuum existing between these atoms, and is impeded by the atoms. The process of absorption and re-emission itself takes time thereby creating the impression that the light itself has undergone delay (i.e. loss of speed) between entry and exit from the medium in question. It may be noted, that once the light has emerged from the medium it changes back to its original speed and this is <em>without gaining</em> any energy. This can mean only one thing - that the light's speed itself was never altered in the first place. Alternatively, considering electromagnetic radiation to be like a wave, the charges of each atom (primarily the <a href="electron" title="wikilink">electrons</a>) <a href="interference" title="wikilink">interfere</a> with the electric and magnetic fields of the radiation, slowing its progress.</p>
<h3 id="faster-than-light-observations-and-experiments">&quot;Faster-than-light&quot; observations and experiments</h3>
<p>It has long been known theoretically that it is possible for the <a href="group_velocity" title="wikilink">group velocity</a> of light to exceed <em>c</em>. One recent experiment made the group velocity of <a href="laser" class="uri" title="wikilink">laser</a> beams travel for extremely short distances through <a href="caesium" class="uri" title="wikilink">caesium</a> atoms at 300 times <em>c</em>. However, it is not possible to use this technique to transfer <a href="information" class="uri" title="wikilink">information</a> faster than <em>c</em>: the velocity of information transfer depends on the <a href="front_velocity" title="wikilink">front velocity</a> (the speed at which the first rise of a pulse above zero moves forward) and the product of the group velocity and the front velocity is equal to the square of the normal speed of light in the material.</p>
<p>Exceeding the group velocity of light in this manner is comparable to exceeding the speed of sound by arranging people in a distantly spaced line, and asking them all to shout &quot;I'm here!&quot;, one after another with short intervals, each one timing it by looking at their own wristwatch so they don't have to wait until they hear the previous person shouting. Another example can be seen when watching ocean waves washing up on shore. With a narrow enough angle between the wave and the shoreline, the breakers travel along the wave's length much faster than the wave's movement inland.</p>
<p>The speed of light may also appear to be exceeded in some phenomena involving <a href="evanescent_waves" title="wikilink">evanescent waves</a>, such as <a href="quantum_tunneling" title="wikilink">tunnelling</a>. Experiments indicate that the <a href="phase_velocity" title="wikilink">phase velocity</a> of evanescent waves may exceed <em>c</em>; however, it would appear that neither the group velocity nor the front velocity exceed <em>c</em>, so, again, it is not possible for information to be transmitted faster than <em>c</em>.</p>
<p>In <a href="quantum_mechanics" title="wikilink">quantum mechanics</a>, certain quantum effects may be transmitted at speeds greater than <em>c</em> (indeed, <a href="action_at_a_distance_(physics)" title="wikilink">action at a distance</a> has long been perceived by some as a problem with quantum mechanics: see <a href="EPR_paradox" title="wikilink">EPR paradox</a>, <a href="interpretations_of_quantum_mechanics" title="wikilink">interpretations of quantum mechanics</a>). For example, the <a href="quantum_state" title="wikilink">quantum states</a> of two particles can be <a href="quantum_entanglement" title="wikilink">entangled</a>, so the state of one particle fixes the state of the other particle (say, one must have <a href="spin_(physics)" title="wikilink">spin</a> +&lt;U+00BD&gt; and the other must have spin &lt;U+2212&gt;&lt;U+00BD&gt;). Until the particles are observed, they exist in a <a href="quantum_superposition" title="wikilink">superposition</a> of two quantum states, (+&lt;U+00BD&gt;, &lt;U+2212&gt;&lt;U+00BD&gt;) and (&lt;U+2212&gt;&lt;U+00BD&gt;, +&lt;U+00BD&gt;). If the particles are separated and one of them is observed to determine its quantum state then the quantum state of the second particle is determined automatically. If, as in some interpretations of quantum mechanics, one presumes that the information about the quantum state is local to one particle, then one must conclude that second particle takes up its quantum state instantaneously, as soon as the first observation is carried out. However, it is impossible to control which quantum state the first particle will take on when it is observed, so no information can be transmitted in this manner. The laws of physics also appear to prevent information from being transferred through more clever ways and this has led to the formulation of rules such as the <a href="no-cloning_theorem" title="wikilink">no-cloning theorem</a> and the <a href="no-communication_theorem" title="wikilink">no-communication theorem</a>.</p>
<p>So-called <a href="superluminal_motion" title="wikilink">superluminal motion</a> is also seen in certain astronomical objects, such as the <a href="relativistic_jet" title="wikilink">jets</a> of <a href="radio_galaxy" title="wikilink">radio galaxies</a> and <a href="quasar" title="wikilink">quasars</a>. However, these jets are not actually moving at speeds in excess of the speed of light: the apparent superluminal motion is a <a href="projection" class="uri" title="wikilink">projection</a> effect caused by objects moving near the speed of light and at a small <a href="angle" class="uri" title="wikilink">angle</a> to the line of sight.</p>
<p>Although it may sound paradoxical, it is possible for <a href="shock_wave" title="wikilink">shock waves</a> to be formed with electromagnetic radiation. As a charged particle travels through an <a href="insulator" title="wikilink">insulating</a> medium, it disrupts the local electromagnetic field in the medium. Electrons in the atoms of the medium will be displaced and <a href="polarization" title="wikilink">polarised</a> by the passing field of the charged particle, and photons are emitted as the electrons in the medium restore themselves to equilibrium after the disruption has passed. (In a <a href="conductor_(material)" title="wikilink">conductor</a>, the disruption can be restored without emitting a photon.) In normal circumstances, these photons destructively interfere with each other and no radiation is detected. However, if the disruption travels faster than the photons themselves travel, the photons constructively interfere and intensify the observed radiation. The result (analogous to a <a href="sonic_boom" title="wikilink">sonic boom</a>) is known as <a href="Cherenkov_radiation" title="wikilink">Cherenkov radiation</a>.</p>
<p>The ability to communicate or travel <a href="faster-than-light" class="uri" title="wikilink">faster-than-light</a> is a popular topic in <a href="science_fiction" title="wikilink">science fiction</a>. Particles that travel faster than light, dubbed <a href="tachyon" title="wikilink">tachyons</a>, have been proposed by <a href="particle_physics" title="wikilink">particle physicists</a> but have yet to be observed.</p>
<p>Some physicists, notably <a href="Jo&lt;U+00E3&gt;o_Magueijo" title="wikilink">Jo&lt;U+00E3&gt;o Magueijo</a> and <a href="John_Moffat" title="wikilink">John Moffat</a>, have proposed that in the past light travelled much faster than the current speed of light. This theory is called <a href="variable_speed_of_light" title="wikilink">variable speed of light</a> (VSL) and its supporters claim that it has the ability to explain many <a href="cosmology" title="wikilink">cosmological</a> puzzles better than its rival, the <a href="Cosmic_inflation" title="wikilink">inflation</a> model of the <a href="universe" class="uri" title="wikilink">universe</a>. However, it has yet to gain wide acceptance.</p>
<p>In 2002, physicists Alain Hach&lt;U+00E9&gt; and Louis Poirier made history by sending pulses at three times light speed over a long distance for the first time, transmitted through a 120-metre cable made from a coaxial photonic crystal. <a href="http://physicsweb.org/articles/news/6/1/13">1</a></p>

<p>In <a href="2003" class="uri" title="wikilink">2003</a>, <a href="Mikhail_Lukin" title="wikilink">Mikhail Lukin</a>, with scientists at <a href="Harvard_University" title="wikilink">Harvard University</a> and the <a href="Lebedev_Physical_Institute" title="wikilink">Lebedev Institute</a> in <a href="Moscow" class="uri" title="wikilink">Moscow</a>, succeeded in completely halting light by directing it into a mass of hot <a href="rubidium" class="uri" title="wikilink">rubidium</a> gas, the atoms of which, in Lukin's words, behaved &quot;like tiny mirrors&quot;, due to an interference pattern in two &quot;control&quot; beams.</p>
<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<p>Until relatively recent times, the speed of light was largely a matter of conjecture. <a href="Empedocles" class="uri" title="wikilink">Empedocles</a> maintained that light was something in motion, and therefore there had to be some time elapsed in travelling. <a href="Aristotle" class="uri" title="wikilink">Aristotle</a> said that, on the contrary, &quot;light is due to the presence of something, but it is not a movement&quot;. Furthermore, if light had a finite speed, it would have to be very great; Aristotle asserted &quot;the strain upon our powers of belief is too great&quot; to believe this.</p>
<p>One of the ancient theories of vision is that light is emitted from the eye, instead of being reflected into the eye from another source. On this theory, <a href="Heron_of_Alexandria" title="wikilink">Heron of Alexandria</a> advanced the argument that the speed of light must be <a href="infinite" class="uri" title="wikilink">infinite</a>, since distant objects such as stars appear immediately when one opens one's eyes.</p>
<h3 id="medieval-and-early-modern-theories">Medieval and early modern theories</h3>
<p>The <a href="Islam" title="wikilink">Islamic</a> <a href="philosopher" title="wikilink">philosophers</a> <a href="Avicenna" class="uri" title="wikilink">Avicenna</a> and <a href="Alhazen" class="uri" title="wikilink">Alhazen</a> believed that light has a finite speed, although most philosophers agreed with <a href="Aristotle" class="uri" title="wikilink">Aristotle</a> on this point. The <a href="Indo-Aryans" title="wikilink">Indo-Aryan</a> school of philosophy in ancient India also held the speed of light to be finite. A comment on the <a href="Rig_Veda" title="wikilink">Rig Veda</a> written by the <a href="14th_century" title="wikilink">14th century</a> philosopher <a href="Sayana" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sayana</a> can be interpreted to give a value for the speed of light close to the actual value, though other interpretations are also possible (Kak 1998).</p>
<p><a href="Johannes_Kepler" title="wikilink">Johannes Kepler</a> believed that the speed of light is infinite since empty space presents no obstacle to it. <a href="Francis_Bacon_(philosopher)" title="wikilink">Francis Bacon</a> argued that the speed of light is not necessarily infinite, since something can travel too fast to be perceived. <a href="Ren&lt;U+00E9&gt;_Descartes" title="wikilink">Ren&lt;U+00E9&gt; Descartes</a> argued that if the speed of light were finite, the <a href="Sun" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sun</a>, <a href="Earth" class="uri" title="wikilink">Earth</a>, and <a href="Moon" class="uri" title="wikilink">Moon</a> would be noticeably out of alignment during a <a href="lunar_eclipse" title="wikilink">lunar eclipse</a>. Since such misalignment had not been observed, Descartes concluded the speed of light is infinite. In fact, Descartes was convinced that if the speed of light were finite, his whole system of philosophy would be demolished.</p>
<h3 id="measurement-of-the-speed-of-light">Measurement of the speed of light</h3>
<p><a href="Isaac_Beeckman" title="wikilink">Isaac Beeckman</a> proposed an experiment (<a href="1629" class="uri" title="wikilink">1629</a>) in which one would observe the flash of a <a href="cannon" class="uri" title="wikilink">cannon</a> reflecting off a <a href="mirror" class="uri" title="wikilink">mirror</a> about one mile away. <a href="Galileo_Galilei" title="wikilink">Galileo</a> proposed an experiment (1638), with an apparent claim to having performed it some years earlier, to measure the speed of light by observing the delay between uncovering a <a href="lantern" class="uri" title="wikilink">lantern</a> and its perception some distance away. <a href="Descartes" class="uri" title="wikilink">Descartes</a> criticised this experiment as superfluous, in that the observation of eclipses, which had more power to detect a finite speed, gave a negative result. This experiment was carried out by the <a href="Accademia_del_Cimento" title="wikilink">Accademia del Cimento</a> of <a href="Florence" class="uri" title="wikilink">Florence</a> in <a href="1667" class="uri" title="wikilink">1667</a>, with the lanterns separated by about one mile. No delay was observed. <a href="Robert_Hooke" title="wikilink">Robert Hooke</a> explained the negative results as Galileo had: by pointing out that such observations did not establish the infinite speed of light, but only that the speed must be very great.</p>
<p>The first quantitative estimate of the speed of light was made in <a href="1676" class="uri" title="wikilink">1676</a> by <a href="Ole_R&lt;U+00F8&gt;mer" title="wikilink">Ole R&lt;U+00F8&gt;mer</a>, who was studying the <a href="motion" title="wikilink">motions</a> of <a href="Jupiter_(planet)" title="wikilink">Jupiter</a>'s satellite <a href="Io_(moon)" title="wikilink">Io</a> with a <a href="telescope" class="uri" title="wikilink">telescope</a>. It is possible to time the <a href="orbital_revolution" title="wikilink">orbital revolution</a> of Io because it enters and exits Jupiter's shadow at regular <a href="interval_(time)" title="wikilink">intervals</a>. R&lt;U+00F8&gt;mer observed that Io revolved around Jupiter once every 42.5 <a href="hour" title="wikilink">hours</a> when <a href="Earth" class="uri" title="wikilink">Earth</a> was closest to Jupiter. He also observed that, as Earth and Jupiter moved apart, Io's exit from the shadow would begin progressively later than predicted. It was clear that these exit &quot;signals&quot; took longer to reach Earth, as Earth and Jupiter moved further apart, as a result of the extra time it took for light to cross the extra distance between the planets, which had accumulated in the interval between one signal and the next. On the basis of his observations, R&lt;U+00F8&gt;mer estimated that it would take light 22 minutes to cross the diameter of the orbit of the Earth (that is, twice the <a href="astronomical_unit" title="wikilink">astronomical unit</a>); the modern estimate is closer to 16 minutes and 40 seconds.</p>
<p>Around the same time, the astronomical unit was estimated to be about 140 million kilometres. The astronomical unit and R&lt;U+00F8&gt;mer's time estimate were combined by <a href="Christiaan_Huygens" title="wikilink">Christiaan Huygens</a>, who estimated the speed of light to be 1000 Earth diameters per minute. This is about 220,000 kilometres per second (136,000 miles per second), well below the currently accepted value, but still very much faster than any physical phenomenon then known.</p>
<p><a href="Isaac_Newton" title="wikilink">Isaac Newton</a> also accepted the finite speed. In his book &quot;<a href="Opticks" class="uri" title="wikilink">Opticks</a>&quot; he, in fact, reports the more accurate value of 16.6 Earth diameters per second, which it seems he inferred for himself (whether from R&lt;U+00F8&gt;mer's data, or otherwise, is not known). The same effect was subsequently observed by R&lt;U+00F8&gt;mer for a &quot;spot&quot; rotating with the surface of Jupiter. And later observations also showed the effect with the three other Galilean moons, where it was more difficult to observe, thus laying to rest some further objections that had been raised.</p>
<p>Even if, by these observations, the finite speed of light may not have been established to everyone's satisfaction (notably <a href="Giovanni_Domenico_Cassini" title="wikilink">Jean-Dominique Cassini</a>'s), after the observations of <a href="James_Bradley" title="wikilink">James Bradley</a> (<a href="1728" class="uri" title="wikilink">1728</a>), the hypothesis of infinite speed was considered discredited. Bradley deduced that starlight falling on the Earth should appear to come from a slight angle, which could be calculated by comparing the speed of the Earth in its orbit to the speed of light. This &quot;<a href="aberration_of_light" title="wikilink">aberration of light</a>&quot;, as it is called, was observed to be about 1/200 of a degree. Bradley calculated the speed of light as about 185,000 miles per second (298,000 kilometres per second). This is only slightly less than the currently accepted value. The aberration effect has been studied extensively over the succeeding centuries, notably by <a href="Friedrich_Georg_Wilhelm_Struve" title="wikilink">Friedrich Georg Wilhelm Struve</a> and <a href="Magnus_Nyren" title="wikilink">Magnus Nyren</a>.</p>

<p>The first successful measurement of the speed of light using an earthbound apparatus was carried out by <a href="Hippolyte_Fizeau" title="wikilink">Hippolyte Fizeau</a> in <a href="1849" class="uri" title="wikilink">1849</a>. Fizeau's experiment was conceptually similar to those proposed by Beeckman and Galileo. A beam of light was directed at a mirror several thousand metres away. On the way from the source to the mirror, the beam passed through a rotating cog wheel. At a certain rate of rotation, the beam could pass through one gap on the way out and another on the way back. But at slightly higher or lower rates, the beam would strike a tooth and not pass through the wheel. Knowing the distance to the mirror, the number of teeth on the wheel, and the rate of rotation, the speed of light could be calculated. Fizeau reported the speed of light as 313,000 kilometres per second. Fizeau's method was later refined by <a href="Marie_Alfred_Cornu" title="wikilink">Marie Alfred Cornu</a> (<a href="1872" class="uri" title="wikilink">1872</a>) and <a href="Henri_Joseph_Anastase_Perrotin" title="wikilink">Joseph Perrotin</a> (<a href="1900" class="uri" title="wikilink">1900</a>).</p>
<p><a href="Leon_Foucault" title="wikilink">Leon Foucault</a> improved on Fizeau's method by replacing the cogwheel with a rotating mirror. Foucault's estimate, published in <a href="1862" class="uri" title="wikilink">1862</a>, was 298,000 kilometres per second. Foucault's method was also used by <a href="Simon_Newcomb" title="wikilink">Simon Newcomb</a> and <a href="Albert_A._Michelson" title="wikilink">Albert A. Michelson</a>. Michelson began his lengthy career by replicating and improving on Foucault's method.</p>
<p>In <a href="1926" class="uri" title="wikilink">1926</a>, Michelson used rotating mirrors to measure the time it took light to make a round trip from <a href="Mount_Wilson_(California)" title="wikilink">Mount Wilson</a> to <a href="Mount_San_Antonio" title="wikilink">Mount San Antonio</a> in <a href="California" class="uri" title="wikilink">California</a>. The precise measurements yielded a speed of 186,285 miles per second (299,796 kilometres per second).</p>
<h3 id="relativity">Relativity</h3>
<p>From the work of <a href="James_Clerk_Maxwell" title="wikilink">James Clerk Maxwell</a>, it was known that the speed of electromagnetic radiation was a constant defined by the electromagnetic properties of the vacuum (<a href="permittivity" class="uri" title="wikilink">permittivity</a> and <a href="permeability_(electromagnetism)" title="wikilink">permeability</a>).</p>
<p><a href="image:interferometer.png" title="wikilink">thumb|right|A schematic representation of a <a href="Albert_Michelson" title="wikilink">Michelson</a> <a href="interferometer" class="uri" title="wikilink">interferometer</a>, as used for the Michelson-Morley experiment.</a></p>
<p>In <a href="1887" class="uri" title="wikilink">1887</a>, the physicists <a href="Albert_Michelson" title="wikilink">Albert Michelson</a> and <a href="Edward_Morley" title="wikilink">Edward Morley</a> performed the influential <a href="Michelson-Morley_experiment" title="wikilink">Michelson-Morley experiment</a> to measure the speed of light relative to the motion of the earth, the goal being to measure the velocity of the <a href="Earth" class="uri" title="wikilink">Earth</a> through the &quot;<a href="luminiferous_aether" title="wikilink">luminiferous aether</a>&quot;, the medium that was then thought to be necessary for the transmission of light. As shown in the diagram of a Michelson <a href="interferometer" class="uri" title="wikilink">interferometer</a>, a <a href="beam_splitter" title="wikilink">half-silvered mirror</a> was used to split a beam of <a href="monochromatic" class="uri" title="wikilink">monochromatic</a> light into two beams travelling at <a href="right_angle" title="wikilink">right angles</a> to one another. After leaving the splitter, each beam was reflected back and forth between <a href="mirror" title="wikilink">mirrors</a> several times (the same number for each beam to give a long but equal path length; the actual Michelson-Morley experiment used more <a href="mirror" title="wikilink">mirrors</a> than shown) then recombined to produce a pattern of constructive and destructive <a href="interference" class="uri" title="wikilink">interference</a>. Any slight change in speed of light along each arm of the interferometer (because the apparatus was moving with the Earth through the proposed &quot;aether&quot;) would change the amount of time that the beam spent in transit, which would then be observed as a change in the pattern of interference. In the event, the experiment gave a <a href="null_result" title="wikilink">null result</a>.</p>
<p><a href="Ernst_Mach" title="wikilink">Ernst Mach</a> was among the first physicists to suggest that the experiment actually amounted to a disproof of the <em>aether</em> theory. Developments in theoretical physics had already begun to provide an alternate theory, <a href="Lorentz-FitzGerald_contraction_hypothesis" title="wikilink">Fitzgerald-Lorentz contraction</a>, which explained the null result of the experiment.</p>
<p>It is uncertain whether <a href="Albert_Einstein" title="wikilink">Albert Einstein</a> knew the results of the Michelson-Morley experiment, but the null result of the experiment greatly assisted the acceptance of his <a href="theory_of_relativity" title="wikilink">theory of relativity</a>. Einstein's theory did not require an aether and was entirely consistent with the null result of the experiment: the <em>aether</em> did not exist and the speed of light was the same in each direction. The constant speed of light is one of the fundamental Postulates (together with <a href="causality_(physics)" title="wikilink">causality</a> and the <a href="equivalence_of_inertial_frames" title="wikilink">equivalence of inertial frames</a>) of special relativity.</p>
