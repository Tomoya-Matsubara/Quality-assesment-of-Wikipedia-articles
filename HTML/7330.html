He was director of the <a href="Georgia_Tech_Research_Institute" title="wikilink">Georgia Tech Research Institute</a> from 1957 to 1961, president of <a href="University_of_West_Georgia" title="wikilink">West Georgia College</a> from 1961 to 1971, and acting president of the <a href="Georgia_Institute_of_Technology" title="wikilink">Georgia Institute of Technology</a> from 1971 to 1972.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a><a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>A graduate of the <a href="University_of_Georgia" title="wikilink">University of Georgia</a> and <a href="Duke_University" title="wikilink">Duke University</a>, Boyd began in academia as a professor of physics at West Georgia College. He then became a professor at Georgia Tech and a prominent researcher at the Engineering Experiment Station, now known as the Georgia Tech Research Institute. At the Engineering Experiment Station, Boyd helped spur the organization's mainstay, federally funded electronics research and development. Along with fellow Georgia Tech researchers <a href="Gerald_Rosselot" title="wikilink">Gerald Rosselot</a> and <a href="Glen_P._Robinson" title="wikilink">Glen P. Robinson</a>, Boyd was influential in the founding of <a href="Scientific_Atlanta" title="wikilink">Scientific Atlanta</a>, where he was a board member for 25 years.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a><a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a><a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> As director of the Engineering Experiment Station, Boyd focused on the recruitment of talented engineers and an increase in physical space available to the organization, including the establishment of nuclear research at Georgia Tech with a <a href="radioisotope" title="wikilink">radioisotopes</a> laboratory and the construction of the <a href="Neely_Nuclear_Research_Center" title="wikilink">Frank H. Neely Research Reactor</a>.</p>
<p>While he was the third president of West Georgia College (now the University of West Georgia), Boyd increased faculty, degrees, programs, and both undergraduate and graduate enrollment on the campus. Boyd racially integrated the campus in 1963, unprompted by a court order, and oversaw immense construction projects that dramatically expanded the campus to support the increased (and future) enrollment. Hired away to serve as the <a href="University_System_of_Georgia" title="wikilink">University System of Georgia</a>'s Vice Chancellor for Academic Development in 1970, he was almost immediately reassigned to be Georgia Tech's interim president. During his tenure at Georgia Tech from 1971 to 1972, Boyd resolved difficult issues in the attempted takeover of the Engineering Experiment Station by previous Georgia Tech president <a href="Arthur_G._Hansen" title="wikilink">Arthur G.

<h3 id="engineering-experiment-station">Engineering Experiment Station</h3>
<p>Simpson's selection of Boyd as interim president was influenced by Boyd's previous experience as an academic administrator and director of the Engineering Experiment Station and Boyd's ongoing position on the station's board of directors.<a href="#fn70" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a> The chancellor hoped this combination would help resolve a brewing controversy over whether the Engineering Experiment Station should be integrated into Georgia Tech's academic units to improve both entities' competitiveness for federal money.<a href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a><a href="#fn72" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref72"><sup>72</sup></a><a href="#fn73" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref73"><sup>73</sup></a> The station had sizable and growing support from the state of Georgia and its Industrial Development Council, which developed products and methods and provided technical assistance for Georgia industry.<a href="#fn74" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref74"><sup>74</sup></a> However, due in part to efforts made by Boyd and previous station director Gerald Rosselot, the station increasingly relied on electronics research funding from the federal government.

<p><img src="James_Boyd_microphones_2.jpg" title="fig:James E. Boyd speaking to the media" alt="James E. Boyd speaking to the media" /> Boyd had to deal with intense public pressure to fire the then <a href="Georgia_Tech_Yellow_Jackets_football" title="wikilink">Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets football</a> coach, <a href="Bud_Carson" title="wikilink">Bud Carson</a>. Georgia Tech alumni, accustomed to winning seasons under football legends <a href="John_Heisman" title="wikilink">John Heisman</a> (career record 185&lt;U+2013&gt;70&lt;U+2013&gt;17), <a href="William_A._Alexander" title="wikilink">William A. Alexander</a> (134&lt;U+2013&gt;95&lt;U+2013&gt;15) and <a href="Bobby_Dodd" title="wikilink">Bobby Dodd</a> (165&lt;U+2013&gt;64&lt;U+2013&gt;8), made repeated calls for Carson's firing. The complaints were based on a long list of infractions, including &quot;mistreating and humiliating students&quot; and &quot;unsportsmanlike conduct&quot;, but the most important issue was his 27&lt;U+2013&gt;27 record. The last straw was his 6&lt;U+2013&gt;6 season record in 1971, which included both a loss to Georgia Tech's <a href="Clean,_Old-Fashioned_Hate" title="wikilink">longtime rival</a>, the <a href="Georgia_Bulldogs" title="wikilink">Georgia Bulldogs</a>, and to the <a href="Mississippi_State_Bulldogs" title="wikilink">Mississippi State Bulldogs</a> in the 1971 <a href="Peach_Bowl" title="wikilink">Peach Bowl</a>.<a href="#fn90" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref90"><sup>90</sup></a><a href="#fn91" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref91"><sup>91</sup></a> As institute president, Boyd chaired the Board of Directors of the <a href="Georgia_Tech_Athletic_Association" title="wikilink">Georgia Tech Athletic Association</a>, which had been suffering both in win percentage and in finances.<a href="#fn92" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref92"><sup>92</sup></a></p>
<p>Traditional sources of Athletic Association income, primarily ticket sales, had declined as a result of both the Yellow Jackets' poor record and the relatively recent establishment of professional football in Atlanta, namely the <a href="Atlanta_Falcons" title="wikilink">Atlanta Falcons</a>. Bobby Dodd, then <a href="athletic_director" title="wikilink">athletic director</a>, had warned for years that Georgia Tech's rising academic standards and its limited curriculum would affect the athletic program.<a href="#fn93" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref93"><sup>93</sup></a> At a meeting on January 8, 1972, the Athletic Association board, led by Boyd, ignored a 42-page list of &quot;charges&quot; drafted by an alumnus, but nevertheless voted to not renew Carson's contract, making him the first Georgia Tech coach to be fired.<a href="#fn94" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref94"><sup>94</sup></a><a href="#fn95" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref95"><sup>95</sup></a> The board also voted to not accept Bobby Dodd's resignation, which had been offered at the meeting. Carson went on to have a successful career, particularly with the <a href="Pittsburgh_Steelers" title="wikilink">Pittsburgh Steelers</a>.<a href="#fn96" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref96"><sup>96</sup></a> On January 21, 1972, Boyd announced that <a href="Bill_Fulcher" title="wikilink">Bill Fulcher</a> had been selected as the new football head coach.<a href="#fn97" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref97"><sup>97</sup></a> This would not change the Georgia Tech Athletic Association's fortunes, however; after Carson's departure, the on-field and financial problems remained.<a href="#fn98" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref98"><sup>98</sup></a></p>
