<p><strong>Keynsham</strong> () is a <a href="town" class="uri" title="wikilink">town</a> and <a href="civil_parishes_in_England" title="wikilink">civil parish</a> between <a href="Bristol" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bristol</a> and <a href="Bath,_Somerset" title="wikilink">Bath</a> in <a href="Somerset" class="uri" title="wikilink">Somerset</a>, south-west England. It has a population of 15,533.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> It was listed in the <a href="Domesday_Book" title="wikilink">Domesday Book</a> as <em>Cainesham</em>, which is believed to mean the home of <a href="Saint_Keyne" title="wikilink">Saint Keyne</a>.</p>
<p>The site of the town has been occupied since <a href="prehistoric" class="uri" title="wikilink">prehistoric</a> times and is scattered with <a href="Ancient_Rome" title="wikilink">Roman</a> remains. It became a medieval market town, after <a href="Keynsham_Abbey" title="wikilink">Keynsham Abbey</a> was founded around 1170. It is situated at the junction of confluence of the <a href="River_Chew" title="wikilink">River Chew</a> and <a href="River_Avon,_Bristol" title="wikilink">River Avon</a> and was subject to serious flooding before the creation of <a href="Chew_Valley_Lake" title="wikilink">Chew Valley Lake</a> and river level controls at <a href="Keynsham_Lock" title="wikilink">Keynsham Lock</a>. The <a href="Great_Flood_of_1968" title="wikilink">Great Flood of 1968</a> inundated large parts of the town. It was home to the <a href="Cadbury-Schweppes" title="wikilink">Cadbury's</a> chocolate factory, <a href="Somerdale_Factory" title="wikilink">Somerdale</a>, which opened in 1935 as a major employer in the town.</p>
<p>It is home to Memorial Park, which is used for the annual town festival and several nature reserves. The town is served by <a href="Keynsham_railway_station" title="wikilink">Keynsham railway station</a> on the <a href="Great_Western_Main_Line" title="wikilink">London-Bristol</a> and <a href="Wessex_Main_Line" title="wikilink">Bristol-Southampton</a> trunk routes and is close to the <a href="A4_road_(England)" title="wikilink">A4 road</a> which bypassed the town in the 1964. There are also a range of schools, religious sporting and cultural clubs and venues.</p>
<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<p>Evidence of occupation dates back to <a href="prehistoric" class="uri" title="wikilink">prehistoric</a> times, and the town site is scattered with <a href="Ancient_Rome" title="wikilink">Roman</a> remains, such as the <a href="Roman_villa" title="wikilink">Roman villas</a> at <a href="Somerdale_Factory" title="wikilink">Somerdale</a> which were discovered during the construction of the factory in 1922, and included the discovery of two stone coffins, a villa with nine intact panels of <a href="mosaic" class="uri" title="wikilink">mosaic</a> flooring at Durley Hill and a burial site between Keynsham and <a href="Saltford" class="uri" title="wikilink">Saltford</a>.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>It was listed in the <a href="Domesday_Book" title="wikilink">Domesday Book</a> of 1086 as <em>Cainesham</em>, meaning St Keyne's home. It is believed that <a href="Saint_Keyne" title="wikilink">Saint Keyne</a> lived in the 5th century. Her father was named as <a href="Brychan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Brychan</a>.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> According to local legend, St Keyne was warned by the local King that the marshy area was swarming with snakes, which prevented habitation. St Keyne prayed to the heavens and turned the snakes to stone.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> The fossil <a href="ammonite" title="wikilink">ammonites</a> found in the area were believed to be the result.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>The settlement developed into a medieval market town, its growth prompted by the foundation of the influential and prosperous <a href="Keynsham_Abbey" title="wikilink">Keynsham Abbey</a>, which had been founded by the Victorine order of <a href="Augustinian" class="uri" title="wikilink">Augustinian</a> monks around 1170. It survived until the <a href="dissolution_of_the_monasteries" title="wikilink">dissolution of the monasteries</a> in 1539, and a house was subsequently built on the site. The remains have been designated as a Grade I <a href="listed_building" title="wikilink">listed building</a> by <a href="English_Heritage" title="wikilink">English Heritage</a>.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p>Keynsham played a part in the <a href="Civil_War" title="wikilink">Civil War</a> as the <a href="Roundheads" class="uri" title="wikilink">Roundheads</a> saved the town and also camped there for the night, using the pub now known as the Lock Keeper Inn as a guard post.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> During the <a href="Monmouth_Rebellion" title="wikilink">Monmouth Rebellion</a> of 1685 the town was the site of a battle between royalist forces and the rebel <a href="Duke_of_Monmouth" title="wikilink">Duke of Monmouth</a>.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p>Before the creation of <a href="Chew_Valley_Lake" title="wikilink">Chew Valley Lake</a> and river level controls at <a href="Keynsham_Lock" title="wikilink">Keynsham Lock</a> and weir, Keynsham was prone to flooding. The <a href="Great_Flood_of_1968" title="wikilink">Great Flood of 1968</a> inundated large parts of the town, destroying the town's bridges including the county bridge over the Avon which had stood since medieval times, and private premises on Dapps Hill; the devastation was viewed by the <a href="Duke_of_Edinburgh" title="wikilink">Duke of Edinburgh</a>.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> After the flood the Memorial Park, which had been laid out after <a href="World_War_II" title="wikilink">World War II</a> was extended.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<p>Keynsham rose to fame in the mid-1960s after featuring in a long-running series of advertisements on <a href="Radio_Luxembourg_(English)" title="wikilink">Radio Luxembourg</a> for <a href="Horace_Batchelor" title="wikilink">Horace Batchelor</a>'s Infra-draw betting system.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> To obtain the system, listeners had to write to Batchelor's Keynsham post office box, and Keynsham was always painstakingly spelled out on-air, with Batchelor famously intoning &quot;Keynsham &lt;U+2013&gt; spelt K-E-Y-N-S-H-A-M &lt;U+2013&gt; Keynsham, Bristol&quot;. This was done because the proper pronunciation of Keynsham &lt;U+2013&gt; &quot;Cane-sham&quot; &lt;U+2013&gt; does not make the spelling of Keynsham immediately obvious to the radio listener.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>

Cadbury have suggested that the land be redeveloped as a mixture of housing and commercial interests, giving a figure of approximately 900 jobs being created as a result.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a></p>
<p>Before their takeover of Cadbury in February 2010, <a href="Kraft_Foods" title="wikilink">Kraft Foods</a> had pledged to keep the Cadbury factory at Somerdale open if they were successful in their bid for the company.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> However, within a week of completing their purchase of Cadbury, Kraft CEO Irene Rosenfeld released a statement announcing that Kraft were to close the factory by 2011, as originally planned by Cadbury. The stated reason for this was that it was only after the purchase had been made that Kraft realised how advanced Cadbury's plans were.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> Industry experts have however questioned this explanation, arguing that Kraft invested so much in researching their bid for Cadbury that they should have been aware of the extent to which plans had been advanced.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a></p>

It opened in 1840 and was re-named Keynsham and Somerdale in 1925. The factory had its own rail system which was connected to the mainline. The connection to Fry's chocolate factory was taken out of use on the 26&lt;U+2013&gt;27 July 1980. The station's name reverted to Keynsham on the 6 May 1974.

<h2 id="education">Education</h2>
<p>State-funded schools are organised within the <a href="Unitary_authorities_of_England" title="wikilink">unitary authority</a> of Bath and North East Somerset. A review of Secondary Education in Bath was started in 2007, primarily to reduce surplus provision and reduce the number of single-sex secondary schools in Bath, and to access capital funds available through the government's Building Schools for the Future programme.<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a> There are several primary schools in Keynsham, including St Johns primary school, Castle Primary school, Chandag infants and junior school and new school St Keyna primary school (a merge of Keynsham primary school and 150 yr old Temple Primary school).

This means the School has joined the national network of specialist schools, resulting in every school in Bath and North East Somerset now having a specialism.
