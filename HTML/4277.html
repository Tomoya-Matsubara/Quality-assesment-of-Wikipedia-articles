<p><strong><em>Black Sabbath</em></strong> () is a 1963 Italian-French <a href="horror_film" title="wikilink">horror film</a> directed by <a href="Mario_Bava" title="wikilink">Mario Bava</a>. The film is centered on three separate tales that have an introduction and conclusion from <a href="Boris_Karloff" title="wikilink">Boris Karloff</a>. The film stars an international cast in three short stories. The first, titled &quot;The Telephone&quot;, involves Suzy (<a href="Mich&lt;U+00E8&gt;le_Mercier" title="wikilink">Mich&lt;U+00E8&gt;le Mercier</a>) who continually receives threatening telephone calls from an unseen stalker. The second is &quot;The Wurdulak&quot;, where a man named Gorca (Karloff) returns to his family after claiming to have slain a Wurdulak, an undead creature who attacks those that it had once loved. The third story, &quot;The Drop of Water&quot;, features Jacqueline Pierreux as Helen Corey who steals a ring from a corpse that is being prepared for burial only to find herself haunted by the ring's original owner after arriving home.</p>
<p><em>Black Sabbath</em> follows the 1960s trend of Italian film productions being both a low budget horror and anthology film with an international cast. The film is credited to various authors but is predominantly based on several unaccredited sources. Several changes were made from to the script even after the film had gone into production. <a href="American_International_Pictures" title="wikilink">American International Pictures</a> had a member of their staff suggest changes for Mario Bava to make the film acceptable for the American target audience. The company created their own English language dub of the film that removed scenes involving violence and changed certain editing and takes used in the film. This version also greatly changed the plot of &quot;The Telephone&quot; giving it a supernatural story and removing any reference to lesbianism or prostitution.</p>
<p>A follow-up to <em>Black Sabbath</em> titled <em>Scarlet Friday</em> was originally going to be directed by Bava and star Boris Karloff. This project was never developed. Plans for a remake were announced in 2004 with <a href="Jonathan_Hensleigh" title="wikilink">Jonathan Hensleigh</a> attached to write the script. <em>Black Sabbath</em> has received favorable reviews from critics. In the early 2010s, <em><a href="Time_Out_(magazine)" title="wikilink">Time Out</a></em> magazine conducted a poll with several authors, directors, actors, and critics who have worked within the horror genre to vote for their top horror films. <em>Black Sabbath</em> placed at number 73.</p>

<p>Rosy (<a href="Michele_Mercier" title="wikilink">Michele Mercier</a>), a French call-girl returns to her basement apartment at night when she receives a series of strange phone calls. The caller soon identifies himself as Frank, her ex-pimp who has recently escaped from prison. Rosy is terrified, as it was her testimony that landed Frank in jail. Looking for solace, Rosy phones Mary (Lydia Alfonsi). The two women have been estranged, but Rosy is certain that only she can help her. Mary agrees to come over that night. Seconds later, Frank calls again, promising that no matter what Rosy does, he will have his revenge. Unknown to Rosy, Mary is the caller impersonating Frank. Mary arrives at Rosy's apartment soon after and attempts to calm Rosy's nerves and provides Mary with a large knife for protection before she goes to sleep.</p>
<p>As Rosy sleeps, Mary writes a confession that she was making the calls. Knowing that Rosy would call on her for help, she explains that she felt it was her way reuniting with her. While writing, an intruder sneaks into the apartment. This intruder is revealed to be Frank who strangles Mary. The sound of their struggle awakens Rosy as Frank realizes he just murdered the wrong woman. Frank approaches Rosy's bed as she seizes her knife and stabs Frank.

<p>In London, England, Nurse Helen Chester (Jacqueline Pierreux) is called to a large house to prepare the corpse of an elderly medium for her burial. As she dresses the body, she notices a sapphire ring on its finger. Chester steals it and accidentally tips over a glass of water which drip on the floor as she is then assailed by a fly. Chester takes her ring home to her flat and becomes assailed by strange events. The fly returns and continues to pester her and the lights in her apartment go out as the sound of the dripping water continues from various locations in the house. After seeking the source of the sound, Chester finds the woman's corpse lying in her bed, rising up and floating towards her. Chester begs for forgiveness as the body approaches her, but ultimately strangles herself. The next morning, the concierge (Harriet White Medin) discovers Chester's body and calls the police. The pathologist arrive to examine the body and only find a small bruise on her left finger where her ring once was. As the doctor makes this observation, the concierge appears distressed and begins to hear the dripping of water.</p>
