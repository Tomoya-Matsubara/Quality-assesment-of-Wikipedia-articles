<p>is a Japanese <a href="nu_metal" title="wikilink">nu metal</a>/<a href="hardcore_punk" title="wikilink">hardcore punk</a> band from <a href="Hachi&lt;U+014D&gt;ji,_Tokyo" title="wikilink">Hachi&lt;U+014D&gt;ji, Tokyo</a>. Their lineup has consisted of Daisuke-han, Nao, Maximum the Ryo-kun, and Ue-chan since 1999. Each member alternates singing lead vocals, often within the same song, with the exception of Ue-chan, who provides backup vocals almost exclusively.</p>
<p>The group is best known for their unconventional and experimental style of alternative metal music. Over their career, they have found success incorporating elements of metal, punk, hardcore, pop, and ska into their sound. Stylistically, their music runs the gamut from being dark and serious, to ironic or humorous, often with drastic shifts in tempo and mood over the course of a song. Their music videos often have a tongue-in-cheek aspect as well, such as &quot;Rolling1000t00n&quot;, which features an underdog (with the requisite karate training montage) facing up to a bully, or &quot;Koi no Mega Lover&quot;, which features an awkward young man whose clumsy amorous advances are rejected by a beautiful girl at a party.</p>

<h3 id="u20132001-formation-early-days-line-up-change-and-the-meaning-of-their-name">1998&lt;U+2013&gt;2001: Formation, early days, line-up change, and the meaning of their name</h3>
<p>Maximum the Hormone was formed in 1998 by <a href="Daisuke_Tsuda_(musician)" title="wikilink">Daisuke Tsuda</a> and <a href="Nao_Kawakita" title="wikilink">Nao Kawakita</a>.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> After a couple of regional shows, the band signed a contract with the Japanese rock label Sky Records. <em><a href="A.S.A._Crew" title="wikilink">A.S.A. Crew</a></em> was the first album released under that label and was the only full length album released with this lineup. At that time Daisuke wrote his songs only in English, and 'Maximum the Hormone' was also written in Latin letters. That changed when Key and Sugi left the band in 1999.</p>
<p>While looking for new members to join the band, Nao thought of her younger brother Ryo, who had been playing the guitar since his years in junior high school and could sing very well, too. From then on, the two men split up most of the vocals, Daisuke taking care of the screaming and rap vocals and Ryo the more melodic parts. Ue joined as well, completing the quartet as the bassist. After that major change the band decided to root their lyrics and band name in katakana to reflect the change in the band members.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> In 2001, the band released an <a href="Extended_play" title="wikilink">EP</a>, <em><a href="H&lt;U+014D&gt;" class="uri" title="wikilink">H&lt;U+014D&gt;</a></em>.</p>
<p>When asked about the group's name in an interview, <a href="Ryo_Kawakita" title="wikilink">Maximum the Ryo-kun</a> stated &quot;Take it as you like, it means anything from the Japanese cuisine for cooking animal innards to the sensation of the maximum amount of your hormones coming to the boil! Although when we go abroad people think we&lt;U+2019&gt;re just some sorta sexual energy drink.&quot;<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>&quot;Hormone&quot; (or <a href="Yakiniku#Typical_ingredients" title="wikilink">horumon</a>) is a style of <a href="yakiniku" class="uri" title="wikilink">yakiniku</a> (Japanese BBQ) where many of the typically discarded internal organs are grilled in bite sized pieces and eaten.</p>
<h3 id="u20132005-mimi-kajiru-kusoban-and-rokkinpo-goroshi">2002&lt;U+2013&gt;2005: <em>Mimi Kajiru</em>, <em>Kusoban</em> and <em>Rokkinpo Goroshi</em></h3>
<p>In 2002, the band left Sky Records and signed with Mimikajiru Records. The band released a new single, &quot;<a href="Niku_Cup" title="wikilink">Niku Cup</a>&quot;, followed by a full length album, <em><a href="Mimi_Kajiru" title="wikilink">Mimi Kajiru</a></em>.</p>
<p>After their first full album as a band, the band took a more traditional approach to recording, releasing two singles, followed by an album. Their next album, <em><a href="Kusoban" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kusoban</a></em> in 2004, was closer yet to the contrasting heavy music mixed with light pop that has gained them mainstream attention.</p>
<p>After the release of <em>Kusoban</em> on 2004, the band signed to <a href="VAP_(company)" title="wikilink">VAP</a>, a major record label.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>After recording another pair of singles, the band released another album, <em><a href="Rokkinpo_Goroshi" title="wikilink">Rokkinpo Goroshi</a></em>. The release caused a surge in their fanbase, as they began to sell out more shows, playing many rock festivals, and eventually releasing a live DVD, <em><a href="Debu_Vs._Debu" title="wikilink">Debu Vs. Debu</a></em>. In addition, &quot;Rolling1000toon&quot; was featured as an ending theme for the <em><a href="Air_Master" title="wikilink">Air Master</a></em> <a href="anime" class="uri" title="wikilink">anime</a>, as well as being featured in <a href="DrumMania_10th_Mix" title="wikilink">DrumMania 10th Mix</a> as a playable song. The song's title, is actually a play on words. Combined, the number 1000 (pronounced &quot;sen&quot;), and &quot;toon&quot; (pronounced &quot;ton&quot;) form the phrase &quot;rolling senton&quot;. A <a href="senton" class="uri" title="wikilink">senton</a> is a leaping move, in pro wrestling, that often includes somersaults. The concept is illustrated at the end of the music video, when the protagonist (bassist Ue-chan) fells the bully character by leaping into the air, doing several mid-air flips, then landing the final blow.</p>
<h3 id="u20132007-buiikikaesu-and-commercial-success">2006&lt;U+2013&gt;2007: <em>Buiikikaesu</em> and commercial success</h3>
<p>In 2006 the band entered popular culture with the song &quot;<a href="Koi_no_Mega_Lover" title="wikilink">Koi no Mega Lover</a>&quot;, which reached number nine on the <a href="Oricon" class="uri" title="wikilink">Oricon</a> charts during the summer &lt;U+2013&gt; their first top-ten hit in Japan. The band had two of their songs featured in <a href="anime" class="uri" title="wikilink">anime</a> series; &quot;<a href="What&#39;s_Up,_People?!" title="wikilink">What's Up, People?!</a>&quot; and &quot;Zetsubou Billy&quot; are featured as the opening and ending tracks, respectively, in the second season episodes of the <em><a href="Death_Note" title="wikilink">Death Note</a></em> anime series, and &quot;Akagi&quot; is featured as the ending theme for the <em><a href="Akagi_(manga)" title="wikilink">Akagi</a></em> anime series.</p>
<p>After the promotion from two singles, and the songs featured on television, Maximum the Hormone released their next album, <em><a href="Buiikikaesu" class="uri" title="wikilink">Buiikikaesu</a></em>. The album was a record for the band, debuting at number five on the Oricon charts; their first full album to rank.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> Also, in Japan the album went Gold.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>

<p>In 2008, the band released their second live DVD: <em><a href="Deco_Vs._Deco" title="wikilink">Deco Vs. Deco</a></em>, and made their first overseas appearance in a short tour through the United States and Canada in support of <a href="Dropkick_Murphys" title="wikilink">Dropkick Murphys</a>. On May 3, Maximum the Hormone performed at the <a href="hide_(musician)" title="wikilink">hide</a> memorial summit alongside many other artists, in memory of the deceased musician.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> A new single titled &quot;<a href="Tsume_Tsume_Tsume/F" title="wikilink">Tsume Tsume Tsume/&lt;U+300C&gt;F&lt;U+300D&gt;</a>&quot; containing those titular songs and &quot;Kill all the 394&quot;, was released at the start of the &quot;Tsume Tsume Tsume&quot; tour in July, and reached the number 2 spot on the Oricon weekly singles chart. The tour continued through to October 16, 2008,<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> with an additional tour finale, which took place on November 30. The subject of the song &quot;&lt;U+300C&gt;F&lt;U+300D&gt;&quot; is <em><a href="Dragon_Ball" title="wikilink">Dragon Ball</a></em> character, <a href="Freeza" class="uri" title="wikilink">Freeza</a>.</p>
<p>On October 27, Maximum The Hormone made their first UK appearance supporting <a href="Enter_Shikari" title="wikilink">Enter Shikari</a> at the <a href="Bournemouth" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bournemouth</a> BIC. They continued to tour with Enter Shikari until November 3, playing venues in <a href="Exeter" class="uri" title="wikilink">Exeter</a>, <a href="Southampton" class="uri" title="wikilink">Southampton</a> and <a href="Folkestone" class="uri" title="wikilink">Folkestone</a>, before ending with 2 nights at the <a href="London_Astoria" title="wikilink">London Astoria</a>. However, prior to the Enter Shikari dates, it was announced that Daisuke would require corrective surgery on his throat, causing the band to go on temporary hiatus while he recovered. The hiatus started in December and lasted for several months.</p>
<p>After Daisuke had recovered from his throat surgery the band went on to headline several shows in Japan with support from <a href="Bring_Me_The_Horizon" title="wikilink">Bring Me The Horizon</a> and <a href="Blessed_By_A_Broken_Heart" title="wikilink">Blessed By A Broken Heart</a> in May 2009, as well as going on to win the award for &quot;Best Rock Video&quot; for &quot;Tsume Tsume Tsume&quot; in the 2009 <a href="MTV_Video_Music_Awards_Japan" title="wikilink">MTV Video Music Awards Japan</a>.</p>
<p>On November 19, 2009, the band released a statement via their official website stating that Nao was pregnant, but after discussions with her fellow band members and staff, had decided to continue with all shows. However, on November 3 Nao fell ill and was transported to the hospital, where she was told that it would be unhealthy for her and the baby to continue performing. This resulted in the band going on hiatus until Nao had carried the baby to term and forced them to cancel all shows including an appearance at the <a href="Soundwave_(Australian_music_festival)" title="wikilink">Soundwave Festival</a> 2010 in Australia.</p>
<p>On May 6, 2010, the band released another statement through their website stating that Nao gave birth to a healthy baby girl and that they would no longer be on hiatus. The band members appeared as <a href="Extra_(actor)" title="wikilink">extras</a> in the live-action adaptation of <em><a href="Beck_(manga)" title="wikilink">BECK</a></em>.</p>
<p>Notably, in 2009, <a href="Megadeth" class="uri" title="wikilink">Megadeth</a> guitarist <a href="Marty_Friedman" title="wikilink">Marty Friedman</a> performed an instrumental cover of Tsume Tsume Tsume on his tribute/cover album <a href="Tokyo_Jukebox" title="wikilink">Tokyo Jukebox</a>. Though not mentioned in the title, near the end of the track, he segues into an abbreviated version of Maximum the Hormone's Louisiana Bob.</p>

<p>Later in February 7, 2011, the band released a video for the songs &quot;Chiisana Kimi no Te (&lt;U+5C0F&gt;&lt;U+3055&gt;&lt;U+306A&gt;&lt;U+541B&gt;&lt;U+306E&gt;&lt;U+624B&gt;)&quot; - translates to &quot;Your Little Hands&quot; - and &quot;maximum the hormone&quot; on their official website.</p>
<p>The band's single titled &quot;<a href="Greatest_the_Hits_2011&lt;U+2013&gt;2011" title="wikilink">Greatest the Hits 2011&lt;U+2013&gt;2011</a>&quot; was released on March 23, debuting at number 1 spot on the Oricon weekly singles chart. In June they will be touring Europe. In early August they played at Pentaport Rock Festival in Incheon, South Korea.</p>
<p>Their newest album <em><a href="Yoshu_Fukushu" title="wikilink">Yoshu Fukushu</a></em> was released on July 31, 2013, their first full album in 6 years. It was their first album to reach number one on Oricon's charts the week after its release.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> The CD features unique packaging, as it is approximately the height and width of a standard DVD case, and bound like a manga. According to the band's official website, it is &quot;A frantic 156-page book with &quot;Our Merciless Home'war'k&quot; descriptions, a dialogue style track-by-track rundown for all 15 songs by Maximum The Ryo-kun, Ryo-kun's inner world is exposed by professional manga artists&quot;<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<p>On June 2, the group released the video for the song &quot;A-L-I-E-N&quot;, but as a prank, they placed it on a randomly relocating URL, so page visitors would only have a random chance of seeing the video, depending on luck. The music video for the album's title track, &quot;Yoshu Fukushu&quot;, was released on July 26, 2013.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> In 2011, prior to release, the album track &quot;Benjo Sandal Dance&quot; (Toilet Sandal Dance) was used in a Stride gum commercial, &quot;Evolution Rock&quot;, featuring the band in full special effects makeup as early primates.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> In keeping with the band's quirky aesthetic, the song Benjo Sandal Dance lyrically references Maximum the Ryo-kun's habit of wearing <a href="Toilet_slippers" title="wikilink">toilet sandals</a>, traditionally strictly only for wearing in the bathroom, at all times. As referenced in the song's lyrics, as well as their FAQ, he exclusively wears toilet sandals sold under the brand name VIC, made by Nishibe Chemical Co. Ltd. Dunhill.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> In September, the band announced a special merchandise package, including both a t-shirt, and limited edition VIC sandals with the Maximum the Hormone logo stamped in the heel.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="musical-style">Musical Style</h2>
<p>Maximum the Hormone performs <a href="nu_metal" title="wikilink">nu metal</a> and <a href="hardcore_punk" title="wikilink">hardcore punk</a> but incorporates many elements of <a href="Pop_music" title="wikilink">pop</a>,<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> <a href="Funk_music" title="wikilink">funk</a>, <a href="ska" class="uri" title="wikilink">ska</a> and <a href="extreme_metal" title="wikilink">extreme metal</a> into their music as well which helps to distinguish them from many typical nu metal and hardcore punk bands. <a href="Allmusic" class="uri" title="wikilink">Allmusic</a>'s Alexey Eremenko writes that Maximum the Hormone is distinguished by &quot;a general lack of the teenage angst and self-importance characteristic of true nu-metalers&quot;. Their funky sound, heard in many songs such as &quot;Maximum 21st Century&quot;, is mostly produced by bass player Ue-Chan using the slapping technique, often referred to as &quot;The Chopper&quot; by the band (both in their FAQ, and their song A-L-I-E-N). <a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
