<p>In 1998, Moulds led all <a href="American_Football_Conference" title="wikilink">AFC</a> receivers with 1,368 receiving yards.</p>
<p>In the <a href="NFL_playoffs,_1998-99" title="wikilink">playoffs</a> Moulds had a record breaking 240 yard performance against the <a href="Miami_Dolphins" title="wikilink">Miami Dolphins</a>, though he lost a fumble on the Bills' first play, a 65-yard pass from Flutie. Buffalo lost 24-17.</p>
<p>Since then, Moulds established himself as one of the premier receivers in football, amassing 675 career receptions (as of the end of 2005) and has been selected to three <a href="Pro_Bowl" title="wikilink">Pro Bowls</a>.</p>
<p>Making this the Bills number one wide receiver for a number of years, and also taught the fast young talent <a href="Lee_Evans" title="wikilink">Lee Evans</a> when he first came into the NFL.</p>
<h3 id="houston-texans">Houston Texans</h3>

<p>On February 28, 2007, Moulds was released from the Texans after a disappointing <a href="2006_NFL_season" title="wikilink">2006 season</a>. After his release, Moulds criticized then-Texans QB <a href="David_Carr" title="wikilink">David Carr</a> by saying &quot;The quarterback has to show that he can carry (the team).&quot;</p>
<h3 id="tennessee-titans">Tennessee Titans</h3>

That season, he played in all 16 games, having the 4th most receptions on his team, 2nd most by wide receivers, with 32 catches for 342 yards.</p>
<p>Moulds was released after the 2007 - 2008 season. He had a workout with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in May 2008 without being picked up by them. It would appear his NFL career has come to an end after 12 years.</p>
