<p><strong>Edward VI</strong> (12 October 1537 &lt;U+2013&gt; 6 July 1553) was <a href="List_of_English_monarchs" title="wikilink">King of England</a> and <a href="Monarchy_of_Ireland" title="wikilink">Ireland</a> from 28 January 1547 until his death. He was crowned on 20 February at the age of nine.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> The son of <a href="Henry_VIII_of_England" title="wikilink">Henry VIII</a> and <a href="Jane_Seymour" title="wikilink">Jane Seymour</a>, Edward was the third monarch of the <a href="Tudor_dynasty" title="wikilink">Tudor dynasty</a> and England's first monarch raised as a Protestant. During Edward's reign, the realm was governed by a <a href="Regent" title="wikilink">Regency Council</a> because he never reached his majority. The Council was first led by his uncle <a href="Edward_Seymour,_1st_Duke_of_Somerset" title="wikilink">Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset</a>, (1547&lt;U+2013&gt;1549), and then by <a href="John_Dudley,_1st_Duke_of_Northumberland" title="wikilink">John Dudley, 1st Earl of Warwick</a>, from 1551 <a href="Duke_of_Northumberland" title="wikilink">Duke of Northumberland</a>.</p>
<p>Edward's reign was marked by economic problems and social unrest that, in 1549, erupted into riot and rebellion. An expensive war with <a href="Kingdom_of_Scotland" title="wikilink">Scotland</a>, at first successful, ended with military withdrawal from Scotland as well as <a href="Boulogne-sur-Mer" class="uri" title="wikilink">Boulogne-sur-Mer</a> in exchange for peace. The transformation of the Church into a recognisably Protestant body also occurred under Edward, who took great interest in religious matters. Although his father, Henry VIII, had severed the link between the <a href="Church_of_England" title="wikilink">Church of England</a> and <a href="Roman_Catholic_Church" title="wikilink">Rome</a>, Henry VIII had never permitted the renunciation of Catholic doctrine or ceremony. It was during Edward's reign that Protestantism was <a href="established_church" title="wikilink">established</a> for the first time in England with reforms that included the abolition of <a href="clerical_celibacy" title="wikilink">clerical celibacy</a> and the <a href="Mass_(liturgy)" title="wikilink">Mass</a> and the imposition of compulsory services in English. The architect of these reforms was <a href="Thomas_Cranmer" title="wikilink">Thomas Cranmer</a>, <a href="Archbishop_of_Canterbury" title="wikilink">Archbishop of Canterbury</a>, whose <em><a href="Book_of_Common_Prayer" title="wikilink">Book of Common Prayer</a></em> is still used.</p>
<p>In February 1553, at age 15, Edward fell ill. When his sickness was discovered to be terminal, he and his Council drew up a &quot;Devise for the Succession,&quot; attempting to prevent the country's return to Catholicism. Edward named his cousin, <a href="Lady_Jane_Grey" title="wikilink">Lady Jane Grey</a>, as his heir and excluded his half-sisters, <a href="Mary_I_of_England" title="wikilink">Mary</a> and <a href="Elizabeth_I_of_England" title="wikilink">Elizabeth</a>. However, this decision was disputed following Edward's death, and Jane was deposed by Mary within 13 days. As queen, Mary reversed Edward's Protestant reforms, which nonetheless became the basis of the <a href="Elizabethan_Religious_Settlement" title="wikilink">Elizabethan Religious Settlement</a> of 1559.</p>

<p>Edward was a healthy baby who suckled strongly from the outset. His father was delighted with him; in May 1538, Henry was observed &quot;dallying with him in his arms ... and so holding him in a window to the sight and great comfort of the people&quot;.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> That September, the Lord Chancellor, <a href="Thomas_Audley,_1st_Baron_Audley_of_Walden" title="wikilink">Thomas, Lord Audley</a>, reported Edward's rapid growth and vigour;<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> and other accounts describe him as a tall and merry child. The tradition that Edward VI was a sickly boy has been challenged by more recent historians.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> At the age of four, he fell ill with a life-threatening &quot;<a href="quartan_fever" title="wikilink">quartan fever</a>&quot;,<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> but, despite occasional illnesses and poor eyesight, he enjoyed generally good health until the last six months of his life.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<p>Edward was initially placed in the care of <a href="Margaret_Bryan" title="wikilink">Margaret Bryan</a>, &quot;lady mistress&quot; of the prince's household. She was succeeded by Blanche Herbert, <a href="Lady_Troy" title="wikilink">Lady Troy</a>. Until the age of six, Edward was brought up, as he put it later in his <em>Chronicle</em>, &quot;among the women&quot;.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> The formal royal household established around Edward was, at first, under <a href="Sir_William_Sidney" title="wikilink">Sir William Sidney</a>, and later Sir Richard Page, stepfather of <a href="Edward_Seymour,_1st_Duke_of_Somerset" title="wikilink">Edward Seymour</a>'s wife, <a href="Anne_Stanhope" title="wikilink">Anne Stanhope</a>. Henry demanded exacting standards of security and cleanliness in his son's household, stressing that Edward was &quot;this whole realm's most precious jewel&quot;.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> Visitors described the prince, who was lavishly provided with toys and comforts, including his own troupe of <a href="minstrel" title="wikilink">minstrels</a>, as a contented child.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
<p>From the age of six, Edward began his formal education under <a href="Richard_Cox_(bishop)" title="wikilink">Richard Cox</a> and <a href="John_Cheke" title="wikilink">John Cheke</a>, concentrating, as he recalled himself, on &quot;learning of tongues, of the scripture, of philosophy, and all liberal sciences&quot;;<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> He received tuition from Elizabeth's tutor, <a href="Roger_Ascham" title="wikilink">Roger Ascham</a>, and <a href="Jean_Belmain" title="wikilink">Jean Belmain</a>, learning French, Spanish and Italian. In addition, he is known to have studied <a href="geometry" class="uri" title="wikilink">geometry</a> and learned to play musical instruments, including the <a href="lute" class="uri" title="wikilink">lute</a> and the <a href="virginals" class="uri" title="wikilink">virginals</a>. He collected globes and maps and, according to coinage historian C. E. Challis, developed a grasp of monetary affairs that indicated a high intelligence. Edward's religious education is assumed to have favoured the reforming agenda.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> His religious establishment was probably chosen by <a href="Thomas_Cranmer" title="wikilink">Archbishop Thomas Cranmer</a>, a leading reformer. Both Cox and Cheke were &quot;reformed&quot; Catholics or <a href="Desiderius_Erasmus" title="wikilink">Erasmians</a> and later became <a href="Marian_exiles" title="wikilink">Marian exiles</a>. By 1549, Edward had written a <a href="treatise" class="uri" title="wikilink">treatise</a> on the pope as <a href="Antichrist" class="uri" title="wikilink">Antichrist</a> and was making informed notes on theological controversies.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> Many aspects of Edward's religion were essentially Catholic in his early years, including celebration of the <a href="Mass_(liturgy)" title="wikilink">mass</a> and reverence for images and relics of the saints.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a></p>

The following spring, he restored them to their place in the succession with a <a href="Third_Succession_Act" title="wikilink">Third Succession Act</a>, which also provided for a regency council during Edward's minority.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> This unaccustomed family harmony may have owed much to the influence of Henry's new wife <a href="Catherine_Parr" title="wikilink">Catherine Parr</a>,<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> of whom Edward soon became fond. He called her his &quot;most dear mother&quot; and in September 1546, wrote to her: &quot;I received so many benefits from you that my mind can hardly grasp them&quot;.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a></p>
<p>Other children were brought to play with Edward, including the granddaughter of Edward's chamberlain, Sir William Sidney, who in adulthood recalled the prince as &quot;a marvellous sweet child, of very mild and generous condition&quot;.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> Edward was educated with sons of nobles, &quot;appointed to attend upon him&quot; in what was a form of miniature court.

Edward's surroundings and possessions were regally splendid: his rooms were hung with costly Flemish <a href="tapestries" class="uri" title="wikilink">tapestries</a>, and his clothes, books, and cutlery were encrusted with precious jewels and gold.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> Like his father, Edward was fascinated by military arts, and many of his portraits show him wearing a gold dagger with a jewelled hilt, in imitation of Henry.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> Edward's <em>Chronicle</em> enthusiastically details English military campaigns against Scotland and France, and adventures such as <a href="John_Dudley,_1st_Duke_of_Northumberland" title="wikilink">John Dudley</a>'s near capture at <a href="Musselburgh" class="uri" title="wikilink">Musselburgh</a> in 1547.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a></p>

<p>On 1 July 1543, Henry VIII signed the <a href="Treaty_of_Greenwich" title="wikilink">Treaty of Greenwich</a> with the Scots, sealing the peace with Edward's <a href="betrothal" class="uri" title="wikilink">betrothal</a> to the seven-month-old <a href="Mary,_Queen_of_Scots" title="wikilink">Mary, Queen of Scots</a>.

In March 1547, he secured <a href="letters_patent" title="wikilink">letters patent</a> from King Edward granting him the almost monarchical right to appoint members to the Privy Council himself and to consult them only when he wished.<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a> In the words of historian <a href="Geoffrey_Elton" title="wikilink">G.

<p>Somerset's takeover of power was smooth and efficient.

<p>Somerset faced less manageable opposition from his younger brother <a href="Thomas_Seymour,_1st_Baron_Seymour_of_Sudeley" title="wikilink">Thomas Seymour</a>, who has been described as a &quot;worm in the bud&quot;.<a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a> As King Edward's uncle, Thomas Seymour demanded the governorship of the king's person and a greater share of power.<a href="#fn69" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref69"><sup>69</sup></a> Somerset tried to buy his brother off with a <a href="baron" title="wikilink">barony</a>, an appointment to the <a href="Admiralty" title="wikilink">Lord Admiralship</a>, and a seat on the Privy Council&lt;U+2014&gt;but Thomas was bent on scheming for power. He began smuggling pocket money to King Edward, telling him that Somerset held the purse strings too tight, making him a &quot;beggarly king&quot;.<a href="#fn70" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a> He also urged him to throw off the Protector within two years and &quot;bear rule as other kings do&quot;; but Edward, schooled to defer to the Council, failed to co-operate.<a href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a> In the Spring of 1547, using Edward's support to circumvent Somerset's opposition, Thomas Seymour secretly married Henry VIII's widow <a href="Catherine_Parr" title="wikilink">Catherine Parr</a>, whose Protestant household included the 11-year-old <a href="Lady_Jane_Grey" title="wikilink">Lady Jane Grey</a> and the 13-year-old <a href="Elizabeth_I_of_England" title="wikilink">Lady Elizabeth</a>.<a href="#fn72" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref72"><sup>72</sup></a></p>

Elizabeth was receptive, but, like Edward, unready to agree to anything unless permitted by the Council.<a href="#fn74" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref74"><sup>74</sup></a> In January 1549, the Council had Thomas Seymour arrested on various charges, including <a href="embezzlement" class="uri" title="wikilink">embezzlement</a> at the Bristol <a href="mint_(coin)" title="wikilink">mint</a>.

<h3 id="war">War</h3>
<p>Somerset's only undoubted skill was as a soldier, which he had proven on expeditions to Scotland and in the defence of <a href="Boulogne-sur-Mer" class="uri" title="wikilink">Boulogne-sur-Mer</a> in 1546. From the first, his main interest as Protector was the war against Scotland.<a href="#fn77" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref77"><sup>77</sup></a> After a crushing victory at the <a href="Battle_of_Pinkie_Cleugh" title="wikilink">Battle of Pinkie Cleugh</a> in September 1547, he set up a network of garrisons in Scotland, stretching as far north as <a href="Dundee" class="uri" title="wikilink">Dundee</a>.<a href="#fn78" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref78"><sup>78</sup></a> His initial successes, however, were followed by a loss of direction, as his aim of uniting the realms through conquest became increasingly unrealistic. The Scots allied with France, who sent reinforcements for the defence of Edinburgh in 1548,<a href="#fn79" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref79"><sup>79</sup></a> while <a href="Mary,_Queen_of_Scots" title="wikilink">Mary, Queen of Scots</a>, was removed to France, where she was betrothed to the <a href="Dauphin_of_France" title="wikilink">dauphin</a>.<a href="#fn80" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref80"><sup>80</sup></a> The cost of maintaining the Protector's massive armies and his permanent garrisons in Scotland also placed an unsustainable burden on the royal finances.<a href="#fn81" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref81"><sup>81</sup></a> A French attack on Boulogne in August 1549 at last forced Somerset to begin a withdrawal from Scotland.<a href="#fn82" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref82"><sup>82</sup></a></p>

<p>During 1548, England was subject to social unrest. After April 1549, a series of armed revolts broke out, fuelled by various religious and agrarian grievances. The two most serious rebellions, which required major military intervention to put down, were in Devon and Cornwall and in Norfolk. The first, sometimes called the <a href="Prayer_Book_Rebellion" title="wikilink">Prayer Book Rebellion</a>, arose mainly from the imposition of church services in English, and the second, led by a tradesman called <a href="Kett&#39;s_Rebellion" title="wikilink">Robert Kett</a>, mainly from the encroachment of landlords on common grazing ground.<a href="#fn83" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref83"><sup>83</sup></a> A complex aspect of the social unrest was that the protesters believed they were acting legitimately against <a href="enclosure" title="wikilink">enclosing</a> landlords with the Protector's support, convinced that the landlords were the lawbreakers.<a href="#fn84" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref84"><sup>84</sup></a></p>
<p>The same justification for outbreaks of unrest was voiced throughout the country, not only in Norfolk and the west. The origin of the popular view of Somerset as sympathetic to the rebel cause lies partly in his series of sometimes liberal, often contradictory, proclamations,<a href="#fn85" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref85"><sup>85</sup></a> and partly in the uncoordinated activities of the commissions he sent out in 1548 and 1549 to investigate grievances about loss of tillage, encroachment of large sheep flocks on <a href="common_land" title="wikilink">common land</a>, and similar issues.<a href="#fn86" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref86"><sup>86</sup></a> Somerset's commissions were led by an evangelical M.P. called <a href="John_Hales_(MP)" title="wikilink">John Hales</a>, whose socially liberal rhetoric linked the issue of enclosure with Reformation theology and the notion of a godly <a href="commonwealth" class="uri" title="wikilink">commonwealth</a>.<a href="#fn87" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref87"><sup>87</sup></a> Local groups often assumed that the findings of these commissions entitled them to act against offending landlords themselves.<a href="#fn88" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref88"><sup>88</sup></a> King Edward wrote in his <em>Chronicle</em> that the 1549 risings began &quot;because certain commissions were sent down to pluck down enclosures&quot;.<a href="#fn89" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref89"><sup>89</sup></a></p>
<p>Whatever the popular view of Somerset, the disastrous events of 1549 were taken as evidence of a colossal failure of government, and the Council laid the responsibility at the Protector's door.<a href="#fn90" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref90"><sup>90</sup></a> In July 1549, Paget wrote to Somerset: &quot;Every man of the council have misliked your proceedings ... would to God, that, at the first stir you had followed the matter hotly, and caused justice to be ministered in solemn fashion to the terror of others ...&quot;.<a href="#fn91" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref91"><sup>91</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="fall-of-somerset">Fall of Somerset</h3>
<p>The sequence of events that led to Somerset's removal from power has often been called a <em>coup d'&lt;U+00E9&gt;tat</em>.<a href="#fn92" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref92"><sup>92</sup></a> By 1 October 1549, Somerset had been alerted that his rule faced a serious threat. He issued a proclamation calling for assistance, took possession of the king's person, and withdrew for safety to the fortified <a href="Windsor_Castle" title="wikilink">Windsor Castle</a>, where Edward wrote, &quot;Me thinks I am in prison&quot;.<a href="#fn93" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref93"><sup>93</sup></a> Meanwhile, a united Council published details of Somerset's government mismanagement. They made clear that the Protector's power came from them, not from Henry VIII's will. On 11 October, the Council had Somerset arrested and brought the king to <a href="Richmond_Palace" title="wikilink">Richmond</a>.<a href="#fn94" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref94"><sup>94</sup></a> Edward summarised the charges against Somerset in his <em>Chronicle</em>: &quot;ambition, vainglory, entering into rash wars in mine youth, negligent looking on Newhaven, enriching himself of my treasure, following his own opinion, and doing all by his own authority, etc.&quot;<a href="#fn95" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref95"><sup>95</sup></a> In February 1550, <a href="John_Dudley,_1st_Duke_of_Northumberland" title="wikilink">John Dudley, Earl of Warwick</a>, emerged as the leader of the Council and, in effect, as Somerset's successor. Although Somerset was released from the Tower and restored to the Council, he was executed for <a href="felony" class="uri" title="wikilink">felony</a> in January 1552 after scheming to overthrow Dudley's regime.<a href="#fn96" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref96"><sup>96</sup></a> Edward noted his uncle's death in his <em>Chronicle</em>: &quot;the duke of Somerset had his head cut off upon Tower Hill between eight and nine o'clock in the morning&quot;.<a href="#fn97" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref97"><sup>97</sup></a></p>
<p>Historians contrast the efficiency of Somerset's takeover of power, in which they detect the organising skills of allies such as Paget, the &quot;master of practices&quot;, with the subsequent ineptitude of his rule.<a href="#fn98" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref98"><sup>98</sup></a> By autumn 1549, his costly wars had lost momentum, the crown faced financial ruin, and riots and rebellions had broken out around the country. Until recent decades, Somerset's reputation with historians was high, in view of his many proclamations that appeared to back the common people against a rapacious landowning class.<a href="#fn99" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref99"><sup>99</sup></a> More recently, however, he has often been portrayed as an arrogant and aloof ruler, lacking in political and administrative skills.<a href="#fn100" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref100"><sup>100</sup></a></p>

<p>In contrast, Somerset's successor <a href="John_Dudley,_1st_Duke_of_Northumberland" title="wikilink">John Dudley, Earl of Warwick</a>, made <a href="Duke_of_Northumberland" title="wikilink">Duke of Northumberland</a> in 1551, was once regarded by historians merely as a grasping schemer who cynically elevated and enriched himself at the expense of the crown.<a href="#fn101" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref101"><sup>101</sup></a> Since the 1970s, the administrative and economic achievements of his regime have been recognised, and he has been credited with restoring the authority of the royal Council and returning the government to an even keel after the disasters of Somerset's protectorate.<a href="#fn102" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref102"><sup>102</sup></a></p>
<p>The Earl of Warwick's rival for leadership of the new regime was <a href="Thomas_Wriothesley,_1st_Earl_of_Southampton" title="wikilink">Thomas Wriothesley, 1st Earl of Southampton</a>, whose conservative supporters had allied with Dudley's followers to create a unanimous Council, which they, and observers such as the Holy Roman Emperor, <a href="Charles_V,_Holy_Roman_Emperor" title="wikilink">Charles V</a>'s ambassador, expected to reverse Somerset's policy of religious reform.<a href="#fn103" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref103"><sup>103</sup></a> Warwick, on the other hand, pinned his hopes on the king's strong Protestantism and, claiming that Edward was old enough to rule in person, moved himself and his people closer to the king, taking control of the Privy Chamber.<a href="#fn104" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref104"><sup>104</sup></a> Paget, accepting a barony, joined Warwick when he realised that a conservative policy would not bring the emperor onto the English side over Boulogne.<a href="#fn105" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref105"><sup>105</sup></a> Southampton prepared a case for executing Somerset, aiming to discredit Warwick through Somerset's statements that he had done all with Warwick's co-operation. As a counter-move, Warwick convinced parliament to free Somerset, which it did on 14 January 1550. Warwick then had Southampton and his followers purged from the Council after winning the support of Council members in return for titles, and was made <a href="Lord_President_of_the_Council" title="wikilink">Lord President of the Council</a> and great master of the king's household.<a href="#fn106" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref106"><sup>106</sup></a> Although not called a Protector, he was now clearly the head of the government.<a href="#fn107" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref107"><sup>107</sup></a></p>
<p>As Edward was growing up, he was able to understand more and more government business. However, his actual involvement in decisions has long been a matter of debate, and during the 20th century, historians have presented the whole gamut of possibilities, &quot;balanc[ing] an articulate puppet against a mature, precocious, and essentially adult king&quot;, in the words of Stephen Alford.<a href="#fn108" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref108"><sup>108</sup></a> A special &quot;Counsel for the Estate&quot; was created when Edward was fourteen. Edward chose the members himself.<a href="#fn109" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref109"><sup>109</sup></a> In the weekly meetings with this Council, Edward was &quot;to hear the debating of things of most importance&quot;.<a href="#fn110" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref110"><sup>110</sup></a> A major point of contact with the king was the Privy Chamber, and there Edward worked closely with <a href="William_Cecil,_1st_Baron_Burghley" title="wikilink">William Cecil</a> and <a href="William_Petre" title="wikilink">William Petre</a>, the <a href="Secretary_of_State_(England)" title="wikilink">Principal Secretaries</a>.<a href="#fn111" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref111"><sup>111</sup></a> The king's greatest influence was in matters of religion, where the Council followed the strongly Protestant policy that Edward favoured.<a href="#fn112" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref112"><sup>112</sup></a></p>
<p>The Duke of Northumberland's mode of operation was very different from Somerset's. Careful to make sure he always commanded a majority of councillors, he encouraged a working council and used it to legitimatise his authority. Lacking Somerset's blood-relationship with the king, he added members to the Council from his own faction in order to control it. He also added members of his family to the royal household.<a href="#fn113" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref113"><sup>113</sup></a> He saw that to achieve personal dominance, he needed total procedural control of the Council.<a href="#fn114" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref114"><sup>114</sup></a> In the words of historian <a href="John_Guy_(historian)" title="wikilink">John Guy</a>, &quot;Like Somerset, he became quasi-king; the difference was that he managed the bureaucracy on the pretence that Edward had assumed full sovereignty, whereas Somerset had asserted the right to near-sovereignty as Protector&quot;.<a href="#fn115" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref115"><sup>115</sup></a></p>
<p><img src="King_Edward_VI_shilling.jpg" title="fig:Shilling with portrait of Edward VI, struck 1551-1553" alt="Shilling with portrait of Edward VI, struck 1551-1553" width="310" /> Warwick's war policies were more pragmatic than Somerset's, and they have earned him criticism for weakness. In 1550, he signed a peace treaty with France that agreed to withdrawal from Boulogne and recalled all English garrisons from Scotland. In 1551, Edward was betrothed to <a href="Elisabeth_of_Valois" title="wikilink">Elisabeth of Valois</a>, <a href="Henry_II_of_France" title="wikilink">King Henry II</a>'s daughter.<a href="#fn116" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref116"><sup>116</sup></a> In practice, he realised that England could no longer support the cost of wars.<a href="#fn117" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref117"><sup>117</sup></a> At home, he took measures to police local unrest. To forestall future rebellions, he kept permanent representatives of the crown in the localities, including <a href="lord_lieutenant" title="wikilink">lords lieutenant</a>, who commanded military forces and reported back to central government.<a href="#fn118" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref118"><sup>118</sup></a></p>
<p>Working with <a href="William_Paulet,_1st_Marquess_of_Winchester" title="wikilink">William Paulet</a> and <a href="Walter_Mildmay" title="wikilink">Walter Mildmay</a>, Warwick tackled the disastrous state of the kingdom's finances.<a href="#fn119" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref119"><sup>119</sup></a> However, his regime first succumbed to the temptations of a quick profit by further <a href="debasement" title="wikilink">debasing</a> the coinage.<a href="#fn120" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref120"><sup>120</sup></a> The economic disaster that resulted caused Warwick to hand the initiative to the expert <a href="Thomas_Gresham" title="wikilink">Thomas Gresham</a>. By 1552, confidence in the coinage was restored, prices fell, and trade at last improved. Though a full economic recovery was not achieved until Elizabeth's reign, its origins lay in the Duke of Northumberland's policies.<a href="#fn121" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref121"><sup>121</sup></a> The regime also cracked down on widespread embezzlement of government finances, and carried out a thorough review of revenue collection practices, which has been called &quot;one of the more remarkable achievements of Tudor administration&quot;.<a href="#fn122" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref122"><sup>122</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="reformation">Reformation</h2>
<p>In the matter of religion, the regime of Northumberland followed the same policy as that of Somerset, supporting an increasingly vigorous programme of reform.<a href="#fn123" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref123"><sup>123</sup></a> Although Edward VI's practical influence on government was limited, his intense Protestantism made a reforming administration obligatory; his succession was managed by the reforming faction, who continued in power throughout his reign. The man Edward trusted most, <a href="Thomas_Cranmer" title="wikilink">Thomas Cranmer</a>, Archbishop of Canterbury, introduced a series of religious reforms that revolutionised the English church from one that&lt;U+2014&gt;while rejecting papal supremacy&lt;U+2014&gt;remained essentially Catholic, to one that was institutionally Protestant. The confiscation of church property that had begun under Henry VIII resumed under Edward&lt;U+2014&gt;notably with the dissolution of the <a href="chantries" class="uri" title="wikilink">chantries</a>&lt;U+2014&gt;to the great monetary advantage of the crown and the new owners of the seized property.<a href="#fn124" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref124"><sup>124</sup></a> Church reform was therefore as much a political as a religious policy under Edward VI.<a href="#fn125" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref125"><sup>125</sup></a> By the end of his reign, the church had been financially ruined, with much of the property of the bishops transferred into lay hands.<a href="#fn126" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref126"><sup>126</sup></a></p>

<p>It was now common knowledge that Edward was dying, and foreign diplomats suspected that some scheme to debar Mary was under way.

<h3 id="illness-and-death">Illness and death</h3>
<p>Edward became ill during January 1553 with a fever and cough that gradually worsened. The imperial ambassador, <a href="Jean_Scheyfve" title="wikilink">Scheyfve</a>, reported that &quot;he suffers a good deal when the fever is upon him, especially from a difficulty in drawing his breath, which is due to the compression of the organs on the right side&quot;.<a href="#fn176" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref176"><sup>176</sup></a> Edward felt well enough in early April to take the air in the park at Westminster and to move to Greenwich, but by the end of the month he had weakened again. By 7 May he was &quot;much amended,&quot; and the royal doctors had no doubt of his recovery. A few days later the king was watching the ships on the Thames, sitting at his window.<a href="#fn177" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref177"><sup>177</sup></a> However, he relapsed, and on 11 June Scheyfve, who had an informant in the king's household, reported that &quot;the matter he ejects from his mouth is sometimes coloured a greenish yellow and black, sometimes pink, like the colour of blood&quot;.<a href="#fn178" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref178"><sup>178</sup></a> Now his doctors believed he was suffering from &quot;a suppurating tumour&quot; of the lung and admitted that Edward's life was beyond recovery.<a href="#fn179" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref179"><sup>179</sup></a> Soon, his legs became so swollen that he had to lie on his back, and he lost the strength to resist the disease.

During the next two days, large crowds arrived hoping to see the king again, but on the 3rd, they were told that the weather was too chilly for him to appear. Edward died at the age of 15 at <a href="Greenwich_Palace" title="wikilink">Greenwich Palace</a> on 6 July 1553. According to <a href="John_Foxe" title="wikilink">John Foxe</a>'s legendary account of his death, his last words were: &quot;I am faint; Lord have mercy upon me, and take my spirit&quot;.<a href="#fn181" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref181"><sup>181</sup></a> He was buried in <a href="Henry_VII_Lady_Chapel" title="wikilink">Henry VII Lady Chapel</a> at <a href="Westminster_Abbey" title="wikilink">Westminster Abbey</a> on 8 August 1553, with reformed rites performed by <a href="Thomas_Cranmer" title="wikilink">Thomas Cranmer</a>.

In those six years, the Church transferred from an essentially Roman Catholic liturgy and structure to one that is usually identified as Protestant.<a href="#fn206" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref206"><sup>206</sup></a> In particular, the introduction of the Book of Common Prayer, the Ordinal of 1550, and Cranmer's <a href="Thirty-nine_Articles" title="wikilink">Forty-two Articles</a> formed the basis for English Church practices that continue to this day.<a href="#fn207" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref207"><sup>207</sup></a> Edward himself fully approved these changes, and though they were the work of reformers such as Thomas Cranmer, <a href="Hugh_Latimer" title="wikilink">Hugh Latimer</a>, and <a href="Nicholas_Ridley_(martyr)" title="wikilink">Nicholas Ridley</a>, backed by Edward's determinedly evangelical Council, the fact of the king's religion was a catalyst in the acceleration of the Reformation during his reign.<a href="#fn208" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref208"><sup>208</sup></a></p>
<p>Queen Mary's attempts to undo the reforming work of her brother's reign faced major obstacles. Despite her belief in the papal supremacy, she ruled constitutionally as the <a href="Supreme_Head" title="wikilink">Supreme Head</a> of the English Church, a contradiction under which she bridled.<a href="#fn209" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref209"><sup>209</sup></a> She found herself entirely unable to restore the vast number of ecclesiastical properties handed over or sold to private landowners.<a href="#fn210" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref210"><sup>210</sup></a> Although she burned a number of leading Protestant churchmen, many reformers either went into exile or remained subversively active in England during her reign, producing a torrent of reforming propaganda that she was unable to stem.<a href="#fn211" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref211"><sup>211</sup></a> Nevertheless, Protestantism was not yet &quot;printed in the stomachs&quot; of the English people,<a href="#fn212" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref212"><sup>212</sup></a> and had Mary lived longer, her Catholic reconstruction might have succeeded, leaving Edward's reign, rather than hers, as a historical aberration.<a href="#fn213" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref213"><sup>213</sup></a></p>
<p>On Mary's death in 1558, the English Reformation resumed its course, and most of the reforms instituted during Edward's reign were reinstated in the <a href="Elizabethan_Religious_Settlement" title="wikilink">Elizabethan Religious Settlement</a>. Queen Elizabeth replaced Mary's councillors and bishops with ex-Edwardians, such as <a href="William_Cecil,_1st_Baron_Burghley" title="wikilink">William Cecil</a>, Northumberland's former secretary, and <a href="Richard_Cox_(bishop)" title="wikilink">Richard Cox</a>, Edward's old tutor, who preached an anti-Catholic sermon at the opening of parliament in 1559.<a href="#fn214" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref214"><sup>214</sup></a> Parliament passed an <a href="Act_of_Uniformity_1559" title="wikilink">Act of Uniformity</a> the following spring that restored, with modifications, Cranmer's prayer book of 1552;<a href="#fn215" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref215"><sup>215</sup></a> and the <a href="Thirty-nine_Articles" title="wikilink">Thirty-nine Articles</a> of 1563 were largely based on Cranmer's Forty-two Articles. The theological developments of Edward's reign provided a vital source of reference for Elizabeth's religious policies, though the internationalism of the Edwardian Reformation was never revived.<a href="#fn216" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref216"><sup>216</sup></a></p>

However, a minority prefer the terms &quot;evangelical&quot; or &quot;new&quot;. In this view, as expressed by Diarmaid MacCulloch, it is &quot;premature to use the label 'Protestant' for the English movement of reform in the reigns of Henry and Edward, even though its priorities were intimately related to what was happening in central Europe. A description more true to the period would be 'evangelical', a word which was indeed used at the time in various cognates&quot;. <a href="#fnref206" class="footnote-back">↩</a></li>
