<h3 id="early-life">Early life</h3>
<p>James Lance Bass was born to James Irvin Bass, Jr., a <a href="medical_laboratory" title="wikilink">medical lab</a> technician, and Diane Bass, a <a href="Primary_education" title="wikilink">middle school</a> <a href="mathematics" class="uri" title="wikilink">mathematics</a> teacher,<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> in <a href="Laurel,_Mississippi" title="wikilink">Laurel, Mississippi</a>.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> He has one older sister named Stacy.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> Bass was raised in the town of <a href="Ellisville,_Mississippi" title="wikilink">Ellisville, Mississippi</a> as &quot;a strict <a href="Southern_Baptist" title="wikilink">Southern Baptist</a>, in the steep shadow of the church&quot;, and has described his family as a &quot;completely traditional Southern family&quot;.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> At a young age, Bass developed a fascination with <a href="space" class="uri" title="wikilink">space</a>, and, at age 9, traveled to <a href="Cape_Canaveral,_Florida" title="wikilink">Cape Canaveral, Florida</a> with his father and grandfather to watch his first live space shuttle launch. Of this experience he said, &quot;I was certain from then on that that my future was to be involved with space.&quot;<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> Bass attended <a href="U.S._Space_Camp" title="wikilink">space camp</a> the following year,<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> and aspired to attend college and study <a href="engineering" class="uri" title="wikilink">engineering</a>, with the hope that he would one day work for <a href="NASA" class="uri" title="wikilink">NASA</a>.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
<p>When Bass was 10 years old, his father was transferred to a different hospital, and the family packed up and moved to <a href="Clinton,_Mississippi" title="wikilink">Clinton, Mississippi</a>.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> There, Bass began singing in his church choir and as a chorus member in his school. While a student at <a href="Clinton_High_School_(Mississippi)" title="wikilink">Clinton High School</a>, Bass joined <a href="Mississippi_Show_Stoppers" title="wikilink">Mississippi Show Stoppers</a>, a state-wide group sponsored by the Mississippi <a href="Agriculture" class="uri" title="wikilink">Agriculture</a> and <a href="Forestry" class="uri" title="wikilink">Forestry</a> Museum, and was a member of Attach&lt;U+00E9&gt;, a competitive <a href="show_choir" title="wikilink">show choir</a> group that traveled across the country.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> One of Bass's vocal coaches during his time in the Mississippi Show Stoppers was Bob Westbrook, a professional vocal coach who had previously worked with young performers <a href="Justin_Timberlake" title="wikilink">Justin Timberlake</a> and <a href="Britney_Spears" title="wikilink">Britney Spears</a>.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> Westbrook's connection to Timberlake would later play a large role in Bass joining 'N Sync.</p>
<p>Along with being a member of the Showstoppers and Attach&lt;U+00E9&gt;, Bass was a member of a seven-man vocal group called Seven Card Stud, which competed at state fairs and performed at several social and political events for <a href="Senator" class="uri" title="wikilink">Senator</a> <a href="Trent_Lott" title="wikilink">Trent Lott</a>.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> Bass was also elected vice president of his junior class, and has said that he was &quot;extremely popular&quot; among the female contingent of his high school because, &quot;I never tried to do anything that was considered too forward or out of bounds. I was a very polite, safe date.&quot;<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a></p>

<p>In 1995, Bass joined Justin Timberlake, <a href="JC_Chasez" title="wikilink">JC Chasez</a>, <a href="Chris_Kirkpatrick" title="wikilink">Chris Kirkpatrick</a> and <a href="Joey_Fatone" title="wikilink">Joey Fatone</a> in the <a href="boy_band" title="wikilink">boy band</a> 'N Sync, after the original bass singer, Jason Watkins, quit the group.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> In need of a replacement, the group began searching. Timberlake recruited Bass, following a recommendation by their mutual vocal coach, Westbrook.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> Timberlake later said that the group had to convince Bass's mother to let her son join, as they were told she would &quot;never let him do it&quot;.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> 'N Sync toured <a href="Germany" class="uri" title="wikilink">Germany</a> throughout 1996, before hitting it big in the United States two years later. In 2000, the group released the fastest-selling record of all time, <em><a href="No_Strings_Attached" title="wikilink">No Strings Attached</a></em>,<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> and in 2001 followed it up with their <em><a href="Celebrity_(album)" title="wikilink">Celebrity</a></em> album,<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> which scored the second highest first-week album sales ever.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> Bass was known as &quot;The Shy One&quot;.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a></p>
<p>Bass has said that he felt betrayed when 'N Sync went through much-publicized legal battles with <a href="Lou_Pearlman" title="wikilink">Lou Pearlman</a> in 1999. Of Pearlman, who has since been imprisoned for various <a href="bank_fraud" title="wikilink">bank fraud</a> charges, Bass has said, &quot;I had thought of Lou as a member of the family, but I felt that I'd been completely screwed over... I had learned a cruel lesson. I knew I would never be able to completely rely on anyone in this business again, no matter how nice they seemed.&quot;<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> In a November 2007 interview with <em><a href="GQ" class="uri" title="wikilink">GQ</a></em> magazine, Bass revealed that the last time he ever spoke to Pearlman was &quot;in court. Karma is a bitch.&quot;<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a></p>

<p>In 2000, Bass had a recurring role as the character Rick Palmer on the <a href="WB" class="uri" title="wikilink">WB</a> drama <em><a href="7th_Heaven" title="wikilink">7th Heaven</a></em>.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> Bass received his first starring role in the 2001 <a href="motion_picture" title="wikilink">motion picture</a> <em><a href="On_the_Line_(film)" title="wikilink">On The Line</a></em>, co-starring <a href="Emmanuelle_Chriqui" title="wikilink">Emmanuelle Chriqui</a> and fellow 'N Sync bandmember Joey Fatone. The film was produced by Bass's production company, Bacon &amp; Eggs (formerly known as A Happy Place), and featured appearances by <a href="Jerry_Stiller" title="wikilink">Jerry Stiller</a>, <a href="Al_Green" title="wikilink">Al Green</a>, <a href="Bon_Jovi" title="wikilink">Bon Jovi</a> guitarist <a href="Richie_Sambora" title="wikilink">Richie Sambora</a>, former <a href="World_Wrestling_Entertainment" title="wikilink">WWE</a> wrestler <a href="Joanie_Laurer" title="wikilink">Joanie Laurer</a>, and Bass's bandmates Justin Timberlake and Chris Kirkpatrick (who were seen only in the end credits). Production on the film took place in <a href="Toronto" class="uri" title="wikilink">Toronto</a> and <a href="Chicago" class="uri" title="wikilink">Chicago</a> over the span of one month, as 'N Sync was in the midst of recording their <em><a href="Celebrity_(album)" title="wikilink">Celebrity</a></em> album at the time.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> <a href="Miramax" class="uri" title="wikilink">Miramax</a> marketed the film heavily towards 'N Sync's teen fans, and the film's soundtrack featured songs by teen pop sensations <a href="Mandy_Moore" title="wikilink">Mandy Moore</a> and <a href="BB_Mak" title="wikilink">BB Mak</a>, along with previously unreleased tracks by 'N Sync and <a href="Britney_Spears" title="wikilink">Britney Spears</a>. However, the film was a <a href="box-office" class="uri" title="wikilink">box-office</a> flop, and grossed only $4.2 million domestically despite having a <a href="production_budget" title="wikilink">production budget</a> of $10 million.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> Bass's acting abilities took the brunt of the film's criticisms, with one movie critic calling Bass &quot;a pitiful actor [who] should never be put in a position where he will be expected to emote.&quot;<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> <em><a href="New_York_Post" title="wikilink">New York Post</a></em> film critic Lou Lumenick also stated that Bass's acting &quot;makes <a href="Freddie_Prinze_Jr." title="wikilink">Freddie Prinze Jr.</a> look like <a href="Al_Pacino" title="wikilink">Al Pacino</a>.&quot;<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a></p>
<p>Despite criticisms received after <em>On The Line</em>, Bass has gone on to make several other film appearances, with <a href="cameo" title="wikilink">cameos</a> in both <em><a href="Zoolander" class="uri" title="wikilink">Zoolander</a></em> and <a href="Wes_Craven" title="wikilink">Wes Craven</a>'s <em><a href="Cursed_(film)" title="wikilink">Cursed</a></em>. In the 2007 film <em><a href="I_Now_Pronounce_You_Chuck_and_Larry" title="wikilink">I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry</a></em>, Bass played a wedding singer.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> Bass has also lent his voice to several animated television programs, such as <em><a href="Robot_Chicken" title="wikilink">Robot Chicken</a></em> and <a href="Disney" class="uri" title="wikilink">Disney</a>'s <em><a href="Kim_Possible" title="wikilink">Kim Possible</a></em> and <em><a href="Higglytown_Heroes" title="wikilink">Higglytown Heroes</a></em>.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> In the gaming world, Bass was the voice of <a href="Sephiroth" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sephiroth</a> in the successful <a href="action_role-playing_game" title="wikilink">action role-playing game</a>, <a href="Kingdom_Hearts" title="wikilink">Kingdom Hearts</a>.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> He did not reprise his role in the sequel, <a href="Kingdom_Hearts_2" title="wikilink">Kingdom Hearts 2</a>.</p>

<h3 id="producing-career">Producing career</h3>
<p>Bass's film production company, Bacon &amp; Eggs, went on to produce the <a href="2004" class="uri" title="wikilink">2004</a> short film <em>Seek &amp; Hide</em>.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> In <a href="2007" class="uri" title="wikilink">2007</a>, Bacon &amp; Eggs produced the film <em><a href="Lovewrecked" class="uri" title="wikilink">Lovewrecked</a></em>, which starred <a href="Amanda_Bynes" title="wikilink">Amanda Bynes</a>, <a href="Chris_Carmack" title="wikilink">Chris Carmack</a> and <a href="Jamie-Lynn_Sigler" title="wikilink">Jamie-Lynn Sigler</a>, and had Bass in a small role.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> Bass also formed a separate production company named Lance Bass Productions.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a></p>
<p>In addition to film production, Bass has also dabbled in <a href="music_management" title="wikilink">music management</a>.

<p>Bass's <a href="autobiography" class="uri" title="wikilink">autobiography</a>, &quot;Out Of Sync&quot;, was published on <a href="October_23" title="wikilink">October 23</a>, <a href="2007" class="uri" title="wikilink">2007</a>.<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a> It was co-written by <em>New York Times</em> best-selling biographer Marc Eliot, who also wrote the book's introduction, and was published by <a href="Simon_Spotlight_Entertainment" title="wikilink">Simon Spotlight Entertainment</a>, a division of <a href="Simon_&amp;_Schuster" title="wikilink">Simon &amp; Schuster</a>.<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a><a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a> The 208-page book covers what Bass describes as &quot;the first chapter&quot; in his life, from his childhood growing up in rural Mississippi, to his efforts to obtain a seat on a Russian space capsule and the proceeding financial issues he had with his sponsors, and culminating with Bass's decision to go public with his sexuality.<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a> Bass does not hold back his true feelings about 'N Sync's 2004 decision to go on &quot;permanent hiatus&quot;, expressing anger and confusion when bandmate Timberlake left the band to pursue a solo career.<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a></p>

Bass was originally supposed to be the host of a space competition show to be entitled &quot;The Big Mission&quot;, in which several contestants would go through rigorous training in order to win a seat on a Russian <a href="Soyuz" class="uri" title="wikilink">Soyuz</a> <a href="space_capsule" title="wikilink">space capsule</a>. However, the game show concept fell apart when the producers of the show decided it would be a much better idea to shoot a documentary of a celebrity actually training and going into space, and airing it on a major network. The producers came up with the idea of using Bass when, while sitting with a friend and discussing the space project, the friend's daughter shouted out, &quot;Lance Bass wants to go into space!&quot; The girl, who was an 'N Sync fan, learned of Bass's lifelong dream of space travel when she read it in an online chat, and suggested Bass to the producers.<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a></p>
<p><img src="Bassnasa.jpg" title="fig:Bass&#39;s official cosmonaut photo" alt="Bass&#39;s official cosmonaut photo" width="150" /> Of the opportunity to go to space, Bass said, &quot;I am completely overwhelmed at the invitation. I'm looking forward to completing this lifelong dream. I am honored and privileged to represent my country in this history-making mission.&quot;<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a> Before being cleared for training, Bass had to participate in weeks of medical screening at the Institute for Bio-Medical Problems near <a href="Moscow,_Russia" title="wikilink">Moscow, Russia</a>.<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a> In order to be admitted into training, Bass agreed to undergo heart surgery to correct <a href="cardiac_arrythmia" title="wikilink">cardiac arrythmia</a>, which was discovered in 1999 when he collapsed after a concert.<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a> Bass's training included <a href="weightlessness" title="wikilink">parabolic flights</a>, space flight theory, learning how to eat and drink in space, underwater training, and intense physical training, including daily four mile runs.<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a> The training also included &quot;survival training&quot; for different climactic and geographical areas, in case there were complications with his shuttle landing; it was reported that Bass had to &quot;learn shooting techniques to defend himself against wolves and other predators, in addition to basic preservation skills such as building a shelter and starting a fire.&quot;<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a> In order to communicate with his fellow cosmonauts, Bass had to learn the <a href="Russian_language" title="wikilink">Russian language</a> from a tutor who spoke only <a href="French_language" title="wikilink">French</a>.<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a></p>
<p>After several months of training, Bass received cosmonaut certification and was scheduled to fly into space on the <a href="Soyuz_TMA-1" title="wikilink">Soyuz TMA-1</a> mission that was to be launched on <a href="October_30" title="wikilink">October 30</a>, <a href="2002" class="uri" title="wikilink">2002</a>.

<p>Celebrity gossip <a href="blog" title="wikilink">blogger</a> <a href="Perez_Hilton" title="wikilink">Perez Hilton</a> had consistently posted items on his website about Bass's sexuality beginning in September 2005.<a href="#fn72" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref72"><sup>72</sup></a> However, Bass and his friends have claimed that it was not Hilton who outed him, but instead a blurb that ran in the <a href="Page_Six" title="wikilink">Page Six</a> <a href="gossip_column" title="wikilink">gossip column</a> on <a href="July_12" title="wikilink">July 12</a>, <a href="2006" class="uri" title="wikilink">2006</a>.<a href="#fn73" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref73"><sup>73</sup></a> Bass's mother read the blurb, and immediately went on the Internet to discover various gossip sites reporting on her son's sexuality. &quot;The worst part about it was my mom found out not from me,&quot; said Bass. &quot;She found out on the Internet, and that's what just killed me. ... It destroyed her for a little bit.&quot;<a href="#fn74" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref74"><sup>74</sup></a> Of his decision to come out, Bass said, &quot;The thing is, I&lt;U+2019&gt;m not ashamed &lt;U+2013&gt; that&lt;U+2019&gt;s the one thing I want to say. I don't think it's wrong, I'm not devastated going through this. I'm more liberated and happy than I&lt;U+2019&gt;ve been my whole life. I'm just happy.&quot;<a href="#fn75" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref75"><sup>75</sup></a></p>

In his coming out interview, Bass stated, &quot;I knew that I was in this popular band and I had four other guys' careers in my hand, and I knew that if I ever acted on it, or even said [that I was gay], it would overpower everything.&quot;<a href="#fn78" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref78"><sup>78</sup></a> Bass has stated that, while there were many rules the members of 'N Sync had to follow in order to uphold their public image &lt;U+2013&gt; such as not being seen smoking or drinking &lt;U+2013&gt; he was never told, &quot;And you can't be gay&quot;.<a href="#fn79" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref79"><sup>79</sup></a> Yet Bass said he knew that coming out would hurt the band's sales. &quot;If you can't have a beer in your hand &lt;U+2013&gt; if that's going to make thousands of girls not buy your album &lt;U+2013&gt; then being gay definitely is going to make girls not buy your album.&quot;<a href="#fn80" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref80"><sup>80</sup></a> Despite these fears, Bass revealed in an August 2007 interview with <em><a href="The_New_York_Daily_News" title="wikilink">The New York Daily News</a></em> that his female fanbase &quot;exploded&quot; when he <a href="came_out" title="wikilink">came out</a>.<a href="#fn81" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref81"><sup>81</sup></a> On <a href="July_26" title="wikilink">July 26</a>, <a href="2007" class="uri" title="wikilink">2007</a>, Bass celebrated the one year anniversary of his coming out with a letter to his fans on his <a href="MySpace" class="uri" title="wikilink">MySpace</a> page, in which he stated that coming out was &quot;the best thing I have ever done.&quot;<a href="#fn82" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref82"><sup>82</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="public-response">Public response</h3>
<p>Bass's announcement received a large amount of media attention. The American public's reaction was generally positive, with Bass receiving &quot;overwhelming support&quot; from many teenagers and young adults who grew up listening to 'N Sync.<a href="#fn83" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref83"><sup>83</sup></a> Bass's announcement quickly found its way into <a href="popular_culture" title="wikilink">popular culture</a> when the term &quot;lanced&quot;, which means &quot;to be outed by someone in the public media&quot;, began to be used after his decision to come out. In recent months, this term was applied to actors <a href="T.R._Knight" title="wikilink">T.R. Knight</a> and <a href="Neil_Patrick_Harris" title="wikilink">Neil Patrick Harris</a> after they faced similar media scrutiny regarding their sexualities. The catchphrase was coined by Bass's <a href="Ex_(relationship)" title="wikilink">ex-boyfriend</a>, <a href="Reichen_Lehmkuhl" title="wikilink">Reichen Lehmkuhl</a>.<a href="#fn84" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref84"><sup>84</sup></a></p>
<p>Bass received heat from the gay community when certain statements that he made in his <em>People</em> interview offended some activists. In the interview, Bass referred to himself and his friends as <a href="straight_acting" title="wikilink">straight acting</a>. &quot;I call them the SAGs &lt;U+2014&gt; the straight-acting gays,&quot; Bass said. &quot;We're just normal, typical guys. I love to watch football and drink beer.&quot;<a href="#fn85" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref85"><sup>85</sup></a> This comment angered some members of the LGBT community, who believed that Bass not only implied that effeminate gay men were not 'normal', but further enforced unneeded <a href="stereotype" title="wikilink">stereotypes</a>.<a href="#fn86" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref86"><sup>86</sup></a><a href="#fn87" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref87"><sup>87</sup></a> Bass, according to gay groups, also seemed to imply that he had little interest in the fight for equal rights, after Bass commented that he was not planning on &quot;leading the parade&quot;.<a href="#fn88" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref88"><sup>88</sup></a><a href="#fn89" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref89"><sup>89</sup></a> In a 2007 interview with the <em><a href="Southern_Voice" title="wikilink">Southern Voice</a></em>, Bass said these statements were misunderstood. &lt;U+201C&gt;I am very new to this, so I would be stupid to lead the parades and talk at these events, because I don&lt;U+2019&gt;t know what I'm talking about. I don&lt;U+2019&gt;t know the phrases to say, and everything that I say is going to be taken wrong... I'll definitely get involved, but I'm not going to pretend I'm the smartest person out there [or say], &lt;U+2018&gt;Listen to me because I know what I'm saying.&lt;U+2019&gt;&lt;U+201D&gt;<a href="#fn90" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref90"><sup>90</sup></a> When asked by the <em><a href="Dallas_Observer" title="wikilink">Dallas Observer</a></em> if he stood by his description of himself as a &quot;straight-acting gay&quot;, Bass replied, &quot;No... I was trying to say that there are so many types of gay people, just like there are so many types of straight people. And that just didn&lt;U+2019&gt;t read well. I didn&lt;U+2019&gt;t explain it well.&quot;<a href="#fn91" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref91"><sup>91</sup></a></p>
<p>On <a href="October_6" title="wikilink">October 6</a>, <a href="2006" class="uri" title="wikilink">2006</a>, the <a href="Human_Rights_Campaign" title="wikilink">Human Rights Campaign</a> awarded Bass its 2006 Visibility Award.<a href="#fn92" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref92"><sup>92</sup></a> The decision was met with heavy criticism from certain HRC sponsors, who claimed that Bass had not done enough to deserve the award.<a href="#fn93" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref93"><sup>93</sup></a> One journalist at <a href="The_Washington_Blade" title="wikilink">The Washington Blade</a> threatened to walk out when Bass received the award, &quot;in a quiet form of protest&quot;.<a href="#fn94" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref94"><sup>94</sup></a> The Human Rights Campaign stood by Bass and defended his award, responding to critics by saying, &quot;Bass is the biggest music star since <a href="Melissa_Etheridge" title="wikilink">Melissa Etheridge</a> to come out, and maybe some people think HRC should just ignore these moments of cultural significance, but his declaration did initiate a positive, national conversation that continues today.&quot;<a href="#fn95" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref95"><sup>95</sup></a></p>

<p>Bass has mentioned in several interviews that he is a practicing <a href="Christian" class="uri" title="wikilink">Christian</a> and that he regularly attends <a href="church" class="uri" title="wikilink">church</a>.<a href="#fn96" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref96"><sup>96</sup></a><a href="#fn97" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref97"><sup>97</sup></a> During his days in 'N Sync, Bass's album <a href="liner_notes" title="wikilink">liner notes</a> often included extended writings on his faith, God, and <a href="Jesus_Christ" title="wikilink">Jesus Christ</a>,<a href="#fn98" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref98"><sup>98</sup></a> and he was known for wearing a large cross necklace around his neck at many public events.<a href="#fn99" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref99"><sup>99</sup></a> In a 2001 interview with <a href="Larry_King" title="wikilink">Larry King</a>, Bass proclaimed, &quot;I'm very religious&quot;<a href="#fn100" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref100"><sup>100</sup></a> and expressed with certainty that God is &quot;definitely, definitely&quot; watching over him.<a href="#fn101" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref101"><sup>101</sup></a> Regarding obstacles he has faced for being a gay Christian, Bass has said that his sexuality has not affected his faith. &quot;I'm still a Christian.
