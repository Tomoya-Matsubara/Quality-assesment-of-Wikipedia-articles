<p><strong>Andrew William</strong> &quot;<strong>Nicky</strong>&quot; <strong>Barr</strong>, <a href="Officer_of_the_Order_of_the_British_Empire" title="wikilink">OBE</a>, <a href="Military_Cross" title="wikilink">MC</a>, <a href="Distinguished_Flying_Cross_(United_Kingdom)" title="wikilink">DFC</a> and <a href="Medal_bar" title="wikilink">Bar</a> (10 December 1915 &lt;U+2013&gt; 12 June 2006) was a member of the <a href="Australian_national_rugby_union_team" title="wikilink">Australian national rugby union team</a> who became a <a href="flying_ace" title="wikilink">flying ace</a> in the <a href="Royal_Australian_Air_Force" title="wikilink">Royal Australian Air Force</a> (RAAF) during World War II. He was credited with twelve aerial victories, all scored flying the <a href="Curtiss_P-40_Warhawk" title="wikilink">Curtiss P-40</a> fighter. Born in New Zealand, Barr was raised in <a href="Victoria_(Australia)" title="wikilink">Victoria</a> and first represented the state in rugby in 1936. Selected to play for Australia against the United Kingdom in 1939, he had just arrived in England when the tour was cancelled following the outbreak of war. He joined the RAAF in 1940 and was posted to <a href="North_African_Campaign" title="wikilink">North Africa</a> with <a href="No._3_Squadron_RAAF" title="wikilink">No. 3 Squadron</a> in September 1941. His first three victories were attained in the P-40D Tomahawk and the remainder in the P-40E Kittyhawk.</p>
<p>Barr's achievements as a combat pilot earned him the <a href="Distinguished_Flying_Cross_(United_Kingdom)" title="wikilink">Distinguished Flying Cross</a> and <a href="Medal_bar" title="wikilink">Bar</a>. Shortly after taking command of No. 3 Squadron in May 1942, he was shot down and captured by <a href="Axis_powers" title="wikilink">Axis forces</a>, and incarcerated in Italy. He escaped and assisted other <a href="Allies" title="wikilink">Allied</a> fugitives to safety, receiving the <a href="Military_Cross" title="wikilink">Military Cross</a> for his efforts. Repatriated to England, he saw action during the <a href="Operation_Overlord" title="wikilink">invasion of Normandy</a> in June 1944 before returning to Australia as chief instructor with <a href="No._2_Operational_Conversion_Unit_RAAF" title="wikilink">No. 2 Operational Training Unit</a>. After the war he became a company director, and rejoined the RAAF as an active reserve officer from 1951 to 1953. From the early 1960s he was heavily involved in the <a href="oilseed" class="uri" title="wikilink">oilseed</a> industry, for which he was appointed an <a href="Officer_of_the_Order_of_the_British_Empire" title="wikilink">Officer of the Order of the British Empire</a> in 1983. He died in 2006, aged ninety.</p>
<h2 id="early-career">Early career</h2>
<p>Andrew Barr was born in <a href="Wellington,_New_Zealand" title="wikilink">Wellington</a>, New Zealand, on 10 December 1915; he had a twin brother, Jack. The family moved to Australia when the boys were six. Growing up in <a href="Melbourne" class="uri" title="wikilink">Melbourne</a>, Andrew attended <a href="Kew,_Victoria" title="wikilink">Kew Public School</a> and played <a href="Australian_rules_football" title="wikilink">Australian rules football</a>. He was also the Victorian Schoolboys' 100 yards athletics champion three years in succession, from 1926 to 1928. In 1931, aged fifteen, he began his association with the <a href="Lord_Somers_Camp" title="wikilink">Lord Somers Camp</a> and Power House social and sporting organisations located at <a href="Western_Port" title="wikilink">Western Port</a>. After leaving school, Barr studied construction at <a href="Swinburne_University_of_Technology" title="wikilink">Swinburne Technical College</a>, but later took a diploma course in accountancy and made it his profession. He started playing <a href="rugby_union" title="wikilink">rugby union</a> in 1935 through one of his friends in the Power House club. Weighing  and just under  tall, Barr gained selection for Victoria as a <a href="hooker_(rugby_union)" title="wikilink">hooker</a> the following year. In 1939, he was chosen to play in the United Kingdom with the Australian national team, the <a href="Australia_national_rugby_union_team" title="wikilink">Wallabies</a>. The tour was cancelled however less than a day after the team arrived in the UK on 2 September, due to the outbreak of World War II.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a><a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> Keen to serve as a <a href="fighter_pilot" title="wikilink">fighter pilot</a>, Barr initially tried to enlist in the <a href="Royal_Air_Force" title="wikilink">Royal Air Force</a>, but withdrew his application when told that it was unlikely he would fly anytime in the near future, and that he could expect only administrative duties in the interim.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>Returning to Australia on the <a href="RMS_Strathaird" title="wikilink">RMS <em>Strathaird</em></a>, Barr joined the <a href="Royal_Australian_Air_Force" title="wikilink">Royal Australian Air Force</a> as an air cadet on 4 March 1940.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a><a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> After undergoing instruction on <a href="Tiger_Moth" title="wikilink">Tiger Moths</a> at No. 3 Elementary Flying Training School, <a href="Essendon,_Victoria" title="wikilink">Essendon</a>, and on <a href="Hawker_Demon" title="wikilink">Hawker Demons</a> and <a href="Avro_Anson" title="wikilink">Avro Ansons</a> at <a href="No._1_Flying_Training_School_RAAF" title="wikilink">No. 1 Service Flying Training School</a>, <a href="RAAF_Williams" title="wikilink">Point Cook</a>, he was commissioned as a <a href="pilot_officer" title="wikilink">pilot officer</a> on 24 September.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a><a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> He gained a reputation as something of a rebel during training, and became forever known as &quot;Nicky&quot;, for &quot;<a href="Christian_teaching_about_the_Devil" title="wikilink">Old Nick</a>&quot;, or the Devil.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a><a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> In his quest to gain assignment as a fighter pilot, he had deliberately aimed poorly during bombing practice, a stratagem also adopted by at least two of his fellow students.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> By November 1940, he had been posted to <a href="No._23_Squadron_RAAF" title="wikilink">No. 23 (City of Brisbane) Squadron</a>, flying <a href="CAC_Wirraway" title="wikilink">CAC Wirraways</a> on patrol off the <a href="Queensland" class="uri" title="wikilink">Queensland</a> coast.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a><a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> The aircraft was, according to Barr, &quot;our front line fighter in those days, but it didn't take too long to realise that the capacity of the Wirraway, compared with the types of planes that we were going to encounter, left much to be desired&quot;.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> Though his duties frustrated him somewhat, Barr was nevertheless grateful to have this extensive flight experience under his belt when he eventually saw combat.

<p>Eventually credited with victories over twelve enemy aircraft, plus two probables and eight damaged, Barr became No. 3 Squadron's highest-scoring member.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a><a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a><a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> He flew a total of eighty-four combat <a href="sortie" title="wikilink">sorties</a>, twenty of them in one fortnight, and six on 16 June 1942 alone.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a><a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> His philosophy was that the P-40 was not a top-class fighter, but that its shortcomings &quot;could be offset by unbridled aggression&quot;, so he resolved to treat aerial combat as he would a boxing match and &quot;overcome much better opponents by simply going for them&quot;.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> <a href="Bobby_Gibbes" title="wikilink">Bobby Gibbes</a> became No. 3 Squadron's commanding officer in February 1942, and made Barr his senior flight commander.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> Promoted to <a href="flight_lieutenant" title="wikilink">flight lieutenant</a> on 1 April, Barr was raised to acting <a href="squadron_leader" title="wikilink">squadron leader</a> and appointed to command the unit in May, barely six months after he commenced operations, following Gibbes's hospitalisation with a broken leg.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a><a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> Barr had never sought leadership of the squadron, and felt that others were just as well qualified for the role.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> As a commander he delegated most administrative tasks to his <a href="adjutant" class="uri" title="wikilink">adjutant</a> but, contrary to normal practice, wrote letters to the next-of-kin of casualties himself.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a></p>

<p>Three times while serving with No. 3 Squadron, Barr was himself shot down. The first occasion was on 11 January 1942 when, having destroyed a Bf 109 and a <a href="Fiat_G.50" title="wikilink">Fiat G.50</a>, he was preparing to touch down in the desert to pick up a fellow pilot who had crash landed. He had his undercarriage halfway down when he was &quot;jumped&quot; by two other Bf 109s. He immediately engaged both and shot one down before more German fighters arrived and he was hit and forced to land behind enemy lines.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a><a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> As one of the German planes came in low to strafe the downed Kittyhawk, Barr ran straight at it in an attempt to throw the pilot off his aim, and was injured by ricocheting fragments of rock struck by cannon shells.

<p>After leaving the Air Force, Barr remained in Mildura with his wife, Dorothy (Dot). They had met on a blind date in 1938 and been married only a few weeks when Nicky joined the RAAF.
