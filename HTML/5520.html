The slogan formed the cornerstone of <a href="advertising_agency" title="wikilink">advertising agency</a> <a href="Abbott_Mead_Vickers_BBDO" title="wikilink">Abbott Mead Vickers BBDO</a>'s successful pitch to secure the Guinness account in 1996.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> Their proposal was to turn around the negative consumer opinion of the length of time required to correctly pour a pint of Guinness from the tap, usually quoted as 119.5 seconds, as well as to encourage <a href="bartender" title="wikilink">bartenders</a> to take the time to do so. A similar idea had been incorporated into a number of Guinness campaigns in the past, such as the <a href="Republic_of_Ireland" title="wikilink">Irish</a> &quot;Guinness Time&quot; television and cinema spots of the early 1990s.</p>
<p>The first piece of the &quot;Good Things...&quot; campaign to be launched was the sixty-second <em><a href="Swimblack" class="uri" title="wikilink">Swimblack</a></em> television and cinema commercial, in which an aging local sports hero annually swims in a race from an offshore <a href="buoy" class="uri" title="wikilink">buoy</a> to his brother's seafront <a href="public_house" title="wikilink">pub</a> against the &quot;clock&quot; of pint of Guinness being correctly poured at the bar.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> The advertisement, which premiered on 16 May 1998,<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> was successful at boosting sales, particularly among the older male <a href="demographic_profile" title="wikilink">demographic</a>. The other major success of the campaign during its original four-year run was the critically-acclaimed <em><a href="Surfer_(Guinness)" title="wikilink">Surfer</a></em> commercial released in 1999; a more serious black-and-white piece for television and cinema inspired by <a href="Walter_Crane" title="wikilink">Walter Crane</a>'s 1892 painting <em><a href="Neptune&#39;s_Horses" title="wikilink">Neptune's Horses</a></em>.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> <em>Surfer</em> went on to be voted the &quot;Best Ad of All Time&quot; in a poll conducted by <em><a href="The_Sunday_Times" title="wikilink">The Sunday Times</a></em> and <a href="Channel_4" title="wikilink">Channel 4</a> in 2002.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> After several other variations on the theme, including <em><a href="Bet_on_Black" title="wikilink">Bet on Black</a></em> and <em><a href="Dreamer_(Guinness)" title="wikilink">Dreamer</a></em>, the campaign was put on the backburner. The primary motivation behind this was Diageo's decision to forgo regional advertising in the United Kingdom and Ireland in favour of pan-<a href="Europe" title="wikilink">European</a> campaigns, in the same manner as Guinness campaigns in <a href="North_America" title="wikilink">North America</a> and the <a href="Africa" title="wikilink">African</a> <a href="Michael_Power_(Guinness_character)" title="wikilink">Michael Power</a> series. The &quot;Good Things...&quot; slogan proved difficult to translate, and so a decision was made to pursue other campaign ideas.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> Two of the more successful slogans tried out between 2000 and 2005 were &quot;Believe&quot; (<em><a href="Tom_Crean_(Guinness)" title="wikilink">Tom Crean</a></em>, <em><a href="Free_In_(Guinness)" title="wikilink">Free In</a></em>, <em><a href="Volcano_Rescue" title="wikilink">Volcano Rescue</a></em>) and &quot;A story of light and dark&quot; (<em><a href="Moth_(Guinness)" title="wikilink">Moth</a></em>, <em><a href="Mustang_(Guinness)" title="wikilink">Mustang</a></em>).</p>
<p>In 2005 Diageo made the decision to return to regional marketing campaigns. As such, Abbot Mead Vickers BBDO were presented with the choice of either coming up with a new slogan, or attempting to find a fresh take on &quot;Good Things...&quot;. Feeling that none of the replacements that had been tried out in the intervening years had matched the appeal of Good Things..., the agency decided to attempt to find a new angle on their old concept. Several ideas were proposed, and the one believed to show the most promise was that of &quot;The Longest Wait&quot;. After a basic script had been put together, the agency brought director <a href="Daniel_Kleinman" title="wikilink">Daniel Kleinman</a> on board. The result was commercial <em><a href="noitulovE" class="uri" title="wikilink">noitulovE</a></em>, which followed three Guinness patrons travelling backwards through time, &quot;de-evolving&quot; into a number of species along the way. The piece was a huge success both critically and financially: it received more awards than any other commercial in the world in 2006,<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> and was credited with pushing Guinness into the position of <a href="market_dominance" title="wikilink">market leader</a> in the United Kingdom beer market.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p>Spurred on by this success, AMV BBDO produced several more &quot;Good Things...&quot; print and television commercials in 2006 and 2007, such as <em><a href="Hands_(Guinness)" title="wikilink">Hands</a></em> and <em><a href="Fridge_(Guinness)" title="wikilink">Fridge</a></em>. The most recent item in the campaign is <em><a href="Tipping_Point_(Guinness)" title="wikilink">Tipping Point</a></em>, Guinness' most expensive commercial to date, which premiered on British television on 13 November 2007.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
