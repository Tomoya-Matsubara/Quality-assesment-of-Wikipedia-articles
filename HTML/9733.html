<p><img src="Chaostrinity.jpg" title="fig:Members of the Chaos Trinity - Bugly, Bludgeon and Mindwipe" alt="Members of the Chaos Trinity - Bugly, Bludgeon and Mindwipe" /> Mindwipe was one of the members of the <a href="Chaos_Trinity" title="wikilink">Chaos Trinity</a> in the second <em>War Within</em> series. In this series he turns into a Cybertronian jet and isn't a Headmaster yet.</p>
<p>When <a href="Megatron" class="uri" title="wikilink">Megatron</a> and <a href="Autobot" class="uri" title="wikilink">Autobot</a> leader <a href="Optimus_Prime" title="wikilink">Optimus Prime</a> disappeared in an accident with a <a href="Space_Bridge" title="wikilink">Space Bridge</a>, the Autobot and Decepticon forces splintered into smaller factions. <a href="Bludgeon_(Transformers)" title="wikilink">Bludgeon</a> became leader of the Chaos Trinity, which was comprised of himself, <a href="Bugly" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bugly</a> and Mindwipe. The Chaos Trinity was devoted to expanding its members' knowledge of the mystic arts. The Chaos Trinity acted as master manipulators, tricking others into doing their work for them. For instance, when Shockwave's faction developed <a href="Trypticon" class="uri" title="wikilink">Trypticon</a>, the Chaos Trinity tipped off the Autobots under <a href="Prowl_(Transformers)" title="wikilink">Prowl</a> where it was being tested. The Chaos Trinity came into the service of <a href="Fallen_(Transformers)" title="wikilink">the Fallen</a>, an ancient Transformer who betrayed Primus and was now an agent of Unicron. The Fallen promised to expand their mystic powers in return for their loyalty, after threatening to kill them if they didn't join him. Attacking a meeting between Jetfire and Shockwave, hypnotising the former and incapacitating the latter, they were then beaten by <a href="Grimlock" class="uri" title="wikilink">Grimlock</a>, who had come because he believed that Jetfire was betraying them. However, this was all part of a bigger set-up by the Fallen, who easily defeated the Dinobot leader. Then battling the <a href="Protectobot" title="wikilink">Protectobots</a> and kidnapping Hot Spot, the Trinity took him to the Fallen for an arcane ritual. However, they were attacked by Shockwave's Decepticons. Shockwave personally gunned down Mindwipe, with Bugly falling to a combined barrage. Bludgeon fled, but was blasted by a teleporting <a href="Skywarp" class="uri" title="wikilink">Skywarp</a> '''</p>
