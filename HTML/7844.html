<p><strong>Metallica</strong> is an American <a href="heavy_metal_music" title="wikilink">heavy metal</a> band that formed in 1981 in . Founded when drummer <a href="Lars_Ulrich" title="wikilink">Lars Ulrich</a> posted an advertisement in a Los Angeles newspaper, Metallica's original line-up consisted of Ulrich, <a href="rhythm_guitarist" title="wikilink">rhythm guitarist</a> and vocalist <a href="James_Hetfield" title="wikilink">James Hetfield</a>, <a href="lead_guitarist" title="wikilink">lead guitarist</a> <a href="Dave_Mustaine" title="wikilink">Dave Mustaine</a>, and <a href="bassist" class="uri" title="wikilink">bassist</a> <a href="Ron_McGovney" title="wikilink">Ron McGovney</a>. These last two were later ejected from the band, in favor of <a href="Kirk_Hammett" title="wikilink">Kirk Hammett</a> and <a href="Cliff_Burton" title="wikilink">Cliff Burton</a>, respectively. The ejection of Mustaine resulted in a feud between him and Metallica. In September 1986, Metallica's tour bus skidded out of control and flipped, which resulted in Burton being crushed under the bus and killed. <a href="Jason_Newsted" title="wikilink">Jason Newsted</a> replaced him less than two months later. Newsted left the band in 2001 and was replaced by <a href="Robert_Trujillo" title="wikilink">Robert Trujillo</a> in 2003.</p>
<p>Metallica's early releases included fast <a href="tempos" class="uri" title="wikilink">tempos</a>, <a href="instrumentals" class="uri" title="wikilink">instrumentals</a>, and aggressive <a href="musicianship" class="uri" title="wikilink">musicianship</a> that placed them as one of the &quot;Big Four&quot; of the <a href="thrash_metal" title="wikilink">thrash metal</a> subgenre alongside <a href="Slayer" class="uri" title="wikilink">Slayer</a>, <a href="Megadeth" class="uri" title="wikilink">Megadeth</a> and <a href="Anthrax_(band)" title="wikilink">Anthrax</a>. The band earned a growing fan base in the <a href="underground_music" title="wikilink">underground music</a> community, and some critics say the 1986 release <em><a href="Master_of_Puppets" title="wikilink">Master of Puppets</a></em> is one of the most influential and &quot;heavy&quot; thrash metal albums. The band achieved substantial commercial success with its self-titled 1991 album <em><a href="Metallica_(album)" title="wikilink">Metallica</a></em>, which debuted at number one on the <em><a href="Billboard_200" title="wikilink">Billboard 200</a></em>. Some critics and fans believed the band changed its musical direction to appeal to the <a href="Mainstream_(terminology)" title="wikilink">mainstream</a> audience. With the release of <em><a href="Load_(album)" title="wikilink">Load</a></em> in 1996, Metallica distanced itself from earlier releases in what has been described as &quot;an almost <a href="alternative_rock" title="wikilink">alternative</a> [rock] approach&quot;, and the band faced accusations of &quot;<a href="selling_out" title="wikilink">selling out</a>&quot;.</p>
<p>In 2000, Metallica was among several artists who filed a lawsuit against <a href="Napster" class="uri" title="wikilink">Napster</a> for sharing the band's copyright-protected material for free without the band members' consent. A settlement was reached, and Napster became a pay-to-use service. Despite reaching number one on the <em>Billboard 200</em>, the release of <em><a href="St._Anger" title="wikilink">St. Anger</a></em> in 2003 disappointed some critics and fans with the exclusion of <a href="guitar_solos" title="wikilink">guitar solos</a>, and the &quot;steel-sounding&quot; <a href="snare_drum" title="wikilink">snare drum</a>. A film titled <em><a href="Some_Kind_of_Monster_(film)" title="wikilink">Some Kind of Monster</a></em> documented the recording process of <em>St. Anger</em>.</p>
<p>Metallica has released eight <a href="studio_album" title="wikilink">studio albums</a>, two live albums, two <a href="Extended_play" title="wikilink">EPs</a>, twenty-two music videos, thirty-nine <a href="single_(music)" title="wikilink">singles</a> and has finished recording their upcoming ninth studio album, <em><a href="Death_Magnetic" title="wikilink">Death Magnetic</a></em>. The band has become one of the most commercially successful and influential heavy metal acts. With 100 million records sold worldwide, including 57 million in the United States, the band has won seven <a href="Grammy_Awards" title="wikilink">Grammy Awards</a>, and has had four albums peak at number one on the <em>Billboard 200</em>.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> The band's 1991 album <em>Metallica</em>, has sold over 15 million copies, which makes it the 25th highest selling album in the United States.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>

<p>Metallica was formed in <a href="Los_Angeles" title="wikilink">Los Angeles</a>, <a href="California" class="uri" title="wikilink">California</a>, in early 1981 when drummer <a href="Lars_Ulrich" title="wikilink">Lars Ulrich</a> placed an advertisement in a Los Angeles newspaper&lt;U+2014&gt;<em><a href="The_Recycler" title="wikilink">The Recycler</a></em>&lt;U+2014&gt;which read &quot;Drummer looking for other metal musicians to <a href="jam_(music)" title="wikilink">jam</a> with <a href="Tygers_of_Pan_Tang" title="wikilink">Tygers of Pan Tang</a>, <a href="Diamond_Head_(band)" title="wikilink">Diamond Head</a> and <a href="Iron_Maiden" title="wikilink">Iron Maiden</a>.&quot;<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> Guitarists <a href="James_Hetfield" title="wikilink">James Hetfield</a> and Hugh Tanner of <a href="Leather_Charm" title="wikilink">Leather Charm</a> answered the advertisement. Although he had not formed a band, Ulrich asked <a href="Metal_Blade_Records" title="wikilink">Metal Blade Records</a> founder <a href="Brian_Slagel" title="wikilink">Brian Slagel</a> if he could record a song for the label's upcoming compilation <em><a href="Metal_Massacre" title="wikilink">Metal Massacre</a></em>. Slagel accepted, and Ulrich recruited Hetfield to sing and play <a href="rhythm_guitar" title="wikilink">rhythm guitar</a>.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>Ulrich talked to his friend Ron Quintana, who was brainstorming names for a <a href="fanzine" class="uri" title="wikilink">fanzine</a>. Quintana had proposed the names Metal Mania and Metallica. Convincing him to use <em>Metal Mania</em>, Ulrich used Metallica for the name of his band. A second advertisement was placed in <em>The Recycler</em> for a position as <a href="lead_guitarist" title="wikilink">lead guitarist</a>. <a href="Dave_Mustaine" title="wikilink">Dave Mustaine</a> answered, and, after seeing his expensive guitar equipment, Ulrich and Hetfield recruited him. In early 1982, Metallica recorded its first original song &quot;Hit the Lights&quot; for the <em>Metal Massacre I</em> compilation. Hetfield played bass on the song and <a href="Lloyd_Grant" title="wikilink">Lloyd Grant</a> was credited with a guitar solo.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> Released on <a href="June_14" title="wikilink">June 14</a>, <a href="1982" class="uri" title="wikilink">1982</a>, early pressings of <em>Metal Massacre I</em> listed the band incorrectly as &quot;Mettallica&quot;. Although angered by the error, Metallica managed to create enough &quot;<a href="Word_of_mouth" title="wikilink">buzz</a>&quot; with the song and the band played its first live show on <a href="March_14" title="wikilink">March 14</a>, <a href="1982" class="uri" title="wikilink">1982</a>, at <a href="Radio_City" title="wikilink">Radio City</a> in <a href="Anaheim,_California" title="wikilink">Anaheim, California</a> with newly recruited bassist <a href="Ron_McGovney" title="wikilink">Ron McGovney</a>.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> Metallica recorded its first demo titled <em><a href="Power_Metal_(Metallica_album)" title="wikilink">Power Metal</a></em>, a name inspired by Quintana's early business cards in early 1982. In the Fall of 1982, Ulrich and Hetfield attended a show at the nightclub <a href="Whisky_a_Go_Go" title="wikilink">Whisky a Go Go</a>, which featured bassist <a href="Cliff_Burton" title="wikilink">Cliff Burton</a> in a band called Trauma. The two were &quot;blown away&quot; by Burton's use of a <a href="wah-wah_pedal" title="wikilink">wah-wah pedal</a> and asked him to join Metallica. Hetfield and Mustaine wanted McGovney out as they thought that he &quot;didn't contribute anything, he just followed.&quot;<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> Although Burton initially declined the offer, by the end of the year he accepted on the condition the band move to San Francisco. Metallica's first live performance with Burton was at the nightclub The Stone in March 1983, and the first recording to feature Burton was the 1983 <em><a href="Metallica_demos#Megaforce_Demo" title="wikilink">Megaforce</a></em> demo.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p>Metallica was ready to record its debut album, but when Metal Blade was unable to cover the additional cost, the band began looking for other options. Concert promoter <a href="Johny_Zazula" title="wikilink">Johnny &quot;Z&quot; Zazula</a>, who had heard the 1982 <em><a href="No_Life_&#39;til_Leather" title="wikilink">No Life 'til Leather</a></em> demo, offered to broker a record deal with Metallica and <a href="New_York_City" title="wikilink">New York City</a>-based record labels. After receiving no interest from various record labels, Zazula borrowed the money to cover the record's recording budget and signed Metallica to his own label, <a href="Megaforce_Records" title="wikilink">Megaforce Records</a>.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> Band members decided to kick Mustaine out of the band due to drug and <a href="alcohol_abuse" title="wikilink">alcohol abuse</a>, and violent behavior.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> <a href="Exodus_(band)" title="wikilink">Exodus</a> guitarist <a href="Kirk_Hammett" title="wikilink">Kirk Hammett</a> flew in to replace Mustaine the same afternoon. Metallica's first show with Hammett was on <a href="April_16" title="wikilink">April 16</a>, <a href="1983" class="uri" title="wikilink">1983</a>, at the nightclub The Showplace in <a href="Dover,_New_Jersey" title="wikilink">Dover, New Jersey</a>.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<p>Mustaine has expressed his dislike for Hammett in interviews. He said Hammett &quot;stole my job, but at least I got to bang his girlfriend before he took my job &lt;U+2014&gt; how do I taste, Kirk?&quot;<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> Mustaine was &quot;pissed off&quot; because he believes Hammett became popular by playing the guitar leads that Mustaine wrote.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> In a 1985 interview with <em><a href="Metal_Forces" title="wikilink">Metal Forces</a></em>, Mustaine slammed Hammett saying, &quot;it's real funny how Kirk Hammett ripped off every lead break I'd played on that <em><a href="No_Life_&#39;til_Leather" title="wikilink">No Life 'til Leather</a></em> tape and got voted No. 1 guitarist in your magazine.&quot;<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> On Megadeth's 1985 debut album <em><a href="Killing_Is_My_Business..._And_Business_Is_Good!" title="wikilink">Killing Is My Business... And Business Is Good!</a></em>, Mustaine included the song &quot;Mechanix&quot;, which Metallica renamed as &quot;The Four Horsemen&quot; on <em>Kill 'Em All</em>. Mustaine said he did this to &quot;straighten Metallica up&quot;, as Metallica referred to Mustaine as a drunk and said he could not play guitar.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>

<p>In 1983, Metallica traveled to <a href="Rochester,_New_York" title="wikilink">Rochester, New York</a> to record its first album, <em>Metal Up Your Ass</em>, with production duties handled by Paul Curcio. Due to conflicts with the band's record label and the distributors' refusal to release an album with that name, it was renamed <em><a href="Kill_&#39;Em_All" title="wikilink">Kill 'Em All</a></em>. Released on Megaforce Records in the U.S. and <a href="Music_for_Nations" title="wikilink">Music for Nations</a> in Europe, the album peaked on the <em>Billboard 200</em> at number 120,<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> and although the album was not initially a financial success, it earned Metallica a growing fan base in the <a href="Underground_music" title="wikilink">underground</a> metal scene.

Steve Huey of <a href="Allmusic" class="uri" title="wikilink">Allmusic</a> said that <em>Ride the Lightning</em> featured &quot;extended, progressive epics; tight, concise groove-rockers&quot;.<a href="#fn92" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref92"><sup>92</sup></a> Huey felt Metallica expanded its compositional technique and range of expression to take on a more aggressive approach in following releases, and lyrics dealt with more personal and socially conscious issues.<a href="#fn93" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref93"><sup>93</sup></a> Lyrical themes explored on <em>Master of Puppets</em> included religious and military leaders, rage, insanity, monsters, and drugs.<a href="#fn94" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref94"><sup>94</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1991, with new producer <a href="Bob_Rock" title="wikilink">Bob Rock</a>, Huey felt Metallica simplified and streamlined its music for a more commercial approach to appeal to the mainstream audience.<a href="#fn95" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref95"><sup>95</sup></a> The band abandoned its aggressive, fast <a href="tempo" title="wikilink">tempos</a> to expand its music and expressive <a href="Range_(music)" title="wikilink">range</a>, said Robert Palmer of <em>Rolling Stone</em>.<a href="#fn96" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref96"><sup>96</sup></a> The change in direction proved commercially successful as <em>Metallica</em> was the band's first album to peak at number one on the <a href="Billboard_200" title="wikilink">Billboard 200</a>.
