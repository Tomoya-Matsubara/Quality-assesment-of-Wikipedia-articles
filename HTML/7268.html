<p>The <strong>Jack Russell Terrier</strong> is a small <a href="terrier" class="uri" title="wikilink">terrier</a> that has its origins in <a href="fox_hunting" title="wikilink">fox hunting</a>. It is principally white-bodied smooth, rough or broken&lt;U+2013&gt;coated which is commonly confused with the <a href="Parson_Russell_Terrier" title="wikilink">Parson Russell Terrier</a> (the <a href="American_Kennel_Club" title="wikilink">American Kennel Club</a> (AKC) and affiliate variant) and the <a href="Russell_Terrier" title="wikilink">Russell Terrier</a> (a shorter legged, stockier variety) with the term &quot;Jack Russell&quot; commonly misapplied to other small white terriers. The Jack Russell Terrier is a broad type, with a size range of , the Parson Russell is limited only to a middle range with a standard size of , while the Russell Terrier is smaller at , however each breed has different physical proportions according to the standards of their breed clubs.</p>
<p>The working Jack Russell Terrier is a unique terrier which has been preserved in working ability as well as appearance much as it existed over 200 years ago. Originating from the dogs bred and used by <a href="Jack_Russell_(dog_breeder)" title="wikilink">Reverend John Russell</a> in the early 19th century from the <a href="English_White_Terrier" title="wikilink">English White Terrier</a>, they have similar origins to the modern <a href="Fox_Terrier" title="wikilink">Fox Terrier</a>. The Jack Russell is a high energy breed which relies on a high level of exercise and stimulation, and does not have a great deal of serious health complaints. It has gone through several changes over the centuries, with changes in use and the formation of different <a href="conformation_show" title="wikilink">conformation show</a> standards by different kennel clubs. Recognition for the breed by kennel clubs has been opposed by the breed's parent societies – something which resulted in the creation and recognition of the Parson Russell Terrier. Jack Russells have appeared multiple times in film, television and print with several historical dogs of note.</p>

<p><a href="image:Old_Jock.jpg" title="wikilink">thumb|left|upright|Old Jock, a famous Fox Terrier born in 1859.</a></p>
<p>An important attribute in this dog was a tempered aggressiveness that would provide the necessary drive to pursue and bolt the fox without resulting in physical harm to the quarry and effectively ending the chase, which was considered unsporting.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> Russell was said to have prided himself that his terriers never tasted blood.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> This line of terriers developed by John Russell was well respected for these qualities and his dogs were often taken on by hunt enthusiasts. It is unlikely, however, that any dogs alive today are descended from Trump, as Russell was forced to sell all his dogs on more than one occasion because of financial difficulty, and had only four aged (and non-breeding) terriers left when he died in 1883.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<p>The Fox Terrier and Jack Russell Terrier type dogs of today are all descended from dogs of that period, although documented pedigrees earlier than 1862 have not been found. Several records remain of documented breeding by Reverend John Russell between the 1860s and 1880s. The Fox Terrier Club was formed in 1875 with Russell as one of the founder members; its breed standard was aspiration and not a description of how the breed appeared then. By the start of the 20th century the Fox Terrier had altered more towards the modern breed, but in some parts of the country the old style of John Russell's terriers remained and it is from those dogs that the modern Jack Russell type descends.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
<p>Many breeds can claim heritage to the early Fox Terrier of this period, including the <a href="Brazilian_Terrier" title="wikilink">Brazilian Terrier</a>, <a href="Japanese_Terrier" title="wikilink">Japanese Terrier</a>, <a href="Miniature_Fox_Terrier" title="wikilink">Miniature Fox Terrier</a>, <a href="Ratonero_Bodeguero_Andaluz" title="wikilink">Ratonero Bodeguero Andaluz</a>, <a href="Rat_Terrier" title="wikilink">Rat Terrier</a> and <a href="Tenterfield_Terrier" title="wikilink">Tenterfield Terrier</a>.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>

<p>Arthur Blake Heinemann created the first breed standard, and in 1894 he found the Devon and Somerset Badger Club, whose aims were to promote <a href="badger" class="uri" title="wikilink">badger</a> digging rather than fox hunting, and the breeding of terriers suitable for this purpose. Terriers were acquired from Nicholas Snow of <a href="Oare" class="uri" title="wikilink">Oare</a>, and they were likely descended from John Russell's original dogs, as the Parson would have probably hunted at some point with Snow's hunting club and is likely to have provided at least some of their original terriers.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> By the turn of the 20th century Parson John Russell's name had become associated with this breed of dog.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>
<p>The club would go on to be renamed the Parson Jack Russell Terrier Club.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> Badger digging required a different type of dog to fox hunting, and it is likely that <a href="Bull_Terrier" title="wikilink">Bull Terrier</a> stock was introduced to strengthen the breed, which may have caused the creation of a shorter legged variety of Jack Russell Terrier that started to appear around this period. At the same time that a split was appearing between show and working Fox Terriers, a further split was occurring between two different types of white terrier, both carrying Jack Russell's name.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> Heinemann was invited to judge classes for <a href="working_terrier" title="wikilink">working terriers</a> at <a href="Crufts" class="uri" title="wikilink">Crufts</a> with an aim to bring working terriers back into the show ring and influence those that disregard working qualities in dogs. These classes were continued for several years by various judges, but <a href="Charles_Cruft" title="wikilink">Charles Cruft</a> dropped the attempt as the classes were never heavily competed. Following Heinemann's death in 1930, the kennel and leadership of the club passed to Annie Harris, but the club itself folded shortly before <a href="World_War_II" title="wikilink">World War II</a>.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a><a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a></p>

<p><a href="image:Jack_Russell_in_Field.jpg" title="wikilink">thumb|right|The modern working Jack Russell Terrier.</a> Following <a href="World_War_II" title="wikilink">World War II</a>, the requirement for hunting dogs drastically declined, and with it the numbers of Jack Russell Terriers. The dogs were increasingly used as family and companion dogs. Further cross breeding occurred, with <a href="Welsh_Corgi" title="wikilink">Welsh Corgis</a>, <a href="Chihuahua_(dog)" title="wikilink">Chihuahuas</a> and other smaller breeds of Terrier. The offspring of these crosses became known as Puddin' Dogs, Shortie Jacks or <a href="Russell_Terrier" title="wikilink">Russell Terriers</a>.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a></p>
<p>The <a href="Jack_Russell_Terrier_Club_of_America" title="wikilink">Jack Russell Terrier Club of America</a> was formed in 1976 by Mrs. Alicia Crawford, one of the first Jack Russell Terrier breeders in the United States. Size ranges for dogs were kept broad, with the ability of working dogs awarded higher than those in <a href="conformation_show" title="wikilink">conformation shows</a>. An open registry was maintained with restricted line breeding. Registration for the club is made at adulthood for Jack Russells rather than at birth, to ensure the breed's qualities remain given the open registry.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a></p>

<p>Several breed clubs appeared in the United Kingdom during the 70s to promote the breed, including the Jack Russell Terrier Club of Great Britain (JRTCGB) and the South East Jack Russell Terrier Club (SEJRTC). The JRTCGB promoted the range of sizes that remain in its standards today, whereas the SEJRTC set a minimum height for dogs at . While the JRTCGB sought to ensure that the breed's working ability remained through non-recognition with breed registries, the SEJRTC activity sought recognition with the UK <a href="Kennel_Club" title="wikilink">Kennel Club</a>.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> In 1983 the Parson Jack Russell Terrier Club of Great Britain (PJRTCGB) was resurrected to seek Kennel Club recognition for the breed. Although the application was initially rejected, a new standard was created for the PJRTCGB based on the standard of the SEJRTC, and under that standard the breed was recognised by the Kennel Club in 1990 as the Parson Jack Russell Terrier.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> Jack was dropped from the official name in 1999, and the recognised name of the breed became the <a href="Parson_Russell_Terrier" title="wikilink">Parson Russell Terrier</a>.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a></p>
<p>In the late 1990s, the <a href="American_Kennel_Club" title="wikilink">American Kennel Club</a> explored the possibility of recognising the Jack Russell Terrier.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> This move was opposed by the Jack Russell Terrier Club of America as they did not want the breed to lose its essential working characteristics.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> The Jack Russell Terrier Breeders Association was formed, and petitioned the AKC with the breed's admission granted in 2001. Under the AKC recognised standard, the size of the breed was narrowed from the previous club's standard and the name of the AKC recognised Jack Russell Terrier was changed to Parson Russell Terrier,<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> with the Jack Russell Terrier Breeders Association renamed to the Parson Russell Terrier Association of America.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a></p>

<p>Due to their working nature, Jack Russell Terriers remain much as they were some 200 years ago.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> They are sturdy, tough, and tenacious, measuring between  at the <a href="withers" class="uri" title="wikilink">withers</a>,<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a> and weigh .<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> The body length must be in proportion to the height, and the dog should present a compact, balanced image. Predominantly white in coloration (more than 51%) with black and/or tan markings,<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a> they exhibit either a smooth, rough or a combination of both which is known as a broken coat. A broken-coated dog may have longer hair on the tail or face than that which is seen on a smooth-coated dog.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a> The skin can sometimes show a pattern of small black or brown spots, referred to as &quot;ticking&quot;, that do not carry through to the outer coat.<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a> All coat types should be dense double coats that are neither silky (in the case of smooth coats) nor woolly (in the case of rough coats).<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a></p>
<p><a href="image:Jack_russell_terrier_LM.jpg" title="wikilink">thumb|left|A broken-coated Jack Russell Terrier.</a></p>
<p>The head should be of moderate width at the ears, narrowing to the eyes, and slightly flat between the ears. There should be a defined but not overpronounced stop at the end of the muzzle where it meets the head, and a black nose. The jaw should be powerful and well boned with a scissor bite and straight teeth. The eyes are almond shaped and dark colored, and should be full of life and intelligence. Small V-shaped ears of moderate thickness are carried forward on the head.<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a> When the dog is alert, the tip of the V should not extend past the outer corner of the eyes. The tail is set high and in the past was docked to approximately five inches in order to provide a sufficient hand-hold for gripping the terrier.<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a></p>
<p>The Jack Russell should always appear balanced and alert.<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a> As it is primarily a working terrier, its most important physical characteristic is its chest size, which must not be so large that it prevents the dog from entering and working in burrows.<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a> The <a href="red_fox" title="wikilink">red fox</a> is the traditional <a href="quarry" class="uri" title="wikilink">quarry</a> of the Jack Russell Terrier (JRT), so the working Jack Russell must be small enough to pursue it.

Because the preservation of this working ability is of highest importance to most registered JRTCA/JRTCGB breeders, Jack Russells tend to be extremely intelligent, athletic, fearless, and vocal dogs.<a href="#fn70" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a> It is not uncommon for these dogs to become moody or destructive if not properly stimulated and exercised, as they have a tendency to bore easily and will often create their own fun when left alone to entertain themselves.<a href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a></p>

<h3 id="eye-disorders">Eye disorders</h3>
<p>Lens luxation, also known as ectopia lentis is the most common hereditary disorder in Jack Russell Terriers. Even so, this condition is not a common occurrence in the breed. Most frequently appearing in dogs between the ages of 3 and 8 years old, it is where the lens in one or both eyes becomes displaced. There are two types, posterior luxation (where the lens slips to the back of the eye) and anterior luxation (where the lens slips forward). Posterior luxation is the less severe of the two types, as the eye can appear normal although the dog's eyesight will be affected. In anterior luxation, the lens can slip forward and rub against the <a href="cornea" class="uri" title="wikilink">cornea</a>, damaging it. Anterior luxation also has a high probability of causing <a href="glaucoma" class="uri" title="wikilink">glaucoma</a> which can lead to partial or complete blindness. Treatment is available and may include both medical and surgical options. Secondary lens luxation is caused by trauma to the eye, and is not hereditary.<a href="#fn82" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref82"><sup>82</sup></a> The condition appears in a number of terrier breeds as well as the <a href="Border_Collie" title="wikilink">Border Collie</a>, <a href="Brittany_(dog)" title="wikilink">Brittany</a> and <a href="Cardigan_Welsh_Corgi" title="wikilink">Cardigan Welsh Corgi</a>.<a href="#fn83" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref83"><sup>83</sup></a></p>
<p>Cataracts can affect any breed of dog, and is the same condition as seen in humans. Here the lens of the eye hardens and is characterized by cloudiness in the eye.<a href="#fn84" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref84"><sup>84</sup></a><a href="#fn85" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref85"><sup>85</sup></a> Cataracts will blur the dog's vision and can lead to permanent blindness if left untreated. While considered mainly a hereditary disease, it can also be caused by <a href="diabetes_in_dogs" title="wikilink">diabetes</a>, old age, radiation, eye injury or exposure to high temperatures.<a href="#fn86" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref86"><sup>86</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="musculoskeletal-conditions">Musculoskeletal conditions</h3>
<p><a href="Patellar_luxation" title="wikilink">Patellar luxation</a>, also known as luxating patella, is a hereditary disorder affecting the knees. It is where the <a href="kneecap" class="uri" title="wikilink">kneecap</a> slips off the groove on which it normally sits. The effects can be temporary with the dog running while holding its hind leg in the air before running on it again once the kneecap slipped back into place as if nothing has happened. Dogs can have a problem with both rear knees, and complications can include <a href="arthritis" class="uri" title="wikilink">arthritis</a> or torn knee ligaments. Severe cases can require surgery.<a href="#fn87" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref87"><sup>87</sup></a></p>
