<p><em>How Brown Saw the Baseball Game</em> was released into theaters by Lubin Manufacturing Company on November 16, 1907, and was still being shown as late as August 13, 1908.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a><a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> During this time, the film sometimes was presented as part of a <a href="double_feature" title="wikilink">double feature</a> with the 1907 film <em>Neighbors Who Borrow</em>, a short comedy film about a man who loans nearly everything he owns to his neighbors until his wife returns home and berates him for doing so.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a><a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
