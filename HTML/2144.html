<h2 id="trivia">Trivia</h2>
<ul>
<li>The play&lt;U+2019&gt;s fictional setting, River City, Iowa, is based in part on Willson&lt;U+2019&gt;s own birthplace, <a href="Mason_City,_Iowa" title="wikilink">Mason City</a>, <a href="Iowa" class="uri" title="wikilink">Iowa</a>. The &lt;U+201C&gt;river&lt;U+201D&gt; in River City is likely the <a href="Mississippi_River" title="wikilink">Mississippi</a>, near <a href="Davenport,_Iowa" title="wikilink">Davenport</a>, owing to the announcement by the Rock Island conductor: &lt;U+201C&gt;River City, Ioway! Cigarettes illegal in this state.&lt;U+201D&gt; This suggests that Hill and his fellow passengers have just crossed the Iowa border, across the historic bridge spanning the Mississippi from <a href="Rock_Island,_Illinois" title="wikilink">Rock Island</a> to Davenport.</li>
<li><em>American Libraries</em>, the journal of the <a href="American_Library_Association" title="wikilink">American Library Association</a>, reported in the March 2005 issue the source of the name of the character Marian Paroo (aka Marian the Librarian) was Marian Seeley of Provo, Utah. Mrs. Seeley had been an acquaintance of Meredith Willson during <a href="World_War_II" title="wikilink">World War II</a>, when she was a medical records librarian. The magazine reported that Meredith Willson &quot;dubbed her 'Marian the Librarian' at the time, then went on to include that character in his play.&quot;</li>
<li>The story is thought to take place in <a href="1912" class="uri" title="wikilink">1912</a>. However, the song &quot;Ya Got Trouble&quot; contains a reference to <em><a href="Captain_Billy&#39;s_Whiz-Bang" title="wikilink">Captain Billy's Whiz-Bang</a></em>. This was a monthly humor magazine that began publication in October 1919.</li>

<li>The song &quot;<a href="Till_There_Was_You" title="wikilink">Till There Was You</a>&quot; was covered by <a href="the_Beatles" title="wikilink">the Beatles</a> in 1963 on their second album <em><a href="With_the_Beatles" title="wikilink">With the Beatles</a></em>. It is the only showtune the Beatles covered.</li>
<li><em>The Music Man</em> is spoofed in <em><a href="The_Simpsons" title="wikilink">The Simpsons</a></em> episode &quot;<a href="Marge_vs._the_Monorail" title="wikilink">Marge vs. the Monorail</a>&quot; written by <a href="Conan_O&#39;Brien" title="wikilink">Conan O'Brien</a>. At some point during the revival, O'Brien was approached about playing the role of Harold Hill for a brief run, but he ultimately could not fit it into his schedule. He says, on the DVD commentary track for the aforementioned 'Simpsons' episodes, that it was the hardest choice he's ever had to make professionally, because <em>The Music Man</em> is one of his all-time favorite things. O'Brien did, however, as host of the 58th Annual Primetime Emmy Awards, send up a parody version of &quot;Ya got Trouble&quot; in his opening monologue targeting NBC and their slide in the ratings.</li>
<li>The song &quot;Ya Got Trouble&quot; was mentioned in the <a href="Boston_Legal" title="wikilink">Boston Legal</a> episode &quot;Men To Boys,&quot; the <a href="Veronica_Mars" title="wikilink">Veronica Mars</a> episode &quot;Look Who's Stalking&quot; and the <a href="Everwood" class="uri" title="wikilink">Everwood</a> episode &quot;Vegetative State&quot;.</li>
<li>In the <em><a href="Everwood" class="uri" title="wikilink">Everwood</a></em> episode &quot;Fear Itself&quot;, Dr. Abbott prefers watching the classic <em>The Music Man</em> to contemporary eye candy <em>XXX</em>, declaring that <a href="Robert_Preston_(actor)" title="wikilink">Robert Preston</a> is cool. He reminds his daughter Amy that she always liked the song &quot;Shipoopi&quot;.</li>
<li>The &quot;Piano Lesson&quot; musical number is spoofed in the <em><a href="Family_Guy" title="wikilink">Family Guy</a></em> episode &quot;<a href="Brian_Wallows_and_Peter&#39;s_Swallows" title="wikilink">Brian Wallows and Peter's Swallows</a>&quot;. Additionally, in the episode &quot;<a href="The_Patriot_Games" title="wikilink">The Patriot Games</a>&quot;, &quot;Shipoopi&quot; was sung in an extended sequence by the character <a href="Peter_Griffin" title="wikilink">Peter Griffin</a> to celebrate scoring a touchdown for the <a href="New_England_Patriots" title="wikilink">New England Patriots</a>, and the characters recreated the famous choreography from the film.</li>
<li>Several Music Man songs were used in <em><a href="Ally_McBeal" title="wikilink">Ally McBeal</a></em>. </li>
<li><em>Gilmore Girls</em>, which uses the same backlot set as the <em>Music Man</em> film, frequently makes reference to the film.</li>
<li>In the 1960's film <a href="The_Apartment" title="wikilink">The Apartment</a> starring <a href="Jack_Lemmon" title="wikilink">Jack Lemmon</a>, <a href="Shirley_MacLaine" title="wikilink">Shirley MacLaine</a>, and <a href="Fred_MacMurray" title="wikilink">Fred MacMurray</a>, Lemmon gets stood up by MacLaine who was supposed to meet him for a date on Broadway to see Music Man.</li>
