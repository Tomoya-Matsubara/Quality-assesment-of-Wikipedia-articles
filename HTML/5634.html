<p><strong>Building 20</strong> was the name used to refer to the building on the campus of the <a href="Massachusetts_Institute_of_Technology" title="wikilink">Massachusetts Institute of Technology</a>, originally as a temporary structure, during <a href="World_War_II" title="wikilink">World War II</a>. It housed the <a href="Radiation_Laboratory" title="wikilink">Radiation Laboratory</a> (or &quot;Rad Lab&quot;), where fundamental advances in physical electronics, electromagnetic properties of matter, microwave physics, and microwave communication principles were made.</p>
<p>The building was constructed in 1943 as part of the war effort, however it went on to be used until its demolition in 1998, making it the longest-surviving World War II temporary structure. <a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>Due to its origins as a temporary structure, researchers felt free to modify the building at will:</p>

<dd>Its &quot;temporary nature&quot; permitted its occupants to abuse it in ways that would not be tolerated in a permanent building. If you wanted to run a wire from one lab to another, you didn't ask anybody's permission -- you just got out a screwdriver and poked a hole through the wall.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a>

<p>Professor <a href="Jerome_Lettvin" title="wikilink">Jerome Y. Lettvin</a> once quipped, &quot;You might regard it as the womb of the Institute. It is kind of messy, but by God it is procreative!&quot;<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a><a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>The building was replaced by the <a href="Ray_and_Maria_Stata_Center" title="wikilink">Ray and Maria Stata Center</a>.</p>
