<p>The <strong>Olympic Stadium</strong> in <a href="Olympic_Park,_London" title="wikilink">Olympic Park</a> in <a href="Stratford,_London" title="wikilink">Stratford</a>, <a href="London" class="uri" title="wikilink">London</a>, England was the centrepiece of the <a href="2012_Summer_Olympics" title="wikilink">2012 Summer Olympics</a>, the last stop in the <a href="2012_Summer_Olympics_torch_relay" title="wikilink">2012 Olympics torch relay</a>, and the venue of the athletic events as well as the <a href="2012_Summer_Olympics_opening_ceremony" title="wikilink">opening</a> and <a href="2012_Summer_Olympics_closing_ceremony" title="wikilink">closing</a> ceremonies. It was the central venue of the <a href="2012_Summer_Paralympics" title="wikilink">2012 Summer Paralympics</a>.</p>
<p>It is located at Marshgate Lane in London's Stratford district in the <a href="Lower_Lea_Valley" title="wikilink">Lower Lea Valley</a>. The stadium has a capacity of 80,000, making it the third-largest stadium in England behind <a href="Wembley_Stadium" title="wikilink">Wembley Stadium</a> and <a href="Twickenham_Stadium" title="wikilink">Twickenham Stadium</a>.</p>
<p>Land preparation for the stadium began in mid-2007, with the official construction start date on 22 May 2008, although piling works for the foundation unofficially began four weeks ahead of that date. The stadium will also host the <a href="2017_World_Championships_in_Athletics" title="wikilink">2017 World Championships in Athletics</a>.</p>

<p>On 13 October 2009, <a href="LOCOG" class="uri" title="wikilink">LOCOG</a> confirmed that it had selected the Team Stadium consortium (consisting of <a href="Sir_Robert_McAlpine" title="wikilink">Sir Robert McAlpine</a>; HOK Sport + Venue + Event, now known as Populous; and <a href="Buro_Happold" title="wikilink">Buro Happold</a>) to start negotiations with, in hope to find the contractor fulfilling the eventual design and build contract of the new Olympic Stadium.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>The ODA received international and national interest to prequalify for the design and construction tender but Team Stadium was the only consortium to meet all prequalification criteria. The consortium was also the team who delivered the locally acclaimed new <a href="Emirates_Stadium" title="wikilink">Emirates Stadium</a>, home of <a href="Arsenal_F.C." title="wikilink">Arsenal F.C.</a> team stadium members have extensive experience in the design and build of sports venues, including the <a href="Stadium_Australia" title="wikilink">Olympic Stadium</a> for the <a href="2000_Summer_Olympics" title="wikilink">2000 Sydney Games</a>.</p>
<p>On 11 October 2011, Britain's Olympics minister <a href="Hugh_Robertson_(politician)" title="wikilink">Hugh Robertson</a> confirmed the collapse of the Olympic Park Legacy Company's (ORTO) agreement with <a href="West_Ham_United_F.C." title="wikilink">West Ham United</a> to take over the stadium after the games. The OPLC announced that negotiations with West Ham, unveiled as the preferred stadium bidder in February 2011, had ended because of growing concerns over delays caused by the ongoing legal dispute with rival club <a href="Tottenham_Hotspur_F.C." title="wikilink">Tottenham Hotspur</a>. West Ham had not signed any contracts, allowing the OPLC to abandon talks with the club. The stadium, which cost an estimated &lt;U+00A3&gt;486 million, will now remain in public ownership and leased out to an anchor tenant following a new tender process.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="structures-and-facilities">Structures and facilities</h2>
<p><img src="Olympic_Stadium_London_design.jpg" title="fig:Exploded view of the stadium&#39;s layers" alt="Exploded view of the stadium&#39;s layers" /> The stadium design was launched on 7 November 2007. The architect, <a href="Populous_(company)" title="wikilink">Populous</a>, is an architectural firm specialising in the design of sports facilities and convention centres, as well as planning of major special events.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> Construction took four years from 2007 to 2011.</p>
<p>The stadium's track and field arena is excavated out of the soft clay found on the site, around which is permanent seating for 25,000, built using concrete &quot;rakers&quot;. The natural slope of the land is incorporated into the design, with warm-up and changing areas dug into a semi-basement position at the lower end. Spectators enter the stadium via a podium level, which is level with the top of the permanent seating bowl. A demountable lightweight steel and concrete upper tier is built up from this &quot;bowl&quot; to accommodate a further 55,000 spectators.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p><img src="London_Olympic_Stadium_Interior_-_April_2012.jpg" title="fig:The Olympic Stadium interior" alt="The Olympic Stadium interior" /> The stadium is made up of different tiers; during the games the stadium was able to hold 80,000 spectators. The base tier, which will be permanent and allow for 25,000 seats, is a sunken elliptical bowl that is made up of low-carbon-dioxide concrete; this contains 40 percent less embodied carbon than conventional concrete.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> The foundation of the base level is 5,000 piles reaching up to 20 metres deep. From there, there is a mixture of driven cast <em><a href="in_situ" title="wikilink">in situ</a></em> piles, continuous flight auger piles, and vibro concrete columns. The second tier, which holds 55,000 seats, is 315 metres long, 256 metres wide, and 60 metres high.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> The stadium is built using nearly four times less steel, approximately 10,700 tons, in the structure than that of the Olympic Stadium in Beijing for the 2008 Olympics. In addition to the minimal use of steel, which makes it 75 percent lighter, the stadium also uses high-yield large diameter pipes which were surplus on completion of <a href="North_Sea_Gas" title="wikilink">North Sea Gas</a> pipeline projects, recycled <a href="granite" class="uri" title="wikilink">granite</a>, and many of the building products were transported using trains and barges rather than by lorry.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="exterior-wrap">Exterior wrap</h3>
<p><img src="Olympic_Stadium_(London)_illuminated,_3_August_2012.jpg" title="fig:The Olympic Stadium during the 2012 Summer Olympics" alt="The Olympic Stadium during the 2012 Summer Olympics" /> Plastic, or an environmentally sustainable fabric such as <a href="hemp" class="uri" title="wikilink">hemp</a>, was initially designed to be wrapped around the stadium exterior and imprinted with a mural-type design. The wrap would have been  high and would have encircled the  circumference of the stadium. Both hemp and the continuous wrapping were ruled out. The final design for the wrap consists of 2.5 m-wide fabric panels, twisted at 90-degree angles to allow entry to the stadium at the bottom of the structure, and held in place with tensioned cables.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> It has been reported in <em><a href="The_Guardian" title="wikilink">The Guardian</a></em> that a member of the stadium-design team, Rod Sheard, would have preferred the wrap to take the form of a continuous video screen, although no costing for this was ever given.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> On 4 August 2011, it was announced that <a href="Dow_Chemical_Company" title="wikilink">Dow Chemical Company</a> would fund the wrap for the stadium, in return for being able to advertise on the wrap until 26 June 2012, at which point all advertising and logos would be removed as per Olympic requirements. The wrap is made from <a href="polyester" class="uri" title="wikilink">polyester</a> and <a href="polyethylene" class="uri" title="wikilink">polyethylene</a>, is printed using UV curable inks and encircles the stadium. Installation of the wrap began on 14 April 2012.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="roof">Roof</h3>
<p><img src="cmglee_RIBA_model_Olympic_Stadium.jpg" title="fig:Architectural model of a section of the stadium showing how the roof is suspended from the truss ring." alt="Architectural model of a section of the stadium showing how the roof is suspended from the truss ring." /> To allow for fast on-site assembly, compression truss and roof column connections were bolted; this will also enable easy disassembling of the roof structure after the closing ceremonies.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> The cable-supported roof structure covers approximately two thirds of the stadium's seating.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> A six-month study conducted by Olympic organisers found that while no roof at all could invalidate any potential world records set at the stadium, a partial roof reduced the chance of winds that can invalidate sprint and jump records from fifty percent to five percent. The roof is made from a <a href="phthalate" class="uri" title="wikilink">phthalate</a>-free <a href="polyvinyl_chloride" title="wikilink">polyvinyl chloride</a> (PVC) fabric to keep costs down.</p>
<p>Serge Ferrari, a French manufacturer of tarpaulins was selected to supply PVC fabrics which are reused and recycled after the use and demodulation of the temporary venues. The material will potentially be reused in football stadiums in Brazil for the 2014 FIFA World Cup. Others will be recycled with the PVC Recycling process <a href="Vinyloop" class="uri" title="wikilink">Vinyloop</a>.</p>
<p>Dan Epstein Head of Sustainable Development at <a href="Olympic_Delivery_Authority" title="wikilink">Olympic Delivery Authority</a> (ODA) says</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>As we have done in the past with materials such as timber and concrete, we want to use the opportunity of hosting the London 2012 Games to work with industry to set new standards. In this case this may help move the industry towards more sustainable manufacture, use and disposal of PVC fabrics.</em> <a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>

<h3 id="stadium-island">Stadium island</h3>
<p><img src="Olympic_Stadium_October_2009_SM.jpg" title="fig:The Olympic Stadium site under construction in October 2009" alt="The Olympic Stadium site under construction in October 2009" /> The stadium site is on former industrial land between the <a href="River_Lee_(England)" title="wikilink">River Lea</a> (which rejoins the <a href="Lee_Navigation" title="wikilink">Navigation</a> below <a href="Old_Ford_Lock" title="wikilink">Old Ford Lock</a>), the <a href="City_Mill_River" title="wikilink">City Mill River</a>, and the Old Pudding Mill River; parts of the <a href="Bow_Back_Rivers" title="wikilink">Bow Back Rivers</a>. Another branch of this system, St Thomas' Creek,  to the south, completes an &quot;island&quot; surrounded by water. Two hundred metres to the east is the <a href="Waterworks_River" title="wikilink">Waterworks River</a>; with the <a href="London_Aquatics_Centre" title="wikilink">London Aquatics Centre</a> on its eastern bank. This &quot;island&quot; site for the stadium lies at the southern end of the <a href="Olympic_Park,_London" title="wikilink">Olympic Park</a>. The existing waterways were modified to surround the stadium, and access is via several footbridges positioned around the building's perimeter. The stadium island is at the most western point of Newham. Bow, Tower Hamlets is directly located west of the stadium.</p>
<p>The stadium has been built on the site of the northern corner of Marshgate Lane and Knobs Hill Road, Stratford, London E15. The Knobs Hill Road trading estate was one of the industrial areas demolished to make way for the Olympic Park. The stadium occupies the northern part of the former estate. Knobs Hill Road was probably named to commemorate Knobs Hill Cottage, Marshgate Lane, Stratford, which stood from the 19th century until the inter war period (1919&lt;U+2013&gt;1939). According to the 1886 Stratford Trade Directory, it belonged to Mr George Stroud. His occupation was listed as &lt;U+201C&gt;pig dealer&lt;U+201D&gt;. The cottage is named on the contemporary Essex, Middlesex and London 1:2500 and one inch Ordnance Survey maps. The cottage appears to be associated with the Knobs Hill flour mill, which stood at the northern end of the Pudding Mill River. The first mill on the site was Nobshill Windmill, in the Manor of West Ham. The cottage site appears to be within the stadium boundary, the mills stood slightly to the northeast.</p>
<h3 id="stadium-interior">Stadium Interior</h3>

<p>Olympic Stadium's grandstands contain a lighting system developed by <a href="Tait_Technologies" title="wikilink">Tait Technologies</a> that allows them to function as a giant video screen. Individual &quot;paddles&quot; containing nine <a href="Light-emitting_diode" title="wikilink">LED</a> pixels each were installed between each seat of the stadium, which can be controlled via a central system to display video content wrapped across the stadium. The system was primarily intended for use during the ceremonies of the Olympics and Paralympics; where they were used to display over 70 minutes of animated content during the Olympics' opening ceremony.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<p>The stadium is equipped with a nine lane Mondo 400 metres athletics track. It also has a 60 metre indoor sprint track and will have space for lectures, offices, commercial, conference and hospitality. It is also seen by the London Legacy Development corporation that the stadium will host tours, concerts and art and culture events.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="response">Response</h2>
<p>The stadium design received a mixed response from the media, with reviews ranging from &quot;magnificent&quot; to a &quot;bowl of <a href="blancmange" class="uri" title="wikilink">blancmange</a>&quot;.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> The design was promoted as example of &quot;sustainable development&quot;, but some architecture critics have questioned both its aesthetic value and suitability as a national icon &lt;U+2013&gt; especially when compared to <a href="Beijing_National_Stadium" title="wikilink">Beijing National Stadium</a>. For example, Ellis Woodman, <em><a href="Building_Design" title="wikilink">Building Design</a></em>s architecture critic, said of the design: &quot;The principle of it being dismountable is most welcome... it demonstrates an obvious interest in establishing an economy of means and as such is the antithesis of the 2008 Olympic stadium in Beijing. But while that's an achievement, it's not an architectural achievement. In design terms what we're looking at is pretty underwhelming.&quot; He went on to criticise the procurement and design processes &lt;U+2013&gt; stating of the latter that it should have been subject to an architectural competition.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> This view was echoed by Tom Dyckhoff, <em><a href="The_Times" title="wikilink">The Times</a></em>'s architecture critic, who described the design as &quot;tragically underwhelming&quot; and commented that the &quot;architecture of the 2008 and 2012 Olympics will, in years to come, be seen by historians as a &quot;cunning indicator of the decline of the West and the rise of the East&quot;.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> Despite the criticism the Olympic Stadium has been nominated for the 2012 <a href="Stirling_Prize" title="wikilink">Stirling Prize</a> in architecture.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a></p>
<p>Amanda Baillieu writing in <em>Building Design</em> challenged the designer's claims that the stadium is environmentally sustainable and good value for money. Instead, it is asserted that the reality will be the opposite. In particular, she claimed that:</p>
<ul>
<li>the temporary roof could not be reused to cover the permanent 25,000 seating area &lt;U+2013&gt; given the difference in size;</li>
<li>it is unlikely that the removed seating would be wanted for any other event e.g. the <a href="Commonwealth_Games_2014" title="wikilink">Glasgow Commonwealth games</a>; and</li>
<li>the costs involved in dismantling the stadium &lt;U+2013&gt; and surrounding &quot;pods&quot; &lt;U+2013&gt; has not been factored into the estimated cost.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a></li>

<h2 id="post-olympics">Post-Olympics</h2>
<p>On 12 November 2010, it was announced that two bids had been shortlisted for the stadium post-Olympics.

<h3 id="bids">Bids</h3>
<dl>
<dt>Bid 1: AEG &amp; Tottenham Hotspur</dt>

<p><img src="AEG_&amp;_Tottenham_Hotspur_Olympic_Stadium.jpg" title="fig:Artist&#39;s impression of the proposed new stadium by AEG and Tottenham Hotspur" alt="Artist&#39;s impression of the proposed new stadium by AEG and Tottenham Hotspur" /> These joint bidders had originally expressed individual interest in the venue but submitted a joint bid to take over. AEG is the company that redeveloped the loss making <a href="Millennium_Dome" title="wikilink">Millennium Dome</a> exhibition venue in South East London into the profitable music venue <a href="The_O2_(London)" title="wikilink">The O2</a>. When the formal bidding process opened, little was known of AEG's plans for the stadium, but they were described as among the front-runners of interested parties, along with West Ham.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> On 26 July 2010, it was rumoured that Tottenham might be interested in taking over the stadium post-Games. The club have plans to build a new stadium adjacent to their current home, but the capacity could not reach that of the Olympic Stadium, making a move attractive to the club.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Bid 2: West Ham United and Newham Council</dt>

</dl>
<p>Following the 2010 takeover by <a href="David_Gold_(businessman)" title="wikilink">David Gold</a> and <a href="David_Sullivan_(publisher)" title="wikilink">David Sullivan</a>, the new owners of West Ham United expressed their desire to make the stadium as the club's new home. With <a href="Boris_Johnson" title="wikilink">Boris Johnson</a> expressing his desire for a football team to take over the stadium after the 2012 Olympics and Paralympics this seemed the most likely option.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> At the opening of the formal bid process, West Ham United were considered favourites once they reversed from their initial opposition to keeping the running track as well as planning a &lt;U+00A3&gt;100m conversion to create a 60,000 capacity venue, which would also host international football, international athletics, as well as <a href="Essex_County_Cricket_Club" title="wikilink">Essex County Cricket Club</a>, international <a href="Twenty20" class="uri" title="wikilink">Twenty20</a> cricket matches, <a href="National_Football_League" title="wikilink">NFL</a> games and <a href="Live_Nation" title="wikilink">Live Nation</a> events.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> <img src="West_Ham_United_&amp;_Newham_Council_Olympic_Stadium.jpg" title="fig:Artist&#39;s impression of the proposed redeveloped stadium by West Ham United and Newham Council" alt="Artist&#39;s impression of the proposed redeveloped stadium by West Ham United and Newham Council" /></p>

</dl>
<p>The legacy plan for the stadium originally involved its conversion into a 25,000- to 30,000-seat athletics stadium with a sports training, science and medicine centre following the 2012 Paralympics. Media reports, however, have suggested that several potential tenants were interested in moving to the stadium after the games, among them the <a href="England_and_Wales_Cricket_Board" title="wikilink">England and Wales Cricket Board</a>, along with several London cricket, football and rugby clubs:</p>

<li>The <a href="National_Football_League" title="wikilink">National Football League</a> of <a href="American_football" title="wikilink">American football</a> had been looking at the potential of a franchise in London, and the stadium has been seen as a potential home venue.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> The as-built Olympic Stadium would easily meet the league's requirements for <a href="seating_capacity" title="wikilink">seating capacity</a>, and would have no trouble accommodating an American football field, which is about 5 metres longer than a FIFA-standard <a href="association_football" title="wikilink">association football</a> pitch but nearly 20 metres narrower. Having such a tenant has been seen as one of the ways that the stadium could make maximum surplus after the games, due to interest shown in the <a href="NFL_International_Series" title="wikilink">International series</a> played in London.</li>

<ul>
<li><a href="Leyton_Orient_F.C." title="wikilink">Leyton Orient F.C.</a>: The closest club geographically, Leyton Orient announced in November 2007 that they were in negotiations regarding permanent tenancy after the games.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> This would allow for redevelopment of their existing <a href="Brisbane_Road" title="wikilink">Brisbane Road</a> stadium and provide a regular use for the Olympic and Paralympic venue.</li>

<p>Despite several rounds of negotiations with potential tenants, <a href="LOCOG" class="uri" title="wikilink">LOCOG</a> has elected to adhere to its bid commitment to provide a legacy for athletics at the stadium, with capacity reduced to a more financially viable 25,000.

This in mind, the contract for building the stadium clearly stated that it must stay as a usable athletics track available for competition and training at any time.</p>
<p>After receiving and pre-screening over 100 expressions of interest, the formal bidding process of selecting the post-Olympics user of the stadium opened on 18 August 2010. It was to run until 30 September, after which the OPLC would draw up a shortlist, with a view to selecting a tenant by the end of the financial year, by 31 March.

<p>Tottenham Hotspur F.C. and Leyton Orient applied for a judicial review to overturn the OPLC's decision; however, this appeal was rejected in June 2011.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> Tottenham Hotspur then appealed the decision not to have a review on 29 June 2011.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a></p>
<p>The Olympic Legacy Company announced on 5 July 2011 that an independent review into the awarding of the Olympic Park Stadium to <a href="West_Ham_United" title="wikilink">West Ham United</a> was to be carried out following the discovery on 30 June 2011 that an employee, Dionne Knight had been engaged by West Ham United to carry out consultancy work relating to the stadium without permission of the OPLC. Knight had already declared to the OPLC that she was in a personal relationship with a director of West Ham United, and was suspended whilst a possible conflict of interest was investigated.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> On 22 August 2011, the independent investigation ruled that the process was not compromised and thus the bid process will not be reopened.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a></p>
<p>On 23 August, the day before Tottenham Hotspur were due in court, they staged &quot;intense negotiations&quot; with the office of the Mayor of London, and looked set to drop all claims for a review and be offered funding for their own stadium.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a> However, the next day Tottenham did attend court despite being close to striking a deal about their own stadium, thus allowing West Ham to move into the Olympic Stadium by 2014. Tottenham and Leyton Orient won a review of the decision, being told that they had an arguable case.<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> The review was scheduled to take place on 18 October 2011. Even if Tottenham had abandoned the review, due to being granted a new stadium, Orient were expected to continue, with its owner <a href="Barry_Hearn" title="wikilink">Barry Hearn</a> calling the decision to grant a review &quot;a great day for the little man&quot;.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a> It had been reported that if the judicial review had ordered a re-run of the bidding process then a clause would have been inserted stipulating that the winning bidder must retain a running track within the stadium itself.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="tenancy-bids">Tenancy bids</h3>
<p>On 11 October 2011, the deal to sell the stadium to West Ham collapsed.<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a> West Ham immediately announced plans to become tenants of the stadium.<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a><a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a> On 18 October, <a href="Leyton_Orient_F.C." title="wikilink">Leyton Orient</a> submitted an application to the <a href="Football_League" title="wikilink">Football League</a> for permission for a move to the stadium. Chairman Barry Hearn said, &quot;We are asking for a 25,000-seater stadium and we want to see if we can get around the athletics track. It has to stay, we know that. But can we build up, if not down, and see if it's possible to get it covered while we play?&quot;.<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a></p>
<p>In February 2012 16 parties were interested in the stadium.<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a> By March 2012, West Ham was named as one of the four bidders for the stadium. A decision was to be made by the OPLC in May 2012 and ratified by June,<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a> but the deadline for submitting bids was extended. The OPLC (now known as the London Legacy Development Corporation) aim to have a contract in place by October.<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a> Hearn called for the West Ham bid to be disqualified in April 2012 for not having the permission of the Football League.<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a> The other three bidders were named as:<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a><a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a></p>

<p>In April 2012 the Olympic Park Legacy Company were taken over by the Mayor's office and renamed London Legacy Development Corporation. Margaret Ford would continue her role of chair form the OPLC until the Games are over.<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a></p>
<p>On May 30 Barry Hearn chairman of Leyton Orient said that he would consider a groundshare with West Ham as he agreed with the covering of the track and would now talk with the authorities.<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a> In June 2012 West Ham stated, that despite Hearn saying that he would consider a groudshare, they would not consider this with Leyton Orient. The Club also added that no talks had taken place.<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a> However Hearn in July reliterated the idea claiming that it would be ideal. He also added that it doesn't matter what West Ham think as it was up to the Olympic people to decide as he was applying for tenancy<a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a></p>
<p>In July 2012 the Olympic Park Legacy Company submitted a bid to England Rugby 2015 to host some matches of the <a href="2015_Rugby_World_Cup" title="wikilink">2015 Rugby World Cup</a>. It was mooted that the stadium could hold pool matches and even the third place play&lt;U+2013&gt;off. However the main sticking point would be whether it could meet the <a href="International_Rugby_Board" title="wikilink">International Rugby Board</a>'s demands for the tournament including free from advertising. If successful the stadium would be likely to replace the <a href="Emirates_Stadium" title="wikilink">Emirates Stadium</a>.<a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a> In September 2012 it was confirmed that if the stadium had a tennant by the time the stadia are chosen then it could appear.<a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a></p>
<p>Daniel Moylan chairman of London Legacy Development Corporation was sacked on the 12 September; with other board members being frustrated with his style. Mayor Boris Johnson replaced him.<a href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a> Following the conclusion of the Olympic and Paralympic Games the cost of converting the stadium had risen from &lt;U+00A3&gt;95 million to &lt;U+00A3&gt;130 million. By September 20 the famous pixels had already been removed as they were only on load from Crystal, however according to Paul Kelso &quot;reinstating the system would help establish the Olympic Stadium as a concert venue in competition with Wembley and Twickenham.&quot; Kelso also learnt that the triangular floodlights could be removed when the new roof is fitted as the cost of keeping them is too great. However West Ham want to keep the lights as they would like to keep the stadium looking as it did during the Games, and may consider keeping the wrap on the outside.<a href="#fn67" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a></p>

<p>London originally bid to host the <a href="2015_World_Championships_in_Athletics" title="wikilink">2015 World Athletics Championships</a> using the Olympic Stadium.

However, the stadium had to pull out of the running of hosting the championships due to the uncertainty of the stadium, due to the timing of the announcement of who would operate the stadium after the Olympics, thus gifting Beijing the championships.<a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a> With the issues resolved over the stadium's future, London again used the stadium to bid for the <a href="2017_World_Championships_in_Athletics" title="wikilink">2017 World Athletics Championships</a>.<a href="#fn69" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref69"><sup>69</sup></a> The bid was made official in August with Lord Coe personally submitting the bid a few weeks later at the <a href="2011_World_Championships_in_Athletics" title="wikilink">2011 World Athletic Championships</a> in <a href="Daegu" class="uri" title="wikilink">Daegu</a>.
