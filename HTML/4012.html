<p>&lt;U+00D8&gt;degaard spent his first years in the local sports club Drammen Strong. His <a href="Hans_Erik_&lt;U+00D8&gt;degaard" title="wikilink">father</a>, a former <a href="Association_Football" title="wikilink">footballer</a>, co-founded a football section in the club, and became the coach of his son's team.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a><a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> In 2005, when &lt;U+00D8&gt;degaard was six, his parents and others each invested 50,000 <a href="Norwegian_krone" title="wikilink">kroner</a> so that the local club could refit their gravel field, <em>Kjappen</em>, with <a href="artificial_turf" title="wikilink">artificial turf</a>. This has been cited as crucial for his development, as &lt;U+00D8&gt;degaard spent countless hours on the field.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a><a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>Drammen Strong was twice selected by &lt;U+00D8&gt;degaard to receive a prize of 50,000 kroner (<a href="Euro" title="wikilink">&lt;U+20AC&gt;</a>5,800), when the young player was given the <a href="Statoil" class="uri" title="wikilink">Statoil</a> talent award for April 2014 and for the 2014 season.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> Later, in 2015, Drammen Strong received 250,000 <a href="Norwegian_krone" title="wikilink">kroner</a>, equivalent to approximately &lt;U+20AC&gt;29,000, as a gift from <a href="Str&lt;U+00F8&gt;msgodset_IF" title="wikilink">Str&lt;U+00F8&gt;msgodset IF</a> when &lt;U+00D8&gt;degaard was sold to Real Madrid.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p>In 2009, &lt;U+00D8&gt;degaard joined the youth division of <a href="Str&lt;U+00F8&gt;msgodset_IF" title="wikilink">Str&lt;U+00F8&gt;msgodset</a>.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> He trained and played with older boys.

<p>&lt;U+00D8&gt;degaard began training with the Str&lt;U+00F8&gt;msgodset first team in 2012, aged 13.

<p>In January 2014, it was agreed that 15-year-old &lt;U+00D8&gt;degaard would be part of Str&lt;U+00F8&gt;msgodset's first team in 2014, but no professional contract was signed. The competition rules state that to play in <a href="Tippeligaen" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tippeligaen</a>, players must have a professional contract to be eligble.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> However, the club included &lt;U+00D8&gt;degaard on the &quot;B-list&quot; for amateur players, which made him eligble for up to three matches per season.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> &lt;U+00D8&gt;degaard was unable to train with Str&lt;U+00F8&gt;msgodset in the daytime since he was still in compulsory education.

<p>An article in the <em><a href="Liverpool_Echo" title="wikilink">Liverpool Echo</a></em> described &lt;U+00D8&gt;degaard as &quot;an attack-minded midfielder very much in the modern mould.
