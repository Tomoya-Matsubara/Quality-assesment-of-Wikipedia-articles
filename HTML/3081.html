<p>The <strong>PZL M-17 &quot;Dudu&lt;U+015B&gt; Kud&lt;U+0142&gt;acz&quot;</strong> (initially <strong>EM-5A</strong>) was a <a href="Poland" title="wikilink">Polish</a> twin-boom pusher <a href="general_aviation" title="wikilink">general aviation</a> and trainer aircraft of <a href="1977" class="uri" title="wikilink">1977</a>, which remained a prototype.</p>
<h2 id="design-and-development">Design and development</h2>
<p>The aircraft was an amateur design of a team of students of <a href="Warsaw_University_of_Technology" title="wikilink">Warsaw University of Technology</a> (Politechnika Warszawska) led by <a href="Edward_Marga&lt;U+0144&gt;ski" title="wikilink">Edward Marga&lt;U+0144&gt;ski</a>. It had quite unorthodox layout of a <a href="pusher" class="uri" title="wikilink">pusher</a> with twin booms and very streamlined fuselage. A crew of two sat side-by-side, and had double controls. A tricycle landing gear was retractable.</p>
<p>The plane was designed in 1969-1971. At the design stage it was designated <strong>EM-5A</strong> (EM for Marga&lt;U+0144&gt;ski) and nicknamed Dudu&lt;U+015B&gt; Kud&lt;U+0142&gt;acz (<em>Hairy Dudu&lt;U+015B&gt;</em>). The aircraft factory <a href="PZL-Mielec" class="uri" title="wikilink">PZL-Mielec</a> in <a href="Mielec" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mielec</a> got interested in the design and took over its development, under a designation <strong>PZL M-17</strong>. The design was modified there with help of Marga&lt;U+0144&gt;ski, plastic and duralumin construction was changed to riveted duralumin one, and it was given weaker engine, than designed.</p>
<p>The only prototype was flown on 7 July 1977 by S. Wasil. It was not produced in series. In 1979 the prototype was given to <a href="Rzesz&lt;U+00F3&gt;w_University_of_Technology" title="wikilink">Rzesz&lt;U+00F3&gt;w University of Technology</a>. A shortcoming of a streamlined fuselage was a cramped cockpit, the crewmen were half-laying in a similar way, as in <a href="glider" title="wikilink">gliders</a>.</p>
<p>The plane was a mid-wing monoplane. It had a two-blade wooden propeller and a fuel tank 310 l.</p>
