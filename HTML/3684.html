<p>The <strong>Obama Doctrine</strong> is a term frequently used to describe one or several unifying principles of the foreign policy of <a href="Barack_Obama" title="wikilink">Barack Obama</a>. Unlike the <a href="Monroe_Doctrine" title="wikilink">Monroe Doctrine</a>, the Obama Doctrine is not a specific foreign policy introduced by the executive, but rather a phrase used to describe Obama's general style of foreign policy. This has left journalists and political commentators to speculate on what the exact tenets of an Obama Doctrine might look like. Generally speaking, it is accepted that a central part of such a doctrine would emphasize negotiation and collaboration rather than confrontation and unilateralism in international affairs. This policy has been praised by some as a welcome change from the more interventionist <a href="Bush_Doctrine" title="wikilink">Bush Doctrine</a>.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> Critics, such as former <a href="United_States_Ambassador_to_the_United_Nations" title="wikilink">United States Ambassador</a> to the <a href="United_Nations" title="wikilink">United Nations</a> <a href="John_R._Bolton" title="wikilink">John Bolton</a>, have described it as overly idealistic and na&lt;U+00EF&gt;ve, promoting <a href="appeasement" class="uri" title="wikilink">appeasement</a> of the USA's enemies.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> Others have drawn attention to its radical departure from not only the policies of the Bush administration but many former presidents as well.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a><a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> Meanwhile, additional political pundits have disagreed entirely, accusing Obama of continuing the policies of his predecessor.</p>

In an article in <em><a href="The_Providence_Journal" title="wikilink">The Providence Journal</a></em> from August 28, 2007, <a href="James_Kirchick" title="wikilink">James Kirchick</a> used the term in a derogatory sense, and argued that the Obama Doctrine could be summarised as: &quot;The United States will remain impassive in the face of genocide.&quot; This critique was based on an interview Obama had given to the <a href="Associated_Press" title="wikilink">Associated Press</a> on July 21, where he said that &quot;the United States cannot use its military to solve humanitarian problems&quot; and that &quot;preventing a potential genocide in Iraq isn't a good enough reason to keep U.S. forces there.&quot;<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> <a href="Hilary_Bok" title="wikilink">Hilary Bok</a>, guest-blogging for Andrew Sullivan at <em><a href="The_Atlantic" title="wikilink">The Atlantic</a></em>'s <em>The Daily Dish</em>, refuted Kirchick's representation of Obama's foreign policy views as a distortion. Bok pointed to Obama's use of anti-genocide activist <a href="Samantha_Power" title="wikilink">Samantha Power</a> as a political adviser, and to several interviews the candidate had given expressing concern for the situation in <a href="Darfur" class="uri" title="wikilink">Darfur</a> and elsewhere.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> Later, in a <a href="United_States_presidential_election_debates,_2008" title="wikilink">presidential debate</a> with <a href="John_McCain" title="wikilink">John McCain</a>, Obama stated that the U.S. occasionally would have to &quot;consider it as part of our interests&quot; to carry out <a href="humanitarian_intervention" title="wikilink">humanitarian interventions</a>.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p>Later in the campaign, when asked the question about himself at one of the <a href="Democratic_Party_(United_States)_presidential_debates,_2008" title="wikilink">Democratic presidential debates</a> in March, Obama answered that his doctrine was &quot;not going to be as doctrinaire as the Bush doctrine, because the world is complicated.&quot; He added that the United States would have to &quot;view our security in terms of a common security and a common prosperity with other peoples and other countries.&quot;<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> Later this doctrine was elaborated on as &quot;a doctrine that first ends the politics of fear and then moves beyond a hollow, sloganeering 'democracy promotion' agenda in favor of 'dignity promotion,'&quot; that would target the conditions that promoted <a href="anti-Americanism" class="uri" title="wikilink">anti-Americanism</a> and prevented democracy.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> This policy was quickly criticized by <a href="Dean_Barnett" title="wikilink">Dean Barnett</a> of <em><a href="The_Weekly_Standard" title="wikilink">The Weekly Standard</a></em> as na&lt;U+00EF&gt;ve. Barnett argued that it was not a &quot;climate of fear&quot; that lay behind <a href="Islamic_Extremism" title="wikilink">Islamic extremism</a>, but &quot;something more malicious&quot;.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<p>Then-President <a href="George_W._Bush" title="wikilink">George W.

The comments were interpreted by some in the media, as well as by Obama himself, as a direct criticism of Obama.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> Obama called the comments &quot;a false political attack&quot;, and added that &quot;George Bush knows that I have never supported engagement with terrorists,&quot; while Senator <a href="Joe_Biden" title="wikilink">Joe Biden</a>, Obama's running mate, said that Bush's comments were &quot;demeaning to the presidency of the United States of America&quot;.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> Bush spokeswoman <a href="Dana_Perino" title="wikilink">Dana Perino</a>, pressed for a clarification, stated that Bush's comments were &quot;not specifically pointed to one individual,&quot; and that &quot;all of you who cover these issues... have known that there are many who have suggested these types of negotiations&quot;.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>

On June 4, 2009, the president delivered the speech &quot;A New Beginning&quot; at Cairo University." /> Not long after Obama's <a href="Inauguration_of_Barack_Obama" title="wikilink">inauguration</a> on January 20, 2009, commentators began to speculate on the emergence of a distinct Obama Doctrine in action. A proposal to close the <a href="Guantanamo_Bay_detention_camp" title="wikilink">American detention facility</a> at <a href="Guantanamo_Bay" title="wikilink">Guantanamo Bay</a>, the rejection of the phrase &quot;Global War on Terror&quot;, and the reconciliation with <a href="Russia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Russia</a> through the abandonment of the <a href="anti-ballistic_missile" title="wikilink">anti-ballistic missile</a> program in <a href="Poland" class="uri" title="wikilink">Poland</a> and the <a href="Czech_Republic" title="wikilink">Czech Republic</a>, were taken as clear signs of a reversal of the principles of the Bush administration.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> Critics, such as <a href="Pat_Buchanan" title="wikilink">Pat Buchanan</a>, quickly derided these policies and criticized them for weakening the United States' foreign relations. In an op-ed, Buchanan argued that Obama was &quot;ceding moral high ground to regimes and nations that do not deserve it.&quot;<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
<p>In early April 2009, <a href="Marc_Ambinder" title="wikilink">Marc Ambinder</a> predicted that the president with time would have to take a more pragmatic stance on the legal status of detainees.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> Meanwhile professor of international politics <a href="Daniel_Drezner" title="wikilink">Daniel Drezner</a> suggested the Obama Doctrine was influenced by French philosopher <a href="Charles_de_Secondat,_baron_de_Montesquieu" title="wikilink">Montesquieu</a>, whose thinking in Drezner's words could be crudely summarised &quot;useless conflicts weaken necessary conflicts.&quot; The Obama Doctrine, in Drezner's interpretation, was to abandon foreign policies that had proven fruitless and unpopular, in order to focus on more important and pressing issues.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> On April 16, <a href="E.J._Dionne" title="wikilink">E.J. Dionne</a> wrote a column for <a href="The_Washington_Post" title="wikilink">The Washington Post</a> expressing a highly positive view of what he saw as the Obama Doctrine. The column came in the direct aftermath of the successful <a href="Maersk_Alabama_hijacking" title="wikilink">rescue</a> of Captain Richard Phillips from <a href="Piracy_in_Somalia" title="wikilink">Somali pirates</a>. He defined the doctrine as &quot;a form of realism unafraid to deploy American power but mindful that its use must be tempered by practical limits and a dose of self-awareness.&quot;<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> Dionne also pointed to the influence <a href="Reinhold_Niebuhr" title="wikilink">Reinhold Niebuhr</a> has on Obama, and quoted Niebuhr's warning that some of &quot;the greatest perils to democracy arise from the fanaticism of moral idealists who are not conscious of the corruption of self-interest&quot; and that a &quot;nation with an inordinate degree of political power is doubly tempted to exceed the bounds of historical possibilities.&quot;<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a></p>
<p>Later that month, at the <a href="Summits_of_the_Americas" title="wikilink">Summit of the Americas</a> in <a href="Trinidad_and_Tobago" title="wikilink">Trinidad and Tobago</a>, the President was again asked the question he was asked during the campaign, of defining the Obama Doctrine. The President replied that &quot;the United States remains the most powerful, wealthiest nation on Earth, but we're only one nation, and that the problems that we confront, whether it's drug cartels, climate change, terrorism, you name it, can't be solved just by one country.&quot;<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> In addition, President Obama expressed a desire for the United States to seek friendship with all, harkening back to Franklin Delano Roosevelt's &quot;<a href="Good_Neighbor_Policy" title="wikilink">Good Neighbor Policy</a>.&quot; &quot;I pledge to you that we seek an equal partnership. There is no senior partner and junior partner in our relations,&quot; he said. &quot;There is simply engagement based on mutual respect and common interests and shared values.&quot;<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> Political policy analysts such as Ray Walser lamented this stance, arguing that portraying America as &quot;equal&quot; among the nations of the world would reduce its global stature.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a></p>
<p>Obama later elaborated on his foreign policy views, particularly relating to <a href="List_of_Muslim_majority_countries" title="wikilink">Muslim countries</a>, in a <a href="A_New_Beginning" title="wikilink">high-profile speech</a> given at <a href="Cairo_University" title="wikilink">Cairo University</a> in June, where he called for reform of undemocratic countries from within.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> Obama's efforts to improve foreign relations received praise even from former <a href="Republican_Party_(United_States)" title="wikilink">Republican</a> Senator <a href="Chuck_Hagel" title="wikilink">Chuck Hagel</a>. Meanwhile, foreign policy analyst <a href="Reginald_Dale" title="wikilink">Reginald Dale</a>, believed the President's policy of reconciliation had weakened the country in relation to other countries, such as <a href="Russia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Russia</a>, <a href="People&#39;s_Republic_of_China" title="wikilink">China</a> and <a href="North_Korea" title="wikilink">North Korea</a>.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> The even-handed treatment of all countries was also critiqued by some conservative critics,<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> noting in particular that in calling for all nuclear weapons to be turned aside Obama had placed US and Israeli nuclear programs on the same moral level as Iran's weapons plans.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> There was also concern that Obama did not specifically identify terrorists as a common risk to the US and the Middle East.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> Others criticized Obama for the <em>lack of</em> a well-defined doctrine. <a href="Charles_Krauthammer" title="wikilink">Charles Krauthammer</a> said that &quot;I would say his vision of the world appears to me to be so na&lt;U+00EF&gt;ve that I am not even sure he's able to develop a doctrine.&quot;<ref name="Brinkb<U+00E4>umer&quot;/&gt; <a href="Anders_Stephanson" title="wikilink">Anders Stephanson</a>, professor of history at <a href="Columbia_University" title="wikilink">Columbia University</a>, coming from a different perspective, argued that an overly pragmatic foreign policy, and the absence of an over-arching ideology could facilitate the return of a simplified <a href="American_exceptionalism" title="wikilink">American exceptionalism</a> policy at a later point.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a></p>
<p>The question of the Obama Doctrine once more came to the fore in connection with his acceptance speech at the <a href="Nobel_Peace_Prize" title="wikilink">Nobel Peace Prize</a> ceremony in <a href="Oslo" class="uri" title="wikilink">Oslo</a> in December 2009. The <a href="2009_Nobel_Peace_Prize" title="wikilink">awarding</a> of the peace prize drew a mixture of praise and criticism from all sides of the political spectrum.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> Obama took the opportunity of the speech to address some of this criticism, and argue for the occasional use of force in international relations. &quot;To say that force is sometimes necessary is not a call to cynicism -- it is a recognition of history; the imperfections of man and the limits of reason,&quot; he said.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> According to <a href="John_Dickerson_(journalist)" title="wikilink">John Dickerson</a> of <a href="Slate_(magazine)" title="wikilink">Slate</a>, the President silenced his conservative critics who have labelled him as weak, while maintaining an insistence on diplomatic engagement.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> The speech was generally well received, and was praised by conservative figures in American politics, including <a href="Sarah_Palin" title="wikilink">Sarah Palin</a>, <a href="Newt_Gingrich" title="wikilink">Newt Gingrich</a> and <a href="John_Boehner" title="wikilink">John Boehner</a>.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a></p>
<p>Following the February 2011 <a href="Egyptian_Revolution_of_2011" title="wikilink">revolution in Egypt</a>, Harvard professor <a href="Niall_Ferguson" title="wikilink">Niall Ferguson</a> argued that President Obama's strategic thinking failed to understand the events in the region, writing: &quot;I can think of no more damning indictment of the administration's strategic thinking than this: it never once considered a scenario in which [Egyptian President] Mubarak faced a popular revolt ... All the president and his NSC team seem to have done is to draft touchy-feely speeches like the one he delivered in Cairo early in his presidency.&quot;<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="national-security-strategy">National Security Strategy</h3>
<p>In May 2010, the Obama administration issued a report outlining its <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/rss_viewer/national_security_strategy.pdf"><em>National Security Strategy</em></a> (which is periodically reviewed by the administration in power). The document called for more global engagement and sought to counter fears that the US is at war with Islam. It dropped the Bush era controversy over language such as the phrase &quot;global war on terror&quot; and reference to &quot;Islamic extremism,&quot; adding that &quot;The United States is waging a global campaign against al-Qaeda and its terrorist affiliates. Yet this is not a global war against a tactic - terrorism, or a religion - Islam. We are at war with a specific network, al-Qaeda, and its terrorist affiliates.&quot; It also called for engagement with &quot;hostile nations,&quot; closer relations with China and India, and a focus on strengthening the US economy.</p>
<p>Hillary Clinton, his secretary of state, called democracy and human rights central to the strategy, adding that &quot;We cannot sustain this level of deficit financing and debt without losing our influence, without being constrained about the tough decisions we have to make.&quot;<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a></p>
<p>The document was viewed skeptically in the Muslim world. Pakistan's <em><a href="Dawn" class="uri" title="wikilink">Dawn</a></em> newspaper had an editorial saying that the document gives &quot;room to express scepticism over the new doctrine because we still see the US acting as the world&lt;U+2019&gt;s policeman. Mr Obama&lt;U+2019&gt;s statement that 'the US must reserve the right to act unilaterally if necessary to defend our nation and our interests' is a clear indication that the US has not abandoned its war doctrine as such....Human rights violations committed by the US are countless.&quot;<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> An <a href="Al_Jazeera_English" title="wikilink">Al Jazeera English</a> <a href="blog" class="uri" title="wikilink">blog</a> post said the document &quot;highlights the emphasis and priorities of each president depending on his worldview and US domestic and international standing,&quot; though it added that,<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>A quick review of the National Security Strategy of his predecessors Clinton and Bush, for example, underlines the similarities in structuring and phrasing such documents....The bottom line for the US establishment over the last few decades has remained the same despite (or as a result of) major international transformations. In each and every NSS we are to conclude that isolationism is bad for security and protectionism is terrible for prosperity. Expect the US to go beyond its borders to dominate new frontiers - not only geographically, militarily or economically as a traditional empire, but also cyber, space and other technological frontiers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Within the US, critics have further picked away at the administration's policies. James Carafano of <a href="The_Heritage_Foundation" title="wikilink">The Heritage Foundation</a> noted that Obama's stance is marked by &quot;an overwhelming desire to substitute soft power for hard power&quot; and that the president &quot;has no strategy for when the other side chooses not to cooperate, as in the case of Iran.&quot;<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> A <a href="Washington_Times" title="wikilink">Washington Times</a> editorial criticized the president's strategy, stating that it should not be &quot;some kind of outreach initiative, it is the framing document for America's global safety. The United States cannot effectively combat the root causes of Islamic extremism by ignoring them.&quot;<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a></p>
<p>In President Obama's March 28, 2011 speech on Libya justifying airstrikes against the Gaddafi regime. The President stated the United States can use military force &quot;decisively, and unilaterally when necessary to defend our people, our homeland, our allies, and our core interests.&quot; He also states that where U.S interests are not directly threatened but its ideals and values are or when there is a regional security crisis then the United States is willing to take a leadership role in intervention providing that the burden is shared by an international coalition.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a></p>
<p>As part of his deficit reduction plan, Obama has announced that the growth of security spending will be reduced by four percent from previously planned increases, by holding the spending increases below the rate of inflation.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a><a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a></p>
