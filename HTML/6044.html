<p>The <strong>Western Chalukya Empire</strong> (<a href="Kannada" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kannada</a>:<strong></strong>) ruled most of the <a href="Deccan_Plateau" title="wikilink">western Deccan</a>, <a href="South_India" title="wikilink">South India</a>, between the 10th and 12th centuries. This dynasty is sometimes called the <em>Kalyani Chalukya</em> after its regal capital at Kalyani, today's <a href="Basavakalyan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Basavakalyan</a> in <a href="Karnataka" class="uri" title="wikilink">Karnataka</a> and alternatively the <em>Later Chalukya</em> from its theoretical relationship to the sixth century <a href="Chalukya_dynasty" title="wikilink">Chalukya dynasty</a> of <a href="Badami" class="uri" title="wikilink">Badami</a>. The dynasty is called Western Chalukyas to differentiate from the contemporaneous <a href="Eastern_Chalukyas" title="wikilink">Eastern Chalukyas</a> of <a href="Vengi" class="uri" title="wikilink">Vengi</a>, a separate dynasty. Prior to the rise of these Chalukyas, the <a href="Rashtrakuta" class="uri" title="wikilink">Rashtrakuta</a> empire of <a href="Manyakheta" class="uri" title="wikilink">Manyakheta</a> controlled most of deccan and central India for over two centuries. In 973, seeing confusion in the Rashtrakuta empire after a successful invasion of their capital by the <a href="Paramara" class="uri" title="wikilink">Paramara</a> of <a href="Malwa" class="uri" title="wikilink">Malwa</a>, <a href="Tailapa_II" title="wikilink">Tailapa II</a> a feudatory of the Rashtrakuta ruling from <a href="Bijapur_District" title="wikilink">Bijapur</a> region defeated his overlords and made Manyakheta his capital. The dynasty quickly rose to power and grew into an empire under <a href="Somesvara_I" title="wikilink">Somesvara I</a> who moved the capital to Kalyani.</p>
<p>For over a century, the two empires of southern India, the Western Chalukyas and the <a href="Chola_dynasty" title="wikilink">Chola dynasty</a> of <a href="Tanjore" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tanjore</a> fought many fierce wars to control the fertile region of <a href="Vengi" class="uri" title="wikilink">Vengi</a>. During these conflicts, the Eastern Chalukyas of Vengi, distant cousins of the Western Chalukyas but related to the Cholas by marriage took sides with the Cholas enabling Cholas domination in the region.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a><a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a><a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a><a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> Vast areas between the <a href="Narmada_River" title="wikilink">Narmada River</a> in the north and <a href="Kaveri_River" title="wikilink">Kaveri River</a> in the south came under Chalukya control. During this period the other major ruling families of the Deccan, the <a href="Hoysalas" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hoysalas</a>, the <a href="Seuna_Yadavas_of_Devagiri" title="wikilink">Seuna Yadavas of Devagiri</a>, the <a href="Kakatiya_dynasty" title="wikilink">Kakatiya dynasty</a> and the Southern <a href="Kalachuri" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kalachuri</a>, were subordinates of the Western Chalukyas and gained their independence only when the power of the Chalukya waned during the later half of the twelfth century.</p>
<p>The Western Chalukyas developed an architectural style known today as a transitional style, an architectural link between the style of the early Chalukya dynasty and that of the later Hoysala empire. Most of its monuments are in the districts bordering the Tungabhadra River in central Karnataka. Well known examples are the <a href="Kasivisvesvara_Temple" title="wikilink">Kasivisvesvara Temple</a> at <a href="Lakkundi" class="uri" title="wikilink">Lakkundi</a>, the Mallikarjuna Temple at Kuruvatii, the Kallesvara Temple at Bagali and the <a href="Mahadeva_Temple_(Itagi)" title="wikilink">Mahadeva Temple</a> at Itagi. This was an important period in the development of fine arts in Southern India, especially in literature as the Western Chalukya kings encouraged writers in the native language of <a href="Kannada" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kannada</a>, and <a href="Sanskrit" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sanskrit</a>.</p>
<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<p><img src="Itagi_Mahadeva_temple.JPG" title="fig:Mahadeva Temple at Itagi in Koppal district, Karnataka" alt="Mahadeva Temple at Itagi in Koppal district, Karnataka" /> Knowledge of the Western Chalukyas history has come through examination of the numerous excavated Kannada language <a href="Epigraphy" title="wikilink">inscriptions</a> left by the kings and from the study of important contemporary literary documents in <a href="Western_Chalukya_literature" title="wikilink">Western Chalukya literature</a> such as <em>Gada Yuddha</em> (982) in Kannada by <a href="Ranna" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ranna</a> and <em>Vikramankadeva Charitam</em> (1120) in Sanskrit by <a href="Bilhana" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bilhana</a>.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a><a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> The earliest inscription is dated 957, during the rule of <a href="Tailapa_II" title="wikilink">Tailapa II</a> when the Western Chalukyas were still a feudatory of the Rashtrakutas and Tailapa II governed from Tardavadi in present day <a href="Bijapur_district" title="wikilink">Bijapur district</a>, <a href="Karnataka" class="uri" title="wikilink">Karnataka</a>.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a><a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> The genealogy of the kings of this empire is still debated. One theory, based on contemporary literary and inscriptional evidence plus the finding that the Western Chalukyas employed titles and names commonly used by the early Chalukyas, suggests that the Western Chalukya kings belonged to the same family line as the illustrious Badami <a href="Chalukya" class="uri" title="wikilink">Chalukya</a> dynasty of sixth century<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a><a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> while other Western Chalukya inscriptional evidence indicates they were a distinct line unrelated to the early Chalukyas.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<p>Inscriptional evidence suggests a possible rebellion by a local Chalukya King, Chattigadeva of <a href="Banavasi" class="uri" title="wikilink">Banavasi</a>-12000 province (967), in alliance with local Kadamba chieftains. This rebellion however was unfruitful but paved the way for his successor Tailapa II.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> A few years later, Tailapa II re-established Chalukya rule and defeated the Rashtrakutas during the reign of <a href="Karka_II" title="wikilink">Karka II</a> by timing his rebellion to coincide with the confusion caused in the Rashtrakuta capital of Manyakheta by the invading <a href="Paramara" title="wikilink">Paramaras</a> of Central India in 973.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a><a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> After overpowering the Rashtrakutas, Tailapa II moved his capital to Manyakheta and consolidated the Chalukya empire in the western deccan by subjugating the <a href="Paramara" class="uri" title="wikilink">Paramara</a> and other aggressive rivals and extending his control over the land between the Narmada River and Tungabhadra River.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> However, some inscriptions indicate that Balagamve in Mysore territory may have been a power centre up to the rule of Somesvara I in 1042.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
<p>The intense competition between the kingdoms of the western deccan and those of the <a href="Ancient_Tamil_country" title="wikilink">Tamil kingdoms</a> came to the fore in the eleventh century over the acutely contested fertile river valleys in the <a href="doab" class="uri" title="wikilink">doab</a> region of the <a href="Krishna_River" title="wikilink">Krishna</a> and <a href="Godavari_River" title="wikilink">Godavari River</a> called <a href="Vengi" class="uri" title="wikilink">Vengi</a> (coastal <a href="Andhra_Pradesh" title="wikilink">Andhra Pradesh</a>). The Western Chalukyas and the <a href="Chola_Dynasty" title="wikilink">Chola Dynasty</a> fought many bitter wars over control of this strategic resource. The imperial Cholas gained power during the time of the famous king <a href="Rajaraja_Chola_I" title="wikilink">Rajaraja Chola I</a> and the crown prince <a href="Rajendra_Chola_I" title="wikilink">Rajendra Chola I</a>.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> The Eastern Chalukyas of Vengi were cousins of the Western Chalukyas but became increasingly influenced by the Cholas through their marital ties with the Tamil kingdom. As this was against the interests of the Western Chalukyas, they wasted no time in involving themselves politically and militarily in Vengi. When King <a href="Satyasraya" class="uri" title="wikilink">Satyasraya</a> succeeded Tailapa II to the throne, he was struggling but was able to protect his kingdom from Chola aggression as well as his northern territories in <a href="Konkan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Konkan</a> and <a href="Gujarat" class="uri" title="wikilink">Gujarat</a> although his control over Vengi was nullified.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> His successor, <a href="Jayasimha_II" title="wikilink">Jayasimha II</a>, fought many battles with the Cholas in the south while both powerful kingdoms vying for control over Vengi.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> Jayasimha II subdued the <a href="Paramara" class="uri" title="wikilink">Paramara</a> of central India.  It is known from records that Jayasimha's son, <a href="Somesvara_I" title="wikilink">Somesvara I</a>, moved the Chalukya capital to Kalyani in 1042<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> after getting defeated by the Cholas not less than 5 times and lost some crucial territories<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a><a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> during the ongoing politics of installing a puppet on the Vengi throne.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a><a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> In 1068 Somesvara I, suffering from an incurable illness, drowned himself in the Tungabhadra River (<em>Paramayoga</em>).<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a><a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a><a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> while some argue that the cause of suicide might be humiliation of defeats. Despite many conflicts with the Cholas in the south, Somesvara I had managed to maintain control over the northern territories in <a href="Konkan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Konkan</a>, Gujarat, <a href="Malwa" class="uri" title="wikilink">Malwa</a> and <a href="Kalinga" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kalinga</a> during his rule. His successor, his eldest son <a href="Somesvara_II" title="wikilink">Somesvara II</a>, feuded with his younger brother, <a href="Vikramaditya_VI" title="wikilink">Vikramaditya VI</a>, an ambitious warrior who had initially been governor of <a href="Mysore_State" title="wikilink">Gangavadi</a> in the southern deccan when Somesvara II was the king. Married to a Chola princess (a daughter of Virarajendra Chola), Vikramaditya VI maintained a friendly alliance with them. After the death of the Chola king in 1070, Vikramaditya VI invaded the Tamil kingdom and installed his brother-in-law, <a href="Athirajendra_Chola" title="wikilink">Adhirajendra</a> Chola, on the throne.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> At the same time Vikramaditya VI undermined his brother, Somesvara II, by winning the loyalty of the Chalukya feudatories: the Hoysala, the Seuna and the <a href="Kadambas" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kadambas</a> of Hangal. Anticipating a civil war, Somesvara II sought help from Vikramaditya VI's enemies, Kulothunga Chola I and the Kadambas of <a href="Goa" class="uri" title="wikilink">Goa</a>. In the ensuing conflict of 1076, Vikramaditya VI emerged victorious and proclaimed himself king of the Chalukya empire.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a><a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a></p>
<p>The fifty year reign of Vikramaditya VI, the most successful of the later Chalukya rulers, was an important period in Karnataka's history and is referred to by historians as the &quot;Chalukya Vikrama era&quot;.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a><a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> Not only was he successful in controlling his powerful feudatories in the north and south, he successfully tackled the imperial Cholas whom he defeated in the battle of Vengi in 1118 when Kulothunga Chola I was in his death bed. He could retain this territory for some years before letting it to Vikrama Chola.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a><a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a><a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a><a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> This victory in Vengi reduced the Chola influence in the eastern deccan and made him emperor of territories stretching from the Kaveri River in the south to the Narmada River in the north, earning him the titles <em>Permadideva</em> and <em>Tribhuvanamalla</em> (lord of three worlds). The scholars of his time paid him glowing tributes for his military leadership, interest in fine arts and religious tolerance.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a><a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> Literature proliferated and scholars in Kannada and Sanskrit adorned his court. Poet Bilhana, who immigrated from far away <a href="Kashmir" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kashmir</a>, eulogised the king in his well known work <em>Vikramankadeva Charita</em>.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a><a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> Vikramaditya VI was not only an able warrior but also a devout king as indicated by his numerous inscriptions that record grants made to scholars and centers of religion.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a></p>
<p>The continual warring with the Cholas exhausted the empire, giving their subordinates the opportunity to rebel.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> In the decades after Vikramaditya VI's death in 1126, the empire steadily decreased in size as their powerful feudatories expanded in autonomy and territorial command.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> The time period between 1150 and 1200 saw many hard fought battles between the Chalukyas and their feudatories who were also at war with each other. By the time of <a href="Jagadhekamalla_II" title="wikilink">Jagadhekamalla II</a>, the Chalukyas had lost control of Vengi and his successor, <a href="Tailapa_III" title="wikilink">Tailapa III</a>, was defeated by Kakatiya Prola in 1149.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> Tailapa III was taken captive and later released bringing down the prestige of the Western Chalukyas. Seeing decadence and uncertainty seeping into Chalukya rule, the Hoysalas and <a href="Seuna_Yadavas_of_Devagiri" title="wikilink">Seunas</a> also encroached upon the empire. In any case, in the internecine wars among the small Kannada kingdoms of the Kadambas, Hoysalas, Vaidumbas or Kalachuris, the Chalukya interference was to cause them dearly with these Kingdoms steadily increasing their stock and ultimately the Hoysalas, the Kakatiyas, the Kalachuris and the Seunas consuming the Chalukyas and sending them into oblivion.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a> With the <a href="Kalachuris" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kalachuris</a> occupying the Chalukyan capital for over 35 years followed around AD 1149, after the defeat of <a href="Tailapa_III" title="wikilink">Tailapa III</a> by the occupation of Dharwar in North Central Karnataka by the <a href="Hoysalas" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hoysalas</a> under <a href="Vishnuvardhana" class="uri" title="wikilink">Vishnuvardhana</a> where he based himself with his son <a href="Narasimha_I" title="wikilink">Narasimha I</a> in-charge at the <a href="Hoysala" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hoysala</a> capital Dwarasamudra the Chalukya kingdom was already starting to dissolve, mainly due to incompetency of its rulers after 1120 AD. Hoysala <a href="Narasimha_I" title="wikilink">Narasimha I</a> defeated and killed Tailapa III but was unable to overcome the Kalachuris who were vying for control of the same region. In 1157 the <a href="Kalachuri" title="wikilink">Kalachuris</a> under <a href="Bijjala_II" title="wikilink">Bijjala II</a> captured Kalyani and occupied it for the next twenty years, forcing the Chalukyas to move their capital to Annigeri in the present day <a href="Dharwad_district" title="wikilink">Dharwad district</a>.<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a></p>
<p>The Kalachuris were originally immigrants into the southern deccan from central India and called themselves <em>Kalanjarapuravaradhisavaras</em>.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a> Bijjala II and his ancestors had governed as Chalukya commanders (<em>Mahamandaleshwar</em>) over the Karhad-4000 and Tardavadi-1000 provinces (overlapping region in present day Karnataka and Maharashtra) with Mangalavada<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a> or Annigeri<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a> as their capital. Bijjala II's Chikkalagi record of 1157 calls him <em>Mahabhujabala Chakravarti</em> (&quot;emperor with powerful shoulders and arms&quot;) indicating he no longer was a subordinate of the Chalukyas.<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a> However the successors of Bijjala II were unable to hold on to Kalyani and their rule ended in 1183 when the last Chalukya scion, <a href="Somesvara_IV" title="wikilink">Somesvara IV</a> made a final bid to regain the empire by recapturing Kalyani.<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a> Kalachuri King Sankama was killed by Chalukya general Narasimha in this conflict.<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a><a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a> During this time, Hoysala <a href="Veera_Ballala_II" title="wikilink">Veera Ballala II</a> was growing ambitious and clashed on several occasions with the Chalukyas and the other claimants over their empire. He defeated Chalukya Somesvara IV and Seuna Bhillama V bringing large regions in the Krishna River valley under the Hoysala domains, but was unsuccessful against Kalachuris.<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a> The Seunas under Bhillama V were on an imperialistic expansion too when the Chalukyas regained Kalyani. Their ambitions were temporarily stemmed by their defeat against Chalukya general Barma in 1183 but they later had their vengeance in 1189.</p>
<p>The Cholas under <a href="Kulothunga_Chola_III" title="wikilink">Kulothunga Chola III</a> even collaborated to the herald the dissolution of the <a href="Chalukyas" class="uri" title="wikilink">Chalukyas</a> by aiding <a href="Hoysalas" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hoysalas</a> under <a href="Veera_Ballala_II" title="wikilink">Veera Ballala II</a>, the son-in-law of the Chola monarch, and sounded the death-knell of the <a href="Western_Chalukyas" title="wikilink">Western Chalukyas</a> in a series of wars with <a href="Somesvara_IV" title="wikilink">Somesvara IV</a> between 1185-1190 AD, the last Chalukya king whose territories did not even include the erstwhile Chalukyan capitals Badami, Manyakheta or Kalyani. That was the final dissolution of Chalukyan power<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a> though the <a href="Chalukyas" class="uri" title="wikilink">Chalukyas</a> existed only in name since 1135-1140. In contrast, the Cholas would be stable till 1215 AD, and finally getting consumed by the equally great <a href="Pandiyan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Pandiyan</a> empire and ceasing to exist by 1280 AD.<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a></p>
<p>The overall effort by Somesvara IV to rebuild the Chalukya empire failed and the dynasty was ended by the Seuna rulers who drove Somesvara IV into exile in <a href="Banavasi" class="uri" title="wikilink">Banavasi</a> 1189. After the fall of the Chalukyas, the Seunas and Hoysalas continued warring over the Krishna River region in 1191, each inflicting a defeat on the other at various points in time.<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a></p>

The administration was highly decentralised and feudatory clans such as the <a href="Alupas" class="uri" title="wikilink">Alupas</a>, the Hoysalas, the Kakatiya, the Seuna, the southern Kalachuri and others were allowed to rule their autonomous provinces, paying an annual tribute to the Chalukya emperor.<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a> Excavated inscriptions record titles such as <em>Mahapradhana</em> (Chief minister), <em>Sandhivigrahika</em>, and <em>Dharmadhikari</em> (chief justice). Some positions such as <em>Tadeyadandanayaka</em> (commander of reserve army) were specialised in function while all ministerial positions included the role of <em>Dandanayaka</em> (commander), showing that cabinet members were trained as army commanders as well as in general administrative skills.<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a></p>
<p>The kingdom was divided into provinces such as <em>Banavasi-12000</em>, <em>Nolambavadi-32000</em>, <em>Gangavadi-96000</em>, each name including the number of villages under its jurisdiction. The large provinces were divided into smaller provinces containing a lesser number of villages, as in <em>Belavola-300</em>. The big provinces were called <em>Mandala</em> and under them were <em>Nadu</em> further divided into <em>Kampanas</em> (groups of villages) and finally a <em>Bada</em> (village). A <em>Mandala</em> was under a member of the royal family, a trusted feudatory or a senior official. <a href="Tailapa_II" title="wikilink">Tailapa II</a> himself was in charge of Tardavadi province during the <a href="Rashtrakuta" class="uri" title="wikilink">Rashtrakuta</a> rule. Chiefs of <em>Mandalas</em> were transferable based on political developments. For example, an official named Bammanayya administered Banavasi-12000 under King Somesvara III but was later transferred to Halasige-12000. Women from the royal family also administered <em>Nadus</em> and <em>Kampanas</em>. Army commanders were titled <em>Mahamandaleshwaras</em> and those who headed a <em>Nadu</em> were entitled <em>Nadugouvnda</em>.<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a></p>
<p>The Western Chalukyas minted punch-marked gold <a href="pagoda_(coin)" title="wikilink">pagodas</a> with Kannada and <a href="Devanagari" title="wikilink">Nagari</a> legends<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a> which were large, thin gold coins with several varying punch marks on the obverse side. They usually carried multiple punches of symbols such as a stylised lion, <em>Sri</em> in Kannada,<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a> a spearhead, the king's title, a lotus and others. Jayasimha II used the legend <em>Sri Jaya</em>, Somesvara I issued coins with <em>Sri Tre lo ka malla</em>, Somesvara II used <em>Bhuvaneka malla</em>, Lakshmideva's coin carried <em>Sri Lasha</em>, and Jagadhekamalla II coinage had the legend <em>Sri Jagade</em>. The Alupas, a feudatory, minted coins with the <a href="Kannada" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kannada</a> and <em><a href="Devanagari" title="wikilink">Nagari</a></em> legend <em>Sri Pandya Dhanamjaya</em>.<a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a> <a href="Lakkundi" class="uri" title="wikilink">Lakkundi</a> in <a href="Gadag_district" title="wikilink">Gadag district</a> and Sudi in <a href="Dharwad_district" title="wikilink">Dharwad district</a> were the main mints (<em>Tankhashaley</em>).

The majority of the people lived in villages and worked farming the staple crops of rice, <a href="Pulse_(legume)" title="wikilink">pulses</a>, and cotton in the dry areas and sugarcane in areas having sufficient rainfall, with <a href="areca" class="uri" title="wikilink">areca</a> and <a href="betel" class="uri" title="wikilink">betel</a> being the chief cash crops. The living conditions of the labourers who farmed the land must have been bearable as there are no records of revolts by the landless against wealthy landlords. If peasants were disgruntled the common practice was to migrate in large numbers out of the jurisdiction of the ruler who was mistreating them, thereby depriving him of revenue from their labor.<a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a></p>
<p>Taxes were levied on mining and forest products, and additional income was raised through tolls for the use of transportation facilities.

They served the dual purpose of representing the people before the rulers as well as functioning as state appointees for tax collection and the raising of militias.

<p>The organisation of corporate enterprises became common in the 11th century.<a href="#fn69" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref69"><sup>69</sup></a> Almost all arts and crafts were organised into guilds and work was done on a corporate basis; records do not mention individual artists, sculptors and craftsman. Only in the regions ruled by the Hoysala did individual sculptors etched their names below their creations.<a href="#fn70" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a> Merchants organised themselves into powerful guilds that transcended political divisions, allowing their operations to be largely unaffected by wars and revolutions. Their only threat was the possibility of theft from <a href="Piracy" title="wikilink">brigands</a> when their ships and caravans traveled to distant lands. Powerful South Indian merchant guilds included the <em><a href="Manigramam" class="uri" title="wikilink">Manigramam</a></em>, the <em><a href="Nagarattar" class="uri" title="wikilink">Nagarattar</a></em> and the <em><a href="Anjuvannam" class="uri" title="wikilink">Anjuvannam</a></em>. Local guilds were called <em>nagaram</em>, while the <em><a href="Nanadesis" class="uri" title="wikilink">Nanadesis</a></em> were traders from neighbouring kingdoms who perhaps mixed business with pleasure.

Five hundred such excavated <em>Prasasti</em> inscriptions, with their own flag and the bull as their emblem, record their pride in their business.</p>
<p>Rich traders contributed significantly to the king's treasury through paying import and export taxes.

The decline of Buddhism in South India had begun in the 8th century with the spread of <a href="Adi_Shankara" title="wikilink">Adi Shankara</a>'s <a href="Advaita" class="uri" title="wikilink">Advaita</a> philosophy.<a href="#fn77" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref77"><sup>77</sup></a> The only places of Buddhist worship that remained during the Western Chalukya rule were at <a href="Dambal" class="uri" title="wikilink">Dambal</a> and <a href="Balligavi" class="uri" title="wikilink">Balligavi</a>.<a href="#fn78" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref78"><sup>78</sup></a> There is no mention of religious conflict in the writings and inscriptions of the time which suggest the religious transition was smooth.</p>
<p>Although the origin of the Virashaiva faith has been debated, the movement grew through its association with <a href="Basavanna" class="uri" title="wikilink">Basavanna</a> in the twelfth century.<a href="#fn79" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref79"><sup>79</sup></a><a href="#fn80" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref80"><sup>80</sup></a> Basavanna and other Virashaiva saints preached of a faith without a <a href="caste_system" title="wikilink">caste system</a>.

Also known as the <a href="Lingayats" class="uri" title="wikilink">Lingayats</a> (worshipers of the <em>Linga</em>, the universal symbol of Shiva), these Virashaivas questioned many of the established norms of society such as the belief in rituals and the theory of rebirth and supported the remarriage of widows and the marriage of unwed older women.<a href="#fn81" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref81"><sup>81</sup></a> This gave more social freedom to women but they were not accepted into the priesthood. <a href="Ramanujacharya" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ramanujacharya</a>, the head of the Vaishnava monastery in <a href="Srirangam" class="uri" title="wikilink">Srirangam</a>, traveled to the Hoysala territory and preached the way of devotion (<a href="bhakti" title="wikilink">bhakti marga</a>).

<p>The impact of these religious developments on the culture, literature, and architecture in South India was profound.

The social role of women largely depended on their economic status and level of education in this relatively liberal period. Freedom was more available to women in the royal and affluent urban families. Records describe the participation of women in the fine arts, such as Chalukya queen Chandala Devi's and <a href="Kalachuri" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kalachuri</a> queen Sovala Devi's skill in dance and music. The compositions of thirty <a href="Vachana" class="uri" title="wikilink">Vachana</a> women poets included the work of the 12th century <a href="Virashaiva" class="uri" title="wikilink">Virashaiva</a> mystic Akka Mahadevi whose devotion to the <em><a href="bhakti" class="uri" title="wikilink">bhakti</a></em> movement is well known.<a href="#fn90" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref90"><sup>90</sup></a> Contemporary records indicate some royal women were involved in administrative and martial affairs such as princess Akkadevi, (sister of King Jayasimha II) who fought and defeated rebellious feudals.<a href="#fn91" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref91"><sup>91</sup></a><a href="#fn92" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref92"><sup>92</sup></a> Inscriptions emphasise public acceptance of widowhood indicating that <a href="Sati_(practice)" title="wikilink">Sati</a> (a custom in which a dead man's widow used to <a href="Self-immolation" title="wikilink">immolate</a> herself on her husband&lt;U+2019&gt;s funeral <a href="pyre" class="uri" title="wikilink">pyre</a>) though present was on a voluntary basis.<a href="#fn93" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref93"><sup>93</sup></a> Ritual deaths to achieve salvation were seen among the <a href="Jainism" title="wikilink">Jains</a> who preferred to fast to death (<a href="Sallekhana" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sallekhana</a>), while people of some other communities chose to jump on spikes (<em>Shoolabrahma</em>) or walking into fire on an eclipse.</p>
<p>In a Hindu caste system that was conspicuously present, <a href="Brahmin" title="wikilink">Brahmins</a> enjoyed a privileged position as providers of knowledge and local justice. These Brahmins were normally involved in careers that revolved around religion and learning with the exception of a few who achieved success in martial affairs. They were patronised by kings, nobles and wealthy aristocrats who persuaded learned Brahmins to settle in specific towns and villages by making them grants of land and houses. The relocation of Brahmin scholars was calculated to be in the interest of the kingdom as they were viewed as persons detached from wealth and power and their knowledge was a useful tool to educate and teach ethical conduct and discipline in local communities. Brahmins were also actively involved in solving local problems by functioning as neutral arbiters (<em>Panchayat</em>).<a href="#fn94" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref94"><sup>94</sup></a></p>
<p>Regarding eating habits, Brahmins, Jains, Buddhists and Shaivas were strictly vegetarian while the partaking of different kinds of meat was popular among other communities. Marketplace vendors sold meat from domesticated animals such as goats, sheep, pigs and fowl as well as exotic meat including partridge, hare, wild fowl and boar.<a href="#fn95" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref95"><sup>95</sup></a> People found indoor amusement by attending wrestling matches (<em>Kusti</em>) or watching animals fight such as cock fights and ram fights or by gambling. Horse racing was a popular outdoor past time.<a href="#fn96" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref96"><sup>96</sup></a> In addition to these leisurely activities, festivals and fairs were frequent and entertainment by traveling troupes of acrobats, dancers, dramatists and musicians was often provided.<a href="#fn97" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref97"><sup>97</sup></a></p>
<p>Schools and hospitals are mentioned in records and these were built in the vicinity of temples. Marketplaces served as open air town halls where people gathered to discuss and ponder local issues. Choirs, whose main function was to sing devotional hymns, were maintained at temple expense. Young men were trained to sing in choirs in schools attached to monasteries such as Hindu <em><a href="Matha" class="uri" title="wikilink">Matha</a></em>, Jain <em>Palli</em> and Buddhist <em><a href="Vihara" class="uri" title="wikilink">Vihara</a></em>.<a href="#fn98" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref98"><sup>98</sup></a> These institutions provided advanced education in religion and ethics and were well equipped with libraries (<em>Saraswati Bhandara</em>). Learning was imparted in the local language and in Sanskrit. Schools of higher learning were called <em>Brahmapuri</em> (or <em>Ghatika</em> or <em>Agrahara</em>). Teaching Sanskrit was a near monopoly of Brahmins who received royal endowments for their cause. Inscriptions record that the number of subjects taught varied from four to eighteen.<a href="#fn99" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref99"><sup>99</sup></a> The four most popular subjects with royal students were Economics (<em>Vartta</em>), Political Science (<em>Dandaniti</em>), Veda (<em>trayi</em>) and Philosophy (<em>Anvikshiki</em>), subjects that are mentioned as early as <a href="Kautilya" title="wikilink">Kautilyas</a> <a href="Arthasastra" class="uri" title="wikilink">Arthasastra</a>.</p>

<p>A unique and native form of poetic literature in Kannada called <a href="Vachanas" class="uri" title="wikilink">Vachanas</a> developed during this time.

Some historians assert that ninety percent of their inscriptions are in the Kannada language while the remaining are in Sanskrit language.<a href="#fn139" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref139"><sup>139</sup></a><a href="#fn140" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref140"><sup>140</sup></a> More inscriptions in Kannada are attributed to Vikramaditya VI than any other king prior to the twelfth century,<a href="#fn141" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref141"><sup>141</sup></a> many of which have been deciphered and translated by historians of the Archaeological Survey of India.<a href="#fn142" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref142"><sup>142</sup></a> Inscriptions were generally either on stone (<em>Shilashasana</em>) or copper plates (<em>Tamarashasana</em>). This period saw the growth of Kannada as a language of literature and poetry, impetus to which came from the devotional movement of the Virashaivas (called <a href="Lingayatism" class="uri" title="wikilink">Lingayatism</a>) who expressed their closeness to their deity in the form of simple lyrics called Vachanas.<a href="#fn143" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref143"><sup>143</sup></a> At an administrative level, the regional language was used to record locations and rights related to land grants. When bilingual inscriptions were written, the section stating the title, genealogy, origin myths of the king and benedictions were generally done in Sanskrit. Kannada was used to state terms of the grants, including information on the land, its boundaries, the participation of local authorities, rights and obligations of the grantee, taxes and dues, and witnesses. This ensured the content was clearly understood by the local people without any ambiguity.<a href="#fn144" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref144"><sup>144</sup></a></p>
<p>In addition to inscriptions, chronicles called <em>Vamshavalis</em> were written to provide historical details of dynasties. Writings in Sanskrit included poetry, grammar, lexicon, manuals, rhetoric, commentaries on older works, prose fiction and drama. In Kannada, writings on secular subjects became popular. Some well known works are <em>Chandombudhi</em>, a prosody, and <em>Karnataka Kadambari</em>, a romance, both written by <a href="Nagavarma_I" title="wikilink">Nagavarma I</a>, a lexicon called <em>Rannakanda</em> by <a href="Ranna" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ranna</a> (993), a book on medicine called <em>Karnataka-Kalyanakaraka</em> by Jagaddala Somanatha, the earliest writing on astrology called <em>Jatakatilaka</em> by Sridharacharya (1049), a writing on erotics called <em>Madanakatilaka</em> by Chandraraja, and an encyclopedia called <em>Lokapakara</em> by Chavundaraya II (1025).<a href="#fn145" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref145"><sup>145</sup></a><a href="#fn146" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref146"><sup>146</sup></a></p>
