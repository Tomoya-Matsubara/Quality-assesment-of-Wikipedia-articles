<p><strong>Joshua the <a href="Stylite" class="uri" title="wikilink">Stylite</a></strong> is the author of a <a href="chronicle" class="uri" title="wikilink">chronicle</a> which narrates the history of the war between the <a href="Greek_Empire" title="wikilink">Greeks</a> and <a href="Persian_Empire" title="wikilink">Persians</a> in <a href="502" class="uri" title="wikilink">502</a> - <a href="506" class="uri" title="wikilink">506</a>, and which is one of the earliest and best historical documents preserved in <a href="Syriac" class="uri" title="wikilink">Syriac</a>.</p>
<p>The work owes its preservation to having been incorporated in the third part of the history of <a href="Dionysius_Telmaharensis" title="wikilink">pseudo-Dionysius of Tell-Mahre</a>, and may probably have had a place in the second part of the <em>Ecclesiastical History</em> of <a href="John_of_Ephesus" title="wikilink">John of Ephesus</a>, from whom (as <a href="Nau" class="uri" title="wikilink">Nau</a> has shown) pseudo-Dionysius copied all or most of the matter contained in his third part. The chronicle in question is anonymous, and Nau has shown that the note of a <a href="copyist" class="uri" title="wikilink">copyist</a>, which was thought to assign it to the monk Joshua of Zuqnin near Amid, more probably refers to the compiler of the whole work in which it was incorporated. Anyhow the author was an eyewitness of many of the events which he describes, and must have been living at Edessa during the years when it suffered so severely from the <a href="Greco-Persian_Wars" title="wikilink">Persian War</a>. His view of events is everywhere characterized by his belief in overruling Providence; and as he eulogizes <a href="Flavian_II_of_Antioch" title="wikilink">Flavian II</a>, the <a href="Chalcedon" title="wikilink">Chalcedonian</a> <a href="patriarch_of_Antioch" title="wikilink">patriarch of Antioch</a>, in warmer terms than those in which he praises his great Monophysite contemporaries, <a href="Jacob_of_Serugh" title="wikilink">Jacob of Serugh</a> and <a href="Philoxenus_of_Mabbog" title="wikilink">Philoxenus of Mabbog</a>, he was probably an orthodox <a href="Catholic" class="uri" title="wikilink">Catholic</a>.</p>
<p>The chronicle was first made known by <a href="Joseph_Simon_Assemani" title="wikilink">Assemani</a>'s abridged Latin version (B O i. 260-283) and was edited in 1876 by the <a href="abb&lt;U+00E9&gt;_Martin" title="wikilink">abb&lt;U+00E9&gt; Martin</a> and (with an English translation) by <a href="William_Wright_(Orientalist)" title="wikilink">W Wright</a> in 1882. After an elaborate dedication to a friend the priest and abbot Sergius a brief recapitulation of events from the death of <a href="Julian_the_Apostate" title="wikilink">Julian</a> in <a href="363" class="uri" title="wikilink">363</a> and a fuller account of the reigns of the Persian kings <a href="Peroz_I_of_Persia" title="wikilink">Peroz I</a> (457-484) and <a href="Balash_of_Persia" title="wikilink">Balash</a> (484-488), the writer enters upon his main theme the history of the disturbed relations between the Persian and Greek Empires from the beginning of the reign of <a href="Kavadh_I_of_Persia" title="wikilink">Kavadh I</a> (489-531), which culminated in the great war of 502-506.</p>
<p>From October <a href="494" class="uri" title="wikilink">494</a> to the conclusion of peace near the end of 506, the author gives an annalistic account, with careful specification of dates, of the main events in <a href="Mesopotamia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mesopotamia</a>, the theatre of conflict such as the siege and capture of Amid by the Persians (502-503), their unsuccessful <a href="siege_of_Edessa" title="wikilink">siege of Edessa</a> (503), and the abortive attempt of the Greeks to recover <a href="Amid" class="uri" title="wikilink">Amid</a> (504-505). The work was probably written a few years after the conclusion of the war. The style is graphic and straightforward, and the author was evidently a man of good education and of a simple, honest mind.</p>
