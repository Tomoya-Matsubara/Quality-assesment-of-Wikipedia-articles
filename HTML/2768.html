<p><strong>Maximum likelihood estimation</strong> (<strong>MLE</strong>) is a popular <a href="statistics" title="wikilink">statistical</a> method used for fitting a mathematical model to some data. The modeling of real world data using estimation by maximum likelihood offers a way of tuning the free parameters of the model to provide a good fit.</p>
<p>The method was pioneered by <a href="geneticist" class="uri" title="wikilink">geneticist</a> and <a href="statistician" class="uri" title="wikilink">statistician</a> <a href="Ronald_Fisher" title="wikilink">Sir R.

<p>The method of maximum likelihood corresponds to many well-known estimation methods in statistics. For example, suppose you are interested in the heights of Americans. You have a sample of some number of Americans, but not the entire population, and record their heights. Further, you are willing to assume that heights are <a href="Normal_distribution" title="wikilink">normally distributed</a> with some unknown <a href="mean" class="uri" title="wikilink">mean</a> and <a href="variance" class="uri" title="wikilink">variance</a>. The sample mean is then the maximum likelihood estimator of the population mean, and the sample variance is a close approximation to the maximum likelihood estimator of the population variance (see examples below).</p>
<p>For a fixed set of data and underlying probability model, maximum likelihood picks the values of the model parameters that make the data &quot;more likely&quot; than any other values of the parameters would make them. Maximum likelihood estimation gives a unique and easy way to determine solution in the case of the <a href="normal_distribution" title="wikilink">normal distribution</a> and many other problems, although in very complex problems this may not be the case. If a <a href="uniform_distribution" title="wikilink">uniform</a> <a href="prior_probability" title="wikilink">prior distribution</a> is assumed over the parameters, the maximum likelihood estimate coincides with the <a href="Maximum_a_posteriori" title="wikilink">most probable</a> values thereof.</p>

<p>The following discussion assumes that readers are familiar with basic notions in <a href="probability_theory" title="wikilink">probability theory</a> such as <a href="probability_distribution" title="wikilink">probability distributions</a>, <a href="probability_density_function" title="wikilink">probability density functions</a>, <a href="random_variable" title="wikilink">random variables</a> and <a href="expected_value" title="wikilink">expectation</a>. It also assumes they are familiar with standard basic techniques of maximizing <a href="continuous_function" title="wikilink">continuous</a> <a href="real_number" title="wikilink">real-valued</a> <a href="function_(mathematics)" title="wikilink">functions</a>, such as using <a href="differentiation" class="uri" title="wikilink">differentiation</a> to find a function's <a href="maxima_and_minima" title="wikilink">maxima</a>.</p>
<h2 id="principles">Principles</h2>
<p>Consider a family <span class="math inline"><em>D</em><sub><em>θ</em></sub></span> of probability distributions parameterized by an unknown parameter <span class="math inline"><em>θ</em></span> (which could be vector-valued), associated with either a known <a href="probability_density_function" title="wikilink">probability density function</a> (continuous distribution) or a known <a href="probability_mass_function" title="wikilink">probability mass function</a> (discrete distribution), denoted as <span class="math inline"><em>f</em><sub><em>θ</em></sub></span>. We draw a sample <span class="math inline"><em>x</em><sub>1</sub>, <em>x</em><sub>2</sub>, …, <em>x</em><sub><em>n</em></sub></span> of <em>n</em> values from this distribution, and then using <span class="math inline"><em>f</em><sub><em>θ</em></sub></span> we compute the (multivariate) probability density associated with our observed data, <span class="math inline"><em>f</em><sub><em>θ</em></sub>(<em>x</em><sub>1</sub>, …, <em>x</em><sub><em>n</em></sub>). ​</span></p>
<p>As a function of θ with <em>x</em><sub>1</sub>, ..., <em>x</em><sub><em>n</em></sub> fixed, this is the <a href="likelihood_function" title="wikilink">likelihood function</a></p>
<p><br /><span class="math display">ℒ(<em>θ</em>) = <em>f</em><sub><em>θ</em></sub>(<em>x</em><sub>1</sub>, …, <em>x</em><sub><em>n</em></sub>). ​</span><br /></p>
<p>The method of maximum likelihood estimates θ by finding the value of θ that maximizes <span class="math inline">ℒ(<em>θ</em>)</span>. This is the <strong>maximum likelihood estimator</strong> (<strong>MLE</strong>) of θ:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math display">$$\widehat{\theta} = \underset{\theta}{\operatorname{arg\ max}}\ \mathcal{L}(\theta).$$</span><br /></p>
<p>From a simple point of view, the outcome of a maximum likelihood analysis is the maximum likelihood estimate. This can be supplemented by an approximation for the <a href="covariance_matrix" title="wikilink">covariance matrix</a> of the MLE, where this approximation is derived from the <a href="likelihood_function" title="wikilink">likelihood function</a>. A more complete outcome from a maximum likelihood analysis would be the likelihood function itself, which can be used to construct improved versions of <a href="confidence_interval" title="wikilink">confidence intervals</a> compared to those obtained from the approximate variance matrix. See also <a href="Likelihood_Ratio_Test" title="wikilink">Likelihood Ratio Test</a></p>
<p>Commonly, one assumes that the data drawn from a particular distribution are <a href="independent,_identically_distributed" title="wikilink">independent, identically distributed</a> (iid) with unknown parameters. This considerably simplifies the problem because the likelihood can then be written as a product of <em>n</em> univariate probability densities:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math display">$$\mathcal{L}(\theta) = \prod_{i=1}^n f_{\theta}(x_i)$$</span><br /></p>
<p>and since maxima are unaffected by monotone transformations, one can take the logarithm of this expression to turn it into a sum:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math display">$$\mathcal{L}^*(\theta) = \sum_{i=1}^n \log f_{\theta}(x_i).$$</span><br /></p>
<p>The maximum of this expression can then be found numerically using various <a href="optimization_(mathematics)" title="wikilink">optimization</a> algorithms.</p>
<p>This contrasts with seeking an <a href="unbiased_estimator" title="wikilink">unbiased estimator</a> of θ, which may not necessarily yield the MLE but which will yield a value that (on average) will neither tend to over-estimate nor under-estimate the true value of θ.</p>
<p>Note that the maximum likelihood estimator may not be unique, or indeed may not even exist.</p>
<h2 id="properties">Properties</h2>
<h3 id="functional-invariance">Functional invariance</h3>
<p>The maximum likelihood estimator selects the parameter value which gives the observed data the largest possible probability (or probability density, in the continuous case). If the parameter consists of a number of components, then we define their separate maximum likelihood estimators, as the corresponding component of the MLE of the complete parameter. Consistent with this, if <span class="math inline"><em>θ̂</em></span> is the MLE for <em>θ</em>, and if <em>g</em> is any function of <em>θ</em>, then the MLE for <em>α</em> = <em>g</em>(<em>θ</em>) is by definition</p>
<p><br /><span class="math display"><em>α̂</em> = <em>g</em>(<em>θ̂</em>). ​</span><br /></p>
<p>It maximizes the so-called profile likelihood:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math display"><em>L̄</em>(<em>α</em>) = sup<sub><em>θ</em> : <em>α</em> = <em>g</em>(<em>θ</em>)</sub><em>L</em>(<em>θ</em>).</span><br /></p>
<h3 id="bias">Bias</h3>
<p>For small numbers of samples, the <a href="unbiased_estimator" title="wikilink">bias</a> of maximum-likelihood estimators can be substantial. Consider a case where <em>n</em> tickets numbered from 1 to <em>n</em> are placed in a box and one is selected at random (<em>see <a href="uniform_distribution" title="wikilink">uniform distribution</a></em>). If <em>n</em> is unknown, then the maximum-likelihood estimator of <em>n</em> is the number on the drawn ticket. The <a href="Expected_value" title="wikilink">expected value</a> of the number on the drawn ticket, and therefore the expected value of <em>n</em>, is (<em>n</em>+1)/2. As a result, the maximum likelihood estimator for <em>n</em> will systematically underestimate <em>n</em> by (n-1)/2. In estimating the highest number <em>n</em>, we can only be certain that it is greater than or equal to the drawn ticket number.</p>
<h3 id="asymptotics">Asymptotics</h3>
<p>In many cases, estimation is performed using a set of <a href="independent_identically_distributed" title="wikilink">independent identically distributed</a> measurements. These may correspond to distinct elements from a random <a href="sample_(statistics)" title="wikilink">sample</a>, repeated observations, etc. In such cases, it is of interest to determine the behavior of a given estimator as the number of measurements increases to infinity, referred to as <em><a href="asymptotic" class="uri" title="wikilink">asymptotic</a> behaviour</em>.</p>
<p>Under certain (fairly weak) regularity conditions, which are listed below, the MLE exhibits several characteristics which can be interpreted to mean that it is &quot;asymptotically optimal&quot;. These characteristics include:</p>
<ul>
<li>The MLE is <strong>asymptotically unbiased</strong>, i.e., its <a href="bias_of_an_estimator" title="wikilink">bias</a> tends to zero as the number of samples increases to infinity.</li>
<li>The MLE is <strong>asymptotically <a href="efficiency_(statistics)" title="wikilink">efficient</a></strong>, i.e., it achieves the <a href="Cram&lt;U+00E9&gt;r-Rao_lower_bound" title="wikilink">Cram&lt;U+00E9&gt;r-Rao lower bound</a> when the number of samples tends to infinity. This means that, asymptotically, no unbiased estimator has lower <a href="mean_squared_error" title="wikilink">mean squared error</a> than the MLE.</li>
<li>The MLE is <strong><a href="Estimator#Asymptotic_normality" title="wikilink">asymptotically normal</a></strong>. As the number of samples increases, the distribution of the MLE tends to the Gaussian distribution with mean <span class="math inline"><em>θ</em></span> and covariance matrix equal to the inverse of the <a href="Fisher_information" title="wikilink">Fisher information</a> matrix.</li>
</ul>
<p>Since the Cram&lt;U+00E9&gt;r-Rao bound only speaks of unbiased estimators while the maximum likelihood estimator is usually biased, asymptotic efficiency as defined here does not mean anything: perhaps there are other nearly unbiased estimators with much smaller variance. However, it can be shown that among all regular estimators, which are estimators which have an asymptotic distribution which is not dramatically disturbed by small changes in the parameters, the asymptotic distribution of the maximum likelihood estimator is the best possible, i.e., most concentrated. <a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>Some regularity conditions which ensure this behavior are:</p>
<ol>
<li>The first and second derivatives of the log-likelihood function must be defined.</li>
<li>The Fisher information matrix must not be zero, and must be continuous as a function of the parameter.</li>
<li>The maximum likelihood estimator is consistent.</li>
</ol>
<p>By the mathematical meaning of the word asymptotic, asymptotic properties are properties which only approached in the limit of larger and larger samples: they are approximately true when the sample size is large enough. The theory does not tell us how large the sample needs to be in order to obtain a good enough degree of approximation. Fortunately, in practice they often appear to be approximately true, when the sample size is moderately large. So in practice, inference about the estimated parameters is often based on the asymptotic Gaussian distribution of the MLE. When we do this, the Fisher information matrix is usefully estimated by the <a href="observed_information_matrix" title="wikilink">observed information matrix</a>.</p>
<p>Some cases where the asymptotic behaviour described above does not hold are outlined next.</p>
<p><strong>Estimate on boundary.</strong> Sometimes the maximum likelihood estimate lies on the boundary of the set of possible parameters, or (if the boundary is not, strictly speaking, allowed) the likelihood gets larger and larger as the parameter approaches the boundary. Standard asymptotic theory needs the assumption that the true parameter value lies away from the boundary. If we have enough data, the maximum likelihood estimate will keep away from the boundary too. But with smaller samples, the estimate can lie on the boundary. In such cases, the asymptotic theory clearly does not give a practically useful approximation. Examples here would be variance-component models, where each component of variance, &lt;U+03C3&gt;<sup>2</sup>, must satisfy the constraint &lt;U+03C3&gt;<sup>2</sup> ≥0.</p>
<p><strong>Data boundary parameter-dependent.</strong> For the theory to apply in a simple way, the set of data values which has positive probability (or positive probability density) should not depend on the unknown parameter. A simple example where such parameter-dependence does hold is the case of estimating &lt;U+03B8&gt; from a set of independent identically distributed when the common distribution is <a href="uniform_distribution" title="wikilink">uniform</a> on the range (0,&lt;U+03B8&gt;). For estimation purposes the relevant range of &lt;U+03B8&gt; is such that &lt;U+03B8&gt; cannot be less than the largest observation. In this instance the maximum likelihood estimate exists and has some good behaviour, but the asymptotics are not as outlined above.</p>
<p><strong>Nuisance parameters.</strong> For maximum likelihood estimations, a model may have a number of <a href="nuisance_parameter" title="wikilink">nuisance parameters</a>. For the asymptotic behaviour outlined to hold, the number of nuisance parameters should not increase with the number of observations (the sample size). A well-known example of this case is where observations occur as pairs, where the observations in each pair have a different (unknown) mean but otherwise the observations are independent and Normally distributed with a common variance. Here for 2<em>N</em> observations, there are <em>N</em>+1 parameters. It is well-known that the maximum likelihood estimate for the variance does not converge to the true value of the variance.</p>
<p><strong>Increasing information.</strong> For the asymptotics to hold in cases where the assumption of <a href="independent_identically_distributed" title="wikilink">independent identically distributed</a> observations does not hold, a basic requirement is that the amount of information in the data increases indefinitely as the sample size increases. Such a requirement may not be met if either there is too much dependence in the data (for example, if new observations are essentially identical to existing observations), or if new independent observations are subject to an increasing observation error.</p>

<h3 id="discrete-distribution-finite-parameter-space">Discrete distribution, finite parameter space</h3>
<p>Consider tossing an <a href="unfair_coin" title="wikilink">unfair coin</a> 80 times (i.e., we sample something like <em>x</em><sub>1</sub>=H, <em>x</em><sub>2</sub>=T, ..., <em>x</em><sub>80</sub>=T, and count the number of HEADS &quot;H&quot; observed). Call the probability of tossing a HEAD <em>p</em>, and the probability of tossing TAILS 1-<em>p</em> (so here <em>p</em> is <em>θ</em> above). Suppose we toss 49 HEADS and 31 TAILS, and suppose the coin was taken from a box containing three coins: one which gives HEADS with probability <em>p</em>=1/3, one which gives HEADS with probability <em>p</em>=1/2 and another which gives HEADS with probability <em>p</em>=2/3. The coins have lost their labels, so we don't know which one it was. Using <strong>maximum likelihood estimation</strong> we can calculate which coin has the largest likelihood, given the data that we observed. The likelihood function (defined below) takes one of three values:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math display">$$\begin{matrix}
\Pr(\mathrm{H} = 49 \mid p=1/3) &amp; = &amp; \binom{80}{49}(1/3)^{49}(1-1/3)^{31} \approx 0.000 \\
&amp;&amp;\\
\Pr(\mathrm{H} = 49 \mid p=1/2) &amp; = &amp; \binom{80}{49}(1/2)^{49}(1-1/2)^{31} \approx 0.012 \\
&amp;&amp;\\
\Pr(\mathrm{H} = 49 \mid p=2/3) &amp; = &amp; \binom{80}{49}(2/3)^{49}(1-2/3)^{31} \approx 0.054 \\
\end{matrix}$$</span><br /></p>
<p>We see that the likelihood is maximized when <em>p</em>=2/3, and so this is our <em>maximum likelihood estimate</em> for <em>p</em>.</p>
<h3 id="discrete-distribution-continuous-parameter-space">Discrete distribution, continuous parameter space</h3>
<p>Now suppose we had only one coin but its <em>p</em> could have been any value 0 ≤ <em>p</em> ≤ 1. We must maximize the likelihood function:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math display">$$L(\theta) = f_D(\mathrm{H} = 49 \mid p) = \binom{80}{49} p^{49}(1-p)^{31}$$</span><br /></p>
<p>over all possible values 0 ≤ <em>p</em> ≤ 1.</p>
<p>One way to maximize this function is by <a href="derivative" title="wikilink">differentiating</a> with respect to <em>p</em> and setting to zero:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math display">$$\begin{align}
{0}&amp;{} = \frac{\partial}{\partial p} \left( \binom{80}{49} p^{49}(1-p)^{31} \right) \\
  &amp; {}\propto 49p^{48}(1-p)^{31} - 31p^{49}(1-p)^{30} \\
  &amp; {}= p^{48}(1-p)^{30}\left[ 49(1-p) - 31p \right]  \\
  &amp; {}= p^{48}(1-p)^{30}\left[ 49 - 80p \right]
\end{align}$$</span><br /></p>

<p>which has solutions <em>p</em>=0, <em>p</em>=1, and <em>p</em>=49/80. The solution which maximizes the likelihood is clearly <em>p</em>=49/80 (since <em>p</em>=0 and <em>p</em>=1 result in a likelihood of zero). Thus we say the <em>maximum likelihood estimator</em> for <em>p</em> is 49/80.</p>
<p>This result is easily generalized by substituting a letter such as <em>t</em> in the place of 49 to represent the observed number of 'successes' of our <a href="Bernoulli_trial" title="wikilink">Bernoulli trials</a>, and a letter such as <em>n</em> in the place of 80 to represent the number of Bernoulli trials.

<p><br /><span class="math display">$$f(x_1,\ldots,x_n)=\frac{1}{2\pi\sqrt{\text{det}(\Sigma)}} \exp\left( -\frac{1}{2} \left[x_1-\mu_1,\ldots,x_n-\mu_n\right]\Sigma^{-1}     \left[x_1-\mu_1,\ldots,x_n-\mu_n\right]^T       \right)$$</span><br /></p>
<p>In the two variable case, the joint probability density function is given by:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math display">$$f(x,y) = \frac{1}{2\pi \sigma_x \sigma_y \sqrt{1-\rho^2}} \exp\left[ -\frac{1}{2(1-\rho^2)} \left(\frac{(x-\mu_x)^2}{\sigma_x^2} - \frac{2\rho(x-\mu_x)(y-\mu_y)}{\sigma_x\sigma_y} + \frac{(y-\mu_y)^2}{\sigma_y^2}\right)            \right]$$</span><br /></p>
<p>In this and other cases where a joint density function exists, the likelihood function is defined as above, under <em>Principles</em>, using this density.</p>
