<h2 id="plot">Plot</h2>
<p><a href="Jack_Donaghy" title="wikilink">Jack Donaghy</a> (<a href="Alec_Baldwin" title="wikilink">Alec Baldwin</a>) distracts himself from his romantic problems involving the choice between <a href="CNBC" class="uri" title="wikilink">CNBC</a> host <a href="List_of_30_Rock_characters#Avery_Jessup" title="wikilink">Avery Jessup</a> (<a href="Elizabeth_Banks" title="wikilink">Elizabeth Banks</a>) and his high school sweetheart <a href="List_of_30_Rock_characters#Nancy_Donovan" title="wikilink">Nancy Donovan</a> (<a href="Julianne_Moore" title="wikilink">Julianne Moore</a>) by attempting to resolve a dispute between two janitors, Subhas (Subhas Ramsaywack) and Khonani (Kapil Bawa). Five years ago, Khonani signed a contract to take the 11:30 p.m. janitorial shift from Subhas and informs Jack that he is ready to start at the new time. Jack grants him permission, and calls a meeting with Subhas informing him that Khonani will take over the 11:30 shift. Subhas is not happy with this, so Jack decides to move him to 10:00 p.m., which Subhas has no problem with. As he begins his scheduled shift, Khonani is unhappy with it as there is no trash to pick up because Subhas has already collected it. Khonani complains to Jack about this, resulting in Jack returning Subhas to 11:30, and Khonani leaving NBC to work at a casino.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <a href="Liz_Lemon" title="wikilink">Liz Lemon</a> (<a href="Tina_Fey" title="wikilink">Tina Fey</a>) is distraught to learn that although her writing staff sometimes hang out after work, they never invite her. She tells Jack&lt;U+2014&gt;her boss&lt;U+2014&gt;about this, however, Jack explains that it is best for her to keep her distance from them. Later, Liz's assistant <a href="Cerie_Xerox" title="wikilink">Cerie Xerox</a> (<a href="Katrina_Bowden" title="wikilink">Katrina Bowden</a>) announces that her wedding is back on and that Liz and <a href="Jenna_Maroney" title="wikilink">Jenna Maroney</a> (<a href="Jane_Krakowski" title="wikilink">Jane Krakowski</a>) need to plan a bachelorette party for her. Liz decides to have the party at her apartment and prove to her employees&lt;U+2014&gt;who are invited&lt;U+2014&gt;that she can be fun to be with. At the bachelorette party, staff members <a href="Pete_Hornberger" title="wikilink">Pete Hornberger</a> (<a href="Scott_Adsit" title="wikilink">Scott Adsit</a>), <a href="Frank_Rossitano" title="wikilink">Frank Rossitano</a> (<a href="Judah_Friedlander" title="wikilink">Judah Friedlander</a>), <a href="Toofer_Spurlock" title="wikilink">James &quot;Toofer&quot; Spurlock</a> (<a href="Keith_Powell" title="wikilink">Keith Powell</a>) and <a href="J._D._Lutz" title="wikilink">J. D. Lutz</a> (<a href="John_Lutz_(television_writer)" title="wikilink">John Lutz</a>) show up, but want to leave as they are not having a good time. Liz gets upset about this, calls them out for not inviting her to hang out with them and demands that they apologize to her.</p>
<p>At the same time, <a href="Tracy_Jordan" title="wikilink">Tracy Jordan</a> (<a href="Tracy_Morgan" title="wikilink">Tracy Morgan</a>) is torn between his commitments to his pregnant wife <a href="List_of_30_Rock_characters#Angie_Jordan" title="wikilink">Angie Jordan</a> (<a href="Sherri_Shepherd" title="wikilink">Sherri Shepherd</a>) and his desire to party. He asks <a href="NBC_page" title="wikilink">NBC page</a> <a href="Kenneth_Parcell" title="wikilink">Kenneth Parcell</a> (<a href="Jack_McBrayer" title="wikilink">Jack McBrayer</a>) to assist with any of Angie's needs, however, it becomes too much for Kenneth to deal with and he tells Tracy that he needs to be with her instead. Tracy realizes he needs to be with Angie, but changes his mind and goes to a strip club. After returning home and in order to stay there, Tracy decides to wear his dog's <a href="shock_collar" title="wikilink">shock collar</a> on himself. Tracy then sends Kenneth to take his place at Liz's party. Unbeknownst to Kenneth, Tracy's dog has followed him to the bachelorette party. Kenneth bursts in Liz's home with Tracy's dog right behind him, resulting in the staff hiding from the dog after it attacks them. They all turn to Liz to get rid of the dog, which she at first refuses. She eventually agrees to help them, after they tell her she is a mother figure to them and finding comfort in the title. Liz distracts the dog, and the staff exits her apartment unharmed.</p>

<p>The main plot regarding the two janitors&lt;U+2014&gt;Subhas and Khonani&lt;U+2014&gt;battling for the late-night shift at 11:30 p.m. closely mirrored <a href="2010_Tonight_Show_conflict" title="wikilink">the feud</a> between television hosts <a href="Jay_Leno" title="wikilink">Jay Leno</a> and <a href="Conan_O&#39;Brien" title="wikilink">Conan O'Brien</a> over the hosting job of <em><a href="The_Tonight_Show" title="wikilink">The Tonight Show</a></em>.

<h2 id="reception">Reception</h2>
<p>In its original American broadcast, &quot;Khonani&quot; was watched by 5.182 million households, according to the <a href="Nielsen_ratings" title="wikilink">Nielsen ratings</a> system. It achieved a 2.5 rating/7 share in the key 18-49 year-old demographic.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> This means that it was seen by 2.5 percent of all 18&lt;U+2013&gt;49 years olds, and 7 percent of all 18&lt;U+2013&gt;49 year olds watching television at the time of the broadcast. This was an increase from the previous episode, &quot;<a href="Lee_Marvin_vs._Derek_Jeter" title="wikilink">Lee Marvin vs. Derek Jeter</a>&quot;, that aired the same day of the week, which was watched by 4.216 million American viewers.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a></p>
<p>The episode received generally mixed critical reception. <em><a href="The_A.V._Club" title="wikilink">The A.V.

He explained that when he first learned that the show would tackle the Jay Leno and Conan O'Brien situation &quot;I felt a surge of excitement and optimism. I thought the writers would come up with a smart new angle to attack the imbroglio&quot;, but after the airing he noted the janitor plot only hampered the episode. Rabin, however, enjoyed Tracy's actions in the episode, commenting that it &quot;provided a showcase for some great Tracy Morgan non-sequiturs&quot;.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> Emily Exton of <em><a href="Entertainment_Weekly" title="wikilink">Entertainment Weekly</a></em> also found &quot;Khonani&quot; the weaker of the two episodes, and also believed that the &quot;late-night jokes felt tired&quot;.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> Television columnist Alan Sepinwall of <em><a href="The_Star-Ledger" title="wikilink">The Star-Ledger</a></em> disliked the episode, and as a result he noted in his recap that he would remove <em>30 Rock</em> from the rotation of shows for which he always did detailed reviews.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> Willa Paskin of <em><a href="New_York_(magazine)" title="wikilink">New York</a></em> magazine wrote had the show make reference to the Leno and O'Brien debacle a few months ago &quot;this would have been a cutting-edge satire ... Now, not so much.&quot;<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> Jason Hughes of <a href="TV_Squad" title="wikilink">TV Squad</a> remarked that the writing in &quot;Khonani&quot; was sharp, though added that &quot;for some reason&quot; the episode &quot;didn't ring nearly as sharp or funny as many others. I think it was a lot of unfulfilled potential.&quot;<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> Sean Gandert of <em><a href="Paste_(magazine)" title="wikilink">Paste</a></em> magazine deemed this episode disappointing, but proclaimed &quot;it was still entertaining enough.&quot;<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a></p>
<p><a href="James_Poniewozik" title="wikilink">James Poniewozik</a> of <em><a href="Time_(magazine)" title="wikilink">Time</a></em> observed, &quot;NBC's public troubles have been <em>30 Rock</em>{{'}}s greatest blessing this season, providing it with satiric fodder from <em>The Jay Leno Show</em> to the Comcast acquisition. The show may not be the best sitcom on TV now, but it's definitely the best work of NBC-criticism.&quot; In regards to the main plot, he said it &quot;could have done even more with the premise of the Jaypocalypse re-enacted with janitors, but it gets a lot of credit for the inspired idea.&quot;<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> <a href="IGN" class="uri" title="wikilink">IGN</a> contributor Robert Canning gave the episode an 8.3 out of 10 rating, writing that the janitor plot &quot;came at a perfect time&quot; in regards to the Leno and O'Brien controversy. He, however, did not like the other two plots, noting they were &quot;less impressive&quot;.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a> Meredith Blake from the <em><a href="Los_Angeles_Times" title="wikilink">Los Angeles Times</a></em> said that the Khonani and Subhas plot was &quot;supremely clever and self-referential&quot;, and that the show's take on it was &quot;decidedly neutral, albeit very funny&quot;.<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a></p>
