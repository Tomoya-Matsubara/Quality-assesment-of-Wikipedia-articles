<p><strong><em>The General in His Labyrinth</em></strong> (original Spanish title: <strong></strong>) is a novel by the <a href="Colombia" title="wikilink">Colombian</a> writer and <a href="Nobel_Prize_for_Literature" title="wikilink">Nobel laureate</a> <a href="Gabriel_Garc&lt;U+00ED&gt;a_M&lt;U+00E1&gt;rquez" title="wikilink">Gabriel Garc&lt;U+00ED&gt;a M&lt;U+00E1&gt;rquez</a>. It is a fictionalized account of the last days of <a href="Sim&lt;U+00F3&gt;n_Bol&lt;U+00ED&gt;var" title="wikilink">Sim&lt;U+00F3&gt;n Bol&lt;U+00ED&gt;var</a>, liberator and leader of <a href="Gran_Colombia" title="wikilink">Gran Colombia</a>. First published in 1989, the book traces Bol&lt;U+00ED&gt;var's final journey from <a href="Bogot&lt;U+00E1&gt;" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bogot&lt;U+00E1&gt;</a> to the Caribbean coastline of <a href="Colombia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Colombia</a> in his attempt to leave South America for exile in Europe. In this <a href="dictator_novel" title="wikilink">dictator novel</a> about a continental hero, &quot;despair, sickness, and death inevitably win out over love, health, and life&quot;.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> Breaking with the traditional heroic portrayal of Bol&lt;U+00ED&gt;var , Garc&lt;U+00ED&gt;a M&lt;U+00E1&gt;rquez depicts a pathetic protagonist, a prematurely aged man who is physically ill and mentally exhausted.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> The story explores the labyrinth of Bol&lt;U+00ED&gt;var's life through the narrative of his memories.</p>
<p>Following the success of others of his works such as <em><a href="One_Hundred_Years_of_Solitude" title="wikilink">One Hundred Years of Solitude</a></em> and <em><a href="Love_in_the_Time_of_Cholera" title="wikilink">Love in the Time of Cholera</a></em>, Garc&lt;U+00ED&gt;a M&lt;U+00E1&gt;rquez decided to write about the &quot;Great Liberator&quot; after reading an unfinished novel about Bol&lt;U+00ED&gt;var by his friend <a href="&lt;U+00C1&gt;lvaro_Mutis" title="wikilink">&lt;U+00C1&gt;lvaro Mutis</a>. He borrowed the setting&lt;U+2014&gt;Bol&lt;U+00ED&gt;var's voyage down the <a href="Magdalena_River" title="wikilink">Magdalena River</a> in 1830&lt;U+2014&gt;from Mutis. After two years of research that encompassed the extensive memoirs of Bol&lt;U+00ED&gt;var's Irish <a href="aide-de-camp" class="uri" title="wikilink">aide-de-camp</a>, <a href="Daniel_Florencio_O&#39;Leary" title="wikilink">Daniel Florencio O'Leary</a>, as well as numerous other historical documents and consultations with academics, Garc&lt;U+00ED&gt;a M&lt;U+00E1&gt;rquez published his novel about the last seven months of Bol&lt;U+00ED&gt;var's life.</p>
<p>Its mixture of genres makes <em>The General in His Labyrinth</em> difficult to classify, and commentators disagree over where it lies on the scale between novel and historical account. Garc&lt;U+00ED&gt;a M&lt;U+00E1&gt;rquez's insertion of interpretive and fictionalized elements&lt;U+2014&gt;some dealing with Bol&lt;U+00ED&gt;var's most intimate moments&lt;U+2014&gt;caused outrage in parts of <a href="Latin_America" title="wikilink">Latin America</a> when the book was released. Many prominent Latin American figures believed that the novel damaged the reputation of one of the region's most important historic figures and portrayed a negative image to the outside world. Others saw <em>The General in His Labyrinth</em> as a tonic for Latin American culture and a challenge to the region to deal with its problems.</p>

At the time, Garc&lt;U+00ED&gt;a M&lt;U+00E1&gt;rquez was interested in writing about the Magdalena River because he knew the area intimately from his childhood.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> Two years after reading , Garc&lt;U+00ED&gt;a M&lt;U+00E1&gt;rquez asked Mutis for his permission to write a book on Bol&lt;U+00ED&gt;var's last voyage.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>Garc&lt;U+00ED&gt;a M&lt;U+00E1&gt;rquez believed that most of the information available on Bol&lt;U+00ED&gt;var was one-dimensional: &quot;No one ever said in Bol&lt;U+00ED&gt;var's biographies that he sang or that he was constipated ... but historians don't say these things because they think they are not important.&quot;<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> In the epilogue to the novel, Garc&lt;U+00ED&gt;a M&lt;U+00E1&gt;rquez writes that he researched the book for two years; the task was difficult, both because of his lack of experience in conducting historical research,<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> and the lack of documentary evidence for the events of the final period of Bol&lt;U+00ED&gt;var's life.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p>Garc&lt;U+00ED&gt;a M&lt;U+00E1&gt;rquez researched a wide variety of historical documents, including Bol&lt;U+00ED&gt;var's letters, nineteenth-century newspapers, and <a href="Daniel_Florencio_O&#39;Leary" title="wikilink">Daniel Florencio O'Leary</a>'s 34 volumes of memoirs. He engaged the help of various experts, among them geographer Gladstone Oliva; historian and fellow Colombian Eugenio Guti&lt;U+00E9&gt;rrez Celys, who had co-written a book called  with historian Fabio Puyo; and astronomer Jorge Perezdoval&lt;U+2014&gt;Garc&lt;U+00ED&gt;a M&lt;U+00E1&gt;rquez used an inventory drawn up by Perezdoval to describe which nights Bol&lt;U+00ED&gt;var spent under a full moon. Garc&lt;U+00ED&gt;a M&lt;U+00E1&gt;rquez also worked closely with Antonio Bol&lt;U+00ED&gt;var Goyanes, a distant relative of Bol&lt;U+00ED&gt;var, during the extensive editing of the book.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="historical-context">Historical context</h3>
<p>The novel is set in 1830, at the tail end of the initial campaign to secure Latin America's independence from Spain. Most of <a href="Hispanic_America" title="wikilink">Spanish America</a> had gained independence by this date; only <a href="Cuba" class="uri" title="wikilink">Cuba</a> and <a href="Puerto_Rico" title="wikilink">Puerto Rico</a> remained under Spanish rule.</p>
<p>Within a few decades of <a href="Christopher_Columbus" title="wikilink">Christopher Columbus</a>'s landing on the coast of what is now <a href="Venezuela" class="uri" title="wikilink">Venezuela</a> in 1498, South America had been effectively conquered by Spain and <a href="Portugal" class="uri" title="wikilink">Portugal</a>. By the beginning of the nineteenth century, several factors affected Spain's control over its colonies: <a href="Napoleon" class="uri" title="wikilink">Napoleon</a>'s <a href="Peninsular_War" title="wikilink">invasion of Spain</a> in 1808, the abdication of <a href="Charles_IV_of_Spain" title="wikilink">Charles IV</a>, <a href="Ferdinand_VII" title="wikilink">Ferdinand VII</a>'s renouncement of his right to succeed, and the placement of <a href="Joseph_Bonaparte" title="wikilink">Joseph Bonaparte</a> on the Spanish throne.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> The colonies were virtually cut off from Spain, and the <a href="American_revolution" title="wikilink">American</a> and <a href="French_revolution" title="wikilink">French</a> Revolutions inspired many <a href="Creole_peoples" title="wikilink">creoles</a>&lt;U+2014&gt;American-born descendants of Spanish settlers&lt;U+2014&gt;to take advantage of Spanish weakness. As a result, Latin America was run by independent <em><a href="juntas" class="uri" title="wikilink">juntas</a></em> and colonial self-governments.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<p>The early 1800s saw the first attempts at securing liberation from Spain, which were led in northern South America by Bol&lt;U+00ED&gt;var. He and the independence movements won numerous battles in Venezuela, <a href="United_Provinces_of_New_Granada" title="wikilink">New Granada</a> and present-day <a href="Ecuador" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ecuador</a> and <a href="Peru" class="uri" title="wikilink">Peru</a>. His dream of uniting the Spanish American nations under one central government was almost achieved. However, shortly after the South American colonies became independent of Spain, problems developed in the capitals, and civil wars were sparked in some provinces; Bol&lt;U+00ED&gt;var lost many of his supporters and fell ill. Opposition to his presidency continued to increase, and in 1830, after 11 years of rule, he resigned as president of Gran Colombia.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>

<h2 id="plot-summary">Plot summary</h2>
<p><img src="TheGeneralinhisLabyrinth_alt.png" title="fig:" alt="" /> The novel is written in the third-person with flashbacks to specific events in the life of Sim&lt;U+00F3&gt;n Bol&lt;U+00ED&gt;var, &quot;the General&quot;. It begins on May 8, 1830 in <a href="Santa_Fe_de_Bogot&lt;U+00E1&gt;" title="wikilink">Santa Fe de Bogot&lt;U+00E1&gt;</a>. The General is preparing for his journey towards the port of <a href="Cartagena,_Colombia" title="wikilink">Cartagena de Indias</a>, intending to leave Colombia for Europe. Following his resignation as President of <a href="Gran_Colombia" title="wikilink">Gran Colombia</a>, the people of the lands he liberated have now turned against him, scrawling anti-Bol&lt;U+00ED&gt;var graffiti and throwing waste at him. The General is anxious to move on, but has to remind the Vice-President-elect, General <a href="Domingo_Caycedo" title="wikilink">Domingo Caycedo</a>, that he has yet to receive a valid passport to leave the country. The General leaves Bogot&lt;U+00E1&gt; with the few officials still faithful to him, including his confidante and aide-de-camp, Jos&lt;U+00E9&gt; Palacios. At the end of the first chapter, the General is referred to by his full title, General Sim&lt;U+00F3&gt;n Jos&lt;U+00E9&gt; Antonio de la Sant&lt;U+00ED&gt;sima Trinidad Bol&lt;U+00ED&gt;var y Palacios, for the only time in the novel.</p>
<p>On the first night of the voyage, the General stays at <a href="Facatativ&lt;U+00E1&gt;" class="uri" title="wikilink">Facatativ&lt;U+00E1&gt;</a> with his entourage, which consists of Jos&lt;U+00E9&gt; Palacios, five aides-de-camp, his clerks, and his dogs. Here, as throughout the journey that follows, the General's loss of prestige is evident; the downturn in his fortunes surprises even the General himself. His unidentified illness has led to his physical deterioration, which makes him unrecognizable, and his aide-de-camp is constantly mistaken for the Liberator.</p>
<p>After many delays, the General and his party arrive in <a href="Honda,_Tolima" title="wikilink">Honda</a>, where the Governor, Posada Guti&lt;U+00E9&gt;rrez, has arranged for three days of fiestas. On his last night in Honda, the General returns late to camp and finds one of his old friends, Miranda Lyndsay, waiting for him. The General recalls that fifteen years ago, she had learned of a plot against his life and had saved him. The following morning, the General begins the voyage down the Magdalena River. Both his physical debilitation and pride are evident as he negotiates the slope to the dock: he is in need of a sedan chair but refuses to use it. The group stays a night in <a href="Puerto_Real_de_la_Cruz" title="wikilink">Puerto Real</a>, where the General claims he sees a woman singing during the night. His aides-de-camp and the watchman conduct a search, but they fail to uncover any sign of a woman having been in the vicinity.</p>
<p>The General and his entourage arrive at the port of <a href="Santa_Cruz_de_Mompox" title="wikilink">Mompox</a>. Here they are stopped by police, who fail to recognize the General. They ask for his passport, but he is unable to produce one. Eventually, the police discover his identity and escort him into the port. The people still believe him to be the President of Gran Colombia and prepare banquets in his honor; but these festivities are wasted on him due to his lack of strength and appetite. After several days, the General and his entourage set off for <a href="Turbaco" class="uri" title="wikilink">Turbaco</a>.</p>
<p>The group spend a sleepless night in <a href="Barranca_Nueva" title="wikilink">Barranca Nueva</a> before they arrive in Turbaco. Their original plan was to continue to Cartagena the following day, but the General is informed that there is no available ship bound for Europe from the port and that his passport still has not arrived. While staying in the town, he receives a visit from General <a href="Mariano_Montilla" title="wikilink">Mariano Montilla</a> and a few other friends. The deterioration of his health becomes increasingly evident&lt;U+2014&gt;one of his visitors describes his face as that of a dead man.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> In Turbaco, the General is joined by General Daniel Florencio O'Leary and receives news of ongoing political machinations: <a href="Joaqu&lt;U+00ED&gt;n_Mosquera" title="wikilink">Joaqu&lt;U+00ED&gt;n Mosquera</a>, appointed successor as President of Gran Colombia, has assumed power but his legitimacy is still contested by Cartagena. The General recalls that his &quot;dream began to fall apart on the very day it was realized&quot;.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<p>The General finally receives his passport, and two days later he sets off with his entourage for Cartagena and the coast, where more receptions are held in his honor. Throughout this time, he is surrounded by women but is too weak to engage in sexual relations. The General is deeply affected when he hears that his good friend and preferred successor for the presidency, <a href="Antonio_Jos&lt;U+00E9&gt;_de_Sucre" title="wikilink">Field Marshall Sucre</a>, has been ambushed and assassinated.</p>
<p>The General is now told by one of his aides-de-camp that General <a href="Rafael_Urdaneta" title="wikilink">Rafael Urdaneta</a> has taken over the government in Bogot&lt;U+00E1&gt;, and there are reports of demonstrations and riots in support of a return to power by Bol&lt;U+00ED&gt;var. The General's group travel to the town of <a href="Soledad,_Atl&lt;U+00E1&gt;ntico" title="wikilink">Soledad</a>, where he stays for more than a month, his health declining further. In Soledad, the General agrees to see a physician for the first time.</p>
<p>The General never leaves South America. He finishes his journey in <a href="Santa_Marta" title="wikilink">Santa Marta</a>, too weak to continue and with only his doctor and his closest aides by his side. He dies in poverty, a shadow of the man who liberated much of the continent.</p>

<p>The leading character in the novel is &quot;the General&quot;, also called &quot;the Liberator&quot;. Garc&lt;U+00ED&gt;a M&lt;U+00E1&gt;rquez only once names his <a href="protagonist" class="uri" title="wikilink">protagonist</a> as Sim&lt;U+00F3&gt;n Bol&lt;U+00ED&gt;var, the famous historical figure, whose full title was <a href="Sim&lt;U+00F3&gt;n_Bol&lt;U+00ED&gt;var" title="wikilink"> General Sim&lt;U+00F3&gt;n Jos&lt;U+00E9&gt; Antonio de la Sant&lt;U+00ED&gt;sima Trinidad Bol&lt;U+00ED&gt;var y Palacios</a>, on whom the General&lt;U+2019&gt;s character is based. The novel's portrait of a national and Latin American hero, which challenges the historical record, provoked outrage in some quarters on its publication.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
<p>At the beginning of the novel, the General is 46 years old<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> and slowly dying on his last journey to the port of <a href="Cartagena,_Colombia" title="wikilink">Cartagena de Indias</a>, where he plans to set sail for Europe. As Palencia-Roth notes, &quot;Bol&lt;U+00ED&gt;var is cast here not only as a victim but as an agent of Latin America's tragic political flaws&quot;.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> The fortunes of the historical Sim&lt;U+00F3&gt;n Bol&lt;U+00ED&gt;var began to decline in 1824 after the victory of his general <a href="Antonio_Jos&lt;U+00E9&gt;_de_Sucre" title="wikilink">Antonio Jos&lt;U+00E9&gt; de Sucre</a> at <a href="Battle_of_Ayacucho" title="wikilink">Ayacucho</a>. The novel draws on the fact that the historical Bol&lt;U+00ED&gt;var never remarried after the death of his wife, Mar&lt;U+00ED&gt;a Teresa Rodr&lt;U+00ED&gt;guez del Toro y Alayza. Garc&lt;U+00ED&gt;a M&lt;U+00E1&gt;rquez uses other documented facts as starting points for his fictional portrait of Bol&lt;U+00ED&gt;var&lt;U+2013&gt;for example, his dedication to the army above all else, his premature aging,<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> and his bad temper. Of the latter, Bol&lt;U+00ED&gt;var's <a href="aide-de-camp" class="uri" title="wikilink">aide-de-camp</a> O'Leary once remarked that &quot;his imperious and impatient temperament would never tolerate the smallest delay in the execution of an order&quot;.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a></p>
<p>In an interview with Mar&lt;U+00ED&gt;a Elvira Samper, Garc&lt;U+00ED&gt;a M&lt;U+00E1&gt;rquez has admitted that his portrayal of Bol&lt;U+00ED&gt;var is partly a self-portrait. He identifies with Bol&lt;U+00ED&gt;var in many ways, since their method of controlling their anger is the same and their philosophical views are similar: neither &quot;pays much attention to death, because that distracts one from the most important thing: what one does in life&quot;.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="josu00e9-palacios">Jos&lt;U+00E9&gt; Palacios</h3>
<p>The novel begins with the name of Jos&lt;U+00E9&gt; Palacios,<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> who, here as with the historical figure of the same name, is Bol&lt;U+00ED&gt;var's &quot;long-serving mayordomo&quot;.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> As literary critic Seymour Menton observes, Palacios's &quot;total identification with Bol&lt;U+00ED&gt;var constitutes the novel's frame&quot;.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> Palacios constantly waits on the General, and at certain times he alone is allowed in the General's room. He has learned to live with his master's unpredictability and does not presume to read his thoughts.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> Born a slave, the character is six years younger than the General, and has spent his entire life in his service. Throughout the novel, Palacios provides the General with clarifications or reminders of dates and events during the General's time of disillusion. According to one critic, Palacios's ability to recall past events in Bol&lt;U+00ED&gt;var's life is essential for Garc&lt;U+00ED&gt;a M&lt;U+00E1&gt;rquez&lt;U+2019&gt;s recreation of the character, as it allows the Bol&lt;U+00ED&gt;var of official history to be placed within the context of everyday life.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="manuela-su00e1enz">Manuela S&lt;U+00E1&gt;enz</h3>
<p>Manuela S&lt;U+00E1&gt;enz is the General's long-time lover, his last since the death of his wife, 27 years earlier. Her character is based on Sim&lt;U+00F3&gt;n Bol&lt;U+00ED&gt;var's historical mistress <a href="Manuela_S&lt;U+00E1&gt;enz" title="wikilink">Do&lt;U+00F1&gt;a Manuela S&lt;U+00E1&gt;enz de Thorne</a>, whom Bol&lt;U+00ED&gt;var dubbed &quot;the liberator of the liberator&quot; after she helped save him from an assassination attempt on the night of September 25, 1828.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> Garc&lt;U+00ED&gt;a M&lt;U+00E1&gt;rquez's fictional portrait stimulated a reassessment of this historical figure, who is increasingly seen, according to Venezuelan historian Denzil Romero, &quot;not just as a mistress but as the intelligent, independent, forceful woman she was&quot;.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> In the novel, she is described as &quot;the bold Quite&lt;U+00F1&gt;a who loved him but was not going to follow him to his death&quot;.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> The General leaves Manuela S&lt;U+00E1&gt;enz behind, but throughout the novel he writes to her on his journey.

The historical <a href="Antonio_Jos&lt;U+00E9&gt;_de_Sucre" title="wikilink">Antonio Jos&lt;U+00E9&gt; de Sucre</a>, the Field Marshal of <a href="Battle_of_Ayacucho" title="wikilink">Ayacucho</a>, had been the most trusted general of Sim&lt;U+00F3&gt;n Bol&lt;U+00ED&gt;var.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> Garc&lt;U+00ED&gt;a M&lt;U+00E1&gt;rquez describes him as &quot;intelligent, methodical, shy, and superstitious&quot;.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> The Field Marshal is married to and has a daughter with Do&lt;U+00F1&gt;a Mariana Carcel&lt;U+00E9&gt;n. In the first chapter of the novel, the General asks Sucre to succeed him as President of the Republic, but he rejects the idea. One of the reasons Sucre gives is that he wishes only to live his life for his family. Also at the beginning of the novel, Sucre's death is foreshadowed. Sucre tells the General that he plans on celebrating the Feast of Saint Anthony in Quito with his family. When the General hears that Sucre has been assassinated in Berruecos on his way back to <a href="Quito" class="uri" title="wikilink">Quito</a>, he vomits blood.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="minor-characters">Minor characters</h3>
<p>The novel revolves around the fictionalized figure of Bol&lt;U+00ED&gt;var and includes many minor characters who are part of the General's travelling party, whom he meets on his journey or who come to him in his memories and dreams of his past. Sometimes they are identified by particular quirks or tied to small but significant events. They include, for instance, General Jos&lt;U+00E9&gt; Mar&lt;U+00ED&gt;a Carre&lt;U+00F1&gt;o, a member of the entourage, whose right arm was amputated after a combat wound,<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> and who once revealed a military secret by talking in his sleep.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> At other times, they are prostheses for the General's now failing powers: Fernando, for example, the General's nephew, is &quot;the most willing and patient of the General's many clerks&quot;,<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> and the General wakes him &quot;at any hour to have him read aloud from a dull book or take notes on urgent extemporizations&quot;.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> One of the least developed of the minor characters is the General's wife, Mar&lt;U+00ED&gt;a Teresa Rodr&lt;U+00ED&gt;guez del Toro y Alayza, who had died, readers are told, in mysterious circumstances shortly after their marriage. The General has &quot;buried her at the bottom of a water-tight oblivion as a brutal means of living without her&quot;;<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a> she only fleetingly enters his memories in the book's last chapter.<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> According to Menton, she is &quot;upstaged&quot; by Manuela S&lt;U+00E1&gt;enz, whose later history Garc&lt;U+00ED&gt;a M&lt;U+00E1&gt;rquez recounts as if she instead were the General's widow.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a> Mar&lt;U+00ED&gt;a Teresa's death, however, marked the General's &quot;birth into history&quot;,<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a> and he has never tried to replace her.</p>

<h3 id="politics">Politics</h3>
<p>In <em>The General in His Labyrinth</em>, Garc&lt;U+00ED&gt;a M&lt;U+00E1&gt;rquez voices his political views through the character of the General. For example, Alvarez Borland points out that in the scene where the General responds to the French diplomat, his words closely reflect Garc&lt;U+00ED&gt;a M&lt;U+00E1&gt;rquez&lt;U+2019&gt;s 1982 Nobel Address.<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a> The diplomat is critical of the barbarism in Latin America and the brutal means used in attempting to achieve independence. Bol&lt;U+00ED&gt;var replies by pointing out that Europe had centuries to progress to its current state, and that South America should be left to experience its &quot;Middle Ages in peace&quot;.<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a> Similarly Garc&lt;U+00ED&gt;a M&lt;U+00E1&gt;rquez remarks in his Nobel Speech that &lt;U+201C&gt;venerable Europe would perhaps be more perceptive if it tried to see <a href="Latin_America" title="wikilink">Latin America</a> in its own past. If only it recalled that London took three hundred years to build its first city wall ...&quot;.<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a></p>
<p>The novel was published in 1989, when the Soviet Union was disintegrating and the political map was being radically redrawn. Reviewing <em>The General in His Labyrinth</em> in 1990, the novelist <a href="Margaret_Atwood" title="wikilink">Margaret Atwood</a> pointed to another instance of Garc&lt;U+00ED&gt;a M&lt;U+00E1&gt;rquez raising political issues through the character of the General. He has him tell his aide that the United States is &quot;omnipotent and terrible, and that its tale of liberty will end in a plague of miseries for us all&quot;.<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a> Atwood noted the contemporary relevance of this sentiment, since &quot;the patterns of Latin American politics, and of United States intervention in them, have not changed much in 160 years.&quot;<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a> She suggested that Garc&lt;U+00ED&gt;a M&lt;U+00E1&gt;rquez&lt;U+2019&gt;s fictionalization of Bol&lt;U+00ED&gt;var is a lesson &quot;for our own turbulent age ... Revolutions have a long history of eating their progenitors.&quot;<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a> The central character is a man at the end of his life, who has seen his revolution and dream of a united Latin America fail.</p>
<h3 id="figural-labyrinth">Figural labyrinth</h3>
<p>According to literary critic David Danow, the labyrinth of the novel's title refers to &quot;a series of labyrinths that are contingent upon matters of history, geography, and biography ... that consistently and conclusively result in a dead end&quot;<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a>&lt;U+2014&gt;in this case, the General's own death. His final voyage along the Magdalena River involves a doubling back and forth from one location to another that leads him and his followers nowhere. The labyrinth does not lead to happiness; instead, it results in madness from constant pondering on the past and an impossible future. At the end of his life, the General is reduced to a spectre of his former self. The labyrinth also recalls the <a href="labyrinth" class="uri" title="wikilink">labyrinth</a> built to imprison the <a href="minotaur" class="uri" title="wikilink">minotaur</a> in <a href="Greek_mythology" title="wikilink">Greek mythology</a>, and the endless travelling and searching of ancient Greek heroes. In Danow's view, &quot;The Labyrinth mirrors the wanderings and travails of the hero in search for meaning and resolution to the vicissitudes of life&quot;.<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a></p>
<p>Garc&lt;U+00ED&gt;a M&lt;U+00E1&gt;rquez depicts the General's body itself as a labyrinth. His doctor observes that &quot;everything that enters the body, adds weight, and everything that leaves it is debased.&quot;<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a> The General's body is described as a &quot;labyrinth coming to a literal dead end&quot;.<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a> The labyrinth is also expressed in geographical and architectural imagery. The country's destiny is imagined as a break-up, a folding of north into south. The seas offer the hope of a new life and a new world, but the closer the General is to Colombia, the less chance he has of moving on.<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a> Garc&lt;U+00ED&gt;a M&lt;U+00E1&gt;rquez describes buildings as &quot;daunting, reverberating (if not exactly reiterating) with the echoes of a bloody past&quot;.<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a> The portrayal of the General's world as a labyrinth is underlined by his constant return to cities and towns he has visited before: each location belongs to the past as well as to the present. <em>The General in his Labyrinth</em> blurs the lines between perdition in a man-made world and wandering in the natural world.<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="fate-and-love">Fate and love</h3>
<p>Bol&lt;U+00ED&gt;var's fate is known from the beginning, and Garc&lt;U+00ED&gt;a M&lt;U+00E1&gt;rquez constantly uses images which foreshadow this ending. For instance, a clock stuck at seven minutes past one, the exact time of the General's death, appears repeatedly in the novel. This sense of fate is introduced in the <a href="epigraph_(literature)" title="wikilink"> epigraph</a>,<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a> which comes from a letter written by the historical Bol&lt;U+00ED&gt;var to General <a href="Francisco_de_Paula_Santander" title="wikilink">Santander</a> on August 4, 1823: &quot;It seems that the devil controls the business of my life.&quot;<a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a> As Palencia-Roth points out, the word used for devil here is  rather than the more familiar .  derives from the Greek word <a href="demon" title="wikilink"></a>, which can equally mean divine power, fate, or destiny. Accordingly, the General succumbs to his fate and accepts his death as destiny.<a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a></p>
<p>The theme of love is central to the novel. Bol&lt;U+00ED&gt;var had a reputation as a womanizer, and books have been written on his philandering; but as depicted in this novel, during the last seven months of his life, the General could no longer engage in the activities that had fueled that reputation.<a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a> Garc&lt;U+00ED&gt;a M&lt;U+00E1&gt;rquez mentions a woman every few pages, many of whom are his own invention, exploring love through the General's memories. Palencia-Roth notes that the presence of these women &quot;allows a labyrinthine exploration of his life before his final journey&quot;<a href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a> and suggests that Garc&lt;U+00ED&gt;a M&lt;U+00E1&gt;rquez uses love as a barometer of the General's heart and health. Although Bol&lt;U+00ED&gt;var is usually thought to have died from <a href="tuberculosis" class="uri" title="wikilink">tuberculosis</a>, Palencia-Roth believes that for the author, the General dies from the lack of love.<a href="#fn67" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a> &quot;Despised by many of his countrymen, abandoned by all but a few aides and associates, left&lt;U+2014&gt;during the final seven months of his life&lt;U+2014&gt;without even the companionship of his longtime mistress <a href="Manuela_Saenz" title="wikilink">Manuela Saenz</a>, Bol&lt;U+00ED&gt;var had no choice but to die of a broken heart.&quot;<a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="numbers-and-religious-symbols">Numbers and religious symbols</h3>
<p>Numbers are an important symbolic aspect of the novel. The book is divided into eight chapters, almost all of equal length, which represent the eight-year love affair between the General and Manuela S&lt;U+00E1&gt;enz. The General's last hours are marked by an octagonal clock.<a href="#fn69" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref69"><sup>69</sup></a> Allusions to the number three are even more common in the novel. As Garc&lt;U+00ED&gt;a M&lt;U+00E1&gt;rquez scholar Isabel Rodr&lt;U+00ED&gt;guez Vergara notes, the number three&lt;U+2014&gt;the <a href="Trinity" class="uri" title="wikilink">Trinity</a> which occupies a vital place in the symbology of the Catholic Mass&lt;U+2014&gt;is repeated 21 times throughout the book. She quotes Mircea Eliade: &quot;In the novel it represents a symbolic sacrifice aimed at redeeming humankind&lt;U+2014&gt;that of Bol&lt;U+00ED&gt;var, a misunderstood redeemer sacrificed by his own people.&quot; <a href="#fn70" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a></p>
<p>Rodr&lt;U+00ED&gt;guez Vergara observes that the General is like a supernatural being, simultaneously dying and being surrounded by symbolic circumstances such as rain, fiestas, and the plague. The novel begins with Bol&lt;U+00ED&gt;var immersed in purifying waters, in a state of ecstasy and meditation that suggests a priestly ritual. One of the women with whom the General sleeps, Queen Marie Louise, is described as a virgin with the profile of an idol&lt;U+2014&gt;an allusion to the <a href="Virgin_Mary" title="wikilink">Virgin Mary</a>. The General rides a mule into the last towns on his journey towards death, echoing Christ's entry into Jerusalem.<ref name="rodr<U+00ED>guez vergara&quot; /&gt; He dies of mysterious and unknown causes, and the people burn his belongings in fear of catching his illness. In Rodr&lt;U+00ED&gt;guez Vergara's view, &quot;Bol&lt;U+00ED&gt;var was sacrificed as a scapegoat to purge the guilt of the community.&quot;<ref name="rodr<U+00ED>guez vergara&quot; /&gt;</p>
<p>Ren&lt;U+00E9&gt; Girard has interpreted the recurrence of rain in the novel as one of the purifying rituals the community must undergo in order to wash away the contagion of violence.<ref name="qtdrodr<U+00ED>guez vergara&quot; /&gt; The fiestas may represent another ritual of purification and also symbolize war.<ref name="rodr<U+00ED>guez vergara&quot; /&gt; Fiestas are held to honour the General when he arrives at a town, but at other times, political demonstrations against the General are mistaken for a fiesta. According to Rodr&lt;U+00ED&gt;guez Vergara, this shows how &quot;information is manipulated&quot; and &quot;depicts an atmosphere where fiesta and war are synonymous&quot;.<ref name="rodr<U+00ED>guez vergara&quot; /&gt;</p>
<h3 id="melancholy-and-mourning">Melancholy and mourning</h3>
<p>Latin American cultural theorist Carlos J. Alonso, drawing on <a href="Sigmund_Freud" title="wikilink"> Freudian</a> theory, argues that the novel is essentially a therapeutic device, designed to help move Latin America past its problematic experience of modernity. He compares this to the way the healing state of mourning replaces grief in the process of recovering from a death. Both activities are mechanisms for dealing with loss. Alonso believes that <em>The General in his Labyrinth</em>, by almost entirely centering the novel on the General's death, forces the reader to confront the horror of this process.<a href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a> In Alonso's view, the reader is meant to pass from &quot;a melancholy relationship vis-a-vis the figure of Bol&lt;U+00ED&gt;var to a relationship that has the therapeutic qualities of mourning instead&quot;.<a href="#fn72" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref72"><sup>72</sup></a></p>
<p>Latin America's history and culture, Alonso suggests, began with the loss of Bol&lt;U+00ED&gt;var's dream of a united continent and as a result has developed under a melancholy shadow ever since.<a href="#fn73" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref73"><sup>73</sup></a> Thus, by forcing the reader to return to the origin of modernity in Latin America and confront its death in the most horrific way, Garc&lt;U+00ED&gt;a M&lt;U+00E1&gt;rquez compels the reader to move from melancholy to mourning, &quot;so that the phantom of the lost object of modernity may cease to rule the libidinal economy of Spanish American cultural discourse and historical life&quot;.<a href="#fn74" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref74"><sup>74</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="challenging-history">Challenging history</h3>
<p>Garc&lt;U+00ED&gt;a M&lt;U+00E1&gt;rquez comments on the nature of historical fact by drawing attention to the way history is written.<a href="#fn75" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref75"><sup>75</sup></a> The novel recreates a time in Bol&lt;U+00ED&gt;var's life that has no historical precedent, as there is no record of the last 14 days of his life. In Garc&lt;U+00ED&gt;a M&lt;U+00E1&gt;rquez's account readers observe Bol&lt;U+00ED&gt;var intimately, seeing his human qualities. In the view of critic Isabel Alvarez Borland, by choosing to fictionalize a national hero in this way, Garc&lt;U+00ED&gt;a M&lt;U+00E1&gt;rquez is challenging the claim of official history to represent the truth.<a href="#fn76" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref76"><sup>76</sup></a> In the &quot;My Thanks&quot; section of the novel, Garc&lt;U+00ED&gt;a M&lt;U+00E1&gt;rquez asserts ironically that what he is writing is more historical than fictional, and he discusses his own historical methodology in detail. By posing in the role of a historian, he challenges the reliability of written history from within the writing process.<a href="#fn77" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref77"><sup>77</sup></a> According to Alvarez Borland, this serves to &quot;remind us that a claim to truth is not the property of any text; rather it is the result of how a historian (as a reader) interprets the facts&quot;.<a href="#fn78" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref78"><sup>78</sup></a></p>
<p><em>The General in His Labyrinth</em> also confronts the methods of official historians by using an oral style of narration. The narration can be considered an oral account in that it is woven from the verbal interactions of everyday people.<a href="#fn79" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref79"><sup>79</sup></a> Alvarez Borland explains that the advantage of this technique, as discussed by Walter Ong, is that &quot;the orality of any given culture, residing in the unwritten tales of its peoples, possesses a spontaneity and liveliness which is lost once this culture commits its tales to writing.&quot; <a href="#fn80" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref80"><sup>80</sup></a> The oral style of narration therefore provides a truthfulness which official history lacks. Alvarez Borland concludes that <em>The General in His Labyrinth</em> suggests new ways of writing the past; it takes account of voices that were never written down as part of official history.<a href="#fn81" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref81"><sup>81</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="comparisons-with-other-garcu00eda-mu00e1rquez-novels">Comparisons with other Garc&lt;U+00ED&gt;a M&lt;U+00E1&gt;rquez novels</h2>
<p>In an interview published in the Colombian weekly  on March 20, 1989, Garc&lt;U+00ED&gt;a M&lt;U+00E1&gt;rquez told Mar&lt;U+00ED&gt;a Elvira Samper, &quot;At bottom, I have written only one book, the same one that circles round and round, and continues on.&quot;<a href="#fn82" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref82"><sup>82</sup></a> Palencia-Roth suggests that this novel is a &quot;labyrinthine summation ... of Garc&lt;U+00ED&gt;a M&lt;U+00E1&gt;rquez's long-standing obsessions and ever-present topics: love, death, solitude, power, fate&quot;.<a href="#fn83" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref83"><sup>83</sup></a></p>
<p>Like the Patriarch in Garc&lt;U+00ED&gt;a M&lt;U+00E1&gt;rquez's <em><a href="The_Autumn_of_the_Patriarch" title="wikilink">The Autumn of the Patriarch</a></em>, Bol&lt;U+00ED&gt;var was an absolute dictator.<a href="#fn84" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref84"><sup>84</sup></a> The Patriarch is never identified by name; Bol&lt;U+00ED&gt;var, too, is identified chiefly by his title.<a href="#fn85" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref85"><sup>85</sup></a> Bol&lt;U+00ED&gt;var also invites comparison with Colonel Aureliano Buend&lt;U+00ED&gt;a in <em><a href="One_Hundred_Years_of_Solitude" title="wikilink">One Hundred Years of Solitude</a></em>: both characters believe the wars they have waged have been fruitless and overwhelming, and both face numerous attempts on their lives, but eventually die of natural causes.<a href="#fn86" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref86"><sup>86</sup></a> In his belief that life is controlled by fate, the General resembles Buend&lt;U+00ED&gt;a in <em>One Hundred Years of Solitude</em> and Santiago Nasar in <em><a href="Chronicle_of_a_Death_Foretold" title="wikilink">Chronicle of a Death Foretold</a></em>.<a href="#fn87" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref87"><sup>87</sup></a></p>
<p>Palencia-Roth notes that critics have been struck by the humorless elegiac style of <em>The General in His Labyrinth</em>;<a href="#fn88" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref88"><sup>88</sup></a> its dark mood and somber message is similar to that of <em>The Autumn of the Patriarch</em>. Love is a theme common to both <em>Love in the Time of Cholera</em> and <em>The General in His Labyrinth</em>, but the latter is considered a tragedy. These two novels have been used to demonstrate the range of Garc&lt;U+00ED&gt;a M&lt;U+00E1&gt;rquez's work.<a href="#fn89" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref89"><sup>89</sup></a></p>
<p>Isabel Alvarez Borland, in her essay &quot;The Task of the Historian in &quot;, claims that &quot; ... while  is in many ways a continuation of Garc&lt;U+00ED&gt;a M&lt;U+00E1&gt;rquez's criticism of Latin America's official history seen in his earlier works, the novel contrasts sharply with his previous fictions&quot;.<a href="#fn90" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref90"><sup>90</sup></a> In <em>Chronicle of a Death Foretold</em>, according to Alvarez Borland, the narrator challenges the truth of official language. However, <em>The General in His Labyrinth</em> &quot;differs from these earlier works in employing narrative strategies which seek to answer in a much more overt and didactic fashion questions that the novel poses about history&quot;.<a href="#fn91" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref91"><sup>91</sup></a></p>
<p>In a summary of Edward Hood's book , Garc&lt;U+00ED&gt;a M&lt;U+00E1&gt;rquez is characterized as an author who uses repetition and  (intertextuality between the works of a single author<a href="#fn92" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref92"><sup>92</sup></a>) extensively in his fiction, including in <em>The General in His Labyrinth</em>. Hood points out some obvious examples of repetition in Garc&lt;U+00ED&gt;a M&lt;U+00E1&gt;rquez's works: the themes of solitude in <em>One Hundred Years of Solitude</em>, tyranny in <em>Autumn of the Patriarch</em>, and the desire for a unified continent expressed by Bol&lt;U+00ED&gt;var in <em>The General in His Labyrinth</em>.<a href="#fn93" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref93"><sup>93</sup></a> An example of intertextuality can be seen in the repetition of patterns between books.

In his review of <em>The General in his Labyrinth</em>, Selden Rodman hesitated to call it a novel, since it was so heavily researched, giving Bol&lt;U+00ED&gt;var's views &quot;on everything from life and love to his chronic constipation and dislike of tobacco smoke&quot;.<a href="#fn95" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref95"><sup>95</sup></a> On the other hand, reviewer Robert Adams suggested that Garc&lt;U+00ED&gt;a M&lt;U+00E1&gt;rquez had &quot;improved on history&quot;.<a href="#fn96" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref96"><sup>96</sup></a> According to critic Donald L.

Garc&lt;U+00ED&gt;a M&lt;U+00E1&gt;rquez's Bol&lt;U+00ED&gt;var is a man &quot;who wanders naked through the house, suffers constipation, uses foul language, and much more besides.&quot;<a href="#fn100" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref100"><sup>100</sup></a> He argues that documentation does not support many of these details. Bushnell suggests, however, that the fact that the novel is not entirely historically accurate does not necessarily distinguish it from the work of professional historians. The main difference, Bushnell believes, is that Garc&lt;U+00ED&gt;a M&lt;U+00E1&gt;rquez's work &quot;is far more readable&quot; than a pure history.<a href="#fn101" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref101"><sup>101</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="reception">Reception</h2>
<p><em>The General in His Labyrinth</em> was relatively poorly received by the general public in the United States, despite the praise of critics. Critic <a href="Ilan_Stavans" title="wikilink">Ilan Stavans</a>, who himself praised the book as &quot;one of the writer's most sophisticated and accomplished&quot;, attributes this to the novel's time period and to its profusion of historical information, neither of which proved attractive to English-speaking readers.<a href="#fn102" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref102"><sup>102</sup></a> Isabel Alvarez Borland notes that, like Stavans, &quot;critics in the United States have largely celebrated Garc&lt;U+00ED&gt;a M&lt;U+00E1&gt;rquez's portrait of this national hero and considered it a tour de force&quot;;<a href="#fn103" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref103"><sup>103</sup></a> but she also observes that in Latin America the book received more mixed reviews, ranging from &quot;outrage to unqualified praise&quot;.<a href="#fn104" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref104"><sup>104</sup></a></p>
<p>The novel generated huge controversy in Latin America: some Venezuelan and Colombian politicians described its depiction of Bol&lt;U+00ED&gt;var as &quot;profane&quot;.<a href="#fn105" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref105"><sup>105</sup></a> According to Stavans, they accused Garc&lt;U+00ED&gt;a M&lt;U+00E1&gt;rquez of &quot;defaming the larger-than-life reputation of a historical figure who, during the nineteenth century, struggled to unite the vast Hispanic world&quot;.<a href="#fn106" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref106"><sup>106</sup></a> The novel's publication provoked outrage from many Latin American politicians and intellectuals because its portrayal of the General is not the saintly image long cherished by many.<a href="#fn107" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref107"><sup>107</sup></a> Mexico's ambassador to Austria, Francisco Cuevas Cancino, wrote a damning letter, which was widely publicized in Mexico City, objecting to the portrayal of Bol&lt;U+00ED&gt;var. He stated: &quot;The novel is plagued with errors of fact, conception, fairness, understanding of the <a href="historical" class="uri" title="wikilink">historical</a> moment and ignorance of its consequences ... It has served the enemies of Latin America, who care only that they can now denigrate Bol&lt;U+00ED&gt;var, and with him all of us.&quot;<a href="#fn108" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref108"><sup>108</sup></a> Even the novel's admirers, such as the leading Venezuelan diplomat and writer <a href="Arturo_Uslar_Pietri" title="wikilink">Arturo Uslar Pietri</a>, worried that some facts were stretched. Garc&lt;U+00ED&gt;a M&lt;U+00E1&gt;rquez believes, however, that Latin America has to discover the General's labyrinth to recognize and deal with its own maze of problems.<a href="#fn109" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref109"><sup>109</sup></a></p>
<p>More positively, <a href="Nelson_Bocaranda" title="wikilink">Nelson Bocaranda</a>, a Venezuelan TV commentator, considers the novel to be a tonic for Latin American culture: &quot;people here saw a Bol&lt;U+00ED&gt;var who is a man of flesh and bones just like themselves&quot;. Mexican author <a href="Carlos_Fuentes" title="wikilink">Carlos Fuentes</a> agrees with Bocaranda saying: &quot;What comes across beautifully and poignantly in this book is a man dealing with the unknown <a href="world_of_democratic_ideas" title="wikilink">world of democratic ideas</a>&quot;.<a href="#fn110" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref110"><sup>110</sup></a> Garc&lt;U+00ED&gt;a M&lt;U+00E1&gt;rquez realistically portrays a ridiculous figure trapped in a labyrinth, magnifying the General's defects, and presenting an image of Bol&lt;U+00ED&gt;var contrary to that instilled in classrooms. However, the novel also depicts Bol&lt;U+00ED&gt;var as an idealist and political theorist who predicted many problems that would obstruct Latin American advancement in the future. Garc&lt;U+00ED&gt;a M&lt;U+00E1&gt;rquez depicts a figure who was aware of the racial and social friction in Latin American society, feared debt, and warned against economic irresponsibility. He has the General warn his aide-de-camp, Iturbide, against the future interference of the United States in the internal affairs of Latin America.<a href="#fn111" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref111"><sup>111</sup></a></p>
<p>Novelist and critic <a href="Barbara_Mujica" title="wikilink">Barbara Mujica</a> comments that the book's English translator, <a href="Edith_Grossman" title="wikilink">Edith Grossman</a>, fully captures the multiple levels of meaning of the text, as well as Garc&lt;U+00ED&gt;a M&lt;U+00E1&gt;rquez's modulations in tone.<a href="#fn112" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref112"><sup>112</sup></a> Garc&lt;U+00ED&gt;a M&lt;U+00E1&gt;rquez himself has admitted that he prefers his novels in their English translations.<a href="#fn113" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref113"><sup>113</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="publication-history">Publication history</h2>
<p>The original Spanish version of <em>The General in His Labyrinth</em> was published simultaneously in Argentina, Colombia, Mexico, and Spain in 1989.<a href="#fn114" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref114"><sup>114</sup></a> The first American edition was listed as a best seller in <em><a href="The_New_York_Times" title="wikilink">The New York Times</a></em> the following year.<a href="#fn115" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref115"><sup>115</sup></a></p>
<p>The novel has been translated into many languages since its first publication in Spanish, as detailed by Sfeir de Gonz&lt;U+00E1&gt;lez in 2003.<a href="#fn116" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref116"><sup>116</sup></a></p>
