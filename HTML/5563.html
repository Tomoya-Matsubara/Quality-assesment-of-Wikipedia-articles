<p><strong>Windsor Castle</strong> is a former <a href="medieval" class="uri" title="wikilink">medieval</a> <a href="castle" class="uri" title="wikilink">castle</a>, now royal palace, in <a href="Windsor,_Berkshire" title="wikilink">Windsor</a> in the English county of <a href="Berkshire" class="uri" title="wikilink">Berkshire</a>, notable for its long royal history and its architecture. The original castle was built after the Norman invasion by <a href="William_the_Conqueror" title="wikilink">William the Conqueror</a>, and since the time of <a href="Henry_I_of_England" title="wikilink">Henry I</a> it has been used by a succession of monarchs; it is the longest-occupied palace in Europe. The castle's lavish, early 19th-century State Apartments are architecturally significant, described by art historian <a href="Hugh_Roberts" title="wikilink">Hugh Roberts</a> as &quot;a superb and unrivalled sequence of rooms widely regarded as the finest and most complete expression of later Georgian taste&quot;.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> The castle includes the 15th-century <a href="St_George&#39;s_Chapel,_Windsor_Castle" title="wikilink">St George's Chapel</a>, considered by historian <a href="John_Martin_Robinson" title="wikilink">John Robinson</a> to be &quot;one of the supreme achievements of English Perpendicular Gothic&quot; design.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> More than five hundred people live and work in Windsor, making it the largest inhabited castle in the world.</p>
<p>Originally designed to protect Norman dominance around the outskirts of London, and to oversee a strategically important part of the <a href="River_Thames" title="wikilink">River Thames</a>, Windsor Castle was built as a <a href="motte_and_bailey" title="wikilink">motte and bailey</a>, with three wards surrounding a central mound. Gradually replaced with stone fortifications, the castle withstood a prolonged siege during the <a href="First_Barons&#39;_War" title="wikilink">First Barons' War</a> at the start of the 13th century. <a href="Henry_III_of_England" title="wikilink">Henry III</a> built a luxurious royal palace within the castle during the middle of the century, and <a href="Edward_III_of_England" title="wikilink">Edward III</a> went further, rebuilding the palace to produce an even grander set of buildings in what would become &quot;the most expensive secular building project of the entire Middle Ages in England&quot;.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> Edward's core design lasted through the Tudor period, during which <a href="Henry_VIII_of_England" title="wikilink">Henry VIII</a> and <a href="Elizabeth_I_of_England" title="wikilink">Elizabeth I</a> made increasing use of the castle as a royal court and centre for diplomatic entertainment.</p>
<p>Windsor Castle survived a tumultuous period during the <a href="English_Civil_War" title="wikilink">English Civil War</a>, in which the castle was used as a military headquarters for <a href="Roundhead" title="wikilink">Parliamentary</a> forces and a prison for <a href="Charles_I_of_England" title="wikilink">Charles I</a>. During the Restoration, <a href="Charles_II_of_England" title="wikilink">Charles II</a> rebuilt much of Windsor Castle with the help of architect <a href="Hugh_May" title="wikilink">Hugh May</a>, creating a set of extravagant, <a href="Baroque" class="uri" title="wikilink">Baroque</a> interiors, still praised today. After a period of neglect during the 18th century, <a href="George_III_of_England" title="wikilink">George III</a> and <a href="George_IV_of_England" title="wikilink">George IV</a> renovated and rebuilt Charles II's palace at colossal expense, producing the current design of the State Apartments, full of <a href="Rococo_architecture" title="wikilink">Rococo</a>, <a href="Gothic_architecture" title="wikilink">Gothic</a> and Baroque furnishings. <a href="Queen_Victoria" title="wikilink">Queen Victoria</a> made minor changes to the castle, which became the centre for royal entertainment for much of her reign. Windsor Castle was used as a refuge for the royal family during the bombing campaigns of the Second World War and survived a <a href="1992_Windsor_Castle_fire" title="wikilink">fire in 1992</a>. It is a popular tourist attraction, a venue for hosting state visits, and the Queen's preferred weekend home. <img src="WindsorCastle_RoundTower.jpg" title="fig:The Round Tower on top of the motte in the Middle Ward" alt="The Round Tower on top of the motte in the Middle Ward" width="310" /></p>

<p>Windsor Castle occupies a large site of more than thirteen acres (five hectares), and combines the features of a fortification, a palace, and a small town.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> The present-day castle was created during a sequence of phased building projects, culminating in the reconstruction work after a <a href="1992_Windsor_Castle_fire" title="wikilink">fire in 1992</a>.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> It is in essence a <a href="Georgian_architecture" title="wikilink">Georgian</a> and <a href="Victorian_architecture" title="wikilink">Victorian</a> design based on a medieval structure, with <a href="Gothic_architecture" title="wikilink">Gothic</a> features reinvented in a modern style. Since the 14th century, architecture at the castle has attempted to produce a contemporary reinterpretation of older fashions and traditions, repeatedly imitating outmoded or even antiquated styles.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> As a result, architect Sir William Whitfield has pointed to Windsor Castle's architecture as having &quot;a certain fictive quality&quot;, the <a href="Picturesque" class="uri" title="wikilink">Picturesque</a> and Gothic design generating &quot;a sense that a theatrical performance is being put on here&quot;, despite late 20th century efforts to expose more of the older structures to increase the sense of authenticity.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> Although there has been some criticism, the castle's architecture and history lends it a &quot;place amongst the greatest European palaces&quot;.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="middle-ward">Middle Ward</h3>
<p>At the heart of Windsor Castle is the Middle Ward, a bailey formed around the <a href="motte-and-bailey" title="wikilink">motte</a> or artificial hill in the centre of the ward. The motte is 50 ft (15 m) high and is made from <a href="chalk" class="uri" title="wikilink">chalk</a> originally excavated from the surrounding ditch. The keep, called the Round Tower, on the top of the motte is based on an original 12th-century building, extended upwards in the early 19th century under architect <a href="Jeffry_Wyattville" title="wikilink">Jeffry Wyattville</a> by 30 ft (9 m) to produce a more imposing height and silhouette.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> The interior of the Round Tower was further redesigned in 1991&lt;U+2013&gt;3 to provide additional space for the <a href="Royal_Archives" title="wikilink">Royal Archives</a>, an additional room being built in the space left by Wyattville's originally hollow extension.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> The Round Tower is in reality <a href="epitrochoid" title="wikilink">far from cylindrical</a>, due to the shape and structure of the motte beneath it. The current height of the tower has been criticised as being disproportionate to its width; archaeologist Tim Tatton-Brown, for example, has described it as a mutilation of the earlier medieval structure.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<p>The western entrance to the Middle Ward is now open, and a gateway leads north from the ward onto the North Terrace.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> The eastern exit from the ward is guarded by the Norman Gatehouse.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> This <a href="gatehouse" class="uri" title="wikilink">gatehouse</a>, which in fact dates from the 14th century, is heavily vaulted and decorated with carvings, including surviving medieval <a href="lion_mask" title="wikilink">lion masks</a>, traditional symbols of majesty, to form an impressive entrance to the Upper Ward.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> Wyattville redesigned the exterior of the gatehouse, and the interior was later heavily converted in the 19th century for residential use.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="upper-ward">Upper Ward</h3>
<p><img src="Windsor_Castle_Upper_Ward_Quadrangle_Corrected_2-_Nov_2006.jpg" title="fig:The South Wing of the Upper Ward; the Official Entrance to the State Apartments is on the left" alt="The South Wing of the Upper Ward; the Official Entrance to the State Apartments is on the left" width="350" /> The Upper Ward of Windsor Castle comprises a number of major buildings enclosed by the upper bailey wall, forming a central quadrangle. The State Apartments run along the north of the ward, with a range of buildings along the east wall, and the private royal apartments and the King George IV Gate to the south, with the Edward III Tower in the south-west corner. The motte and the Round Tower form the west edge of the ward. A bronze statue of Charles II on horseback sits beneath the Round Tower.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> Inspired by <a href="Hubert_Le_Sueur" title="wikilink">Hubert Le Sueur</a>'s statue of Charles I in London, the statue was cast by Josias Ibach in 1679, with the marble plinth featuring carvings by <a href="Grinling_Gibbons" title="wikilink">Grinling Gibbons</a>.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> The Upper Ward adjoins the North Terrace, which overlooks the <a href="River_Thames" title="wikilink">River Thames</a>, and the East Terrace, which overlooks the gardens; both of the current terraces were constructed by <a href="Hugh_May" title="wikilink">Hugh May</a> in the 17th century.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
<p>Traditionally the Upper Ward was judged to be &quot;to all intents and purposes a nineteenth-century creation ... the image of what the early nineteenth-century thought a castle should be&quot;, as a result of the extensive redesign of the castle by Wyattville under George IV.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> The walls of the Upper Ward are built of <a href="Swinley_Forest" title="wikilink">Bagshot Heath</a> stone faced on the inside with regular bricks, the gothic details in yellow <a href="Bath_Stone" title="wikilink">Bath stone</a>.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> The buildings in the Upper Ward are characterised by the use of small bits of flint in the mortar for <a href="Glossary_of_architecture#G" title="wikilink">galletting</a>, originally started at the castle in the 17th century to give stonework from disparate periods a similar appearance. The skyline of the Upper Ward is designed to be dramatic when seen from a distance or silhouetted against the horizon, an image of tall towers and battlements influenced by the <a href="picturesque" class="uri" title="wikilink">picturesque</a> movement of the late 18th century.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> Archaeological and restoration work following the 1992 fire has shown the extent to which the current structure represents a survival of elements from the original 12th-century stone walls onwards, presented within the context of Wyattville's final remodelling.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a></p>
<h4 id="state-apartments">State Apartments</h4>
<p><img src="Windsor_Castle_Upper_Ward_Quadrangle_2_-_Nov_2006.jpg" title="fig:The State Apartments in the Upper Ward; (l to r) the Official Entrance, St George&#39;s Hall; the Guest&#39;s Entrance" alt="The State Apartments in the Upper Ward; (l to r) the Official Entrance, St George&#39;s Hall; the Guest&#39;s Entrance" width="350" /> The State Apartments form the major part of the Upper Ward and lie along the north side of the quadrangle. The modern building follows the medieval foundations laid down by Edward III, with the ground floor comprising service chambers and cellars, and the much grander first floor forming the main part of the palace. On the first floor, the layout of the western end of the State Apartments is primarily the work of architect Hugh May, whereas the structure on the eastern side represents Jeffry Wyattville's plans.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a></p>
<p>The interior of the State Apartments was mostly designed by Wyattville in the early 19th century. Wyattville intended each room to illustrate a particular architectural style and to display the matching furnishings and fine arts of the period.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> With some alterations over the years, this concept continues to dominate the apartments. Different rooms follow the <a href="Neoclassical_architecture" title="wikilink">Classical</a>, <a href="Gothic_Revival" title="wikilink">Gothic</a> and <a href="Rococo" class="uri" title="wikilink">Rococo</a> styles, together with an element of <a href="Jacobethan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Jacobethan</a> in places.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> Many of the rooms on the eastern end of the castle had to be restored following the 1992 fire, using &quot;equivalent restoration&quot; methods &lt;U+2013&gt; the rooms were restored so as to appear similar to their original appearance, but using modern materials and concealing modern structural improvements.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a>{{#tag:ref|&quot;Authentic restoration&quot; involves using original materials and methods; &quot;equivalent restoration&quot;, as at Windsor, can integrate modern &quot;fire compartmentation, service ducting, hygienic materials and strengthened floors&quot;, provided they cannot be seen.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a>|group=&quot;nb&quot;}} These rooms were also partially redesigned at the same time to more closely match modern tastes. Art historian <a href="Hugh_Roberts" title="wikilink">Hugh Roberts</a> has praised the State Apartments as &quot;a superb and unrivalled sequence of rooms widely regarded as the finest and most complete expression of later Georgian taste.&quot;<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> Others, such as architect Robin Nicolson and critic <a href="Hugh_Pearman_(architecture_critic)" title="wikilink">Hugh Pearman</a>, have described them as &quot;bland&quot; and &quot;distinctly dull&quot;.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a></p>

These rooms take the fluid, playful aspects of this mid-18th-century artistic movement, including many original pieces of <a href="Louis_XV_of_France" title="wikilink">Louis XV</a> decoration, but project them on a &quot;vastly inflated&quot; scale.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> Investigations after the 1992 fire have shown though that many Rococo features of the modern castle, originally thought to have been 18th-century fittings transferred from <a href="Carlton_House,_London" title="wikilink">Carlton House</a> or France, are in fact 19th-century imitations in plasterwork and wood, designed to blend with original elements.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> The Grand Reception Room is the most prominent of these Rococo designs, 100 ft (30 m) long and 40 ft (12 m) tall and occupying the site of Edward III's great hall.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> This room, restored after the fire, includes a huge French Rococo ceiling, characterised by Ian Constantinides, the lead restorer, as possessing a &quot;coarseness of form and crudeness of hand ... completely overshadowed by the sheer spectacular effect when you are at a distance&quot;.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> The room is set off by a set of restored <a href="Gobelins_Manufactory" title="wikilink">Gobelins French tapestries</a>.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> Although decorated with less gold leaf than in the 1820s, the result remains &quot;one of the greatest set-pieces of Regency decoration&quot;.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> The White, Green and Crimson Drawing Rooms include a total of sixty-two <a href="Trophy_(architectural)" title="wikilink">trophies</a>: carved, gilded wooden panels illustrating weapons and the spoils of war, many with <a href="Freemasonry" title="wikilink">Masonic</a> meanings.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> Restored or replaced after the fire, these trophies are famous for their &quot;vitality, precision and three-dimensional quality&quot;, and were originally brought from Carlton House in 1826, some being originally imported from France and others carved by Edward Wyatt.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> The soft furnishings of these rooms, although luxurious, are more modest than the 1820s originals, both on the grounds of modern taste and cost.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a></p>
<p>Wyattville's design retains three rooms originally built by <a href="Hugh_May" title="wikilink">Hugh May</a> in the 17th century in partnership with the painter <a href="Antonio_Verrio" title="wikilink">Antonio Verrio</a> and carver <a href="Grinling_Gibbons" title="wikilink">Grinling Gibbons</a>. The Queen's Presence Chamber, the Queen's Audience Chamber and the King's Dining Room are designed in a Baroque, Franco-Italian style, characterised by &quot;gilded interiors enriched with florid murals&quot;, first introduced to England between 1648&lt;U+2013&gt;50 at <a href="Wilton_House" title="wikilink">Wilton House</a>.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> Verrio's paintings are &quot;drenched in medievalist allusion&quot; and classical images.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> These rooms were intended to show an innovative English &quot;baroque fusion&quot; of the hitherto separate arts of architecture, painting and carving.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a></p>
<p><img src="Windsor_Castle_Private_Chapel.jpg" title="fig:A presentation drawing for the new Private Chapel, showing the organic, flowing Gothic design by Giles Downes" alt="A presentation drawing for the new Private Chapel, showing the organic, flowing Gothic design by Giles Downes" /> A handful of rooms in the modern State Apartments reflect either 18th-century or Victorian Gothic design. The State Dining Room, for example, whose current design originates from the 1850s but which was badly damaged during the 1992 fire, is restored to its appearance in the 1920s, before the removal of some of the gilded features on the pilasters.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> <a href="Anthony_Salvin" title="wikilink">Anthony Salvin</a>'s Grand Staircase is also of mid-Victorian design in the Gothic style, rising to a double-height hall lit by an older 18th-century Gothic <a href="vault_(architecture)" title="wikilink">vaulted</a> lantern tower called the Grand Vestibule, designed by <a href="James_Wyatt" title="wikilink">James Wyatt</a> and executed by <a href="Francis_Bernasconi" title="wikilink">Francis Bernasconi</a>.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> The staircase has been criticised by historian <a href="John_Martin_Robinson" title="wikilink">John Robinson</a> as being a distinctly inferior design to the earlier staircases built on the same site by both Wyatt and May.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a></p>
<p>Some parts of the State Apartments were completely destroyed in the 1992 fire and this area was rebuilt in a style called &quot;Downesian Gothic&quot;, named after the architect, <a href="Giles_Downes" title="wikilink">Giles Downes</a>.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a><a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> The style comprises &quot;the rather stripped, cool and systematic coherence of modernism sewn into a reinterpretation of the Gothic tradition&quot;.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a> Downes argues that the style avoids &quot;florid decoration&quot;, emphasising an organic, flowing Gothic structure.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a> Three new rooms were built or remodelled by Downes at Windsor. Downes' new roof of St George's Hall is the largest green-oak structure built since the Middle Ages, and is decorated with brightly coloured shields celebrating the heraldic element of the <a href="Order_of_the_Garter" title="wikilink">Order of the Garter</a>; the design attempts to create an illusion of additional height through the gothic woodwork along the ceiling.<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a> The Lantern Lobby features flowing oak columns forming a vaulted ceiling, imitating an <a href="arum_lily" title="wikilink">arum lily</a>.<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a> The new Private Chapel is relatively small, only able to fit thirty worshippers, but combines architectural elements of the St George's Hall roof with the Lantern Lobby and the stepped arch structure of the Henry VIII chapel vaulting at <a href="Hampton_Court" title="wikilink">Hampton Court</a>.<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a> The result is an &quot;extraordinary, continuous and closely moulded net of tracery&quot;, complementing the new stained glass windows commemorating the fire, designed by Joseph Nuttgen.<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a> The Great Kitchen, with its newly exposed 14th-century roof lantern sitting alongside Wyattville's fireplaces, chimneys and Gothic tables, is also a product of the reconstruction after the fire.<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a></p>
<p>The ground floor of the State Apartments retains various famous medieval features. The 14th-century Great Undercroft still survives, some 193 ft (60 m) long by 31 ft (9 m) wide, divided into thirteen bays.<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a> At the time of the 1992 fire, the Undercroft had been divided into smaller rooms; the area is now opened up to form a single space in an effort to echo the undercrofts at <a href="Fountains_Abbey" title="wikilink">Fountains</a> and <a href="Rievaulx_Abbey" title="wikilink">Rievaulx Abbeys</a>, although the floor remains artificially raised for convenience of use.<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a> The &quot;beautifully vaulted&quot; 14th-century Larderie passage runs alongside the Kitchen Courtyard and is decorated with carved royal roses, marking its construction by Edward III.<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a><a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a></p>

<h4 id="fire">1992 fire</h4>

<p>Two major issues for Windsor Castle emerged following the fire. The first was a political debate in Britain as to who should pay for the repairs.<a href="#fn335" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref335"><sup>335</sup></a> Traditionally, as the property of <a href="the_Crown" title="wikilink">the Crown</a>, Windsor Castle was maintained, and if necessary repaired, by the British government; furthermore, like other state buildings, it was not <a href="Insurance" title="wikilink">insured</a>.<a href="#fn336" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref336"><sup>336</sup></a> At the time of the fire, however, the British press strongly argued in favour of the queen herself being required to pay for the repairs from her private income.<a href="#fn337" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref337"><sup>337</sup></a> A solution was found in which the restoration work would be paid for by opening <a href="Buckingham_Palace" title="wikilink">Buckingham Palace</a> to the public at selected times of the year, and by introducing new charges for public access to the parkland surrounding Windsor.<a href="#fn338" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref338"><sup>338</sup></a> The second major issue concerned how to repair the castle. Some suggested that the damaged rooms should be restored to their original appearance, but others favoured repairing the castle so as to incorporate modern designs.<a href="#fn339" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref339"><sup>339</sup></a> The decision was taken to largely follow the pre-fire architecture with some changes to reflect modern tastes and cost, but fresh questions emerged over whether the restoration should be undertaken to &quot;authentic&quot; or &quot;equivalent&quot; restoration standards.<a href="#fn340" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref340"><sup>340</sup></a> Modern methods were used at Windsor to reproduce the equivalent pre-fire appearance, partially due to the cost.<a href="#fn341" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref341"><sup>341</sup></a> The restoration programme was not completed until 1997, at a total cost of &lt;U+00A3&gt;37 million (&lt;U+00A3&gt;50.2 million in 2009 terms).<a href="#fn342" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref342"><sup>342</sup></a><a href="#fn343" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref343"><sup>343</sup></a></p>
