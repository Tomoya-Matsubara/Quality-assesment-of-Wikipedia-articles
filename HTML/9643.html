<h3 id="dial-m-for-murder-or-press-to-return-to-main-menu">Dial &quot;M&quot; for Murder or Press &quot;#&quot; to Return to Main Menu</h3>
<p>In this <a href="black_and_white" title="wikilink">black and white</a> segment, <a href="Lisa_Simpson" title="wikilink">Lisa</a> wants revenge after being sent to <a href="detention" class="uri" title="wikilink">detention</a> by Ms. Hoover for disrupting class as she claims another student topped her through a tutor. <a href="Bart_Simpson" title="wikilink">Bart</a> hatches a &quot;criss-cross&quot; plan and tells Lisa that if she pulls a &quot;ding-dong ditch&quot; on Mrs. Krabappel, he will do the same to Ms. Hoover. Lisa thinks this means <a href="Knock,_Knock,_Ginger" title="wikilink">ringing the bell at Mrs. Krabappel's apartment and leaving</a>. However, Lisa soon learns that Bart meant for her to kill Mrs. Krabappel (and dump the corpse in a ditch), as he has killed Ms. Hoover. Bart attempts to coax Lisa into killing Mrs. Krabappel with a <a href="paper_cutter" title="wikilink">paper cutter</a>, but she refuses. Eventually, Bart decides to blackmail her into it with help from Willie, who would frame Lisa for the decaptitated Skinner to honor his side of the &quot;criss-cross&quot; in which Bart killed Skinner. Pretending to submit to his demand, Lisa instead attempts to kill Bart with a knife, beginning a chase sequence. Bart finally finds shelter at a crowded playground <a href="carousel" class="uri" title="wikilink">carousel</a>, but is left at Lisa's mercy when the other children leave to get ice cream. Lisa, however, says she will never be a murderer, and attempts to throw the knife away. The knife cycles out of control and ends up nailing Bart in the head just as Mrs. Krabappel appears. Lisa and Krabappel walk away smiling, leaving the murdered Bart to spin around on the carousel.</p>

<p><a href="Krusty_the_Clown" title="wikilink">Krusty the Clown</a> introduces a new version of his Krustyburger, the Burger<sup>2</sup>, made from cattle <a href="meat_and_bone_meal" title="wikilink">that have eaten other cattle in their feed</a>. Upon eating a burger on live television, <a href="Kent_Brockman" title="wikilink">Kent Brockman</a> becomes <a href="undead" class="uri" title="wikilink">undead</a> and begins biting everyone around him. <a href="28_Days_Later" title="wikilink">Twenty-eight days later</a>, Springfield has become overrun by &quot;munchers&quot;, with the Simpson family being some of the few survivors. One day, Bart, tired of eating fruits, escapes from his family's barricaded house and eats one of the burgers, but turns out to be immune to its effects. Over the phone, a besieged Dr. Hibbert (who is fighting back quite well until the end of the phonecall) tells them that Bart's immunity may be the key to developing a cure to the epidemic, a genetic &quot;chosen one&quot;, and that they must bring Bart to a so-called &quot;safe zone&quot; outside the city. The Simpsons are attacked by the munchers after a failed attempt to sneak out. They are saved by <a href="Apu" class="uri" title="wikilink">Apu</a>, driving an armored off-road truck (Apu was never infected because as a Hindu and vegetarian, he cannot eat beef, and he was prepared for a zombie apocalypse since, as a convenience store clerk, he is armed to the teeth). The group tries to leave Springfield, but Apu winds up crashing the truck over a pile of smashed cars. Apu goes to push the car off the pile, but the Simpsons drive away thinking Apu sacrificed himself, when he actually wanted the Simpsons to wait for him. After Apu gets killed, the Simpsons drive on but run out of gas, walking the rest of the way to the safe zone. During their journey, Homer is bitten by a zombie <a href="Mr._Burns" title="wikilink">Mr. Burns</a> after picking off his nose, thinking he was dead, thus turning him into a zombie himself. The family decide not to kill him in the hopes of finding a cure. They reach the safe zone, where Bart &lt;U+2013&gt; being immune to the zombie virus &lt;U+2013&gt; is worshipped as the &quot;chosen one&quot;. However, the people there believe that <a href="cannibalism" title="wikilink">cannibalizing</a> Bart will save them from the virus. The Simpsons, however, think of another solution: vaccinating the remaining populace by having Bart bathe in their food before eating it, thus saving Springfield.</p>
<h3 id="theres-no-business-like-moe-business">There's No Business Like Moe Business</h3>
<p>In a Broadway musical, Moe is lonely and upset that he does not have a girlfriend and is jealous when he sees Homer and Marge together. When Homer falls into the basement of the <a href="Moe&#39;s_Tavern" title="wikilink">bar</a> and is impaled by pipes, his blood becomes the secret ingredient in Moe's new beer. Everyone loves this new beer, saying that it makes them feel warm, secure and cozy on the inside. Moe uses this to his advantage and woos Marge, tricking her into thinking that Homer walked out on her because he is <a href="Homosexual" title="wikilink">gay</a> while continuing to bleed Homer dry. Homer emerges, alive, despite being impaled by Moe's microbrew machine, hurls Moe (or rather, a dummy of Moe) across the room, and reunites with Marge.</p>
