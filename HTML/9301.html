<p><strong><em>JESUS</em></strong> (alternatively called <strong><em>The Jesus Film</em></strong>), is a 1979 <a href="motion_picture" title="wikilink">motion picture</a> which depicts the life of <a href="Jesus_Christ" title="wikilink">Jesus Christ</a> according primarily to the <a href="Gospel_of_Luke" title="wikilink">Gospel of Luke</a> in the <a href="Bible" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bible</a>. It was <a href="film_director" title="wikilink">co-directed</a> by <a href="Australia" title="wikilink">Australian</a> <a href="Peter_Sykes_(director)" title="wikilink">Peter Sykes</a>, <a href="United_Kingdom" title="wikilink">Britons</a> <a href="John_Heyman" title="wikilink">John Heyman</a> and <a href="John_Krish" title="wikilink">John Krish</a> and filmed in <a href="Israel" class="uri" title="wikilink">Israel</a>.</p>
<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<p>The film's origins date back to 1945 when a young businessman named <a href="Bill_Bright" title="wikilink">Bill Bright</a> wanted to privately finance a film about the life of <a href="Jesus_Christ" title="wikilink">Jesus Christ</a><a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> that was entertaining, <a href="Bible" title="wikilink">biblically</a> accurate, and which could be translated into non-<a href="English_language" title="wikilink">English</a> <a href="List_of_language_families" title="wikilink">languages</a>. Rather than making a film at that time, Bright went on to found a Christian ministry to reach college students called <a href="Campus_Crusade_for_Christ" title="wikilink">Campus Crusade for Christ</a> in 1951.</p>
<p>In 1976, with Campus Crusade's influence spreading beyond college campuses to sports, the marketplace and other aspects of society, Bright turned his attention once again to filmmaking. Hollywood's <a href="Germany" title="wikilink">German</a>-born <a href="United_Kingdom" title="wikilink">British</a> producer John Heyman approached Bright to fund a project to put the entire Bible on film. The project would eventually be scaled back to just one book of the Bible, the Gospel of Luke, and be financed primarily by Campus Crusade supporters <a href="Nelson_Bunker_Hunt" title="wikilink">Bunker and Caroline Hunt</a><a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> for a sum of $6 million.</p>
<p>A team of 500 scholars and leaders from <a href="secularism" title="wikilink">secular</a> and <a href="Christianity" title="wikilink">Christian</a> organizations began to research historical elements for a film about Jesus. Filming took place over the course of several months throughout the <a href="Middle_East" title="wikilink">Middle East</a>.</p>
<p><em>Jesus</em> was produced by <a href="John_Heyman" title="wikilink">John Heyman</a>, a <a href="Germany" title="wikilink">German</a>-born <a href="United_Kingdom" title="wikilink">British</a> producer. <a href="United_Kingdom" title="wikilink">British</a> <a href="William_Shakespeare" title="wikilink">Shakespearean</a> actor <a href="Brian_Deacon" title="wikilink">Brian Deacon</a> was hired to play the critical role of Jesus himself. The part of <a href="Mary_(mother_of_Jesus)" title="wikilink">Mary</a> was played by <a href="Rivka_Neumann" title="wikilink">Rivka Neumann</a>, and the part of <a href="Saint_Joseph" title="wikilink">Joseph</a> by <a href="Yosef_Shiloach" title="wikilink">Yosef Shiloach</a>, and the part of <a href="Mary_Magdalene" title="wikilink">Mary Magdalene</a> (<a href="Prostitute" class="uri" title="wikilink">Prostitute</a> and <a href="Demon_Possesd" title="wikilink">Demon Possesd</a>) was played by <a href="Talia_Shapira" title="wikilink">Talia Shapira</a>. Former Jesus Film Project director <a href="Paul_Eshleman" title="wikilink">Paul Eshleman</a>, who was on location during much of the principal photography and even had a small non-speaking role as a <a href="Rome" title="wikilink">Roman</a> soldier on <a href="horse" title="wikilink">horseback</a>, revealed in the <a href="DVD" title="wikilink">DVD's</a> <a href="audio_commentary" title="wikilink">audio commentary</a><a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> that Deacon (the son of a <a href="Catholicism" title="wikilink">Catholic</a> mother and a <a href="Protestantism" title="wikilink">Protestant</a> father), was so committed to the film and its message that he read several <a href="Bible_translations" title="wikilink">Bible translations</a> a day in order to make certain that he properly presented Christ's teachings. Because Deacon developed <a href="pneumonia" class="uri" title="wikilink">pneumonia</a> during principal photography, doubles were used in certain scenes.</p>
<p>Some locations mentioned in the Bible, such as the <a href="River_Jordan" title="wikilink">Jordan River</a> and what is believed to have been the home of <a href="Simon_the_Tanner" title="wikilink">Simon the Tanner</a>, were used in the film.</p>
<p>After each day's filming was completed, the footage was sent to a panel of biblical scholars for review.</p>
<p>Instead of creating a parallel story for the film or embellishing the biblical account, as is the case with other biblical films such as <em><a href="The_Ten_Commandments_(1956_film)" title="wikilink">The Ten Commandments</a></em> or <em><a href="The_Greatest_Story_Ever_Told" title="wikilink">The Greatest Story Ever Told</a></em>, the filmmakers chose to adhere as closely as possible to the <a href="Gospel_of_Luke" title="wikilink">Gospel of Luke</a>. At the end of the film it states that the <a href="Good_News_Bible" title="wikilink">Good News Bible</a> (Today's English Version) was used for the filming. Most of the film's dialogue comes from Luke, which was chosen after John Heyman sought advice from <a href="clergy" class="uri" title="wikilink">clergy</a> and scholars. Many responded that the <a href="screenplay" class="uri" title="wikilink">screenplay</a> should be based on just one <a href="Gospel" class="uri" title="wikilink">Gospel</a>, and that <a href="Gospel_of_Luke" title="wikilink">Luke</a> should be used because of its completeness.</p>
<p><em>Jesus</em> was released by <a href="Warner_Bros." title="wikilink">Warner Bros.</a> in the <a href="United_States" title="wikilink">United States</a>. It was not a financial success, losing approximately $2 million. While praising its &quot;meticulous attention to authenticity&quot;, <a href="Film_critic" title="wikilink">critics</a> panned <em>Jesus</em> for being &quot;painfully monotonous&quot;<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a><a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> and &quot;little more than an illustrated gospel, with nothing in the way of historical and social context.&quot;<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> The <em><a href="Los_Angeles_Times" title="wikilink">Los Angeles Times</a></em> called it a &quot;...dull Sunday-School treatment of the life of Christ, meticulously but unimaginatively culled from Luke 3-24.&quot;<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p>Producer John Heyman was also not pleased with the high pitched accents of the Israeli cast members and decided to have all of the voices dubbed over. The only voice who wasn't dubbed over was Brian Deacon's.</p>
<h2 id="foreign-language-versions">Foreign language versions</h2>
<p>In 1981, <a href="Bill_Bright" title="wikilink">Bill Bright</a> created the Jesus Film Project organization with the goal of accurately translating <em>Jesus</em> into other languages and showing them around the world.</p>
<p>The first translation was done for the <a href="Tagalog_language" title="wikilink">Tagalog</a>-speaking people of the <a href="Philippines" class="uri" title="wikilink">Philippines</a>. The organization works with thousands of missionaries around the world to show the film, sometimes to audiences who have never seen a motion picture.</p>
<p>The <a href="Mandarin_Chinese" title="wikilink">Mandarin Chinese</a> version of the film is widely distributed in China by the government-linked <a href="China_Christian_Council" title="wikilink">China Christian Council</a>'s <a href="Amity_Foundation" title="wikilink">Amity Foundation</a> in <a href="Nanjing" class="uri" title="wikilink">Nanjing</a>, both on <a href="VCD" title="wikilink">VCDs</a> and <a href="DVD" class="uri" title="wikilink">DVD</a>.</p>
<p>Distribution in the United States has included direct mail campaigns sponsored by churches to deliver a copy of the film to every address in select zip codes across the country. In 2004, the organization made the film available for viewing on its website in over 300 languages. Both ''Jesus '' and <em>The Story of Jesus for Children</em> are available in <a href="DVD" class="uri" title="wikilink">DVD</a> and <a href="VHS" class="uri" title="wikilink">VHS</a> formats. Audio dramatizations in a number of languages are also available.</p>
<p>In the 2000s the film was translated into the <a href="Indonesian_language" title="wikilink">Indonesian language</a>. The film was also translated and dubbed into the <a href="Lakota_language" title="wikilink">Lakota language</a>.</p>
<h2 id="new-versions">New versions</h2>
<p>To make the film more relevant for younger viewers, new footage for <em>The Story of Jesus for Children</em> was filmed in 1999. It was then interwoven into an edited version of the original film <em>Jesus</em> and released in 2000.</p>
<p>In 2001, a new opening sequence depicting the <a href="Creationism" title="wikilink">creation of man</a>, the expulsion from <a href="Garden_of_Eden" title="wikilink">Eden</a>, <a href="Abraham" title="wikilink">Abraham's</a> aborted <a href="Human_sacrifice" title="wikilink">sacrifice</a> of his son, and the prophesies of <a href="Book_of_Isaiah" title="wikilink">Isaiah</a> was filmed to show, as Paul Eshleman states in the audio commentary, how Jesus' life fits into the span of history.</p>
<p>In 2002, a special edition of <em>Jesus</em> commemorating the <a href="September_11_attacks" title="wikilink">September 11 attacks</a> was distributed in the <a href="VHS" class="uri" title="wikilink">VHS</a> format. It contains introductions by <a href="New_York_City" title="wikilink">New York City</a> <a href="New_York_City_Fire_Department" title="wikilink">firefighters</a> and <a href="New_York_Police_Department" title="wikilink">police officers</a> and has a running time of 83 minutes.</p>
<p>In 2007 another film, made for woman, was released name has <a href="Magdalena:_Released_from_Shame" title="wikilink">Magdalena: Released from Shame</a>, using the same actor.</p>
<p>An edited <a href="DVD" class="uri" title="wikilink">DVD</a> version of <em>Jesus</em> was also packaged with <em>Jesus: Fact or Fiction</em>, which was produced in 2003 by <a href="Inspirational_Films" title="wikilink">Inspirational Films</a>. This features a section called the &quot;Journey of Spiritual Discovery.&quot; Biblical scholars, historians, philosophers, authors and ministers answer specific questions relating to God, Jesus, Christianity, the archaeological, scientific, and historical accuracy of the Bible, and testimony from many Christian men and women. Viewers can browse the numerous topics individually, or they can watch the film and, when prompted by a &quot;discovery glass&quot; icon, can access relevant comments. After they are finished, the viewer is returned to the scene they were watching.</p>
<p>To celebrate the 35th anniversary of the film's release, a new DVD and Blue Ray version was released complete with a new musical score and sound effects. Once again all of the voices in the film are dubbed over by unknown British voice actors. Brian Deacon returns to to do the voice over for Jesus.</p>
