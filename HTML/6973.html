<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<p>Birchington was first recorded in 1240 as Birchenton, a name derived from the Old English words 'bircen tun', meaning a farm where <a href="birch" class="uri" title="wikilink">birch</a> trees grow.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> Archaeological evidence has shown the area was inhabited before the existence of the village: Roman and prehistoric artefacts have been discovered in the area, and Minnis Bay was once the site of an <a href="Iron_Age" title="wikilink">Iron Age</a> settlement.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>

<p>The village is built beside four sandy bays; Minnis Bay to the west, Grenham Bay and Beresford Gap towards the centre and Epple Bay to the east. The village is situated on the <a href="Isle_of_Thanet" title="wikilink">Isle of Thanet</a>, which was a separate island from mainland Kent until around two hundred years ago, when the channel in between became silted up. The area to the west of the village, between Birchington and Herne Bay, was once part of the channel and is now low-lying marshland. In the east of the village the land rises, forming chalk cliffs and cliff stacks around the beaches at Grenham Bay, Beresford Gap and Epple Bay. A sea wall stretches along the foot of the cliffs to prevent further erosion. The geology of Thanet consists mainly of chalk, deposited when the area was below the sea. Isle of Thanet became exposed above sea-level once the <a href="English_Channel" title="wikilink">English Channel</a> broke through between Kent and France, causing the sea-level to fall.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> The whole of the northeast Kent coast has been designated a <a href="Site_of_Special_Scientific_Interest" title="wikilink">Site of Special Scientific Interest</a>.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>

The hardness is due to water being obtained from underground chalk sources by the water company <a href="Southern_Water" title="wikilink">Southern Water</a>.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> Waste water is discharged into the sea after being treated at a sewage works in Margate.</p>
