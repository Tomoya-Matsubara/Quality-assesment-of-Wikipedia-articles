<p><strong>Elliott James Wilson</strong> (born <a href="3_November" title="wikilink">3 November</a>, <a href="1976" class="uri" title="wikilink">1976</a>) is a former <a href="England" title="wikilink">English</a> <a href="cricket" title="wikilink">cricketer</a> who played <a href="county_cricket" title="wikilink">county cricket</a> for <a href="Worcestershire_County_Cricket_Club" title="wikilink">Worcestershire</a>. He was born in <a href="St_Pancras" title="wikilink">St Pancras</a>, <a href="London" class="uri" title="wikilink">London</a>.</p>
<p>In early July 1998, Wilson made his first-team debut for Worcestershire against <a href="Northamptonshire_County_Cricket_Club" title="wikilink">Northamptonshire</a> in a <a href="the_result_in_cricket" title="wikilink">tied</a> game in the <a href="National_League_(cricket)" title="wikilink">AXA League</a>, scoring 15 and taking one catch. Later that month he scored 61 opening the batting in another <a href="one-day_cricket" title="wikilink">one-day</a> match, against the touring <a href="Sri_Lankan_cricket_team" title="wikilink">Sri Lankans</a>, and two days later was selected to make his <a href="first-class_cricket" title="wikilink">first-class</a> debut against <a href="Yorkshire_County_Cricket_Club" title="wikilink">Yorkshire</a>. It was a chastening experience, however: he made only 25 and 3 as Worcestershire were crushed by an innings and 160 runs. Nevertheless, Wilson was retained in the side and was a first-team regular for the remainder of the season, although he made no significant scores.</p>
<p>1999 was a fairly successful season for Wilson: in nine first-class matches, he scored 536 runs <a href="batting_average" title="wikilink">at 35.73</a>, including a career-best 116 against <a href="Middlesex_County_Cricket_Club" title="wikilink">Middlesex</a> and three further half-centuries; while in <a href="List_A_cricket" title="wikilink">List A</a> games he scored two fifties, including a career-best 62 (albeit in a losing cause) against <a href="Warwickshire_County_Cricket_Club" title="wikilink">Warwickshire</a>. In 2000, he was a regular selection for his county, playing 17 first-class games, but despite two further centuries he averaged under 27 overall, while in the one-day format he had a nightmare, averaging 12.64 from 16 innings with a high score of just 38.</p>
<p>Wilson spent the winter playing in <a href="Australia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Australia</a>, but was forced to return home with an spinal infection caused by an unclean needle during a routine injection. He spent a considerable amount of time in hospital and had several major operations as a result of the infection leading to a significant amount of time out of the game. <a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> At the time there was optimism that he would recover and play for Worcestershire again, but in the event this did not happen.He attempted a comeback in 2003, when he played a handful of matches for <a href="Cambridgeshire_County_Cricket_Club" title="wikilink">Cambridgeshire</a>, including one List A game in the <a href="G&amp;G_Trophy" title="wikilink">G&amp;G Trophy</a> against Yorkshire, however his back was not up to the rigours of everyday cricket</p>
