<p>Major <strong>Michael Augustus Fox-Pitt-Rivers</strong> (27 May 1917 – December 1999) was a <a href="West_Country" title="wikilink">West Country</a> landowner who gained notoriety in <a href="United_Kingdom" title="wikilink">Britain</a> in the 1950s when he was put on trial charged with <a href="buggery" class="uri" title="wikilink">buggery</a>. This trial was instrumental in bringing public attention&lt;U+2014&gt;and opposition&lt;U+2014&gt;to the laws against <a href="homosexuality" class="uri" title="wikilink">homosexuality</a> as they then stood.</p>
<p>Pitt-Rivers was the son of Captain George Henry Lane Fox-Pitt-Rivers and the Hon. Emily Rachel Forster, who died in 1979. A West Country landowner and conservationist of colourful antecedents, his great-grandfather was Lt-Gen <a href="Augustus_Pitt_Rivers" title="wikilink">A.H. Lane Fox Pitt-Rivers</a> whose <a href="Ethnography" title="wikilink">ethnographic</a> collection, donated to <a href="University_of_Oxford" title="wikilink">Oxford University</a> in 1883, formed the basis of the <a href="Pitt_Rivers_Museum" title="wikilink">Pitt Rivers Museum</a> named after him.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> He served in <a href="World_War_II" title="wikilink">World War II</a>, and in 1946 gained the Substantive rank of <a href="Captain_(army)" title="wikilink">Captain</a>.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>In the summer of 1953, <a href="Edward_Douglas-Scott-Montagu%2C_3rd_Baron_Montagu_of_Beaulieu" title="wikilink">Lord Montagu of Beaulieu</a> offered his friend <a href="Peter_Wildeblood" title="wikilink">Peter Wildeblood</a> the use of a beach hut near his country estate. Wildeblood brought with him two young <a href="Royal_Air_Force" title="wikilink">RAF</a> servicemen, Edward McNally and John Reynolds. The foursome were joined by Montagu's cousin Michael Pitt-Rivers. At the subsequent trial the two airmen turned <a href="Turn_state&#39;s_evidence" title="wikilink">Queen's Evidence</a> and claimed there had been dancing and &quot;abandoned behaviour&quot; at the gathering. Wildeblood said it had in fact been &quot;extremely dull.&quot; Montagu claimed that it was all remarkably innocent, saying: &quot;We had some drinks, we danced, we kissed, that's all.&quot;<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>Arrested on 9 January 1954, in March of that year Pitt-Rivers was brought before the <a href="United_Kingdom" title="wikilink">British</a> courts charged with &quot;conspiracy to incite certain male persons to commit serious offences with male persons&quot; or &quot;<a href="buggery" class="uri" title="wikilink">buggery</a>&quot;. It was the first time this charge had been used in a British court since the trials of <a href="Oscar_Wilde" title="wikilink">Oscar Wilde</a> in 1895 and it led to public criticism that the police were pursuing a <a href="McCarthyism" title="wikilink">McCarthy-like</a> purge of <a href="High_society_(group)" title="wikilink">Society</a> homosexuals.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>Pitt-Rivers was charged along with <a href="Edward_Douglas-Scott-Montagu%2C_3rd_Baron_Montagu_of_Beaulieu" title="wikilink">Lord Montagu of Beaulieu</a> and <a href="Peter_Wildeblood" title="wikilink">Peter Wildeblood</a>. Pitt-Rivers and Lord Montagu denied the charges and denied also that they were homosexual.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> After an eight-day trial held at the Winchester Assizes, on 24 March 1954 Pitt-Rivers and Wildebood were sentenced to 18 months and Lord Montagu to 12 months in prison as a result of these and other charges. Their case led eventually to the <a href="Wolfenden_Report" title="wikilink">Wolfenden Report</a>, which in 1957 recommended the decriminalisation of homosexuality in the <a href="United_Kingdom" title="wikilink">United Kingdom</a>.</p>
<p>Michael Pitt-Rivers married <a href="Sonia_Brownell" title="wikilink">Sonia Brownell</a>, the widow of <a href="George_Orwell" title="wikilink">George Orwell</a>, in 1958. They were divorced in 1965.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a><a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> Pitt-Rivers spent much of his wealth on a lifetime of travel, financed by selling the most productive land from the Rushmore estate he inherited in <a href="Dorset" class="uri" title="wikilink">Dorset</a>. In 1991 he began the restoration of the <a href="Larmer_Tree_Gardens" title="wikilink">Larmer Tree Gardens</a>, which had been in a state of neglect since the death of his grandfather in 1900. The gardens reopened to the public in 1995.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a><a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> He spent most of his adult life with his partner, William Davis, who inherited his estate on his death.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<p>His role in the 1967 decriminalisation of homosexuality in the United Kingdom was explored in the 2007 <a href="Channel_Four" title="wikilink">Channel Four</a> <a href="docudrama" class="uri" title="wikilink">docudrama</a> <em><a href="A_Very_British_Sex_Scandal" title="wikilink">A Very British Sex Scandal</a></em>.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<p>Michael Pitt-Rivers died in December 1999 aged 82.</p>
