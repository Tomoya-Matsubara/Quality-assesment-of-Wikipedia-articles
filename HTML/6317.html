<h3 id="newcastle-united">Newcastle United</h3>

But we are buying long-term a very promising talent, a very promising player.&quot;</em><a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> LuaLua signed a five-year contract with the club.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> LuaLua made his first-team debut in a 1-0 home defeat to <a href="Charlton_Athletic_F.C." title="wikilink">Charlton</a> in September 2000 and went on to make a total of 23 league and cup appearances for Newcastle in the 2000-01 season without scoring.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> He scored twice in Newcastle's <a href="UEFA_Intertoto_Cup" title="wikilink">Intertoto Cup</a> campaign at the beginning of the 2001-02 season but his first Premiership goal did not come until April 2002, when he scored a last-minute winner in a 3-2 away win against <a href="Derby_County_F.C." title="wikilink">Derby</a>.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> He scored a further two goals in the remaining four games of the season.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> LuaLua's goalscoring form continued to the beginning of the 2002-03 season when he scored three goals in his first four games.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> Competition for a first-team place meant that LuaLua made only 22 appearances in this season.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> In January 2003, LuaLua urged manager Bobby Robson to select some of the younger players for the first-team, saying, <em>&quot;I think I deserve a chance now, as do many of the lads on the fringes of the team. Although some people might have the idea that those of us not in the team like sitting on the bench and getting paid good money, nothing could be further from the truth.
