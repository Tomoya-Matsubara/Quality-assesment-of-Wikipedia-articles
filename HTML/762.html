<p>The <strong>Diocletianic Persecution</strong> (or <strong>Great Persecution</strong>) was the last and most severe <a href="persecution_of_Christians" title="wikilink">persecution of Christians</a> in the <a href="Roman_empire" title="wikilink">Roman empire</a>.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> In 303, <a href="Roman_Emperor" title="wikilink">Emperor</a> <a href="Diocletian" class="uri" title="wikilink">Diocletian</a> and his colleagues <a href="Maximian" class="uri" title="wikilink">Maximian</a>, <a href="Galerius" class="uri" title="wikilink">Galerius</a>, and <a href="Constantius_Chlorus" title="wikilink">Constantius</a> issued a series of edicts rescinding Christians' legal rights and demanding they comply with traditional religious practices. Later edicts targeted the clergy and demanded universal sacrifice, ordering all inhabitants to sacrifice to the gods. The persecution varied in intensity across the empire—weakest in Gaul and Britain, where only the first edict was applied, and strongest in the Eastern provinces. Persecutionary laws were nullified by different emperors at different times, but <a href="Constantine_I" title="wikilink">Constantine</a> and <a href="Licinius" class="uri" title="wikilink">Licinius</a>'s <a href="Edict_of_Milan" title="wikilink">Edict of Milan</a> (313) has traditionally marked the end of the persecution.</p>
<p>Christians had always been subject to local discrimination in the empire, but early emperors were reluctant to issue general laws against the sect. It was not until the 250s, under the reigns of <a href="Decius" class="uri" title="wikilink">Decius</a> and <a href="Valerian_(emperor)" title="wikilink">Valerian</a>, that such laws were passed. Under this legislation, Christians were compelled to sacrifice to pagan gods or face imprisonment and execution. After <a href="Gallienus" class="uri" title="wikilink">Gallienus</a>'s accession in 260, these laws went into abeyance. Diocletian's assumption of power in 284 did not mark an immediate reversal of imperial inattention to Christianity, but it did herald a gradual shift in official attitudes toward religious minorities. In the first fifteen years of his rule, Diocletian purged the army of Christians, condemned <a href="Manichaeism" title="wikilink">Manicheans</a> to death, and surrounded himself with public opponents of Christianity. Diocletian's preference for activist government, combined with his self-image as a restorer of past Roman glory, forebode the most pervasive persecution in Roman history. In the winter of 302, Galerius urged Diocletian to begin a general persecution of the Christians. Diocletian was wary, and asked the oracle of Apollo for guidance. The oracle's reply was read as an endorsement of Galerius's position, and a general persecution was called on February 24, 303.</p>
<p>Persecutionary policies varied in intensity across the empire. Where Galerius and Diocletian were avid persecutors, Constantius was unenthusiastic. Later persecutionary edicts, including the calls for universal sacrifice, were not applied in his domain. His son, Constantine, on taking the imperial office in 306, restored Christians to full legal equality and returned property confiscated during the persecution. In Italy in 306, the usurper <a href="Maxentius" class="uri" title="wikilink">Maxentius</a> ousted Maximian's successor <a href="Flavius_Valerius_Severus" title="wikilink">Severus</a>, promising full religious toleration. Galerius ended the persecution in the East in 311, but it was resumed in Egypt, Palestine, and Asia Minor by his successor, <a href="Maximinus" class="uri" title="wikilink">Maximinus</a>. Constantine and Licinius, Severus's successor, signed the &quot;Edict of Milan&quot; in 313, which offered more comprehensive acceptance of Christianity than Galerius's edict had provided. Licinius ousted Maximinus in 313, bringing an end to persecution in the East.</p>
<p>The persecution failed to check the rise of the church. By 324, Constantine was sole ruler of the empire, and Christianity had become his favored religion. Although the persecution resulted in the deaths of—according to one modern estimate—3,000 Christians, and the torture, imprisonment, or dislocation of many more, most Christians avoided punishment. The persecution did, however, cause many churches to split between those who had complied with imperial authority (the <em><a href="traditor" title="wikilink">traditores</a></em>), and those who had remained &quot;pure&quot;. Certain schisms, like those of the <a href="Donatist" title="wikilink">Donatists</a> in North Africa and the Meliteans in Egypt, persisted long after the persecutions. The Donatists would not be reconciled to the <a href="Roman_Catholic_Church" title="wikilink">Catholic Church</a> until after 411. In the centuries that followed, some Christians created a &quot;cult of the martyrs&quot;, and exaggerated the barbarousness of the persecutionary era. These accounts were criticized during the <a href="Age_of_Enlightenment" title="wikilink">Enlightenment</a> and after, most notably by <a href="Edward_Gibbon" title="wikilink">Edward Gibbon</a>. Modern historians have tended to downplay the scale and depth of the Diocletianic persecution.</p>

<p>From its first appearance to its legalization under <a href="Constantine_I" title="wikilink">Constantine</a>, Christianity was an illegal religion in the eyes of the Roman state.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> For the first two centuries of its existence, Christianity and its practitioners were unpopular with the people at large.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> Christians were always suspect,<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> members of a &quot;secret society&quot; whose members communicated with a private code,<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> who shied away from the public sphere.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> It was popular hostility—the anger of the crowd—which drove the earliest persecutions, not official action.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> In <a href="Lyon" class="uri" title="wikilink">Lyon</a> in 177, it was only the intervention of civil authorities that stopped the pagan mob from dragging Christians from their houses and beating every last one of them to death. The governor of <a href="Bithynia_et_Pontus" title="wikilink">Bithynia–Pontus</a>, <a href="Pliny_the_Younger" title="wikilink">Pliny</a>, was sent long lists of denunciations by anonymous citizens.

<p>To the followers of the traditional cults, Christians were odd creatures: not quite Roman, but not quite <a href="barbarian" class="uri" title="wikilink">barbarian</a> either.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> Their practices were deeply threatening to traditional mores. Christians rejected public festivals, refused to take part in the <a href="Imperial_cult_(ancient_Rome)" title="wikilink">imperial cult</a>, avoided public office, and publicly criticized ancient traditions.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> Conversions tore families apart: <a href="Justin_Martyr" title="wikilink">Justin Martyr</a> tells of a pagan husband who denounced his Christian wife; <a href="Tertullian" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tertullian</a> of children disinherited for becoming Christians.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> Traditional Roman religion was inextricably interwoven with the fabric of Roman society and state, but Christians refused to observe its practices.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a>{{#tag:ref|Early pagan opponents of the Christians would see their God as a political criminal, executed under a governor of Judea for proclaiming himself &quot;King of the Jews&quot;, and note that their holy texts included an allegorical attack on the Roman state that prophesied its imminent destruction (<a href="Book_of_Revelation" title="wikilink">Revelation</a>). These arguments were less effective as time went on, since Christians were visibly apolitical.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a>|group=notes}} In the words of <a href="Tacitus" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tacitus</a>, Christians &quot;hated the human race&quot; (<em>odium generis humani</em>).<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> Among the more credulous, Christians were thought to use black magic in pursuit of revolutionary aims,<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> and to practice incest and cannibalism.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
<p>Nonetheless, for the first two centuries of the Christian era, no emperor issued general laws against the faith or its Church. Persecutions, such as they were, were carried out under the authority of local government officials.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> At Bithynia–Pontus in 111, it was the imperial governor, Pliny;<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> at <a href="Smyrna" class="uri" title="wikilink">Smyrna</a> (<a href="&lt;U+0130&gt;zmir" class="uri" title="wikilink">&lt;U+0130&gt;zmir</a>) in 156 and Scilli near <a href="Carthage" class="uri" title="wikilink">Carthage</a> in 180, it was the <a href="proconsul" class="uri" title="wikilink">proconsul</a>;<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> at Lyon in 177, it was the <a href="Roman_governor#Senatorial_provinces" title="wikilink">provincial governor</a>.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> When Emperor <a href="Nero" class="uri" title="wikilink">Nero</a> executed Christians for their alleged involvement in the <a href="Great_Fire_of_Rome" title="wikilink">fire of 64</a>, it was a purely local affair; it did not spread beyond the city limits of Rome.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> These early persecutions were certainly violent, but they were sporadic, brief, and limited in extent.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> They were of limited threat to Christianity as a whole.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> The very capriciousness of official action, however, made the threat of state coercion loom large in the Christian imagination.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a></p>
<p>In the third century, the pattern changed. Emperors became more active, and government officials began to actively pursue Christians, rather than merely respond to the will of the crowd.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> Christianity, too, changed. No longer were its practitioners merely &quot;the lower orders fomenting discontent&quot;; some Christians were now rich, or of high pedigree. Origen, writing at about 248, tells of &quot;the multitude of people coming in to the faith, even rich men and persons in positions of honour, and ladies of high refinement and birth&quot;.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> Official reaction grew firmer.

Church leaders, like <a href="Pope_Fabian" title="wikilink">Fabian</a>, <a href="bishop_of_Rome" title="wikilink">bishop of Rome</a>, and <a href="Babylas_of_Antioch" title="wikilink">Babylas</a>, <a href="Patriarch_of_Antioch" title="wikilink">bishop of Antioch</a>, were arrested, tried, and executed,<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> as were certain members of the Christian laity, like <a href="Pionius" class="uri" title="wikilink">Pionius</a> of Smyrna.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a>{{#tag:ref|Although some members of the laity were persecuted, the primary targets of official action were always the clergy and the more prominent lay Christians.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a>|group=notes}} The Christian theologian <a href="Origen" class="uri" title="wikilink">Origen</a> was tortured during the persecution, and died about a year after from the resulting injuries.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a></p>
<p>The Decian persecution was a grave blow to the Church.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> At Carthage there was mass apostasy (renunciation of the faith);<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> at Smyrna, the bishop, Euctemon, sacrificed, and encouraged others to do the same.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> Because the Church was largely urban, it should have been easy to identify, isolate, and destroy the Church hierarchy. This did not happen. In June 251, Decius died in battle, leaving his persecution incomplete. His persecutions were not followed up for another six years, allowing some Church functions to resume.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> <a href="Valerian_(emperor)" title="wikilink">Valerian</a>, Decius's friend, took up the imperial mantle in 253. Though he was at first thought of as &quot;exceptionally friendly&quot; towards the Christians,<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> his actions soon showed otherwise. On July 257, he issued a new persecutionary edict. As punishment for following the Christian faith, Christians were to face exile or condemnation to the mines. In August 258, he issued a second edict, making the punishment death. This persecution also stalled in June 260, when Valerian was captured in battle and executed. His son, Gallienus (<em>r</em>. 260–68) ended the persecution,<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> and inaugurated a &quot;little peace of the Church&quot;.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> The peace would be undisturbed, save for occasional, isolated persecutions, until Diocletian became emperor.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="persecution-and-tetrarchic-ideology">Persecution and Tetrarchic ideology</h3>
<p><img src="DSC04500i_Istanbul_-_Museo_archeol._-_Diocleziano_(284-205_d.C.)_-_Foto_G._Dall&#39;Orto_28-5-2006.jpg" title="fig:Head from a statue of Diocletian at the Istanbul Archaeological Museum" alt="Head from a statue of Diocletian at the Istanbul Archaeological Museum" /> Diocletian, acclaimed emperor on November 20, 284, was a religious conservative, faithful to the traditional Roman cult. Unlike <a href="Aurelian" class="uri" title="wikilink">Aurelian</a> (<em>r</em>. 270–75), Diocletian did not foster any new cult of his own. He preferred older gods, <a href="Twelve_Olympians" title="wikilink">Olympian gods</a>.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> Nonetheless, Diocletian did wish to inspire a general religious revival.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> As the <a href="panegyrist" class="uri" title="wikilink">panegyrist</a> to Maximian declared: &quot;You have heaped the gods with altars and statues, temples and offerings, which you dedicated with your own name and your own image, whose sanctity is increased by the example you set, of veneration for the gods. Surely, men will now understand what power resides in the gods, when you worship them so fervently.&quot;<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a> As part of his plans for revival, Diocletian invested in religious construction. One quarter of all inscriptions referring to temple repairs in North Africa between 276 and 395 date to Diocletian's reign.<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> Diocletian associated himself with the head of the Roman pantheon, Jupiter; his co-emperor, Maximian, associated himself with <a href="Hercules" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hercules</a>.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a> This connection between god and emperor helped to legitimize the emperors' claims to power, and tied imperial government closer to the traditional cult.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a></p>
<p>Diocletian did not favor Jupiter and Hercules alone, which would have been a drastic change in the pagan tradition; <a href="Elagabalus" class="uri" title="wikilink">Elagabalus</a> had tried fostering his own god and no others, and had failed dramatically. He built temples for <a href="Isis" class="uri" title="wikilink">Isis</a> and <a href="Sarapis" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sarapis</a> at Rome and a temple to <a href="Sol_Invictus" title="wikilink">Sol</a> in Italy.<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a> Diocletian favored gods who provided for the safety of the whole empire, instead of the local deities of the provinces. In Africa, Diocletian's revival focused on Jupiter, Hercules, Mercury, Apollo, and the Imperial Cult; the cult of Saturn, the Romanized <a href="Ba&#39;al#Ba&#39;al_of_Carthage" title="wikilink">Baal-Hammon</a>, was neglected.<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a> In imperial iconography, too, Jupiter and Hercules were pervasive.<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a> The same pattern of favoritism affected Egypt as well. Native Egyptian deities saw no revival, nor was the sacred <a href="Egyptian_hieroglyphs" title="wikilink">hieroglyphic script</a> used. Uniformity in worship was central to Diocletian's religious policies.<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a></p>
<p>Diocletian, like <a href="Augustus" class="uri" title="wikilink">Augustus</a> and <a href="Trajan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Trajan</a> before him, styled himself a &quot;restorer&quot;. He urged the public to see his reign, and his governing system, the <a href="Tetrarchy" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tetrarchy</a> (rule by four emperors), as a renewal of traditional Roman values, and a return to the &quot;Golden Age of Rome&quot; after the <a href="Crisis_of_the_Third_Century" title="wikilink">anarchic third century</a>.<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a> As such, he reinforced the long-standing Roman preference for ancient customs, and Imperial opposition to independent societies. The Diocletianic regime's activist stance, however, and Diocletian's belief in the power of central government to effect major change in morals and society, made him unusual. Most earlier emperors tended to be quite cautious in their administrative policies, preferring to work within existing structures rather than overhauling them.<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a> Diocletian, by contrast, was willing to reform every aspect of public life to satisfy his goals. Under his rule, coinage, taxation, architecture, law, and history were all radically reconstructed to reflect his authoritarian and conservative ideology. The reformation of the empire's &quot;moral fabric&quot;—and the elimination of religious minorities—was simply one step in that process.<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a></p>
<p>The unique position of the Christians and Jews of the empire became increasingly apparent. The Jews had earned imperial toleration on account of the great antiquity of their faith.<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a> They had been exempted from Decius's persecution,<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a> and continued to enjoy freedom from persecution under Tetrarchic government.{{#tag:ref|The Palestinian Talmud records that when Diocletian paid a visit to the region, he decreed that &quot;sacrifices should be offered by all the people except the Jews&quot;.<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a>|group=notes}} Christians had no such excuse, because their faith was new and unfamiliar,<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a> and not typically identified with Judaism by this time.<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a> Moreover, Christians had been distancing themselves from their Jewish heritage for their entire history.<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a></p>
<p>Persecution was not the only outlet of the Tetrarchy's moral fervor. In 295, either Diocletian or his <a href="Caesar_(title)" title="wikilink">Caesar</a> (subordinate emperor), Galerius,<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a> issued an edict from <a href="Damascus" class="uri" title="wikilink">Damascus</a> proscribing incestuous marriages, and affirming the supremacy of Roman law over local law.<a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a>{{#tag:ref| The edict illegalized sibling marriage, which had long been customary in the East.<a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a>|group=notes}} Its preamble insists that it is every emperor's duty to enforce the sacred precepts of Roman law, for &quot;the immortal gods themselves will favour and be at peace with the Roman name...if we have seen to it that all subject to our rule entirely lead a pious, religious, peaceable and chaste life in every respect&quot;.<a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a> These principles, if given their full extension, would logically require Roman emperors to enforce conformity in religion.<a href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a></p>

<p>At the conclusion of the <a href="Roman&lt;U+2013&gt;Persian_Wars" title="wikilink">Persian wars</a> in 299, co-emperors Diocletian and Galerius traveled from Persia to Syrian <a href="Antioch" class="uri" title="wikilink">Antioch</a> (<a href="Antakya" class="uri" title="wikilink">Antakya</a>). The Christian rhetor <a href="Lactantius" class="uri" title="wikilink">Lactantius</a> records that, at Antioch some time in 299, the emperors were engaged in sacrifice and <a href="divination" class="uri" title="wikilink">divination</a> in an attempt to predict the future. The <em><a href="haruspex" title="wikilink">haruspices</a></em>, diviners of omens from sacrificed animals, were unable to read the sacrificed animals, and failed to do so after repeated trials. The master <em>haruspex</em> eventually declared that this failure was the result of interruptions in the process caused by profane men. Certain Christians in the imperial household had been observed making the <a href="Sign_of_the_Cross" title="wikilink">sign of the cross</a> during the ceremonies, and were alleged to have disrupted the <em>haruspices</em>{{'}} divination. Diocletian, enraged by this turn of events, declared that all members of the court must make a sacrifice themselves. Diocletian and Galerius also sent letters to the military command, demanding that the entire army perform the sacrifices or else face discharge.<a href="#fn101" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref101"><sup>101</sup></a>{{#tag:ref|Helgeland places the event in 301.<a href="#fn102" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref102"><sup>102</sup></a> Barnes argued for a date of 302 or &quot;not long before&quot; in 1976;<a href="#fn103" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref103"><sup>103</sup></a> but accepted a date of 299 in 1981.<a href="#fn104" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref104"><sup>104</sup></a> Woods argues for a date of 297, on the grounds that Diocletian and Galerius were both in the area at this time, and because Eusebius's <em>Chronicle</em> associates the persecution with Galerius's defeat by <a href="Narseh" class="uri" title="wikilink">Narseh</a>.

<p>Eusebius of Caesarea, a contemporary ecclesiastical historian, tells a similar story: commanders were told to give their troops the choice of sacrifice or loss of rank. These terms were strong—a soldier would lose his career in the military, his state pension and his personal savings—but not fatal. According to Eusebius, the purge was broadly successful, but Eusebius is confused about the technicalities of the event and his characterization of the overall size of the apostasy is ambiguous.<a href="#fn107" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref107"><sup>107</sup></a> Eusebius also attributes the initiative for the purge to Galerius, rather than Diocletian.<a href="#fn108" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref108"><sup>108</sup></a></p>
<p>Modern scholar Peter Davies surmises that Eusebius is referring to the same event as Lactantius, but that he heard of the event through public rumors, and knew nothing of the privileged discussion at the emperor's private religion ceremony that Lactantius had access to. Since it was Galerius's army that would have been purged—Diocletian had left his in Egypt to quell continuing unrest—Antiochenes would understandably have believed Galerius to be its instigator.<a href="#fn109" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref109"><sup>109</sup></a> The historian David Woods argues instead that Eusebius and Lactantius are referring to completely different events. Eusebius, according to Woods, describes the beginnings of the army purge in Palestine, while Lactantius describes events at court.<a href="#fn110" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref110"><sup>110</sup></a> Woods asserts that the relevant passage in Eusebius's <em>Chronicon</em> was corrupted in the translation to Latin, and that Eusebius's text originally located the beginnings of the army persecution at a fort in Betthorus (El-Lejjun, Jordan).<a href="#fn111" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref111"><sup>111</sup></a></p>

<p>Affairs quieted after the initial persecution. Diocletian remained in Antioch for the following three years.

<p>Among all the other arrangements that we are always making for the benefit and utility of the state, we have heretofore wished to repair all things in accordance with the laws and public discipline of the Romans, and to ensure that even the Christians, who abandoned the practice of their ancestors, should return to good sense. Indeed, for some reason or other, such self-indulgence assailed and idiocy possessed those Christians, that they did not follow the practices of the ancients, which their own ancestors had, perhaps, instituted, but according to their own will and as it pleased them, they made laws for themselves that they observed, and gathered various peoples in diverse areas. Then when our order was issued stating that they should return themselves to the practices of the ancients, many were subjected to peril, and many were even killed. Many more persevered in their way of life, and we saw that they neither offered proper worship and cult to the gods, or to the god of the Christians. Considering the observation of our own mild clemency and eternal custom, by which we are accustomed to grant clemency to all people, we have decided to extend our most speedy indulgence to these people as well, so that Christians may once more establish their own meeting places, so long as they do not act in a disorderly way. We are about to send another letter to our officials detailing the conditions they ought to observe. Consequently, in accord with our indulgence, they ought to pray to their god for our health and the safety of the state, so that the state may be kept safe on all sides, and they may be able to live safely and securely in their own homes.<a href="#fn191" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref191"><sup>191</sup></a></p>

<p>Galerius's words reinforce the Tetrarchy's theological basis for the persecution; the acts did nothing more than attempt to enforce traditional civic and religious practices, even if the edicts themselves were thoroughly nontraditional.

<p>While the persecution under Constantius was relatively light, there is no doubt about the force of the persecution in Maximian's domain.

For the Numidians, to hand over scriptures was an act of terrible apostasy.<a href="#fn227" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref227"><sup>227</sup></a> Africa had long been home to the &quot;Church of the martyrs&quot;<a href="#fn228" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref228"><sup>228</sup></a>—in Africa, martyrs held more religious authority than the clergy<a href="#fn229" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref229"><sup>229</sup></a>—and harbored a particularly intransigent, fanatical, and legalistic variety of Christianity.<a href="#fn230" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref230"><sup>230</sup></a> It was Africa that gave the West most of its martyrdoms.<a href="#fn231" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref231"><sup>231</sup></a></p>

Anullinus, proconsul of Africa, expanded on the edict, deciding that, in addition to the destruction the Christians' scriptures and churches, the government should compel Christians to sacrifice to the gods.<a href="#fn234" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref234"><sup>234</sup></a> Governor Valerius Florus enforced the same policy in Numidia during the summer or autumn of 303, when he called for &quot;days of incense burning&quot;; Christians would sacrifice or they would lose their lives.<a href="#fn235" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref235"><sup>235</sup></a> In addition to those already listed, African martyrs also include Saturninus and the <a href="Martyrs_of_Abitina" title="wikilink">Martyrs of Abitina</a>,<a href="#fn236" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref236"><sup>236</sup></a> another group martyred on February 12, 304 in Carthage,<a href="#fn237" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref237"><sup>237</sup></a> and the martyrs of Milevis (<a href="Mila,_Algeria" title="wikilink">Mila, Algeria</a>).<a href="#fn238" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref238"><sup>238</sup></a></p>
<p>The persecution in Africa also encouraged the development of <a href="Donatist" title="wikilink">Donatism</a>, a schismatic movement that forbade any compromise with Roman government or <em><a href="traditors" title="wikilink">traditor</a></em> bishops (those who had handed scriptures over to secular authorities). One of the key moments in the break with the mainline Church occurred in Carthage in 304. The Christians from Abitinae had been brought to the city and imprisoned. Friends and relatives of the prisoners came to visit, but encountered resistance from a local mob. The group was harassed, beaten, and whipped; the food they had brought for their imprisoned friends was scattered on the ground. The mob had been sent by <a href="Mensurius" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mensurius</a>, the bishop of the city, and <a href="Caecilianus" title="wikilink">Caecilian</a>, his deacon, for reasons that remain obscure.<a href="#fn239" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref239"><sup>239</sup></a> In 311, Caecilian was elected bishop of Carthage.

<p>Maximian probably seized the Christian property in Rome quite easily—Roman cemeteries were noticeable, and Christian meeting places could have been easily found out.

<p>What followed Marcellinus's act of <em>traditio</em>, if it ever actually happened, is unclear. There appears to have been a break in the episcopal succession, however. Marcellinus seems to have died on October 25, 304, and (if he had apostatized) was probably expelled from the church in early 303,<a href="#fn248" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref248"><sup>248</sup></a> but his successor, <a href="Pope_Marcellus_I" title="wikilink">Marcellus</a>, was not consecrated until either November or December 306.<a href="#fn249" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref249"><sup>249</sup></a> In the meantime, two factions diverged in the Roman church, separating the lapsed, Christians who had complied with the edicts to ensure their own safety, and the rigorists, those who would brook no compromise with secular authority.

<p>Palestine is the only region for which an extended local perspective of the persecution exists, in the form of Eusebius's <em>Martyrs of Palestine</em>. Eusebius was resident in Caesarea, the capital of Palestine, for the duration of the persecution, although he also traveled to Phoenicia and Egypt, and perhaps Arabia as well.<a href="#fn280" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref280"><sup>280</sup></a> Eusebius's account is imperfect. It focuses on martyrs that were his personal friends before the persecutions began, and includes martyrs that took place outside of Palestine.<a href="#fn281" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref281"><sup>281</sup></a> His coverage is uneven. He provides only bare generalities at the bloody end of the persecutions, for example.<a href="#fn282" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref282"><sup>282</sup></a> Eusebius recognizes some of his faults. At the outset of his account of the general persecution in the <em>Ecclesiastical History</em>, Eusebius laments the incompleteness of his reportage: &quot;how could one number the multitude of martyrs in each province, and especially those in Africa and Mauretania, and in Thebaid and Egypt?&quot;<a href="#fn283" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref283"><sup>283</sup></a></p>
<p>Since no one below the status of governor held the legal power to enforce capital punishment, most recalcitrant Christians would have been sent to Caesarea to await punishment.<a href="#fn284" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref284"><sup>284</sup></a> The first martyr, <a href="Procopius_of_Scythopolis" title="wikilink">Procopius</a>, was sent to Caesarea from Scythopolis (<a href="Beit_She&#39;an" title="wikilink">Beit She'an</a>, <a href="Israel" class="uri" title="wikilink">Israel</a>), where he had been a <a href="Reader_(liturgy)" title="wikilink">reader</a> and an exorcist. He was brought before the governor on June 7, 303, and asked to sacrifice to the gods, and to pour a <a href="libation" class="uri" title="wikilink">libation</a> for the emperors. Procopius responded by quoting <a href="Homer" class="uri" title="wikilink">Homer</a>: &quot;the lordship of many is not a good thing; let there be one ruler, one king&quot;. The governor beheaded the man at once.<a href="#fn285" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref285"><sup>285</sup></a></p>
<p>Further martyrdoms followed in the months thereafter,<a href="#fn286" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref286"><sup>286</sup></a> increasing in the next spring, when the new governor, Urbanus, published the fourth edict.<a href="#fn287" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref287"><sup>287</sup></a> Eusebius probably does not list a complete account of all those executed under the fourth edict—he alludes in passing to others imprisoned with Thecla, for example, though he does not name them.<a href="#fn288" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref288"><sup>288</sup></a></p>

He issued his own persecutionary edict in the spring of 306, ordering general sacrifice.<a href="#fn291" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref291"><sup>291</sup></a> The edict of 304 had been difficult to enforce, since the Imperial government had no record of city-dwelling subjects who held no agricultural land.<a href="#fn292" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref292"><sup>292</sup></a> Galerius solved this problem in 306 by running another census. This contained the names of all urban heads of household and the number of their dependents (past censuses had only listed persons paying tax on land, such as landowners and tenants).<a href="#fn293" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref293"><sup>293</sup></a> Using lists drawn up by the civil service, Maximinus ordered his heralds to call all men, women, and children down to the temples. There, after <a href="tribune" title="wikilink">tribunes</a> called everyone by name, everyone sacrificed.<a href="#fn294" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref294"><sup>294</sup></a></p>
<p>At some point after the publication of Maximinus's first edict, perhaps in 307, Maximinus changed the penalty for transgressions. Instead of receiving the death penalty, Christians would now be mutilated and condemned to labor in state-owned mines.<a href="#fn295" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref295"><sup>295</sup></a> Since Egyptian mines were overstaffed, mostly due to the influx of Christian prisoners, Egyptian penitents were increasingly sent to the copper mines at Phaeno in Palestine and <a href="Cilicia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Cilicia</a> in Asia Minor. At Diocaesarea (<a href="Tzippori" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tzippori</a>, Israel) in the spring of 308, 97 Christian confessors were received by Firmilianus from the porphyry mines in the <a href="Thebaid" class="uri" title="wikilink">Thebaid</a>. Firmilianus cut the tendons on their left feet, blinded their right eyes, and sent them to the mines of Palestine.<a href="#fn296" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref296"><sup>296</sup></a>{{#tag:ref|S.

Diocaesarea, however, was noted for its Jewishness long thereafter.<a href="#fn298" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref298"><sup>298</sup></a>|group=notes}} On another occasion, 130 others received the same punishment. Some were sent to Phaeno, and some to Cilicia.<a href="#fn299" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref299"><sup>299</sup></a></p>
<p>Eusebius characterizes Urbanus as a man who enjoyed some variety in his punishments. One day, shortly after Easter 307, he ordered the virgin Theodosia from <a href="Tyre,_Lebanon" title="wikilink">Tyre</a> (&lt;U+1E62&gt;&lt;U+016B&gt;r, <a href="Lebanon" class="uri" title="wikilink">Lebanon</a>) thrown to the sea for conversing with Christians attending trial and refusing sacrifice; the Christians in court, meanwhile, he sent to Phaeno.<a href="#fn300" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref300"><sup>300</sup></a> On a single day, November 2, 307, Urbanus sentenced a man named Domninus to be burned alive, three youths to fight as <a href="gladiator" title="wikilink">gladiators</a>, and a priest to be exposed to a beast. On the same day, he ordered some young men to be castrated, sent three virgins to brothels, and imprisoned a number of others, including <a href="Pamphilus_of_Caesarea" title="wikilink">Pamphilus of Caesarea</a>, a priest, scholar, and defender of the theologian Origen.<a href="#fn301" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref301"><sup>301</sup></a> Soon after, and for unknown reasons, Urbanus was stripped of his rank, imprisoned, tried, and executed, all in one day of expedited proceedings.<a href="#fn302" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref302"><sup>302</sup></a> His replacement, <a href="Firmilian_(Roman_governor)" title="wikilink">Firmilianus</a>, was a veteran soldier and one of Maximinus's trusted confidants.<a href="#fn303" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref303"><sup>303</sup></a></p>
<p>Eusebius notes that this event marked the beginning of a temporary respite from persecution.<a href="#fn304" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref304"><sup>304</sup></a> Although the precise dating of this respite is not specifically noted by Eusebius, the text of the <em>Martyrs</em> records no Palestinian martyrs between July 25, 308 and November 13, 309.<a href="#fn305" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref305"><sup>305</sup></a> The political climate probably impinged on persecutionary policy here: This was the period of the conference of Carnuntum, which met in November 308. Maximinus probably spent the next few months in discussion with Galerius over his role in the imperial government, and did not have the time to deal with the Christians.<a href="#fn306" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref306"><sup>306</sup></a></p>
<p>In the autumn of 309,<a href="#fn307" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref307"><sup>307</sup></a> Maximinus resumed persecution by issuing letters to provincial governors and his <a href="praetorian_prefect" title="wikilink">praetorian prefect</a>, the highest authority in judicial proceedings after the emperor, demanding that Christians conform to pagan customs. His new legislation called for another general sacrifice, coupled with a general offering of libations. It was even more systematic than the first, allowing no exceptions for infants or servants. <em>Logistai</em> (<em>curatores</em>), <em><a href="strategos" title="wikilink">strategoi</a></em>, <em><a href="duumviri" class="uri" title="wikilink">duumviri</a></em>, and <em>tabularii</em>, who kept the records, saw to it that there were no evasions.<a href="#fn308" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref308"><sup>308</sup></a> Maximinus introduced some innovations to the process, making him the only known persecuting emperor to have done so.<a href="#fn309" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref309"><sup>309</sup></a> This edict now required food sold in the marketplaces to be covered in libation. Maximinus sent sentries to stand guard at bathhouses and city gates to ensure that all customers sacrificed.<a href="#fn310" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref310"><sup>310</sup></a> He issued copies of the fictitious <em>Acts of Pilate</em> to encourage popular hatred of Christ. Prostitutes confessed, under judicial torture, to having engaged in debaucheries with Christians. Bishops were reassigned to work as stable boys for the Imperial horse guard or keepers of the Imperial camels.<a href="#fn311" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref311"><sup>311</sup></a></p>
<p>Maximinus also worked for a revival of pagan religion. He appointed high priests for each province, men who were to wear white robes and supervise daily worship of the gods.<a href="#fn312" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref312"><sup>312</sup></a> Maximinus also demanded that vigorous restoration work be done on decaying temples within his domain.<a href="#fn313" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref313"><sup>313</sup></a></p>
<p>The next few months saw the worst extremes of the persecution.<a href="#fn314" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref314"><sup>314</sup></a> On December 13, 309, Firmilianus condemned some Egyptians arrested at Ascalon (<a href="Ashkelon" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ashkelon</a>, Israel) on their way to visit the confessors in Cilicia. Three were beheaded; the rest lost their left feet and right eyes. On January 10, 310, Peter and the bishop Asclepius from the dualist Christian sect <a href="Marcionism" class="uri" title="wikilink">Marcionism</a>, both from Anaia, near (<a href="Eleutheropolis" class="uri" title="wikilink">Eleutheropolis</a>, Israel), were burned alive.<a href="#fn315" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref315"><sup>315</sup></a> On February 16, Pamphilus and his six companions were executed. In the aftermath, four more members of Pamphilus's household were martyred for their displays of sympathy for the condemned. The last martyrs before Galerius's edict of toleration were executed on March 5 and 7.<a href="#fn316" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref316"><sup>316</sup></a> Then the executions stopped. Eusebius does not explain this sudden halt, but it coincides with the replacement of Firmilianus with Valentinianus, a man appointed at some time before Galerius's death.<a href="#fn317" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref317"><sup>317</sup></a> The replacement is only attested to via <a href="Epigraphy" title="wikilink">epigraphic</a> remains, like stone inscriptions; Eusebius does not mention Valentinianus anywhere in his writings.<a href="#fn318" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref318"><sup>318</sup></a></p>
<h4 id="after-galeriuss-edict-of-toleration">After Galerius's edict of toleration</h4>
<p>After Galerius's death, Maximinus seized Asia Minor.<a href="#fn319" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref319"><sup>319</sup></a> Even after Galerius's edict of toleration in 311, Maximinus continued to persecute.<a href="#fn320" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref320"><sup>320</sup></a> His name is absent from the list of emperors publishing Galerius's edict of toleration, perhaps through later suppression.<a href="#fn321" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref321"><sup>321</sup></a> Eusebius states that Maximinus complied with its provisions only reluctantly.<a href="#fn322" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref322"><sup>322</sup></a> Maximinus told his praetorian prefect Sabinus to write to provincial governors, requesting that they and their subordinates ignore &quot;that letter&quot; (Galerius's edict).<a href="#fn323" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref323"><sup>323</sup></a> Christians were to be free from molestation, and their mere Christianity would not leave them open to criminal charges. Unlike Galerius's edict, however, Maximinus's letter made no provisions for Christian assembly, nor did he suggest that Christians build more churches.<a href="#fn324" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref324"><sup>324</sup></a></p>
<p>Maximinus issued orders in Autumn 311 forbidding Christians to congregate in cemeteries.<a href="#fn325" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref325"><sup>325</sup></a> After issuing these orders, he was approached by embassies from cities within his domain, demanding he begin a general persecution.

This rescript was published in Sardis on April 6, 312, and in Tyre by May or June.<a href="#fn332" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref332"><sup>332</sup></a> There are three surviving copies of Maximinus's rescript, in Tyre, <a href="Arycanda" class="uri" title="wikilink">Arycanda</a> (Aykiri&lt;U+00E7&gt;ay, Turkey), and Colbasa.

<p>When Maximinus received notice that Constantine had succeeded in his campaign against Maxentius, he issued a new letter restoring Christians their former liberties.<a href="#fn335" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref335"><sup>335</sup></a> The text of this letter, which is preserved in Eusebius's <em>Historia Ecclesiastica</em>, however, suggests that the initiative was Maximinus's alone, and not that of Constantine or Licinius. It is also the only passage in the ancient sources providing Maximinus's rationale for his actions, without the hostility of Lactantius and Eusebius. Maximinus states that he supported Diocletian and Galerius's early legislation but, upon being made Caesar, came to realize the drain such policies would have on his labor force, and began to employ persuasion without coercion.<a href="#fn336" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref336"><sup>336</sup></a> He goes on to assert that he resisted petitions from Nicomedians to forbid Christians from their city (an event Eusebius does not otherwise record),<a href="#fn337" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref337"><sup>337</sup></a> and that when he accepted the demands of deputations from other cities he was only following imperial custom.<a href="#fn338" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref338"><sup>338</sup></a> Maximinus concludes his letter by referencing the letter he wrote after Galerius's edict, asking that his subordinates be lenient.

<p>In the early spring of 313, as Licinius advanced against Maximinus, the latter resorted to savagery in his dealings with his own citizens, and his Christians in particular.<a href="#fn340" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref340"><sup>340</sup></a> In May 313,<a href="#fn341" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref341"><sup>341</sup></a> Maximinus issued one more edict of toleration, hoping to persuade Licinius to stop advancing, and win more public support. For the first time, Maximinus issued a law which offered comprehensive toleration and the means to effectively secure it. As in his earlier letter, Maximinus is apologetic but one-sided.<a href="#fn342" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref342"><sup>342</sup></a> Maximinus absolves himself for all the failings of his policy, locating fault with local judges and enforcers instead.<a href="#fn343" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref343"><sup>343</sup></a> He frames the new universal toleration as a means of removing all ambiguity and extortion. Maximinus then declares full freedom of religious practice, encourages Christians to rebuild their churches, and pledges to restore Christian property lost in the persecution.<a href="#fn344" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref344"><sup>344</sup></a> The edict changed little: Licinius defeated Maximinus at the Battle of Adrianople on April 30, 313;<a href="#fn345" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref345"><sup>345</sup></a> the now-powerless Maximinus committed suicide at Tarsus in the summer of 313.

<h3 id="egypt">Egypt</h3>
<p>In Eusebius' <em>Martyrs of Palestine</em>, Egypt is covered only in passing. When Eusebius remarks on the region, however, he writes of tens, twenties, even hundreds of Christians put to death on a single day, which would seem to make Egypt the region that suffered the most during the persecutions.<a href="#fn347" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref347"><sup>347</sup></a> In Egypt, Peter of Alexandria fled his namesake city early on in the persecution, leaving the Church leaderless. <a href="Meletius_of_Lycopolis" title="wikilink">Meletius</a>, bishop of Lycopolis (<a href="Asyut" class="uri" title="wikilink">Asyut</a>), took up the job in his place. Meletius performed ordinations without Peter's permission, which caused some bishops to complain to Peter. Meletius soon refused to treat Peter as any kind of authority, and expanded his operations into Alexandria. According to <a href="Epiphanius_of_Salamis" title="wikilink">Epiphanius of Salamis</a>, the Church split into two sections: the &quot;Catholic Church&quot;, under Peter, and, after Peter's execution, <a href="Pope_Alexander_of_Alexandria" title="wikilink">Alexander</a>; and the &quot;Church of the Martyrs&quot; under Meletius.<a href="#fn348" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref348"><sup>348</sup></a> When the two groups found themselves imprisoned together in Alexandria during the persecution, Peter of Alexandria drew up a curtain in the middle of their cell. He then said: &quot;There are some who are of my view, let them come over on my side, and those of Melitius's view, stay with Melitius.&quot; Thus divided, the two sects went on with their affairs, purposely ignoring each others' existence.<a href="#fn349" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref349"><sup>349</sup></a> The schism continued to grow throughout the persecution, even with its leaders in jail,<a href="#fn350" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref350"><sup>350</sup></a> and would persist long after the deaths of both Peter and Meletius.<a href="#fn351" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref351"><sup>351</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="legacy">Legacy</h2>
<p>The Diocletianic persecution was ultimately unsuccessful. As one modern historian has put it, it was simply &quot;too little and too late&quot;.<a href="#fn352" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref352"><sup>352</sup></a> Christians were never purged systematically in any part of the empire, and Christian evasion continually undermined the edicts' enforcement.<a href="#fn353" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref353"><sup>353</sup></a> Some bribed their way to freedom.<a href="#fn354" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref354"><sup>354</sup></a> The Christian Copres escaped on a technicality: To avoid sacrificing in court, he gave his brother power of attorney, and had him do it instead.<a href="#fn355" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref355"><sup>355</sup></a> Many simply fled. Eusebius, in his <em>Vita Constantini</em>, declared that &quot;once more the fields and woods received the worshippers of God&quot;.<a href="#fn356" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref356"><sup>356</sup></a> To contemporary theologians, there was no sin in this behavior. Lactantius held that Christ himself had encouraged it,<a href="#fn357" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref357"><sup>357</sup></a> and Bishop Peter of Alexandria quoted <a href="Coming_Persecutions#10:23_The_apostles_are_to_go_from_town_to_town" title="wikilink">Matthew 10:23</a> (&quot;when they persecute you in this city, flee ye into another&quot;<a href="#fn358" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref358"><sup>358</sup></a>) in support of the tactic.<a href="#fn359" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref359"><sup>359</sup></a></p>
<p>The pagan crowd was more sympathetic to the Christians' sufferings than they had been in the past.<a href="#fn360" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref360"><sup>360</sup></a> Lactantius, Eusebius and Constantine write of revulsion at the excesses of the persecutors—Constantine of executioners &quot;wearied out, and disgusted at the cruelties&quot; they had committed.<a href="#fn361" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref361"><sup>361</sup></a> The fortitude of the martyrs in the face of death had earned the faith respectability in the past,<a href="#fn362" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref362"><sup>362</sup></a> though it may have won few converts.<a href="#fn363" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref363"><sup>363</sup></a> The thought of martyrdom, however, sustained Christians under trial and in prison, hardening their faith.<a href="#fn364" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref364"><sup>364</sup></a> Packaged with the promise of eternal life, martyrdom proved attractive for the growing segment of the pagan population which was, to quote Dodds, &quot;in love with death&quot;.<a href="#fn365" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref365"><sup>365</sup></a> To use Tertullian's famous phrase, the blood of the martyrs was the seed of the Church.<a href="#fn366" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref366"><sup>366</sup></a></p>
<p>By 324, Constantine, the Christian convert, ruled the entire empire alone. Christianity became the greatest beneficiary of imperial largesse.<a href="#fn367" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref367"><sup>367</sup></a> The persecutors had been routed. As the historian J. Liebeschuetz has written: &quot;The final result of the Great Persecution provided a testimonial to the truth of Christianity which it could have won in no other way.&quot;<a href="#fn368" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref368"><sup>368</sup></a> After Constantine, the Christianization of the Roman empire would continue apace. Under <a href="Theodosius_I" title="wikilink">Theodosius I</a> (<em>r</em>. 378–95), Christianity became the state religion.<a href="#fn369" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref369"><sup>369</sup></a> By the fifth century, Christianity was the empire's predominant faith, and filled the same role paganism had at the end of the third century.<a href="#fn370" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref370"><sup>370</sup></a> Because of the persecution, however, a number of Christian communities were riven between those who had complied with imperial authorities (<em>traditores</em>) and those who had refused. In Africa, the Donatists, who protested the election of the alleged <em>traditor</em> Caecilian to the bishopric of Carthage, continued to resist the authority of the central Church until after 411.<a href="#fn371" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref371"><sup>371</sup></a> The Melitians in Egypt left the Egyptian Church similarly divided.<a href="#fn372" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref372"><sup>372</sup></a></p>
<p>In future generations, both Christians and pagans would look back on Diocletian as, in the words of theologian <a href="Henry_Chadwick_(theologian)" title="wikilink">Henry Chadwick</a>, &quot;the embodiment of irrational ferocity&quot;.<a href="#fn373" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref373"><sup>373</sup></a> To medieval Christians, Diocletian was the most loathsome of all Roman emperors.<a href="#fn374" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref374"><sup>374</sup></a> From the fourth century on, Christians would describe the &quot;Great&quot; persecution of Diocletian's reign as a bloodbath.<a href="#fn375" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref375"><sup>375</sup></a> The <em><a href="Liber_Pontificalis" title="wikilink">Liber Pontificalis</a></em>, a collection of biographies of the popes, alleges 17,000 martyrs within a single thirty-day period.<a href="#fn376" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref376"><sup>376</sup></a> In the fourth century, Christians created a &quot;cult of martyrs&quot; in homage to the fallen.<a href="#fn377" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref377"><sup>377</sup></a> Hagiographers portrayed a persecution far more extensive than the real one had been,<a href="#fn378" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref378"><sup>378</sup></a> and the Christians responsible for this cult were loose with the facts. Their &quot;heroic age&quot; of martyrs, or &quot;<a href="Era_of_Martyrs" title="wikilink">Era of Martyrs</a>&quot;, was held to begin with Diocletian's accession to the emperorship in 284, rather than 303, when persecutions actually began; they fabricated a large number of martyrs' tales (indeed, most surviving martyrs' tales are forgeries), exaggerated the facts in others, and embroidered true accounts with miraculous details.<a href="#fn379" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref379"><sup>379</sup></a> Of the surviving martyrs' acts, only those of <a href="Agnes_of_Rome" title="wikilink">Agnes</a>, <a href="Saint_Sebastian" title="wikilink">Sebastian</a>, <a href="Felix_and_Adauctus" title="wikilink">Felix and Adauctus</a>, and <a href="Marcellinus_and_Peter" title="wikilink">Marcellinus and Peter</a> are even remotely historical.<a href="#fn380" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref380"><sup>380</sup></a> These traditional accounts were first questioned in the Enlightenment, when <a href="Henry_Dodwell" title="wikilink">Henry Dodwell</a>, <a href="Voltaire" class="uri" title="wikilink">Voltaire</a>, and, most famously, <a href="Edward_Gibbon" title="wikilink">Edward Gibbon</a> questioned traditional accounts of the Christian martyrs.<a href="#fn381" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref381"><sup>381</sup></a></p>
<p>In the final chapter of the first volume of his <em><a href="The_History_of_the_Decline_and_Fall_of_the_Roman_Empire" title="wikilink">History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire</a></em> (1776), Gibbon affirms that Christians had greatly exaggerated the scale of the persecutions they suffered.<a href="#fn382" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref382"><sup>382</sup></a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>After the church had triumphed over all her enemies, the interest as well as vanity of the captives prompted them to magnify the merit of their respective suffering. A convenient distance of time and place gave an ample scope to the progress of fiction; and the frequent instances which might be alleged of holy martyrs, whose wounds had been instantly healed, whose strength had been renewed, and whose lost members had miraculously been restored, were extremely convenient for the purpose of removing every difficulty, and of silencing every objection. The most extravagant legends, as they conduced to the honour of the church, were applauded by the incredulous multitude, countenanced by the power of the clergy, and attested by the suspicious evidence of ecclesiastical history.<a href="#fn383" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref383"><sup>383</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Throughout his history, Gibbon implies that the early Church undermined traditional Roman virtues, and thereby impaired the health of civil society.<a href="#fn384" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref384"><sup>384</sup></a> Some of Gibbon's contemporaries were displeased with the irreligious tendencies in his work, and attacked it in print.<a href="#fn385" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref385"><sup>385</sup></a> The contemporary classical scholar <a href="Richard_Porson" title="wikilink">Richard Porson</a> mocked Gibbon, writing that his humanity never slept, &quot;unless when women are ravished, or the Christians persecuted&quot;.<a href="#fn386" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref386"><sup>386</sup></a></p>
<p>Later historians, however, took Gibbon's emphases even further. As historian <a href="G._E._M._de_Ste._Croix" title="wikilink">G.E.M. de Ste. Croix</a> put it in 1954, &quot;The so-called Great Persecution has been exaggerated in the Christian tradition to an extent which even Gibbon did not fully appreciate.&quot;<a href="#fn387" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref387"><sup>387</sup></a> <a href="William_Hugh_Clifford_Frend" title="wikilink">W.H.C. Frend</a> estimates that only 3,000–3,500 Christians were killed in the persecution.<a href="#fn388" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref388"><sup>388</sup></a> Although the number of verifiably true martyrs' tales has fallen, and estimates of the total casualty rate have been reduced, some modern writers are less skeptical than Gibbon of the severity of the persecution. As the author Stephen Williams wrote in 1985, &quot;even allowing a margin for invention, what remains is terrible enough. Unlike Gibbon, we live in an age which has experienced similar things, and knows how unsound is that civilised smile of incredulity at such reports. Things can be, have been, every bit as bad as our worst imaginings.&quot;<a href="#fn389" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref389"><sup>389</sup></a></p>
