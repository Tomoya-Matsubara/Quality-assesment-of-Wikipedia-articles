<p><strong>Interstate 605</strong> (<strong>I-605</strong>) is the common designation given to several proposals for a new <a href="auxiliary_route" title="wikilink">auxiliary route</a> of the <a href="Interstate_Highway_System" title="wikilink">Interstate Highway System</a> bypassing <a href="Interstate_5_in_Washington" title="wikilink">Interstate 5</a> (I-5) and <a href="Interstate_405_(Washington)" title="wikilink">I-405</a> in <a href="Washington_(U.S._state)" title="wikilink">Washington</a>, United States. Proposals have been around since the 1960s, including routes connecting from I-5 all the way to the <a href="Canada_&lt;U+2013&gt;_United_States_border" title="wikilink">Canadian border</a>, and some just between I-5 and I-90. The <a href="Washington_State_Department_of_Transportation" title="wikilink">Washington State Department of Transportation</a> has no projects designated I-605 at this time; however a project converting <a href="Washington_State_Route_18" title="wikilink">Washington State Route 18</a> to a full limited-access freeway is under construction currently.</p>
<h2 id="proposals">Proposals</h2>
<p>Some of the first plans for a new interstate freeway, bypassing I-405, surfaced in 1968. The first proposal was to create a new highway between I-405 and the west banks of <a href="Lake_Sammamish" title="wikilink">Lake Sammamish</a>. Residents however forced the highway to the east banks of the lake after voicing their concerns. Residents on the east side of the lake voiced similar concerns and the plan was subsequently dropped.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1998, the <a href="Washington_State_Legislature" title="wikilink">Washington State Legislature</a> ordered a $500,000 (equivalent to $ in ) study to investigate the benefits of extending <a href="Washington_State_Route_18" title="wikilink">Washington State Route 18</a> north to <a href="Everett,_Washington" title="wikilink">Everett</a> through the <a href="Snoqualmie_Valley" title="wikilink">Snoqualmie Valley</a>. The plan was dropped as the study found that on average only five minutes would be saved over current routes.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> In 2002, <a href="Bellevue_Square" title="wikilink">Bellevue Square</a> owner Kemper Freeman Jr. made his support known for a new freeway linking <a href="Snohomish_County,_Washington" title="wikilink">Snohomish County</a> via the Snoqualmie Valley.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>Another $500,000 (equivalent to $ in ) study was ordered in 2003 by the legislature, creating a new <a href="commerce_corridor" title="wikilink">commerce corridor</a> linking <a href="Lewis_County,_Washington" title="wikilink">Lewis County</a> in the south to the <a href="Canada_&lt;U+2013&gt;_United_States_border" title="wikilink">Canada &lt;U+2013&gt; United States border</a> in the north.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> However the study showed that a route existing north of Interstate 90 was not economically feasible. The study proposed a <a href="toll_road" title="wikilink">toll road</a> only for trucks, as passenger cars would discourage truck drivers from using the new alternate route. The highway was estimated to cost between $13.5 and $19 billion (equivalent to between $ and $ billion in ) dollars.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
