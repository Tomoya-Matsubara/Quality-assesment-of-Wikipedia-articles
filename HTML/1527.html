<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<p>The Sherwood Valley Rancheria is a community of Coastal <a href="Pomo" class="uri" title="wikilink">Pomo</a> Indians, who are indigenous to Sonoma and Mendocino Counties in northern California. Their historical community was called Kul&lt;U+00E1&gt; Kai Pomo, and they traditionally lived along the upper course of the <a href="Eel_River_(California)" title="wikilink">Eel River</a>. They spoke the <a href="Pomoan_languages" title="wikilink">Pomo language</a>. The last traditional chief of the Kul&lt;U+00E1&gt; Kai Pomo was Lunkaya.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>Russians were the first non-Indians with whom the Pomo had sustained contact. They withdrew, only to be replaced by increasing numbers of European-Americans, who came to Pomo country to farm or to mine gold in the mid-19th century. Non-Indians quickly outnumbers the Indians and wreaked havoc on their communities. A system of rancherias, or small reservations, was established by the US government for displaced Californian tribes, including the Sherwood Valley Rancheria.</p>
