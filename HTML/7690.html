<p><strong>Epping Forest</strong> is an area of ancient parkland in south-east <a href="England" class="uri" title="wikilink">England</a>, straddling the border between north-east <a href="Greater_London" title="wikilink">Greater London</a> and <a href="Essex" class="uri" title="wikilink">Essex</a>. It is a former <a href="royal_forest" title="wikilink">royal forest</a>, and is managed by the <a href="City_of_London_Corporation" title="wikilink">City of London Corporation</a>.</p>
<p>It covers <a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a><a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a>and contains areas of <a href="woodland" class="uri" title="wikilink">woodland</a>, <a href="grassland" class="uri" title="wikilink">grassland</a>, <a href="heath_(habitat)" title="wikilink">heath</a>, <a href="river" title="wikilink">rivers</a>, <a href="bog" title="wikilink">bogs</a> and <a href="pond" title="wikilink">ponds</a>. Stretching between <a href="Forest_Gate" title="wikilink">Forest Gate</a> in the south and <a href="Epping" class="uri" title="wikilink">Epping</a> in the north, Epping Forest is approximately  long in the north-south direction, but no more than  from east to west at its widest point, and in most places considerably narrower. The forest lies on a <a href="ridge" class="uri" title="wikilink">ridge</a> between the <a href="valley" title="wikilink">valleys</a> of the rivers <a href="River_Lea" title="wikilink">Lea</a> and <a href="River_Roding" title="wikilink">Roding</a>; its elevation and thin gravelly <a href="soil" class="uri" title="wikilink">soil</a> (the result of glaciation) historically made it unsuitable for <a href="agriculture" class="uri" title="wikilink">agriculture</a>. Embankments of two <a href="Iron_Age" title="wikilink">Iron Age</a> camps - <a href="Loughton_Camp" title="wikilink">Loughton Camp</a> and <a href="Ambresbury_Banks" title="wikilink">Ambresbury Banks</a> - can be found hidden in the woodland. It gives its name to the <a href="Epping_Forest_(district)" title="wikilink">Epping Forest local government district</a> which covers part of it.</p>
<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<p><img src="Hunting_Lodge_Chingford.JPG" title="fig: Queen Elizabeth&#39;s Hunting Lodge. Chingford" alt=" Queen Elizabeth&#39;s Hunting Lodge. Chingford" /> <img src="Connaught_Waters.JPG" title="fig:Connaught Waters, an eight acre ornamental lake named after the Duke of Connaught, the first forest ranger " alt="Connaught Waters, an eight acre ornamental lake named after the Duke of Connaught, the first forest ranger " /> The name &quot;Epping Forest&quot; was first recorded in the 17th century; prior to this it was known as Waltham Forest (which gives its name to the present-day <a href="London_Borough_of_Waltham_Forest" title="wikilink">London Borough of Waltham Forest</a>, which covers part of the modern forest). The forest is thought to have been given legal status as a <a href="royal_forest" title="wikilink">royal forest</a> by <a href="Henry_III_of_England" title="wikilink">Henry III</a> in the 12th century. This status allowed commoners to use the forest to gather wood and foodstuffs, and <a href="grazing_rights" title="wikilink">to graze livestock</a>, but only the king was allowed to hunt there. &quot;Forest&quot; in the historical sense of royal forest meant an area of land reserved for hunting, and did not imply that it was necessarily wooded.</p>
<p>In <a href="Tudor_dynasty" title="wikilink">Tudor</a> times <a href="Henry_VIII_of_England" title="wikilink">Henry VIII</a> and <a href="Queen_Elizabeth_I" title="wikilink">Queen Elizabeth I</a> hunted in the forest. In 1543 Henry commissioned a building, known as Great Standing, from which to view the chase at <a href="Chingford" class="uri" title="wikilink">Chingford</a>. The building was renovated in 1589 for Queen Elizabeth I and can still be seen today in Chingford. The building is now known as Queen Elizabeth's Hunting Lodge, and is open to the public as a museum.</p>
<p>There were disputes between landowners (who <a href="enclosure" title="wikilink">enclosed</a> land) and commoners (who had grazing and cutting rights). One group of commoners were led by <a href="Thomas_Willingale" title="wikilink">Thomas Willingale</a> (1799-1870) who on behalf of the villagers of <a href="Loughton" class="uri" title="wikilink">Loughton</a> continued to lop the trees after the Lord of the Manor (Maitland) had enclosed  of forest in Loughton. This led to an injunction against further enclosures.</p>
<p>The <a href="Epping_Forest_Act_1878" title="wikilink">Epping Forest Act 1878</a> was passed saving the forest from enclosure, and halting the shrinkage of the forest that this had caused. Epping Forest ceased to be a royal forest and was placed in the care of the <a href="City_of_London_Corporation" title="wikilink">City of London Corporation</a> who act as <em>Conservators</em>. In addition, the Crown's right to <a href="venison" class="uri" title="wikilink">venison</a> was terminated, and <a href="pollarding" class="uri" title="wikilink">pollarding</a> was no longer allowed, although grazing rights continued. This act laid down a stipulation that the Conservators &quot;shall at all times keep Epping Forest unenclosed and unbuilt on as an open space for the recreation and enjoyment of the people&quot;.</p>
<p>When <a href="Victoria_of_the_United_Kingdom" title="wikilink">Queen Victoria</a> visited Chingford on 6 May 1882 she declared &quot;It gives me the greatest satisfaction to dedicate this beautiful forest to the use and enjoyment of my people for all time&quot; and it thus became &quot;The People's Forest&quot;. The City of London Corporation still manage Epping Forest in strict conformity with the Epping Forest Act without any money for its upkeep coming from local rates or taxes. The Conservators administer the forest from the <a href="Grade_II*_listed" title="wikilink">Grade II* listed</a> Warren House in Loughton; the grounds of Warren House, which was built around a medieval hunting lodge, were laid out by <a href="Humphry_Repton" title="wikilink">Humphry Repton</a>.</p>
<p>Until the outbreak of <a href="Bovine_spongiform_encephalopathy" title="wikilink">BSE</a> in 1996 commoners still exercised their right to graze cattle and every summer herds of cattle would roam freely in the southern part of the forest (and occasionally in the streets of <a href="Leytonstone" class="uri" title="wikilink">Leytonstone</a>). Cattle were reintroduced in 2001 but their movements are now more restricted to reduce conflict with traffic.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>The right to collect wood still exists but is rarely practised and is limited to &quot;one <a href="Faggot_(wood)" title="wikilink">faggot</a> of dead or driftwood&quot; per day per adult resident.</p>
<h2 id="ecology">Ecology</h2>
<p><img src="Epping_Forest_pollard.jpg" title="fig:A formerly pollarded tree seen in Epping Forest." alt="A formerly pollarded tree seen in Epping Forest." /> <img src="Epping_Forest_2.JPG" title="fig:Epping Forest" alt="Epping Forest" /> The age of the forest and the range of habitats it contains make it a valuable area for wildlife, and it is designated as a <a href="Site_of_Special_Scientific_Interest" title="wikilink">Site of Special Scientific Interest</a>. Its former status as a working or pasture forest have had a great effect on its ecology. This is particularly evident with the <a href="Pollarding" title="wikilink">pollarded</a> trees, which, as they have not been cut since the passing of the Epping Forest Act, have now grown massive crowns of thick, trunk-like branches with correspondingly large <a href="bole" title="wikilink">boles</a>. This gives the trees an unusual appearance, not known in other forests. Often the weight of the branches cannot be supported by the parent tree, and the large amount of dead wood in the forest supports numerous rare species of <a href="fungi" class="uri" title="wikilink">fungi</a> and <a href="invertebrate" title="wikilink">invertebrates</a>.</p>
<p>Predominant tree species are <a href="Pedunculate_Oak" title="wikilink">Pedunculate Oak</a> (<em>Quercus robur</em>), <a href="European_Beech" title="wikilink">European Beech</a> (<em>Fagus sylvatica</em>), <a href="European_Hornbeam" title="wikilink">European Hornbeam</a> (<em>Carpinus betuloides</em>), <a href="Silver_Birch" title="wikilink">Silver Birch</a> (<em>Betula pendula</em>) and <a href="European_Holly" title="wikilink">European Holly</a> (<em>Ilex aquifolium</em>). A wide range of animals are found, including <a href="Fallow_Deer" title="wikilink">Fallow Deer</a> (<em>Dama dama</em>), <a href="Muntjac" class="uri" title="wikilink">Muntjac</a> (<em>Muntiacus reevesi</em>) and European adder (<em><a href="Vipera_berus" title="wikilink">Vipera berus</a></em>).</p>
<p>Although the Epping Forest Act almost certainly saved the forest from total destruction, it has to some extent had a deleterious effect on the area's <a href="biodiversity" class="uri" title="wikilink">biodiversity</a>. The pollarded trees allowed light through to the woodland floor, increasing the numbers of low-growing plants. Since the Act, the vast crowns of the pollards cut out most of the light to the underbrush. In addition, the area surrounding the forest is now to a great extent urbanised; the corresponding reduction in grazing has led to former areas of grassland and heathland being overcome by <a href="ecological_succession" title="wikilink">secondary woodland</a><a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> â€“ this has been exacerbated by the majority of the forest's <a href="deer" class="uri" title="wikilink">deer</a> being enclosed to prevent impacts with vehicles on the major roads that run through the forest. In recent years, the Conservators have experimented with pollarding in selected areas of the forest, and a herd of English <a href="Longhorn_cattle" title="wikilink">Longhorn cattle</a> has been reintroduced to graze the heathland and grassland.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>

The <a href="horror_fiction" title="wikilink">horror</a> writer <a href="James_Herbert" title="wikilink">James Herbert</a> used Epping Forest as the setting for his novel <em>Lair</em> (1979).

<p><a href="Horse_riding" title="wikilink">Horse riding</a> is popular in Epping Forest. Riders need to be registered with the Epping Forest conservators before they are allowed to ride in the forest.</p>
<h3 id="running">Running</h3>
<p><a href="Running" class="uri" title="wikilink">Running</a> as a form of recreation in Epping Forest goes back almost to the birth of the sport in the 1870s, including hosting the inaugural English Championships in 1876.</p>
<h3 id="motorcycle-speedway">Motorcycle speedway</h3>
<p>High Beach within Epping Forest was the first British venue for <a href="motorcycle_speedway" title="wikilink">motorcycle speedway</a>, on 19 February 1928. The track was behind The King's Oak public house, and drew large crowds in its early days. The track was closed when a swimming pool was added to the pub's grounds after the Second World War, though enthusiasts and veterans still gather at the site every year on the nearest Sunday to 19 February. The remains of the track are still visible, in the grounds of the Epping Forest Field Centre behind the King's Oak.</p>
<h3 id="mountain-biking">Mountain biking</h3>
<p>Epping Forest attracts large numbers of <a href="mountain_biking" title="wikilink">mountain bikers</a>. Mountain biking is generally permitted except around the Iron Age camps, Loughton Brook and other ecologically or geomorphologically sensitive areas. Despite clear signposting, a minority of mountain bikers continue to cause damage in these areas, <a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> and the Conservators of Epping Forest have expressed their concern; horses can cause similar damage but horse-riders must contribute through a licensing scheme to general forest maintenance.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a>. A number of clubs organise rides, particularly on Sunday mornings. The forest is also used as a training area for many national level mountain-bike racers as it is highly regarded for its fast and tight flowing single track trails. This type of terrain is known within the mountain bike fraternity as cross country.</p>
<p>Epping Forest was considered as a venue for the mountain-biking event of the 2012 Summer Olympics, though the final choice was near <a href="Hadleigh_Castle" title="wikilink">Hadleigh Castle</a>.</p>

<p><a href="Orienteering" class="uri" title="wikilink">Orienteering</a> and <a href="rambling" class="uri" title="wikilink">rambling</a> are also popular. There are numerous guidebooks offering shorter walks for the casual visitor.
