<p><strong>Super Bowl XLI</strong> was an <a href="American_football" title="wikilink">American football</a> game that featured the <a href="American_Football_Conference" title="wikilink">American Football Conference</a> (AFC) champion <a href="Indianapolis_Colts" title="wikilink">Indianapolis Colts</a> and the <a href="National_Football_Conference" title="wikilink">National Football Conference</a> (NFC) champion <a href="Chicago_Bears" title="wikilink">Chicago Bears</a> to decide the <a href="National_Football_League" title="wikilink">National Football League</a> (NFL) champion for the <a href="2006_NFL_season" title="wikilink">2006 season</a>. The Colts defeated the Bears, 29&lt;U+2013&gt;17, overcoming a 14&lt;U+2013&gt;6 first quarter deficit to outscore their opponent 23&lt;U+2013&gt;3 in the last three quarters.</p>
<p>This game, played on February 4, 2007, at <a href="Dolphin_Stadium" title="wikilink">Dolphin Stadium</a> in <a href="Miami_Gardens,_Florida" title="wikilink">Miami Gardens, Florida</a>, featured two teams ending long <a href="Super_Bowl" title="wikilink">Super Bowl</a> appearance droughts. The Colts made their first appearance in a Super Bowl game since winning <a href="Super_Bowl_V" title="wikilink">Super Bowl V</a> in the <a href="1970_NFL_season" title="wikilink">1970 NFL season</a> during the team's tenure in <a href="Baltimore,_Maryland" title="wikilink">Baltimore</a>; they moved to <a href="Indianapolis,_Indiana" title="wikilink">Indianapolis</a> in <a href="1984_NFL_season" title="wikilink">1984</a>. Meanwhile, the Bears made their first appearance since winning <a href="Super_Bowl_XX" title="wikilink">Super Bowl XX</a> in the <a href="1985_Chicago_Bears_season" title="wikilink">1985 season</a>. It was only the second time that two pre-expansion era (pre 1960) teams met in the Super Bowl. The first was <a href="Super_Bowl_XIV" title="wikilink">Super Bowl XIV</a> between the <a href="Pittsburgh_Steelers" title="wikilink">Pittsburgh Steelers</a> and the <a href="Los_Angeles_Rams" title="wikilink">Los Angeles Rams</a>. Also, if one counts the histories of <a href="Indianapolis_Colts#Franchise_history" title="wikilink">several other franchises</a> as part of that of the Colts, this game would be the first Super Bowl between two NFL charter members from 1920, as the Colts' earliest ancestor, the <a href="Dayton_Triangles" title="wikilink">Dayton Triangles</a>, were part of the league's inaugural season along with the team that became the Chicago Bears, the Decatur Staleys (the only other possible Super Bowl match-up under this criterion would be between the Colts and the <a href="Arizona_Cardinals" title="wikilink">Arizona Cardinals</a>, the Bears' former crosstown rivals).</p>
<p>Colts quarterback <a href="Peyton_Manning" title="wikilink">Peyton Manning</a> was named the game's <a href="Super_Bowl_Most_Valuable_Player_Award" title="wikilink">Most Valuable Player</a>, completing 25 of 38 passes for 247 yards and a <a href="touchdown" class="uri" title="wikilink">touchdown</a>, with one <a href="interception" class="uri" title="wikilink">interception</a> for a passer rating of 81.8. This was Manning's first <a href="Super_Bowl" title="wikilink">Super Bowl</a> title after being one of the league's most dominant <a href="quarterback" title="wikilink">quarterbacks</a> throughout his nine-year career. It was also the first time two <a href="African-American" class="uri" title="wikilink">African-American</a> head coaches (<a href="Lovie_Smith" title="wikilink">Lovie Smith</a> and <a href="Tony_Dungy" title="wikilink">Tony Dungy</a>) were coaching in the Super Bowl, with Tony Dungy being the first to win. The tagline for the game was, &quot;One Game. One Dream.&quot;</p>

<p>This was the fourth Super Bowl at Dolphin Stadium, which has also been known as &quot;Joe Robbie Stadium&quot; and &quot;Pro Player Stadium&quot;. The venue previously hosted Super Bowls <a href="Super_Bowl_XXIII" title="wikilink">XXIII</a> (broadcast on <a href="NBC" class="uri" title="wikilink">NBC</a>), <a href="Super_Bowl_XXIX" title="wikilink">XXIX</a> (on <a href="American_Broadcasting_Company" title="wikilink">ABC</a>), and <a href="Super_Bowl_XXXIII" title="wikilink">XXXIII</a> (on <a href="Fox_Broadcasting_Company" title="wikilink">FOX</a>).

<p>Chicago finished the season with an NFC best 13&lt;U+2013&gt;3 record and advanced to the second Super Bowl in franchise history. The team excelled on defense, ranking third in fewest points allowed (255) and second in fewest points allowed per drive.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> They also ranked second in scoring (427 points), although only tenth in points per offensive drive<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> thanks to a league leading 65 points scored on defensive or special teams plays.</p>
<p>The Bears offense was led by quarterback <a href="Rex_Grossman" title="wikilink">Rex Grossman</a>, the team's first round draft pick in 2003. Over the previous three seasons, Grossman had played in just 8 regular season games due to injuries, but he recovered to start in all 16 games in 2006. By the end of the season, he finished with 3,193 yards and 23 touchdowns, the most by a Bears quarterback since 1995. Grossman had difficulty avoiding <a href="Turnover_(football)" title="wikilink">turnovers</a>, however, and threw 20 interceptions and lost five fumbles during the year. In the last seven games of the season, he turned the ball over 18 times. Many fans and sports writers expected head coach <a href="Lovie_Smith" title="wikilink">Lovie Smith</a> to bench him at some point, but Smith insisted that Grossman would be the starter throughout the entire season.</p>
<p>Receivers <a href="Muhsin_Muhammad" title="wikilink">Muhsin Muhammad</a> (60 receptions, 863 yards, 5 touchdowns) and <a href="Bernard_Berrian" title="wikilink">Bernard Berrian</a> (51 receptions, 775 yards, 7 touchdowns) provided the main deep threat on the team, along with tight end <a href="Desmond_Clark" title="wikilink">Desmond Clark</a>, who caught 45 passes for 626 yards and 6 touchdowns. Chicago's running game was led by running backs <a href="Thomas_Jones_(American_football)" title="wikilink">Thomas Jones</a> and <a href="Cedric_Benson" title="wikilink">Cedric Benson</a>. Jones rushed for 1,210 yards and caught 36 passes, while Benson rushed for 647 yards and scored 6 touchdowns.</p>
<p>Chicago's defense allowed the 5th least total yardage, allowed less than 100 yards per game on the ground,<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> and allowed the fewest yards per drive of any NFL team.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> The line was anchored by <a href="Adewale_Ogunleye" title="wikilink">Adewale Ogunleye</a>, who had 6.5 sacks, and Pro Bowler <a href="Tommie_Harris" title="wikilink">Tommie Harris</a>, who recorded 5, along with rookie <a href="Mark_Anderson_(American_football)" title="wikilink">Mark Anderson</a>, who led the team with 12 sacks. Behind them, two of the three Bears starting linebackers, <a href="Lance_Briggs" title="wikilink">Lance Briggs</a>, and <a href="Brian_Urlacher" title="wikilink">Brian Urlacher</a>, were selected to the <a href="2007_Pro_Bowl" title="wikilink">2007 Pro Bowl</a>. In the secondary, cornerbacks <a href="Ricky_Manning,_Jr." title="wikilink">Ricky Manning, Jr.</a> and <a href="Charles_Tillman" title="wikilink">Charles Tillman</a> each recorded five interceptions.</p>
<p>The loss of Harris to injury after the twelfth game of the season coincided with a decline in defensive performance. Before his loss, the Bears allowed only two opponents to score more than twenty points (23 points to the <a href="Arizona_Cardinals" title="wikilink">Arizona Cardinals</a> in week six and 31 to the <a href="Miami_Dolphins" title="wikilink">Miami Dolphins</a> in week 9).<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> After his injury, Chicago opponents scored more than 20 points in six of the seven remaining games, including two of three playoff games. Only the <a href="New_Orleans_Saints" title="wikilink">New Orleans Saints</a> in the <a href="NFC_Championship_game" title="wikilink">NFC Championship game</a> were held below 21 points.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<p>The Bears special teams unit was considered to be the best in the league . This unit sent 3 players to the Pro Bowl, including special teams ace <a href="Brendon_Ayanbadejo" title="wikilink">Brendon Ayanbadejo</a>, kicker <a href="Robbie_Gould" title="wikilink">Robbie Gould</a> (who led all NFL kickers with 143 points), and rookie return man <a href="Devin_Hester" title="wikilink">Devin Hester</a>, who gained 600 punt return yards with a 12.8 yards per return average, the second highest in the NFL. He also set a league record with 6 touchdowns on special teams.</p>
<h4 id="indianapolis-colts">Indianapolis Colts</h4>

<p>The Colts' first trip to the Super Bowl in 36 years set a record for longest time between appearances by a team. Their return was the culmination of a nine-year-long building process. In 1998, they drafted quarterback <a href="Peyton_Manning" title="wikilink">Peyton Manning</a> to lead the team. Over the next four seasons, Manning, along with other stars such as receiver <a href="Marvin_Harrison" title="wikilink">Marvin Harrison</a> and running back <a href="Edgerrin_James" title="wikilink">Edgerrin James</a>, turned the Colts into one of the best offensive teams in the NFL, but the team struggled to find consistency on defense and always ended up with either a losing season or elimination from the playoffs in the first round. In 2002, Indianapolis fired head coach <a href="Jim_E._Mora" title="wikilink">Jim Mora</a> and replaced him with <a href="Tony_Dungy" title="wikilink">Tony Dungy</a>. Dungy had developed one of the best defenses in the NFL while coaching the <a href="Tampa_Bay_Buccaneers" title="wikilink">Tampa Bay Buccaneers</a>, and it was hoped he could solve the Colts' defensive problems as well.</p>
<p>Over the next four seasons, the Colts won 48 of 64 games, but still could not find much success in the postseason. In 2002, they were blown out 41&lt;U+2013&gt;0 in the wild card round by the <a href="New_York_Jets" title="wikilink">New York Jets</a>. In 2003, they won their first two playoff games behind impressive offensive performances, and reached the AFC title game. There, they lost to the eventual champion <a href="New_England_Patriots" title="wikilink">New England Patriots</a> 24&lt;U+2013&gt;14, with Manning throwing four interceptions. In 2004, the Colts had one of the most spectacular offensive seasons in NFL history, scoring 522 points and gaining 6,582 yards, while Manning set NFL records for most touchdown passes and highest passer rating. But again the Patriots' defense (and snowy conditions) proved too formidable, as they lost 20&lt;U+2013&gt;3 in the divisional round of the playoffs.</p>
<p>In 2005, the Colts' defense improved, making the team the clear favorites in the NFL. They won the first 13 games of the season and finished with a 14&lt;U+2013&gt;2 record, while ranking second in the NFL in both points scored and fewest points allowed. But once again they lost in the divisional round of the playoffs, this time to the #6 seeded <a href="Pittsburgh_Steelers" title="wikilink">Pittsburgh Steelers</a>, 21&lt;U+2013&gt;18. After another disappointing loss, Manning had developed a reputation of being unable to make it to a championship, a reputation that followed him from college after he was unable to win an NCAA title with the <a href="Tennessee_Volunteers" title="wikilink">Tennessee Volunteers</a> (who won a title the year after he graduated). The Colts lost some key players after the 2005 season, including James, who departed the Colts for the Arizona Cardinals, and kicker <a href="Mike_Vanderjagt" title="wikilink">Mike Vanderjagt</a>, the NFL's all-time leader in field goal percentage, who left for the Dallas Cowboys.</p>
<p>Still, the Colts remained one of the AFC's top teams in the <a href="2006_NFL_season" title="wikilink">2006 NFL season</a>. Manning made the Pro Bowl for the 7th time in his career, completing 362 of 555 passes for 4,397 yards and an NFL-best 31 touchdowns, with an additional 4 rushing touchdowns and with only 9 interceptions and 15 sacks. His favorite target was Harrison, who caught 95 passes for 1,366 yards and 12 touchdowns. Receiver <a href="Reggie_Wayne" title="wikilink">Reggie Wayne</a> was also a major deep threat with 86 receptions for 1,310 yards and 9 touchdowns. Tight ends <a href="Ben_Utecht" title="wikilink">Ben Utecht</a> and <a href="Dallas_Clark" title="wikilink">Dallas Clark</a> were also reliable targets, each recording over 30 receptions for over 300 yards. On the ground, rookie running back <a href="Joseph_Addai" title="wikilink">Joseph Addai</a> led the team with 1,081 yards and a 4.8 yards-per-carry average despite not starting any games in the regular season. He also caught 40 receptions for 325 yards and scored 8 touchdowns. Running back <a href="Dominic_Rhodes" title="wikilink">Dominic Rhodes</a> was also a major contributor, rushing for 641 yards and catching 36 passes for 251 yards. The offensive line was led by Pro Bowlers <a href="Jeff_Saturday" title="wikilink">Jeff Saturday</a> and <a href="Tarik_Glenn" title="wikilink">Tarik Glenn</a>. On special teams, the Colts signed kicker <a href="Adam_Vinatieri" title="wikilink">Adam Vinatieri</a> to replace Vanderjagt. While Vinatieri's career field goal percentage was lower, the Colts considered him to be an improvement because of his reputation for making &quot;<a href="clutch_(sports)" title="wikilink">clutch</a>&quot; kicks, a reputation aided by his game winning field goals in <a href="Super_Bowl_XXXVI" title="wikilink">Super Bowl XXXVI</a> and <a href="Super_Bowl_XXXVIII" title="wikilink">Super Bowl XXXVIII</a>.</p>
<p>Indianapolis' defense ranked second in the NFL in fewest passing yards allowed. <a href="Dwight_Freeney" title="wikilink">Dwight Freeney</a> and <a href="Robert_Mathis" title="wikilink">Robert Mathis</a> (who recorded 9.5 sacks and forced 4 fumbles) were widely considered to be among the best pass-rushing <a href="defensive_end" title="wikilink">defensive ends</a> in the NFL. Behind them, linebacker <a href="Cato_June" title="wikilink">Cato June</a> led the team in tackles (92) and interceptions (3). The Colts' run defense, however, was a major problem, giving up 2,768 yards on the ground, an average of 173 per game and last in the NFL. Another major issue for the Colts was their coverage teams, as they ranked 30th out of 32 teams in average kickoff return yardage allowed and 31st in average punt return yardage allowed.</p>
<p>Indianapolis started out the season winning their first nine games, but ended up losing four of their next seven and finished with a 12&lt;U+2013&gt;4 record, giving them the #3 playoff seed. Thus, they would have to win three games to make it to the Super Bowl.</p>

<h3 id="playoffs">Playoffs</h3>

<p>Although the Colts' rushing defense looked extremely weak during the season, it ended up being a key factor on their road to the Super Bowl. First, Indianapolis defeated the <a href="Kansas_City_Chiefs" title="wikilink">Kansas City Chiefs</a> 23&lt;U+2013&gt;8, holding Chiefs running back <a href="Larry_Johnson_(American_football)" title="wikilink">Larry Johnson</a> (who rushed for 1,789 yards during the season) to just 32 yards on 13 carries. Then, they defeated the <a href="Baltimore_Ravens" title="wikilink">Baltimore Ravens</a> 15&lt;U+2013&gt;6, winning on a playoff record-tying five field goals by Vinatieri and holding running back <a href="Jamal_Lewis" title="wikilink">Jamal Lewis</a> (who rushed for 1,132 yards during the season) to just 53 yards.</p>
<p>Then the Colts faced their arch-rival <a href="New_England_Patriots" title="wikilink">New England Patriots</a> in the AFC title game. New England jumped to an early 21&lt;U+2013&gt;3 lead, but Indianapolis stormed back in the second half, outscoring the Patriots 32&lt;U+2013&gt;13 with an additional field goal late in the first half. The Colts' final scoring drive did much to help <a href="Peyton_Manning" title="wikilink">Manning</a> lose his image of always choking in big games. With 2:22 left in the game, the Colts had the ball on their own 20-yard line trailing 34&lt;U+2013&gt;31. On the first four plays of the drive, Manning completed three passes, moving the ball 69 yards to the Patriots 11-yard line in just 24 seconds. Three plays later, Addai scored a 3-yard touchdown run to put them in the lead, 38&lt;U+2013&gt;34 with only 60 seconds left in regulation. The Patriots responded with a drive to the Colts 45-yard line, but defensive back <a href="Marlin_Jackson" title="wikilink">Marlin Jackson</a> ended the drive with an interception to give Indianapolis the win. This happened to be the biggest comeback in AFC-NFC Conference Championship history.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Bears started out their post-season with a 27&lt;U+2013&gt;24 win over the <a href="Seattle_Seahawks" title="wikilink">Seattle Seahawks</a> with <a href="Robbie_Gould" title="wikilink">Robbie Gould</a>'s 49-yard field goal in overtime. One week later, they defeated the <a href="New_Orleans_Saints" title="wikilink">New Orleans Saints</a> 39&lt;U+2013&gt;14. Chicago dominated most of the game, jumping to a 16&lt;U+2013&gt;0 early lead. Two touchdown passes from Saints quarterback <a href="Drew_Brees" title="wikilink">Drew Brees</a>, cut the score to 16&lt;U+2013&gt;14, but the Bears responded with 23 unanswered points to propel them to their first Super Bowl since 1985. Thomas Jones finished the game with a franchise postseason record 123 rushing yards and two touchdowns.</p>
<p>It was the first time since the 1996 postseason that the home team won both of the conference championship games. The Colts were the first dome team to win the Super Bowl in an outdoor game. (The <a href="St._Louis_Rams" title="wikilink">St. Louis Rams</a> were the first dome team to win a Super Bowl (<a href="Super_Bowl_XXXIV" title="wikilink">XXXIV</a>)). The <a href="2006_NFL_season" title="wikilink">2006</a> Indianapolis Colts were the first division champion to win a Super Bowl with four postseason wins and the second division champion (<a href="2003_NFL_season" title="wikilink">2003</a> <a href="Carolina_Panthers" title="wikilink">Carolina Panthers</a>) to win a conference title with three postseason wins.</p>
<p>For the Bears, this marked the first time that a Chicago sports team not owned by <a href="Jerry_Reinsdorf" title="wikilink">Jerry Reinsdorf</a> had reached the finals in their league since the <a href="Chicago_Blackhawks" title="wikilink">Blackhawks</a> lost in the <a href="1992_Stanley_Cup_Finals" title="wikilink">1992 Stanley Cup Finals</a>.</p>

<p>The Bears won the coin toss and elected to receive. For the first time in Super Bowl history, the game was played in the rain, which was continuous throughout the game.</p>
<p>The rain did not hinder Bears' return man <a href="Devin_Hester" title="wikilink">Devin Hester</a>, who ran back the opening kickoff 92 yards for a touchdown to give Chicago the earliest lead in Super Bowl history.

After several short runs and passes, Manning beat the Bears' defense with a 53-yard touchdown pass to <a href="Reggie_Wayne" title="wikilink">Reggie Wayne</a>, cutting the Bears' lead to 7&lt;U+2013&gt;6. The touchdown occurred because of a mental error on the Bears' secondary. Cornerback Charles Tillman passed Reggie Wayne onto Safety Daniel Manning. But Manning chose to follow Tight End Ben Utecht over the middle, leaving Wayne all alone. The score remained the same, at 7&lt;U+2013&gt;6, after punter/holder <a href="Hunter_Smith" title="wikilink">Hunter Smith</a> fumbled the snap on the extra point attempt.

<p>On the first play after the turnover, <a href="Thomas_Jones_(American_football)" title="wikilink">Thomas Jones</a>' 52-yard run moved the ball to the Colts' 5-yard line. Three plays later, <a href="Rex_Grossman" title="wikilink">Rex Grossman</a> threw a 4-yard touchdown pass to receiver <a href="Muhsin_Muhammad" title="wikilink">Muhsin Muhammad</a>, giving the Bears a 14&lt;U+2013&gt;6 lead. After forcing an Indianapolis punt, Chicago lost another turnover when <a href="Cedric_Benson" title="wikilink">Cedric Benson</a>'s fumble was recovered by Colts defensive end <a href="Dwight_Freeney" title="wikilink">Dwight Freeney</a> on the Bears' 43-yard line. Indianapolis subsequently advanced to the 36-yard line, but decided to punt rather than risk a 53-yard field-goal attempt.</p>
<p>Following a Chicago punt, Indianapolis drove 47 yards and scored with Vinatieri's 29-yard field goal to make the score 14&lt;U+2013&gt;9. Chicago was forced to punt again on their next drive, and return man <a href="Terrence_Wilkins" title="wikilink">Terrence Wilkins</a> returned the ball 12 yards to his own 42-yard line. Manning started out the drive with a 22-yard completion to <a href="Marvin_Harrison" title="wikilink">Marvin Harrison</a>. His next pass went to tight end <a href="Dallas_Clark" title="wikilink">Dallas Clark</a> for 17 yards. Two more completions moved the ball to the Bears' 11-yard line, and then <a href="Dominic_Rhodes" title="wikilink">Dominic Rhodes</a> took the ball to the end zone with three consecutive carries, the last one a 1-yard touchdown run to give his team a 16&lt;U+2013&gt;14 lead with 6:09 left in the second quarter.</p>
<p>After another Chicago punt, the Colts advanced to the Bears' 36-yard line before defensive back <a href="Charles_Tillman" title="wikilink">Charles Tillman</a> ended the drive by forcing and recovering a fumble from tight end <a href="Bryan_Fletcher_(American_football)" title="wikilink">Bryan Fletcher</a>. But on the next play, Grossman fumbled a snap, and Colts defensive lineman <a href="Raheem_Brock" title="wikilink">Raheem Brock</a> recovered the ball. Manning then led the Colts to Chicago's 17-yard line. With two seconds left, Vinatieri attempted a 36-yard field goal, but his kick sailed wide left, and the score remained 16&lt;U+2013&gt;14 at halftime.</p>
<h3 id="second-half">Second half</h3>
<p>Wilkins returned the second half kickoff 26 yards to the Colts's 38-yard line. On the ensuing possession, Addai rushed five times for 25 yards and caught four passes for 19 yards as the Colts drove 56 yards in 13 plays and scored with a 29-yard field goal from Vinatieri, increasing their lead to 19&lt;U+2013&gt;14. On the Bears' next drive, Jones started out with a 14-yard run, and then Muhammad caught a 9-yard pass, bringing up second down and one on the Colts' 45-yard line. But on the next play, Grossman was sacked for an 11-yard loss by <a href="Anthony_McFarland" title="wikilink">Anthony McFarland</a>. Then, on third down, he fumbled the snap. Grossman recovered the fumble himself, but the Bears were forced to punt, and Wilkins returned the ball 12 yards to the Colts' 36-yard line. Rhodes then gained 52 yards on four carries, with a facemask penalty adding another 10. Chicago managed to halt the drive at their own 2-yard line, but Vinatieri kicked his third field goal to make the score 22&lt;U+2013&gt;14.</p>
<p>Chicago tight end <a href="John_Gilmore_(football_player)" title="wikilink">John Gilmore</a> picked up Vinatieri's bouncing kickoff and returned it 9-yards to his own 45-yard line, with an Unnecessary Roughness penalty on Mathis adding another 15 yards and giving the Bears a first down on the Colts' 40-yard line. Chicago could only gain 14 yards on their ensuing possession, but it was enough for <a href="Robbie_Gould" title="wikilink">Robbie Gould</a> to make a 44-yard field goal, cutting the score to 22&lt;U+2013&gt;17. After an Indianapolis 7-play drive ended in a punt, Chicago started on their own 20-yard line with 13:38 left in the game. But four plays later, Colts defensive back <a href="Kelvin_Hayden" title="wikilink">Kelvin Hayden</a> intercepted a pass intended for Muhammad and returned it 56 yards for a touchdown.</p>
<p>From that point on, the Colts took over the game. Four plays after the ensuing kickoff, Colts defensive back <a href="Bob_Sanders" title="wikilink">Bob Sanders</a> intercepted Grossman's pass and returned it 38 yards to the Bears 41-yard line. Chicago's defense eventually forced a punt, but Smith's 32-yard kick pinned the Bears back at their own 8-yard line. The Bears drove to their own 47, but on a fourth down conversion attempt, tight end <a href="Desmond_Clark" title="wikilink">Desmond Clark</a> dropped a potential first down reception after being leveled by defensive back <a href="Matt_Giordano" title="wikilink">Matt Giordano</a>. The Colts subsequently called eight consecutive <a href="Dominic_Rhodes" title="wikilink">Dominic Rhodes</a> runs before turning the ball over on downs themselves, leaving only 1:42 remaining in regulation. Five plays later, the game was over.</p>

<p>This was the third Super Bowl to have two players rush for more than 100 yards as <a href="Dominic_Rhodes" title="wikilink">Dominic Rhodes</a> had 113 for the Colts and <a href="Thomas_Jones_(American_football)" title="wikilink">Thomas Jones</a> had 112 for the Bears. Tony Dungy is the third man to win the Super Bowl as a head coach as well as a player, following <a href="Tom_Flores" title="wikilink">Tom Flores</a> and <a href="Mike_Ditka" title="wikilink">Mike Ditka</a>.</p>
<p>For the Colts, Rhodes rushed for 113 yards and a touchdown, while also catching an 8-yard reception. Addai rushed for 77 yards and caught 10 passes (a Super Bowl record for running backs)<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> for 66 yards. Wilkins returned four kickoffs for 89 yards and 3 punts for 42 yards. Adam Vinatieri became the first kicker ever to play in five Super Bowls and the first to win four <a href="Super_Bowl_ring" title="wikilink">Super Bowl rings</a>. Vinatieri's three field goals and two extra points gave him a total of 49 points for the entire 2006 post-season, an NFL record. The Colts' win was the first major professional championship for <a href="Indiana" class="uri" title="wikilink">Indiana</a> since the <a href="Indiana_Pacers" title="wikilink">Indiana Pacers</a>' <a href="American_Basketball_Association" title="wikilink">ABA</a> title in the 1972&lt;U+2013&gt;73 season.</p>
<p>Hester's touchdown for the Bears on the opening kickoff was the first one in Super Bowl history, and the eighth kick return for a touchdown in a Super Bowl; only two of the eight teams who did this went on to win the game (the <a href="Green_Bay_Packers" title="wikilink">Green Bay Packers</a> in <a href="Super_Bowl_XXXI" title="wikilink">Super Bowl XXXI</a> and the <a href="Baltimore_Ravens" title="wikilink">Baltimore Ravens</a> in <a href="Super_Bowl_XXXV" title="wikilink">Super Bowl XXXV</a>). Hester's return also kept a streak alive for there being a kickoff return for a touchdown in each Super Bowl played at Dolphin Stadium. Hester's and Wayne's touchdowns in the first quarter marked the first time in Super Bowl history, the first two touchdowns were scored by players from the same college (<a href="University_of_Miami" title="wikilink">University of Miami</a>). Jones was the Bears' top rusher with 112 yards, while also catching four passes for 18 yards. Desmond Clark was the Bears top receiver with six receptions for 64 yards. Grossman completed 20 of 28 passes for 165 yards and a touchdown, with two interceptions, leaving him with a QB rating of 68.3 for the game.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> <a href="Muhsin_Muhammad" title="wikilink">Muhsin Muhammad</a> became the third player ever to score a touchdown in the Super Bowl for two different teams, joining <a href="Ricky_Proehl" title="wikilink">Ricky Proehl</a> and <a href="Jerry_Rice" title="wikilink">Jerry Rice</a>.</p>

<h2 id="commercials">Commercials</h2>
<p>Advertising rates were reported as being slightly higher than in the year before, with CBS confirming a price of $2.6 million for some 30-second spots, compared with $2.5 million during <a href="Super_Bowl_XL" title="wikilink">Super Bowl XL</a>. However, CNN reported that after discounts, the average price is likely closer to $1.8 to $2 million. Familiar advertisers in recent years such as <a href="Anheuser-Busch" class="uri" title="wikilink">Anheuser-Busch</a>, <a href="CareerBuilder" class="uri" title="wikilink">CareerBuilder</a>, <a href="General_Motors" title="wikilink">General Motors</a> and <a href="Coca-Cola" class="uri" title="wikilink">Coca-Cola</a> bought multiple advertising spots, and other popular advertisers like <a href="Go_Daddy" title="wikilink">Go Daddy</a> and <a href="Diamond_Foods,_Inc." title="wikilink">Emerald Nuts</a> had commercials this year.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a></p>
<p>The only major hype related to commercials in the months leading up to Super Bowl XLI involved various campaigns to allow consumers to be involved in the creation of Super Bowl ads, inspired by consumer-generated content sites like <a href="YouTube" class="uri" title="wikilink">YouTube</a>. <a href="Frito-Lay" class="uri" title="wikilink">Frito-Lay</a> announced a campaign in September 2006 to allow the public to submit ads for their <a href="Doritos" class="uri" title="wikilink">Doritos</a> brand and vote on the best one, which aired during the Super Bowl. Doritos actually aired two of the ads due to a close voting margin; the winning ad (featuring a chance meeting with a man and a woman that feature the qualities of Doritos) aired in the first quarter, while a second (with a checkout lady overly enamored with the product) aired in the second quarter. The five finalists each received $10,000 in this contest. General Motors announced a similar contest, open only to college students, for their <a href="Chevrolet" class="uri" title="wikilink">Chevrolet</a> brand; however, the ad would be produced professionally based on ideas suggested by the public. The winning ad featured men gathering around an HHR model with women in it and stripping off their clothes and giving it a car wash. The NFL itself advertised a similar contest to generate suggestions for a commercial promoting the league, with the winning concept featuring fans' disappointment that their teams' season was over.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a></p>
<p>The annual <a href="USA_Today_Super_Bowl_Ad_Meter" title="wikilink">USA Today Super Bowl Ad Meter</a> survey chose a <a href="Budweiser_(Anheuser-Busch)" title="wikilink">Budweiser</a> ad featuring crabs worshiping an ice chest with that particular beer inside as the top ad of Super Bowl XLI, followed by another Bud commercial featuring a stray dog with mud spots climbing onto the brewery's trademark Clydsedale-drawn wagon in a parade. In all, Anheuser-Busch took seven of the top ten spots in the annual survey, sweeping the top three spots. A YouTube user survey chose the Doritos &quot;Snack Hard&quot; ad (produced for the incredible price of $12, the cost of three bags of the snack product)<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> as their top ad, that ad finished fourth in the USA Today survey. <a href="ADBOWL" class="uri" title="wikilink">ADBOWL</a> results were slightly different with only 6 of Anheuser-Busch&lt;U+2019&gt;s ads finishing in the top ten. The highest ranked being the <a href="Bud_Light" title="wikilink">Bud Light</a> &lt;U+201C&gt;Rock, Paper, Scissors&lt;U+201D&gt; spot. Also in the top ten were <a href="Blockbuster_Video" title="wikilink">Blockbuster Video</a>&lt;U+2019&gt;s &lt;U+201C&gt;Mouse,&lt;U+201D&gt; Doritos&lt;U+2019&gt; &lt;U+201C&gt;Car Wreck,&lt;U+201D&gt; GM&lt;U+2019&gt;s &lt;U+201C&gt;Robot&lt;U+201D&gt; and <a href="Taco_Bell" title="wikilink">Taco Bell</a>&lt;U+2019&gt;s &lt;U+201C&gt;Lion&lt;U+2019&gt;s Talk &lt;U+2018&gt;Carne&lt;U+2019&gt;.&lt;U+201D&gt;</p>
<p>One ad that drew criticism from the gay community was for the <a href="Snickers" class="uri" title="wikilink">Snickers</a> candy bar featuring two men accidentally &quot;kissing&quot; each other after sharing the product in question, then proceeded to rip chest hairs as a manly act as <a href="homophobic" class="uri" title="wikilink">homophobic</a>.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> The ad proved to be controversial, and the ad was cancelled the next day by Masterfoods USA (<a href="Mars,_Incorporated" title="wikilink">Mars, Incorporated</a>'s snack food division), and three other versions were deleted from the snickers.com web site. The ad was ninth in the USA Today ad survey, and according to a Masterfoods publicist, not intended to harm anyone.</p>
<p>A different ad for <a href="General_Motors" title="wikilink">General Motors</a> featured a <a href="layoff" title="wikilink">laid off</a> <a href="assembly_line" title="wikilink">assembly line</a> <a href="robot" class="uri" title="wikilink">robot</a> contemplating <a href="suicide" class="uri" title="wikilink">suicide</a>, which drew criticism from the <a href="American_Foundation_for_Suicide_Prevention" title="wikilink">American Foundation for Suicide Prevention</a>. The group asked for an apology from GM, and that the ad be taken off the air and the company's website.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> The suicide scene was replaced with a scene of the robot watching a car being crushed at a junkyard when it was shown again during the <a href="79th_Academy_Awards" title="wikilink">79th Academy Awards</a> on February 25.</p>
<h2 id="controversies-prohibiting-fan-parties-and-presentations">Controversies prohibiting fan parties and presentations</h2>
<h3 id="prohibiting-tailgating">Prohibiting tailgating</h3>
<p>The NFL upset many fans by banning the traditional practice of <a href="tailgate_party" title="wikilink">tailgating</a> at Super Bowl XLI. Originally, spokesmen for Dolphin Stadium announced that tailgating would be permitted as usual, however the NFL quickly contradicted this statement announcing an NFL owner-imposed ban on all tailgating and non-ticketed fans were forbidden within a two-block-radius of the stadium.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="prohibiting-church-display">Prohibiting church display</h3>
<p>The NFL upset a large number of fans by threatening churches with lawsuits if they had Super Bowl parties. National Football League assistant <a href="Lawyer" title="wikilink">counsel</a> Rachel L. Margolies sent a letter to the <a href="Fall_Creek_Place,_Indianapolis" title="wikilink">Fall Creek</a> <a href="Baptists" title="wikilink">Baptist Church</a> in <a href="Indianapolis,_Indiana" title="wikilink">Indianapolis</a>, ordering the church to cancel its party and remove the trademarked Super Bowl name from its website.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> She said that the church could not use the words &quot;Super Bowl&quot; as it violates trademark law, could not charge admission as that violates <a href="copyright" class="uri" title="wikilink">copyright</a> law, could not use its projection screen (only one television could be used and it could not be over 55 inches), and could not &quot;promote a message&quot; in connection with the game. Regarding the last point, the Fall Creek Baptist church planned to also show an extra video to highlight the <a href="Christian" class="uri" title="wikilink">Christian</a> testimonies of Colts coach Tony Dungy and Chicago Bears coach Lovie Smith. &quot;While this may be a noble message,&quot; Rachel L. Margolies wrote, &quot;we are consistent in refusing the use of our game broadcasts in connection with events that promote a message, no matter the content.&quot;<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> <a href="Sports_bar" title="wikilink">Sports bars</a> nationwide were allowed to show the game, as are businesses that televise sports as part of their everyday operations because they don't charge admission and they leave the message the NFL intended intact.</p>
<p><a href="The_Indianapolis_Star" title="wikilink">The Indianapolis Star</a> picked up the story, and soon pastors across the U.S. were working to cancel their parties. Immediately the NFL received a backlash of bad publicity, with indignant football fans in constant sarcasm (akin to rules imposed about on-field behavior i.e. taunting opposition teams) referring to the NFL as the &quot;No Fun League.&quot;<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> For example, the enforcement of this policy earned the <a href="National_Football_League" title="wikilink">NFL</a> a &quot;Worst Person in the World&quot; silver on the February 2, 2007 edition of <em><a href="Countdown_with_Keith_Olbermann" title="wikilink">Countdown with Keith Olbermann</a></em>.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a></p>
<p>After a long series of bad press, the NFL issued a written statement clarifying their policy, saying that they did not object to churches hosting Super Bowl parties so long as they did not charge admission and showed the game on &quot;a television of the type commonly used at home&quot;. This statement did not attempt to forbid coordination of any other message with the game, something typically done by churches, nor did it attempt to forbid the use of the term &quot;Super Bowl.&quot;<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a><a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a></p>
