<p>The <strong>Kennet</strong> is a river in the south of England, and a <a href="tributary" class="uri" title="wikilink">tributary</a> of the <a href="River_Thames" title="wikilink">River Thames</a>. The lower reaches of the river are navigable to river craft and are known as the <strong>Kennet Navigation</strong>, which, together with the <a href="Avon_Navigation" title="wikilink">Avon Navigation</a>, the <a href="Kennet_and_Avon_Canal" title="wikilink">Kennet and Avon Canal</a> and the Thames, links the cities of <a href="Bristol" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bristol</a> and <a href="London" class="uri" title="wikilink">London</a>. The former local government district of <a href="Kennet_(district)" title="wikilink">Kennet</a> in <a href="Wiltshire" class="uri" title="wikilink">Wiltshire</a> was named after it.</p>
<p>The River Kennet has been assigned as a <a href="Site_of_Special_Scientific_Interest" title="wikilink">Site of Special Scientific Interest</a> (SSSI) from near its sources west of Marlborough down to <a href="Woolhampton" class="uri" title="wikilink">Woolhampton</a>. This is primarily because it has an extensive range of rare plants and animals that are unique to <a href="chalk" class="uri" title="wikilink">chalk</a> watercourses.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="course">Course</h2>

<p>One of the Kennet's sources is <a href="Swallowhead_Spring" title="wikilink">Swallowhead Spring</a> near <a href="Silbury_Hill" title="wikilink">Silbury Hill</a> in the county of <a href="Wiltshire" class="uri" title="wikilink">Wiltshire</a>, the other being a collection of tributaries to the North of <a href="Avebury" class="uri" title="wikilink">Avebury</a> near the villages of <a href="Uffcott" class="uri" title="wikilink">Uffcott</a> and <a href="Broad_Hinton" title="wikilink">Broad Hinton</a> which flow south past Avebury and join up with the waters from Swallowhead Springs. In these early stages it passes close by many prehistoric sites including for <a href="Avebury_Henge" title="wikilink">Avebury Henge</a> and <a href="Silbury_Hill" title="wikilink">Silbury Hill</a>. The upper reaches though are prone to drought.</p>
<p>From there the river flows through <a href="Marlborough,_Wiltshire" title="wikilink">Marlborough</a>, <a href="Hungerford" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hungerford</a> and <a href="Newbury,_Berkshire" title="wikilink">Newbury</a> before flowing into the Thames on the reach above <a href="Sonning_Lock" title="wikilink">Sonning Lock</a> at <a href="Reading,_Berkshire" title="wikilink">Reading</a> in <a href="Berkshire" class="uri" title="wikilink">Berkshire</a>.</p>
<p>The upper reaches of the River Kennet are served by two tributaries. The <a href="River_Og" title="wikilink">River Og</a> which flows into the Kennet at Marlborough and the <a href="River_Dun_(River_Kennet)" title="wikilink">River Dun</a> which enters at Hungerford. The Kennet's principal tributaries below Marlborough are the <a href="River_Lambourn" title="wikilink">River Lambourn</a>, the <a href="River_Enborne" title="wikilink">River Enborne</a> and the <a href="Foudry_Brook" title="wikilink">Foudry Brook</a>. For six miles (10Â km) to the west of, and through, Reading, the Kennet supports a secondary channel, known as the <a href="Holy_Brook" title="wikilink">Holy Brook</a>, which formerly powered the <a href="water_mill" title="wikilink">water mills</a> of <a href="Reading_Abbey" title="wikilink">Reading Abbey</a>.</p>

<p>The Horseshoe Bridge at Kennet Mouth, a timber-clad iron-truss structure, was built in 1891 as the method for horses towing barges to cross the river.</p>
<p>The first mile of the river, from Kennet Mouth to the High Bridge in Reading, has been navigable since at least the thirteenth century, providing <a href="wharf" title="wikilink">wharfage</a> for both the townspeople and <a href="Reading_Abbey" title="wikilink">Reading Abbey</a>. Originally this short stretch of navigable river was under the control of the Abbey; today it, including <a href="Blake&#39;s_Lock" title="wikilink">Blake's Lock</a>, is administered by the <a href="Environment_Agency" title="wikilink">Environment Agency</a> as if it were part of the River Thames.</p>
<p>From <a href="High_Bridge,_Reading" title="wikilink">High Bridge</a> through to Newbury, the river was made navigable between 1718 and 1723 under the supervision of the engineer <a href="John_Hore" title="wikilink">John Hore</a> of Newbury. Known as the Kennet Navigation, this stretch of the river is now administered by the <a href="Canal_&amp;_River_Trust" title="wikilink">Canal &amp; River Trust</a> as part of the <a href="Kennet_and_Avon_Canal" title="wikilink">Kennet and Avon Canal</a>. Throughout the navigation, stretches of natural riverbed alternate with  of artificially created <a href="Canal_lock" title="wikilink">lock</a> cuts, and a series of locks including; <a href="County_Lock" title="wikilink">County</a>, <a href="Fobney_Lock" title="wikilink">Fobney</a>, <a href="Southcote_Lock" title="wikilink">Southcote</a>, <a href="Burghfield_Lock" title="wikilink">Burghfield</a>, <a href="Garston_Lock" title="wikilink">Garston</a>, <a href="Sheffield_Lock" title="wikilink">Sheffield</a>, <a href="Sulhamstead_Lock" title="wikilink">Sulhamstead</a> and <a href="Tyle_Mill_Lock" title="wikilink">Tyle Mill</a> overcome a rise of .</p>
<h2 id="wildlife">Wildlife</h2>
<p>The River Kennet is a haven for various plants and animals. Its course takes it through the North Wessex Downs Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, and the river between Marlborough and Woolhampton is designated a <a href="Site_of_Special_Scientific_Interest" title="wikilink">Site of Special Scientific Interest</a> (SSSI). The protection that this status affords the Kennet means that many endangered species of plants and animals can be found here. The white drifts of Water Crowfoot (<a href="Ranunculus" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ranunculus</a>) in early summer are characteristic of chalk and limestone rivers; there are superb displays by the footbridge at <a href="Chilton_Foliat" title="wikilink">Chilton Foliat</a>, and by the road bridge in <a href="Hungerford" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hungerford</a>.</p>
<p>Animal species such as the <a href="European_water_vole" title="wikilink">Water Vole</a>, <a href="Grass_Snake" title="wikilink">Grass Snake</a>, <a href="Reed_Bunting" title="wikilink">Reed Bunting</a>, <a href="Brown_Trout" title="wikilink">Brown Trout</a>, and <a href="Brook_Lamprey" title="wikilink">Brook Lamprey</a> flourish here, despite being in decline in other parts of the country. <a href="Crayfish" class="uri" title="wikilink">Crayfish</a> are very common in parts of the river. However, most, if not all, are now the alien <a href="Signal_crayfish" title="wikilink">American Signal Crayfish</a>, having escaped from crayfish farms, which has replaced the native <a href="White-clawed_Crayfish" title="wikilink">White-clawed Crayfish</a> in most southern rivers, although a small population still survives in the <a href="River_Lambourn" title="wikilink">River Lambourn</a>. And not forgetting the foundation to supporting this varied wildlife food chain, there are the insects, many hundreds of species, common and rare, that can be found in and around the River Kennet. There are large hatches of <a href="Mayfly" title="wikilink">mayflies</a>, whose long-tailed, short-lived adults are a favourite food of trout; many species of water beetle and insect larvae. <a href="Caddisfly" title="wikilink">caddisflies</a> are also very numerous, especially in the late summer. Alongside the river, the reed beds, grasses and other vegetation support many other insect species, including the <a href="Scarlet_tiger_moth" title="wikilink">Scarlet Tiger Moth</a>, <a href="Poplar_Hawk_Moth" title="wikilink">Poplar Hawk Moths</a> and <a href="Privet_Hawk-moth" title="wikilink">Privet Hawks</a>.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="resource-uses">Resource uses</h2>
<p>Throughout its history the Kennet has been used as a source of power for various pre-industrial and industrial activities by the use of water mills. In places the river has been built up to provide additional head of water to drive them. Three mills remain in Ramsbury alone, and there are many disused or former mill sites, such as at <a href="Southcote,_Berkshire" title="wikilink">Southcote</a>, <a href="Burghfield" class="uri" title="wikilink">Burghfield</a>, <a href="Sulhamstead" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sulhamstead</a>, <a href="Aldermaston" class="uri" title="wikilink">Aldermaston</a>, <a href="Thatcham" class="uri" title="wikilink">Thatcham</a>, <a href="Newbury,_Berkshire" title="wikilink">Newbury</a>, and <a href="Hungerford" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hungerford</a>. Aside from the mills, in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, the river water was also used for the brewing and tanning industries of Ramsbury and Marlborough.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="etymology">Etymology</h2>
<p>It was formerly known as the &quot;Cunnit&quot;. Local historian <a href="Michael_Dames" title="wikilink">Michael Dames</a> claims the name is related to the word &quot;<a href="cunt" class="uri" title="wikilink">cunt</a>&quot;, though it is more likely derived from the nearby Roman settlement of <a href="Cunetio" class="uri" title="wikilink">Cunetio</a> (now <a href="Mildenhall,_Wiltshire" title="wikilink">Mildenhall</a>).<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a><a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>Following this idea it may be related with the &quot;<a href="Cynetes" class="uri" title="wikilink">Cynetes</a>&quot; a very ancient people.</p>
<p>In the &quot;Dictionnaire de la langue gauloise&quot; (dictionary of the Gallic language), Xavier Delamare proposes : cuno meaning &quot;dog&quot;, and knowing in insulary Celtic otter is said &quot;water dog&quot;, the name of Kennet could be &quot;otter's lair&quot;.</p>
<p>e.g. : cuno -&gt;Ki, Breton Ki-dour, cornish dowr-gi, Welsh dyfr-gi</p>
