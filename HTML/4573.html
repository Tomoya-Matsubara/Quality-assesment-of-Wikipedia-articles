<p><strong>Edmund Sharpe</strong> (31 October 1809 &lt;U+2013&gt; 8 May 1877) was an English architect, <a href="architectural_historian" title="wikilink">architectural historian</a>, railway engineer, and <a href="Sanitary_engineering" title="wikilink">sanitary</a> reformer. Born in <a href="Knutsford" class="uri" title="wikilink">Knutsford</a>, Cheshire, he was educated first by his parents and then at schools locally and in <a href="Runcorn" class="uri" title="wikilink">Runcorn</a>, <a href="Greenwich" class="uri" title="wikilink">Greenwich</a> and <a href="Sedbergh" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sedbergh</a>. Following his graduation from <a href="University_of_Cambridge" title="wikilink">Cambridge University</a> he was awarded a travelling scholarship, enabling him to study architecture in Germany and southern France. In 1835 he established an architectural practice in <a href="Lancaster,_Lancashire" title="wikilink">Lancaster</a>, initially working on his own. In 1845 he entered into partnership with <a href="Edward_Graham_Paley" title="wikilink">Edward Paley</a>, one of his pupils. Sharpe's main focus was on churches, and he was a pioneer in the use of <a href="Architectural_terracotta" title="wikilink">terracotta</a> as a structural material in church building, designing what were known as &quot;pot&quot; churches. He also designed secular buildings, including domestic properties and schools, and worked on the development of railways in Northwest England, designing bridges and planning new lines. In 1851 he resigned from his architectural practice, and in 1856 he moved from Lancaster, spending the remainder of his career mainly as a railway engineer, first in North Wales, then in Switzerland and southern France. Sharpe returned to England in 1866 to live in <a href="Scotforth" class="uri" title="wikilink">Scotforth</a> near Lancaster, where he designed a final church near to his home.</p>
<p>While working in his architectural practice, Sharpe was involved in Lancaster's civic affairs. He was an elected town councillor and served as mayor in 1848&lt;U+2013&gt;49. Concerned about the town's poor water supply and sanitation, he championed the construction of new sewers and a waterworks. He was a talented musician, and took part in the artistic, literary, and scientific activities in the town. An accomplished sportsman, he took an active interest in archery, rowing and cricket.</p>
<p>Sharpe achieved national recognition as an architectural historian. He published books of detailed architectural drawings, wrote a number of articles on architecture, devised a scheme for the classification of <a href="English_Gothic_architecture" title="wikilink">English Gothic architectural</a> styles, and in 1875 was awarded the <a href="Royal_Gold_Medal" title="wikilink">Royal Gold Medal</a> of the <a href="Royal_Institute_of_British_Architects" title="wikilink">Royal Institute of British Architects</a>. He was critical of much of the <a href="Victorian_restoration" title="wikilink">restoration</a> of <a href="Middle_Ages" title="wikilink">medieval</a> churches that had become a major occupation of contemporary architects. Towards the end of his career Sharpe organised expeditions to study and draw buildings in England and France. While on such an expedition to Italy in 1877, he was taken ill and died. His body was taken to Lancaster, where he was buried. Sharpe's legacy consists of about 40 extant churches; railway features, including the <a href="Conwy_Valley_Line" title="wikilink">Conwy Valley Line</a> and bridges on what is now the Lancashire section of the <a href="West_Coast_Main_Line" title="wikilink">West Coast Main Line</a>; and his archive of architectural books, articles and drawings.</p>

<p>By 1838 Sharpe had begun to experiment with elements of English Gothic architecture, initially in the <a href="English_Gothic_architecture#Early_English_Gothic" title="wikilink">Early English</a> style and in particular the <a href="lancet_window" title="wikilink">lancet window</a>, dating from the early 12th century or earlier.

<p>Sharpe was one of the architects who designed churches for the Church Building Commission, which had been established by the Church Building Acts of 1818 and 1824. The resulting churches have been called <a href="Commissioners&#39;_church" title="wikilink">Commissioners' churches</a>, and were built to provide places of worship in newly populated areas.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a> Sharpe designed six churches for the Commission: <a href="St_John&#39;s_Church,_Dukinfield" title="wikilink">St John, Dukinfield</a>, <a href="St_George&#39;s_Church,_Stalybridge" title="wikilink">St George, Stalybridge</a> (both 1838&lt;U+2013&gt;40), St John the Baptist, Bretherton, St Paul, Farington, <a href="St_Catharine&#39;s_Church,_Scholes" title="wikilink">St Catharine, Scholes</a> (near <a href="Wigan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Wigan</a>) (1839&lt;U+2013&gt;41), and <a href="Holy_Trinity_Church,_Blackburn" title="wikilink">Holy Trinity, Blackburn</a> (1837&lt;U+2013&gt;46).<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a></p>
<p>Although some architects designed the earlier Commissioners' churches in <a href="neoclassical_architecture" title="wikilink">neoclassical</a> style, most were in <a href="Gothic_Revival_architecture" title="wikilink">Gothic Revival</a> style. The earliest of the Gothic Revival churches were based loosely on the Early English style, with single or paired lancet windows between <a href="buttress" title="wikilink">buttresses</a> in the sides of the church, and stepped triple lancets at the east end. Others were in a &quot;stilted Perpendicular&quot; style,<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a> with &quot;thin west towers, thin buttresses, fat <a href="pinnacle" title="wikilink">pinnacles</a>, and interiors with three galleries and plaster <a href="Vault_(architecture)" title="wikilink">vaults</a>&quot;.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a> These features were only loosely derived from medieval Gothic architecture, and were not true representations of it.<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a> A major influence on the subsequent development of the Gothic Revival was <a href="Augustus_Welby_Northmore_Pugin" title="wikilink">A. W. N. Pugin</a> (1812&lt;U+2013&gt;52) and, influenced by him, the <a href="Cambridge_Camden_Society" title="wikilink">Cambridge Camden Society</a> (later named the Ecclesiological Society).<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a> Among other things, they argued that not only should Gothic be the only right and proper style for churches, but that their features should be accurate representations of that style; they should be &quot;correct&quot; Gothic features, rather than being loosely derived from the style.<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a> The term &quot;pre-archaeological&quot; was used to describe churches designed using features only loosely derived from true Gothic.<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a></p>
<p>Sharpe's early Gothic Revival works were pre-archaeological, including <a href="Holy_Trinity_Church,_Blackburn" title="wikilink">Holy Trinity, Blackburn</a>, built in 1837&lt;U+2013&gt;46 for Revd J. W. Whittaker.<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a> Hughes expresses the opinion that this church is Sharpe's <em>pi&lt;U+00E8&gt;ce de resistance</em>,<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a> it contains &quot;a mongrel mix of Gothic styles&quot;.<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a> Simultaneously Sharpe was involved in the design of about twelve more churches in Northwest England, which increasingly incorporated more &quot;correct&quot; Gothic features.<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a> In 1841 he obtained a contract to build three churches and associated structures (vicarages and schools) for the <a href="River_Weaver" title="wikilink">Weaver Navigation</a> Trustees, at Weston Point, <a href="Runcorn" class="uri" title="wikilink">Runcorn</a>; Castle, <a href="Northwich" class="uri" title="wikilink">Northwich</a>; and <a href="Winsford" class="uri" title="wikilink">Winsford</a>.

<p>In the early 1840s Sharpe was invited by John Fletcher, his future brother-in-law, to build a church near Fletcher's home in <a href="Little_Bolton" title="wikilink">Little Bolton</a>. Fletcher was the owner of a <a href="Ladyshore_Colliery" title="wikilink">coal mine at Ladyshore</a>, <a href="Little_Lever" title="wikilink">Little Lever</a>, overlooking the <a href="River_Irwell" title="wikilink">River Irwell</a> and the <a href="Manchester,_Bolton_&amp;_Bury_Canal" title="wikilink">Manchester, Bolton &amp; Bury Canal</a>. He had been using the clay which came up with the coal to make <a href="Fire_brick" title="wikilink">refractory bricks</a> for furnaces, and suggested its use for building the church, as it was much cheaper than stone. Sharpe then designed the first church in England to be built, in whole or in part, from this material (<a href="terracotta" class="uri" title="wikilink">terracotta</a>), <a href="St_Stephen_and_All_Martyrs&#39;_Church,_Lever_Bridge" title="wikilink">St Stephen and All Martyrs, Lever Bridge</a> (1842&lt;U+2013&gt;44).<a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a> As terracotta is commonly used to make plant pots and the like, Sharpe himself called this church, and its two successors, &quot;the pot churches&quot;, a nickname that has stuck. The advantages of terracotta were its cheapness, its sturdiness as a building material, and the fact that it could be moulded into almost any shape. It could therefore be used for walls, towers, arches, and <a href="arcade_(architecture)" title="wikilink">arcades</a> in a church, for the detailed decoration of <a href="capital_(architecture)" title="wikilink">capitals</a> and <a href="pinnacle" title="wikilink">pinnacles</a>, and also, as at St Stephen's, for the furnishings, such as the altar, <a href="pulpit" class="uri" title="wikilink">pulpit</a>, <a href="baptismal_font" title="wikilink">font</a>, organ case, and the pew ends. Apart from the foundations and the rubble within the walls, St Stephen and All Martyrs was constructed entirely from terracotta.<a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a> The following year, a second church was built using the same material, <a href="Holy_Trinity_Platt_Church" title="wikilink">Trinity Church, Rusholme</a>, south of Manchester (1845&lt;U+2013&gt;46), built and paid for by Thomas Carill-Worsley, who lived at nearby <a href="Platt_Fields_Park#Platt_Hall" title="wikilink">Platt Hall</a>. In this case, although the exterior is in terracotta, the interior is of plastered brick. The church was consecrated in June 1846, although at the time work on the spire had not yet started and several other features were incomplete, including the heating, seating, and floor tiling.<a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a><a href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a><a href="#fn67" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a> <img src="Hornby_Castle,_Lancashire_(2).jpg" title="fig:Hornby Castle, remodelled by Sharpe|alt=A castellated country house seen from a distance" alt="Hornby Castle, remodelled by Sharpe|alt=A castellated country house seen from a distance" /> Towards the end of his life, Sharpe designed one more church incorporating terracotta, St Paul, Scotforth, Lancaster (1874&lt;U+2013&gt;76). For this he returned to the Romanesque style, and used terracotta as a building and a decorative material. By this time he was living in <a href="Scotforth" class="uri" title="wikilink">Scotforth</a>, then a separate village to the south of Lancaster, but now absorbed into the city. The new church was built within  of his home, and again terracotta was not the only material used.

<p>During his time as an architect Sharpe was also involved in the building, repair, and restoration of non-ecclesiastic structures, including houses and bridges. In 1837 he was appointed bridgemaster for the <a href="Lonsdale_(hundred)" title="wikilink">Hundred of Lonsdale South of the Sands</a>, and in 1839 he supervised the repair of <a href="Skerton_Bridge" title="wikilink">Skerton Bridge</a> over the <a href="River_Lune" title="wikilink">River Lune</a> in Lancaster. The following year he designed a new bridge over the <a href="River_Hyndburn" title="wikilink">River Hyndburn</a> at Fournessford, a village to the east of <a href="Wray,_Lancashire" title="wikilink">Wray</a>. He had also been appointed as architect and superintendent of works for <a href="Lancaster_Castle" title="wikilink">Lancaster Castle</a>, the <a href="Judges_Lodgings,_Lancaster" title="wikilink">Judges' Lodgings</a>, and the County Lunatic Asylum (later the Lancaster Moor Hospital).<a href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a> For the asylum he designed several new wings and a chapel, followed by extensions to the union <a href="workhouse" class="uri" title="wikilink">workhouse</a>.<a href="#fn72" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref72"><sup>72</sup></a> Sharpe was also involved in designing and altering several domestic buildings. In 1843 he designed a vicarage in <a href="Cockermouth" class="uri" title="wikilink">Cockermouth</a>, and the following year he started to remodel <a href="Capernwray_Hall" title="wikilink">Capernwray Hall</a>, a <a href="country_house" title="wikilink">country house</a> northeast of Lancaster. In the same year he designed the <a href="Governor&#39;s_House,_Knutsford" title="wikilink">Governor's House</a> for Knutsford Gaol, and in 1845 he re-designed <a href="Redmarshall_Old_Rectory" title="wikilink">Redmarshall Old Rectory</a> for the Revd Thomas Austin, father of Sharpe's pupil (also named Thomas).<a href="#fn73" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref73"><sup>73</sup></a><a href="#fn74" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref74"><sup>74</sup></a> Following Paley's becoming a partner in 1845, the pair worked together to design Lee Bridge in <a href="Over_Wyresdale" title="wikilink">Over Wyresdale</a> (1847), to plan the conversion of a disused manor house into the <a href="Furness_Abbey_Hotel" title="wikilink">Furness Abbey Hotel</a> (1847), and to arrange the remodelling of <a href="Hornby_Castle,_Lancashire" title="wikilink">Hornby Castle</a> (1847&lt;U+2013&gt;52).<a href="#fn75" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref75"><sup>75</sup></a><a href="#fn76" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref76"><sup>76</sup></a> In 1849&lt;U+2013&gt;50 they planned the rebuilding and enlargement of the Charity School for Girls in Middle Street, Lancaster, followed in 1851 by the National School for Boys in St Leonard's Gate.

<p><img src="Architectural_Parallels_page.jpg" title="fig:Page from Architectural Parallels|alt=A page with 12 drawings of carved capitals" alt="Page from Architectural Parallels|alt=A page with 12 drawings of carved capitals" /> Sharpe studied and wrote about ecclesiastical architecture throughout his adult life, both sketching and measuring historical churches and ruins. This resulted in a systematic series of published drawings in twelve parts between 1845 and 1847 entitled <em>Architectural Parallels</em>, containing measured drawings of abbey churches in the early Gothic style, and reissued as a single work in 1848. Sharpe intended to produce a further version with text, but this never transpired. Also in 1848 a <em>Supplement to Architectural Parallels</em>, was published, containing yet more detailed drawings.<a href="#fn78" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref78"><sup>78</sup></a><a href="#fn79" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref79"><sup>79</sup></a> Simultaneously, Sharpe had produced the two-volume work <em>Decorated Windows</em>, the first volume being published in 1845, and the second in 1849. The work, which was praised by the art critic <a href="John_Ruskin" title="wikilink">John Ruskin</a> in <em><a href="The_Stones_of_Venice_(book)" title="wikilink">The Stones of Venice</a></em>, consisted largely of drawings by Sharpe's pupils &lt;U+2013&gt; Paley, Austin, and R. J. Withers &lt;U+2013&gt; with text by Sharpe describing and analysing the <a href="tracery" class="uri" title="wikilink">tracery</a> of Gothic windows.<a href="#fn80" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref80"><sup>80</sup></a><a href="#fn81" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref81"><sup>81</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1851 Sharpe published a <a href="monograph" class="uri" title="wikilink">monograph</a> entitled <em>The Seven Periods of English Architecture</em>, a small book of about 50 pages suggesting a new scheme for classifying the styles of English ecclesiastical architecture &quot;from the Heptarchy to the Reformation&quot;.<a href="#fn82" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref82"><sup>82</sup></a> It was intended to replace the scheme then in use, which had been proposed in 1817 by Thomas Rickman.<a href="#fn83" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref83"><sup>83</sup></a><a href="#fn84" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref84"><sup>84</sup></a> Rickman had divided English architecture into &quot;four distinct periods, or styles&quot; which he termed &quot;<a href="Norman_architecture" title="wikilink">Norman</a>&quot;, &quot;<a href="English_Gothic_architecture#Early_English" title="wikilink">Early English</a>&quot;, &quot;<a href="English_Gothic_architecture#Decorated" title="wikilink">Decorated English</a>&quot;, and &quot;<a href="English_Gothic_architecture#Perpendicular" title="wikilink">Perpendicular English</a>&quot;.<a href="#fn85" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref85"><sup>85</sup></a> The Norman style lasting until about 1189, was characterised by its arches usually being semicircular, although sometimes pointed; the ornamentation was &quot;bold and rude&quot;.<a href="#fn86" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref86"><sup>86</sup></a> The Early English style, continuing to about 1307, was distinguished by its pointed arches and long narrow windows without <a href="mullion" title="wikilink">mullions</a>. He called the characteristic ornamentation &quot;toothed&quot; because it resembled the teeth of the shark.<a href="#fn87" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref87"><sup>87</sup></a> The following period, the Decorated English lasted until 1377, or possibly 10&lt;U+2013&gt;15 years later, was characterised by large windows with pointed arches containing mullions, and with <a href="tracery" class="uri" title="wikilink">tracery</a> &quot;in flowing lines forming circles, arches and other figures&quot;. There was much ornamentation, carved very delicately.<a href="#fn88" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref88"><sup>88</sup></a> The final period identified by Rickman, the Perpendicular English, lasted until as long as 1630 or 1640. This was distinguished by the mullions and the &quot;ornamental panellings&quot; running in perpendicular lines. The ornamentation was in many cases &quot;so crowded as to destroy the beauty of the design&quot;. The carving was again &quot;very delicately executed&quot;.<a href="#fn89" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref89"><sup>89</sup></a></p>
<p>In his classification, Sharpe first identified two main classes, according to whether the arches were &quot;circular&quot; or &quot;pointed&quot;. The class characterised by the circular arch was the Romanesque class; that by the pointed arch was the Gothic. He divided the Romanesque class into two periods by date rather than by stylistic differences, the dividing date being 1066; this divided the &quot;Saxon&quot; from the &quot;Norman&quot; stage.<a href="#fn90" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref90"><sup>90</sup></a> Whereas Rickman allowed pointed arches when they occurred in the same building as round arches in his Norman period, Sharpe separated buildings that contained both types of arches into a separate intermediate style, the &quot;Transitional&quot;.<a href="#fn91" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref91"><sup>91</sup></a> When it came to the Gothic class, Sharpe identified four styles, in contrast to Rickman's three, using the windows to differentiate between them. The earliest style was characterised by windows resembling a lancet &quot;in its length, breadth, and principal proportions&quot;. These windows might be single, or in groups of two, three, five, or seven. This style he termed the &quot;Lancet Period&quot;.<a href="#fn92" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref92"><sup>92</sup></a> During the next period, tracery appeared in the windows, and originally consisted of simple geometric forms, in particular the circle. This period he called the &quot;Geometrical Period&quot;.<a href="#fn93" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref93"><sup>93</sup></a> Later the tracery became more complex, including the <a href="ogee" class="uri" title="wikilink">ogee</a> curve; the characteristic feature being the &quot;sinuosity of form&quot; in the windows and elsewhere. This Sharpe termed the &quot;Curvilinear Period&quot;.<a href="#fn94" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref94"><sup>94</sup></a> Finally, the <a href="transom_(architecture)" title="wikilink">transom</a> appeared in the windows, and the curved line in the tracery became replaced by straight lines, an &quot;angularity of form&quot;, and a &quot;square edge was preferred&quot;. This style he named the &quot;Rectilinear Period&quot;.<a href="#fn95" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref95"><sup>95</sup></a> The approximate dates Sharpe gave for his periods were, following 1066, the Norman Period up to 1145, the Transitional Period to 1190, the Lancet Period to 1245, the Geometrical Period to 1315, the Curvilinear Period to 1360, and the Rectilinear Period to 1550.<a href="#fn96" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref96"><sup>96</sup></a></p>
<p>In comparing the two classifications, Sharpe divides Richman's Norman period into two, the Norman and the Transitional periods. Then Rickman has three Gothic periods in contrast to Sharpe's four. Comparing the descriptions of the styles and, approximately, the dates, Sharpe's Lancet Period corresponds generally with Rickman's Early English; and Sharpe's Rectilinear Period with Rickman's Perpendicular English. This leaves Rickman's Decorated English style divided into two periods by Sharpe according to the complexity of the tracery, the Geometrical and the Curvilinear Periods. Following the publication of the monograph, Sharpe read a paper to the <a href="Royal_Institute_of_British_Architects" title="wikilink">Royal Institute of British Architects</a> describing his system. The monograph and the paper led to &quot;a bitter controversy&quot;.<a href="#fn97" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref97"><sup>97</sup></a> The debate between Sharpe and his followers on one side and supporters of Rickman's scheme on the other was published as a series of letters to the journal <em><a href="Building_(magazine)" title="wikilink">The Builder</a></em> until the editor called a halt to the correspondence.<a href="#fn98" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref98"><sup>98</sup></a></p>
<p>In the same year as Sharpe's short book, <em>An Essay on the Origin and Development of Window Tracery in England</em>, a much larger work on essentially the same subject, was published by the distinguished historian <a href="Edward_Augustus_Freeman" title="wikilink">Edward Augustus Freeman</a>, which proposed the terms &quot;Flowing&quot; and &quot;Flamboyant&quot; (the later already in use in France) where Sharpe used &quot;Curvilinear&quot;. Although Rickman's scheme remains in general use, despite recognition of its deficiencies, Sharpe's terms &quot;Geometrical&quot; and &quot;Curvilinear&quot; are very often used in addition to distinguish styles or phases within Rickman's &quot;Decorated&quot;. They were used by Francis Bond in his 1905 book <em>Gothic Architecture in England</em>, and are used in various recent works including the <a href="Pevsner_Architectural_Guides" title="wikilink">Pevsner Architectural Guides</a>.<a href="#fn99" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref99"><sup>99</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1869 Sharpe joined the <a href="Architectural_Association_School_of_Architecture" title="wikilink">Architectural Association</a>, established in 1847 &quot;by a group of dissatisfied young architects ... to provide a self-directed, independent education at a time when there was no formal training available&quot;.<a href="#fn100" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref100"><sup>100</sup></a><a href="#fn101" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref101"><sup>101</sup></a> He then proposed and organised a series of six annual expeditions to study and draw buildings in different areas, which took place between 1870 and 1875.

These were the lines between Lancaster and <a href="Preston,_Lancashire" title="wikilink">Preston</a>, Lancaster and <a href="Skipton" class="uri" title="wikilink">Skipton</a>, and between <a href="Liverpool" class="uri" title="wikilink">Liverpool</a> and <a href="Southport" class="uri" title="wikilink">Southport</a>. He first became involved with the <a href="Lancaster_and_Preston_Junction_Railway" title="wikilink">Lancaster and Preston Junction Railway</a> in 1838,<a href="#fn118" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref118"><sup>118</sup></a> two years after <a href="Joseph_Locke" title="wikilink">Joseph Locke</a> was appointed as engineer for the line.<a href="#fn119" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref119"><sup>119</sup></a> Sharpe submitted a tender to supply the masonry work for the &quot;Lancaster Contract&quot;, the northern section of the line; and Peter Perry from <a href="Durham" class="uri" title="wikilink">Durham</a> submitted a tender for the earthwork. Locke insisted that both earthwork and masonry work should be under one contract, which Perry accepted and subcontracted the masonry work to Sharpe.<a href="#fn120" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref120"><sup>120</sup></a> Subsequently Perry reneged on his part of the contract, resulting in serious disputes between Sharpe, Locke, and the directors of the railway company concerning the costs involved and the quality of the work. The masonry for this section of the line included 15 under-and-over bridges and the six-arch viaduct over the <a href="River_Conder" title="wikilink">River Conder</a> at <a href="Galgate" class="uri" title="wikilink">Galgate</a>. The eventual outcome of the conflict was that Sharpe was dismissed from the work in 1839 with agreed financial compensation, having built most but not all of these structures.<a href="#fn121" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref121"><sup>121</sup></a></p>
<p>Sharpe's next venture into railway building came in 1845 when, with others, he promoted the building of a cross-country line from Lancaster to Skipton to join the <a href="Midland_Railway" title="wikilink">Midland Railway</a> in the <a href="West_Riding_of_Yorkshire" title="wikilink">West Riding of Yorkshire</a>. This became known as the <a href="&quot;Little&quot;_North_Western_Railway" title="wikilink">&quot;Little&quot; North Western Railway</a> (&quot;L&quot;NWR), with projected branches joining the <a href="Lancaster_and_Carlisle_Railway" title="wikilink">Lancaster and Carlisle Railway</a> (then under construction) at points near <a href="Milnthorpe" class="uri" title="wikilink">Milnthorpe</a> and <a href="Orton,_Eden" title="wikilink">Orton</a>. In the event the Milnthorpe branch was dropped during the committee stage of the passage through Parliament of the enabling Bill, leaving the Lancaster and Orton branches intact, parting at <a href="Ingleton,_North_Yorkshire" title="wikilink">Ingleton</a> and making much use of the Lune Valley.<a href="#fn122" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref122"><sup>122</sup></a></p>
<p>About this time, the amount of trade handled by the Port of Lancaster was declining, largely owing to <a href="silt" title="wikilink">silting</a> up of the River Lune. In May 1842 Sharpe had been elected a Port Commissioner, and later proposed what became the <a href="Morecambe_Bay" title="wikilink">Morecambe Bay</a> Harbour Project. This planned to build a new port at <a href="Poulton-le-Sands" class="uri" title="wikilink">Poulton-le-Sands</a> (soon to become part of <a href="Morecambe" class="uri" title="wikilink">Morecambe</a>), and link it to Lancaster by means of a <a href="ship_canal" title="wikilink">ship canal</a>. After prolonged discussion this proved to be too expensive, and it was agreed to link Lancaster and Morecambe by railway rather than by canal. An Act for the creation of the Morecambe Harbour and Railway Company (MH&amp;R) received Royal assent in July 1846, the revised plan being to link this line to the &quot;L&quot;NWR at <a href="Lancaster_Green_Ayre_railway_station" title="wikilink">Green Ayre</a>, in the northern part of Lancaster next to the River Lune.

<p>In 1860 a horse-drawn tramway had been built by Charles Burn, an Englishman, in Switzerland between Geneva and <a href="Carouge" class="uri" title="wikilink">Carouge</a>, a distance of about . This proved to be a success, and Burn planned to build more lines. In 1863 he was joined by Sharpe as a partner, but after a short time of working together the partnership was dissolved, and Sharpe continued with the project alone.<a href="#fn139" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref139"><sup>139</sup></a> By March 1864 a line from the centre of Geneva to <a href="Ch&lt;U+00EA&gt;ne-Bougeries" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ch&lt;U+00EA&gt;ne-Bougeries</a>, a distance of about  was under construction, to an innovative design. The line to Carouge had two grooved rails. Sharpe's line had two flat rails, with a third grooved rail between them, along which ran a wheel allowing the tram to be steered. The wheel could also be raised to permit the tram to deviate from the track to pass around obstacles, or come to the pavement. This line was Sharpe's sole venture in Switzerland.<a href="#fn140" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref140"><sup>140</sup></a><a href="#fn141" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref141"><sup>141</sup></a></p>

Sharpe was managing the project largely from Paris, through a series of agents. By the latter part of 1864 the stress was adversely affecting his health, so in 1865 he spent some time in Italy to recuperate. Following his return the difficulties continued to mount, and in 1867 he renounced his concession.<a href="#fn143" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref143"><sup>143</sup></a><a href="#fn144" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref144"><sup>144</sup></a> The line was eventually taken over by the State, and was not fully completed until about 1877.

By political persuasion he was a <a href="Conservatism" title="wikilink">Conservative</a>, and in 1837 he joined the local Heart of Oak Club, the core of the Lancaster Conservative Association.<a href="#fn146" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref146"><sup>146</sup></a> He was elected a town councillor for Castle Ward in 1841, a post he held for ten years, and in 1843 was appointed the town council's representative on the local Police Commission.

The conflict was unresolved until the two bodies merged in 1849.<a href="#fn153" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref153"><sup>153</sup></a> The functions of the new body included the establishment of the first <a href="Local_board_of_health" title="wikilink">Lancaster Board of Health</a>.<a href="#fn154" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref154"><sup>154</sup></a> <img src="Lancaster_Town_Hall_1828.jpg" title="fig:Lancaster Town Hall in 1828|alt=A coloured engraving of a neoclassical building" alt="Lancaster Town Hall in 1828|alt=A coloured engraving of a neoclassical building" /> Before, during and after his mayoralty, Sharpe played a major role in promoting sanitary reform, often meeting considerable opposition and needing to use his oratorical, political and persuasive skills to the full.<a href="#fn155" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref155"><sup>155</sup></a> A campaign to deal with the problems had been initiated in 1847 by two Lancaster doctors, Thomas Howitt and Edward Denis de Vitre. Sharpe joined them, drawing extensively on his experience of having accompanied <a href="Richard_Owen" title="wikilink">Professor Richard Owen</a> (born and educated in Lancaster) on his tour of inspection of the town in 1844.<a href="#fn156" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref156"><sup>156</sup></a> In 1848 Robert Rawlinson, also from Lancaster, was appointed as local surveyor,<a href="#fn157" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref157"><sup>157</sup></a> and published a further report that recommended new sewers and drains and the construction of a waterworks.<a href="#fn158" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref158"><sup>158</sup></a> Although Sharpe agreed in principle with the report, he was not satisfied with its details. Later that year, which was during his mayoralty, he travelled to London with the town clerk and a former mayor to meet representatives of the <a href="Local_board_of_health#General_Board_of_Health" title="wikilink">General Board of Health</a>, including its chairman, <a href="George_Howard,_6th_Earl_of_Carlisle" title="wikilink">Lord Morpeth</a>, and its secretary <a href="Edwin_Chadwick" title="wikilink">Edwin Chadwick</a>. As a result of this meeting, the Board of Health appointed James Smith from Scotland as an inspector, and commissioned him to produce a further report on Lancaster's problems.<a href="#fn159" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref159"><sup>159</sup></a> Smith's investigation took place in January 1849,<a href="#fn160" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref160"><sup>160</sup></a> and his report was received in July.<a href="#fn161" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref161"><sup>161</sup></a> In his conclusions, Smith noted that Lancaster was favourably situated to provide a healthy environment for its inhabitants, and that this could be achieved by &quot;a complete and constant supply of pure and soft water, and ... a thorough system of drainage and sewerage&quot;.<a href="#fn162" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref162"><sup>162</sup></a> Subsequently, an Act of Parliament gave approval for these measures to be carried out,<a href="#fn163" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref163"><sup>163</sup></a> and in 1852 royal assent was given for the waterworks to be constructed.<a href="#fn164" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref164"><sup>164</sup></a> Delays, disputes and controversies continued,<a href="#fn165" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref165"><sup>165</sup></a> until the waterworks was eventually opened in 1855, when work on the drainage and sewage systems was already under way. This enabled underground pipes for the two systems to be laid simultaneously.<a href="#fn166" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref166"><sup>166</sup></a> Sharpe had played a significant part in arranging <a href="Queen_Victoria" title="wikilink">Queen Victoria</a>'s visit to Lancaster in October 1851, and with Paley designed four triumphal arches for the occasion. He also took part in the proceedings on the day, escorting the Queen, <a href="Albert,_Prince_Consort" title="wikilink">Prince Albert</a>, and the Prince of Wales (the future <a href="Edward_VII" title="wikilink">King Edward VII</a>) to the top of the castle tower.<a href="#fn167" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref167"><sup>167</sup></a></p>

<p>When Sharpe moved his family from Lancaster to live in North Wales in early 1856 he was aged 47. The seven years he spent there were later described, in a <em>Memoir</em> published in 1882 by the Architectural Association, as &quot;perhaps the happiest years of his life&quot;.<a href="#fn174" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref174"><sup>174</sup></a> The family initially lived in a semi-detached house called <em>Bron Haul</em> near Betws-y-Coed, on what is now the <a href="A5_road_(Great_Britain)" title="wikilink">A5 road</a>.

<p>Throughout his life, Sharpe took an interest in sport, both as an active participant and also as an organiser. At Cambridge, he was a member of the <a href="Lady_Margaret_Boat_Club" title="wikilink">Lady Margaret Boat Club</a>, and <a href="Coxswain_(rowing)" title="wikilink">coxed</a> the college boat.<a href="#fn184" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref184"><sup>184</sup></a> Back in Lancaster, he took up archery, joined the John O'Gaunt Bowmen, played cricket and coxed. In June 1841 he helped to found the Lancaster Lunesdale Cricket Club and the <a href="Lancaster_Rowing_Club" title="wikilink">Lancaster Rowing Club</a>.<a href="#fn185" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref185"><sup>185</sup></a><a href="#fn186" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref186"><sup>186</sup></a> Sharpe was also an accomplished musician, and a member of the committee that organised the Lancaster Choral Society's first concert in September 1836. The society thrived for a number of years, and for a time Sharpe was its conductor.<a href="#fn187" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref187"><sup>187</sup></a> By the beginning of 1837 he was a member of the Lancaster Literary, Scientific, and Natural History Society, giving a number of talks to the society, and eventually becoming a committee member. That same year he became the secretary and treasurer of the Lancaster Institution for the Encouragement of the Fine Arts, and in April 1840 he joined the committee of Lancaster's Protestant Association.<a href="#fn188" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref188"><sup>188</sup></a> In 1842 he was part of a committee promoting congregational singing, and he gave an illustrated series of lectures on its history and merits.<a href="#fn189" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref189"><sup>189</sup></a> His love of music continued throughout his life, and included training choirs, composing hymn tunes, and manufacturing musical instruments similar to small <a href="harmonium" title="wikilink">harmoniums</a>.<a href="#fn190" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref190"><sup>190</sup></a><a href="#fn191" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref191"><sup>191</sup></a></p>
<p>In early 1843 Sharpe bought Lancaster's Theatre Royal (now the <a href="Grand_Theatre,_Lancaster" title="wikilink">Grand Theatre</a>), the third-oldest extant provincial theatre in Britain, which had opened in 1782. He spent &lt;U+00A3&gt;680 (&lt;U+00A3&gt; as of ) on converting it into the Music Hall and Museum. It was the only place in Lancaster, other than the churches, able to accommodate 400 or more people, and so was used for a variety of purposes, including concerts, lectures, and religious meetings.<a href="#fn192" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref192"><sup>192</sup></a> In 1848 Sharpe founded the Lancaster Athenaeum, a private society for &quot;the promotion of public entertainment and instruction&quot;,<a href="#fn193" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref193"><sup>193</sup></a> to which end it organised lectures on literary and scientific subjects, concerts and exhibitions. It held its meetings in the Music Hall, which was at one period renamed the Athenaeum.<a href="#fn194" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref194"><sup>194</sup></a> In 1852 Sharpe became the proprietor of the Phoenix Foundry on Germany Street, which among other things supplied <a href="cast_iron" title="wikilink">cast iron</a> pipes for the Lancaster waterworks, sewers and drains, and shells for the <a href="Crimean_War" title="wikilink">Crimean War</a>.<a href="#fn195" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref195"><sup>195</sup></a><a href="#fn196" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref196"><sup>196</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="appraisal">Appraisal</h2>
<p>Hughes considers that Sharpe was never in the &quot;first division&quot; of 19th-century church architects; his designs were &quot;basic, workmanlike, and occasionally imaginative, though hardly inspiring&quot;.<a href="#fn197" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref197"><sup>197</sup></a> There is no such thing as a &quot;typical&quot; church designed by Sharpe. He was an innovator and experimenter, and throughout his life a student of architecture. The architectural styles he used started with the Romanesque, passed through &quot;pre-archaeological&quot; Gothic to &quot;correct&quot; Gothic, and then back to Romanesque for his last church. The sizes of the churches varied, from the small simple chapels at Cowgill and Howgill to the large and splendid church of Holy Trinity, Blackburn. During Sharpe's earlier years in practice, between 1838 and 1842, Britain was going through a period of severe <a href="Recession" title="wikilink">economic recession</a>, which may have been why he designed many of his churches to be built as cheaply as possible.<a href="#fn198" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref198"><sup>198</sup></a></p>
<p>As an architectural historian, Hughes considers Sharpe to be &quot;in the top rank&quot;.<a href="#fn199" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref199"><sup>199</sup></a> His drawings of authentic Gothic buildings were still in use a century after his death.<a href="#fn200" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref200"><sup>200</sup></a> The architectural historian James Price states that Sharpe was &quot;considered the greatest authority on Cistercian Abbeys in England&quot;.<a href="#fn201" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref201"><sup>201</sup></a> Some writers have regarded Sharpe as an early pioneer of the <a href="Gothic_Revival_architecture" title="wikilink">Gothic Revival</a>, although in Hughes' opinion this is &quot;probably more for his books than for his buildings&quot;.<a href="#fn202" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref202"><sup>202</sup></a> In 1897, 20 years after his death, Sharpe was considered to be sufficiently notable to merit an entry in the <em><a href="Dictionary_of_National_Biography" title="wikilink">Dictionary of National Biography</a></em>.

<p>A Worts Travelling Bachelorship (now known as a Worts Travelling Scholars Fund) is the result of a bequest by Wiliam Worts, who died in 1709.<a href="#fn209" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref209"><sup>209</sup></a> It makes grants &quot;for the promotion or encouragement of investigations in countries outside Great Britain respecting the religion, learning, law, politics, customs, manner and rarities, natural or artificial, of those countries, or for purposes of geographical discovery or of antiquarian or scientific research in such countries&quot;.<a href="#fn210" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref210"><sup>210</sup></a><br />
A further Commissioners' church was later designed in conjunction with Paley, <a href="St_Saviour&#39;s_Church,_Ringley" title="wikilink">St Saviour, Ringley</a> (1850&lt;U+2013&gt;54).<a href="#fn211" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref211"><sup>211</sup></a><br />
Holy Trinity is now <a href="redundant_church" title="wikilink">redundant</a> and is in the care of the <a href="Churches_Conservation_Trust" title="wikilink">Churches Conservation Trust</a>, the only one of Sharpe's churches to be so preserved.<a href="#fn212" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref212"><sup>212</sup></a><br />
Unfortunately the spire was not as durable as the rest of the church. By 1936 it had become unsafe, and was dismantled. In 1966 the lantern and bell-tower were also demolished.<a href="#fn213" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref213"><sup>213</sup></a><br />
The tower was not completed until 1850. It was built from terracotta of inferior quality, and was later found to be unsafe, having to be rebuilt in 1912.<a href="#fn214" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref214"><sup>214</sup></a><br />
The two older boys were educated at <a href="Rossall_School" title="wikilink">Rossall School</a>, and Alfred at <a href="Haileybury_and_Imperial_Service_College" title="wikilink">Haileybury College</a>. Francis became the proprietor of the Phoenix Foundry, while Edmund (junior) joined the textile-coating firm of Storey Brothers, Lancaster, and later became <a href="Lord_of_the_Manor" title="wikilink">Lord of the Manor</a> of <a href="Halton-with-Aughton" title="wikilink">Halton</a>. <a href="Alfred_Sharpe" title="wikilink">Alfred</a> had a career as a big-game hunter in Central Africa, then as a colonial civil servant, being knighted in 1897, and later becoming the first Governor of <a href="Nyasaland" class="uri" title="wikilink">Nyasaland</a> (now <a href="Malawi" class="uri" title="wikilink">Malawi</a>). The girls did not marry, living together in <a href="Ambleside" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ambleside</a> and later moving back to Lancaster.<a href="#fn215" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref215"><sup>215</sup></a><br />
An example of this is given in , which states &quot;Mr Sharpe (d. 1877) was one of the earliest, ablest and most zealous pioneers of the English Gothic revival&quot;.<a href="#fn216" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref216"><sup>216</sup></a></p>
