<p><strong>Robert Vavasour Ferguson</strong> (<a href="January_31" title="wikilink">January 31</a> <a href="1845" class="uri" title="wikilink">1845</a> &lt;U+2013&gt; <a href="May_3" title="wikilink">May 3</a> <a href="1894" class="uri" title="wikilink">1894</a>), nicknamed &quot;Death to Flying Things,&quot;<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> was an <a href="United_States" title="wikilink">American</a> <a href="infielder" class="uri" title="wikilink">infielder</a>, league official, <a href="manager_(baseball)" title="wikilink">manager</a> and <a href="umpire_(baseball)" title="wikilink">umpire</a> in the early days of <a href="baseball" class="uri" title="wikilink">baseball</a>, playing both before and after baseball became professional.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> From  through , he served as president of the <a href="National_Association_of_Professional_Base_Ball_Players" title="wikilink">National Association of Professional Base Ball Players</a>, the sport's first completely professional league, in addition to playing and managing. His character and unquestioned honesty was looked up to and was sorely needed during a period in baseball history where the games reputation was badly damaged by gamblers and rowdy behavior by players and fans, and it served him well during his long career. But on the other side of his personality, his bad temper, and stubbornness were traits that caused him to be disliked, and even caused him trouble at times.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> His nickname was derived from his greatness as a defensive player.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="early-career">Early career</h2>
<p>A native of <a href="Brooklyn" class="uri" title="wikilink">Brooklyn</a>, <a href="New_York" title="wikilink">New York</a>, Ferguson played for two of New York's most fabled semi-professional clubs in the late 1860s and early 1870s: the <a href="New_York_Mutuals" title="wikilink">New York Mutuals</a> and the <a href="Brooklyn_Atlantics" title="wikilink">Brooklyn Atlantics</a>.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> Bob drove in the tying run and later scored the winning run in that famous game, bringing to an end the fabled <a href="Cincinnati_Red_Stockings" title="wikilink">Cincinnati Red Stockings</a>' 81 consecutive game winning streak on <a href="June_14" title="wikilink">June 14</a>, .<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> He is credited with being the first known batter to <a href="switch_hitter" title="wikilink">switch-hit</a>, but the practice did not take off at first. One possible reason raised was that nobody wanted to be like Ferguson. But soon, the advantage that switch-hitting posed in situational hitting, and platooning ballplayers, took hold on baseball philosophy, and many other players began doing the same.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="national-association">National Association</h2>
<p>In <a href="1871" class="uri" title="wikilink">1871</a>, he took over the Mutual team as the <a href="player-manager" class="uri" title="wikilink">player-manager</a>, as he would always manage every team in which he played. In 33 games, he batted .241, and the team finished with a 16-17 record, which put them in 5th place at the season's end.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> As manager, Ferguson insisted upon implicit obedience from his men, but was forced to leave following the season due to heavy rumors of gambling surrounding the team.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> For the  season, Bob re-joined his Atlantics team, now a member of the National Association, and he would stay there through the  season.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> Also in 1872, he elected as the president of the National Association, an office he held through the  season, which was also the end of the Association.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<p>On <a href="September_1" title="wikilink">September 1</a>, 1872, Ferguson arranged a benefit game for <a href="Albert_Thake" title="wikilink">Albert Thake</a>, a 22-year-old <a href="left_fielder" title="wikilink">left fielder</a> for the Atlantics, who drowned during a fishing trip off <a href="Fort_Hamilton" title="wikilink">Fort Hamilton</a>, in <a href="New_York_Harbor" title="wikilink">New York Harbor</a>. The old Brooklyn Atlantics and Members of the 1869 Cincinnati Red Stockings played against each other in the benefit game.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<p>On <a href="July_24" title="wikilink">July 24</a>, , Ferguson was serving as a substitute umpire when, during a game between the <a href="Baltimore_Canaries" title="wikilink">Baltimore Canaries</a> and Mutuals, he was recieving loud, verbal abuse throughout the game by notorious umpire-baiter, Mutuals catcher <a href="Nat_Hicks" title="wikilink">Nat Hicks</a>. Ferguson and Hicks got into an altercation at the conclusion of the game, which concluded with Ferguson hitting Hicks in the left arm with a bat, and had to have a police escort to leave the playing field. Although Hicks ended up with a broken arm in two places and would not play for two months, he refused to press charges and the two reconciled after the game.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> During the final season of the Association, he played and managed the <a href="Hartford_Dark_Blues" title="wikilink">Hartford Dark Blues</a>.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="national-league">National League</h2>
<p>When the Association disolved, his Hartford team moved over to the <a href="National_League" title="wikilink">National League</a> for it's inaugural season in ,<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> and Ferguson became a League Director. As a league official, he was involved in a landmark decision that season. The case involved <a href="Jim_Devlin" title="wikilink">Jim Devlin</a>, <a href="pitcher" class="uri" title="wikilink">pitcher</a> for the <a href="Louisville_Grays" title="wikilink">Louisville Grays</a>. Devlin wanted to be released from his contract, claiming that Louisville had failed to fulfill the terms of his contract. Surrounding Devlin were rumors that he took money from gamblers to throw games, known in the day as &quot;hippodroming.&quot; Ferguson, along with fellow league directors, ruled in favor of the Gray's Vice-President Charles Chase. Devlin was ordered to remain with the Grays. The following season, Devlin and three other teammates, SS/2B <a href="Bill_Craver" title="wikilink">Bill Craver</a>, OF <a href="George_Hall" title="wikilink">George Hall</a> and 3B <a href="Al_Nichols" title="wikilink">Al Nichols</a> would receive life suspensions for throwing games. Devlin attempted to gain reinstatement for a number of years, but this was never granted.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
<p>The Dark Blues had turned to Ferguson to play and manage the team because of his reputation as the most authoritarian captain in the game. He was an honest and up-standing citizen in a time when not many ballplayers could say the same. However, he was also a domineering, dictatorial captain with a violent streak. Team discipline did improve in his first season, but his overbearing ways proved divisive, causeing the team bicker amongst themselves. Ferguson's temper would flair up often, even when the team was winning. The Chicago Tribune reported, if anyone on the Hartford nine committed an error, &lt;U+201C&gt;Ferguson [would] swear until everything looks blue.&lt;U+201D&gt; He was particularly rough on second baseman <a href="Jack_Burdock" title="wikilink">Jack Burdock</a>, who on more than one occasion heard his captain publicly threaten &lt;U+201C&gt;to ram his fist down Burdock&lt;U+2019&gt;s throat.&lt;U+201D&gt; Some players tolerated his behavior, others however, refused to comply. <a href="Shortstop" class="uri" title="wikilink">Shortstop</a> <a href="Tom_Carey_(19th_century_baseball)" title="wikilink">Tom Carey</a> and <a href="center_fielder" title="wikilink">center fielder</a> <a href="Jack_Remsen" title="wikilink">Jack Remsen</a> did not hesitate to yell back, while Burdock and pitcher <a href="Candy_Cummings" title="wikilink">Candy Cummings</a>, on the other hand, often sulked.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> The situation in Hartford came to head on one occasion. Hartford's main pitcher, <a href="Tommy_Bond" title="wikilink">Tommy Bond</a>, after a tough loss to the Red Stockings, a game in which Ferguson had commited several errors, he suggested that Ferguson was &quot;crooked&quot;. A claim that was denied by Ferguson, and Bond quickly retracted his statement, saying that he said it in anger. Bond then requested that he be able to leave the team because he could not play for Ferguson, a request that was granted by league president and former owner of the Drak Blues, <a href="Morgan_Bulkeley" title="wikilink">Morgan Bulkeley</a>.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
<p>His Hartford team finished third in its two seasons in the National League, and when the team folded, he became the new <a href="Chicago_Cubs" title="wikilink">Chicago White Stockings</a> player-manager. It would be his only season in Chicago.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> <a href="Al_Spalding" title="wikilink">Al Spalding</a> had hired Ferguson to captain his Chicago team because of his reputation, openly said he admired Ferguson's style and leadership that made the Hartford teams successful. Ferguson personally had his most successful season as a player. He <a href="batting_average" title="wikilink">hit</a> .351, which was third in the league, led the league in <a href="on-base_percentage" title="wikilink">on-base percentage</a>, tied for fourth in <a href="run_batted_in" title="wikilink">RBIs</a>, and ranked fourth in <a href="hit_(baseball)" title="wikilink">hits</a>. Unfortunately, the White Stockings finished at .500, and in Spalding's memoirs he called Ferguson &quot;tactless&quot; and hopelessly lacking any knowledge &quot;of the subtle science of handling men by strategy rather than by force.&quot;<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> <a href="Cap_Anson" title="wikilink">Cap Anson</a> would eventually take over that role in .<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a></p>
<p>Bob again moved on, this time taking usual role with the new <a href="Troy_Trojans_(MLB_team)" title="wikilink">Troy Trojans</a> who began their time in the Majors in <a href="1879" class="uri" title="wikilink">1879</a>, and would stay in the role until the team folded after the  season. In , he became the first manager in the history of the <a href="Philadelphia_Phillies" title="wikilink">Philadelphia Phillies</a> franchise, which was known at the time as the Quakers, but was relieved of command when the team won only four of its first 17 games.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> On <a href="August_21" title="wikilink">August 21</a>, his Quakers traveled to <a href="Providence,_Rhode_Island" title="wikilink">Providence, Rhode Island</a> to play the Grays. To increase ticket sales, he gave the days' pitching duty to <a href="Rhode_Island" title="wikilink">Rhode Island</a> native <a href="Art_Hagen" title="wikilink">Art Hagen</a> in hopes that Hagen's appearance would attract more locals to come watch the game. The stategy worked, but Hagen surrendered 28 <a href="run_(baseball)" title="wikilink">runs</a> and the Quakers made 20 <a href="error_(baseball)" title="wikilink">errors</a> behind him and didn't score a run. Financially sound decision as it was, a bad decision for public relations as Ferguson was labeled a sadist for not relieving Hagen.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="american-association">American Association</h2>
<p>Ferguson's last two managerial position were in the still new upstart Major League, the <a href="American_Association_(19th_century)" title="wikilink">American Association</a>, when he was player-manager for the <a href="Pittsburgh_Pirates" title="wikilink">Pittsburgh Alleganys</a> in , and then just in the manager role for parts of two seasons with the <a href="New_York_Metropolitans" title="wikilink">New York Metropolitans</a>. Overall, as manager, his teams won 417 games and lost 516, for a winning percentage of .447, but never finished higher than the third place finishes his Trojans did acheived. The totals reflect his time in National Association, as well as the National League and American Association.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="umpire-career">Umpire career</h2>
<p>He had on numerous occasions, during his playing and managerial career, serve as a substitute umpire, but didn't start doing it full time until after his departure from Philadelphia. In , he became a full-time umpire, umpiring in the American Association, and the <a href="Players_League" title="wikilink">Players League</a>.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> By the end of the  season he had passed <a href="Kick_Kelly" title="wikilink">Kick Kelly</a> to take over the record for career games as an umpire with 650; <a href="John_Gaffney" title="wikilink">John Gaffney</a> surpassed his final total of 786 in . Bob officially umpired 804 games if his National Association games are taken into account, and his career came to a close after the  season.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> His philosophy on umpiring was easy, &quot;Umpiring always came as easy to me,&quot; he said, &quot;as sleeping on a featherbed. Never change a decision, never stop to talk to a man. Make 'em play ball and keep their mouths shut, and never fear but the people will be on your side and you'll be called the king of umpires.&quot;<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="post-career">Post-career</h2>
<p>Ferguson died in Brooklyn of <a href="apoplexy" class="uri" title="wikilink">apoplexy</a> at the age of 49.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> Initially buried in <a href="Cemetery_of_the_Evergreens,_Brooklyn" title="wikilink">Evergreen Cemetery</a>, he was later reinterred in <a href="Cypress_Hills_Cemetery,_Brooklyn" title="wikilink">Cypress Hills Cemetery</a>, also in the burrough of Brooklyn.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> Depsite his career that filled with incidents of turmoil between him and his players, and other baseball people, his funeral was described as so crowded as the hall was full, so was the front stoop, and they even had to turn people away.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a></p>
