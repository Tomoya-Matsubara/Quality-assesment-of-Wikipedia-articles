<p><strong>Hurricane Bret</strong> was the first of five Category 4 hurricanes that developed during the <a href="1999_Atlantic_hurricane_season" title="wikilink">1999 Atlantic hurricane season</a> and the first <a href="tropical_cyclone" title="wikilink">tropical cyclone</a> since <a href="Hurricane_Jerry_(1989)" title="wikilink">Hurricane Jerry in 1989</a> to make landfall in Texas at hurricane intensity. Forming from a <a href="tropical_wave" title="wikilink">tropical wave</a> on August 18, Bret slowly organized within weak steering currents in the <a href="Bay_of_Campeche" title="wikilink">Bay of Campeche</a>. By August 20, the storm began to track northward and underwent <a href="Rapid_deepening" title="wikilink">rapid intensification</a> on August 21. After this period of strengthening, Bret attained its peak intensity with winds of 145 mph (230 km/h) and a <a href="barometric_pressure" title="wikilink">barometric pressure</a> of 944 mbar (hPa; 27.88 inHg). Later that day, the storm weakened to a Category 3 hurricane and made <a href="landfall_(meteorology)" title="wikilink">landfall</a> on <a href="Padre_Island" title="wikilink">Padre Island</a>, Texas. Shortly thereafter, the storm weakened further, becoming a tropical depression 24 hours after moving inland. The remnants of the storm eventually dissipated early on August 26 over northern Mexico.</p>
<p>Along the Texas coastline, Bret threatened several cities, prompting 180,000 residents to evacuate. Numerous shelters were opened throughout the region and prisons were evacuated. Several days prior to the storm's arrival, the NHC issued <a href="tropical_cyclone_warnings_and_watches" title="wikilink">hurricane watches</a>, and later warnings for areas near the Texas&lt;U+2013&gt;Mexico border. Several major roads leading to barrier island towns were shut down to prevent residents from crossing bridges during the hurricane. In nearby Mexico, roughly 7,000 people left coastal areas in advance of the storm. Officials also set up hundreds of shelters in northern regions of the country in case of major flooding.</p>
<p>Bret made landfall in a sparsely populated region, resulting in relatively little damage in comparison to its intensity. Nevertheless, seven people were killed in relation to storm, four in Texas and three in Mexico. Most of the deaths were due to car accidents caused by slippery roads. Upon making landfall, the hurricane produced a maximum <a href="storm_surge" title="wikilink">storm surge</a> of  at <a href="Matagorda_Island" title="wikilink">Matagorda Island</a>, Texas. Heavy rains produced by Bret peaked at  in Texas and were estimated over  in Mexico. Numerous homes in the affected regions were damaged or destroyed, leaving roughly 150 people homeless. In all, the storm caused $15 million (1999 USD; $19.7 million 2009 USD) in damage.</p>

The wave tracked generally westward, interacting with an upper-level low on August 15 in the western <a href="Caribbean_Sea" title="wikilink">Caribbean Sea</a>, and spawned a <a href="low_pressure_area" title="wikilink">low pressure area</a>. <a href="Atmospheric_convection" title="wikilink">Convective activity</a> developed around the low, and by August 18 the system was over the <a href="Yucat&lt;U+00E1&gt;n_Peninsula" title="wikilink">Yucat&lt;U+00E1&gt;n Peninsula</a>.

At around the same time, Bret established a north-northwest track under the influences of a mid-level <a href="Ridge_(meteorology)" title="wikilink">ridge</a>.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> The following day, Bret began to undergo <a href="Rapid_deepening" title="wikilink">rapid intensification</a>,<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> as a well-defined <a href="eye_(cyclone)" title="wikilink">eye</a> developed.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> On the morning of August 22, the storm attained its peak intensity as a Category 4 hurricane with winds of 145 mph (230 km/h) and a <a href="barometric_pressure" title="wikilink">barometric pressure</a> of 944 mbar (hPa; 27.88 inHg).<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> Shortly thereafter, an upper-level <a href="Trough_(meteorology)" title="wikilink">trough</a> to the west of the storm began to erode its cloud pattern.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<p>Late on August 22, Bret turned northwestward in response to a mid-tropospheric ridge over the Gulf of Mexico and a mid-tropospheric circulation over the <a href="Rio_Grande_Valley" title="wikilink">Rio Grande Valley</a>.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> Several hours before landfall, the hurricane weakened to Category 3 intensity and its forward motion slowed.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> At around 7:00 pm CDT (0000 UTC; August 23), Hurricane Bret passed over <a href="Padre_Island,_Texas" title="wikilink">Padre Island, Texas</a>, with winds of 115 mph (185 km/h) and a barometric pressure of 951 mbar (hPa; 28.08 inHg), which marked its landfall.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> The hurricane rapidly weakened upon moving inland, and roughly 12 hours after landfall, Bret weakened to a tropical storm. It further degenerated into a tropical depression by the evening of August 23. The remnants of Bret persisted until August 26, at which time they dissipated over the mountains of northern Mexico.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>

Most of the cars are on the right side of the road; however, at least two cars on on the left side." width="280" /> On August 21, when Bret was first expected to approach the Texas coastline, the NHC issued a <a href="hurricane_watch" title="wikilink">hurricane watch</a> for coastal areas between the border of Mexico and <a href="Baffin_Bay,_Texas" title="wikilink">Baffin Bay, Texas</a>. Hours later, the watch was upgraded to a warning as the storm intensified and posed a more direct threat to the area. A tropical storm warning and hurricane watch were subsequently posted from Baffin Bay northward to <a href="Port_Aransas,_Texas" title="wikilink">Port Aransas</a>. The following day, the hurricane warning was extended to include locations through <a href="Port_O&#39;Connor,_Texas" title="wikilink">Port O'Connor</a> and the advisories were extended to <a href="Freeport,_Texas" title="wikilink">Freeport</a>. As Bret neared landfall, the hurricane watch between Port O'Connor and Freeport was discontinued. The hurricane warning for Port Aransas to Port O'Connor was discontinued hours after Bret made landfall and began to weaken. By late August 23, all watches and warnings in relation to the hurricane were discontinued.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
<p>By August 22, city officials in <a href="Corpus_Christi,_Texas" title="wikilink">Corpus Christi, Texas</a> declared a state of emergency as Bret was considered a significant threat to the region. Tens of thousands of residents were urged to evacuate coastal areas and seek refuge in local shelters or with relatives further inland.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> An estimated 180,000 people in the state left their residences ahead of the storm.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> The <a href="Corpus_Christi_International_Airport" title="wikilink">Corpus Christi International Airport</a> closed midday on August 22.

<p>Eleven shelters were opened in the <a href="San_Antonio,_Texas" title="wikilink">San Antonio</a> area, collectively able to accommodate 3,525 people. About 325 prisoners were evacuated from a <a href="Nueces_County,_Texas" title="wikilink">Nueces County</a> jail as the building they were in was deemed unsafe during hurricane conditions. About 1,000 sailors working in the area were evacuated to the <em><a href="USS_Inchon" title="wikilink">USS Inchon</a></em> prior to the storm. Originally, the ship was meant to ride out the storm at sea; however, inadequate repair work inhibited the ship from leaving port. The ship reportedly had enough supplies to maintain the sailors for roughly 45 days. By 12:00 pm CDT on August 22, <a href="Mustang_Island" title="wikilink">Mustang Island</a> and <a href="Padre_Island" title="wikilink">Padre Island</a> were completely evacuated and officials shut down roads leading in and out of the islands to prevent anyone from re-entering them before the area was deemed safe to enter. A strict order against <a href="price_gouging" title="wikilink">price gouging</a> was put in place by city officials in Corpus Christi.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a></p>
