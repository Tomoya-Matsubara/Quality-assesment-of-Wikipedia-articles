<p><strong><em>Old Glory</em></strong> (<a href="1939_in_film" title="wikilink">1939</a>) is a <em><a href="Merrie_Melodies" title="wikilink">Merrie Melodies</a></em> <a href="animation" title="wikilink">animated</a> cartoon directed by <a href="Chuck_Jones" title="wikilink">Chuck Jones</a>, produced by <a href="Warner_Bros._Cartoons" title="wikilink">Leon Schlesinger Productions</a>, and released to theatres by <a href="Warner_Bros." title="wikilink">Warner Bros. Pictures</a> and <a href="Vitaphone" title="wikilink">The Vitaphone Corporation</a>. It premiered at the famed <a href="Carthay_Circle" title="wikilink">Carthay Circle</a> Theater at Los Angeles on July 1, 1939 - three days before <a href="Independence_Day_(United_States)" title="wikilink">Independence Day</a>.</p>
<h2 id="plot">Plot</h2>
<p>The uniquely serious Schlesinger-produced cartoon retells the origins of the <a href="United_States" title="wikilink">United States of America</a>. <a href="Porky_Pig" title="wikilink">Porky Pig</a> plays a child forced to learn the <a href="Pledge_of_Allegiance" title="wikilink">Pledge of Allegiance</a>. He becomes quickly bored and falls asleep. In his dream, <a href="Uncle_Sam" title="wikilink">Uncle Sam</a> (voiced by John Deering <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0214385/">1</a>) comes to life and teaches Porky about history from <a href="Colonial_America" title="wikilink">Colonial America</a> through the <a href="Battles_of_Lexington_and_Concord" title="wikilink">midnight ride</a> of <a href="Paul_Revere" title="wikilink">Paul Revere</a> (voiced by <a href="Daws_Butler" title="wikilink">Daws Butler</a>) and the <a href="American_Revolutionary_War" title="wikilink">American Revolutionary War</a> to the expansion of the <a href="American_Old_West" title="wikilink">American Old West</a>, briefly alluding to <a href="Abraham_Lincoln" title="wikilink">Abraham Lincoln</a>. Upon awakening, Porky snaps into a <a href="salute" class="uri" title="wikilink">salute</a> and recites the pledge as the <a href="Flag_of_the_United_States" title="wikilink">Flag of the United States</a> waves overhead and the words &quot;The End&quot; pan over the waving flag. There are no <a href="Merrie_Melodies" title="wikilink">Merrie Melodies</a> rings at the end, as in other shorts, or the words &quot;That's All, Folks!&quot; (The <a href="Flag_of_the_United_States" title="wikilink">Flag of the United States</a> has only 48 stars, as this short was made before <a href="Hawaii" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hawaii</a> and <a href="Alaska" class="uri" title="wikilink">Alaska</a> were admitted to the Union. Also, this Pledge of Allegiance as recited by Porky does not yet include the phrase &quot;under <a href="God" class="uri" title="wikilink">God</a>&quot;. That phrase was not added until 1954).</p>
<h2 id="analysis">Analysis</h2>
<p>The animation in <em>Old Glory</em> is realistic and heavily <a href="rotoscope" title="wikilink">rotoscoped</a>, different from the usual Warner Bros. style. Director Chuck Jones was known for his <a href="The_Walt_Disney_Company" title="wikilink">Disney</a>-like style during this period, and Schlesinger assigned him to make this cartoon for that reason. The scene with <a href="Patrick_Henry" title="wikilink">Patrick Henry</a> (voiced by <a href="John_Litel" title="wikilink">John Litel</a>) saying his &quot;<a href="Give_me_Liberty,_or_give_me_Death!" title="wikilink">Give Me Liberty</a>&quot; speech was rotoscoped from the Warner Bros. color 2-reel historical short, <em>Give Me Liberty</em>. That short won the <a href="Academy_Awards" title="wikilink">Academy Award</a> for <a href="Academy_Award_for_Live_Action_Short_Film" title="wikilink">Best Short Subject - Color</a> of 1936.</p>
<p>The original ending was cut when the cartoon was reissued twice as a Blue Ribbon Merrie Melody once on August 25, 1945 during the 1944-45 season (evident from the style opening rings used: orange rings with a black background) and again on September 12, 1953 during the 1953-54 season (evident from the style opening rings used: orange rings with a blue background). A version with a restored ending can be found on the <em><a href="Looney_Tunes_Golden_Collection:_Volume_2" title="wikilink">Looney Tunes Golden Collection Vol. 2</a></em>, Disc 3. This copy retains the Blue Ribbon opening, but also the original opening shot of the flag and its music cue.</p>
<p><em>Old Glory</em> is Jones's first short to feature Porky Pig. It is also Porky's first appearance in a color Merrie Melody since his debut in 1935's <a href="I_Haven&#39;t_Got_a_Hat" title="wikilink">I Haven't Got a Hat</a>, and his first short in three-strip Technicolor.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>During the late 1960s, <em>Old Glory</em> was regularly screened between <a href="rock_music" title="wikilink">rock</a> acts at <a href="the_Fillmore" title="wikilink">the Fillmore</a> in <a href="San_Francisco" title="wikilink">San Francisco</a>. Many of the Fillmore's patrons drew great amusement from a pig (or <a href="police_officer" title="wikilink">&quot;cop&quot;</a> in 1960s slang) saluting the American flag.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
