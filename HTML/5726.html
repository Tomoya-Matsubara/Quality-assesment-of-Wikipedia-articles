Dan has decided to have <a href="sex_reassignment_surgery" title="wikilink">sex reassignment surgery</a> to become a woman, and Quagmire must adjust to his father's decision.

<h2 id="plot">Plot</h2>
<p><a href="Joe_Swanson" title="wikilink">Joe</a> and <a href="Peter_Griffin" title="wikilink">Peter</a> visit <a href="Glenn_Quagmire" title="wikilink">Quagmire</a> and are introduced to his father, Lieutenant Commander Dan Quagmire. Expecting to see the inspiration for Quagmire's wanton sexual behavior, they are surprised by Dan's <a href="LGBT_stereotypes#Male_homosexuality" title="wikilink">stereotypically gay mannerisms</a> and begin texting each other that Quagmire's father is likely <a href="gay" class="uri" title="wikilink">gay</a>. The following morning, Quagmire invites Peter and <a href="Lois_Griffin" title="wikilink">Lois</a> to the Naval Ball being held to honor his father, but soon begins arguing with Peter about his father's sexuality. At the ball that night, members of the Navy bombard Quagmire with compliments about his war-hero father, all of which can be taken as <a href="double_entendres" title="wikilink">double entendres</a> about his Dad's alleged <a href="non-heterosexual" title="wikilink">non-heterosexuality</a>. Concerned that Dan may be gay, Quagmire confronts him. Dan states that he is instead a &quot;<a href="Transsexualism" title="wikilink">woman trapped in a man's body</a>&quot; and has scheduled <a href="sex_reassignment_surgery" title="wikilink">sex reassignment surgery</a>, to take place during his stay in Quahog (this admission seems to disturb Quagmire even more than the idea that his father might have been gay). At Lois's suggestion, Peter waits with Quagmire during his father's operation. The surgery is a success, with Dan emerging as Ida, an attractive blond woman. That night, Ida and Quagmire join the Griffins for dinner. As the dinner begins, however, Quagmire becomes frustrated when the conversation turns towards Ida's surgery and new life, and storms out of the room. At Quagmire's home, Quagmire tells his father that he is not sure he can deal with his father's sex reassignment. Saddened, Ida leaves Quagmire's home and decides to stay at a nearby hotel.</p>
<p><a href="Brian_Griffin" title="wikilink">Brian</a>, who has been out of town attending a seminar on creating a web series, is unaware of what has transpired. On his way home, Brian stops at a hotel bar where he meets Ida. Quickly bonding, they retire to Ida's room for sex. The next morning, Brian shares his newfound love with Peter and Lois before showing them a picture of Ida on his cellphone. Peter and Lois go into hysterics, while Brian, unaware of Ida's operation, believes they are just jealous. After <a href="Stewie_Griffin" title="wikilink">Stewie</a> tells him about Dan Quagmire's sex change, Brian realizes Ida used to be a man and vomits profusely. Meanwhile, returning to Quagmire's home, Ida apologizes to him, and Quagmire returns the favor, reconciling their relationship. Ida tells Quagmire that she has met someone. When Quagmire learns who it is, he screams in rage. Back at the Griffin house, a traumatized Brian showers compulsively. Quagmire rushes over, finds Brian, and beats him severely before ordering him to stay away from his house. As Quagmire leaves, Brian retaliates by saying, &quot;I fucked your dad&quot; before slamming the front door.</p>

<h2 id="reception">Reception</h2>
<p>In a slight decrease from the previous week, the episode was viewed in 7.22 million homes in its original airing, despite airing simultaneously with <em><a href="Desperate_Housewives" title="wikilink">Desperate Housewives</a></em> on <a href="American_Broadcasting_Corporation" title="wikilink">ABC</a>, <em><a href="The_Apprentice_(U.S._season_9)" title="wikilink">Celebrity Apprentice</a></em> on <a href="NBC" class="uri" title="wikilink">NBC</a>, and the television film <em><a href="Jesse_Stone:_No_Remorse" title="wikilink">Jesse Stone: No Remorse</a></em> on <a href="CBS" class="uri" title="wikilink">CBS</a>.

<p>Reviews of the episode were mostly positive. Ramsey Isler of <a href="IGN" class="uri" title="wikilink">IGN</a> noted his enjoyment of Dan Quagmire's character traits: &quot;I'll give the writing team credit for this little plot twist, as I'm sure we were all expecting the elder Quagmire to be even more of a womanizer than his son.&quot;<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> Regarding the episode's treatment of <a href="LGBT" class="uri" title="wikilink">LGBT</a> issues, Jason Hughes of <a href="Weblogs,_Inc.#TV_Squad" title="wikilink">TV Squad</a> stated, &quot;there's a gold mine of material to dig into for satire and comedy; comedy which will likely offend as many people as the real issues do.&quot;<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> Todd VanDerWerff of <a href="The_A.V._Club" title="wikilink">The A.V. Club</a> called the scenes between Quagmire and his father &quot;surprisingly well-done&quot; while noting, &quot;the scenes where the mockery seemed a little too mean-spirited were definitely out of the show's worst sections of its toolkit&quot;.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<p>The episode was criticized for its portrayal of <a href="transgenderism" class="uri" title="wikilink">transgenderism</a>, particularly regarding the way Ida was treated by other characters.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> Food Ida prepared for the dinner party at the Griffin house was quickly thrown out and Brian's learning of her sex-reassignment surgery after he had sex with her caused him to &quot;violently&quot; vomit for 29 seconds.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a><a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> Speaking with LGBT media website <a href="AfterEllen.com_and_AfterElton.com" title="wikilink">AfterElton.com</a> in January 2010, series creator <a href="Seth_MacFarlane" title="wikilink">Seth MacFarlane</a> mentioned the episode in response to concerns over how his animated series have portrayed LGBT characters. &quot;It always distresses me when I hear that the gay community is upset with us, because that's one group of people I hope would know we're on their side. I can safely say that the transsexual community will be very, very happy with the 'Quagmire' episode that we have coming up in a couple of months. It's probably the most sympathetic portrayal of a transexual  character that has ever been on television, dare I say.&quot;<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> In a subsequent review, AfterElton.com writer <a href="Brent_Hartinger" title="wikilink">Brent Hartinger</a> graded the episode negatively. While noting that the episode deserves credit for making important points about transgender people, he found its inclusion of the vomiting scene and Lois and Peter's transphobic remarks about Ida to be &quot;shockingly insensitive&quot;. Hartinger continued, &quot;Frankly, it's literally impossible for me to reconcile last night's episode with MacFarlane's words, unless I come to the conclusion that the man is pretty much a complete idiot.&quot;<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> The <a href="Gay_and_Lesbian_Alliance_Against_Defamation" title="wikilink">Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation</a>, an LGBT media watchdog organization, released a statement about the episode, noting that &quot;GLAAD shares the serious concerns being voiced from members of the community and GLAAD&lt;U+2019&gt;s Entertainment Media Team is addressing these with Fox. Next steps will be decided at that point.&quot;<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
<p>The <a href="Parents_Television_Council" title="wikilink">Parents Television Council</a>, a conservative <a href="decency" class="uri" title="wikilink">decency</a>-campaigning group and frequent critic of MacFarlane's work, named &quot;Quagmire's Dad&quot; as its &quot;Worst TV Show of the Week&quot; citing Dan Quagmire's &quot;outrageously stereotyped gay&quot; character, violence and sexual innuendo. The PTC specifically cited the innuendo-laced dialogue throughout the episode, a &quot;straight 37 seconds&quot;  of vomiting, after Brian learns of Ida's previous identity, Quagmire's <a href="erection" class="uri" title="wikilink">erection</a> while embracing Ida and the violence of the final scene.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a><a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>
