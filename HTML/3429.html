<p><strong>Film Booking Offices of America (FBO)</strong> was an <a href="United_States" title="wikilink">American</a> <a href="film_studio" title="wikilink">film studio</a> of the <a href="Silent_film" title="wikilink">silent era</a>, a producer and distributor of mostly low-budget films. The business began as Robertson-Cole (U.S.), the American division of a <a href="United_Kingdom" title="wikilink">British</a> import&lt;U+2013&gt;export company. Robertson-Cole initiated movie production in 1920; two years later, a corporate reorganization led to the company's new name. In 1923, the studio contracted with <a href="Western_(genre)" title="wikilink">Western</a> actor <a href="Fred_Thomson" title="wikilink">Fred Thomson</a>, who would soon emerge as one of <a href="Cinema_of_the_United_States#Rise_of_Hollywood" title="wikilink">Hollywood's</a> most popular stars. Thomson was just one of numerous screen cowboys with whom FBO became identified.</p>
<p>The studio, whose core market was America's small towns, also put out many romantic melodramas, non-Western action pictures, and comedic <a href="short_subject" title="wikilink">shorts</a>. In 1926, financier <a href="Joseph_P._Kennedy" title="wikilink">Joseph P. Kennedy</a> led a group that acquired the company. In June 1928, using <a href="RCA_Photophone" title="wikilink">RCA Photophone</a> technology, FBO became only the second Hollywood studio to release a <a href="feature_film" title="wikilink">feature</a>-length &quot;<a href="sound_film" title="wikilink">talkie</a>.&quot; A few months later, Kennedy and RCA chief <a href="David_Sarnoff" title="wikilink">David Sarnoff</a> arranged the merger that created <a href="RKO" class="uri" title="wikilink">RKO</a>, one of the <a href="Studio_system#Sound_and_the_Big_Five" title="wikilink">major studios</a> of Hollywood's <a href="Cinema_of_the_United_States#Golden_Age_of_Hollywood" title="wikilink">Golden Age</a>.</p>

R-C Pictures, as it was sometimes known, had already entered the American film distribution market, forging an alliance in 1919 with Exhibitors Mutual Distributing, a corporate descendant of the <a href="Mutual_Film" title="wikilink">Mutual Film</a> studio.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> The first of R-C's own <a href="feature_film" title="wikilink">feature productions</a> to be released was <em>The Wonder Man</em>, directed by John G. Adolfi and starring <a href="Georges_Carpentier" title="wikilink">Georges Carpentier</a>, which debuted <a href="May_29" title="wikilink">May 29</a>, <a href="1920" class="uri" title="wikilink">1920</a>.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> With its move into production, Robertson-Cole (whose U.S. headquarters were located in New York City) established a 13.5-acre (5.5-hectare) studio in L.A.'s fortuitously named Colegrove district, then adjacent to but soon to be subsumed by <a href="Hollywood#Hollywood_and_the_motion_picture_industry" title="wikilink">Hollywood</a>.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> In January 1921, Robertson-Cole absorbed Hallmark Pictures, which had acquired the Exhibitors Mutual interests the previous year.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> The first official Robertson-Cole production shot at the new studio was a February 1921 release, <em>The Mistress of Shenstone</em>, directed by <a href="Henry_King_(director)" title="wikilink">Henry King</a> and starring <a href="Pauline_Frederick" title="wikilink">Pauline Frederick</a>.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> That year, the British owners of the studio entered into a working relationship with <a href="Joseph_P._Kennedy" title="wikilink">Joseph P. Kennedy</a>, father of future U.S. president <a href="John_F._Kennedy" title="wikilink">John F. Kennedy</a>. Joseph Kennedy was then a broker at the New York banking firm of Hayden, Stone, as well as the owner of Maine&lt;U+2013&gt;New Hampshire Theatres, a small chain of movie houses.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> Though he failed to arrange the sale R-C's general partners were looking for, Kennedy's involvement with the studio was far from over.</p>
<p>In 1922, Robertson-Cole underwent a major reorganization as the company's founders departed, though the corporation remained under majority British ownership. The flagship U.S. distribution business changed its name to Film Booking Offices of America, a banner under which R-C had released more than a dozen independent productions. The West Coast studio apparently continued to make films under the Robertson-Cole name for some time, but FBO ultimately became the primary identity of the business for production as well as distribution.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> Between the 1922 reorganization and October 1923, one of the company's new American investors, <a href="Pat_Powers" title="wikilink">Pat Powers</a>, was effectively in command. Powers had previously led his own filmmaking company, part of the multiple merger that created the large <a href="Universal_Studios" title="wikilink">Universal</a> studio in 1912. Powers apparently changed the name of Robertson-Cole/FBO to the Powers Studio for a brief period, though there is no record of the company ever having produced or released a film under that banner.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> In 1923, the studio launched a series of boxing-themed <a href="Short_subject" title="wikilink">shorts</a>, &quot;Fighting Blood,&quot; starring <a href="George_O&#39;Hara_(actor)" title="wikilink">George O'Hara</a>. He would become an FBO mainstay, often paired with <a href="Alberta_Vaughn" title="wikilink">Alberta Vaughn</a>, in such comedy series as &quot;The Pacemakers&quot; (1925). Most of O'Hara's and Vaughn's films for the studio were two-reelers&lt;U+2014&gt;a measure of film length indicating a running time of about twenty minutes. <img src="TelephoneGirlCh10.jpg" title="fig:Love and Learn (1924) was the tenth installment of &quot;The Telephone Girl,&quot; a series of shorts starring Alberta Vaughn. This was not a serial in the classic sense, as each &quot;chapter&quot; was a stand-alone tale." alt="Love and Learn (1924) was the tenth installment of &quot;The Telephone Girl,&quot; a series of shorts starring Alberta Vaughn. This was not a serial in the classic sense, as each &quot;chapter&quot; was a stand-alone tale." width="225" /> Now a fully independent businessman, Joseph Kennedy joined the FBO board of directors in 1923, as well. By this time, the studio was owned by Graham's of London, a banking firm, and Powers was succeeded by H.C.S. Thomson, a Graham's operative.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> Before leaving the board the following year, Kennedy put together a major distribution and production deal between FBO and leading <a href="Western_(genre)" title="wikilink">Western</a> star <a href="Fred_Thomson" title="wikilink">Fred Thomson</a>.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> B. P. Fineman became the studio's production chief in 1924; <a href="Evelyn_Brent" title="wikilink">Evelyn Brent</a>, his wife, moved over from <a href="20th_Century-Fox" title="wikilink">Fox</a> to become FBO's top dramatic star.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> In April 1925, FBO vice-president Joseph I. Schnitzer signed Thomson to a new contract paying him $10,000 a week. Thomson was now the highest paid of all cowboy actors, surpassing even the renowned <a href="Tom_Mix" title="wikilink">Tom Mix</a>. The deal also gave Thomson his own independent production unit at the studio.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<p>As a distributor, FBO's roster of films was about half independent and foreign productions, half its own studio output. At the height of its activity (1923&lt;U+2013&gt;28), it released an average of around 110 features and shorts a year, focusing on distribution to small-town exhibitors and independent theater chains (that is, those not owned by one of the <a href="Major_film_studio#The_majors_before_the_Golden_Age" title="wikilink">major Hollywood studios</a>).<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> As a production company, Film Booking Offices concentrated on low-budget movies, with an emphasis on Westerns, romantic melodramas, and comedy shorts. From its first productions in early 1920 through late 1928, when it was dissolved in a merger, the company produced approximately 400 films under the brand of either Robertson-Cole Pictures or FBO Pictures. Between 1924 and 1926, several higher-end productions were made under the rubric of Gothic Pictures. The studio's top-of-the-line movies, aimed at major exhibition venues beyond the reach of most FBO films, were sometimes marketed as FBO &quot;Gold Bond&quot; pictures.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> Without the backing of large corporate interests, nor the security of its own theater chain, the company faced cash-flow difficulties during its earlier years. Short-term loans at high interest rates posed a significant financial drain.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>

<p><img src="FBOlogo1926.jpg" title="fig:FBO distribution logo from 1926." alt="FBO distribution logo from 1926." width="175" /> While still at Hayden, Stone, Kennedy had boasted to a colleague, &quot;Look at that bunch of pants pressers in Hollywood making themselves millionaires. I could take the whole business away from them.&quot;<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> In 1925, he set out to do so, forming his own group of investors led by wealthy Boston lawyer Guy Currier and including <a href="Filene&#39;s" class="uri" title="wikilink">Filene's</a> department store owner Louis Kirstein and <a href="Union_Stockyards" title="wikilink">Union Stockyards</a> and <a href="Armour_and_Company" title="wikilink">Armour and Company</a> owner <a href="Frederick_H._Prince" title="wikilink">Frederick H. Prince</a>. In August 1925, Kennedy traveled to England with an offer to buy a controlling stake in Film Booking Offices for $1 million. The bid was initially rejected, but in February 1926, FBO's owners decided to take the money.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> In short order, Kennedy moved his family from Massachusetts to New York City to focus on running his new business. He swiftly addressed the company's perennial cash-flow problems, arranging lines of credit and issuing stock in a business division he established, the Cinema Credit Corporation.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> By March, he was traveling to Hollywood.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> The president of the <a href="Motion_Picture_Association_of_America" title="wikilink">Motion Picture Producers and Distributors Association</a>, <a href="Will_H._Hays" title="wikilink">Will Hays</a>, was delighted by the new face on the scene&lt;U+2014&gt;in Hays's eyes, Kennedy signified both a desirable image for the industry and <a href="Wall_Street#Cultural_influence" title="wikilink">Wall Street's</a> faith in its prospects. Hays heralded Kennedy as &quot;exceedingly American&quot; (historian Cari Beauchamp explains the connotation: &quot;not Jewish,&quot; in contrast to most of the studio heads), while celebrating Kennedy's &quot;background of lofty and conservative financial connections, an atmosphere of much home and family life and all those fireside virtues of which the public never hears in the current news from Hollywood.&quot;<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> <img src="FredThomsonFBO.jpg" title="fig:Publicity photo of Fred Thomson, FBO&#39;s biggest box-office draw during the mid-1920s." alt="Publicity photo of Fred Thomson, FBO&#39;s biggest box-office draw during the mid-1920s." width="225" /> Fineman and Brent both departed FBO around the time of the purchase. Kennedy appointed Edwin King as the studio's production chief, but the new owner took a personal hand in guiding the company creatively as well as financially.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> Kennedy soon brought stability to FBO, making it one of the most reliably profitable outfits in the minor leagues of the Hollywood <a href="studio_system" title="wikilink">studio system</a>. Westerns remained the studio's backbone, along with various action pictures and romantic scenarios; as Kennedy put it, &quot;Melodrama is our meat.&quot;<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> During this period, the average production cost of FBO features was around $50,000, and few were budgeted at anything more than $75,000.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> By comparison, in 1927&lt;U+2013&gt;28 the average cost at Fox was $190,000; at <a href="MGM" class="uri" title="wikilink">MGM</a>, $275,000.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> One major expense was taken on directly by Kennedy: with several studios competing for Fred Thomson, Kennedy signed him to a personal contract for $15,000 a week. This was the highest straight salary for any actor in the industry, matched only by Tom Mix's new arrangement with Fox.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> Under the contract, Kennedy struck a deal in early 1927 with <a href="Paramount_Pictures" title="wikilink">Paramount Pictures</a> for the major studio to produce and distribute a series of four Thomson &quot;super westerns.&quot; Kennedy participated in the films' financing (and profits) and the actor's company stayed on the FBO lot. Of the four Thomson features that reached theaters in 1927, three were FBO releases.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="sound-enters-the-picture">Sound enters the picture</h3>
<p><img src="FBOlogo1928.jpg" title="fig:FBO logo from 1928." alt="FBO logo from 1928." width="200" /> The advent of <a href="sound_film" title="wikilink">sound film</a> would drastically alter the studio's course: Negotiations that began in late 1927 with the <a href="Radio_Corporation_of_America" title="wikilink">Radio Corporation of America</a> (RCA) on a deal for sound conversion led to RCA purchasing a major interest in FBO in January 1928. Four months later, as part of a strategy conceived with RCA head <a href="David_Sarnoff" title="wikilink">David Sarnoff</a>, Kennedy acquired control of <a href="Keith-Albee-Orpheum" class="uri" title="wikilink">Keith-Albee-Orpheum</a> (KAO), a vaudeville exhibition chain with approximately one hundred theaters across the United States and the <a href="Path&lt;U+00E9&gt;" title="wikilink">Path&lt;U+00E9&gt; (U.S.)</a>&lt;U+2013&gt;<a href="Cecil_B._De_Mille" title="wikilink">De Mille</a> filmmaking operations under its charge.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> On <a href="June_17" title="wikilink">June 17</a>, <a href="1928" class="uri" title="wikilink">1928</a>, FBO's <em>The Perfect Crime</em>, directed by Bert Glennon and starring <a href="Clive_Brook" title="wikilink">Clive Brook</a> and <a href="Irene_Rich" title="wikilink">Irene Rich</a>, debuted.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> It was the first feature-length &quot;<a href="Sound_film#The_&quot;Talkies&quot;" title="wikilink">talkie</a>&quot; to appear from a studio other than <a href="Warner_Bros." title="wikilink">Warner Bros.</a> since the epochal premiere of Warners' <em><a href="The_Jazz_Singer_(1927_film)" title="wikilink">The Jazz Singer</a></em> eight months before. <em>The Perfect Crime</em>, which went into general release on <a href="August_4" title="wikilink">August 4</a>, had been shot silently; using RCA's <a href="sound-on-film" class="uri" title="wikilink">sound-on-film</a> <a href="RCA_Photophone" title="wikilink">Photophone</a> system, the dialogue was <a href="dubbing" title="wikilink">dubbed</a> in afterward&lt;U+2014&gt;a process then known as &quot;synthetic sound.&quot;<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> On <a href="August_22" title="wikilink">August 22</a>, Kennedy signed a contract with RCA for live Photophone recording; more importantly, he also tendered the company an option to buy his governing share of FBO.

<p>On <a href="October_23" title="wikilink">October 23</a>, <a href="1928" class="uri" title="wikilink">1928</a>, RCA announced it was merging Film Booking Offices and Keith-Albee-Orpheum to form the new motion picture business <a href="RKO_Pictures" title="wikilink">Radio-Keith-Orpheum</a> (RKO), with Sarnoff as chairman.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> Kennedy, who retained Path&lt;U+00E9&gt;, was paid $150,000 for arranging the merger on top of the millions of dollars in profit he made from selling off his stock.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> Joseph I.

Movies that Film Booking Offices had either produced or arranged to distribute were released under the FBO banner through the end of 1929. The last official FBO production to reach American theaters was <em>Pals of the Prairie</em>, directed by Louis King and starring Buzz Barton and Frank Rice, released <a href="July_1" title="wikilink">July 1</a>, <a href="1929" class="uri" title="wikilink">1929</a>.</p>

Partly in consequence, many of FBO's star actors are barely remembered today. Pauline Frederick was the major headliner of the early R-C days, and Evelyn Brent was FBO's most prized non-Western star.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> <a href="Warner_Baxter" title="wikilink">Warner Baxter</a>, <a href="Joe_E._Brown" title="wikilink">Joe E.

He appeared in eighteen FBO releases, more than half of them produced by his own company. Maurice &quot;Lefty&quot; Flynn starred in over a dozen FBO action films, all directed by Harry Garson, who also ran his own production business.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> From the studio's pre-Hollywood days in 1920 through 1928, Ralph Lewis starred in more than ten R-C and FBO pictures of various genres.</p>
<p>Central to the FBO identity were Westerns and the studio's major cowboy star, Fred Thomson. In both 1926 and 1927, he ranked number two in the <em>Exhibitors' Herald</em> survey of the &quot;Top Stars of the Year,&quot; right behind Tom Mix.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> When Thomson's personal contract with Kennedy expired in mid-1927, he left permanently for Paramount, almost literally next door.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> FBO's second-biggest long-running Western star was <a href="Tom_Tyler" title="wikilink">Tom Tyler</a>. According to a June 1927 report, &quot;With Tom Tyler rapidly taking the place recently vacated by Fred Thomson, F.B.O.&lt;U+2019&gt;s program of western pictures is taking a place second to none in the industry.... Tyler has made rapid strides during his two years with F.B.O. and with his horse &lt;U+2018&gt;Flash&lt;U+2019&gt; and dog &lt;U+2018&gt;Beans&lt;U+2019&gt; has become one of the leading favorites on the screen.&lt;U+201D&gt;<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> In 1928, Tom Mix himself joined the FBO roster. In addition to these three big names there was also <a href="Harry_Carey" title="wikilink">Harry Carey</a>, still a major star when he made several films for the studio in 1922&lt;U+2013&gt;23. The other cowboy stars of FBO included Bob Custer, Bob Steele, and teenager Buzz Barton. One of the studio's most reliable Western headliners was a dog: Ranger.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> The fabled <a href="Strongheart" class="uri" title="wikilink">Strongheart</a> starred in FBO's <em>White Fang</em> (1925), and <a href="Rin_Tin_Tin" title="wikilink">Rin Tin Tin</a> had one of his earliest roles in <em>My Dad</em> (1922).<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> FBO's many shorts&lt;U+2014&gt;the popular George O'Hara and Alberta Vaughn series, and scores of others&lt;U+2014&gt;are largely forgotten. Of particular historical interest are two independently produced series of <a href="slapstick" class="uri" title="wikilink">slapstick</a> comedies with important performers: FBO put out several shorts in 1924&lt;U+2013&gt;25 made by <a href="Joe_Rock" title="wikilink">Joe Rock</a> and starring <a href="Stan_Laurel" title="wikilink">Stan Laurel</a>, before his famous partnership with <a href="Oliver_Hardy" title="wikilink">Oliver Hardy</a>.

After the death of celebrated actor <a href="Wallace_Reid" title="wikilink">Wallace Reid</a>, brought on by morphine addiction, his widow, <a href="Dorothy_Davenport" title="wikilink">Dorothy Davenport</a>, signed on as producer and star of a cinematic examination of the sins of substance abuse: <em>Human Wreckage</em>, released by FBO in June 1923, five months after Reid's death, featured Davenport (billed as Mrs. Wallace Reid) as the wife of a noble attorney turned dope fiend.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> When the biggest movie star in the world, <a href="Rudolph_Valentino" title="wikilink">Rudolph Valentino</a>, split from his wife, <a href="Natacha_Rambova" title="wikilink">Natacha Rambova</a>, she was swiftly enlisted by the studio to costar with Clive Brook in the sensitively titled <em>When Love Grows Cold</em> (1925).<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> Under Kennedy's control, studio production shifted away from provocative fare in an attempt to brand the studio's films as suitable for the &quot;average American&quot; and the entire family: &quot;We can't make pictures and label them 'For Children,' or 'For Women' or 'For Stout People' or 'For Thin Ones.' We must make pictures that have appeal to all.&quot;<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> Though Kennedy ended the scandal-sheet specials, FBO still found occasion for celebrity casting: <em>One Minute to Play</em> (1926), directed by <a href="Sam_Wood" title="wikilink">Sam Wood</a>, marks the film debut of football great <a href="Red_Grange" title="wikilink">&quot;Red&quot; Grange</a>.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a></p>

<h2 id="notes">Notes</h2>

<p>Note: Many sources (including Douglas Crafton and Cari Beauchamp, cited herein) give FBO's full name incorrectly as &quot;Film Booking Office of America&quot;; the proper name is Film Booking Offices of America, as can be verified by reference to multiple versions of the company's official logo. See, e.g., the <a href="http://www.learnaboutmovieposters.com/newsite/History/STUDIOS/Early%20Studios/FILM-BOOKING-OFFICE/fbo.asp">FBO page</a> on the <em>Learn About Movie Posters</em> website. Remarkably, even this source misstates the name throughout the accompanying text. For the correct spelling, see also two books contemporary with the studio: Sherwood (1923), pp. 150, 156, 158, 159, etc.; Ellis and Thornborough (1923), p. 262.</p>

<li id="fn1">Goodwin (1987) describes Robertson-Cole as an &quot;American motion picture firm&quot; (p. 341), which was certainly true in a functional way after a certain point, but Jewell (1982) makes clear that the company was founded in Britain and that its American operations were run by Britishmen through 1922 (p. 8).

<li id="fn7">See, e.g., &quot;F.B.O. Announces&quot; (1925) for evidence that the studio was primarily identified as FBO by no later than summer 1925. Though Robertson-Cole apparently remained the primary production brand for a period after the 1922 reorganization, Lasky (1989, p. 13) and Jewell (1982, p. 8) both indicate that the entire film business was incorporated that year as Film Booking Offices of America Inc. Beauchamp (1998) refers to Kennedy's 1926 takeover of &quot;R-C Pictures Corporation and Film Booking Office of America&quot; (p. 180). These various references suggest that, from 1922 forward, R-C (or Robertson-Cole) Pictures Corp. was the legal name of FBO (or Film Booking Offices of America) Inc.'s studio subsidiary. Logos from 1927 and 1928 (the latter pictured in the article) reading &quot;FBO Pictures Corp.&quot; suggest that the corporate name of the studio operation was changed after the Kennedy purchase.<a href="#fnref7" class="footnote-back">↩</a></li>

This is potentially misleading, even aside from the misspelling of FBO's name; the available evidence demonstrates that Film Booking Offices was already the studio operation's primary identity, even though it might still have been registered as R-C Pictures Corporation or some variation thereof.

<li id="fn38">The suggestion by Goodwin (1987) that, during Kennedy's tenure, FBO made &quot;a dozen dog pictures...each year&quot; (p. 348) is rather exaggerated. Ranger, the studio's only canine headliner of the Kennedy era, starred in sixteen pictures over the course of three years. From before the Kennedy era through 1928, Beans had featured roles in a number of Tom Tyler/Frankie Darro Westerns. For examples of how such films were marketed, see <em>Heritage Vintage</em> (2004a), p. 79, and <em>Heritage Vintage</em> (2005), p. 35. In the latter, note that the text accompanying the reproduced poster of <em>Tom and His Pals</em> (1926) incorrectly identifies the film as a Paramount picture; note also that, despite what the text implies, this was not the first film teaming Tyler and Darro.<a href="#fnref38" class="footnote-back">↩</a></li>
