<p>The <strong>Charlotte Hornets</strong> were a <a href="american_football" title="wikilink">football</a> team in the short-lived <a href="World_Football_League" title="wikilink">World Football League</a>. They were actually relocated to <a href="Charlotte,_North_Carolina" title="wikilink">Charlotte, North Carolina</a> from <a href="New_York_City" title="wikilink">New York City</a> in the middle of their inaugural <a href="1974" class="uri" title="wikilink">1974</a> season.</p>
<h2 id="in-new-york">In New York</h2>
<p>The Hornets franchise began in <a href="1973" class="uri" title="wikilink">1973</a> in <a href="Boston" class="uri" title="wikilink">Boston</a> as the <strong>Boston Bulldogs</strong>. The name was shortened at the 11th hour in October to <strong>Bulls.</strong> They were owned by Howard Baldwin, who was president and minority owner of the <a href="Hartford_Whalers" title="wikilink">New England Whalers</a> of the <a href="World_Hockey_Association" title="wikilink">World Hockey Association</a>. Unlike most of the other WFL owners, he didn't have to pay a franchise fee because of his close ties to WFL founder Gary Davidson--who also happened to be commissioner of the WFL. He also hired <a href="Babe_Parilli" title="wikilink">Babe Parilli</a> as head coach.</p>
<p>However, Baldwin was unable to attract more investors. More seriously, he couldn't find a suitable place to play. Realizing he had no hope of putting together a viable product in Boston, Baldwin opted to merge with the WFL's as-yet-unnamed New York franchise on <a href="January_26" title="wikilink">January 26</a> <a href="1974" class="uri" title="wikilink">1974</a>. That team was owned by Whalers majority owner Robert Schmertz, who like Baldwin hadn't had to pay a franchise fee. The two teams had already worked together very closely in the draft. The merged team took the name <strong>New York Stars.</strong></p>
<p>Finding a home field for the fledgling team proved just as difficult as finding a name. <a href="Yankee_Stadium" title="wikilink">Yankee Stadium</a> was closed for renovation right after the <a href="New_York_Yankees" title="wikilink">Yankees</a> finished the 1973 season in October; it would not reopen until 1976. <a href="Shea_Stadium" title="wikilink">Shea Stadium</a> became full to capacity as the &quot;Bronx Bombers&quot; shared the park with the hometown <a href="New_York_Mets" title="wikilink">Mets</a> and the <a href="NFL" class="uri" title="wikilink">NFL</a>'s <a href="New_York_Jets" title="wikilink">Jets</a>. The Stars had to settle for decrepit <a href="Downing_Stadium" title="wikilink">Downing Stadium</a>, a 22,000-seat facility built during the Depression as a WPA Project, located on <a href="Randall&#39;s_Island" title="wikilink">Randall's Island</a> near the <a href="East_River" title="wikilink">East River</a>.</p>
<p>Parilli signed a number of former <a href="Super_Bowl_III" title="wikilink">Super Bowl III</a> Jets including wide receiver George Sauer, who was coming out of retirement after three years, and former All-Pro defensive men Gerry Philbin, as well as John Elliott.</p>
<p>The WFL needed New York in order to have a presence in the largest U.S. media market. The Stars sold between 5,500 and 8,000 season tickets. Its first home game, after losing a close one at <a href="Jacksonville_Sharks" title="wikilink">Jacksonville</a>-in front of a league high crowd of 59,112 at the <a href="Gator_Bowl_Stadium" title="wikilink">Gator Bowl</a>, against the <a href="Birmingham_Americans" title="wikilink">Birmingham Americans</a> attracted 17,943 New Yorkers. After leading at halftime, 29-3, the Stars were toppled by the efforts of Americans quarterback George Mira, who threw for three touchdowns and ran for another as Birmingham pulled out a 32-29 comeback win. The Stars finally won their first game, as kicker Moses Lajterman put the winning field goal through for a razor-thin 17-15 win over <a href="Philadelphia_Bell" title="wikilink">Philadelphia</a>. The Stars and hosting Bell performed in front of the largest WFL attended game, with 64,179 on hand. Many of the tickets were sold at large discounts or were given away free in a marketing ploy to make the League appear more successful than it was.</p>
<p>New York then went on a tear, winning five in a row. Among the victims besides the Bell were the <a href="Jacksonville_Sharks" title="wikilink">Jacksonville Sharks</a>, <a href="Southern_California_Sun" title="wikilink">Southern California Sun</a>, <a href="Portland_Storm" title="wikilink">Portland Storm</a>, and <a href="Houston_Texans_(WFL)" title="wikilink">Houston Texans</a>. Coincidentally, the team's winning streak was stopped by those same Texans a week later, with a surprise addition to the Houston roster: <a href="John_Matuszak" title="wikilink">John Matuszak</a>. Matuszak had been AWOL from the NFL's <a href="Houston_Oilers" title="wikilink">Houston Oilers</a> just 48 hours earlier. The Stars had mixed results in the next few weeks, winning over Portland again, but losing to <a href="Florida_Blazers" title="wikilink">Florida</a> in the rain and <a href="The_Hawaiians" title="wikilink">The Hawaiians</a> in the sun. To improve the roster, New York picked up several NFL players from the waiver wire. Among them were cornerback John Dockery, who played for Parilli with the New York Jets, and Don Highsmith, a running back released by Oakland and turned out to be a great addition to the Stars running attack. The Stars performed better on the field and were a nice alternative than the more expensive, yet losing Giants and Jets.</p>
<p>For all their on-field success, the Stars were dragged down by serious off-field financial problems. Like most WFL teams, they were badly undercapitalized. Their fiscal structure began to founder when Schmertz's construction company ran into trouble. He was also trapped in a nasty divorce.</p>
<p>However, even without these factors to consider, the Stars played in a stadium that was completely inadequate for a team aspiring to be part of a major sports organization. It was nearly inaccessible from most of the city, and had not been well maintained in at least 20 years. Amenities for fans, players and the press were virtually nonexistent. The toilets in the locker room frequently overflowed. During the home opener, the Stars' radio announcers had to sit on orange crates because there were no chairs in the press box; their Birmingham counterparts had to stand. Parking was inadequate It soon became obvious that Schmertz and Baldwin wouldn't have enough money to finish the season. Unable to find a local buyer, the WFL resigned itself to abandoning the nation's biggest market.</p>
<p><a href="September_24" title="wikilink">September 24</a>, <a href="1974" class="uri" title="wikilink">1974</a> was their final game at New York (the game was moved from Wednesday because of Yom Kippur). Ironically, that same day, the <a href="Detroit_Wheels" title="wikilink">Detroit Wheels</a>' 33 owners filed for bankruptcy. Called the &quot;Bankrupt Bowl,&quot; the Stars blew out the destitute Wheels, 37-7.</p>

<p>While they were packing up for the next night's game against the <a href="Chicago_Fire_(football)" title="wikilink">Chicago Fire</a>, Parilli announced the team was moving to Charlotte for the rest of the season as the <strong>Charlotte Stars</strong>. The league had found a buyer in former <a href="New_England_Patriots" title="wikilink">New England Patriots</a> executive <a href="Upton_Bell" title="wikilink">Upton Bell</a> after Charlotte mayor <a href="John_M._Belk" title="wikilink">John M. Belk</a> helped engineer a deal that made the move feasible. Forced to find a new logo literally at the last minute, the equipment man simply stuck the <a href="Chicago_Bears" title="wikilink">Chicago Bears</a>' &quot;C&quot; logo over the old New York logo. The Stars routed the Fire, 41-30. A few days later, they were renamed the Hornets. Shortly after they arrived in Charlotte, however, they had their uniforms impounded due to an unpaid laundry bill from their New York days.</p>
<p>The team's first home game at Charlotte was a rousing success. In the league's brief history, the Hornets sold out all 25,133 tickets, leaving some 5,000 out of luck. Unfortunately, the visiting <a href="Memphis_Southmen" title="wikilink">Memphis Southmen</a> ruined their debut, winning 27-23. In spite of the loss, the new Charlotte club - which played at <a href="American_Legion_Memorial_Stadium" title="wikilink">American Legion Memorial Stadium</a>-did far better in tickets sales than as the old New York Stars. In four games at Charlotte, the Hornets sold over 80,000 compared to just 75,000 in seven games at Downing Stadium. Toward the end of the season, the Hornets struggled on the field, losing their last four games. Although Charlotte finished second place with a 10-10 record, they couldn't afford to attend the playoff game at <a href="Orlando,_Florida" title="wikilink">Orlando</a>, against the first place Eastern Division winning <a href="Florida_Blazers" title="wikilink">Florida Blazers</a>. The <a href="Philadelphia_Bell" title="wikilink">Philadelphia Bell</a>, who finished third with a 9-11 record, took the Hornets' place.</p>
<p>The team returned for the abbreviated <a href="1975_in_sports" title="wikilink">1975</a> campaign and lasted until the league ceased operations in midseason. The Hornets finished at 6-5.</p>
