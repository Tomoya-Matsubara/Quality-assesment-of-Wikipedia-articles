He was also noted for his work with the <a href="US_Armed_Forces" title="wikilink">US Armed Forces</a> and his numerous <a href="United_Service_Organizations" title="wikilink">USO</a> tours entertaining American military personnel.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> Throughout his career, he was honored for his humanitarian work. In 1996, the <a href="United_States_Congress" title="wikilink">U.S. Congress</a> honored Bob Hope by declaring him the &quot;first and only honorary veteran of the U.S. armed forces.&quot; Bob Hope appeared in or hosted 199 known USO shows.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="early-years">Early years</h2>
<p>Hope was born in <a href="Eltham" class="uri" title="wikilink">Eltham</a>, <a href="London" class="uri" title="wikilink">London</a>, <a href="England" class="uri" title="wikilink">England</a>, the fifth of seven sons. His father, William Henry Hope, was a <a href="stonemason" class="uri" title="wikilink">stonemason</a> from <a href="Weston-super-Mare" class="uri" title="wikilink">Weston-super-Mare</a>, <a href="Somerset" class="uri" title="wikilink">Somerset</a> and his <a href="Wales" title="wikilink">Welsh</a> mother, Avis Townes, was a <a href="operetta" title="wikilink">light opera</a> singer who later worked as a cleaning woman. The family lived in Weston-super-Mare, then <a href="St_George,_Bristol" title="wikilink">Whitehall</a> and <a href="St_George,_Bristol" title="wikilink">St George</a> in <a href="Bristol" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bristol</a>, before moving to <a href="Cleveland,_Ohio" title="wikilink">Cleveland, Ohio</a> in 1908. The family emigrated to the United States aboard the SS <em>Philadelphia</em>, and passed inspection at <a href="Ellis_Island" title="wikilink">Ellis Island</a> on March 30, 1908. Hope became a U.S. citizen in 1920 at the age of seventeen.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> In a 1942 legal document, Hope's legal name is given as Lester Townes Hope.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> His name on the Social Security Index is also listed as Lester T. Hope.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> His name at birth as registered during the July&lt;U+2013&gt;August&lt;U+2013&gt;September quarter in the <a href="Lewisham" class="uri" title="wikilink">Lewisham</a> district of Greater London was also Leslie Towns (sic) Hope.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p>From the age of 12, he worked at a variety of odd jobs at a local <a href="boardwalk" class="uri" title="wikilink">boardwalk</a>. He would <a href="busking" title="wikilink">busk</a>,<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> doing dance and comedy patter to make extra money (oftentimes on the <a href="Tram" title="wikilink">trolley</a> to <a href="Luna_Park,_Cleveland" title="wikilink">Luna Park</a>). He entered many dancing and amateur talent contests (as Lester Hope),<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> and won prizes for his impersonation of <a href="Charlie_Chaplin" title="wikilink">Charlie Chaplin</a>. He also boxed briefly and unsuccessfully under the name Packy East, once making it to the semifinals of the Ohio novice championship.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1918 at the age of 15 he was admitted<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> (as Lester Hope) to the Boys Industrial School<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> in Lancaster, Ohio. Formerly known as the Ohio Reform School, this was one of the more innovative, progressive institutions for juvenile offenders. As an adult, Hope donated sizable sums of money to the institution.</p>
<p>Silent film comedian <a href="Roscoe_Arbuckle" title="wikilink">Fatty Arbuckle</a> saw one of his performances with his first partner, Lloyd &quot;Lefty&quot; Durbin, and in 1925 got the pair steady work with Hurley's Jolly Follies. Within a year, Hope had formed an act called the Dancemedians with George Byrne and the <a href="Hilton_twins" title="wikilink">Hilton Sisters</a>, conjoined twins who had a tap dancing routine. Hope and his partner George Byrne had an act as a pair of Siamese twins as well, and both danced and sang while wearing <a href="blackface" class="uri" title="wikilink">blackface</a>, before friends advised Hope that he was funnier as himself.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> In 1929, he changed his first name to &quot;Bob&quot;. In one version of the story, he named himself after racecar driver <a href="Bob_Burman" title="wikilink">Bob Burman</a>. In another, he said he chose Bob because he wanted a name with a friendly &quot;Hiya Fellas!&quot; sound to it. After five years on the vaudeville circuit, by his own account, Hope was surprised and humbled when he and his partner (and future wife) Grace Louise Troxell failed a 1930 screen test for <a href="Path&lt;U+00E9&gt;" class="uri" title="wikilink">Path&lt;U+00E9&gt;</a> at <a href="Culver_City,_California" title="wikilink">Culver City</a>, California.</p>
<h2 id="career">Career</h2>
<h3 id="film">Film</h3>

<p>Hope, like other stage performers, made his first films in New York. <a href="Educational_Pictures" title="wikilink">Educational Pictures</a> employed him in 1934 for a short-subject comedy, <em><a href="Going_Spanish" title="wikilink">Going Spanish</a></em>. Hope sealed his fate with Educational when <a href="Walter_Winchell" title="wikilink">Walter Winchell</a> asked him about the film. Hope cracked, &quot;When they catch <a href="John_Dillinger" title="wikilink">John Dillinger</a>, they're going to make him sit through it twice.&quot;<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> Educational fired him, but he was soon before the cameras at New York's <a href="Vitaphone" class="uri" title="wikilink">Vitaphone</a> studio starring in 20-minute comedies and musicals from 1934 through 1936.</p>
<p><a href="Paramount_Pictures" title="wikilink">Paramount Pictures</a> signed Hope for the 1938 film <em><a href="The_Big_Broadcast_of_1938" title="wikilink">The Big Broadcast of 1938</a></em>. During a duet with <a href="Shirley_Ross" title="wikilink">Shirley Ross</a> as accompanied by <a href="Shep_Fields" title="wikilink">Shep Fields</a> and his orchestra, Hope introduced the song later to become his trademark, &quot;<a href="Thanks_for_the_Memory" title="wikilink">Thanks for the Memory</a>&quot;, which became a major hit and was praised by critics. The sentimental, fluid nature of the music allowed Hope's writers (whom he is said to have depended upon heavily throughout his career) to later invent endless variations of the song to fit specific circumstances, such as bidding farewell to troops while on tour.</p>
<p>Hope became one of Paramount's biggest stars, and would remain with the studio through the 1950s. Hope's regular appearances in Hollywood films and radio made him one of the best known entertainers in North America, and at the height of his career he was also making a large income from live concert performances. <img src="BobHope.JPG" title="fig:The handprints of Bob Hope in front of The Great Movie Ride at Walt Disney World&#39;s Disney&#39;s Hollywood Studios theme park" alt="The handprints of Bob Hope in front of The Great Movie Ride at Walt Disney World&#39;s Disney&#39;s Hollywood Studios theme park" /> As a movie star, he was best known for <em><a href="My_Favorite_Brunette" title="wikilink">My Favorite Brunette</a></em> and the highly successful <a href="Road_to..." title="wikilink">&quot;Road&quot;</a> movies in which he starred with <a href="Bing_Crosby" title="wikilink">Bing Crosby</a> and <a href="Dorothy_Lamour" title="wikilink">Dorothy Lamour</a>. Hope had seen Lamour as a nightclub singer in New York, and invited her to work on his <a href="United_Service_Organizations" title="wikilink">USO</a> tours. Lamour is said to have arrived for filming prepared with her lines, only to be baffled by completely re-written scripts from Hope's writers without studio permission. Hope and Lamour were lifelong friends, and she is the actress most associated with his film career. Other female co-stars included <a href="Paulette_Goddard" title="wikilink">Paulette Goddard</a>, <a href="Lucille_Ball" title="wikilink">Lucille Ball</a>, <a href="Jane_Russell" title="wikilink">Jane Russell</a>, and <a href="Hedy_Lamarr" title="wikilink">Hedy Lamarr</a>.</p>
<p>Hope was <a href="Master_of_Ceremonies" title="wikilink">host</a> of the Academy Awards ceremony 18 times between 1939 and 1977. His feigned lust for an <a href="Academy_Award" title="wikilink">Academy Award</a> became part of his act. In one scene from <em><a href="Road_to_Morocco" title="wikilink">Road to Morocco</a></em> he erupted in a frenzy, shouting about his imminent death from exposure. Bing Crosby reminds him that rescue is just minutes away, and a disappointed Hope complains that Crosby has spoiled his best scene, and thus his chance for an Academy Award. Also, in <em>The Road to Bali</em>, when Crosby finds Humphrey Bogart's Oscar for <em>The African Queen</em>, Hope grabs it, saying &quot;Give me that. You've got one.&quot; Although Hope was never nominated for an <a href="Academy_Awards" title="wikilink">Oscar</a> for his performances (<a href="Bing_Crosby" title="wikilink">Bing Crosby</a> won the Best Actor for <em><a href="Going_My_Way" title="wikilink">Going My Way</a></em> in 1944), the <a href="Academy_of_Motion_Picture_Arts_and_Sciences" title="wikilink">Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences</a> honored him with four honorary awards, and in 1960, the <a href="Jean_Hersholt_Humanitarian_Award" title="wikilink">Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award</a>. While introducing the 1968 telecast, he quipped, &quot;Welcome to the Academy Awards, or, as it's known at my house, <a href="Passover" class="uri" title="wikilink">Passover</a>.&quot;<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>

<p>Hope first appeared on television in 1932 during a test transmission from an experimental <a href="CBS" class="uri" title="wikilink">CBS</a> studio in New York. In January 1947, Hope was master of ceremonies for the first telecast by California's first television station, <a href="KTLA" class="uri" title="wikilink">KTLA</a>. His career in broadcasting spanned 64 years and included a long association with <a href="NBC" class="uri" title="wikilink">NBC</a>. Hope made his network radio debut in 1937 on NBC. His first regular series for NBC Radio was the <em>Woodbury Soap Hour</em>. A year later, <em>The <a href="Pepsodent" class="uri" title="wikilink">Pepsodent</a> Show Starring Bob Hope</em> began, continuing as <em>The New Swan Show</em> in 1948 (for the same sponsor, <a href="Lever_Brothers" title="wikilink">Lever Brothers</a>). After 1950, the series was known simply as <em>The Bob Hope Show</em>, with <a href="Liggett_&amp;_Myers" title="wikilink">Liggett &amp; Myers</a> (1950&lt;U+2013&gt;52), <a href="General_Foods" title="wikilink">General Foods</a> (1953) and <a href="American_Dairy_Association" title="wikilink">American Dairy Association</a> (1953&lt;U+2013&gt;55) as his sponsors, until it finally went off the air in April 1955. Regulars on his radio series included zany <a href="Jerry_Colonna_(entertainer)" title="wikilink">Jerry Colonna</a> and <a href="Barbara_Jo_Allen" title="wikilink">Barbara Jo Allen</a> as spinster Vera Vague. <img src="Colonnahope.jpg" title="fig:Jerry Colonna and Bob Hope as caricatured by Sam Berman for NBC&#39;s 1947 promotional book." alt="Jerry Colonna and Bob Hope as caricatured by Sam Berman for NBC&#39;s 1947 promotional book." width="200" /></p>
<p>Hope did many specials for the NBC television network in the following decades, beginning in April 1950. These were often sponsored by <a href="General_Motors" title="wikilink">General Motors</a> (1955&lt;U+2013&gt;61), <a href="Chrysler" class="uri" title="wikilink">Chrysler</a> (1963&lt;U+2013&gt;73) and <a href="Texaco" class="uri" title="wikilink">Texaco</a> (1975&lt;U+2013&gt;85), and Hope served as a spokesman for both companies for many years. and would sometimes introduce himself as &quot;Bob, from Texaco, Hope.&quot; Hope's Christmas specials were popular favorites and often featured a performance of &quot;<a href="Silver_Bells" title="wikilink">Silver Bells</a>&quot; (from his 1951 film <em><a href="The_Lemon_Drop_Kid" title="wikilink">The Lemon Drop Kid</a></em>) done as a duet with an often much younger female guest star (such as <a href="Olivia_Newton-John" title="wikilink">Olivia Newton-John</a>, <a href="Barbara_Eden" title="wikilink">Barbara Eden</a>, and <a href="Brooke_Shields" title="wikilink">Brooke Shields</a>).</p>
<p>In October 1956, Hope appeared on an episode of the most-viewed program in America at the time, <em><a href="I_Love_Lucy" title="wikilink">I Love Lucy</a></em>. He said, upon receiving the script: &quot;What? A script? I don't need one of these&quot;, and ad-libbed the entire episode. <a href="Desi_Arnaz" title="wikilink">Desi Arnaz</a> said of Hope after his appearance: &quot;Bob is a very nice man, he can crack you up, no matter how much you try for him to not.&quot; Lucy and Desi returned the favor by appearing on one of his <em>Chevy Show</em> specials (with <a href="Vivian_Vance" title="wikilink">Vivian Vance</a> and <a href="William_Frawley" title="wikilink">William Frawley</a>) later that season.</p>
<p>Hope's 1970 and 1971 Christmas specials for NBC&lt;U+2014&gt;filmed in <a href="Vietnam" class="uri" title="wikilink">Vietnam</a> in front of military audiences at the height of the war&lt;U+2014&gt;are on the list of the <a href="List_of_most-watched_television_episodes#Top_30_Network_Primetime_Telecasts_of_All_Time" title="wikilink">Top 30 U.S. Network Primetime Telecasts of All Time</a>.

<p>Of Hope's USO shows in World War II, writer <a href="John_Steinbeck" title="wikilink">John Steinbeck</a>, who was then working as a war correspondent, wrote in 1943:</p>

<p>A 1997 act of <a href="United_States_Congress" title="wikilink">Congress</a> signed by <a href="Bill_Clinton" title="wikilink">President Clinton</a> named Hope an &quot;Honorary Veteran.&quot; He remarked, &quot;I've been given many awards in my lifetimeÂ &lt;U+2014&gt; but to be numbered among the men and women I admire mostÂ &lt;U+2014&gt; is the greatest honor I have ever received.&quot;<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
<p>Hope appeared in so many theaters of war over the decades that it was often cracked (in Bob Hope style) that &quot;Where there's death, there's Hope&quot;.</p>
<p>In 2009, <a href="Stephen_Colbert" title="wikilink">Stephen Colbert</a> carried a golf club on stage each night during his own week-long USO performance and taping of <em><a href="The_Colbert_Report" title="wikilink">The Colbert Report</a></em><a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> and explained in his last episode that it was an homage to Hope.</p>
<h3 id="theater">Theater</h3>
<p>Hope's first Broadway appearances, in 1927's <em>The Sidewalks of New York</em> and 1928's <em>Ups-a-Daisy</em>, were nothing but mere walk-ons.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>

<p>Hope was an avid golfer. He was introduced to the game in the 1930s, and eventually played to a four <a href="Golf_handicap" title="wikilink">handicap</a>. His love for the game, and the humor he could find in it, made him a much sought-after <a href="foursome_(golf)" title="wikilink">foursome</a> member. He once remarked that President <a href="Dwight_D._Eisenhower" title="wikilink">Dwight D.

<p>Hope's first wife was his vaudeville partner Grace Louise Troxell, whom he married on January 25, 1933. When the marriage record was unearthed some years later, Hope denied that the marriage had any substance and said they had quickly divorced. There were rumors that he fathered a daughter with Troxell and that he continued to send generous cheques to her despite a widely documented reputation for <a href="frugality" class="uri" title="wikilink">frugality</a>.

<p>Hope celebrated his 100th birthday on May 29, 2003, joining a small group of notable centenarians in the field of entertainment (including <a href="Irving_Berlin" title="wikilink">Irving Berlin</a>, <a href="Hal_Roach" title="wikilink">Hal Roach</a>, <a href="Senor_Wences" title="wikilink">Senor Wences</a>, <a href="George_Abbott" title="wikilink">George Abbott</a>, <a href="Adolph_Zukor" title="wikilink">Adolph Zukor</a>, <a href="Barbara_Kent" title="wikilink">Barbara Kent</a> and <a href="George_Burns" title="wikilink">George Burns</a>.) To mark this event, the intersection of <a href="Hollywood_and_Vine" title="wikilink">Hollywood and Vine</a> in Los Angeles, California was named <em>Bob Hope Square</em> and his centennial was declared <em>Bob Hope Day</em> in 35 states. Hope spent the day privately in his <a href="Toluca_Lake,_Los_Angeles,_California" title="wikilink">Toluca Lake, Los Angeles</a> home where he had lived since 1937.

<p>Beginning in 2000, Hope's health steadily declined and he was hospitalized several times before his death.

<p>On July 27, 2003, Bob Hope died at his home in Toluca Lake at 9:28 p.m. According to one of Hope's daughters, when asked on his deathbed where he wanted to be buried, he told his wife, &quot;Surprise me.&quot;<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> After his death, <a href="Cardinal_Roger_Mahony" title="wikilink">Cardinal Roger Mahony</a>, <a href="Roman_Catholic_Archdiocese_of_Los_Angeles" title="wikilink">Archbishop of Los Angeles</a>, confirmed that Hope had converted to <a href="Roman_Catholicism" title="wikilink">Roman Catholicism</a> years before he died and added that he had died a Catholic in good standing.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> He was interred in the Bob Hope Memorial Garden at <a href="San_Fernando_Mission_Cemetery" title="wikilink">San Fernando Mission Cemetery</a> in Los Angeles, where his mother is also buried.</p>
