<p>The <strong>1991 Perfect Storm</strong>, also known as the <strong>Halloween Nor'easter of 1991</strong>, was a <a href="nor&#39;easter" class="uri" title="wikilink">nor'easter</a> that absorbed <a href="Hurricane_Grace_(1991)" title="wikilink">Hurricane Grace</a> and ultimately evolved into a small hurricane late in its life cycle. The initial <a href="low_pressure_area" title="wikilink">area of low pressure</a> developed off <a href="Atlantic_Canada" title="wikilink">Atlantic Canada</a> on October 28. Forced southward by a <a href="ridge_(meteorology)" title="wikilink">ridge</a> to its north, it reached its peak intensity as a large and powerful cyclone. The storm lashed the <a href="East_Coast_of_the_United_States" title="wikilink">East Coast of the United States</a> with high waves and coastal flooding, before turning to the southwest and weakening. Moving over warmer waters, the system transitioned into a <a href="subtropical_cyclone" title="wikilink">subtropical cyclone</a> before becoming a tropical storm. It executed a loop off the <a href="Mid-Atlantic_states" title="wikilink">Mid-Atlantic states</a> and turned toward the northeast. On November 1 the system evolved into a full-fledged hurricane with peak winds of 75 mph (120 km/h), although the <a href="National_Hurricane_Center" title="wikilink">National Hurricane Center</a> left it unnamed to avoid confusion amid media interest in the predecessor extratropical storm. It later received the name &quot;the Perfect Storm&quot; after a conversation between Boston <a href="National_Weather_Service" title="wikilink">National Weather Service</a> forecaster <a href="Robert_Case" title="wikilink">Robert Case</a> and author <a href="Sebastian_Junger" title="wikilink">Sebastian Junger</a>. The system was the fourth hurricane and final tropical cyclone in the <a href="1991_Atlantic_hurricane_season" title="wikilink">1991 Atlantic hurricane season</a>. The tropical system weakened, striking Nova Scotia as a tropical storm before dissipating.</p>
<p>Damage from the Perfect Storm totaled over $200 million (1991 USD)<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> and the death toll was thirteen. Most of the damage occurred while the storm was extratropical, after waves up to  struck the coastline from Canada to Florida and southeastward to Puerto Rico. In Massachusetts, where damage was heaviest, over 100 homes were destroyed or severely damaged. To the north, more than 100 homes were affected in Maine, including the vacation home of then-<a href="President_of_the_United_States" title="wikilink">President</a> <a href="George_H.W._Bush" title="wikilink">George H.W. Bush</a>. More than 38,000 people were left without power, and along the coast high waves inundated roads and buildings. In portions of New England, damage was worse than <a href="Hurricane_Bob" title="wikilink">Hurricane Bob</a> had caused two months prior.</p>
<p>Aside from tidal flooding along rivers, the storm's effects were primarily concentrated along the coast. A buoy off the coast of Nova Scotia reported a wave height of 100.7 ft (30.7 m), the highest ever recorded in the province's offshore waters. In the middle of the storm, the <a href="Andrea_Gail" title="wikilink">Andrea Gail</a> sank, killing its crew of six and inspiring the <a href="The_Perfect_Storm_(book)" title="wikilink">book</a>, and later <a href="The_Perfect_Storm_(film)" title="wikilink">movie</a>, <em>The Perfect Storm</em>. Off the shore of New York's <a href="Long_Island" title="wikilink">Long Island</a>, an Air National Guard helicopter lost fuel and crashed; four members of its crew were rescued, and one was killed. Two people died after their boat sank off <a href="Staten_Island" title="wikilink">Staten Island</a>. High waves swept people to their deaths in Rhode Island and Puerto Rico, and another person was blown off a bridge to his death. The tropical cyclone that formed late in the storm's duration caused little impact, limited to power outages and slick roads; one person was killed in Newfoundland from a traffic accident related to the storm.</p>

On October 28, the front spawned an extratropical low to the east of Nova Scotia. Around that time, a <a href="ridge_(meteorology)" title="wikilink">ridge</a> extended from the <a href="Appalachian_Mountains" title="wikilink">Appalachian Mountains</a> northeastward to Greenland, with a strong high pressure center over eastern Canada. The blocking ridge forced the extratropical low to track toward the southeast and later to the west. Hurricane Grace was swept aloft by its cold front into the warm conveyor belt circulation of the deep cyclone on October 29. The cyclone significantly strengthened as a result of the temperature contrast between the cold air to the northwest and the warmth and humidity from the remnants of Hurricane Grace. The low pressure system continued deepening as it drifted toward the United States.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> It had an unusual retrograde motion for a <a href="nor&#39;easter" class="uri" title="wikilink">nor'easter</a>, beginning a set of meteorological circumstances that occur only once every 50 to 100 years.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> Most nor'easters affect New England from the southwest.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>

The interaction between the extratropical storm and the high pressure system to its north created a significant pressure gradient, which created large waves and strong winds.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> Between the southern New England coast and the storm's center, the gradient was .<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> A buoy located 264 mi (425 km) south of <a href="Halifax_Regional_Municipality" title="wikilink">Halifax</a> reported a wave height of 100.7 ft (30.7 m) on October 30.

<p><img src="Halloween_storm_30_oct_1991_1226Z.jpg" title="fig:The cyclone near its closest approach to the United States" alt="The cyclone near its closest approach to the United States" /> In New York and northern New Jersey, the storm system left the most coastal damage since the <a href="1944_Great_Atlantic_hurricane" title="wikilink">1944 Great Atlantic hurricane</a>. Numerous boats were damaged or destroyed, killing two people off <a href="Staten_Island" title="wikilink">Staten Island</a>.

Across the area, tide heights reached their highest since the 1944 hurricane, leaving severe coastal and back bay flooding and closing many roads. The storm also caused significant beach erosion,<a href="#fn81" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref81"><sup>81</sup></a> with 500,000 <a href="cubic_yard" title="wikilink">cubic yards</a> (382,000 cubic meters) lost in <a href="Avalon,_New_Jersey" title="wikilink">Avalon</a>, as well as $10 million damage to the beach in <a href="Cape_May,_New_Jersey" title="wikilink">Cape May</a>.

<p>In North Carolina along the <a href="Outer_Banks" title="wikilink">Outer Banks</a>, high waves were initially caused by Hurricane Grace and later its interaction with a high pressure system. This produced gale-force winds and  waves in the town of <a href="Duck,_North_Carolina" title="wikilink">Duck</a>. Later, the extratropical predecessor to the unnamed hurricane produced additional high waves, causing oceanfront flooding from <a href="Cape_Hatteras" title="wikilink">Cape Hatteras</a> through the northern portions of <a href="Currituck_County,_North_Carolina" title="wikilink">Currituck County</a>.
