<h2 id="early-life">Early life</h2>
<p>Eugene of Savoy was born on <a href="October_18" title="wikilink">October 18</a>, <a href="1663" class="uri" title="wikilink">1663</a> in <a href="Paris" class="uri" title="wikilink">Paris</a>. He was the fifth son of Prince <a href="Eug&lt;U+00E8&gt;ne-Maurice_of_Savoy-Carignano" title="wikilink">Eug&lt;U+00E8&gt;ne-Maurice of Savoy-Carignano</a>, Comte de Soissons, grandson to <a href="Charles_Emmanuel_I,_Duke_of_Savoy" title="wikilink">Charles Emmanuel I, Duke of Savoy</a>, and <a href="Olympia_Mancini" title="wikilink">Olympia Mancini</a>, niece to the powerful Cardinal <a href="Mazarin" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mazarin</a>. There were rumors that his real father was <a href="Louis_XIV_of_France" title="wikilink">Louis XIV</a>, as Olympia had been one of his mistresses; but chronology makes this impossible.</p>
<p>His mother's sister <a href="Laura_Mancini" title="wikilink">Laura Mancini</a> was the mother of <a href="Louis_Joseph_de_Bourbon,_duc_de_Vend&lt;U+00F4&gt;me" title="wikilink">Vend&lt;U+00F4&gt;me</a>, one of his great opponents. Another cousin was <a href="Louis,_Margrave_of_Baden-Baden" title="wikilink">Louis, Margrave of Baden-Baden</a>, whose mother was a sister of Eugene's father. Another sister of Mazarin's was the mother of <a href="Laura_Martinozzi" title="wikilink">Laura Martinozzi</a>, the <a href="Duke_of_Modena" title="wikilink">Duchess of Modena</a>, whose daughter <a href="Mary_Beatrice_d&#39;Este" title="wikilink">Mary Beatrice d'Este</a>, was the queen consort of <a href="James_II_of_England" title="wikilink">James II &amp; VII of England and Scotland</a></p>
<p>Eugene had an unstable childhood due to his father's death when he was ten and his mother's banishment from France in the aftermath of the <a href="Poison_affair" title="wikilink">Poison affair</a> when he was seventeen.</p>
<p>Originally destined for the <a href="Roman_Catholic_Church" title="wikilink">Roman Catholic Church</a>, Eugene was known at court as the <em>petit abb&lt;U+00E9&gt;</em> (<a href="English_language" title="wikilink">English</a>: the little abbot or priest), but personally he preferred the army. His repeated applications for a commission were refused by Louis XIV, possibly due to Eugene's slight build and his mother's disgrace.</p>
<p>Whatever the reason, Eugene left France in disgust with a personal hatred for Louis XIV. His destination was Austria, where his older brother Louis-Jules already served as colonel of a dragoon regiment. There was need for soldiers in Austria because the <a href="Ottoman_Empire" title="wikilink">Ottoman Turks</a> were besieging Vienna itself.</p>
<p>Before he could reach Austria his brother was killed in battle with the Turks, so Eugene now hoped to take over the regiment after his brother. When Eugene reached Emperor <a href="Leopold_I,_Holy_Roman_Emperor" title="wikilink">Leopold I</a> in Passau the regiment already had a new commander, but the emperor gave Eugene a <a href="Commissioned_officer" title="wikilink">commission</a> in a cavalry regiment.</p>
<h2 id="turkish-wars">Turkish Wars</h2>
<p>Eugene distinguished himself quickly in a cavalry skirmish at Petronell on <a href="July_7" title="wikilink">July 7</a>, <a href="1683" class="uri" title="wikilink">1683</a>. He also took part in the <a href="Battle_of_Vienna" title="wikilink">Relief of Vienna</a>, after which he got his own <a href="Dragoon" class="uri" title="wikilink">Dragoon</a> regiment.</p>
<p>In the capture of Buda, Eugene was wounded, but continued to serve until the siege of Belgrade where he was more seriously wounded. After that he returned to Vienna.</p>
<h2 id="war-of-the-grand-alliance">War of the Grand Alliance</h2>
<p>The capture of Belgrade was the end of the Austrian offensive against the Turks. The army was needed to resist the ambitions of Louis XIV. So Eugene went with the army to Italy to cooperate with his relative, the Duke of Savoy. When the Duke of Savoy defected from the coalition, further war in Italy was abandoned and Eugene returned to Vienna.</p>
<h2 id="battle-of-zenta">Battle of Zenta</h2>
<p>When Eugene came back from Italy in 1697 he received command of the army in Hungary. Since the capture of Belgrade the Turks had rebounded and recaptured it in 1690.</p>
<p>It was his first independent command and it turned out to be a good decision, as Eugene, after some skilful manoeuvres, surprised the Ottomans at the <a href="Battle_of_Zenta" title="wikilink">Battle of Zenta</a> near <a href="Senta" class="uri" title="wikilink">Senta</a> (today <a href="Serbia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Serbia</a>). The victory was one of the most complete and important ever won by Austria, leading to the <a href="Treaty_of_Karlowitz" title="wikilink">Treaty of Karlowitz</a> in <a href="Sremski_Karlovci" title="wikilink">Karlovci</a> (today <a href="Serbia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Serbia</a>) in 1699. The peace that followed would be a short one, as the Spanish king <a href="Charles_II_of_Spain" title="wikilink">Charles II</a> lay dying and the succession had not been settled.</p>
<h2 id="war-of-the-spanish-succession">War of the Spanish Succession</h2>
<p>In the opening shots of that war, Eugene defeated French armies in northern Italy. As the area of French offensive action moved north, and as the war spread to include other nations such as <a href="England" class="uri" title="wikilink">England</a>, Eugene joined forces for the first time with his English counterpart, the <a href="John_Churchill,_1st_Duke_of_Marlborough" title="wikilink">Duke of Marlborough</a>. Together they defeated the French in <a href="Bavaria" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bavaria</a> at the <a href="Battle_of_Blenheim" title="wikilink">Battle of Blenheim</a> (<a href="1704" class="uri" title="wikilink">1704</a>). For the next three years he was engaged in fighting in northern <a href="Italy" class="uri" title="wikilink">Italy</a> and <a href="Provence" class="uri" title="wikilink">Provence</a>, were he suffered defeats in <a href="Battle_of_Cassano_(1705)" title="wikilink">Cassano</a>, but finally he defeated French armies in the decisive <a href="battle_of_Turin" title="wikilink">battle of Turin</a> (<a href="1706" class="uri" title="wikilink">1706</a>), after which Louis XIV had to withdraw all French forces from Italy. Eugene attacked French Toulon on 1707, but siege was unsuccessful.</p>
<p>Eugene then moved north to Flanders, where he joined up with Marlborough to win the battles of <a href="Battle_of_Oudenarde" title="wikilink">Oudenarde</a> and <a href="Battle_of_Malplaquet" title="wikilink">Malplaquet</a>. The follow-up invasion of France that would have ended the war was blunted by the phrrhic victory of Malplaquet. Britain signed the <a href="The_Treaty_of_Utrecht" title="wikilink">The Treaty of Utrecht</a> with France in 1713 which left Austria and Eugene were left to face France alone. After one more year of fighting, Austria signed a favourable peace with France, in 1714.</p>
<h2 id="later-life">Later life</h2>
<p>Also in 1714, Eugene began construction of the <a href="Belvedere_(palace)" title="wikilink">Belvedere</a>, a <a href="baroque" class="uri" title="wikilink">baroque</a> palace in the 3rd district of Vienna. Construction of various parts of the palace complex continued until <a href="1723" class="uri" title="wikilink">1723</a>. Eugene never married, something that was highly unusual at the time; there is in fact not a single recorded relationship of any kind. He may very well have lived in <a href="celibacy" class="uri" title="wikilink">celibacy</a> his entire life.</p>
<p><img src="Wien_Prinz_Eugen_Reiterdenkmal_Heldenplatz.jpg" title="fig:Monument to Prince Eugen at the Heldenplatz in Vienna." alt="Monument to Prince Eugen at the Heldenplatz in Vienna." /> One of the new Austrian possessions after the War of the Spanish Succession was the former Spanish, now <a href="Austrian_Netherlands" title="wikilink">Austrian Netherlands</a>. Eugene was made <a href="Governors_of_the_Habsburg_Netherlands" title="wikilink">governor</a> of this area, then later became vicar of the Austrian lands in Italy. Just two years after the end of the war against France, Eugene led the Austrian armies during the <a href="Austro-Turkish_War_of_1716-18" title="wikilink">Austro-Turkish War of 1716-18</a>. With the <em><a href="Battle_of_Petrovaradin" title="wikilink">Victorys of Peterwardein</a></em> Hungary was freed from the Turkish and the Stronghold of <a href="Belgrade" class="uri" title="wikilink">Belgrade</a> was captured by Eugene <a href="august_22" title="wikilink">august 22</a> <a href="1717" class="uri" title="wikilink">1717</a>, attacking them unexpectedly over a pontoon bridge. This victory is eternalized in the traditional song <em>Prinz Eugen, der edle Ritter (Prince Eugene, the noble knight)</em> and commemorated with the founding of the Timi&lt;U+015F&gt;oreana brewery. The <em>Battle of Belgrade</em> led to the <a href="Treaty_of_Passarowitz" title="wikilink">Treaty of Passarowitz</a>, which temporarily added northern <a href="Serbia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Serbia</a> and the <a href="Bosnia_Province,_Ottoman_Empire" title="wikilink">Bosnian</a> bank of the <a href="Sava" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sava</a> river to the Austrian crown, and ended the Turkish threats to Vienna once and for all. Late in his life, Eugene engaged in one last war, the <a href="War_of_the_Polish_Succession" title="wikilink">War of the Polish Succession</a>.</p>
<p>Eugene died in Vienna in 1736, in his sleep, after a night of playing <a href="cards" class="uri" title="wikilink">cards</a> with his old friend, the Countess Batthyany. A legend maintains that a lion in his palace <a href="zoo" class="uri" title="wikilink">zoo</a> died the same night. Eugene is buried in a chapel of honor in <a href="St._Stephen&#39;s_Cathedral,_Vienna" title="wikilink">St. Stephen's Cathedral</a>.</p>
<h2 id="legacy">Legacy</h2>
<p>At his death, Eugene was one of the wealthiest men in Europe. His fortune passed to his niece, <a href="Princess_Victoria_of_Savoy-Carignan" title="wikilink">Princess Victoria of Savoy-Carignan</a>, whom he had never met. She sold his extensive <a href="library" class="uri" title="wikilink">library</a> to the Austrian <a href="emperor" class="uri" title="wikilink">emperor</a>, and it formed the core of what is today the Austrian <a href="National_Library" title="wikilink">National Library</a>.</p>
<p>In a tribute to his military skill he was named by <a href="Napoleon" class="uri" title="wikilink">Napoleon</a> as one of the seven generals whose' campaigns were worthy of study.</p>

<h2 id="lernet-holenia-on-eugene">Lernet-Holenia on Eugene</h2>
<p>The Encyclopaedia Britannica article on Prince Eugene of Savoy contains the following:</p>
<dl>

<dd>Even as he faced a world of foes before him, he had a world of enemies at his back, nourished by the &quot;hereditary curse&quot; of Austria: slothful souls and thoughtless minds, low intrigue, envy, jealousy, foolishness, and dishonesty. He served three emperors: Leopold I, Joseph I, and Charles VI. Toward the end of his life, Eugene observed that, whereas the first had been a father to him and the second a brother, the third (who was perhaps least worthy of so great a servant) had been a master.
