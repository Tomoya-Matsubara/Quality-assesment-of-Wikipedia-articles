<p><img src="Strawberryhill.jpg" title="fig:Strawberry Hill, an English villa in the &quot;Gothic revival&quot; style, built by seminal Gothic writer Horace Walpole" alt="Strawberry Hill, an English villa in the &quot;Gothic revival&quot; style, built by seminal Gothic writer Horace Walpole" width="300" /> <strong>Gothic fiction</strong> (sometimes referred to as <strong>Gothic horror</strong>) is a genre of literature that combines elements of both <a href="Horror_fiction" title="wikilink">horror</a> and <a href="Romance_(genre)" title="wikilink">romance</a>. As a genre, it is generally believed to have been invented by the English author <a href="Horace_Walpole" title="wikilink">Horace Walpole</a>, with his 1764 novel <em><a href="The_Castle_of_Otranto" title="wikilink">The Castle of Otranto</a></em>. The effect of Gothic fiction feeds on a pleasing sort of <a href="horror_and_terror" title="wikilink">terror</a>, an extension of <a href="Romanticism" title="wikilink">Romantic</a> literary pleasures that were relatively new at the time of Walpole's novel. <a href="Melodrama" class="uri" title="wikilink">Melodrama</a> and <a href="parody" class="uri" title="wikilink">parody</a> (including <a href="self-parody" class="uri" title="wikilink">self-parody</a>) were other long-standing features of the Gothic initiated by Walpole.</p>
<p>Gothic literature is intimately associated with the <a href="Gothic_Revival_architecture" title="wikilink">Gothic Revival architecture</a> of the same era. In a way similar to the gothic revivalists' rejection of the clarity and rationalism of the <a href="neoclassicism" title="wikilink">neoclassical</a> style of the <a href="Age_of_Enlightenment" title="wikilink">Enlightened</a> Establishment, the literary Gothic embodies an appreciation of the joys of extreme emotion, the thrills of fearfulness and awe inherent in the <a href="sublime_(philosophy)" title="wikilink">sublime</a>, and a quest for <em>atmosphere</em>. The ruins of gothic buildings gave rise to multiple linked emotions by representing the inevitable decay and collapse of human creations&lt;U+2014&gt;thus the urge to add fake ruins as eyecatchers in <a href="English_garden" title="wikilink">English landscape parks</a>. English Gothic writers often associated medieval buildings with what they saw as a dark and terrifying period, characterized by harsh laws enforced by torture, and with mysterious, fantastic, and <a href="superstition" title="wikilink">superstitious</a> rituals. In literature such <a href="Anti-Catholicism" class="uri" title="wikilink">Anti-Catholicism</a> had a European dimension featuring <a href="Roman_Catholic_Church" title="wikilink">Roman Catholic</a> excesses such as the <a href="Inquisition" class="uri" title="wikilink">Inquisition</a> (in southern European countries such as Italy and Spain).</p>
<p>Prominent features of Gothic fiction include terror (both psychological and physical), mystery, the <a href="supernatural" class="uri" title="wikilink">supernatural</a>, <a href="Ghosts_in_European_culture" title="wikilink">ghosts</a>, <a href="haunted_house" title="wikilink">haunted houses</a> and <a href="Gothic_architecture" title="wikilink">Gothic architecture</a>, <a href="castle" title="wikilink">castles</a>, <a href="darkness" class="uri" title="wikilink">darkness</a>, <a href="death" class="uri" title="wikilink">death</a>, <a href="decomposition" title="wikilink">decay</a>, <a href="Doppelg&lt;U+00E4&gt;nger" title="wikilink">doubles</a>, <a href="Insanity" title="wikilink">madness</a>, <a href="Secrecy" title="wikilink">secrets</a>, and <a href="heredity" title="wikilink">hereditary</a> <a href="curse" title="wikilink">curses</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="stock_character" title="wikilink">stock characters</a> of Gothic fiction include <a href="tyrant" title="wikilink">tyrants</a>, <a href="villain" title="wikilink">villains</a>, <a href="Wikt:bandit" title="wikilink">bandits</a>, <a href="Wikt:maniac" title="wikilink">maniacs</a>, <a href="Byronic_hero" title="wikilink">Byronic heroes</a>, <a href="Damsel_in_distress" title="wikilink">persecuted maidens</a>, <a href="femme_fatale" title="wikilink">femmes fatales</a>, <a href="monks" class="uri" title="wikilink">monks</a>, <a href="nuns" class="uri" title="wikilink">nuns</a>, <a href="Wikt:madwoman" title="wikilink">madwomen</a>, <a href="Magician_(fantasy)" title="wikilink">magicians</a>, <a href="vampire" title="wikilink">vampires</a>, <a href="werewolf" title="wikilink">werewolves</a>, <a href="monster" title="wikilink">monsters</a>, <a href="demon" title="wikilink">demons</a>, <a href="dragon" title="wikilink">dragons</a>, <a href="angel" title="wikilink">angels</a>, <a href="fallen_angel" title="wikilink">fallen angels</a>, <a href="revenant_(folklore)" title="wikilink">revenants</a>, <a href="ghosts" class="uri" title="wikilink">ghosts</a>, <a href="skeleton_(undead)" title="wikilink">perambulating skeletons</a>, the <a href="Wandering_Jew" title="wikilink">Wandering Jew</a> and the <a href="Devil" class="uri" title="wikilink">Devil</a> himself.</p>
<h2 id="parody">Parody</h2>
<p>The excesses, stereotypes, and frequent absurdities of the traditional Gothic made it rich territory for satire (Skarda 1986). The most famous parody of the Gothic is <a href="Jane_Austen" title="wikilink">Jane Austen's</a> novel <em><a href="Northanger_Abbey" title="wikilink">Northanger Abbey</a></em> (1818) in which the naive protagonist, after reading too much Gothic fiction, conceives herself a heroine of a Radcliffian romance and imagines murder and villainy on every side, though the truth turns out to be much more prosaic. Jane Austen's novel is valuable for including a list of early Gothic works since known as the <a href="Northanger_Horrid_Novels" title="wikilink">Northanger Horrid Novels</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li><em><a href="The_Necromancer;_or,_The_Tale_of_the_Black_Forest" title="wikilink">The Necromancer; or, The Tale of the Black Forest</a></em> (1794) by 'Ludwig Flammenberg' (pseudonym for Carl Friedrich Kahlert; translated by Peter Teuthold)</li>
<li><em><a href="Horrid_Mysteries" title="wikilink">Horrid Mysteries</a></em> (1796) by the Marquis de Grosse (translated by P. Will)</li>
<li><em><a href="The_Castle_of_Wolfenbach" title="wikilink">The Castle of Wolfenbach</a></em> (1793) by <a href="Eliza_Parsons" title="wikilink">Eliza Parsons</a></li>
<li><em><a href="The_Mysterious_Warning,_a_German_Tale" title="wikilink">The Mysterious Warning, a German Tale</a></em> (1796) by Eliza Parsons</li>
<li><em><a href="Clermont_(novel)" title="wikilink">Clermont</a></em> (1798) by <a href="Regina_Maria_Roche" title="wikilink">Regina Maria Roche</a></li>
<li><em><a href="The_Orphan_of_the_Rhine" title="wikilink">The Orphan of the Rhine</a></em> (1798) by Eleanor Sleath</li>
<li><em><a href="The_Midnight_Bell" title="wikilink">The Midnight Bell</a></em> (1798) by <a href="Francis_Lathom" title="wikilink">Francis Lathom</a></li>
</ul>
<p>These books, with their lurid titles, were once thought to be the creations of Jane Austen's imagination, though later research by <a href="Michael_Sadleir" title="wikilink">Michael Sadleir</a> and <a href="Montague_Summers" title="wikilink">Montague Summers</a> confirmed that they did actually exist and stimulated renewed interest in the Gothic. They are currently all being reprinted by Valancourt Press (Wright 2007: 29-32).</p>
<p>Another example of Gothic parody in a similar vein is <em>The Heroine</em> by <a href="Eaton_Stannard_Barrett" title="wikilink">Eaton Stannard Barrett</a> (1813). Cherry Wilkinson, a fatuous female protagonist with a history of novel-reading, fancies herself as the heroine of a Gothic romance. She perceives and models reality according to the stereotypes and typical plot structures of the Gothic novel, leading to a series of absurd events culminating in catastrophe. After her downfall, her affectations and excessive imaginations become eventually subdued by the voice of reason in the form of Stuart, a paternal figure, under whose guidance the protagonist receives a sound education and correction of her misguided taste (Skarda 1986).</p>
<h2 id="the-romantics">The Romantics</h2>
<p><img src="Frontispiece_to_Frankenstein_1831.jpg" title="fig:Mary Shelley&#39;s Frankenstein; or, the Modern Prometheus (1818) has come to define Gothic fiction in the Romantic period. Frontispiece to 1831 edition shown." alt="Mary Shelley&#39;s Frankenstein; or, the Modern Prometheus (1818) has come to define Gothic fiction in the Romantic period. Frontispiece to 1831 edition shown." /> Further contributions to the Gothic genre were provided in the work of the Romantic poets. Prominent examples include <a href="Samuel_Taylor_Coleridge" title="wikilink">Coleridge</a>'s <em><a href="The_Rime_of_the_Ancient_Mariner" title="wikilink">The Rime of the Ancient Mariner</a></em> and <em><a href="Christabel_(poem)" title="wikilink">Christabel</a></em> and <a href="John_Keats" title="wikilink">Keats'</a> <em><a href="La_Belle_Dame_sans_Merci" title="wikilink">La Belle Dame sans Merci</a></em> (1819) and <em><a href="Isabella,_or_the_Pot_of_Basil" title="wikilink">Isabella, or the Pot of Basil</a></em> (1820) which feature mysteriously fey ladies (Skarda and Jaffe 1981: 33-5, 132-3). In the latter poem the names of the characters, the dream visions and the macabre physical details are influenced by the novels of premiere Gothicist Anne Radcliffe (Skarda and Jaffe 1981: 132-3). <a href="Percy_Bysshe_Shelley" title="wikilink">Percy Bysshe Shelley</a>'s first published work was the Gothic novel <em><a href="Zastrozzi" class="uri" title="wikilink">Zastrozzi</a></em> (1810), about an outlaw obsessed with revenge against his father and half-brother. Shelley published a second Gothic novel in 1811, <em><a href="St._Irvyne;_or,_The_Rosicrucian" title="wikilink">St. Irvyne; or, The Rosicrucian</a></em>, about an alchemist who seeks to impart the secret of immortality.</p>
<p>The poetry, romantic adventures and character of <a href="George_Gordon_Byron,_6th_Baron_Byron" title="wikilink">Lord Byron</a>, characterised by his spurned lover <a href="Lady_Caroline_Lamb" title="wikilink">Lady Caroline Lamb</a> as 'mad, bad and dangerous to know' were another inspiration for the Gothic, providing the archetype of the <a href="Byronic_hero" title="wikilink">Byronic hero</a>. Byron features, under the codename of '<a href="Lord_Ruthven" title="wikilink">Lord Ruthven</a>', in Lady Caroline's own Gothic novel: <em><a href="Lady_Caroline_Lamb#Literary_career" title="wikilink">Glenarvon</a></em> (1816). Byron was also the host of the celebrated ghost-story competition involving himself, <a href="Percy_Bysshe_Shelley" title="wikilink">Percy Bysshe Shelley</a>, <a href="Mary_Shelley" title="wikilink">Mary Shelley</a>, and <a href="John_William_Polidori" title="wikilink">John William Polidori</a> at the Villa Diodati on the banks of <a href="Lake_Geneva" title="wikilink">Lake Geneva</a> in the summer of 1816. This occasion was productive of both Mary Shelley's <em><a href="Frankenstein" class="uri" title="wikilink">Frankenstein</a></em> (1818) and Polidori's <em><a href="The_Vampyre" title="wikilink">The Vampyre</a></em> (1819). This latter story revives Lamb's Byronic 'Lord Ruthven', but this time as a vampire. <em>The Vampyre</em> has been accounted by cultural critic Christopher Frayling as one of the most influential works of fiction ever written and spawned a craze for <a href="Vampire_literature" title="wikilink">vampire fiction</a> and theatre (and latterly film) which has not ceased to this day. Mary Shelley's novel, though clearly influenced by the gothic tradition, is often considered the first <a href="science_fiction" title="wikilink">science fiction</a> novel, despite the omission in the novel of any scientific explanation of the monster's animation and the focus instead on the moral issues and consequences of such a creation.</p>
<p>A late example of traditional Gothic is <em><a href="Melmoth_the_Wanderer" title="wikilink">Melmoth the Wanderer</a></em> (1820) by <a href="Charles_Maturin" title="wikilink">Charles Maturin</a> which combines themes of Anti-Catholicism with an outcast <a href="Byronic_hero" title="wikilink">Byronic hero</a> (Varma 1986).</p>
<h2 id="victorian-gothic">Victorian Gothic</h2>
<p><img src="Edgar_Allan_Poe_2.jpg" title="fig:Edgar Allan Poe was an important reinterpreter of Gothic fiction." alt="Edgar Allan Poe was an important reinterpreter of Gothic fiction." /> By the Victorian era Gothic had ceased to be the dominant genre (in fact the form's popularity as an established genre had already begun to erode with the success of the historical romance popularised by Sir <a href="Walter_Scott" title="wikilink">Walter Scott</a>). However, in many ways, it was now entering its most creative phase. Recently readers and critics have begun to reconsider a number of previously overlooked Penny Blood or <a href="Penny_Dreadful" title="wikilink">Penny Dreadful</a> serial fictions by such authors such as <a href="George_W._M._Reynolds" title="wikilink">G.W.M. Reynolds</a> who wrote a trilogy of Gothic horror novels: <em>Faust</em> (1846), <em>Wagner the Wehr-wolf</em> (1847) and <em>The Necromancer</em> (1857) (Baddeley 2002: 143-4). Reynolds was also responsible for <em><a href="The_Mysteries_of_London" title="wikilink">The Mysteries of London</a></em> which has been accorded an important place in the development of the urban as a particularly Victorian Gothic setting, an area within which interesting links can be made with established readings of the work of Dickens and others. Another famous penny dreadful of this era was the anonymously authored <em><a href="Varney_the_Vampire" title="wikilink">Varney the Vampire</a></em> (1847). The formal relationship between these fictions, serialised for predominantly working class audiences, and the roughly contemporaneous sensation fictions serialised in middle class periodicals is also an area worthy of inquiry. Influential critics, above all <a href="John_Ruskin" title="wikilink">John Ruskin</a>, far from denouncing mediaeval obscurantism, praised the imagination and fantasy exemplified by its gothic architecture, influencing the <a href="Pre-Raphaelite_Brotherhood" title="wikilink">Pre-Raphaelites</a>.</p>
<p>An important and innovative reinterpreter of the Gothic in this period was <a href="Edgar_Allan_Poe" title="wikilink">Edgar Allan Poe</a> who believed 'that terror is not of Germany, but of the soul'. His story &quot;<a href="The_Fall_of_the_House_of_Usher" title="wikilink">The Fall of the House of Usher</a>&quot; (1839) explores these 'terrors of the soul' whilst revisiting classic Gothic tropes of aristocratic decay, death, and madness (Skarda and Jaffe 1981: 181-2). The legendary villainy of the <a href="Spanish_Inquisition" title="wikilink">Spanish Inquisition</a>, previously explored by Gothicists Radcliffe, Lewis, and Maturin, is revisited in &quot;<a href="The_Pit_and_the_Pendulum" title="wikilink">The Pit and the Pendulum</a>&quot; (1842). The influence of Ann Radcliffe is also detectable in Poe's &quot;<a href="The_Oval_Portrait" title="wikilink">The Oval Portrait</a>&quot; (1842), including an honorary mention of her name in the text of the story.</p>
<p>The influence of Byronic Romanticism evident in Poe is also apparent in the work of the Bront&lt;U+00EB&gt; sisters. <a href="Emily_Bront&lt;U+00EB&gt;" title="wikilink">Emily Bront&lt;U+00EB&gt;</a>'s <em><a href="Wuthering_Heights" title="wikilink">Wuthering Heights</a></em> (1847) transports the Gothic to the forbidding Yorkshire Moors and features ghostly apparitions and a Byronic hero in the person of the demonic Heathcliff whilst <a href="Charlotte_Bront&lt;U+00EB&gt;" title="wikilink">Charlotte Bront&lt;U+00EB&gt;</a>'s <em><a href="Jane_Eyre" title="wikilink">Jane Eyre</a></em> (1847) adds <em><a href="The_Madwoman_in_the_Attic" title="wikilink">the madwoman in the attic</a></em> (<a href="Sandra_Gilbert" title="wikilink">Sandra Gilbert</a> and <a href="Susan_Gubar" title="wikilink">Susan Gubar</a> 1979) to the cast of gothic fiction. The Bront&lt;U+00EB&gt;s' fiction is seen by some feminist critics as prime examples of Female Gothic, exploring woman's entrapment within domestic space and subjection to patriarchal authority and the transgressive and dangerous attempts to subvert and escape such restriction. Charlotte's Jane Eyre and Emily's Cathy are both examples of female protagonists in such a role (Jackson 1981: 123-29). <a href="Louisa_May_Alcott" title="wikilink">Louisa May Alcott</a>'s gothic potboiler, <em><a href="A_Long_Fatal_Love_Chase" title="wikilink">A Long Fatal Love Chase</a></em> (written in 1866, but published in 1995) is also an interesting specimen of this subgenre.</p>
<p><a href="Elizabeth_Gaskell" title="wikilink">Elizabeth Gaskell's</a> tales &quot;The Doom of the Griffiths&quot; (1858) &quot;Lois the Witch&quot;, and &quot;The Grey Woman&quot; all employ one of the most common themes of Gothic fiction, the power of ancestral sins to curse future generations, or the fear that they will.</p>
<p>The gloomy villain, forbidding mansion, and persecuted heroine of <a href="Sheridan_Le_Fanu" title="wikilink">Sheridan Le Fanu</a>'s <em><a href="Uncle_Silas" title="wikilink">Uncle Silas</a></em> (1864) shows the direct influence of both Walpole's <em>Otranto</em> and Radcliffe's <em>Udolpho</em>. Le Fanu's short story collection <em><a href="In_a_Glass_Darkly" title="wikilink">In a Glass Darkly</a></em> (1872) includes the superlative vampire tale <em><a href="Carmilla" class="uri" title="wikilink">Carmilla</a></em>, which provided fresh blood for that particular strand of the Gothic and influenced <a href="Bram_Stoker" title="wikilink">Bram Stoker's</a> <em><a href="Dracula" class="uri" title="wikilink">Dracula</a></em> (1897). According to literary critic <a href="Terry_Eagleton" title="wikilink">Terry Eagleton</a>, Le Fanu, together with his predecessor Maturin and his successor Stoker, form a sub-genre of Irish Gothic, whose stories, featuring castles set in a barren landscape, with a cast of remote aristocrats dominating an atavistic peasantry, represent in allegorical form the political plight of colonial Ireland subjected to the <a href="Protestant_Ascendancy" title="wikilink">Protestant Ascendancy</a> (Eagleton 1995).</p>
<p>The genre was also a heavy influence on more mainstream writers, such as <a href="Charles_Dickens" title="wikilink">Charles Dickens</a>, who read gothic novels as a teenager and incorporated their gloomy atmosphere and melodrama into his own works, shifting them to a more modern period and an urban setting, including <em><a href="Oliver_Twist" title="wikilink">Oliver Twist</a></em> (1837-8), <em><a href="Bleak_House" title="wikilink">Bleak House</a></em> (1854) (Mighall 2003) and <em><a href="Great_Expectations" title="wikilink">Great Expectations</a></em> (1860&lt;U+2013&gt;61). These pointed to the juxtaposition of wealthy, ordered and affluent civilisation next to the disorder and barbarity of the poor within the same metropolis. Bleak House in particular is credited with seeing the introduction of <a href="smog" title="wikilink">urban fog</a> to the novel, which would become a frequent characteristic of urban Gothic literature and film (Mighall 2007). His most explicitly Gothic work is his last novel <em><a href="The_Mystery_of_Edwin_Drood" title="wikilink">The Mystery of Edwin Drood</a></em> (1870). The mood and themes of the gothic novel held a particular fascination for the Victorians, with their morbid obsession with <a href="mourning" title="wikilink">mourning rituals</a>, <a href="Memento_mori" title="wikilink">Mementos</a>, and <a href="wikt:mortality" title="wikilink">mortality</a> in general.</p>

<p>The 1880s, saw the revival of the Gothic as a powerful literary form allied to <a href="Decadent_movement" title="wikilink">&quot;fin de siecle&quot; decadence</a>, which fictionalized contemporary fears like ethical degeneration and questioned the social structures of the time.

Other books by du Maurier, such as <em><a href="Jamaica_Inn_(novel)" title="wikilink">Jamaica Inn</a></em> (1936), also display Gothic tendencies.

Another example is British writer <a href="Peter_O&#39;Donnell" title="wikilink">Peter O'Donnell</a>, who wrote under the pseudonym Madeleine Brent. Outside of companies like Lovespell, who carry <a href="Colleen_Shannon" title="wikilink">Colleen Shannon</a>, very few books seem to be published using the term today.</p>

<p>The genre also influenced <a href="American_literature" title="wikilink">American writing</a> to create the <a href="Southern_Gothic" title="wikilink">Southern Gothic</a> genre, which combines some Gothic sensibilities (such as the <a href="Grotesque" class="uri" title="wikilink">Grotesque</a>) with the setting and style of the <a href="Southern_United_States" title="wikilink">Southern United States</a> . Examples include <a href="William_Faulkner" title="wikilink">William Faulkner</a>, <a href="Eudora_Welty" title="wikilink">Eudora Welty</a>, <a href="Harper_Lee" title="wikilink">Harper Lee</a>, and <a href="Flannery_O&#39;Connor" title="wikilink">Flannery O'Connor</a> (Skarda and Jaffe 1981: 418-56). Contemporary American writers in this tradition include <a href="Joyce_Carol_Oates" title="wikilink">Joyce Carol Oates</a>, in such novels as <em><a href="Bellefleur" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bellefleur</a></em> and <em>A Bloodsmoor Romance</em> and short story collections such as <em>Night-Side</em> (Skarda 1986b) and <a href="Raymond_Kennedy" title="wikilink">Raymond Kennedy</a> in his novel <em>Lulu Incognito</em>. The <a href="Southern_Ontario_Gothic" title="wikilink">Southern Ontario Gothic</a> applies a similar sensibility to a Canadian cultural context. <a href="Robertson_Davies" title="wikilink">Robertson Davies</a>, <a href="Alice_Munro" title="wikilink">Alice Munro</a>, <a href="Barbara_Gowdy" title="wikilink">Barbara Gowdy</a>, and <a href="Margaret_Atwood" title="wikilink">Margaret Atwood</a> have all produced works that are notable exemplars of this form. Another writer in this tradition was <a href="Henry_Farrell" title="wikilink">Henry Farrell</a> whose best-known work was the Hollywood horror novel <em><a href="What_Ever_Happened_to_Baby_Jane?" title="wikilink">What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?</a></em> (1960). Farrel's novels spawned a sub-genre of 'Grande Dame Guignol' in the cinema, dubbed the '<a href="Psycho-biddy" class="uri" title="wikilink">Psycho-biddy</a>' genre.</p>
<p>Other notable contemporary writers in the Gothic tradition are: <a href="Susan_Hill" title="wikilink">Susan Hill</a>, author of <em><a href="The_Woman_in_Black" title="wikilink">The Woman in Black</a></em> (1983); <a href="Patrick_McGrath_(novelist)" title="wikilink">Patrick McGrath</a>, author of <em><a href="The_Grotesque_(novel)" title="wikilink">The Grotesque</a></em> (1989); <a href="Poppy_Z._Brite" title="wikilink">Poppy Z. Brite</a>, author of <em><a href="Lost_Souls_(novel)" title="wikilink">Lost Souls</a></em> (1992) and <em><a href="Exquisite_Corpse_(novel)" title="wikilink">Exquisite Corpse</a></em> (1996); <a href="Caitlin_Kiernan" title="wikilink">Caitlin Kiernan</a> author of <em>Silk</em> (1998) (Davenport-Hines 1998: 377-8; Baddeley 2002: 84-7).</p>
<p>The themes of the literary Gothic have been translated into other media such as the theatre and had a notable revival in twentieth century gothic horror films such the classic <a href="Universal_Monsters" title="wikilink">Universal Horror</a> films of the 1930s, <a href="Hammer_Film_Productions" title="wikilink">Hammer Horror</a>, and <a href="Roger_Corman" title="wikilink">Roger Corman</a>'s <a href="Template:Cormanpoe" title="wikilink">Poe cycle</a> (Davenport-Hines 1998: 355-8). Twentieth century <a href="rock_and_roll" title="wikilink">rock and roll</a> music also had its gothic side. <a href="Black_Sabbath" title="wikilink">Black Sabbath</a>'s 1969 debut album created a dark sound different from other bands at the time and has been called the first ever &quot;Goth-rock&quot; record (Baddeley 2002: 264). Themes from gothic writers such as <a href="H._P._Lovecraft" title="wikilink">H. P. Lovecraft</a> were also used among <a href="gothic_rock" title="wikilink">gothic rock</a> and <a href="heavy_metal_music" title="wikilink">heavy metal</a> bands, especially in <a href="black_metal" title="wikilink">black metal</a>, <a href="thrash_metal" title="wikilink">thrash metal</a> (<a href="Metallica" class="uri" title="wikilink">Metallica</a>'s <em>The Call of Ktulu</em>), <a href="death_metal" title="wikilink">death metal</a>, and <a href="gothic_metal" title="wikilink">gothic metal</a>. For example, heavy metal musician <a href="King_Diamond" title="wikilink">King Diamond</a> delights in telling stories full of horror, theatricality, <a href="satanism" class="uri" title="wikilink">satanism</a> and <a href="anti-Catholicism" class="uri" title="wikilink">anti-Catholicism</a> in his compositions (Baddeley 2002: 265). In <a href="Bollywood" title="wikilink">Hindi cinema</a>, the gothic tradition was combined with aspects of <a href="Culture_of_India" title="wikilink">Indian culture</a>, particularly <a href="reincarnation" class="uri" title="wikilink">reincarnation</a>, to give rise to an &quot;Indian gothic&quot; genre, beginning with the films <em><a href="Mahal_(1949_film)" title="wikilink">Mahal</a></em> (1949) and <em><a href="Madhumati" class="uri" title="wikilink">Madhumati</a></em> (1958).<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
