<p><strong><em>Ed Wood</em></strong> is a <a href="biopic" class="uri" title="wikilink">biopic</a> directed by <a href="Tim_Burton" title="wikilink">Tim Burton</a>, starring <a href="Johnny_Depp" title="wikilink">Johnny Depp</a> as the cross-dressing cult movie maker <a href="Edward_D._Wood,_Jr." title="wikilink">Edward D. Wood, Jr.</a> The film, shot in black and white, was made in <a href="1994_in_film" title="wikilink">1994</a> and based in large part on <a href="Rudolph_Grey" title="wikilink">Rudolph Grey</a>'s biography <em>Nightmare of Ecstasy</em>. The film focuses on the period in Ed's life when he made his best-known films, and also his relationship with <a href="Bela_Lugosi" title="wikilink">Bela Lugosi</a> (played by <a href="Academy_Awards" title="wikilink">Oscar</a> winner <a href="Martin_Landau" title="wikilink">Martin Landau</a>), the down-on-his luck actor who had starred as <a href="Dracula" class="uri" title="wikilink">Dracula</a> in the eponymous film. Though a box office failure at the time of its release, it was critically hailed<a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/ed_wood/">1</a> and has subsequently been voted onto <a href="IMDB" class="uri" title="wikilink">IMDB</a>'s &quot;top 250&quot; by its users.

<p>The film includes cameo appearances from actors who had worked with Wood on <em>Plan 9 From Outer Space</em>. <a href="Conrad_Brooks" title="wikilink">Conrad Brooks</a> (who played one of the comic policemen) appears as a bartender, and <a href="Gregory_Walcott" title="wikilink">Gregory Walcott</a> (who played the hero) appears as one of the potential financiers of <em>Bride of the Monster</em>.

<p><em>Ed Wood</em> and <em><a href="Sweeney_Todd_(2007_film)" title="wikilink">Sweeney Todd</a></em> are the only Tim Burton films not to have a score written by <a href="Danny_Elfman" title="wikilink">Danny Elfman</a>; the soundtrack for <em>Ed Wood</em> was by <a href="Howard_Shore" title="wikilink">Howard Shore</a>.</p>
<h2 id="factual-inaccuracies">Factual inaccuracies</h2>


<p>Although the film is avowedly stylized and heightened for comic effect, most of the events it depicts are fairly close to reality, despite their oddness. Still, there are some departures from truth.</p>
<p>In Burton's film, <a href="Dolores_Fuller" title="wikilink">Dolores Fuller</a> learns of Wood's transvestitism after reading the screenplay for <em><a href="Glen_or_Glenda" title="wikilink">Glen or Glenda</a></em>. In reality, she remained unaware until the film was finished.</p>
<p>The film implies that Glen or Glenda was the first film ever written or directed by Wood. In reality, Wood wrote and directed <em>Streets of Laredo</em> in 1948; wrote, produced and directed <em>The Sun Was Setting</em> in 1951 and wrote <em>Lawless Rider</em> in 1952.</p>
<p>Burton depicts <a href="Tor_Johnson" title="wikilink">Tor Johnson</a> as a newcomer to the movies whom Wood &quot;discovers&quot; around the time of the production of <em><a href="Bride_of_the_Monster" title="wikilink">Bride of the Monster</a></em> in 1955. In fact, Johnson had acted in films since at least 1934, appearing in a number of films in uncredited roles. Johnson is also seen at the premiere of <em><a href="Plan_9_from_Outer_Space" title="wikilink">Plan 9 from Outer Space</a></em> with two plump young children (this was a sight gag) when, in reality, his children were adults by that time. In fact his son secured the police uniforms for the film.</p>
<p>Contrary to Burton's film, the Baptists who sponsored <em>Plan 9</em> were not opposed to the title <em>Graverobbers From Outer Space</em>. The exact circumstances are unknown, but the film, which took three years to release, was distributed as <em>Plan 9 From Outer Space</em> without any acknowledgment of the congregation. It is possible that Wood, or his distributor, were trying to avoid paying royalties. <a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> In addition, although the entire cast was baptized, only Tor Johnson's baptismal took place in a pool due to his size.</p>
<p>Bunny Breckinridge is depicted as an old friend of Ed Wood's, but in fact they did not meet until the filming of <em>Plan 9</em>, after being introduced through mutual friend <a href="Paul_Marco" title="wikilink">Paul Marco</a>. Similarly, Marco was in fact introduced to Wood by Criswell.</p>
<p>In order to give the film a somewhat uplifting ending, the script takes its most serious licenses at the end. Wood never met Orson Welles at the <a href="Musso_&amp;_Frank_Grill" title="wikilink">Musso &amp; Frank Grill</a>,<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> though this scene was most likely done to show the common troubles between the two directors, despite their status in the film world. <em>Plan 9</em> also did not have the glamorous premiere depicted. In fact it was not released at all until three years after its completion.</p>
<h3 id="bela-lugosi">Bela Lugosi</h3>
<p>Most points of contention, if any, with the film's liberties have had to do with the depiction of <a href="Bela_Lugosi" title="wikilink">Bela Lugosi</a>. Lugosi's son, <a href="Bela_Lugosi_Jr." title="wikilink">Bela Lugosi Jr.</a> initially disapproved of his father's portrayal in the film, despite not having seen it. After a long correspondence with Martin Landau, Lugosi, Jr. was persuaded to view the film in Landau's company, after which he declared that Landau had &quot;honored&quot; his father with his portrayal, and the actor and the late star's son became friends as a result. Among the inaccuracies:</p>
<p>Being an old fashioned European, Lugosi was not prone to fits of swearing, particularly in front of women. When <a href="Tim_Burton" title="wikilink">Tim Burton</a> realized how funny it sounded hearing Lugosi shout curse words, he decided to clean up the language of the other characters to spotlight the joke.</p>
<p>Lugosi never expressed his opinion of <a href="Boris_Karloff" title="wikilink">Boris Karloff</a>. At worst, they could be called professional rivals, but certainly not enemies.</p>
<p>Lugosi is depicted as living in the <a href="Baldwin_Hills,_Los_Angeles,_California" title="wikilink">Baldwin Hills</a> neighborhood in southwestern <a href="Los_Angeles" title="wikilink">Los Angeles</a>. In reality, Lugosi lived in <a href="Los_Feliz,_Los_Angeles,_California" title="wikilink">Los Feliz</a>, a Los Angeles neighborhood near <a href="Hollywood,_Los_Angeles,_California" title="wikilink">Hollywood</a>, at the time, and never lived in Baldwin Hills. This inaccuracy in the film may have been a deliberate aesthetic choice on Burton's part, because of Burton's love of 1950s <a href="suburban" class="uri" title="wikilink">suburban</a> architecture, quite common in Baldwin Hills, most of which was developed after <a href="World_War_II" title="wikilink">World War II</a>, but rare in Los Feliz, which was developed in the 1910s and 1920s.</p>
<p>Lugosi's wife of 20 years, Lillian, did leave him in 1953, but he remarried in 1955 to <a href="Hope_Lininger" title="wikilink">Hope Lininger</a>. They were together until his death a year later, but the marriage was largely unsuccessful. This fact, plus any reference to Lugosi's teenage son, Bela Jr., are omitted.</p>
<p>The scene of Lugosi freezing up on television is loosely based on a 1954 incident on <a href="Milton_Berle" title="wikilink">Milton Berle</a>'s show. Berle began ad-libbing and Lugosi, being almost deaf at this point and a stickler to scripts, simply continued his dialogue while attempting to ignore Berle. Though a very awkward moment, the sketch did not grind to a halt as shown in the film.</p>
<p>The attempted suicide by Lugosi depicted in the film is based on an account given by Ed Wood, but his is the only testimony of this incident. Most of Lugosi's friends and family have stated that he was deeply afraid of death and suicide would be completely against his nature.</p>
<p>Wood had no direct connection with Lugosi entering a rehabilitation center, though he did visit him often.</p>
<p>The account of Lugosi having to leave the hospital prematurely is only partially accurate. Lugosi was asked to leave the Motion Picture Country Home Hospital due to ineligibility after three weeks, so he quickly checked into Los Angeles General Hospital. There, he made a full recovery and newsreel footage exists of him leaving under his own power.</p>
<p>In the film, the famous footage of Lugosi picking a flower takes place outside Lugosi's house. In reality, the house belonged to <a href="Tor_Johnson" title="wikilink">Tor Johnson</a>.</p>
<p>In the movie, Lugosi's funeral is attended only by Ed Wood and his acolytes. In reality, Lugosi's funeral was well-attended by his family and numerous friends, though the ceremony was comparatively low-key to most Hollywood funerals.</p>

<h3 id="origins">Origins</h3>
<p><a href="Scott_Alexander_and_Larry_Karaszewski" title="wikilink">Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski</a> had been thinking about writing a screenplay on Ed Wood's life since they were students at the <a href="USC_School_of_Cinematic_Arts" title="wikilink">University of Southern California film school</a>.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> Alexander even proposed making a documentary about Wood entitled, <em>The Man in the Angora Sweater</em> in his sophomore year at <a href="University_of_Southern_California" title="wikilink">USC</a>.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> However, Karaszewski figured, &quot;there would be no one on the planet Earth who would make this movie or want to make this movie, because these aren't the sort of movies that are made.&quot;<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> After school, they became established Hollywood screenwriters known for the <em><a href="Problem_Child" title="wikilink">Problem Child</a></em> movie series. They wrote a ten-page treatment and pitched it to director <a href="Michael_Lehmann" title="wikilink">Michael Lehmann</a> who had also gone to USC. Karaszewski remembers that they sold it as &quot;the guys who wrote <em>Problem Child</em> and the guy who directed <em><a href="Hudson_Hawk" title="wikilink">Hudson Hawk</a></em> making a movie about the worst filmmaker of all time.&quot;<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> Lehmann showed the treatment to producer <a href="Denise_DiNovi" title="wikilink">Denise DiNovi</a> and a deal was struck where Lehmann would direct and Tim Burton and DiNovi would produce.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> Burton was due to direct the <a href="Jekyll_and_Hyde" title="wikilink">Jekyll and Hyde</a> adaptation movie, <em><a href="Mary_Reilly_(film)" title="wikilink">Mary Reilly</a></em>, and was staying in <a href="Poughkeepsie,_New_York" title="wikilink">Poughkeepsie</a>, <a href="New_York" title="wikilink">New York</a> when he was approached with the offer to produce <em>Ed Wood</em>.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> The director began reading <em>Nightmare of Ecstasy</em> by Rudolph Grey (ISBN 0-922915-24-5), a full-length <a href="biography" class="uri" title="wikilink">biography</a>, which draws on interviews from Wood's family and colleagues. Alexander and Karaszewski wrote a 147-page script in six weeks, working 14-hour days, seven days a week<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> and this got Burton interested in directing the film.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> The deciding factor for the filmmaker came when the studio wanted to make <em>Mary Reilly</em> sooner than he would have liked and starring <a href="Julia_Roberts" title="wikilink">Julia Roberts</a> instead of his choice, <a href="Winona_Ryder" title="wikilink">Winona Ryder</a>.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> Burton decided to abandon the project and to direct <em>Ed Wood</em> instead with Lehmann moving to direct <em><a href="Airheads" class="uri" title="wikilink">Airheads</a></em>.</p>
<h3 id="burton-and-wood">Burton and Wood</h3>
<p>Burton admits to having always been a fan of Ed Wood, which is why the biopic is filmed with a certain sympathy and admiration rather than derision of Wood's work. Burton acknowledged that he probably portrayed Wood and his crew in an exaggeratedly sympathetic way, stating he did not want to ridicule people who had already been ridiculed for a good deal of their life. He said in an interview, &quot;I've never seen anything like them, the kind of bad poetry and redundancy - saying in, like, five sentences what it would take most normal people one...Yet still there is a sincerity to them that is very unusual, and I always found that somewhat touching; it gives them a surreal, weirdly heartfelt feeling.&quot;<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> Burton's respect for Wood is also hinted at in his film <em><a href="Edward_Scissorhands" title="wikilink">Edward Scissorhands</a></em> - the director has stated that he named the lead character in the film <em>Edward</em> because that's Wood's full first name. The relationship between Wood and Lugosi in the script echoes closely Burton's relationship with his own idol and two-time colleague, <a href="Vincent_Price" title="wikilink">Vincent Price</a>. He said in an interview, &quot;Meeting Vincent had an incredible impact on me, the same impact Ed must have felt meeting and working with his idol.&quot;<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="pre-production">Pre-production</h3>
<p>The film was originally in development with <a href="Columbia_Pictures" title="wikilink">Columbia Pictures</a> but when Burton wanted to shoot it in black and white, the studio wasn't going to back it because they claimed it would be a hard sell in foreign markets and on video<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> and unless they had a first-look deal.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> The director insisted on total control and a month before shooting was scheduled to start, Columbia put the film in turnaround. <a href="Warner_Brothers" title="wikilink">Warner Brothers</a>, <a href="Paramount_Pictures" title="wikilink">Paramount Pictures</a>, and <a href="20th_Century_Fox" title="wikilink">20th Century Fox</a> became interested in optioning the film, but Burton went with <a href="Disney" class="uri" title="wikilink">Disney</a> because they gave him total creative control on the condition that he work for scale.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
<p><em>Ed Wood</em> gave Burton the opportunity to make a film that was more character-driven as opposed to style-driven. He said in an interview, &quot;On a picture like this I find you don't need to storyboard. You're working mainly with actors, and there's no effects going on, so it's best to be more spontaneous.&quot;<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
<p>To get a hold on his character, Martin Landau started with make-up tests with <a href="Rick_Baker" title="wikilink">Rick Baker</a>. He didn't use extensive make-up applications, only enough to resemble Lugosi and allow Landau to use his face to act and express emotion.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> For research, the actor watched 25 of Lugosi's films and seven interviews between the years of 1931 and 1956.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> According to the actor, he did not want to deliver an over-the-top performance. &quot;Lugosi was theatrical, but I never wanted the audience to feel I was an actor chewing the scenery...I felt it had to be Lugosi's theatricality, not mine.&quot;<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>
<p>To portray Wood, Burton called Johnny Depp and &quot;within 10 minutes of hearing about the project, I was committed,&quot; the actor remembers.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> To get a handle on how to portray Wood, Depp approached Burton who suggested <a href="Andy_Hardy" title="wikilink">Andy Hardy</a>. The actor said in an interview, &quot;So I saw some Andy Hardy stuff. I had a couple of other things that spiced it up a bit. I came to him and I said, 'Listen, Andy Hardy, but look <a href="Ronald_Reagan" title="wikilink">Ronald Reagan</a>.' And Tim went, <em>'<a href="The_Wizard_of_Oz_(1939_film)" title="wikilink">Wizard of Oz</a></em> or <a href="Casey_Kasem" title="wikilink">Casey Kasem</a>.'...We just boiled up this stew and shot it.&quot;<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a></p>
<p>Shooting began in August 1993 and lasted 72 days.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a></p>

<p>Opening in two theaters on <a href="September_30" title="wikilink">September 30</a>, <a href="1994" class="uri" title="wikilink">1994</a>, the film grossed $71,566 in its opening weekend and when it went into wide release on <a href="October_7" title="wikilink">October 7</a>, <a href="1994" class="uri" title="wikilink">1994</a> in 623 theaters, it grossed $1,903,768 in its opening weekend. As of <a href="May_31" title="wikilink">May 31</a>, <a href="2007" class="uri" title="wikilink">2007</a>, it has grossed $5,887,457 in <a href="North_America" title="wikilink">North America</a>, well below its estimated $18 million production budget.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> Despite the film being a commercial failure, Burton is very proud of the movie. He said, &quot;I love the movie...It's just that no one came. I guess if I was like everybody else, I would just blame a bad marketing campaign. But that's too easy.&quot;<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a></p>
<p>The film was also shown at the 1995 <a href="Cannes_Film_Festival" title="wikilink">Cannes Film Festival</a>.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a></p>
<p>Reviews were highly positive. As of <a href="September_16" title="wikilink">September 16</a>, <a href="2007" class="uri" title="wikilink">2007</a>, it was given a rating of 90% on <a href="Rotten_Tomatoes" title="wikilink">Rotten Tomatoes</a> (dropping to 67% for their &quot;Cream of the Crop&quot; designation).</p>
<p>In his review for the <em><a href="Boston_Globe" title="wikilink">Boston Globe</a></em>, Jay Carr wrote, &quot;Burton makes <em>Ed Wood</em> glow with conviction...Never has such a loser been transformed into such a winner.&quot;<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> Hal Hinson's review in the <em><a href="Washington_Post" title="wikilink">Washington Post</a></em> praised the film: &quot;Making a movie about the life of Ed Wood certainly qualifies as an impossible dream, but Burton has pulled it off with wit, imagination and something amazingly close to grace.&quot;<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a></p>
<p><a href="Kim_Newman" title="wikilink">Kim Newman</a>, in his review for <em><a href="Sight_and_Sound" title="wikilink">Sight and Sound</a></em> magazine, wrote, &quot;It is ironic that for all its anecdotal and elliptical approach, <em>Ed Wood</em> is Burton's most successful piece of proper storytelling.&quot;<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="dvd">DVD</h2>
<p>The <a href="DVD" class="uri" title="wikilink">DVD</a> edition of <em>Ed Wood</em> initially had difficulty reaching store shelves in <a href="North_America" title="wikilink">North America</a> due to unspecified legal issues. In February 2004, a DVD was shipped to stores, only to be recalled again without explanation—though some copies quickly found their way to collectors' venues such as <a href="eBay" class="uri" title="wikilink">eBay</a>. The DVD was finally released on <a href="October_19" title="wikilink">October 19</a>, <a href="2004" class="uri" title="wikilink">2004</a>, minus the transvestitism-themed featurette &quot;When Carol Met Larry&quot;, which is highly speculated was the reason for the legal woes. (Others claimed that Burton thought the featurette mocked transvestites, counter to the themes of the film.) However, on the Dutch edition of the DVD (and probably the rest of region 2) this featurette is present.</p>
<p>Another theory states that the producers did not have the legal right to release a film including the song &quot;Que Ser&lt;U+00E1&gt; Ser&lt;U+00E1&gt;&quot; on DVD. The song barely plays in the background of one scene, but is featured prominently in the cut sequences included.</p>
<p>Yet another theory is that it was due to a deleted scene where Lugosi refers to 'those bastards at Universal'. This is supported in that this scene can only be found as an <a href="Easter_egg_(media)" title="wikilink">Easter egg</a> on the final DVD release.</p>
