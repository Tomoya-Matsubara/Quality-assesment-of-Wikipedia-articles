<p><strong><em>Cimolopteryx</em></strong> (meaning &quot;Cretaceous wing&quot;<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>) is a prehistoric <a href="bird" class="uri" title="wikilink">bird</a> <a href="genus" class="uri" title="wikilink">genus</a> from the late <a href="Cretaceous" class="uri" title="wikilink">Cretaceous</a> Period. Remains attributed to <em>Cimolopteryx</em> have been found in the <a href="Frenchman_Formation" title="wikilink">Frenchman Formation</a> of <a href="Saskatchewan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Saskatchewan</a>, the <a href="Lance_Formation" title="wikilink">Lance Formation</a> of <a href="Wyoming" class="uri" title="wikilink">Wyoming</a>, the <a href="Fox_Hills_Formation" title="wikilink">Fox Hills Formation</a> of <a href="Colorado" class="uri" title="wikilink">Colorado</a> and possibly the <a href="Hell_Creek_Formation" title="wikilink">Hell Creek Formation</a> of <a href="Montana" class="uri" title="wikilink">Montana</a>. All date to the end of the <a href="Maastrichtian" class="uri" title="wikilink">Maastrichtian</a> age, about  million years ago.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> An additional specimen from the much earlier <a href="Dinosaur_Park_Formation" title="wikilink">Dinosaur Park Formation</a> of <a href="Alberta" class="uri" title="wikilink">Alberta</a> (mid <a href="Campanian" class="uri" title="wikilink">Campanian</a> age, about 75 million years ago) may belong to a new species of <em>Cimolopteryx</em>.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="description-and-history">Description and history</h2>
<p><em>Cimolopteryx</em> was a fairly small bird, with a maximum size about equal to that of a small <a href="gull" class="uri" title="wikilink">gull</a>.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> It is known almost exclusively from a number of <em>coracoids</em> (a bone in the shoulder girdle). These have a distinct enough anatomy, however, to allow it to be distinguished from other birds, and even for distinct species to be recognized. The first such coracoid to be found (specimen number <a href="Peabody_Museum_of_Natural_History" title="wikilink">YMP</a> 1845, in the collections of the <a href="Peabody_Museum_of_Natural_History" title="wikilink">Peabody Museum of Natural History</a>) was first mentioned and informally named by paleontologist <a href="Othniel_Charles_Marsh" title="wikilink">Othniel Charles Marsh</a> in the footnote of an 1889 paper, but it was not validly described by him until 1892. Marsh also described a second species in the same paper, which he named <em>Cimolopteryx retusa</em>, but this has since been recognized as a different kind of bird and reclassified as <em><a href="Palintropus_retusus" title="wikilink">Palintropus retusus</a></em>.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="classification-and-species">Classification and species</h2>
<p>The classification of various species assigned to the genus <em>Cimolopteryx</em> is uncertain. As of a re-evaluation of the fossil remains in 2002 by Sylvia Hope, at most five species were recognized: <em>Cimolopteryx rara</em>, <em>C. petra</em>, <em>C. maxima</em>, <em>C. minima</em>, and one yet-unnamed species. <em>C. rara</em> and <em>C. petra</em> are almost identical, and were found in the same environments (the Lance and Frenchman formations), but differ in size, with <em>C. petra</em> smaller than <em>C. rara</em>. In a 2009 review, Nicholas Longrich synonymized them as the same species, dismissing the size difference as possibly based on gender or growth stage.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> However, Longrich reversed his position following a 2011 analysis of Lancian birds, in which he and co-authors considered all four named species to be distinct.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> An additional, unnamed species is known from the much earlier Dinosaur Park Formation of Alberta. Also known only from a partial coracoid, its exact identity is uncertain.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> <em>C. maxima</em> was about twice the size of <em>C. rara</em>, but not enough of its anatomy is known to determine if it belongs to <em>Cimolopteryx</em> or a different genus.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> As its name suggests, <em>C. minima</em> is one of the smallest species in the genus, about the same size as specimens referred to <em>C. petra</em>. It may group together in the same &quot;species group&quot; as several indeterminate fossils possibly belonging to <em>Cimolopteryx</em>.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> Species <em>C. minima</em> and <em>C. petra</em> were transferred to the genus <em><a href="Lamarqueavis" class="uri" title="wikilink">Lamarqueavis</a></em> by Federico Agnolin (2010).<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> Several collections of material that is similar to <em>Cimolopteryx</em> were referred to by Hope as undetermined species, which lack enough unique characteristics to be properly identified, and these may or may not belong to <em>Cimolopteryx</em>.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<p>Hope regarded <em>Cimolopteryx</em> as a likely member of the modern bird group <a href="Charadriiformes" class="uri" title="wikilink">Charadriiformes</a>, which includes a diverse array of shorebirds. However, since all species are known only from parts of the shoulder girdle and wing bone fragments, this classification is tentative.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
