<p>The history of <strong>Canadian women</strong> covers half the population, but until recent years only comprised a tiny fraction of the historiography.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>In the 1660s the French government sent about 850 young women (single or widowed) called <a href="King&#39;s_Daughters" title="wikilink">King's Daughters</a> (&quot;filles du roi&quot;). They quickly found husbands among the predominantly male settlers, as well as a new life for themselves. They came mostly from poor families in the Paris area, Normandy and the central-western regions of France. A handful were ex-prostitutes, but only one is known to have practiced that trade in Canada.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> As farm wives with very good nutrition and high birth rates they played a major role in establishing family life and enabling rapid demographic growth. They had about 30% more children than comparable women who remained in France. Landry says, &quot;Canadians had an exceptional diet for their time. This was due to the natural abundance of meat, fish, and pure water; the good food conservation conditions during the winter; and an adequate wheat supply in most years.&quot;<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a><a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> The <a href="History_of_women_in_the_United_States" title="wikilink">American</a> politician <a href="Hillary_Clinton" title="wikilink">Hillary Clinton</a> is a descendant of one of them.</p>
<p>Besides household duties, some women participated in the fur trade, the major source of cash in New France. They worked at home alongside their husbands or fathers as merchants, clerks and provisioners. Some were widowed, and took over their husbands' roles. A handful were active entrepreneurs in their own right.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>In the early 19th century down to the 1950s upper-class <a href="English_language" title="wikilink">Anglos</a> dominated high society in Montreal, and their women constructed and managed their identity and social position through central events in the social life, such as the coming out of debutantes. The elite young women were trained in intelligent philanthropy and civic responsibility, especially through the Junior Leagues. They seldom connected with the reform impulses of the middle class women, and for and were paternalistic in their views of the needs of working-class women.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>

<h3 id="argentina">Argentina</h3>

<p><strong>Women in Argentina</strong> have attained a relatively high level of equality by <a href="Latin_America" title="wikilink">Latin American</a> standards, and in the <a href="Global_Gender_Gap_Report" title="wikilink">Global Gender Gap Report</a> prepared by the <a href="World_Economic_Forum" title="wikilink">World Economic Forum</a> in 2009, Argentine women ranked 24th among 134 countries studied in terms of their access to resources and opportunities relative to men.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> They enjoy comparable levels of <a href="Education_in_Argentina" title="wikilink">education</a>, and somewhat higher <a href="Gross_enrollment_ratio" title="wikilink">school enrollment ratios</a> than their male counterparts. They are well integrated in the nation's cultural and intellectual life,<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> though less so in the nation's economy. Their economic clout in relation to men is higher than in most Latin American countries, however,<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> and numerous Argentine women hold top posts in the Argentine corporate world;<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> among the best known are <a href="Cris_Morena" title="wikilink">Cris Morena</a>, owner of the television production company by the same name, <a href="Mar&lt;U+00ED&gt;a_Amalia_Lacroze_de_Fortabat" title="wikilink">Mar&lt;U+00ED&gt;a Amalia Lacroze de Fortabat</a>, former CEO and majority stakeholder of <a href="Loma_Negra" title="wikilink">Loma Negra</a>, the nation's largest cement manufacturer, and <a href="Ernestina_Herrera_de_Noble" title="wikilink">Ernestina Herrera de Noble</a>, director of <a href="Grupo_Clar&lt;U+00ED&gt;n" title="wikilink">Grupo Clar&lt;U+00ED&gt;n</a>, the premier media group in Argentina.</p>
<h3 id="bolivia">Bolivia</h3>

<p><strong>Women in Bolivia</strong> face struggles in healthcare and cultural change, living in a country that is traditionally <a href="misogynist" class="uri" title="wikilink">misogynist</a>, although the <a href="Constitution_of_Bolivia" title="wikilink">constitution</a> guarantees <a href="Women&#39;s_rights" title="wikilink">equal rights</a> for women and men. Economically and politically, women have recently garnered more influence in decision making. According to the <a href="Human_Development_Report" title="wikilink">Human Development Report</a> Office of the <a href="United_Nations_Development_Programme" title="wikilink">United Nations Development Programme</a>, in Bolivia &quot;men receive more and better education than women, receive increased and better health assistance than women, and have the possibility to generate greater income while working less...if we consider that women, as opposed to men, also have...the almost exclusive responsibility for domestic work&quot;.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> <a href="Maternal_mortality" title="wikilink">Maternal mortality</a> and <a href="illiteracy" class="uri" title="wikilink">illiteracy</a> among women rate as some of the highest in the world.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a><a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> Bolivian women are also exposed to excessive <a href="machismo" class="uri" title="wikilink">machismo</a>, being utilized as promotional tools in popular advertising which solidifies stereotypes and assumptions about women.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="brazil">Brazil</h3>

<p>Women in <a href="Brazil" class="uri" title="wikilink">Brazil</a> enjoy the same legal rights and duties as men, what is clearly expressed in the 5th article of Brazil's 1988 Constitution.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> A cabinet-level office, the Secretariat for Women's Affairs, oversees a special secretariat that has responsibility to ensure the legal rights of women. Although the law prohibits discrimination based on gender in employment and wages, there were significant wage disparities between men and women. However, many women have been elected mayors and many women have been federal judges. The first female assumed office in the <a href="Senate_of_Brazil" title="wikilink">Senate</a> in 1979. Women became candidates for vice president for the first time in 1994. As of 2009, only 9% of the seats in the national parliament were held by women.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="chile">Chile</h3>

<p>The lives, roles, and rights of <strong>women in Chile</strong> have gone through many changes over time. Chilean women's societal roles have historically been impacted by traditional <a href="gender_roles" title="wikilink">gender roles</a> and a <a href="patriarchy" title="wikilink">patriarchal culture</a>,<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> but throughout the twentieth century, women increasingly involved themselves in <a href="politics" class="uri" title="wikilink">politics</a> and <a href="protest" class="uri" title="wikilink">protest</a>, resulting in provisions to the <a href="constitution" class="uri" title="wikilink">constitution</a> to uphold equality between men and women and prohibit <a href="Sexism" title="wikilink">sex discrimination</a>.</p>
<p>Women's educational attainment, workforce participation, and rights have improved, especially since <a href="Chile" class="uri" title="wikilink">Chile</a> became a <a href="democracy" class="uri" title="wikilink">democracy</a> again in 1990. Chile legalized <a href="divorce" class="uri" title="wikilink">divorce</a> in 2004 and is also one of the few countries to have elected a <a href="Michelle_Bachelet" title="wikilink">female president</a>.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> However, Chilean women still face many economic and political challenges, including <a href="economic_inequality" title="wikilink">income disparity</a>, high rates of <a href="domestic_violence" title="wikilink">domestic violence</a>, and lingering gender roles.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="colombia">Colombia</h3>

<p>As established in the <a href="Colombian_Constitution_of_1991" title="wikilink">Colombian Constitution of 1991</a>, <strong>women in <a href="Colombia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Colombia</a></strong> have the right to bodily integrity and autonomy; to vote (<em>see also: <a href="Elections_in_Colombia" title="wikilink">Elections in Colombia</a></em>); to hold public office; to work; to fair wages or equal pay; to own property; to receive an education; to serve in the military in certain duties, but are excluded from combat arms units; to enter into legal contracts; and to have marital, parental and religious rights. Women's rights in Colombia have been gradually developing since the early 20th Century.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="ecuador">Ecuador</h3>


<h3 id="guyana">Guyana</h3>


<h3 id="paraguay">Paraguay</h3>

<p><strong>Women in Paraguay</strong> live in a culture that has been undergoing rapid change in recent decades. Women's rights were expanded through constitutional and legal changes during the 1990s. Cultural attitudes towards many areas of women's lives are also changing. Yet <a href="Paraguay" title="wikilink">Paraguayan</a> women still face many challenges in trying to attain social equality.</p>
<p>The legal and government institutions that currently exist in Paraguay were developed in part through the efforts of feminist organizations in the country that held significant awareness-raising campaigns during the 1990s to formalize the guarantees of women's rights.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a></p>
<p>The 1992 Constitution of Paraguay upholds the principle of equality for all individuals and prohibits discrimination. However, socio-cultural practises still support discrimination against women in some areas.</p>
<h3 id="peru">Peru</h3>

<p><strong>Women in Peru</strong> represent a minority in both numbers and legal rights. Although historically somewhat equal to men, after the Spanish conquest the culture in what is now Peru became increasingly <a href="patriarchy" title="wikilink">patriarchal</a>. The patriarchal culture is still noticeable. Women receive less pay than men, have fewer employment and political opportunities, and are at times abused without repercussion. <a href="Contraceptive" class="uri" title="wikilink">Contraceptive</a> availability is not enough for the demand, and over a third of pregnancies end in <a href="abortion" class="uri" title="wikilink">abortion</a>. Maternal death rates are also some of the highest in South America.</p>
<p>The <a href="Government_of_Peru" title="wikilink">Peruvian Government</a> has begun efforts to combat the high maternal mortality rate and lack of female political representation, as well as <a href="violence_against_women" title="wikilink">violence against women</a>. However, the efforts have not yet borne fruit.</p>
<h3 id="suriname">Suriname</h3>

<p><strong>Women in Suriname</strong> are women who were born in, live in, or are from <a href="Suriname" class="uri" title="wikilink">Suriname</a>. <a href="Surinamese_people" title="wikilink">Surinamese</a> women may be ethnically <a href="Indo-Surinamese" title="wikilink">Hindustani</a> (Hindostani), , <a href="Multiracial" title="wikilink">Mixed</a>, <a href="Surinamese_Creole_people" title="wikilink">Creole</a>/<a href="Afro-Surinamese" class="uri" title="wikilink">Afro-Surinamese</a>, <a href="Javanese_people" title="wikilink">Javanese</a>, <a href="Maroon_(people)" title="wikilink">Maroon</a>, <a href="Amerindian" class="uri" title="wikilink">Amerindian</a>, or of other ancestry.

<h3 id="trinidad-and-tobago-1">Trinidad and Tobago</h3>

<p><strong>Women in Trinidad and Tobago</strong> are women who were born in, who live in, or are from <a href="Trinidad_and_Tobago" title="wikilink">Trinidad and Tobago</a>. Depending from which island the women came from, the women of Trinidad and Tobago may also be called <strong>Trinidadian women</strong> or <strong>Tobagonian women</strong>.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> Some women in Trinidad and Tobago now excel in occupations such as being microenterprise owners, &quot;lawyers, judges, politicians, civil servants, journalists, and <a href="calypsonian" title="wikilink">calypsonians</a>&quot;. Other women dominate in the fields of &quot;domestic service, sales, and some light manufacturing&quot;.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a></p>
<p>Women of Afro-Trinidadian mix commonly become &quot;heads of households&quot;, thus with acquired &quot;autonomy and power&quot;. By participating in Trinidad and Tobago's version of the <a href="Carnival" class="uri" title="wikilink">Carnival</a>, Trinidadian and Tobagonian women demonstrate their &quot;assertive sexuality&quot;. Some of them have also been active in so-called Afro-Christian sects and in running the &quot;sou-sou informal rotating credit associations&quot;.<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="uruguay">Uruguay</h3>

<p><strong>Women in Uruguay</strong> are women who were born in, who live in, and are from <a href="Uruguay" class="uri" title="wikilink">Uruguay</a>. According to <em>Countries and Their Cultures</em>, there is a &quot;very high proportion&quot; of <a href="Uruguayan_people" title="wikilink">Uruguayan</a> women participating in the labor force of the <a href="South_America" title="wikilink">South American</a> country. And that <a href="Constitution_of_Uruguay" title="wikilink">Uruguayan legislation</a> maintains that the women of Uruguay have equal rights to power, authority, and privileges&quot;.
