<p><a href="Charles_Darwin" title="wikilink">Charles Darwin</a>'s <strong><em>On the Origin of Species</em></strong>, published 24 November <a href="1859_in_science" title="wikilink">1859</a>, is a seminal work of <a href="scientific_literature" title="wikilink">scientific literature</a> considered to be the foundation of <a href="evolutionary_biology" title="wikilink">evolutionary biology</a>. Its full title was <strong><em>On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection, or the Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life</em></strong>. For the sixth edition of 1872, the short title was changed to <strong><em>The Origin of Species</em></strong>. Darwin's book introduced the <a href="Theory#Scientific_theories" title="wikilink">theory</a> that populations <a href="evolution" title="wikilink">evolve</a> over the course of generations through a process of <a href="natural_selection" title="wikilink">natural selection</a>, and presented a body of evidence that <a href="biodiversity" title="wikilink">the diversity of life</a> arose through a <a href="tree_of_life_(science)" title="wikilink">branching pattern of evolution</a> and <a href="common_descent" title="wikilink">common descent</a>. He included evidence that he had accumulated on <a href="Second_voyage_of_HMS_Beagle" title="wikilink">the voyage of the <em>Beagle</em></a> in the 1830s, and his subsequent findings from research, correspondence, and experimentation.</p>
<p><a href="History_of_evolutionary_thought" title="wikilink">Various evolutionary ideas</a> had already been proposed to explain <a href="History_of_biology" title="wikilink">new findings in biology</a>. There was growing support for such ideas among dissident anatomists and the general public, but during the first half of the 19th century the English scientific establishment was closely tied to the <a href="Church_of_England" title="wikilink">Church of England</a>, while science was part of <a href="natural_theology" title="wikilink">natural theology</a>. Ideas about the <a href="transmutation_of_species" title="wikilink">transmutation of species</a> were controversial as they conflicted with the beliefs that species were unchanging parts of a designed hierarchy and that humans were unique, unrelated to animals. The political and theological implications were intensely debated, but transmutation was not accepted by the scientific mainstream.</p>
<p>The book was written to be read by non-specialists and attracted widespread interest on its publication. As Darwin was an eminent scientist, his findings were taken seriously and the evidence he presented generated scientific, philosophical, and religious discussion. . The debate over the book contributed to the campaign by <a href="Thomas_Henry_Huxley" title="wikilink">T.H. Huxley</a> and his fellow members of the <a href="X_Club" title="wikilink">X Club</a> to <a href="Secularity" title="wikilink">secularize</a> science by promoting <a href="Naturalism_(philosophy)" title="wikilink">scientific naturalism</a>. Within two decades there was widespread scientific agreement that evolution, with a branching pattern of common descent, had occurred, but scientists were slow to give natural selection the significance that Darwin thought appropriate. During the &quot;<a href="eclipse_of_Darwinism" title="wikilink">eclipse of Darwinism</a>&quot; from the 1880s to the 1930s, various other mechanisms of evolution were given more credit. With the development of the <a href="modern_evolutionary_synthesis" title="wikilink">modern evolutionary synthesis</a> in the 1930s and 1940s, Darwin's concept of evolutionary adaptation through natural selection became central to modern evolutionary theory, now the unifying concept of the <a href="life_science" title="wikilink">life sciences</a>.</p>
<h2 id="summary-of-darwins-theory">Summary of Darwin's theory</h2>
<p><img src="Charles_Darwin_seated.jpg" title="fig:Darwin pictured shortly after publication" alt="Darwin pictured shortly after publication" /> Darwin's theory of evolution is based on key <a href="fact" title="wikilink">facts</a> and the <a href="inference" title="wikilink">inferences</a> drawn from them, which biologist <a href="Ernst_Mayr" title="wikilink">Ernst Mayr</a> summarised as follows:<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li>Every <a href="species" class="uri" title="wikilink">species</a> is fertile enough that if all offspring survived to reproduce the population would grow (fact).</li>
<li>Despite periodic fluctuations, populations remain roughly the same size (fact).</li>
<li>Resources such as food are limited and are relatively stable over time (fact).</li>
<li>A struggle for survival ensues (inference).</li>
<li>Individuals in a population vary significantly from one another (fact).</li>
<li>Much of this variation is <a href="heredity" title="wikilink">inheritable</a> (fact).</li>
<li>Individuals less suited to the environment are less likely to survive and less likely to reproduce; individuals more suited to the environment are more likely to survive and more likely to reproduce and leave their inheritable traits to future generations, which produces the process of <a href="natural_selection" title="wikilink">natural selection</a> (inference).</li>
<li>This slowly effected process results in populations changing to adapt to their environments, and ultimately, these variations accumulate over time to form new species (inference).</li>

<p>In later editions of the book, Darwin traced evolutionary ideas as far back as <a href="Aristotle" class="uri" title="wikilink">Aristotle</a>;<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> the text he cites is a summary by Aristotle of the ideas of the earlier Greek philosopher <a href="Empedocles" class="uri" title="wikilink">Empedocles</a>.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> Early <a href="Christianity" title="wikilink">Christian</a> <a href="Church_Fathers" title="wikilink">Church Fathers</a> and <a href="Medieval_Europe" title="wikilink">Medieval European</a> scholars interpreted the <a href="creation_according_to_Genesis" title="wikilink">creation according to Genesis</a> allegorically rather than through strictly literal meanings;<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> organisms were described by their mythological and heraldic significance as well as by their physical form. Nature was widely believed to be unstable and capricious, with monstrous births from union between species, and <a href="spontaneous_generation" title="wikilink">spontaneous generation</a> of life.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> <img src="Georges_Cuvier_-_Elephant_jaw.png" title="fig:Cuvier&#39;s 1799 paper on living and fossil elephants helped establish the reality of extinction." alt="Cuvier&#39;s 1799 paper on living and fossil elephants helped establish the reality of extinction." /> The <a href="Protestant_Reformation" title="wikilink">Protestant Reformation</a> inspired <a href="Biblical_literalism" title="wikilink">a literal interpretation of the Bible</a>, with concepts of creation that conflicted with the findings of an <a href="Scientific_Revolution" title="wikilink">emerging science</a> seeking explanations congruent with the <a href="Mechanism_(philosophy)" title="wikilink">mechanical philosophy</a> of <a href="Ren&lt;U+00E9&gt;_Descartes" title="wikilink">Ren&lt;U+00E9&gt; Descartes</a> and the <a href="empiricism" class="uri" title="wikilink">empiricism</a> of the <a href="Baconian_method" title="wikilink">Baconian method</a>. After the turmoil of the <a href="English_Civil_War" title="wikilink">English Civil War</a>, the <a href="Royal_Society" title="wikilink">Royal Society</a> wanted to show that science did not threaten religious and political stability. <a href="John_Ray" title="wikilink">John Ray</a> developed an influential <a href="natural_theology" title="wikilink">natural theology</a> of rational order; in his <a href="taxonomy" class="uri" title="wikilink">taxonomy</a>, <a href="species" class="uri" title="wikilink">species</a> were static and fixed, their <a href="adaptation" class="uri" title="wikilink">adaptation</a> and complexity designed by God, and <a href="Subspecies" title="wikilink">varieties</a> showed minor differences caused by local conditions. In God's benevolent design, carnivores caused mercifully swift death, but the suffering caused by <a href="parasitism" class="uri" title="wikilink">parasitism</a> was a <a href="problem_of_evil" title="wikilink">puzzling problem</a>. The <a href="biological_classification" title="wikilink">biological classification</a> introduced by <a href="Carolus_Linnaeus" title="wikilink">Carolus Linnaeus</a> in 1735 also viewed species as fixed according to the divine plan. In 1766, <a href="Georges_Buffon" title="wikilink">Georges Buffon</a> suggested that some similar species, such as horses and asses, or lions, tigers, and leopards, might be varieties descended from a common ancestor. The <a href="Ussher_chronology" title="wikilink">Ussher chronology</a> of the 1650s had calculated creation at 4004Â BC, but by the 1780s geologists assumed a much older world. <a href="Abraham_Gottlob_Werner" title="wikilink">Wernerians</a> thought <a href="stratum" title="wikilink">strata</a> were <a href="Neptunism" title="wikilink">deposits from shrinking seas</a>, but <a href="James_Hutton" title="wikilink">James Hutton</a> proposed a self-maintaining infinite cycle, anticipating <a href="Uniformitarianism_(science)" title="wikilink">uniformitarianism</a>.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p>Charles Darwin's grandfather <a href="Erasmus_Darwin" title="wikilink">Erasmus Darwin</a> outlined a hypothesis of <a href="transmutation_of_species" title="wikilink">transmutation of species</a> in the 1790s, and <a href="Jean-Baptiste_Lamarck" title="wikilink">Jean-Baptiste Lamarck</a> published a more developed theory in 1809. Both envisaged that <a href="spontaneous_generation" title="wikilink">spontaneous generation</a> produced simple forms of life that progressively developed greater complexity, adapting to the environment by inheriting changes in adults caused by use or disuse. This process was later called <a href="Lamarckism" class="uri" title="wikilink">Lamarckism</a>. Lamarck thought there was an inherent progressive tendency driving organisms continuously towards greater complexity, in parallel but separate lineages with no extinction.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> <a href="&lt;U+00C9&gt;tienne_Geoffroy_Saint-Hilaire" title="wikilink">Geoffroy</a> contended that <a href="recapitulation_theory" title="wikilink">embryonic development recapitulated</a> transformations of organisms in past <a href="era" title="wikilink">eras</a> when the environment acted on embryos, and that animal structures were determined by a constant plan as demonstrated by <a href="Homology_(biology)" title="wikilink">homologies</a>. <a href="Georges_Cuvier" title="wikilink">Georges Cuvier</a> strongly disputed such ideas, holding that unrelated, fixed species showed similarities that reflected a design for functional needs.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> His <a href="history_of_paleontology" title="wikilink">paleontological work</a> in the 1790s had established the reality of extinction, which he explained by local <a href="catastrophism" title="wikilink">catastrophes</a>, followed by repopulation of the affected areas by other species.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<p>In Britain, <a href="William_Paley" title="wikilink">William Paley</a>'s <em>Natural Theology</em> saw adaptation as evidence of beneficial <a href="Teleological_argument" title="wikilink">&quot;design&quot; by the Creator</a> acting through natural laws. All naturalists in English universities were <a href="Church_of_England" title="wikilink">Church of England</a> clergymen, and science became a search for these laws.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> Geologists adapted catastrophism to show repeated worldwide annihilation and creation of new fixed species adapted to a changed environment, initially identifying the most recent catastrophe as the <a href="Deluge_(mythology)" title="wikilink">biblical flood</a>.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> Some anatomists such as <a href="Robert_Edmond_Grant" title="wikilink">Robert Grant</a> were influenced by Lamarck and Geoffroy, but most naturalists regarded their ideas of transmutation as a threat to divinely appointed social order.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> </p>
<h3 id="inception-of-darwins-theory">Inception of Darwin's theory</h3>

<p>Darwin went to <a href="University_of_Edinburgh" title="wikilink">Edinburgh University</a> in 1825. In his second year he neglected his medical studies for <a href="natural_history" title="wikilink">natural history</a> and spent four months assisting <a href="Robert_Edmund_Grant" title="wikilink">Robert Grant</a>'s research into <a href="marine_invertebrate" title="wikilink">marine invertebrates</a>. Grant revealed his enthusiasm for the transmutation of species, but Darwin rejected it.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> At <a href="University_of_Cambridge" title="wikilink">Cambridge University</a> starting in 1827, Darwin learnt science as <a href="natural_theology" title="wikilink">natural theology</a> from botanist <a href="John_Stevens_Henslow" title="wikilink">John Stevens Henslow</a>, and read <a href="William_Paley" title="wikilink">Paley</a>, <a href="John_Herschel" title="wikilink">John Herschel</a> and <a href="Alexander_von_Humboldt" title="wikilink">Alexander von Humboldt</a>. Filled with zeal for science, he studied <a href="catastrophism" title="wikilink">catastrophist</a> <a href="geology" class="uri" title="wikilink">geology</a> with <a href="Adam_Sedgwick" title="wikilink">Adam Sedgwick</a>.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a><a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> <img src="Darwin_tree.png" title="fig:In mid-July 1837 Darwin started his &quot;B&quot; notebook on Transmutation of Species, and on page 36 wrote &quot;I think&quot; above the first evolutionary tree." alt="In mid-July 1837 Darwin started his &quot;B&quot; notebook on Transmutation of Species, and on page 36 wrote &quot;I think&quot; above the first evolutionary tree." /> In December 1831, he joined the <a href="Second_voyage_of_HMS_Beagle" title="wikilink"><em>Beagle</em> expedition</a> as a geologist and naturalist. He read <a href="Charles_Lyell" title="wikilink">Charles Lyell</a>'s <em><a href="Principles_of_Geology" title="wikilink">Principles of Geology</a></em> and from the first stop ashore, at <a href="Santiago,_Cape_Verde" title="wikilink">St. Jago</a>, found <a href="Uniformitarianism_(science)" title="wikilink">Lyell's uniformitarianism</a> a key to the geological history of landscapes. Darwin discovered fossils resembling huge <a href="armadillo" title="wikilink">armadillos</a>, and noted the geographical distribution of modern species in hope of finding their &quot;centre of creation&quot;.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> The three <a href="Fuegians" title="wikilink">Fuegian</a> missionaries the expedition returned to <a href="Tierra_del_Fuego" title="wikilink">Tierra del Fuego</a> were friendly and civilised, yet to Darwin their relatives on the island seemed &quot;miserable, degraded savages&quot;,<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> and he no longer saw an unbridgeable gap between humans and animals.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> As the <em>Beagle</em> neared England in 1836, he noted that species might not be fixed.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a></p>
<p><a href="Richard_Owen" title="wikilink">Richard Owen</a> showed that fossils of extinct species Darwin found in South America were allied to living species on the same continent. In March 1837, ornithologist <a href="John_Gould" title="wikilink">John Gould</a> announced that <a href="Darwin&#39;s_Rhea" title="wikilink">Darwin's Rhea</a> was a separate species from the previously described <a href="Rhea_(bird)" title="wikilink">rhea</a> (though their territories overlapped), that <a href="mockingbird" title="wikilink">mockingbirds</a> collected on the <a href="Gal&lt;U+00E1&gt;pagos_Islands" title="wikilink">Gal&lt;U+00E1&gt;pagos Islands</a> represented three separate species each <a href="Endemism" title="wikilink">unique to</a> a particular island, and that several distinct birds from those islands were all classified as <a href="Darwin&#39;s_finch" title="wikilink">finches</a>.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> Darwin began speculating, in a series of notebooks, on the possibility that &quot;one species does change into another&quot; to explain these findings, and around July sketched a <a href="genealogy" title="wikilink">genealogical</a> branching of a single <a href="Tree_of_life_(science)" title="wikilink">evolutionary tree</a>, discarding Lamarck's independent <a href="Lineage_(evolution)" title="wikilink">lineages</a> progressing to higher forms.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> Unconventionally, Darwin asked questions of <a href="fancy_pigeon" title="wikilink">fancy pigeon</a> and <a href="animal_husbandry" title="wikilink">animal breeders</a> as well as established scientists. At the zoo he had his first sight of an ape, and was profoundly impressed by how human the <a href="orang-utan" class="uri" title="wikilink">orang-utan</a> seemed.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a></p>
<p>In late September 1838, he started reading <a href="Thomas_Malthus" title="wikilink">Thomas Malthus</a>'s <em><a href="An_Essay_on_the_Principle_of_Population" title="wikilink">An Essay on the Principle of Population</a></em> with its statistical proof that human populations breed beyond their means and struggle to survive. Darwin related this to the struggle for existence among wildlife and botanist <a href="A._P._de_Candolle" title="wikilink">de Candolle's</a> &quot;warring of the species&quot; in plants; he immediately envisioned &quot;a force like a hundred thousand wedges&quot; pushing well-adapted variations into &quot;gaps in the economy of nature&quot;, so that the survivors would pass on their form and abilities, and unfavourable variations would be destroyed.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a><a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> By December 1838, he had noted a similarity between the act of breeders selecting traits and a Malthusian Nature selecting among variants thrown up by &quot;chance&quot; so that &quot;every part of newly acquired structure is fully practical and perfected&quot;.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a></p>
<p>Darwin now had the framework of his theory of natural selection &quot;by which to work&quot;,<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> but he was fully occupied with his career as a geologist and held off writing a sketch of his theory until his book on <em><a href="The_Structure_and_Distribution_of_Coral_Reefs" title="wikilink">The Structure and Distribution of Coral Reefs</a></em> was completed in May 1842.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a><a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="further-development">Further development</h3>

<p>Darwin continued to research and extensively revise his theory while focusing on his main work of publishing the scientific results of the <em>Beagle</em> voyage.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> He tentatively wrote of his ideas to Lyell in January 1842;<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> then in June he roughed out a 35-page &quot;Pencil Sketch&quot; of his theory.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> Darwin began correspondence about his theorising with the botanist <a href="Joseph_Dalton_Hooker" title="wikilink">Joseph Dalton Hooker</a> in January 1844, and by July had rounded out his &quot;sketch&quot; into a 230-page &quot;Essay&quot;, to be expanded with his research results and published if he died prematurely.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> <img src="Charles_Darwin_-_Pigeon_skulls.png" title="fig:Darwin researched how the skulls of different pigeon breeds varied, as shown in his Variation of Plants and Animals Under Domestication of 1868." alt="Darwin researched how the skulls of different pigeon breeds varied, as shown in his Variation of Plants and Animals Under Domestication of 1868." /> In November 1844, the anonymously published <a href="popular_science" title="wikilink">popular science</a> book <em><a href="Vestiges_of_the_Natural_History_of_Creation" title="wikilink">Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation</a></em>, written by Scottish journalist <a href="Robert_Chambers" title="wikilink">Robert Chambers</a>, widened public interest in the concept of transmutation of species. <em>Vestiges</em> used evidence from the fossil record and embryology to support the claim that living things had progressed from the simple to the more complex over time. But it proposed a linear progression rather than the branching common descent theory behind Darwin's work in progress, and it ignored <a href="adaptation" class="uri" title="wikilink">adaptation</a>. Darwin read it soon after publication, and scorned its amateurish geology and zoology,<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> but he carefully reviewed his own arguments after leading scientists, including <a href="Adam_Sedgwick" title="wikilink">Adam Sedgwick</a>, attacked its morality and scientific errors.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> <em>Vestiges</em> had significant influence on public opinion, and the intense debate helped to pave the way for the acceptance of the more scientifically sophisticated <em>Origin</em> by moving evolutionary speculation into the mainstream. While few naturalists were willing to consider transmutation, <a href="Herbert_Spencer" title="wikilink">Herbert Spencer</a> became an active proponent of Lamarckism and progressive development in the 1850s.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a></p>
<p>Hooker was persuaded to take away a copy of the &quot;Essay&quot; in January 1847, and eventually sent a page of notes giving Darwin much needed feedback. Reminded of his lack of expertise in <a href="taxonomy" class="uri" title="wikilink">taxonomy</a>, Darwin began an eight year study of <a href="barnacle" title="wikilink">barnacles</a>, becoming the leading expert on their classification. Using his theory, he discovered <a href="homology_(biology)" title="wikilink">homologies</a> showing that slightly changed body parts served different functions to meet new conditions, and he found an <a href="Androdioecy" title="wikilink">intermediate stage</a> in the evolution of <a href="Gonochorism" title="wikilink">distinct sexes</a>.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a></p>
<p>Darwin's barnacle studies convinced him that variation arose constantly and not just in response to changed circumstances. In 1854, he completed the last part of his <em>Beagle</em>-related writing and began working full-time on evolution. His thinking changed from the view that <a href="Allopatric_speciation" title="wikilink">species formed in isolated populations only</a>, as on islands, to an emphasis on <a href="Sympatric_speciation" title="wikilink">speciation without isolation</a>; that is, he saw increasing specialisation within large stable populations as continuously exploiting new <a href="ecological_niche" title="wikilink">ecological niches</a>. He conducted empirical research focusing on difficulties with his theory. He studied the developmental and anatomical differences between different breeds of many domestic animals, became actively involved in <a href="fancy_pigeon" title="wikilink">fancy pigeon</a> breeding, and experimented (with the help of his son <a href="Francis_Darwin" title="wikilink">Francis</a>) on ways that plant seeds and animals might disperse across oceans to colonise distant islands. By 1856, his theory was much more sophisticated, with a mass of supporting evidence.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a><a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> </p>

Darwin was torn between the desire to set out a full and convincing account and the pressure to quickly produce a short paper. He decided he did not want to expose his ideas to review by an editor as would have been required to publish in an academic journal. On 14 May 1856, he began a &quot;sketch&quot; account, and by July had decided to produce a full technical treatise on species.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a></p>
<p>Darwin was hard at work on his &quot;big book&quot; on <em>Natural Selection</em>, when on 18Â June 1858 he received a parcel from Wallace, who was working in <a href="Borneo" class="uri" title="wikilink">Borneo</a>. It enclosed twenty pages describing an evolutionary mechanism, a response to Darwin's recent encouragement, with a request to send it on to Lyell if Darwin thought it worthwhile. The mechanism was similar to Darwin's own theory.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> Darwin wrote to Lyell that &quot;your words have come true with a vengeance, ... forestalled&quot; and he would &quot;of course, at once write and offer to send [it] to any journal&quot; that Wallace chose, adding that &quot;all my originality, whatever it may amount to, will be smashed&quot;.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> Lyell and Hooker agreed that a joint paper should be presented at the <a href="Linnean_Society_of_London" title="wikilink">Linnean Society</a>, and on 1Â July 1858, the papers entitled <em><a href="On_the_Tendency_of_Species_to_form_Varieties;_and_on_the_Perpetuation_of_Varieties_and_Species_by_Natural_Means_of_Selection" title="wikilink">On the Tendency of Species to form Varieties; and on the Perpetuation of Varieties and Species by Natural Means of Selection</a></em>, by Wallace and Darwin respectively, were read out but drew little reaction. While Darwin considered Wallace's idea to be identical to his concept of natural selection, historians have pointed out differences. Darwin described natural selection as being analogous to the <a href="artificial_selection" title="wikilink">artificial selection</a> practised by animal breeders, and emphasised competition between individuals; Wallace drew no comparison to <a href="selective_breeding" title="wikilink">selective breeding</a>, and focused on ecological pressures that kept different varieties adapted to local conditions.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a><a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a><a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a></p>
<p>On 20 July 1858, Darwin started work on an &quot;abstract&quot; trimmed from his <em>Natural Selection</em>, writing much of it from memory. Lyell made arrangements with publisher <a href="John_Murray_(publisher)" title="wikilink">John Murray</a>, who agreed to publish the manuscript sight unseen and to pay Darwin two-thirds of the net proceeds. Darwin had initially decided to call his book <em>An abstract of an Essay/on the/Origin/of/Species and Varieties/Through natural selection/</em>, but with Murray's persuasion it was eventually changed to the snappier title: <em>On the Origin of Species</em>, with the title page adding <em>by Means of Natural Selection, or the Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life</em>. Here the term <em>&quot;<a href="Race_(biology)" title="wikilink">races</a>&quot;</em> is used as an alternative for <em>&quot;<a href="Variety_(botany)" title="wikilink">varieties</a>&quot;</em> and does not carry the modern connotation of <a href="Race_(classification_of_human_beings)" title="wikilink">human races</a>&lt;U+2014&gt;the first use in the book refers to &quot;the several races, for instance, of the cabbage&quot; and proceeds to a discussion of &quot;the hereditary varieties or races of our domestic animals and plants&quot;.<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="time-taken-to-publish">Time taken to publish</h3>
<p>By December 1838, Darwin had his basic theory of natural selection &quot;by which to work&quot;, yet when Wallace's letter arrived on 18 June 1858 Darwin was still not ready to publish his theory. It is commonly thought that Darwin avoided or delayed making his ideas public, and scholars have suggested various reasons, including fear of religious persecution or social disgrace if his views were revealed, and concern about upsetting his clergymen naturalist friends or his pious wife Emma. <a href="Charles_Darwin&#39;s_illness" title="wikilink">Charles Darwin's illness</a> caused repeated delays. His paper on <a href="Glen_Roy" title="wikilink">Glen Roy</a> had proved embarrassingly wrong, and he may have wanted to be sure he was correct. <a href="David_Quammen" title="wikilink">David Quammen</a> has suggested all these factors may have contributed, and notes Darwin's large output of books and busy family life during that time.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a></p>
<p>A more recent study by science historian <a href="John_van_Wyhe" title="wikilink">John van Wyhe</a> has determined that the idea that Darwin delayed publication only dates back to the 1940s, and Darwin's contemporaries thought the time he took was reasonable. Darwin always finished one book before starting another he had been researching, and he told many people about his interest in transmutation without causing outrage. While he firmly intended to publish, it was not until September 1854 that he could work on it full time. His estimate that writing his &quot;big book&quot; would take five years was optimistic.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>WHEN on board H.M.S. 'Beagle,' as naturalist, I was much struck with certain facts in the distribution of the inhabitants of South America, and in the geological relations of the present to the past inhabitants of that continent. These facts seemed to me to throw some light on the origin of species&lt;U+2014&gt;that mystery of mysteries, as it has been called by one of our greatest philosophers.<a href="#fn77" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref77"><sup>77</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Darwin refers specifically to the distribution of the species <a href="rheas" class="uri" title="wikilink">rheas</a>, and to that of the <a href="Gal&lt;U+00E1&gt;pagos_tortoise" title="wikilink">Gal&lt;U+00E1&gt;pagos tortoises</a> and <a href="mockingbird" title="wikilink">mockingbirds</a>. He mentions his years of work on his theory, and the arrival of Wallace at the same conclusion which led him to &quot;publish this Abstract&quot; of his incomplete work. He outlines his ideas, and sets out the essence of his theory:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As many more individuals of each species are born than can possibly survive; and as, consequently, there is a frequently recurring struggle for existence, it follows that any being, if it vary however slightly in any manner profitable to itself, under the complex and sometimes varying conditions of life, will have a better chance of surviving, and thus be naturally selected. From the strong principle of inheritance, any selected variety will tend to propagate its new and modified form.<a href="#fn78" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref78"><sup>78</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Starting with the third edition, Darwin prefaced the introduction with a historical sketch that traced the development of evolutionary ideas.<a href="#fn79" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref79"><sup>79</sup></a><a href="#fn80" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref80"><sup>80</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="variation-under-domestication-and-under-nature">Variation under domestication and under nature</h3>
<p>Chapter I covers <a href="animal_husbandry" title="wikilink">animal</a> and <a href="plant_breeding" title="wikilink">plant breeding</a>, going back to <a href="ancient_Egypt" title="wikilink">ancient Egypt</a>. Darwin discusses contemporary opinions on the origins of different breeds under cultivation to argue that many have been produced from common ancestors by <a href="selective_breeding" title="wikilink">selective breeding</a>. As an illustration of <a href="artificial_selection" title="wikilink">artificial selection</a>, he describes <a href="fancy_pigeon" title="wikilink">fancy pigeon</a> breeding, noting that &quot;[t]he diversity of the breeds is something astonishing&quot;, yet all were descended from one species of <a href="rock_pigeon" title="wikilink">rock pigeon</a>.<a href="#fn81" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref81"><sup>81</sup></a><a href="#fn82" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref82"><sup>82</sup></a><a href="#fn83" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref83"><sup>83</sup></a></p>
<p>In Chapter II, Darwin specifies that the distinction between <a href="species" class="uri" title="wikilink">species</a> and <a href="Variety_(biology)" title="wikilink">varieties</a> is arbitrary, with experts disagreeing and changing their decisions when new forms were found. He concludes that &quot;a well-marked variety may be justly called an incipient species&quot; and that &quot;species are only strongly marked and permanent varieties&quot;.<a href="#fn84" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref84"><sup>84</sup></a> He argues for the ubiquity of variation in nature.<a href="#fn85" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref85"><sup>85</sup></a> Historians have noted that naturalists had long been aware that the individuals of a species differed from one another, but had generally considered such variations to be limited and unimportant deviations from the <a href="archetype" class="uri" title="wikilink">archetype</a> of each species, that archetype being a fixed ideal in the mind of God. Darwin and Wallace made variation among individuals of the same species central to understanding the natural world.<a href="#fn86" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref86"><sup>86</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="struggle-for-existence-natural-selection-and-divergence">Struggle for existence, natural selection, and divergence</h3>
<p>In Chapter III, Darwin asks how varieties &quot;which I have called incipient species&quot; become distinct species, and in answer introduces the key concept he calls &quot;<a href="natural_selection" title="wikilink">natural selection</a>&quot;;<a href="#fn87" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref87"><sup>87</sup></a> in the fifth edition he adds, &quot;But the expression often used by Mr. <a href="Herbert_Spencer" title="wikilink">Herbert Spencer</a>, of the <a href="Survival_of_the_Fittest" title="wikilink">Survival of the Fittest</a>, is more accurate, and is sometimes equally convenient.&quot;<a href="#fn88" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref88"><sup>88</sup></a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Owing to this struggle for life, any variation, however slight and from whatever cause proceeding, if it be in any degree profitable to an individual of any species, in its infinitely complex relations to other organic beings and to external nature, will tend to the preservation of that individual, and will generally be inherited by its offspring.... I have called this principle, by which each slight variation, if useful, is preserved, by the term of Natural Selection, in order to mark its relation to man's power of selection.<a href="#fn89" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref89"><sup>89</sup></a><br />
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He notes that both <a href="A._P._de_Candolle" title="wikilink">A. P. de Candolle</a> and <a href="Charles_Lyell" title="wikilink">Charles Lyell</a> had stated that all organisms are exposed to severe competition. Darwin emphasises that he used the phrase &quot;struggle for existence&quot; in &quot;a large and metaphorical sense, including dependence of one being on another&quot;; he gives examples ranging from plants struggling against drought to plants competing for birds to eat their fruit and disseminate their seeds. He describes the struggle resulting from population growth: &quot;It is the doctrine of Malthus applied with manifold force to the whole animal and vegetable kingdoms.&quot; He discusses checks to such increase including complex <a href="ecology" title="wikilink">ecological</a> interdependencies, and notes that competition is most severe between closely related forms &quot;which fill nearly the same place in the economy of nature&quot;.<a href="#fn90" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref90"><sup>90</sup></a></p>
<p>Chapter IV details natural selection under the &quot;infinitely complex and close-fittingÂ ... mutual relations of all organic beings to each other and to their physical conditions of life&quot;.<a href="#fn91" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref91"><sup>91</sup></a> Darwin takes as an example a country where a change in conditions led to extinction of some species, immigration of others and, where suitable variations occurred, descendants of some species became adapted to new conditions. He remarks that the artificial selection practised by animal breeders frequently produced sharp divergence in character between breeds, and suggests that natural selection might do the same, saying:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But how, it may be asked, can any analogous principle apply in nature? I believe it can and does apply most efficiently, from the simple circumstance that the more diversified the descendants from any one species become in structure, constitution, and habits, by so much will they be better enabled to seize on many and widely diversified places in the polity of nature, and so be enabled to increase in numbers.<a href="#fn92" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref92"><sup>92</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Historians have remarked that here Darwin anticipated the modern concept of an <a href="ecological_niche" title="wikilink">ecological niche</a>.<a href="#fn93" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref93"><sup>93</sup></a> He did not suggest that every favourable variation must be selected, nor that the favoured animals were better or higher, but merely more adapted to their surroundings.</p>

<p>Darwin proposes <a href="sexual_selection" title="wikilink">sexual selection</a>, driven by competition between males for mates, to explain <a href="sexual_dimorphism" title="wikilink">sexually dimorphic</a> features such as lion manes, deer antlers, peacock tails, bird songs, and the bright plumage of some male birds.<a href="#fn94" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref94"><sup>94</sup></a> He analysed sexual selection more fully in <em><a href="The_Descent_of_Man,_and_Selection_in_Relation_to_Sex" title="wikilink">The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex</a></em> (1871). Natural selection was expected to work very slowly in forming new species, but given the effectiveness of artificial selection, he could &quot;see no limit to the amount of change, to the beauty and infinite complexity of the coadaptations between all organic beings, one with another and with their physical conditions of life, which may be effected in the long course of time by nature's power of selection&quot;. Using a <a href="Phylogenetic_tree" title="wikilink">tree diagram</a> and calculations, he indicates the &quot;divergence of character&quot; from original species into new species and genera. He describes branches falling off as extinction occurred, while new branches formed in &quot;the great <a href="Tree_of_life_(science)" title="wikilink">Tree of life</a>Â ... with its ever branching and beautiful ramifications&quot;.<a href="#fn95" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref95"><sup>95</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="variation-and-heredity">Variation and heredity</h3>
<p>In Darwin's time there was no agreed-upon model of <a href="heredity" class="uri" title="wikilink">heredity</a>;<a href="#fn96" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref96"><sup>96</sup></a> in Chapter I Darwin admitted, &quot;The laws governing inheritance are quite unknown.&quot;<a href="#fn97" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref97"><sup>97</sup></a> He accepted a version of the <a href="inheritance_of_acquired_characteristics" title="wikilink">inheritance of acquired characteristics</a> (which after Darwin's death came to be called <a href="Lamarckism" class="uri" title="wikilink">Lamarckism</a>), and Chapter V discusses what he called the effects of use and disuse; he wrote that he thought &quot;there can be little doubt that use in our domestic animals strengthens and enlarges certain parts, and disuse diminishes them; and that such modifications are inherited&quot;, and that this also applied in nature.<a href="#fn98" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref98"><sup>98</sup></a> Darwin stated that some changes that were commonly attributed to use and disuse, such as the loss of functional wings in some island dwelling insects, might be produced by natural selection. In later additions of <em>Origin</em>, Darwin expanded the role attributed to the inheritance of acquired characteristics. Darwin also admitted ignorance of the source of inheritable variations, but speculated they might be produced by environmental factors.<a href="#fn99" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref99"><sup>99</sup></a><a href="#fn100" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref100"><sup>100</sup></a></p>
<p>It was not until the <a href="modern_evolutionary_synthesis" title="wikilink">modern evolutionary synthesis</a> in the 1930s and 1940s that a model of heredity became completely integrated with a model of variation. Some histories of evolution and genetics, written by scientists rather than historians, have claimed that the lack of an adequate model of heredity caused suspicion of the theory of natural selection. Historians of science, however, have documented that this was not the source of most 19th century objections to Darwin, and that later scientists, such as the <a href="Biostatistics" title="wikilink">biometric</a> school, developed models of evolution by natural selection with a &quot;blending&quot; model of heredity like that used by Darwin.<a href="#fn101" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref101"><sup>101</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="difficulties-for-the-theory">Difficulties for the theory</h3>
<p>Chapter VI begins by saying the next three chapters will address possible objections to the theory, the first being that often no intermediate forms between closely related species are found, though the theory implies such forms must have existed. Darwin attributed this to the competition between different forms, combined with the small number of individuals of intermediate forms, often leading to extinction of such forms.<a href="#fn102" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref102"><sup>102</sup></a> The rest of the chapter deals with whether natural selection could produce complex specialised structures, and the behaviours to use them, when it would be difficult to imagine how intermediate forms could be functional. Darwin said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Secondly, is it possible that an animal having, for instance, the structure and habits of a bat, could have been formed by the modification of some animal with wholly different habits? Can we believe that natural selection could produce, on the one hand, organs of trifling importance, such as the tail of a giraffe, which serves as a fly-flapper, and, on the other hand, organs of such wonderful structure, as the eye, of which we hardly as yet fully understand the inimitable perfection?<a href="#fn103" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref103"><sup>103</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>His answer was that in many cases animals exist with intermediate structures that are functional. He presented <a href="flying_squirrels" title="wikilink">flying squirrels</a>, and <a href="flying_lemurs" title="wikilink">flying lemurs</a> as examples of how bats might have evolved from non-flying ancestors.<a href="#fn104" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref104"><sup>104</sup></a> He discussed various simple eyes found in invertebrates, starting with nothing more than an optic nerve coated with pigment, as examples of how the <a href="evolution_of_the_eye" title="wikilink"> vertebrate eye could have evolved</a>. Darwin concludes: &quot;If it could be demonstrated that any complex organ existed, which could not possibly have been formed by numerous, successive, slight modifications, my theory would absolutely break down. But I can find out no such case.&quot;<a href="#fn105" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref105"><sup>105</sup></a></p>
<p>Chapter VII (of the first edition) addresses the evolution of instincts. His examples included two he had investigated experimentally: slave-making ants and the construction of hexagonal cells by honey bees. Darwin noted that some species of slave-making ants were more dependent on slaves than others, and he observed that many ant species will collect and store the pupae of other species as food. He thought it reasonable that species with an extreme dependency on slave workers had evolved in incremental steps. He suggested that bees which make hexagonal cells evolved in steps from bees that made round cells, under pressure from natural selection to economise wax. Darwin concluded:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Finally, it may not be a logical deduction, but to my imagination it is far more satisfactory to look at such instincts as the young cuckoo ejecting its foster-brothers, &lt;U+2014&gt;ants making slaves, &lt;U+2014&gt;the larv&lt;U+00E6&gt; of ichneumonid&lt;U+00E6&gt; feeding within the live bodies of caterpillars, &lt;U+2014&gt;not as specially endowed or created instincts, but as small consequences of one general law, leading to the advancement of all organic beings, namely, multiply, vary, let the strongest live and the weakest die.<a href="#fn106" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref106"><sup>106</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Chapter VIII addresses the idea that species had special characteristics that prevented hybrids from being fertile in order to preserve separately created species. Darwin said that, far from being constant, the difficulty in producing hybrids of related species, and the viability and fertility of the hybrids, varied greatly, especially among plants. Sometimes what were widely considered to be separate species produced fertile hybrid offspring freely, and in other cases what were considered to be mere varieties of the same species could only be crossed with difficulty. Darwin concluded: &quot;Finally, then, the facts briefly given in this chapter do not seem to me opposed to, but even rather to support the view, that there is no fundamental distinction between species and varieties.&quot;<a href="#fn107" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref107"><sup>107</sup></a></p>
<p>In the sixth edition Darwin inserted a new chapter VII (renumbering the subsequent chapters) to respond to criticisms of earlier editions, including the objection that many features of organisms were not adaptive and could not have been produced by natural selection. He said some such features could have been by-products of adaptive changes to other features, and that often features seemed non-adaptive because their function was unknown, as shown by his book on <em><a href="Fertilisation_of_Orchids" title="wikilink">Fertilisation of Orchids</a></em> that explained how their elaborate structures facilitated pollination by insects. Much of the chapter responds to <a href="George_Jackson_Mivart" title="wikilink">George Jackson Mivart</a>'s criticisms, including his claim that features such as <a href="baleen" class="uri" title="wikilink">baleen</a> filters in whales, <a href="flatfish" class="uri" title="wikilink">flatfish</a> with both eyes on one side and the camouflage of <a href="Phasmatodea" title="wikilink">stick insects</a> could not have evolved through natural selection because intermediate stages would not have been adaptive. Darwin proposed scenarios for the incremental evolution of each feature.<a href="#fn108" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref108"><sup>108</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="geologic-record">Geologic record</h3>
<p>Chapter IX deals with the fact that the <a href="geologic_record" title="wikilink">geologic record</a> appears to show forms of life suddenly arising, without the innumerable <a href="transitional_fossil" title="wikilink">transitional fossils</a> expected from gradual changes. Darwin borrowed <a href="Charles_Lyell" title="wikilink">Charles Lyell</a>'s argument in <em><a href="Principles_of_Geology" title="wikilink">Principles of Geology</a></em> that the record is extremely imperfect as <a href="fossil" title="wikilink">fossilisation</a> is a very rare occurrence, spread over vast periods of time; since few areas had been geologically explored, there could only be fragmentary knowledge of <a href="Formation_(stratigraphy)" title="wikilink">geological formations</a>, and fossil collections were very poor. Evolved local varieties which migrated into a wider area would seem to be the sudden appearance of a new species. Darwin did not expect to be able to reconstruct evolutionary history, but continuing discoveries gave him well founded hope that new finds would occasionally reveal transitional forms.<a href="#fn109" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref109"><sup>109</sup></a><a href="#fn110" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref110"><sup>110</sup></a> To show that there had been enough time for natural selection to work slowly, he again cited <em>Principles of Geology</em> and other observations based on sedimentation and erosion, including an estimate that erosion of <a href="The_Weald" title="wikilink">The Weald</a> had taken 300 million years.<a href="#fn111" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref111"><sup>111</sup></a> The initial appearance of entire groups of well developed organisms in the oldest fossil-bearing layers, now known as the <a href="Cambrian_explosion" title="wikilink">Cambrian explosion</a>,<a href="#fn112" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref112"><sup>112</sup></a> posed a problem. Darwin had no doubt that earlier seas had swarmed with living creatures, but stated that he had no satisfactory explanation for the lack of fossils.<a href="#fn113" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref113"><sup>113</sup></a> Fossil evidence of <a href="pre-Cambrian" class="uri" title="wikilink">pre-Cambrian</a> life has since been found, extending the history of life back for billions of years.<a href="#fn114" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref114"><sup>114</sup></a></p>
<p>Chapter X examines whether patterns in the fossil record are better explained by common descent and branching evolution through natural selection than by the individual creation of fixed species. Darwin expected species to change slowly, but not at <a href="phyletic_gradualism" title="wikilink">the same rate</a> &lt;U+2013&gt; some organisms such as <a href="Lingula_(genus)" title="wikilink">Lingula</a> were unchanged since the earliest fossils. The pace of natural selection would depend on variability and change in the environment.<a href="#fn115" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref115"><sup>115</sup></a> This distanced his theory from <a href="Lamarckism" title="wikilink">Lamarckian</a> laws of inevitable progress.<a href="#fn116" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref116"><sup>116</sup></a> It has been argued that this anticipated the <a href="punctuated_equilibrium" title="wikilink">punctuated equilibrium</a> hypothesis,<a href="#fn117" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref117"><sup>117</sup></a><a href="#fn118" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref118"><sup>118</sup></a> but other scholars have preferred to emphasise Darwin's commitment to gradualism.<a href="#fn119" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref119"><sup>119</sup></a> He cited <a href="Richard_Owen" title="wikilink">Richard Owen</a>'s findings that the earliest members of a class were a few simple and generalised species with characteristics intermediate between modern forms, and were followed by increasingly diverse and specialised forms, matching the branching of common descent from an ancestor.<a href="#fn120" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref120"><sup>120</sup></a> Patterns of extinction matched his theory, with related groups of species having a continued existence until extinction, then not reappearing. Recently extinct species were more similar to living species than those from earlier eras, and as he had seen in South America, and <a href="William_Clift" title="wikilink">William Clift</a> had shown in Australia, fossils from recent geological periods resembled those still living in the same area.<a href="#fn121" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref121"><sup>121</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="geographic-distribution">Geographic distribution</h3>
<p>Chapter XI deals with evidence from <a href="biogeography" class="uri" title="wikilink">biogeography</a>, starting with the observation that differences in flora and fauna from separate regions cannot be explained by environmental differences alone; South America, Africa, and Australia all have regions with similar climates at similar latitudes, but those regions have very different plants and animals. The species found in one area of a continent are much more closely allied with species found in other regions of that same continent than to the species found on other continents. Darwin noted that barriers to migration played an important role in the differences between the species of different regions. The coastal sea life of the Atlantic and Pacific sides of Central America had almost no species in common even though the <a href="Isthmus_of_Panama" title="wikilink">Isthmus of Panama</a> was only a few miles wide. His explanation was a combination of migration and descent with modification. He went on to say: &quot;On this principle of inheritance with modification, we can understand how it is that sections of genera, whole genera, and even families are confined to the same areas, as is so commonly and notoriously the case.&quot;<a href="#fn122" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref122"><sup>122</sup></a> Darwin explained how a volcanic island formed a few hundred miles from a continent might be colonised by a few species from that continent. These species would become modified over time, but would still be related to species found on the continent, and Darwin observed that this was a common pattern. Darwin discussed ways that species could be dispersed across oceans to colonise islands, many of which he had investigated experimentally.<a href="#fn123" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref123"><sup>123</sup></a></p>
<p>Chapter XII continues the discussion of biogeography. After a brief discussion of freshwater species, it returns to oceanic islands and their peculiarities; for example on some islands roles played by mammals on continents were played by other animals such as flightless birds or reptiles. The summary of both chapters says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>...Â I think all the grand leading facts of geographical distribution are explicable on the theory of migration (generally of the more dominant forms of life), together with subsequent modification and the multiplication of new forms. We can thus understand the high importance of barriers, whether of land or water, which separate our several zoological and botanical provinces. We can thus understand the localisation of sub-genera, genera, and families; and how it is that under different latitudes, for instance in South America, the inhabitants of the plains and mountains, of the forests, marshes, and deserts, are in so mysterious a manner linked together by affinity, and are likewise linked to the extinct beings which formerly inhabited the same continentÂ ... On these same principles, we can understand, as I have endeavoured to show, why oceanic islands should have few inhabitants, but of these a great number should be endemic or peculiar;Â ...<a href="#fn124" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref124"><sup>124</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="classification-morphology-embryology-rudimentary-organs">Classification, morphology, embryology, rudimentary organs</h3>
<p>Chapter XIII starts by observing that classification depends on species being grouped together in a multilevel system of groups and sub groups based on varying degrees of resemblance. After discussing classification issues, Darwin concludes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All the foregoing rules and aids and difficulties in classification are explained, if I do not greatly deceive myself, on the view that the natural system is founded on descent with modification; that the characters which naturalists consider as showing true affinity between any two or more species, are those which have been inherited from a common parent, and, in so far, all true classification is genealogical; that community of descent is the hidden bond which naturalists have been unconsciously seeking,Â ...<a href="#fn125" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref125"><sup>125</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Darwin discusses <a href="morphology_(biology)" title="wikilink"> morphology</a>, including the importance of <a href="homology_(biology)" title="wikilink"> homologous structures</a>. He says, &quot;What can be more curious than that the hand of a man, formed for grasping, that of a mole for digging, the leg of the horse, the paddle of the porpoise, and the wing of the bat, should all be constructed on the same pattern, and should include the same bones, in the same relative positions?&quot;<a href="#fn126" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref126"><sup>126</sup></a> He notes that animals of the same class often have extremely similar <a href="embryology" title="wikilink">embryos</a>. Darwin discusses rudimentary organs, such as the wings of flightless birds and the rudiments of pelvis and leg bones found in some snakes. He remarks that some rudimentary organs, such as teeth in <a href="baleen_whales" title="wikilink">baleen whales</a>, are found only in embryonic stages.</p>
<h3 id="concluding-remarks">Concluding remarks</h3>
<p>The final chapter reviews points from earlier chapters, and Darwin concludes by hoping that his theory might produce revolutionary changes in many fields of natural history. He ends with a passage that became well known and much quoted:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is interesting to contemplate an entangled bank, clothed with many plants of many kinds, with birds singing on the bushes, with various insects flitting about, and with worms crawling through the damp earth, and to reflect that these elaborately constructed forms, so different from each other, and dependent on each other in so complex a manner, have all been produced by laws acting around us... Thus, from the war of nature, from famine and death, the most exalted object which we are capable of conceiving, namely, the production of the higher animals, directly follows. There is grandeur in this view of life, with its several powers, having been originally breathed into a few forms or into one; and that, whilst this planet has gone cycling on according to the fixed law of gravity, from so simple a beginning endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful have been, and are being, evolved.<a href="#fn127" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref127"><sup>127</sup></a></p>

<h3 id="nature-and-structure-of-darwins-argument">Nature and structure of Darwin's argument</h3>
<p>Darwin's aims were twofold: to show that species had not been separately created, and to show that <a href="natural_selection" title="wikilink">natural selection</a> had been the chief agent of change.<a href="#fn128" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref128"><sup>128</sup></a> He knew that his readers were already familiar with the concept of transmutation of species from <em><a href="Vestiges_of_the_Natural_History_of_Creation" title="wikilink">Vestiges</a></em>, and his introduction ridicules that work as failing to provide a viable mechanism.<a href="#fn129" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref129"><sup>129</sup></a> The first four chapters lay out his case that selection in nature, caused by the struggle for existence, is analogous to the selection of variations under domestication, and that the accumulation of adaptive variations provides a scientifically testable mechanism for evolutionary <a href="speciation" class="uri" title="wikilink">speciation</a>.<a href="#fn130" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref130"><sup>130</sup></a><a href="#fn131" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref131"><sup>131</sup></a></p>
<p>Later chapters provide evidence that evolution has occurred, supporting the idea of branching, adaptive evolution without directly proving that selection is the mechanism. Darwin presents supporting facts drawn from many disciplines, showing that his theory could explain a myriad of observations from many fields of natural history that were inexplicable under alternate concepts, such as the idea tha species have been individually created.<a href="#fn132" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref132"><sup>132</sup></a><a href="#fn133" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref133"><sup>133</sup></a><a href="#fn134" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref134"><sup>134</sup></a> Darwin was influenced by <a href="John_Herschel" title="wikilink">John Herschel</a>, whose philosophy of science maintained that a mechanism could be called a <em>vera causa</em> (true cause) if three things could be demonstrated: its existence in nature, its ability to produce the effects of interest, and its ability to explain a wide range of observations.<a href="#fn135" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref135"><sup>135</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="literary-style">Literary style</h3>
<p>The <em>Examiner</em> review of 3 December 1859 commented, &quot;Much of Mr. Darwin's volume is what ordinary readers would call 'tough reading;' that is, writing which to comprehend requires concentrated attention and some preparation for the task. All, however, is by no means of this description, and many parts of the book abound in information, easy to comprehend and both instructive and entertaining.&quot;<a href="#fn136" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref136"><sup>136</sup></a><a href="#fn137" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref137"><sup>137</sup></a></p>
<p>While the book was readable enough to sell, its dryness ensured that it was seen as aimed at specialist scientists and could not be dismissed as mere journalism or imaginative fiction. Unlike the still-popular <em>Vestiges</em>, it avoided the narrative style of the historical novel and cosmological speculation, though the closing sentence clearly hinted at cosmic progression. Darwin had long been immersed in the literary forms and practices of specialist science, and made effective use of his skills in structuring arguments.<a href="#fn138" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref138"><sup>138</sup></a> <a href="David_Quammen" title="wikilink">David Quammen</a> has described the book as written in everyday language for a wide audience, but noted that Darwin's literary style was uneven: in some places he used convoluted sentences that are difficult to read; in other places his writing was beautiful. Quammen advised that later editions were weakened by Darwin making concessions and adding details to address his critics, and recommended the first edition.<a href="#fn139" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref139"><sup>139</sup></a> James T. Costa said that because the book was an abstract produced in haste in response to Wallace's essay, it was more approachable than the big book on natural selection Darwin had been working on, which would have been encumbered by scholarly footnotes and much more technical detail. He added that parts of <em>Origin</em> are dense, but parts are almost lyrical, and the case studies and observations are presented in a narrative style unusual in serious scientific books, which broadened its audience.<a href="#fn140" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref140"><sup>140</sup></a></p>

<p>The book aroused international interest<a href="#fn142" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref142"><sup>142</sup></a> and a widespread debate, with no sharp line between scientific issues and ideological, social and religious implications.<a href="#fn143" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref143"><sup>143</sup></a> Much of the initial reaction was hostile, but Darwin had to be taken seriously as a prominent and respected name in science. There was much less controversy than had greeted the 1844 publication <em><a href="Vestiges_of_Creation" title="wikilink">Vestiges of Creation</a></em>, which had been rejected by scientists,<a href="#fn144" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref144"><sup>144</sup></a> but had influenced a wide public readership into believing that nature and human society were governed by natural laws.<a href="#fn145" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref145"><sup>145</sup></a> The <em>Origin of Species</em> as a book of wide general interest became associated with ideas of social reform.

<h3 id="impact-on-the-scientific-community">Impact on the scientific community</h3>

<p>Scientific readers were already aware of arguments that species changed through processes that were subject to <a href="Physical_law" title="wikilink">laws of nature</a>, but the transmutational ideas of Lamarck and the vague &quot;law of development&quot; of <em>Vestiges</em> had not found scientific favour. Darwin presented <a href="natural_selection" title="wikilink">natural selection</a> as a scientifically testable mechanism while accepting that other mechanisms such as <a href="inheritance_of_acquired_characters" title="wikilink">inheritance of acquired characters</a> were possible. His strategy established that evolution through natural laws was worthy of scientific study, and by 1875, most scientists accepted that evolution occurred but few thought natural selection was significant.

Haeckel used <a href="embryology" class="uri" title="wikilink">embryology</a> extensively in his <a href="recapitulation_theory" title="wikilink">recapitulation theory</a>, which embodied a progressive, almost linear model of evolution. Darwin was cautious about such histories, and had already noted that <a href="Karl_Ernst_von_Baer" title="wikilink">von Baer's</a> laws of embryology supported his idea of complex branching.<a href="#fn168" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref168"><sup>168</sup></a></p>
<p><a href="Asa_Gray" title="wikilink">Asa Gray</a> promoted and defended <em>Origin</em> against those American naturalists with an idealist approach, notably <a href="Louis_Agassiz" title="wikilink">Louis Agassiz</a> who viewed every species as a distinct fixed unit in the mind of the Creator, classifying as species what others considered merely varieties. <a href="Edward_Drinker_Cope" title="wikilink">Edward Drinker Cope</a> and <a href="Alpheus_Hyatt" title="wikilink">Alpheus Hyatt</a> reconciled this view with evolutionism in a form of <a href="Lamarckism#neo-Lamarckism" title="wikilink">neo-Lamarckism</a> involving recapitulation theory.<a href="#fn169" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref169"><sup>169</sup></a></p>
<p>French speaking naturalists in several countries showed appreciation of the much modified French translation by <a href="Cl&lt;U+00E9&gt;mence_Royer" title="wikilink">Cl&lt;U+00E9&gt;mence Royer</a>, but Darwin's ideas had little impact in France, where any scientists supporting evolutionary ideas opted for a form of Lamarckism.<a href="#fn170" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref170"><sup>170</sup></a> The intelligentsia in Russia had accepted the general phenomenon of evolution for several years before Darwin had published his theory, and scientists were quick to take it into account, although the <a href="Malthusianism" title="wikilink">Malthusian</a> aspects were felt to be relatively unimportant. The political economy of struggle was criticised as a British stereotype by <a href="Karl_Marx" title="wikilink">Karl Marx</a> and by <a href="Leo_Tolstoy" title="wikilink">Leo Tolstoy</a>, who had the character Levin in his novel <em><a href="Anna_Karenina" title="wikilink">Anna Karenina</a></em> voice sharp criticism of the morality of Darwin's views.<a href="#fn171" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref171"><sup>171</sup></a></p>
<h4 id="challenges-to-natural-selection">Challenges to natural selection</h4>
<p>There were serious scientific objections to the process of <a href="natural_selection" title="wikilink">natural selection</a> as the key mechanism of evolution, including <a href="Karl_Wilhelm_von_N&lt;U+00E4&gt;geli" title="wikilink">Karl von N&lt;U+00E4&gt;geli</a>'s insistence that a trivial characteristic with no adaptive advantage could not be developed by selection. Darwin conceded that these could be linked to adaptive characteristics. His estimate that the <a href="age_of_the_Earth" title="wikilink">age of the Earth</a> allowed gradual evolution was disputed by <a href="William_Thomson,_1st_Baron_Kelvin" title="wikilink">William Thomson (later awarded the title Lord Kelvin)</a>, who calculated that it had cooled in less than 100 million years. Darwin accepted <a href="blending_inheritance" title="wikilink">blending inheritance</a>, but <a href="Fleeming_Jenkin" title="wikilink">Fleeming Jenkin</a> calculated that as it mixed traits, natural selection could not accumulate useful traits. Darwin tried to meet these objections in the 5th edition. <a href="St._George_Jackson_Mivart" title="wikilink">Mivart</a> supported directed evolution, and compiled scientific and religious objections to natural selection. In response, Darwin made considerable changes to the sixth edition. The problems of the age of the Earth and heredity were only resolved in the 20th century.<a href="#fn172" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref172"><sup>172</sup></a><a href="#fn173" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref173"><sup>173</sup></a></p>
<p>By the mid 1870s, most scientists accepted evolution, but relegated natural selection to a minor role as they believed evolution was purposeful and progressive. The range of evolutionary theories during &quot;<a href="the_eclipse_of_Darwinism" title="wikilink">the eclipse of Darwinism</a>&quot; included forms of &quot;<a href="Saltation_(biology)" title="wikilink">saltationism</a>&quot; in which new species were thought to arise through &quot;jumps&quot; rather than gradual adaptation, forms of <a href="orthogenesis" class="uri" title="wikilink">orthogenesis</a> claiming that species had an inherent tendency to change in a particular direction, and forms of neo-Lamarckism in which inheritance of acquired characteristics led to progress. The minority view of <a href="August_Weismann" title="wikilink">August Weismann</a>, that natural selection was the only mechanism, was called <a href="neo-Darwinism" class="uri" title="wikilink">neo-Darwinism</a>. It was thought that the rediscovery of <a href="Mendelian_inheritance" title="wikilink">Mendelian inheritance</a> invalidated Darwin's views.<a href="#fn174" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref174"><sup>174</sup></a><a href="#fn175" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref175"><sup>175</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="religious-attitudes">Religious attitudes</h3>
<p>The book produced a wide range of religious responses at a time of changing ideas and increasing secularisation. The issues raised were complex and there was a large middle ground. <a href="history_of_geology" title="wikilink">Developments in geology</a> meant that there was little opposition based on a literal reading of <a href="Genesis" class="uri" title="wikilink">Genesis</a>,<a href="#fn176" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref176"><sup>176</sup></a> but defence of the <a href="teleological_argument" title="wikilink">argument from design</a> and <a href="natural_theology" title="wikilink">natural theology</a> was central to debates over the book in the English speaking world.<a href="#fn177" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref177"><sup>177</sup></a><a href="#fn178" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref178"><sup>178</sup></a> <img src="Rev_Baden_Powell.jpg" title="fig:The liberal theologian Baden Powell defended evolutionary ideas by arguing that the introduction of new species should be considered a natural rather than a miraculous process.." alt="The liberal theologian Baden Powell defended evolutionary ideas by arguing that the introduction of new species should be considered a natural rather than a miraculous process.." /> Natural theology was not a unified doctrine, and while some such as <a href="Louis_Agassiz" title="wikilink">Louis Agassiz</a> were strongly opposed to the ideas in the book, others sought a reconciliation in which evolution was seen as purposeful.<a href="#fn179" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref179"><sup>179</sup></a> In the <a href="Church_of_England" title="wikilink">Church of England</a>, some <a href="liberal_Christianity" title="wikilink">liberal clergymen</a> interpreted natural selection as an instrument of God's design, with the cleric <a href="Charles_Kingsley" title="wikilink">Charles Kingsley</a> seeing it as &quot;just as noble a conception of Deity&quot;.<a href="#fn180" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref180"><sup>180</sup></a><a href="#fn181" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref181"><sup>181</sup></a> In the second edition of January 1860, Darwin quoted Kingsley as &quot;a celebrated cleric&quot;, and added the phrase &quot;by the Creator&quot; to the closing sentence, which from then on read &quot;life, with its several powers, having been originally breathed by the Creator into a few forms or into one&quot;.<a href="#fn182" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref182"><sup>182</sup></a> While some commentators have taken this as a concession to religion that Darwin later regretted,<a href="#fn183" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref183"><sup>183</sup></a> Darwin's view at the time was of God creating life through the laws of nature,<a href="#fn184" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref184"><sup>184</sup></a> <a href="#fn185" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref185"><sup>185</sup></a> and even in the first edition there are several references to &quot;creation&quot;.<a href="#fn186" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref186"><sup>186</sup></a></p>

<p>Even though the book had barely hinted at <a href="Human_evolution" title="wikilink">Human evolution</a>, it was at the centre of debate as mental and moral qualities were seen as spiritual aspects of the immaterial <a href="soul" class="uri" title="wikilink">soul</a>, and it was believed that animals did not have spiritual qualities. This conflict could be reconciled by supposing there was some supernatural intervention on the path leading to humans, or viewing evolution as a purposeful and progressive ascent to mankind's position at the head of nature.<a href="#fn193" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref193"><sup>193</sup></a> While many conservative theologians accepted evolution, <a href="Charles_Hodge" title="wikilink">Charles Hodge</a> argued in his 1874 critique &quot;What is Darwinism?&quot; that &quot;<a href="Darwinism" class="uri" title="wikilink">Darwinism</a>&quot;, defined narrowly as including rejection of design, was atheism though he accepted that Asa Gray did not reject design.<a href="#fn194" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref194"><sup>194</sup></a><a href="#fn195" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref195"><sup>195</sup></a> Asa Gray responded that this charge misrepresented Darwin's text.<a href="#fn196" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref196"><sup>196</sup></a> By the early 20th century, four noted authors of <em><a href="The_Fundamentals" title="wikilink">The Fundamentals</a></em> were explicitly open to the possibility that God created through evolution,<a href="#fn197" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref197"><sup>197</sup></a> but <a href="fundamentalism" class="uri" title="wikilink">fundamentalism</a> inspired the American <a href="creation&lt;U+2013&gt;evolution_controversy" title="wikilink">creation&lt;U+2013&gt;evolution controversy</a> which began in the 1920s.
