<p>&quot;<strong>One Tree Hill</strong>&quot; is a song by <a href="rock_music" title="wikilink">rock</a> band <a href="U2" class="uri" title="wikilink">U2</a> and is the ninth track on their 1987 album <em><a href="The_Joshua_Tree" title="wikilink">The Joshua Tree</a></em>. In March 1988, it was released as the fourth single from the album in New Zealand and Australia, while &quot;<a href="In_God&#39;s_Country" title="wikilink">In God's Country</a>&quot; was released as the fourth single in North America. The release charted at number one on the <a href="Recording_Industry_Association_of_New_Zealand" title="wikilink">New Zealand singles chart</a>.</p>
<p>The track was written in memory of Greg Carroll, a <a href="M&lt;U+0101&gt;ori_people" title="wikilink">M&lt;U+0101&gt;ori</a> the band met during <a href="The_Unforgettable_Fire_Tour" title="wikilink">The Unforgettable Fire Tour</a> in 1984. He became very close friends with lead singer <a href="Bono" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bono</a> and served as a <a href="road_crew" title="wikilink">roadie</a> for the group. Carroll was killed in July 1986 in a motorcycle accident in Dublin. Following the funeral in New Zealand, Bono wrote the lyrics to &quot;One Tree Hill&quot;, which he dedicated to Carroll. The lyrics reflect Bono's thoughts at the funeral and pay homage to Chilean activist <a href="Victor_Jara" title="wikilink">Victor Jara</a>. Musically, the song was developed in a <a href="jam_session" title="wikilink">jam session</a> with producer <a href="Brian_Eno" title="wikilink">Brian Eno</a>. The vocals were recorded in a single take, as Bono felt incapable of singing them a second time.</p>
<p>&quot;One Tree Hill&quot; was received favourably by critics, who variously described it as &quot;a soft, haunting benediction&quot;,<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> &quot;a remarkable musical centrepiece&quot;,<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> and a celebration of life.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> U2 delayed performing the song on the <a href="Joshua_Tree_Tour" title="wikilink">Joshua Tree Tour</a> in 1987 due to Bono's fears over his emotional state. After its live debut on the tour's third leg and an enthusiastic reaction from audiences, the song was played occasionally for the rest of the tour and semi-regularly during the <a href="Lovetown_Tour" title="wikilink">Lovetown Tour</a> of 1989&lt;U+2013&gt;1990. It has appeared only sporadically since then, and most renditions were performed in New Zealand. Performances in November 2010 on the <a href="U2_360&lt;U+00B0&gt;_Tour" title="wikilink">U2 360&lt;U+00B0&gt; Tour</a> were dedicated to the miners who died in the <a href="Pike_River_Mine_disaster" title="wikilink">Pike River Mine disaster</a>.</p>

<p>U2 first visited Australia and New Zealand in 1984 to open <a href="The_Unforgettable_Fire_Tour" title="wikilink">The Unforgettable Fire Tour</a>.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> After a 24-hour flight into Auckland, lead singer <a href="Bono" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bono</a> was unable to adjust to the time difference between New Zealand and Europe. During the night, he left his hotel room and met some people at a bar who showed him around the city.

<p>On 3 July 1986,<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> just before the start of the recording sessions for <em><a href="The_Joshua_Tree" title="wikilink">The Joshua Tree</a></em>, Carroll was killed in a motorcycle accident while on a courier run. A car had pulled in front of him, and unable to stop in the rain, Carroll struck the side of the car and was killed instantly.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> The event shocked the entire band; drummer <a href="Larry_Mullen,_Jr." title="wikilink">Larry Mullen, Jr.</a> said, &quot;his death really rocked us &lt;U+2013&gt; it was the first time anyone in our working circle had been killed.&quot;<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> Guitarist <a href="The_Edge" title="wikilink">The Edge</a> said, &quot;Greg was like a member of the family, but the fact that he had come under our wing and had travelled so far from home to be in Dublin to work with us made it all the more difficult to deal with.&quot;<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> Bassist <a href="Adam_Clayton" title="wikilink">Adam Clayton</a> described it as &quot;a very sobering moment&quot;, saying, &quot;it inspired the awareness that there are more important things than rock 'n' roll. That your family, your friends and indeed the other members of the band &lt;U+2013&gt; you don't know how much time you've got left with them.&quot;<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a><a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> Bono said, &quot;it was a devastating blow. He was doing me a favour. He was taking my bike home.&quot;<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> He later commented, &quot;it brought gravitas to the recording of <em>The Joshua Tree</em>. We had to fill the hole in our heart with something very, very large indeed, we loved him so much.&quot;<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> Accompanied by Bono, Ali, Mullen, and other members of the U2 organisation, Carroll's body was flown back to New Zealand and buried in the traditional M&lt;U+0101&gt;ori manner at Kai-iwi Marae.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a><a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> Bono sang &quot;<a href="Let_It_Be_(song)" title="wikilink">Let It Be</a>&quot; and &quot;<a href="Knockin&#39;_on_Heaven&#39;s_Door" title="wikilink">Knockin' on Heaven's Door</a>&quot; for him at the funeral.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a></p>
<p>Shortly after returning to Dublin, Bono wrote lyrics for a song about the funeral that he titled &quot;One Tree Hill&quot; after the hill he remembered from his visit to Auckland in 1984.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> The music was developed early in the recording sessions for <em>The Joshua Tree</em>. The Edge said, &quot;We were jamming with <a href="Brian_Eno" title="wikilink">Brian [Eno</a>]. He was playing keyboards ... we just got this groove going, and this part began to come through. It's almost <a href="highlife" class="uri" title="wikilink">highlife</a>, although it's not African at all ... the sound was for me at that time a very elaborate one. I would never have dreamt of using a sound like that before then, but it just felt right, and I went with it.&quot;<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> Bono recorded his vocals in a single take, as he felt that he could not sing the lyrics a second time.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> Three musicians from <a href="Toronto" class="uri" title="wikilink">Toronto</a>, Dick, Paul and Adele Armin, recorded string pieces for the song in Grant Avenue Studio in <a href="Hamilton,_Ontario" title="wikilink">Hamilton, Ontario</a>. In a six-hour phone call with The Edge, and under the supervision of producer <a href="Daniel_Lanois" title="wikilink">Daniel Lanois</a>, the Armins used &quot;sophisticated 'electro-acoustic' string instrument[s]&quot; they developed called Raads to record a piece created for the song.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> Dick Armin said, &quot;[U2] were interested in using strings, but not in the conventional style of sweetening. They didn't want a 19th-century group playing behind them.&quot;<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> Bono found the song so emotional, he was unable to listen to it after it had been recorded.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a></p>
<p>In the song, Bono included the lyric: &quot;Jara sang, his song a weapon in the hands of love / You know his blood still cries from the ground&quot;. This refers to the Chilean political activist and folk singer <a href="Victor_Jara" title="wikilink">Victor Jara</a>, who become a symbol of the resistance against the <a href="Augusto_Pinochet" title="wikilink">Augusto Pinochet</a> government after he was tortured and killed during the <a href="1973_Chilean_coup_d&#39;&lt;U+00E9&gt;tat" title="wikilink">1973 Chilean coup d'&lt;U+00E9&gt;tat</a>.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> Bono learned of Jara after meeting Ren&lt;U+00E9&gt; Castro, a Chilean mural artist, while on <a href="Amnesty_International" title="wikilink">Amnesty International</a>'s <a href="A_Conspiracy_of_Hope" title="wikilink">A Conspiracy of Hope</a> tour. Castro had been tortured and held in a concentration camp for two years by the <a href="Dictatorship" title="wikilink">dictatorial</a> Chilean government because his artwork criticised the Pinochet-led <a href="Military_government_of_Chile_(1973&lt;U+2013&gt;1990)" title="wikilink">regime</a> that had seized power in 1973 during the coup.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> While purchasing a <a href="screen_printing" title="wikilink">silkscreen</a> of <a href="Martin_Luther_King,_Jr." title="wikilink">Martin Luther King, Jr.</a> that Castro had created, Bono noticed a print of Jara.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a><a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> He became more familiar with him after reading <em>Una Canci&lt;U+00F3&gt;n Truncada</em> (), written by Jara's widow Joan Turner.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a></p>

<p>&quot;One Tree Hill&quot; runs for 5:23 (5 minutes, 23 seconds). It is played in <a href="Time_signature" title="wikilink">common time</a> at a <a href="tempo" class="uri" title="wikilink">tempo</a> of 120 beats per minute.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> The song begins with a highlife-influenced riff by The Edge on guitar, which repeats in the background throughout the song.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a><a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> Percussion from drummer <a href="Larry_Mullen,_Jr." title="wikilink">Larry Mullen, Jr.</a> enters after two seconds.

At 1:32, the song moves to the chorus, switching to a C&lt;U+2013&gt;B&lt;U+2013&gt;F&lt;U+2013&gt;C chord progression. The second verse then begins at 1:49, and after the second chorus, a brief musical interlude begins at 2:36, in which The Edge's guitar is replaced by the Raad strings.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> The third verse begins at 3:07, and The Edge's guitar resumes at 3:38 in the chorus. A guitar solo begins at 4:16 and is played until the instrumentation comes to a close at 4:36. After two seconds of silence, the Raad strings fade in and Bono proceeds to sing the coda. The final lyric and strings fade out over the final six seconds.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a></p>
<p>Clayton called it part of a trilogy of songs on the album, along with &quot;<a href="Bullet_the_Blue_Sky" title="wikilink">Bullet the Blue Sky</a>&quot; and &quot;<a href="Mothers_of_the_Disappeared" title="wikilink">Mothers of the Disappeared</a>&quot;, that decry the involvement of the United States in the Chilean coup.<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> McGuinness stated that the imagery in the song described the sense of tragedy felt by the band over Carroll's death.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a> Colm O'Hare of <em><a href="Hot_Press" title="wikilink">Hot Press</a></em> believed The Edge's guitar riff personified the lyric &quot;run like a river runs to the sea&quot;.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a> Thom Duffy of the <em><a href="Orlando_Sentinel" title="wikilink">Orlando Sentinel</a></em> felt the song reflected the seducation of a lover.<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a> Richard Harrington of the <em><a href="Washington_Post" title="wikilink">Washington Post</a></em> acknowledged the tribute to Carroll, adding that it demonstrated U2's belief that music could spur change.<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a></p>
<p>Like many other U2 songs, &quot;One Tree Hill&quot; can be interpreted in a religious manner. <em>Hot Press</em> editor <a href="Niall_Stokes" title="wikilink">Niall Stokes</a> called it &quot;a spiritual tour de force&quot;, saying &quot;it is a hymn of praise and celebration which described the traditional M&lt;U+0101&gt;ori burial of their friend on One Tree Hill and links it poetically with themes of renewal and redemption.&quot;<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a> Beth Maynard, a Church <a href="Rector#Ecclesiastical_rectors" title="wikilink">rector</a> from Fairhaven, Massachusetts, felt the song &quot;vows faith in the face of loss, combining elegiac lines about a friend ... and the martyred Chilean activist and folk singer Victor Jara, with a subtle evocation of end-time redemption and a wrenching wail to God to send the pentecostal Latter Rain.&quot;<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a> Matt Soper, Senior Minister of the West Houston Church of Christ, believed the lyrics were an attempt by Bono to understand God's place in the world.<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a> Steve Stockman, a chaplain at <a href="Queen&#39;s_University_of_Belfast" title="wikilink">Queen's University of Belfast</a>, felt that the song alluded to &quot;transcendent places beyond the space and time of earth&quot;.<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a> Music journalist Bill Graham noted &quot;the lyrics, with their reference to traditional M&lt;U+0101&gt;ori burial ceremonies on One Tree Hill, indicated that the band's faith didn't exclude an empathy with others' beliefs and rituals. Their Christianity wouldn't plaster over the universal archetypes of mourning.&quot;<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a> </p>

<p>In 2009, when asked about the likelihood of U2 performing the song, The Edge said, &quot;it's one we kind of keep for special occasions, like playing New Zealand.&quot; Bono added, &quot;it's a very special song that holds inside of it a lot of strong feelings, and I don't know if we're afraid of it or something, but we should be playing it more.&quot;<a href="#fn90" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref90"><sup>90</sup></a> McGuinness said that U2 found it difficult to play live.<a href="#fn91" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref91"><sup>91</sup></a> </p>
