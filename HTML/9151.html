<p><strong>Hilja Elisabet Riipinen</strong> (30 October 1883 &lt;U+2013&gt; 18 January 1966, n&lt;U+00E9&gt;e <strong>Miklin</strong>, later <strong>Mets&lt;U+00E4&gt;polku</strong>) was a <a href="Finland" title="wikilink">Finnish</a> politician involved with the nationalist and anti-communist <a href="Lapua_Movement" title="wikilink">Lapua Movement</a> and <a href="Patriotic_People&#39;s_Movement_(Finland)" title="wikilink">Patriotic People's Movement</a> (IKL). She was a <a href="member_of_parliament" title="wikilink">member of parliament</a> between 1930 and 1939, first elected from the electoral list of the <a href="National_Coalition_Party" title="wikilink">National Coalition Party</a>, but she defected to the Patriotic People's Movement after it was formed as a political party in 1933.</p>
<p>Being deeply religious, one of the most vehemently anti-communist IKL MPs and her support for radical elements in the movement proved troublesome for her relations outside of the party. This earned her the nickname <em>Hurja-Hilja</em>, or &quot;Wild Hilja&quot;.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="early-life-and-education">Early life and education</h2>
<p>Hilja Miklin was born to a family of eight children in <a href="Oulu" title="wikilink">Oulujoki</a> in 1883. The family was a part of the <a href="Awakening_(religious_movement)" title="wikilink">Awakening</a> (<em>Her&lt;U+00E4&gt;nn&lt;U+00E4&gt;isyys</em>) Lutheran religious movement.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> Found to be gifted, Hilja was granted a place in the all-girls school in Oulu. She completed student <a href="matriculation" class="uri" title="wikilink">matriculation</a> in 1902.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> She wanted to be a school teacher and started studies in languages, literature and aesthetics in the <a href="University_of_Helsinki" title="wikilink">University of Helsinki</a>, financed with a bank loan. Initially she desired to be teaching the <a href="German_language" title="wikilink">German language</a>, but due to its poor employment prospects in comparison with the <a href="Russian_language" title="wikilink">Russian language</a>, she switched to Russian.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> Hilja was employed in a co-educational school in <a href="Lapua" class="uri" title="wikilink">Lapua</a> in 1906, however she graduated with a master's degree later in 1910.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> She met her future husband, <a href="Heikki_Riipinen" title="wikilink">Ale Riipinen</a>, at the school. Eventually her husband moved to <a href="Jyv&lt;U+00E4&gt;skyl&lt;U+00E4&gt;" class="uri" title="wikilink">Jyv&lt;U+00E4&gt;skyl&lt;U+00E4&gt;</a> to head another school there in 1929, while Hilja stayed in Lapua as the head teacher of the co-educational.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>

She was chosen to the Lotta Sv&lt;U+00E4&gt;rd central board of directors in 1923 and quickly became a central figure and a well-liked speaker in the organisation. However, she declined inquiries to become the chairperson for the national level.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> She also became the editor for the Lotta Sv&lt;U+00E4&gt;rd newspaper. Riipinen later became known as a person who often had dissenting opinions about decisions made in the board of directors. In particular, she criticized leader <a href="Fanni_Luukkonen" title="wikilink">Fanni Luukkonen</a> for not participating in IKL meetings but participating in women's day events where left-wing people were invited as well. Riipinen was not chosen to the board of directors again and was also dismissed from her position as the editor of the Lotta Sv&lt;U+00E4&gt;rd newspaper.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> Her ties with the organisation were later however restored during World War II.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="politics">Politics</h2>
<h3 id="womens-rights-and-temperance-advocate">Women's rights and temperance advocate</h3>
<p>Riipinen was a strict proponent of equal rights for women. She was influenced by the early Finnish female parlamentarian <a href="Hilda_K&lt;U+00E4&gt;kikoski" title="wikilink">Hilda K&lt;U+00E4&gt;kikoski</a>, from whom she also adopted pacifist ideas.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> In her earlier speeches, there was a sense of confrontation between the sexes, but this view yielded in favour of cooperation with men. Riipinen believed that women should be liberated for a public awakening and activation through education. She supported the <a href="ordination_of_women" title="wikilink">ordination of women</a> for priesthood in the church.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<p>Riipinen was also involved with the <a href="temperance_movement" title="wikilink">temperance movement</a>. She supported the law on prohibition and stricter penalties for violating it. She was a board member on a women's national temperance organisation between 1921 and 1931.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="anti-communism">Anti-communism</h3>
<p>Hilja Riipinen's anti-communism was sparked by the <a href="Finnish_Civil_War" title="wikilink">Finnish Civil War</a>. It turned into relentless hostility against socialism and she kept reminding of the &quot;bloody Marxist revolution enthusiasm in 1918&quot; in her speeches for years.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> Her views have been described as one having to take part in a conflict between Marxist and non-Marxist worldviews, of which only one can win. She also felt that this was a flaw in the political system: democracy could only lead to bad compromises in her view.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> Being fond of &quot;high spirituality&quot;, she opposed Marxist materialism. Riipinen thought that socialism poisoned people's relationship to work by claiming that work is slavery.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> Her radical views were widely noted in left-wing circles who considered her one of the worst agitators. Socialist newspapers wrote about &quot;Amazon Hilja Riipinen&quot; and referred to the &quot;white fists of Hilja Riipinen&quot;.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="member-of-parliament">Member of parliament</h3>
<p>Riipinen was elected to the <a href="Parliament_of_Finland" title="wikilink">Parliament of Finland</a> in the <a href="Finnish_parliamentary_election,_1930" title="wikilink">1930 parliamentary election</a> from the National Coalition Party electoral list. Her relations within the party became strained as she was straightforward and did not prefer to compromise. She was one of the few in her parliamentary group who supported the shift towards radicalisation in the Lapua Movement. For this reason, Lapua supporters once told that: &quot;There is only one man in the parliament, and that one happens to be a woman&quot;.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
<p>When the Patriotic People's Movement was formed as a political party in 1933, Hilja Riipinen defected to their parliamentary group and was the only woman among the 14 MPs. Riipinen was among the most radical in the IKL parliamentary group as well, receiving a warning for impetuosity from the party. She was supportive of the <a href="fascism" title="wikilink">fascist</a> regimes of Italy and Germany, a line which was not mainstream in the IKL.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> She also conflicted with the IKL leadership when she led the women's section for the party, with male IKL leadership seizing a board meeting to prevent what they saw as harmful decisions being made.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1934, Riipinen was suspended from the parliament for a week for insulting the speaker of the parliament. She became a well-known figure and was mockingly called the &quot;<a href="L&#39;enfant_terrible" title="wikilink"><em>enfant terrible</em></a> of the parliament&quot;.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> <a href="Social_Democratic_Party_of_Finland" title="wikilink">Social Democrat</a> <a href="Karl-August_Fagerholm" title="wikilink">Karl-August Fagerholm</a> told of her: &quot;Riipinen is the most fanatical politician I have ever met. And when that political person is a woman, there are no limits or borders to that fanaticism&quot;.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a></p>
<p>Personally, Hilja Riipinen was not satisfied with working as a member of parliament and found it be heavy and fruitless. She even became depressed about being in the parliament.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> She was not re-elected in 1939 and according to her own words returned to do &quot;real work&quot;.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="later-life">Later life</h2>
<p>After not being re-elected, she returned to work at the Lapua co-educational school as the head teacher. She retired when she was 70 years old in June 1953. She was granted the honorary title for people having done their career in education, <em>kouluneuvos</em>, by the <a href="President_of_Finland" title="wikilink">President of Finland</a> the same year.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> She continued to write after retirement. When her second daughter died in 1964, Hilja Riipinen got ill and never recovered. With her condition weakened by <a href="Parkinson&#39;s_disease" title="wikilink">Parkinson's disease</a>, she was moved to the Helsinki Deaconess Institute where she died in 1966.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a></p>
