<p><strong>&lt;U+00CD&gt;mar</strong> (; died c. 873) was a <a href="Viking" class="uri" title="wikilink">Viking</a>{{#tag:ref|The definition as given by <a href="#Downham" title="wikilink">Downham</a> is used here - Vikings were &quot;people of Scandinavian culture who were active outside of Scandinavia&quot;.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>|group=&quot;nb&quot;}} leader in <a href="Ireland" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ireland</a> and <a href="Scotland" class="uri" title="wikilink">Scotland</a> in the mid-late ninth century who founded the <a href="U&lt;U+00ED&gt;_&lt;U+00CD&gt;mair" title="wikilink">U&lt;U+00ED&gt; &lt;U+00CD&gt;mair</a> dynasty, and whose descendants would go on to dominate the <a href="Irish_Sea" title="wikilink">Irish Sea</a> region for several centuries. He was the son of the king of <a href="Lochlann" class="uri" title="wikilink">Lochlann</a>, identified in the non-contemporary <em><a href="Fragmentary_Annals_of_Ireland" title="wikilink">Fragmentary Annals of Ireland</a></em> as <a href="Gofraid_of_Lochlann" title="wikilink">Gofraid</a>. The <em>Fragmentary Annals</em> name <a href="Auisle" class="uri" title="wikilink">Auisle</a> and <a href="Amla&lt;U+00ED&gt;b_Conung" title="wikilink">Amla&lt;U+00ED&gt;b Conung</a> as his brothers. Another Viking leader, <a href="Halfdan_Ragnarsson" title="wikilink">Halfdan Ragnarsson</a>, is considered by some scholars to be another brother. The <a href="Irish_Annals" title="wikilink">Irish Annals</a> title Amla&lt;U+00ED&gt;b, &lt;U+00CD&gt;mar and Auisle &quot;kings of the foreigners&quot;. Modern scholars use the title &quot;<a href="Kingdom_of_Dublin" title="wikilink">kings of Dublin</a>&quot; after the Viking settlement which formed the base of their power. Some scholars consider &lt;U+00CD&gt;mar to be identical to <a href="Ivar_the_Boneless" title="wikilink">Ivar the Boneless</a>, a Viking commander of the <a href="Great_Heathen_Army" title="wikilink">Great Heathen Army</a> named in contemporary English sources who also appears in the <a href="Icelandic_sagas" title="wikilink">Icelandic sagas</a> as a son of the legendary Viking <a href="Ragnar_Lodbrok" title="wikilink">Ragnar Lodbrok</a>.</p>
<p>During the late 850s and early 860s &lt;U+00CD&gt;mar was involved in a protracted conflict with <a href="M&lt;U+00E1&gt;el_Sechnaill_mac_Ma&lt;U+00ED&gt;l_Ruanaid" title="wikilink">M&lt;U+00E1&gt;el Sechnaill</a>, overking of the <a href="Southern_U&lt;U+00ED&gt;_N&lt;U+00E9&gt;ill" title="wikilink">Southern U&lt;U+00ED&gt; N&lt;U+00E9&gt;ill</a> and the most powerful ruler in Ireland. The cause of the conflict is uncertain, but it may have been sparked by competition for control of <a href="Munster" class="uri" title="wikilink">Munster</a> and its resources. &lt;U+00CD&gt;mar allied successively with <a href="Cerball_mac_D&lt;U+00FA&gt;nlainge" title="wikilink">Cerball</a>, King of <a href="Kings_of_Osraige" title="wikilink">Ossory</a> and <a href="&lt;U+00C1&gt;ed_Findliath" title="wikilink">&lt;U+00C1&gt;ed Findliath</a>, overking of the Northern <a href="U&lt;U+00ED&gt;_N&lt;U+00E9&gt;ill" title="wikilink">U&lt;U+00ED&gt; N&lt;U+00E9&gt;ill</a> against M&lt;U+00E1&gt;el Sechnaill. M&lt;U+00E1&gt;el Sechnaill died in 862 and his lands were split, effectively ending the conflict. Following this &lt;U+00CD&gt;mar and his kin warred with several Irish leaders in an attempt to expand their kingdom's influence. &lt;U+00CD&gt;mar disappears from the historical record in Ireland between the years 864 and 870; this is consistent with &lt;U+00CD&gt;mar being identical to Ivar the Boneless - Ivar was active in England between these two dates and he is not mentioned by English sources after 870. In 870 the annals record that <a href="Dumbarton_Rock" title="wikilink">Dumbarton Rock</a>, the chief fortress of the <a href="Kingdom_of_Strathclyde" title="wikilink">Kingdom of Strathclyde</a>, was successfully captured by &lt;U+00CD&gt;mar and Amla&lt;U+00ED&gt;b following a four month long siege.</p>
<p>&lt;U+00CD&gt;mar died in 873 and is given the title &quot;King of the Norsemen of all Ireland and Britain&quot; in contemporary annals. The <em>Fragmentary Annals</em> record that &lt;U+00CD&gt;mar's father also died that year, and it is believed that at that time their combined territory encompassed <a href="Dublin" class="uri" title="wikilink">Dublin</a>, the <a href="Isle_of_Man" title="wikilink">Isle of Man</a>, the <a href="Kingdom_of_the_Isles" title="wikilink">Western Isles</a>, <a href="Orkney" class="uri" title="wikilink">Orkney</a>, and large parts of the northern and western Scottish coast including <a href="Argyll" class="uri" title="wikilink">Argyll</a>, <a href="Caithness" class="uri" title="wikilink">Caithness</a> and <a href="Sutherland" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sutherland</a>.</p>

<p>The earliest recorded Viking raids in Ireland occurred in 795.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> Over time, these raids increased in intensity, and they overwintered in Ireland for the first time in 840–841.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> In 841 a <a href="longphort" class="uri" title="wikilink">longphort</a> was constructed at &lt;U+00C1&gt;th Cliath (Irish for <em>hurdled ford</em>), a site which would later develop into the city of Dublin.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> Longphorts were also established at other sites around Ireland, some of which developed into larger Viking settlements over time. The Viking population in Ireland was boosted in 851 with the arrival of a large group known as &quot;dark foreigners&quot; &lt;U+2013&gt; a contentious term used to refer to the newly arrived Vikings, as opposed to the &quot;fair foreigners&quot;, i.e. the Viking population which was resident in arrival prior to this influx.{{#tag:ref|<a href="Dubgaill_and_Finngaill" title="wikilink"><em>Dubgaill</em> and <em>Finngaill</em></a> respectively in Old Irish. &lt;U+00CD&gt;mar and his kin are counted among the <em>Dubgaill</em>. Historically, it was believed <em>Dubgaill</em> referred to &quot;dark&quot; Danish Vikings and <em>Finngaill</em> referred to &quot;fair&quot; Norwegian Vikings, though that interpretation has been challenged in recent years.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a>|group=&quot;nb&quot;}}<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> A kingdom in <a href="Scandinavian_Scotland" title="wikilink">Viking Scotland</a> was established by the mid ninth-century, and it exerted control over some of the Vikings in Ireland.

<p>The main historical sources for this period are the Norse <a href="saga" title="wikilink">sagas</a> and the <a href="Irish_annals" title="wikilink">Irish annals</a>. Some of the annals, such as the <em><a href="Annals_of_Ulster" title="wikilink">Annals of Ulster</a></em> are believed to be contemporary accounts, whereas the sagas were written down at dates much later than the events they describe and are considered far less reliable.

<p>The first mention of &lt;U+00CD&gt;mar in Irish annals in 857 concerns a war fought between &lt;U+00CD&gt;mar and Amla&lt;U+00ED&gt;b Conung against <a href="M&lt;U+00E1&gt;el_Sechnaill_mac_Ma&lt;U+00ED&gt;l_Ruanaid" title="wikilink">M&lt;U+00E1&gt;el Sechnaill</a>,{{#tag:ref|Some sources use the name &quot;M&lt;U+00E1&gt;el Sechnaill&quot; and some use &quot;M&lt;U+00E1&gt;el Sechlainn&quot; to refer to this person.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a>|group=&quot;nb&quot;}} overking of the <a href="Southern_U&lt;U+00ED&gt;_N&lt;U+00E9&gt;ill" title="wikilink">Southern U&lt;U+00ED&gt; N&lt;U+00E9&gt;ill</a>, and a group of Vikings sometimes known as the Norse-Irish.{{#tag:ref|&quot;Norse-Irish&quot; is a translation of the Old Irish term <em><a href="Norse-Gaels" title="wikilink">Gallgo&lt;U+00ED&gt;dil</a></em> (literally Foreigner-Gaels). The origins of this group are debated, but they are usually considered Vikings of mixed Gaelic and Scandinavian culture. They do not appear in the Irish Annals after 858, possibly because in later years mixed-ethnicity was the norm, rather than the exception.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a>|group=&quot;nb&quot;}} M&lt;U+00E1&gt;el Sechnaill was the most powerful king in Ireland at the time and his lands lay close to the Viking settlement of Dublin.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> The fighting began in the previous year: &quot;Great warfare between the heathens and Mael Sechnaill, supported by Norse-Irish&quot; is reported by the Annals of Ulster.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a></p>
<p>The fighting was focused on <a href="Munster" class="uri" title="wikilink">Munster</a>; M&lt;U+00E1&gt;el Sechnaill sought to increase his influence over the kings there.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> He took hostages from the province in 854, 856 and 858,<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> and the power of the over-kings had been weakened in 856 by a Viking raid on the royal centre at Lough Cend, when Gorm&lt;U+00E1&gt;n son of Lon&lt;U+00E1&gt;n, a relative of Munster's over-king, was killed alongside a great many others.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> This weakness likely drew the gaze of both M&lt;U+00E1&gt;el Sechnaill and the Vikings, and their competition for Munster's resources may have been the cause of the war.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> Early battles seem to have gone the way of the Vikings: &lt;U+00CD&gt;mar and Amla&lt;U+00ED&gt;b &quot;inflicted a rout on <a href="Caittil_Find" title="wikilink">Caitill the Fair</a> and his Norse-Irish in the lands of Munster&quot;.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> Although there is no certain evidence to suggest that this Caitill is the same person as the <a href="Ketill_Flatnose" title="wikilink">Ketill Flatnose</a> of later sagas, <a href="#Anderon" title="wikilink">Anderson</a> and <a href="#Crawford" title="wikilink">Crawford</a> have suggested that they are the same person.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a></p>

<h3 id="dark-and-fair-foreigners">Dark and fair foreigners</h3>
<p>In the Irish annals the terms <em>Dubgaill</em> (dark foreigners), and <em>Finngaill</em> (fair foreigners), are used to refer to rival groups of Vikings. The exact meaning of these terms is subject to debate, but historically the most popular interpretation has been that <em>Dubgaill</em> refers to <a href="Danes" class="uri" title="wikilink">Danes</a> and <em>Finngaill</em> refers to <a href="Norwegians" class="uri" title="wikilink">Norwegians</a>.<a href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a> From 917 onwards the descendants of &lt;U+00CD&gt;mar are described as leaders of the <em>Dubgaill</em>. &lt;U+00CD&gt;mar himself is not identified explicitly by the annals with the <em>Dubgaill</em>, but Albann, a figure considered by some to be &lt;U+00CD&gt;mar's brother, is called &quot;lord of the 'Dark Foreigners'&quot;.{{#tag:ref|Ivar the Boneless and the Great Heathen Army are described as &quot;Black Gentiles&quot; by the <em><a href="Annales_Cambriae" title="wikilink">Annales Cambriae</a></em>.<a href="#fn72" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref72"><sup>72</sup></a>|group=&quot;nb&quot;}}<a href="#fn73" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref73"><sup>73</sup></a></p>
<p>However, the interpretation of &quot;dark&quot; Danes and &quot;fair&quot; Norwegians has recently been challenged. <a href="#Dumville" title="wikilink">Dumville</a> has suggested that <em>Dubgaill</em> and <em>Finngaill</em> do not refer to any cultural difference but instead distinguish between &quot;old&quot; and &quot;new&quot; Vikings, with the group arriving with &lt;U+00CD&gt;mar being the &quot;new&quot; or &quot;dark&quot; Vikings, and the preexisting group being the &quot;old&quot; or &quot;fair&quot; Vikings.<a href="#fn74" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref74"><sup>74</sup></a> <a href="#Downham" title="wikilink">Downham</a> agrees and goes a step further, suggesting that <em>Dubgaill</em> was applied &quot;to followers the king of <em>Laithlind</em> (who had become a recurrent phenomenon for the chroniclers) as a convenient way of distinguishing them from the vikings who were already in Ireland&quot;.<a href="#fn75" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref75"><sup>75</sup></a></p>
