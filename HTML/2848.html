<p><strong>Lara Croft</strong> is a <a href="Character_(arts)" title="wikilink">fictional character</a> and the <a href="protagonist" class="uri" title="wikilink">protagonist</a> of <a href="Square_Enix" title="wikilink">Square Enix</a>'s (previously <a href="Eidos_Interactive" title="wikilink">Eidos Interactive</a>) <em><a href="Tomb_Raider" title="wikilink">Tomb Raider</a></em> video game series. She is presented as a beautiful, intelligent, and athletic <a href="Archaeology" title="wikilink">archaeologist</a>-adventurer who ventures into ancient, hazardous tombs and ruins around the world. Created by <a href="Toby_Gard" title="wikilink">Toby Gard</a> during his employment at British developer <a href="Core_Design" title="wikilink">Core Design</a>, the character first appeared in the 1996 video game <em><a href="Tomb_Raider_(video_game)" title="wikilink">Tomb Raider</a></em>. Other appearances include video game sequels, printed adaptations, a series of animated short films, <a href="feature_film" title="wikilink">feature films</a> (portrayed by <a href="Angelina_Jolie" title="wikilink">Angelina Jolie</a>), and various merchandise related to the series. Lara Croft has also been licensed for third-party promotion, including television and print advertisements, music-related appearances, and as a spokesmodel. Promotion of the character includes a brand of apparel and accessories, action figures, and <a href="Model_(person)" title="wikilink">model</a> portrayals.</p>
<p>Core Design first handled development of the character and the series. Inspired by pop artist <a href="Neneh_Cherry" title="wikilink">Neneh Cherry</a> and comic book character <a href="Tank_Girl" title="wikilink">Tank Girl</a>, Gard designed Lara Croft to counter stereotypical female characters. The company modified the character for subsequent titles; modifications included graphical improvements and gameplay additions such as new manoeuvres and in-game items. Poor reception for the 2003 sequel <em><a href="Tomb_Raider:_The_Angel_of_Darkness" title="wikilink">Tomb Raider: The Angel of Darkness</a></em> resulted in a switch to American developer <a href="Crystal_Dynamics" title="wikilink">Crystal Dynamics</a>. The new developer rebooted the character along with the video game series. Crystal Dynamics focused on making the character more believable, and altered her capabilities to interact with game environments as well as her proportions. Lara Croft has been voiced by four actresses throughout the video game series: Shelley Blond, Judith Gibbins, Jonell Elliott, and Keeley Hawes.</p>
<p>Critics consider Lara Croft a significant game character in popular culture. She hold two <a href="Guinness_World_Records" title="wikilink">Guinness World Records</a> and has a strong fan following. The character's debut was well-received by the video game industry, but slowly declined until the series' reboot in 2006, which was met with mixed responses. Lara Croft is also considered a sex symbol, one of the earliest in the industry to achieve wide-spread attention. The character's influence in the industry has been a point of contention among critics.</p>
<h2 id="description">Description</h2>
<p>Lara Croft is depicted as an athletic woman; she has brown eyes and hair, frequently kept in a <a href="Braid" title="wikilink">plait</a> or <a href="ponytail" class="uri" title="wikilink">ponytail</a>.

Accessories include fingerless gloves, a backpack, a utility belt with holsters on either side, and two pistols. The video game sequels introduced new outfits designed for different environments, such as underwater and cold weather. Lara Croft wears a crop top in later games, and variations on this theme, such as <a href="camouflage" class="uri" title="wikilink">camouflage</a> pants and black or light brown shirts.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a><a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a><a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> The character's backstory is described in game manuals as an <a href="English_people" title="wikilink">English</a> woman born in <a href="Wimbledon,_London" title="wikilink">Wimbledon, London</a> who is the daughter of the fictional Lord Henshingly Croft.

<p>Lara Croft has been portrayed in two <a href="feature_film" title="wikilink">feature films</a> by Academy Award-winning actress <a href="Angelina_Jolie" title="wikilink">Angelina Jolie</a>. The films depicted Lara Croft's backstory differently from games prior to <em>Legend</em>. In the games, the character's parents are alive, while in the films, her mother died in a plane crash and her father disappeared in Cambodia.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> The first, <em><a href="Lara_Croft:_Tomb_Raider" title="wikilink">Lara Croft: Tomb Raider</a></em>, was released in 2001.

Acknowledging the character's &quot;huge fan base&quot; and recognizable appearance, director <a href="Simon_West" title="wikilink">Simon West</a> sought an actress with acting ability as well as physical attributes similar to Lara Croft.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> Paramount also received input from Core Design on casting.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> Rumoured actresses included <a href="Pamela_Anderson" title="wikilink">Pamela Anderson</a>, <a href="Demi_Moore" title="wikilink">Demi Moore</a>, <a href="Jeri_Ryan" title="wikilink">Jeri Ryan</a>, and <a href="Carla_Pivonski" title="wikilink">Carla Pivonski</a>.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a></p>
<p>Jolie was eventually cast to play Lara Croft.

Jolie trained rigorously for the action scenes required for the role, occasionally sustaining injuries.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> Her training focused on practising the physical skills necessary to perform the film's stunts.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> The difficulty of the training and injuries discouraged her, but she continued working through production. Jolie also encountered difficulties when working the guns, bungy jumping, and manoeuvring with the braid.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> West did not anticipate Jolie doing her own stunts, and was surprised along with stunt coordinator Simon Crane at her performance ability.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a><a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a></p>

<p><em>Angel of Darkness</em> was received poorly, prompting Eidos&lt;U+2014&gt;fearing financial troubles from another unsuccessful game&lt;U+2014&gt;to give development duties for future titles to <a href="Crystal_Dynamics" title="wikilink">Crystal Dynamics</a>.<a href="#fn111" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref111"><sup>111</sup></a><a href="#fn112" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref112"><sup>112</sup></a> The <em><a href="Legacy_of_Kain" title="wikilink">Legacy of Kain</a></em> development team began work on a new title (<em>Tomb Raider: Legend</em>), and Toby Gard returned to work as a consultant.<a href="#fn113" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref113"><sup>113</sup></a><a href="#fn114" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref114"><sup>114</sup></a> The development team reassessed the brand value of the franchise and its protagonist.

<p>Crystal Dynamics focused on believability rather than realism to re-develop the character, posing decisions around the question, &quot;What could Lara do?&quot;, and giving her action more freedom.<a href="#fn119" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref119"><sup>119</sup></a> They updated Lara Croft's move set to make her movements appear more fluid and continuous.

<p>Crystal Dynamics carried over the changes made in <em>Legend</em> to <em>Tomb Raider: Anniversary</em>, a remake of the first game; the firm made a few minor alterations (such as character model details).<a href="#fn134" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref134"><sup>134</sup></a><a href="#fn135" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref135"><sup>135</sup></a> In remaking the original, the designers aimed to portray more emotional depth. Crystal Dynamics focused on the character's desire to achieve the end goal of the game, culminating in killing one of the antagonists. Staff used the death to portray guilt in Lara Croft afterward and illustrate that shooting a person should be a difficult choice.<a href="#fn136" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref136"><sup>136</sup></a></p>
<p><em>Tomb Raider: Underworld</em> continued the plot line established in <em>Legend</em>.<a href="#fn137" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref137"><sup>137</sup></a> Crystal Dynamics used new technology to improve the character for <a href="History_of_video_game_consoles_(seventh_generation)" title="wikilink">seventh generation consoles</a>, focusing on improving realism.

The developers enhanced Lara Croft's facial model by increasing the number of polygons, bones used in the animation skeleton, and graphical shaders in the face to add more detail and expressive capabilities. The hair was created as a real-time cloth <a href="Computer_simulation" title="wikilink">simulation</a> to further add realism to its shape and movement. The developers kept Lara Croft's hair tied back because they felt a real person would not want it flying around while performing dangerous manoeuvres.<a href="#fn142" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref142"><sup>142</sup></a> The character's body shape size was increased and breast size reduced to portray more realistic proportions.<a href="#fn143" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref143"><sup>143</sup></a></p>

Smith believed that Croft does not alienate prospective female players, representing an emancipated heroine and not simply an attractive character.<a href="#fn332" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref332"><sup>332</sup></a><a href="#fn333" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref333"><sup>333</sup></a> According to Adrian Smith, the character was also popular with younger demographics that did not view her sexually.<a href="#fn334" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref334"><sup>334</sup></a> Cohen reasoned that Lara Croft differs from other erotic characters and attractive leads, as the <em>Tomb Raider</em> game series also featured rich action, impressive graphics, and intelligent puzzles; other such characters were unsuccessful because the game content was lacking.<a href="#fn335" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref335"><sup>335</sup></a> <a href="Amy_Hennig" title="wikilink">Amy Hennig</a> of developer <a href="Naughty_Dog" title="wikilink">Naughty Dog</a> and Griffiths echoed similar statements.<a href="#fn336" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref336"><sup>336</sup></a><a href="#fn337" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref337"><sup>337</sup></a> <a href="GamesRadar" class="uri" title="wikilink">GamesRadar</a> editor Justin Toweel nonetheless commented that he couldn't imagine a <em>Tomb Raider</em> game without a sexualized female lead.<a href="#fn338" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref338"><sup>338</sup></a></p>
<p>Griffith described Lara Croft as a flawed female influence. He stated that though the character is a step in the right direction, too many women view her as a &quot;crudely realised male fantasy figure&quot;.<a href="#fn339" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref339"><sup>339</sup></a> Women in the video game industry describe the character as both a positive and negative influence. Ismini Roby of WomenGamers.com commented that Lara Croft was not a sexist influence in 1996, attributed to the lack of prominent female characters in video games at the time. She stated that the over-sexualized appearance was overlooked because the character was a &quot;breath of fresh air&quot;. However, Roby felt that though Lara Croft's proportions have become more realistic, the character's personality was diluted by the developer's actions to appeal to a male audience. LesbianGamers.com's Tracy Whitelaw called the character a dichotomy, stating that though Lara Croft is viewed as &quot;idealized&quot; with an &quot;unattainable body&quot;, the character was a great stride for the propagation of female characters as video game protagonists.<a href="#fn340" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref340"><sup>340</sup></a></p>
