<p><strong>Rush</strong> is a Canadian <a href="Rock_music" title="wikilink">rock</a> band originally formed in August 1968, in the <a href="Willowdale,_Toronto" title="wikilink">Willowdale</a> neighbourhood of <a href="Toronto" class="uri" title="wikilink">Toronto</a>, <a href="Ontario" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ontario</a>, composed of <a href="bass_guitar" title="wikilink">bassist</a>, <a href="keyboard_instrument" title="wikilink">keyboardist</a>, and <a href="singer" title="wikilink">lead vocalist</a> <a href="Geddy_Lee" title="wikilink">Geddy Lee</a>, <a href="electric_guitar" title="wikilink">guitarist</a> <a href="Alex_Lifeson" title="wikilink">Alex Lifeson</a>, and <a href="drum_kit" title="wikilink">drummer</a> and <a href="lyricist" class="uri" title="wikilink">lyricist</a> <a href="Neil_Peart" title="wikilink">Neil Peart</a>. The band and its membership went through a number of re-configurations between 1968 and 1974, achieving their current form when Peart replaced original drummer <a href="John_Rutsey" title="wikilink">John Rutsey</a> in July 1974, two weeks before the group's first U.S. tour.</p>
<p>Since the release of the band's <a href="Rush_(album)" title="wikilink">self-titled debut album</a> in March 1974, Rush has become known for the instrumental skills of its members, complex compositions, and eclectic lyrical motifs drawing heavily on <a href="science_fiction" title="wikilink">science fiction</a>, <a href="fantasy" class="uri" title="wikilink">fantasy</a>, and <a href="libertarianism" title="wikilink">libertarian</a> <a href="philosophy" class="uri" title="wikilink">philosophy</a>, as well as addressing humanitarian, social, emotional, and environmental concerns.</p>
<p>Musically, Rush's style has evolved over the years, beginning in the vein of blues-inspired <a href="Heavy_metal_music" title="wikilink">heavy metal</a> on their first albums, then encompassing <a href="hard_rock" title="wikilink">hard rock</a>, <a href="progressive_rock" title="wikilink">progressive rock</a>, and a period dominated by <a href="synthesizer" title="wikilink">synthesizers</a>. They have influenced various musical artists, including <a href="Metallica" class="uri" title="wikilink">Metallica</a>,<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a><a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> <a href="The_Smashing_Pumpkins" title="wikilink">The Smashing Pumpkins</a><a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> and <a href="Primus_(band)" title="wikilink">Primus</a>,<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> as well as <a href="progressive_metal" title="wikilink">progressive metal</a> bands such as <a href="Dream_Theater" title="wikilink">Dream Theater</a><a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> and <a href="Symphony_X" title="wikilink">Symphony X</a>.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p>Rush has won a number of <a href="Juno_Awards" title="wikilink">Juno Awards</a>, and was inducted into the <a href="Canadian_Music_Hall_of_Fame" title="wikilink">Canadian Music Hall of Fame</a> in 1994. Over the course of their careers, the individual members of Rush have been acknowledged as being some of the most proficient players on their respective instruments, with each band member winning several awards in magazine readers' polls. As a group, Rush possesses 24 <a href="music_recording_sales_certification" title="wikilink">gold records</a> and 14 platinum (3 multi-platinum) records, placing them fourth behind the <a href="Beatles" class="uri" title="wikilink">Beatles</a>, <a href="Rolling_Stones" title="wikilink">Rolling Stones</a> and <a href="Kiss_(band)" title="wikilink">Kiss</a> for the most gold and platinum albums by a band in music history.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> According to the RIAA, Rush's sales statistics also place them fourth behind <a href="The_Beatles" title="wikilink">The Beatles</a>, <a href="The_Rolling_Stones" title="wikilink">The Rolling Stones</a> and <a href="Aerosmith" class="uri" title="wikilink">Aerosmith</a> for the most consecutive gold or platinum albums by a rock band.

<h3 id="the-early-years-1968u20131976">The early years (1968&lt;U+2013&gt;1976)</h3>



<p>The original line-up formed in the neighbourhood of <a href="Willowdale,_Toronto" title="wikilink">Willowdale</a> in Toronto, Ontario, by Lifeson, front man <a href="Jeff_Jones_(musician)" title="wikilink">Jeff Jones</a>, and drummer <a href="John_Rutsey" title="wikilink">John Rutsey</a>. Within a couple weeks of forming, and before their second performance, bassist and lead vocalist Jones was replaced by Geddy Lee, a schoolmate of Lifeson. After several lineup reformations, Rush's official incarnation was formed in May 1971 consisting of Lee, Lifeson, and Rutsey. The band was managed by local <a href="Toronto" class="uri" title="wikilink">Toronto</a> resident Ray Danniels, a frequent attendee of Rush's early shows.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a><a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<p>After gaining stability in the lineup and honing their skills on the local bar/high school dance circuit, the band came to release their first single &quot;<a href="Not_Fade_Away_(song)#Rush_version" title="wikilink">Not Fade Away</a>&quot;, a cover of the <a href="Buddy_Holly" title="wikilink">Buddy Holly</a> song, in 1973. Side B contained an original composition, &quot;You Can't Fight It&quot;, credited to Rutsey and Lee. The single generated little reaction and, due to record company indifference, the band formed their own independent record label, <em>Moon Records</em>. With the aid of Danniels and the newly enlisted engineer <a href="Terry_Brown_(record_producer)" title="wikilink">Terry Brown</a>, the band released their self-titled debut album in 1974, which was considered highly derivative of Led Zeppelin.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> <em><a href="Rush_(album)" title="wikilink">Rush</a></em> had limited local popularity until the album was picked up by <a href="WMMS" class="uri" title="wikilink">WMMS</a>, a radio station in <a href="Cleveland" class="uri" title="wikilink">Cleveland</a>, <a href="Ohio" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ohio</a>. <a href="Donna_Halper" title="wikilink">Donna Halper</a>, a DJ and music director working at the station, selected &quot;Working Man&quot; for her regular play list. The song's blue collar theme resonated with hard rock fans and this new found popularity led to the album being re-released by <a href="Mercury_Records" title="wikilink">Mercury Records</a> in the U.S.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a><a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> <img src="Starman.png" title="fig:The &quot;starman&quot; logo first appeared on the back cover of the 1976 album 2112.

<p>Immediately after the release of the debut album, Rutsey resigned in July 1974 due to his affliction with <a href="diabetes" class="uri" title="wikilink">diabetes</a> and a distaste for touring. Rush held auditions and eventually selected Neil Peart as Rutsey's replacement. Peart officially joined the band on <a href="July_29" title="wikilink">July 29</a>, <a href="1974" class="uri" title="wikilink">1974</a>, two weeks before the group's first U.S. tour. They performed their first concert together, opening for <a href="Uriah_Heep_(band)" title="wikilink">Uriah Heep</a> and <a href="Manfred_Mann" title="wikilink">Manfred Mann</a> with an attendance of over 11,000 people at the Civic Arena in <a href="Pittsburgh,_Pennsylvania" title="wikilink">Pittsburgh</a>, <a href="Pennsylvania" class="uri" title="wikilink">Pennsylvania</a> on August 14. In addition to becoming the band's drummer, Peart assumed the role of principal lyricist from Lee, who had very little interest in writing, despite penning the lyrics of the band's first album,<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> contributing to only a handful of song lyrics over the rest of the band's career. Instead, Lee, along with Lifeson, focused primarily on the musical aspects of Rush. <em><a href="Fly_by_Night_(album)" title="wikilink">Fly by Night</a></em> (1975), Rush's first album after recruiting Peart, saw the inclusion of the band's first epic mini-tale &quot;By-Tor and the Snow Dog&quot;, replete with complex arrangements and multi-section format. Lyrical themes also underwent dramatic changes after the addition of Peart due to his love for fantasy and science-fiction literature.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> However, despite these many differences some of the music and songs still closely mirrored the blues style found on Rush's debut.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a><a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
<p>Following quickly on the heels of <em>Fly By Night</em>, the band released 1975's <em><a href="Caress_of_Steel" title="wikilink">Caress of Steel</a></em>, a five track hard rock album featuring two extended multi-chapter songs, &quot;The Necromancer&quot; and &quot;The Fountain of Lamneth.&quot; <em>Caress of Steel</em> was reported by some critics to be unfocused and an audacious move for the band due to the placement of two protracted numbers back-to-back, as well as a heavier reliance on atmospherics and story-telling, a large deviation from <em>Fly by Night</em>.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> Intended to be the band's first &quot;break-through&quot; album, <em>Caress of Steel</em> sold below expectations and the promotional tour consisted of small venues which led to the moniker the &quot;Down the Tubes Tour.&quot;<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> In light of these events, Rush's record label pressured them into molding their next album in a more commercially friendly and accessible fashion. However, the band ignored the requests and developed their next album, <em><a href="2112_(album)" title="wikilink">2112</a></em>. It was the band's first taste of commercial success and their first platinum album in Canada.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> The supporting tour for the album culminated in a three night stand at <a href="Massey_Hall" title="wikilink">Massey Hall</a> in Toronto, which the band recorded for the release of their first live album titled <em><a href="All_the_World&#39;s_a_Stage_(album)" title="wikilink">All the World's a Stage</a></em>. <a href="Allmusic_Guide" title="wikilink">Allmusic Guide</a> critic Greg Prato summarily reminds listeners and fans of how the album demarcates the boundary between the band's early years and the next era of their music.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a><a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="the-progressive-rock-era-1977u20131981">The progressive rock era (1977&lt;U+2013&gt;1981)</h3>
<p>After <em>2112</em>, Rush retreated to the United Kingdom to record 1977's <em><a href="A_Farewell_to_Kings" title="wikilink">A Farewell to Kings</a></em> and 1978's <em><a href="Hemispheres_(Rush_album)" title="wikilink">Hemispheres</a></em> at <a href="Rockfield_Studios" title="wikilink">Rockfield Studios</a> in <a href="Wales" class="uri" title="wikilink">Wales</a>. These albums saw the band members expanding their use of progressive elements in their music. Trademarks such as increased synthesizer usage, extended-length <a href="concept_album" title="wikilink">concept songs</a>, and highly dynamic playing featuring complex <a href="time_signature" title="wikilink">time signature</a> changes became a staple of Rush's compositions. To achieve a broader, more progressive palette of sound, Alex Lifeson began to experiment with classical and twelve-string guitars, and Geddy Lee added bass-pedal synthesizers and Minimoog. Likewise, Peart's percussion became diversified in the form of <a href="triangle_(instrument)" title="wikilink">triangles</a>, <a href="glockenspiel" class="uri" title="wikilink">glockenspiel</a>, wood blocks, <a href="cowbell_(instrument)" title="wikilink">cowbells</a>, <a href="timpani" class="uri" title="wikilink">timpani</a>, <a href="gong" class="uri" title="wikilink">gong</a> and <a href="tubular_bell" title="wikilink">chimes</a>. Beyond instrument additions, the band kept in stride with the progressive rock movement by continuing to compose long, conceptual songs with science fiction and fantasy overtones. However, as the new decade approached, Rush gradually began to dispose of their older styles of music in favor of shorter, and sometimes softer, arrangements. The lyrics up to this point (most of them written by Peart) were heavily influenced by classical poetry, fantasy literature, science fiction, and the writings of novelist <a href="Ayn_Rand" title="wikilink">Ayn Rand</a>, as exhibited most prominently by their 1975 song &quot;Anthem&quot; from <em>Fly By Night</em> and a specifically acknowledged derivation in 1976's <em>2112</em>.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a></p>
<p><em><a href="Permanent_Waves" title="wikilink">Permanent Waves</a></em> (1980) shifted Rush's style of music dramatically via the introduction of <a href="reggae" class="uri" title="wikilink">reggae</a> and <a href="New_Wave_(music)" title="wikilink">new wave</a>.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> Although a hard rock style was still evident, more and more <a href="synthesizer" title="wikilink">synthesizers</a> were introduced. Moreover, due to the limited airplay Rush's previous extended-length songs received, <em>Permanent Waves</em> included shorter, more radio-friendly songs such as &quot;<a href="The_Spirit_of_Radio" title="wikilink">The Spirit of Radio</a>&quot; and &quot;<a href="Freewill_(song)" title="wikilink">Freewill</a>&quot;, two songs which helped <em>Permanent Waves</em> become Rush's first U.S. Top 5 album; both songs continue to make appearances on classic rock radio stations in Canada and the United States to this day.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> Meanwhile, Peart's lyrics shifted toward an expository tone with subject matter that dwelled less on fantastical or <a href="allegory" title="wikilink">allegorical</a> story-telling and more heavily on cerebral topics that explored humanistic, social, emotional and <a href="metaphysics" title="wikilink">metaphysical</a> elements.    Rush's popularity reached its pinnacle with the release of <em><a href="Moving_Pictures_(album)" title="wikilink">Moving Pictures</a></em> in 1981. <em>Moving Pictures</em> essentially continued where <em>Permanent Waves</em> left off, extending the trend of highly accessible and commercially friendly pop-progressive rock that helped thrust them into the spotlight. The lead track, &quot;<a href="Tom_Sawyer_(song)" title="wikilink">Tom Sawyer</a>&quot;, is probably the band's best-known song<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> with &quot;Limelight&quot; also receiving satisfactory responses from listeners and radio stations. <em>Moving Pictures</em> was Rush's last album to feature an extended song, the ten-and-a-half-minute &quot;The Camera Eye&quot;. The song also contained the band's heaviest usage of synthesizers up to that point, hinting that Rush's music was shifting direction once more. <em>Moving Pictures</em> reached #3 on the <em><a href="Billboard_200" title="wikilink">Billboard 200</a></em> album chart and has been certified quadruple platinum by the <a href="Recording_Industry_Association_of_America" title="wikilink">Recording Industry Association of America</a>.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a></p>
<p>Following the success of <em>Moving Pictures</em> and the completion of another four studio albums, Rush released their second live recording, <em><a href="Exit...Stage_Left" title="wikilink">Exit...Stage Left</a></em>, in 1981. The album delineates the apex of Rush's progressive period by featuring live material from the band's <em>Permanent Waves</em> and <em>Moving Pictures</em> tours. As with their first live release, <em>Exit...Stage Left</em> identified the margin of a new chapter of Rush's sound. The band underwent another radical stylistic transmutation with the release of <em><a href="Signals_(album)" title="wikilink">Signals</a></em> in 1982.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a></p>

</figure>
<p>While Lee's synthesizers had been featured instruments ever since the late 70s, keyboards were suddenly shifted from the contrapuntal background to the melodic front-lines<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a><a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> as evidenced by songs such as &quot;<a href="Countdown_(rush_song)" title="wikilink">Countdown</a>&quot; and the lead-off track &quot;<a href="Subdivisions_(song)" title="wikilink">Subdivisions</a>&quot;. Both feature prominent lead synthesizer lines with minimalistic guitar chords and solos. Other previously unused instrument additions were seen in the song &quot;Losing It,&quot; featuring collaborator <a href="Ben_Mink" title="wikilink">Ben Mink</a> on <a href="electric_violin" title="wikilink">electric violin</a>.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a>    <em>Signals</em> also represented a drastic stylistic transformation apart from instrumental changes. The album contained Rush's only U.S. top-40 pop hit, &quot;New World Man&quot;,<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> while other more experimental songs such as &quot;Digital Man&quot;, &quot;The Weapon&quot;, and &quot;Chemistry&quot; expanded the band's use of <a href="ska" class="uri" title="wikilink">ska</a>, reggae, and <a href="funk" class="uri" title="wikilink">funk</a>.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> Although the band members consciously decided to move in this overall direction, they felt dissatisfied with long-time producer Terry Brown's studio treatment of <em>Signals</em> and parted ways with him in 1983. These diverse styles would come into further play on their next studio album.</p>

<img src="DM_Simmons_SDS5.jpg" title="Neil Peart began incorporating Simmons Electronic Drums beginning with 1984&#39;s Grace Under Pressure" alt="Neil Peart began incorporating Simmons Electronic Drums beginning with 1984&#39;s Grace Under Pressure" /><figcaption>Neil Peart began incorporating <a href="Simmons_Drums" title="wikilink">Simmons Electronic Drums</a> beginning with 1984's <em>Grace Under Pressure</em></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The style and production of <em>Signals</em> were augmented and taken to new heights on 1984's <em><a href="Grace_Under_Pressure_(Rush_album)" title="wikilink">Grace Under Pressure</a></em>. It was Peart who named the album, as he borrowed the words of <a href="Ernest_Hemingway" title="wikilink">Ernest Hemingway</a> to describe what the band had to go through after making the decision to leave Terry Brown. Producer <a href="Steve_Lillywhite" title="wikilink">Steve Lillywhite</a>, who gleaned fame with successful productions of <a href="Simple_Minds" title="wikilink">Simple Minds</a> and <a href="U2" class="uri" title="wikilink">U2</a>, was enlisted to produce <em>Grace Under Pressure</em>. However, he backed out at the last moment, much to the ire of Lee, Lifeson and Peart. Lee said &quot;Steve Lillywhite is really not a man of his word....after agreeing to do our record, he got an offer from Simple Minds, changed his mind, blew us off,..so it put us in a horrible position.&quot; Eventually Rush hired Peter Henderson to co-produce and engineer the album in his stead.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a></p>
<p>Musically, although Lee's use of sequencers and synthesizers remained the band's cornerstone, his focus on new technology was complemented by Peart's adaptation of Simmons electronic drums and percussion. Lifeson's contributions on the album were decidedly enhanced to act as an overreaction to the minimalistic role he played on <em>Signals</em>.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> Still, many of his trademark guitar textures remained intact in the form of open reggae chords and funk and new-wave rhythms; &quot;Distant Early Warning&quot;, &quot;Red Lenses&quot;, &quot;<a href="Red_Sector_A" title="wikilink">Red Sector A</a>&quot; and &quot;The Enemy Within&quot; serve as prime examples.</p>
<p>With new producer <a href="Peter_Collins_(record_producer)" title="wikilink">Peter Collins</a>, the band released 1985's <em><a href="Power_Windows_(album)" title="wikilink">Power Windows</a></em> and 1987's <em><a href="Hold_Your_Fire" title="wikilink">Hold Your Fire</a></em>. The music on these two albums gives far more emphasis and prominence to Lee's multi-layered synthesizer work. While fans and critics took notice of Lifeson's diminished guitar work, his presence was still palpable on &quot;The Big Money&quot;, (the album's modest-charting single) with spotlights on &quot;Grand Designs&quot;, &quot;Middletown Dreams&quot; and &quot;Marathon.&quot; Lifeson, like many guitarists in the late 1980s, experimented with processors that reduced his instrument to echoey chord bursts and razor-thin leads. <em>Hold Your Fire</em> represents both a modest extension of the guitar stylings found on <em>Power Windows</em>, and, according to Allmusic critic Eduardo Rivadavia, the culmination of this era of Rush.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> Whereas the previous five Rush albums sold platinum or better, <em>Hold Your Fire</em> only went gold in November 1987, although it managed to peak at number 13 on the <em>Billboard 200</em>.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a></p>
<p>A third live album and video, <em><a href="A_Show_of_Hands" title="wikilink">A Show of Hands</a></em> (1989), was also released by Mercury following the ''Power Windows '' and <em>Hold Your Fire</em> tours, demonstrating the aspects of Rush in the 80s. <em>A Show of Hands</em> met with strong fan approval, but <em><a href="Rolling_Stone" title="wikilink">Rolling Stone</a></em> critic Michael Azerrad dismissed it as &quot;musical muscle&quot; with 1.5 stars, claiming Rush fans viewed their favourite power trio as &quot;the holy trinity&quot;.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> Nevertheless, <em>A Show of Hands</em> managed to surpass the gold album mark, reaching number 21 on the <em>Billboard 200</em>.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> At this point, the group decided to change record labels from Mercury to <a href="Atlantic_Records" title="wikilink">Atlantic</a>. After Rush's departure in 1989, <em>Mercury</em> released a double platinum two-volume compilation of their Rush catalogue, <em><a href="Chronicles_(1990_album)" title="wikilink">Chronicles</a></em> (1990).<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="returning-to-their-roots-1989u20131997">Returning to their roots (1989&lt;U+2013&gt;1997)</h3>



<p>Rush started to deviate from their 1980s style with the albums <em><a href="Presto_(album)" title="wikilink">Presto</a></em> and <em><a href="Roll_the_Bones" title="wikilink">Roll the Bones</a></em>. Produced by record engineer and musician <a href="Rupert_Hine" title="wikilink">Rupert Hine</a>, these two albums saw Rush shedding much of their keyboard-saturated sound. Beginning with 1989's <em>Presto</em>, the band opted for arrangements that were notably more guitar-centric than the previous two studio albums. Although synthesizers were still used in many songs, the instrument was no longer featured as the centerpiece of Rush's compositions. Continuing this trend, 1991's <em>Roll the Bones</em> extended the use of the standard three-instrument approach with even less focus on synthesizers than its predecessor. While musically these albums do not deviate significantly from a general pop-rock sound, Rush stuck to their approach of incorporating traces of exotic musical styles. &quot;Roll the Bones&quot;, for instance, exhibits funk and <a href="hip_hop_music" title="wikilink">hip hop</a> elements, and the instrumental track &quot;<a href="Rush_instrumentals#Where&#39;s_My_Thing?" title="wikilink">Where's My Thing?</a>&quot; features several jazz components.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> This return to three-piece instrumentation helped pave the way for future albums in the mid-90s, which would adopt a more straightforward rock formula.</p>
<p>The transition from synthesizers to more guitar-oriented and organic instrumentation continued with the 1993 album <em><a href="Counterparts_(album)" title="wikilink">Counterparts</a></em><a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> and its follow-up, 1996's <em><a href="Test_for_Echo" title="wikilink">Test for Echo</a></em>, again both produced in collaboration with Peter Collins. Musically, <em>Counterparts</em><a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> and <em>Test For Echo</em> are two of Rush's most guitar-driven albums. Although the music in general did not meet the criteria for &quot;progressive rock&quot;, some songs adopted a dynamic format.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a> For instance, &quot;Time and Motion&quot; possesses multiple time signature changes and organ usage, while the instrumental track &quot;<a href="Rush_instrumentals#Limbo" title="wikilink">Limbo</a>&quot;, consists of several complex musical passages repeated throughout. Musically, <em>Test For Echo</em> still retained much of the hard rock/alternative style already charted on the previous record. Lifeson and Lee's playing remained more or less unchanged; however, a distinct modification in technique became apparent in Peart's playing due to <a href="jazz" class="uri" title="wikilink">jazz</a> and <a href="swing_(genre)" title="wikilink">swing</a> training under the tutelage of jazz instructor <a href="Freddie_Gruber" title="wikilink">Freddie Gruber</a> during the interim between <em>Counterparts</em> and <em>Test For Echo</em>.<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> In October 1996, in support of <em>Test For Echo</em>, the band embarked on a North American <a href="Test_For_Echo_Tour" title="wikilink">tour</a>, the band's first without an opening act and dubbed &quot;An Evening with Rush.&quot; The tour was broken up into two segments spanning October through December, 1996 and May through July, 1997 with the band taking a respite between legs.</p>

<p>After wrapping up the tour promoting <em>Test for Echo</em> in 1997, the band entered a five-year hiatus mainly due to personal tragedies in Peart's life. Peart's daughter Selena died in an automobile accident in August 1997, followed by his wife Jacqueline's death from <a href="cancer" class="uri" title="wikilink">cancer</a> in June 1998. Peart took a hiatus to mourn and reflect, during which time he traveled extensively throughout North America on his BMW motorcycle, covering 88,000 km (55,000 miles). At some point in his journey, Peart decided to return to the band. Peart wrote <em><a href="Ghost_Rider:_Travels_on_the_Healing_Road" title="wikilink">Ghost Rider: Travels on the Healing Road</a></em> as a chronicle of his geographical and emotional journey. In this book he writes of how he had told his bandmates at Selena's funeral, &quot;consider me retired.&quot;<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a> On <a href="November_10" title="wikilink">November 10</a>, <a href="1998" class="uri" title="wikilink">1998</a> a triple CD live album entitled <em><a href="Different_Stages_(Rush_album)" title="wikilink">Different Stages</a></em> was released, dedicated to the memory of Selena and Jacqueline. Mixed by producer <a href="Paul_Northfield" title="wikilink">Paul Northfield</a> and engineered by Terry Brown, it contained three discs packed with recorded performances from the band's <em><a href="Counterparts_Tour" title="wikilink">Counterparts</a></em>, <em><a href="Test_For_Echo_Tour" title="wikilink">Test For Echo</a></em>, and <em>A Farewell to Kings</em> tours, marking the fourth officially released live album by the band.    After a time to grieve and reassemble the pieces of his life, and while visiting long-time Rush photographer Andrew MacNaughtan in Los Angeles, Peart was introduced to his future wife, photographer <a href="Carrie_Nuttall" title="wikilink">Carrie Nuttall</a>. Peart married Nuttall on <a href="September_9" title="wikilink">September 9</a>, <a href="2000" class="uri" title="wikilink">2000</a>. In early 2001 he announced to his band mates that he was ready to once again enter the studio and get back into the business of making music. With the help of producer <a href="Paul_Northfield" title="wikilink">Paul Northfield</a> the band returned in May 2002 with <em><a href="Vapor_Trails" title="wikilink">Vapor Trails</a></em>, written and recorded in Toronto. To herald the band's comeback, the single and lead track from the album, &quot;<a href="One_Little_Victory" title="wikilink">One Little Victory</a>&quot; was designed to grab the attention of listeners due to its rapid guitar and drum tempos.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a> <em>Vapor Trails</em> marked the first studio recording not to include a single synthesizer, organ or keyboard part since the early 1970s. While the album is almost completely guitar-driven, it is mostly devoid of any conventional sounding guitar solos, a conscious decision made by Lifeson during the writing process. According to the band, the entire developmental process for <em>Vapor Trails</em> was extremely taxing and took approximately 14 months to finish, by far the longest the band had ever spent writing and recording a studio album.<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a> The album debuted to moderate praise and was supported by the band's first <a href="Vapor_Trails_Tour" title="wikilink">tour</a> in six years, including first-ever <a href="concert" title="wikilink">concerts</a> in <a href="Mexico_City" title="wikilink">Mexico City</a> and <a href="Brazil" class="uri" title="wikilink">Brazil</a>, where they played to some of the largest crowds of their career.</p>

<p>During promotional interviews for the <em>R30 Live In Frankfurt</em> DVD, the band revealed their intention to begin writing new material in early 2006. While in Toronto, Lifeson and Lee began the songwriting process in January 2006. During this time, Peart simultaneously assumed his role of lyric writing while residing in Southern California. The following September, Rush chose to hire American producer <a href="Nick_Raskulinecz" title="wikilink">Nick Raskulinecz</a> to co-produce the album. The band officially entered Allaire Studios, in Shokan, New York in November 2006 in order to record the bulk of the material. Taking the band five weeks, the sessions ended in December. On <a href="February_14" title="wikilink">February 14</a>, <a href="2007" class="uri" title="wikilink">2007</a>, an announcement was made on the official Rush web site that the title of the new album would be <em>Snakes &amp; Arrows</em>. The first single, entitled &quot;<a href="Far_Cry_(song)" title="wikilink">Far Cry</a>,&quot; was released to North American radio stations on <a href="March_12" title="wikilink">March 12</a>, <a href="2007" class="uri" title="wikilink">2007</a> and reached #2 on the Mediabase Mainstream and Radio and Records Charts.<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a></p>
<p>The Rush website, newly redesigned on March 12 to support the new album, also announced that the band would embark on a tour to begin in the summer. <em><a href="Snakes_&amp;_Arrows" title="wikilink">Snakes &amp; Arrows</a></em> was released 1 May 2007 in North America, where it debuted at #3 in the <em>Billboard 200</em> with approximately 93,000 units sold in its first week.<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a> To coincide with the Atlantic ocean hurricane season, &quot;<a href="Spindrift_(song)" title="wikilink">Spindrift</a>&quot; was released as the official second radio single on <a href="June_1" title="wikilink">June 1</a>, <a href="2007" class="uri" title="wikilink">2007</a>, whereas &quot;<a href="The_Larger_Bowl_(A_Pantoum)" title="wikilink">The Larger Bowl (A Pantoum)</a>&quot; saw single status on <a href="June_25" title="wikilink">June 25</a>, <a href="2007" class="uri" title="wikilink">2007</a>. &quot;The Larger Bowl&quot; positioned within the top 20 of the Mainstream Rock and Media Base Mainstream charts, however, &quot;Spindrift&quot; failed to appear on any commercial chart.<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a> The planned intercontinental <a href="Snakes_And_Arrows_Tour" title="wikilink">tour</a> in support of <em>Snakes &amp; Arrows</em> began on <a href="June_13" title="wikilink">June 13</a>, <a href="2007" class="uri" title="wikilink">2007</a> in Atlanta, Georgia, coming to a close on <a href="October_29" title="wikilink">October 29</a>, <a href="2007" class="uri" title="wikilink">2007</a> at <a href="Hartwall_Arena" title="wikilink">Hartwall Arena</a> in <a href="Helsinki" class="uri" title="wikilink">Helsinki</a>, <a href="Finland" class="uri" title="wikilink">Finland</a>.<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a></p>

<h2 id="musical-style-and-influences">Musical style and influences</h2>
<p>Rush's musical style has changed substantially over the years. Their debut album is strongly influenced by British-Blues rock: an amalgam of sounds and styles from such rock bands as <a href="Cream_(band)" title="wikilink">Cream</a>, <a href="Led_Zeppelin" title="wikilink">Led Zeppelin</a>, and <a href="Deep_Purple" title="wikilink">Deep Purple</a>. Over the first few albums their style remained essentially hard rock, with heavy influences from <a href="The_Who" title="wikilink">The Who</a><a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a> and Led Zeppelin,<a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a> but also became increasingly influenced by the British progressive rock movement.<a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a> In the tradition of progressive rock, Rush wrote protracted songs with irregular and multiple <a href="time_signatures" title="wikilink">time signatures</a> combined with fantasy/science fiction-inspired lyrics; however, they did not soften their sound. This fusion of hard and progressive rock continued until the end of the 1970s. In the 1980s, however, Rush successfully merged their sound with the trends of this period, experimenting with New Wave, reggae and <a href="pop_rock" title="wikilink">pop rock</a>.<a href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a> This period included the band's most extensive use of instruments such as synthesizers, <a href="music_sequencer" title="wikilink">sequencers</a> and electronic percussion. It is largely agreed that the culmination of this era of Rush was in 1987 after the release of <em>Hold Your Fire</em>. With the approach of the early '90s and Rush's character sound still intact, the band transformed their style once again to harmonize with the <a href="alternative_rock" title="wikilink">alternative rock</a> movement.<a href="#fn67" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a> The new millennium has seen them return to a more rock and roll roots sound, albeit with modern production.<a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a></p>

<h2 id="reputation">Reputation</h2>
<p>More than 30 years of activity has provided Rush with the opportunity for musical diversity across their discography. As with many bands known for experimentation, such changes have inevitably resulted in dissent among critics and fans. The bulk of the band's music has always included synthetic instruments in some form or another, and this is a great source of contention in the Rush camp, especially the band's heavy reliance on synthesizers and keyboards during the 1980s, particularly on albums <em>Grace Under Pressure</em>, <em>Power Windows</em>, and <em>Hold Your Fire</em>.<a href="#fn69" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref69"><sup>69</sup></a><a href="#fn70" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a> Still, most fans saw this as nothing less than artistic growth and support for the band remained unwavering through each transitional phase.</p>
<p>The members of Rush have themselves noted that people &quot;either love Rush or hate Rush&quot;, resulting in strong detractors and an intensely loyal fan base. In July 2008, <a href="Rolling_Stone_magazine" title="wikilink">Rolling Stone magazine</a> commented that &quot;Rush fans are the Trekkies/trekkers of rock&quot;.<a href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a> The band has not been nominated for entry into the <a href="Rock_and_Roll_Hall_of_Fame" title="wikilink">American Rock and Roll Hall of Fame</a> since their year of eligibility in 1998. The Hall's refusal to induct Rush may be a consequence of the band's insistence on remaining outside the mainstream of rock when it comes to self-promotion, in favour of maintaining a high degree of independence.<a href="#fn72" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref72"><sup>72</sup></a> Supporters cite the band's accomplishments including longevity, proficiency, and influence, as well as commercial sales figures and RIAA certifications. However, Lifeson has expressed his indifference toward the perceived slight saying &quot;I couldn't care less, look who's up for induction, it's a joke&quot;.<a href="#fn73" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref73"><sup>73</sup></a> Rush has gained a degree of recognition in popular culture despite any official recognition from the Hall.<a href="#fn74" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref74"><sup>74</sup></a></p>
<p>As a band, Rush has been nominated for and received various awards throughout its career. Likewise, the individual members have received coverage in various modern music magazines with specific technocratic recognition for instrumental ability.</p>

<p>Geddy Lee's high-register vocal style has always been a signature of the band — and sometimes a focal point for criticism, especially during the early years of Rush's career when Lee's vocals were high-pitched, with a strong likeness to other singers like <a href="Robert_Plant" title="wikilink">Robert Plant</a> of <a href="Led_Zeppelin" title="wikilink">Led Zeppelin</a>. Although his voice has softened over the years, it is often described as a &quot;wail&quot;.<a href="#fn75" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref75"><sup>75</sup></a><a href="#fn76" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref76"><sup>76</sup></a> His instrumental abilities, on the other hand, are rarely criticized. An award-winning musician, Lee's style, technique, and ability on the bass guitar have proven influential in the rock and heavy metal genres, inspiring such players as <a href="Steve_Harris_(musician)" title="wikilink">Steve Harris</a> of <a href="Iron_Maiden" title="wikilink">Iron Maiden</a>,<a href="#fn77" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref77"><sup>77</sup></a> <a href="John_Myung" title="wikilink">John Myung</a> of <a href="Dream_Theater" title="wikilink">Dream Theater</a>,<a href="#fn78" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref78"><sup>78</sup></a> <a href="Les_Claypool" title="wikilink">Les Claypool</a> of Primus<a href="#fn79" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref79"><sup>79</sup></a> and <a href="Cliff_Burton" title="wikilink">Cliff Burton</a> of Metallica<a href="#fn80" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref80"><sup>80</sup></a> among others. Lee is notable for his ability to operate various pieces of instrumentation simultaneously. This is most evident during live shows when Lee must play bass, supply lead vocals, manipulate keyboards, and trigger foot pedals during the course of a performance, as in the song &quot;<a href="Tom_Sawyer_(song)" title="wikilink">Tom Sawyer</a>&quot;.<a href="#fn81" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref81"><sup>81</sup></a> Because of this, he is required to remain in one place during songs containing complex instrumentation. Lifeson and Peart are, to a lesser extent, responsible for similar actions during live shows.</p>

<p>Instrumentally, Lifeson is regarded as a guitarist whose strengths and notability rely primarily on signature riffing, electronic effects and processing, unorthodox chord structures, and a copious arsenal of equipment used over the years.<a href="#fn82" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref82"><sup>82</sup></a><a href="#fn83" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref83"><sup>83</sup></a><a href="#fn84" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref84"><sup>84</sup></a> Despite his esteem, however, Lifeson is often regarded as being overshadowed by his bandmates due to Lee's on-stage multi-instrumental dexterity and Peart's status as a drummer.<a href="#fn85" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref85"><sup>85</sup></a></p>
<p>During his adolescent years, he was influenced primarily by <a href="Jimi_Hendrix" title="wikilink">Jimi Hendrix</a>, <a href="Pete_Townshend" title="wikilink">Pete Townshend</a>, <a href="Jeff_Beck" title="wikilink">Jeff Beck</a>, <a href="Eric_Clapton" title="wikilink">Eric Clapton</a> and <a href="Jimmy_Page" title="wikilink">Jimmy Page</a>.<a href="#fn86" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref86"><sup>86</sup></a> For versatility, Lifeson was known to incorporate touches of Spanish and classical music into Rush's guitar-driven sound during the 1970s. Taking a backseat to Lee's keyboards in the 1980s, Lifeson's guitar returned to the forefront in the 1990s, and especially on 2002's <em>Vapor Trails</em>. During live performances, he is still responsible for cuing various guitar effects, the use of bass-pedal synthesizers and backing vocals.</p>

<h4 id="lyrics">Lyrics</h4>
<p>Peart also serves as Rush's primary lyricist, attracting much attention over the years due to his eclectic style. Known for penning concept suites and songs inspired by literature, music fan opinions of his writing have varied greatly, running the gamut from cerebral and insightful to pretentious and preachy. During the band's early years, Peart's lyrics were largely fantasy/science fiction-focused,<a href="#fn90" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref90"><sup>90</sup></a> though since 1980 he has focused more on social, emotional, and humanitarian issues.

<p>Over the course of their career, Rush has come to release 24 gold records and 14 platinum records (3 of which have gone multiplatinum),<a href="#fn92" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref92"><sup>92</sup></a> placing them within the top 4 for the most consecutive gold albums by a rock band.<a href="#fn93" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref93"><sup>93</sup></a> Rush ranks 78th in U.S. album sales according to the RIAA with sales of 25 million units.<a href="#fn94" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref94"><sup>94</sup></a> Total worldwide sales approximate 40 million units.<a href="#fn95" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref95"><sup>95</sup></a><a href="#fn96" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref96"><sup>96</sup></a><a href="#fn97" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref97"><sup>97</sup></a><a href="#fn98" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref98"><sup>98</sup></a></p>
<p>Despite having completely dropped out of the public eye for five years after the gold-selling <em>Test for Echo</em> (which peaked at number 5 on the <em>Billboard 200</em>) and the band being relegated almost solely to classic rock stations in the U.S., <em>Vapor Trails</em> reached #6 on the <em>Billboard 200</em> chart in its first week of release in 2002 with 108,000 albums sold. It has sold approximately 343,000 units to date. The subsequent <em>Vapor Trails</em> tour grossed over $24 million and included the largest audience ever to see a headlining Rush show — 60,000 fans in <a href="S&lt;U+00E3&gt;o_Paulo" title="wikilink">S&lt;U+00E3&gt;o Paulo</a>, <a href="Brazil" class="uri" title="wikilink">Brazil</a>. Nevertheless, <em>Vapor Trails</em> remains their first album not to achieve at least gold status.</p>
<p>However, Rush's triple CD live album, 2003's <em>Rush in Rio</em>, was certified gold by the RIAA, marking the fourth decade in which a Rush album had been released and certified at least gold. Moreover, in 2004 <em>Feedback</em> cracked the top 20 on the <em>Billboard</em> 200 chart and received radio airplay. The band's most recent album, <em><a href="Snakes_&amp;_Arrows" title="wikilink">Snakes &amp; Arrows</a></em>, debuted at #3 (just one position shy of Rush's highest peaking album, 1993's <em>Counterparts</em>, which debuted at #2) on the <em>Billboard 200</em> selling approximately 93,000 copies in its first week of release.<a href="#fn99" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref99"><sup>99</sup></a> This marks the 13th studio album to appear in the Top 20 and the band's 27th album to appear on the chart regardless of position over the course of their career. The album also debuted at #1 on the Billboard's Top Rock Albums chart, as well as peaking at #1 on the Top Internet Albums chart when the album was released on the MVI format a month later.<a href="#fn100" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref100"><sup>100</sup></a> Still, <em>Snakes &amp; Arrows</em> has yet to accumulate sales that approach or eclipse <em>Vapor Trails</em> or <em>Rush in Rio</em>.</p>
<p>The two consecutive tours in support of <em>Snakes &amp; Arrows</em> in 2007 and 2008 accrued $21 million and $18.3 million, respectively, earning Rush the number 6 and 8 spots among the top ten summer rock concerts.<a href="#fn101" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref101"><sup>101</sup></a><a href="#fn102" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref102"><sup>102</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="live-performances">Live performances</h2>
<p>The members of Rush share a strong work ethic, desiring to accurately recreate songs from their albums when playing live performances. To achieve this goal, beginning in the late 1980s, Rush has included in their concert equipment a capacious rack of <a href="sampler_(musical_instrument)" title="wikilink">digital samplers</a> which the band members use, in real-time, to recreate the sounds of non-traditional instruments, accompaniments, vocal harmonies, and other sound &quot;events&quot; that are familiarly heard on the studio versions of the songs.</p>
<p>In live performances, the band members share duties throughout most songs, with each member triggering certain sounds with his available limbs, while playing his primary instrument(s). Each band member has one or more <a href="MIDI_controller" title="wikilink">MIDI controllers</a> that enables him to use his free hands or feet to trigger sounds that have been loaded into the samplers for a particular song.<a href="#fn103" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref103"><sup>103</sup></a> It is with this technology that the group is able to present their arrangements in a live setting with the level of complexity and fidelity that fans have come to expect, and without the need to resort to the use of <a href="backing_tracks" title="wikilink">backing tracks</a> or employing an additional band member.<a href="#fn104" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref104"><sup>104</sup></a></p>
<p>The band members' coordinated use of foot-pedal keyboards and other electronic triggers to &quot;play&quot; sampled instruments and audio events is subtly visible in their live performances, especially so on <a href="R30:_30th_Anniversary_World_Tour" title="wikilink">R30: 30th Anniversary World Tour</a>, their 2005 concert <a href="DVD" class="uri" title="wikilink">DVD</a>.</p>
<p>A staple of Rush's concerts is a Peart drum solo. Peart's drum solos include a basic framework of routines connected by sections of improvisation, making each performance unique. Each successive tour sees the solo more advanced, with some routines dropped in favor of newer, more complex ones. Since the mid-1980s, Peart has used <a href="Musical_Instrument_Digital_Interface" title="wikilink">MIDI</a> <a href="Sound_module" title="wikilink">trigger pads</a> to trigger sounds sampled from various pieces of acoustic percussion that would otherwise consume far too much stage area, such as a <a href="marimba" class="uri" title="wikilink">marimba</a>, <a href="harp" class="uri" title="wikilink">harp</a>, <a href="temple_blocks" title="wikilink">temple blocks</a>, <a href="Triangle_(instrument)" title="wikilink">triangles</a>, glockenspiel, <a href="Bell_(instrument)" title="wikilink">orchestra bells</a>, tubular bells, and <a href="vibraslap" class="uri" title="wikilink">vibraslap</a> as well as other, more esoteric percussion.</p>
<h2 id="philanthropy">Philanthropy</h2>
<p>Rush actively participates in philanthropic causes. The band was one of a number of hometown favorites to play <a href="Molson_Canadian_Rocks_for_Toronto" title="wikilink">Molson Canadian Rocks for Toronto</a>, also dubbed SARStock, at <a href="Downsview_Park" title="wikilink">Downsview Park</a> in <a href="Toronto" class="uri" title="wikilink">Toronto</a> on <a href="July_30" title="wikilink">July 30</a>, <a href="2003" class="uri" title="wikilink">2003</a>, with an attendance of over half a million people. The concert was intended to benefit the Canadian economy after the <a href="SARS" class="uri" title="wikilink">SARS</a> outbreaks earlier in the year. The band has also sustained an interest in promoting human rights. They donated $100,000 to the <a href="Canadian_Museum_for_Human_Rights" title="wikilink">Canadian Museum for Human Rights</a> after a concert they held in Winnipeg on 24 May 2008.<a href="#fn105" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref105"><sup>105</sup></a> Rush continues to sell t-shirts and donate the proceeds to the museum.<a href="#fn106" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref106"><sup>106</sup></a></p>
<p>The individual members of Rush have also been a part of philanthropic causes. <a href="Hughes_&amp;_Kettner" title="wikilink">Hughes &amp; Kettner</a> zenTeras and TriAmps have been endorsed and used by Lifeson for many years. A custom signature amplifier was engineered by Lifeson and released in April 2005 with the stipulation that <a href="UNICEF" class="uri" title="wikilink">UNICEF</a> will receive a donation in the amount of $50 for every Alex Lifeson Signature TriAmp sold.<a href="#fn107" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref107"><sup>107</sup></a> Lee, a longtime fan of <a href="baseball" class="uri" title="wikilink">baseball</a>, donated 200 baseballs signed by famous <a href="Negro_League" title="wikilink">Negro League</a> players, including <a href="Willie_Mays" title="wikilink">Willie Mays</a>, <a href="Hank_Aaron" title="wikilink">Hank Aaron</a> and <a href="Josh_Gibson" title="wikilink">Josh Gibson</a>, to the <a href="Negro_Leagues_Baseball_Museum" title="wikilink">Negro Leagues Baseball Museum</a> in June 2008.<a href="#fn108" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref108"><sup>108</sup></a></p>
<p>The band is featured on the <a href="Album_(Music)" title="wikilink">music album</a> <em><a href="Songs_for_Tibet" title="wikilink">Songs for Tibet</a></em>, appearing with a number of other celebrities as an initiative to support <a href="Tibet" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tibet</a> and the current <a href="Dalai_Lama" title="wikilink">Dalai Lama</a> <a href="Tenzin_Gyatso" title="wikilink">Tenzin Gyatso</a>. The album was made downloadable on August 5, 2008 via <a href="iTunes" class="uri" title="wikilink">iTunes</a> and was released commercially August 12, 2008.<a href="#fn109" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref109"><sup>109</sup></a></p>
