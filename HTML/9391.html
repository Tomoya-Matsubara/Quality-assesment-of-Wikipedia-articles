<p>&quot;<strong>Say Say Say</strong>&quot; is a pop song that was written and performed by <a href="Paul_McCartney" title="wikilink">Paul McCartney</a> and <a href="Michael_Jackson" title="wikilink">Michael Jackson</a>. The track was produced by <a href="George_Martin" title="wikilink">George Martin</a> for McCartney's fifth solo album, <em><a href="Pipes_of_Peace" title="wikilink">Pipes of Peace</a></em> (1983). The song was recorded during production of McCartney's 1982 <em><a href="Tug_of_War_(album)" title="wikilink">Tug of War</a></em> album, about a year before the release of &quot;The Girl Is Mine&quot;&lt;U+2014&gt;the pair's first duet from Jackson's record-breaking album, <em><a href="Thriller_(album)" title="wikilink">Thriller</a></em> (1982). After its release in October 1983, &quot;Say Say Say&quot; became Jackson's seventh top-ten hit inside a year. It was a number one hit in the United States, Norway, and Sweden, reached number two in the United Kingdom, and peaked within the top ten in Australia, Austria, New Zealand, the Netherlands and Switzerland.</p>
<p><a href="Music_recording_sales_certification" title="wikilink">Certified</a> platinum by the <a href="Recording_Industry_Association_of_America" title="wikilink">Recording Industry Association of America</a>, the song was promoted with a music video directed by <a href="Bob_Giraldi" title="wikilink">Bob Giraldi</a>. The video, filmed in <a href="Santa_Ynez_Valley" title="wikilink">Santa Ynez Valley</a>, California, featured cameo appearances by <a href="Linda_McCartney" title="wikilink">Linda McCartney</a> and <a href="La_Toya_Jackson" title="wikilink">La Toya Jackson</a>. The short film centers around two con artists called &quot;Mac and Jack&quot; (played by McCartney and Jackson), and is credited for the introduction of dialogue and storyline to music videos. The video was considered by the National Coalition on Television Violence to be too violent for broadcast in the US.</p>

<p>McCartney had already collaborated with Jackson on &quot;<a href="The_Girl_Is_Mine" title="wikilink">The Girl Is Mine</a>&quot;, from the latter's <em><a href="Thriller_(album)" title="wikilink">Thriller</a></em>, and in return Jackson agreed to work on &quot;Say Say Say&quot; for McCartney's <em><a href="Pipes_of_Peace" title="wikilink">Pipes of Peace</a></em>.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a><a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> McCartney biographer <a href="Ray_Coleman" title="wikilink">Ray Coleman</a> asserted that the majority of the song's lyrics were written by Jackson, and given to McCartney the next day.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> &quot;Say Say Say&quot; was recorded at <a href="Abbey_Road_Studios" title="wikilink">Abbey Road Studios</a> between May and September 1981. At the time, McCartney was recording <em><a href="Tug_of_War_(album)" title="wikilink">Tug of War</a></em>, the former <a href="The_Beatles" title="wikilink">Beatle</a>'s first solo album after the disbandment of his group <a href="Wings_(band)" title="wikilink">Wings</a>.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a><a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> Jackson stayed at the home of McCartney and his wife <a href="Linda_McCartney" title="wikilink">Linda</a> during the recording sessions, and became friends with both.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> While at the dining table one evening, Paul McCartney brought out a booklet that displayed all of the songs to which he owned the publishing rights. &quot;This is the way to make big money&quot;, the musician informed Jackson. &quot;Every time someone records one of these songs, I get paid. Every time someone plays these songs on the radio, or in live performances, I get paid.&quot; McCartney's words influenced Jackson's later purchase of the <a href="Northern_Songs" title="wikilink">Northern Songs</a> music catalogue in 1985.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>

<p>McCartney played several instruments on &quot;Say Say Say&quot;, including percussion, synthesiser, guitar and bass guitar. The <a href="harmonica" class="uri" title="wikilink">harmonica</a> was played by Chris Smith, and the <a href="rhythm_guitar" title="wikilink">rhythm guitar</a> was played by David Williams.

He said of his experience with Jackson, &quot;He actually does radiate an aura when he comes into the studio, there's no question about it. He's not a musician in the sense that Paul is ... but he does know what he wants in music and he has very firm ideas.&quot;<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a><a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> Jackson also spoke of the experience in his autobiography, <em><a href="Moonwalk_(book)" title="wikilink">Moonwalk</a></em>. The younger singer revealed that the collaboration boosted his confidence, as <a href="Quincy_Jones" title="wikilink">Quincy Jones</a>&lt;U+2014&gt;producer of <em>Thriller</em>&lt;U+2014&gt;was not present to correct his mistakes. Jackson added that he and McCartney worked as equals, stating, &quot;Paul never had to carry me in that studio.&quot;<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<p>&quot;Say Say Say&quot; is cited as a <a href="pop_song" title="wikilink">pop song</a> on the sheet music published on Musicnotes.com by <a href="Alfred_Music_Publishing" title="wikilink">Alfred Music Publishing</a>.

<h2 id="release-and-reception">Release and reception</h2>
<p>Following the release of <em>Thriller</em> and most of its singles, &quot;Say Say Say&quot; was released on 3 October 1983 by <a href="Parlophone_Records" title="wikilink">Parlophone Records</a> in the UK and <a href="Columbia_Records" title="wikilink">Columbia Records</a> in the US.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a><a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a><a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> It remained atop <a href="Billboard_Hot_100" title="wikilink"><em>Billboard</em>'s Hot 100</a> for six weeks and became Jackson's seventh top ten hit of 1983, breaking a record that until then was held jointly by The Beatles and <a href="Elvis_Presley" title="wikilink">Elvis Presley</a>.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a><a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a><a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> Also in the US, &quot;Say Say Say&quot; reached number two on the <a href="R&amp;B_chart" title="wikilink">R&amp;B chart</a> and number three on the <a href="Hot_Adult_Contemporary_Tracks" title="wikilink">Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks</a> chart.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> Although the song had peaked at number ten in the UK, it began to fall steadily; McCartney subsequently held an early weekday live television interview, where he discussed the song's music video. This, along with screenings of the video on <em><a href="Top_of_the_Pops" title="wikilink">Top of the Pops</a></em> (which normally played only singles that were rising in the charts), <em><a href="The_Tube_(TV_series)" title="wikilink">The Tube</a></em> and <a href="Noel_Edmonds" title="wikilink">Noel Edmonds</a>' <em><a href="The_Late,_Late_Breakfast_Show" title="wikilink">The Late, Late Breakfast Show</a></em>, helped propel the song to number two on the <a href="UK_Singles_Chart" title="wikilink">UK Singles Chart</a>.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a><a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> &quot;Say Say Say&quot; reached number one in Norway and Sweden, and the single also reached the top ten in Austria, Australia, New Zealand, the Netherlands, and Switzerland.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a><a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> With wholesale shipments of at least one million units, the single was later <a href="music_recording_sales_certification" title="wikilink">certified</a> platinum by the <a href="Recording_Industry_Association_of_America" title="wikilink">Recording Industry Association of America</a>.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a></p>
<p>&quot;Say Say Say&quot; received mixed reviews from <a href="music_critics" title="wikilink">music critics</a>. The lyrics were named the worst of 1983 by <em><a href="The_Buffalo_News" title="wikilink">The Buffalo News</a></em>'s Anthony Violanti,<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> while the <em><a href="Lexington_Herald-Leader" title="wikilink">Lexington Herald-Leader</a></em> stated in a review of <em>Pipes of Peace</em> that, aside from &quot;Say Say Say&quot; and &quot;The Man&quot;, &quot;McCartney waste[d] the rest of the album on bathos and whimsy&quot;.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> <em><a href="Los_Angeles_Times" title="wikilink">Los Angeles Times</a></em>' Paul Grein also reviewed the McCartney album and opined that the singer had redeemed himself with the success of the &quot;spunky&quot; song &quot;but plunged back into wimpdom with '<a href="No_More_Lonely_Nights" title="wikilink">No More Lonely Nights</a>'&quot;.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> Journalist Whitney Pastorek compared the song to McCartney's 1982 duet with <a href="Stevie_Wonder" title="wikilink">Stevie Wonder</a>, &quot;<a href="Ebony_and_Ivory" title="wikilink">Ebony and Ivory</a>&quot;. She asserted that &quot;Say Say Say&quot; was a better song, and had a better &quot;though slightly more nonsensical&quot; music video, adding that the song had no &quot;heavy-handed social content&quot;.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> <a href="Penn_State" title="wikilink">Penn State</a>'s <em><a href="The_Daily_Collegian_(Penn_State)" title="wikilink">The Daily Collegian</a></em> described the track as a good song, despite its <a href="ad_nauseam" title="wikilink">ad nauseam</a> broadcasts.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a></p>
<p><em>Deseret News</em> stated that the &quot;pleading love song&quot; had a &quot;masterful, catchy hook&quot;.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> In a <em><a href="Rolling_Stone" title="wikilink">Rolling Stone</a></em> review, the track was described as an &quot;amiable though vapid dance groove&quot;. The reviewer, Parke Puterbaugh, added that it was an &quot;instantly hit-bound froth-funk that tends, after all, toward banality&quot;.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> Music critic <a href="Nelson_George" title="wikilink">Nelson George</a> stated that &quot;Say Say Say&quot; would not have &quot;deserved the airplay it received without Michael Jackson&quot;.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> <a href="Salon.com" class="uri" title="wikilink">Salon.com</a> later described the song as a &quot;sappy duet&quot;.

<p>The music video (or &quot;short film&quot;) for &quot;Say Say Say&quot; was directed by <a href="Bob_Giraldi" title="wikilink">Bob Giraldi</a>, who had previously directed Michael Jackson's &quot;<a href="Beat_It" title="wikilink">Beat It</a>&quot;.

<p>In the short film, the duo play &quot;Mac and Jack&quot;, a pair of conmen who sell a &quot;miracle potion&quot;. The salesman (McCartney) offers Jackson the potion, and claims that it is &quot;guaranteed to give you the strength of a raging bull&quot;. Jackson drinks the potion and challenges a large man to arm wrestle. Unbeknownst to a watching crowd, the man&lt;U+2014&gt;along with Linda&lt;U+2014&gt;is also in on the scam. After Jackson wins the rigged contest, the crowd of people surge forward and buy the potion. Mac and Jack then donate all of the money earned from the scam to an orphanage.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a> Later, while in a hotel, Jackson enters the bathroom as McCartney shaves. The latter playfully dabs shaving foam on Jackson's cheek, despite the fact that the younger man does not need a shave. After this scene, McCartney and Jackson star as <a href="vaudeville" class="uri" title="wikilink">vaudeville</a> performers who sing and dance at a bar.<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> On stage, the duo appear in clown makeup at one point and quickly go through a number of costume changes.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a> Jackson's love interest, with whom he flirts, was played by his sister La Toya.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a> The video ends with Paul, Linda and Michael as drive they off into the sunset. La Toya, who was handed a bunch of flowers by McCartney, is left at the roadside.<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a></p>
<p>Director Giraldi said of Jackson and McCartney, &quot;Michael didn't outdance Paul, and Paul didn't outsing Michael&quot;. He added that production of the video was hard work because &quot;the egos could fill a room&quot;.<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a> The video introduced both dialogue and storyline, an element extended upon in <em><a href="Michael_Jackson&#39;s_Thriller" title="wikilink">Michael Jackson's Thriller</a></em>.<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a> After its release, the US National Coalition of Television Violence classified the music video as too violent to be aired. They also classified <em>Thriller</em> and more than half of the 200 videos surveyed from <a href="MTV" class="uri" title="wikilink">MTV</a> as being overly violent. The coalition included physical and verbal suggestions of violence, as well as acts of abuse, in their observings of around 900 music videos.<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a><a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a><a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a> In a list compiled by <em>Billboard</em> at the end of 1984, the music video was named the fourth best of the year, and the rest of the top four were also short films by Jackson.<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a></p>
<p><em><a href="The_Manchester_Evening_News" title="wikilink">The Manchester Evening News</a></em> later described the &quot;Say Say Say&quot; video as an &quot;anarchic caper&quot; that &quot;plays out like an <a href="Emir_Kusturica" title="wikilink">Emir Kusturica</a> feature&quot;.<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a> <a href="PopMatters" class="uri" title="wikilink">PopMatters</a> stated that the music videos of &quot;Say Say Say&quot; and &quot;<a href="Goodnight_Tonight" title="wikilink">Goodnight Tonight</a>&quot; turned &quot;a pair of otherwise forgettable songs into something worth watching&quot;.<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a> Steven Greenlee of <em><a href="The_Boston_Globe" title="wikilink">The Boston Globe</a></em> reflected that the video was both &quot;horrifying and compelling&quot;, and stated the ridiculousness of a potion which could aid Jackson in beating somebody at arm wrestling. He added, &quot;It's even harder to believe that the two of them didn't get the pulp beaten out of them in that bar for dressing like a pair of <a href="Chess_King" title="wikilink">Chess King</a> employees&quot;.<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a> The &quot;Say Say Say&quot; video was later included on the DVD <em><a href="The_McCartney_Years" title="wikilink">The McCartney Years</a></em>.<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="themes">Themes</h3>
<p>Two authors later reviewed the short film and documented two central themes. The first is a &quot;Child/Man&quot; theme; the role of both a boy and an adult, which writer James M. Curtis states Jackson plays throughout the music video for &quot;Say Say Say&quot;.<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a> Curtis writes that the bathroom scene involving the shaving foam is reminiscent of boys copying their fathers. He adds that the scene marks &quot;the distinction between Michael's roles as a Child and as a Man&quot;. The writer also highlights the part where the singer supposedly becomes strengthened with a miracle potion, a further play on the &quot;Child/Man&quot; theme.<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a> Furthermore, Curtis observes that Paul and Linda McCartney seem to act as if they are Jackson's parents in the short film.<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a> The author also notes that in a scene where Jackson is handed a bouquet of flowers from a girl, it is a reversal of one from <em><a href="City_Lights" title="wikilink">City Lights</a></em>, a 1931 film starring <a href="Charlie_Chaplin" title="wikilink">Charlie Chaplin</a>, whom the singer greatly adored.<a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a></p>
<p>The second of the two main themes in the music video is of <a href="African_American_history" title="wikilink">African American history</a> and <a href="African_American_culture" title="wikilink">culture</a>, as some of the vaudeville scenes in the short film acknowledge <a href="minstrel_shows" title="wikilink">minstrel shows</a> and <a href="blackface" class="uri" title="wikilink">blackface</a>.<a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a> Author W. T. Lhamon writes that the video is set in the Californian Depression, and that McCartney and Jackson &quot;convey a compactly corrupt history of blackface&quot; as they con their way to riches with the Mack and Jack show.<a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a> Lhamon was critical of the pair and of the video because he felt that the African American theme had not been made explicitly known. The author expressed his view that aspects of the short film were historically out-of-synch with interracial relations.<a href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a> He stated, &quot;Nearly everything in the video is backward. Mack's white hand continually helping black Jack on board, for instance, reverses the general process I have shown of blacks providing whites with their sustaining gestures.&quot;<a href="#fn67" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a> Lhamon added, &quot;In a just world, Jackson should be pulling McCartney onto the wagon, not the other way around.&quot;<a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a></p>
