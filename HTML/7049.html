<p><strong>7 World Trade Center</strong> is a building in <a href="New_York_City" title="wikilink">New York City</a> located across from the <a href="World_Trade_Center_site" title="wikilink">World Trade Center site</a> in <a href="Lower_Manhattan" title="wikilink">Lower Manhattan</a>. It is the second building to bear that name and address in that location. The original structure was completed in 1987 and fell after the Twin Towers collapsed in the <a href="September_11_attacks" title="wikilink">September 11 attacks</a>. The current 7 World Trade Center opened in 2006 on part of the site of the old 7 World Trade Center. Both buildings were developed by <a href="Larry_Silverstein" title="wikilink">Larry Silverstein</a>, who holds a <a href="ground_rent" title="wikilink">ground lease</a> for the site from the <a href="Port_Authority_of_New_York_and_New_Jersey" title="wikilink">Port Authority of New York and New Jersey</a>.</p>
<p>The original 7 World Trade Center was 47 stories tall, clad in red exterior masonry, and occupied a <a href="trapezoid" title="wikilink">trapezoidal</a> footprint. An elevated walkway connected the building to the <a href="World_Trade_Center" title="wikilink">World Trade Center</a> plaza. The building was situated above a <a href="Consolidated_Edison" title="wikilink">Consolidated Edison</a> (Con Ed) power substation, which imposed unique structural design constraints. When the building opened in 1987, Silverstein had difficulties attracting tenants. In 1988, <a href="Salomon_Brothers" title="wikilink">Salomon Brothers</a> signed a long-term lease, and became the main tenants of the building. On September 11, 2001, 7 WTC was damaged by debris when the nearby North Tower of the <a href="collapse_of_the_World_Trade_Center" title="wikilink">World Trade Center collapsed</a>. The debris also ignited fires, which continued to burn throughout the afternoon on lower floors of the building. The building's internal fire suppression system lacked water pressure to fight the fires, and the building collapsed completely at 5:21:10 pm.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> The collapse began when a critical internal column buckled and triggered structural failure throughout, which was first visible from the exterior with the crumbling of a rooftop penthouse structure at 5:20:33 pm.</p>
<p>Construction of the new 7 World Trade Center began in 2002 and was completed in 2006. The building is 49 stories tall (plus one underground floor), making it the 28th-tallest in New York.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> It is built on a smaller footprint than the original, allowing <a href="Greenwich_Street,_Manhattan" title="wikilink">Greenwich Street</a> to be restored from <a href="TriBeCa" class="uri" title="wikilink">TriBeCa</a> through the World Trade Center site and south to <a href="Battery_Park" title="wikilink">Battery Park</a>. The new building is bounded by <a href="Greenwich_Street_(Manhattan)" title="wikilink">Greenwich</a>, <a href="Vesey_Street_(Manhattan)" title="wikilink">Vesey</a>, <a href="Washington_Street_(Manhattan)" title="wikilink">Washington</a>, and Barclay streets. A small park across Greenwich Street occupies space that was part of the original building's footprint. The current 7 World Trade Center's design emphasizes safety, with a <a href="reinforced_concrete" title="wikilink">reinforced concrete</a> core, wider stairways, and thicker fireproofing of steel columns. It also incorporates numerous <a href="green_design" title="wikilink">green design</a> features. The building was the first commercial office building in New York City to receive the U.S. Green Building Council's <a href="Leadership_in_Energy_and_Environmental_Design" title="wikilink">Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design</a> (LEED) certification, where it won a gold rating. It was also one of the first projects accepted to be part of the Council's Pilot Program for Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design &lt;U+2013&gt; Core and Shell Development (LEED-CS).<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>

<p>The building was constructed above a <a href="Consolidated_Edison" title="wikilink">Con Edison</a> <a href="electrical_substation" title="wikilink">substation</a> that had been on the site since 1967.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> The substation had a <a href="caisson_(engineering)" title="wikilink">caisson</a> foundation designed to carry the weight of a future building of 25 stories containing .<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> The final design for 7 World Trade Center was for a much larger building than originally planned when the substation was built.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> The structural design of 7 World Trade Center therefore included a system of gravity column transfer trusses and girders, located between floors 5 and 7, to transfer loads to the smaller foundation.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> Existing caissons installed in 1967 were used, along with new ones, to accommodate the building. The 5th floor functioned as a structural diaphragm, providing lateral stability and distribution of loads between the new and old caissons. Above the 7th floor, the building's structure was a typical <a href="Tube_(structure)" title="wikilink">tube-frame</a> design, with columns in the core and on the perimeter, and lateral loads resisted by perimeter moment frames.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> <img src="Wtc7_transfer_trusses.png" title="fig:Transfer trusses used on the 5&lt;U+2013&gt;7th floors to redistribute load to the foundation" alt="Transfer trusses used on the 5&lt;U+2013&gt;7th floors to redistribute load to the foundation" width="300" /> A shipping and receiving ramp, which served the entire World Trade Center complex, occupied the eastern quarter of the 7 World Trade Center footprint.

<p>In June 1986, before construction was completed, Silverstein signed <a href="Drexel_Burnham_Lambert" title="wikilink">Drexel Burnham Lambert</a> as a tenant to lease the entire 7 World Trade Center building for $3 billion over a term of 30 years.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> In December 1986, after the <a href="Ivan_Boesky" title="wikilink">Boesky</a> <a href="insider_trading" title="wikilink">insider-trading</a> scandal, Drexel Burnham Lambert canceled the lease, leaving Silverstein to find other tenants.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> Spicer &amp; Oppenheim agreed to lease 14 percent of the space, but for more than a year, as <a href="Black_Monday_(1987)" title="wikilink">Black Monday</a> and other factors adversely affected the <a href="Lower_Manhattan" title="wikilink">Lower Manhattan</a> real estate market, Silverstein was unable to find tenants for the remaining space. By April 1988, Silverstein had lowered the rent and made other concessions.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a></p>
<p>In November 1988, <a href="Salomon_Brothers" title="wikilink">Salomon Brothers</a> withdrew from plans to build a large new complex at <a href="Columbus_Circle" title="wikilink">Columbus Circle</a> in <a href="Midtown_Manhattan" title="wikilink">Midtown</a> and agreed to a 20-year lease for the top 19 floors of 7 World Trade Center.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> The building was extensively renovated in 1989 to accommodate the needs of Salomon Brothers. This led to the alternative naming of the building as the Salomon Brothers building.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> Most of three existing floors were removed as tenants continued to occupy other floors, and more than 350 tons (U.S.) of steel were added to construct three double-height trading floors. Nine diesel generators were installed on the 5th floor as part of a backup power station. &quot;Essentially, Salomon is constructing a building within a building &lt;U+2013&gt; and it's an occupied building, which complicates the situation,&quot; said a district manager of <a href="Silverstein_Properties" title="wikilink">Silverstein Properties</a>.

FEMA made preliminary findings that the collapse was not primarily caused by actual impact damage from the collapse of 1 WTC and 2 WTC but by fires on multiple stories ignited by debris from the other two towers that continued unabated due to lack of water for sprinklers or manual firefighting. The report did not reach conclusions about the cause of the collapse and called for further investigation.<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a></p>

<p>In November 2008, NIST released its final report on the causes of the collapse of 7 World Trade Center.<a href="#fn67" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a> This followed NIST's August 21, 2008 draft report which included a period for public comments.<a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a> In its investigation, NIST utilized <a href="ANSYS" class="uri" title="wikilink">ANSYS</a> to model events leading up to collapse initiation and <a href="LS-DYNA" class="uri" title="wikilink">LS-DYNA</a> models to simulate the global response to the initiating events.<a href="#fn69" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref69"><sup>69</sup></a> NIST determined that diesel fuel did not play an important role, nor did the structural damage from the collapse of the Twin Towers, nor did the transfer elements (trusses, girders, and cantilever overhangs). But the lack of water to fight the fire was an important factor. The fires burned out of control during the afternoon, causing floor beams near column 79 to expand and push a key girder off its seat, triggering the floors to fail around column 79 on Floors 8 to 14. With a loss of lateral support across nine floors, column 79 buckled &lt;U+2013&gt; pulling the east penthouse and nearby columns down with it. With the buckling of these critical columns, the collapse then progressed east-to-west across the core, ultimately overloading the perimeter support, which buckled between Floors 7 and 17, causing the remaining portion of the building above to fall downward as a single unit. The fires, fueled by office contents, along with the lack of water, were the key reasons for the collapse.<a href="#fn70" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a></p>

<p>Files relating to numerous federal investigations had been housed in 7 World Trade Center. The files for thousands of <a href="U.S._Securities_and_Exchange_Commission" title="wikilink">SEC</a> cases were destroyed, though the SEC has said most of the important files were backed up or could be reconstructed. <a href="Salomon_Brothers" title="wikilink">Salomon Brothers</a>, a subsidiary of <a href="Citigroup" class="uri" title="wikilink">Citigroup</a>, lost files later requested by the SEC concerning its connection with the <a href="WorldCom" class="uri" title="wikilink">WorldCom</a> scandal.<a href="#fn75" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref75"><sup>75</sup></a> The <a href="Equal_Employment_Opportunity_Commission" title="wikilink">Equal Employment Opportunity Commission</a> estimated over 10,000 of its cases were affected.<a href="#fn76" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref76"><sup>76</sup></a> Investigative files in the Secret Service's largest field office were also lost in the collapse, with one Secret Service agent saying, &quot;All the evidence that we stored at 7 World Trade, in all our cases, went down with the building.&quot;<a href="#fn77" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref77"><sup>77</sup></a></p>
<p>The NIST report found no evidence supporting <a href="World_Trade_Center_controlled_demolition_conspiracy_theories#7_World_Trade_Center" title="wikilink">conspiracy theories</a> that 7 World Trade Center was brought down by controlled demolition. Specifically, the window breakage pattern and blast sounds that would have resulted from the use of explosives were not observed.<a href="#fn78" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref78"><sup>78</sup></a> The suggestion that an incendiary material such as <a href="thermite" class="uri" title="wikilink">thermite</a> was used instead of explosives was considered unlikely by NIST because of observations of the fire and the building's structural response to the fire, and because it is unlikely the necessary quantity of material could have been planted without discovery.<a href="#fn79" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref79"><sup>79</sup></a></p>
<p>The old 7 World Trade Center was the first tall building known to have collapsed primarily due to uncontrolled fires.<a href="#fn80" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref80"><sup>80</sup></a> Based on its investigation, NIST reiterated several recommendations it had made in its earlier report on the collapse of the Twin Towers, and urged immediate action on a further recommendation: that fire resistance should be evaluated under the assumption that sprinklers are unavailable; and that the effects of thermal expansion on floor support systems be considered. Recognizing that current building codes are drawn to prevent loss of life rather than building collapse, the main point of NIST's recommendations was that buildings should not collapse from fire even if sprinklers are unavailable.<a href="#fn81" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref81"><sup>81</sup></a></p>

The wall is structurally fortified as a security measure.<a href="#fn93" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref93"><sup>93</sup></a></p>
<p>The building is being promoted as the safest skyscraper in the U.S.<a href="#fn94" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref94"><sup>94</sup></a> According to Silverstein Properties, the owner of the building, it &quot;will incorporate a host of life-safety enhancements that will become the prototype for new high-rise construction&quot;.<a href="#fn95" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref95"><sup>95</sup></a> The building has 2 ft (60 cm) thick <a href="reinforced_concrete" title="wikilink">reinforced-concrete</a> and <a href="fireproofing" title="wikilink">fireproofed</a> elevator and stairway access shafts. The original building used only <a href="drywall" class="uri" title="wikilink">drywall</a> to line these shafts.<a href="#fn96" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref96"><sup>96</sup></a> The stairways are wider than in the original building to permit faster egress.<a href="#fn97" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref97"><sup>97</sup></a></p>

<p>Once construction of the power substation was complete in October 2003, work proceeded on building the office tower. An unusual approach was used in constructing the building; erecting the steel frame before adding the concrete core. This approach allowed the construction schedule to be shortened by a few months.<a href="#fn107" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref107"><sup>107</sup></a> Construction was completed in 2006 at a cost of $700 million.<a href="#fn108" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref108"><sup>108</sup></a> Though Silverstein received $861 million from insurance on the old building, he still had $400 million remaining in mortgage to pay off.<a href="#fn109" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref109"><sup>109</sup></a> Costs to rebuild were covered by $475 million in <a href="Liberty_bond" title="wikilink">Liberty Bonds</a>, which provide tax-exempt financing to help stimulate rebuilding in Lower Manhattan and insurance money that remained after other expenses.<a href="#fn110" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref110"><sup>110</sup></a></p>
<p>A  triangular park was created between the extended Greenwich Street and West Broadway by David Childs with Ken Smith and his colleague, Annie Weinmayr, of Ken Smith Landscape Architect.
