At the age of 19, Hull became the elected chairman of the <a href="Clay_County,_Tennessee" title="wikilink">Clay County</a> <a href="Democratic_Party_(United_States)" title="wikilink">Democratic Party</a>. In 1891, he graduated from <a href="Cumberland_School_of_Law" title="wikilink">Cumberland School of Law</a> at <a href="Cumberland_University" title="wikilink">Cumberland University</a> and was admitted to the <a href="bar_(law)" title="wikilink">bar</a>.

<p>Hull married Rose Frances (Witz) Whitney (?1875-1954) in 1917; the couple had no children.</p>
<h2 id="early-national-career">Early national career</h2>
<p>From 1903 to 1907, Hull served as a local judge; later he was elected to the <a href="United_States_House_of_Representatives" title="wikilink">United States House of Representatives</a> where he served 11 terms (1907-1921 and 1923-1931) totaling 22 years. After his defeat in 1920, he served as chairman of the <a href="Democratic_National_Committee" title="wikilink">Democratic National Committee</a>. As a member of the powerful <a href="U.S._House_Committee_on_Ways_and_Means" title="wikilink">Ways and Means committee</a>, he fought for low tariffs and claimed authorship of the federal income tax laws of 1913 and 1916 and the <a href="inheritance_tax" title="wikilink">inheritance tax</a> of 1916. Hull was influential in advising <a href="Albert_Gore,_Sr." title="wikilink">Albert Gore, Sr.</a>, then a state legislator, to run for the U.S. Congress in 1938.</p>

<p>He was elected to the <a href="United_States_Senate" title="wikilink">Senate</a> in 1930. In 1933, Roosevelt named him Secretary of State. Roosevelt often ignored Hull in making major foreign policy decisions, leaving the Secretary, in the opinion of most historians, to play the role of a highly popular empty suit. Hull did try to enlarge foreign trade and lower tariffs. In 1943, Hull served as United States delegate to the <a href="Moscow_Conference" title="wikilink">Moscow Conference</a>.</p>
<p>Hull chaired the <a href="Advisory_Committee_of_Postwar_Foreign_Policy" title="wikilink">Advisory Committee of Postwar Foreign Policy</a>, created in February 1942.</p>

The islands remained under the Free French movement until the end of <a href="World_War_II" title="wikilink">World War II</a>.</p>
<p>Hull was the underlying force and architect in the <a href="United_Nations_Conference_on_International_Organization" title="wikilink">creation</a> of the <a href="United_Nations" title="wikilink">United Nations</a>, as recognized by the 1945 Nobel Prize for Peace, an honor for which Franklin D.

Hull and his staff drafted the &quot;<a href="United_Nations_Charter" title="wikilink">Charter of the United Nations</a>&quot; in mid-1943.</p>
<p>Never one to sit idly by if American interests were (in his view) threatened, Hull would think nothing of dressing down close allies, such as what happened to <a href="New_Zealand" title="wikilink">New Zealand</a> <a href="Prime_Minister" title="wikilink">Prime Minister</a> <a href="Peter_Fraser" title="wikilink">Peter Fraser</a> in early 1944, over U.S. objections to the <a href="Canberra_Pact" title="wikilink">Canberra Pact</a> (a military treaty of alliance between Australia and New Zealand made in February 1944 without U.S. consultation).</p>
<h2 id="later-years">Later years</h2>
<p>Hull resigned as Secretary of State in November 1944 because of failing health. Roosevelt described Hull, upon his departure as &quot;the one person in all the world who has done his most to make this great plan for peace (the United Nations) an effective fact&quot;. The <a href="Norwegian_Nobel_Committee" title="wikilink">Norwegian Nobel Committee</a> honored Hull with the <a href="Nobel_Peace_Prize" title="wikilink">Nobel Peace Prize</a> in 1945 in recognition of his efforts for peace and understanding in the <a href="Western_Hemisphere" title="wikilink">Western Hemisphere</a>, his trade agreements, and his work to establish the United Nations.
