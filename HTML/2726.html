<p><strong>James Walker</strong> <a href="Order_of_the_Bath" title="wikilink">CB</a>, <a href="Order_of_the_Tower_and_Sword" title="wikilink">KTS</a> (1764 &lt;U+2013&gt; 13 July 1831) was an officer of the <a href="Royal_Navy" title="wikilink">Royal Navy</a>. He served during the <a href="American_War_of_Independence" title="wikilink">American War of Independence</a>, and the <a href="French_Revolutionary_Wars" title="wikilink">French Revolutionary</a> and <a href="Napoleonic_Wars" title="wikilink">Napoleonic Wars</a>, rising to the rank of <a href="Admiral_(Royal_Navy)" title="wikilink">Rear-Admiral</a>.</p>
<p>Walker spent his early years in the navy at first in British waters during the invasion scares of 1779, and then in North American waters where he saw action at most of the decisive naval battles of the war, particularly at the <a href="Battle_of_the_Chesapeake" title="wikilink">Chesapeake</a>, <a href="Battle_of_St._Kitts" title="wikilink">St. Kitts</a> and the <a href="Battle_of_the_Saintes" title="wikilink">Saintes</a>. He reached the rank of lieutenant before the end of hostilities and spent the interwar years travelling on the continent. Returning to service with the outbreak of war with the French, he again participated in many of the key naval actions of the period, with his service at the <a href="Glorious_First_of_June" title="wikilink">Glorious First of June</a> securing his promotion to his own commands. His career was almost ended with an accusation of disobeying orders, which led to his dismissal from the navy, but he was reinstated in time to develop a plan to subdue the <a href="Spithead_and_Nore_mutinies" title="wikilink">mutinies at Spithead and the Nore</a>. He commanded a ship at the <a href="Battle_of_Camperdown" title="wikilink">Battle of Camperdown</a>, and another at the <a href="Battle_of_Copenhagen" title="wikilink">Battle of Copenhagen</a>, earning Nelson's praise for his actions.</p>
<p>The early part of the Napoleonic Wars were spent in the Caribbean, where Walker played an important role in the <a href="Haitian_Revolution" title="wikilink">Haitian Revolution</a>, and took the surrender of a French garrison. After time spent escorting convoys, Walker joined the ships covering the <a href="transfer_of_the_Portuguese_Court_to_Brazil" title="wikilink">transfer of the Portuguese Court to Brazil</a>, and struck up a friendship with the <a href="John_VI_of_Portugal" title="wikilink">Prince Regent</a>. His association with royalty continued with his services in transporting the <a href="William_IV_of_the_United_Kingdom" title="wikilink">Duke of Clarence</a>, <a href="Alexander_I_of_Russia" title="wikilink">Tsar Alexander I of Russia</a> and <a href="Frederick_William_III_of_Prussia" title="wikilink">King Frederick William III of Prussia</a>, and he duly invested as a <a href="Order_of_the_Bath" title="wikilink">Companion of the Order of the Bath</a> and a <a href="Order_of_the_Tower_and_Sword" title="wikilink">Knight of the Order of the Tower and Sword</a>. His later years were spent managing a fleet off the American coast during the <a href="War_of_1812" title="wikilink">War of 1812</a>, and after commanding several ships after the end of the wars, retired with the rank of rear-admiral.</p>

<p>With the end of the American War of Independence in 1783 Walker visited the continent, touring through France, Germany and Italy.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> While in <a href="Vienna" class="uri" title="wikilink">Vienna</a> in 1787, news reached him of political troubles with the Dutch, and he began to journey back to England in hope of a commission.

<p>The outbreak of the <a href="Russo-Turkish_War_(1787&lt;U+2013&gt;1792)" title="wikilink">Russo-Turkish War</a> created a new opportunity for Walker, when in 1788 the <a href="Russian_Empire" title="wikilink">Russians</a> offered him command of a ship.
