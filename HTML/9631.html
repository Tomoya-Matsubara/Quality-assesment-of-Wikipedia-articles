<p><strong>Rossall School</strong> is a <a href="United_Kingdom" title="wikilink">British</a>, <a href="Coeducation" title="wikilink">co-educational</a>, <a href="Independent_school" title="wikilink">independent</a>, <a href="Day_school" title="wikilink">day</a> and <a href="boarding_school" title="wikilink">boarding school</a> in <a href="Fleetwood" class="uri" title="wikilink">Fleetwood</a>, <a href="Lancashire" class="uri" title="wikilink">Lancashire</a>. It was founded in <a href="1844" class="uri" title="wikilink">1844</a> by The Rev. St Vincent Beechey as a sister school to <a href="Marlborough_College" title="wikilink">Marlborough College</a> which had been founded the previous year. Its establishment was &quot;with the object of giving to the sons of <a href="clergymen" class="uri" title="wikilink">clergymen</a> and others an education similar to that of the great <a href="public_school" title="wikilink">public schools</a>, but without the great cost of <a href="Eton_College" title="wikilink">Eton</a> or <a href="Harrow_School" title="wikilink">Harrow</a>, and embracing also a more general course of instruction in <a href="modern_literature" title="wikilink">modern literature</a> and <a href="science" class="uri" title="wikilink">science</a>.&quot;) Set in an 160 acre estate next to Rossall Beach, Rossall is also a member of the <a href="Headmasters&#39;_and_Headmistresses&#39;_Conference" title="wikilink">Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference</a> and was granted a royal charter in 1890.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="school-life">School Life</h2>
<p>The daily timetable consists of 6 one hour schools (periods) a day: with a break between schools 2 &amp; 3 and lunch after school 3. Tea is also offered to boarders. Lessons are from Monday to Friday and Saturday morning. Every year the school's students in the <a href="sixth_form" title="wikilink">sixth form</a> can become chosen as school monitors. It offers both <a href="Advanced_Level_(UK)" title="wikilink">A-levels</a> and the <a href="International_Baccalaureate" title="wikilink">International Baccalaureate</a> Diploma to its <a href="Sixth_form" title="wikilink">Sixth form</a> students.</p>
<h2 id="the-ccf">The CCF</h2>
<p>Rossall is noted for being the first school in the United Kingdom to form a <a href="Combined_Cadet_Force" title="wikilink">Combined Cadet Force</a> (CCF),<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> being founded in <a href="1859" class="uri" title="wikilink">1859</a> with the threat of a French/Irish Catholic invasion at its height. The institution is still present in the school today with around 100 <a href="cadet" title="wikilink">cadets</a> currently enlisted. In recent years the shooting team has excelled with notable victories in the Home Guard Cup and Loyal&lt;U+2019&gt;s Regimental Cup. <img src="Rossallfromtheair.jpg" title="fig:An ariel view of Rossall" alt="An ariel view of Rossall" width="300" /></p>
<h2 id="the-carmen">The Carmen</h2>
<p>The Rossall School song, <em>The Carmen</em> was composed by Dr. C.H.Lloyd, later organist at <a href="Gloucester_Cathedral" title="wikilink">Gloucester Cathedral</a> and <a href="Christ_Church_College" title="wikilink">Christ Church College</a> and then Director of Music at Eton. It is sung at major school events including Old Rossallian dinners and end of term assemblies. Tradition has it that when singing it one must stand up on a bench/chair and belt it out with appropriate gusto. Usually only the first verse is sung, however there are 3 full verses. The full lyrics:</p>
<p>Concinamus admirantes<br />
Propter fluctus asstuantes<br />
Stantem te, Rossallia!<br />
Alma mater, te bibamus,<br />
Tui calices proscamus!<br />
Hanc sententium decamus,<br />

<h2 id="houses">Houses</h2>
<p>Like many independent schools Rossall adopted a <a href="house_system" title="wikilink">house system</a> early on, with each pupil belonging to a house. It forms an integral part of life at the school and there are frequent inter-house events in sports as well as the arts. The current houses are: <img src="RossallSchoolSquare.jpg" title="fig:Spread Eagle House" alt="Spread Eagle House" width="300" /></p>

<h2 id="brief-history-of-rossall">Brief History of Rossall</h2>
<p><img src="SumnerLibrary.jpg" title="fig:Rossall Sumner Library (Formerly the school chapel)" alt="Rossall Sumner Library (Formerly the school chapel)" width="300" /> Having been founded in 1844, on land that had historically belonged to the <a href="William_Cardinal_Allen" title="wikilink">Allen Family</a>, Rossall nearly shut down within a few years due to huge outbreaks of <a href="Scarlet_Fever" title="wikilink">Scarlet Fever</a> - not unusual for boarding schools of the time. In the 1860s a new school chapel had to be built to cope the increasing number of students, the old chapel serving, as it does today, as the school library. The school underwent futher development from 1880s to 1900 to accomodate more students and to create further facilities such as the gym which still stands. By the end of <a href="Queen_Victoria" title="wikilink">Queen Victoria</a>'s reign Rossall was widely considered to be in top 30 public schools in the UK <a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> also earning itself a place in the <a href="independent_school_(UK)#Public_Schools_Yearbook" title="wikilink">Public Schools Yearbook</a>.</p>
<p>During the <a href="world_wars" title="wikilink">world wars</a> large numbers of Old Rossallians lost their lives in combat - the majority of whom are now comemmorated in the extension memorial chapel. During the <a href="Second_World_War" title="wikilink">Second World War</a> Rossall also accomodated <a href="Alleyn&#39;s_School" title="wikilink">Alleyn's School</a> who had to be evacuated from London as a result of the risk of bombing. The school continued to succeed and in the 1970s, in a bid to ensure the highest standards, during a period of declining boarding, girls were allowed to enroll.</p>
<p>Throughout the 1980s the school continued to prosper, though going through great financial difficulty at the turn of the millenium. Rossall has since had a large amount of investment, with the boarding houses currently undergoing refurbishment and large restructuring throughout the years. The middle school now runs from years 7 to 9, one year longer than traditionally. As a part of the modernising of the school the <a href="IB" class="uri" title="wikilink">IB</a> was introduced as an alternative to <a href="A-Levels" class="uri" title="wikilink">A-Levels</a> towards the end of the 1990s, being only the 3rd school in the <a href="UK" class="uri" title="wikilink">UK</a> to do so, and there is now also a large international boarding contingent.</p>
<p>Rossall is still comitted to relatively affordable private education in relation to the rest of the <a href="UK" class="uri" title="wikilink">UK</a> - 80% of those who attend the school are the first in their family to attend and independent school<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> and a large number of <a href="scholarships" class="uri" title="wikilink">scholarships</a> and <a href="bursaries" class="uri" title="wikilink">bursaries</a> are available. 2007 sees the return of the Rossall Summer School - developed to give children from outside of the UK the opportunity to develop their English speaking skills as well as being a chance for those thinking of going to a boarding school to prepare for the change in daily lifestyle.</p>

<p><img src="RossallObservatory.jpg" title="fig:The refurbished Rossall Observatory. (Inset - the observatory before restoration)" alt="The refurbished Rossall Observatory. (Inset - the observatory before restoration)" width="300" /> Rossall is also home to the Lawrence House Astronomy &amp; Space Science Centre - the only centre dedicated solely to the teaching of <a href="Astronomy" class="uri" title="wikilink">Astronomy</a><a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a>. The project consists of the 9 foot Victorian Telescope in Rossall's Assheton Observatory as well as a building of its own containing a lecture theatre, classrooms and a portable planetarium.</p>
<p>The project has been funded by the <a href="Lawrence_House_Trust" title="wikilink">Lawrence House Trust</a> and predominantly run by Dr. Nick Lister, originally the head of D.T. at the school and now Astronomer in Residence. When initial assessments were being made for the feasability of restoring the observatory, both the telescope and observatory were in a poor condition, having notably been victim to an attempt to burn it down by some local children. However, the telescope is made predominantly from <a href="brass" class="uri" title="wikilink">brass</a> and thus suffered minimal corrosion. Similarly the lens of the telescope, despite 30 years of neglect, survived unscathed allowing for restoration. This was carried out at first by several dedicated parents and governors of the school, amongst them <a href="Syd_Little" title="wikilink">Syd Little</a>.</p>
<p>Soon after the basic restoration ideas were raised for a larger project allowing the teaching of astronomy on a larger scale. After getting clearance from the original owners of the telescope to go ahead with the project, Rossall was given funds from the Lawrence House Trust, an educational charity, to go forward with their plans.</p>
<p>The centre had an official opening on Tuesday 26th September 2006 with Old Rossallian and former Astronomer Royal <a href="Francis_Graham_Smith" title="wikilink">Sir Francis Graham Smith</a> in attendence. The centre's motto is 'Astronomy For All' meaning that it offers courses to Rossall Students but also at a small cost to the general public. Courses also range from beginner to advanced to ensure that anybody who wishes to study <a href="Astronomy" class="uri" title="wikilink">Astronomy</a> can do so.</p>

<h2 id="odd-yet-true-rossall-anecdotes">Odd Yet True Rossall Anecdotes</h2>
<ul>
<li>In 1911 the Rossall Bursar, Major Anstead (A very peculiar chap who was always seen riding a horse in full military uniform.), was found to be attempting to enlist in London for military service in South Africa. The Rossallian who spotted him informed the police. Simultaneously Rossall was nearly forced to file for bankruptcy. After investigation it turned out that Major Anstead had been tampering with the books and had embezzled over &lt;U+00A3&gt;70,000, equivalent to more than &lt;U+00A3&gt;1million today. He had used the money to finance his extravagant lifestyle, uniforms and an expensive mistress in London. <a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></li>
<li>The original school dining hall burnt down in the 1920s. The replacement, the current dining hall, was built the wrong way around. Not only was it built the wrong way around, it was constructed from bricks encased in a weatherable coating that would dissolve away to leave it looking in the same condition as the rest of the square. Unfortunately, despite the best efforts of the north Lancashire climate and the Irish Sea, the bricks have yet to fully weather, or in most cases weather in any way at all. Hence its peculiar colour compared with the rest of the Rossall buildings.</li>
<li>In the early 20th century one particularly unpopular school chaplain, Revd. Sleep, was subject to an assassination attempt from the students. Arsenic in the sugar was the means chosen by the students to rid the school of the hated priest. However, the plot was outed before any of the affected sugar was consumed. <a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></li>
