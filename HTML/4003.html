<p><strong>Dru Hill</strong> is an <a href="United_States" title="wikilink">American</a> <a href="singer" title="wikilink">singing</a> group, most popular during the late <a href="1990s" class="uri" title="wikilink">1990s</a>, whose repertoire included <a href="Contemporary_R&amp;B" title="wikilink">R&amp;B</a>, <a href="soul_music" title="wikilink">soul</a>, and <a href="gospel_music" title="wikilink">gospel music</a>. Founded in <a href="Baltimore,_Maryland" title="wikilink">Baltimore, Maryland</a> and active since <a href="1992" class="uri" title="wikilink">1992</a>, Dru Hill recorded seven <a href="Top_40" title="wikilink">Top 40</a> hits, and is best known for the R&amp;B #1 hits &quot;In My Bed&quot;, &quot;Never Make a Promise&quot;, and &quot;How Deep is Your Love&quot;. <a href="Nokio_the_N-Tity" title="wikilink">Tamir &quot;Nokio&quot; Ruffin</a> was the group's founder and leader; his bandmates included main lead singer <a href="Sisq&lt;U+00F3&gt;" title="wikilink">Mark &quot;Sisq&lt;U+00F3&gt;&quot; Andrews</a>, <a href="Larry_&quot;Jazz&quot;_Anthony" title="wikilink">Larry &quot;Jazz&quot; Anthony</a>, and <a href="Woody_Rock" title="wikilink">James &quot;Woody Rock&quot; Green</a>. Signing to <a href="Island_Records" title="wikilink">Island Records</a> through Haqq Islam's University Records imprint, Dru Hill released two successful LPs before separating for a period from late <a href="1999" class="uri" title="wikilink">1999</a> to <a href="2002" class="uri" title="wikilink">2002</a>, during which time Sisq&lt;U+00F3&gt; and Woody released solo albums. While Woody's <em>Soul Music</em> LP was a moderate success in the gospel music industry, Sisq&lt;U+00F3&gt;'s <em><a href="Unleash_the_Dragon" title="wikilink">Unleash the Dragon</a></em> LP and its hit single &quot;<a href="Thong_Song" title="wikilink">Thong Song</a>&quot; were major successes, and established Sisq&lt;U+00F3&gt; as a household name outside of Dru Hill.</p>
<p>In 2002, by then part of the <a href="Def_Jam_Recordings" title="wikilink">Def Soul</a> record label, the group reunited and added fifth member Rufus &quot;Scola&quot; Waller to the lineup for their third LP, <em><a href="Dru_World_Order" title="wikilink">Dru World Order</a></em>.</p>
<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<h3 id="formation">Formation</h3>
<p>All four original members of Dru Hill were natives of <a href="Baltimore,_Maryland" title="wikilink">Baltimore, Maryland</a>. Mark Andrews and James Green met each other in <a href="middle_school" title="wikilink">middle school</a>, and both later became acquaintances of Tamir Ruffin when all three began pursuing careers in the music industry. Ruffin, nicknamed &quot;Nokio&quot; (an acronym for &quot;Nasty on Key in Octave&quot;) enlisted Andrews and Green (whose respective nicknames of &quot;Sisq&lt;U+00F3&gt;&quot; and &quot;Woody&quot; came from their childhood) to form a singing group. The trio added Larry &quot;Jazz&quot; Anthony, an <a href="opera" class="uri" title="wikilink">opera</a> student, to complete their lineup. The group was named &quot;Dru Hill&quot; after <a href="Druid_Hill_Park" title="wikilink">Druid Hill Park</a>, a popular park on the West side of Baltimore.</p>
<p>The quartet made a name for itself by getting jobs at a local <a href="fudge" class="uri" title="wikilink">fudge</a> factory, &quot;The Fudgery,&quot; at the <a href="Inner_Harbor" title="wikilink">Inner Harbor</a>, where they sang to entertain guests while making the candy. Most of their early repertoire was made up of <a href="gospel_music" title="wikilink">gospel music</a>; the group eventually switched to the more commercially viable genre of R&amp;B.</p>
<h3 id="big-break-and-dru-hill">Big break and <em>Dru Hill</em></h3>
<p><img src="Druhill-1996.jpg" title="fig:Dru Hill&#39;s 1996 eponymous debut, Dru Hill." alt="Dru Hill&#39;s 1996 eponymous debut, Dru Hill." width="200" /> Dru Hill's big break came in <a href="1996" class="uri" title="wikilink">1996</a>, when <a href="manager" class="uri" title="wikilink">manager</a> Haqq Islam arranged for them to perform at the Impact Convention in May. The group was signed to <a href="Island_Records" title="wikilink">Island Records</a>'s &quot;Island Black&quot; division shortly afterward through a production deal with Islam's University Music, and immediately began recording their debut album. The self-titled <em><a href="Dru_Hill_(album)" title="wikilink">Dru Hill</a></em> album was released on <a href="November_19" title="wikilink">November 19</a> <a href="1996" class="uri" title="wikilink">1996</a>, and became a <a href="RIAA_certification" title="wikilink">gold-selling</a> album. The group's first single, &quot;Tell Me&quot;, was featured on the soundtrack to the <a href="Whoopi_Goldberg" title="wikilink">Whoopi Goldberg</a> film <em>Eddie</em>, and was a Top 5 R&amp;B hit in the <a href="United_States" title="wikilink">United States</a>.</p>
<p>Stylistically, Dru Hill was the middle-ground between the smooth, gentlemen-like <a href="Boyz_II_Men" title="wikilink">Boyz II Men</a> and the self-proclaimed &quot;bad boys of R&amp;B&quot;, <a href="Jodeci" class="uri" title="wikilink">Jodeci</a>. Dru Hill received a lot of criticism, especially from the members of Jodeci, for what was perceived was a direct appropriation of Jodeci's style, particularly in frontman Sisq&lt;U+00F3&gt;'s <a href="K-Ci_Hailey" title="wikilink">K-Ci Hailey</a>-esque lead vocals. Other major influences for the group included <a href="Stevie_Wonder" title="wikilink">Stevie Wonder</a> and <a href="1980s" class="uri" title="wikilink">1980s</a> <a href="boy_band" title="wikilink">boy band</a> <a href="New_Edition" title="wikilink">New Edition</a>.</p>
<p>Both the group themselves and <a href="songwriter" title="wikilink">songwriters</a>/<a href="record_producer" title="wikilink">producers</a> such as Daryl Simmons and <a href="Keith_Sweat" title="wikilink">Keith Sweat</a> wrote the songs for the <em>Dru Hill</em> album, with the group themselves writing the single &quot;5 Steps&quot;. Nokio also did some co-production, and would become the group's main producer by <a href="1998" class="uri" title="wikilink">1998</a>.</p>
<p>All four members took turns singing lead, with Sisq&lt;U+00F3&gt; making the biggest impression on audiences with his dancing style, <a href="David_Ruffin" title="wikilink">David Ruffin</a>-styled emoting, and <a href="bleach" title="wikilink">bleached</a>-<a href="blond" class="uri" title="wikilink">blond</a> hair. The Sisq&lt;U+00F3&gt;-led &quot;In My Bed&quot; was the group's first Top 5 pop hit and first #1 R&amp;B hit. Jazz took the lead on the third single, &quot;Never Make a Promise&quot;, which became a second #1 R&amp;B hit. &quot;Never Make a Promise&quot;'s <a href="music_video" title="wikilink">music video</a> starred <a href="Michelle_Thomas" title="wikilink">Michelle Thomas</a> as Jazz's girlfriend, and was noted for its message against <a href="Sexual_abuse#Child_sexual_abuse" title="wikilink">child molestation</a>.</p>
<h3 id="soundtracks-protu00e9gu00e9s-and-controversy">Soundtracks, prot&lt;U+00E9&gt;g&lt;U+00E9&gt;s, and controversy</h3>
<p>Between their first and second albums, Dru Hill contributed &quot;We're Not Making Love No More&quot;, a #2 R&amp;B hit, to the <em><a href="Soul_Food_(film)" title="wikilink">Soul Food</a></em> soundtrack. &quot;We're Not Making Love No More&quot; was written and produced by star producer <a href="Babyface" class="uri" title="wikilink">Babyface</a>. Dru Hill and <a href="rapper" class="uri" title="wikilink">rapper</a> <a href="Foxy_Brown" title="wikilink">Foxy Brown</a> recorded &quot;Big Bad Mama&quot;, a remake of Carl Carlton's <a href="1981" class="uri" title="wikilink">1981</a> hit &quot;She's a Bad Mama Jama (She's Built, She's Stacked)&quot;, which was the main single for the soundtrack to the <a href="1998" class="uri" title="wikilink">1998</a> <a href="Bill_Bellamy" title="wikilink">Bill Bellamy</a> film <em><a href="Def_Jam&#39;s_How_to_Be_a_Player" title="wikilink">Def Jam's How to Be a Player</a></em>. The group was also instrumental in writing and producing for new University artist <a href="Mya_(singer)" title="wikilink">Mya</a>, whose first two singles &quot;It's All About Me&quot; and &quot;Movin' On&quot;, were co-written by Sisq&lt;U+00F3&gt;, who also performs guest vocals on &quot;It's All About Me&quot;.</p>
<p>In 1997, Dru Hill filed a lawsuit against Island Records, seeking a release from its contract, after an Island employee hit the group's manager, Keith Ingram, over the head with a <a href="pool_cue" title="wikilink">pool cue</a>. <a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> It was discovered that the employee in question, an <a href="African-American" class="uri" title="wikilink">African-American</a> man, had a criminal record. At an October 1997 deposition hearing, Eric Kronfeld, president and <a href="chief_operating_officer" title="wikilink">chief operating officer</a> of Island's parent company <a href="PolyGram" class="uri" title="wikilink">PolyGram</a>, was asked why he had hired such an individual. His response was that if he were not to hire African-Americans with criminal records, then &quot;there would be virtually no African-Americans employees in our society or in our industry.&quot;<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>Kronfield's remarks set off a wave of controversy when word of them reached the media in November. The Reverend <a href="Jesse_Jackson" title="wikilink">Jesse Jackson</a> became personally involved, publicly stating that PolyGram, based in <a href="The_Netherlands" title="wikilink">The Netherlands</a>, had &quot;a pattern of race and sex exclusion.&quot; <a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> Jackson met with PolyGram chairman Alain Levy and several other executives, who issued a public apology for Kronfield's statement, and replaced Kronfield as president with <a href="Motown_Records" title="wikilink">Motown Records</a>' chairman Clarence Avant.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> By the end of the month, Dru Hill had settled with Island Records, with the agreement that they would remain on the label. <a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="enter-the-dru"><em>Enter the Dru</em></h3>
<p><img src="Enterthedru-1998.jpg" title="fig:Dru Hill&#39;s second album, Enter the Dru." alt="Dru Hill&#39;s second album, Enter the Dru." width="200" /> Dru Hill's second Top 5 pop hit came in the form of <a href="1998" class="uri" title="wikilink">1998</a>'s &quot;How Deep is Your Love&quot;, a <a href="hip_hop_music" title="wikilink">hip hop</a> styled track which was included on the soundtrack to the <a href="Chris_Tucker" title="wikilink">Chris Tucker</a> film <em><a href="Rush_Hour_(movie)" title="wikilink">Rush Hour</a></em>. The single,&quot;This Is What We Do&quot; featuring a guest rap from <a href="Method_Man" title="wikilink">Method Man</a>, set the tone for the group's second LP, <em><a href="Enter_the_Dru" title="wikilink">Enter the Dru</a></em>. The album featured several other mid-tempo tracks in the vein of &quot;How Deep&quot;, as well as the R&amp;B Top 5 single &quot;These are the Times&quot;, co-written and co-produced by Babyface.</p>
<p><em>Enter the Dru</em> eventually sold two million copies by <a href="1999" class="uri" title="wikilink">1999</a>.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> That year, Dru Hill recorded a version of &quot;Enchantment Passing Through&quot; for the soundtrack to the <a href="Broadway_theatre" title="wikilink">Broadway</a> <a href="play" class="uri" title="wikilink">play</a> <em><a href="Aida" class="uri" title="wikilink">Aida</a></em>.</p>
<h3 id="the-dru-world-order-project">The Dru World Order project</h3>
<p>Among the press and the public, Sisq&lt;U+00F3&gt; was singled out as a de-facto solo act, and the other three members were regarded as sidemen. When Dru Hill made a high-profile guest appearance on <a href="Will_Smith" title="wikilink">Will Smith</a>'s #1 pop hit &quot;<a href="Wild_Wild_West_(hip_hop_song)" title="wikilink">Wild Wild West</a>&quot;, the lead single from the soundtrack to Smith's <a href="1999" class="uri" title="wikilink">1999</a> <a href="Wild_Wild_West" title="wikilink">film of the same name</a>, it made a star out of Sisq&lt;U+00F3&gt; alone. Both the song and its video prominently featured Sisq&lt;U+00F3&gt; alongside Smith, with the other three members relegated to the background.</p>
<p>During the &quot;Wild Wild West&quot; video shoot in April 1999, Woody quit the group, feeling a need to return to his gospel music roots. At first, Island decided to keep Dru Hill a trio, and shot a video for a hip-hop-styled remix of <em>Enter the Dru's</em> &quot;You are Everything&quot; with only Sisq&lt;U+00F3&gt;, Jazz, and Nokio, who performs a rap with Def Jam artist <a href="Ja_Rule" title="wikilink">Ja Rule</a>. Def Jam artist <a href="Case" class="uri" title="wikilink">Case</a> was subsequently enlisted to sing backgrounds on a remix of &quot;Beauty&quot; from <em>Enter the Dru</em>, whose video was shot but not released.</p>
<p>After Island merged with Def Jam to become <a href="The_Island_Def_Jam_Music_Group" title="wikilink">The Island Def Jam Music Group</a> in mid-1999, all four members, Woody included, signed new contracts with Def Jam's R&amp;B imprint <a href="Def_Jam" title="wikilink">Def Soul</a>, creating what was termed the &quot;Dru World Order&quot; project. Between November 1999 and November 2000, each member would release a solo album: Sisq&lt;U+00F3&gt; a <a href="pop_music" title="wikilink">pop</a> album, Jazz a traditional R&amp;B/soul album, Nokio a hip hop album, and Woody a gospel album. All four members would then reunite and record <em><a href="Dru_World_Order" title="wikilink">Dru World Order</a></em>, a new Dru Hill album to be released in November 2000.</p>
<p>Sisq&lt;U+00F3&gt; released his debut <em><a href="Unleash_the_Dragon" title="wikilink">Unleash the Dragon</a></em> LP, and had a minor hit with his first single, &quot;Got to Get It&quot;. His second single, a playful <a href="novelty_song" title="wikilink">novelty record</a> entitled &quot;<a href="Thong_Song" title="wikilink">Thong Song</a>&quot;, became a major hit during the spring of <a href="2000" class="uri" title="wikilink">2000</a>, and his third, &quot;<a href="Incomplete_(Sisq&lt;U+00F3&gt;_song)" title="wikilink">Incomplete</a>&quot;, became a number-one hit during the fall. As a result, the Dru World Order project schedule was continually pushed back, and, by November 2000, none of the other solo albums had been released.</p>
<p>In the early fall of 2000, Def Soul had Dru Hill re-enter the studio to record the <em>Dru World Order</em> album, and the song &quot;Without Me&quot; was chosen as the lead single. However, the time the group had spent apart created tension and conflict: Sisq&lt;U+00F3&gt; walked out of a November 2000 Dru Hill photo shoot for <em><a href="VIBE" class="uri" title="wikilink">VIBE</a></em> magazine, and the group broke apart completely shortly afterward.</p>
<p><em>Dru World Order</em> was placed on indefinite hold, and Sisq&lt;U+00F3&gt; began work on a second solo LP, <em><a href="Return_of_Dragon" title="wikilink">Return of Dragon</a></em>. &quot;Without You&quot; was issued as an album track on <em>Return of Dragon</em>, which performed below expectations after its June <a href="2001" class="uri" title="wikilink">2001</a> release. By the end of the year, Sisq&lt;U+00F3&gt; and Nokio had begun plans to reassemble Dru Hill, enlisting Baltimore associate <a href="Rufus_Waller" title="wikilink">Rufus Waller</a>, who performed under the name &quot;<a href="Scola" class="uri" title="wikilink">Scola</a>&quot;, as a fifth member.</p>
<h3 id="dru-world-order"><em>Dru World Order</em></h3>
<p><em>Dru World Order</em> was released on <a href="November_26" title="wikilink">November 26</a> <a href="2002" class="uri" title="wikilink">2002</a>, two years after its original planned release date. Nearly all of the album's tracks were produced by Nokio, who sung lead on the tracks &quot;She Said&quot; and &quot;Men Always Regret&quot;. Producers such as <a href="Bryan_Michael_Cox" title="wikilink">Bryan Michael Cox</a> and <a href="Kwam&lt;U+00E9&gt;" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kwam&lt;U+00E9&gt;</a> also made contributions. Most of the album's tracks featured Sisq&lt;U+00F3&gt;, Jazz, Woody, and Scola sharing the leads, including the lead single &quot;I Should Be...&quot;. &quot;I Should Be...&quot; was a Top 30 pop hit and a Top 10 R&amp;B hit, while its follow-up &quot;I Love You&quot; failed to make a strong impression.</p>
<h3 id="beyond-dru-world-order">Beyond <em>Dru World Order</em></h3>
<p>By <a href="2005" class="uri" title="wikilink">2005</a>, Dru Hill had been released from their Def Soul contract and had disappeared from public view. As of current, Sisq&lt;U+00F3&gt;, Jazz, and Scola have returned to their solo careers as independent artists, while also working on Dru Hill material with Nokio and Woody in the meantime. The group plans to release a Christmas album independently in late 2007.</p>
<p>Def Soul released a <a href="greatest_hits" title="wikilink">greatest hits</a> compilation, <em>Dru Hill: Hits</em>, on <a href="October_11" title="wikilink">October 11</a>, along with a corresponding <a href="DVD" class="uri" title="wikilink">DVD</a> collection of the group's music videos. Both collections included Sisq&lt;U+00F3&gt;'s biggest solo hits, &quot;Thong Song&quot; and &quot;Incomplete&quot; alongside the Dru Hill songs.</p>
<p>During the summer of 2007, Scola released a slow jam compilation CD entitled <em>Scola's Lost Treasures</em>. He is also working on a solo project called <em>From EA 2 Cali</em>, scheduled for release in fall 2007.</p>
