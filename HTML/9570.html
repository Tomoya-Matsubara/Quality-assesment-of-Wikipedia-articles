In contrast to the ballad-laden <em><a href="D&lt;U+00E9&gt;jame_Decir_Que_Te_Amo" title="wikilink">D&lt;U+00E9&gt;jame Decir Que Te Amo</a></em>, on the latter two albums Arjona experimented with a range of pop/rock styles. <em>Animal Nocturno</em> intersperses energetic rock songs among heartfelt ballads, and the <a href="instrumentation" class="uri" title="wikilink">instrumentation</a> is heavy on guitar, synthesizer, and drums.<a href="#fn173" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref173"><sup>173</sup></a> On <em>Historias</em>, each song is stylistically distinct and the instrumentation is varied. Around two dozen instruments were used on the album, including horns, piano and <a href="Hammond_B-3" title="wikilink">Hammond B-3</a>, and strings.<a href="#fn174" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref174"><sup>174</sup></a> On <em><a href="Si_El_Norte_Fuera_El_Sur" title="wikilink">Si El Norte Fuera El Sur</a></em>, he crafted a relatively low-key effort characterized by intimate songs about love, culture, and politics. Most of the songs were written in 1995 while Arjona was touring<a href="#fn175" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref175"><sup>175</sup></a> and are performed acoustically with <a href="Caribbean_music" title="wikilink">Caribbean</a> touches. Besides a couple of rockers, the songs are fairly even in tone and tempo.<a href="#fn176" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref176"><sup>176</sup></a></p>
<p>In <em><a href="Galer&lt;U+00ED&gt;a_Caribe" title="wikilink">Galer&lt;U+00ED&gt;a Caribe</a></em>, Arjona explored <a href="Afro-Caribbean_music" title="wikilink">Afro-Caribbean</a> sounds, employing traditional rhythms such as <a href="guaracha" class="uri" title="wikilink">guaracha</a>, <a href="Bachata_(music)" title="wikilink">bachata</a>, <a href="Merengue_music" title="wikilink">merengue</a>, and <a href="Salsa_music" title="wikilink">salsa</a>.<a href="#fn177" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref177"><sup>177</sup></a> On <em><a href="Santo_Pecado" title="wikilink">Santo Pecado</a></em>, Arjona explored the use of symphonic sounds on his ballads, amidst a couple of rock songs stylistically similar to those on <em><a href="Sin_Da&lt;U+00F1&gt;os_a_Terceros" title="wikilink">Sin Da&lt;U+00F1&gt;os a Terceros</a></em>.<a href="#fn178" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref178"><sup>178</sup></a> This album included the song &quot;La Nena (Bit&lt;U+00E1&gt;cora de un Secuetro)&quot;, in which Arjona relates the story of a girl who is kidnapped by her uncle.<a href="#fn179" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref179"><sup>179</sup></a> Then, in 2005, Arjona adopted new sounds in <em>Adentro</em>. Gutierrez considered the instrumentation, performance, and overall sonic palette to be &quot;minimalist&quot; and &quot;unassuming&quot;.<a href="#fn180" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref180"><sup>180</sup></a> On this album, Arjona included more Latin sounds, <a href="Mexican_music" title="wikilink">Mexican</a> and <a href="Tejano_music" title="wikilink">Tejano music</a> on &quot;Mojado&quot;,<a href="#fn181" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref181"><sup>181</sup></a> a song about immigration;<a href="#fn182" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref182"><sup>182</sup></a> <a href="Merengue_music" title="wikilink">merengue</a> and <a href="Colombian_music" title="wikilink">Colombian tones</a> on &quot;Adi&lt;U+00F3&gt;s Melancol&lt;U+00ED&gt;a&quot;, and some on &quot;No Te Cambio Por Nada&quot;.</p>
<p>On 2007's <em><a href="Qui&lt;U+00E9&gt;n_Dijo_Ayer" title="wikilink">Qui&lt;U+00E9&gt;n Dijo Ayer</a></em>, Arjona reworked past songs to fit a new style. For example, he gave &quot;Si El Norte Fuera El Sur&quot; a <a href="ska" class="uri" title="wikilink">ska</a> beat, and performed with the aid of <a href="Pante&lt;U+00F3&gt;n_Rococ&lt;U+00F3&gt;" title="wikilink">Pante&lt;U+00F3&gt;n Rococ&lt;U+00F3&gt;</a>.<a href="#fn183" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref183"><sup>183</sup></a> He transformed &quot;Historia de Taxi&quot; into a <a href="Salsa_music" title="wikilink">salsa song</a>, with the help of American singer <a href="Marc_Anthony" title="wikilink">Marc Anthony</a><a href="#fn184" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref184"><sup>184</sup></a> and pianist <a href="Sergio_George" title="wikilink">Sergio George</a>,<a href="#fn185" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref185"><sup>185</sup></a> who commented that &quot;It's been interesting to work with two figures from different music worlds on the interest of making good music.&quot;<a href="#fn186" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref186"><sup>186</sup></a> He further stated that &quot;every time a reunion of this kind happens, it's a reason to celebrate.&quot;<a href="#fn187" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref187"><sup>187</sup></a> Birchmeier commented, &quot;While only a couple of the new versions depart stylistically from the originals, the contemporary productions breathe new life into these songs.&quot;<a href="#fn188" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref188"><sup>188</sup></a> &quot;Realmente No Estoy Tan Solo&quot; was re-recorded with singer <a href="Sandro_de_Am&lt;U+00E9&gt;rica" title="wikilink">Sandro</a>. This turned out to be the last song recorded by the latter, who died 4 January 2010.<a href="#fn189" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref189"><sup>189</sup></a> This album included three new songs. The <a href="lead_single" title="wikilink">lead single</a>, &quot;Qui&lt;U+00E9&gt;n&quot; was written by Arjona and produced by himself and Torres.<a href="#fn190" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref190"><sup>190</sup></a> &quot;Quiero&quot; and &quot;Espantap&lt;U+00E1&gt;jaros&quot; are the other two new songs on the album.</p>
<p><img src="Paquita_la_del_Barrio.jpg" title="fig:Paquita la del Barrio sang along Arjona on ranchera &quot;Ni Tu Ni Yo&quot;." alt="Paquita la del Barrio sang along Arjona on ranchera &quot;Ni Tu Ni Yo&quot;." width="200" /> <em>5to Piso</em> is mainly driven by piano and <a href="String_instrument" title="wikilink">strings</a>.<a href="#fn191" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref191"><sup>191</sup></a> Exceptions are &quot;La Bailarina Vecina&quot;, crafted with pure <a href="Orchestration" title="wikilink">orchestral arrangements</a>; and &quot;Ni T&lt;U+00FA&gt; Ni Yo&quot;, a <a href="Ranchera" title="wikilink">ranchera style</a> song featuring <a href="Paquita_la_del_Barrio" title="wikilink">Paquita la del Barrio</a>.<a href="#fn192" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref192"><sup>192</sup></a> The album also includes a song called &quot;Que Nadie Vea&quot;, in which the artist sings about <a href="homosexuality" class="uri" title="wikilink">homosexuality</a>.<a href="#fn193" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref193"><sup>193</sup></a> On <em>5to Piso</em>, Arjona commented that he tried to recoup the freshness of his first albums, saying that he &quot;tried to reconcile a little with the Ricardo Arjona from the first albums to let out some of that freshness that makes so good to the songs.&quot;<a href="#fn194" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref194"><sup>194</sup></a></p>
<p><em><a href="Poquita_Ropa" title="wikilink">Poquita Ropa</a></em> offered a drastic change in which Arjona minimized the number of instruments. The result was a set of <a href="a_capella" title="wikilink">a capella</a> performances. Arjona commented about this album that &quot;music and women look better with little clothes.&quot;<a href="#fn195" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref195"><sup>195</sup></a> Production was handled by Arjona and Dan Warner, who also worked with <a href="Shakira" class="uri" title="wikilink">Shakira</a>, <a href="Celine_Dion" title="wikilink">Celine Dion</a> and <a href="Christina_Aguilera" title="wikilink">Christina Aguilera</a>.<a href="#fn196" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref196"><sup>196</sup></a> Birchmeier gave the album a somewhat positive review, saying that it was a &quot;stripped-down acoustic effort&quot;, considering it &quot;impressive&quot;.<a href="#fn197" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref197"><sup>197</sup></a> He also commented that <em>Poquita Ropa</em> &quot;finds Arjona at his most naked, backed by spare <a href="Musical_arrangements" title="wikilink">arrangements</a> of <a href="acoustic_guitar" title="wikilink">acoustic guitar</a>, piano, and <a href="Hammond_B-3" title="wikilink">Hammond B-3</a> along with occasional touches of <a href="String_instrument" title="wikilink">strings</a>, <a href="woodwinds" class="uri" title="wikilink">woodwinds</a>, and chorus vocals.&quot;<a href="#fn198" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref198"><sup>198</sup></a></p>

<p>&quot;Puente&quot;, the lead single, is the only notable exception. It lasts eight and a half minutes and is divided in three parts. The first is sung mainly with a piano. The second part is a ballad with <a href="Caribbean_music" title="wikilink">Caribbean</a> and <a href="Latin_music" title="wikilink">Latin sounds</a>, with some <a href="Salsa_music" title="wikilink">salsa</a> and <a href="Cuban_music" title="wikilink">Cuban influences</a>.<a href="#fn199" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref199"><sup>199</sup></a> The third mixes salsa and <a href="Merengue_music" title="wikilink">merengue</a>, with Cuban influences. &quot;Puente&quot; resembles Arjona's work on <em><a href="Galer&lt;U+00ED&gt;a_Caribe" title="wikilink">Galer&lt;U+00ED&gt;a Caribe</a></em>.<a href="#fn200" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref200"><sup>200</sup></a> This album was the first since <em><a href="Adentro" class="uri" title="wikilink">Adentro</a></em>, that Arjona worked without Torres.</p>
<p>In <em><a href="Independiente_(Ricardo_Arjona_album)" title="wikilink">Independiente</a></em>, Arjona returned to his trademark sound, which Torres helped craft. David Feffries of Allmusic gave the album a somewhat positive review. He compared the production values and musical style of <em>Independiente</em> with those of past albums <em>Animal Nocturno</em> and <em>Historias</em>, stating, &quot;Returning fans will revel in this combination of freedom and growth, and appreciate the return of producer Tommy Torres, the man who has been behind the boards for quite a few of Arjona's most popular releases&quot;, referring precisely to the absence of Torres in the production of <em>Poquita Ropa</em>.<a href="#fn201" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref201"><sup>201</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="collaborators">Collaborators</h3>
<p>Only longtime collaborators Dan Warner and Tommy Torres provided notable <a href="background_vocals" title="wikilink">background vocals</a> where needed.
