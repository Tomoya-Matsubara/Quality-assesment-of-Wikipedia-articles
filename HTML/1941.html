<p><strong>Walter de Lacy</strong> (died 27 March 1085) was a Norman nobleman who came to England after the <a href="Norman_conquest_of_England" title="wikilink">Norman Conquest of England</a> in 1066. He received lands in Herefordshire and Shropshire, and served King <a href="William_the_Conqueror" title="wikilink">William I of England</a> by leading military forces during 1075. He died in 1085 and one son inherited his lands. Another son became an <a href="abbot" class="uri" title="wikilink">abbot</a>.</p>
<h2 id="early-life">Early life</h2>
<p>Walter was originally from <a href="Lassy,_Calvados" title="wikilink">Lassy</a>, in Normandy. He had a brother, <a href="Ilbert_de_Lacy" title="wikilink">Ilbert de Lacy</a>.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> Ilbert was the ancestor of the <a href="de_Lacy" title="wikilink">de Lacy</a> family of <a href="Pontefract" class="uri" title="wikilink">Pontefract</a>. Both Walter and Ilbert jointly held the Norman lands that were held of the <a href="Bishop_of_Bayeux" title="wikilink">Bishop of Bayeux</a>.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="career-in-england">Career in England</h2>
<p>Walter was given the lordship of <a href="Weobley" class="uri" title="wikilink">Weobley</a> in Herefordshire after the Conquest.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> He is already attested in the <a href="Welsh_Marches" title="wikilink">Welsh Marches</a> by 1069,<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> when he is recorded stopping a Welsh attack and then raiding into Wales in retribution.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> Walter and Ilbert may have come to England in the household of <a href="Odo_of_Bayeux" title="wikilink">Odo of Bayeux</a>, the Bishop of Bayeux and half-brother of King <a href="William_the_Conqueror" title="wikilink">William the Conqueror</a>.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> Although some historians, such as W. E. Wrightman, have argued that Walter was a follower of <a href="William_fitzOsbern" title="wikilink">William fitzOsbern</a>,<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> others, including C. P. Lewis and K. S. B. Keats-Rohan, have argued that Walter was an independent agent in England.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a><a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> By the time of Walter's death, he held a block of lands in Herefordshire along the border with Wales. Another group of lands was centered on <a href="Ludlow" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ludlow</a> in Shropshire. These two groupings of lands allowed Walter to help defend the border of England against Welsh raids. Walter also had other lands in Berkshire, Gloucestershire, Worcestershire, and Oxfordshire. Walter kept a large number of his manors in <a href="demesne" class="uri" title="wikilink">demesne</a>, managing them directly rather than giving them as fiefs to his knightly followers.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> Some of these lands in Hereford, including <a href="Holme_Lacy" title="wikilink">Holme Lacy</a>, were held of the <a href="Bishop_of_Hereford" title="wikilink">Bishop of Hereford</a> through <a href="fief" title="wikilink">feudal tenure</a>.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> In total, <em><a href="Domesday_Book" title="wikilink">Domesday Book</a></em> records Walter's lands as being worth &lt;U+20A4&gt;423 in income per year and as comprising 163 manors in 7 different counties.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> He was one of 21 individuals with land valued at more than &lt;U+20A4&gt;400 at the time of the survey.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1075, Walter was one of the leaders of the force that prevented <a href="Roger_de_Breteuil" title="wikilink">Roger de Breteuil</a> from joining up with the other rebels during the <a href="Revolt_of_the_Earls" title="wikilink">Revolt of the Earls</a>. Walter had joined forces with <a href="Wulfstan_(died_1095)" title="wikilink">Wulfstan</a> the <a href="Bishop_of_Worcester" title="wikilink">Bishop of Worcester</a>, <a href="&lt;U+00C6&gt;thelwig" class="uri" title="wikilink">&lt;U+00C6&gt;thelwig</a> the <a href="Abbot_of_Evesham" title="wikilink">Abbot of Evesham Abbey</a>, and <a href="Urse_d&#39;Abetot" title="wikilink">Urse d'Abetot</a> the <a href="High_Sheriff_of_Worcestershire" title="wikilink">Sheriff of Worcester</a>.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="family-and-death">Family and death</h2>
<p>Walter married Emma or Emmelina and they had three sons &lt;U+2013&gt; <a href="Roger_de_Lacy" title="wikilink">Roger</a>, Hugh and Walter. Roger was the heir to Weobley and Walter became <a href="Abbot_of_Gloucester" title="wikilink">Abbot</a> of <a href="Gloucester_Abbey" title="wikilink">Gloucester Abbey</a>.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> Occasionally the elder Walter is claimed to have married twice &lt;U+2013&gt; once to Emma and once to an Ermeline, but this is probably a confusion of the variations of Emma's name. Walter and Emma also had a daughter who became a nun at <a href="St_Mary&#39;s_Abbey,_Winchester" title="wikilink">St Mary's Abbey, Winchester</a>. A niece was married to Ansfrid de Cormeilles.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> Considerable confusion exists about Sybil, the wife of <a href="Pain_fitzJohn" title="wikilink">Pain fitzJohn</a>. C. P. Lewis names her as the daughter of Walter,<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> but W. E. Wrightman calls her the daughter of Hugh, Walter's son.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> Yet another pedigree has her as the daughter of Agnes, the daughter of Walter. In this rendition, favoured by Bruce Coplestone-Crow, Agnes was married to Geoffrey Talbot.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a></p>
<p>The elder Walter died on 27 March 1085,<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> falling off some scaffolding at <a href="Saint_Guthlac&#39;s_Priory" title="wikilink">Saint Guthlac's Priory</a> when he was inspecting the progress of the building at that monastery.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> He was buried in the <a href="chapter_house" title="wikilink">chapter house</a> at Gloucester Abbey.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> He was a benefactor to Gloucester Abbey,<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> as well as Saint Guthlac's.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a></p>
