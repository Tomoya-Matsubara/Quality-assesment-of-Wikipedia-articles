<p>Built across the <a href="Boyne_River" title="wikilink">Boyne River</a> south west of Gladstone, the Awoonga Dam is a rockfill structure with a concrete upstream face slab. The embankment was formed from rock excavated from a quarry on the eastern side of the dam wall. The embankment is over 650 metres in length and 54.4 metres in height, with a volume of approximately 2 million cubic metres of rock. The spillway&lt;U+2019&gt;s height is 40 metres AHD. This design of the current dam allows for further raising, if necessary, through the addition of gates to the top of the spillway. The current capacity of the dam is 777,000 megalitres.</p>

<p>The Gladstone Area Water Board has a <a href="http://www.gawb.qld.gov.au/hatchery.html">fish breeding program</a> in place and breeds Barramundi, <a href="Mangrove_red_snapper" title="wikilink">Mangrove Jack</a> and <a href="Mullet" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mullet</a> for stocking into <a href="http://www.gawb.qld.gov.au/faqs.html">Lake Awoonga</a>as well as some of the surrounding waterways.

The <a href="http://www.gawb.qld.gov.au/hatchery.html">hatchery</a> is one of the largest breeders of barramundi fingerlings in Queensland and their mangrove jack breeding program has resulted in <a href="http://www.gawb.qld.gov.au/hatchery.html">Lake Awoonga</a> holding the largest stocks in Australia with over 13,000 released. <a href="http://www.gawb.qld.gov.au/hatchery.html">Lake Awoonga</a> fish include Agassiz's Glass Perch, Banded Grunter, Barramundi, Bony Bream, <a href="Rainbowfish" title="wikilink">Eastern Rainbowfish</a>, <a href="Eeltail_catfish" title="wikilink">Eeltail catfish</a>, Fly-specked Hardyhead, Forktail Catfish, <a href="Gudgeon" class="uri" title="wikilink">Gudgeon</a>, Long-finned Eel, <a href="Alligator_gar" title="wikilink">Longtom</a>, Mouth Almighty, Sea Mullet, Snub-nose Garfish, Spangled Perch.

Barramundi in the 10-25kg range are regularly caught from the lake The <a href="http://www.gawb.qld.gov.au">Gladstone Area Water Board</a> has a continuing fishery monitoring program in place using net surveys, to evaluate the success of the restocking effort. Although not deliberately stocked, redclaw crayfish have become well established at the lake. <strong><em>Images of vulnerable species found in the region:</em></strong></p>
