<p>The roster of characters that players can control in <em>Brawl</em> has grown from that of <em><a href="Super_Smash_Bros._Melee" title="wikilink">Super Smash Bros. Melee</a></em>; <em>Brawl</em> is the first game in the series to expand past Nintendo characters and allow players control of <a href="third-party_developer" title="wikilink">third-party</a> characters.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> Like its predecessors, the object of <em>Brawl</em> is to knock an opponent off the screen. It is a departure from traditional fighting games, notably in its simplified move commands and emphasis on <a href="Fighting_game#Ring-out" title="wikilink">ring outs</a> over <a href="Fighting_game#Knockout_(K.O.)" title="wikilink">knockouts</a>. It includes a more extensive <a href="single-player" class="uri" title="wikilink">single-player</a> mode than its predecessors, known as The Subspace Emissary (SSE). This mode is a plot-driven, <a href="Side-scrolling_video_game" title="wikilink">side-scrolling</a> <a href="beat_&#39;em_up" title="wikilink">beat 'em up</a> featuring computer-generated <a href="cut_scene" title="wikilink">cut scenes</a> and playable characters from the game. <em>Brawl</em> also supports <a href="multiplayer_game" title="wikilink">multiplayer</a> battles with up to four combatants, and is the first game of its franchise to feature online battles via the <a href="Nintendo_Wi-Fi_Connection" title="wikilink">Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection</a>.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<p>The game was met with generally positive reviews,<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> with critics praising the game's entertainment value, despite issues relating to <em>Brawl</em>{{'}}s loading times and graphics.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> The game's <a href="musical_score" title="wikilink">musical score</a>, which was composed through a collaboration among 38 renowned <a href="List_of_video_game_musicians" title="wikilink">video game composers</a>,<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> was lauded for its representation of different generations in gaming history.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> <em>Brawl</em> received an aggregate review score of 94% on <a href="Metacritic" class="uri" title="wikilink">Metacritic</a><a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> and 93.3% on <a href="Game_Rankings" title="wikilink">Game Rankings</a>.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> It has sold a total of 4.85 million units as of <a href="March_31" title="wikilink">March 31</a> <a href="2008" class="uri" title="wikilink">2008</a>.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="gameplay">Gameplay</h2>

<p><img src="SSBB_Gameplay.jpg" title="fig:A match between Mario, Kirby, Bowser, and King Dedede. The damage meter now displays the name, image, and series symbol of the character." alt="A match between Mario, Kirby, Bowser, and King Dedede. The damage meter now displays the name, image, and series symbol of the character." width="250" /> Following its predecessors, <em>Brawl</em> uses a battle system unlike that of typical fighting games. Players can choose from a large selection of characters, each attempting to knock their opponents off the screen as they fight on various stages. Instead of using traditional <a href="Health_(game_mechanic)" title="wikilink">health bars</a> that start at 100% and lose value, <em>Brawl</em> characters start the game with 0% and the value rises as they take damage.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> As a character's percentage increases, the character flies farther back when hit. When a character is knocked beyond a stage's boundary and disappears from the screen, the character loses either a <a href="Life_bar#Icon-based_health" title="wikilink">life</a> or a point depending on the mode of play.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> <em>Brawl</em> includes a function which allows players to create profiles with personalized button configurations for each control method along with their chosen username.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a></p>
<p>The characters fight each other using a variety of attacks. Players execute each move by pressing a button in conjunction with a tilt of the <a href="analog_stick" title="wikilink">control stick</a> or a press of the <a href="D-pad" class="uri" title="wikilink">D-pad</a>, depending on the mode of control. In addition to basic attacks, characters have access to more powerful moves, known as smash attacks. Each character has four unique moves, which often cause effects besides damage to an opponent. <em>Brawl</em> introduces the ability to perform character-specific <a href="Super_(fighting_games)" title="wikilink">super attacks</a>, referred to as &quot;Final Smash&quot; moves. Significantly more powerful than regular attacks, these moves have a wide variety of effects that range from nearly unavoidable blasts to temporary transformations. Final Smash moves may be performed upon destroying a Smash Ball, an item bearing the <em>Smash Bros.</em> logo.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a><a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a></p>
<p>Characters can use items ranging from projectiles to melee weapons; each has a different effect on the characters around it. Although many items have returned from previous <em>Super Smash Bros.</em> games, new ones have been introduced as well. Some returning items have changed appearance and function.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> Two varieties of items, Assist Trophies<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> and <a href="Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;_Ball" title="wikilink">Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt; Balls</a>,<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> temporarily summon guest characters and <a href="Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon" class="uri" title="wikilink">Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon</a>, respectively, that aid the summoner. They cannot be controlled by players and are usually invincible.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="group">Group</h3>
<p>In addition to the standard multiplayer mode, <em>Brawl</em> features other multiplayer modes and options in Group mode. Special Melee from the <a href="Super_Smash_Bros._Melee" title="wikilink">previous game</a> returns as Special Brawl. In this mode, players are able to battle in matches using special rules for a greater level of customization. Whereas previously standard options such as <em>Giant Melee</em> or <em>Invisible Melee</em> were limited to one feature per match, players may now select multiple options for a single match.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> Another returning game type, Tourney mode (formerly Tournament mode), enables players to create an <a href="Single-elimination_tournament" title="wikilink">elimination-based tournament</a> with a large number of game-controlled or human-controlled opponents.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> The <em>Rotation</em> feature has been introduced in <em>Brawl</em>, which allows up to 16 players to compete in sequence by switching out winners or losers after each round.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="solo">Solo</h3>
<p>Like its predecessors, <em>Super Smash Bros. Brawl</em> includes various modes of play from the previous game designed for a single player. Classic mode, as the name implies, is a classical approach to the game, in which players fight individual characters in a selected order. Each match features an arena or opponent from a particular series, such as <em><a href="The_Legend_of_Zelda_(series)" title="wikilink">The Legend of Zelda</a></em> or <em><a href="Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon_video_game_series" title="wikilink">Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon</a></em>. Several matches have a unique battle condition, such as a metal opponent or a two-on-two team battle.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> Similar to Classic mode are All Star mode and Boss Battles, where the player has only one <a href="Life_bar#Icon-based_health" title="wikilink">life</a> to defeat all of the playable characters and bosses, respectively.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a><a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a></p>
<p><em>Brawl</em> features Events, which are matches with predetermined battle conditions such as defeating opponents within a time limit or reaching a specific goal. New to single-player mode, each of the 62 Events has three difficulty levels, with a distinct high score recorded for each.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> In addition to the normal set of 41 Events played with a single player, a smaller set of 21 two-player Events is included.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a></p>
<p>Stadium mode is a collection of objective-oriented minigames, or small games within the game. Returning from the two previous games is the <em>Target Smash!</em> minigame, in which the player must break 10 targets as quickly as possible. Additionally, items scattered across the stage are available for use.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> In the Home-Run Contest, the player must beat <a href="Super_Smash_Bros._(series)#Other_characters" title="wikilink">Sandbag</a> to inflict as much damage as possible in 10 seconds, then strike it with a <a href="Baseball_bat" title="wikilink">Home-Run Bat</a>. Updated from <em>Melee</em>, all Stadium mode minigames feature cooperative or competitive multiplayer.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a><a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a></p>

<h4 id="adventure-mode-the-subspace-emissary">Adventure Mode: The Subspace Emissary</h4>
<p><em>Super Smash Bros. Brawl</em> features a new Adventure mode titled &quot;The Subspace Emissary&quot; (SSE). This mode features unique character storylines along with numerous <a href="Side-scrolling_video_game" title="wikilink">side-scrolling</a> levels and multiple <a href="Boss_(video_games)" title="wikilink">bosses</a> to fight, as well as <a href="cut_scene" title="wikilink">cut scenes</a> explaining the storyline. SSE introduces a group of antagonists called the Subspace Army, who are led by the Ancient Minister. Some of these enemy characters appeared in previous Nintendo video games, such as <a href="List_of_Mario_series_characters#Petey_Piranha" title="wikilink">Petey Piranha</a> from the <a href="Mario_(series)" title="wikilink"><em>Mario</em> series</a> and a squadron of <a href="R.O.B." title="wikilink">R.O.B.s</a> based on classic Nintendo hardware. SSE boasts a number of original enemies, such as the Roader, a robotic unicycle; the Bytan, a one-eyed, ball-like creature which can replicate itself if left alone; and the Primid, enemies that fight with a variety of weapons.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> Though the game is primarily played as a single-player mode, cooperative multiplayer is available. This mode features a mechanism which strengthens the selected character's abilities. They are in the form of collectible stickers that can be applied to the base of the player's character trophies.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a></p>
<p>Unlike other game modes, SSE has a team system for the characters, with a limited choice of characters at the beginning of the mode. Others join the team as the game progresses, while some characters may leave the team temporarily.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> Most characters start off with their own teams, but the teams merge occasionally until they become a unified team by the end of the game. In cooperative multi-player, once one player loses a life, your ally can take his or her place until the number of lives run out.</p>
<p>The game's director, Masahiro Sakurai, claimed that this mode would be more &quot;fleshed out&quot; than the single-player modes in previous <em>Smash Bros.</em> titles.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> <a href="Shigeru_Miyamoto" title="wikilink">Shigeru Miyamoto</a> has explained that Sakurai always wanted to have a deep single-player game, but he wanted Sakurai to focus more on the multiplayer aspects in the previous titles since there were already many single-player games of this kind. Both were possible with the development time allotted for <em>Brawl</em>.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> To construct a plotline for the mode, Sakurai enlisted the help of <a href="Kazushige_Nojima" title="wikilink">Kazushige Nojima</a>, a scenario writer known for his work on the <a href="Final_Fantasy" title="wikilink"><em>Final Fantasy</em> series</a>.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a></p>
<h5 id="plot">Plot</h5>
<p>The mode begins as <a href="Mario" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mario</a> and <a href="Kirby_(Nintendo)" title="wikilink">Kirby</a> fight on a stadium located in the <em>Smash Bros.</em> world. The Ancient Minister and his Subspace Army appear and detonate a Subspace Bomb, which transports the stadium into Subspace, an alternate dimension where the Subspace Army resides. The Ancient Minister's advance prompts the heroes to team up and attempt to repel the enemy, while villains harvest the power of the allied characters by converting them into trophies.</p>
<p>The Ancient Minister is revealed as a subordinate to <a href="Ganon" title="wikilink">Ganondorf</a>, who is under orders from <a href="Super_Smash_Bros._(series)#Bosses" title="wikilink">Master Hand</a> to draw the world into Subspace. The Ancient Minister's true identity is found to be that of the Master <a href="R.O.B." title="wikilink">R.O.B. unit</a>, who rebels against his superiors to join the allied characters. The allied heroes enter Subspace, where they find that R.O.B., Ganondorf, and even Master Hand were all being manipulated by a higher being, known only as <em>Tabuu</em>. Tabuu releases a power blast which transforms all the protagonists into trophies; although a select few (<a href="Luigi" class="uri" title="wikilink">Luigi</a> and <a href="List_of_EarthBound_characters#Ness" title="wikilink">Ness</a>) are revived by brooches that were attached to them by <a href="List_of_Kirby_characters#King_Dedede" title="wikilink">King Dedede</a> earlier in the story. They work together to revive the other characters scattered across Subspace and make their way through a great maze where Tabuu is located. Following an ambush by <a href="Sonic_the_Hedgehog_(character)" title="wikilink">Sonic the Hedgehog</a>, the allies ultimately defeat Tabuu and save the <em>Smash Bros.</em> universe.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="nintendo-wi-fi-connection">Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection</h3>
<p><em>Brawl</em> allows players to play against distant opponents via the <a href="Nintendo_Wi-Fi_Connection" title="wikilink">Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection</a>.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> Online multiplayer games can be played either with registered friends or with randomly selected participants. Additionally, players can converse with up to four phrases that are preset by the player, which appear as speech bubbles when activated. These names and phrases are not displayed in random-player matches. The Spectator mode allows players to watch matches being played between other players, and bet on the outcome using coins earned within the game. The winner of the match earns a jackpot of coins.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a></p>
<p>Snapshots may be taken during battles or in certain other modes, which can later be sent to friends or submitted to Nintendo.<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> Video replay footage can be captured in specific game modes, including Brawl and Target Smash! modes, and sent to friends in the same manner.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="vault">Vault</h3>
<p>Returning from <em>Melee</em> are trophies, statuettes of video game characters and objects that give brief histories or descriptions of their subjects.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a> A minigame, the Coin Launcher, replaces the lottery machine from <em>Melee</em> as the primary method of obtaining trophies. The Coin Launcher is a machine that uses coins as projectiles to shoot trophies and counter incoming dangers such as missiles.<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a> Coins can also be used to bet on the victor of online battles via Spectator mode.<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a> Trophies unavailable in Coin Launcher mode are obtained by using an item called the Trophy Stand on weakened enemy characters and bosses within The Subspace Emissary. Trophies obtained in this manner may contain information on the backstory of the Subspace Emissary.<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a></p>
<p>In addition to trophies, players can now collect stickers of video game artwork.<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a> Players can place stickers and trophies onto virtual backgrounds and record snapshots, which can be sent to other players via Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection.<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a><a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a> Stickers can be applied to characters to power up their abilities during the Subspace Emissary.<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a></p>
<p>Other stickers or trophies which cannot be collected through the Coin Launcher minigame, Subspace Emissary, or Vs. matches can be unlocked from the Challenges menu, an interactive display which catalogs unlocked features and items in gridded windows. Once a window has been broken and its contents are unlocked, horizontally adjacent windows display the conditions necessary to unlock them.<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a></p>
<p><em>Brawl</em> contains demo versions of classic Nintendo titles, known as Masterpieces, allowing players to experience defining moments of the characters' pasts such as <a href="Link_(The_Legend_of_Zelda)" title="wikilink">Link</a>'s major success story in <em><a href="The_Legend_of_Zelda:_Ocarina_of_Time" title="wikilink">The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time</a></em>.<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a> These titles use <a href="Virtual_Console" title="wikilink">Virtual Console</a> technology to emulate classic hardware. The demos have time constraints ranging from thirty seconds to five minutes, and some use save data to allow the player to play a certain scenario or level.<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a> Along with the Masterpieces comes the inclusion of the Chronicles section, a library of previous Nintendo titles which lists games either made or published by Nintendo on all of its systems. New titles will appear when certain characters, trophies, or stickers related to the game are unlocked.<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a></p>

<p><a href="Image:SSBB_Opening_Sprites.png" title="wikilink">left |thumb|250px|The final list of playable characters consists of 35 <a href="Nintendo" class="uri" title="wikilink">Nintendo</a> and <a href="Third-party_developer" title="wikilink">third-party</a> mascots.</a> <em>Brawl</em> allows the player to select between 35 characters. Some can transform into alternate forms, with different move sets and play styles. Some are new, but others return from <em>Melee</em>—in some cases updated or refined, either in appearance, fighting capabilities, or both. For example, <a href="Link_(The_Legend_of_Zelda)" title="wikilink">Link</a> and <a href="Fox_McCloud" title="wikilink">Fox</a> have adopted designs from more recent titles, while <a href="Samus_Aran" title="wikilink">Samus</a> has gained the ability to change into a new form, <a href="Samus_Aran#Suitless/Zero_Suit_Samus" title="wikilink">Zero Suit Samus</a>.</p>
<p>Some previously represented series have had more characters added to <em>Brawl</em>. <a href="Diddy_Kong" title="wikilink">Diddy Kong</a> from the <em><a href="Donkey_Kong_(series)" title="wikilink">Donkey Kong</a></em> series and <a href="List_of_characters_in_Fire_Emblem:_Path_of_Radiance#Ike" title="wikilink">Ike</a> from the <em><a href="Fire_Emblem" title="wikilink">Fire Emblem</a></em> series make their first appearance in the <em>Smash Bros.</em> series. Other newcomers are the first to represent their series. These include characters such as <a href="Pit_(Kid_Icarus)" title="wikilink">Pit</a>, representing the <em><a href="Kid_Icarus_(series)" title="wikilink">Kid Icarus</a></em> series for the first time since the 1991 <a href="Game_Boy" title="wikilink">Game Boy</a> game <em><a href="Kid_Icarus:_Of_Myths_and_Monsters" title="wikilink">Kid Icarus: Of Myths and Monsters</a></em>, and <a href="Wario" class="uri" title="wikilink">Wario</a>, from Nintendo's <em><a href="WarioWare_(series)" title="wikilink">WarioWare</a></em> series and an occasional antagonist of Mario's. <a href="Solid_Snake" title="wikilink">Solid Snake</a>, the main protagonist of <a href="Konami" class="uri" title="wikilink">Konami</a>'s <em><a href="Metal_Gear_(series)" title="wikilink">Metal Gear</a></em> franchise, and <a href="Sonic_the_Hedgehog_(character)" title="wikilink">Sonic the Hedgehog</a> from Nintendo's former rival <a href="Sega" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sega</a> are the first third-party characters to appear in a <em>Super Smash Bros.</em> game.</p>
<h2 id="stages">Stages</h2>
<p><em>Brawl</em>{{'}}s stages are generally based on plot devices from the various game series of <em>Super Smash Bros.</em> Stages range from floating platforms to moving areas where the characters must stay within the field of play. Each stage has a boundary that cannot be passed, or the character will be <em>KO'd</em>, thus losing a life or a <em>point</em>, depending on the mode of play.</p>
<p><em>Brawl</em> contains 41 selectable stages, only 29 of which are initially available. Many stages undergo elaborate changes while battles take place, such as a cycling day-to-night system<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a> and changing seasons.<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a> A stage based on the <a href="Animal_Crossing_(series)" title="wikilink"><em>Animal Crossing</em></a> series features a live events system in which special events may occur depending on the date and time.<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a> Environmental gameplay mechanics are featured in this installment, such as <a href="destructible_environment" title="wikilink">destructible terrain</a> and the ability to float. Unlike its predecessors, <em>Brawl</em> includes stages based on third-party games such as the <em><a href="Metal_Gear_Solid" title="wikilink">Metal Gear Solid</a></em>-inspired Shadow Moses Island.<a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a> The game also includes stages taken from its predecessor.<a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a></p>
<p><em>Brawl</em> allows players to create their own stages using a several options in a mode called Stage Builder. Players can save their stages to an <a href="Secure_Digital_card" title="wikilink">SD card</a> or to the internal memory of the Wii console. Through Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection, players can submit their creations to their friends, or to Nintendo to receive a daily stage from the service.<a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="development">Development</h2>
<p>At the pre-E3 2005 press conference, Nintendo president <a href="Satoru_Iwata" title="wikilink">Satoru Iwata</a> announced that the next installment of <em>Super Smash Bros.</em> was soon to be in development for their next console and would hopefully be a launch title with Wi-Fi compatibility for online play.<a href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a> The announcement was a surprise to Sakurai, who left <a href="HAL_Laboratory" title="wikilink">HAL Laboratory</a> in 2003. He was not informed of Nintendo's intent to release another <em>Smash</em> title, despite the fact that Iwata told Sakurai shortly after his resignation from HAL that if a new <em>Smash</em> game was to be developed, he would want Sakurai to again serve as director. It was not until after the conference that Iwata requested that Sakurai hold a private meeting with him, where he was asked to be involved as <em>Brawl</em>{{'}}s director.<a href="#fn67" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a> Sakurai agreed to become director, and development of the game began in October 2005,<a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a> when Nintendo opened a new office in Tokyo just for its production. Nintendo enlisted outside help from various developer studios, including <a href="Game_Arts" title="wikilink">Game Arts</a>. The new development team had spent excessive amounts of time playing <em>Super Smash Bros. Melee</em>, and were given access to all the original material and tools from the development of <em>Melee</em>, courtesy of HAL Laboratory. In addition, several <em>Smash Bros.</em> staff members that reside in the area of the new office joined the project's development.<a href="#fn69" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref69"><sup>69</sup></a><a href="#fn70" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a></p>
<p>The game was absent from Nintendo's Wii showing at its 2006 Pre-E3 press conference. The next day, on Wednesday, <a href="May_10" title="wikilink">May 10</a>, <a href="2006" class="uri" title="wikilink">2006</a>, its first official trailer was unveiled at <a href="E3_Media_and_Business_Summit" title="wikilink">E3</a> and at the After-Hours Press Conference, Nintendo officially revealed the game under the name of <em>Super Smash Bros. Brawl</em>. In an interview with IGN, Sakurai said the Wii's motion sensing features might not be included because &quot;[his team] found that trying to implement too much motion-sensory functionality can get in the way of the game&quot;.<a href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a> As far as <a href="Nintendo_Wi-Fi_Connection" title="wikilink">Wi-Fi</a> play is concerned, Sakurai stated his plan was to include Wi-Fi connection compatibility from the start. He goes on to say, &quot;One of the primary reasons <em>Super Smash Bros. Brawl</em> was created was that Nintendo, when taking Wii online, wanted to have <em>Smash Bros.</em> to do that.&quot;<a href="#fn72" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref72"><sup>72</sup></a> However, Sakurai stated on the Japanese version of the <em>Smash Bros.</em> website that there were &quot;hurdles of all sorts that [made] it very difficult&quot; to implement online battles.<a href="#fn73" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref73"><sup>73</sup></a> Furthermore, he said that an online ranking system is unlikely to be implemented.<a href="#fn74" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref74"><sup>74</sup></a> During a test play between Sakurai and <a href="Hideo_Kojima" title="wikilink">Hideo Kojima</a>, Kojima stated that the game felt complete and that Nintendo &quot;could put it out now and it would sell millions of copies&quot;.<a href="#fn75" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref75"><sup>75</sup></a> Starting <a href="May_22" title="wikilink">May 22</a>, <a href="2007" class="uri" title="wikilink">2007</a> and ending <a href="April_14" title="wikilink">April 14</a>, <a href="2008" class="uri" title="wikilink">2008</a>, the site had daily weekday updates.</p>
<p>At the Nintendo Media Conference at <a href="History_of_E3#2007" title="wikilink">E3 2007</a>, Nintendo of America president <a href="Reggie_Fils-Aime" title="wikilink">Reggie Fils-Aime</a> announced that <em>Super Smash Bros.
