<p><strong>Catherine de' Medici</strong> (13 April 1519 &lt;U+2013&gt; 5 January 1589) was born in <a href="Florence" class="uri" title="wikilink">Florence</a>, <a href="Italy" class="uri" title="wikilink">Italy</a>, as <strong>Caterina Maria Romula di Lorenzo de' Medici</strong>.</p>
<p>Both her parents, <a href="Lorenzo_II_de&#39;_Medici,_Duke_of_Urbino" title="wikilink">Lorenzo II de' Medici, Duke of Urbino</a>, and <a href="Madeleine_de_La_Tour_d&#39;Auvergne" title="wikilink">Madeleine de La Tour d'Auvergne, Countess of Boulogne</a>, died within weeks of her birth.</p>
<p>In 1533, at the age of fourteen, Caterina married Henry, second son of <a href="Francis_I_of_France" title="wikilink">King Francis I</a> and <a href="Claude_of_France" title="wikilink">Queen Claude of France</a>. Under the <a href="Francization" title="wikilink">gallicised</a> version of her name, <strong>Catherine de M&lt;U+00E9&gt;dicis</strong>,<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> she was <a href="List_of_French_consorts" title="wikilink">Queen consort of France</a> as the wife of King <a href="Henry_II_of_France" title="wikilink">Henry II of France</a> from 1547 to 1559. Throughout his reign, Henry excluded Catherine from participating in state affairs and instead showered favours on his chief mistress, <a href="Diane_de_Poitiers" title="wikilink">Diane de Poitiers</a>, who wielded much influence over him. Henry's death thrust Catherine into the political arena as mother of the frail fifteen-year-old King <a href="Francis_II_of_France" title="wikilink">Francis II</a>. When he died in 1560, she became <a href="regent" class="uri" title="wikilink">regent</a> on behalf of her ten-year-old son <a href="Charles_IX_of_France" title="wikilink">King Charles IX</a> and was granted sweeping powers. After Charles died in 1574, Catherine played a key role in the reign of her third son, <a href="Henry_III_of_France" title="wikilink">Henry III</a>. He dispensed with her advice only in the last months of her life.</p>
<p>Catherine's three sons reigned in an age of almost constant civil and religious war in France. The problems facing the monarchy were complex and daunting. At first, Catherine compromised and made concessions to the rebelling Protestants, or <a href="Huguenot" title="wikilink">Huguenots</a>, as they became known. She failed, however, to grasp the theological issues that drove their movement. Later, she resorted in frustration and anger to hard-line policies against them.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> In return, she came to be blamed for the excessive persecutions carried out under her sons' rule, in particular for the <a href="St._Bartholomew&#39;s_Day_massacre" title="wikilink">St. Bartholomew's Day massacre</a> of 1572, in which thousands of Huguenots were killed in Paris and throughout France.</p>
<p>Some recent historians have excused Catherine from blame for the worst decisions of the crown, though evidence for her ruthlessness can be found in her letters.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> In practice, her authority was always limited by the effects of the civil wars. Her policies, therefore, may be seen as desperate measures to keep the <a href="House_of_Valois" title="wikilink">Valois monarchy</a> on the throne at all costs, and her spectacular patronage of the arts as an attempt to glorify a monarchy whose prestige was in steep decline.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> Without Catherine, it is unlikely that her sons would have remained in power.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> The years in which they reigned have been called &quot;the age of Catherine de' Medici&quot;.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>

<p>The Medici were a nouveau riche family: originally bankers, they came to great wealth and power by bankrolling the monarchies of Europe. Catherine's father, Lorenzo II de' Medici, was made <a href="Duke_of_Urbino" title="wikilink">Duke of Urbino</a> by her uncle <a href="Pope_Leo_X" title="wikilink">Pope Leo X</a>, and the title reverted to <a href="Francesco_Maria_I_della_Rovere" title="wikilink">Francesco Maria I della Rovere</a> after Lorenzo's death. Thus, even though her father was a duke, Catherine was of relatively low birth. However her mother, <a href="Madeleine_de_la_Tour_d&#39;Auvergne" title="wikilink">Madeleine de la Tour d'Auvergne</a>, the Countess of Boulogne, was from one of the most <a href="House_of_La_Tour_d&#39;Auvergne" title="wikilink">prominent and ancient French noble family</a> and this prestigious maternal heritage is no stranger to her being married to a <a href="Fils_de_France" title="wikilink">Royal Prince of France</a>.</p>
<p>According to a contemporary chronicler, when Catherine de' Medici was born in Florence on Wednesday 13 April 1519, her parents, were &quot;as pleased as if it had been a boy&quot;.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> Their pleasure, however, was short-lived. Madeleine died on 28 April and Lorenzo died on 4 May. The young couple were married the year before at <a href="Amboise" class="uri" title="wikilink">Amboise</a> as part of the alliance between King <a href="Francis_I_of_France" title="wikilink">Francis I of France</a> and Pope Leo against the <a href="Maximilian_I,_Holy_Roman_Emperor" title="wikilink">Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian I</a>. King Francis wanted Catherine to be raised at the French court, but Pope Leo had other plans for her. He intended to marry her to his brother's illegitimate son, <a href="Ippolito_de&#39;_Medici" title="wikilink">Ippolito de' Medici</a>, and set them up to rule Florence.</p>
<p>Catherine was first cared for by her paternal grandmother, Alfonsina Orsini (wife of <a href="Piero_di_Lorenzo_de&#39;_Medici" title="wikilink">Piero de' Medici</a>). After Alfonsina's death in 1520, Catherine joined her cousins and was raised by her aunt, <a href="Clarice_de&#39;_Medici" title="wikilink">Clarice Strozzi</a>. The death of Pope Leo in 1521 interrupted Medici power briefly, until Cardinal Giulio de' Medici was elected <a href="Pope_Clement_VII" title="wikilink">Pope Clement VII</a> in 1523. Clement housed Catherine in the <a href="Palazzo_Medici_Riccardi" title="wikilink">Palazzo Medici</a> in Florence, where she lived in state. The Florentine people called her &quot;<em>duchessina</em>&quot;, the little duchess, in deference to her unrecognised claim to the <a href="Duchy_of_Urbino" title="wikilink">Duchy of Urbino</a>.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a><a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1527, the Medici were overthrown in Florence by a faction opposed to the regime of Clement's representative, <a href="Silvio_Passerini" title="wikilink">Cardinal Passerini</a>, and Catherine was taken hostage and placed in a series of convents.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> Clement had no choice but to crown <a href="Charles_V,_Holy_Roman_Emperor" title="wikilink">Charles</a> Holy Roman Emperor in return for his help in retaking the city.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> In October 1529, Charles's troops laid <a href="Siege_of_Florence_(1529&lt;U+2013&gt;1530)" title="wikilink">siege to Florence</a>. As the siege dragged on, voices called for Catherine to be killed and exposed on the city walls. Soldiers made her ride through the streets on a donkey, jeered by an angry crowd.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> The city finally surrendered on 12 August 1530. Clement called Catherine to Rome and greeted her with open arms and tears in his eyes. Then he set about the business of finding her a husband.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>

<p>On her visit to Rome, the Venetian envoy described her as &quot;small of stature, and thin, and without delicate features, but having the protruding eyes peculiar to the Medici family&quot;.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> Suitors, however, lined up for her hand; and when in early 1533 Francis I of France proposed his second son, <a href="Henry_II_of_France" title="wikilink">Henry, Duke of Orl&lt;U+00E9&gt;ans</a>, Clement jumped at the offer. Henry was a prize catch for Catherine, who despite her wealth was from commoner origins.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
<p>The wedding, a grand affair marked by extravagant display and gift-giving,<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> took place in <a href="Marseille" class="uri" title="wikilink">Marseille</a> on 28 October 1533.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> Prince Henry danced and <a href="jousting" title="wikilink">jousted</a> for Catherine. The fourteen-year-old couple left their wedding ball at midnight to perform their nuptial duties. Henry arrived in the bedroom with King Francis, who is said to have stayed until the marriage was consummated. He noted that &quot;each had shown valour in the joust&quot;.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> Clement visited the newlyweds in bed the next morning and added his blessings to the night's proceedings.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a></p>
<p>Catherine saw little of her husband in their first year of marriage, but the ladies of the court treated her well, impressed with her intelligence and keenness to please.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> The death of Pope Clement VII on 25 September 1534, however, undermined Catherine's standing in the French court. The next pope, <a href="Pope_Paul_III" title="wikilink">Paul III</a>, broke the alliance with France and refused to pay her huge dowry. King Francis lamented, &quot;The girl has come to me stark naked.&quot;<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a></p>
<p>Prince Henry showed no interest in Catherine as a wife; instead, he openly took mistresses. For the first ten years of the marriage, Catherine failed to produce any children. In 1537, on the other hand, Philippa Duci, one of Henry's mistresses, gave birth to a daughter, whom he publicly acknowledged.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> This proved that Henry was fertile and added to the pressure on Catherine to produce a child.</p>
<h3 id="dauphine">Dauphine</h3>
<p>In 1536, Henry's older brother, <a href="Francis,_Dauphin_of_France_(1518-1536)" title="wikilink">Francis</a>, caught a chill after a game of tennis, contracted a fever, and died, leaving Henry the heir. As Dauphine, Catherine was now expected to provide a future heir to the throne.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> According to the court chronicler <a href="Pierre_de_Bourdeille,_seigneur_de_Brant&lt;U+00F4&gt;me" title="wikilink">Brant&lt;U+00F4&gt;me</a>, &quot;many people advised the king and the Dauphin to repudiate her, since it was necessary to continue the line of France&quot;.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> Divorce was discussed. In desperation, Catherine tried every known trick for getting pregnant, such as placing cow dung and ground stags' antlers on her &quot;source of life&quot;, and drinking mule's urine.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> On 20 January 1544, she at last gave birth to a son, named after King Francis. The old king greeted the news with tears of joy.</p>
<p>After becoming pregnant once, Catherine had no trouble doing so again. She may have owed her change of luck to the physician <a href="Jean_Fernel" title="wikilink">Jean Fernel</a>, who had noticed slight abnormalities in the couple's sexual organs and advised them how to solve the problem.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> Catherine went on to bear Henry a further nine children, seven of whom survived infancy, including the future <a href="Charles_IX_of_France" title="wikilink">Charles IX</a> (born 27 June 1550); the future <a href="Henry_III_of_France" title="wikilink">Henry III</a> (born 19 September 1551); and <a href="Francis,_Duke_of_Anjou" title="wikilink">Francis</a> (born 18 March 1555). The long-term future of the <a href="House_of_Valois" title="wikilink">Valois dynasty</a>, which had ruled France since the 14th century, seemed assured.</p>
<p>Catherine's new-found ability to bear children, however, failed to improve her marriage. In 1538, at the age of nineteen, Henry had taken as his mistress the thirty-eight year old <a href="Diane_de_Poitiers" title="wikilink">Diane de Poitiers</a>, whom he adored for the rest of his life.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> Even so, he respected Catherine's status as his consort.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> When King Francis I died in 1547 Catherine became queen consort of France. She was crowned in the <a href="Basilique_Saint-Denis" title="wikilink">basilica of Saint-Denis</a> in June 1549.</p>

<p>The imperial ambassador reported that in the presence of guests, Henry would sit on Diane's lap and play the guitar, chat about politics, or fondle her breasts.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> Diane never regarded Catherine as a threat. She even encouraged the king to sleep with her and father more children. In 1556, Catherine nearly died giving birth to twin daughters. Surgeons saved her life by breaking the legs of one of the two babies, who died in her womb.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> The surviving daughter died seven weeks later. Catherine had no more children.</p>
<p>Henry's reign also saw the rise of the Guise brothers, <a href="Charles,_Cardinal_of_Lorraine" title="wikilink">Charles</a>, who became a <a href="cardinal_(Catholicism)" title="wikilink">cardinal</a>, and Henry's boyhood friend <a href="Francis,_Duke_of_Guise" title="wikilink">Francis</a>, who became <a href="Counts_and_Dukes_of_Guise" title="wikilink">Duke of Guise</a>.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> Their sister <a href="Mary_of_Guise" title="wikilink">Mary of Guise</a> had married <a href="James_V_of_Scotland" title="wikilink">James V of Scotland</a> in 1538 and was the mother of <a href="Mary,_Queen_of_Scots" title="wikilink">Mary, Queen of Scots</a>.

On 20 August 1560, Catherine and the chancellor advocated this policy to an assembly of notables at <a href="Ch&lt;U+00E2&gt;teau_de_Fontainebleau" title="wikilink">Fontainebleau</a>. Historians regard the occasion as an early example of Catherine's statesmanship. Meanwhile, Cond&lt;U+00E9&gt; raised an army and in autumn 1560 began attacking towns in the south. Catherine ordered him to court and had him imprisoned as soon as he arrived. He was tried in November, found guilty of offences against the crown, and sentenced to execution.

<p>When Catherine had realized Francis was going to die, she made a pact with Antoine de Bourbon by which he would renounce his right to the regency of the future king, <a href="Charles_IX_of_France" title="wikilink">Charles IX</a>, in return for the release of his brother Cond&lt;U+00E9&gt;.<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a> As a result, when Francis died on 5 December 1560, the Privy Council appointed Catherine as governor of France (<em>gouvernante de France</em>), with sweeping powers.

<p>At first Catherine kept the nine-year-old king, who cried at his coronation, close to her, and slept in his chamber . She presided over his council, decided policy, and controlled state business and patronage. However, she was never in a position to control the country as a whole, which was on the brink of civil war. In many parts of France the rule of nobles held sway rather than that of the crown. The challenges Catherine faced were complex and in some ways difficult for her to comprehend as a foreigner.<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a></p>
<p>She summoned church leaders from both sides to attempt to solve their doctrinal differences. Despite her optimism, the resulting <a href="Colloquy_of_Poissy" title="wikilink">Colloquy of Poissy</a> ended in failure on 13 October 1561, dissolving itself without her permission.<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a> Catherine failed because she saw the religious divide only in political terms. In the words of historian R. J.

<p>On 17 August 1563, Charles IX was declared of age at the <a href="Parlement" class="uri" title="wikilink">Parlement</a> of Rouen, but he was never able to rule on his own and showed little interest in government.<a href="#fn73" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref73"><sup>73</sup></a> Catherine decided to launch a drive to enforce the <a href="Edict_of_Amboise" title="wikilink">Edict of Amboise</a> and revive loyalty to the crown.

<p>The Huguenots retreated to the fortified stronghold of <a href="La_Rochelle" title="wikilink">La Rochelle</a> on the west coast, where Jeanne d'Albret and her fifteen-year-old son, <a href="Henry_IV_of_France" title="wikilink">Henry of Bourbon</a>, joined them.<a href="#fn83" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref83"><sup>83</sup></a> &quot;We have come to the determination to die, all of us&quot;, Jeanne wrote to Catherine, &quot;rather than abandon our God, and our religion&quot;.<a href="#fn84" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref84"><sup>84</sup></a> Catherine called Jeanne, whose decision to rebel posed a dynastic threat to the Valois, &quot;the most shameless woman in the world&quot;.<a href="#fn85" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref85"><sup>85</sup></a> Nevertheless, the <a href="Peace_of_Saint-Germain-en-Laye" title="wikilink">Peace of Saint-Germain-en-Laye</a>, signed on 8 August 1570 because the royal army ran out of cash, conceded wider toleration to the Huguenots than ever before.<a href="#fn86" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref86"><sup>86</sup></a></p>
<p>Catherine looked to further Valois interests by grand dynastic marriages.

Now she sought a marriage between Margaret and <a href="Henry_III_of_Navarre" title="wikilink">Henry III of Navarre</a>, with the aim of uniting Valois and Bourbon interests. Margaret, however, was secretly involved with <a href="Henry_I,_Duke_of_Guise" title="wikilink">Henry of Guise</a>, the son of the late Duke of Guise. When Catherine found this out, she had her daughter brought from her bed. Catherine and the king then beat her, ripping her nightclothes and pulling out handfuls of her hair.<a href="#fn88" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref88"><sup>88</sup></a></p>
<p>Catherine pressed Jeanne d'Albret to attend court. Writing that she wanted to see Jeanne's children, she promised not to harm them.

Catherine, who was said to have received the news without emotion, made a tearful visit to Coligny and promised to punish his attacker. Many historians have blamed Catherine for the attack on Coligny. Others point to the Guise family or a Spanish-papal plot to end Coligny's influence on the king.<a href="#fn94" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref94"><sup>94</sup></a> Whatever the truth, the bloodbath that followed was soon beyond the control of Catherine or any other leader.<a href="#fn95" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref95"><sup>95</sup></a></p>

<p>Two years later, Catherine faced a new crisis with the death of Charles IX at the age of twenty-three. His dying words were &quot;oh, my mother ...&quot;.<a href="#fn102" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref102"><sup>102</sup></a> The day before he died, he named Catherine regent, since his brother and heir, Henry the Duke of Anjou, was in the <a href="Polish-Lithuanian_Commonwealth" title="wikilink">Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth</a>, where he had been elected <a href="List_of_Polish_monarchs#Polish-Lithuanian_Commonwealth" title="wikilink">king</a> the year before. However three months after his coronation at <a href="Wawel_Cathedral" title="wikilink">Wawel Cathedral</a>, Henry abandoned that throne and returned to France in order to become king of France. Catherine wrote to Henry: &quot;I am grief-stricken to have witnessed such a scene and the love which he showed me at the end ...

<p>Henry was Catherine's favourite son. Unlike his brothers, he came to the throne as a grown man. He was also healthier, though he suffered from weak lungs and constant fatigue.<a href="#fn104" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref104"><sup>104</sup></a> His interest in the tasks of government, however, proved fitful.

His choice thwarted Catherine's plans for a political marriage to a foreign princess. Rumours of Henry's inability to produce children were by that time in wide circulation. The papal <a href="nuncio" class="uri" title="wikilink">nuncio</a> Salviati observed, &quot;it is only with difficulty that we can imagine there will be offspring ... physicians and those who know him well say that he has an extremely weak constitution and will not live long&quot;.<a href="#fn106" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref106"><sup>106</sup></a> As time passed and the likelihood of children from the marriage receded, Catherine's youngest son, <a href="Francis,_Duke_of_Anjou" title="wikilink">Francis, Duke of Alen&lt;U+00E7&gt;on</a>, known as &quot;Monsieur&quot;, played upon his role as heir to the throne, repeatedly exploiting the anarchy of the civil wars, which were by now as much about noble power struggles as religion.<a href="#fn107" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref107"><sup>107</sup></a> Catherine did all in her power to bring Francis back into the fold.

<p>Catherine had at least taken the precaution of marrying Margaret, her youngest daughter, to Navarre. Margaret, however, became almost as much of a thorn in Catherine's side as Francis, and in 1582, she returned to the French court without her husband. Catherine was heard yelling at her for taking lovers.<a href="#fn115" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref115"><sup>115</sup></a> Catherine sent <a href="Pomponne_de_Belli&lt;U+00E8&gt;vre" title="wikilink">Pomponne de Belli&lt;U+00E8&gt;vre</a> to Navarre to arrange Margaret's return.

Catherine asked Henry to act before Margaret brought shame on them again.

Her efforts won Catherine new respect from the French people.<a href="#fn120" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref120"><sup>120</sup></a> On her return to Paris in 1579, she was greeted outside the city by the Parlement and crowds.

<p>Henry hired Swiss troops to help him defend himself in Paris. The Parisians, however, claimed the right to defend the city themselves. On 12 May 1588, they set up barricades in the streets and refused to take orders from anyone except the Duke of Guise.<a href="#fn134" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref134"><sup>134</sup></a> When Catherine tried to go to mass, she found her way barred, though she was allowed through the barricades.

As Guise entered the king's chamber, the Forty-five plunged their blades into his body, and he died at the foot of the king's bed.

In an age of civil war and declining respect for the monarchy, she sought to bolster royal prestige through lavish cultural display. Once in control of the royal purse, she launched a programme of artistic patronage that lasted for three decades. During this time, she presided over a distinctive late <a href="French_Renaissance" title="wikilink">French Renaissance</a> culture in all branches of the arts.<a href="#fn147" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref147"><sup>147</sup></a></p>

Many portraits in her collection were by <a href="Jean_Clouet" title="wikilink">Jean Clouet</a> (1480&lt;U+2013&gt;1541) and his son <a href="Fran&lt;U+00E7&gt;ois_Clouet" title="wikilink">Fran&lt;U+00E7&gt;ois Clouet</a> (c. 1510&lt;U+2013&gt;1572). Fran&lt;U+00E7&gt;ois Clouet drew and painted portraits of all Catherine's family and of many members of the court.<a href="#fn149" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref149"><sup>149</sup></a> After Catherine's death, a decline in the quality of French portraiture set in. By 1610, the school patronised by the late Valois court and brought to its pinnacle by Fran&lt;U+00E7&gt;ois Clouet had all but died out.<a href="#fn150" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref150"><sup>150</sup></a></p>
<p>Beyond portraiture, little is known about the painting at Catherine de' Medici's court.<a href="#fn151" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref151"><sup>151</sup></a> In the last two decades of her life, only two painters stand out as recognisable personalities: <a href="Jehan_Cousin_the_younger" title="wikilink">Jean Cousin the Younger</a> (c. 1522&lt;U+2013&gt;c. 1594), few of whose works survive, and <a href="Antoine_Caron" title="wikilink">Antoine Caron</a> (c. 1521&lt;U+2013&gt;1599), who became Catherine's official painter after working at <a href="Fontainebleau" class="uri" title="wikilink">Fontainebleau</a> under <a href="Francesco_Primaticcio" title="wikilink">Primaticcio</a>. Caron's vivid <a href="Mannerism" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mannerism</a>, with its love of ceremonial and its preoccupation with massacres, reflects the neurotic atmosphere of the French court during the <a href="French_Wars_of_Religion" title="wikilink">Wars of Religion</a>.<a href="#fn152" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref152"><sup>152</sup></a></p>
<p>Many of Caron's paintings, such as those of the <em>Triumphs of the Seasons</em>, are of <a href="allegory" title="wikilink">allegorical</a> subjects that echo the <a href="Catherine_de&#39;_Medici&#39;s_court_festivals" title="wikilink">festivities</a> for which Catherine's court was famous. His designs for the <a href="Valois_Tapestries" title="wikilink">Valois Tapestries</a> celebrate the <em>f&lt;U+00EA&gt;tes</em>, picnics, and mock battles of the &quot;magnificent&quot; entertainments hosted by Catherine. They depict events held at Fontainebleau in 1564; at <a href="Bayonne" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bayonne</a> in 1565 for the summit meeting with the Spanish court; and at the <a href="Tuileries_Palace" title="wikilink">Tuileries</a> in 1573 for the visit of the Polish ambassadors who presented the Polish crown to Catherine's son <a href="Henry_III_of_France" title="wikilink">Henry of Anjou</a>.<a href="#fn153" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref153"><sup>153</sup></a> Biographer Leonie Frieda suggests that &quot;Catherine, more than anyone, inaugurated the fantastic entertainments for which later French monarchs also became renowned&quot;.<a href="#fn154" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref154"><sup>154</sup></a> <img src="Ballet_1582.png" title="fig:The Ballet Comique de la Reine, from an engraving of 1582 by Jacques Patin" alt="The Ballet Comique de la Reine, from an engraving of 1582 by Jacques Patin" width="200" /> The musical shows in particular allowed Catherine to express her creative gifts. They were usually dedicated to the ideal of peace in the realm and based on <a href="Mythology" title="wikilink">mythological</a> themes. To create the necessary dramas, music, and scenic effects for these events, Catherine employed the leading artists and architects of the day. Historian Frances Yates has called her &quot;a great creative artist in festivals&quot;.<a href="#fn155" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref155"><sup>155</sup></a> Catherine gradually introduced changes to the traditional entertainments: for example, she increased the prominence of dance in the shows that climaxed each series of entertainments. A distinctive new art form, the <em><a href="ballets_de_cour" title="wikilink">ballet de cour</a></em>, emerged from these creative advances.<a href="#fn156" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref156"><sup>156</sup></a> Owing to its synthesis of dance, music, verse, and setting, the production of the <em><a href="Ballet_Comique_de_la_Reine" title="wikilink">Ballet Comique de la Reine</a></em> in 1581 is regarded by scholars as the first authentic ballet.<a href="#fn157" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref157"><sup>157</sup></a></p>
<p>Catherine de' Medici's great love among the arts was architecture. &quot;As the daughter of the Medici&quot;, suggests French art historian Jean-Pierre Babelon, &quot;she was driven by a passion to build and a desire to leave great achievements behind her when she died.&quot;<a href="#fn158" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref158"><sup>158</sup></a> After Henry II's death, Catherine set out to immortalise her husband's memory and to enhance the grandeur of the Valois monarchy through a series of costly building projects.<a href="#fn159" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref159"><sup>159</sup></a> These included work on ch&lt;U+00E2&gt;teaux at Montceaux-en-Brie, <a href="Saint-Maur-des-Foss&lt;U+00E9&gt;s" class="uri" title="wikilink">Saint-Maur-des-Foss&lt;U+00E9&gt;s</a>, and Chenonceau. Catherine built two new palaces in Paris: the Tuileries and the H&lt;U+00F4&gt;tel de la Reine. She was closely involved in the planning and supervising of all her architectural schemes.<a href="#fn160" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref160"><sup>160</sup></a></p>
<p>Catherine had emblems of her love and grief carved into the stonework of her buildings.<a href="#fn161" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref161"><sup>161</sup></a> Poets lauded her as the new Artemisia, after <a href="Artemisia_II_of_Caria" title="wikilink">Artemisia II of Caria</a>, who built the <a href="Mausoleum_of_Maussollos" title="wikilink">Mausoleum</a> at <a href="Halicarnassus" class="uri" title="wikilink">Halicarnassus</a> as a tomb for her dead husband.<a href="#fn162" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref162"><sup>162</sup></a> As the centrepiece of an ambitious new chapel, she commissioned a magnificent tomb for Henry at the basilica of Saint Denis.

Art historian Henri Zerner has called this monument &quot;the last and most brilliant of the royal tombs of the Renaissance&quot;.<a href="#fn163" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref163"><sup>163</sup></a> Catherine also commissioned <a href="Germain_Pilon" title="wikilink">Germain Pilon</a> to carve the marble sculpture that contains Henry II's heart.
