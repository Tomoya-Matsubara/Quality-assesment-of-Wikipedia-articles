<dt></dt>
<dd>A tomboyish high-school girl who played <a href="softball" class="uri" title="wikilink">softball</a> in middle school. Shortly after entering high school, she becomes determined to find a boyfriend under the influence of all the <a href="sh&lt;U+014D&gt;jo" class="uri" title="wikilink">sh&lt;U+014D&gt;jo</a> <a href="manga" class="uri" title="wikilink">manga</a> she reads. She accidentally meets Yoh after a failed attempt at being &quot;picked up&quot; by guys. Shortly after that, she finds out Yoh goes to the same high school as Haruna and asks him to coach her on how to be attractive. After being rejected, she meets Asami, Yoh's sister and they become friends. Soon, Yoh reluctantly accepts to be Haruna's coach with one condition - she is not to fall in love with him! Yoh helps her on a daily basis, with clothes and such, and even gives her advice on what to do when she falls in love with one of Yoh's friends. Haruna starts to fall in love with Yoh, but rejects it since Yoh told her not to fall in love with him. Nevertheless, she asks Yoh a &quot;hypothetical&quot; question about what to do when she falls in love with someone she is not supposed to, but Yoh does not get why she is so serious about a hypothetical question. She tells Yoh she is in love with him, and Yoh surprisingly tells her he is happy that he's the one she likes. In the recent chapters, Haruna and Yoh are currently dating. Haruna can be described as simple-minded and doesn't seem to pay much attention to her surroundings, though she is very kind hearted and cannot refuse anyone who needs help. Her friend once stated that she is &quot;pure-hearted to the point of being scary&quot;. She is also very strong, it is shown on more than one occasion, she opened a jar that even Yoh couldn't open and beat Yoh at an <a href="arm_wrestling" title="wikilink">arm wrestling</a> match. Yoh constantly tells her not to show off her muscular legs in public.

<dt></dt>
<dd>A total hottie who's in the grade above Haruna. He knows the ideas on how to impress men from a woman's point of view. Although a little shy and easily embarrassed, he represents a figure of cool demeanor, he was even asked out on a date when he was in elementary school. In the beginning when Haruna asked him to tutor her about profession in boyfriend-making, he warned her not to fall in love with him and cry around him. Yoh helps Haruna on a daily basis, with clothes and such, and even gives her advice on what to do when she falls in love with one of his friends. Soon after Haruna starts to fall in love with him, she asks him a hypothetical question on what to do after when she falls in love with someone she's not supposed to. He apparently doesn't remember saying anything of the sort, and unknowingly asks why she is so serious about a hypothetical question. He then notices how Haruna avoids him and acts weirdly around him and soon remembers her question and what he said after he agreed to be her coach. Yoh asks Haruna if she likes him and Haruna regrettably says no. Yoh seemed to feel a tiny bit depressed only until he saw Haruna run after him. After Haruna confessed to Yoh that she truly loved him, he finally accepted. Yoh and Haruna are currently dating.

<dd>When Haruna asks him to coach her he says no because there are also faults about falling in love. Finally after seeing her play in her final softball game where she lost he discovers how determined she is and even when she gives up she keeps going. When Yoh was in middle school he would get love letters in his shoe box along with letters of hate from parents and even college guys. Because of that he was isolated from others. When he joins the basketball team he becomes close with the manager, a cute and popular girl named Kurihara. She's a very dependent person and Yoh being somewhat of a caretaker helps her all the time. He started walking home with her everyday and told her that his house was also in the same direction. Soon she discovers it's not and wonders if they are going out. She becomes so troubled by the thought she starts asking everyone on the basketball team whether or not they think so, soon breaking up the team spirit and isolating Yoh. They refer to Kurihara as his ex and as the &quot;bead-incident&quot; because she loved beads but Yoh pretended to not care even though he bought her a beaded necklace. They break up before he can give it to her. Later, when Yoh meets Haruna she finds the necklace and he breaks it apart, but Haruna fixes it and gives it back to him.

<dd>Yoh's little sister. Although she's pretty and admired by many boys, she often shows her conceited side. She has a serious brother complex. She wants Yoh and Haruna to be together, however, sometimes she tries to protect her older brother when she thinks Haruna is trying to get to Yoh sexually (Haruna is not, actually...). Often, when Haruna goes to her when she's having a problem, Asami says it's going to be &quot;fun&quot; but quickly replaces it with &quot;trouble&quot;. She likes Fumiya, but wanted to test him and see if he would wait forever in the snow for her. Even when Haruna liked him as well, Haruna helped her notice how kind hearted Fumiya was and they are currently going out. She gets angry at Fumiya when he didn't take any notice of her, even when she tried her cute poses. However, later in chapter 27, when she was getting sexually harassed, Fumiya snapped and protected Asami with much ferocity. At the end of the chapter, they finally kiss.
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt></dt>
<dd>Yoh's friend, also known as &quot;Fumi&quot;. He's a bit on the slow side, not getting some things straight even if it is right before his eyes. Haruna had a crush on him because of his caring personality, but when he announced he and Asami were going out, Haruna had finally decided that her heart was really set on Yoh's all this time. His caring demeanor was suddenly vicious when Asami was being harassed by a man to get him jealous, noting that he suddenly becomes angry when women and children are being harassed. Asami admits she only went with the man because she felt Fumiya didn't notice her enough, only to be surprised when he grabs her and kisses her.
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt></dt>
<dd>Yoh's friend. He has a part-time job at a restaurant, and like Fumiya, he is calm and caring (fortunately, he has some common sense and is not as dense as Fumiya). Yoh says that ninety percent of what Asaoka says is out of kindness and that whomever goes out with him would be happy because of all the kind words he says. Haruna once tried to get Asaoka and her friend Mami-chan together, but Yoh got mad at her because he was jealous Haruna was paying more attention to Asaoka than him and left. In Chapter 20, Asaoka had Haruna go with him on a &quot;date&quot; to make Yoh jealous, since Yoh and Haruna were fighting. At the end of the &quot;date&quot;, Asaoka &quot;confessed&quot; and suggested that she cheat on Yoh with him, even saying that he didn't mind being &quot;the second guy&quot;. After Haruna refused and Yoh showed up, Asaoka claimed he was joking about his confession, but his realistic acting and his behavior in the more recent chapters say otherwise. In recent chapters, he has done many things that imply that he really has feelings for Haruna, like telling her to come to him if she ever gets tired of Yoh, but Haruna only takes it as him being polite. At the end of Chapter 35, Yoh asks him straight out if he likes Haruna. In Chapter 36, he challenges Yoh, asking what Yoh will do if he does like her. Yoh tells him to give up, and Asaoka turns it into a contest, saying that if Yoh wins more events than him at the school's athletic meet, he will give up on confessing to Haruna.
</dd>
<dd>In Chapter 37, when Yoh wins, he denies he really likes Haruna getting Yoh upset. Once Yoh leaves, Mami comes up to him telling him that he is always deceiving himself by passing things off as a joke and that he doesn't even know what his true feelings are. She also tells him that Haruna is a good girl and it isn't strange for him to like Haruna. When Mami tells him this, he seems to be surprised. At the end of the chapter, when Asoaka looks out of the window he sees Haruna and he tells her that he likes her. Haruna looks up at him surprised, but then smiles, saying she isn't going to fall for that, thinking it was a joke.
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt></dt>
<dd>Haruna's best friend since middle school. She is notably calm and collected, being able to read Haruna like an open book. Their friendship is a close one and Haruna has described how Mami first became her friend by helping her with her pitching. She has a part-time job at a video rental shop and was the softball captain of their team. Haruna often has a very high opinion of Mami believing that she is 'amazing. She describes Mami as kind, clever and calm, which is often replied to by the statement that Mami is a 'nice girl' or a 'good girl'. It has been revealed too that Mami extremely values her friendship with Haruna, even going to the extent of saying that she 'betrayed' Haruna for not believing and trusting in Haruna's pitch, which had lost them that game in third year.
</dd>
<dd>Mami has proven at several times, that she is highly perceptive, especially concerning Haruna. Haruna, in turn, demonstrates her affection for Mami by trying to help her find her own love. This has led to a date with Asaoka because of their similarities. Her relationship with Asaoka and their friendship is uncertain, though they seem to have a common understanding of each other. In recent chapters, however, Mami has revealed some revelations to Asaoka, telling him that he has deceived others and himself so often that he is not sure of his true feelings anymore. This stuns Asaoka. As of chapter 47, there is another insight into their relationship when Asaoka thanks her for a souvenir from a school trip. Earlier, Mami had announced that she would like to become open to love, to which Asaoka had replied that she was 'always welcome' to him. She asks him then whether what Asaoka had said was 60% true or not. This can imply several things. That Asaoka is interested in Mami or that Mami is interested in pursuing a relationship with Asaoka. This stuns Asaoka again. It seems that their intelligence and personality are very similar and they are of equal measure.
