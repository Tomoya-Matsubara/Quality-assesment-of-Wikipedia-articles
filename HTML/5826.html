<h2 id="biography">Biography</h2>
<p>Francisco de Sales Torres Homem was born on <a href="January_29" title="wikilink">January 29</a>, <a href="1812" class="uri" title="wikilink">1812</a> at <a href="Rio_de_Janeiro" title="wikilink">Rio de Janeiro</a>, <a href="Brazil" class="uri" title="wikilink">Brazil</a>. His father, Apolin&lt;U+00E1&gt;rio Torres Homem, was a shady businessman, married to Mar&lt;U+00ED&gt;a Patr&lt;U+00ED&gt;cia, a <a href="mulatto" class="uri" title="wikilink">mulatto</a> traveling market salesman, nicknamed <em>You kill me</em>.</p>
<p>After finishing his career in medicine at the Medical-Surgical Academy at Rio de Janeiro in 1832, he became enrolled by Evaristo Ferreira da Veiga at the Society for the Defense of Freedom and National Independence, a political group related to the moderate liberal party, and asked to write political articles for some journals. At first he was unwilling to perform these duties, according to him because he lacked knowledge and interest on politics; however, Ferreira da Veiga made him change his mind after prasing him his first article written for the journal <em>Aurora Fluminense</em>. He later travels to <a href="Paris" class="uri" title="wikilink">Paris</a> to study law, with a focus on political economy.</p>
<p>He maintained a close friendship since childhood with <a href="Domingos_Jos&lt;U+00E9&gt;_Gon&lt;U+00E7&gt;alves_de_Magalh&lt;U+00E3&gt;es" title="wikilink">Domingos Jos&lt;U+00E9&gt; Gon&lt;U+00E7&gt;alves de Magalh&lt;U+00E3&gt;es</a> who made him get into the Historical Institute of Paris to write a dissertation in 1834 along with poet <a href="Manuel_de_Ara&lt;U+00FA&gt;jo_Porto-alegre" title="wikilink">Manuel de Ara&lt;U+00FA&gt;jo Porto-alegre</a> on the state of sciences in Brazil entitled <em>Resumo da Hist&lt;U+00F3&gt;ria da Literatura, das Ci&lt;U+00EA&gt;ncias e das Artes no Brasil por tr&lt;U+00EA&gt;s brasileiros, membros do Instituto Hist&lt;U+00F3&gt;rico</em> (<em>Brief Resume on the History of Literature, Sciences and Arts in Brazil by three Brazilians, members of the Historical Institute</em>). In <a href="1836" class="uri" title="wikilink">1836</a>, along with Gon&lt;U+00E7&gt;alves de Magalh&lt;U+00E3&gt;es, Ara&lt;U+00FA&gt;jo Porto-alegre and <a href="Jo&lt;U+00E3&gt;o_Manuel_Pereira_da_Silva" title="wikilink">Jo&lt;U+00E3&gt;o Manuel Pereira da Silva</a>, he creates <em>Niter&lt;U+00F3&gt;i</em>, a journal considered the initial landmark of the literary romantic movement of Brazil.</p>
<p>In <a href="1837" class="uri" title="wikilink">1837</a> he returns to Brazil. He writes for the <em>Journal of Political and Literary Debates</em> (<em>Jornal dos Debates Pol&lt;U+00ED&gt;ticos e Liter&lt;U+00E1&gt;rios</em>) from 1837 to 1838; his peers from France also collaborated in this journal. <em>Jornal dos Debates</em> was a journal which reflected the liberal thought opposed to regent <a href="Diogo_Feij&lt;U+00F3&gt;" title="wikilink">Diogo Feij&lt;U+00F3&gt;</a>'s government, having a considerable influence of its writing on the people. Torres Homem went later one to write for other journals: <em>Despertador</em> (1838 &lt;U+2013&gt; 1841) and <em>Maiorista</em> (1838 &lt;U+2013&gt; 1841).</p>
<p>In <a href="1842" class="uri" title="wikilink">1842</a> he joined the Society of Invisible Patriarchs, a secret revolutionary organization that took up arms against the monarchy. Because of this, Torres Homem was sent to exile for some months in <a href="Portugal" class="uri" title="wikilink">Portugal</a>.</p>
<p>In politics, Torres Homem became a deputy for <a href="Cear&lt;U+00E1&gt;" class="uri" title="wikilink">Cear&lt;U+00E1&gt;</a> (1842-1844) and, later on, for <a href="Minas_Gerais" title="wikilink">Minas Gerais</a> (1845-1847) and <a href="Rio_de_Janeiro_(state)" title="wikilink">Rio de Janeiro</a> (1848-1850).</p>
<p>In <a href="1849" class="uri" title="wikilink">1849</a>, after being editor for a whole year of a newspaper called <em>Correio Mercantil</em> (<em>Mercantile Post</em>), he publishes in its pages his famous <em>Libelo do Povo</em> (<em>People's Libel</em>); by using Timandro as pen name, Torres Homem criticized the imperial <a href="house_of_Bragan&lt;U+00E7&gt;a" title="wikilink">house of Bragan&lt;U+00E7&gt;a</a> for the mismanagement of Brazil, provoking criticism against him by those who sympathized with the monarchy. His <em>Libelo do povo</em> was a liberal protest against the arbitrary measures used by the crown to suppress the liberal revolt of 1848 in <a href="Pernambuco" class="uri" title="wikilink">Pernambuco</a>, and to prevent the fulfillment of the promise of independence, &quot;social and political renovation.&quot;<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> In <a href="1852" class="uri" title="wikilink">1852</a>, after establishing a Conciliation Ministry, the attacks diminished; however, Torres Homem maintained himself as firm opposition to the regime.</p>
<p>From <a href="December_12" title="wikilink">December 12</a>, <a href="1858" class="uri" title="wikilink">1858</a> to <a href="October_10" title="wikilink">October 10</a>, <a href="1859" class="uri" title="wikilink">1859</a>, he became Minister of Treasury. As such, he was considered <a href="metalist" class="uri" title="wikilink">metalist</a> by being firm defender of monetary restriction and a coin backed by gold. By <a href="1870" class="uri" title="wikilink">1870</a> he arrives to the Senate where he defends freedom for all slave's children, which earned him a year later, the conferment of the Order of Christ, and later, the title of Viscount of Inhomirim.</p>
<p>During the final days of his life, sick with asthma, he again disobeyed the Empire by traveling abroad to treat himself without asking for license. He comes back to Brazil and retakes his legislative chores, but his health problems forces him to go to <a href="Paris" class="uri" title="wikilink">Paris</a> where he dies on <a href="June_3" title="wikilink">June 3</a>, <a href="1876" class="uri" title="wikilink">1876</a>.</p>
