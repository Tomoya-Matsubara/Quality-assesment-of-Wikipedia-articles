<p><strong>Mafia Raj</strong> (<a href="Hindi" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hindi</a>: &lt;U+092E&gt;&lt;U+093E&gt;&lt;U+092B&gt;&lt;U+093C&gt;&lt;U+093F&gt;&lt;U+092F&gt;&lt;U+093E&gt; &lt;U+0930&gt;&lt;U+093E&gt;&lt;U+091C&gt;, <em>mafia regime</em>) refers to an economic and political situation where <a href="public_good" title="wikilink">public goods</a>, <a href="public_property" title="wikilink">property</a> and funds are controlled and systematically embezzled by a criminalized nexus (or &quot;<a href="mafia" class="uri" title="wikilink">mafia</a>&quot;) of government officials, elected politicians, business interests and other entities (such as law-enforcement authorities, non-governmental organizations, trade unions or criminal organizations).<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a><a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> The phenomenon of Mafia Raj is highly prevalent in <a href="Pakistan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Pakistan</a> and <a href="Bangladesh" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bangladesh</a> as well, countries which share a similar culture to that of India.</p>
<p>The term is used primarily in <a href="India" class="uri" title="wikilink">India</a>, and can refer to cities, states, government departments, public sector businesses or entire sectors of the economy that are subject to these conditions. Due to the ability of these mafias to operate their illegal activities in a sustained fashion, sometimes openly and with the use of violent intimidation, terms like <strong>Goonda Raj</strong> (<em>rule of the goons</em>), <strong>Jungle Raj</strong> (<em>law of the jungle</em>) and Anarchy are used to refer to the same phenomenon.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>In the Indian and <a href="Pakistan" title="wikilink">Pakistani</a> media, the mafias are usually mentioned by the name of the economic sector in which they are involved. Terms such as <em>coal mafia</em>, <em>timber mafia</em> (sometimes, <em>forest mafia</em>), <em>contractor mafia</em> (sometimes, <em>road construction mafia</em> or <em>road contract mafia</em>) and <em>land mafia</em> are commonly used.</p>
<h2 id="coal-mafia">Coal Mafia</h2>
<p><img src="182619562_00d6f703b6_b.jpg" title="fig:An Indian coal mine. The Dhanbad mine complex is allegedly dominated by a coal mafia." alt="An Indian coal mine. The Dhanbad mine complex is allegedly dominated by a coal mafia." width="250" /> The state-owned coal mines of <a href="Bihar" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bihar</a> (now <a href="Jharkhand" class="uri" title="wikilink">Jharkhand</a> after the division of Bihar state) were among the first areas in India to see the emergence of a sophisticated mafia, beginning with the mining town of <a href="Dhanbad" class="uri" title="wikilink">Dhanbad</a>.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> It is alleged that the coal industry's trade union leadership forms the upper echelon of this particular arrangement, and employs caste allegiances to maintain its power.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> Pilferage and sale of coal on the black market, inflated or fictitious supply expenses, falsified worker contracts and the expropriation and leasing-out of government land have allegedly become routine.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> A parallel economy has also developed with a significant fraction of the local population employed by the mafia in manually transporting the stolen coal for long distances over unpaved roads to illegal mafia warehouses and points of sale.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p>The coal mafia has had a negative effect on Indian industry, with coal supplies and quality varying erratically. Higher quality coal is sometimes selectively diverted, and missing coal replaced with stones and boulders in railway cargo wagons. Once, even a human corpse has been discovered in a sealed coal wagon.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="timber-mafias">Timber Mafias</h2>
<p><img src="Himachal_Pradesh_hills.jpg" title="fig:India&#39;s Himalayan and other forests are vulnerable to timber mafias." alt="India&#39;s Himalayan and other forests are vulnerable to timber mafias." width="250" /> Protected forest areas in several parts of India, such as <a href="Jammu_and_Kashmir" title="wikilink">Jammu and Kashmir</a>, <a href="Himachal_Pradesh" title="wikilink">Himachal Pradesh</a>, <a href="Karnataka" class="uri" title="wikilink">Karnataka</a> and Jharkhand, are vulnerable to illegal logging by timber mafias that have coopted or intimidated forestry officials, local politicians, businesses and citizenry.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a><a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> Terrorist groups have also joined the nexus in militancy-affected areas such as Kashmir.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> Clear-cutting is sometimes covered-up by conniving officials who report fictitious forest fires.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> Many studies indicate large losses of forest cover to indiscriminate logging by timber mafias, with over a million hectares in the environs of <a href="Chhotanagpur" class="uri" title="wikilink">Chhotanagpur</a> alone being illegally transferred by the forest department directly to industrial, mining and logging companies.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> Besides the environmental degradation, public financial losses can be substantial, and one 1994 estimate of stolen timber in the state of Karnataka amounted to <a href="Rupee" title="wikilink">Rs</a> 1,000 <a href="crore" title="wikilink">crores</a> (abour US$ 230 million).<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> <a href="Veerappan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Veerappan</a> was a notorious bandit who, until his shooting death by state police in 2004, specialized in illegally logging <a href="sandalwood" class="uri" title="wikilink">sandalwood</a> in Karnataka and <a href="Tamil_Nadu" title="wikilink">Tamil Nadu</a>.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
<p>As with coal, there have also been incidents of substitution of low-grade wood for high-quality timber when the procurement of wood is, in fact, authorized for government use. In an incident in 2005, officials determined that high-quality <a href="deodar" class="uri" title="wikilink">deodar</a> wood meant for military and railway use had been substituted with lower-quality <a href="Chir_Pine" title="wikilink">chir</a> wood in Jammu and Kashmir state, and the higher quality wood was intercepted in the process of being smuggled across the state border into <a href="Punjab_(India)" title="wikilink">Punjab</a>.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="contractor-mafias">Contractor Mafias</h2>
<p><img src="Delhi-Gurgaon_Airport_Expressway,_2007.jpg" title="fig:Public works, such as road construction, are sometimes dominated by contractor mafias." alt="Public works, such as road construction, are sometimes dominated by contractor mafias." width="250" /> Many state-funded construction activities in India, such as road building, are dominated by construction mafias, which are groupings of corrupt public works officials, materials suppliers, politicians and construction contractors.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> Shoddy construction and material substitution (e.g. mixing sand in <a href="cement" class="uri" title="wikilink">cement</a> while submitting expenses for cement) result in roads and highways being dangerous, and sometimes simply washed away when India's heavy <a href="monsoon" class="uri" title="wikilink">monsoon</a> season arrives.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
<p>In a widely covered case, <a href="Satyendra_Dubey" title="wikilink">Satyendra Dubey</a>, a project director with the National Highways Authority of India, was murdered in 2003, allegedly because he had written a letter exposing deep-seated contractor mafia involvement in the construction of a section of the prestigious <a href="Golden_Quadrilateral" title="wikilink">Golden Quadrilateral</a> project to the Prime Minister's office.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> Although a <a href="Central_Bureau_of_Investigation" title="wikilink">CBI</a> investigative report after the assassination stated that there was no contractor mafia involvement in Dubey's murder,<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> his family and supporters maintained that an attempt at a cover-up was being made.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a></p>
<p>Attempts have been made to reduce mafia influence by making construction <a href="tendering" class="uri" title="wikilink">tendering</a> processes more transparent, sometimes by attempting to move them online, so that a complete <a href="audit_trail" title="wikilink">audit trail</a> of bids and activity is maintained. Construction mafias are alleged to have used their political influence decisively to frustrate many such attempts, for example in the public works for which the <a href="Municipal_Corporation_of_Delhi" title="wikilink">Municipal Corporation of Delhi</a> is responsible.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="land-mafias">Land Mafias</h2>
<p><img src="WhiteTiger.jpg" title="fig:A local land mafia reportedly attempted to seize land planned to be used by the Central Zoo Authority as the site for India&#39;s first night safari." alt="A local land mafia reportedly attempted to seize land planned to be used by the Central Zoo Authority as the site for India&#39;s first night safari." width="250" /> In cities and villages throughout India, mafias consisting of municipal and other government officials, elected politicians, judicial officers, real estate developers and law enforcement officials, acquire, develop and sell land in illegal ways for profit.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> Sometimes, government land or land ostensibly acquired for some legitimate government purpose is then handed over to real estate developers who build commercial and residential properties and sell them in the open market, with the connivance of administrative and police officials.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> In one set of allegations in Karnataka, a lake was filled in and government buildings torn down after illegal transfers to a developer by mafia-connected officials.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> <a href="Eminent_domain" title="wikilink">Eminent domain</a> laws, intended to procure private land at relatively low prices for public benefit or redistribution to poorer people under <a href="social_justice" title="wikilink">social justice</a> programs, are abused to pressure existing landholders to sell land to a government entity, which transfers the land to developers at those low prices, and who in turn sell it back on the market at much higher prices.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a><a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a></p>
<p>Computerization of records relating to the classification of tracts and land ownership is a key tool in countering the illegal activities of land mafias, since it creates transparency on all information relating to a given parcel of land. This approach has been effective in <a href="Bangalore" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bangalore</a>,<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> but efforts to extend it elsewhere have sometimes met with strong resistance by land mafias, manifesting itself as bureaucratic inaction.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> Focused vigilance in specific areas by government agencies has also acted as a deterrent to land mafia activities. For example, the land mafia in the <a href="NOIDA" title="wikilink">Noida</a> area, on the outskirts of <a href="Delhi" class="uri" title="wikilink">Delhi</a>, was reported to have illegally begun carving out plots for commercial sale on land identified by the <a href="Central_Zoo_Authority_of_India" title="wikilink">Central Zoo Authority of India</a> as the site for India's first Night Safari park.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> Subsequent to coverage in the press, vigorous legal action by the Greater Noida Authority reportedly led to this mafia alliance backing away from this theft, although it may have shifted its attention to illegally encroaching on land along the planned <a href="Taj_Expressway" title="wikilink">Taj Expressway</a>, connecting Delhi and <a href="Agra" class="uri" title="wikilink">Agra</a>, which is expected to become quite valuable once the highway is inaugurated.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a></p>
