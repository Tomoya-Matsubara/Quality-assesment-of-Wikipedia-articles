<p>The majority of students come from Alabama, although 130 <a href="undergraduate" class="uri" title="wikilink">undergraduate</a> schools from 26 states are represented altogether.

In recent years, Alabama's students have gone on to jobs with major law firms in Birmingham, Atlanta, Nashville, Washington, DC, among many other cities.
