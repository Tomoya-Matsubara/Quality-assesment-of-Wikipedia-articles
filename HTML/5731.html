<p><strong>Joseph Desha</strong> (December 9, 1768 â€“ October 11, 1842) was a <a href="United_States_House_of_Representatives" title="wikilink">U.S. Representative</a> and the <a href="List_of_Governors_of_Kentucky" title="wikilink">ninth</a> <a href="Governor_of_Kentucky" title="wikilink">governor</a> of the <a href="U.S._state" title="wikilink">U.S. state</a> of <a href="Kentucky" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kentucky</a>. After the <a href="Edict_of_Fontainebleau" title="wikilink">revocation of the Edict of Nantes</a>, Desha's <a href="Huguenot" class="uri" title="wikilink">Huguenot</a> ancestors fled from France to <a href="Pennsylvania" class="uri" title="wikilink">Pennsylvania</a>, where Desha was born. Eventually, Desha's family settled near present-day <a href="Gallatin,_Tennessee" title="wikilink">Gallatin, Tennessee</a>, where they were involved in many skirmishes with the <a href="Indigenous_peoples_of_the_Americas" title="wikilink">Indians</a>. Two of Desha's brothers were killed in these encounters, motivating him to volunteer for &quot;Mad&quot; <a href="Anthony_Wayne" title="wikilink">Anthony Wayne</a>'s campaign against the Indians during the <a href="Northwest_Indian_War" title="wikilink">Northwest Indian War</a>. Having by then resettled in <a href="Mason_County,_Kentucky" title="wikilink">Mason County, Kentucky</a>, Desha parlayed his military record into several terms in the <a href="Kentucky_General_Assembly" title="wikilink">state legislature</a>.</p>
<p>In 1807, Desha was elected to the first of six consecutive terms in the U.S. House of Representatives. A <a href="Democratic-Republican_Party" title="wikilink">Democratic-Republican</a>, he was considered a <a href="War_Hawk" title="wikilink">War Hawk</a>, supporting the <a href="War_of_1812" title="wikilink">War of 1812</a>. In 1813, he volunteered to serve in the war and commanded a <a href="Division_(military)" title="wikilink">division</a> at the <a href="Battle_of_the_Thames" title="wikilink">Battle of the Thames</a>. Returning to Congress after the war, he was the only member of the Kentucky congressional delegation to oppose the unpopular <a href="Compensation_Act_of_1816" title="wikilink">Compensation Act of 1816</a>. Nearly every other member of the delegation was defeated for reelection after the vote, but Desha's opposition to the act helped him retain his seat. He did not seek reelection in 1818, and made an unsuccessful run for governor in 1820, losing to <a href="John_Adair" title="wikilink">John Adair</a>. By 1824, the <a href="Panic_of_1819" title="wikilink">Panic of 1819</a> had wrecked Kentucky's economy, and Desha made a second campaign for the governorship almost exclusively on promises of relief for the state's large debtor class. He was elected by a large majority, and debt relief partisans captured both houses of the General Assembly. After the <a href="Kentucky_Court_of_Appeals" title="wikilink">Kentucky Court of Appeals</a> overturned debt relief laws favored by Desha and the majority of the legislature, the legislators abolished the court and created a replacement court, to which Desha appointed several debt relief partisans. The existing court refused to acknowledge the legitimacy of the move, and during a period known as the <a href="Old_Court_&lt;U+2013&gt;_New_Court_controversy" title="wikilink">Old Court &lt;U+2013&gt; New Court controversy</a>, two <a href="court_of_last_resort" title="wikilink">courts of last resort</a> existed in the state.</p>
<p>Although popular when elected, Desha's reputation was damaged by two controversies during his term. The first was his role in the ouster of <a href="Horace_Holley_(1781-1827)" title="wikilink">Horace Holley</a> as president of <a href="Transylvania_University" title="wikilink">Transylvania University</a>. While the religious conservatives on the university's board opposed Holley because they considered him too liberal, Desha's opposition was primarily based on Holley's friendship with <a href="Henry_Clay" title="wikilink">Henry Clay</a>, one of Desha's political enemies. After Desha bitterly denounced Holley in an address to the legislature in late 1825, Holley resigned. Desha's reputation took a further hit after his son, Isaac, was charged with <a href="murder" class="uri" title="wikilink">murder</a>. Partially because of Desha's influence as governor, two guilty verdicts were overturned. After the younger Desha unsuccessfully attempted <a href="suicide" class="uri" title="wikilink">suicide</a> while awaiting a third trial, Governor Desha issued a <a href="clemency" title="wikilink">pardon</a> for his son. These controversies, along with an improving economy, propelled Desha's political foes to victory in the legislative elections of 1825 and 1826. They abolished the so-called &quot;Desha court&quot; over Desha's veto, ending the court controversy. In a final act of defiance, Desha threatened to refuse to vacate the <a href="Old_Governor&#39;s_Mansion_(Frankfort,_Kentucky)" title="wikilink">governor's mansion</a>, although he ultimately acquiesced without incident, ceding the governorship to his successor, <a href="National_Republican_Party_(United_States)" title="wikilink">National Republican</a> <a href="Thomas_Metcalfe_(Kentucky)" title="wikilink">Thomas Metcalfe</a>. At the expiration of his term, he retired from public life and ultimately died at <a href="Payne-Desha_House" title="wikilink">his son's home</a> in <a href="Georgetown,_Kentucky" title="wikilink">Georgetown, Kentucky</a>, on October 11, 1842.</p>

Barry, and <a href="Jesse_Bledsoe" title="wikilink">Jesse Bledsoe</a>.<a href="#fn176" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref176"><sup>176</sup></a> However, Holley's <a href="New_England" title="wikilink">New England</a> <a href="Unitarianism" title="wikilink">Unitarian</a> beliefs were too liberal for the tastes of many in Kentucky.<a href="#fn177" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref177"><sup>177</sup></a> Many called Holley an <a href="infidel" class="uri" title="wikilink">infidel</a> and charged that he was a drinker and a <a href="gambling" title="wikilink">gambler</a>.<a href="#fn178" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref178"><sup>178</sup></a> He was criticized for spending time at the <a href="Horse_racing" title="wikilink">horse races</a> and for furnishing his home with <a href="Art_nude" title="wikilink">nude</a> <a href="Classical_sculpture" title="wikilink">classical statues</a>.<a href="#fn179" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref179"><sup>179</sup></a></p>
<p>Desha was drawn into the Holley controversy during the <a href="United_States_presidential_election,_1824" title="wikilink">1824 presidential election</a>.<a href="#fn180" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref180"><sup>180</sup></a> When no candidate achieved a majority of the electoral votes cast, the contest was resolved by the U.S. House of Representatives. Desha and the New Court partisans in the General Assembly instructed the state's congressional delegation to cast their votes for Andrew Jackson, but the delegation, led by House Speaker Henry Clay, defied these instructions and voted instead for <a href="John_Quincy_Adams" title="wikilink">John Quincy Adams</a>.<a href="#fn181" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref181"><sup>181</sup></a> Because of this vote, Clay, a trustee for Transylvania and supporter of Holley, became Desha's political enemy.<a href="#fn182" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref182"><sup>182</sup></a> Desha's hostility for Transylvania and Holley worsened when, in the aftermath of the Isaac Desha trial, a student at Transylvania delivered a speech critical of the governor in the university's chapel.<a href="#fn183" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref183"><sup>183</sup></a> Although Holley was present for the speech, Transylvania historian John D. Wright, Jr. wrote that he did not know the student's topic beforehand and after hearing the speech, made no effort to condone its content.<a href="#fn184" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref184"><sup>184</sup></a> It was Holley's practice, however, to allow students to speak openly about current political matters, regardless of which position they took.<a href="#fn185" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref185"><sup>185</sup></a> Desha maintained that, because Holley had not silenced the student, he was at fault for tacitly condoning disrespectful criticism of the state's chief executive.<a href="#fn186" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref186"><sup>186</sup></a></p>
<p>Desha vehemently attacked Transylvania and Holley in his annual message to the General Assembly in November 1825.<a href="#fn187" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref187"><sup>187</sup></a> He claimed that the university had not made wise use of the public funding allocated to it by previous Assemblies, noting in particular that Holley's salary as president exceeded his own.<a href="#fn188" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref188"><sup>188</sup></a> Finally, Desha claimed that under Holley, Transylvania had become too elitist and could not be otherwise, given the high cost of attendance.<a href="#fn189" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref189"><sup>189</sup></a><a href="#fn190" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref190"><sup>190</sup></a> Holley, who had traveled to Frankfort to speak with Desha and the legislature, was present for Desha's speech.<a href="#fn191" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref191"><sup>191</sup></a> Afterward, he decided instead to return to Lexington and tender his resignation.<a href="#fn192" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref192"><sup>192</sup></a> Sympathetic members of the university's board of trustees convinced Holley to remain for another year.<a href="#fn193" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref193"><sup>193</sup></a> Kentucky historian James Klotter opined that, with Holley's departure, &quot;perhaps the state's best chance for a world-class university had passed.&quot;<a href="#fn194" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref194"><sup>194</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="gubernatorial-legacy-and-transition">Gubernatorial legacy and transition</h3>
<p>The numerous controversies of Desha's term severely damaged his reputation.<a href="#fn195" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref195"><sup>195</sup></a> Harrison recorded that a visitor to Kentucky remarked in 1825, &quot;[Desha] is said by some to possess talents; I have never been furnished with evidence.&quot;<a href="#fn196" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref196"><sup>196</sup></a> Harrison further noted that &quot;[b]y 1828, many Kentuckians would have agreed with that assessment.&quot;<a href="#fn197" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref197"><sup>197</sup></a></p>
<p>Desha supported William T. Barry, the Democratic-Republican gubernatorial nominee, to succeed him.<a href="#fn198" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref198"><sup>198</sup></a> Early reports showed Barry leading his opponent, <a href="National_Republican_Party_(United_States)" title="wikilink">National Republican</a> <a href="Thomas_Metcalfe_(Kentucky)" title="wikilink">Thomas Metcalfe</a>, but the final margin favored Metcalfe.<a href="#fn199" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref199"><sup>199</sup></a> Not only did Desha not agree with Metcalfe politically, he believed that the governorship should go to a high-born aristocrat.<a href="#fn200" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref200"><sup>200</sup></a> Although Metcalfe was the son of a Revolutionary War soldier, his nickname of &quot;Old Stone Hammer&quot; indicated his pride in his trade of <a href="masonry" class="uri" title="wikilink">masonry</a>, which was considered a common profession.<a href="#fn201" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref201"><sup>201</sup></a></p>
<p>Due to a constitutional quirk, Metcalfe's term was scheduled to begin eight days before the expiration of Desha's.<a href="#fn202" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref202"><sup>202</sup></a> Desha charged that Metcalfe was not allowing him to finish out his term and threatened not to vacate the governor's mansion until his term officially ended.<a href="#fn203" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref203"><sup>203</sup></a> Clark records as legend that, after drinking heavily at a local tavern, Metcalfe and some of his supporters formed a mob and went to the governor's mansion to evict him by force.<a href="#fn204" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref204"><sup>204</sup></a> Accounts in the local newspapers of the time instead record that the Deshas left the mansion peacefully without intervention by Metcalfe.<a href="#fn205" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref205"><sup>205</sup></a></p>
