<p>The <strong>1991 Hamlet chicken plant fire</strong> took place at the <a href="Imperial_Foods" title="wikilink">Imperial Foods</a> chicken processing plant in <a href="Hamlet,_North_Carolina" title="wikilink">Hamlet</a>, <a href="North_Carolina" title="wikilink">North Carolina</a>, <a href="United_States" title="wikilink">U.S.</a>, on <a href="September_3" title="wikilink">September 3</a>, <a href="1991" class="uri" title="wikilink">1991</a> after a faulty repair to a hydraulic line. Twenty-five people were killed and fifty-four injured after being trapped behind locked fire doors. The fire resulted in the owner receiving a 20-year <a href="prison" class="uri" title="wikilink">prison</a> <a href="Sentence_(law)" title="wikilink">sentence</a>, and the plant never reopened. However, the investigation has also highlighted failings in the authoritive enforcement of existing regulations, and has resulted in a number of safety laws being passed.</p>

There had been no safety inspections by the state due to a lack of inspectors.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> However, the poultry inspector had visited the site daily, and was aware of the various fire violations as well as the fact that much of the chicken meat was found to be rotten, and that the reason it was processed into <a href="chicken_nuggets" title="wikilink">chicken nuggets</a> was to disguise the foul taste. However, for unknown reasons, he did not report these violations.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a><a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> The factory had had three previous non-fatal fires, but despite this, no action was taken to prevent recurrence or to unlock the doors.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> Some workers were made nervous by the locked doors, but did not voice their concerns for fear of losing their jobs.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<p>The company always had a poor safety record, although it had had no previous fatal accidents. It was cited in the 1980s after safety violations in its plant at <a href="Moosic" class="uri" title="wikilink">Moosic</a>, <a href="Pennsylvania" class="uri" title="wikilink">Pennsylvania</a> were discovered. These included poorly marked or blocked emergency exits.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> The offending factory had been closed by the time of the fire. Also, in its plant at <a href="Cumming,_Georgia" title="wikilink">Cumming</a>, <a href="Georgia_(U.S._state)" title="wikilink">Georgia</a>, it had two major fires, one of which, in <a href="1989" class="uri" title="wikilink">1989</a>, caused <a href="United_States_Dollar" title="wikilink">$</a>1.2 million worth of damage.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>

The plant tended to have a workload of one hundred chickens a minute, and this high rate of speed kept temperatures low, leading to many workers contracting <a href="parrot_fever" title="wikilink">parrot fever</a>, a type of <a href="pneumonia" class="uri" title="wikilink">pneumonia</a><a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> There was also a high rate of repetitive motion injuries, and an average of 23% of workers fell seriously ill or were badly injured every year.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
<p>There was a general lack of flammable materials throughout the complex, other than some packing materials towards the rear, so an extensive fire was considered unlikely.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> As a result, there were open spaces between rooms in place of doors, to allow for easy access by <a href="forklift_truck" title="wikilink">forklift trucks</a>. The only barrier to any of these was curtains of plastic strips between some, to hold in refrigerated air.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> This allowed for rapid spread of smoke and heat in the deadly blaze. Also, the building's previous use as an ice cream production facility meant that the walls and floor were hard, smooth surfaces, which would severely limit the amount of material that was availible to absorb heat and smoke during the fire.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> The plant had been hit by fires before Imperial took over as well, although these, too, were non-fatal.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>

There were no <a href="sprinkler" title="wikilink">sprinklers</a> in the building,<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> so the fire spread rapidly, causing trauma-related injuries to some of the survivors as they rushed to escape.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> Large quantities of thick, acrid smoke were produced by a combination of burning <a href="soybean_oil" title="wikilink">soybean oil</a> and chicken, and melting roof insulation. One worker later described being overtaken by this smoke while running at full speed to the rear of the facility.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> The smoke was later found to be <a href="hydrocarbon" class="uri" title="wikilink">hydrocarbon</a>-charged, and therefore had the potential to disable someone within a few breaths.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> The facility also contained a quantity of <a href="asbestos" class="uri" title="wikilink">asbestos</a>, and had no <a href="fire_alarm" title="wikilink">fire alarm</a> system to warn workers further back in the plant.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a><a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> Several gas lines embedded in the ceiling also caught fire and exploded.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a></p>

The bay was originally blocked by a <a href="tractor-trailer_truck" title="wikilink">tractor-trailer truck</a>, but three workers went into the rear of the truck and pounded on the walls until they were heard by rescuers, who moved the vehicle.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> Others were able to escape when several workers managed to break open a few of the doors, although for many the open doors came too late.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> The injured were sent to several different hospitals for treatment for their injuries. One of the deceased worked for an external company and was resuplying the on-site vending machines; no-one even realised he was inside the plant until the company he worked for reported his truck as missing.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> The fire remains the worst disaster ever to strike North Carolina.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="emergency-response">Emergency response</h2>

Click image to enlarge." /> The emergency response was slow to start because the telephones inside the building could not be used, so the owner's son drove down to the fire station and informed them there that the factory was on fire, but neglected to say that workers were still in the plant.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> Over 100 medical and emergency service personnel attended the scene,<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> some of whom ran from a local hospital, and nearby towns provided <a href="air_ambulance" title="wikilink">emergency evacuation for the wounded via four helicoptors</a> from the local hospital to nearby burns units, although they did not attend the scene itself.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> The emergency response has, however, come under heavy criticism in the aftermath of the blaze. Fire Chief Fuller, in charge of the emergency response, refused help several times from nearby Dobbins Heights fire department, located just five minutes drive away. The department was comprised of <a href="African-American" class="uri" title="wikilink">African-American</a> <a href="Volunteer_fire_department" title="wikilink">volunteers</a>, and there have been allegations that there was racial prejudice on the part of the <a href="Fire_Chief" title="wikilink">Fire Chief</a>, especially since the workers were also of an ethnic minority.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> However, Fuller has defended his decision, saying at the time he refused assistance he did not realize the doors were locked, and adding &quot;In a fire like this you need good, seasoned people.&quot;<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> Witnesses have also said that there were only two oxygen tanks on site, hopelessly inadequate for the large number of casualties.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a></p>
<p>For the purposes of the investigation, Fuller was asked to evaluate the emergency response. He told investigators that he felt there were &quot;more than adequate numbers of personnel and equipment given the layout of the incident site.&quot;<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="immediate-aftermath">Immediate aftermath</h2>

A spokesman for the company admitted that &quot;certain doors&quot; in the plant were locked at &quot;certain times&quot;, but refused to elaborate on which doors.<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> Clark Staten, of the <a href="Emergency_Response_and_Research_Institute" title="wikilink">Emergency Response and Research Institute</a> in <a href="Chicago" class="uri" title="wikilink">Chicago</a> said in response to the blaze, &quot;If the initial reports can be believed, this is an intolerable set of circumstances that should result in criminal charges being placed against those responsible for having the fire doors locked... Our past experience with fires and fire deaths shows that we must ensure an adequate number of open exits from any occupied building...

<p>The Imperial processing facility in Cumming, Georgia was shut down for 24 hours immediately after the fire, when a resulting inspection by the <a href="Occupational_Safety_and_Health_Administration" title="wikilink">Occupational Safety and Health Administration</a> found an inoperative sprinkler system, &quot;improper&quot; fire exits and a total lack of any kind of <a href="evacuation_plan" title="wikilink">evacuation plan</a>.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a> Imperial Foods were told that the plant posed an &quot;imminent danger&quot; to workers because it lacked an automatic fire extinguisher over the cooker similar to the one installed in the Hamlet plant, which failed to prevent the disaster, but did prevent the oil in the vat from catching fire.<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a><a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a></p>

<p>An investigation was immediately launched by state investigators, who were joined one month later by federal ones.<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a> Investigators found indentations left on at least one door by people attempting to kick it down.<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a> They also discovered concentrations of bodies around <a href="fire_exits" title="wikilink">fire exits</a>.<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a> There was also a concentration inside a large <a href="walk_in_freezer" title="wikilink">walk in freezer</a>, where panicked workers had sought shelter.

Note the seperated end connector lying on the bench" alt="width=250px|thumb|The remains of the failed hydraulic line. Note the seperated end connector lying on the bench" />The fire was caused by failure of a <a href="hydraulic" class="uri" title="wikilink">hydraulic</a> line, which powered a <a href="conveyor_belt" title="wikilink">conveyor belt</a> which supplied the cooker vat. The original line had developed a leak, so it was replaced by a maintenance worker. The line it was to be replaced with was a <a href="mass_production" title="wikilink">mass produced</a> factory line, and was longer than was necessary, causing it to snake across the floor in a fashion that was determined to pose a hazard of tripping.<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a> The worker therefore requested and received permission to cut the line down to the required size. He did so, and then replaced the factory end connector with the original end connector from the failed line, before recoupling the line to the conveyor.<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a> The line was rated to 3,000 psi, while normal operating pressure never fluctuated higher than 1,500 psi.<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a> When the line was brought up to normal operating pressure, the line separated from this end connector at somewhere between 800 and 1,500 psi, and <a href="hydraulic_fluid" title="wikilink">hydraulic fluid</a> was forced out at this pressure at an elevation of four to six feet above the concrete floor.<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a> This fluid spattered onto the heating plumbs for the cooker, and was immediately vaporised. This vapour then went directly into the flame of the gas-fired cooker.<a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a> The vapor had a relatively low <a href="flashpoint" class="uri" title="wikilink">flashpoint</a>, and erupted into a fireball.<a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a> The ruptured hydraulic line went on to pump a total of fifty to fifty-five <a href="gallon" title="wikilink">gallons</a> of hydraulic fluid into the fire before electrical failure shut it down.<a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a></p>
<p>A state-of-the-art automatic <a href="carbon_dioxide" title="wikilink">carbon dioxide</a> <a href="fire_extinguisher" title="wikilink">fire extinguisher</a> designed to cope with such fires had been installed over the vat after a non-fatal fire in <a href="1983" class="uri" title="wikilink">1983</a> at the fire department's request.

<p>Some of the blame was also laid upon the authorities. The state Labor Secretary at the time, <a href="John_Brooks" title="wikilink">John Brooks</a>, blamed his department's failure to inspect the plant on shortage of money and staff, but also blamed Federal government for not enforcing stricter standards.<a href="#fn69" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref69"><sup>69</sup></a></p>

Many of the workers and their families wanted the Rev. <a href="Jesse_Jackson" title="wikilink">Jesse Jackson</a> to speak in the city's memorial effort. But then mayor <a href="Abbie_Covington" title="wikilink">Abbie Covington</a> didn't want him involved, and was backed up by many other local authority figures.<a href="#fn90" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref90"><sup>90</sup></a> The argument is often seen as being discriminatory on the grounds of race or class.<a href="#fn91" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref91"><sup>91</sup></a> The result was that a group of the survivors held their own service, separate to that provided by the authorities, which included Jesse. Both services unveiled near-identical monuments, which are situated just 50 <a href="yard" title="wikilink">yards</a> from each other.<a href="#fn92" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref92"><sup>92</sup></a></p>
<p>Many firefighters also suffered psychological problems after the fire, as due to the small size of the community many of the firefighters knew some or all of the victims. Fifty to sixty of them attended counseling sessions as a result.<a href="#fn93" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref93"><sup>93</sup></a></p>
<p>A memorial service was held in <a href="2000" class="uri" title="wikilink">2000</a>, but by then many survivors had passed away, mostly due to complications from their injuries.<a href="#fn94" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref94"><sup>94</sup></a> The burned-out shell of the factory remained for many years, but eventually it was bulldozed by the state in <a href="2001" class="uri" title="wikilink">2001</a>, after they declared it &quot;a public health nuisance&quot;, due to the <a href="psychology" title="wikilink">psychological</a> impact it had on the victims, many of whom still lived within sight of the structure.<a href="#fn95" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref95"><sup>95</sup></a></p>
