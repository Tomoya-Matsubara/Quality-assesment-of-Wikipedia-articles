<p>Rights which are considered essential or fundamental for the well-being of a person are called Fundamental Rights.The <strong>Fundamental Rights in India</strong> enshrined in the Part III of the <a href="Constitution_of_India" title="wikilink">Constitution of India</a> guarantee <a href="civil_liberty" title="wikilink">civil liberties</a> such that all Indians can lead their lives in peace and harmony as <a href="Indian_nationality_law" title="wikilink">citizens of India</a>. These include individual rights common to most <a href="liberal_democracy" title="wikilink">liberal democracies</a>, such as equality before law, <a href="freedom_of_speech" title="wikilink">freedom of speech</a> and <a href="freedom_of_expression" title="wikilink">expression</a>, freedom of association and peaceful assembly, freedom to practice religion, and the right to constitutional remedies for the protection of civil rights by means of <a href="writ" title="wikilink">writs</a> such as <a href="habeas_corpus" title="wikilink">habeas corpus</a>. Violations of these rights result in punishments as prescribed in the <a href="Indian_Penal_Code" title="wikilink">Indian Penal Code</a>, subject to discretion of the <a href="judiciary" class="uri" title="wikilink">judiciary</a>. The Fundamental Rights are defined as basic <a href="Human_rights" title="wikilink">human freedoms</a> which every Indian citizen has the right to enjoy for a proper and harmonious development of personality. These rights universally apply to all citizens, irrespective of <a href="Race_(classification_of_human_beings)" title="wikilink">race</a>, place of birth, <a href="religion" class="uri" title="wikilink">religion</a>, <a href="caste" class="uri" title="wikilink">caste</a>, <a href="creed" class="uri" title="wikilink">creed</a>, <a href="Coloured" title="wikilink">colour</a> or <a href="Gender" title="wikilink">sex</a>. They are enforceable by the <a href="court" title="wikilink">courts</a>, subject to certain restrictions. The Rights have their origins in many sources, including <a href="Bill_of_Rights_1689" title="wikilink">England's Bill of Rights</a>, the <a href="United_States_Bill_of_Rights" title="wikilink">United States Bill of Rights</a> and <a href="Declaration_of_the_Rights_of_Man_and_of_the_Citizen" title="wikilink">France's Declaration of the Rights of Man</a>.</p>
<p>The six fundamental rights are:<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<ol>
<li>Right to equality</li>
<li>Right to freedom</li>
<li>Right against exploitation</li>
<li>Right to <a href="Status_of_religious_freedom_in_India" title="wikilink">freedom of religion</a></li>
<li>Cultural and educational rights</li>
<li>Right to constitutional remedies</li>
</ol>
<p><a href="Human_rights" title="wikilink">Rights</a> literally mean those freedoms which are essential for personal good as well as the good of the community. The rights guaranteed under the <a href="Constitution_of_India" title="wikilink">Constitution of India</a> are fundamental as they have been incorporated into the <em>Fundamental Law of the Land</em> and are enforceable in a court of law. However, this does not mean that they are absolute or that they are immune from <a href="Constitution_of_India#Amendments" title="wikilink">Constitutional amendment</a>.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>Fundamental rights for Indians have also been aimed at overturning the inequalities of pre-independence social practices. Specifically, they have also been used to abolish <a href="untouchability" class="uri" title="wikilink">untouchability</a> and hence prohibit discrimination on the grounds of religion, race, caste, sex, or place of birth. They also forbid trafficking of human beings and <a href="Unfree_labour" title="wikilink">forced labour</a>. They also protect cultural and educational rights of ethnic and religious <a href="minorities" class="uri" title="wikilink">minorities</a> by allowing them to preserve their languages and also establish and administer their own education institutions.</p>
<h2 id="genesis">Genesis</h2>

<p>The development of constitutionally guaranteed fundamental human rights in India was inspired by historical examples such as <a href="Bill_of_Rights_1689" title="wikilink">England's Bill of Rights</a> (1689), the <a href="United_States_Bill_of_Rights" title="wikilink">United States Bill of Rights</a> (approved on 17 September 1787, final ratification on 15 December 1791) and <a href="Declaration_of_the_Rights_of_Man_and_of_the_Citizen" title="wikilink">France's Declaration of the Rights of Man</a> (created during the <a href="French_Revolution" title="wikilink">revolution of 1789</a>, and ratified on 26 August 1789).<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> Under the educational system of <a href="British_Raj" title="wikilink">British Raj</a>, students were exposed to ideas of democracy, human rights and European political history. The Indian student community in England was further inspired by the workings of <a href="parliamentary_democracy" title="wikilink">parliamentary democracy</a> and British political parties.</p>

<p>In 1919, the <a href="Rowlatt_Acts" title="wikilink">Rowlatt Acts</a> gave extensive powers to the British government and police, and allowed indefinite arrest and detention of individuals, warrant-less searches and seizures, restrictions on public gatherings, and intensive censorship of media and publications. The public opposition to this act eventually led to <a href="Non-Cooperation_Movement" title="wikilink">mass campaigns of non-violent civil disobedience</a> throughout the country demanding guaranteed civil freedoms, and limitations on government power. Indians, who were seeking independence and their own government, were particularly influenced by the independence of Ireland and the development of the Irish constitution. Also, the directive principles of state policy in Irish constitution were looked upon by the people of India as an inspiration for the independent India's government to comprehensively tackle complex social and economic challenges across a vast, diverse nation and population.</p>
<p>In 1928, the <a href="Nehru_Report" title="wikilink">Nehru Commission</a> composing of representatives of Indian political parties proposed constitutional reforms for India that apart from calling for <a href="dominion" class="uri" title="wikilink">dominion</a> status for India and elections under universal suffrage, would guarantee rights deemed fundamental, representation for religious and ethnic minorities, and limit the powers of the government. In 1931, the <a href="Indian_National_Congress" title="wikilink">Indian National Congress</a> (the largest Indian political party of the time) adopted resolutions committing itself to the defense of fundamental civil rights, as well as socio-economic rights such as the <a href="minimum_wage" title="wikilink">minimum wage</a> and the abolition of <a href="untouchability" class="uri" title="wikilink">untouchability</a> and <a href="serfdom" class="uri" title="wikilink">serfdom</a>.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> Committing themselves to <a href="socialism" class="uri" title="wikilink">socialism</a> in 1936, the Congress leaders took examples from the <a href="Constitution_of_the_Soviet_Union" title="wikilink">constitution of the erstwhile USSR</a>, which inspired the fundamental duties of citizens as a means of collective patriotic responsibility for national interests and challenges.</p>
<p>When India obtained independence on 15 August 1947, the task of developing a constitution for the nation was undertaken by the <a href="Constituent_Assembly_of_India" title="wikilink">Constituent Assembly of India</a>, composing of elected representatives under the presidency of <a href="Rajendra_Prasad" title="wikilink">Rajendra Prasad</a>. While members of Congress composed of a large majority, Congress leaders appointed persons from diverse political backgrounds to responsibilities of developing the constitution and national laws.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> Notably, <a href="Bhimrao_Ramji_Ambedkar" title="wikilink">Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar</a> became the chairperson of the drafting committee, while <a href="Jawaharlal_Nehru" title="wikilink">Jawaharlal Nehru</a> and <a href="Sardar_Vallabhbhai_Patel" title="wikilink">Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel</a> became chairpersons of committees and sub-committees responsible for different subjects. A notable development during that period having significant effect on the Indian constitution took place on 10 December 1948 when the <a href="United_Nations" title="wikilink">United Nations</a> <a href="United_Nations_General_Assembly" title="wikilink">General Assembly</a> adopted the <a href="Universal_Declaration_of_Human_Rights" title="wikilink">Universal Declaration of Human Rights</a> and called upon all member states to adopt these rights in their respective constitutions.</p>
<p>The Fundamental Rights were included in the Ist Draft Constitution (February 1948), the IInd Draft Constitution (17 October 1948) and the IIIrd and final Draft Constitution (26 November 1949), being prepared by the <a href="Constitution_of_India#History" title="wikilink">Drafting Committee</a>.</p>
<h2 id="significance-and-characteristics">Significance and characteristics</h2>
<p>The Fundamental Rights were included in the constitution because they were considered essential for the development of the personality of every individual and to preserve human dignity. The writers of the constitution regarded democracy of no avail if civil liberties, like freedom of speech and religion were not recognized and protected by the State.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> According to them, &quot;democracy&quot; is, in essence, a government by opinion and therefore, the means of formulating public opinion should be secured to the people of a democratic nation. For this purpose, the constitution guaranteed to all the citizens of India the freedom of speech and expression and various other freedoms in the form of the Fundamental Rights.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>

<p>All people, irrespective of race, religion, caste or sex, have been given the right to move the <a href="Supreme_Court_of_India" title="wikilink">Supreme Court</a> and the <a href="High_Courts_of_India" title="wikilink">High Courts</a> for the enforcement of their Fundamental Rights. It is not necessary that the aggrieved party has to be the one to do so. Poverty stricken people may not have the means to do so and therefore, in the public interest, anyone can commence litigation in the court on their behalf. This is known as &quot;<a href="Public_interest_litigation" title="wikilink">Public interest litigation</a>&quot;.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> In some cases, High Court judges have acted on their own on the basis of newspaper reports.</p>
<p>These Fundamental Rights help not only in protection but also the prevention of gross violations of human rights. They emphasize on the fundamental unity of India by guaranteeing to all citizens the access and use of the same facilities, irrespective of background. Some Fundamental Rights apply for persons of any nationality whereas others are available only to the citizens of India. The right to life and personal liberty is available to all people and so is the right to freedom of religion. On the other hand, <a href="Freedom_of_speech" title="wikilink">freedoms of speech</a> and <a href="Freedom_of_expression" title="wikilink">expression</a> and freedom to reside and settle in any part of the country are reserved to citizens alone, including <a href="Non-resident_Indian" title="wikilink">non-resident Indian citizens</a>.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> The right to equality in matters of public employment cannot be conferred to <a href="Indian_nationality_law#Overseas_citizenship_of_India" title="wikilink">overseas citizens of India</a>.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<p>Fundamental rights primarily protect individuals from any arbitrary state actions, but some rights are enforceable against individuals.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> For instance, the Constitution abolishes <a href="untouchability" class="uri" title="wikilink">untouchability</a> and also prohibits <em><a href="Unfree_labour" title="wikilink">begar</a></em>. These provisions act as a check both on state action as well as the action of private individuals. However, these rights are not absolute or uncontrolled and are subject to reasonable restrictions as necessary for the protection of general welfare. They can also be selectively curtailed. The Supreme Court has ruled<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> that all provisions of the Constitution, including Fundamental Rights can be amended. However, the <a href="Parliament_of_India" title="wikilink">Parliament</a> cannot alter the basic structure of the constitution. Features such as <a href="secularism" class="uri" title="wikilink">secularism</a> and <a href="democracy" class="uri" title="wikilink">democracy</a> fall under this category. Since the Fundamental Rights can only be altered by a <a href="Constitution_of_India#Amendments" title="wikilink">constitutional amendment</a>, their inclusion is a check not only on the <a href="Executive_(government)" title="wikilink">executive branch</a>, but also on the <a href="Parliament_of_India" title="wikilink">Parliament</a> and state legislatures.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<p>A <a href="State_of_Emergency_in_India" title="wikilink">state of national emergency</a> has an adverse effect on these rights. Under such a state, the rights conferred by Article 19 (freedoms of speech, assembly and movement, etc.) remain suspended. Hence, in such a situation, the legislature may make laws which go against the rights given in Article 19. Also, the <a href="President_of_India" title="wikilink">President</a> may by order suspend the right to move court for the enforcement of other rights as well.</p>
<h2 id="right-to-equality">Right to equality</h2>
<p>Right to equality is an important right provided for in Articles 14, 15, 16, 17 and 18 of the constitution. It is the principal foundation of all other rights and liberties, and guarantees the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Equality before law: Article 14 of the constitution guarantees that all citizens shall be equally protected by the laws of the country. It means that the State<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> cannot discriminate against a citizen on the basis of caste, creed, colour, sex, religion or place of birth.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> According to the <em>Electricity Act</em> of 26 January 2003 the Parliament has the power to create special courts<ref></li>
</ul>

<p></ref> for the speedy trial of offences committed by persons holding high offices. Creation of special courts is not a violation of this right.</p>
<ul>
<li>Social equality and equal access to public areas: Article 15 of the constitution states that no person shall be discriminated on the basis of caste, colour, language etc. Every person shall have equal access to public places like public parks, museums, wells, bathing ghats and temples etc. However, the State may make any special provision for women and children. Special provisions may be made for the advancements of any socially or educationally backward class or <a href="scheduled_castes" title="wikilink">scheduled castes</a> or <a href="scheduled_tribes" title="wikilink">scheduled tribes</a>.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Equality in matters of public employment: Article 16 of the constitution lays down that the State cannot discriminate against anyone in the matters of employment. All citizens can apply for government jobs. There are some exceptions. The Parliament may enact a law stating that certain jobs can only be filled by applicants who are domiciled in the area. This may be meant for posts that require knowledge of the locality and language of the area. The State may also reserve posts for members of backward classes, scheduled castes or scheduled tribes which are not adequately represented in the services under the State to bring up the weaker sections of the society. Also, there a law may be passed which requires that the holder of an office of any religious institution shall also be a person professing that particular religion.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> According to the <em>Citizenship (Amendment) Bill</em>, 2003, this right shall not be conferred to <a href="Indian_nationality_law#Overseas_citizenship_of_India" title="wikilink">Overseas citizens of India</a>.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Abolition of untouchability: Article 17 of the constitution abolishes the practice of <a href="untouchability" class="uri" title="wikilink">untouchability</a>. Practice of untouchability is an offense and anyone doing so is punishable by law.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> The <em>Untouchability Offences Act</em> of 1955 (renamed to <em>Protection of Civil Rights Act</em> in 1976) provided penalties for preventing a person from entering a place of worship or from taking water from a tank or well.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Abolition of Titles: Article 18 of the constitution prohibits the State from conferring any titles. Citizens of India cannot accept titles from a foreign State.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> The British government had created an aristocratic class known as <em>Rai Bahadurs</em> and <em>Khan Bahadurs</em> in India — these titles were also abolished. However, <a href="Military_rank" title="wikilink">Military</a> and <a href="Academic_rank" title="wikilink">academic</a> distinctions can be conferred on the citizens of India. The awards of <em><a href="Bharat_Ratna" title="wikilink">Bharat Ratna</a></em> and <em><a href="Padma_Vibhushan" title="wikilink">Padma Vibhushan</a></em> cannot be used by the recipient as a title and do not, accordingly, come within the constitutional prohibition&quot;.<ref></li>
</ul>

<p></ref> The Supreme Court, on 15 December 1995, upheld the validity of such awards.</p>
<h2 id="right-to-freedom">Right to freedom</h2>
<p>The Constitution of India contains the right to freedom, given in articles 19, 20, 21 and 22, with the view of guaranteeing individual rights that were considered vital by the framers of the constitution. The right to freedom in Article 19 guarantees the following six freedoms:<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="Freedom_of_speech" title="wikilink">Freedom of speech</a> and <a href="Freedom_of_expression" title="wikilink">expression</a>, which enable an individual to participate in public activities. The phrase, &quot;<a href="freedom_of_press" title="wikilink">freedom of press</a>&quot; has not been used in Article 19, but freedom of expression includes freedom of press. Reasonable restrictions can be imposed in the interest of public order, security of State, decency or morality.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Freedom to assemble peacefully without arms, on which the State can impose reasonable restrictions in the interest of public order and the sovereignty and integrity of India.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Freedom to form associations or unions on which the State can impose reasonable restrictions on this freedom in the interest of public order, morality and the sovereignty and integrity of India.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Freedom to move freely throughout the territory of India though reasonable restrictions can be imposed on this right in the interest of the general public, for example, restrictions may be imposed on movement and travelling, so as to control <a href="epidemic" title="wikilink">epidemics</a>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Freedom to reside and settle in any part of the territory of India which is also subject to reasonable restrictions by the State in the interest of the general public or for the protection of the <a href="scheduled_tribes" title="wikilink">scheduled tribes</a> because certain safeguards as are envisaged here seem to be justified to protect indigenous and tribal peoples from exploitation and coercion.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> <a href="Article_370" title="wikilink">Article 370</a> restricts citizens from other Indian states and Kashmiri women who marry men from other states from purchasing land or <a href="Real_property" title="wikilink">property</a> in <a href="Jammu_&amp;_Kashmir" title="wikilink">Jammu &amp; Kashmir</a>.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Freedom to practice any profession or to carry on any occupation, trade or business on which the State may impose reasonable restrictions in the interest of the general public. Thus, there is no right to carry on a business which is dangerous or immoral. Also, professional or technical qualifications may be prescribed for practicing any profession or carrying on any trade.</li>
</ul>
<p>The constitution also guarantees the right to life and personal liberty, which in turn cites specific provisions in which these rights are applied and enforced:</p>
<ul>
<li>Protection with respect to conviction for offences is guaranteed in the right to life and personal liberty. According to Article 20, no one can be awarded punishment which is more than what the law of the land prescribes at that time. This legal axiom is based on the principle that no criminal law can be made retrospective, that is, for an act to become an offence, the essential condition is that it should have been an offence legally at the time of committing it. Moreover, no person accused of any offence shall be compelled to be a witness against himself. &quot;Compulsion&quot; in this article refers to what in law is called &quot;<a href="Duress" class="uri" title="wikilink">Duress</a>&quot; (injury, beating or unlawful imprisonment to make a person do something that he does not want to do). This article is known as a safeguard against self incrimination. The other principle enshrined in this article is known as the principle of <a href="double_jeopardy" title="wikilink">double jeopardy</a>, that is, no person can be convicted twice for the same offence, which has been derived from Anglo Saxon law. This principle was first established in the <a href="Magna_Carta" title="wikilink">Magna Carta</a>.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Protection of life and personal liberty is also stated under right to life and personal liberty. Article 21 declares that no citizen can be denied his life and liberty except by law.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> This means that a person's life and personal liberty can only be disputed if that person has committed a crime. However, the <a href="right_to_life" title="wikilink">right to life</a> does not include the <a href="right_to_die" title="wikilink">right to die</a>, and hence, <a href="suicide" class="uri" title="wikilink">suicide</a> or an attempt thereof, is an offence. (Attempted suicide being interpreted as a crime has seen many debates. The Supreme Court of India gave a landmark ruling in the year 1994. The court repealed section 309 of the Indian penal code, under which people attempting suicide could face prosecution and prison terms of up to one year.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> In the year 1996 however another Supreme Court ruling nullified the earlier one. <a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a>) &quot;Personal liberty&quot; includes all the freedoms which are not included in Article 19 (that is, the six freedoms). The right to travel abroad is also covered under &quot;personal liberty&quot; in Article 21.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>In 2002, through the 86th Amendment Act, Article 21(A) was incorporated. It made the right to primary education part of the right to freedom, stating that the State would provide free and compulsory education to children from six to fourteen years of age.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> Six years after an amendment was made in the Indian Constitution, the union cabinet cleared the Right to Education Bill in 2008. It is now soon to be tabled in Parliament for approval before it makes a fundamental right of every child to get free and compulsory education. <a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Rights of a person arrested under ordinary circumstances is laid down in the right to life and personal liberty. No one can be arrested without being told the grounds for his arrest. If arrested the person has the right to defend himself by a <a href="lawyer" class="uri" title="wikilink">lawyer</a> of his choice. Also an arrested citizen has to be brought before the nearest <a href="magistrate" class="uri" title="wikilink">magistrate</a> within 24 hours. The rights of a person arrested under ordinary circumstances are not available to an enemy alien. They are also not available to persons detained under the <em>Preventive Detention Act</em>. Under <a href="preventive_detention" title="wikilink">preventive detention</a>, the government can imprison a person for a maximum of three months. It means that if the government feels that a person being at liberty can be a threat to the law and order or to the unity and integrity of the nation, it can detain or arrest that person to prevent him from doing this possible harm. After three months such a case is brought before an advisory board for review.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a></li>
</ul>
<p>The constitution also imposes restrictions on these rights. The government restricts these freedoms in the interest of the independence, sovereignty and integrity of India. In the interest of morality and public order, the government can also impose restrictions. However, the right to life and personal liberty cannot be suspended. The six freedoms are also automatically suspended or have restrictions imposed on them during a state of emergency.</p>
<h2 id="right-against-exploitation">Right against exploitation</h2>
<p><img src="ChildLabor1910.png" title="fig:Child labour and Begar is prohibited under Right against exploitation." alt="Child labour and Begar is prohibited under Right against exploitation." width="180" /> The right against exploitation, given in Articles 23 and 24, provides for two provisions, namely the abolition of trafficking in human beings and <a href="Unfree_labor" title="wikilink"><em>Begar</em></a> (forced labor),<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> and abolition of employment of children below the age of 14 years in dangerous jobs like factories and mines. <a href="Child_labour" title="wikilink">Child labour</a> is considered a gross violation of the spirit and provisions of the constitution.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> <em><a href="Unfree_labour" title="wikilink">Begar</a></em>, practised in the past by landlords, has been declared a crime and is punishable by law. Trafficking in humans for the purpose of <a href="slave_trade" title="wikilink">slave trade</a> or <a href="prostitution" class="uri" title="wikilink">prostitution</a> is also prohibited by law. An exception is made in employment without payment for compulsory services for public purposes. Compulsory military <a href="conscription" class="uri" title="wikilink">conscription</a> is covered by this provision.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="right-to-freedom-of-religion">Right to freedom of religion</h2>
<p>Right to freedom of <a href="religion" class="uri" title="wikilink">religion</a>, covered in Articles 25, 26, 27 and 28, provides <a href="religious_freedom" title="wikilink">religious freedom</a> to all citizens of India. The objective of this right is to sustain the principle of <a href="secularism" class="uri" title="wikilink">secularism</a> in India. According to the Constitution, all religions are equal before the State and no religion shall be given preference over the other. Citizens are free to preach, practice and propagate any religion of their choice. However, certain practices like wearing and carrying of <em><a href="Kirpan" title="wikilink">Kirpans</a></em> in the profession of the <a href="Sikhism" title="wikilink">Sikh religion</a>, can be restricted in the interest of public order, morality and health.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a></p>
<p>Religious communities can set up charitable institutions of their own. However, activities in such institutions which are not religious are performed according to the laws laid down by the government. Establishing a charitable institution can also be restricted in the interest of public order, morality and health.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> No person shall be compelled to pay taxes for the promotion of a particular religion.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> A State run institution cannot impart education that is pro-religion.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> Also, nothing in this article shall affect the operation of any existing law or prevent the State from making any further law regulating or restricting any economic, financial, political or other secular activity which may be associated with religious practice, or providing for social welfare and reform.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a></p>
<p>The right to feedom of religion gives the following freedoms: 1.to practise any religon, 2.to follow it according to their specific ways and 3.to preach it.</p>
<p>The only limitation imposed on this fundamental right is that nothing should be done to malign or incite voilence among the followers of other religion.</p>

<p>As India is a country of many <a href="languages_of_India" title="wikilink">languages</a>, <a href="religion_in_India" title="wikilink">religions</a>, and <a href="culture_of_India" title="wikilink">cultures</a>, the Constitution provides special measures, in Articles 29 and 30, to protect the rights of the minorities. Any community which has a language and a script of its own has the right to conserve and develop them. No citizen can be discriminated against for admission in State or State aided institutions.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a></p>
<p>All minorities, religious or linguistic, can set up their own educational institutions in order to preserve and develop their own culture. In granting aid to institutions, the State cannot discriminate against any institution on the basis of the fact that it is administered by a minority institution.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> But the right to administer does not mean that the State can not interfere in case of maladministration. In a precedent-setting judgment in 1980, the Supreme Court held that &quot;the State can certainly take regulatory measures to promote the efficiency and excellence of educational standards. It can also issue guidelines for ensuring the security of the services of the teachers or other employees of the institution. In another landmark judgement delivered on 31 October 2002, the Supreme Court ruled that in case of aided minority institutions offering professional courses, admission could only be through a common entrance test conducted by State or a university. Even an unaided minority institution ought not to ignore the merit of the students for admission.</p>
<h2 id="right-to-constitutional-remedies">Right to constitutional remedies</h2>
<p>Right to constitutional remedies empowers the citizens to move a <a href="court" class="uri" title="wikilink">court</a> of law in case of any denial of the fundamental rights. For instance, in case of imprisonment, the citizen can ask the court to see if it is according to the provisions of the law of the country. If the court finds that it is not, the person will have to be freed. This procedure of asking the courts to preserve or safeguard the citizens' fundamental rights can be done in various ways. The courts can issue various kinds of <em><a href="Writs#Indian_law" title="wikilink">writs</a></em>. These writs are <em><a href="habeas_corpus" title="wikilink">habeas corpus</a></em>, <em><a href="mandamus" class="uri" title="wikilink">mandamus</a></em>, <em><a href="prohibition" class="uri" title="wikilink">prohibition</a></em>, <em><a href="quo_warranto" title="wikilink">quo warranto</a></em> and <em><a href="certiorari" class="uri" title="wikilink">certiorari</a></em>. When a national or state emergency is declared, this right is suspended by the central government.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="right-to-property-a-former-fundamental-right">Right to property — a former fundamental right</h2>
<p>The Constitution originally provided for the <a href="right_to_property" title="wikilink">right to property</a> under Articles 19 and 31. Article 19 guaranteed to all citizens the right to acquire, hold and dispose off property. Article 31 provided that &quot;no person shall be deprived of his property save by authority of law.&quot; It also provided that compensation would be paid to a person whose property has been taken for public purposes.</p>
<p>The provisions relating to the right to property were changed a number of times. The 44th <a href="Constitution_of_India#Amendments" title="wikilink">amendment</a> act of 1978 deleted the right to property from the list of Fundamental Rights.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> A new article, Article 300-A, was added to the constitution which provided that &quot;no person shall be deprived of his property save by authority of law&quot;. Thus if a legislature makes a law depriving a person of his property, there would be no obligation on the part of the State to pay anything as compensation. The aggrieved person shall have no right to move the court under Article 32. Thus, the right to property is no longer a fundamental right, though it is still a constitutional right. If the government appears to have acted unfairly, the action can be challenged in a court of law by citizens.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a></p>

<h2 id="critical-analysis">Critical analysis</h2>
<p>The Fundamental Rights have been criticised for many reasons. Political groups have demanded that the <a href="right_to_work" title="wikilink">right to work</a>, the right to economic assistance in case of <a href="unemployment" class="uri" title="wikilink">unemployment</a>, old age, and similar rights be enshrined as constitutional guarantees to address issues of poverty and economic insecurity,<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> though these provisions have been enshrined in the <a href="Fundamental_Rights,_Directive_Principles_and_Fundamental_Duties_of_India#Directive_Principles_of_State_Policy" title="wikilink">Directive Principles of state policy</a>.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a> The right to freedom and personal liberty has a number of limiting clauses, and thus have been criticized for failing to check the sanctioning of powers often deemed &quot;excessive&quot;.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a> There is also the provision of preventive detention and suspension of Fundamental Rights in times of <a href="State_of_Emergency_in_India" title="wikilink">Emergency</a>. The provisions of acts like the <a href="Maintenance_of_Internal_Security_Act" title="wikilink">Maintenance of Internal Security Act</a> (MISA) and the <a href="National_Security_Act,_1980" title="wikilink">National Security Act</a> (NSA) are a means of countering the fundamental rights, because they sanction excessive powers with the aim of fighting internal and cross-border <a href="terrorism" class="uri" title="wikilink">terrorism</a> and political violence, without safeguards for <a href="civil_rights" title="wikilink">civil rights</a>.<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a> The phrases &quot;security of State&quot;, &quot;public order&quot; and &quot;morality&quot; are of wide implication. People of alternate sexuality is criminalized in India with prison term up to 10 years. The meaning of phrases like &quot;reasonable restrictions&quot; and &quot;the interest of public order&quot; have not been explicitly stated in the <a href="Constitution_of_India" title="wikilink">constitution</a>, and this ambiguity leads to unnecessary litigation.<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a> The freedom to assemble peacably and without arms is exercised, but in some cases, these meetings are broken up by the police through the use of non-fatal methods.<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a><a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a></p>

<h2 id="amendments">Amendments</h2>
<p>Changes in Fundamental Rights require a <a href="Constitution_of_India#Amendments" title="wikilink">Constitutional amendment</a> which has to be passed by a special majority of both houses of the <a href="Parliament_of_India" title="wikilink">Parliament</a>. This means that an amendment requires the approval of two-thirds of the members present and voting.

<li>The <a href="right_to_property" title="wikilink">right to property</a> was originally included as a fundamental right.
