<h2 id="life">Life</h2>
<p>Born in <a href="Triesch" class="uri" title="wikilink">Triesch</a>, <a href="Moravia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Moravia</a> , Schumpeter was a brilliant student praised by his teachers. He began his career studying law at the <a href="University_of_Vienna" title="wikilink">University of Vienna</a> under the <a href="Austrian_School" title="wikilink">Austrian</a> capital theorist <a href="Eugen_von_B&lt;U+00F6&gt;hm-Bawerk" title="wikilink">Eugen von B&lt;U+00F6&gt;hm-Bawerk</a>, taking his <a href="PhD" class="uri" title="wikilink">PhD</a> in 1906. In 1909, after some study trips, he became a professor of economics and government at the <a href="Chernivtsi_University" title="wikilink">University of Czernowitz</a>. In 1911 he joined the <a href="University_of_Graz" title="wikilink">University of Graz</a>, where he remained until <a href="World_War_I" title="wikilink">World War I</a>. In 1919-1920, he served as the Austrian Minister of Finance, with some success, and in 1920-1924, as President of the private Biedermann Bank. That bank, as great part of that regional economy, collapsed in 1924 leaving Schumpeter bankrupt.</p>
<p>From 1925-1932, he held a chair at the <a href="University_of_Bonn" title="wikilink">University of Bonn</a>, <a href="Germany" class="uri" title="wikilink">Germany</a>. With the rise of <a href="Nazism" class="uri" title="wikilink">Nazism</a> in central Europe, he moved to the United States and lectured at <a href="Harvard" class="uri" title="wikilink">Harvard</a> in 1927-1928 and 1930. He would teach there from 1932 until his death in 1950. During his Harvard years he was not generally considered a good classroom teacher, but he acquired a school of loyal followers. His prestige among colleagues was likewise not very high because his views seemed outdated and not in synch with the then-fashionable <a href="Keynesianism" class="uri" title="wikilink">Keynesianism</a>. This period of his life was characterized by hard work but little recognition of his core ideas.</p>
<p>Although Schumpeter encouraged some young <a href="mathematical_economics" title="wikilink">mathematical economists</a> and was even the president of the <a href="Econometric_Society" title="wikilink">Econometric Society</a> (1940-41), Schumpeter was not a mathematician but rather an economist and tried instead to integrate <a href="sociology" title="wikilink">sociological</a> understanding into his economic theories. From current thought it has been argued that Schumpeter's ideas on <a href="business_cycle" title="wikilink">business cycles</a> and <a href="economic_development" title="wikilink">economic development</a> could not be captured in the mathematics of his day - they need the language of non-linear <a href="dynamical_systems" title="wikilink">dynamical systems</a> to be partially formalized.</p>
<h2 id="most-important-work">Most important work</h2>
<h3 id="history-of-economic-analysis">History of economic analysis</h3>
<p>Schumpeter's scholarship is apparent in his posthumous <em>History of Economic Analysis</em>, although some of his judgments seem idiosyncratic and sometimes cavalier. For instance, Schumpeter thought that the greatest 18th century economist was <a href="Anne_Robert_Jacques_Turgot,_Baron_de_Laune" title="wikilink">Turgot</a>, not <a href="Adam_Smith" title="wikilink">Adam Smith</a>, as many consider, and he considered <a href="L&lt;U+00E9&gt;on_Walras" title="wikilink">L&lt;U+00E9&gt;on Walras</a> to be the &quot;greatest of all economists&quot;, beside whom other economists' theories were &quot;like inadequate attempts to catch some particular aspects of Walrasian truth&quot;.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> Schumpeter criticized <a href="John_Maynard_Keynes" title="wikilink">John Maynard Keynes</a> and <a href="David_Ricardo" title="wikilink">David Ricardo</a> for the &quot;Ricardian vice.&quot; According to Schumpeter, Ricardo and Keynes reasoned in terms of abstract models, where they would freeze all but a few variables. Then they could argue that one caused the other in a simple monotonic fashion. This led to the belief that one could easily deduce policy conclusions directly from a highly abstract theoretical model.</p>

<h3 id="business-cycles">Business cycles</h3>
<p>Schumpeter's relationships with the ideas of other economists were quite complex in his most important contributions to economic analysis - the theory of <a href="business_cycles" title="wikilink">business cycles</a> and development. Following neither Walras nor Keynes, Schumpeter starts in <em>The Theory of Economic Development<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></em> with a treatise of <a href="circular_flow" title="wikilink">circular flow</a> which, excluding any innovations and innovative activities, leads to a stationary state. The stationary state is, according to Schumpeter, described by <a href="Walrasian_equilibrium" title="wikilink">Walrasian equilibrium</a>. The hero of his story, though, is, in fine Austrian fashion, the <a href="entrepreneur" class="uri" title="wikilink">entrepreneur</a>.</p>
<p>The entrepreneur disturbs this equilibrium and is the prime cause of economic development, which proceeds in cyclic fashion along several time scales. In fashioning this theory connecting innovations, cycles, and development, Schumpeter kept alive the Russian <a href="Nikolai_Kondratiev" title="wikilink">Nikolai Kondratiev's</a> ideas on 50-year cycles, <a href="Kondratiev_wave" title="wikilink">Kondratiev waves</a>.</p>
<p>Schumpeter suggested a model in which the four main cycles, Kondratiev (54 years), Kuznets (18 years), Juglar (9 years) and Kitchin (about 4 years) can be added together to form a composite waveform. (Actually there was considerable professional rivalry between Schumpeter and Kuznets. The wave form suggested here did not include the Kuznets Cycle simply because Schumpeter did not recognize it as a valid cycle. See &quot;<a href="Business_Cycle" title="wikilink">Business Cycle</a>&quot; for further information.) A Kondratiev wave could consist of three lower degree Kuznets waves. Each Kuznets wave could, itself, be made up of two Juglar waves. Similarly two (or three) Kitchin waves could form a higher degree Juglar wave. If each of these were in phase, more importantly if the downward arc of each was simultaneous so that the nadir of each was coincident it would explain disastrous slumps and consequent depressions. (As far as the segmentation of the Kondratyev Wave, Schumpeter never proposed such a fixed model. He saw these cycles varying in time - although in a tight time frame by coincidence - and for each to serve a specific purpose)</p>
<h3 id="schumpeter-and-keynesianism">Schumpeter and Keynesianism</h3>
<p>Unlike Keynes, in Schumpeter's theory, Walrasian equilibrium is not adequate to capture the key mechanisms of economic development. Schumpeter also thought that the institution enabling the entrepreneur to purchase the resources needed to realize his or her vision was a well-developed <a href="capitalism" title="wikilink">capitalist</a> financial system, including a whole range of institutions for granting <a href="credit_(education)" title="wikilink">credit</a>. One could divide economists among (1) those who emphasized &quot;real&quot; analysis and regarded money as merely a &quot;veil&quot; and (2) those who thought monetary institutions are important and money could be a separate driving force. Both Schumpeter and Keynes were among the latter. Nevertheless, Schumpeter, who was a <a href="classical_liberal" title="wikilink">classical liberal</a>, rejected <a href="Keynesian_economics" title="wikilink">Keynesianism</a>. </p>
<h3 id="schumpeter-and-capitalisms-demise">Schumpeter and capitalism's demise</h3>
<p>Schumpeter's most popular book in English is probably <em><a href="Capitalism,_Socialism_and_Democracy" title="wikilink">Capitalism, Socialism and Democracy</a></em>. This book opens with a treatment of <a href="Karl_Marx" title="wikilink">Karl Marx</a>. While he is sympathetic to Marx's theory that capitalism will collapse and will be replaced by <a href="socialism" class="uri" title="wikilink">socialism</a>, Schumpeter concludes that this will not come about in the way Marx predicted. To describe it he borrowed the phrase &quot;<a href="creative_destruction" title="wikilink">creative destruction</a>,&quot; and made it famous by using it to describe a process in which the old ways of doing things are <a href="Endogeneity_(economics)" title="wikilink">endogenously</a> destroyed and replaced by new ways.</p>
<p>Schumpeter's theory is that the success of capitalism will lead to a form of <a href="corporatism" class="uri" title="wikilink">corporatism</a> and a fostering of values hostile to capitalism, especially among intellectuals. The intellectual and social climate needed to allow <a href="entrepreneurship" class="uri" title="wikilink">entrepreneurship</a> to thrive will not exist in advanced capitalism; it will be replaced by socialism in some form. There will not be a revolution, but merely a trend in <a href="parliament" title="wikilink">parliaments</a> to elect <a href="social_democratic" title="wikilink">social democratic</a> parties of one stripe or another. He argued that capitalism's collapse from within will come about as democratic majorities vote for the creation of a <a href="welfare_state" title="wikilink">welfare state</a> and place restrictions upon entrepreneurship that will burden and destroy the capitalist structure. Schumpeter emphasizes throughout this book that he is analyzing trends, not engaging in political advocacy. In his vision, the intellectual class will play an important role in capitalism's demise. The term &quot;intellectuals&quot; denotes a class of persons in a position to develop critiques of societal matters for which they are not directly responsible and able to stand up for the interests of strata to which they themselves do not belong. One of the great advantages of capitalism, he argues, is that as compared with pre-capitalist periods, when education was a privilege of the few, more and more people acquire (higher) education. The availability of fulfilling work is however limited and this, coupled with the experience of unemployment, produces discontent. The intellectual class is then able to organise protest and develop critical ideas.</p>
<p>In Schumpeter's view, socialism will ensure that the production of goods and services is directed towards meeting the authentic needs of people and will overcome some innate tendencies of capitalism such as conjecture fluctuation, unemployment and waning acceptance of the system.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="schumpeter-and-democratic-theory">Schumpeter and democratic theory</h3>
<p>In the same book, Schumpeter expounded a theory of <a href="democracy" class="uri" title="wikilink">democracy</a> which sought to challenge what he called the 'classical doctrine'. He disputed the idea that democracy was a process by which the electorate identified the common good, and politicians carried this out for them. He argued this was unrealistic, and that people's ignorance and superficiality meant that in fact they were largely manipulated by politicians, who set the agenda. This made a 'rule by the people' concept both unlikely and undesirable. Instead he advocated a minimalist model, much influenced by <a href="Max_Weber" title="wikilink">Max Weber</a>, whereby democracy is the mechanism for competition between leaders, much like a market structure. Although periodical votes from the general public legitimize governments and keep them accountable, the policy program is very much seen as their own and not that of the people, and the participatory role for individuals is usually severely limited.''</p>
<h3 id="schumpeter-and-entrepreneurship">Schumpeter and entrepreneurship</h3>
<p>The research of <a href="entrepreneurship" class="uri" title="wikilink">entrepreneurship</a> owes a lot to his contributions. He was probably the first scholar to develop its theories. He gave two theories, sometimes called Mark I and Mark II. In the first one, the early one, Schumpeter argued that the innovation and technological change of a nation comes from the entrepreneurs, or wild spirits. He coined the word <em>Unternehmergeist</em>, German for <em>entrepreneur-spirit</em>. He believed that these individuals are the ones who make things work in the economy of the country. In Mark II, developed later as professor at <a href="Harvard" class="uri" title="wikilink">Harvard</a>, he asserted that the actors that drive innovation and the economy are big companies which have the resources and capital to invest in research and development. Both arguments might be complementary today.</p>
<p>The English literature uses the term entrepreneurship, from the French &quot;entreprise&quot;. When studying entrepreneurship and Schumpeter, it is helpful to keep in mind he used the German term (Unternehmergeist), acknowledging these &quot;fiery souls&quot; or &quot;spirits&quot;.</p>
<h3 id="schumpeter-and-the-gold-standard">Schumpeter and the Gold Standard</h3>
<p>Joseph Schumpeter recognized the implication of a <a href="gold_standard" title="wikilink">gold monetary standard</a> compared to a <a href="fiat_currency" title="wikilink">fiat monetary standard</a>. In <em>History of Economic Analysis</em> he stated the following:</p>

<h2 id="his-legacy">His legacy</h2>
<p>For some time after his death, Schumpeter's views were most influential among various <a href="heterodox_economics" title="wikilink">heterodox economists</a>, especially European, who were interested in industrial organization, <a href="evolution" title="wikilink">evolutionary theory</a>, and economic development, and who tended to be on the other end of the political spectrum from Schumpeter and were also often influenced by Keynes, Karl Marx, and <a href="Thorstein_Veblen" title="wikilink">Thorstein Veblen</a>. <a href="Robert_Heilbroner" title="wikilink">Robert Heilbroner</a> was one of Schumpeter's most renowned pupils, who wrote extensively about him in <em><a href="The_Worldly_Philosophers" title="wikilink">The Worldly Philosophers</a></em>. Schumpeter &quot;played a formative role in his development as a thinker&quot; of <a href="Paul_Sweezy" title="wikilink">Paul Sweezy</a>, one of the leading <a href="Marxist_economics" title="wikilink">Marxist economists</a> in the United States and a founder of <em><a href="Monthly_Review" title="wikilink">Monthly Review</a></em>; Sweezy was a graduate assistant of Schumpeter's at Harvard.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> Other outstanding students of Schumpeter's include the economist <a href="Nicholas_Georgescu-Roegen" title="wikilink">Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen</a> and former chairman of the Federal Reserve, <a href="Alan_Greenspan" title="wikilink">Alan Greenspan</a><a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a>. <a href="Robert_Solow" title="wikilink">Robert Solow</a>, Nobel Prize in Economics, was his student at Harvard, and he expanded on Schumpeter's theory.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p>Today, Schumpeter has a following outside of standard textbook economics, in areas such as in economic policy, management studies, industrial policy, and the study of <a href="innovation" class="uri" title="wikilink">innovation</a>. Schumpeter was probably the first scholar to develop theories about <a href="entrepreneurship" class="uri" title="wikilink">entrepreneurship</a>. For instance, the <a href="European_Union" title="wikilink">European Union</a>'s innovation program, and its main development plan, the <a href="Lisbon_Strategy" title="wikilink">Lisbon Strategy</a>, are influenced by Schumpeter.</p>
