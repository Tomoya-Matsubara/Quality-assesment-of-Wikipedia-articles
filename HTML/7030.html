<p><strong><em>The Walking Man</em></strong> (<em>L'homme qui marche</em> in French) is a bronze sculpture by the French sculptor <a href="Auguste_Rodin" title="wikilink">Auguste Rodin</a>. It was created by Rodin during 1877 and 1878.</p>
<p>The best example of Rodin&lt;U+2019&gt;s &lt;U+2018&gt;sketchy&lt;U+2019&gt; impressionist sculpture also happens to be his most well-known &lt;U+2018&gt;incomplete&lt;U+2019&gt; figure. This work personifies the latter part of Rodin&lt;U+2019&gt;s career: the dynamic pose of a partial figure. Deriving much from Rodin&lt;U+2019&gt;s earlier work <a href="Saint_John_the_Baptist_(Rodin)" title="wikilink"><em>St. John the Baptist Preaching</em></a>, including the powerful stance, Rodin had stripped all academic associations from his figure, and instead focused on what he considered essential: the dynamic pose.</p>
<p>According to the bibliography supplied by the <a href="National_Gallery_of_Art" title="wikilink">National Gallery of Art</a>, <em>The Walking Man</em> is a version of St. John without head and arms. This sculpture, which used to be considered a preliminary study for the complete Baptist, was based on the movement of that piece. According to Albert Elsen and <a href="Henry_Moore" title="wikilink">Henry Moore</a>'s suggestions, <em>The Walking Man</em> was created for the purpose of a Roman or Greek art without the any live reference.</p>
<p>The art historian <a href="Leo_Steinberg" title="wikilink">Leo Steinberg</a> said of <em>The Walking Man</em>&lt;U+2019&gt;s pose:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The stance is profoundly unclassical, especially in the digging-in conveyed by the pigeon-toed stride and the rotation of the upper torso. Unlike the balanced, self-possessed classical posture with both feet turned out, Rodin uses the kind of step that brings all power to bear on the moment&lt;U+2019&gt;s work</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The statue has served as the inspiration for the works of other artists, such as <a href="Carl_Sandburg" title="wikilink">Carl Sandburg</a>, who described it in his 1916 poem, &quot;The Walking Man of Rodin&quot;:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>THE WALKING MAN OF RODIN<br />
Legs hold a torso away from the earth.<br />
And a regular high poem of legs is here.<br />
Powers of bone and cord raise a belly and lungs<br />
Out of ooze and over the loam where eyes look and ears hear<br />
And arms have a chance to hammer and shoot and run motors.<br />
You make us<br />
Proud of our legs, old man.<br />
<br />
And you left off the head here,<br />
The skull found always crumbling neighbor of the ankles.</p>
