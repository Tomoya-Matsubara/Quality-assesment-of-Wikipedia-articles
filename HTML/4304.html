<p><strong>Franz Kafka</strong> (3 July 1883 &lt;U+2013&gt; 3 June 1924) was an influential <a href="German_language" title="wikilink">German-language</a> writer of novels and short stories, regarded by critics as one of the greatest <a href="20th_century_in_literature" title="wikilink">authors of the 20th century</a>. Kafka was a <a href="Modernist_literature" title="wikilink">Modernist</a> and heavily influenced other genres, including <a href="existentialism" class="uri" title="wikilink">existentialism</a>. His works, such as &quot;&quot; (&quot;The Metamorphosis&quot;), <em></em> (<em>The Trial</em>), and <em></em> (<em>The Castle</em>), are filled with the themes and archetypes of alienation, physical and psychological brutality, parent-child conflict, characters on a terrifying quest, and mystical transformations.</p>
<p>Kafka was born into a middle-class, German-speaking Jewish family in <a href="Prague" class="uri" title="wikilink">Prague</a>, then part of the <a href="Austria-Hungary" title="wikilink">Austro-Hungarian Empire</a>, and trained as a lawyer. After completing his legal education, Kafka obtained employment with an insurance company. He began to write short stories in his spare time, and for the rest of his life complained about the little time he had to devote to what he came to regard as his calling. He also regretted having to devote so much attention to his <em></em> (&quot;day job&quot;, literally &quot;bread job&quot;). Kafka preferred to communicate by letter; he wrote hundreds of letters to family and close female friends, including <a href="Letter_to_His_Father" title="wikilink">his father</a>, his fianc&lt;U+00E9&gt;e <a href="Felice_Bauer" title="wikilink">Felice Bauer</a>, and his youngest sister <a href="Ottla_Kafka" title="wikilink">Ottla</a>. He had a complicated and troubled relationship with his father that had a major impact on his writing, and he was conflicted over his Jewishness and felt it had little to do with him, although it heavily influenced his writing.</p>
<p>Only a few of Kafka's works were published during his lifetime: the story collections <em></em> (<em>Contemplation</em>) and <em></em> (<em>A Country Doctor</em>), and individual stories (such as &quot;&quot;) in literary magazines. He prepared the story collection <em></em> (<em>A Hunger Artist</em>) for print, but it was not published until after his death. Kafka's unfinished works, including his novels <em></em>, <em></em> and <em></em> (also known as <em></em>, <em>The Man Who Disappeared</em>), were published posthumously, mostly by his friend <a href="Max_Brod" title="wikilink">Max Brod</a> who ignored Kafka's wish to have the manuscripts destroyed. <a href="Albert_Camus" title="wikilink">Albert Camus</a> and <a href="Jean-Paul_Sartre" title="wikilink">Jean-Paul Sartre</a> are among the writers influenced by Kafka's work; the term <em>Kafkaesque</em> has entered the English language to describe surreal situations like those in his writing.</p>
<h2 id="life">Life</h2>
<h3 id="family">Family</h3>
<p>Kafka was born in a house on the <a href="Old_Town_Square_(Prague)" title="wikilink">Old Town Square</a> in Prague, then in the Austro-Hungarian Empire. His family were middle-class <a href="Ashkenazi_Jews" title="wikilink">Ashkenazi Jews</a>. Kafka was the eldest of six children. His two brothers, Georg and Heinrich, died in infancy before Franz was seven; his three sisters were Gabriele (&quot;Ellie&quot;) (1889&lt;U+2013&gt;1944), Valerie (&quot;Valli&quot;) (1890&lt;U+2013&gt;1944) and <a href="Ottla_Kafka" title="wikilink">Ottilie</a> (&quot;Ottla&quot;) (1892&lt;U+2013&gt;1943). His father, Hermann Kafka (1852&lt;U+2013&gt;1931), was the fourth child of Jakob Kafka, a <em></em> or <a href="Shechita" title="wikilink">ritual slaughterer</a>, and came to Prague from <a href="Osek_(Strakonice_District)" title="wikilink">Osek</a>, a Czech village with a large Jewish population near <a href="Strakonice" class="uri" title="wikilink">Strakonice</a> in southern Bohemia. After working as a traveling sales representative, he eventually became a fancy goods and clothing retailer who employed up to 15 people and used the image of a <a href="Western_Jackdaw" title="wikilink">jackdaw</a> (<em></em> in Czech) as his business logo. Kafka's mother, Julie (1856&lt;U+2013&gt;1934), was the daughter of Jakob L&lt;U+00F6&gt;wy, a prosperous retail merchant in <a href="Pod&lt;U+011B&gt;brady" class="uri" title="wikilink">Pod&lt;U+011B&gt;brady</a>, and was better educated than her husband. Kafka's parents probably spoke a <a href="Yiddish_language" title="wikilink">Yiddish</a>-influenced variety of German, sometimes pejoratively called <em>.</em> But, because the German language was considered the vehicle of social mobility, they probably encouraged their children to speak <a href="High_German_languages" title="wikilink">High German</a>.</p>
<p>Hermann was described by biographer Stanley Corngold as a &quot;huge, selfish, overbearing businessman&quot; and by Franz Kafka as &quot;a true Kafka in strength, health, appetite, loudness of voice, eloquence, self-satisfaction, worldly dominance, endurance, presence of mind, [and] knowledge of human nature&quot;. On business days, both parents were absent from the home. Franz's mother worked up to 12 hours each day helping to manage her husband's business. Consequently, Kafka's childhood was somewhat lonely, and the children were largely reared by a series of governesses and servants. Kafka's troubled relationship with his father is evident in his <em></em> (<em>Letter to His Father</em>) of more than 100 pages, in which he complains of being profoundly affected by his father's authoritarian and demanding character; his mother, in contrast, was quiet and shy. The dominating figure of Kafka's father had a significant impact on Kafka's writing.</p>
<h3 id="education">Education</h3>
<p>From 1889 to 1893, Kafka attended the <em></em> (German boys' elementary school) at the <em></em> (meat market), now known as Masn&lt;U+00E1&gt; Street. His Jewish education ended with his <a href="Bar_and_Bat_Mitzvah" title="wikilink">Bar Mitzvah</a> celebration at the age of 13. Kafka never enjoyed attending the synagogue and only went with his father on four holidays a year.</p>
<p><img src="Prague_Palace_Kinsky_PC.jpg" title="fig:Kinsky Palace where Kafka attended gymnasium and his father owned a shop|alt=An ornate four-storey palatial building" alt="Kinsky Palace where Kafka attended gymnasium and his father owned a shop|alt=An ornate four-storey palatial building" /> After leaving elementary school in 1893, Kafka was admitted to the rigorous classics-oriented state <a href="Gymnasium_(Germany)" title="wikilink">gymnasium</a>, <em></em>, an academic secondary school at Old Town Square, within the Kinsky Palace. German was the language of instruction, but Kafka also spoke and wrote in Czech; he studied the latter at the gymnasium for eight years, achieving good grades. He received compliments for his Czech, but never considered himself fluent. He completed his <a href="Matura" class="uri" title="wikilink">Matura</a> exams in 1901.</p>
<p>Admitted to the German <a href="Karl-Ferdinands-Universit&lt;U+00E4&gt;t" class="uri" title="wikilink">Karl-Ferdinands-Universit&lt;U+00E4&gt;t</a> of Prague in 1901, Kafka began studying chemistry, but switched to law after two weeks. Although this field did not excite Kafka, it offered a range of career possibilities which pleased his father. In addition, law required a longer course of study, giving Kafka time to take classes in German studies and art history. He also joined a student club, <em></em> (Reading and Lecture Hall of the German students), which organized literary events, readings and other activities. Among Kafka's friends were the journalist <a href="Felix_Weltsch" title="wikilink">Felix Weltsch</a>, who studied philosophy, the actor <a href="Yitzchak_Lowy" title="wikilink">Yitzchak Lowy</a> who came from an orthodox <a href="Hasidic_Judaism" title="wikilink">Hasidic</a> Warsaw family, and the writers <a href="Oskar_Baum" title="wikilink">Oskar Baum</a> and <a href="Franz_Werfel" title="wikilink">Franz Werfel</a>.</p>
<p>At the end of his first year of studies, Kafka met <a href="Max_Brod" title="wikilink">Max Brod</a>, a fellow law student, who became a close friend for life. Brod soon noticed that, although Kafka was shy and seldom spoke, what he said was usually profound. Kafka was an avid reader throughout his life; with Brod, he read Plato's <em><a href="Protagoras_(dialogue)" title="wikilink">Protagoras</a></em> in the original <a href="Ancient_Greek" title="wikilink">Greek</a>, on Brod's initiative, and <a href="Flaubert" class="uri" title="wikilink">Flaubert</a>'s <em></em> (<em>Sentimental Education</em>) and <em></em> (<em>The Temptation of Saint Anthony</em>) in French, at Kafka's suggestion. Kafka considered <a href="Fyodor_Dostoyevsky" title="wikilink">Fyodor Dostoyevsky</a>, Flaubert, <a href="Franz_Grillparzer" title="wikilink">Franz Grillparzer</a>, and <a href="Heinrich_von_Kleist" title="wikilink">Heinrich von Kleist</a> to be his &quot;true <a href="blood_brother" title="wikilink">blood brothers</a>&quot;. Besides these, he took an interest in <a href="Czech_literature" title="wikilink">Czech literature</a> and was also very fond of the works of <a href="Johann_Wolfgang_von_Goethe" title="wikilink">Goethe</a>. Kafka obtained the degree of Doctor of Law on 18 July 1906 and performed an obligatory year of unpaid service as law clerk for the civil and criminal courts.</p>
<h3 id="employment">Employment</h3>
<p>On 1 November 1907, Kafka was hired at the <em></em>, an Italian insurance company, where he worked for nearly a year. His correspondence during that period indicates that he was unhappy with a working time schedule&lt;U+2014&gt;from 08:00 until 18:00&lt;U+2014&gt;which made it extremely difficult to concentrate on writing, which was assuming increasing importance to him. On 15 July 1908, he resigned, and two weeks later found employment more amenable to writing when he joined the <a href="Workers&#39;_compensation" title="wikilink">Worker's Accident Insurance Institute</a> for the <a href="Kingdom_of_Bohemia" title="wikilink">Kingdom of Bohemia</a>. The job involved investigating and assessing compensation for <a href="personal_injury" title="wikilink">personal injury</a> to industrial workers; accidents such as lost fingers or limbs were commonplace at this time. Management professor <a href="Peter_Drucker" title="wikilink">Peter Drucker</a> credits Kafka with developing the first civilian <a href="hard_hat" title="wikilink">hard hat</a> while employed at the Worker's Accident Insurance Institute, but this is not supported by any document from his employer. His father often referred to his son's job as insurance officer as a <em></em>, literally &quot;bread job&quot;, a job done only to pay the bills; Kafka himself often claimed to despise it. Kafka was rapidly promoted and his duties included processing and investigating compensation claims, writing reports, and handling appeals from businessmen who felt their firm had been placed in too high a risk category; which cost them more in insurance premiums. He was also given the task of compiling and composing the <a href="annual_report" title="wikilink">annual report</a> on the insurance institute for the several years he worked there. The reports were received well by his superiors. Kafka usually got off work at 2 p.m., hence, he had time to spend on his literary work, to which he was committed. In his later years his illness often prevented him from working at the insurance bureau and at his writing. Years later, Brod coined the term <em></em> (&quot;The Close Prague Circle&quot;) to describe the group of writers which included himself, Kafka, and Felix Weltsch.</p>
<p>In late 1911, Elli's husband Karl Hermann and Kafka became partners in the first <a href="asbestos" class="uri" title="wikilink">asbestos</a> factory in Prague, known as Prager Asbestwerke Hermann &amp; Co., having used dowry money from Hermann Kafka. Kafka showed a positive attitude at first, dedicating much of his free time to the business, but he later resented how this work encroached on his writing time. During that period, he also found interest and entertainment in the performances of <a href="Yiddish_theatre" title="wikilink">Yiddish theatre</a>, despite the misgivings of close friends such as Brod, who usually supported his interests. After seeing a Yiddish theater troupe perform in October 1911, Kafka spent the next six months immersed in Yiddish language and literature. This interest also served as a starting point for his growing relationship with Judaism. It was at about this time that Kafka became a vegetarian. Around 1915 Kafka received his draft notice for military service in World War I, but his employers at the insurance institute arranged for a deferment because his work was considered essential government service. Later he attempted to join the military but was prevented from doing so by medical problems associated with <a href="tuberculosis" class="uri" title="wikilink">tuberculosis</a>, with which he was diagnosed in 1917.</p>
<h3 id="private-life">Private life</h3>
<p>Kafka, according to Brod, was &quot;tortured&quot; by sexual desire. He visited brothels for most of his adult life and was interested in <a href="pornography" class="uri" title="wikilink">pornography</a>. In addition, he had close relationships with several women during his life. On 13 August 1912, Kafka met <a href="Felice_Bauer" title="wikilink">Felice Bauer</a>, a relative of Brod, who worked in Berlin as a representative of a <a href="dictaphone" class="uri" title="wikilink">dictaphone</a> company. A week after the meeting at Brod's home, Kafka wrote in his diary:</p>

<p>Shortly after this, Kafka wrote the story &quot;&quot; (&quot;The Judgment&quot;) in only one night, and worked in a productive period on <em></em> (<em>The Man Who Disappeared</em>) and &quot;<a href="The_Metamorphosis" title="wikilink">Die Verwandlung</a>&quot; (&quot;The Metamorphosis&quot;). Kafka and Felice Bauer communicated mostly through letters over the next five years, met occasionally, and were engaged twice. Kafka broke the second engagement in 1917 when he began to suffer from tuberculosis. Kafka's extant letters to her were published as <em></em> (<em>Letters to Felice</em>); her letters do not survive. According to biographers <a href="Reiner_Stach" title="wikilink">Reiner Stach</a> and <a href="James_Hawes_(author)" title="wikilink">James Hawes</a>, around 1920 Kafka was engaged a third time, to Julie Wohryzek, a poor and uneducated hotel chambermaid.</p>
<p>Stach and Brod state that during the time that Kafka knew Felice Bauer, he had an affair with a friend of hers, Margarethe &quot;Grete&quot; Bloch, a Jewish woman from Berlin. Brod further claims that Bloch gave birth to Kafka's son, although Kafka never knew about the child. The boy, whose name is not known, was born in 1914 or 1915 and died in Munich in 1921. However, Kafka's biographer Peter-Andr&lt;U+00E9&gt; Alt claims that while Bloch did have a son, Kafka was not the father as the pair were never intimate. Stach claims Kafka had no children.</p>
<p>Kafka was diagnosed with tuberculosis in August 1917 and moved for a few months to the <a href="Bohemia" title="wikilink">Bohemian</a> village of Z&lt;U+00FC&gt;rau, where his sister Ottla worked on the farm of her brother-in-law Hermann. He felt comfortable there and later described this time as perhaps the best in his life, probably because he had no responsibilities. He kept diaries and <em></em> (<a href="octavo" class="uri" title="wikilink">octavo</a>). From the notes in these books Kafka extracted 109 numbered pieces of text on <em>Zettel</em>, single pieces of paper in no given order. They were later published as <em></em> (The Z&lt;U+00FC&gt;rau Aphorisms or Reflections on Sin, Hope, Suffering, and the True Way).</p>
<p>In 1920 Kafka began an intense relationship with Czech journalist and writer <a href="Milena_Jesensk&lt;U+00E1&gt;" title="wikilink">Milena Jesensk&lt;U+00E1&gt;</a>. His letters to her were later published as <em></em>. During a vacation in July 1923 to <a href="Graal-M&lt;U+00FC&gt;ritz" class="uri" title="wikilink">Graal-M&lt;U+00FC&gt;ritz</a> on the <a href="Baltic_Sea" title="wikilink">Baltic Sea</a>, Kafka met <a href="Dora_Diamant" title="wikilink">Dora Diamant</a>, a 25-year-old kindergarten teacher from an orthodox Jewish family. Kafka, hoping to distance himself from the influence of his family to concentrate on his writing, moved briefly to Berlin, where he lived with Diamant. She became his lover and caused him to become interested in the <a href="Talmud" class="uri" title="wikilink">Talmud</a>. He worked on four stories that he prepared to be printed as <em></em> (<em>A Hunger Artist</em>).</p>
<h3 id="personality">Personality</h3>
<p>Kafka feared that people would find him mentally and physically repulsive. However, those who met him perceived him to possess a quiet and cool demeanor, obvious intelligence and a dry sense of humor; they also found him boyishly handsome, although of austere appearance. Brod compared him to Heinrich von Kleist, noting that both writers had the ability to clearly and realistically describe a situation with precise details. Kafka was one of the most entertaining people Brod met; Kafka enjoyed sharing humor with his friends, but also helped them in difficult situations with good advice. According to Brod, he was a passionate reciter, who was able to phrase his speaking as if it were music. Brod felt that two of Kafka's most distinguishing traits were &quot;absolute truthfulness&quot; (<em></em>) and &quot;precise conscientiousness&quot; (<em></em>). He explored the detail, the inconspicuous, profoundly with such love and precision that things surfaced that had been unforeseen, that seemed strange, but were nothing but true (<em></em>).</p>
<p>Although Kafka showed little interest in exercise as a child, he later showed interest in games and physical activity, as a good rider, swimmer, and rower. On weekends he and his friends embarked on long hikes, often planned by Kafka himself. His other interests included <a href="Naturopathy" title="wikilink">alternative medicine</a>, modern education systems such as <a href="Montessori_education" title="wikilink">Montessori</a>, and technical novelties such as airplanes and film. Writing was important to Kafka; he considered it a &quot;form of prayer&quot;. He was very sensitive to noise and preferred quiet when writing.</p>
<p>P&lt;U+00E9&gt;rez-&lt;U+00C1&gt;lvarez has claimed that Kafka may have possessed a <a href="schizoid_personality_disorder" title="wikilink">schizoid personality disorder</a>. His style, they claim, not only in &quot;Die Verwandlung&quot; (&quot;The Metamorphosis&quot;), but in various other writings, appears to show low to medium-level schizoid characteristics, which explain much of his surprising work. His anguish can be seen in this diary entry from 21 June 1913:</p>

<p>and in Z&lt;U+00FC&gt;rau Aphorism number 50:</p>

<p>Though Kafka never married, he held marriage and children in high esteem. He had several girlfriends, but some academics have speculated over his sexuality; others have suggested he may have suffered from an eating disorder. In a 1988 paper Doctor M. M. Fichter of the Psychiatric Clinic, <a href="University_of_Munich" title="wikilink">University of Munich</a> presented &quot;evidence for the hypothesis that the writer Franz Kafka had suffered from an atypical <a href="anorexia_nervosa" title="wikilink">anorexia nervosa</a>&quot;. In his 1995 book <em>Franz Kafka, the Jewish Patient</em>, <a href="Sander_Gilman" title="wikilink">Sander Gilman</a> investigated &quot;why a Jew might have been considered '<a href="hypochondriac" class="uri" title="wikilink">hypochondriac</a>' or '<a href="homosexual" class="uri" title="wikilink">homosexual</a>' and how Kafka incorporates aspects of these ways of understanding the Jewish male into his own self-image and writing&quot;. Kafka considered committing suicide at least once, in late 1912.</p>
<h3 id="political-views">Political views</h3>
<p>Prior to World War I, Kafka attended several meetings of the Klub Mlad&lt;U+00FD&gt;ch, a Czech anarchist, <a href="Antimilitarism" title="wikilink">anti-militarist</a>, and <a href="Anti-clericalism" title="wikilink">anti-clerical</a> organization. Hugo Bergmann, who attended the same elementary and high schools as Kafka, fell out with Kafka during their last academic year (1900&lt;U+2013&gt;1901) because &quot;[Kafka's] socialism and my <a href="Zionism" class="uri" title="wikilink">Zionism</a> were much too strident&quot;. &quot;Franz became a socialist, I became a Zionist in 1898. The synthesis of Zionism and socialism did not yet exist&quot;. Bergmann claims that Kafka wore a red carnation to school to show his support for <a href="socialism" class="uri" title="wikilink">socialism</a>. In one diary entry, Kafka made reference to influential anarchist philosopher <a href="Peter_Kropotkin" title="wikilink">Peter Kropotkin</a>: &quot;Don't forget Kropotkin!&quot; He later stated, regarding the Czech anarchists: &quot;They all sought thanklessly to realize human happiness. I understood them. But ... I was unable to continue marching alongside them for long&quot;.</p>
<p>During the communist era, the legacy of Kafka's work for Eastern bloc socialism was hotly contested. Opinions ranged from the notion that he satirised the bureaucratic bungling of a crumbling <a href="Austria-Hungary" title="wikilink">Austria-Hungarian Empire</a> to suggesting that he embodied the rise of socialism. A further key point was alienation; while the orthodox position was that Kafka's depictions of alienation were no longer relevant for a society that had supposedly eliminated alienation, a 1963 conference held in <a href="Liblice" class="uri" title="wikilink">Liblice</a>, Czechoslovakia in honor of his eightieth birthday reassessed the continued importance of Kafka's portrayal of bureaucratic society. Whether or not Kafka was a political writer is still an issue of debate.</p>
<h3 id="judaism-and-zionism">Judaism and Zionism</h3>
<p>Growing up, Kafka was a German-speaking Jew in Prague, a city dominated by Czech-speaking Gentiles. He was deeply fascinated by the Jews of Eastern Europe, whom he thought possessed an intensity of spiritual life which was absent from Jews in the west. His diary is full of references to Yiddish writers. Yet he was at times alienated from Judaism and Jewish life: &quot;What have I in common with Jews? I have hardly anything in common with myself and should stand very quietly in a corner, content that I can breathe&quot;.</p>
<p>Hawes suggests that Kafka, though very aware of his own <a href="Jewish_peoplehood" title="wikilink">Jewishness</a>, did not incorporate it into his work, which, according to Hawes, lacks Jewish characters, scenes or themes. In the opinion of literary critic <a href="Harold_Bloom" title="wikilink">Harold Bloom</a>, although Kafka was uneasy with his Jewish heritage, he was the quintessential Jewish writer. Lothar Kahn is likewise unequivocal: &quot;The presence of Jewishness in Kafka's <em></em> is no longer subject to doubt&quot;. <a href="Pavel_Eisner" title="wikilink">Pavel Eisner</a>, one of Kafka's first translators, interprets the classic, <em></em> (<em>The Trial</em>) as the embodiment of the &quot;triple dimension of Jewish existence in Prague ... his protagonist Josef K. is (symbolically) arrested by a German (Rabensteiner), a Czech (Kullich) and a Jew (Kaminer). He stands for the 'guiltless guilt' that imbues the Jew in the modern world, although there is no evidence that he himself is a Jew&quot;.</p>
<p>In his essay <em>Sadness in Palestine?!</em>, <a href="Dan_Miron" title="wikilink">Dan Miron</a> explores Kafka's connection to Zionism: &quot;It seems that those who claim that there was such a connection and that Zionism played a central role in his life and literary work, and those who deny the connection altogether or dismiss its importance, are both wrong. The truth lies in some very elusive place between these two simplistic poles&quot;. Kafka considered moving to <a href="British_Mandate_of_Palestine" title="wikilink">Palestine</a> with Felice Bauer, and later with Dora Diamant. He studied <a href="Hebrew" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hebrew</a> while living in Berlin, hiring a friend of Brod's from Palestine, Pua Bat-Tovim, to tutor him and attending Rabbi <a href="Julius_Guttmann" title="wikilink">Julius Guttmann</a>'s class in the <em></em> (Berlin College for Judaic Science).</p>
<p>Livia Rothkirchen calls Kafka the &quot;symbolic figure of his era&quot;. His contemporaries included numerous Jewish writers (Czech, German and national Jews) who were sensitive to German, Czech, Austrian and Jewish culture. According to Rothkirchen, &quot;This situation lent their writings a broad cosmopolitan outlook and a quality of exaltation bordering on transcendental metaphysical contemplation. An illustrious example is Franz Kafka&quot;.</p>
<h3 id="death">Death</h3>
<p>Kafka's <a href="Larynx" title="wikilink">laryngeal</a> tuberculosis worsened and in March 1924 he returned from Berlin to Prague, where members of his family, principally his sister Ottla, took care of him. He went to Dr. Hoffmann's <a href="sanatorium" class="uri" title="wikilink">sanatorium</a> in <a href="Klosterneuburg" title="wikilink">Kierling</a> near <a href="Vienna" class="uri" title="wikilink">Vienna</a> for treatment on 10 April, and died there on 3 June 1924. His cause of death seemed to be starvation: the condition of Kafka's throat made eating too painful for him, and since <a href="parenteral_nutrition" title="wikilink">parenteral nutrition</a> had not yet been developed, there was no way to feed him. His body was brought back to Prague where he was buried on 11 June 1924, in the New Jewish Cemetery in . Kafka was unknown during his own lifetime, but he did not consider fame important. However, he became famous soon after his death.</p>

<p>All of Kafka's published works, except some letters he wrote in Czech to Milena Jesensk&lt;U+00E1&gt;, were written in German. What little was published during his lifetime attracted scant public attention.</p>
<h3 id="stories">Stories</h3>
<p>Kafka was a prolific writer of the <em></em> genre (literally: <a href="narrative" class="uri" title="wikilink">narrative</a>, mostly called &quot;short story&quot;). Some stories are relatively long; others are a single paragraph. His oldest surviving story is &quot;Der Unredliche in seinem Herzen&quot; (&quot;The Impure in His Heart&quot;), translated as &quot;<a href="Shamefaced_Lanky_and_Impure_in_Heart" title="wikilink">Shamefaced Lanky and Impure in Heart</a>&quot;. It was not published but was part of a <a href="Letters_to_Family,_Friends,_and_Editors_(Franz_Kafka)" title="wikilink">letter to his friend</a> <a href="Oskar_Pollak" title="wikilink">Oskar Pollak</a> in 1902. Kafka's earliest published works were eight stories which appeared in 1908 in the first issue of the literary journal <em><a href="Hyperion_(journal)" title="wikilink">Hyperion</a></em> under the title <em></em> (<em>Contemplation</em>). He worked on the story &quot;&quot; (&quot;Description of a Struggle&quot;) from 1904 to 1909; he showed it to Brod, who advised him to continue writing and convinced him to submit it to <em>Hyperion</em>. Kafka published a fragment in 1908 and two sections in the spring of 1909, all in Munich.</p>
<p>In a creative outburst on the night of 22 September 1912, Kafka wrote the story &quot;Das Urteil&quot; (&quot;The Judgment&quot;, literally: &quot;The Verdict&quot;) and dedicated it to Felice Bauer. Brod noted the similarity in names of the main character and his fictional fianc&lt;U+00E9&gt;e, Georg Bendemann and Frieda Brandenfeld, to the real people, Franz Kafka and Felice Bauer. The story is often considered as Kafka's breakthrough work. It deals with the troubled relationship of a son and his dominant father, facing a new situation after the son was engaged. Kafka later described writing in &quot;a complete opening of body and soul&quot; a story that &quot;evolved as a true birth, covered with filth and slime&quot;. The story was first published in Leipzig in 1912 and dedicated &quot;to Miss Felice Bauer&quot;, and in subsequent editions simply &quot;for F.&quot;</p>
<p>In 1912, Kafka wrote the story &quot;Die Verwandlung&quot; (&quot;The Metamorphosis&quot;, or &quot;The Transformation&quot;), published in 1915 in Leipzig. The story begins with a traveling salesman waking to find himself transformed into a <em></em>, a monstrous <a href="vermin" class="uri" title="wikilink">vermin</a>, <em></em> being a general term for unwanted and unclean animals. Critics regard the work as one of the seminal works of fiction of the 20th century. The story &quot;<a href="In_the_Penal_Colony" title="wikilink">In der Strafkolonie</a>&quot; (&quot;In the Penal Colony&quot;), dealing with an elaborate <a href="torture" class="uri" title="wikilink">torture</a> and execution device, was written in October 1914, revised in 1918, and published in Leipzig during October 1919. The story &quot;<a href="A_Hunger_Artist" title="wikilink">Ein Hungerk&lt;U+00FC&gt;nstler</a>&quot; (&quot;A Hunger Artist&quot;), published in the periodical <em></em> in 1924, describes a victimized protagonist who experiences a decline in the appreciation of his strange craft of <a href="hunger_artist" title="wikilink">starving himself for extended periods</a>. His last story, &quot;<a href="Josephine_the_Singer,_or_the_Mouse_Folk" title="wikilink">Josefine, die S&lt;U+00E4&gt;ngerin oder Das Volk der M&lt;U+00E4&gt;use</a>&quot; (&quot;Josephine the Singer, or the Mouse Folk&quot;), also deals with the relationship between an artist and his audience.</p>
<h3 id="novels">Novels</h3>
<p>Kafka finished none of his full length novels and burned around 90 per cent of his own work. He began his first novel project in 1912; its first chapter is the story &quot;<a href="The_Stoker" title="wikilink">Der Heizer</a>&quot; (&quot;The Stoker&quot;). Kafka called the work, which remained unfinished, <em></em> (<em>The Man Who Disappeared</em> or <em>The Missing Man</em>), but when Brod published it after Kafka's death, he named it <em>Amerika</em>. More explicitly humorous and slightly more realistic than most of Kafka's works, the novel nevertheless shares the same <a href="Motif_(narrative)" title="wikilink">motif</a> of an oppressive and intangible system putting the protagonist repeatedly in bizarre situations. It is the only work for which Kafka ever considered an optimistic ending.</p>
<p>During 1914, Kafka began the novel <em></em> (<em>The Trial</em>), the story of a man arrested and prosecuted by a remote, inaccessible authority, with the nature of his crime revealed to neither him nor the reader. Kafka did not complete the novel, although he finished the final chapter. According to <a href="List_of_Nobel_laureates_in_Literature" title="wikilink">Nobel Prize winner</a> and Kafka scholar <a href="Elias_Canetti" title="wikilink">Elias Canetti</a>, Felice is central to the plot of <em>Der Process</em> and Kafka said it was &quot;her story&quot;. Canetti titled his book on Kafka's letters to Felice <em>Kafka's Other Trial</em>, in recognition of the relationship between the letters and the novel. Michiko Kakutani notes in a review for <em><a href="The_New_York_Times" title="wikilink">The New York Times</a></em> that Kafka's letters have the &quot;earmarks of his fiction: the same nervous attention to minute particulars; the same paranoid awareness of shifting balances of power; the same atmosphere of emotional suffocation &lt;U+2013&gt; combined, surprisingly enough, with moments of boyish ardor and delight.&quot;</p>
<p>According to his diary, Kafka was already planning his novel <em></em> (The Castle), by 11 June 1914; however, he did not begin writing it until 27 January 1922. The protagonist is the <em></em> (land surveyor) named K., who struggles for unknown reasons to gain access to the mysterious authorities of a castle who govern the village. Kafka's intent was that the castle's authorities notify K. on his deathbed that his &quot;legal claim to live in the village was not valid, yet, taking certain auxiliary circumstances into account, he was to be permitted to live and work there&quot;. Dark and at times <a href="Surrealism" title="wikilink">surreal</a>, the novel is focused on <a href="Social_alienation" title="wikilink">alienation</a>, <a href="bureaucracy" class="uri" title="wikilink">bureaucracy</a>, the seemingly endless frustrations of man's attempts to stand against the system, and the futile and hopeless pursuit of an unobtainable goal. Hartmut M. Rastalsky noted in his thesis: &quot;Like dreams, his texts combine precise &quot;realistic&quot; detail with absurdity, careful observation and reasoning on the part of the protagonists with inexplicable obliviousness and carelessness.&quot;</p>

<p>Kafka's stories were initially published in literary periodicals. His first eight were printed in 1908 in the first issue of the bi-monthly <em>Hyperion</em>. <a href="Franz_Blei" title="wikilink">Franz Blei</a> published two dialogues in 1909 which became part of &quot;Beschreibung eines Kampfes&quot; (&quot;Description of a Struggle&quot;). A fragment of the story &quot;<a href="The_Aeroplanes_At_Brescia" title="wikilink">Die Aeroplane in Brescia</a>&quot; (&quot;The Aeroplanes At Brescia&quot;), written on a trip to Italy with Brod, appeared in the daily <em><a href="Bohemia_(newspaper)" title="wikilink">Bohemia</a></em> on 28 September 1909. On 27 March 1910, several stories that later became part of the book <em></em> were published in the Easter edition of <em>Bohemia</em>. In Leipzig during 1913, Brod and publisher <a href="Kurt_Wolff_(publisher)" title="wikilink">Kurt Wolff</a> included &quot;&quot; (&quot;The Verdict. A Story by Franz Kafka.&quot;) in their literary yearbook for the art poetry <em>Arkadia</em>. The story &quot;&quot; (&quot;Before the Law&quot;) was published in the 1915 New Year's edition of the independent Jewish weekly <em></em>; it was reprinted in 1919 as part of the story collection <em></em> (<em>A Country Doctor</em>) and became part of the novel <em></em>. Other stories were published in various publications, including Brod's <em><a href="Der_Jude_(magazine)" title="wikilink">Der Jude</a></em>, the paper <em></em>, and the periodicals <em></em>, <em><a href="Genius_(magazine)" title="wikilink">Genius</a></em>, and <em><a href="Prager_Presse" title="wikilink">Prager Presse</a></em>.</p>
<p>Kafka's first published book, <em></em> (<em>Contemplation</em>, or <em>Meditation</em>), was a collection of 18 stories written between 1904 and 1912. On a summer trip to <a href="Weimar" class="uri" title="wikilink">Weimar</a>, Brod initiated a meeting between Kafka and Kurt Wolff; Wolff published <em></em> in the  at the end of 1912 (with the year given as 1913). Kafka dedicated it to Brod, &quot;&quot;, and added in the personal copy given to his friend &quot;&quot; (&quot;As it is already printed here, for my dearest Max&quot;).</p>
<p>Kafka's story &quot;Die Verwandlung&quot; (&quot;The Metamorphosis&quot;) was first printed in the October 1915 issue of <em></em>, a monthly edition of <a href="expressionism" title="wikilink">expressionist</a> literature, edited by <a href="Ren&lt;U+00E9&gt;_Schickele" title="wikilink">Ren&lt;U+00E9&gt; Schickele</a>. Another story collection, <em></em> (<em>A Country Doctor</em>), was published by Kurt Wolff in 1919., dedicated to Kafka's father. Kafka prepared a final collection of four stories for print, <em></em> <em>(A Hunger Artist)</em>, which appeared in 1924 after his death, in <em></em>. On 20 April 1924, the <em></em> published Kafka's essay on <a href="Adalbert_Stifter" title="wikilink">Adalbert Stifter</a>.</p>
<h4 id="max-brod">Max Brod</h4>
<p>Kafka left his work, both published and unpublished, to his friend and <a href="literary_executor" title="wikilink">literary executor</a> Max Brod with explicit instructions that it should be destroyed on Kafka's death; Kafka wrote: &quot;Dearest Max, my last request: Everything I leave behind me ... in the way of diaries, manuscripts, letters (my own and others'), sketches, and so on, [is] to be burned unread&quot;. Brod decided to ignore this request and published the novels and collected works between 1925 and 1935. He took many papers, which remain unpublished, with him in suitcases to Palestine when he fled there in 1939. Kafka's last lover, Dora Diamant (later, Dymant-Lask), also ignored his wishes, secretly keeping 20 notebooks and 35 letters. These were confiscated by the <a href="Gestapo" class="uri" title="wikilink">Gestapo</a> in 1933, but scholars continue to search for them.</p>
<p>As Brod published the bulk of the writing in his possession, Kafka's work began to attract wider attention and critical acclaim. Brod found it difficult to compile Kafka's notebooks into chronological order. One problem was that Kafka often began writing in different parts of the book; sometimes in the middle, sometimes working backwards from the end. Brod finished many of Kafka's incomplete works to allow their publication. For example, Kafka left <em></em> with unnumbered and incomplete chapters and <em></em> with incomplete sentences and ambiguous content; Brod rearranged chapters, copyedited the text, and changed the punctuation. <em></em> appeared in 1925 in <em></em>. Kurt Wolff published two other novels, <em></em> in 1926 and <em>Amerika</em> in 1927. In 1931, Brod edited a collection of prose and unpublished stories as <em></em> <em>(The Great Wall of China)</em>, including the <a href="The_Great_Wall_of_China_(Kafka)" title="wikilink">story of the same name</a>. The book appeared in the <em></em>. Brod's sets are usually called the Definitive Editions.</p>
<h4 id="modern-editions">Modern editions</h4>
<p>In 1961, <a href="Malcolm_Pasley" title="wikilink">Malcolm Pasley</a> acquired most of Kafka's original handwritten work for the <a href="University_of_Oxford" title="wikilink">Oxford</a> <a href="Bodleian_Library" title="wikilink">Bodleian Library</a>. The text for <em></em> was later purchased through auction and is stored at the German Literary Archives in <a href="Marbach_am_Neckar" title="wikilink">Marbach am Neckar</a>, Germany. Subsequently, Pasley headed a team (including <a href="Gerhard_Neumann" title="wikilink">Gerhard Neumann</a>, Jost Schillemeit and J&lt;U+00FC&gt;rgen Born) which reconstructed the German novels;  republished them. Pasley was the editor for <em></em>, published in 1982, and <em></em>, published in 1990. Jost Schillemeit was the editor of '' published in 1983. These are called the &quot;Critical Editions&quot; or the &quot;Fischer Editions&quot;.</p>
<h4 id="unpublished-papers">Unpublished papers</h4>
<p>When Brod died in 1968, he left Kafka's unpublished papers, which are believed to number in the thousands, to his secretary <a href="Esther_Hoffe" title="wikilink">Esther Hoffe</a>. She released or sold some, but left most to her daughters, Eva and Ruth, who also refused to release the papers. A court battle began in 2008 between the sisters and the <a href="National_Library_of_Israel" title="wikilink">National Library of Israel</a>, which claimed these works became the property of the nation of Israel when Brod emigrated to <a href="Mandatory_Palestine" title="wikilink">British Palestine</a> in 1939. Only Eva is still alive as of 2012. A ruling by a Tel Aviv family court in 2010 held that the papers must be released and a few were, including a previously unknown story, but the legal battle continued. The Hoffes claim the papers are their personal property, while the National Library argues they are &quot;cultural assets belonging to the Jewish people&quot;. The National Library also suggests that Brod bequeathed the papers to them in his will. The Tel Aviv Family court ruled in October 2012 that the papers were the property of the National Library. Esther Hoffe sold the original manuscript of <em></em> for US$2 million in 1988 to the German Literary Archive <a href="Museum_of_Modern_Literature" title="wikilink">Museum of Modern Literature</a> in Marbach am Neckar.</p>

Each name has a passage in Hebrew below it." /> Many critics have praised Kafka's writing. The poet <a href="W._H._Auden" title="wikilink">W. H. Auden</a> called Kafka &quot;the <a href="Dante" class="uri" title="wikilink">Dante</a> of the twentieth century&quot;; the novelist <a href="Vladimir_Nabokov" title="wikilink">Vladimir Nabokov</a> placed him among the greatest writers of the 20th century. <a href="Gabriel_Garc&lt;U+00ED&gt;a_M&lt;U+00E1&gt;rquez" title="wikilink">Gabriel Garc&lt;U+00ED&gt;a M&lt;U+00E1&gt;rquez</a> noted it was the reading of Kafka's &quot;The Metamorphosis&quot; that showed him &quot;that it was possible to write in a different way&quot;. The core theme of Kafka's work, first established in the short story &quot;Das Urteil&quot;, is father-son conflict: the guilt induced in the son is resolved through suffering and atonement. Other prominent themes and archetypes include alienation, physical and psychological brutality, characters on a terrifying quest, and mystical transformation.</p>
<p>The nature of Kafka's prose allows for varied interpretations and critics have placed his writing into a variety of literary schools. <a href="Marxism" title="wikilink">Marxists</a>, for example, have sharply disagreed over how to interpret Kafka's works. Some accused him of distorting reality whereas others claimed he was critiquing capitalism. The hopelessness and absurdity common to his works are seen as emblematic of <a href="existentialism" class="uri" title="wikilink">existentialism</a>. Some of Kafka's books are influenced by the expressionist movement, though the majority of his literary output was associated with the experimental <a href="modernism" title="wikilink">modernist</a> genre. Kafka also touches on the theme of human conflict with bureaucracy. William Burrows claims that such work is centered on the concepts of struggle, pain, solitude, and the need for relationships. Others, such as <a href="Thomas_Mann" title="wikilink">Thomas Mann</a>, see Kafka's work as allegorical: a quest, metaphysical in nature, for God.</p>
<p>According to <a href="Gilles_Deleuze" title="wikilink">Gilles Deleuze</a> and <a href="F&lt;U+00E9&gt;lix_Guattari" title="wikilink">F&lt;U+00E9&gt;lix Guattari</a>, the themes of alienation and persecution, although present in Kafka's work, have been over-emphasised by critics. They argue Kafka's work is more deliberate and subversive&lt;U+2014&gt;and more joyful&lt;U+2014&gt;than may first appear. They point out that reading his work while focusing on the futility of his characters' struggles reveals Kafka's play at humor; he is not necessarily commenting on his own problems, but rather pointing out how people tend to invent problems. In his work, Kafka often created malevolent, absurd worlds. Kafka read drafts of his works to his friends, typically concentrating on his humorous prose. Writer <a href="Milan_Kundera" title="wikilink">Milan Kundera</a> suggests that Kafka's <a href="surreal_humour" title="wikilink">surrealist humor</a> may have been an inversion of Dostoyevsky who presented characters who were punished for a crime. In Kafka's work a character will be punished although a crime has not been committed. Kundera believes that Kafka's inspirations for his characteristic situations came both from growing up in a patriarchal family and living in a totalitarian state.</p>
<p>Attempts have been made to identify the influence of Kafka's legal background and the role of law in his fiction. Most interpretations identify aspects of law and legality as important in his work, in which the legal system is often oppressive. The law in Kafka's works, rather than being representative of any particular legal or political entity, is usually interpreted to represent a collection of anonymous, incomprehensible forces. These are hidden from the individual but control the lives of the people, who are innocent victims of systems beyond their control. Critics who support this <a href="absurdism" title="wikilink">absurdist</a> interpretation cite instances where Kafka describes himself in conflict with an absurd universe, such as the following entry from his diary:</p>

<p>However, James Hawes argues many of Kafka's descriptions of the legal proceedings in <em></em>&lt;U+2014&gt;metaphysical, absurd, bewildering and nightmarish as they might appear&lt;U+2014&gt;are based on accurate and informed descriptions of German and Austrian criminal proceedings of the time, which were <a href="Inquisitorial_system" title="wikilink">inquisitorial</a> rather than <a href="Adversarial_system" title="wikilink">adversarial</a>. Although he worked in insurance, as a trained lawyer Kafka was &quot;keenly aware of the legal debates of his day&quot;. In a early 21st century which used Kafka's office writings as its point of departure, Pothik Ghosh states that with Kafka, law &quot;has no meaning outside its fact of being a pure force of domination and determination&quot;.</p>
<h3 id="translations">Translations</h3>
<p>The earliest English translations of Kafka's works were by <a href="Edwin_Muir" title="wikilink">Edwin and Willa Muir</a>, who in 1930 translated the first German edition of <em></em>. This was published as <em>The Castle</em> by <a href="Secker_&amp;_Warburg" title="wikilink">Secker &amp; Warburg</a> in England and <a href="Alfred_A._Knopf" title="wikilink">Alfred A. Knopf</a> in the United States. A 1941 edition, including a homage by Thomas Mann, spurred a surge in Kafka's popularity in the United States the late 1940s. The Muirs translated all shorter works that Kafka had seen fit to print; they were published by <a href="Schocken_Books" title="wikilink">Schocken Books</a> in 1948 as <em><a href="The_Penal_Colony:_Stories_and_Short_Pieces" title="wikilink">The Penal Colony: Stories and Short Pieces</a></em>, including additionally <em><a href="The_First_Long_Train_Journey" title="wikilink">The First Long Train Journey</a></em>, written by Kafka and Brod, Kafka's &quot;A Novel about Youth&quot;, a review of Felix Sternheim's <em>Die Geschichte des jungen Oswald</em>, his essay on Kleist's &quot;Anecdotes&quot;, his review of the literary magazine <em><a href="Hyperion_(magazine)" title="wikilink">Hyperion</a></em>, and an epilogue by Brod.</p>
<p>Later editions, notably those of 1954 (<em><a href="Dearest_Father._Stories_and_Other_Writings" title="wikilink">Dearest Father. Stories and Other Writings</a></em>), included text, translated by Eithne Wilkins and <a href="Ernst_Kaiser_(author)" title="wikilink">Ernst Kaiser</a>, which had been deleted by earlier publishers. Known as &quot;Definitive Editions&quot;, they include translations of <em>The Trial, Definitive</em>, <em><a href="The_Castle,_Definitive_Edition,_Muir_Translation" title="wikilink">The Castle, Definitive</a></em>, and other writings. These translations are generally accepted to have a number of biases and are considered to be dated in interpretation. Published in 1961 by Schocken Books, <em><a href="Parables_and_Paradoxes" title="wikilink">Parables and Paradoxes</a></em> presented in a bilingual edition by <a href="Nahum_N._Glatzer" title="wikilink">Nahum N. Glatzer</a> selected writings, drawn from notebooks, diaries, letters, short fictional works and the novel <em>Der Process</em>.</p>
<p>New translations were completed and published based on the recompiled German text of Pasley and Schillemeit &lt;U+2013&gt; <em><a href="The_Castle,_Critical_Edition,_Harman_Translation" title="wikilink">The Castle, Critical</a></em> by <a href="Mark_Harman_(translator)" title="wikilink">Mark Harman</a> (<a href="Schocken_Books" title="wikilink">Schocken Books</a>, 1998), <em>The Trial, Critical</em> by <a href="Breon_Mitchell" title="wikilink">Breon Mitchell</a> (Schocken Books, 1998), and <em>Amerika: The Man Who Disappeared</em> by <a href="Michael_Hofmann" title="wikilink">Michael Hofmann</a> (<a href="New_Directions_Publishing" title="wikilink">New Directions Publishing</a>, 2004).</p>
<h3 id="translation-problems-to-english">Translation problems to English</h3>
<p>Kafka often made extensive use of a characteristic particular to the German language allowing for long sentences that sometimes can span an entire page. Kafka's sentences then deliver an unexpected impact just before the full stop&lt;U+2014&gt;that being the finalizing meaning and focus. This is due to the construction of certain sentences in German which require that the verb be positioned at the end of the sentence. Such constructions are difficult to duplicate in English, so it is up to the translator to provide the reader with the same (or at least equivalent) effect found in the original text. German's more flexible word order and syntactical differences provide for multiple ways the same German writing can be translated into English. Kafka did not write in standard High German, but rather in a Praguean German heavily influenced by the Yiddish and Czech languages, making it even more difficult to translate his works. An example is the first sentence of Kafka's &quot;The Metamorphosis&quot;, which is crucial to the setting and understanding of the entire story:</p>
<dl>

<dd><em></em>. (Original)
</dd>
<dd>As Gregor Samsa one morning from restless dreams awoke, found he himself in his bed into an enormous vermin transformed. (literal word for word translation)
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Another virtually insurmountable problem facing translators is how to deal with the author's intentional use of ambiguous terms and words that have several meanings. One such instance is found in the first sentence of <a href="The_Metamorphosis#Lost_in_translation" title="wikilink">&quot;The Metamorphosis&quot;</a>. English translators often render the word <em></em> as &quot;insect&quot;; in Middle German, however, <em></em> literally means &quot;unclean animal not suitable for sacrifice&quot;; in today's German it means vermin. It is sometimes used colloquially to mean &quot;bug&quot; &lt;U+2013&gt; a very general term, unlike the scientific &quot;insect&quot;. Kafka had no intention of labeling Gregor, the protagonist of the story, as any specific thing, but instead wanted to convey Gregor's disgust at his transformation. Another example is Kafka's use of the German noun <em></em> in the final sentence of &quot;Das Urteil&quot;. Literally, <em></em> means intercourse and, as in English, can have either a sexual or non-sexual meaning; in addition, it is used to mean transport or traffic. The sentence can be translated as: &quot;At that moment an unending stream of traffic crossed over the bridge&quot;. The double meaning of <em>Verkehr</em> is given added weight by Kafka's confession to Brod that when he wrote that final line, he was thinking of &quot;a violent ejaculation&quot;.</p>

<p><img src="Kafka_statue_Prague.jpg" title="fig:Jaroslav R&lt;U+00F3&gt;na&#39;s bronze statue of Franz Kafka in Prague|alt=The statue is a man with no head or arms, with another man sitting on his shoulders." alt="Jaroslav R&lt;U+00F3&gt;na&#39;s bronze statue of Franz Kafka in Prague|alt=The statue is a man with no head or arms, with another man sitting on his shoulders." /> Kafka's writing has inspired the term &quot;Kafkaesque&quot;, used to describe concepts and situations reminiscent of his work, particularly <em></em> and &quot;Die Verwandlung&quot;. Examples include instances in which people are overpowered by bureaucracies, often in a surreal, nightmarish milieu which evokes feelings of senselessness, disorientation, and helplessness. Characters in a Kafkaesque setting often lack a clear course of action to escape the situation. Kafkaesque elements often appear in existential works, but the term has transcended the literary realm to apply to real-life occurrences and situations that are incomprehensibly complex, bizarre, or illogical.</p>
<h3 id="commemoration">Commemoration</h3>
<p>The Franz Kafka Museum in Prague is dedicated to Kafka and his work. A major component of the museum is an exhibit <em>The City of K. Franz Kafka and Prague</em>, which was first shown in Barcelona in 1999, moved to the <a href="Jewish_Museum_(New_York)" title="wikilink">Jewish Museum</a> in New York City, and was finally established in 2005 in Prague in <a href="Mal&lt;U+00E1&gt;_Strana" title="wikilink">Mal&lt;U+00E1&gt; Strana</a> (Lesser Town), along the <a href="Vltava" title="wikilink">Moldau</a>. The museum calls its display of original photos and documents <em>M&lt;U+011B&gt;sto K. Franz Kafka a Praha</em> (City K. Kafka and Prague) and aims to immerse the visitor into the world in which Kafka lived and about which he wrote.</p>
<p>The <a href="Franz_Kafka_Prize" title="wikilink">Franz Kafka Prize</a> is an annual literary award of the Franz Kafka Society and the City of Prague established in 2001. It recognizes the merits of literature as &quot;humanistic character and contribution to cultural, national, language and religious tolerance, its existential, timeless character, its generally human validity, and its ability to hand over a testimony about our times&quot;. The selection committee and recipients come from all over the world, but are limited to living authors who have had at least one work published in the Czech language. The recipient receives $10,000, a diploma, and a bronze statuette at a presentation in <a href="Old_Town_(Prague)" title="wikilink">Prague's Old Town Hall</a> on the Czech State Holiday in late October.</p>
<p><a href="San_Diego_State_University" title="wikilink">San Diego State University</a> (SDSU) operates a <em>Kafka Project</em> which began in 1998 as the official international search for Kafka's last writings. The project's four-month search of government archives in Berlin in 1998 uncovered the Gestapo confiscation order from 1933 and other significant documents. In 2003 the project discovered three original Kafka letters, written in 1923. Building on the search conducted by Brod and Klaus Wagenbach in the mid-1950s, the project at SDSU has an advisory committee of international scholars and researchers.</p>
<h3 id="literary-and-cultural-influence">Literary and cultural influence</h3>
<p>Unlike many famous writers, Kafka is rarely quoted by others. Instead, he is noted more for his visions and perspective. Professor and writer Shimon Sandbank identifies Kafka as having influenced <a href="Jorge_Luis_Borges" title="wikilink">Jorge Luis Borges</a>, <a href="Albert_Camus" title="wikilink">Albert Camus</a>, <a href="Eug&lt;U+00E8&gt;ne_Ionesco" title="wikilink">Eug&lt;U+00E8&gt;ne Ionesco</a>, and <a href="Jean-Paul_Sartre" title="wikilink">Jean-Paul Sartre</a>. A <em>Financial Times</em> literary critic credits Kafka with influencing <a href="Jos&lt;U+00E9&gt;_Saramago" title="wikilink">Jos&lt;U+00E9&gt; Saramago</a>, and editor Al Silverman states that <a href="J.D._Salinger" title="wikilink">J.D. Salinger</a> loved to read Kafka's works. In 1999 a committee of 99 authors, scholars, and literary critics ranked the <em></em> and <em></em>, the second and ninth <a href="Best_German_Novels_of_the_Twentieth_Century" title="wikilink">most significant German-language novels of the 20th century</a>. Literary critic Shimon Sandbank argues that despite Kafka's pervasiveness, his enigmatic style has yet to be emulated. Neil Pages, a professor who specializes in Kafka's works, says Kafka's influence transcends literature and literary scholarship; it impacts visual arts, music, and popular culture.</p>
<p>Michel-Andr&lt;U+00E9&gt; Bossy writes that Kafka created a rigidly inflexible and sterile bureaucratic universe. Kafka wrote in an aloof manner full of legal and scientific terms. Yet his serious universe also had insightful humor, all highlighting the &quot;irrationality at the roots of a supposedly rational world&quot;. His characters are trapped, confused, full of guilt, frustrated, and lacking understanding of their surreal world. Much of the post-Kafka fiction, especially science fiction, follow the themes and precepts of Kafka's universe. This can be seen in the works of authors such as <a href="George_Orwell" title="wikilink">George Orwell</a> and <a href="Ray_Bradbury" title="wikilink">Ray Bradbury</a>.</p>
