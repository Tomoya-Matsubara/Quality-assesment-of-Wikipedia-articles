<p><strong>Fanno Creek</strong> is a  tributary of the <a href="Tualatin_River" title="wikilink">Tualatin River</a> in the U.S. state of <a href="Oregon" class="uri" title="wikilink">Oregon</a>.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> Part of the drainage basin of the <a href="Columbia_River" title="wikilink">Columbia River</a>, its watershed covers  in <a href="Multnomah_County,_Oregon" title="wikilink">Multnomah</a>, <a href="Washington_County,_Oregon" title="wikilink">Washington</a>, and <a href="Clackamas_County,_Oregon" title="wikilink">Clackamas</a> counties, including  within the <a href="Portland,_Oregon" title="wikilink">Portland</a> city limits.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>From its headwaters in the <a href="Tualatin_Mountains" title="wikilink">Tualatin Mountains</a> (West Hills) in southwest Portland, the creek flows generally west and south through the cities of Portland, <a href="Beaverton,_Oregon" title="wikilink">Beaverton</a>, <a href="Tigard,_Oregon" title="wikilink">Tigard</a> and <a href="Durham,_Oregon" title="wikilink">Durham</a>, and <a href="unincorporated_area" title="wikilink">unincorporated areas</a> of Washington County. It enters the Tualatin River about  above the Tualatin's confluence with the <a href="Willamette_River" title="wikilink">Willamette River</a> at <a href="West_Linn,_Oregon" title="wikilink">West Linn</a>.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a><a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a><a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>For thousands of years, the Atfalati (Tualatin) tribe of the <a href="Kalapuya" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kalapuya</a> inhabited the watershed. The first settler of European descent, Augustus Fanno, for whom the creek is named, arrived in the mid-19th century. He established an onion farm in what became Beaverton. <a href="Augustus_Fanno_Farmhouse" title="wikilink">Fanno Farmhouse</a>, the restored family home, is a <a href="Century_Farm" title="wikilink">Century Farm</a> on the <a href="National_Register_of_Historic_Places" title="wikilink">National Register of Historic Places</a> and is one of 14 urban parks in a narrow corridor along the creek.</p>
<p>Although heavily polluted, the creek supports aquatic life, including <a href="cutthroat_trout" title="wikilink">cutthroat trout</a> in its upper reaches. Watershed councils such as the Friends of Fanno Creek and government agencies have worked to limit pollution and to restore native vegetation in <a href="riparian" class="uri" title="wikilink">riparian</a> zones.</p>
<h2 id="course">Course</h2>
<p>Fanno Creek arises at an elevation of  above <a href="sea_level" title="wikilink">sea level</a> and falls  between source and <a href="mouth_(river)" title="wikilink">mouth</a> to an elevation of .<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a><a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> The main stem begins at about <a href="river_mile" title="wikilink">river mile</a> (RM) 15 or river kilometer (RK) 24 in the <a href="Hillsdale,_Portland,_Oregon" title="wikilink">Hillsdale</a> neighborhood of southwest Portland, in Multnomah County. The creek flows west along the north side of <a href="Oregon_Route_10" title="wikilink">Oregon Route 10</a> (the Beaverton–Hillsdale Highway), passing Albert Kelly Park and receiving Ivey Creek and Bridlemile Creek on the right before reaching the <a href="United_States_Geological_Survey" title="wikilink">United States Geological Survey</a> (USGS) stream gauge at Southwest 56th Avenue  from the mouth. Shortly thereafter and in quick succession, it enters <a href="Washington_County,_Oregon" title="wikilink">Washington County</a> and the unincorporated community of <a href="Raleigh_Hills,_Oregon" title="wikilink">Raleigh Hills</a>, crosses under Route 10, and receives Sylvan Creek on the right. Here the stream turns south, passing through Bauman Park, where Vermont Creek enters on the left about  from the mouth, and then southwest to flow through the Portland Golf Club and Vista Brook Park, where Woods Creek enters on the left. From here it flows west again for about , passing through Fanno Creek Trail Park and entering Beaverton about  from the mouth before turning sharply south and flowing under <a href="Oregon_Route_217" title="wikilink">Oregon Route 217</a> (Beaverton–Tigard Highway).<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a><a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a><a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a><a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<p>Fanno Creek then flows roughly parallel to Route 217 for about  through Fanno Creek Park and Greenway Park. Near the southern end of Greenway Park, the creek passes under <a href="Oregon_Route_210" title="wikilink">Oregon Route 210</a> (Scholls Ferry Road), and enters Tigard about  from the mouth. In quick succession, Hiteon Creek enters on the right, Ash Creek on the left, and Summer Creek on the right before the creek reaches Woodard Park, goes under <a href="Oregon_Route_99W" title="wikilink">Oregon Route 99W</a> (Southwest Pacific Highway), and flows through Fanno Park and Bonita Park as well as residential neighborhoods. Between the two parks, Red Rock Creek enters on the left about  from the mouth. Slightly downstream of Bonita Park, Ball Creek enters on the left. Fanno Creek then enters Durham, passes a USGS gauging station  from the mouth, flows through Durham City Park, and empties into the Tualatin River  from its confluence with the Willamette </p>

<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<p><img src="Fanno_Farmhouse.jpg" title="fig:Fanno Farmhouse was the home of Augustus Fanno, for whom the creek is named. Built in 1859 and restored by the Tualatin Hills Park and Recreation District, it was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1984." alt="Fanno Farmhouse was the home of Augustus Fanno, for whom the creek is named. Built in 1859 and restored by the Tualatin Hills Park and Recreation District, it was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1984." />The first people of the Fanno Creek watershed were the Atfalati or Tualaty tribe of the <a href="Kalapuya" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kalapuya</a>, or &quot;long grass&quot; people, who inhabited large parts of the Willamette Valley for up to 10,000 years before the arrival of <a href="European_American" title="wikilink">European Americans</a>. The valleys of the Willamette River and its major tributaries such as the Tualatin River consisted of open grassland maintained by annual burning, with scattered groves of trees along the rivers and creeks. The Kalapuya moved from place to place in good weather to fish, to hunt small animals, birds, waterfowl, deer, and elk, and to gather nuts, seeds, roots, and berries. Important foods included <a href="Camassia" title="wikilink">camas</a> and <a href="Sagittaria" title="wikilink">wapato</a>. In addition to fishing for eels, suckers, and trout, the Atfalati traded for salmon from <a href="Chinookan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Chinookan</a> tribes near <a href="Willamette_Falls" title="wikilink">Willamette Falls</a>. During the winter, the Kalapuya lived in longhouses in settled villages. Their population was greatly reduced after contact in the late 18th century with Europeans, who carried <a href="smallpox" class="uri" title="wikilink">smallpox</a>, <a href="syphilis" class="uri" title="wikilink">syphilis</a>, and <a href="malaria" class="uri" title="wikilink">malaria</a>. Added pressure came from white settlers who seized and fenced native land, regarded it as private property, and sometimes punished natives for trespassing. Of the original population of 1,000 to 2,000 Atfalati reported in 1780, only 65 remained in 1851. In 1855, the U.S. government sent the survivors to the <a href="Grand_Ronde_Community" title="wikilink">Grande Ronde</a> reservation further west.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a></p>
<p>Fanno Creek is named after Augustus Fanno, the first European American settler along the creek. In 1847, he started an onion farm on a  <a href="Donation_Land_Claim_Act" title="wikilink">donation land claim</a> in what later became part of Beaverton. Other 19th century newcomers along the creek engaged mainly in logging, farming, and dairy farming until the <a href="Southern_Pacific_Railroad" title="wikilink">Southern Pacific Railroad</a> and the <a href="Oregon_Electric_Railway" title="wikilink">Oregon Electric Railway</a> lines made the watershed more accessible for urban development around the turn of the century. The Oregon Electric, a  system built between 1903 and 1915, ran between downtown Portland and <a href="Garden_Home-Whitford,_Oregon" title="wikilink">Garden Home</a> in the Fanno Creek watershed, where it split into branches leading to <a href="Salem,_Oregon" title="wikilink">Salem</a> and <a href="Forest_Grove,_Oregon" title="wikilink">Forest Grove</a>. The Southern Pacific began running electric trains, known as the Red Electric, in the watershed in 1912. The company that eventually became <a href="Portland_General_Electric" title="wikilink">Portland General Electric</a> installed electric service in the area, and by 1915 the population of the upper Fanno Creek neighborhoods of <a href="Multnomah,_Portland,_Oregon" title="wikilink">Multnomah</a>, <a href="Maplewood,_Portland,_Oregon" title="wikilink">Maplewood</a>, Hillsdale, and <a href="West_Portland_Park,_Portland,_Oregon" title="wikilink">West Portland Park</a> had grown to 2,000.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a></p>
<p><img src="WES_train_close_up.JPG" title="fig:WES trains will use the former Oregon Electric line along lower Fanno Creek between Durham and Beaverton." alt="WES trains will use the former Oregon Electric line along lower Fanno Creek between Durham and Beaverton." />After passenger service along the Oregon Electric and Red Electric lines ended in 1933,<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> private autos largely replaced it. Oregon Highway 217 between Durham and Beaverton, and Oregon Highway 10 between Beaverton and Portland, follow the creek. Although passenger rail ceased for nearly 80 years, freight trains continued to use the tracks. In late 2008, a new rail passenger service will begin along a former Oregon Electric line owned by <a href="Portland_and_Western_Railroad" title="wikilink">Portland and Western Railroad</a> in Washington County.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> The <a href="Westside_Express_Service" title="wikilink">Westside Express Service</a> (WES) will run  between Beaverton on the north and <a href="Wilsonville,_Oregon" title="wikilink">Wilsonville</a> on the south.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> The middle stretch of this run lies close to the lower  of Fanno Creek between Beaverton and Durham.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> WES will be the first modern commuter rail in Oregon and one of the few suburb-to-suburb commuter rail lines in the United States.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> At the northern end of the line, WES will connect to the <a href="MAX_Blue_Line" title="wikilink">MAX Blue Line</a>, an east-west <a href="light_rail" title="wikilink">light rail</a> line linking <a href="Hillsboro,_Oregon" title="wikilink">Hillsboro</a> and <a href="Gresham,_Oregon" title="wikilink">Gresham</a> via Portland and the <a href="MAX_Red_Line" title="wikilink">MAX Red Line</a>, with connections to <a href="Portland_International_Airport" title="wikilink">Portland International Airport</a>.</p>
<p>The highways and railroads serve a population that increased most dramatically in the second half of the 20th century. When Beaverton became a city in 1893, it had a population of 400.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> In 1960, it still had only 6,000 residents, but the number soared to 76,000 by the year 2000, although not all of them lived in the watershed.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> Tigard, which did not exist as a city until 1961,<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> grew to 41,000 by the year 2000,<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> all in the watershed.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> The estimated population of the entire watershed reached 123,000 just before the 2000 census.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> Fanno Creek, which had few people living near it until 1850, &quot;is surrounded by the most populous region in Oregon&quot;.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="pollution">Pollution</h2>
<p>Although the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) rated the average water quality of Fanno Creek as &quot;very poor&quot;<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> between 1986 and 1995, it also noted steady improvement over that span. Historically, Fanno Creek has been polluted by urban and industrial sources, small sewage treatment plants, ineffective septic systems, farming and grazing operations, and illegal dumping. Health and environmental concerns led to the closing of substandard wastewater treatment plants in the 1970s, and urban development reduced the number of farms and farm animals along the creek. A ban in 1991 on <a href="phosphate" class="uri" title="wikilink">phosphate</a> detergents, increased connection to municipal sewers, stormwater management, and greater public awareness helped to reduce urban pollution not coming from <a href="Point_source_pollution" title="wikilink">point sources</a>, and water quality improved.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a></p>
<p>DEQ monitors Fanno Creek at Bonita Road in Tigard, at about  from the mouth. On the Oregon Water Quality Index (OWQI) used by DEQ, water quality scores can vary from 10 (worst) to 100 (ideal). The average for Fanno Creek between 1986 and 1995 was 55 but steadily improved to 65, or &quot;poor&quot;,<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> by the end of the period. By comparison, the average in the nearby Willamette River at the Hawthorne Bridge in downtown Portland was 74 during the same years.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> Measurements of water quality at the Tigard site during the years covered by the DEQ report showed high concentrations of phosphates, <a href="fecal_coliforms" title="wikilink">fecal coliform bacteria</a>, and suspended solids, and a high <a href="biochemical_oxygen_demand" title="wikilink">biochemical oxygen demand</a>. Moderately high concentrations of <a href="ammonia" class="uri" title="wikilink">ammonia</a> and <a href="nitrate" class="uri" title="wikilink">nitrate</a> nitrogen occurred during high flows during fall, winter, and spring. High temperatures and low dissolved oxygen concentration in the summer were evidence of <a href="eutrophication" class="uri" title="wikilink">eutrophication</a>.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a></p>
<p>The high fraction of <a href="impervious_surface" title="wikilink">impervious surfaces</a> in the watershed makes it difficult to improve water quality in the creek. The Portland Bureau of Environmental Services estimates that one-third of the surface area of the watershed that lies within its jurisdiction is impervious.<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> All of the roughly  of the surface of Tigard, much of it impervious, drains into Fanno Creek.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a> The watershed watch coordinator for Tualatin Riverkeepers, a volunteer group, was quoted in a July 2008 newspaper article saying that &quot;the biggest impact to Fanno Creek is the impervious area&lt;U+201D&gt;.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a> To slow run-off, reduce erosion, and keep pollutants out of streams, watershed councils, neighborhood groups, and government agencies have been planting native species of vegetation at selected sites throughout the watershed.<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a></p>
