<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<p>In 2007, the <a href="Sons_of_Ben_(MLS_supporters_association)" title="wikilink">Sons of Ben</a> supporter group formed and began advocating for Major League Soccer to grant Philadelphia an expansion team. They are credited with convincing the league that the area already had an established fanbase for soccer.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>Major League Soccer added Philadelphia as its sixteenth team on February 28, 2008.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> The finalization of the club is the result of a $47 million package approved by <a href="Delaware_County,_Pennsylvania" title="wikilink">Delaware County</a> politicians and <a href="Pennsylvania" class="uri" title="wikilink">Pennsylvania</a> governor, <a href="Ed_Rendell" title="wikilink">Ed Rendell</a>, that includes the cost of <a href="Union_Field_at_Chester" title="wikilink">Union Field</a> and a major <a href="urban_renewal" title="wikilink">urban renewal</a> project.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> Keystone Sports &amp; Entertainment's plan for Chester was initiated in late 2006, soon after the <a href="New_Jersey" title="wikilink">New Jersey</a> legislature terminated an earlier proposal for a soccer-specific stadium at <a href="Rowan_University" title="wikilink">Rowan University</a>.</p>
<p>On May 11, 2009, &quot;Philadelphia Union&quot; was officially announced as the team's name during a ceremony held at Philadelphia's <a href="Philadelphia_City_Hall" title="wikilink">City Hall</a>. This name alludes to the Union of the <a href="Thirteen_Colonies" title="wikilink">Thirteen Colonies</a>, of which Philadelphia was the first capital.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> The team's name was chosen following a fan poll held between January 19, 2009 and February 6, 2009. The other three options were AC Philadelphia, SC Philadelphia, and Philadelphia City.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a><a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> Before the Union moniker, the Sons of Ben nicknamed the team as the &quot;Zolos.&quot; At a &quot;Meet-the-Owners&quot; event held two days before the expansion press conference in Chester, they wore nametags with handwritten numbers intended to read &quot;2010.&quot; The number was mistakenly interpreted as &quot;ZOLO&quot; by ownership group member, <a href="Nick_Sakiewicz" title="wikilink">Nick Sakiewicz</a>. This led to Philadelphia Union being referred to as the &quot;Zolos&quot; in a series of inside jokes by the group.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="colors-and-badge">Colors and badge</h2>
<p>Philadelphia Union's colors are navy blue and gold, representing the primary colors of the <a href="Continental_Army" title="wikilink">Continental Army</a>'s uniforms during the <a href="American_Revolutionary_War" title="wikilink">American Revolutionary War</a>. The team's primary logo is circular, symbolizing unity. Its thirteen gold stars represent the original Thirteen Colonies, while the shield's contour derives from the Philadelphia coat of arms. The rattlesnake pays homage to a political cartoon by <a href="Benjamin_Franklin" title="wikilink">Benjamin Franklin</a> that was featured in the 1754 <em><a href="Pennsylvania_Gazette_(newspaper)" title="wikilink">Pennsylvania Gazette</a></em>. The rattlesnake eventually became a national symbol during the American Revolution, representing the danger of disunity, and was featured on the <a href="Gadsden_flag" title="wikilink">Gadsden flag</a>.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> The light blue in the middle of the badge is a tribute to the Sons of Ben, and is further derived from the <a href="Flag_of_Philadelphia,_Pennsylvania" title="wikilink">civic flag of Philadelphia</a>.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<p>Union's secondary logo is a simplified version of the above design that consists of the blue shield with the rattlesnake, augmented with a gold border and a ribbon bearing the team's official motto: &quot;jungite aut perite&quot;, a <a href="Latin" class="uri" title="wikilink">Latin</a> translation of the phrase &quot;<a href="Join,_or_Die" title="wikilink">join or die</a>&quot;, which was also used in the 1754 <a href="Benjamin_Franklin" title="wikilink">Benjamin Franklin</a> political cartoon mentioned above. <a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>

The Sons of Ben petitioned Major League Soccer to expand to the Philadelphia market until the official expansion announcement was made in January 2008.
