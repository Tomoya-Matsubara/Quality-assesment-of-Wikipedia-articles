<p><strong>Kylie Ann Minogue</strong>, <a href="Order_of_the_British_Empire" title="wikilink">OBE</a>, (born 28 May 1968), is an Australian pop <a href="singer" class="uri" title="wikilink">singer</a>-<a href="songwriter" class="uri" title="wikilink">songwriter</a> and occasional <a href="actress" class="uri" title="wikilink">actress</a>. She rose to prominence in the late 1980s through her role in the Australian television <a href="soap_opera" title="wikilink">soap opera</a> <em><a href="Neighbours" class="uri" title="wikilink">Neighbours</a></em>, before commencing her career as a <a href="recording_artist" title="wikilink">recording artist</a> in 1987.</p>
<p>Signed to a contract by <a href="United_Kingdom" title="wikilink">English</a> <a href="songwriter" title="wikilink">songwriters</a> and <a href="record_producer" title="wikilink">producers</a> <a href="Stock_Aitken_Waterman" title="wikilink">Stock, Aitken &amp; Waterman</a> in 1987, she achieved a string of hit records throughout the world. Her popularity waned during the early 1990s, leading her to part company from Stock, Aitken &amp; Waterman in 1992. During the mid to late 1990s, Minogue distanced herself from her earlier work and attempted to establish herself as a credible and independent performer and songwriter. Her projects were widely publicised, but her <a href="album" title="wikilink">albums</a> failed to attract a substantial audience and resulted in the lowest sales of her career at the time. She returned to popularity as a <a href="pop_music" title="wikilink">pop</a> artist in 2000, and became well-known for her elaborate <a href="music_video" title="wikilink">music videos</a> and expensively mounted stage shows. Diagnosed with <a href="breast_cancer" title="wikilink">breast cancer</a> in 2005, Minogue returned to performing and recording in late 2006 after a period of convalescence.</p>
<p>Although she was dismissed by some critics during her early career, she has achieved longevity as a pop music artist. She has sold in excess of 60 million records,<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> and has achieved her greatest successes in <a href="Australia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Australia</a>, <a href="Europe" class="uri" title="wikilink">Europe</a>, <a href="Asia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Asia</a> and <a href="Latin_America" title="wikilink">Latin America</a>. She was awarded an OBE in 2008 for services to music.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a><a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>

<p>Kylie Ann Minogue was born at 11:00am AEST at Bethlehem Private Hospital in Caulfield South, Melbourne, Australia, the first child of Ronald Charles Minogue, an accountant of Irish ancestry <a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> and Carol Ann (nee Jones), a former <a href="dancer" class="uri" title="wikilink">dancer</a> from <a href="Maesteg" class="uri" title="wikilink">Maesteg</a>, <a href="Wales" class="uri" title="wikilink">Wales</a>.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> Her sister, <a href="Dannii_Minogue" title="wikilink">Dannii</a>, is also a pop singer,<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> and her brother, Brendan, works as a news cameraman in Australia.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>

<p>Raised in the inner Melbourne suburb of Surrey Hills, the Minogue sisters began their careers as children on <a href="television_in_Australia" title="wikilink">Australian television</a>,<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> and from the age of twelve, Kylie appeared in small roles in <a href="soap_opera" title="wikilink">soap operas</a> such as <em><a href="The_Sullivans" title="wikilink">The Sullivans</a></em> and <em><a href="Skyways_(TV_series)" title="wikilink">Skyways</a></em>, before being cast in one of the lead roles in <em><a href="The_Henderson_Kids" title="wikilink">The Henderson Kids</a></em>.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> She gave her first singing performance in 1983, on the weekly music programme <em><a href="Young_Talent_Time" title="wikilink">Young Talent Time</a></em> which featured Dannii as a regular performer. Dannii's success in this program overshadowed Kylie's acting achievements,<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> until Kylie was cast in the soap opera <em><a href="Neighbours" class="uri" title="wikilink">Neighbours</a></em> in 1986.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>

<p>A duet with Donovan, titled &quot;<a href="Especially_for_You" title="wikilink">Especially for You</a>&quot;, sold over one million copies in the UK in early 1989.

<p>The singles from <em>Rhythm of Love</em> sold well in Europe and Australia and were popular in British nightclubs.

<p>Australian artist <a href="Nick_Cave" title="wikilink">Nick Cave</a> had been interested in working with Minogue since hearing &quot;Better the Devil You Know&quot;, saying it contained &quot;one of pop music's most violent and distressing lyrics&quot; and &quot;when Kylie Minogue sings these words, there is an innocence to her that makes the horror of this chilling lyric all the more compelling&quot;.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> They collaborated on &quot;<a href="Where_the_Wild_Roses_Grow" title="wikilink">Where the Wild Roses Grow</a>&quot; (1995), a brooding ballad whose lyrics narrated a murder from the points of view of both the murderer (Cave), and his victim (Minogue), and its success demonstrated that Minogue could be accepted outside of her established genre as a pop artist. It received widespread attention in Europe, where it reached the top 10 in several countries, and acclaim in Australia where it reached number two,<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> and won <a href="Australian_Recording_Industry_Association" title="wikilink">ARIA Awards</a> for &quot;Song of the Year&quot; and &quot;Best Pop Release&quot;. Following concert appearances with Cave, Minogue recited the lyrics to &quot;I Should Be So Lucky&quot; as poetry in London's <a href="Royal_Albert_Hall" title="wikilink">Royal Albert Hall</a> &quot;Poetry Jam&quot;, at the suggestion of Cave, and later credited him with giving her the confidence to express herself artistically, saying: &quot;He taught me to never veer too far from who I am, but to go further, try different things, and never lose sight of myself at the core. For me, the hard part was unleashing the core of myself and being totally truthful in my music&quot;.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a></p>

He began taking photographs of her that downplayed her glamour, with the aim of attracting a more diverse audience, and she drew inspiration from artists such as <a href="Shirley_Manson" title="wikilink">Shirley Manson</a> and <a href="Garbage_(band)" title="wikilink">Garbage</a>, <a href="Bj&lt;U+00F6&gt;rk" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bj&lt;U+00F6&gt;rk</a>, <a href="Tricky" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tricky</a> and <a href="U2" class="uri" title="wikilink">U2</a>, and <a href="Japan" title="wikilink">Japanese</a> pop musicians such as <a href="Pizzicato_Five" title="wikilink">Pizzicato Five</a> and <a href="Towa_Tei" title="wikilink">Towa Tei</a>,<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> with whom she would later collaborate on the singles &quot;GBI: German Bold Italic&quot; and &quot;<a href="Sometime_Samurai" title="wikilink">Sometime Samurai</a>&quot;.</p>

<p>Retitled <em>Kylie Minogue</em> in the UK following the death of <a href="Diana,_Princess_of_Wales" title="wikilink">Diana, Princess of Wales</a>, it became the lowest selling album of her career. In Australia, <em>Impossible Princess</em> became her highest selling album since <em>Kylie</em> in 1988, with sales boosted by a highly successful live tour. In reviewing her show, <em><a href="The_Times" title="wikilink">The Times</a></em> wrote of her ability to &quot;mask her thin, often nondescript voice with musical diversity and brittle charisma and genuinely great pop songs by any standard&quot;, and a live album recorded during her tour, titled <em><a href="Intimate_and_Live" title="wikilink">Intimate and Live</a></em>, was successful in Australia.</p>

Afterwards, she embarked upon a concert tour, <em><a href="On_A_Night_like_This_Tour" title="wikilink">On A Night like This Tour</a></em>, which played to sell-out crowds in Australia and the United Kingdom. Her ticket sales in Australia exceeded 200,000 and set a record for a female artist.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a> Her six initial planned shows were increased to twenty-two due to public demand. Minogue was inspired by the style of <a href="Broadway_theatre" title="wikilink">Broadway</a> shows such as <em><a href="42nd_Street_(musical)" title="wikilink">42nd Street</a></em> and films such as <em><a href="Anchors_Aweigh_(film)" title="wikilink">Anchors Aweigh</a></em>, <em><a href="South_Pacific_(1958_film)" title="wikilink">South Pacific</a></em> and the <a href="Fred_Astaire" title="wikilink">Fred Astaire</a> and <a href="Ginger_Rogers" title="wikilink">Ginger Rogers</a> musicals of the 1930s.

She won a &quot;Mo Award&quot; for Australian live entertainment as &quot;Performer of the Year&quot;. Following the tour she was asked by a <em>Seattle Post-Intelligencer</em> journalist what she thought was her greatest strength, and replied, &quot;That I am an all-rounder. If I was to choose any one element of what I do, I don't know if I would excel at any one of them. But put all of them together, and I know what I'm doing.&quot;<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a></p>
<p><em><a href="Fever_(album)" title="wikilink">Fever</a></em>, released in 2001, retained some disco elements and combined them with 1980s <a href="electropop" class="uri" title="wikilink">electropop</a>. It reached number one in Australia, the UK, and throughout Europe, eventually achieving worldwide sales in excess of 6 million.<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a> Its lead single &quot;<a href="Can&#39;t_Get_You_out_of_My_Head" title="wikilink">Can't Get You out of My Head</a>&quot; became the biggest success of her career, reaching number one in over twenty countries.<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a></p>

<p>The subsequent singles &quot;<a href="In_Your_Eyes_(Kylie_Minogue_song)" title="wikilink">In Your Eyes</a>&quot;, &quot;<a href="Love_at_First_Sight_(Kylie_Minogue_song)" title="wikilink">Love at First Sight</a>&quot; and &quot;<a href="Come_into_My_World_(song)" title="wikilink">Come into My World</a>&quot; were substantial successes throughout the world, and Minogue established a presence in the mainstream North American market, achieving particular success on the <a href="nightclub" title="wikilink">club</a> scene. In 2003 she received a <a href="Grammy_Award" title="wikilink">Grammy Award</a> nomination for &quot;Best Dance Recording&quot; for &quot;Love at First Sight&quot;,<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a> and the following year won the same award for &quot;Come into My World&quot;.<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a></p>
<p>Minogue's former stylist and creative director <a href="William_Baker_(fashion_designer)" title="wikilink">William Baker</a> explained that the music videos for the <em>Fever</em> album were inspired by <a href="science_fiction_film" title="wikilink">science fiction films</a>&lt;U+2014&gt;specifically those by <a href="Stanley_Kubrick" title="wikilink">Stanley Kubrick</a>&lt;U+2014&gt;and accentuated the electropop elements of the music by using dancers in the style of <a href="Kraftwerk" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kraftwerk</a>. Alan MacDonald, the designer of the 2002 <em>KylieFever</em> tour, brought those elements into the stage show which drew inspiration from Minogue's past incarnations. The show opened with Minogue as a space age <a href="Vamp_(woman)" title="wikilink">vamp</a>, which she described as &quot;Queen of <a href="Metropolis_(film)" title="wikilink">Metropolis</a> with her drones&quot;, through to scenes inspired by Kubrick's <em><a href="A_Clockwork_Orange_(film)" title="wikilink">A Clockwork Orange</a></em>, followed by the various <a href="persona" title="wikilink">personas</a> of Minogue's career. Minogue said that she was finally able to express herself the way she wanted, and that she had always been &quot;a showgirl at heart&quot;.<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a></p>
<p>Her next album, <em><a href="Body_Language_(Kylie_Minogue_album)" title="wikilink">Body Language</a></em> (2003), was released following an invitation-only concert, titled <em><a href="Money_Can&#39;t_Buy" title="wikilink">Money Can't Buy</a></em>, at the <a href="Hammersmith_Apollo" title="wikilink">Hammersmith Apollo</a> in London. The event marked the presentation of a new visual style, designed by Minogue and Baker, inspired in part by <a href="Brigitte_Bardot" title="wikilink">Brigitte Bardot</a>, about whom Minogue commented: &quot;I just tended to think of BB as, well, she's a sexpot, isn't she? She's one of the greatest pinups. But she was fairly radical in her own way at that time. And we chose to reference the period, which was ... a perfect blend of coquette and rock and roll.&quot;<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a></p>
<p>The show attracted mixed reviews, with the main criticisms being that nothing substantially new was presented, and that the new songs did not match the appeal of her previous hits. Despite this, the concert was made into a successful television special that drew high ratings.</p>
<p>The album downplayed the disco style and Minogue said she was inspired by 1980s artists such as <a href="Scritti_Politti" title="wikilink">Scritti Politti</a>, <a href="Human_League" title="wikilink">Human League</a>, <a href="Adam_and_the_Ants" title="wikilink">Adam and the Ants</a> and <a href="Prince_(musician)" title="wikilink">Prince</a>, blending their styles with elements of <a href="hip_hop_music" title="wikilink">hip hop</a>.<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a> It received positive reviews with <em>Billboard Magazine</em> writing of &quot;Minogue's knack for picking great songs and producers&quot;.<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a> <em>All Music</em> described it as &quot;a near perfect pop record... <em>Body Language</em> is what happens when a dance-pop diva takes the high road and focuses on what's important instead of trying to shock herself into continued relevance&quot;.<a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a> Sales of <em>Body Language</em> were lower than anticipated after the success of <em>Fever</em>,<a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a><a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a> though the first single, &quot;<a href="Slow_(song)" title="wikilink">Slow</a>&quot;, was a UK number-one hit.<a href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a> After reaching number one on the US club chart, &quot;Slow&quot; received a Grammy Award nomination in the Best Dance Recording category.<a href="#fn67" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a> <img src="kylieShowgirl.jpg" title="fig:Minogue performing during her Showgirl tour (2005)." alt="Minogue performing during her Showgirl tour (2005)." width="200" /></p>
<p>Minogue released her second official greatest hits album in November 2004, entitled <em><a href="Ultimate_Kylie" title="wikilink">Ultimate Kylie</a></em>, along with her music videos on a <a href="DVD" class="uri" title="wikilink">DVD</a> compilation of the same title.

<p>In 1990 Minogue was in a relationship with <a href="INXS" class="uri" title="wikilink">INXS</a> lead singer <a href="Michael_Hutchence" title="wikilink">Michael Hutchence</a>, which furthered her attempts to gain acceptance as a mature performer, with Hutchence saying his favourite hobby was &quot;corrupting Kylie&quot;, and writing the INXS hit song &quot;<a href="Suicide_Blonde" title="wikilink">Suicide Blonde</a>&quot; in reference to her.<a href="#fn136" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref136"><sup>136</sup></a> By 1997 Minogue was involved in a relationship with <a href="France" title="wikilink">French</a> photographer <a href="Stephane_Sednaoui" title="wikilink">Stephane Sednaoui</a>.<a href="#fn137" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref137"><sup>137</sup></a></p>

<h3 id="breast-cancer">Breast cancer</h3>
<p>Minogue's breast cancer diagnosis in 2005 led to the postponement of the remainder of her <a href="Showgirl_-_The_Greatest_Hits_Tour" title="wikilink">Showgirl - The Greatest Hits Tour</a> and her withdrawal from the <a href="Glastonbury_Festival" title="wikilink">Glastonbury Festival</a>.<a href="#fn143" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref143"><sup>143</sup></a><a href="#fn144" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref144"><sup>144</sup></a></p>

<p>Minogue underwent surgery on 21 May 2005 at the private Catholic Cabrini Hospital in <a href="Malvern,_Victoria" title="wikilink">Malvern</a>.<a href="#fn149" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref149"><sup>149</sup></a> Friends such as <a href="Olivia_Newton-John" title="wikilink">Olivia Newton-John</a> (who had overcome her own battle against the illness several years earlier) urged the media and fans to respect Minogue's privacy.<a href="#fn150" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref150"><sup>150</sup></a> Soon after, Minogue commenced <a href="chemotherapy" class="uri" title="wikilink">chemotherapy</a> as part of her treatment regimen.</p>
<p>Minogue issued a public statement, thanking her fans for their support and urging them not to worry. On 8 July 2005, she made her first public appearance after her surgery, when she visited a children's cancer ward at Melbourne's Royal Children's Hospital. She returned to France where she completed her <a href="chemotherapy" class="uri" title="wikilink">chemotherapy</a> treatment at the Institut Gustave-Roussy in <a href="Villejuif" class="uri" title="wikilink">Villejuif</a>, near Paris.<a href="#fn151" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref151"><sup>151</sup></a></p>
<p>In December 2005, Minogue released a digital-only single, &quot;<a href="Over_the_Rainbow_(Kylie_Minogue_single)" title="wikilink">Over the Rainbow</a>&quot;, a live recording from her Showgirl tour. During the early months of 2006, media began reporting Minogue's upcoming projects and the general improvement in her health. In June 2006, she was reported to be recording material for a new album,<a href="#fn152" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref152"><sup>152</sup></a> collaborating with <a href="Scissor_Sisters" title="wikilink">Scissor Sisters</a>, <a href="Steve_Anderson" title="wikilink">Steve Anderson</a>, <a href="Richard_Stannard_(songwriter)" title="wikilink">Richard Stannard</a>, <a href="Johnny_Douglas" title="wikilink">Johnny Douglas</a>, Ash Thomas, and <a href="Teddy_Riley_(new_jack_swing)" title="wikilink">Teddy Riley</a> while also making preparations to continue her newly renamed <a href="Showgirl_-_Homecoming_Tour" title="wikilink">Showgirl Homecoming</a> tour.</p>

<p><img src="Kylie_minogue_statue_at_waterfront_city.jpg" title="fig:Bronze statue of Kylie Minogue at Waterfront City, Melbourne Docklands." alt="Bronze statue of Kylie Minogue at Waterfront City, Melbourne Docklands." />  Throughout her professional life, Minogue has been the subject of intense media interest in both the United Kingdom and Australia, which remained constant even while her success as a recording artist had temporarily fluctuated. Her efforts to be taken seriously as a musician have sometimes been hindered by her high profile as noted by <em><a href="The_Australian" title="wikilink">The Australian</a></em>, who wrote in 1997, &quot;When you have to lug around an image the size of Kylie's, it's difficult for any music you produce to match the hype&lt;U+2014&gt;especially in a country that gives scant credibility to pop&quot;.<a href="#fn156" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref156"><sup>156</sup></a></p>
<p>Minogue is regarded as a <a href="gay_icon" title="wikilink">gay icon</a>, which she encourages with comments such as &quot;I am not a traditional gay icon. There's been no tragedy in my life, only tragic outfits.&quot; While part of her appeal lies in her flamboyant costumes and her confident sexual posturing, she acknowledges the <a href="homosexuality" title="wikilink">gay</a> community throughout the world by performing at gay venues and events, and by openly supporting <a href="AIDS" class="uri" title="wikilink">AIDS</a> charities and <a href="LGBT_rights_by_country" title="wikilink">gay rights</a> causes. Her male dancers have often displayed overt <a href="homosexual" class="uri" title="wikilink">homosexual</a> attires and attitudes. She has said that she believes gay fans responded to her apparent distress when the news media began heavily criticising her in 1989, and that those fans have remained loyal, explaining, &quot;My gay audience has been with me from the beginning... they kind of adopted me&quot;.<a href="#fn157" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref157"><sup>157</sup></a></p>
<p>After playing the &quot;<a href="girl_next_door" title="wikilink">girl next door</a>&quot; in her early music videos, Minogue began to touch on adult themes: a mature relationship in &quot;Better the Devil You Know&quot;, <a href="lesbian" class="uri" title="wikilink">lesbian</a> posturing and <a href="drag_queen" title="wikilink">drag queens</a> in &quot;What Do I Have to Do&quot;, <a href="telephone_sex" title="wikilink">telephone sex</a> in &quot;Confide in Me&quot;, and <a href="prostitution" class="uri" title="wikilink">prostitution</a> in &quot;On a Night like This&quot;. She performed a slow strip tease in the <em><a href="Barbarella_(film)" title="wikilink">Barbarella</a></em>-inspired &quot;Put Yourself in My Place&quot; and wore revealing costumes in many of her videos, most notably &quot;Spinning Around&quot; and &quot;Can't Get You Out of My Head&quot;. She satirised her image in the video for &quot;Did It Again&quot;, in which the four major incarnations of her career, &quot;Indie Kylie&quot;, &quot;Dance Kylie&quot;, &quot;Sex Kylie&quot;, and &quot;Cute Kylie&quot; battled for supremacy. Her evolving image and often overt sexuality led to some critical comparisons to <a href="Madonna_(entertainer)" title="wikilink">Madonna</a>.<a href="#fn158" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref158"><sup>158</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1993, <a href="Baz_Luhrmann" title="wikilink">Baz Luhrmann</a> introduced Minogue to the photographer <a href="Bert_Stern" title="wikilink">Bert Stern</a>, notable for his work with <a href="Marilyn_Monroe" title="wikilink">Marilyn Monroe</a>. Stern photographed her in <a href="Los_Angeles,_California" title="wikilink">Los Angeles</a> and, comparing her to Monroe, commented that she had a &quot;similar vulnerability and awareness of the camera&quot;.</p>
<p>During her career she has chosen photographers who attempt to create a new &quot;look&quot; for her, and the resulting photographs have appeared in a variety of magazines, from the cutting edge <em><a href="The_Face_(magazine)" title="wikilink">The Face</a></em> to the more traditionally sophisticated <em><a href="Vogue_(magazine)" title="wikilink">Vogue</a></em> and <em><a href="Vanity_Fair_(magazine)" title="wikilink">Vanity Fair</a></em>, making the Minogue face and name known to a broad group of people. Stylist <a href="William_Baker" title="wikilink">William Baker</a> has suggested that this is part of the reason she has entered in the mainstream <a href="pop_culture" title="wikilink">pop culture</a> of Europe more successfully than many other pop singers who concentrate simply on selling records.<a href="#fn159" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref159"><sup>159</sup></a></p>
<p>Despite her commercial success, and her acceptance by a large audience as a contemporary <a href="sex_symbol" title="wikilink">sex symbol</a>, her critics describe her willingness to display her body as an attempt to disguise a lack of talent. Her detractors, such as those discussed in the book <em>La La La</em>, have described her as a &quot;one dimensional performer&quot; and &quot;pretty, but mindless and talentless&quot;. <a href="Miki_Berenyi" title="wikilink">Miki Berenyi</a> of the group <a href="Lush_(band)" title="wikilink">Lush</a> said &quot;I have a massive problem with her because she epitomises the acceptable role ... it's a shame she gets so much credibility when there are so many women worth a hundred times that. It's war&lt;U+2014&gt;you shouldn't stick up for Kylie, she should be fought at every turn&quot;.<a href="#fn160" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref160"><sup>160</sup></a> At the 2007 Q Music Awards, at which Minogue won the Q Idol Award, <a href="Ian_Brown" title="wikilink">Ian Brown</a>, former lead singer of the <a href="Stone_Roses" title="wikilink">Stone Roses</a> savaged Minogue, saying &quot;I don't know what Kylie's doing at a music awards to be honest. I don't think she's cute. I don't think she's good looking. Her music's rubbish - she makes music for little kids. I'm sorry if it sounds like I'm putting her down, but there's a lot of great minds out there making music and she's not one of them.&quot;<a href="#fn161" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref161"><sup>161</sup></a></p>
<p>Minogue has often spoken of the stability of the team she works with. Her parents, Ron and Carol Minogue, are actively involved in her career; her father, an accountant, is her financial advisor and her mother has joined her on each of her tours. She has been managed by Terry Blamey since 1987 and the close network, along with her Stock, Aitken and Waterman origins, have led to comments that she is &quot;manufactured&quot;, an assessment which Minogue has admitted is partly accurate, saying, &quot;if you're part of a record company, I think to a degree it's fair to say that you're a manufactured product. You're a product and you're selling a product. It doesn't mean that you're not talented and that you don't make creative and business decisions about what you will and won't do and where you want to go... Ultimately, yes, it's my name and I have to deliver the goods. But it doesn't happen without a team. So I try and work with the best people I can and take from them what I can. Hopefully I enhance what they do as well&quot;<a href="#fn162" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref162"><sup>162</sup></a> William Baker has described her status as a sex symbol as a &quot;double edged sword&quot; observing that &quot;we always attempted to use her sex appeal as an enhancement of her music and to sell a record. But now it has become in danger of eclipsing what she actually is: a pop singer&quot;.<a href="#fn163" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref163"><sup>163</sup></a></p>
<p>In January 2007 <a href="Madame_Tussaud" title="wikilink">Madame Tussaud</a>'s in London unveiled a new waxwork of Minogue. This is her fourth waxwork and only <a href="Elizabeth_II_of_the_United_Kingdom" title="wikilink">Queen Elizabeth II</a> has had more models created.<a href="#fn164" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref164"><sup>164</sup></a><a href="#fn165" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref165"><sup>165</sup></a> On 23 November 2007 a bronze statue of Minogue by sculptor <a href="Peter_Corlett" title="wikilink">Peter Corlett</a> was unveiled at <a href="Melbourne_Docklands" title="wikilink">Melbourne Docklands</a> for permanent display.<a href="#fn166" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref166"><sup>166</sup></a> The sculpture took 3 months to create with the assistance of a waitress with the same dimensions as Minogue.<a href="#fn167" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref167"><sup>167</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="fashion">Fashion</h3>
<p>Minogue has gained credibility by her association with people such as <a href="fashion_designer" title="wikilink">fashion designer</a> <a href="Jean_Paul_Gaultier" title="wikilink">Jean Paul Gaultier</a>, photographer <a href="Stephane_Sednaoui" title="wikilink">Stephane Sednaoui</a>, and designer <a href="John_Galliano" title="wikilink">John Galliano</a>, who described her as a &quot;blend of <a href="Lolita" class="uri" title="wikilink">Lolita</a> and <a href="Barbarella_(film)" title="wikilink">Barbarella</a>&quot;.<a href="#fn168" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref168"><sup>168</sup></a></p>
<p>In 2000, Minogue performed at the <a href="Sydney_Olympic_Games" title="wikilink">Sydney Olympic Games</a> closing ceremony.
