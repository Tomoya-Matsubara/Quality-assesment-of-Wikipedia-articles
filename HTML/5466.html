<p><strong>No. 79 Wing</strong> was a <a href="Royal_Australian_Air_Force" title="wikilink">Royal Australian Air Force</a> (RAAF) <a href="Wing_(military_aviation_unit)" title="wikilink">wing</a> of <a href="World_War_II" title="wikilink">World War II</a>. It was formed in December 1943 at <a href="Batchelor,_Northern_Territory" title="wikilink">Batchelor, Northern Territory</a>, as part of North Western Area Command. Led by Group Captain <a href="Charles_Eaton_(RAAF_officer)" title="wikilink">Charles Eaton</a>, the wing comprised four <a href="Squadron_(aviation)" title="wikilink">squadrons</a> on its establishment, flying <a href="Bristol_Beaufort" title="wikilink">Beaufort</a> and <a href="North_American_B-25_Mitchell" title="wikilink">B-25 Mitchell</a> bombers and <a href="Bristol_Beaufighter" title="wikilink">Beaufighter</a> heavy fighters. No. 79 Wing took part in the <a href="New_Guinea_campaign" title="wikilink">New Guinea</a> and <a href="North_Western_Area_Campaign" title="wikilink">North Western Area Campaigns</a> during 1944, transferring to bases in <a href="New_Guinea" title="wikilink">New Guinea</a> and later <a href="Morotai" class="uri" title="wikilink">Morotai</a> as the Allies advanced northward. By the end of the Pacific War, the wing was attached to the <a href="Australian_First_Tactical_Air_Force" title="wikilink">Australian First Tactical Air Force</a> and was made up of <a href="No._2_Squadron_RAAF" title="wikilink">Nos. 2</a> and <a href="No._18_(Netherlands_East_Indies)_Squadron_RAAF" title="wikilink">18 (Netherlands East Indies) Squadrons</a>, both flying Mitchells. The latter transferred to the <a href="Netherlands_Air_Force" title="wikilink">Netherlands Air Force</a> in late 1945, while the former returned to Australia where it disbanded the following year.</p>

Its combat units consisted of <a href="No._1_Squadron_RAAF" title="wikilink">Nos. 1</a> and <a href="No._2_Squadron_RAAF" title="wikilink">2 Squadrons</a> (flying <a href="Bristol_Beaufort" title="wikilink">Beaufort</a> light reconnaissance bombers), <a href="No._31_Squadron_RAAF" title="wikilink">No. 31 Squadron</a> (<a href="Bristol_Beaufighter" title="wikilink">Beaufighter</a> long-range fighters), and <a href="No._18_(Netherlands_East_Indies)_Squadron_RAAF" title="wikilink">No. 18 (Netherlands East Indies) Squadron</a> (<a href="North_American_B-25_Mitchell" title="wikilink">B-25 Mitchell</a> medium bombers). The wing was commanded by Group Captain <a href="Charles_Eaton_(RAAF_officer)" title="wikilink">Charles Eaton</a>, whose Dutch personnel called him &quot;Oom Charles&quot; (Uncle Charles).<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a><a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>Operating under the auspices of North Western Area Command (NWA), <a href="Darwin,_Northern_Territory" title="wikilink">Darwin</a>, No. 79 Wing participated in the <a href="New_Guinea_campaign" title="wikilink">New Guinea</a> and <a href="North_Western_Area_Campaign" title="wikilink">North Western Area Campaigns</a> during 1944.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> Through March–April, the Beaufighters attacked Japanese shipping, while the Mitchells and Beauforts bombed <a href="Timor" class="uri" title="wikilink">Timor</a> on a daily basis as a prelude to <a href="Operations_Reckless_and_Persecution" title="wikilink">Operations Reckless and Persecution</a>, the invasions of <a href="Jayapura" title="wikilink">Hollandia</a> and <a href="Aitape" class="uri" title="wikilink">Aitape</a>. Eaton organised a large raid against <a href="South_Central_Timor_Regency" title="wikilink">Su</a>, Dutch Timor, on 19 April. Consisting of thirty-five Mitchells, Beauforts and Beaufighters, the force destroyed the town's barracks and fuel dumps, a result that earned the personal congratulations of the <a href="Air_Officer_Commanding" title="wikilink">Air Officer Commanding</a> NWA, Air Vice Marshal <a href="Adrian_Cole_(RAAF_officer)" title="wikilink">&quot;King&quot; Cole</a>.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a><a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> On the day of the Allied landings, 22 April, the Mitchells and Beaufighters made a daylight raid on <a href="Dili" class="uri" title="wikilink">Dili</a>, Portuguese Timor. The ground assault on Hollandia–Aitape met little opposition, credited in part to the air bombardment leading up to it.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p><img src="18_Sqn_(AWM_P02769-001).jpg" title="fig:B-25 Mitchell bombers from No. 18 (NEI) Squadron in formation near Darwin, 1943" alt="B-25 Mitchell bombers from No. 18 (NEI) Squadron in formation near Darwin, 1943" width="240" /> In May 1944, Nos. 1, 18 and 31 Squadrons attacked Japanese positions in Timor, while No. 2 Squadron was withdrawn from combat to re-equip with Mitchells. No. 79 Wing's light and medium bombers suffered from a lack of suitable targets as they had few airfields in forward areas from which to refuel. No. 2 Squadron returned to operations with Mitchells in June. That month, No. 18 Squadron flew 149 sorties, damaging Japanese airfields and shipping in the Timor area, but lost its commanding officer to anti-aircraft fire during a raid.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> In June–July, No. 79 Wing supported the <a href="Battle_of_Noemfoor" title="wikilink">Allied attack on Noemfoor</a>. No. 18 Squadron was again the wing's most active unit, flying 107 sorties. In September, the Beaufighters and Mitchells attacked Japanese shipping and infrastructure in <a href="Seram_Island" title="wikilink">Ceram</a> and <a href="Sulawesi" title="wikilink">Celebes</a>, but lost nine aircraft and twenty-six crewmen killed, among them Squadron Leader Wilbur Wackett, son of <a href="Commonwealth_Aircraft_Corporation" title="wikilink">Commonwealth Aircraft Corporation</a> manager <a href="Lawrence_Wackett" title="wikilink">Lawrence Wackett</a>.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a><a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> By the end of the month, Mitchell missions were put on hold while replacement crews were trained.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> In late 1944, the decision was made to transfer No. 79 Wing and its Mitchell squadrons from North Western Area Command to Northern Command (formerly <a href="No._9_Operational_Group_RAAF" title="wikilink">No. 9 Operational Group</a>) in <a href="Papua_New_Guinea" title="wikilink">Papua New Guinea</a>, to undertake operations against the Japanese in <a href="New_Britain" title="wikilink">New Britain</a>. No. 31 Squadron was transferred from No. 79 Wing to the <a href="Australian_First_Tactical_Air_Force" title="wikilink">Australian First Tactical Air Force</a> at <a href="Morotai" class="uri" title="wikilink">Morotai</a> in December.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a><a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> The same month, Group Captain Eaton posted out and was replaced by Group Captain <a href="John_Ryland" title="wikilink">John Ryland</a>.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<p>Weather hampered the wing's activities in January 1945. No. 1 Squadron was withdrawn to <a href="Queensland" class="uri" title="wikilink">Queensland</a> to re-equip with <a href="de_Havilland_Mosquito" title="wikilink">Mosquitos</a>, with <a href="No._13_Squadron_RAAF" title="wikilink">No. 13 Squadron</a>, flying <a href="Lockheed_Ventura" title="wikilink">Venturas</a>, taking up the slack on anti-shipping missions. The squadron accounted for around half of the thirty-eight enemy vessels sunk by No. 79 Wing in February, and a similar ratio to the twenty sunk the following month. Wing operations were cut back in March, as preparations were made to transfer the Mitchells to <a href="Jacquinot_Bay" title="wikilink">Jacquinot Bay</a> in New Britain. On 6 April, all twenty available aircraft of Nos. 2 and 18 Squadrons were ordered to join <a href="Consolidated_B-24_Liberator" title="wikilink">B-24 Liberators</a> of <a href="No._82_Wing_RAAF" title="wikilink">No. 82 Wing</a> in an assault on a Japanese convoy that included the cruiser <em><a href="Japanese_cruiser_Isuzu" title="wikilink">Isuzu</a></em>. The Liberators were late for their rendezvous with the Mitchells off <a href="Sumba" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sumba</a> so the latter, at the very limit of their range, attacked the convoy regardless. They claimed two direct hits without loss, despite anti-aircraft fire from the cruiser and other ships, and frontal attacks by enemy fighters.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> Allied submarines sank the damaged <em>Isuzu</em> the next day.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> In July, following the <a href="Battle_of_North_Borneo" title="wikilink">Battle of North Borneo</a>, No. 79 Wing and its remaining squadrons, Nos. 2 and 18, were transferred to the First Tactical Air Force at <a href="Labuan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Labuan</a>.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> After the Pacific War ended in August 1945, the wing's Mitchells joined Liberators of No. 82 Wing repatriating RAAF personnel from the islands of Borneo to Australia.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> No. 79 Wing Headquarters was disbanded on 8 October.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> The following month, No. 18 Squadron was reassigned to the <a href="Netherlands_Air_Force" title="wikilink">Netherlands Air Force</a>.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> No. 2 Squadron returned to Australia in December, disbanding in mid-1946.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>
