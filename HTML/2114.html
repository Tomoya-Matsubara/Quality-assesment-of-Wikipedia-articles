<p>'''Thomas Danforth ''' (baptized November 20, 1623 &lt;U+2013&gt; November 5, 1699) was a politician, magistrate, and landowner in the <a href="Massachusetts_Bay_Colony" title="wikilink">Massachusetts Bay Colony</a>. A conservative <a href="Puritan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Puritan</a>, he served for many years as one of the colony's councilors and magistrates, generally leading hardline opposition to attempts by the English kings to assert control over the colony. He accumulated land in the central part of the colony that eventually became a major portion of <a href="Framingham,_Massachusetts" title="wikilink">Framingham, Massachusetts</a>. His government roles included administration of territory in present-day <a href="Maine" class="uri" title="wikilink">Maine</a> that was purchased by the colony.</p>
<p>Danforth is probably best known for his role as a judge in some of the <a href="Salem_witch_trials" title="wikilink">Salem witch trials</a> conducted in 1692 and 1693. He is usually depicted in recreations of the Salem trials (including <a href="Arthur_Miller" title="wikilink">Arthur Miller</a>'s play <em><a href="The_Crucible" title="wikilink">The Crucible</a></em> and its movie adaptations) as a harsh and domineering judge, when the historical record shows that he was highly critical of the conduct of the trials, and may have played a role in ending them.</p>
<h2 id="early-life">Early life</h2>
<p>Thomas Danforth was born in <a href="Framlingham" class="uri" title="wikilink">Framlingham</a>, <a href="Suffolk" class="uri" title="wikilink">Suffolk</a>, England and baptized on November 20, 1623.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> He was the eldest son of Nicholas Danforth (1589&lt;U+2013&gt;1638) and Elizabeth Symmes (1596&lt;U+2013&gt;1629).<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> Danforth immigrated with his father, brothers <a href="Samuel_Danforth" title="wikilink">Samuel</a> and Jonathan, and sisters Anna, Elizabeth, and Lydia to <a href="New_England" title="wikilink">New England</a> in 1634, probably aboard the <em><a href="Griffin_(ship)" title="wikilink">Griffin</a></em>.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> The family, along with the 200 or so other passengers aboard, left England to escape persecution for their <a href="Puritan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Puritan</a> beliefs. (<a href="William_Laud" title="wikilink">William Laud</a> had become archbishop in 1633 and begun a crackdown on <a href="Nonconformism" title="wikilink">Nonconformist</a> religious practices that prompted a <a href="Puritan_migration_to_New_England_(1620&lt;U+2013&gt;1640)" title="wikilink">wave of migration</a> to the New World.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a><a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>

<p><img src="HarvardCollegeCharter.jpeg" title="fig:The original charter of Harvard College" alt="The original charter of Harvard College" /> Soon after his arrival in the <a href="Massachusetts_Bay_Colony" title="wikilink">Massachusetts Bay Colony</a> Nicholas Danforth acquired property in <a href="Cambridge,_Massachusetts" title="wikilink">Cambridge</a>, becoming one of the town's leading citizens and a member of the colony's general court (as its assembly was known). He died in 1638, leaving his lands and the care of his younger children to Thomas. In 1643 Danforth was admitted a <a href="freeman_(Colonial)" title="wikilink">freeman</a> of the colony.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> He was appointed <a href="Treasurer" class="uri" title="wikilink">Treasurer</a> of <a href="Harvard_College" title="wikilink">Harvard College</a> in its charter of 1650, and served as a steward of the college from 1669 to 1682.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> From 1659 he sat on the colony's council of assistants, and was elected deputy governor in 1679.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> In 1665 Danforth was member of a commission that oversaw the extension of Massachusetts colonial authority over the territories of what is now southern <a href="Maine" class="uri" title="wikilink">Maine</a>.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<p>Danforth's politics and religion were relatively conservative, with one historian describing him as &quot;the <a href="John_Pym" title="wikilink">Pym</a> of Massachusetts politics&quot;.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> In 1661 the colony was rebuked by <a href="Charles_II_of_England" title="wikilink">King Charles II</a> for its mistreatment of <a href="Quakers" class="uri" title="wikilink">Quakers</a>; the colonial government had banned Quakers from its territory under threat of death, and <a href="Boston_martyrs" title="wikilink">four of them</a> had recently been hanged after repeatedly violating the ban. The king in his letter demanded that the colony allow Quakers and others freedom of religious expression.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> Danforth was one member of a committee that was established to formulate a response. The document the committee drafted was a conservative declaration that the colonial government was essentially sovereign except where its laws conflicted with English law. (By the time the king's letter arrived the colonial government had already lessened the harsh punishments for violating bans.)<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> Two committee members, magistrate <a href="Simon_Bradstreet" title="wikilink">Simon Bradstreet</a> and minister <a href="John_Norton_(Puritan_divine)" title="wikilink">John Norton</a>, were sent to England to argue the colony's case.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<p>When <a href="King_Philip&#39;s_War" title="wikilink">King Philip's War</a> broke out in 1675 (pitting many Native American tribes of southern New England against English colonists), Danforth was involved in some of the events of the war. Many colonists distrusted the <a href="Praying_Indian" title="wikilink">Praying Indians</a> (Christianized Indians living peacefully in communities on the outskirts of English towns), some of whom were attacked by mobs of English settlers seeking revenge for attacks on their communities. Danforth, along with <a href="Daniel_Gookin" title="wikilink">Daniel Gookin</a> and <a href="John_Eliot_(missionary)" title="wikilink">John Eliot</a>, was a vocal support of the Praying Indians, and worked to prevent some of these excesses, at some personal risk.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> In one notable instance Danforth was aboard a small boat with other colonial officials in <a href="Boston_Harbor" title="wikilink">Boston Harbor</a> en route to <a href="Long_Island_(Massachusetts)" title="wikilink">Long Island</a> to inspect facilities for Praying Indians who had been relocated their &quot;for their own safety&quot; when a nearby ship apparently intentionally rammed the smaller vessel. No one was injured in the incident, but all of the older officials were dunked in the cold waters of the harbor.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1680 Danforth was chosen president in the District of Maine by the Massachusetts assembly. The colony had previously governed this territory (roughly the land between the <a href="Piscataqua_River" title="wikilink">Piscataqua</a> and <a href="Kennebec_River" title="wikilink">Kennebec</a> Rivers in what is now southwestern Maine), but its right to do so had been stripped by King Charles. Colonial agents then purchased the territory, and Danforth was appointed to administer it.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> The territory had been devastated and many properties abandoned during King Philip's War, and Danforth acted in effect as a <a href="Lord_Proprietor" title="wikilink">Lord Proprietor</a>, making land grants and reestablishing towns such as <a href="Falmouth,_Maine" title="wikilink">Falmouth</a> and <a href="North_Yarmouth,_Maine" title="wikilink">North Yarmouth</a>. Danforth was rewarded by the colony with a grant of an island in <a href="Casco_Bay" title="wikilink">Casco Bay</a> for this work, which he oversaw until 1686.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
<p><img src="WilliamStoughton-painting.png" title="fig:William Stoughton (artist unknown) headed the judicial proceedings of the Salem witch trials" alt="William Stoughton (artist unknown) headed the judicial proceedings of the Salem witch trials" /> Throughout the 1670s the Massachusetts leadership steadfastly refused to make changes to its administration that were demanded by King Charles.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> At the instigation of agent <a href="Edward_Randolph_(colonial_administrator)" title="wikilink">Edward Randolph</a>, Charles made increasingly specific demands concerning freedom of religion and adherence to colonial trade regulations known as the <a href="Navigation_Acts" title="wikilink">Navigation Acts</a>, and prepared to issue a <em><a href="quo_warranto" title="wikilink">quo warranto</a></em> writ to demand the return of the colonial charter. Danforth was one of the leading opponents to making any accommodation to the king's demands.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> The issue reached a peak in the 1684 election, in which Danforth stood for election as governor representing the hardline party. He was narrowly defeated by the more conciliatory Simon Bradstreet, but retained the post of deputy governor.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a><a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> The colony's attempts at moderation were in vain—the charter was formally annulled on June 18, 1684.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1686 King <a href="James_II_of_England" title="wikilink">James II</a> established the <a href="Dominion_of_New_England" title="wikilink">Dominion of New England</a> as a new colonial entity to govern all of <a href="New_England" title="wikilink">New England</a>. He appointed Massachusetts native <a href="Joseph_Dudley" title="wikilink">Joseph Dudley</a> as its first governor; he was replaced later that year by Sir <a href="Edmund_Andros" title="wikilink">Edmund Andros</a>. Both Dudley and Andros excluded Danforth from their councils, given his opposition to crown authority. The dominion reign, which did not include an elected assembly, was extremely unpopular in Massachusetts for a variety of reasons. When the <a href="Glorious_Revolution" title="wikilink">Glorious Revolution</a> deposed James, Massachusetts Puritan leaders orchestrated <a href="1689_Boston_revolt" title="wikilink">an uprising</a> and arrested Andros, Dudley, and other dominion officials. In the period between the dominion's collapse and the establishment of the <a href="Province_of_Massachusetts_Bay" title="wikilink">Province of Massachusetts Bay</a> in 1692, the old colonial government was temporarily reestablished, and Danforth resumed his offices.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> {{-}}</p>
<h3 id="salem-trials">Salem trials</h3>

<p>When the witch hysteria broke out in <a href="Salem,_Massachusetts" title="wikilink">Salem</a> in late 1691, Danforth was one of several colonial leaders who traveled to Salem in the early months of 1692 as part of a preliminary inquiry into the matter. He led the questioning of some of the suspects, and the panel's findings legitimized in the minds of many the idea that witchcraft was being practiced.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> He was not assigned to the special <a href="Court_of_Oyer_and_Terminer" title="wikilink">Court of Oyer and Terminer</a> that Governor Sir <a href="William_Phips" title="wikilink">William Phips</a> established shortly after his arrival in May 1692, and he was opposed to the manner in which magistrate <a href="William_Stoughton_(Massachusetts)" title="wikilink">William Stoughton</a> conducted the witch trials. In December 1692 Stoughton was elected by the governor's council to head the Massachusetts courts, defeating Danforth by three votes. In early 1693 he sat on Superior Court sessions conducted by Stoughton that continued to hear witchcraft cases. By this time the hysteria was dying down, and the court, sometimes with Danforth leading in Stoughton's absence, generally cleared those accused of witchcraft. Danforth was also sympathetic to the plight of individuals accused, relocating some of them to his lands west of Boston; Salem End Road in Framingham is now in the area where they settled.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="family-and-property">Family and property</h2>
<p>Danforth married Mary Withington in 1644.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> The couple had 12 children, but six of their children died before the age of 3, and Danforth was survived by only three of the others.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> Danforth died in Cambridge on November 5, 1699.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a></p>
<p><img src="Framinghamseal.png" title="fig:The seal of Framingham, Massachusetts; the words &quot;Danforth&#39;s Farm&quot; are visible near the top of the shield." alt="The seal of Framingham, Massachusetts; the words &quot;Danforth&#39;s Farm&quot; are visible near the top of the shield." /> In the 1660s Danforth began to acquire land to the west of Boston. Originally known as &quot;Danforth's Farm&quot;, he began to refer to the estate as &quot;Framingham&quot; in the 1670s in honor of his birthplace.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> Although Danforth continued to reside in Cambridge, he developed these lands, which came to number , by issuing 999 year leases rather than selling parcels.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> By the 1690s a number of somewhat discontiguous communities existed on the land, which petitioned the state for incorporation. Objections were made to the earliest petition (of 1692) by Danforth, since it did not include all of his lands, and a number of subsequent petitions were objected to by neighboring communities.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> It was not until 1700, after Danforth had died, that the town of <a href="Framingham,_Massachusetts" title="wikilink">Framingham</a> was granted a charter.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> The town's seal contains the words &quot;Danforth's Farm&quot; in commemoration of this heritage.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a></p>
<p><a href="Danforth,_Maine" title="wikilink">Danforth, Maine</a> is named in his honor.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> The <a href="Danforth_Museum_of_Art" title="wikilink">Danforth Museum of Art</a>, founded in 1975, is located in Framingham.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="fictional-character-in-the-crucible">Fictional character in <em>The Crucible</em></h2>
<p>Danforth was made the leading judicial figure in <a href="Arthur_Miller" title="wikilink">Arthur Miller</a>'s play <em><a href="The_Crucible" title="wikilink">The Crucible</a></em>, a fictionalized depiction of the Salem trials. Although Miller understood the actual history of the events, William Stoughton is not a character in the play, and Miller portrays Danforth as a domineering and selfish judge, under whose authority many are imprisoned and sentenced to hang.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a><a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> When <a href="John_Proctor" title="wikilink">John Proctor</a>, an accused, defies his authority at the end of the play by refusing to lie and sign a public confession saying that he is a witch and accusing others, he is mercilessly sentenced to hang.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a></p>
<p>Miller also wrote the screenplay for the <a href="The_Crucible_(1996_film)" title="wikilink">1996 film version</a> of the play, in which Danforth (portrayed by actor <a href="Paul_Scofield" title="wikilink">Paul Scofield</a>) is depicted as the principal judicial antagonist.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> In the <a href="The_Crucible_(1957_film)" title="wikilink">1957 film adaptation of the play</a>, whose screenplay was written by <a href="Jean-Paul_Sartre" title="wikilink">Jean-Paul Sartre</a>, Danforth (portrayed by <a href="Raymond_Rouleau" title="wikilink">Raymond Rouleau</a>, who also directed the picture) is portrayed in the same way.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a></p>
