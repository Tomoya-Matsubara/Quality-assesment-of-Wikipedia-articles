<p>&quot;<strong>The Son Also Draws</strong>&quot; is the sixth episode of the <a href="Family_Guy_(season_1)" title="wikilink">first season</a> of the <a href="Animated_cartoon" title="wikilink">animated</a> <a href="Television_comedy" title="wikilink">comedy series</a> <em><a href="Family_Guy" title="wikilink">Family Guy</a></em>. It originally aired on <a href="Fox_Broadcasting_Company" title="wikilink">Fox</a> in the United States on May 9, 1999. The episode follows <a href="Chris_Griffin" title="wikilink">Chris</a> as he is ejected from the Youth Scouts, and his father <a href="Peter_Griffin" title="wikilink">Peter</a> drives the family to Scout headquarters to get him readmitted. During a rest stop at a Native American casino, <a href="Lois_Griffin" title="wikilink">Lois</a> gambles away the family car, and Peter pretends to be a member of the tribe in an attempt to get it back. When he is sent on a vision quest to prove his heritage Chris accompanies him to explain that he does not like the Scouts, and prefers drawing. Delirious from hunger, Peter has a vision of his spiritual guide <a href="Fonzie" class="uri" title="wikilink">Fonzie</a> and on his advice finally listens to Chris. Reconciled, the pair return to the casino and reclaim the car.</p>
<p>&quot;The Son Also Draws&quot; was written by <a href="Ricky_Blitt" title="wikilink">Ricky Blitt</a> and directed by <a href="Neil_Affleck" title="wikilink">Neil Affleck</a>, both working on their first <em>Family Guy</em> episode. The episode guest starred actors <a href="Suzie_Plakson" title="wikilink">Suzie Plakson</a>, <a href="Kevin_Michael_Richardson" title="wikilink">Kevin Michael Richardson</a>, <a href="Fred_Tatasciore" title="wikilink">Fred Tatasciore</a> and <a href="Wally_Wingert" title="wikilink">Wally Wingert</a>. Recurring guest voice actors included writer and animator <a href="Butch_Hartman" title="wikilink">Butch Hartman</a> and actor <a href="Patrick_Bristow" title="wikilink">Patrick Bristow</a>. Much of the episode's humor is structured around <a href="Cutaway_(filmmaking)" title="wikilink">cutaway</a> sequences that parody popular culture, including those centered around <em><a href="Happy_Days" title="wikilink">Happy Days</a></em>, <em><a href="Nova_(TV_series)" title="wikilink">Nova</a></em>, <em><a href="One_Day_at_a_Time" title="wikilink">One Day at a Time</a></em>, and <em><a href="The_More_You_Know" title="wikilink">The More You Know</a></em>.</p>
<p>Critical reception for the episode was positive; certain critics believed the episode was not an &quot;instant classic&quot; in contrast to the remaining episodes of the season but called it &quot;memorable&quot; and &quot;brilliant&quot; nevertheless, while others regarded it as the black sheep of the season. The episode caused controversy in Canada for the episode's final gag, in which Peter states that &quot;Canada sucks.&quot;</p>
<h2 id="plot">Plot</h2>
<p><a href="Chris_Griffin" title="wikilink">Chris Griffin</a> hates being in the &quot;Youth Scouts&quot; (<em>Family Guy</em>{{'}}s version of the <a href="Boy_Scouts_of_America" title="wikilink">Boy Scouts</a>) and wants to quit, but is afraid to tell his father <a href="Peter_Griffin" title="wikilink">Peter</a>. Chris is finally kicked out when he runs over the <a href="Scout_Leader" title="wikilink">troop leader</a> during a <a href="Soap_Box_Derby" title="wikilink">Soap Box Derby</a>. Peter insists on driving the family to Youth Scout headquarters, in <a href="Manhattan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Manhattan</a>, to get Chris readmitted. While they are gone, their talking dog <a href="Brian_Griffin" title="wikilink">Brian</a> is unable to switch the TV channel or turn the TV off, and his intelligence drops sharply after watching daytime programming.</p>
<p>The family stops at a <a href="Native_American_gaming" title="wikilink">Native American casino</a> as Peter needs to use the bathroom, but his wife <a href="Lois_Griffin" title="wikilink">Lois</a> quickly becomes <a href="Problem_gambling" title="wikilink">addicted to gambling</a> and loses the family car. After hearing that Lois has gambled the car away, Peter tries to get it back by claiming to be Native American. The doubtful Indian <a href="American_Indian_elder" title="wikilink">elders</a> demand that he go on a <a href="vision_quest" title="wikilink">vision quest</a> to prove his heritage. Chris accompanies Peter into the wilderness, hoping to tell him that he only wants to draw instead of being in the Scouts. Delirious from hunger, Peter begins talking to <a href="anthropomorphism" title="wikilink">anthropomorphic</a> trees and sees a vision of his spiritual guide, <a href="Fonzie" class="uri" title="wikilink">Fonzie</a>. After hearing Fonzie's advice Peter finally listens to Chris's complaints and realizes his son is a talented artist. They return to the casino and reclaim their car. The episode ends with Lois, Stewie, and <a href="Meg_Griffin" title="wikilink">Meg</a> counteracting stereotypes about Native Americans, Mexicans, and Swedes, respectively, before Peter comments that &quot;<a href="Canada" class="uri" title="wikilink">Canada</a> sucks.&quot;</p>

<h2 id="cultural-references">Cultural references</h2>
<p>Like other <em>Family Guy</em> episodes, &quot;The Son Also Draws&quot; features multiple references to popular culture. The television show the family is watching near the beginning of the show is an episode from the 1974 <a href="American_Broadcasting_Company" title="wikilink">ABC</a> sitcom <em><a href="Happy_Days" title="wikilink">Happy Days</a></em>.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> When the rest of the family is gone on the trip to Manhattan, Brian watches an episode of <em><a href="Nova_(TV_series)" title="wikilink">Nova</a></em>, which is interrupted by a <a href="Public_Broadcasting_Service" title="wikilink">PBS</a> announcement that they will be showing various episodes of <em><a href="One_Day_at_a_Time" title="wikilink">One Day at a Time</a></em>.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> Speed and Pops from <em><a href="Speed_Racer" title="wikilink">Speed Racer</a></em> make an appearance at the Soap Box Derby starting line and again when the Griffins prepare to leave for Manhattan. When Peter has to search for his spiritual guide, it turns out to be Fonzie from <em>Happy Days</em>.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> The end of the episode features a parody of the <em><a href="The_More_You_Know" title="wikilink">The More You Know</a></em> series of <a href="public_service_announcement" title="wikilink">public service announcements</a>.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="reception">Reception</h2>
<p>Reviews for &quot;The Son Also Draws&quot; were mixed to favorable. In his 2008 review, Ahsan Haque of <a href="IGN" class="uri" title="wikilink">IGN</a> rated the episode an 8/10, stating that while the episode is not an &quot;instant classic&quot;, it is &quot;still quite strong&quot; and has &quot;more than a few clever moments&quot;. He also notes that the cutaways are &quot;kept to a minimum&quot;, and much of the humor comes from the storyline. He commented that the episode did not have as much laugh-out-loud moments as other episodes, but stated that it had bolder humor than the show would later be known for.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> In his review of the first volume DVD collection of <em>Family Guy</em>, Aaron Beierle of <a href="DVD_Talk" title="wikilink">DVD Talk</a> listed &quot;The Son Also Draws&quot; as one of the series' &quot;most brilliant moments&quot;, praising the spiritual vision sequence and naming the conversation between Peter and Brian among the best moments of the series, calling the conversation &quot;rolling-on-the-floor funny.&quot;<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<p>Robin Pierson of <em>The TV Critic</em>, however, was far more hostile towards the episode, giving it the lowest rating of the season, a 44 out of 100.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> Pierson believed the episode was &quot;very poor&quot; and called the storyline &quot;lame&quot; and &quot;unfocussed ,&quot; with &quot;a bunch of jokes to match.&quot;<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> The gag at the end of the episode, in which Peter states that &quot;Canada sucks&quot;, inspired anger from Canadian viewers of the show, which lead them to send letters to the show's producers.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> Ricky Blitt, the writer of the episode and the person responsible for the controversial gag, is Canadian.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
