<p><strong>Typhoon Betty</strong> (<a href="Philippine_Atmospheric,_Geophysical_and_Astronomical_Services_Administration" title="wikilink">PAGASA</a> name: <strong>Herming</strong>)<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> was a powerful and destructive <a href="tropical_cyclone" title="wikilink">tropical cyclone</a> that struck the <a href="Philippines" class="uri" title="wikilink">Philippines</a> in August 1987. The seventh <a href="typhoon" class="uri" title="wikilink">typhoon</a> and second super typhoon of the active <a href="typhoon_season" title="wikilink">typhoon season</a>, it formed from the <a href="monsoon_trough" title="wikilink">monsoon trough</a> that spawned a tropical cyclone on August 8 while around positioned well to the east of the Philippines. It drifted northwestward, becoming a tropical storm on August 9 and a typhoon on August 10. Betty turned westward, where it rapidly intensified before attaining peak intensity on August 11. The next day, Typhoon Betty made <a href="landfall_(meteorology)" title="wikilink">landfall</a> in the central Philippines. Betty weakened rapidly over the country, but restrengthened somewhat over the South China Sea. Land interaction weakened Betty slightly before it hit central <a href="Vietnam" class="uri" title="wikilink">Vietnam</a> on August 16. The next day, Betty dissipated.</p>
<p>Across the Philippines, Typhoon Betty brought widespread flooding, which resulted in severe destruction. Damage added up to $100 million (1987 <a href="United_States_Dollar" title="wikilink">USD</a>). In the <a href="Maguindanao" class="uri" title="wikilink">Maguindanao</a> and <a href="Albay" class="uri" title="wikilink">Albay</a> provinces alone, 10,000 people were evacuated and 1,000 were homeless. However, the capital city of <a href="Manila" class="uri" title="wikilink">Manila</a> avoided any serious damage. Nation-wide, around 200,000 people were reportedly homeless, 18,000 of winch were from <a href="Marinduque" class="uri" title="wikilink">Marinduque</a> and another 11,400 resided on <a href="Mindoro_Island" title="wikilink">Mindoro Island</a>. In the former, 4,000 dwellings sustained damage, and all of the banana crop there was lost. In all, 25,518 homes received damage. Roughly 400,000 people were directly affected by the storm. Overall, 85 people were killed and 324 others were wounded. After striking the Philippines, six people were killed by Betty in Vietnam. Approximately 10,000 structures were damaged and 103 people were injured. Elsewhere, in northern Thailand, one person was killed and three others were hurt by the typhoon. Several villages were flooded, and numerous streets were damaged.</p>
<h2 id="meteorological-history">Meteorological history</h2>

<p>The origins of Typhoon Betty can be traced back to a tropical disturbance that was embedded in the <a href="monsoon_trough" title="wikilink">monsoon trough</a> on August 7, which extended from the <a href="Marshall_Islands" title="wikilink">Marshall Islands</a> westward to the <a href="Philippines" class="uri" title="wikilink">Philippines</a>. Intensity estimates via the <a href="Dvorak_technique" title="wikilink">Dvorak technique</a> yielded winds of  around  north-northwest of Belau in the western <a href="Caroline_Islands" title="wikilink">Caroline Islands</a>. Following a rapid increase in organization, the <a href="Joint_Typhoon_Warning_Center" title="wikilink">Joint Typhoon Warning Center</a> (JTWC) issued a <a href="Tropical_Cyclone_Formation_Alert" title="wikilink">Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert</a> (TCFA) for the system early on August 8.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> Meanwhile, the <a href="Japan_Meteorological_Agency" title="wikilink">Japan Meteorological Agency</a> (JMA) started tracking the system.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a>{{#tag:ref|The <a href="Japan_Meteorological_Agency" title="wikilink">Japan Meteorological Agency</a> is the official <a href="Regional_Specialized_Meteorological_Center" title="wikilink">Regional Specialized Meteorological Center</a> for the western Pacific Ocean.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a>|group=&quot;nb&quot;}} Around this time, the <a href="Philippine_Atmospheric,_Geophysical_and_Astronomical_Services_Administration" title="wikilink">Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration</a> also monitored the storm and <a href="Tropical_cyclone_naming" title="wikilink">assigned it with the local name</a> <em>Herming</em>.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> Early on August 9, Betty intensified into a tropical storm about 1,320 km (820 mi) east-southeast of Manila during the morning of August 9.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a>{{#tag:ref|Wind estimates from the JMA and most other basins throughout the world are <a href="maximum_sustained_winds" title="wikilink">sustained</a> over 10 minutes, while estimates from the United States-based Joint Typhoon Warning Center are sustained over 1 minute. 10 minute winds are about 1.14 times the amount of 1 minute winds.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a>|group=&quot;nb&quot;}}</p>

By 0000 UTC on August 11, the agency upgraded Betty to an equivalent of a Category 4 hurricane.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> Later that day, the JMA estimated that Betty attained its peak <a href="maximum_sustained_wind" title="wikilink">maximum sustained wind</a> of  and a minimum <a href="barometric_pressure" title="wikilink">barometric pressure</a> of . However, the JTWC indicated that the system was considerably stronger, with maximum sustained winds of 260 km/h (160 mph). This concluded the storm intensification period; according to the JTWC, Betty strengthened  in a 37 hour time frame.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> Furthermore, Betty was the deepest storm of the season,<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> and <a href="list_of_the_most_intense_tropical_cyclones" title="wikilink">one of the most powerful storms</a> ever recorded.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
<p>At peak, which it maintained for 12 hours,<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> Betty exhibited a small but well-defined <a href="eye_(cyclone)" title="wikilink">eye</a> surrounded by very cold cloud tops.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> Thereafter, Betty began to weaken as it moved over the central <a href="Philippines" class="uri" title="wikilink">Philippines</a>. Accelerating, Betty continued on a westward track while passing south of a <a href="subtropical_ridge" title="wikilink">subtropical ridge</a>. According to the JTWC, winds quickly decreased to , and by the time it emerged into the <a href="South_China_Sea" title="wikilink">South China Sea</a> early on August 13, the typhoon's winds had diminished to , equivalent to a high-end Category 2 on the SSHWS.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> The JMA estimated that Betty was slightly weaker, with winds of .<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> Moving west-northwest, Betty began to deepen over open water.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> By midday, the JMA increased the intensity of Typhoon Betty to .<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> On the morning of August 14, the JTWC remarked that Betty reached its secondary peak intensity of .<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> Despite this, intensity estimates from the JMA note that Betty did not intensify any further.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a></p>
