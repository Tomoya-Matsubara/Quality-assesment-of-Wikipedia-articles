The congregation was established in 1628.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>

<h2 id="middle-collegiate-church">1729 Middle Collegiate Church</h2>
<p>The original Middle Collegiate Church was on Nassau Street near Cedar Street in 1729. &quot;A North Church was added in 1769, to serve a growing congregation.&quot;<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> The church &quot;later became the Post Office, and was demolished in 1882.&quot;<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="second-middle-collegiate-church-or-middle-dutch-church">1839 Second Middle Collegiate Church, or Middle Dutch Church</h2>
<p>The Middle Dutch Church or Middle Collegiate Church (1839), located on Lafayette Place near <a href="Colonnade_Row" title="wikilink">La Grange Terrace</a>, was built as the second Collegiate Church congregation continued to move uptown with the population. Nathan Silver in <em>Lost New York</em> describes this structure as &quot;a single-mindedly classic Greek Revival church by <a href="Isaiah_Rogers" title="wikilink">Isaiah Rogers</a>, perhaps his best work. Unfortunately for posterity, the Dutch Reformed (Collegiate) denomination was wealthy enough to move as frequently as the neighborhood ran down. The church&lt;U+2019&gt;s forerunner was built in 1729 at Nassau Street, later became the Post Office, and was demolished in 1882. After the Lafayette Place church was evacuated in 1887 prior to its destruction, a third church was erected at Second Avenue and 7th Street, 'thoroughly equipped' as one guide said, 'with reading-rooms, gymnasium, and all appliances for aggressive modern church work'.&quot;<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
