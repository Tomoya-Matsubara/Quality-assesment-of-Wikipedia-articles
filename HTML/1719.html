<p><strong>Idel'son</strong> is a <a href="Moon" title="wikilink">lunar</a> <a href="Impact_crater" title="wikilink">crater</a> that is located on the <a href="Far_side_(Moon)" title="wikilink">far side</a> of the <a href="Moon" class="uri" title="wikilink">Moon</a>. It lies just behind the southern lunar limb, in a region that is sometimes brought into view of the <a href="Earth" class="uri" title="wikilink">Earth</a> due to <a href="libration" class="uri" title="wikilink">libration</a>. Idel'son is situated to the southwest of the huge walled plain <a href="Schr&lt;U+00F6&gt;dinger_(crater)" title="wikilink">Schr&lt;U+00F6&gt;dinger</a>.</p>
<p>The northern rim of Idel'son is overlain by the larger crater <a href="Ganswindt_(crater)" title="wikilink">Ganswindt</a>, reversing the usual order of smaller craters on top of larger impacts usually seen on the Moon. The outer <a href="glacis" class="uri" title="wikilink">glacis</a> of Ganswindt covers nearly half the interior floor of Idel'son, reaching to the mid-point. The remainder of the interior and rim of the crater has been partly overlain by ejecta, producing a rounded, lumpy surface. Still the surviving outer rim remains distinct, and is not overlain by any other impacts of note. The largest impact within the interior is a tiny crater next to the southeastern inner wall.</p>
