<p><strong>Pierre-Fran&lt;U+00E7&gt;ois Chabaneau</strong> was a <a href="France" title="wikilink">French</a> chemist who spent much of his life working in Spain. He was one of the first chemists to succeed in producing <a href="malleable" class="uri" title="wikilink">malleable</a> <a href="platinum" class="uri" title="wikilink">platinum</a>. Chabaneau was born in <a href="Dordogne" class="uri" title="wikilink">Dordogne</a>, <a href="France" class="uri" title="wikilink">France</a>, in 1754, and died near his home village in 1842 at the age of 88 years.</p>
<h2 id="early-life">Early life</h2>
<p>Chabaneau was born in 1754 in <a href="Nontron" class="uri" title="wikilink">Nontron</a>, a village in the <a href="Dordogne" class="uri" title="wikilink">Dordogne</a> department of <a href="France" class="uri" title="wikilink">France</a>. His uncle, a member of the <a href="Order_of_Saint_Anthony_(Bavaria)" title="wikilink">order of Saint Anthony</a>, encouraged him to study theology. While Chabaneau excelled in his studies, his distaste for <a href="Metaphysics" title="wikilink">metaphysical speculation</a> led him to antagonize his teachers, which in turn caused him to be expelled from school.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>Sympathetic towards Chabaneau's state of poverty, the director of a <a href="Jesuit" class="uri" title="wikilink">Jesuit</a> college in <a href="Passy" class="uri" title="wikilink">Passy</a> offered him a position as a mathematics professor, despite Chabaneau having only a basic understanding of arithmetic. In studying the material for the next day's lessons, Chabaneau taught himself algebra and geometry. His academic interest soon spread to physics, <a href="natural_history" title="wikilink">natural history</a>, and chemistry.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> At the age of twenty, Chabaneau was convinced to join the newly-established <em>Real Seminario Patriotico</em> at <a href="Bergara" title="wikilink">Vergara</a> to teach French and physics by brothers <a href="Fausto_Elhuyar" title="wikilink">Fausto</a> and <a href="Juan_Jos&lt;U+00E9&gt;_Elhuyar" title="wikilink">Juan Jos&lt;U+00E9&gt; Elhuyar</a>. The two brothers, who later made a name for themselves by isolating metallic <a href="tungsten" class="uri" title="wikilink">tungsten</a>, were the sons of the Count of Pe&lt;U+00F1&gt;aflorida, who had sent them to France to find professors for the Vergara Seminary.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="platinum-research">Platinum research</h2>
<p>After the Elhuyar brothers isolated metallic tungsten in 1783, Chabaneau collaborated with them in researching <a href="platinum" class="uri" title="wikilink">platinum</a>. This did not last long, though, as the brothers had been appointed Directors General of Mining, and soon left Spain for South America.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> <a href="Charles_III_of_Spain" title="wikilink">King Charles III</a> created a public chair of mineralogy, physics and chemistry for Chabaneau in Madrid and provided him with a laboratory for his research. The Count d'Aranda secured the government's entire supply of platinum for Chabaneau's laboratory.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>Chabaneau was able to easily remove most of platinum's natural impurities, including gold, <a href="mercury_(element)" title="wikilink">mercury</a>, lead, copper, and iron, leading him to believe that he was working with pure platinum. However, the metal displayed inconsistent characteristics. At times it was <a href="malleable" class="uri" title="wikilink">malleable</a>, yet at times it was highly <a href="brittle" class="uri" title="wikilink">brittle</a>. Sometimes it was entirely incombustible, yet sometimes it burned readily. These inconsistencies were a result of various impurities: rhodium, palladium, osmium, iridium, and ruthenium. These elements would later come to be known as the <a href="platinum_group" title="wikilink">platinum group</a> metals, but at the time of Chabaneau's research, they had not yet been discovered.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p>So frustrated was Chabaneau by his research that, in 1786, he lost his temper and smashed all of his equipment, exclaiming, &quot;Away with it all! I'll smash the whole business; you shall never again get me to touch the damned metal!&quot;<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> Nevertheless, three months later Chabaneau presented the Count d'Aranda with a 10 cm cube of pure malleable platinum. His process, involving powder metallurgy and intense heating, was kept secret until 1914.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="platinum-age-and-death">Platinum age and death</h2>
<p>Chabaneau realized that the sheer difficulty of working with platinum would lend value to objects made from it.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> He and Don Joaqu&lt;U+00ED&gt;n Cabezas carried on a lucrative business producing platinum ingots and utensils. This marked the beginning of what is now known as the &quot;platinum age in Spain,&quot;<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> during which nearly 18,000 <a href="troy_ounce" title="wikilink">troy ounces</a> of malleable platinum were produced in a span of 22 years. The platinum age ended in 1808 when Chabaneau's laboratory was destroyed during <a href="Napoleonic_Wars" title="wikilink">Napoleon's second invasion</a>.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1799, Chabaneau returned to France seeking rest near his native village of Nontron. There he remained until January 1842, when he died at the age of 88 years.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
