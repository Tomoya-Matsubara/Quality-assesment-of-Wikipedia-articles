<p><strong>Camak House</strong>, at 279 Meigs Street, <a href="Athens,_Georgia" title="wikilink">Athens, Georgia</a>, was built in about 1834 by <a href="James_Camak" title="wikilink">James Camak</a><a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a><a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> and featured in Georgia's early railroad history. An example of <a href="Federal_architecture" title="wikilink">Federal architecture</a>, it has a number of features unusual for its period, including a kitchen within the raised basement and <a href="closet" title="wikilink">closets</a>. Both main floors have four rooms; the stairwell has a mahogany railing, and moldings and trim were made using a Greek key pattern. After long service as a family home, it was used as a Masonic Lodge before being bought by Coca-Cola Enterprises. In 1975 Camak House was listed on the <a href="National_Register_of_Historic_Places" title="wikilink">National Register of Historic Places</a>, but the building had by then fallen into disrepair. It was restored and used as the offices of a law firm. As of December 2011, it is for sale. <a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>

<p>Built atop a hill,<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> Camak House was the first dwelling constructed on Prince Avenue; Meigs Street was added later, cutting off a portion of the original property.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> The architecture is <a href="Federal_architecture" title="wikilink">Federal style</a>,<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> &quot;relatively unusual in Athens&quot;,<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> with locally produced <a href="ironwork" class="uri" title="wikilink">ironwork</a> in the front.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> The <a href="fanlight" class="uri" title="wikilink">fanlight</a> of the central doorway and the <a href="white-washed" class="uri" title="wikilink">white-washed</a> brick construction are typical elements of the style.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> The house has two stories, with a &quot;four-over-four room, central hall plan&quot;<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> &lt;U+2013&gt; a style &quot;based on the standard Greek Revival floor plan&quot;<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> with a &quot;raised basement, a low-hipped roof, and two-story pilasters&quot;.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> The basement originally housed slave quarters and the kitchen; the hazard of fire made it unusual for houses of the period to include a kitchen, but because of Camak House's brick construction the risk was thought to be low.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<p>The floors were constructed using &quot;knot-free heart-pine&quot;, and solid mahogany was used for the railing of the stairwell.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> Details include silver-plated doorknobs, &quot;hand-forged locks and latches&quot;, and &quot;a simple but visually striking Greek key pattern&quot; for moldings and trim.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> Camak House was built with closets &lt;U+2013&gt; a very unusual feature for the time.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
<p>Camak House was the location for a meeting to organize what became &quot;the first successful railroad company in Georgia and only the third such company in the United States&quot;.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> James Camak was named president of the company, and later served as the first president of Georgia Railroad Bank.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
<p>Five generations<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> of Camaks lived in the house until 1947.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> In her book <em>Historic Houses of Athens</em>, Charlotte Thomas Marshall notes that &quot;It was not until 1904, eleven years after Dr. Camak's [son of the James Camak who built the house] death, that the first deed relating to the Camak house lot was recorded. At that time his sons, Louis and James Wellborn Camak, executed a quitclaim deed to their mother, Mary Wellborn Camak, acknowledging that the lot has been given to her by their father without a deed being made.&quot;<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a>{{#tag:ref|A <a href="quitclaim_deed" title="wikilink">quitclaim </a> is a legal instrument by which the owner of a property terminates (quits) his right and claim to the property, thereby allowing his claim to transfer to another.|group=nb}} In 1949, the house was purchased to serve as the Mount Vernon Lodge No. 22, F. &amp; A. M (Masonic lodge); then in 1979 by the Athens Coca-Cola Bottling Company.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="restoration-and-current-use">Restoration and current use</h2>
<p>Albert Sams was president of the Athens Coca-Cola Bottling Company when it acquired Camak House.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> He &quot;was an active member of the Athens-Clarke Heritage Foundation and a generous philanthropist, particularly with regard to historic houses&quot;, and he planned to renovate Camak House for administrative offices; corporate mergers (ultimately with <a href="Coca-Cola_Enterprises" title="wikilink">Coca-Cola Enterprises</a>) in the 1980s ended those plans.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> However, it was the Sams family that sought Camak House's listing on the <a href="National_Register_of_Historic_Places" title="wikilink">National Register of Historic Places</a>.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a></p>
<p>The house and grounds had fallen into decay by 1993, when the <a href="Georgia_Trust_for_Historic_Preservation" title="wikilink">Georgia Trust for Historic Preservation</a> and the law firm of Winburn, Lewis and Barrow formed a partnership to purchase Camak House from Coca-Cola Enterprises.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> The trust added protective <a href="Covenant_(law)" title="wikilink">covenants</a> before selling the property on to the law firm, one of whose partners was <a href="John_Barrow_(U.S._politician)" title="wikilink">John Barrow</a>, who served as the &quot;prime mover in these negotiations&quot;.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> A local company, S&amp;W Development Corp, whose owner, Smith Wilson had been working in historic preservation for 18 years, was contracted to carry out the restoration work.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> The original floor plans, which had been altered during the Masons' tenure, were reinstated;<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> Wilson was able to use drawings made of Camak House during the 1930s as part of the <a href="Works_Progress_Administration" title="wikilink">Works Progress Administration</a>'s documentation of historic buildings.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a></p>
<p>The house's restoration for use as law offices has been described by Elizabeth Dalton of the Athens-Clarke Heritage Foundation as &quot;an excellent example of adaptive use&quot;.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> As of 2011, Camak House is owned by the law firm of Lewis, Frierson and Grayson, LLP.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a></p>
