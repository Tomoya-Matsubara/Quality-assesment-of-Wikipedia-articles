<p>During the 20th century, Japan was heavily involved in commercial whaling. This continued until the <a href="International_Whaling_Commission" title="wikilink">International Whaling Commission</a> (IWC) moratorium on commercial whaling went into effect in 1986. Japan continued to hunt whales using the scientific research provision in the agreement, and Japanese whaling is currently conducted by the <a href="Institute_of_Cetacean_Research" title="wikilink">Institute of Cetacean Research</a>. This is allowed under IWC rules, although most IWC members oppose it.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> The <a href="whale_meat" title="wikilink">whale meat</a> from these scientific whale hunts is sold in shops and restaurants.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> The <a href="International_Court_of_Justice" title="wikilink">International Court of Justice</a> has ruled that the Japanese whaling program in the <a href="Southern_Ocean" title="wikilink">Southern Ocean</a> begun in 2005, JARPA II, was not for scientific purposes and has ordered that Japanese whaling under JARPA II cease.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>These hunts are a source of conflict between pro- and <a href="anti-whaling" class="uri" title="wikilink">anti-whaling</a> countries and organizations. Nations, scientists and environmental organizations opposed to whaling consider the Japanese research program to be unnecessary, and that it is a thinly disguised commercial whaling operation.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a><a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a><a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a><a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<p>Japan maintains that annual whaling is sustainable and necessary for scientific study and management of whale stocks. Japan also argues that objections to whaling are based upon cultural differences and emotional <a href="anthropomorphism" class="uri" title="wikilink">anthropomorphism</a>.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a><a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="history">History</h2>

<p>Archeological evidence in the form of whale remains discovered in burial mounds suggests that whales have been consumed in Japan since the <a href="J&lt;U+014D&gt;mon_period" title="wikilink">J&lt;U+014D&gt;mon period</a> (12,000 BC). Without the means to engage in active whaling, consumption at that time primarily stemmed from stranded whales.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> Surviving <a href="Ainu_people" title="wikilink">Ainu</a> folklore reveals a long history of whaling<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> and a spiritual association with whales.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> The earliest records of hand thrown harpoons date back to the 12th century.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>

<h3 id="organized-whaling">Organized whaling</h3>
<p>Organized open-boat shore whaling began in the 1570s; and continued into the early 20th century.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> Techniques were developed in the 17th century in <a href="Taiji,_Wakayama" title="wikilink">Taiji, Wakayama</a>. Wada Chubei Yorimoto established a <a href="fishery" class="uri" title="wikilink">fishery</a> by organizing the group hunting system in 1606. Whalers would spot whales from stations along the shore and launch boats to catch them with harpoons and lances. His grandson, Wada Kakuemon Yoriharu, later known as Taiji Kakuemon Yoriharu, invented the whaling net technique called Amitori-shiki (&lt;U+7DB2&gt;&lt;U+53D6&gt;&lt;U+308A&gt;&lt;U+5F0F&gt;).<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a><a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a><a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a></p>

<p><a href="Right_whale" title="wikilink">Right whales</a>, <a href="humpback_whale" title="wikilink">humpback whales</a>, <a href="Gray_whale" title="wikilink">gray</a>, and <a href="fin_whale" title="wikilink">fin whales</a> were primarily hunted.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> <a href="Blue_whale" title="wikilink">Blue whales</a>, <a href="Sei_whale" title="wikilink">sei</a>, <a href="Bryde&#39;s_whale" title="wikilink">Bryde's</a> and <a href="sperm_whale" title="wikilink">sperm whales</a> were however also taken when possible.</p>
<p>Once ashore, the whale was quickly flensed and divided into its separate parts for various warehouses and further processing. Although the primary use for whales was meat, the entire whale was utilized in a variety of products including lamp oil, soaps, fertilizer, folding fans (<a href="baleen" class="uri" title="wikilink">baleen</a>), and more. This method of whaling required a significant financial investment from rich individuals to compensate for the sizable labor force. However, whaling remained entwined with ritual and unlike their contemporary European counterparts the early Japanese coastal whalers considered whales a valuable resource and did not over-exploit local stocks.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="modernization">Modernization</h3>
<p>Norwegian-style modern whaling, based on the use of power-driven vessels, cannons and exploding harpoons, was introduced in the <a href="Meiji_era" title="wikilink">Meiji era</a> largely through the efforts of <a href="J&lt;U+016B&gt;r&lt;U+014D&gt;_Oka" title="wikilink">J&lt;U+016B&gt;r&lt;U+014D&gt; Oka</a> who is considered the &quot;father of modern Japanese whaling&quot;.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a><a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a><a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> Oka traveled the world gathering information about whaling practices including to Norway for harpoons, cannons and expertise. He also established the first modern whaling company in Japan in 1899, Nihon Enyo Gyogyo K.K. which took its first whale on February 4, 1900 with a Norwegian gunner, Morten Pedersen.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a><a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a></p>
<p>In the early 20th century, Juro Oka dominated the whale meat market in Japan with assistance and instruction from Norwegian whalers and their leased or purchased ships. Another boost was provided by the capture of a Russian whaling fleet and subsequent transfer to Toyo GyoGyo Co. Ltd.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> As Japan's whaling industry expanded into new territory, including Korean waters, ship production and oil processing, Oka's company (renamed Toyo Hogei K.K.) returned significant profits to its investors which led to increased Japanese competition. Oka later became the first president of the Japan Whaling and Fishing Association, established in 1908.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a><a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a></p>

<p>However, at the start of the 20th century local traditions conflicted with modern whaling practices. In 1911 the conflict turned violent in Same Village, Aomori Prefecture. Ocean pollution from the whaling stations, including large quantities of oil and blood runoff, angered the local fishermen and threatened their own fishing grounds. In protest the fishermen burned a Toyo Hogei facility down. The people of the Same region also did not consume whales and considered them sacred.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a></p>
<p><a href="The_League_of_Nations" title="wikilink">The League of Nations</a> raised concerns about the <a href="over-exploitation" class="uri" title="wikilink">over-exploitation</a> of whale stocks and called for conservation measures in 1925. This eventually led to the Geneva Convention for the Regulation of Whaling which was presented in 1931 but did not enter into force until 1934 and was completely ignored by Japan and Germany.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a><a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a><a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="antarctica">Antarctica</h3>
<p><a href="Factory_ship" title="wikilink">Factory ships</a> were not used by Japan until the 1930s. As whale catches diminished in coastal waters, Japan looked to Antarctica. Toyo Hogei K.K. purchased the Norwegian factory ship, <em>Antarctic,</em> renaming it the <em>Tonan Maru</em> in 1934. Refrigerator ships were sent along to freeze and transport the meat back to Japan. By capitalizing on both the meat and oil of whales, the Japanese industry continued to out-compete other whaling nations. Improvements in technology such as the world's first diesel-powered whale catcher, the <em>Seki Maru</em>, also increased the capacity to take whales. In the years building up to World War II, the Germans purchased <a href="whale_oil" title="wikilink">whale oil</a> from Japan and both nations used it in preparation for war.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1937 London, the International Conference on Whaling, which Japan did not attend, led to additional limits on pelagic whaling in order to prevent excessive exploitation (and specifically the extinction of the blue whale) creating the International Agreement for the Regulation of Whaling. Regarding voluntary acceptance of restrictions:</p>

<p>Regardless of efforts to establish limits, in part due to Japan ignoring an 89 day season limit and continuing for 125 days, a record 45,010 whales were taken in a single season. The Protocol to the International Agreement for the Regulation of Whaling, signed in 1938, established additional restrictions on whaling.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> Despite the attendance of Japanese representatives, Japan did not sign the agreement and started hunting for humpback and undersized whales five weeks prior to the defined start of the season.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> By 1939 Germany and Japan accounted for 30% of the world's whale take.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a></p>

<p>During the second world war Japan's whaling was significantly limited to more familiar hunting grounds, such as the Bonin Islands, to provide meat and oil for domestic and military use. Whaling there was halted in March, 1945 when the islands were taken by US forces. By November 1945 the whaling stations received permission to reopen; however, most whaling ships had been commandeered by the Japanese navy, and by the end of the war the factory ships and most of the whale catchers had been sunk.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a><a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a></p>
<p>General <a href="Douglas_MacArthur" title="wikilink">Douglas MacArthur</a> encouraged the surrendered Japan to continue whaling in order to provide a cheap source of meat to starving people (and millions of dollars in oil for the USA and Europe).<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a><a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> The Japanese whaling industry quickly recovered as MacArthur authorized two tankers to be converted into factory ships, the <em><a href="Hashidate_Maru" title="wikilink">Hashidate Maru</a></em> and the <em><a href="Nisshin_Maru#History" title="wikilink">Nisshin Maru</a></em>. Whale catchers once again took blue whales, fins, humpbacks and sperm whales in the Antarctic and elsewhere.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a></p>
<p>The first post-war expedition was overseen by a US naval officer, Lieutenant David McCracken, and observed by Australian Kenneth Coonan. Coonan expressed disapproval of McCracken in his reports of violated regulations and waste dumped over the side when the fleet began killing whales faster than they could be processed. McCracken even briefly joined in whaling with the Japanese crew of a whale catcher and detailed the trip in his 1948 book, <em>Four Months on a Jap Whaler</em>.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a></p>
<p>The post-war recovery established whale meat as a nation-wide food source for the first time. In 1947 whale meat made up over 50 percent of the meat consumed in Japan. The market significantly increased through commercial sale and public distribution. In 1954, the School Lunch Act also included whale meat in compulsory education (elementary and middle school) to improve the nutrition of Japanese children.</p>

<p>Japan would later make heavy use of one particular article of the ICRW despite the condemnation of environmental organizations and anti-whaling nations.</p>

<h3 id="pirate-whaling">Pirate whaling</h3>
<p>As the IWC enacted regulation regarding whaling a number of unregulated operations acting outside of the laws of member nations became notorious in the mid-late 20th century. For example, a large private whaling fleet was owned (through a variety of holding companies and flags of convenience) by shipping magnate <a href="Aristotle_Onassis" title="wikilink">Aristotle Onassis</a> and gained notoriety for ignoring all limits of size and species. When the Peruvian navy finally stopped and seized the Onassis fleet, and just as sanctions were to be applied, the entire fleet was sold to Japan for $8.5 million. Onassis' factory ship, the <em>Olympic Challenger</em>, was renamed the <em>Kyokuyo Maru II</em>.<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a><a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a></p>
<p>The Japanese trawler, <em>Shunyo-maru</em>, later became a combined catcher/factory whaling ship, MV <em>Tonna</em>, and was owned by Andrew M. Behr who also owned the infamous pirate whaling ship, <em>Sierra</em>. The <em>Tonna</em> is famous for its demise. In 1978 with full holds the <em>Tonna</em> landed another 50 ton fin whale. As the whale was being winched aboard for processing the ship listed over, took on water and quickly sank.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a><a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a> Behr and the <em>Sierra</em> were also linked to Japan's Taiyo Fisheries Co. through a Canadian subsidiary (Taiyo Canada Ltd.) and with whale product for Japanese markets. In July, 1979, the <em>Sierra</em> was severely damaged after being rammed by activist <a href="Paul_Watson" title="wikilink">Paul Watson</a> aboard his ship, the <em>Sea Shepherd.</em><a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a> The <em>Sierra</em> was later (February, 1980) sunk in port by unknown saboteurs with <a href="limpet_mine" title="wikilink">limpet mines</a>.<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a> Taiyo and other Japanese fisheries have also been linked to pirate whaling through subsidiary companies in Taiwan, the Philippines, Spain, South Korea, Chile and Peru.<ref name="Ellis 1999 450<U+2013>454&quot;/&gt;<ref name="Darby 2007 120<U+2013>123&quot;/&gt;</p>
<h3 id="consolidation">Consolidation</h3>
<p>As quotas and resources were reduced and restrictions increased, the commercial viability of large competing whaling fleets was also diminished. In order to preserve the industry, six Japanese whaling companies negotiated an agreement through the Japan Fisheries Agency in July 1975. The six companies (Nihon Suisan, Taiyo Gyogyo, Kyokuyo, Nitto Hogei, Nihon Hogei and Hokuyo Hogei) merged to create a new company, Nihon Kyodo Hogei Co., Ltd. on February 15, 1976. Former president of the Japan Fisheries Association and former Director-General of the Japan Fisheries Agency, Iwao Fujita, became the first Managing Director by appointment.<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a></p>
<p>In April, 1976, Shintaro Abe, the Minister of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, declared government support for the newly formed company.</p>

<p>Nihon Kyodo Hogei Co. Ltd was later renamed Kyodo Senpaku Co. Ltd and merged with the Japan Whaling Association and Institute of Cetacean Research to create the modern Institute of Cetacean Research in 1987.<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="moratorium">Moratorium</h3>
<p>In 1972, the United Nations Environmental Conference produced a 52&lt;U+2013&gt;0 vote in favor of a 10 year global moratorium on commercial whaling. However, the UN resolution was not adopted by the IWC by a vote of 6-no, 4-yes and 4-abstain. Japan, Russia, Iceland, Norway, South Africa and Panama voted no.<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1973, a moratorium was once again proposed and voted down in the IWC lacking the required 3/4 majority (8-yes, 5-no, 1-abstain). Japan, Russia, Iceland, Norway and South Africa voted no.<ref name="Day 1987 29<U+2013>32&quot;/&gt; Between 1973 and 1982 the IWC would see its membership increase from 14 nations to 37, perhaps stacking the vote in favor of anti-whaling nations. In 1980 and 1981 two more votes failed to establish a moratorium by a 3/4 majority (13&lt;U+2013&gt;9&lt;U+2013&gt;2 and 16&lt;U+2013&gt;8&lt;U+2013&gt;3).<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1982, the IWC finally voted in favor of a moratorium on commercial whaling to go into force in 1986 (25&lt;U+2013&gt;7&lt;U+2013&gt;5). Japan objected to the moratorium and continued whaling (<em>Under the ICRW an objecting nation is exempted from the disputed regulations. Japan also continued to hunt sperm whales despite a 1981 IWC zero catch quota.</em>). The United States would play a significant role in Japan's acceptance of a global moratorium on commercial whaling due to its domestic laws. In particular the 1971 Pelly Amendment to the US Fishermen's Protection Act gives the US President legal authority to prohibit importation of fish products from any nation that is diminishing the effectiveness of fisheries conservation programs. It was later strengthened by the 1979 Packwood-Magnuson Amendment to the Fishery Conservation and Management Act giving the same sanctioning power with regard to the ICRW.<ref name="Day 1987 29<U+2013>32&quot;/&gt;<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a><a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a></p>
<p>Potential US sanctions jeopardized access for Japanese fisheries to Alaskan waters, with an annual catch of a million <a href="tonne" title="wikilink">tonnes</a> of fish (), worth an estimated $425 million per year. A negotiated settlement was reached, allowing Japan to continue commercial whaling without the threat of US sanctions until 1988, with an agreement to drop Japan's objection to the moratorium in 1985. However, conservation groups sued the United States Secretary of Commerce, claiming that the law did not allow any deals. That claim was defeated by a US Supreme Court decision in 1986, and, as agreed, Japan withdrew its objection to the moratorium and ceased commercial whaling by 1988. Japan's access to Alaskan waters was later phased out anyway, due in part to pressure from US fishermen and conservationists, and also in response to Japan's subsequent use of research whaling.<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a><a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a><a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="research-whaling">Research whaling</h3>
<p>In 1976, the quota for Southern Hemisphere <a href="Bryde&#39;s_whale" title="wikilink">Bryde's whales</a> was set to zero by the IWC. However, Japan proceeded to take 225 of them during the 76&lt;U+2013&gt;77 season by issuing itself a permit to take whales for scientific research under Article VIII of the ICRW. Following this event, the IWC recommended all future applications of Article VIII be reviewed by the IWC scientific committee.<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1986, Japan introduced a similar proposal and later issued itself a scientific permit to take 825 <a href="minke" class="uri" title="wikilink">minke</a> whales and 50 <a href="sperm_whale" title="wikilink">sperm whales</a> every year for ten years. Despite the fact that the IWC scientific committee rejected its research proposals, Japan continued whaling.</p>
<p>The IWC adopted a resolution in 1987 recommending Japan not proceed until disagreements over its research proposals were resolved. A second resolution was also adopted on February 14, 1988 recommending Japan not proceed. On February 9, 1988 Japanese whalers killed the first minke whale in Antarctic waters under the new self issued research whaling permit. U.S. President <a href="Ronald_Reagan" title="wikilink">Ronald Reagan</a> responded by cutting off Japanese fishing privileges in U.S. waters on April 6, 1988 under the Packwood-Magnuson Amendment.<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a><a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a></p>

<p>Japan has since conducted research whaling programs in the North Pacific (JARPN 1994&lt;U+2013&gt;1999, JARPN II 2000 &lt;U+2013&gt; present) and in Antarctica (JARPA 1988&lt;U+2013&gt;2005, JARPA II 2005 &lt;U+2013&gt; present). The IWC has asked its members that conduct research whaling programs to demonstrate that the research provides critical information, that the research is needed for whale management purposes, and that non-lethal research techniques are not able to provide the same information. The IWC has issued at least 19 resolutions criticizing Japan for failing to meet these conditions and asking it to stop issuing permits.<a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a></p>
<p>The current JARPA II permit has been &quot;for 850&lt;U+00B1&gt;10% Antarctic minke whales, 50 fin whales and 50 humpback whales annually. To date, Japan has refrained from taking humpback whales.&quot;<a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="normalization">Normalization</h3>
<p>In 1994, at its 46th annual meeting, the IWC established the <a href="Southern_Ocean_Whale_Sanctuary" title="wikilink">Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary</a> in a 23&lt;U+2013&gt;1&lt;U+2013&gt;8 vote. Commercial whaling is prohibited within the sanctuary boundaries. Only Japan voted in opposition.<a href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a><a href="#fn67" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a></p>
<p>As the size of the IWC continued to grow, so did the influence of Japan within the commission. For example, many new Caribbean member nations voted in favor of whaling interests in 2000 including the defeat of a proposed <a href="South_Pacific_Whale_Sanctuary" title="wikilink">South Pacific Whale Sanctuary</a>. Additional support for whaling was gained in the Pacific, Africa and South-East Asia. As many of these nations received economic aid from Japan, accusations of vote buying were made by anti-whaling groups. In 2001, Japanese fisheries official Masayuki Komatsu stated Japan used overseas development aid as a tool to gain influence.<a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a><a href="#fn69" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref69"><sup>69</sup></a><a href="#fn70" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a><a href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a></p>
<p>In 2006, the pro-whaling bloc won a symbolic victory in a non-binding resolution implying the moratorium on commercial whaling was both temporary and unnecessary (33&lt;U+2013&gt;32&lt;U+2013&gt;1).<a href="#fn72" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref72"><sup>72</sup></a></p>
<p>Japan followed with a proposal to 'normalize' the IWC. In the proposal, Japan's representatives claimed the IWC had become dysfunctional in favor of the total elimination of whaling. It also suggested reforms such as the use of secret ballots and increased recognition of cultural differences in the IWC. A Conference for the Normalization of the International Whaling Commission was hosted by Japan in 2007.<a href="#fn73" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref73"><sup>73</sup></a><a href="#fn74" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref74"><sup>74</sup></a><a href="#fn75" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref75"><sup>75</sup></a></p>
<p>After over 50 years of control, Japan's center-right conservative party, Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), lost in 2009 elections to the opposing left, Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ). Environmental organizations had hoped the change in government would bring about an end to Japanese whaling. However, in 2009 the Foreign Minister of Japan, Katsuya Okada, explained that whaling would continue to receive support as a matter of policy.<a href="#fn76" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref76"><sup>76</sup></a><a href="#fn77" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref77"><sup>77</sup></a></p>
<p>A 2010 undercover investigation by reporters from the UK's Sunday Times revealed the officials of many developing countries accepted financial compensation from Japan for support in the IWC. Separate from millions in overseas development aid, membership fees, paid flights, hotel stays and spending money was all provided, by Japan, to gain the support of IWC delegates. In some cases cash was presented in envelopes by Japanese officials.<a href="#fn78" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref78"><sup>78</sup></a> Despite recordings from the investigation, officials implicated in the report have denied accepting bribes in exchange for votes.<a href="#fn79" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref79"><sup>79</sup></a></p>
<p>Japan ended its 2010&lt;U+2013&gt;2011 Antarctic hunt early, citing harassment by conservationists.<a href="#fn80" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref80"><sup>80</sup></a> However, it was later announced in October, 2011 that the 2011&lt;U+2013&gt;2012 whale hunt would go on as planned. An <a href="Associated_Press" title="wikilink">Associated Press</a> poll of the Japanese public conducted in July and August 2011 found that 52% of Japanese supported whale hunting, 35% were neutral, and 13% were opposed.<a href="#fn81" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref81"><sup>81</sup></a></p>
<p>In 2011, at the 63rd meeting of the IWC, Japan demonstrated the progress of its 'normalization' policy. When South American countries proposed a vote to establish a new whale sanctuary in the South Atlantic Ocean, Japanese delegates led Iceland, several Caribbean countries, and additional representatives in a walkout. As a result, the vote was postponed for one year along with other matters pending consideration by the commission.<a href="#fn82" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref82"><sup>82</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="production">Production</h2>
<p>Japanese whaling is conducted in both <a href="pelagic_zone" title="wikilink">pelagic</a> (open-ocean) areas in the North Pacific Ocean and the Southern Ocean near Antarctica. Coastal waters are also utilized for small-type coastal whaling of dolphins and other small cetaceans. Large and small whales are sometimes taken as <a href="bycatch" class="uri" title="wikilink">bycatch</a> in the nets of Japanese fishing vessels as well.</p>
<h3 id="pelagic-whaling">Pelagic whaling</h3>
<p><img src="Whale_meat_on_sale_at_a_Tokyo_fish_market_in_2008.jpg" title="fig:Whale meat on sale at Tsukiji fish market in Tokyo, Japan" alt="Whale meat on sale at Tsukiji fish market in Tokyo, Japan" /> <img src="Kujira(WhaleMeat)-Takashimaya-20101013.jpg" title="fig:Various cuts of whale meat for sale." alt="Various cuts of whale meat for sale." /> Japan's pelagic whaling fleet, which annually hunts large whales in the <a href="Southern_Ocean" title="wikilink">Southern Ocean</a>, consists of a number of ships for hunting and processing whale catch as well as securing the hunt against protests. During the 2009&lt;U+2013&gt;10 season, the Japanese fleet included a <a href="factory_ship" title="wikilink">factory ship</a>, four whale catchers and two security patrol vessels. The Japanese self-imposed quota includes 935 minke, 50 fin and 50 humpback whales per season.<a href="#fn83" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref83"><sup>83</sup></a></p>
<p>When whales are spotted the whale catchers will engage in pursuit. A harpoon cannon with a grenade tipped harpoon is fired at the target whale. A rope is trailed from the harpoon in order to prevent the whale from being lost. If the whale is struck and not killed instantly by the explosive tipped harpoon, a second harpoon may be used or the whale may be shot with a rifle until dead. A past method of using a second harpoon to electrocute whales is now forbidden by the IWC. Environmental groups have reported whales being dragged backward and drowned.<a href="#fn84" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref84"><sup>84</sup></a></p>
<p>Each caught whale is secured to the side of a whale catcher with rope. Lines are later used to transfer the whales from the whale catcher to the factory ship. Whales are next winched onto the factory ship through a slipway at the stern of the vessel. On the flensing deck several workers use specialized tools to butcher the whale. Usable product is delivered to the lower decks of the ship for further processing and refrigerated storage. Non usable product is dumped back into the ocean.</p>
<p>Additional regulations from the <a href="United_Nations_International_Maritime_Organization" title="wikilink">United Nations International Maritime Organization</a> took effect on August 1, 2011 prohibiting ships using heavy oil from navigation in the <a href="Antarctic_Treaty_System" title="wikilink">Antarctic Treaty System</a> area to prevent pollution. The IMO <em>Guidelines For Ships Operating In Ice-Covered Waters</em> also establishes requirements for a double-hull strengthened against ice-related damage. The Japanese factory ship <em><a href="Nisshin_Maru" title="wikilink">Nisshin Maru</a></em> does not currently meet these IMO standards.<a href="#fn85" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref85"><sup>85</sup></a><a href="#fn86" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref86"><sup>86</sup></a><a href="#fn87" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref87"><sup>87</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="small-type-coastal-whaling">Small type coastal whaling</h3>

<p>Coastal fishing fleets that hunt dolphins use many small boats in a coordinated effort. The fishermen bang metal poles in the water in order to frighten and therefore guide noise-sensitive dolphins toward the shore. A series of nets are then used to corral the dolphins in. Divers and fishermen in boats next lance or cut the throats of the dolphins and haul them away to a nearby shore station for processing. A few dolphins are selected for sale to aquariums and spared for the marine park entertainment industry.</p>
<p>The practice of dolphin drive hunting in <a href="Taiji,_Wakayama" title="wikilink">Taiji</a>, Japan was recently the subject of a documentary film entitled <em><a href="The_Cove_(film)" title="wikilink">The Cove</a></em>. <a href="#fn88" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref88"><sup>88</sup></a></p>
<p>Japanese whalers have hunted Baird's beaked whales on the Boso Peninsula, Wada, since the 17th century. Once landed just off the coast of Japan, the beaked whales are pulled onto a landing station with ropes and then butchered for sale. The meat is sold as food and the rest is used for fertilizer.</p>
<p>In May 2007 the IWC rejected a proposal to expand coastal catches. The quota was limited to a total of 66 whales between four whaling towns. The whalers of Wada encourage local children to attend the first butchering of each season followed by a community event where whale meat is served.<a href="#fn89" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref89"><sup>89</sup></a></p>
<p>According to the Japan Fisheries Agency up to 20,000 dolphins of several species will be taken, in many locations along the coast of Japan, over the course of a six-month season.<a href="#fn90" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref90"><sup>90</sup></a> Coastal whaling communities suffered significant damage as a result of the earthquake and tsunami disaster in March, 2011.<a href="#fn91" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref91"><sup>91</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="bycatch">Bycatch</h3>
<p>In 2009, published DNA analysis of whale meat from Japanese markets suggested as many as 150 large whales from vulnerable coastal stocks were taken annually as bycatch. Japan legally allows the commercial sale of whales caught incidentally, entangled in fishing nets designed to catch coastal fish. Market surveys also detected migratory whales such as the endangered Humpback<a href="#fn92" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref92"><sup>92</sup></a><a href="#fn93" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref93"><sup>93</sup></a> and endangered Gray whales,<a href="#fn94" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref94"><sup>94</sup></a><a href="#fn95" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref95"><sup>95</sup></a> as well as the threatened Finback whale,<a href="#fn96" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref96"><sup>96</sup></a><a href="#fn97" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref97"><sup>97</sup></a> and the non-endangered Bryde's whales.<a href="#fn98" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref98"><sup>98</sup></a></p>
<p>The impact on J-stock whales, which have protected status under the IWC, seemingly increased with changes in Japanese regulations that legalized the sale of bycatch in 2001. Between 1997 and 2000 only 19&lt;U+2013&gt;29 whales were annually reported caught as bycatch. The number increased to 89 &lt;U+2013&gt; 137 annually between 2001 and 2004. However, the study concluded from genetic information that the actual amount of bycatch was similarly high prior to the 2001 regulations but was under-reported. Up to 46% of the samples tested proved to be J-stock.<a href="#fn99" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref99"><sup>99</sup></a></p>
<p>Prior to the 2001 change in regulations, fishermen could not legally sell minke whales to commercial firms and were supposed to sell them locally or destroy them and report the incident. The high percentage of J-stock bycatch presents a significant threat including the possibility of extinction within a few decades according to IWC population estimates.<a href="#fn100" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref100"><sup>100</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="imports">Imports</h3>
<p>In 2009 Japan accepted imports of <a href="whale_meat" title="wikilink">whale meat</a> from Norway and Iceland for the first time in over a decade. The Norwegian shipment arrived in mid-2008 but was held by Japanese customs until January 2009 when the Japan Fisheries Agency finally approved the import.</p>
<p>The international trade of whale meat is prohibited by <a href="CITES" class="uri" title="wikilink">CITES</a> (Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species). However, Japan, Norway and Iceland registered reservations with the treaty in order to remain exempt. The Norwegian company, Myklebust Trading, exports common minke whale and Iceland's Hvalur hf exports Fin whale, which is an endangered species. Environmental organizations criticized the trade and expressed doubts that Japanese markets could absorb the increase in supply as thousands of tonnes of whale meat remained in cold storage in Japan.<a href="#fn101" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref101"><sup>101</sup></a><a href="#fn102" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref102"><sup>102</sup></a> In 2010, Iceland's proposed quota in killing fin whales was much larger than the amount of whale meat the Japanese market could absorb. In negotiations with <a href="Marc_Wall" title="wikilink">Marc Wall</a>, Economic Minister-Counselor at the US embassy in Tokyo, <a href="Jun_Yamashita" title="wikilink">Jun Yamashita</a> of the Japanese Fisheries Agencies, however, rejected a 2010 proposal to suggest to Iceland to reduce the number of killed fin whales to a more reasonable number.<a href="#fn103" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref103"><sup>103</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="scientific-research">Scientific research</h2>

<p>After halting its commercial whaling, Japan began scientific research hunts to provide a basis for the resumption of sustainable whaling.<a href="#fn104" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref104"><sup>104</sup></a><a href="#fn105" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref105"><sup>105</sup></a> According to environmental groups and the Australian Environment Minister, the ostensible research serves to disguise commercial whaling in circumvention of the IWC moratorium.<a href="#fn106" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref106"><sup>106</sup></a><a href="#fn107" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref107"><sup>107</sup></a> The IWC Scientific Committee collects up-to-date data on catch limits and catches taken since 1985.

<h3 id="jarpa">JARPA</h3>
<p>The research program took place near Antarctica from 1988 to 2005. Its stated objectives were to determine mortality rates, whale stock numbers and structure, the role of whales in the Antarctic ecosystem and how environmental changes affect whales. The whaling operation alternated between several pre-established areas intending to take 400 or more minke whales per season.</p>
<p>In 1997 the IWC scientific committee officially reviewed the JARPA program. The committee expected reasonable precision and usefulness of the data collected but disagreed on whether lethal methods were necessary. It was also noted that the results could potentially allow for an increase in the number of minke whales annually taken.<a href="#fn117" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref117"><sup>117</sup></a></p>
<p>In the final 2007 review the committee agreed with the initial 1997 mid assessment. It recognized that progress had been made in identifying stock structure and at least two stocks were found in the research area. Agreed estimates of abundance could not be developed and preliminary estimates may only reflect major changes in abundance over a long time line. Problems were identified with age and mortality rate data. Krill-related work was welcomed but relatively little progress was made toward understanding the role of whales in the Antarctic ecosystem. Data on pollution was also welcomed but disagreement continued over the interpretation of the results. Levels of toxic pollutants were lower in Antarctic whales than those sampled in the Northern hemisphere.<a href="#fn118" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref118"><sup>118</sup></a><a href="#fn119" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref119"><sup>119</sup></a></p>
<p>The commission made note of the fact that the catches took place in the IWC established Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary and that improving management of whaling in a sanctuary is unnecessary. The 2007-1 resolution on JARPA is one of several calling on Japan by majority vote to suspend its lethal research.<a href="#fn120" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref120"><sup>120</sup></a><a href="#fn121" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref121"><sup>121</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="jarpa-ii">JARPA II</h3>
<p>Like its predecessor, the research whaling program takes place near Antarctica. Starting in 2005 and continuing to the present day, objectives include monitoring the Antarctic ecosystem, modeling competition between whale species, recording changes in stock structure and improving future management of Antarctic whales. The program calls for 950 minke whales, 50 fin whales and 50 humpback whales per season.<a href="#fn122" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref122"><sup>122</sup></a></p>
<p>Disagreement over the value of the research, the use of lethal methods and the sample sizes continued in both the scientific committee and the commission. In 2005 and 2007 the commission passed resolutions by majority urging Japan to stop all lethal research in JARPA II.<a href="#fn123" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref123"><sup>123</sup></a><a href="#fn124" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref124"><sup>124</sup></a></p>
<p>On March 31, 2014 the <a href="International_Court_of_Justice" title="wikilink">International Court of Justice</a> (ICJ) ruled that JARPA II was not for scientific purposes and forbade the granting of further permits.<a href="#fn125" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref125"><sup>125</sup></a> Following the ruling, Japan cancelled its Antarctic whaling hunt for the first time in more than 25 years, though it announced plans to propose a new research program designed to meet the standards set by the ICJ the following year.<a href="#fn126" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref126"><sup>126</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="jarpn">JARPN</h3>
<p>From 1994 to 1999 Japan carried out its research program JARPN in the western North Pacific. Its stated goals were to improve knowledge of stock identity, improve Implementation Simulation Trials for North Pacific Common minke whales and act as a feasibility study for a program on feeding ecology. The program called for 100 minke whales annually. The results were reviewed by committee in February, 2000. The committee agreed that the information was useful for management but no consensus was reached on whether lethal methods of research were necessary.<a href="#fn127" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref127"><sup>127</sup></a></p>
<p>As with JARPA, the IWC issued resolutions calling for Japan to cease issuing permits for the take of minke whales citing concerns over the need for lethal methods such as the 1999-3 Resolution on whaling under Special Permit.<a href="#fn128" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref128"><sup>128</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="jarpn-ii">JARPN II</h3>
<p>JARPN II began with a feasibility study from 2000 to 2001 to continue taking whales in the western North Pacific Ocean including 100 common minke whales, 50 Bryde's whales and 10 sperm whales. The objectives of the program included study of feeding ecology (such as prey consumption), stock structure and the environmental impacts of cetaceans. In 2002 after the completion of the initial study Japan proposed and began a long-term program to study how feeding ecology relates to sustainable use in the Pacific and within Japan's Exclusive Economic Zone. In 2008 the program included a proposal for an annual take of 340 minke whales, 50 Bryde's whales, 100 sei and 10 sperm whales.<a href="#fn129" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref129"><sup>129</sup></a></p>
<p>Disagreement over the objectives, methodology, effect on stocks and overall success of the program continued in the scientific committee review of the feasibility study and full program. The full program introduced a change from previous use of the ICRW Article VIII research provision by not specifying an end date. The objectives were deemed unnecessary for stock management by some members and would not contribute significantly to previously identified research needs. The sample size and methods proposed were unlikely to satisfy program objectives and the ecosystem modeling was considered to be poorly developed.<a href="#fn130" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref130"><sup>130</sup></a></p>
<p>Some contended the program placed undue emphasis on assumed negative effects of cetacean predation on fishery resources while failing to address the effects of fisheries on cetaceans. However, others believed determining the effects of cetaceans on fish stocks and more information on minke stock structure to be critically important. Some stated the feasibility study would provide valuable information on methodology and other aspects of the program would improve over time and contribute to fundamental questions. The committee identified that the pollution objective did not contribute to the goals of the IWC Pollution 2000+ project but remained relevant to the IWC for long term study.<a href="#fn131" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref131"><sup>131</sup></a></p>
<p>Disagreement over the value of data obtained through lethal methods continued as well. Some argued that a wide range of questions could be answered through non-lethal means such as &quot;for pollutant monitoring (biopsy sampling for fatty acid and stable isotope analysis), for stock structure (photo identification, biopsy sampling and faecal sampling), and for feeding ecology (faecal sampling).&quot;<a href="#fn132" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref132"><sup>132</sup></a> Others argued that prey data was required for modeling purposes that could not be acquired through non-lethal means. However, feeding ecology was not necessarily relevant to stock management according to some who argued biopsy sampling would allow for a greater amount of statistical data.<a href="#fn133" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref133"><sup>133</sup></a></p>
<p>Argument continued over the potential negative effects of catches, such as stock depletion of O-stock and J-stock whales, when the only data on many of the populations came from selective extrapolations of JSV (survey) data. Proponents contended that the JSV data was reliable and the research area extended from coastal areas to offshore areas thus limiting pressure on coastal stocks.<a href="#fn134" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref134"><sup>134</sup></a></p>
<p>In 2000, 2001 and 2003 more resolutions were passed by the IWC urging Japan to cease issuing special permits for whaling and limit research to non-lethal methods.<a href="#fn135" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref135"><sup>135</sup></a><a href="#fn136" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref136"><sup>136</sup></a> The most recent Scientific Committee review was conducted in January, 2009.<a href="#fn137" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref137"><sup>137</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="publications">Publications</h3>
<p>Over 120 publications have resulted from the lethal and non-lethal research conducted during the JARPA programs.<a href="#fn138" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref138"><sup>138</sup></a> Many of these articles are published in international peer-reviewed scientific journals, and some have both Japanese and non-Japanese scientists as co-authors.

Norway and Iceland are also whalers, but the criticism of Japan is stronger.&quot;<a href="#fn165" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref165"><sup>165</sup></a> However, critics have forcibly attacked the &quot;cultural&quot; defense, with for example <a href="Sea_Shepherd_Conservation_Society" title="wikilink">Sea Shepherd Conservation Society</a> representatives comparing it to forced <a href="female_genital_cutting" title="wikilink">female genital cutting</a> in Sudan, saying that although it is a practice that may have cultural roots, it still should be opposed out of necessity.<a href="#fn166" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref166"><sup>166</sup></a> A professor of environmental studies in Japan wrote in his book that Japan's modern commercial whaling bears little resemblance to the small-scale subsistence whaling that, until the dawn of the 20th century, was limited to certain coastal regions, and Japan's whale-eating culture was also very limited in scope and an invented tradition, only lasting 20 years from the end of World War II to the early 1960s to augment Japanese school lunch programs during the U.S. occupation.<a href="#fn167" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref167"><sup>167</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="debate-in-the-iwc">Debate in the IWC</h3>

<p>The most vocal opponents of the Japanese push for a resumption of commercial whaling are Australia, New Zealand and the United Kingdom. The Australian government's stated purpose for opposing whaling is the need for conservation of endangered species; however, Japan's quota of 935 <a href="Minke_whale" title="wikilink">Minke whales</a> (which are not endangered) each year only results in a loss 0.19% of the Minke Whale's population which is more than 515,000.<a href="#fn168" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref168"><sup>168</sup></a><a href="#fn169" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref169"><sup>169</sup></a><a href="#fn170" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref170"><sup>170</sup></a> The New Zealand government is opposed to hunting whales for food or research<a href="#fn171" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref171"><sup>171</sup></a> and the UK government believes &quot;that whaling does not serve any genuine need and involves unacceptable cruelty.&quot;<a href="#fn172" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref172"><sup>172</sup></a></p>
<p>In July 2004 it was reported that a working group of the Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic had drawn up plans to leave the IWC in order to join a new pro-whaling organization, <a href="NAMMCO" class="uri" title="wikilink">NAMMCO</a>, because of the IWC's refusal to back the principle of sustainable commercial whaling.<a href="#fn173" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref173"><sup>173</sup></a> Japan is particularly opposed to the IWC Conservation Committee, introduced in 2003, which it says exists solely to prevent any whaling. Any directives from the IWC are undertaken on a purely voluntary basis as state sovereignty means that there are few avenues by which international law can be enforced.</p>
<p>At an <a href="International_Whaling_Commission" title="wikilink">International Whaling Commission</a> (IWC) meeting in 2006, a resolution calling for the eventual return of commercial whaling was passed by a majority of just one vote.

<p>In December 2011, The Japanese government confirmed that US$29 million out of their supplementary post-earthquake and tsunami reconstruction budget was spent to provide extra security to ensure the &quot;stable operation&quot; of the Japanese whaling fleet.<a href="#fn220" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref220"><sup>220</sup></a><a href="#fn221" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref221"><sup>221</sup></a></p>

<p>Japan has continued to face accusations of <a href="Vote-rigging" title="wikilink">vote-buying</a> within the IWC, as an increasing number of developing countries with little or no tradition of whaling join. On March 8, 2008, <a href="Solomon_Islands" title="wikilink">Solomon Islands</a>' Prime Minister <a href="Derek_Sikua" title="wikilink">Derek Sikua</a> said that Japan had offered to pay for his country's delegates to attend the March 6, 2008 IWC meeting in London, and that he had refused the offer.

<p>Due to its low food self-sufficiency rate, around 40%, Japan relies on stockpiling to secure a stable food supply.<a href="#fn226" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref226"><sup>226</sup></a> As of 2009, Japan's 1.2 million ton seafood stockpile included nearly 5000 tons of whale meat.<a href="#fn227" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref227"><sup>227</sup></a> Japan has started to serve whale meat in school lunches as part of a government initiative to reduce the amounts.<a href="#fn228" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref228"><sup>228</sup></a> However, there has been criticism of serving whale meat to school children due to allegations of toxic <a href="methylmercury" class="uri" title="wikilink">methylmercury</a> levels.<a href="#fn229" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref229"><sup>229</sup></a> The <a href="World_Wildlife_Fund" title="wikilink">World Wildlife Fund</a> has also estimated that the Japanese government has had to invest $12 million into the 2008&lt;U+2013&gt;09 Antarctic whale hunt alone just to break even, and that subsidies in total have amounted to approximately $150 million since 1988.<a href="#fn230" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref230"><sup>230</sup></a></p>
<p>One study found levels of <a href="Mercury_(element)" title="wikilink">mercury</a> in whale red meat at 6 times the limit set by the US FDA for food. Whale meat can also be contaminated with <a href="polychlorinated_biphenyl" title="wikilink">polychlorinated biphenyls</a>. Critics claim that, because of contamination, it constitutes a health risk.

<h2 id="iwc-meeting">2010 IWC meeting</h2>
<p>At the 2010 meeting of the International Whaling Commission in Morocco, representatives of the 88 member nations discussed whether or not to lift the 24 year ban on commercial whaling. Japan, Norway and Iceland have urged the organization to lift the ban. A coalition of anti-whaling nations has offered a compromise plan that would allow these countries to continue whaling, but with smaller catches and under close supervision. Their plan would also completely ban whaling in the Southern Ocean.<a href="#fn235" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref235"><sup>235</sup></a> More than 200 scientists and experts have opposed the compromise proposal for lifting the ban, and have also opposed allowing whaling in the Southern Ocean, which was declared a whale sanctuary in 1994.<a href="#fn236" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref236"><sup>236</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="media-attention">Media attention</h2>
<p>Western media attention regarding Japan's whaling industry has increased. <a href="Animal_Planet" title="wikilink">Animal Planet</a>'s television series, <em><a href="Whale_Wars" title="wikilink">Whale Wars</a></em>, places a camera crew on board the <a href="Sea_Shepherd_Conservation_Society" title="wikilink">Sea Shepherd Conservation Society</a> anti-whaling activist ships to document the annual interference with Japan's Antarctic whaling program. Japan has denounced the program as deceptive and supportive of eco-terrorists to increase ratings.<a href="#fn237" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref237"><sup>237</sup></a> Animal Planet has made requests to also film from the perspective of Japan's whaling fleet but the requests were denied.<a href="#fn238" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref238"><sup>238</sup></a></p>
<p>The animated series <em><a href="South_Park" title="wikilink">South Park</a></em> lampooned both Japan's whaling traditions and the anti-whaling activists featured on <em>Whale Wars</em> in the episode &quot;<a href="Whale_Whores" title="wikilink">Whale Whores</a>&quot;.</p>
<p>A 2009 <a href="Academy_Award" title="wikilink">Oscar</a> winning documentary, <em><a href="The_Cove_(film)" title="wikilink">The Cove</a></em>, focused entirely on Japan's dolphin drive fisheries, mercury content of dolphin meat and the whaling town, Taiji. The film also concentrated on the difficulty in observing Taiji fishermen at work due to obstruction from the local police.<a href="#fn239" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref239"><sup>239</sup></a></p>
