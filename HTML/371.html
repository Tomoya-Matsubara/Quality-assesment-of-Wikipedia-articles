<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<p><img src="Photo_-_Andrew_Evans.JPG" title="fig:Andrew Evans" alt="Andrew Evans" width="150" /> The party was founded in <a href="South_Australia" title="wikilink">South Australia</a> in time to contest the <a href="South_Australian_state_election,_2002" title="wikilink">2002 state elections</a>, when former <a href="Assemblies_of_God" title="wikilink">Assemblies of God</a> pastor <a href="Andrew_Evans_(pastor)" title="wikilink">Dr Andrew Evans</a> became its first <a href="Member_of_the_Legislative_Council" title="wikilink">Member of the Legislative Council</a> (MLC), winning a seat in the <a href="South_Australian_Legislative_Council" title="wikilink">South Australian Legislative Council</a>. A second MLC, pharmaceutical executive <a href="Dennis_Hood" title="wikilink">Dennis Hood</a>, was elected at the <a href="South_Australian_state_election,_2006" title="wikilink">2006 state election</a>.</p>
<p>In the October <a href="Australian_federal_election,_2004" title="wikilink">2004 federal election</a> it contested seats all over Australia, generally exchanging <a href="preferential_voting" title="wikilink">preferences</a> with <a href="Liberal_Party_of_Australia" title="wikilink">Liberal</a> candidates (but in some seats exchanging preferences with the <a href="Australian_Labor_Party" title="wikilink">Australian Labor Party</a>). At that election the party was successful in electing their first and only federal politician <a href="Steve_Fielding" title="wikilink">Steve Fielding</a>, Senator for <a href="Victoria,_Australia" title="wikilink">Victoria</a>. He shares the <a href="Balance_of_power_(parliament)" title="wikilink">balance of power</a> in the Senate with independent <a href="Nick_Xenophon" title="wikilink">Nick Xenophon</a> and the five <a href="Australian_Greens" title="wikilink">Australian Greens</a> in the July 2008 to July 2011 Senate.</p>
<p>The <a href="Western_Australia" title="wikilink">Western Australian</a> branch of the party, officially named the WAFamilyFirst.com Party, was launched in June 2008. It began when sitting MP and former <a href="Liberal_Party_of_Australia" title="wikilink">Liberal Party</a> member <a href="Dan_Sullivan_(politician)" title="wikilink">Dan Sullivan</a> joined as an executive member of the Western Australian State Branch of Family First, giving it official status as a Parliamentary Party. When three former <a href="One_Nation_(Australia)" title="wikilink">One Nation</a> <a href="Member_of_Parliament" title="wikilink">MPs</a>, attended the public launch it fuelled media speculation that they may try and influence the new party.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a><a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>In recent years the party has grown with support on social networking sites such as <a href="Facebook" class="uri" title="wikilink">Facebook</a> and <a href="Twitter" class="uri" title="wikilink">Twitter</a>, gaining members through online advertising along with supporters and followers on <a href="Twitter" class="uri" title="wikilink">Twitter</a>.</p>
<p>Although officially eschewing religious labels, many of its candidates and members are from <a href="conservative_Christian" title="wikilink">conservative Christian</a> backgrounds. In the 2009/10 financial year party chairman <a href="Bob_Day" title="wikilink">Bob Day</a> made two loans totalling $405,000 to the Family First Party. Its performance, however in which it gained 4 per cent of the vote in several lower house seats and in the South Australian Senate race - was enough to secure it about $400,000 in Commonwealth election funding.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="elections-and-results">Elections and results</h2>
<h3 id="south-australian-election">2002 South Australian election</h3>
<p>The first election Family First contested was the <a href="South_Australian_state_election,_2002" title="wikilink">2002 South Australian Election</a>. <a href="Andrew_Evans_(pastor)" title="wikilink">Dr Andrew Evans</a> received a primary vote of 4.02% which, with preferences from other parties, was sufficient to get him elected to one of the 11 seats available in the <a href="South_Australian_Legislative_Council" title="wikilink">South Australian Legislative Council</a>.</p>
<h3 id="federal-election">2004 federal election</h3>
<p>The party agreed to share House of Representatives preferences with the <a href="Liberal_Party_of_Australia" title="wikilink">Liberal</a>-<a href="National_Party_of_Australia" title="wikilink">National</a> <a href="Coalition_(Australia)" title="wikilink">Coalition</a> at the <a href="Australian_federal_election,_2004" title="wikilink">2004 election</a><a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> (with some exceptions discussed below).</p>
<p>Family First picked up 1.76 percent of the vote nationally. <a href="Steve_Fielding" title="wikilink">Steve Fielding</a>, the lead candidate in Victoria, was successful in picking up the last Senate seat. Although he received a primary vote of only 1.88 percent (56,376 votes), he achieved the 14.3 percent quota required by a run of preferences including those from the <a href="Australian_Labor_Party" title="wikilink">Australian Labor Party</a>. The typically apolitical <a href="psephologist" class="uri" title="wikilink">psephologist</a> <a href="Malcolm_Mackerras" title="wikilink">Malcolm Mackerras</a> stated &quot;The outlandish result occurred in Victoria in 2004 where the Family First party was able to gather tickets from just about everywhere... this is a fluke. And I&lt;U+2019&gt;ve always referred to Senator Steve Fielding as the Fluke Senator&quot;.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p>The party also came close to picking up other Senate seats in <a href="Tasmania" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tasmania</a> (largely due to preferences from surplus Liberal votes) and in <a href="South_Australia" title="wikilink">South Australia</a> where the then party leader <a href="Andrea_Mason" title="wikilink">Andrea Mason</a> narrowly missed out (polling 3.98 percent and receiving Liberal preferences).</p>
<h3 id="state-elections-since-2004">State elections since 2004</h3>
<p>In the <a href="Western_Australian_state_election,_2005" title="wikilink">2005 Western Australian election</a>, Family First polled 21,701 votes in the Legislative Council where it contested 34 candidates<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> compared to 57 candidates in major parties.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> In the <a href="South_Australian_state_election,_2006" title="wikilink">2006 South Australian election</a>, Family First's vote increased to 4.98% in the Legislative Council, and a second Member of the Legislative Council was elected - former pharmaceutical executive <a href="Dennis_Hood" title="wikilink">Dennis Hood</a>. In several rural and outer metropolitan seats, Family First's vote approached 10% - and in the seat of Kavel, <a href="Thomas_Playford_V" title="wikilink">Tom Playford</a> achieved a vote of 15.7%.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> In the Legislative Council, Family First shares the <a href="balance_of_power_(parliament)" title="wikilink">balance of power</a> with the other minor parties and independents.</p>
<p>In the 2006 Queensland state election, Family First received a primary vote of 7% in contested seats (many seats were not contested), with a high of 14.5% and several other seats posting results of 10%.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a><a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> Queensland does not have an Upper House, and these results were insufficient for any candidates to be elected.</p>
<p>In the 2006 Victorian state election, Family First's vote increased from 1.9% to 4.27% of first preferences,<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> however no candidates were elected.</p>
<h3 id="federal-election-1">2007 federal election</h3>
<p>Family First contested the <a href="Australian_federal_election,_2007" title="wikilink">2007 federal election</a>, in particular seeking to increase its Senate representation. Nationwide, the party received 1.62 percent of the primary vote in the Senate, and 1.99 percent in the House of Representatives, both down slightly on the 2004 result. In Victoria however, both the <a href="Australian_federal_election,_2007/State-by-state_lower_house_results#Victoria" title="wikilink">lower</a> and <a href="Australian_federal_election,_2007/State-by-state_upper_house_results#Victoria" title="wikilink">upper house vote</a> increased by 0.64 percent, to 2.52 and 3.02 percent respectively. No Family First candidates were elected. Sitting Senator Steve Fielding's term does not expire until 2011.</p>
<p>Before the 2007 federal election, <a href="Fred_Nile" title="wikilink">Fred Nile</a> criticized Family First for giving preferences (in some states) to the <a href="Liberty_and_Democracy_Party" title="wikilink">Liberty and Democracy Party</a>, a <a href="libertarian" class="uri" title="wikilink">libertarian</a> political party that as one of its policies wants to legalize recreational drug use, stating &quot;They gave their preferences to the enemy, the anti-Christian party.&quot;<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> This was suggested as a reason for their poor election result.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> Fred Nile's own <a href="Christian_Democratic_Party_(Australia)" title="wikilink">Christian Democratic Party</a> had also preferenced the Liberty and Democracy Party before any other major party in the Senate.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
<p>In 2008, some newspapers claimed that Fielding wanted to &quot;relaunch himself as a mainstream political player, beyond Family First's ultra-conservative evangelical Christian support base.&quot; The reports indicated that Fielding had tried to recruit <a href="Tim_Costello" title="wikilink">Tim Costello</a> and others around the beginning of 2008 with a view to forming a new party, but had failed to convince them.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> The revelations came after Fielding changed his position on abortion, after being rebuffed by his party for taking a softer approach.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> Fielding denied the claims.</p>
<h3 id="federal-election-2">2010 federal election</h3>
<p>At the <a href="Australian_federal_election,_2010" title="wikilink">2010 federal election</a>, Family First contested the Senate in all states, but were not successful, with the national vote remaining at around two percent. Fielding's term ends on 1 July 2011, after which the Family First Party will no longer have federal parliamentary representation.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a><a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a><a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a></p>
<p>The Queensland Family First Senate candidate Wendy Francis created controversy when she compared allowing same-sex marriage to the stolen generations and to &quot;legalising child abuse&quot;.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="defections-from-other-parties">Defections from other parties</h2>
<p>The party has benefited from a series of high-profile defections.</p>
<ul>
<li>Former South Australian state Liberal minister <a href="Robert_Brokenshire" title="wikilink">Robert Brokenshire</a> contested the <a href="Australian_federal_election,_2007" title="wikilink">2007 federal election</a> for the party, and subsequently won preselection to replace retiring founder Evans in the state Legislative Council. At the 2010 South Australian Election, Robert Brokenshire was successfully re-elected as a Family First candidate for a Legislative Council seat.</li>
<li>In June 2008, former Western Australian deputy Liberal leader <a href="Dan_Sullivan_(politician)" title="wikilink">Dan Sullivan</a> announced that he would become the parliamentary leader of a new state branch of the party, <a href="WA_Family_First" title="wikilink">WA Family First</a>.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> Three former <a href="One_Nation_(Australia)" title="wikilink">One Nation</a> MPs have expressed support for the new party.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> On 14 August 2008, independent (former Liberal) Western Australian MP <a href="Anthony_Fels" title="wikilink">Anthony Fels</a> joined the Party.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> At the <a href="Western_Australian_state_election,_2008" title="wikilink">Western Australian state election, 2008</a> both Sullivan and Fels stood for seats in the <a href="Western_Australian_Legislative_Council" title="wikilink">Western Australian Legislative Council</a>, but neither was successful. Fels remained a member of the Legislative Council until his term expired in May 2009.</li>
<li>Also in June 2008, <a href="Bob_Randall_(politician)" title="wikilink">Bob Randall</a>, a former South Australian Liberal MP and party president joined the party, complaining that the Liberal Party had drifted too far to the &quot;left&quot;, and that &quot;Family First is the only truly conservative political force now left in Australia&quot;.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a></li>
<li>On 3 August 2008 <a href="Bob_Day" title="wikilink">Bob Day</a>, a prominent Coalition fundraiser and Liberal candidate for Makin in the 2007 federal election announced that he was joining Family First.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> He contested the <a href="Mayo_by-election,_2008" title="wikilink">Mayo by-election, 2008</a> for the party, gaining 11.4% of the primary vote, but was not elected.</li>

</ul>
<h2 id="policies">Policies</h2>
<h3 id="abortion">Abortion</h3>
<p>According to their web site, Family First say that they will &quot;seek to promote recognition and valuing of the inherent dignity of each human being from conception. In this context, Family First is opposed to the medical procedure of abortion.&quot;<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> Accordingly, Family First voted against allowing the <a href="abortifacient" class="uri" title="wikilink">abortifacient</a> drug <a href="RU-486" class="uri" title="wikilink">RU-486</a> into Australia.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="altruistic-surrogacy-and-same-sex-parenting">Altruistic surrogacy and same-sex parenting</h3>
<p>In the state of <a href="Queensland" class="uri" title="wikilink">Queensland</a> the Family First has opposed to Premier Bligh's introduction of altruistic <a href="surrogacy" class="uri" title="wikilink">surrogacy</a> and same-sex parenting. Family First's official stance on the issue is that &quot;the legislation is weighted heavily against the child. It is clearly about satisfying the desires of adults. No-one has a right to a child. A child is a subject of human rights, not an object of someone else&lt;U+2019&gt;s rights&quot;,<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> with the fact that also Article 3 of the Convention of the Rights of the Child states: &lt;U+2018&gt;In all actions concerning children, whether undertaken by public or private social welfare institutions, courts of law, administrative authorities or legislative bodies, the best interests of the child shall be a primary consideration.&lt;U+2019&gt;</p>
<p>Family First suggests that &quot;The proposed legislation will deny to some children their fundamental rights to both a father and a mother&quot;. Causing concern in and amongst the community regardless of political affiliation.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> Family First's comments on the legislation have been to the extant that &quot;While we understand the desire of adults to have children, we should not be placing those desires above the rights of a child. Children are not commodities and their interests should always come before the desires of adults. This is a form of social engineering and experimentation with children which would undermine the natural family in a way that would be of great concern to many people in this State. The new laws would not discriminate against same sex couples but rather discriminate against the right of a child to have both a mother and a father.&quot;<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="asylum-seekers">Asylum seekers</h3>
<p>Family First &quot;recognises the importance of ensuring well managed immigration programs that, while supporting Australia&lt;U+2019&gt;s interests, are also compassionate and supportive of families&quot;. Family First supports fast on-shore processing for <a href="asylum_seekers" title="wikilink">asylum seekers</a>.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> In 2006, Federal leader <a href="Steve_Fielding" title="wikilink">Steve Fielding</a> voted to oppose the Howard Government's offshore processing legislation.</p>
<p>As of 2009 onwards Australia has seen an increase in asylum seekers<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> and resulting from this Family First, along with other political parties have questioned the government on the growing number of arrivals. In a recent trip to <a href="Christmas_Island" title="wikilink">Christmas Island</a>, Family First's <a href="Steve_Fielding" title="wikilink">Steve Fielding</a> has told the public that conditions on the island's detention center is more like a hotel and is ready to burst.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> Family First has been lobbying government for a change of tactic, as the influx of asylum seekers has public opinion changing rapidly over the issue.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="drugs">Drugs</h3>
<p>&quot;Family First rejects <a href="harm_reduction" title="wikilink">harm minimisation</a> as the primary strategy for combating substance abuse. The Party favours prevention, <a href="drug_rehabilitation" title="wikilink">rehabilitation</a> and avoidance as more acceptable primary strategies.&quot;<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="environment">Environment</h3>
<p>Family First's environment and resources policy states that &quot;Family First is committed to the environment as essential to ensuring the health and happiness of future generations of families&quot;.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a></p>
<p>In the South Australian parliament, Family First MPs have taken outspoken positions on environmental topics such as desalination schemes and the Murray-Darling Basin. Family First MPs also successfully lobbied the government to include an interim 2020 greenhouse reduction target in Climate Change legislation.</p>
<p>In the <a href="Victorian_state_election,_2006" title="wikilink">2006 Victorian election</a>, Family First advocated several positions that the <a href="Australian_Conservation_Foundation" title="wikilink">Australian Conservation Foundation</a> viewed as non-environmental.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> These positions included the construction of new dams to increase water supplies, arguing for a reduction in fuel taxes, arguing against cuts to existing logging agreements, and supporting continued access to public lands for &quot;recreational fishing, shooting and hunting&quot;.</p>
<h3 id="euthanasia">Euthanasia</h3>
<p>Family First is opposed to <a href="euthanasia" class="uri" title="wikilink">euthanasia</a>, holding the view that &quot;the duty of health carers is to promote health, relieve suffering and safeguard life&quot;. Instead, they favour <a href="palliative_care" title="wikilink">palliative care</a>.</p>
<h3 id="sexuality">Sexuality</h3>
<p>Family First's <a href="LGBT_social_movements" title="wikilink">LGBT rights</a> policy is that &quot;all co-dependents should not be discriminated against &lt;U+2013&gt; whether Homosexual or not&quot;. However, Family First opposes <a href="LGBT_adoption" title="wikilink">LGBT adoption</a>, IVF treatment for <a href="lesbian" title="wikilink">lesbians</a>, and opposes <a href="same-sex_marriage" title="wikilink">same-sex marriage</a> and <a href="civil_union" title="wikilink">civil unions</a>, stating their declaration of marriage as &quot;a union of a man and a woman&quot;.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> In the <a href="Australian_federal_election,_2004" title="wikilink">2004 federal election</a> the party directed preferences to the Coalition ahead of Labor except in the seats of <a href="Division_of_Brisbane" title="wikilink">Brisbane</a> and <a href="Division_of_Leichhardt" title="wikilink">Leichhardt</a>.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> The party's lead senate candidate in Queensland, John Lewis indicated that the reason was the public advocacy on gay issues of the Liberal candidates for those seats.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a></p>
<p>In 2006, the two SA Family First MLCs voted against the Statutes Amendment (Domestic Partners) Bill.</p>
<h3 id="indigenous-australians">Indigenous Australians</h3>
<p>Family First was the first party in Australia to nominate an Aboriginal woman, lawyer <a href="Andrea_Mason" title="wikilink">Andrea Mason</a>, as party President. The party did hope to attract a large Aboriginal vote in South Australia where Andrea Mason was touted as possibly the first Aboriginal woman to be elected to parliament.</p>
<p>Although Family First's policy on indigenous Australians does not specifically address the <a href="Stolen_Generation" title="wikilink">Stolen Generation</a>, Mason has said: &quot;I think there is a cobweb, there is a veil over our country... in terms of this unresolved issue... I think that there will be a significant change in the way we perceive ourselves and our relationships with each other when there is an apology made to the stolen generations&quot;.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="industrial-relations">Industrial relations</h3>
<p>Family First was opposed to some aspects of the Howard government's <a href="Australian_Workplace_Agreement" title="wikilink">Australian Workplace Agreement</a> measures, campaigning against the measures in the Federal Senate, and voting against the 2005 <a href="WorkChoices" class="uri" title="wikilink">WorkChoices</a> legislation.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a> In his <a href="Maiden_Speech" title="wikilink">Maiden Speech</a>, Senator <a href="Steve_Fielding" title="wikilink">Steve Fielding</a> argued for a fairer work / rest / and 'family time' or leisure balance in opposing the measures.<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="pornography">Pornography</h3>
<p>Family First's <a href="internet_pornography" title="wikilink">internet pornography</a> policy calls for a &quot;Mandatory <a href="Content-control_software" title="wikilink">Filtering Scheme</a> at the ISP Server Level&quot; as a matter of child protection.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a></p>
<p>&quot;It is a national travesty that is so easily fixed if the Government and the opposition would exercise their moral will and pass legislation that requires Internet Service Providers (ISP's) to provide a compulsory filtering of pornography on the Internet... Adults can elect to opt out, but we are putting ISP's on notice that greater diligence is required&quot;, said Andrea Mason in a media release on Wednesday, 25 August 2004.</p>
<h3 id="war-in-iraq">War in Iraq</h3>
<p>Family First believes that the <a href="2003_invasion_of_Iraq" title="wikilink">2003 invasion of Iraq</a> was wrong because diplomatic avenues had not been exhausted, but that having participated in that invasion Australia is now obliged to protect Iraqis and Australians in Iraq through a military presence.</p>

<h2 id="political-relations">Political relations</h2>
<p>Family First and the <a href="Australian_Greens" title="wikilink">Australian Greens</a> are often at odds, with Family First often referring to the Greens as &quot;extreme&quot; in their media statements. The two parties are in competition for Senate preferences, particularly from the <a href="Australian_Labor_Party" title="wikilink">Labor Party</a>, and ideologically opposed on many issues.<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a><a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a> In the 2006 Victorian election, Family First's limited television advertising campaign specifically singled out the Greens for criticism.</p>

<p>}}</ref> and Family First Federal Secretary Dr Matt Burnet issued a press release stating:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The party is not a church party or an Assembly of God party, nor is it funded by AOG churches. It does see itself as socially conservative, with Family Values based on Christian ethics. Like any main-stream party we do not have on record the religious affiliations of any of our members. The Board of Reference in South Australia includes business-people, members of the medical profession, as well as ministers and people from Catholic, Baptist, Lutheran, Uniting and other church groups. The rapid national growth of the party leading into this election and the late decision to contest in all seats possible, has meant that in some states there are candidates, with strong family values, who have been introduced to the party through the personal relationships they have from their involvement in community/church networks&quot;.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>By August 2010, the party maintained its non-denominational stance and affirmed its affinity towards Christianity in stating &quot;Family First in 2010 is independent of any church or denomination...like so many other Australian institutions, at Family First our Christian heritage is something we are both proud of and grateful for.&quot;<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a></p>
<p>News reportage continued to associate the party with Assemblies of God, as did concerned church member Nathan Zamprogno, who commented publicly about the intersection of politics and the church.</p>
