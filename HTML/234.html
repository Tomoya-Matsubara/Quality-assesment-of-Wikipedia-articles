<p>The <strong>Klis Fortress</strong> () is a <a href="medieval" class="uri" title="wikilink">medieval</a> <a href="fortress" class="uri" title="wikilink">fortress</a> situated above a <a href="Klis" title="wikilink">village bearing the same name</a>, near the city of <a href="Split_(city)" title="wikilink">Split</a>, in central <a href="Dalmatia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Dalmatia</a>, <a href="Croatia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Croatia</a>. From its origin as a small <a href="fortification" title="wikilink">stronghold</a> built by the ancient <a href="Illyrians" title="wikilink">Illyrian</a> tribe <a href="Dalmatae" class="uri" title="wikilink">Dalmatae</a>, becoming a royal castle that was the seat of many <a href="Kingdom_of_Croatia_(medieval)" title="wikilink">Croatian kings</a>, to its final development as a large fortress during the <a href="Ottoman_wars_in_Europe" title="wikilink">Ottoman wars in Europe</a>, Klis Fortress has guarded the frontier, being lost and re-conquered several times throughout its more than two thousand year-long history. Due to its location on a pass that separates the mountains <a href="Mosor" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mosor</a> and <a href="Mali_Kozjak" title="wikilink">Kozjak</a>, the fortress served as a major source of defense in Dalmatia, especially against the <a href="Ottoman_Empire" title="wikilink">Ottoman</a> advance, and has been a key crossroad between the <a href="Mediterranean_Sea" title="wikilink">Mediterranean</a> belt and the <a href="Balkans" title="wikilink">Balkan</a> rear.</p>
<p>Since <a href="Mislav_of_Croatia" title="wikilink">Prince Mislav</a> of <a href="Principality_of_Littoral_Croatia" title="wikilink">Littoral Croatia</a> made Klis Fortress the seat of his throne in the middle of the 9th century, the fortress has served as the seat of many Croatia's rulers. The reign of his successor, <a href="Trpimir_I_of_Croatia" title="wikilink">Duke Trpimir I</a>, the founder of the Croatian royal <a href="House_of_Trpimirovi&lt;U+0107&gt;" title="wikilink">House of Trpimirovi&lt;U+0107&gt;</a>, is significant for spreading <a href="Christianity" class="uri" title="wikilink">Christianity</a> in the Littoral Croatia. He largely expanded the Klis Fortress, and in Ri&lt;U+017E&gt;inice, in the valley under the fortress, he built a <a href="church_(building)" title="wikilink">church</a> and the first <a href="Benedictine_monastery" title="wikilink">Benedictine monastery</a> in Croatia. During the reign of the first Croatian king, <a href="Tomislav_of_Croatia" title="wikilink">Tomislav</a>, Klis and <a href="Biograd_na_Moru" title="wikilink">Biograd na Moru</a> were his chief residences.</p>
<p>In March 1242 at Klis Fortress, <a href="Tatars" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tatars</a> who were a constituent segment of the <a href="Mongols" title="wikilink">Mongol</a> army under the leadership of <a href="Kadan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kadan</a> suffered a major defeat while in pursuit of the Hungarian army led by King <a href="B&lt;U+00E9&gt;la_IV_of_Hungary" title="wikilink">B&lt;U+00E9&gt;la IV</a>. After their defeat by Croatian forces, the Mongols retreated, and B&lt;U+00E9&gt;la IV rewarded many Croatian towns and nobles with &quot;substantial riches&quot;. During the <a href="Late_Middle_Ages" title="wikilink">Late Middle Ages</a>, the fortress was governed by <a href="Croatian_nobility" title="wikilink">Croatian nobility</a>, amongst whom <a href="Paul_I_&lt;U+0160&gt;ubi&lt;U+0107&gt;_of_Bribir" title="wikilink">Paul I &lt;U+0160&gt;ubi&lt;U+0107&gt; of Bribir</a> was the most significant. During his reign, the <a href="House_of_&lt;U+0160&gt;ubi&lt;U+0107&gt;" title="wikilink">House of &lt;U+0160&gt;ubi&lt;U+0107&gt;</a> controlled most of modern-day Croatia and Bosnia. Excluding the brief possession by the forces of <a href="Kingdom_of_Bosnia" title="wikilink">Bosnian King</a>, <a href="Tvrtko_I_of_Bosnia" title="wikilink">Tvrtko I</a>, the fortress remained in Hungaro-Croatian hands for the next several hundred years, until the 16th century.</p>
<p>Klis Fortress is probably best known for its defense against the <a href="Ottoman_wars_in_Europe" title="wikilink">Ottoman invasion of Europe</a> in the early 16th century. Croatian captain <a href="Petar_Kru&lt;U+017E&gt;i&lt;U+0107&gt;" title="wikilink">Petar Kru&lt;U+017E&gt;i&lt;U+0107&gt;</a> led the defense of the fortress against a Turkish invasion and siege that lasted for more than two and a half decades. During this defense, as Kru&lt;U+017E&gt;i&lt;U+0107&gt; and his soldiers fought without allies against the Turks, the military faction of <a href="Uskoks" class="uri" title="wikilink">Uskoks</a> was formed, which later became famous as an elite Croatian militant sect. Ultimately, the defenders were defeated and the fortress was occupied by the Ottomans in 1537. After more than a century under Ottoman rule, in 1669, Klis Fortress was besieged and seized by the <a href="Republic_of_Venice" title="wikilink">Republic of Venice</a>, thus moving the border between Christian and Muslim Europe further east and helping to contribute to the decline of the Ottoman Empire. The Venetians restored and enlarged the fortress, but it was taken by the <a href="Austrians" class="uri" title="wikilink">Austrians</a> after <a href="Napoleon_I" title="wikilink">Napoleon</a> extinguished the republic itself in 1797. Today, Klis Fortress contains a museum where visitors to this historic military structure can see an array of arms, armor, and traditional uniforms.</p>

<p>From the early 7th century on, Klis was an important Croat stronghold, and later, one of the seats of many Croatia's rulers.<ref name="gra<U+0111>evinar&quot;/&gt; In the 9th century, Croatian prince <a href="Mislav_of_Croatia" title="wikilink">Mislav</a> of <a href="Principality_of_Littoral_Croatia" title="wikilink">Littoral Croatia</a>, from 835 to 845, made the castle of Klis seat of his throne.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> Despite <a href="Franks" title="wikilink">Frankish</a> overlordship, the Franks had almost no role in Littoral Croatia in the period from the 820s through 840s.

<p>The Klis Fortress rises on a bare cliff divided into two parts.<ref name="gra<U+0111>evinar&quot;/&gt; The first, lower part is on the west, out topped by Mount Greben from the north.<ref name="gra<U+0111>evinar&quot;/&gt; The second, higher part is on the east, and includes the Tower &quot;Oprah&quot;, whose name most likely refers to a specific part in the defense.<ref name="gra<U+0111>evinar&quot;/&gt; In this section which was not topped by any side, was located the flat of the <a href="Commander" class="uri" title="wikilink">Commander</a>.<ref name="gra<U+0111>evinar&quot;/&gt; The only entrance into the fortress is from the western side.<ref name="gra<U+0111>evinar&quot;/&gt; On the southwest side of the fortress, and bellow it was a resort (part of modern village of Klis) called &quot;borgo&quot; or &quot;suburbium&quot;, surrounded by double walls with 100&lt;U+2013&gt;200 towers.<ref name="gra<U+0111>evinar&quot;/&gt; A similar but smaller resort (also part of modern village of Klis) existed below Mount Greben on a plateau called Megdan.<ref name="gra<U+0111>evinar&quot;/&gt; This included <a href="lazaretto" title="wikilink">lazarettoes</a> and <a href="quarantine" title="wikilink">quarantines</a> which were in Turkish times called &quot;nazanama&quot;.<ref name="gra<U+0111>evinar&quot;/&gt; There were also many inns for travellers, which were used for isolation during epidemics.<ref name="gra<U+0111>evinar&quot;/&gt; Thus, the coastal towns, primarily the town of Split was protected from epidemics that came from Bosnia.<ref name="gra<U+0111>evinar&quot;/&gt; Near the fortress, there were several sources of drinking water, and the closest was the &quot;<a href="Biblical_Magi" title="wikilink">Holy Biblical Magi</a>&quot; whose importance was invaluable during long sieges.<ref name="gra<U+0111>evinar&quot;/&gt;</p>

<p><img src="Split_at_night.jpg" title="fig:View towards Split." alt="View towards Split." width="160" /> The fortress was built into the south face of a rocky mass, and is barely discernable from the distance as a man-made structure.<a href="#fn122" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref122"><sup>122</sup></a> The defensive capabilities of the fortress have been tested through history in many <a href="military" class="uri" title="wikilink">military</a> operations.<ref name="gra<U+0111>evinar&quot;/&gt; During the centuries of its use, the structure served various armies and has undergone a number of renovations, to keep up with the development of arms.<ref name="gra<U+0111>evinar&quot;/&gt; The original appearance of the fortress is no longer known, due to the structural changes undertaken by Croatian nobility, Turks, Venetians and Austrians.<ref name="gra<U+0111>evinar&quot;/&gt; The present day aspect of a mostly <a href="Rock_(geology)" title="wikilink">stone</a> fortress dates back to the restructuring work carried out by the Venetians in the 17th century.<a href="#fn123" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref123"><sup>123</sup></a></p>
