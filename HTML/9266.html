They are at shooting distance of one another which allows the defend a wide area without the cost of a continuous <a href="defensive_wall" title="wikilink">defensive wall</a>. The first one was build (1865-1872) by the <a href="British_Army" title="wikilink">British Army</a> and the other ones by private businesses (1865-1869). The costs were almost identical for all three, ranging from 57,600 to 59,762 pounds.</p>
<p>During the <a href="American_Civil_War" title="wikilink">American Civil War</a>, Great Britain claimed to remain neutral in the conflict. However, the coton directly imported from the south of the Unites States still had a great importance in the British textile industry. Following the Civil War, the British were still expecting an American invasion of Canada.</p>
<p>The tense political relationship between <a href="Austria" class="uri" title="wikilink">Austria</a> and <a href="Prussia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Prussia</a> had the British worried about their wood supply, if the access to the <a href="Baltic_Sea" title="wikilink">Baltic Sea</a> was blocked. The Canadian forests would then be used as Great Britain main wood supply.</p>
<p>Lieutenant-Colonel <a href="William_Francis_Drummond_Jervois" title="wikilink">William Francis Drummond Jervois</a> was sent to Canada to establish the Canadian defence plan. He suggested that detached forts be built on Pointe-L&lt;U+00E9&gt;vy, on the south shore of Quebec City. The original plans recommanded 5 forts, of which 3 were actually built.</p>
