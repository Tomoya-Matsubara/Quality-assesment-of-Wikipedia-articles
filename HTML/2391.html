<p><strong>Animal consciousness</strong>, or <strong>animal awareness</strong>, has been actively researched for over 100 years.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> In 1927, Carr argued that any valid measure or understanding of awareness in animals depends on &quot;an accurate and complete knowledge of its essential conditions in man&quot;.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> According to Burghardt, 1985, &quot;the best approach is to use experiment (especially psychophysics) and observation to trace the dawning and ontogeny of self-consciousness, perception, communication, intention, beliefs, and reflection in normal human fetuses, infants, and children.&quot;<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>The topic of animal consciousness is beset by a number of difficulties. It poses the <a href="problem_of_other_minds" title="wikilink">problem of other minds</a> in an especially severe form, because animals, lacking the ability to express human language, cannot tell us about their experiences.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> Also, it is difficult to reason objectively about the question, because a denial that an animal is conscious is often taken to imply that it does not feel, its life has no value, and that harming it is not morally wrong. The 17th-century French philosopher <a href="Ren&lt;U+00E9&gt;_Descartes" title="wikilink">Ren&lt;U+00E9&gt; Descartes</a>, for example, has sometimes been blamed for mistreatment of animals because he argued that only humans are conscious.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p>Philosophers who consider subjective experience the essence of consciousness also generally believe, as a correlate, that the existence and nature of animal consciousness can never rigorously be known. <a href="Thomas_Nagel" title="wikilink">Thomas Nagel</a> spelled out this point of view in an influential essay titled <em><a href="What_Is_it_Like_to_Be_a_Bat?" title="wikilink">What Is it Like to Be a Bat?</a></em>. He said that an organism is conscious &quot;if and only if there is something that it is like to be that organism &lt;U+2014&gt; something it is like <em>for</em> the organism&quot;; and he argued that no matter how much we know about an animal's brain and behavior, we can never really put ourselves into the mind of the animal and experience its world in the way it does itself.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> Other thinkers, such as <a href="Douglas_Hofstadter" title="wikilink">Douglas Hofstadter</a>, dismiss this argument as incoherent.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> Several psychologists and ethologists have argued for the existence of animal consciousness by describing a range of behaviors that appear to show animals holding beliefs about things they cannot directly perceive &lt;U+2014&gt; <a href="Donald_Griffin" title="wikilink">Donald Griffin</a>'s 2001 book <em>Animal Minds</em> reviews a substantial portion of the evidence.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>

<p>The <a href="mind&lt;U+2013&gt;body_problem" title="wikilink">mind&lt;U+2013&gt;body problem</a> in philosophy examines the relationship between <a href="mind" class="uri" title="wikilink">mind</a> and matter, and in particular the relationship between <a href="consciousness" class="uri" title="wikilink">consciousness</a> and the brain. A variety of approaches have been proposed. Most are either <a href="Dualism_(philosophy_of_mind)" title="wikilink">dualist</a> or <a href="Monism" title="wikilink">monist</a>. Dualism maintains a rigid distinction between the realms of mind and matter. Monism maintains that there is only one kind of stuff, and that mind and matter are both aspects of it. The problem was addressed by pre-<a href="Aristotelianism" title="wikilink">Aristotelian</a> philosophers,<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a><a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> and was famously addressed by <a href="Ren&lt;U+00E9&gt;_Descartes" title="wikilink">Ren&lt;U+00E9&gt; Descartes</a> in the 17th century, resulting in <a href="Dualism_(philosophy_of_mind)" title="wikilink">Cartesian dualism</a>. Descartes believed that humans only, and not animals have this non-physical mind.</p>
<p>The rejection of the mind&lt;U+2013&gt;body dichotomy is found in French <a href="Structuralism" class="uri" title="wikilink">Structuralism</a>, and is a position that generally characterized post-war <a href="French_philosophy" title="wikilink">French philosophy</a>.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> The absence of an empirically identifiable meeting point between the non-physical mind and its physical extension has proven problematic to dualism and many modern philosophers of mind maintain that the mind is not something separate from the body.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> These approaches have been particularly influential in the sciences, particularly in the fields of <a href="sociobiology" class="uri" title="wikilink">sociobiology</a>, <a href="computer_science" title="wikilink">computer science</a>, <a href="evolutionary_psychology" title="wikilink">evolutionary psychology</a>, and the <a href="neuroscience" title="wikilink">neurosciences</a>.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a><a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a><a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a><a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="epiphenomenalism">Epiphenomenalism</h3>
<p><a href="Epiphenomenalism" class="uri" title="wikilink">Epiphenomenalism</a> is the theory in <a href="philosophy_of_mind" title="wikilink">philosophy of mind</a> that mental phenomena are caused by physical processes in the brain or that both are effects of a common cause, as opposed to mental phenomena driving the physical mechanics of the brain. The impression that thoughts, feelings, or sensations cause physical effects, is therefore to be understood as illusory to some extent. For example, it is not the feeling of fear that produces an increase in heart beat, both are symptomatic of a common physiological origin, possibly in response to a legitimate external threat.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
<p>The history of epiphenomenalism goes back to the post-Cartesian attempt to solve the riddle of <a href="Cartesian_dualism" title="wikilink">Cartesian dualism</a>, i.e., of how mind and body could interact. <a href="Julien_Offray_de_La_Mettrie" title="wikilink">La Mettrie</a>, <a href="Gottfried_Leibniz" title="wikilink">Leibniz</a> and <a href="Baruch_Spinoza" title="wikilink">Spinoza</a> all in their own way began this way of thinking. The idea that even if the animal were conscious nothing would be added to the production of behavior, even in animals of the human type, was first voiced by La Mettrie (1745), and then by <a href="Pierre_Jean_George_Cabanis" title="wikilink">Cabanis</a> (1802), and was further explicated by <a href="Hodgson" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hodgson</a> (1870) and <a href="T.H._Huxley" title="wikilink">Huxley</a> (1874).<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a><a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> Huxley (1874) likened mental phenomena to the whistle on a steam locomotive. However, epiphenomenalism flourished primarily as it found a niche among methodological or scientific behaviorism. In the early 1900s <a href="behaviorism" title="wikilink">scientific behaviorists</a> such as <a href="Ivan_Pavlov" title="wikilink">Ivan Pavlov</a>, <a href="John_B._Watson" title="wikilink">John B. Watson</a>, and <a href="B._F._Skinner" title="wikilink">B. F. Skinner</a> began the attempt to uncover laws describing the relationship between stimuli and responses, without reference to inner mental phenomena. Instead of adopting a form of <a href="eliminative_materialism" title="wikilink">eliminativism</a> or mental <a href="fictionalism" class="uri" title="wikilink">fictionalism</a>, positions that deny that inner mental phenomena exist, a behaviorist was able to adopt epiphenomenalism in order to allow for the existence of mind. However, by the 1960s, scientific behaviourism met substantial difficulties and eventually gave way to the <a href="cognitive_revolution" title="wikilink">cognitive revolution</a>. Participants in that revolution, such as <a href="Jerry_Fodor" title="wikilink">Jerry Fodor</a>, reject epiphenomenalism and insist upon the efficacy of the mind. Fodor even speaks of &quot;epiphobia&quot;—fear that one is becoming an epiphenomenalist.</p>

<p>In 1976 <a href="Richard_Dawkins" title="wikilink">Richard Dawkins</a> wrote, &quot;The evolution of the capacity to simulate seems to have culminated in subjective consciousness. Why this should have happened is, to me, the most profound mystery facing modern biology&quot;.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> In 2004, eight neuroscientists felt it was still too soon for a definition.

<dd>&quot;We have no idea how consciousness emerges from the physical activity of the brain and we do not know whether consciousness can emerge from non-biological systems, such as computers... At this point the reader will expect to find a careful and precise definition of consciousness. You will be disappointed. Consciousness has not yet become a scientific term that can be defined in this way. Currently we all use the term <em>consciousness</em> in many different and often ambiguous ways.

<p><a href="Consciousness" class="uri" title="wikilink">Consciousness</a> is sometimes defined as the quality or state of being aware of an external object or something within oneself.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a><a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> It has been defined somewhat vaguely as: <a href="subjectivity" class="uri" title="wikilink">subjectivity</a>, <a href="awareness" class="uri" title="wikilink">awareness</a>, <a href="sentience" class="uri" title="wikilink">sentience</a>, the ability to <a href="experience" class="uri" title="wikilink">experience</a> or to <a href="feeling" title="wikilink">feel</a>, wakefulness, having a sense of <a href="self" title="wikilink">selfhood</a>, and the executive control system of the mind.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> Despite the difficulty in definition, many philosophers believe that there is a broadly shared underlying intuition about what consciousness is.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> <a href="Max_Velmans" title="wikilink">Max Velmans</a> and Susan Schneider wrote in <em>The Blackwell Companion to Consciousness</em>: &quot;Anything that we are aware of at a given moment forms part of our consciousness, making conscious experience at once the most familiar and most mysterious aspect of our lives.&quot;<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a></p>
<p>Related terms, also often used in vague or ambiguous ways, are:</p>

<li><a href="Awareness" class="uri" title="wikilink">Awareness</a>: the state or ability to perceive, to feel, or to be <a href="conscious" class="uri" title="wikilink">conscious</a> of events, <a href="Object_(philosophy)" title="wikilink">objects</a>, or sensory <a href="pattern" title="wikilink">patterns</a>. In this level of consciousness, sense data can be confirmed by an observer without necessarily implying <a href="understanding" class="uri" title="wikilink">understanding</a>. More broadly, it is the state or quality of being aware of something. In <a href="biological_psychology" title="wikilink">biological psychology</a>, awareness is defined as a human's or an animal's <a href="perception" class="uri" title="wikilink">perception</a> and <a href="cognitive" class="uri" title="wikilink">cognitive</a> reaction to a condition or event.</li>
<li><a href="Self-awareness" class="uri" title="wikilink">Self-awareness</a>: the capacity for <a href="introspection" class="uri" title="wikilink">introspection</a> and the ability to reconcile oneself as an individual separate from the environment and other individuals.</li>
<li><a href="Self-consciousness" class="uri" title="wikilink">Self-consciousness</a>: an <a href="Acute_(medicine)" title="wikilink">acute</a> sense of self-awareness. It is a preoccupation with oneself, as opposed to the philosophical state of <a href="self-awareness" class="uri" title="wikilink">self-awareness</a>, which is the awareness that one exists as an individual being; although some writers use both terms interchangeably or synonymously.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a></li>
<li><a href="Sentience" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sentience</a>: the ability to be aware (<a href="feeling" title="wikilink">feel</a>, <a href="perception" title="wikilink">perceive</a>, or be <a href="consciousness" title="wikilink">conscious</a>) of one's surroundings or to have subjective experiences. Sentience is a minimalistic way of defining consciousness, which is otherwise commonly used to collectively describe sentience plus other characteristics of the mind.</li>
<li><a href="Sapience" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sapience</a>: often defined as wisdom, or the ability of an organism or entity to act with appropriate <a href="Value_judgment" title="wikilink">judgment</a>, a mental faculty which is a component of <a href="Intelligence_(trait)" title="wikilink">intelligence</a> or alternatively may be considered an additional faculty, apart from intelligence, with its own properties.</li>
</ul>
<p>Sentience (being aware of one's surroundings) is not the same as self-awareness (being aware of oneself as an individual). The <a href="mirror_test" title="wikilink">mirror test</a> is sometimes considered to be an operational test for self-awareness, and the handful of animals that have passed the <a href="mirror_test" title="wikilink">mirror test</a> are often considered to be self-aware.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a><a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> It remains debatable whether recognition of one's mirror image can be properly construed to imply full self-awareness,<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> particularly given that robots are being constructed which appear to pass the test.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a><a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a></p>

<p>Since <a href="Descartes" class="uri" title="wikilink">Descartes</a>'s proposal of <a href="dualism" class="uri" title="wikilink">dualism</a>, it became a general consensus that the mind had become a matter of <a href="philosophy" class="uri" title="wikilink">philosophy</a> and that science was not able to penetrate the issue of consciousness- that consciousness was outside of space and time. However, over the last 20 years, many scholars have begun to move toward a science of consciousness. Such notable neuroscientists that have led the move to neural correlates of the self and of consciousness are <a href="Antonio_Damasio" title="wikilink">Antonio Damasio</a> and <a href="Gerald_Edelman" title="wikilink">Gerald Edelman</a>. Damasio has demonstrated that emotions and their biological foundation play a critical role in high level cognition,<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a><a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> and Edelman has created a framework for analyzing consciousness through a scientific outlook.

<p><a href="Eugene_Linden" title="wikilink">Eugene Linden</a>, author of <em>The Parrot's Lament</em> suggests there are many examples of animal behavior and intelligence that surpass what people would suppose to be the boundary of animal consciousness.

<p>Philosopher <a href="Daniel_Dennett" title="wikilink">Daniel Dennett</a> counters that: </p>
<p>Consciousness in mammals (this includes humans) is an aspect of the mind generally thought to comprise qualities such as <a href="subjectivity" class="uri" title="wikilink">subjectivity</a>, <a href="sentience" class="uri" title="wikilink">sentience</a>, and the ability to <a href="perception" title="wikilink">perceive</a> the relationship between <a href="Personal_identity_(philosophy)" title="wikilink">oneself</a> and one's <a href="environment_(biophysical)" title="wikilink">environment</a>.

The best known research technique in this area is the <a href="mirror_test" title="wikilink">mirror test</a> devised by <a href="Gordon_G._Gallup" title="wikilink">Gordon G.

<p>There have been numerous findings in the past 30 years which display fairly clear evidence of possessors of self-recognition. Self-awareness, by this criterion, has been reported for:</p>

<p>It was recently thought that self-recognition was restricted to mammals with large brains and highly evolved social cognition but absent from animals without a <a href="neocortex" class="uri" title="wikilink">neocortex</a>. However, in a recent study, an investigation of self-recognition in <a href="corvids" class="uri" title="wikilink">corvids</a> was carried out, and significant result quantified the ability of self-recognition in the magpie. Mammals and birds inherited the same brain components from their last common <a href="ancestor" class="uri" title="wikilink">ancestor</a> nearly 300 million years ago, and have since independently evolved and formed significantly different brain types. The results of the mirror and mark tests showed that neocortex-less <a href="magpies" class="uri" title="wikilink">magpies</a> are capable of understanding that a mirror image belongs to their own body. The findings show that magpies respond in the mirror and mark test in a manner similar to apes, dolphins and elephants. This is a remarkable capability that, although not fully concrete in its determination of self-recognition, is at least a prerequisite of self-recognition. This is not only of interest regarding the convergent evolution of social intelligence; it is also valuable for an understanding of the general principles that govern cognitive evolution and their underlying neural mechanisms. The magpies were chosen to study based on their empathy/ lifestyle, a possible precursor for their ability of self-awareness.<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a></p>
<p>It should be mentioned that even in the chimpanzee, the species most studied and with the most convincing findings, clear-cut evidence of self-recognition is not obtained in all individuals tested. Occurrence is about 75% in young adults and considerably less in young and old individuals.<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a> For monkeys, non-primate mammals, and in a number of bird species, exploration of the mirror and social displays were observed. However, hints at mirror-induced self-directed behavior have been obtained.<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a> The mirror test has attracted controversy among some researchers because it is entirely focused on vision, the primary sense in humans, while other species rely more heavily on other senses such as the <a href="olfactory" class="uri" title="wikilink">olfactory</a> sense in dogs.<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a></p>

<p>Another approach to determine whether a non-human animal is conscious derives from passive speech research with a macaw (see <a href="Talking_Birds#Arielle" title="wikilink">Arielle</a>). Some researchers propose that by passively listening to an animal's voluntary speech, it is possible to learn about the thoughts of another creature and to determine that the speaker is conscious. This type of research was originally used to investigate a child's <a href="crib_talk" title="wikilink">crib speech</a> by Weir (1962) and in investigations of early speech in children by Greenfield and others (1976).</p>

<h3 id="pain-or-suffering">Pain or suffering</h3>

<p>Further arguments revolve around the ability of animals to feel <a href="pain" class="uri" title="wikilink">pain</a> or <a href="suffering" class="uri" title="wikilink">suffering</a>. Suffering implies consciousness. If animals can be shown to suffer in a way similar or identical to humans, many of the arguments against human suffering could then, presumably, be extended to animals. Others have argued that pain can be demonstrated by averse reactions to negative stimuli that are non-purposeful or even maladaptive.<a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a> One such reaction is <a href="transmarginal_inhibition" title="wikilink">transmarginal inhibition</a>, a phenomenon observed in humans and some animals akin to <a href="mental_breakdown" title="wikilink">mental breakdown</a>.</p>
<p>As noted by John Webster, a professor of animal husbandry at Bristol: </p>
<p>However, there is no agreement where the line between organisms that can feel pain and those that cannot should be drawn. Justin Leiber, a philosophy professor at <a href="Oxford_University" title="wikilink">Oxford University</a> writes that: </p>
<p>There are also some who reject the argument entirely, arguing that although suffering animals feel anguish, a suffering plant also struggles to stay alive (albeit in a less visible way). In fact, no living organism 'wants' to die for another organism's sustenance.

<p><a href="Neuroscience" class="uri" title="wikilink">Neuroscience</a> is the scientific study of the <a href="nervous_system" title="wikilink">nervous system</a>.<a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a> It is a highly active <a href="interdisciplinary" class="uri" title="wikilink">interdisciplinary</a> science that collaborates with many other fields. The scope of neuroscience has broadened recently to include <a href="molecular_biology" title="wikilink">molecular</a>, <a href="cellular_neuroscience" title="wikilink">cellular</a>, <a href="neural_development" title="wikilink">developmental</a>, <a href="neuroanatomy" title="wikilink">structural</a>, <a href="neurophysiology" title="wikilink">functional</a>, <a href="evolutionary_neuroscience" title="wikilink">evolutionary</a>, <a href="computational_neuroscience" title="wikilink">computational</a>, and <a href="neurological_disorders" title="wikilink">medical</a> aspects of the nervous system. Theoretical studies of <a href="neural_network" title="wikilink">neural networks</a> are being complemented with techniques for <a href="brain_mapping" title="wikilink">imaging</a> sensory and motor tasks in the <a href="brain" class="uri" title="wikilink">brain</a>. According to a 2008 paper, neuroscience explanations of psychological phenomena currently have a &quot;seductive allure&quot;, and &quot;seem to generate more public interest&quot; than explanations which do not contain neuroscientific information.<a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a> They found that subjects who were not neuroscience experts &quot;judged that explanations with logically irrelevant neuroscience information were more satisfying than explanations without.<a href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a></p>
<h4 id="neural-correlates">Neural correlates</h4>

<p>The <a href="neural_correlates_of_consciousness" title="wikilink">neural correlates of consciousness</a> constitute the minimal set of neuronal events and mechanisms sufficient for a specific conscious <a href="Perception#Process_and_terminology" title="wikilink">percept</a>.<a href="#fn67" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a> Neuroscientists use empirical approaches to discover <a href="neural_correlate" title="wikilink">neural correlates</a> of subjective phenomena.<a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a> The set should be <em>minimal</em> because, if the brain is sufficient to give rise to any given conscious experience, the question is which of its components is necessary to produce it.</p>
<p>A feature that distinguishes humans from most animals is that we are not born with an extensive repertoire of behavioral programs that would enable us to survive on our own (&quot;<a href="physiological_prematurity" title="wikilink">physiological prematurity</a>&quot;). To compensate for this, we have an unmatched ability to learn, i.e., to consciously acquire such programs by imitation or exploration. Once consciously acquired and sufficiently exercised, these programs can become automated to the extent that their execution happens beyond the realms of our awareness. Take, as an example, the incredible fine motor skills exerted in playing a Beethoven piano sonata or the sensorimotor coordination required to ride a motorcycle along a curvy mountain road. Such complex behaviors are possible only because a sufficient number of the subprograms involved can be executed with minimal or even suspended conscious control. In fact, the conscious system may actually interfere somewhat with these automated programs.<a href="#fn69" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref69"><sup>69</sup></a></p>
<p>The growing ability of neuroscientists to manipulate neurons using methods from molecular biology in combination with optical tools depends on the simultaneous development of appropriate behavioural assays and model organisms amenable to large-scale genomic analysis and manipulation.<a href="#fn70" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a> A combination of such fine-grained neuronal analysis in animals with ever more sensitive psychophysical and brain imaging techniques in humans, complemented by the development of a robust theoretical predictive framework, will hopefully lead to a rational understanding of consciousness.</p>

</figure>
<p>The <a href="neocortex" class="uri" title="wikilink">neocortex</a> is a part of the brain of mammals. It consists of the <a href="grey_matter" title="wikilink">grey matter</a>, or neuronal cell bodies and <a href="myelin" title="wikilink">unmyelinated</a> fibers, surrounding the deeper <a href="white_matter" title="wikilink">white matter</a> (<a href="myelin" title="wikilink">myelinated</a> <a href="axon" title="wikilink">axons</a>) in the <a href="cerebrum" class="uri" title="wikilink">cerebrum</a>. The neocortex is smooth in <a href="rodent" title="wikilink">rodents</a> and other small mammals, whereas in <a href="primate" title="wikilink">primates</a> and other larger mammals it has deep grooves and wrinkles. These folds increase the surface area of the neocortex considerably without taking up too much more volume. Also, neurons within the same wrinkle have more opportunity for connectivity, while neurons in different wrinkles have less opportunity for connectivity, leading to compartmentalization of the cortex. The neocortex is divided into <a href="frontal_lobe" title="wikilink">frontal</a>, <a href="parietal_lobe" title="wikilink">parietal</a>, <a href="occipital_lobe" title="wikilink">occipital</a>, and <a href="temporal_lobe" title="wikilink">temporal</a> lobes, which perform different functions. For example, the occipital lobe contains the <a href="primary_visual_cortex" title="wikilink">primary visual cortex</a>, and the temporal lobe contains the <a href="primary_auditory_cortex" title="wikilink">primary auditory cortex</a>. Further subdivisions or areas of neocortex are responsible for more specific cognitive processes. The neocortex is the newest part of the <a href="cerebral_cortex" title="wikilink">cerebral cortex</a> to evolve (hence the prefix &quot;neo&quot;); the other parts of the cerebral cortex are the <a href="paleocortex" class="uri" title="wikilink">paleocortex</a> and <a href="archicortex" class="uri" title="wikilink">archicortex</a>, collectively known as the <a href="allocortex" class="uri" title="wikilink">allocortex</a>. In humans, 90% of the cerebral cortex is neocortex.</p>
<p>Researchers have argued that consciousness arises in the neocortex, and therefore cannot arise in animals which lack a neocortex. For example, Rose argued in 2002 that the &quot;fishes have nervous systems that mediate effective escape and avoidance responses to noxious stimuli, but, these responses must occur without a concurrent, human-like awareness of pain, suffering or distress, which depend on separately evolved neocortex.&quot;<a href="#fn72" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref72"><sup>72</sup></a> Recently that view has been challenged, and many researchers now believe that animal consciousness can arise from <a href="Homology_(biology)" title="wikilink">homologous</a> <a href="subcortical" class="uri" title="wikilink">subcortical</a> brain networks.<a href="#fn73" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref73"><sup>73</sup></a></p>
<h4 id="attention">Attention</h4>
<p><a href="Attention" class="uri" title="wikilink">Attention</a> is the <a href="cognitive_process" title="wikilink">cognitive process</a> of selectively concentrating on one aspect of the environment while ignoring other things. Attention has also been referred to as the allocation of processing resources.<a href="#fn74" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref74"><sup>74</sup></a> Attention also has variations amongst cultures. Voluntary attention develops in specific cultural and institutional contexts through engagement in cultural activities with more competent community members.<a href="#fn75" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref75"><sup>75</sup></a></p>
<p>Most experiments show that one <a href="neural_correlate" title="wikilink">neural correlate</a> of attention is enhanced firing. If a neuron has a certain response to a stimulus when the animal is not attending to the stimulus, then when the animal does attend to the stimulus, the neuron's response will be enhanced even if the physical characteristics of the stimulus remain the same. In many cases attention produces changes in the <a href="EEG" class="uri" title="wikilink">EEG</a>. Many animals, including humans, produce <a href="gamma_wave" title="wikilink">gamma waves</a> (40&lt;U+2013&gt;60 Hz) when focusing attention on a particular object or activity.<a href="#fn76" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref76"><sup>76</sup></a></p>
<h4 id="extended-consciousness">Extended consciousness</h4>
<p><a href="Extended_consciousness" title="wikilink">Extended consciousness</a> is an animal's autobiographical self-perception. It is thought to arise in the brains of animals which have a substantial capacity for memory and reason. It does not necessarily require language. The perception of a historic and future self arises from a stream of information from the immediate environment and from neural structures related to memory. The concept was popularised by <a href="Antonio_Damasio" title="wikilink">Antonio Damasio</a> and is used in <a href="biological_psychology" title="wikilink">biological psychology</a>. Extended consciousness is said to arise in structures in the <a href="human_brain" title="wikilink">human brain</a> described as <em>image spaces</em> and <em>dispositional spaces</em>. Image spaces imply areas where <a href="senses" title="wikilink">sensory</a> impressions of all types are processed, including the focused awareness of the <a href="core_consciousness" title="wikilink">core consciousness</a>. Dispositional spaces include convergence zones, which are networks in the brain where memories are processed and recalled, and where knowledge is merged with immediate experience.<a href="#fn77" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref77"><sup>77</sup></a><a href="#fn78" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref78"><sup>78</sup></a></p>
<h4 id="metacognition">Metacognition</h4>
<p>It has been suggested that <a href="metacognition" class="uri" title="wikilink">metacognition</a> in some animals provides some evidence for cognitive self-awareness.<a href="#fn79" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref79"><sup>79</sup></a> The great apes, dolphins, and <a href="rhesus_monkeys" title="wikilink">rhesus monkeys</a> have demonstrated the ability to monitor their own mental states and use an &quot;I don't know&quot; response to avoid answering difficult questions. These species might also be aware of the strength of their memories. Unlike the mirror test, which relies primarily on body images and bodily self-awareness, uncertainty monitoring paradigms are focused on the kinds of mental states that might be linked to mental self-awareness.</p>
<p><a href="Metacognition" class="uri" title="wikilink">Metacognition</a> is defined as &quot;<a href="cognition" class="uri" title="wikilink">cognition</a> about cognition&quot;, or &quot;knowing about knowing.&quot;<a href="#fn80" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref80"><sup>80</sup></a> It can take many forms; it includes knowledge about when and how to use particular strategies for learning or for problem solving.<a href="#fn81" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref81"><sup>81</sup></a> There are generally two components of metacognition: knowledge about cognition, and regulation of cognition.<a href="#fn82" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref82"><sup>82</sup></a> Writings on metacognition can be traced back at least as far as <em><a href="On_the_Soul" title="wikilink">De Anima</a></em> and the <em><a href="Parva_Naturalia" title="wikilink">Parva Naturalia</a></em> of the Greek philosopher <a href="Aristotle" class="uri" title="wikilink">Aristotle</a>.<a href="#fn83" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref83"><sup>83</sup></a> Metacognologists believe that the ability to consciously think about thinking is unique to <a href="sapience" title="wikilink">sapient</a> species and indeed is one of the definitions of sapience. There is evidence that <a href="Rhesus_macaque" title="wikilink">rhesus monkeys</a> and apes can make accurate judgments about the strengths of their memories of fact and monitor their own uncertainty,<a href="#fn84" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref84"><sup>84</sup></a> while attempts to demonstrate metacognition in birds have been inconclusive.<a href="#fn85" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref85"><sup>85</sup></a> A 2007 study has provided some evidence for metacognition in <a href="rat" title="wikilink">rats</a>,<a href="#fn86" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref86"><sup>86</sup></a><a href="#fn87" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref87"><sup>87</sup></a><a href="#fn88" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref88"><sup>88</sup></a> but further analysis suggested that they may have been following simple <a href="operant_conditioning" title="wikilink">operant conditioning</a> principles,<a href="#fn89" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref89"><sup>89</sup></a> or a behavioral economic model.<a href="#fn90" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref90"><sup>90</sup></a></p>
<h4 id="mirror-neurons">Mirror neurons</h4>
<p><a href="Mirror_neuron" title="wikilink">Mirror neurons</a> are <a href="neuron" title="wikilink">neurons</a> that <a href="action_potential" title="wikilink">fire</a> both when an animal acts and when the animal observes the same action performed by another.<a href="#fn91" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref91"><sup>91</sup></a><a href="#fn92" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref92"><sup>92</sup></a><a href="#fn93" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref93"><sup>93</sup></a> Thus, the neuron &quot;mirrors&quot; the behavior of the other, as though the observer were itself acting. Such neurons have been directly observed in <a href="primate" class="uri" title="wikilink">primate</a> and other species including <a href="birds" class="uri" title="wikilink">birds</a>. The function of the mirror system is a subject of much speculation. Many researchers in cognitive neuroscience and cognitive psychology consider that this system provides the physiological mechanism for the perception action coupling (see the <a href="common_coding_theory" title="wikilink">common coding theory</a>).<a href="#fn94" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref94"><sup>94</sup></a> They argue that mirror neurons may be important for understanding the actions of other people, and for learning new skills by imitation. Some researchers also speculate that mirror systems may simulate observed actions, and thus contribute to <a href="theory_of_mind" title="wikilink">theory of mind</a> skills,<a href="#fn95" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref95"><sup>95</sup></a><a href="#fn96" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref96"><sup>96</sup></a> while others relate mirror neurons to <a href="language" class="uri" title="wikilink">language</a> abilities.<a href="#fn97" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref97"><sup>97</sup></a> Neuroscientists such as Marco Iacoboni (UCLA) have argued that mirror neuron systems in the human brain help us understand the actions and intentions of other people. In a study published in March 2005 Iacoboni and his colleagues reported that mirror neurons could discern if another person who was picking up a cup of tea planned to drink from it or clear it from the table. In addition, Iacoboni and a number of other researchers have argued that mirror neurons are the neural basis of the human capacity for emotions such as <a href="empathy" class="uri" title="wikilink">empathy</a>.<a href="#fn98" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref98"><sup>98</sup></a><a href="#fn99" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref99"><sup>99</sup></a> V.S Ramachandran has speculated that mirror neurons may provide the neurological basis of self-awareness.<a href="#fn100" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref100"><sup>100</sup></a><a href="#fn101" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref101"><sup>101</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="evolutionary-psychology">Evolutionary psychology</h3>

<p>Consciousness is likely an evolved <a href="adaptation" class="uri" title="wikilink">adaptation</a> since it meets <a href="George_C._Williams" title="wikilink">George Williams</a>' criteria of species universality, complexity,<a href="#fn102" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref102"><sup>102</sup></a> and functionality, and it is a <a href="Phenotypic_trait" title="wikilink">trait</a> that apparently increases <a href="Fitness_(biology)" title="wikilink">fitness</a>.<a href="#fn103" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref103"><sup>103</sup></a></p>
<p>In his paper &quot;Evolution of consciousness,&quot; John Eccles argues that special anatomical and physical adaptations of the mammalian <a href="cerebral_cortex" title="wikilink">cerebral cortex</a> gave rise to consciousness.<a href="#fn104" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref104"><sup>104</sup></a> In contrast, others have argued that the recursive circuitry underwriting consciousness is much more primitive, having evolved initially in pre-mammalian species because it improves the capacity for interaction with both social <em>and</em> natural environments by providing an energy-saving &quot;neutral&quot; gear in an otherwise energy-expensive motor output machine.<a href="#fn105" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref105"><sup>105</sup></a> Once in place, this recursive circuitry may well have provided a basis for the subsequent development of many of the functions that consciousness facilitates in higher organisms, as outlined by Bernard J. Baars.<a href="#fn106" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref106"><sup>106</sup></a> Richard Dawkins suggested that humans evolved consciousness in order to make themselves the subjects of thought.<a href="#fn107" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref107"><sup>107</sup></a> Daniel Povinelli suggests that large, tree-climbing apes evolved consciousness to take into account one's own mass when moving safely among tree branches.<a href="#fn108" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref108"><sup>108</sup></a> Consistent with this hypothesis, Gordon Gallup found that chimps and orangutans, but not little monkeys or terrestrial gorillas, demonstrated self-awareness in mirror tests.<a href="#fn109" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref109"><sup>109</sup></a></p>
<p>The concept of consciousness can refer to voluntary action, awareness, or wakefulness. However, even voluntary behavior involves unconscious mechanisms. Many cognitive processes take place in the cognitive unconscious, unavailable to conscious awareness. Some behaviors are conscious when learned but then become unconscious, seemingly automatic. Learning, especially implicitly learning a skill, can take place outside of consciousness. For example, plenty of people know how to turn right when they ride a bike, but very few can accurately explain how they actually do so.</p>
<h3 id="neural-darwinism">Neural Darwinism</h3>

<p>The American biologist <a href="Gerald_Edelman" title="wikilink">Gerald Edelman</a> distinguishes between primary and secondary consciousness:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="Primary_consciousness" title="wikilink">Primary consciousness</a>: is the ability, found in humans and some animals, to integrate observed events with memory to create an <a href="awareness" class="uri" title="wikilink">awareness</a> of the present and immediate past of the world around them. This form of consciousness is also sometimes called &quot;sensory consciousness&quot;. Put another way, primary consciousness is the presence of various <a href="subjectivity" title="wikilink">subjective</a> sensory contents of consciousness such as <a href="sensation_(psychology)" title="wikilink">sensations</a>, <a href="perception" title="wikilink">perceptions</a>, and mental images. For example, primary consciousness includes a person's experience of the blueness of the ocean, a bird's song, and the feeling of pain. Thus, primary consciousness refers to being mentally aware of things in the world in the present without any sense of past and future; it is composed of mental images bound to a time around the measurable present.<a href="#fn110" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref110"><sup>110</sup></a></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><a href="Secondary_consciousness" title="wikilink">Secondary consciousness</a>: is an individual's accessibility to their history and plans. The concept is also loosely and commonly associated with having awareness of one's own <a href="consciousness" class="uri" title="wikilink">consciousness</a>. The ability allows its possessors to go beyond the limits of the remembered present of <a href="primary_consciousness" title="wikilink">primary consciousness</a>. The term was also coined by <a href="Gerald_Edelman" title="wikilink">Gerald Edelman</a>.<a href="#fn111" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref111"><sup>111</sup></a></li>
</ul>
<p>Primary consciousness can be defined as simple awareness that includes <a href="perception" class="uri" title="wikilink">perception</a> and <a href="emotion" class="uri" title="wikilink">emotion</a>. As such, it is ascribed to most animals. By contrast, secondary consciousness depends on and includes such features as self-reflective awareness, <a href="abstract_thinking" title="wikilink">abstract thinking</a>, <a href="Volition_(psychology)" title="wikilink">volition</a> and <a href="metacognition" class="uri" title="wikilink">metacognition</a>.<a href="#fn112" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref112"><sup>112</sup></a><a href="#fn113" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref113"><sup>113</sup></a></p>
<p>Edelman's theory focuses on two <a href="nervous_system" title="wikilink">nervous system</a> organizations: the <a href="brainstem" class="uri" title="wikilink">brainstem</a> and <a href="limbic_system" title="wikilink">limbic systems</a> on one side and the <a href="thalamus" class="uri" title="wikilink">thalamus</a> and <a href="cerebral_cortex" title="wikilink">cerebral cortex</a> on the other side. The brain stem and limbic system take care of essential body functioning and survival, while the thalamocortical system receives signals from sensory receptors and sends out signals to voluntary muscles such as those of the arms and legs. The theory asserts that the connection of these two systems during evolution helped animals learn <a href="adaptive_behavior" title="wikilink">adaptive behaviors</a>.<a href="#fn114" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref114"><sup>114</sup></a></p>
<p>Other scientists have argued against Edelman's theory, instead suggesting that primary consciousness might have emerged with the basic vegetative systems of the brain. That is, the evolutionary origin might have come from sensations and primal emotions arising from <a href="sensory_neuron" title="wikilink">sensors</a> and <a href="sensory_receptors" title="wikilink">receptors</a>, both internal and surface, signaling that the well-being of the creature was immediately threatened&lt;U+2014&gt;for example, hunger for air, thirst, hunger, pain, and extreme temperature change. This is based on neurological data showing the <a href="thalamus" title="wikilink">thalamic</a>, <a href="hippocampus" title="wikilink">hippocampal</a>, <a href="orbitofrontal_cortex" title="wikilink">orbitofrontal</a>, <a href="insular_cortex" title="wikilink">insula</a>, and <a href="midbrain" class="uri" title="wikilink">midbrain</a> sites are the key to consciousness of thirst.<a href="#fn115" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref115"><sup>115</sup></a> These scientists also point out that the cortex might not be as important to primary consciousness as some neuroscientists have believed.<a href="#fn116" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref116"><sup>116</sup></a> Evidence of this lies in the fact that studies show that systematically disabling parts of the cortex in animals does not remove consciousness. Another study found that children born without a cortex are conscious. Instead of cortical mechanisms, these scientists emphasize brainstem mechanisms as essential to consciousness.<a href="#fn117" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref117"><sup>117</sup></a> Still, these scientists concede that higher order consciousness does involve the cortex and complex communication between different areas of the brain.</p>
<p>While animals with <a href="primary_consciousness" title="wikilink">primary consciousness</a> have long-term memory, they lack explicit narrative, and, at best, can only deal with the immediate scene in the remembered present. While they still have an advantage over animals lacking such ability, evolution has brought forth a growing complexity in consciousness, particularly in mammals. Animals with this complexity are said to have secondary consciousness. Secondary consciousness is seen in animals with <a href="semantic" class="uri" title="wikilink">semantic</a> capabilities, such as the four <a href="great_apes" title="wikilink">great apes</a>. It is present in its richest form in the human species, which is unique in possessing complex <a href="language" class="uri" title="wikilink">language</a> made up of <a href="syntax" class="uri" title="wikilink">syntax</a> and semantics. In considering how the neural mechanisms underlying primary consciousness arose and were maintained during evolution, it is proposed that at some time around the divergence of <a href="reptiles" class="uri" title="wikilink">reptiles</a> into mammals and then into <a href="birds" class="uri" title="wikilink">birds</a>, the <a href="embryological" class="uri" title="wikilink">embryological</a> development of large numbers of new reciprocal connections allowed rich <a href="Reentry_(neural_circuitry)" title="wikilink">re-entrant</a> activity to take place between the more posterior brain systems carrying out perceptual categorization and the more frontally located systems responsible for value-category memory.<a href="#fn118" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref118"><sup>118</sup></a> The ability of an animal to relate a present complex scene to its own previous history of learning conferred an adaptive evolutionary advantage. At much later evolutionary epochs, further re-entrant circuits appeared that linked semantic and linguistic performance to categorical and conceptual <a href="memory" class="uri" title="wikilink">memory</a> systems. This development enabled the emergence of secondary consciousness.<a href="#fn119" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref119"><sup>119</sup></a><a href="#fn120" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref120"><sup>120</sup></a></p>
<p>Ursula Voss of the <a href="Universit&lt;U+00E4&gt;t_Bonn" title="wikilink">Universit&lt;U+00E4&gt;t Bonn</a> believes that the theory of <a href="protoconsciousness" class="uri" title="wikilink">protoconsciousness</a><a href="#fn121" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref121"><sup>121</sup></a> may serve as adequate explanation for self-recognition found in birds, as they would develop secondary consciousness during REM sleep.<a href="#fn122" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref122"><sup>122</sup></a> She added that many types of birds have very sophisticated language systems. Don Kuiken of the University of Alberta finds such research interesting as well as if we continue to study consciousness with animal models (with differing types of consciousness), we would be able to separate the different forms of reflectiveness found in today&lt;U+2019&gt;s world.<a href="#fn123" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref123"><sup>123</sup></a></p>
<p>For the advocates of the idea of a secondary consciousness, <a href="self-recognition" class="uri" title="wikilink">self-recognition</a> serves as a critical component and a key defining measure. What is most interesting then, is the evolutionary appeal that arises with the concept of self-recognition. In non-human species and in children, the <a href="mirror_test" title="wikilink">mirror test</a> (see above) has been used as an indicator of <a href="self-awareness" class="uri" title="wikilink">self-awareness</a>.</p>
<h2 id="cambridge-declaration-on-consciousness">Cambridge Declaration on Consciousness</h2>

<p>In 2012, group of neuroscientists attending a conference on &quot;Consciousness in Human and non-Human Animals&quot; at Cambridge University in the UK, signed <em>The Cambridge Declaration on Consciousness</em> (see box on the right).<a href="#fn124" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref124"><sup>124</sup></a><a href="#fn125" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref125"><sup>125</sup></a></p>

<p>:* &quot;The field of Consciousness research is rapidly evolving. Abundant new techniques and strategies for human and non-human animal research have been developed. Consequently, more data is becoming readily available, and this calls for a periodic reevaluation of previously held preconceptions in this field. Studies of non-human animals have shown that <a href="homology_(biology)" title="wikilink">homologous</a> brain circuits correlated with conscious experience and perception can be selectively facilitated and disrupted to assess whether they are in fact necessary for those experiences. Moreover, in humans, new non-invasive techniques are readily available to survey the <a href="Neural_correlates_of_consciousness" title="wikilink">correlates of consciousness</a>.&quot;<a href="#fn127" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref127"><sup>127</sup></a></p>
<p>:* &quot;The <a href="neural_substrate" title="wikilink">neural substrates</a> of emotions do not appear to be confined to cortical structures. In fact, <a href="subcortical" class="uri" title="wikilink">subcortical</a> neural networks aroused during affective states in humans are also critically important for generating emotional behaviors in animals. Artificial arousal of the same brain regions generates corresponding behavior and feeling states in both humans and non-human animals. Wherever in the brain one evokes instinctual emotional behaviors in non-human animals, many of the ensuing behaviors are consistent with experienced feeling states, including those internal states that are rewarding and punishing. Deep brain stimulation of these systems in humans can also generate similar affective states. Systems associated with affect are concentrated in subcortical regions where neural <a href="Homology_(biology)" title="wikilink">homologies</a> abound. Young human and non-human animals without neocortices retain these brain-mind functions. Furthermore, <a href="neural_circuit" title="wikilink">neural circuits</a> supporting behavioral/electrophysiological states of attentiveness, sleep and decision making appear to have arisen in evolution as early as the invertebrate radiation, being evident in insects and cephalopod mollusks (e.g., octopus).&quot;<a href="#fn128" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref128"><sup>128</sup></a></p>
<p>:* &quot;Birds appear to offer, in their behavior, neurophysiology, and neuroanatomy a striking case of <a href="parallel_evolution" title="wikilink">parallel evolution</a> of consciousness. Evidence of near human-like levels of consciousness has been most dramatically observed in <a href="African_grey_parrot" title="wikilink">African grey parrots</a>. Mammalian and avian emotional networks and cognitive microcircuitries appear to be far more homologous than previously thought. Moreover, certain species of birds have been found to exhibit neural <a href="sleep_pattern" title="wikilink">sleep patterns</a> similar to those of mammals, including REM sleep and, as was demonstrated in <a href="zebra_finch" title="wikilink">zebra finches</a>, neurophysiological patterns, previously thought to require a mammalian neocortex. <a href="Magpie" title="wikilink">Magpies</a> in particular have been shown to exhibit striking similarities to humans, great apes, dolphins, and elephants in studies of <a href="Mirror_test" title="wikilink">mirror self-recognition</a>.&quot;<a href="#fn129" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref129"><sup>129</sup></a></p>
<p>:* &quot;In humans, the effect of certain <a href="hallucinogen" title="wikilink">hallucinogens</a> appears to be associated with a disruption in cortical <a href="Feedforward,_Behavioral_and_Cognitive_Science" title="wikilink">feedforward</a> and feedback processing. Pharmacological interventions in non-human animals with compounds known to affect conscious behavior in humans can lead to similar perturbations in behavior in non-human animals. In humans, there is evidence to suggest that awareness is correlated with cortical activity, which does not exclude possible contributions by subcortical or early cortical processing, as in visual awareness. Evidence that human and non-human animal emotional feelings arise from homologous subcortical brain networks provide compelling evidence for evolutionarily shared primal affective qualia.&quot;<a href="#fn130" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref130"><sup>130</sup></a></p>

In another example, one bird stood on a perch to release a food-laden tray, while the other pulled the tray out from the test apparatus. Both would then feed. The birds in question were observed waiting for their partners to perform the necessary actions so their behaviour could be synchronized.

<p>It was recently thought that self-recognition was restricted to mammals with large brains and highly evolved social cognition but absent from animals without a <a href="neocortex" class="uri" title="wikilink">neocortex</a>. However, in a recent study, an investigation of self-recognition in <a href="corvids" class="uri" title="wikilink">corvids</a> was carried out, and significant result quantified the ability of self-recognition in the magpie. Mammals and birds inherited the same brain components from their last common <a href="ancestor" class="uri" title="wikilink">ancestor</a> nearly 300 million years ago, and have since independently evolved and formed significantly different brain types. The results of the mirror and mark tests showed that neocortex-less <a href="magpies" class="uri" title="wikilink">magpies</a> are capable of understanding that a mirror image belongs to their own body. The findings show that magpies respond in the mirror and mark test in a manner similar to apes, dolphins and elephants. This is a remarkable capability that, although not fully concrete in its determination of self-recognition, is at least a prerequisite of self-recognition. This is not only of interest regarding the convergent evolution of social intelligence; it is also valuable for an understanding of the general principles that govern cognitive evolution and their underlying neural mechanisms. The magpies were chosen to study based on their empathy/ lifestyle, a possible precursor for their ability of self-awareness.<a href="#fn138" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref138"><sup>138</sup></a></p>
