<p><strong>Sir Arthur John Gielgud</strong>, <a href="Order_of_Merit" title="wikilink">OM</a>, <a href="Companion_of_Honour" title="wikilink">CH</a> (; 14 April 1904 &lt;U+2013&gt; 21 May 2000), was an English actor and theatre director whose career spanned eight decades. With <a href="Ralph_Richardson" title="wikilink">Ralph Richardson</a> and <a href="Laurence_Olivier" title="wikilink">Laurence Olivier</a>, he was one of the trinity of actors who dominated the British stage for much of the 20th century. A member of the <a href="Terry_family" title="wikilink">Terry family</a> theatrical dynasty, he gained his first paid acting work as a junior member of his cousin <a href="Phyllis_Neilson-Terry" title="wikilink">Phyllis Neilson-Terry</a>'s company in 1922. After studying at the <a href="Royal_Academy_of_Dramatic_Art" title="wikilink">Royal Academy of Dramatic Art</a> he worked in <a href="repertory_theatre" title="wikilink">repertory theatre</a> and in the <a href="West_End_theatre" title="wikilink">West End</a> before establishing himself at the <a href="Old_Vic" title="wikilink">Old Vic</a> as an exponent of <a href="William_Shakespeare" title="wikilink">Shakespeare</a> in 1929&lt;U+2013&gt;31.</p>
<p>During the 1930s Gielgud was a stage star in the West End and on <a href="Broadway_theatre" title="wikilink">Broadway</a>, appearing in new works and classics. He began a parallel career as a director, and set up his own company at the <a href="Queen&#39;s_Theatre" title="wikilink">Queen's Theatre</a>, London. He was regarded by many as the finest <a href="Prince_Hamlet" title="wikilink">Hamlet</a> of his era, and was also known for high comedy roles such as John Worthing in <em><a href="The_Importance_of_Being_Earnest" title="wikilink">The Importance of Being Earnest</a></em>. In the 1950s Gielgud feared that his career was threatened when he was convicted and fined for a homosexual offence, but his colleagues and the public supported him loyally. When <em></em> plays began to supersede traditional West End productions in the later 1950s he found no new suitable stage roles, and for several years he was best known in the theatre for his one-man Shakespeare show, <em>The Ages of Man</em>. From the late 1960s he found new plays that suited him, by authors including <a href="Alan_Bennett" title="wikilink">Alan Bennett</a>, <a href="David_Storey" title="wikilink">David Storey</a> and <a href="Harold_Pinter" title="wikilink">Harold Pinter</a>.</p>
<p>During the first half of his career Gielgud did not take the cinema seriously. Though he made his first film in 1924, and had successes with <em><a href="The_Good_Companions_(1933_film)" title="wikilink">The Good Companions</a></em> (1933) and <em><a href="Julius_Caesar_(1953_film)" title="wikilink">Julius Caesar</a></em> (1953), he did not begin a regular film career until his sixties. Between <em><a href="Becket_(1964_film)" title="wikilink">Becket</a></em> in 1964, for which he received an <a href="Academy_Awards" title="wikilink">Oscar</a> nomination, and <em><a href="Elizabeth_(film)" title="wikilink">Elizabeth</a></em> in 1998 he appeared in more than sixty films. As the acid-tongued Hobson in <em><a href="Arthur_(1981_film)" title="wikilink">Arthur</a></em> (1981) he won an <a href="Academy_Award_for_Best_Supporting_Actor" title="wikilink">Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor</a>.</p>
<p>Although largely indifferent to awards, Gielgud had the rare distinction of winning an <a href="List_of_people_who_have_won_Academy,_Emmy,_Grammy,_and_Tony_Awards" title="wikilink">Oscar, Emmy, Grammy, and a Tony</a>. He was famous from the start of his career for his voice and his mastery of Shakespearean verse. He broadcast more than a hundred radio and television dramas, between 1929 and 1994, and made commercial recordings of many plays, including ten of Shakespeare's. Among his honours, he was <a href="Knight_Bachelor" title="wikilink">knighted</a> in 1953 and the <a href="Gielgud_Theatre" title="wikilink">Gielgud Theatre</a> was named after him. From 1977 to 1989, he was president of the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art.</p>

<p>In 1912, aged eight, Gielgud went to Hillside <a href="Preparatory_school_(United_Kingdom)" title="wikilink">preparatory school</a> in <a href="Surrey" class="uri" title="wikilink">Surrey</a> as his elder brothers had done. For a child with no interest in sport he acquitted himself reasonably well in <a href="cricket" class="uri" title="wikilink">cricket</a> and <a href="Rugby_football" title="wikilink">rugby</a> for the school.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> In class, he hated mathematics, was fair at <a href="classics" class="uri" title="wikilink">classics</a>, and excelled at English and divinity.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> Hillside encouraged his interest in drama, and he played several leading roles in school productions, including Mark Antony in <em><a href="Julius_Caesar_(play)" title="wikilink">Julius Caesar</a></em> and <a href="Shylock" class="uri" title="wikilink">Shylock</a> in <em><a href="The_Merchant_of_Venice" title="wikilink">The Merchant of Venice</a></em>.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<p>After Hillside, Lewis had won a scholarship to <a href="Eton_College" title="wikilink">Eton</a>, and Val had done likewise to <a href="Rugby_School" title="wikilink">Rugby</a>, but John, lacking their academic achievement, did not follow them.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> He was sent as a <a href="day_pupil" title="wikilink">day boy</a> to <a href="Westminster_School" title="wikilink">Westminster School</a>,{{#tag:ref|He was briefly a <a href="Boarding_school" title="wikilink">boarder</a>, but he persuaded his parents to let him live at home, which was only three miles (4.8 kilometres) from the school.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a>|group= n}} where, as he later said, he had access to the <a href="West_End_theatre" title="wikilink">West End</a> &quot;in time to touch the fringe of the great century of the theatre.&quot;<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> He saw <a href="Sarah_Bernhardt" title="wikilink">Sarah Bernhardt</a> act, <a href="Adeline_Gen&lt;U+00E9&gt;e" title="wikilink">Adeline Gen&lt;U+00E9&gt;e</a> dance and <a href="Albert_Chevalier" title="wikilink">Albert Chevalier</a>, <a href="Vesta_Tilley" title="wikilink">Vesta Tilley</a> and <a href="Marie_Lloyd" title="wikilink">Marie Lloyd</a> perform in the music halls.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> The school choir sang in services at <a href="Westminster_Abbey" title="wikilink">Westminster Abbey</a>, which appealed to his fondness for ritual.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> He showed talent at sketching, and for a while thought of scenic design as a possible career.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
<p>The young Gielgud's father took him to concerts, which he liked, and galleries and museums, &quot;which bored me rigid.&quot;<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> Both parents were keen theatregoers, but did not encourage their children to follow an acting career. Val Gielgud recalled, &quot;Our parents looked distinctly sideways at the Stage as a means of livelihood, and when John showed some talent for drawing his father spoke crisply of the advantages of an architect's office.&quot;<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> On leaving Westminster in 1921, Gielgud persuaded his reluctant parents to let him take drama lessons on the understanding that if he was not self-supporting by the age of twenty-five he would seek an office post.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="first-acting-experience">First acting experience</h3>

<p>Gielgud, aged seventeen, joined a private drama school run by Constance Benson, wife of the <a href="actor-manager" class="uri" title="wikilink">actor-manager</a> <a href="Frank_Benson_(actor)" title="wikilink">Sir Frank Benson</a>.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> On the new boy's first day Lady Benson remarked on his physical awkwardness: &quot;she said I walked like a cat with <a href="rickets" class="uri" title="wikilink">rickets</a>. It dealt a severe blow to my conceit, which was a good thing.&quot;<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> Before and after joining the school he played in several amateur productions,<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> and in November 1921 made his debut with a professional company, though he himself was not paid. He played the Herald in <em><a href="Henry_V_(play)" title="wikilink">Henry V</a></em> at the <a href="Old_Vic" title="wikilink">Old Vic</a>; he had one line to speak and, he recalled, spoke it badly.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> He was kept on for the rest of the season in walk-on parts in <em><a href="King_Lear" title="wikilink">King Lear</a></em>, <em>Wat Tyler</em> and <em><a href="Peer_Gynt" title="wikilink">Peer Gynt</a></em>, with no lines.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a></p>

<p>Gielgud's first substantial engagement came through his family. In 1922 his cousin <a href="Phyllis_Neilson-Terry" title="wikilink">Phyllis Neilson-Terry</a>{{#tag:ref|Phyllis Neilson-Terry was Gielgud's first cousin once removed, being a first cousin of his mother.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a>|group= n}} invited him to tour in <a href="J.&amp;nbsp;B._Fagan" title="wikilink">J.&amp;nbsp;B. Fagan</a>'s <em>The Wheel</em>, as understudy, bit-part player and assistant stage manager, an invitation he accepted.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> A colleague, recognising that the young man had talent but lacked technique, recommended him to the <a href="Royal_Academy_of_Dramatic_Art" title="wikilink">Royal Academy of Dramatic Art</a> (RADA). Gielgud was awarded a scholarship to the academy and trained there throughout 1923 under <a href="Kenneth_Barnes" title="wikilink">Kenneth Barnes</a>, <a href="Helen_Haye" title="wikilink">Helen Haye</a> and <a href="Claude_Rains" title="wikilink">Claude Rains</a>.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a></p>
<p>The actor-manager <a href="Nigel_Playfair" title="wikilink">Nigel Playfair</a>, a friend of Gielgud's family, saw him in a student presentation of <a href="J.&amp;nbsp;M._Barrie" title="wikilink">J.&amp;nbsp;M. Barrie</a>'s <em><a href="The_Admirable_Crichton" title="wikilink">The Admirable Crichton</a></em>. Playfair was impressed and cast him as Felix, the poet-butterfly, in the British premiere of the &lt;U+010C&gt;apek brothers' <em><a href="Pictures_from_the_Insects&#39;_Life" title="wikilink">The Insect Play</a></em>. Gielgud later said that he made a poor impression in the part: &quot;I am surprised that the audience did not throw things at me.&quot;<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> The critics were cautious but not hostile to the play;<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> it did not attract the public and closed after a month.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> While still continuing his studies at RADA, Gielgud appeared again for Playfair in <em>RobertE Lee</em> by <a href="John_Drinkwater_(playwright)" title="wikilink">John Drinkwater</a>.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> After leaving the academy at the end of 1923 Gielgud played a Christmas season as Charley in <em><a href="Charley&#39;s_Aunt" title="wikilink">Charley's Aunt</a></em> in the West End, and then joined Fagan's <a href="Repertory_theatre" title="wikilink">repertory</a> company at the <a href="Oxford_Playhouse" title="wikilink">Oxford Playhouse</a>.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a></p>
<p>Gielgud was in the Oxford company in January and February 1924, from October 1924 to the end of January 1925, and in August 1925.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> He played a wide range of parts in classics and modern plays, greatly increasing his technical abilities in the process.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> The role he most enjoyed was Trofimov in <em><a href="The_Cherry_Orchard" title="wikilink">The Cherry Orchard</a></em>, his first experience of <a href="Anton_Chekhov" title="wikilink">Chekhov</a>: &quot;It was the first time I ever went out on stage feeling that perhaps, after all, I could really be an actor.&quot;<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="early-west-end-roles">Early West End roles</h3>

<p>Between Gielgud's first two Oxford seasons, the producer <a href="Barry_Jackson_(director)" title="wikilink">Barry Jackson</a> cast him as <a href="Romeo" class="uri" title="wikilink">Romeo</a> to the <a href="Juliet" class="uri" title="wikilink">Juliet</a> of <a href="Gwen_Ffrangcon-Davies" title="wikilink">Gwen Ffrangcon-Davies</a> at the Regent's Theatre, London, in May 1924. The production was not a great success, but the two performers became close friends and frequently worked together throughout their careers.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> Gielgud made his screen debut during 1924 as Daniel Arnault in <a href="Walter_Summers" title="wikilink">Walter Summers</a>'s silent film <em><a href="Who_Is_the_Man?" title="wikilink">Who Is the Man?</a></em> (1924).<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a></p>
<p><img src="Lilian_Braithwaite_&amp;_No&lt;U+00EB&gt;l_Coward.jpg" title="fig:No&lt;U+00EB&gt;l Coward with Lilian Braithwaite, his, and later Gielgud&#39;s, co-star in The Vortex" alt="No&lt;U+00EB&gt;l Coward with Lilian Braithwaite, his, and later Gielgud&#39;s, co-star in The Vortex" /> In May 1925 the Oxford production of <em>The Cherry Orchard</em> was brought to the <a href="Lyric_Theatre,_Hammersmith" title="wikilink">Lyric Theatre, Hammersmith</a>. Gielgud again played Trofimov.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> His distinctive speaking voice attracted attention and led to work for <a href="BBC_radio" title="wikilink">BBC radio</a>, which his biographer <a href="Sheridan_Morley" title="wikilink">Sheridan Morley</a> calls &quot;a medium he made his own for seventy years.&quot;<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> In the same year <a href="No&lt;U+00EB&gt;l_Coward" title="wikilink">No&lt;U+00EB&gt;l Coward</a> chose Gielgud as his understudy in his play <em><a href="The_Vortex" title="wikilink">The Vortex</a></em>. For the last month of the West End run Gielgud took over Coward's role of Nicky Lancaster, the drug-addicted son of a nymphomaniac mother. It was in Gielgud's words &quot;a highly-strung, nervous, hysterical part which depended a lot upon emotion.&quot;<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> He found it tiring to play because he had not yet learned how to pace himself, but he thought it &quot;a thrilling engagement because it led to so many great things afterwards.&quot;<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a></p>
<p>The success of <em>The Cherry Orchard</em> led to what one critic called a &quot;Chekhov boom&quot; in British theatres, and Gielgud was among its leading players.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> As Konstantin in <em><a href="The_Seagull" title="wikilink">The Seagull</a></em> in October 1925 he impressed the Russian director <a href="Theodore_Komisarjevsky" title="wikilink">Theodore Komisarjevsky</a>, who cast him as Tusenbach in the British premiere of <em><a href="Three_Sisters_(play)" title="wikilink">Three Sisters</a></em>. The production received enthusiastic reviews, and Gielgud's highly praised performance enhanced his reputation as a potential star.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a> There followed three years of mixed fortunes for him, with successes in fringe productions, but West End stardom was elusive.<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1926 the producer <a href="Basil_Dean" title="wikilink">Basil Dean</a> offered Gielgud the lead role, Lewis Dodd, in a dramatisation of <a href="Margaret_Kennedy" title="wikilink">Margaret Kennedy</a>'s best-selling novel, <em><a href="The_Constant_Nymph_(novel)" title="wikilink">The Constant Nymph</a></em>. Before rehearsals began Dean found that a bigger star than Gielgud was available, namely Coward, to whom he gave the part. Gielgud had an enforceable contractual claim to the role, but Dean, a notorious bully, was a powerful force in British theatre.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a><a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a> Intimidated, Gielgud accepted the position of understudy, with a guarantee that he would take over the lead from Coward when the latter, who disliked playing in long runs, left.<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a> In the event Coward, who had been overworking, suffered a nervous collapse three weeks after the opening night, and Gielgud played the lead for the rest of the run. The play ran for nearly a year in London and then went on tour.<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a> <img src="Mrs-Patrick-Campbell-and-EdithEvans.jpg" title="fig:Mrs Patrick Campbell and Edith Evans, 1920s co-stars with Gielgud" alt="Mrs Patrick Campbell and Edith Evans, 1920s co-stars with Gielgud" /> By this time Gielgud was earning enough to leave the family home and take a small flat in the West End. He had his first serious romantic relationship, living with John Perry, an unsuccessful actor, later a writer, who remained a lifelong friend after their affair ended. Morley makes the point that, like Coward, Gielgud's principal passion was the stage; both men had casual dalliances, but were more comfortable with &quot;low-maintenance&quot; long-term partners who did not impede their theatrical work and ambitions.<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a></p>

This was regarded as a radical innovation; extensive cuts had been customary for earlier productions. A running time of nearly five hours did not dampen the enthusiasm of the public, the critics or the acting profession. <a href="Sybil_Thorndyke" title="wikilink">Sybil Thorndyke</a> said, &quot;I never hoped to see Hamlet played as in one's dreams ...

After the run at the Queen's finished he turned to another part for which he became well known, John Worthing in <em><a href="The_Importance_of_Being_Earnest" title="wikilink">The Importance of Being Earnest</a></em>. Gilegud's biographer <a href="Jonathan_Croall" title="wikilink">Jonathan Croall</a> comments that the two roles illustrated two sides of the actor's personality: on the one hand the romantic and soulful Hamlet, and on the other the witty and superficial Worthing.<a href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a> The formidable Lady Bracknell was played by his aunt, Mabel Terry-Lewis. <em>The Times</em> observed, &quot;Mr Gielgud and Miss Terry-Lewis together are brilliant ... they have the supreme grace of always allowing Wilde to speak in his own voice.&quot;<a href="#fn72" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref72"><sup>72</sup></a></p>

<p>Between seasons of <em>Richard</em>, in 1934 Gielgud returned to <em>Hamlet</em> in London and on tour, directing and playing the title role.

<p>The following year Gielgud staged perhaps his most famous Shakespeare production, a <em>Romeo and Juliet</em> in which he co-starred with Ashcroft and Olivier.

<p>Gielgud invested &lt;U+00A3&gt;5,000, most of his earnings from the American <em>Hamlet</em>; Perry, who had family money, put in the same sum.<a href="#fn118" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref118"><sup>118</sup></a> From September 1937 to April 1938 Gielgud was the tenant of the Queen's Theatre, where he presented a season consisting of <em>Richard II</em>, <em><a href="The_School_for_Scandal" title="wikilink">The School for Scandal</a></em>, <em>Three Sisters</em>, and <em>The Merchant of Venice</em>.<a href="#fn119" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref119"><sup>119</sup></a> His company included <a href="Harry_Andrews" title="wikilink">Harry Andrews</a>, Peggy Ashcroft, <a href="Glen_Byam_Shaw" title="wikilink">Glen Byam Shaw</a>, George Devine, <a href="Michael_Redgrave" title="wikilink">Michael Redgrave</a> and Harcourt Williams, with <a href="Angela_Baddeley" title="wikilink">Angela Baddeley</a> and Gwen Ffrangcon-Davies as guests. His own roles were King Richard, Joseph Surface, Vershinin and Shylock.<a href="#fn120" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref120"><sup>120</sup></a> Gielgud's performances drew superlatives from reviewers and colleagues. Agate considered his Richard II, &quot;probably the best piece of Shakespearean acting on the English stage today.&quot;<a href="#fn121" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref121"><sup>121</sup></a> Olivier said that Gielgud's Joseph Surface was &quot;the best light comedy performance I've ever seen, or ever shall see.&quot;<a href="#fn122" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref122"><sup>122</sup></a></p>
<p>The venture did not lose money, nor did it make much,<a href="#fn123" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref123"><sup>123</sup></a> and in July 1938 Gielgud turned to more conventional West End enterprises, in unconventional circumstances.

<p>At the start of the Second World War Gielgud volunteered for active service, but was told that men of his age, thirty-five, would not be wanted for at least six months. The government quickly came to the view that most actors would do more good performing to entertain the troops and the general public than serving, whether suitable or not, in the armed forces.<a href="#fn127" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref127"><sup>127</sup></a>{{#tag:ref|Among Gielgud's colleagues who managed to join up, Alec Guinness and <a href="Anthony_Quayle" title="wikilink">Anthony Quayle</a> earned distinguished war records, but, more typically in Morley's view, the authorities were very glad to release Richardson and Olivier from the <a href="Fleet_Air_Arm" title="wikilink">Fleet Air Arm</a> to rejoin the theatre.<a href="#fn128" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref128"><sup>128</sup></a> Gielgud told <a href="Jeremy_Paxman" title="wikilink">Jeremy Paxman</a> in 1999 that he had recently discovered that Binkie Beaumont secretly told the authorities that Gielgud was unfit for military service, purely to retain his services for Beaumont's productions.<a href="#fn129" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref129"><sup>129</sup></a>|group= n}}</p>
<p>Gielgud directed Michael Redgrave in a 1940 London production of <em><a href="The_Beggar&#39;s_Opera" title="wikilink">The Beggar's Opera</a></em> for the <a href="Glyndebourne_Festival_Opera" title="wikilink">Glyndebourne Festival</a>. This was a chaotic affair: Gielgud's direction confused his star, and when Redgrave lost his voice Gielgud had to step in and sing the role as best he could. Gielgud felt that something serious or even solemn was necessary for wartime London, where most entertainment was light-hearted. Together with <a href="Harley_Granville-Barker" title="wikilink">Harley Granville-Barker</a> and Guthrie he reopened the Old Vic with Shakespeare. His King Lear once again divided the critics, but his Prospero was a considerable success. He played the role quite differently from his attempt on the same stage in 1930: in place of the &quot;manic conjurer&quot;<a href="#fn130" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref130"><sup>130</sup></a> his Prospero was &quot;very far from the usual mixture of Father Christmas, a Colonial Bishop, and the President of the Magicians' Union ... a clear, arresting picture of a virile Renaissance notable&quot;, according to Brown.<a href="#fn131" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref131"><sup>131</sup></a> The critics singled out, among the other players, <a href="Jack_Hawkins" title="wikilink">Jack Hawkins</a> as Caliban, <a href="Marius_Goring" title="wikilink">Marius Goring</a> as Ariel, <a href="Jessica_Tandy" title="wikilink">Jessica Tandy</a> as Miranda and Alec Guinness as Ferdinand.<a href="#fn132" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref132"><sup>132</sup></a></p>
<p>Following the example of several of his stage colleagues, Gielgud joined tours of military camps. He gave recitals of prose and poetry, and acted in a triple bill of short plays, including two from Coward's <em><a href="Tonight_at_8:30" title="wikilink">Tonight at 8.30</a></em>, but he found at first that less highbrow performers like <a href="Beatrice_Lillie" title="wikilink">Beatrice Lillie</a> were better than he at entertaining the troops.<a href="#fn133" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref133"><sup>133</sup></a> He returned to filming in 1940, as <a href="Benjamin_Disraeli" title="wikilink">Disraeli</a> in <a href="Thorold_Dickinson" title="wikilink">Thorold Dickinson</a>'s <em><a href="The_Prime_Minister_(film)" title="wikilink">The Prime Minister</a></em>.

<p>Throughout 1941 and 1942 Gielgud worked continually, in Barrie's <em>Dear Brutus</em>, another <em>Importance of Being Earnest</em> in the West End, and <em>Macbeth</em> on tour.<a href="#fn137" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref137"><sup>137</sup></a> Returning, with more assurance than before, to entertaining the troops, he so far departed from his classical style as to join Lillie and <a href="Michael_Wilding_(actor)" title="wikilink">Michael Wilding</a> singing a comic trio.<a href="#fn138" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref138"><sup>138</sup></a> His 1943 revival of <a href="William_Congreve" title="wikilink">William Congreve</a>'s <em><a href="Love_for_Love" title="wikilink">Love for Love</a></em> on tour and then in London received high praise from reviewers.<a href="#fn139" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref139"><sup>139</sup></a> In 1944 he was approached by Ralph Richardson, who had been asked by the governors of the Old Vic to form a new company.

<p>In 1962 Gielgud met Martin Hensler (1932&lt;U+2013&gt;99), an interior designer exiled from Hungary. He was temperamental, and Gielgud's friends often found him difficult, but the two became a long-term couple and lived together until Hensler's death.

The play is set in the gardens of a nursing home for mental patients, though this is not clear at first. The two elderly men converse in a desultory way, are joined and briefly enlivened by two more extrovert female patients, are slightly scared by another male patient, and are then left together, conversing even more emptily. The <em><a href="Punch_(magazine)" title="wikilink">Punch</a></em> critic, Jeremy Kingston, wrote:  The play transferred to the West End and then to Broadway. In <em>The New York Times</em> <a href="Clive_Barnes" title="wikilink">Clive Barnes</a> wrote, &quot;The two men, bleakly examining the little nothingness of their lives, are John Gielgud and Ralph Richardson giving two of the greatest performances of two careers that have been among the glories of the English-speaking theater.&quot;<a href="#fn203" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref203"><sup>203</sup></a> The original cast recorded the play for television in 1972.<a href="#fn204" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref204"><sup>204</sup></a></p>

He was awarded honorary degrees by <a href="University_of_St_Andrews" title="wikilink">St Andrews</a>, <a href="University_of_Oxford" title="wikilink">Oxford</a> and <a href="Brandeis_University" title="wikilink">Brandeis</a> universities.<a href="#fn237" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref237"><sup>237</sup></a></p>
<p>From 1977 to 1989 Gielgud was president of the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art&lt;U+2014&gt;a symbolic position&lt;U+2014&gt;and was the academy's first honorary fellow (1989).<a href="#fn238" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref238"><sup>238</sup></a> In 1996 the Globe Theatre in Shaftesbury Avenue was renamed the <a href="Gielgud_Theatre" title="wikilink">Gielgud Theatre</a>. He had not acted on stage for eight years, and felt out of touch with the West End: he commented on the renaming of the theatre, &quot;At last there is a name in lights on the Avenue which I actually recognise, even if it is my own.&quot;<a href="#fn239" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref239"><sup>239</sup></a></p>
<p>Gielgud was uninterested in religion or politics. As a boy he had been fascinated by the rituals at Westminster Abbey, but his brief attraction to religion quickly faded, and as an adult he was a non-believer.<a href="#fn240" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref240"><sup>240</sup></a> His indifference to politics was illustrated at a formal dinner not long after the Second World War when he asked a fellow guest, &quot;Whereabouts are you living now?&quot;, unaware that, as he was talking to <a href="Clement_Attlee" title="wikilink">Clement Attlee</a>, the answer was &quot;<a href="10_Downing_Street" title="wikilink">10 Downing Street</a>&quot;.<a href="#fn241" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref241"><sup>241</sup></a> In his <em><a href="Who&#39;s_Who_(UK)" title="wikilink">Who's Who</a></em> entry Gielgud listed his hobbies as music and painting, but his concentration on his work, which Emlyn Williams called fanatical, left little scope for leisure activities.<a href="#fn242" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref242"><sup>242</sup></a><a href="#fn243" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref243"><sup>243</sup></a> His dedication to his art was not solemn. The critic <a href="Nicholas_de_Jongh" title="wikilink">Nicholas de Jongh</a> wrote that Gielgud's personality was &quot;such infinite, mischievous fun&quot;,<a href="#fn244" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref244"><sup>244</sup></a> and Coward's biographer Cole Lesley recalled the pleasure of Gielgud's company, &quot;the words tumbling out of his mouth in an avalanche, frequently having to wipe away his own tears of laughter at the funniness of the disasters he recounted, disasters always against himself.&quot;<a href="#fn245" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref245"><sup>245</sup></a></p>
<p>Together with Richardson and Olivier, Gielgud was internationally recognised as one of the &quot;great trinity of theatrical knights&quot;<a href="#fn246" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref246"><sup>246</sup></a> who dominated the British stage for more than fifty years during the middle and later decades of the 20th century.<a href="#fn247" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref247"><sup>247</sup></a><a href="#fn248" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref248"><sup>248</sup></a> The critic <a href="Michael_Coveney" title="wikilink">Michael Coveney</a> wrote, for Gielgud's ninety-fifth birthday: </p>
<p>In an obituary in <em><a href="The_Independent" title="wikilink">The Independent</a></em> Alan Strachan, having discussed Gielgud's work for cinema, radio and television, concluded that &quot;any consideration of Gielgud's rich and often astonishing career must return to the stage; as he wrote at the close of <em>An Actor and his Time</em> (1979), he saw the theatre as 'more than an occupation or a profession; for me it has been a life'.&quot;<a href="#fn249" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref249"><sup>249</sup></a></p>
