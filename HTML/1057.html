<p>Founded by the <a href="Roman_Empire" title="wikilink">Roman</a> Emperor <a href="Vespasian" class="uri" title="wikilink">Vespasian</a> in 72 CE as <em>Flavia Neapolis</em>, Nablus has been ruled by many empires over the course of its almost 2,000-year-long history. In the 5th and 6th centuries, conflict between the city's <a href="Christianity" title="wikilink">Christian</a> and <a href="Samaritan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Samaritan</a> inhabitants climaxed in a series of Samaritan revolts against <a href="Byzantine_Empire" title="wikilink">Byzantine</a> rule, before their violent quelling in 529 CE drastically dwindled that community's numbers in the city. In 636, <em>Neapolis</em>, along with most of <a href="Palestine" class="uri" title="wikilink">Palestine</a>, came under the rule of the <a href="Islam" title="wikilink">Islamic</a> <a href="Rashidun" title="wikilink">Arab Caliphate</a> of <a href="Umar" title="wikilink">Umar ibn al-Khattab</a>; its name <a href="Arabic_language" title="wikilink">Arabicized</a> to <em>Nablus</em>. In 1099, the <a href="Crusade" title="wikilink">Crusaders</a> took control of the city for less than a century, leaving its mixed Muslim, Christian and Samaritan population relatively undisturbed. After <a href="Saladin" class="uri" title="wikilink">Saladin</a>'s <a href="Ayyubid" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ayyubid</a> forces took control of the interior of Palestine in 1187, Islamic rule was reestablished, and continued under the <a href="Mamluk" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mamluk</a> and <a href="Ottoman_Empire" title="wikilink">Ottoman</a> empires to follow.</p>
<p>Following its incorporation into the Ottoman empire in 1517, Nablus was designated capital of the <em>Jabal Nablus</em> (&quot;Mount Nablus&quot;) district. In 1657, after a series of upheavals, a number of <a href="Arab" class="uri" title="wikilink">Arab</a> clans from the northern and eastern <a href="Levant" class="uri" title="wikilink">Levant</a> were dispatched to the city to reassert Ottoman authority, and loyalty from among these clans staved off challenges to the empire's authority by rival regional leaders, like <a href="Daher_el-Omar" title="wikilink">Daher el-Omar</a> in the 18th century, and <a href="Muhammad_Ali_of_Egypt" title="wikilink">Muhammad Ali</a>&lt;U+2014&gt;who briefly ruled Nablus&lt;U+2014&gt;in the 19th century. When Ottoman rule was firmly reestablished in 1841, Nablus prospered as a center of trade.</p>
<p>After the loss of the city to British forces during <a href="World_War_I" title="wikilink">World War I</a>, Nablus was incorporated into the <a href="British_Mandate_of_Palestine" title="wikilink">British Mandate of Palestine</a> in 1922, and later designated to form part of the Arab state of Palestine under the 1947 <a href="United_Nations_Partition_Plan_for_Palestine" title="wikilink">UN partition plan</a>. During the <a href="1948_Arab&lt;U+2013&gt;Israeli_War" title="wikilink">1948 Arab-Israeli War</a>, the city was captured and occupied by <a href="Jordan" title="wikilink">Transjordan</a>, which subsequently unilaterally annexed it, until its <a href="Israeli-occupied_territories" title="wikilink">occupation</a> by <a href="Israel" class="uri" title="wikilink">Israel</a> during the 1967 <a href="Six-Day_War" title="wikilink">Six-Day War</a>.</p>
<p>Today, the population is predominantly <a href="Muslim" class="uri" title="wikilink">Muslim</a>, with small Christian and Samaritan minorities. Since 1995, the city has been governed by the <a href="Palestinian_National_Authority" title="wikilink">Palestinian National Authority</a>. In the Old City, there are a number of sites of archaeological significance, spanning the 1st to 15th centuries. The city is known for its <em><a href="kanafeh" class="uri" title="wikilink">kanafeh</a></em>, a popular sweet throughout the Middle East, and <a href="Nabulsi_soap" title="wikilink">soap</a> industry.</p>

<p>Flavia Neapolis (&quot;new city of the emperor <a href="Flavius" class="uri" title="wikilink">Flavius</a>&quot;) was founded in 72 CE by the <a href="Roman_Empire" title="wikilink">Roman</a> emperor <a href="Vespasian" class="uri" title="wikilink">Vespasian</a> over an older <a href="Samaritan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Samaritan</a> village, <em>Mabartha</em> (&quot;the passage&quot;).<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> Located between <a href="Mount_Ebal" title="wikilink">Mount Ebal</a> and <a href="Mount_Gerizim" title="wikilink">Mount Gerizim</a>, the new city lay  west of the <a href="Bible" title="wikilink">Biblical</a> city of <a href="Shechem" class="uri" title="wikilink">Shechem</a> which was destroyed by the Romans that same year during the <a href="First_Jewish-Roman_War" title="wikilink">First Jewish-Roman War</a>.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a><a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> Holy places at the site of the city's founding include <a href="Joseph&#39;s_Tomb" title="wikilink">Joseph's Tomb</a> and <a href="Jacob&#39;s_Well" title="wikilink">Jacob's Well</a>. Due to the city's strategic geographic position and the abundance of water from nearby springs, Neapolis prospered, accumulating extensive territory, including the former <a href="Judea" title="wikilink">Judean</a> <a href="toparchy" class="uri" title="wikilink">toparchy</a> of <a href="Aqraba" title="wikilink">Acraba</a>.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p>Insofar as the hilly topography of the site would allow, the city was built on a Roman <a href="grid_plan" title="wikilink">grid plan</a> and settled with veterans who fought in the victorious legions and other foreign colonists.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> In the 2nd century CE, Emperor <a href="Hadrian" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hadrian</a> built a grand theater in Neapolis that could seat up to 7,000 people.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> Coins found in Nablus dating to this period depict Roman military emblems and gods and goddesses of the Greek pantheon such as <a href="Zeus" class="uri" title="wikilink">Zeus</a>, <a href="Artemis" class="uri" title="wikilink">Artemis</a>, <a href="Serapis" class="uri" title="wikilink">Serapis</a>, and <a href="Asklepios" class="uri" title="wikilink">Asklepios</a>.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> Neapolis was entirely <a href="Paganism" title="wikilink">pagan</a> at this time.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> <a href="Justin_Martyr" title="wikilink">Justin Martyr</a> who was born in the city c. 100 CE, came into contact with <a href="Platonism" class="uri" title="wikilink">Platonism</a>, but not with Christians there.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> The city flourished until the civil war between <a href="Septimius_Severus" title="wikilink">Septimius Severus</a> and <a href="Pescennius_Niger" title="wikilink">Pescennius Niger</a> in 198&lt;U+2013&gt;9 CE.

<p>In 244 CE, <a href="Philip_the_Arab" title="wikilink">Philip the Arab</a> transformed Flavius Neapolis into a Roman colony named <em>Julia Neapolis</em>. It retained this status until the rule of <a href="Trebonianus_Gallus" title="wikilink">Trebonianus Gallus</a> in 251 CE.

<p>Conflict among the Christian population of Neapolis emerged in 451. By this time, Neapolis was within the <a href="Palaestina_Prima" title="wikilink">Palaestina Prima</a> province under the rule of the <a href="Byzantine_Empire" title="wikilink">Byzantine Empire</a>. The tension was a result of <a href="Monophysitism" title="wikilink">Monophysite</a> Christian attempts to prevent the return of the <a href="Greek_Orthodox_Patriarch_of_Jerusalem" title="wikilink">Patriarch of Jerusalem</a>, <a href="Juvenal_of_Jerusalem" title="wikilink">Juvenal</a>, to his <a href="episcopal_see" title="wikilink">episcopal see</a>.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> However, the conflict did not grow into civil strife.</p>
<p>As tensions among the Christians of Neapolis decreased, tensions between the Christian community and the <a href="Samaritans" class="uri" title="wikilink">Samaritans</a> grew dramatically. In 484, the city became the site of a deadly encounter between the two groups, provoked by rumors that the Christians intended to transfer the remains of <a href="Aaron" class="uri" title="wikilink">Aaron</a>'s sons and grandsons <a href="Eleazar" class="uri" title="wikilink">Eleazar</a>, <a href="Ithamar" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ithamar</a> and <a href="Phinehas" class="uri" title="wikilink">Phinehas</a>. Samaritans reacted by entering the cathedral of Neapolis, killing the Christians inside and severing the fingers of the bishop Terebinthus. Terebinthus then fled to <a href="Constantinople" class="uri" title="wikilink">Constantinople</a>, requesting an army garrison to prevent further attacks. As a result of the revolt, the Byzantine emperor <a href="Zeno_(emperor)" title="wikilink">Zeno</a> erected a church dedicated to <a href="Mary_(mother_of_Jesus)" title="wikilink">Mary</a> on Mount Gerizim. He also forbade the Samaritans to travel to the mountain to celebrate their religious ceremonies, and confiscated their synagogue there. These actions by the emperor fueled Samaritan anger towards the Christians further.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
<p>Thus, the Samaritans rebelled again under the rule of emperor <a href="Anastasius_I_(emperor)" title="wikilink">Anastasius I</a>, reoccupying Mount Gerizim, which was subsequently reconquered by the Byzantine governor of <a href="Edessa,_Mesopotamia" title="wikilink">Edessa</a>, Procopius. A third Samartian revolt which took place under the leadership of <a href="Julianus_ben_Sabar" title="wikilink">Julianus ben Sabar</a> in 529 was perhaps the most violent. Neapolis' bishop <a href="Ammonas" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ammonas</a> was murdered and the city's priests were hacked into pieces and then burned together with the relics of <a href="saint" title="wikilink">saints</a>. The forces of Emperor <a href="Justinian_I" title="wikilink">Justinian I</a> were sent in to quell the revolt, which ended with the slaughter of the majority of the Samaritan population in the city.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a></p>

The Muslim, Eastern Orthodox Christian, and Samaritan populations remained in the city, and were joined by some Crusaders who settled therein to take advantage of the city's abundant resources. In 1120, the Crusaders convened the <a href="Council_of_Nablus" title="wikilink">Council of Nablus</a> out of which was issued the first written laws for the kingdom.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> They converted the Samaritan synagogue in Nablus into a church.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> The Samaritan community built a new synagogue in the 1130s.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a></p>

<p><img src="Nablus_jacob_well_1912.jpg" title="fig:Jacob&#39;s Well, 1912" alt="Jacob&#39;s Well, 1912" /> Nablus came under the rule of the <a href="Ottoman_Empire" title="wikilink">Ottoman Empire</a> in 1517, along with the whole of Palestine. The Ottomans divided Palestine into six <em><a href="sanjak" title="wikilink">sanjaqs</a></em> (&quot;districts&quot;): <a href="Safad" class="uri" title="wikilink">Safad</a>, <a href="Jenin" class="uri" title="wikilink">Jenin</a>, <a href="Jerusalem" class="uri" title="wikilink">Jerusalem</a>, <a href="Gaza_City" title="wikilink">Gaza</a>, <a href="Ajlun" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ajlun</a> and <a href="District_of_Nablus" title="wikilink">Nablus</a>, all of which were part of <a href="Ottoman_Syria" title="wikilink">Ottoman Syria</a>. These five <em>sanjaqs</em> were subdistricts of the <a href="Vilayet_of_Damascus" title="wikilink">Vilayet of Damascus</a>. Sanjaq Nablus was further subdivided into five <em><a href="nahiya" class="uri" title="wikilink">nahiya</a></em> (subdistricts), in addition to the city itself. The Ottomans did not attempt to restructure the political configuration of the region on the local level such that the borders of the <em>nahiya</em> were drawn to coincide with the historic strongholds of certain families. Nablus was only one among a number of local centers of power within Jabal Nablus, and its relations with the surrounding villages, such as <a href="Beita,_Nablus" title="wikilink">Beita</a> and <a href="Aqraba" class="uri" title="wikilink">Aqraba</a>, were partially mediated by the rural-based chiefs of the <em>nahiya</em>.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> During the 16th century, the population was predominantly Muslim, with Jewish, Samaritan and Christian minorities.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a><a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a><a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a></p>
<p>After decades of upheavals and rebellions mounted by Arab tribes in the Middle East, the Ottomans attempted to reassert centralized control over the Arab <em>vilayets</em>. In 1657, they sent an expeditionary force of local Ottoman-aligned Arab families based in various <a href="Syria" title="wikilink">Syrian</a> cities to pacify Nablus. In return for their services, the families were granted agricultural lands around the villages of Jabal Nablus. The Ottomans, fearing that the new Arab land holders would establish independent bases of power, dispersed the land plots to separate and distant locations within Jabal Nablus to avoid clusters of clans. The 1657 campaign succeeded and the Syrian Arab families began to have a foothold in Nablus' affairs. The largest family were the Nimrs, who originated from villages surrounding <a href="Hama" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hama</a> and <a href="Homs" class="uri" title="wikilink">Homs</a>. The other two prominent families were the Jarrars from <a href="Balqa_Governorate" title="wikilink">Balqa</a> and the <a href="Touqan" title="wikilink">Touqans</a> from northern Syria. Eventually gaining the role of <em>nahiya</em> chiefs, they began intermarrying with local merchant and leading religious families. Thus, these new families were integrated into Nablus' population. Under an arrangement in 1723, the Touqans and the Nimrs shared and trade leadership of Nablus, and the Jarrars became the chiefs of the <em>nahiya</em> of Jabal Nablus.<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a></p>

<p>In the mid-18th century, <a href="Daher_el-Omar" title="wikilink">Daher el-Omar</a>, a <a href="Bedouin" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bedouin</a> ruler of the <a href="Galilee" class="uri" title="wikilink">Galilee</a> and Acre become a dominant figure in northern Palestine.

In 1771, during the <a href="Mamluk" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mamluk</a> invasion of Syria, al-Omar aligned himself with the Mamluks and besieged Nablus, but did not succeed in taking the city. In 1773, he tried again without success. Nevertheless, from a political perspective, the sieges led to a decline in the importance of the city in favor of Acre. Al-Omar's successor, <a href="Jezzar_Pasha" title="wikilink">Jezzar Pasha</a>, maintained Acre's dominance over Nablus. After his reign ended in 1804, Nablus regained its autonomy, and the Touqans, who represented a principal opposing force, rose to power.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a></p>

A policy of <a href="conscription" class="uri" title="wikilink">conscription</a> and new <a href="taxation" class="uri" title="wikilink">taxation</a> was instituted which led to a <a href="Peasants&#39;_revolt_of_1834_(Palestine)" title="wikilink">revolt</a> organized by the <em><a href="Palestinian_nationalism#Notables" title="wikilink">a'ayan</a></em> (notables) of Nablus, <a href="Hebron" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hebron</a> and the Jerusalem-Jaffa area. On May 19, 1834, Qasim al-Ahmad&lt;U+2014&gt;the chief of the <a href="Jamma&#39;in" class="uri" title="wikilink">Jamma'in</a> <em>nahiya</em>&lt;U+2014&gt;rallied the <em><a href="fellahin" class="uri" title="wikilink">fellahin</a></em> (peasants) of Jabal Nablus and launched the revolt in protest at Egyptian conscription orders. The leaders of Nablus and its hinterland sent thousands of rebels to attack Jerusalem, the center of government authority in Palestine, aided by the <a href="Abu_Ghosh" title="wikilink">Abu Ghosh</a> clan, and they conquered the city on May 31. However, they were later defeated by Governor <a href="Ibrahim_Pasha_of_Egypt" title="wikilink">Ibrahim Pasha</a>'s forces the next month. Ibrahim then forced the heads of the Nablus clans to leave for nearby villages. By the end of August, the country-wide revolt had been suppressed and al-Ahmad was executed.<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a></p>
<p>The Egyptian occupation of Palestine resulted in the destruction of <a href="Acre,_Israel" title="wikilink">Acre</a> and thus, the political importance of Nablus was further elevated. The Ottomans wrested back control of Palestine from the Khedivate in 1840&lt;U+2013&gt;41. As a result, the <a href="Arraba,_Jenin" title="wikilink">Arraba</a>-based Abd al-Hadi clan rose to prominence. Loyal allies of Jezzar Pasha and the Touqans, they gained the governorship of Jabal Nablus and other <em>sanjaks</em>.<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a></p>
<p>Throughout the 18th and 19th centuries, Nablus was the principal trade and manufacturing center in Ottoman Syria. Its economic activity and regional leadership position surpassed that of <a href="Jerusalem" class="uri" title="wikilink">Jerusalem</a> and the coastal cities of <a href="Jaffa" class="uri" title="wikilink">Jaffa</a> and Acre. <a href="Olive_oil" title="wikilink">Olive oil</a> was the primary product of Nablus and fueled other related industries such as <a href="Nabulsi_soap" title="wikilink">soap-making</a> and basket weaving.<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a> The city also was the top producer of cotton in the <a href="Levant" class="uri" title="wikilink">Levant</a>, topping the production from northern cities such as Damascus.<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a> Jabal Nablus enjoyed a greater degree of <a href="autonomy" class="uri" title="wikilink">autonomy</a> than other <em>sanjaqs</em> under Ottoman control, probably because the city was the capital of a hilly region, in which there were no &quot;foreigners&quot; who held any military or bureaucratic posts.

<p>In the center of Nablus lies the old city, composed of six major quarters: Yasmina, Gharb, Qaryun, Aqaba, Qaysariyya and Habala. Habala is the largest quarter and its population growth led to the development of two smaller neighborhoods: al-Arda and Tal al-Kreim.

<p>The Ottoman government ensured adequate safety and funding for the annual <a href="hajj" title="wikilink">pilgrimage</a> caravan (<em>qafilat al-hajj</em>) from Damascus to the Islamic holy cities of <a href="Mecca" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mecca</a> and <a href="Medina" class="uri" title="wikilink">Medina</a>. This policy benefited Nablus economically. Pilgrimage caravans became the key factor in the fiscal and political relationship between Nablus and the central government. For a brief period in the early 17th century, the governor of Nablus, Farrukh Pasha Ibn Abdullah, was appointed leader of the pilgrimage caravan (<em>amir al-hajj</em>), and he constructued a large commercial compound in Nablus for that purpose.<a href="#fn104" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref104"><sup>104</sup></a></p>

<p><em>Kanafeh</em> is the most famed <em>Nabulsi</em> sweet.

The top layer of the pastry is usually dyed orange with food coloring and sprinkled with crushed pistachios.

<p><img src="Twilight_in_Nablus_154_-_Aug_2011.jpg" title="fig:Nablus, 2011" alt="Nablus, 2011" /> In the early 20th century, Nablus was the southernmost station of a spur from the <a href="Jezreel_Valley_railway" title="wikilink">Jezreel Valley railway</a>'s <a href="Afula" class="uri" title="wikilink">Afula</a> station, itself a spur from the <a href="Hejaz_railway" title="wikilink">Hejaz railway</a>. The extension of the railway to Nablus was built in 1911&lt;U+2013&gt;12.<a href="#fn161" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref161"><sup>161</sup></a> During the beginning of the British Mandate, one weekly train was operated from Haifa to Nablus via Afula and <a href="Jenin" class="uri" title="wikilink">Jenin</a>. The railway was destroyed during the <a href="1948_Arab&lt;U+2013&gt;Israeli_War" title="wikilink">1948 Arab&lt;U+2013&gt;Israeli War</a>, and the route of the line bisected by the <a href="Green_Line_(Israel)" title="wikilink">Green Line</a>.</p>
<p>The main <a href="Highway_60_(Israel)" title="wikilink">Beersheba&lt;U+2013&gt;Nazareth road</a> running through the middle of the West Bank ends in Nablus, although thoroughfare of local Arabs is severely restricted.

From 2000 until 2011, Israel maintained <a href="Israel_Defense_Forces_checkpoint" title="wikilink">checkpoints</a> such as <a href="Huwwara_checkpoint" title="wikilink">Huwwara checkpoint</a> which effectively cut off the city, severely curtailing social and economic travel.<a href="#fn162" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref162"><sup>162</sup></a> From January 2002, buses, taxis, trucks and private citizens required a permit from the Israeli military authorities to leave and enter Nablus.<a href="#fn163" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref163"><sup>163</sup></a> Since 2011, there has been a relaxation of travel restrictions and the dismantlement of some checkpoints.<a href="#fn164" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref164"><sup>164</sup></a></p>

Taxis are the main form of public transportation within Nablus and the city contains 28 taxi offices and garages.<a href="#fn165" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref165"><sup>165</sup></a></p>
