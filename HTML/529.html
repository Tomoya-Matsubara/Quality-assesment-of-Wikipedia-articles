<h2 id="series-overview">Series overview</h2>
<p>The series takes place in a six-episode format. It follows the actions of John Porter (<a href="Richard_Armitage_(actor)" title="wikilink">Richard Armitage</a>), a former <a href="Special_Air_Service" title="wikilink">SAS</a> Sergeant, and Hugh Collinson (<a href="Andrew_Lincoln" title="wikilink">Andrew Lincoln</a>), a Section 20 officer in the <a href="Secret_Intelligence_Service" title="wikilink">Secret Intelligence Service</a> (MI6). Both of them took part in a botched operation on the eve of the <a href="2003_invasion_of_Iraq" title="wikilink">2003 invasion of Iraq</a> where two soldiers in their unit were killed. The series is divided on three main story lines that took place seven years later. The first two episodes focus on the kidnap of Katie Dartmouth (<a href="Orla_Brady" title="wikilink">Orla Brady</a>), a British journalist, outside <a href="Basra" class="uri" title="wikilink">Basra</a>, <a href="Iraq" class="uri" title="wikilink">Iraq</a>. Porter is redrafted to rescue her. The next two episodes takes place in <a href="Zimbabwe" class="uri" title="wikilink">Zimbabwe</a>, where the Government accuses the UK of orchestrating the assassination plot of <a href="Robert_Mugabe" title="wikilink">Robert Mugabe</a>; Porter is to enter the same prison the apparent shooter is being held and aids in breaking out. The last two episodes take place in <a href="Afghanistan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Afghanistan</a> and <a href="Pakistan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Pakistan</a>, where a <a href="computer_hacker" title="wikilink">computer hacker</a> is responsible for killing several American troops in <a href="Helmand_Province" title="wikilink">Helmand Province</a>. A loose arc also takes place during the series concerning who killed the soldiers.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="cast-and-characters">Cast and characters</h2>
<p><img src="Richard_Armitage_BAFTA_2007.JPG" title="fig:Richard Armitage portrays series protagonist, John Porter." alt="Richard Armitage portrays series protagonist, John Porter." /> <a href="Richard_Armitage_(actor)" title="wikilink">Richard Armitage</a> plays series protagonist John Porter. Porter served in the SAS until he was <a href="military_discharge#Dishonorable" title="wikilink">dishonourably discharged</a> after he saved a boy who was believed to have murdered two soldiers in his unit following a rescue operation the night before the Iraq invasion. He is later brought back into service by Section 20 seven years later. He is married to Diane, and has a daughter, Alexandra. Armitage described Porter as a &quot;damaged hero&quot;,<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></ref> and &quot;sort of like <a href="Lucas_North" title="wikilink">Lucas North</a>, only on some kind of go-faster drug.&quot;<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> In order to fit in to the role, Armitage had to &quot;bulk up for the role,&quot;<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> and performed a lot of training for about ten weeks in the UK, and then flew to <a href="Johannesburg" class="uri" title="wikilink">Johannesburg</a> the day after filming the eighth series of <em><a href="Spooks" class="uri" title="wikilink">Spooks</a></em> wrapped up, where he proceeded with more training.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> He was trained from &quot;how to hold a gun to how you can run through a door without getting your head blown off.&quot;<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> Armitage had not trained as hard as in the past; the intensity of such training almost made him pass out after the first workout, stating &quot;filming <em>Spooks</em> is demanding, but nowhere near as physical as this.&quot;<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> Armitage performed most of his own stunts.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p><a href="Andrew_Lincoln" title="wikilink">Andrew Lincoln</a> plays Hugh Collinson, former soldier in Porter's unit and has since become the head of Section 20. Lincoln was signed onto the role because he thought the series was a &quot;great story&quot;, and that his character was &quot;completely re-written from the book.&quot; Out of the cast, the weapons instructor told Lincoln that he was the most instinctive he ever worked with.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<p><a href="Orla_Brady" title="wikilink">Orla Brady</a> plays Katie Dartmouth, a British <a href="war_correspondent" title="wikilink">war correspondent</a> who was kidnapped in <a href="Basra" class="uri" title="wikilink">Basra</a> by the &quot;Sword of Islam&quot;, an Iraqi terrorist group. To play Dartmouth, Brady used her inspiration from real life <a href="BBC" class="uri" title="wikilink">BBC</a> war correspontant <a href="Orla_Guerin" title="wikilink">Orla Guerin</a>. During the filming of Dartmouth's holding, a male stand-in with a <a href="wig" class="uri" title="wikilink">wig</a> was used as a stunt double.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> The crew also added oil and dirt on Brady's hair every morning. Brady stated that she liked playing extremes, and thought Dartmouth is &quot;grown up&quot; compared to Siobhan Dhillion, the character Brady portrayed in <em><a href="Mistresses_(2008_TV_series)" title="wikilink">Mistresses</a></em>.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<p><a href="Shelley_Conn" title="wikilink">Shelley Conn</a> plays Danni Prendiville, an officer with Section 20. Porter started an <a href="affair" class="uri" title="wikilink">affair</a> with her after he was redrafted into service. She signed on for the role because she &quot;thought the concept of the scripts was very clever and once I heard who was involved it didn't take me long to sign up.&quot; In researching for her role, Conn had somewhat of a military background since her father and uncle both served in the <a href="British_Army" title="wikilink">British Army</a>, and had since had a base understanding of military life.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<p><a href="Colin_Salmon" title="wikilink">Colin Salmon</a> plays James Middleton, a <a href="civil_service" title="wikilink">civil servant</a> who sits between the British government and the <a href="Ministry_of_Defence_(United_Kingdom)" title="wikilink">Ministry of Defence</a>. Salmon previously worked with Sky1 on <em><a href="Hex_(TV_series)" title="wikilink">Hex</a></em>. He was attracted to the role in <em>Strike Back</em> due to the script being &quot;a page-turner, and they're rare. It's really lovely to sit down to start reading something and then not be able to stop because you have to know what's going to happen next,&quot; as well as hearing of who was involved in the project. A member of <a href="The_Prince&#39;s_Trust" title="wikilink">The Prince's Trust</a> charity, Salmon took the opportunity to visit some of their projects in <a href="Soweto" class="uri" title="wikilink">Soweto</a> while the series was filmed.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<p><a href="Jodhi_May" title="wikilink">Jodhi May</a> plays Layla Thompson, a lieutenant in <a href="military_intelligence" title="wikilink">military intelligence</a> and works alongside Collinson in Section 20. At first, she came to resent Porter, but starts opening up to him after she grows some distrust towards Collinson. May described Thompson as an &quot;incredibly challenging, assertive and ambitious woman working in a male-dominated field that she's climbed to the top of.&quot; She was drawn into appear in the series because of the respect she has with <a href="Andy_Harries" title="wikilink">Andy Harries</a> and Left Bank Productions. May knew people who work in the same world her character does, and talked with them to conduct some research into her role, as well as reading on the subject.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<p>The series was also given a variety of guest appearances. Among them include <a href="Nicola_Stephenson" title="wikilink">Nicola Stephenson</a> (Diane Porter), <a href="Laura_Greenwood" title="wikilink">Laura Greenwood</a> (Alexandra Porter), Fenar Mohammed Ali (As'ad), <a href="Dhaffer_L&#39;Abidine" title="wikilink">Dhaffer L'Abidine</a> (Hakin Al Nazeri), <a href="Shaun_Parkes" title="wikilink">Shaun Parkes</a> (Felix Masuku), <a href="David_Harewood" title="wikilink">David Harewood</a> (Colonel Tshuma), <a href="Toby_Stephens" title="wikilink">Toby Stephens</a> (Frank Arlington) and <a href="Alexander_Siddig" title="wikilink">Alexander Siddig</a> (Zahar Sharq).<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="production">Production</h2>
<p><img src="South-Africa_Johannesburg_Botanical_Garden-009.jpg" title="fig:The series was filmed on location in and around Johannesburg, South Africa." alt="The series was filmed on location in and around Johannesburg, South Africa." /> The series was commissioned by Elaine Pyke, the Head of Drama for Sky.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> Pyke and executive producer <a href="Andy_Harries" title="wikilink">Andy Harries</a> had enthusiasm for the novel the series was based on, and were excited to take up the challenge to adapt the novel for television. It was planned to be shot in <a href="High-definition_television" title="wikilink">high-definition</a> because, according to Pyke; &quot;Sky1 HD drama is about trying to astound audiences, up the creative bar, and commission shows which make audiences love being Sky subscribers.&quot; After seeing the success from previous dramas such as <em><a href="Terry_Pratchett&#39;s_Hogfather" title="wikilink">Terry Pratchett's Hogfather</a></em> and <em><a href="The_Take_(TV_series)" title="wikilink">The Take</a></em>, Sky made a multi-million pound commitment to <em>Strike Back</em>.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
<p>Harries commented that he &quot;was interested in developing a quality action series out of the UK because it's something we don't do very often, but there's no reason why we shouldn't.&quot; Richard Armitage called the series an &quot;ambitious project for television. But the advantage of that is that these three feature films are linked together so you get a really interesting character arc through all episodes. American television is being brave and doing that at the moment, and this is stepping into that area.&quot; Former SAS soldier and the original novel's author, <a href="Chris_Ryan" title="wikilink">Chris Ryan</a>, served as the series consultant and script advisor. Chris Ryan stated; &quot;When you produce a novel it's like a child and to see it put onto screen opens it up to a greater audience. I class myself as a storyteller now, and to tell that story on paper is a great privilege, then to see it on screen is even better.&quot;<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> In addition, three ex-SAS soldiers taught the cast weapons and tactical training.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a></p>
<p>Filming commenced on August 2009,<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> and concluded by the end of the same year. It was filmed on location primarily in the Johannesburg area in <a href="South_Africa" title="wikilink">South Africa</a>, as well as the same Province the city is located, <a href="Gauteng" class="uri" title="wikilink">Gauteng</a>.&lt;ref name=&quot;gauteng.co.za&gt;</ref> Other filming locations in the series include <a href="Northern_Cape" title="wikilink">Northern Cape</a>, <a href="Augrabies_Falls_National_Park" title="wikilink">Augrabies Falls National Park</a>,<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> and the <a href="Kalahari_Desert" title="wikilink">Kalahari Desert</a>.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a></p>
<p>One of the biggest problems for filming is the environmental impact they would cause, particularly with explosions. Location manager Jaco Espach often coordinated with a special effects team to use more environmentally friendly methods. In order to film sequences involving firearms and explosives in private property, the series crew often negotiated with property owners, as well as notifying all neighbouring properties, local <a href="police" class="uri" title="wikilink">police</a> and the local <a href="hospital" class="uri" title="wikilink">hospital</a>. In the city, leaflets were distributed to the filming location a week in advance. In airport scenes, the crew would inform the aviation authorities.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> The action sequences in the beginning of the first episode took five days to shoot,<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> and was filmed in the Johannesburg suburb of <a href="Yeoville,_Gauteng" title="wikilink">Yeoville</a>. On the scenes filmed on the Kalahari, filming temporarily halted due to the spotting of venomous <a href="snake" title="wikilink">snakes</a> in the area. After they retreated from some rainfall, the crew swept the area to remove them and filming continued.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a></p>

<h3 id="critical-reception">Critical reception</h3>

<p>Overall, the reviews of the series were generally positive. Michael Conroy of <em><a href="GQ" class="uri" title="wikilink">GQ</a></em> named <em>Strike Back</em> an &quot;Editor's Pick&quot; for its &quot;excellent cinematography, stellar performances and a surprisingly balanced global perspective makes this story of two former British SAS soldiers a thoroughly enjoyable action romp.&quot; Conroy compared the series to <em><a href="Green_Zone_(film)" title="wikilink">Green Zone</a></em>, <em><a href="The_Pacific_(miniseries)" title="wikilink">The Pacific</a></em> and the <em><a href="Call_of_Duty" title="wikilink">Call of Duty</a></em> video game series.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> Kieth Watson of <em><a href="Metro_(Associated_Metro_Limited)" title="wikilink">Metro</a></em> called the series a &quot;British action series that packs a <em><a href="Die_Hard" title="wikilink">Die Hard</a></em>-style thrill around every corner.&quot; Watson praised Armitage's performance, calling him perfect for the role, and that &quot;for once in a British series, the action scenes kick some proper butt.&quot;<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> John Preston of <em><a href="The_Daily_Telegraph" title="wikilink">The Daily Telegraph</a></em> stated that <em>Strike Back</em> was &quot;a slick affair, crisply directed by Daniel Percival, scripted with considerable sharpness by Jed Mercurio and full of belting action sequences.&quot;<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a></p>
<p>Jack Foley of <em>IndieLondon</em> rated the first episodes four stars out of five, stating that it &quot;made for exciting viewing even if the politics and the script sometimes proved laughably gung-ho and naive.&quot;<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> On review on the first two episodes, Jane Simon of <em>Mirror.co.uk</em> has said that between the cast, &quot;there's enough shock and awe to make you very glad they're showing this in a double bill.&quot;<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> Gerard Gilbert of <em>The Arts Desk</em> dubbed <em>Strike Back</em> as &quot;thin and lightweight next to [Armitage's other gig] <em>Spooks</em>&quot;, and although &quot;not unexciting&quot;, Gilbert did not find the series interesting.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> Andrea Mullaney of <em><a href="The_Scotsman" title="wikilink">The Scotsman</a></em> was positive about the casting, and the changes in storyline from the original novel, though the series was aimed &quot;squarely at the blokey viewer who'd rather watch paint dry than a costume drama.&quot;<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> Whilst also reviewing <em><a href="Luther_(TV_series)" title="wikilink">Luther</a></em> and <em><a href="Lewis_(TV_series)" title="wikilink">Lewis</a></em>, John Lloyd of <em><a href="Financial_Times" title="wikilink">The Financial Times</a></em> called it &quot;fine for tension,&quot; &quot;good on sub-<a href="James_Bond" title="wikilink">Bond</a> dialogue&quot; and that the story lines make <em>Spooks</em> look true to life. Lloyd also called Richard Armitage &quot;one of the best action men on television.&quot; <a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a></p>
<p><em><a href="The_Guardian" title="wikilink">The Guardian</a></em> and <em><a href="The_Independent" title="wikilink">The Independent</a></em> have each released two separate reviews; they were more mixed. Sam Wollaston enjoyed the first two episodes, but called it a &quot;pathetic male fantasy.&quot;<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> Andrew Anthony has said that &quot;no scene lasted more than about 25 seconds in the first two episodes and no element of plot information was left unspoken. The dialogue is close to pure exposition, with an occasional clunkily macho line thrown in as a concession to dramatic atmosphere. Show, don't tell, say the screenwriting gurus. This was show <em>and</em> tell.&quot;<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> From <em>The Independent</em>, Tom Sutcliffe stated the series may be enjoyed by those who like explosions and <em>Spooks</em>-like operations.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> Rhiannon Harries was almost negative in her review, believing <em>Strike Back</em> was &quot;in almost every respect, a terrible piece of television drama,&quot; although part of Harries enjoyed watching it. Harries noted that <em>Luther</em> was more recommended.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a></p>

Porter calls Collinson regarding a pick-up and a deal with Baxter, but they have to return to Afghanistan. When they arrive, a sole Taliban kills Baxter.

When Leyla finds a ballistics match with Collinson's weapon, she confronts and forces him to save Porter at the extraction point.

Collinson is mortally wounded while aiding Porter's escape, and uses a <a href="hand_grenade" title="wikilink">grenade</a> to kill the Taliban unit. The episode ends in a cliffhanger, as a Delta force elimination team is given the green light to intercept Porter.</p></th>
