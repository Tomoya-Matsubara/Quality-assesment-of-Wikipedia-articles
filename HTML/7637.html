<p><strong>Delaware Route 1</strong> (<strong>DE 1</strong>) is a  <a href="state_highway" title="wikilink">state highway</a> in the U.S. state of <a href="Delaware" class="uri" title="wikilink">Delaware</a>. The route runs from the <a href="Maryland" class="uri" title="wikilink">Maryland</a> border in <a href="Fenwick_Island,_Delaware" title="wikilink">Fenwick Island</a>, <a href="Sussex_County,_Delaware" title="wikilink">Sussex County</a>, where it continues into that state as <a href="Maryland_Route_528" title="wikilink">Maryland Route 528</a> (MD 528), north to an interchange with <a href="Delaware_Route_58" title="wikilink">DE 58</a> in <a href="Christiana,_Delaware" title="wikilink">Christiana</a>, <a href="New_Castle_County,_Delaware" title="wikilink">New Castle County</a>, where the road continues north as <a href="Delaware_Route_7" title="wikilink">DE 7</a>. Between Fenwick Island and <a href="Dover_Air_Force_Base" title="wikilink">Dover Air Force Base</a> in <a href="Dover,_Delaware" title="wikilink">Dover</a>, <a href="Kent_County,_Delaware" title="wikilink">Kent County</a>, DE 1 is a four- to six-lane surface <a href="divided_highway" title="wikilink">divided highway</a> with occasional interchanges. The route heads north past the <a href="Delaware_Beaches" title="wikilink">Delaware Beaches</a> along the <a href="Atlantic_Ocean" title="wikilink">Atlantic Ocean</a> before it runs northwest through rural areas, turning north at <a href="Milford,_Delaware" title="wikilink">Milford</a> to continue to Dover. Upon reaching Dover, DE 1 becomes the <strong>Korean War Veterans Memorial Highway</strong>, a four- to six-lane <a href="freeway" class="uri" title="wikilink">freeway</a> that is <a href="toll_road" title="wikilink">tolled</a>. Between Dover and <a href="Tybouts_Corner,_Delaware" title="wikilink">Tybouts Corner</a>, DE 1 parallels <a href="U.S._Route_13_in_Delaware" title="wikilink">U.S. Route 13</a> (US 13), crossing over and featuring interchanges with it multiple times. Past Tybouts Corner, the freeway heads north to Christiana, reaching an interchange with <a href="Interstate_95_in_Delaware" title="wikilink">Interstate 95</a> (I-95) a short distance before its terminus.</p>
<p>DE 1 was first designated in the 1970s between Fenwick Island and <a href="U.S._Route_113" title="wikilink">US 113</a> in Milford, replacing a portion of <a href="Delaware_Route_14" title="wikilink">DE 14</a> and following the newly constructed Milford Bypass. DE 14 between Fenwick Island and Milford had been built as a state highway in the 1920s and 1930s and was widened into a divided highway between the 1950s and 1970s. In the 1980s, a limited-access Relief Route for US 13 was proposed between Dover and the <a href="Wilmington,_Delaware" title="wikilink">Wilmington</a> area in order to relieve that route of beach traffic. This relief route would be incorporated into DE 1 in 1988, with the route extended up US 113 between Milford and Dover to connect to the Relief Route. The tolled DE 1 freeway between Dover Air Force Base and Christiana opened in multiple stages between 1991 and 2003, and at a cost of $900 million was the largest public works project in Delaware history. The concurrent US 113 designation north of Milford was removed in 2004. Upgrades continue to be made to DE 1 such as the construction and improvement of interchanges as well as widening portions of the road.</p>

<p><img src="DE_1_SB_at_Clapham_Road.JPG" title="fig:DE 1 southbound at Clapham Road in Little Heaven" alt="DE 1 southbound at Clapham Road in Little Heaven" /> The portion of DE 1 between Milford and Little Heaven was initially built as part of the DuPont Highway, a highway that spanned the state from <a href="Selbyville,_Delaware" title="wikilink">Selbyville</a> to <a href="Wilmington,_Delaware" title="wikilink">Wilmington</a>. The highway was proposed as a modern road that was part of a philanthropic measure. This roadway was planned to improve travel and bring economic development to Kent and Sussex counties. The DuPont Highway was to be modeled after the great boulevards of <a href="Europe" class="uri" title="wikilink">Europe</a> and was to have a  wide right-of-way consisting of a  wide roadway for automobiles flanked by dual <a href="Tram" title="wikilink">trolley</a> lines,  wide roadways for heavy vehicles,  wide unpaved roadways for horses, and sidewalks. Utilities were to be buried underground below the horse roadways. The highway was also to include agricultural experimental stations and monuments for future surveying. Trolley revenues would help pay for the construction of the roadway. After portions of the DuPont Highway were built, these portions were planned to be turned over to the state at no charge.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a></p>

A service road would serve properties on the southbound side of US 13.<a href="#fn138" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref138"><sup>138</sup></a> In October 2001, northbound US 13 was realigned to the new alignment south of Odessa in order to build DE 1 in that area.<a href="#fn139" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref139"><sup>139</sup></a> In May 2002, US 13 was shifted to a new southbound alignment south of Odessa, with the former portion of the route in that area becoming a service road known as Harris Road.<a href="#fn140" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref140"><sup>140</sup></a><a href="#fn141" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref141"><sup>141</sup></a> On September 5, 2002, a partial interchange opened at DE 8 in Dover, utilizing existing emergency vehicle ramps.<a href="#fn142" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref142"><sup>142</sup></a><a href="#fn143" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref143"><sup>143</sup></a> This interchange was included in the initial plans for the highway but was dropped due to low traffic volumes. As part of building the interchange, DelDOT purchased development rights to adjacent land parcels in order to prevent additional development in the area of the interchange.<a href="#fn144" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref144"><sup>144</sup></a></p>
<p>On May 19, 2003, Governor <a href="Ruth_Ann_Minner" title="wikilink">Ruth Ann Minner</a> cut the ribbon for the final section of the DE 1 toll road between US 13 north of Smyrna and US 13 south of Odessa.<a href="#fn145" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref145"><sup>145</sup></a><a href="#fn146" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref146"><sup>146</sup></a> This section opened to traffic two days later.<a href="#fn147" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref147"><sup>147</sup></a> As a result, DE 1 was moved off US 13 between Smyrna and Odessa.<a href="#fn148" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref148"><sup>148</sup></a> The total cost to build the toll road was $900 million and it was the largest public works project in Delaware history.<a href="#fn149" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref149"><sup>149</sup></a> As part of building DE 1, DelDOT created new wetlands to replace the ones that were lost in construction of the highway.<a href="#fn150" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref150"><sup>150</sup></a></p>
<p>Traffic congestion at the cloverleaf interchange with I-95 in Christiana led to DelDOT to improve the interchange. The project included adding flyover connecting ramps from northbound DE 1 to northbound I-95 and from southbound I-95 to southbound DE 1 which allowed for easier merging patterns and the elimination of lengthy backups on the former ramp design.<a href="#fn151" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref151"><sup>151</sup></a><a href="#fn152" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref152"><sup>152</sup></a> Construction of a new &quot;ring access road&quot; around Christiana Mall began in February 2011<a href="#fn153" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref153"><sup>153</sup></a> and was completed in March 2012, with a newly built bridge over DE 1, just south of the I-95 interchange.<a href="#fn154" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref154"><sup>154</sup></a> The ramp from southbound I-95 to southbound DE 1/DE 7 opened on August 27, 2013 and the ramp from northbound DE 1/DE 7 to northbound I-95 opened on October 17, 2013, with a ribbon cutting ceremony attended by Governor Jack Markell and DelDOT secretary Shailen Bhatt.<a href="#fn155" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref155"><sup>155</sup></a><a href="#fn156" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref156"><sup>156</sup></a></p>
<p>DelDOT has plans to widen DE 1 by an additional lane in each direction between the Chesapeake and Delaware Canal Bridge and the DE 273 interchange in Christiana. The project will involve widening bridges and reconfiguring interchanges. This project is expected to start in 2016.<a href="#fn157" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref157"><sup>157</sup></a></p>
