<p>Phelps failed in his first bid for reelection, in 1874. After his term ended, Phelps returned in 1875 to his Teaneck home, where he planned improvements to the homestead and looked for additional land investments nearby. In the next year, he embarked upon a European tour, partly to regain his health which had suffered from a bout of <a href="typhoid_fever" title="wikilink">typhoid fever</a>.

<h2 id="arborculturist">Arborculturist</h2>
<p>Returning to the United States, Phelps spent most of his time resting and working on his most important hobby&lt;U+2014&gt;his estate. His great passion was trees and the woods; he was a devotee of arboriculture. Between 1875 and 1880 Phelps was responsible for planting approximately 600,000 trees of numerous varieties.</p>
<p>In 1880 Phelps was selected to manage the Republican Presidential campaign but he was unable to complete the assignment because of feeble health.

<p>In 1886 the Phelps mansion was completed. At Christmas time the family held a glorious celebration with people from all over the country viewing the mansion for the first time. Phelps' favorite room was a gallery which he had designed himself to hold his priceless collection of art treasures from the ends of the earth.</p>
<p>It was nearly midnight on April 1, 1888 when Phelps, returning to his apartments in <a href="Washington,_D.C." title="wikilink">Washington, D.C.</a> after an evening with friends, found on the table in his bedroom two telegrams which told him that his mansion in Teaneck, where his family then was, had been totally destroyed by fire, with a loss of nearly all its valuable contents. He disturbed no one upon receiving this startling news, but very early in the morning awakened his secretary, told him what had happened, and said that he was going to take an immediate train for New York. He left on the train without once alluding to the great calamity.</p>
<p>The mansion, once the most beautiful in the area, became known as &quot;Phelps' Ruin&quot; and local residents picnicked near the destroyed home, marveling at what it once had been. Phelps immediately began renovation of the house.</p>

Phelps remained in the post for one year until a case of homesickness prompted his request for a short leave of absence. He sailed for America in September 1890.</p>
<p>In his diary Phelps wrote,</p>

<p>Phelps returned to <a href="Germany" class="uri" title="wikilink">Germany</a> a year later, remaining in this post until January 1893, when his health began to suffer due to the climate. He traveled south, vacationing in <a href="Spain" class="uri" title="wikilink">Spain</a>, <a href="Morocco" class="uri" title="wikilink">Morocco</a>, <a href="Tunis" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tunis</a>, <a href="Algiers" class="uri" title="wikilink">Algiers</a> and <a href="Italy" class="uri" title="wikilink">Italy</a>, hoping the climate would improve his health.</p>
<h2 id="state-judge-and-final-days">State judge and final days</h2>
<p>While Phelps was vacationing, <a href="Governor_of_New_Jersey" title="wikilink">Governor of New Jersey</a> <a href="George_T._Werts" title="wikilink">George T.

Turning over the affairs of the legation to his successor, Phelps again returned to the United States to be sworn into his judicial role on June 20, 1893.</p>
<p>In February 1894, Phelps' throat began to trouble him seriously, and the illness confined him to his home for days. He continued to try to keep up with his work and was present until the adjournment of the term. A few days later he traveled to the <a href="Hygeia_Hotel" title="wikilink">Hygeia Hotel</a> at <a href="Old_Point_Comfort" title="wikilink">Old Point Comfort</a> in <a href="Virginia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Virginia</a>, a resort that in the past had been a place of rest for him.</p>
<p>Phelps became withdrawn and quiet, an attitude brought on by his physical inability to converse. The last entry in his diary is dated April 10, 1894. Phelps moved himself to <a href="Hot_Springs,_Virginia" title="wikilink">Hot Springs, Virginia</a>, where he enjoyed a temporary return of strength. Finding no lasting improvement in his health in Hot Springs, Phelps returned to his home in Teaneck on May 18. By May 31 he was bedridden, and in June he lapsed into a coma. He died June 17, 1894.</p>
<p>Hundreds of people lined the streets of Teaneck and <a href="Englewood,_New_Jersey" title="wikilink">Englewood</a> to honor his funeral procession. The trees he had planted himself lined the path of this final journey. At the time of his death, Phelps owned half of what is presently Teaneck.</p>
