<p><strong>Kate Bush</strong> (born Catherine Bush <a href="30_July" title="wikilink">30 July</a>, <a href="1958" class="uri" title="wikilink">1958</a>, <a href="Bexleyheath" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bexleyheath</a>, <a href="Greater_London" title="wikilink">Greater London</a>), is an <a href="England" title="wikilink">English</a> singer, songwriter, musician and <a href="record_producer" title="wikilink">record producer</a>. Her eclectic and meticulous musical style, and idiosyncratic and literary lyrics have made her one of the <a href="United_Kingdom" title="wikilink">United Kingdom</a>'s most successful and original solo female performers of the past 30 years.</p>
<p>The <a href="Brit_Award" title="wikilink">Brit Award</a> winning and <a href="Grammy_Award" title="wikilink">Grammy Award</a> nominated Bush was signed up by <a href="EMI" class="uri" title="wikilink">EMI</a> at the age of 16, after being recommended by <a href="Pink_Floyd" title="wikilink">Pink Floyd</a>'s <a href="David_Gilmour" title="wikilink">David Gilmour</a>. In 1978 at age 19, she debuted with the surprise hit &quot;<a href="Wuthering_Heights_(song)" title="wikilink">Wuthering Heights</a>&quot;, topping the UK charts for four weeks and becoming the first woman to have a UK number one with a self-penned song. She has since gone on to release nine albums, three of which topped the UK album charts, and have UK top ten hit singles with &quot;<a href="Running_Up_That_Hill" title="wikilink">Running Up That Hill</a>&quot;, &quot;<a href="King_of_the_Mountain_(song)" title="wikilink">King of the Mountain</a>&quot;, &quot;<a href="Babooshka" class="uri" title="wikilink">Babooshka</a>&quot;, &quot;<a href="The_Man_with_the_Child_in_His_Eyes" title="wikilink">The Man with the Child in His Eyes</a>&quot; and &quot;<a href="Don&#39;t_Give_Up_(Peter_Gabriel_and_Kate_Bush_song)" title="wikilink">Don't Give Up</a>&quot;.</p>
<p>During her tour of 1979, the only tour of her career, she became the first ever singer to use a wireless headset radio microphone on stage. With her 1980 album <em><a href="Never_For_Ever" title="wikilink">Never For Ever</a></em>, she became the first solo female British singer to top the UK album charts. Her skillful songwriting ability was recognised in 2002 with an <a href="Ivor_Novello_Award" title="wikilink">Ivor Novello Award</a> for 'Outstanding Contribution to British Music'. In 2005, she released <em><a href="Aerial_(album)" title="wikilink">Aerial</a></em>, her first album in twelve years. The album was a UK success and earned her Brit Award nominations for 'Best Album' and 'Best Solo Female Artist'.</p>
<h2 id="biography">Biography</h2>
<h3 id="early-life">Early life</h3>
<p>Bush was born to an <a href="England" title="wikilink">English</a> <a href="physician" class="uri" title="wikilink">physician</a> father Dr. Robert Bush and an <a href="Ireland" title="wikilink">Irish</a> mother Hannah. She was raised in their farmhouse in <a href="East_Wickham" title="wikilink">East Wickham</a> on the border of <a href="Kent" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kent</a> and <a href="London" class="uri" title="wikilink">London</a>, with her older brothers John and Paddy.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> Bush came from an artistic background; her mother being a former Irish folk dancer and her father an accomplished pianist. Her brother Paddy worked as a musical instrument maker and John was a poet and photographer. Both brothers were involved in the local <a href="folk_music" title="wikilink">folk music</a> scene.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> Her family's musical influence inspired the young Kate to teach herself to play the piano at age eleven. She soon began writing her own tunes, and eventually added <a href="lyrics" class="uri" title="wikilink">lyrics</a> to them.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> At school, she was encouraged to take violin lessons, but the piano remained her passion.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>In the mid 1970s, while attending St. Joseph's Convent Grammar school in <a href="Abbey_Wood" title="wikilink">Abbey Wood</a>, <a href="London" class="uri" title="wikilink">London</a>, Bush's talents as a singer/songwriter were brought to the attention of <a href="David_Gilmour" title="wikilink">David Gilmour</a> of <a href="Pink_Floyd" title="wikilink">Pink Floyd</a>. He was given a <a href="demo_tape" title="wikilink">demo tape</a> of her work by Ricky Hopper, a mutual friend of Gilmour and the Bush family. Impressed with what he heard, Gilmour helped her get a more professional sounding demo tape recorded that would be more saleable to the record companies.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> The tape was produced by Gilmour's friend Andrew Powell, who would go on to produce Bush's first two albums.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> At the age of 16, Bush was signed up by <a href="EMI" class="uri" title="wikilink">EMI</a> after being recommended by Gilmour.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> Because of her age, in the first two years of her contract, Bush did not begin working on an album, but instead continued her time at school. She eventually left just after doing her mock <a href="Advanced_Level_(UK)" title="wikilink">A-levels</a> and having gained 10 GCE <a href="O-Level" class="uri" title="wikilink">O-Level</a> qualifications.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> In 2005, Bush stated in an interview with <a href="Mark_Radcliffe" title="wikilink">Mark Radcliffe</a> on <a href="BBC_Radio_2" title="wikilink">BBC Radio 2</a> that she felt that EMI did not get her to release an album straight away not so that she could hone her talents, as they stated, but rather in order that no other record company could offer her a contract. After the contract signing, EMI forwarded her a sizable amount of start-up money which she used to enroll in <a href="interpretive_dance" title="wikilink">interpretive dance</a> classes taught by <a href="Lindsay_Kemp" title="wikilink">Lindsay Kemp</a>, who was also a former teacher of <a href="David_Bowie" title="wikilink">David Bowie</a>.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<p>During this time, she gained experience performing by singing in a band called the KT Bush Band at various pubs around <a href="London" class="uri" title="wikilink">London</a>. The band included her brother Paddy and then boyfriend <a href="Del_Palmer" title="wikilink">Del Palmer</a>. She also wrote and made demos of close to 200 songs, a few of which today can be found on bootleg recordings. Some of the demos are now often known as the <em><a href="Phoenix_Recordings" title="wikilink">Phoenix Recordings</a></em>.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> She began recording her first album in 1977.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="section">1978-1979</h3>
<p><img src="The_Kick_Inside_UK_cover.jpg" title="fig: U.K. Cover of 1978&#39;s The Kick Inside" alt=" U.K. Cover of 1978&#39;s The Kick Inside" width="225" /> Her first album, <em><a href="The_Kick_Inside" title="wikilink">The Kick Inside</a></em>, was released in 1978, and featured songs she had written during the previous several years, including her debut single, the high-pitched and ethereal &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot;, which topped the UK and Australian charts and became an international hit. In doing so, Bush became the first woman to reach Number 1 in the UK with a self-penned song.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> EMI originally wanted the more rock-orientated track &quot;James and the Cold Gun&quot; to be her debut song but the strong-willed Bush insisted that it should &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot;. Even by this early stage of her career, she had gained a reputation as being determined to have a say in decisions affecting her work.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<p>The album was released when she was 19 years old, having written some of the songs when she was only 13.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> Two of the demos she recorded with Gilmour were included on the album, &quot;The Saxophone Song&quot; and &quot;<a href="The_Man_With_The_Child_In_His_Eyes" title="wikilink">The Man With The Child In His Eyes</a>&quot;.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
<p>Bush's cinematic and literary influences, two qualities considered her trademarks, were most obvious in &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot;. The song was not initially inspired by <a href="Emily_Bront&lt;U+00EB&gt;" title="wikilink">Emily Bront&lt;U+00EB&gt;</a>'s novel, but by a television adaptation, although she did read the novel later to, in her own words, &quot;get the research right&quot;.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> Further influences can be found when she namechecks <a href="G._I._Gurdjieff" title="wikilink">Gurdjieff</a> in &quot;Them Heavy People&quot;, acknowledges David Gilmour's support in 'Strange Phenomena&quot;, while the title song is based on the Ballad of Lizzie Wan, the story of a girl who kills herself after being impregnated by her brother. The album is also rather open about sexual matters, particularly on the erotic &quot;Feel It&quot; and &quot;L'Amour Looks Something Like You&quot;. A second single, &quot;The Man With The Child In His Eyes&quot;, was released to another warm reception, reaching number six in the UK charts.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> It even made it onto the American Hot 100 Billboard Charts, Bush's only single to do so until 1985. The song went on to win her an <a href="Ivor_Novello_Award" title="wikilink">Ivor Novello Award</a> in 1979 for &quot;Outstanding British Lyric&quot;.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
<p>As part of her preparation for entering the studio, Bush toured pubs with the KT Bush Band but for the album she was persuaded to use established session musicians, some of whom she would retain even after she had brought her band mates back on board.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> Paddy Bush was the only member of the KT Bush Band to play on <em>The Kick Inside</em>. Unlike on later albums where he would play more exotic instruments such as <a href="balalaika" class="uri" title="wikilink">balalaika</a> and <a href="didgeridoo" class="uri" title="wikilink">didgeridoo</a>, here he played the more standard <a href="harmonica" class="uri" title="wikilink">harmonica</a> and <a href="mandolin" class="uri" title="wikilink">mandolin</a>. Stuart Elliot played some of the <a href="drums" class="uri" title="wikilink">drums</a> and would become her main <a href="Percussion_instrument" title="wikilink">percussionist</a> on subsequent albums,<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> along with session drummer <a href="Charlie_Morgan" title="wikilink">Charlie Morgan</a>, who later went on to be a regular with <a href="Elton_John" title="wikilink">Elton John</a>. <a href="Preston_Heyman" title="wikilink">Preston Heyman</a> was credited with some subsequent studio work but mostly performed on Bush's live tour of 1979.</p>
<p>EMI capitalised on Bush's appearance by promoting the album with a poster of her in a tight pink top which emphasised her breasts. In an interview with <a href="NME" class="uri" title="wikilink">NME</a> magazine in 1982, Bush criticised the marketing technique, stating &quot;People weren't even generally aware that I wrote my own songs or played the piano. The media just promoted me as a female body. It's like I've had to prove that I'm an artist in a female body&quot;.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a></p>
<p><img src="Kate_Bush_Lionheart.jpg" title="fig: Cover of 1978&#39;s Lionheart" alt=" Cover of 1978&#39;s Lionheart" width="225" /> In 1979, EMI persuaded Bush to quickly record a follow-up album, <em><a href="Lionheart_(album)" title="wikilink">Lionheart</a></em>, to take advantage of the success of <em>The Kick Inside</em>. Bush has often expressed dissatisfaction with <em>Lionheart</em>, feeling that she needed more time to get it right.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> The album was rushed out of the studio in <a href="Nice" class="uri" title="wikilink">Nice</a> on the <a href="French_Riviera" title="wikilink">French Riviera</a>, making this her only album to be wholly recorded outside the UK. The album was produced by Andrew Powell, assisted by Bush. While it has its share of hits, most notably &quot;Wow&quot;, it did not receive the same reception as her first album, reaching number six in the UK album charts.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a></p>
<p>The album takes its title from the track, &quot;Oh, England, My Lionheart&quot;, in which a pilot who has been shot down contemplates his homeland as his plane hurtles towards the ground, and to his death. It is a song that Bush has disparaged in later years<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> despite it being a firm favorite with many listeners. Literary references include <a href="J._M._Barrie" title="wikilink">J. M. Barrie</a>'s <a href="Peter_Pan" title="wikilink">Peter Pan</a> in <em>In Search of Peter Pan</em> (a song which also quotes <em><a href="When_You_Wish_Upon_A_Star" title="wikilink">When You Wish Upon A Star</a></em> from the classic <a href="Walt_Disney_Pictures" title="wikilink">Disney</a> film, <em><a href="Pinocchio" class="uri" title="wikilink">Pinocchio</a></em>), as well as a nod towards <em><a href="Arsenic_and_Old_Lace_(play)" title="wikilink">Arsenic and Old Lace</a></em> in the song &quot;Coffee Homeground&quot;, which was originally inspired by a taxi driver who drove Bush once.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> Film references include &quot;Hammer Horror&quot;, inspired by the <a href="Hammer_Horror" title="wikilink">Hammer Film studio</a>, known for their <a href="Gothic_novel" title="wikilink">gothic</a> <a href="horror_film" title="wikilink">horror</a> films. The British television show <em><a href="The_Sweeney" title="wikilink">The Sweeney</a></em>, a popular police drama, was mentioned in the lyrics of the song &quot;Wow&quot;.</p>
<p>Notable for his work on all subsequent recordings by Bush, <em>Lionheart</em> is the first record on which her then boyfriend, Del Palmer, worked as a bassist. Palmer went on to play bass, or to engineer and record every album since.</p>
<p>Displeased with being rushed into making the second album, Bush subsequently increased her efforts to have control over work by setting up her own publishing company, Kate Bush Music, and her own management company, Novercia. The board of directors of these companies were made up of herself and members of her family.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a></p>
<p>Following the album's release, she was required to undertake heavy promotional work and an exhausting tour, the only one of her career.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> Typical of her determination to have control, she was involved in every aspect of the shows production, choreography, set design and staff recruitment.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> During the 'Tour of Life', Bush became the first ever singer to use a wireless headset radio microphone on stage,<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> which allowed her to incorporate extensive dance routines into her live shows.</p>
<p>However, Bush disliked the exposure and the celebrity lifestyle associated with promotional work, feeling it was taking her away from her main priority of making music. A slow and steady withdrawal from public life began as she moved into producing her own work. It was at this stage of her career that she developed her perfectionist approach which would see her ensconced in the studio for long periods and only needing to face the glare of the press when albums were released. A pattern eventually formed, where Bush would disappear for up to four years while she honed her new material until it was ready for release. While making her albums, rumours would circulate in the press, such as she had ballooned in weight or had gone mad.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> Then she would re-emerge for a brief period, slim and seemingly sane, before retreating to the studio once more.</p>
<h3 id="section-1">1980-1982</h3>
<p><img src="Kate_Bush_Never_Forever.jpg" title="fig: Cover of 1980&#39;s Never for Ever" alt=" Cover of 1980&#39;s Never for Ever" width="225" /> Released in September 1980, <em><a href="Never_for_Ever" title="wikilink">Never for Ever</a></em> saw Bush's second foray into production, aided by the engineer of <em>Lionheart</em>, Jon Kelly. Her first time as a producer was on her <em><a href="On_Stage_(EP)" title="wikilink">Live On Stage</a></em> <a href="Extended_play" title="wikilink">EP</a> released after her tour the previous year.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> The first two albums had resulted in a definite sound which was evident in every track, with lush orchestral arrangements supporting the live band sound. The range of styles on <em>Never for Ever</em> is much more diverse, veering from the straightforward rocker, &quot;The Wedding List&quot;, to the sad, wistful waltz of hit single, &quot;<a href="Army_Dreamers" title="wikilink">Army Dreamers</a>&quot;. <em>Never for Ever</em> was the first Kate Bush album to be composed on synthesizers and drum machines, in particular, the <a href="Fairlight_CMI" title="wikilink">Fairlight CMI</a> which she was introduced to when providing backing vocals on <a href="Peter_Gabriel" title="wikilink">Peter Gabriel</a>'s third album in early 1980.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a></p>
<p><em>Never for Ever</em> proved to be Bush's first record to reach the top position in the UK album charts, also making her the first female Briton ever to achieve that status.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a></p>
<p>Bush's literary and cinematic influences were at work once more. &quot;The Infant Kiss&quot; was inspired by the 1961 film <em><a href="The_Innocents_(film)" title="wikilink">The Innocents</a></em>, starring <a href="Deborah_Kerr" title="wikilink">Deborah Kerr</a> and <a href="Michael_Redgrave" title="wikilink">Michael Redgrave</a>, which in turn had been inspired by <em><a href="The_Turn_of_the_Screw" title="wikilink">The Turn of the Screw</a></em> by <a href="Henry_James" title="wikilink">Henry James</a>, while &quot;The Wedding List&quot; drew from <a href="Fran&lt;U+00E7&gt;ois_Truffaut" title="wikilink">Fran&lt;U+00E7&gt;ois Truffaut</a>'s 1968 film <em><a href="The_Bride_Wore_Black" title="wikilink">The Bride Wore Black</a></em>. <em>Never for Ever</em> is, to date, the only album by Bush not to share a title with one of its own tracks.</p>
<p>In November 1980, she released the Christmas single &quot;December Will Be Magic Again&quot;, which reached number 29 in the UK charts. The song was not part of the <em>Never for Ever</em> album.</p>
<p><img src="Kate_Bush_The_Dreaming_Cover.jpg" title="fig: Cover of 1982&#39;s The Dreaming" alt=" Cover of 1982&#39;s The Dreaming" width="225" /> September 1982 saw the release of <em><a href="The_Dreaming_(album)" title="wikilink">The Dreaming</a></em>, the first album Bush produced totally by herself.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> With her newfound freedom, she experimented with production techniques, creating an album that features a very diverse blend of musical styles and that is known for its near-exhaustive usage of the <a href="Fairlight_CMI" title="wikilink">Fairlight CMI</a>.</p>
<p><em>The Dreaming</em> met with a mixed critical reception at first. Many were baffled by the dense soundscapes she had created. The album was not considered to be a financial success, although it still reached number three in the UK album charts.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> In a 1993 interview with <a href="Q_magazine" title="wikilink">Q magazine</a>, referring to <em>The Dreaming</em>, Bush stated, &quot;That was my 'She's gone mad' album.&quot;<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> Ironically, the album was hailed as a &quot;masterpiece&quot; and a &quot;musical tour de force&quot; by critics in America, and the album became her first to enter the US charts, albeit only reaching number 157.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a></p>
<p>&lt;U+201C&gt;<a href="Sat_in_Your_Lap" title="wikilink">Sat in Your Lap</a>&lt;U+201D&gt; was the first single from the album to be released. It predated the album by nearly a year and peaked at #11 in the UK. The following singles fared even worse. &quot;<a href="The_Dreaming" title="wikilink">The Dreaming</a>&quot;, the album's title track featuring the talents of <a href="Rolf_Harris" title="wikilink">Rolf Harris</a> and <a href="Percy_Edwards" title="wikilink">Percy Edwards</a>, stalled at number 48, whilst the next single, &quot;<a href="There_Goes_a_Tenner" title="wikilink">There Goes a Tenner</a>&quot;, failed to chart at all, despite promotion from EMI and Bush.</p>
<p>Bush was in her early twenties when making the album and tended to look outside herself for sources of inspiration. She drew on old crime films for the track &quot;There Goes A Tenner&quot;, a documentary about the <a href="Vietnam_war" title="wikilink">war in Vietnam</a> for &quot;Pull Out The Pin&quot;, the plight of <a href="Indigenous_Australians" title="wikilink">Indigenous Australians</a> for &quot;The Dreaming&quot;, the death of <a href="Houdini" class="uri" title="wikilink">Houdini</a> for &quot;Houdini&quot; and <a href="Stanley_Kubrick" title="wikilink">Stanley Kubrick</a>'s film of <a href="Stephen_King" title="wikilink">Stephen King</a>'s novel <em><a href="The_Shining_(novel)" title="wikilink">The Shining</a></em> for &quot;Get Out Of My House&quot;. There were a few more personal tracks, though. The lead single, &quot;Sat In Your Lap&quot;, examined feelings of self-doubt versus burning self-confidence and the search for a balance between the two, while &quot;Leave It Open&quot; spoke of the need to acknowledge and express the darker sides of one's personality, within the greater context of maintaining an open mind.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="section-2">1983-1987</h3>
<p><img src="Hounds_of_love.jpg" title="fig: Cover of 1985&#39;s Hounds of Love" alt=" Cover of 1985&#39;s Hounds of Love" width="225" /> Considered by many reviewers as her masterpiece, 1985's <em><a href="Hounds_of_Love" title="wikilink">Hounds of Love</a></em> is no less experimental than previous albums from a production standpoint. Not only did she produce it herself, but for this album, stung by the huge costs she had run up hiring studio space for <em>The Dreaming</em>, she built a private 24 track studio near her home where she could work at her own pace.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a></p>
<p>In August of 1985, the <em><a href="NME" class="uri" title="wikilink">NME</a></em>, featured Bush in a &quot;Where Are They Now&quot; article. Two days later, on <em>The <a href="Wogan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Wogan</a> Show</em>, the single &quot;Running Up That Hill&quot; was played for the first time. The single, and indeed the album, were showcases of a newfound talent for producing. <em>Hounds of Love</em> ultimately topped the charts in the UK, knocking Madonna's &quot;Like A Virgin&quot; from the number one position.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a></p>
<p>The album is split into two sides, with the first side, Hounds of Love, containing five &quot;accessible&quot; pop songs, including the four singles: &quot;<a href="Running_Up_That_Hill" title="wikilink">Running Up That Hill</a>,&quot; &quot;<a href="Cloudbusting" class="uri" title="wikilink">Cloudbusting</a>,&quot; &quot;<a href="Hounds_of_Love" title="wikilink">Hounds of Love</a>,&quot; and &quot;<a href="The_Big_Sky" title="wikilink">The Big Sky</a>.&quot; &quot;Running Up That Hill&quot; re-introduced Kate to American listeners, and received considerable airplay at the time of its release. &quot;The Big Sky&quot; can be viewed as a creative <a href="manifesto" class="uri" title="wikilink">manifesto</a> issued by Kate in response to criticisms of <em>The Dreaming</em>, for which she had been criticized for being too <a href="obtuse" class="uri" title="wikilink">obtuse</a>. The second side of the album is entitled &quot;The Ninth Wave&quot;, whose title is taken from a poem by <a href="Alfred_Tennyson,_1st_Baron_Tennyson" title="wikilink">Tennyson</a>.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> As part of a song cycle, each track helps to convey the story of a woman who is lost at sea, facing death by drowning, and the tortured night she spends in the water. Bush's technical ability is shown to full effect, using samples and vocals played in reverse to synthesized sounds and folk instrumentation.</p>
<p>At the 1986 <a href="BRIT_Awards" title="wikilink">BRIT Awards</a>, the album earned her nominations for &quot;Best Female Solo Artist&quot;, &quot;Best Album&quot;, &quot;Best Single&quot; and &quot;Best Producer&quot;. She failed to win an award, however. In same year, Bush and <a href="Peter_Gabriel" title="wikilink">Peter Gabriel</a> had a UK top ten hit with &quot;Don't Give Up&quot; and EMI released her 'greatest hits' album, <a href="The_Whole_Story" title="wikilink">The Whole Story</a>, for which she recorded the single &quot;Experiment IV&quot; and provided new vocals to &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot;. This proved to be enough to win her &quot;Best Female Solo Artist&quot; at the 1987 BRIT Awards.</p>

<p><img src="Kate_Bush_The_Sensual_World.jpg" title="fig: Cover of 1989&#39;s The Sensual World" alt=" Cover of 1989&#39;s The Sensual World" width="225" /> The increasingly personal tone of her writing continued on 1989's <em><a href="The_Sensual_World" title="wikilink">The Sensual World</a></em>, with songs about unexpressed and unrequited love (&quot;Love And Anger&quot; and &quot;Never Be Mine&quot;, respectively), the pressures on modern relationships (&quot;Between A Man And A Woman&quot;), and self-doubt (&quot;The Fog&quot;). &quot;Deeper Understanding&quot; portrayed a lonely person who finds solace in the company of a computer, which perhaps prophecised the <a href="internet_addiction" title="wikilink">internet addiction</a> that would surface by the end of the following decade. &quot;Rocket's Tail&quot;, which was a dedication to her recently deceased cat, Rocket, invoked the joys of indulging in another's fantasy. The quirkiest track on the album, touched by Bush's trademark black humour, was &quot;Heads We're Dancing&quot;, about a woman who dances all night with a charming stranger only to find out that he is <a href="Adolf_Hitler" title="wikilink">Adolf Hitler</a>.</p>
<p>The title track drew its inspiration from <em><a href="Ulysses_(novel)" title="wikilink">Ulysses</a></em> by <a href="James_Joyce" title="wikilink">James Joyce</a>. Bush realised that the <a href="Molly_Bloom&#39;s_Soliloquy" title="wikilink">closing passage</a> of the novel - a monologue by Molly Bloom - fitted the music she had created. When the Joyce estate refused to release the text, Bush wrote original lyrics that echo the original passage, as Molly steps from the pages of the book and revels in the real world.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> She also alluded to <em><a href="And_did_those_feet_in_ancient_time" title="wikilink">Jerusalem</a></em> by <a href="William_Blake" title="wikilink">William Blake</a> with the line &quot;And my arrows of desire rewrite the speech&quot;.</p>
<p>The album contains extensive analogue <a href="overdub" title="wikilink">overdubbing</a>, as evidenced by a notable lack of clarity to the recording.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> The songs &quot;Deeper Understanding&quot;, &quot;Never Be Mine&quot; and &quot;Rocket's Tail&quot; all feature backing vocals by the Bulgarian vocal ensemble the <a href="Trio_Bulgarka" title="wikilink">Trio Bulgarka</a>. <em>The Sensual World</em> went on to become her biggest-selling album in the U.S., receiving a Gold award four years after its release for 500,000 copies sold. In the United Kingdom album charts it reached the number two position.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a></p>
<p>The song &quot;This Woman's Work&quot;, from the movie <em><a href="She&#39;s_Having_a_Baby" title="wikilink">She's Having a Baby</a></em> (1988), was re-edited for this album. On <a href="November_27" title="wikilink">November 27</a>, <a href="2005" class="uri" title="wikilink">2005</a>, it was featured in the British TV drama <em>Walk Away and I Stumble</em>. Due to that broadcast, the song reached the number eight position on the UK download chart.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a> This song has also been used in a long-running UK television advert for the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, broadcast in 2005-2006.</p>
<p><img src="Kate_Bush_The_Red_Shoes.jpg" title="fig: Cover of 1993&#39;s The Red Shoes" alt=" Cover of 1993&#39;s The Red Shoes" width="225" /> <em><a href="The_Red_Shoes_(album)" title="wikilink">The Red Shoes</a></em> was realeased in November 1993. The album takes its title from <a href="The_Red_Shoes_(film)" title="wikilink">the film</a> by <a href="Michael_Powell_(director)" title="wikilink">Michael Powell</a> and <a href="Emeric_Pressburger" title="wikilink">Emeric Pressburger</a>; the story of the film, and the fairy tale by <a href="Hans_Christian_Andersen" title="wikilink">Hans Christian Andersen</a> which in turn inspired it, concerns a dancer possessed by her art who cannot shake off the eponymous shoes and find peace.<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> The album sold more than 3 million copies worldwide.</p>
<p>The musical style was far more simple and direct than on any album since <em>Never For Ever</em>. The initial plan had been to take the songs out on the road and so Bush deliberately aimed for a live band feel, with less of the studio trickery that had typified her last three albums and which would be difficult to recreate on stage. The result alienated some of her fan base who enjoyed the intricacy of her earlier compositions, but others found a new complexity in the lyrics and the emotions they expressed. Gone were the stories and character pieces of her earlier work to be replaced by a set of songs that are almost like a diary. This was a troubled time for Bush. She had suffered a series of bereavements, including the loss of her favoured guitarist, <a href="Alan_Murphy" title="wikilink">Alan Murphy</a> and, most painfully, her mother, Hannah.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a> Many of the people she lost are honoured on the ballad, &quot;Moments Of Pleasure&quot;, as well as <a href="Michael_Powell_(director)" title="wikilink">Michael Powell</a>, whom she had discussed working with shortly before his death. Her long-term relationship with <a href="Del_Palmer" title="wikilink">Del Palmer</a> had also broken down, although the pair continued to work together. Composer and conductor <a href="Michael_Kamen" title="wikilink">Michael Kamen</a> contributed a score for the song which considerably heightened the impact of Bush's vocal and piano rendition.</p>
<p>Most notably, <em>The Red Shoes</em> featured many more high profile cameo appearances than her previous efforts. Comedian <a href="Lenny_Henry" title="wikilink">Lenny Henry</a> provided guest vocals on &quot;Why Should I Love You?,&quot; a track that featured significant contributions from <a href="Prince_(musician)" title="wikilink">Prince</a>. &quot;And So Is Love&quot; features guitar work by <a href="Eric_Clapton" title="wikilink">Eric Clapton</a>. <a href="Gary_Brooker" title="wikilink">Gary Brooker</a>, from the band <a href="Procol_Harum" title="wikilink">Procol Harum</a>, <a href="Trevor_Whittaker" title="wikilink">Trevor Whittaker</a>, and <a href="Jeff_Beck" title="wikilink">Jeff Beck</a> also donated their talents to the recording.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a></p>
<p>A film, <em><a href="The_Line,_the_Cross_&amp;_the_Curve" title="wikilink">The Line, the Cross &amp; the Curve</a></em>, written and directed by Bush, and starring Bush and English actress <a href="Miranda_Richardson" title="wikilink">Miranda Richardson</a>,<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a> was released the same year, featuring six of the songs on the album: &quot;Rubberband Girl&quot;, &quot;And So Is Love&quot;, &quot;The Red Shoes&quot;, &quot;Moments of Pleasure&quot;, &quot;Eat The Music&quot; and &quot;Lily&quot;. The first five were used as promos for the singles.</p>
<p>For the first time since &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; back in 1978, Bush released two different videos to accompany a single. The European video for &quot;Rubberband Girl&quot; was lifted from <em><a href="The_Line,_the_Cross_and_the_Curve" title="wikilink">The Line, the Cross and the Curve</a></em>; Bush recorded a separate one for the single's American release. It features her aping the rock-chick look with big hair, big sunglasses,leather jacket and wind machines as she lobs her microphone stand around. The video is intercut with clips from <em><a href="The_Line,_the_Cross_and_the_Curve" title="wikilink">The Line, the Cross and the Curve</a></em>. The album gave her with her highest position to date in the US, reaching number 28 in the album charts. It reached number two in the UK.<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="present">1995-present</h3>
<p>After the release of <em><a href="The_Red_Shoes_(album)" title="wikilink">The Red Shoes</a></em> in 1993 Bush dropped out of the public eye for many years, although her name occasionally cropped up in the media in connection with rumours of a new album release. The press continued to speculate wildly about what she was up to; they viewed her as an eccentric recluse, sometimes drawing a comparison with <a href="Miss_Havisham" title="wikilink">Miss Havisham</a>, from <a href="Charles_Dickens" title="wikilink">Charles Dickens</a>' <em><a href="Great_Expectations" title="wikilink">Great Expectations</a></em>.<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a> In fact, she was trying to give her young son a normal childhood, away from the world of show business. Bush gave birth to Albert, known as Bertie, fathered by her guitarist and current partner Danny McIntosh, in 1998.<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a> She did not release the news of his birth to the press and it was over two years before the story broke. On the few occasions she has spoken to the press since, she has made it clear that motherhood has made her very happy. The couple and their son currently live in a &lt;U+00A3&gt;1.5 million home on an island on the <a href="Kennet_and_Avon_canal" title="wikilink">Kennet and Avon canal</a> in <a href="Berkshire" class="uri" title="wikilink">Berkshire</a>.<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a></p>
<p><img src="aerial_sm.jpg" title="fig: Cover of 2005&#39;s Aerial" alt=" Cover of 2005&#39;s Aerial" width="225" /> Bush's eighth studio album, <a href="Aerial_(album)" title="wikilink">Aerial</a>, was released on double CD and vinyl on <a href="7_November" title="wikilink">7 November</a>, <a href="2005" class="uri" title="wikilink">2005</a> in the UK and <a href="8_November" title="wikilink">8 November</a> in the <a href="USA" class="uri" title="wikilink">USA</a>, following the release of the single &quot;King of the Mountain&quot; on <a href="24_October" title="wikilink">24 October</a>.<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a> The anticipation leading up to the album's release was immense, with press articles devoted to Bush being printed months before the album's release.<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a> The first single from the album was &quot;<a href="King_of_the_Mountain_(song)" title="wikilink">King of the Mountain</a>&quot;. The song makes references to <a href="Elvis_Presley" title="wikilink">Elvis Presley</a> and the film <em><a href="Citizen_Kane" title="wikilink">Citizen Kane</a></em>, and can be seen as a contemplation on the excesses of fame, some of which are alluded to in the lyrics. The track was played for the first time on <a href="BBC_Radio_2" title="wikilink">BBC Radio 2</a> on <a href="September_21" title="wikilink">September 21</a> <a href="2005" class="uri" title="wikilink">2005</a>, and was made available for download as of <a href="September_27" title="wikilink">September 27</a>.<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a></p>
<p><em>Aerial</em> is one of Bush's most critically acclaimed albums.<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a> Musically, the album is an ambitious and multi-layered work, incorporating elements of <a href="folk_music" title="wikilink">folk</a>, <a href="Renaissance_music" title="wikilink">Renaissance</a>, <a href="European_classical_music" title="wikilink">classical</a>, <a href="reggae" class="uri" title="wikilink">reggae</a>, and <a href="samba" class="uri" title="wikilink">samba</a> into an adventurous pop style. As on 1985's <em><a href="Hounds_of_Love" title="wikilink">Hounds of Love</a></em>, the double album is split into two sections. The first disc, subtitled <em>A Sea of Honey</em>, features a set of unrelated themed songs including the first single &quot;<a href="King_of_the_Mountain_(single)" title="wikilink">King of the Mountain</a>&quot;, a Renaissance-style ode to her son &quot;Bertie&quot;, and &quot;Joanni&quot;, based on the story of <a href="St._Joan_of_Arc" title="wikilink">Joan of Arc</a>. In the song &quot;&lt;U+03C0&gt;&quot;, Bush sings <a href="Pi" title="wikilink">the number</a> to its 137th decimal place, though for an unknown reason, she omits the 79th to 100th decimal places. The piano and vocal piece &quot;A Coral Room&quot;, which deals with the loss of Bush's mother and the passage of time, was hailed by sections of the British media as &quot;stunning&quot; in its simplicity,<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a> &quot;profoundly moving&quot;<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a> and the &quot;one of the most beautiful&quot; pieces Bush has ever recorded.<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a> The second disc, subtitled <em>A Sky of Honey</em>, features thematically related songs linked by the presence of <a href="birdsong" class="uri" title="wikilink">birdsong</a>. The album's cover art, which seems to show a mountain range at sunset over a sea is in fact a <a href="waveform" class="uri" title="wikilink">waveform</a> which represents birdsong. All of the pieces in this suite refer or allude to air or sky in their lyrical content. The song &quot;Nocturn&quot;, which starts with a soft rhythm not unlike the sound of waves at seaside, stands as a metaphorical reference to lovemaking, particularly in its climactic ending bars. &quot;A Sky of Honey&quot; features <a href="Rolf_Harris" title="wikilink">Rolf Harris</a> playing the didgeridoo on one track, as he did on the 1982 single &quot;The Dreaming&quot;, and providing vocals on the track &quot;The Painter's Link&quot;. Other artists guesting on the album include <a href="Peter_Erskine" title="wikilink">Peter Erskine</a>, <a href="Eberhard_Weber" title="wikilink">Eberhard Weber</a>, <a href="Lol_Creme" title="wikilink">Lol Creme</a> and <a href="Procol_Harum" title="wikilink">Procol Harum</a>'s <a href="Gary_Brooker" title="wikilink">Gary Brooker</a>. Two tracks feature string arrangements by the late <a href="Michael_Kamen" title="wikilink">Michael Kamen</a>, performed by the London Metropolitan Orchestra.<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a></p>
<p>On <a href="October_17" title="wikilink">October 17</a>, <a href="2005" class="uri" title="wikilink">2005</a>, &quot;King of the Mountain&quot; entered the UK Downloads Chart at number six<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a> and by <a href="30_October" title="wikilink">30 October</a>, it became her third highest charting single ever in the UK, peaking at number four on the full chart. On <a href="November_13" title="wikilink">November 13</a>, <a href="2005" class="uri" title="wikilink">2005</a>, <em>Aerial</em> entered the UK Albums Chart at number three, selling more than 90,000 copies in its first week on release. Within five months of its release, the album had sold more than 1.1 million copies worldwide, despite very little publicity by Bush herself having only conducted a handful of magazine and radio interviews. <em>Aerial</em> earned Bush two nominations at the 2006 <a href="BRIT_Awards" title="wikilink">BRIT Awards</a>, in the Best British Female Solo Artist and Best British Album categories.<a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a></p>
<p>In an interview with <em>Weekend Australian</em>, published in December 2005, Bush stated that <em><a href="Aerial_(album)" title="wikilink">Aerial</a></em> was not meant to be her last work and that she wished to continue writing and recording music. On <a href="March_13" title="wikilink">March 13</a>, <a href="2006" class="uri" title="wikilink">2006</a>, EMI re-released all of Bush's previous albums, including her greatest hits album <em>The Whole Story</em>, on compact disc with cardboard cases made to look like the original vinyl prints. In 2006, viewers of BBC Two television's <a href="The_Culture_Show" title="wikilink"><em>The Culture Show</em></a> voted Bush one of the UK's top ten &quot;Living Icons&quot;.<a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="musical-style">Musical style</h2>
<p>It has been difficult to define the musical genre of Bush's work due to the fact that there are very few artists like her. She is often compared to female singer/songwriters such as <a href="Joni_Mitchell" title="wikilink">Joni Mitchell</a> and <a href="Bjork" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bjork</a>, but this comparison is derived from those artist's uniqueness rather than the similarity of their music. Her music has also been eclectic, utilising various styles of music even within the same album. Her songs have spanned across genres as diverse as <a href="Rock_music" title="wikilink">rock</a>, <a href="pop_music" title="wikilink">pop</a>, <a href="alternative_music" title="wikilink">alternative</a>, <a href="Indie_(music)" title="wikilink">indie</a>, <a href="Gothic_rock" title="wikilink">goth</a>, <a href="jazz" class="uri" title="wikilink">jazz</a>, <a href="folk_music" title="wikilink">folk</a>, <a href="ska" class="uri" title="wikilink">ska</a>, <a href="samba" class="uri" title="wikilink">samba</a> and <a href="New_Wave_music" title="wikilink">new wave</a>. Even in her earliest works where the <a href="piano" class="uri" title="wikilink">piano</a> was a primary instrument, Bush wove together many diverse influences, melding <a href="European_classical_music" title="wikilink">classical music</a>, <a href="rock_and_roll" title="wikilink">rock</a>, and a wide range of ethnic and <a href="folk_music" title="wikilink">folk</a> sources and this has continued throughout her career.</p>
<p>In an interview with <a href="Melody_Maker" title="wikilink">Melody Maker</a> magazine in 1977, she revealed that male artists had more influence on her work than females, stating &quot;Every female you see at a piano is either <a href="Lynsey_De_Paul" title="wikilink">Lynsey De Paul</a>, <a href="Carole_King" title="wikilink">Carole King</a>. And most male music - not all of it but the good stuff - really lays it on you. It really puts you against the wall and that's what I like to do. I'd like my music to intrude. Not many females succeed with that&quot;.<a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a></p>
<p>The experimental nature of her music has led it to be described as a later, more technological and more accessible manifestation of the British <a href="progressive_rock" title="wikilink">progressive rock</a> movement that gave rise to the bands <a href="Genesis_(band)" title="wikilink">Genesis</a> and <a href="Pink_Floyd" title="wikilink">Pink Floyd</a>.<a href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a> Like artists in the prog rock genre, Bush, at least in the earlier part of her career, rejected the classical American style of making pop music adopted by the majority of UK pop artists. Influenced by the vocal style of the singer <a href="Bryan_Ferry" title="wikilink">Bryan Ferry</a>, Bush sings with an overtly English accent and her lyrics tend to be more unusual and less clich&lt;U+00E9&gt;d than those found American style pop lyrics.<a href="#fn67" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a> The musical instruments used in her songs and the way instruments are played commonly differs from the American norm.<a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a></p>
<p>More than one reviewer has used the term &quot;<a href="surrealism" title="wikilink">surreal</a>&quot; to describe much of her music, for many of the songs have a melodramatic emotional and musical surrealism that defies easy categorization.<a href="#fn69" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref69"><sup>69</sup></a> It has been observed that even the more joyous pieces are often tinged with traces of melancholy, and even the most sorrowful have elements of vitality struggling against all that would oppress it.<a href="#fn70" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a> The unapologetic use of her voice as an instrument to convey a broad range of emotional intensity and subtlety is one thing that characterizes nearly all that she does.<a href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a> Also of note is Bush's insistent use of acoustic drum and percussion textures throughout the years that electronic drum machines became common place in popular recordings.<a href="#fn72" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref72"><sup>72</sup></a></p>
<p>Bush is not afraid to tackle sensitive and taboo subjects.<a href="#fn73" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref73"><sup>73</sup></a> &quot;The Kick Inside&quot; is about an <a href="incest" title="wikilink">incestuous</a> pregnancy and a resulting <a href="suicide" class="uri" title="wikilink">suicide</a>; &quot;Kashka From Baghdad&quot; is a song about a <a href="homosexuality" title="wikilink">gay male</a> couple; &quot;Breathing&quot; explores the results of <a href="nuclear_fallout" title="wikilink">nuclear fallout</a>. Her lyrics are highly literate and reference a wide array of subject-matter, often relatively obscure, such as <a href="Wilhelm_Reich" title="wikilink">Wilhelm Reich</a> in &quot;Cloudbusting&quot; and <a href="G._I._Gurdjieff" title="wikilink">G. I. Gurdjieff</a> in &quot;Them Heavy People&quot; while &quot;Deeper Understanding&quot; from <em>The Sensual World</em> portrays a near-future world where people stay indoors, talking to their computers to the point of obsession.</p>
<p>Comedy is also a big influence on her and is a significant component of her work. She has cited <a href="Woody_Allen" title="wikilink">Woody Allen</a>,<a href="#fn74" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref74"><sup>74</sup></a> <em><a href="Monty_Python" title="wikilink">Monty Python</a></em>, <em><a href="Fawlty_Towers" title="wikilink">Fawlty Towers</a></em> and <em><a href="The_Young_Ones" title="wikilink">The Young Ones</a></em><a href="#fn75" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref75"><sup>75</sup></a> as particular favourites. Horror movies are another favourite of Bush's and have influenced the gothic nature of a number of her song's. Such examples are her songs &quot;Get Out Of My House&quot;, inspired by <a href="Stanley_Kubrick" title="wikilink">Stanley Kubrick</a>'s <a href="The_Shining" title="wikilink">The Shining</a> and &quot;<a href="Hounds_of_Love_(song)" title="wikilink">Hounds of Love</a>&quot; inspired by the 1957 horror movie &quot;Night Of The Demon&quot;.<a href="#fn76" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref76"><sup>76</sup></a> Her songs have occasionally combined comedy and horror to form dark humour, such as dancing with Hitler in the song &quot;Head's We're Dancing&quot; and the upbeat &quot;The Wedding List&quot;, about the death of a couple on their wedding night.</p>
<h2 id="live-performances">Live performances</h2>

<p>Bush's only tour took place in early 1979 (<a href="3_April" title="wikilink">3 April</a>&lt;U+2013&gt;<a href="13_May" title="wikilink">13 May</a>), after which she gave only the occasional live performance. A number of reasons have been suggested as to why she abandoned touring, among them her reputed need to be in total control of the final product, which is incompatible with live stage performance, a rumour of a crippling <a href="fear_of_flying" title="wikilink">fear of flying</a>,<a href="#fn77" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref77"><sup>77</sup></a> and the suggestion that the death of 21-year-old Bill Duffield severely affected her. Duffield, her lighting director, was killed in an accident during her <a href="2_April" title="wikilink">2 April</a> concert at Poole Arts Centre.<a href="#fn78" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref78"><sup>78</sup></a> Bush held a <a href="benefit_concert" title="wikilink">benefit concert</a> on <a href="12_May" title="wikilink">12 May</a>, with <a href="Peter_Gabriel" title="wikilink">Peter Gabriel</a> and <a href="Steve_Harley" title="wikilink">Steve Harley</a> at London's <a href="Hammersmith_Apollo" title="wikilink">Hammersmith Odeon</a> for his family. Bill would be honoured in two later songs: &quot;Blow Away&quot; on <em>Never for Ever</em> and &quot;Moments Of Pleasure&quot; on <em>The Red Shoes</em>. Bush explained in a <a href="BBC_Radio_2" title="wikilink">BBC Radio 2</a> interview with <a href="Mark_Radcliffe" title="wikilink">Mark Radcliffe</a> that she actually enjoyed the tour, but was consumed with producing her subsequent records, being more involved with the recording process than most artists.</p>
<p>During the same period as her tour, she made numerous television appearances around the world. She appeared in <a href="Germany" class="uri" title="wikilink">Germany</a>: <em>Bio's Bahnhof</em> on <a href="9_February" title="wikilink">9 February</a>, <a href="1978" class="uri" title="wikilink">1978</a>; in the <a href="United_Kingdom" title="wikilink">United Kingdom</a>: <em><a href="Top_of_the_Pops" title="wikilink">Top of the Pops</a></em> on <a href="16_February" title="wikilink">16 February</a>, <a href="1978" class="uri" title="wikilink">1978</a>; in the <a href="United_States" title="wikilink">United States</a>: <em><a href="Saturday_Night_Live" title="wikilink">Saturday Night Live</a></em> on <a href="9_December" title="wikilink">9 December</a>, <a href="1978" class="uri" title="wikilink">1978</a> (with <a href="Paul_Shaffer" title="wikilink">Paul Shaffer</a> on piano).<a href="#fn79" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref79"><sup>79</sup></a> The version of the Saturday Night Live show in which she performed that was syndicated and released to home video did not include that performance. Bush also made appearances on Japanese television during this time.</p>
<p>In March 1987, Bush sang &quot;Running Up That Hill&quot; at <a href="The_Secret_Policeman&#39;s_Balls" title="wikilink">The Secret Policeman's Third Ball</a>, with David Gilmour on guitar. In January 2002, Bush appeared with David Gilmour singing &quot;<a href="Comfortably_Numb" title="wikilink">Comfortably Numb</a>&quot; at the <a href="Royal_Festival_Hall" title="wikilink">Royal Festival Hall</a> in London, England.</p>
<h2 id="video-projects">Video projects</h2>
<p>Bush was one of the first musicians to utilise the burgeoning music video industry, creating videos for many of her singles, and even some album tracks that were not issued as singles. <a href="EMI" class="uri" title="wikilink">EMI</a> has released a few collections of her videos, including <em>Live at Hammersmith Odeon</em>, <em>The Single File</em>, <em>Hair of the Hound</em>, <em>The Whole Story</em>, and <em>The Sensual World</em>.</p>
<p>Bush appeared in many innovative music videos, designed to accompany her singles releases.

It was released in 1994 to limited screenings. In recent interviews, Bush has said that she considers it a failure, and stated in 2001 &quot;I'm very pleased with four minutes of it, but I'm very disappointed with the rest.&quot;<a href="#fn81" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref81"><sup>81</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1994, Bush provided the music used in series of <a href="psychedelic" class="uri" title="wikilink">psychedelic</a>-themed television commercials for the soft drink <a href="Fruitopia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Fruitopia</a> that appeared in the <a href="United_States" title="wikilink">United States</a>.

<p>As of March 2007, none of Kate Bush's music videos have been released to DVD in either North America nor Europe, although several had been released on <a href="LaserDisc" class="uri" title="wikilink">LaserDisc</a>.

Beginning in 1982 on the UK's <a href="Channel_4" title="wikilink">Channel 4</a>, <em>Comic Strip Presents</em> offered a series of comedy films featuring comedians including <a href="Rik_Mayall" title="wikilink">Rik Mayall</a>, <a href="Dawn_French" title="wikilink">Dawn French</a>, <a href="Jennifer_Saunders" title="wikilink">Jennifer Saunders</a>, <a href="Adrian_Edmondson" title="wikilink">Adrian Edmondson</a>, <a href="Nigel_Planer" title="wikilink">Nigel Planer</a> and <a href="Robbie_Coltrane" title="wikilink">Robbie Coltrane</a>. The movies are usually written and produced by <a href="Peter_Richardson" title="wikilink">Peter Richardson</a>, who also usually stars. In <em>Les Dogs</em>, which aired on <a href="8_March" title="wikilink">8 March</a>, <a href="1990" class="uri" title="wikilink">1990</a>, Bush plays the bride Angela at a wedding set in a post-apocalyptic version of Britain. Whilst Bush's is a silent presence in a wedding dress throughout most of the film, she does have several lines of dialogue with Peter Richardson in two dream sequences. In another <em>Comic Strip Presents</em> film, <em>GLC</em>, she produced the theme song &quot;Ken&quot; which includes a vocal performance by Bush. She also produced all the incidental music, which is synthesizer based.</p>
<p>In 1985, Bush contributed a darkly melancholic version of the <a href="Ary_Barroso" title="wikilink">Ary Barroso</a> song <a href="Aquarela_do_Brasil" title="wikilink">&quot;Brazil&quot;</a> to the soundtrack of the <a href="Terry_Gilliam" title="wikilink">Terry Gilliam</a> <a href="Brazil_(film)" title="wikilink">film</a> of the same name.

In 1988, the song &quot;This Woman's Work&quot; featured in the <a href="John_Hughes_(film_director)" title="wikilink">John Hughes</a> film <em><a href="She&#39;s_Having_A_Baby" title="wikilink">She's Having A Baby</a></em>, a year before a re-edited version appeared on Bush's album, <em><a href="The_Sensual_World" title="wikilink">The Sensual World</a></em>.</p>
<p>In 1999, Bush wrote and recorded a song for the <a href="Disney" class="uri" title="wikilink">Disney</a> film, <em>Dinosaur</em>, but due to complications the track was ultimately not included on the soundtrack. According to the Winter 1999 issue of <em>HomeGround</em>, a Kate Bush <a href="fanzine" class="uri" title="wikilink">fanzine</a>, it was scrapped when Disney asked Bush to rewrite the song and Bush refused; however, according to Disney, the song was cut from the film when preview audiences did not respond well to the track.<a href="#fn84" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref84"><sup>84</sup></a></p>
