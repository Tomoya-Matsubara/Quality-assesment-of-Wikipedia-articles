Mary wrote the <a href="blank_verse" title="wikilink">blank verse</a> of the drama and Percy contributed two <a href="lyric_poetry" title="wikilink">lyric poems</a>. Composed in 1820 while the Shelleys were living in <a href="Italy" class="uri" title="wikilink">Italy</a>, it is often considered a partner to <em><a href="Midas_(Shelley)" title="wikilink">Midas</a></em>. <em>Proserpine</em> was first published in the <a href="London" class="uri" title="wikilink">London</a> periodical <em>The Winter's Wreath</em> in 1832. Whether or not the drama was ever meant to be staged is a point of debate among scholars.</p>
<p>The drama is based on <a href="Ovid" title="wikilink">Ovid's</a> tale of the abduction of <a href="Proserpina" title="wikilink">Proserpine</a> (Greek: <a href="Persephone" class="uri" title="wikilink">Persephone</a>) by <a href="Pluto_(mythology)" title="wikilink">Pluto</a>, but Mary Shelley rewrote it to focus on the female characters. In a largely <a href="feminist" class="uri" title="wikilink">feminist</a> retelling from <a href="Ceres" title="wikilink">Ceres's</a> (Greek: <a href="Demeter" class="uri" title="wikilink">Demeter</a>) point of view, Shelley emphasises the separation of mother and daughter and the strength provided by a community of women. Ceres represents life and love while Pluto represents death and violence. The <a href="genre" title="wikilink">genres</a> of the text reflect a concern with gender issues as well. Percy's contribution is in the traditionally male-dominated lyric verse form and Mary's drama contains elements common to early nineteenth-century women's writing: details of everyday life and empathetic dialogue.</p>
<p><em>Proserpine</em> is part of a female literary tradition which, as <a href="feminist_literary_criticism" title="wikilink">feminist literary critic</a> <a href="Susan_Gubar" title="wikilink">Susan Gubar</a> describes it, has used the story of Ceres and Proserpine, as a way to &quot;re-define, to re-affirm and to celebrate female consciousness itself&quot;.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>In March 1818 the Shelleys moved to Italy, where within a year their two young children, Clara and William, had both died. Mary entered into a deep depression and became alienated from Percy, who was not as deeply affected by this loss.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> Mary recovered to some extent with the birth of <a href="Percy_Florence_Shelley" title="wikilink">Percy Florence</a> later in 1819.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>Despite the overwhelming grief, Mary continued to study and read as she had throughout her life. Between 1818 and 1820, she absorbed a considerable amount of drama, reading many of <a href="William_Shakespeare" title="wikilink">William Shakespeare&lt;U+2019&gt;s</a> plays, some with Percy.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> Percy believed that Mary had a talent for dramatic writing, and convinced her to study the great English, French, Latin, and Italian plays as well as dramatic theory.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> He even sought her advice regarding his play <em><a href="The_Cenci" title="wikilink">The Cenci</a></em><a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> and she transcribed the manuscript of his drama <em><a href="Prometheus_Unbound_(Shelley)" title="wikilink">Prometheus Unbound</a></em>.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> The Shelleys also attended operas, ballets, and plays.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p>Mary Shelley&lt;U+2019&gt;s studies were broad during these years. She began to learn Greek in 1820<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> and read widely on education. For example, she read <a href="Jean-Jacques_Rousseau" title="wikilink">Jean-Jacques Rousseau&lt;U+2019&gt;s</a> philosophical work on education, <em><a href="Emile:_or,_On_Education" title="wikilink">Emile</a></em> (1762), and his sentimental novel, <em><a href="La_Nouvelle_Heloise" title="wikilink">La Nouvelle H&lt;U+00E9&gt;lo&lt;U+00CF&gt;se</a></em> (1761) as well as <a href="Thomas_Day" title="wikilink">Thomas Day&lt;U+2019&gt;s</a> children&lt;U+2019&gt;s book <em><a href="The_History_of_Sandford_and_Merton" title="wikilink">The History of Sandford and Merton</a></em> (1783&lt;U+2013&gt;89).<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="composition-and-publication">Composition and publication</h2>
<p>In 1820, Mary Shelley composed <em>Proserpine</em>, to which Percy Shelley contributed two <a href="lyric_poem" title="wikilink">lyric poems</a>: &quot;Arethusa&quot; and &quot;Song of Proserpine While Gathering Flowers on the Plain of Enna&quot;. A fragment of the manuscript survives, housed in the <a href="The_Carl_H._Pforzheimer_Collection_of_Shelley_and_His_Circle" title="wikilink">Pforzheimer Collection</a> at the <a href="New_York_Public_Library" title="wikilink">New York Public Library</a>, and demonstrates the couple working side-by-side on the project.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> In her biography of Mary Shelley, Miranda Seymour speculates that both <em>Midas</em> and <em>Proserpine</em> were written for two young girls Mary Shelley met and befriended, Laurette and Nerina Tighe. Daughters of friends of the Shelleys in Italy, their mother was also a former pupil of <a href="Mary_Wollstonecraft" title="wikilink">Mary Wollstonecraft</a>, Mary Shelley's mother.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> That same year, Mary Shelley wrote the story <em><a href="Maurice_(Shelley)" title="wikilink">Maurice</a></em> for Laurette.</p>
<p>In 1824 Mary Shelley submitted the play for publication to <em>The Browning Box</em>, edited by <a href="Bryan_Walter_Procter" title="wikilink">Bryan Walter Procter</a>, but it was rejected. <em>Proserpine</em> was first published in 1832 in the London periodical <em>The Winter's Wreath</em>.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> She cut one-fifth of the play—about 120 lines—for this version, deleting some of the stories from the first act and rewroting individual lines.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> Her efforts to publish the play in these periodicals and journal entries written during the play's composition suggest that <em>Proserpine</em> was meant to be <a href="children&#39;s_literature" title="wikilink">children's literature</a>.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>

<p><em>Prosperine</em> is a <a href="verse_drama" title="wikilink">verse drama</a> in <a href="blank_verse" title="wikilink">blank verse</a> by Mary Shelley which includes two <a href="lyric_poetry" title="wikilink">lyric poems</a> by Percy Shelley. In the early nineteenth century, lyric poetry was associated with male poets and quotidian poetry (i.e., the poetry of the everyday) with female poets. The division of labour in <em>Proserpine</em> reflects this trend.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> Percy&lt;U+2019&gt;s poems help emphasise the mythic nature of Prosperine&lt;U+2019&gt;s story; he continued this transcendental description of Proserpine in <em><a href="Prometheus_Unbound" title="wikilink">Prometheus Unbound</a></em>.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> Mary's drama consists of details, such as carefully-described flowers. Furthermore, her characters do not speak in <a href="soliloquy" class="uri" title="wikilink">soliloquy</a>—except in Percy&lt;U+2019&gt;s poems—rather, &quot;nearly every speech is directed feelingly toward another character and is typically concerned with describing another&lt;U+2019&gt;s emotional state, and/or eliciting an emotional reaction.&quot;<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> Dialogue in <em>Proserpine</em> is founded on empathy, not the conflict more typical of drama.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> Mary Shelley also refused to embrace the visual sensationalism of early nineteenth-century theatre, focusing instead on &quot;scenes of heightened emotion&quot;.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a></p>
<p>Scholars have disputed whether or not Mary Shelley intended for her play to be staged. Most concur that it was never meant for performance, agreeing with Romanticist Alan Richardson that the play is &quot;lyrical drama&quot; or &quot;mental theater&quot; in the style of Romantic <a href="closet_drama" title="wikilink">closet drama</a> &quot;with its emphasis on character over plot, on reaction over action, and its turn away from the theater&quot;.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> However, eighteenth-century theatrical scholar Judith Pascoe challenges this conclusion, pointing to detailed stage directions in the manuscript: &quot;Ceres and her companions are ranged on one side in eager expectation; from the cave on the other, enter Proserpine, attended by various dark &amp; gloomy shapes bearing torches; among with Ascalaphus. Ceres &amp; Persephone embrace;–her nymphs surround her.&quot;<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> From this evidence, she argues that Shelley intended her play to be staged.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a></p>
<p>Literary scholar Jeffrey Cox has argued that <em>Prosperine</em>, along with <em>Midas</em>, <em>Prometheus Unbound</em> and other plays written by the <a href="Leigh_Hunt" title="wikilink">Leigh Hunt</a> circle, were &quot;not a rejection of the stage but an attempt to remake it&quot;.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> Turning from the traditional genres of <a href="tragedy" class="uri" title="wikilink">tragedy</a> and <a href="comedy_of_manners" title="wikilink">comedy of manners</a>, these writers reinvented drama by writing <a href="masque" title="wikilink">masques</a> and <a href="pastoral" class="uri" title="wikilink">pastoral</a> dramas. He argues that <em>Midas</em> and <em>Proserpine</em> is a pair of mythological dramas that dramatizes &quot;the forces of oppression&quot;.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> For him, <em>Proserpine</em> &quot;celebrates a pastoral world...threatened by male sexual violence and the tyranny of a sky god&quot;.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a></p>

<p><img src="RothwellMaryShelley.jpg" title="fig:Mary Shelley&#39;s version of the Proserpine myth is a feminist retelling. (Richard Rothwell, 1840)" alt="Mary Shelley&#39;s version of the Proserpine myth is a feminist retelling. (Richard Rothwell, 1840)" /> Mary Shelley expanded and revised the Roman poet <a href="Ovid" title="wikilink">Ovid's</a> story of Proserpine, which part of his larger <em><a href="Metamorphoses" class="uri" title="wikilink">Metamorphoses</a></em>. The tale is based on the <a href="Greek_mythology" title="wikilink">Greek myth</a> of <a href="Demeter" class="uri" title="wikilink">Demeter</a> and <a href="Persephone" class="uri" title="wikilink">Persephone</a>, which explains the change of the seasons through Proserpine's visits to the Underworld: when she is confined to Pluto's realm, fall and winter cover the earth, and when she returns to live with her mother, spring and summer bloom. The myth depicts the victory of male violence over female procreation.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> Like Percy Shelley, <a href="John_Keats" title="wikilink">John Keats</a>, and <a href="Lord_Byron" title="wikilink">Lord Byron</a>, Mary Shelley was interested in rewriting the classical myths; however, like other Romantic women writers, she was particularly interested in challenging their <a href="patriarchy" class="uri" title="wikilink">patriarchy</a>.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> In revising the Proserpine myth, she placed women and their power at the centre of the narrative. For example, Ovid represents Proserpine as &quot;an unreflective child, willfully straying after flowers in infantile abandon&quot; while &quot;Shelley portrays Proserpine as a thoughtful, empathetic adolescent&quot; who wants to find flowers for her mother.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> Ovid&lt;U+2019&gt;s version of the myth focuses on violence, particularly the abduction and rape of Proserpine, while Shelley&lt;U+2019&gt;s play focuses on the suspenseful search for Proserpine.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> Her version highlights Ceres and the nymphs&lt;U+2019&gt; grief and Proserpine&lt;U+2019&gt;s own desire to escape from the Underworld instead of the rape (the rape happens offstage). In contrast, other nineteenth-century adaptations often expanded the rape scene, romanticising it and turning it into a scene of courtship.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a></p>
<p>Women and women&lt;U+2019&gt;s issues dominate Mary Shelley's drama&lt;U+2014&gt;no male characters appear, with the brief exception of <a href="Ascalaphus" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ascalaphus</a>.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> Although the myth is fundamentally about rape and male tyranny, Shelley transforms it into a story about female solidarity and community&lt;U+2014&gt;these women are storytellers and mythmakers who determine their own fate.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> Shelley tells the story almost entirely from Ceres's point of view; &lt;U+201C&gt;her play elegiacally praises female creativity and fecundity as &lt;U+2018&gt;Leaf, and blade, and bud, and blossom.&lt;U+2019&gt;&lt;U+201D&gt;<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> Shelley writes active, rather than a passive, roles for Proserpine and Ceres. For example, it is Ceres's anger, not her grief, that brings &quot;winter's blight&quot;.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> However, Proserpine&lt;U+2019&gt;s abduction is prefigured in the story of Arethusa and, as literary scholar Julie Carlson points out, the women can only join together after Proserpine has been abducted.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a></p>
<p>In Shelley&lt;U+2019&gt;s version of the myth, paradise is lost not through the fault of women but through the interference of men.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> Pluto's &quot;egotistical, predatory violence&quot; is juxtaposed to Ceres&lt;U+2019&gt;s &quot;loving kindness, her willingness to sustain life, [and] her unswerving devotion to her child&quot;.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> Sex, in this myth, is represented as &quot;a terrifying separation from the female community and grotesque submission to male force&quot;.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> Pluto&lt;U+2019&gt;s domination of Proserpine symbolises &quot;a culture based on acquisition and brutality, a culture that covertly justifies (when it does not overly celebrate) male mastery&quot;.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a></p>
<p><em>Proserpine</em> and <em>Midas</em> are often seen as a pair of contrasting plays. <em>Proserpine</em> is a play of female bonding, while <em>Midas</em> is a male-dominated drama; male poets participate in a contest in <em>Midas</em> while in <em>Proserpine</em> female characters participate in communal storytelling; &quot;where Midas lives in his golden palace imagining himself at the center of an all-powerful court, Ceres laments leaving the pastoral enclave she shares with Proserpine for Jove&lt;U+2019&gt;s court&quot;; Midas focuses on gold, while the women in <em>Proserpine</em> enjoy flowers; and &quot;where the society of <em>Midas</em> is marked by egotism, greed, and strife, the female society of <em>Proserpine</em> values community, gift-giving, and love&quot;.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="legacy-and-reception">Legacy and reception</h2>
<p>As <a href="feminist_literary_criticism" title="wikilink">feminist literary critic</a> <a href="Susan_Gubar" title="wikilink">Susan Gubar</a> argues, Mary Shelley&lt;U+2019&gt;s drama is part of a female literary tradition, including <a href="Elizabeth_Barrett_Browning" title="wikilink">Elizabeth Barrett Browning</a>, <a href="H.D." class="uri" title="wikilink">H.D.</a>, <a href="Toni_Morrison" title="wikilink">Toni Morrison</a>, <a href="Margaret_Atwood" title="wikilink">Margaret Atwood</a>, and <a href="Doris_Lessing" title="wikilink">Doris Lessing</a>, which has responded to the story of Ceres and Proserpine. These writers use the myth as a &quot;way of dealing with their experience of themselves as daughters growing up into womanhood and potential motherhood....they use the myth of Demeter and Persephone to re-define, to re-affirm and to celebrate female consciousness itself.&quot;<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a> Poets such as <a href="Dorothy_Wellesley" title="wikilink">Dorothy Wellesley</a>, <a href="Rachel_Annand_Taylor" title="wikilink">Rachel Annand Taylor</a>, <a href="Babette_Deutsch" title="wikilink">Babette Deutsch</a>, and <a href="Helen_Wolfert" title="wikilink">Helen Wolfert</a> as well as Mary Shelley portray the procreative mother as a heroine who creates an arena for nurturing relationships that challenge &lt;U+201C&gt;the divisions between self and other&lt;U+201D&gt; that rest at the centre of patriarchy.<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a></p>
<p>When A. Koszul first published a transcription of <em>Proserpine</em> in 1922, he argued &quot;that the little classical fancies which Mrs. Shelley never ventured to publish are quite as worthy of consideration as her more ambitious prose works&quot;.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a> However, his &quot;Introduction&quot; to the play speaks mostly of Percy Shelley and his contribution to Mary Shelley's works. In fact, as he explains, he decided to publish in order to contribute to the Percy Shelley centenary.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a> Since their original publication, neither <em>Midas</em> nor <em>Prosperine</em> has received much critical attention. Critics have either paid attention only to Percy Shelley's poems, or they have ignored the plays altogether. Literary critic Elizabeth Nitchie writes that the plays are &quot;distinguished only by the lyrics that [Percy] Shelley wrote for them&quot; and Sylvia Norman contends that they &quot;do not really call for analytical and comparative study&quot;.<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a> However, in the last fifteen years or so, beginning with the publication of the <em>The Other Mary Shelley</em> in 1993, more attention has been paid to Mary Shelley's &quot;other&quot; works, such as her dramas.</p>
