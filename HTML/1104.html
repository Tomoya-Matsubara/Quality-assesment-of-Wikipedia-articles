<h2 id="plot-summary">Plot summary</h2>

<p>The story opens by introducing the <a href="dyspepsia" title="wikilink">dyspeptic</a> <a href="poet" class="uri" title="wikilink">poet</a>, Francis Xavier Enderby. Enderby is in his mid-40's, a lapsed Catholic, who lives alone in <a href="Brighton" class="uri" title="wikilink">Brighton</a> as a 'professional' poet - his income being interest from investments left to him by his stepmother.</p>
<p>Enderby composes his poetry whilst seated on the toilet. His nearby bathtub serving as a filing cabinet is almost full of paper and food scraps that represent his efforts. Although he is recognised as a minor poet with several published works (and even awarded a small prize, the 'Goodby Gold Medal', which he refuses), he has yet to be anthologised.</p>
<p>He is persuaded to leave his bachelor life by the editor of a woman's magazine, one Vesta Bainbridge. Although it transpires that Ms Bainbridge was simply desirous of Enderby's capital, they remain married for almost a year.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Mr. Burgess is so fond of Enderby - by far his best creation - that he has devoted four books to him: <em>Inside Mr. Enderby</em> and <em>Enderby Outside,</em> which were published in 1968, <em>The Clockwork Testament</em> in 1975, and now, <em>Enderby's Dark Lady.</em>&quot; - Anatole Broyard, <em>The New York Times</em>.</p>
