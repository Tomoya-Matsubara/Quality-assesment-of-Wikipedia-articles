Through his father Wagshum Gebre Medhin, he was the heir to the old <a href="Zagwe_dynasty" title="wikilink">Zagwe dynasty</a> and the rulers of <a href="Lasta" class="uri" title="wikilink">Lasta</a>, and his mother was a descendant of the <a href="Solomonic_dynasty" title="wikilink">Solomonic dynasty</a>; he based his claim to the Imperial throne on this dual heritage.</p>
<p>He married <a href="Dinqinesh_Mercha" title="wikilink">Dinqinesh Mercha</a> (c.<a href="1810s" title="wikilink">1815</a> - August <a href="1907" class="uri" title="wikilink">1907</a>), the sister of <a href="Dejazmach" class="uri" title="wikilink">Dejazmach</a> Kassai (the future Emperor <a href="Yohannes_IV_of_Ethiopia" title="wikilink">Yohannes IV</a>), one of his rivals for sole rule after the suicide of Emperor <a href="Tewodros_II_of_Ethiopia" title="wikilink">Tewodros II</a>. (The other was <a href="Menelik_II" title="wikilink">Menelik II</a>, at the time king of <a href="Shewa" class="uri" title="wikilink">Shewa</a>.) She assumed the title of <em>Itege</em> or Empress.</p>
<p>In 1868, Wagshum Gobeze proclaimed himself Emperor Tekle Giyorgis II of Ethiopia at <a href="Soqota" class="uri" title="wikilink">Soqota</a> in his district of <a href="Wag" class="uri" title="wikilink">Wag</a>; however, because <em><a href="Abuna" class="uri" title="wikilink">Abuna</a></em> <a href="Abuna_Selama_III" title="wikilink">Selama</a>, head of the <a href="Ethiopian_Orthodox_Church" title="wikilink">Ethiopian Orthodox Church</a> had died shortly before, and there was no one to properly crown him. Diplomatic appeals to his two rivals failed to gain their acknowledgement of his new rank, so Tekle Giyorgis attempted to assert his claim by force, moving against Dejazmach Kassai. Emperor Tekle Giyorgis crossed the <a href="Takazze_River" title="wikilink">Takazze River</a> in <a href="1871" class="uri" title="wikilink">1871</a>; however, Dejazmach Kassai defeated him near <a href="Adwa" class="uri" title="wikilink">Adwa</a> on <a href="July_11" title="wikilink">July 11</a> of that year, taking him captive along with his sons, and proclaiming himself Emperor of Ethiopia with the name of <a href="Yohannes_IV_of_Ethiopia" title="wikilink">Yohannes IV</a>. Tekle Giyorgis died in captivity at the Abune Gerima monastery at Adwa the next year. Empress Dinqinesh stayed with her husband until his death, but then went to live at the court of her brother Yohannes IV, where she continued to enjoy the title and rank of Empress as her brother was a widower when he was crowned and remained thus until the end of his reign. Empress Dinqinesh remarried and had more children.</p>
<p>Because his rule had a minimal effect on Ethiopian history, some lists of the Emperors of Ethiopia omit including him.</p>
