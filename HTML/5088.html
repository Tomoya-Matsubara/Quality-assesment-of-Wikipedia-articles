<p><strong>Philippe Poisson</strong> (born 1984), better known as <strong>Phil Fish</strong>, is a <a href="French_Canadian" title="wikilink">French Canadian</a> former <a href="indie_games" title="wikilink">indie</a> <a href="video_game_designer" title="wikilink">video game designer</a>, best known for his work on the 2012 <a href="platform_game" title="wikilink">platform game</a> <em><a href="Fez_(video_game)" title="wikilink">Fez</a></em> published by his company, Polytron Corporation. He was born and raised in Quebec, where his experiences with <a href="Nintendo" class="uri" title="wikilink">Nintendo</a> games in his youth would later influence his game design. He studied game design at the Montreal National Animation and Design Centre, and worked at <a href="Ubisoft" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ubisoft</a> and <a href="Artificial_Mind_and_Movement" title="wikilink">Artificial Mind and Movement</a> before starting Polytron in 2008.</p>
<p>Fish was a founding member of <a href="Kokoromi" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kokoromi</a>, a collective that explores experimental gameplay ideas, and organized Montreal's annual GAMMA games events. While <em>Fez</em> was in development, Fish worked on other unreleased games at Polytron, including <em>Super Hypercube</em> and <em>Power Pill</em>.</p>
<p><em>Fez</em> was released in April 2012 to widespread acclaim after a protracted five-year development cycle. Its final phases of development were shown in the 2012 documentary <em><a href="Indie_Game:_The_Movie" title="wikilink">Indie Game: The Movie</a></em>, which brought Fish celebrity unusual for game developers. Following an online argument in July 2013, Fish publicly announced his exit from game development citing long-term mistreatment by the industry.</p>

<p>Phil Fish was born Philippe Poisson<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> in Montreal in 1984.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> He was raised in Quebec. His parents shared their interest in art and gaming with him. When Fish was young, his father translated <em><a href="The_Legend_of_Zelda_(video_game)" title="wikilink">The Legend of Zelda</a></em> into French to share the game with his son. Fish credits these memories as formative, and later cited their influence on <em>Fez</em>.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> He graduated from the 2004 Design and Digital Art for Video Games program at the Montreal NAD (National Animation and Design Centre).<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>Fish began his career at the video game publisher <a href="Ubisoft" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ubisoft</a>,<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> where he worked on <em><a href="Open_Season_(video_game)" title="wikilink">Open Season</a></em> as a level designer.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> He was initially excited for the job but grew disenchanted with their large development teams and working conditions, later describing it as &quot;the worst experience of [his] life&quot;. He was later fired from the company.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p>On May 24, 2006, Fish won the <a href="Artificial_Mind_and_Movement" title="wikilink">Artificial Mind and Movement</a> Award for Best Cut-Scene at the annual NAD Center Awards of Excellence Gala.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a><a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> Later that year, Fish began work as a level designer at Artificial Mind and Movement,<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> where he worked on <a href="video_game_tie-in" title="wikilink">film tie-in games</a><a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> including <em><a href="The_Golden_Compass_(video_game)" title="wikilink">The Golden Compass</a></em>.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<p>Fish is a founding member of <a href="Kokoromi" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kokoromi</a>, a group that designs<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> and promotes experimental video games.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> He led a November 2006 event called GAMMA 01 :: Audio Feed at the Arcadia Festival that featured games based around live sound.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> He planned a similar event, GAMMA 256,<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> for 2007. The third in the series, GAMMA 3D, took place in Montreal in November 2008.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> Fish was invited to present a lecture on GAMMA 01 at the 2007 <a href="Game_Developers_Conference" title="wikilink">Game Developers Conference</a>.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> He wrote a review of the 1999 <em><a href="Legacy_of_Kain:_Soul_Reaver" title="wikilink">Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver</a></em> in the 2007 <em>Space Time Play: Synergies Between Computer Games, Architecture and Urbanism: the Next Level</em>.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> Fish has been characterized by Sean Hollister of <em><a href="The_Verge" title="wikilink">The Verge</a></em> as &quot;notorious for voicing angry, controversial opinions about the state of video games&quot;.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>

<p><img src="Shawn_McGrath,_camping,_2011_(5949213353).jpg" title="fig:Shawn McGrath, 2011" alt="Shawn McGrath, 2011" /> Fish began to work with Toronto-based indie developer <a href="Dyad_(video_game)" title="wikilink">Shawn McGrath</a> on McGrath's idea for a puzzle game that showed 2D views of a 3D space. Fish provided the project's art<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> until the partnership crumbled due to creative differences: Fish wanted their product to be more of a <a href="platform_game" title="wikilink">platform game</a>.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> Fish continued to work on the game in his spare time,<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> and incorporated the idea of <a href="voxel" title="wikilink">voxels</a> (3D pixels), where a 2D pixel could be seen from four sides. The game would become <em><a href="Fez_(video_game)" title="wikilink">Fez</a></em> and the game's design, lore, and art derived from this <a href="game_mechanic" title="wikilink">game mechanic</a>. Fish searched for a programmer on <a href="DeviantArt" class="uri" title="wikilink">DeviantArt</a> and Renaud B&lt;U+00E9&gt;dard, the first person to apply, became the game's programmer.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> <em>Fez</em> was first announced in July 2007<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> and was nominated for two awards at the 2008 <a href="Game_Developers_Conference" title="wikilink">Game Developers Conference</a> <a href="Independent_Games_Festival" title="wikilink">Independent Games Festival</a>.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> Fish's employer, Artificial Mind and Movement, would not let him take leave from work to attend, so Fish quit. He marked this January 2008 moment as &quot;when I became indie&quot;. The game received widespread attention upon its showing at the festival, leading Fish to open Polytron Corporation as a <a href="startup_company" title="wikilink">startup company</a> with a government loan.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a></p>
<p>Polytron later ran out of money,<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> and Fish was considering ending the project until Polytron's Qu&lt;U+00E9&gt;b&lt;U+00E9&gt;cois neighbor, developer-producer <a href="Trapdoor_(company)" title="wikilink">Trapdoor</a>, offered to help Polytron without transferring its intellectual property rights. According to Fish, the partnership saved <em>Fez</em>.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> The game was delayed several times over the next few years<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> for which it received some notoriety.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a></p>
<p><img src="Renaud_B&lt;U+00E9&gt;dard,_cropped.jpg" title="fig:Fez programmer Renaud B&lt;U+00E9&gt;dard, 2013" alt="Fez programmer Renaud B&lt;U+00E9&gt;dard, 2013" /> In late 2009, Polytron presented an <a href="iPhone" class="uri" title="wikilink">iPhone</a> game called <em>Power Pill</em> at Pecha Kucha Montreal. The game features a panacean pill that travels through human bodies as its <a href="player_character" title="wikilink">playable</a> protagonist, and it uses the iPhone's <a href="multi-touch" class="uri" title="wikilink">multi-touch</a> screen. <em><a href="GameSetWatch" class="uri" title="wikilink">GameSetWatch</a></em>{{'s}} Eric Caoili compared it to <em><a href="Soul_Bubbles" title="wikilink">Soul Bubbles</a></em> and <em><a href="Irritating_Stick" title="wikilink">Irritating Stick</a></em>. The game was developed with <a href="Alec_Holowka" title="wikilink">Alec Holowka</a> of Infinite Ammo, and a <a href="level_editor" title="wikilink">level editor</a> was expected to be included.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a></p>
<p>While working on <em>Fez</em>, Fish revived a game project called <em>Super Hypercube</em>, which was based on <a href="Wiimote" class="uri" title="wikilink">Wiimote</a> <a href="motion_capture" title="wikilink">motion capture</a> input and <a href="stereoscopic" class="uri" title="wikilink">stereoscopic</a> navigation. Fish felt the game would work better with the new <a href="Kinect" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kinect</a> motion tracking. The adapted game was a finalist at <a href="Indiecade" class="uri" title="wikilink">Indiecade</a> 2011.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a></p>
<p>Fish and <em>Fez</em> were featured prominently in the 2012 documentary <em><a href="Indie_Game:_The_Movie" title="wikilink">Indie Game: The Movie</a></em>, through which Fish received celebrity unusual for game developers.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> The chronicles the stories of several indie developers at various stages of their games' development cycles, and Fish is shown preparing for <em>Fez</em>{{'s}} booth at <a href="PAX_East" title="wikilink">PAX East</a> in March 2011. The film presents Fish amidst a legal dispute with a former business partner that jeopardizes the game's release.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> The partner, believed to be Jason DeGroot, is portrayed negatively and does not participate onscreen.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> The film also tracks Fish's personal and emotional investment in the game. <em><a href="Eurogamer" class="uri" title="wikilink">Eurogamer</a></em> wrote that the part where Fish resolves to kill himself if he does not release his game is &quot;the film's most startling moment&quot;.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> <em><a href="Rock,_Paper,_Shotgun" title="wikilink">Rock, Paper, Shotgun</a></em> wrote that Fish is portrayed as melodramatic, theatrical, and neurotic, and that the film will exacerbate his outspoken public perception.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> <em><a href="Game_Informer" title="wikilink">Game Informer</a></em> called Fish the film's &quot;most memorable developer&quot;.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> The film's end credits were later corrected to reflect that Fish's business partner was not asked for input.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a></p>
<p>Near the end of development, Fish felt &quot;burnt out&quot; and that his personal health had suffered.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> <em>Fez</em> was released on April 13, 2012 and sold 200,000 copies in its yearlong exclusivity to the Xbox Live Arcade platform.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> The video game review aggregator <a href="Metacritic" class="uri" title="wikilink">Metacritic</a> described reviews for the 2012 Xbox 360 <em>Fez</em> as &quot;generally favorable&quot;<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> and those for the 2013 PC version as &quot;universal acclaim&quot;.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> While in development, <em>Fez</em> had won the 2012 GDC Independent Games Festival's Seamus McNally Grand Prize,<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a> the 2011 Indiecade Best in Show and Best Story/World Design,<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> and the 2008 GDC Independent Games Festival's Excellence in Visual Art.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a> <em>Eurogamer</em> awarded <em>Fez</em> a perfect score<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a> and named the &quot;perfect, wordless <a href="sci-fi" class="uri" title="wikilink">sci-fi</a> <a href="parable" class="uri" title="wikilink">parable</a>&quot; their 2012 <a href="Game_of_the_Year" title="wikilink">Game of the Year</a>.<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a> Fish announced eventual ports for {{&quot;'}}pretty much' every platform&quot; but the <a href="Nintendo_3DS" title="wikilink">Nintendo 3DS</a>.<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a> It sold one million copies by the end of 2013.<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a> <em><a href="The_New_York_Times" title="wikilink">The New York Times</a></em>{{'s}} Chris Suellentrop called Fish &quot;a <a href="Quentin_Tarantino" title="wikilink">Quentin Tarantino</a> of <a href="8-bit_era" title="wikilink">8-bit gaming</a>&quot;.<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a></p>

<p>A <em>Fez</em> sequel was announced as &quot;<a href="one_more_thing" title="wikilink">one more thing</a>&quot; at end of the Horizon indie game press conference during the June 2013 <a href="Electronic_Entertainment_Expo" title="wikilink">Electronic Entertainment Expo</a>.<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a> A Twitter argument between Fish and <em><a href="GameTrailers" class="uri" title="wikilink">GameTrailers</a></em> journalist Marcus Beer a month later culminated in the project's cancellation and Fish's exit from the industry. In an episode of his show <em><a href="Invisible_Walls" title="wikilink">Invisible Walls</a></em>, Beer had criticized Fish's recent response to questions about Microsoft's <a href="Xbox_One" title="wikilink">Xbox One</a> self-publishing policy change. On Twitter, Fish condemned the industry for its negativity before his final tweet announced the cancellation and his leave.<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a> The news came as a surprise to the rest of Polytron,<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a> which has not commented on upcoming projects other than ports since the sequel's cancellation.<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a> <em>Polygon</em> listed Fish in their top 50 newsmakers of 2013 for the social power of his &quot;caustic use of Twitter&quot;.<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a></p>
