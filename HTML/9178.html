<p><a href="Radegund" class="uri" title="wikilink">Radegund</a> was a 6th-century <a href="Franks" title="wikilink">Frankish</a> princess, who founded the monastery of the Holy Cross at <a href="Poitiers" class="uri" title="wikilink">Poitiers</a>. Between 1159 and 1161 <a href="Malcolm_IV_of_Scotland" title="wikilink">Malcolm IV of Scotland</a>, as <a href="Earl_of_Huntingdon" title="wikilink">Earl of Huntingdon</a>, gave to the nuns 10 acres adjoining Grenecroft (<a href="Midsummer_Common" title="wikilink">Midsummer Common</a>) on which to place their church; the dedication to St Mary and St Radegund was probably connected with Malcolm's visit to Poitiers, 'the special centre of the cult of St Radegund', in 1159.</p>
<p><a href="Jesus_College,_Cambridge" title="wikilink">Jesus College</a> was founded in 1496 on the site by Bishop John Alcock of Ely. It has been traditionally believed that the nunnery was turned into a college because the nunnery had gained a reputation for <a href="promiscuity" title="wikilink">licentiousness</a>. The College's full name is &quot;The College of the Blessed Virgin Mary, Saint John the Evangelist and the glorious Virgin Saint Radegund, near Cambridge&quot;.</p>
<p>When founded in 1496, the College took over the buildings of the nunnery: namely the Chapel, and the Cloister attached to it; the nuns&lt;U+2019&gt; refectory, which became the college hall; and the former lodging of the prioress, which became the Master&lt;U+2019&gt;s Lodge. These conventual buildings remains the core of the College and account for its distinctly monastic character which sets it apart from other Cambridge colleges. A library was soon added, and the Chapel was considerably modified and reduced in scale by Alcock. Founded in the mid-12th century, the Chapel is the oldest university building in Cambridge still in use.</p>
