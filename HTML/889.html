In the early 1980s, it became the first independent labor union in a <a href="Soviet_bloc" title="wikilink">Soviet-bloc</a> country. Solidarity gave rise to a broad <a href="anti-communist" class="uri" title="wikilink">anti-communist</a> <a href="nonviolent" class="uri" title="wikilink">nonviolent</a> <a href="social_movement" title="wikilink">social movement</a> that, at its height, united some 10 million members and vastly contributed to the <a href="fall_of_communism" title="wikilink">fall of communism</a>.</p>
<p><a href="People&#39;s_Republic_of_Poland" title="wikilink">Poland's communist government</a> attempted to destroy the union by instituting <a href="Martial_law_in_Poland" title="wikilink">martial law</a> in 1981, followed by several years of political repression, but in the end was forced to begin negotiating with the union. The <a href="Roundtable_Talks" title="wikilink">Roundtable Talks</a> between the weakened government and the Solidarity-led opposition resulted in <a href="Polish_legislative_elections,_1989" title="wikilink">semi-free elections in 1989</a>. By the end of August 1989, a Solidarity-led coalition government had been formed, and, in December 1990, Wa&lt;U+0142&gt;&lt;U+0119&gt;sa <a href="Polish_presidential_election,_1990" title="wikilink">was elected</a> <a href="President_of_Poland" title="wikilink">president</a>. This was soon followed by the dismantling of the communist governmental system and by Poland's transformation into a modern <a href="democratic" class="uri" title="wikilink">democratic</a> state. Solidarity's survival meant a break in the hard-line stance of the <a href="communist" class="uri" title="wikilink">communist</a> <a href="Polish_United_Workers&#39;_Party" title="wikilink">Polish United Workers' Party</a> (<em>PZPR</em>), and was an unprecedented event not only for the <a href="People&#39;s_Republic_of_Poland" title="wikilink">People's Republic of Poland</a>&lt;U+2014&gt;a <a href="satellite_state" title="wikilink">satellite</a> of the <a href="USSR" class="uri" title="wikilink">USSR</a> ruled by a <a href="Single-party_state" title="wikilink">one-party</a> <a href="communist_state" title="wikilink">communist regime</a>&lt;U+2014&gt;but for the whole of the <a href="Eastern_bloc" title="wikilink">Eastern bloc</a>. Solidarity's example led to the spread of anti-communist ideas and movements throughout the countries of the Eastern Bloc, weakening their communist governments; a process that eventually culminated in the <a href="Revolutions_of_1989" title="wikilink">Revolutions of 1989</a> (the &quot;Autumn of Nations&quot;).</p>
<p>In the 1990s, Solidarity's influence on <a href="Politics_of_Poland" title="wikilink">Poland's political scene</a> waned. A political arm of the &quot;Solidarity&quot; movement, <a href="Akcja_Wyborcza_Solidarno&lt;U+015B&gt;&lt;U+0107&gt;" title="wikilink">Solidarity Electoral Action</a> (<em>AWS</em>), was founded in 1996 and would win the Polish parliamentary <a href="Polish_parliamentary_election,_1997" title="wikilink">elections in 1997</a>, only to lose the subsequent, <a href="Polish_parliamentary_election,_2001" title="wikilink">2001 elections</a>. As of 2006 the Solidarity has little political influence and is more active as a traditional trade union.</p>

<p>In the 1970s and 1980s, the initial success of Solidarity in particular, and of <a href="dissident" class="uri" title="wikilink">dissident</a> movements in general, was fed by a deepening crisis within Soviet-style societies brought about by declining morale, worsening economic conditions (a <a href="shortage_economy" title="wikilink">shortage economy</a>), and the growing stresses of the <a href="Cold_War" title="wikilink">Cold War</a>.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a><img src="Pope-poland.jpg" title="fig:Millions cheered Pope John Paul II during his first visit to Poland as pontiff (1979)." alt="Millions cheered Pope John Paul II during his first visit to Poland as pontiff (1979)." width="400" /> After a brief period of economic boom, from 1975 the policies of the Polish government, led by Party First Secretary <a href="Edward_Gierek" title="wikilink">Edward Gierek</a>, precipitated a slide into increasing depression, as <a href="foreign_debt" title="wikilink">foreign debt</a> mounted.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> In June 1976, the first workers' strikes took place, involving violent incidents at factories in <a href="Radom" class="uri" title="wikilink">Radom</a> and <a href="Ursus_(district_in_Warsaw)" title="wikilink">Ursus</a>.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> When these incidents were quelled by the government, the worker's movement received support from <a href="intelligentsia" title="wikilink">intellectual dissidents</a>, many of them associated with the <a href="Workers&#39;_Defence_Committee" title="wikilink">Committee for Defense of the Workers</a> (, abbreviated <em>KOR</em>), formed in 1976.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a><a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> The following year, <em>KOR</em> was renamed the <a href="Committee_for_Social_Self-defence" title="wikilink">Committee for Social Self-defence</a> (<em>KSS-KOR</em>).</p>

Far from supporting Wa&lt;U+0142&gt;&lt;U+0119&gt;sa, Solidarity was becoming increasingly critical of the government, and decided to create its own political party for action in the upcoming <a href="Polish_parliamentary_election,_1991" title="wikilink">1991 parliamentary elections</a>.<a href="#fn145" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref145"><sup>145</sup></a></p>

<p>It was in the ensuing <a href="Polish_parliamentary_election,_1993" title="wikilink">1993 parliamentary elections</a> that it became evident how much Solidarity's support had eroded in the previous three years. Even though some Solidarity deputies sought to assume a more left-wing stance and to distance themselves from the right-wing government, Solidarity remained identified in the public mind with that government. Hence it suffered from the growing disillusionment of the populace, as the transition from a communist to a capitalist system failed to generate instant wealth and raise Poland's <a href="living_standards" title="wikilink">living standards</a> to those in the West, and the government's financial &quot;<a href="shock_therapy" title="wikilink">shock therapy</a>&quot; (the <a href="Balcerowicz_Plan" title="wikilink">Balcerowicz Plan</a>) generated much opposition.<a href="#fn147" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref147"><sup>147</sup></a><a href="#fn148" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref148"><sup>148</sup></a></p>
<p>In the elections, Solidarity received only 4.9% of the votes, 0.1% less than the 5% required in order to enter parliament (Solidarity still had 9 senators, 2 fewer then in the previous <a href="Senate_of_Poland" title="wikilink">Senate</a>). The victorious party was the <a href="Democratic_Left_Alliance" title="wikilink">Democratic Left Alliance</a> (<em>Sojusz Lewicy Demokratycznej</em> or <em>SLD</em>), a <a href="post-communist" class="uri" title="wikilink">post-communist</a> <a href="left-wing" class="uri" title="wikilink">left-wing</a> party.<a href="#fn149" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref149"><sup>149</sup></a></p>
<p>Solidarity now joined forces with its erstwhile enemy, the <a href="All-Polish_Agreement_of_Trade_Unions" title="wikilink">All-Polish Conference of Trade Unions</a> (<em>OPZZ</em>), and some protests were organized by both trade unions.<a href="#fn150" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref150"><sup>150</sup></a> The following year, Solidarity organized many strikes over the state of the Polish mining industry. In 1995, a demonstration before the Polish parliament was broken up by the police (now again known as <em><a href="policja" class="uri" title="wikilink">policja</a></em>) using batons and water guns. Nonetheless, Solidarity decided to support Wa&lt;U+0142&gt;&lt;U+0119&gt;sa in the <a href="Polish_presidential_election,_1995" title="wikilink">1995 presidential elections</a>.</p>
<p>In a second major defeat for the Polish <a href="right_wing" title="wikilink">right wing</a>, the elections were won by an <em>SLD</em> candidate, <a href="Aleksander_Kwa&lt;U+015B&gt;niewski" title="wikilink">Aleksander Kwa&lt;U+015B&gt;niewski</a>, who received 51.72% of votes. A Solidarity call for new elections went unheeded, but the <a href="Sejm" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sejm</a> still managed to pass a resolution condemning the 1981 martial law (despite the <em>SLD</em> voting against). Meanwhile the left-wing <em>OPZZ</em> trade union had acquired 2.5 millions members, twice as many as the contemporary Solidarity (with 1.3 millions).<a href="#fn151" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref151"><sup>151</sup></a></p>
