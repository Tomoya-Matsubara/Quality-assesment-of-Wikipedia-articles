<p>The <strong>New World Amusement Park</strong> () was the first of three <a href="amusement_park" title="wikilink">amusement parks</a>, along with <a href="Great_World_Amusement_Park" title="wikilink">Great World</a> (estd. early 1930s) and <a href="Gay_World_Amusement_Park" title="wikilink">Gay World</a> (estd. 1936), that wooed <a href="Malaya" class="uri" title="wikilink">Malaya</a> and Singapore night crowds from the 1920s to the 1960s. New World was a prominent <a href="landmark" class="uri" title="wikilink">landmark</a> in <a href="Jalan_Besar" title="wikilink">Jalan Besar</a>, as it occupied a large area of 45,000 <a href="square_feet" title="wikilink">square feet</a> in size. Before the <a href="advent" class="uri" title="wikilink">advent</a> of televisions and radios, it attracted people from all walks of life from labourers to <a href="Europe" title="wikilink">Europeans</a> with its exciting attractions such as <a href="striptease" class="uri" title="wikilink">striptease</a>, <a href="cabaret" class="uri" title="wikilink">cabaret</a> girls, <a href="opera" class="uri" title="wikilink">opera</a> shows and <a href="boxing" class="uri" title="wikilink">boxing</a> matches during its heyday. Of all the <a href="artiste" title="wikilink">artistes</a> and <a href="Sportsperson" title="wikilink">athletes</a> who have performed at the New World through the years, four have left a lasting impression &lt;U+2014&gt; striptease queen Rose Chan, wrestler King Kong, strongman Mat Tarzan and boxer Felix Boy.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> Due to poor business in the ensuing decades, the park was finally closed after it was sold to a property developer for redevelopment in 1987.</p>

<h3 id="pioneer-amusement-park">Pioneer amusement park</h3>
<p>New World was set up in 1923 by two <a href="Straits_Chinese" title="wikilink">Straits Chinese</a> brothers, <a href="Ong_Boon_Tat" title="wikilink">Ong Boon Tat</a> and Ong Peng Hock under the company Ong Sam Leong Ltd.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> In the 1930s, the <a href="Shaw_Organisation" title="wikilink">Shaw Organisation</a> expanded their leisure business with a 50% <a href="joint_venture" title="wikilink">joint venture</a> with Ong Sam Leong Ltd. Shaw eventually bought out their partner and owned both the New World and the Great World at Kim Seng Road.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> Admission fee is only 10 cent per entry but visitors had to pay separately for its various entertainment programmes and hawker stalls within. Advertising itself as the &quot;pioneer amusement park in <a href="Malaya" class="uri" title="wikilink">Malaya</a>&quot;, New World had a huge <a href="fairground" class="uri" title="wikilink">fairground</a> for all walks of life; couples would go to the park for evening strolls, housewives frequented the food and diverse stalls, men would hop from the barber shops to the nightclubs, while families piled into the cinemas and onto fairground rides like <a href="ferris_wheels" title="wikilink">ferris wheels</a> and <a href="carousels" class="uri" title="wikilink">carousels</a> where two of its <a href="Amusement_ride" title="wikilink">rides</a>, the <em>Ghost Train</em> and <em>Dodg'em</em> were crowd-pullers.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> In 1934, <a href="Dato_Roland_St._John_Braddell" title="wikilink">Dato Roland St. John Braddell</a>, who was born in Singapore and served as Municipal Commissioner (1914&lt;U+2014&gt;1929) wrote:</p>

<h3 id="taxi-girls">'Taxi-girls'</h3>
<p>At New World, a great numbers of men would come daily to &quot;<a href="ronggeng" class="uri" title="wikilink">ronggeng</a>&quot; (<a href="Malay_language" title="wikilink">Malay</a> word for &quot;social dance&quot;) or <a href="cha-cha" class="uri" title="wikilink">cha-cha</a> with <a href="cheongsam" class="uri" title="wikilink">cheongsam</a>-clad cabaret girls, known as 'taxi-girls' as they could be &quot;hired&quot; for dancing by anyone with a coupon. The dance floor could hold up to 500 twirling couple and each dance was registered on a card. Three dances cost a dollar and the girls are only paid 8 cents per dance.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> The early birds would secure the best dancers or their favourite ones and also got seats nearest to the dancing girls. The girls were usually local or hailed from <a href="Hong_Kong" title="wikilink">Hong Kong</a>, <a href="Thailand" class="uri" title="wikilink">Thailand</a> and <a href="Philipines" class="uri" title="wikilink">Philipines</a>. The girls were not <a href="call-girl" title="wikilink">call-girls</a>; no naughty business was expected or allowed by their male partners.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> Watchful <a href="Bouncer_(doorman)" title="wikilink">bouncers</a> would ensure that such <a href="decorum" class="uri" title="wikilink">decorum</a> was followed and they would not hesitate to throw out any trouble-makers or drunks found in the premises. Bruce Lockhart, a <a href="United_Kingdom" title="wikilink">British</a> army <a href="military_intelligence" title="wikilink">intelligence</a> officer-cum-<a href="journalist" class="uri" title="wikilink">journalist</a>, described his visit to the New World's dance hall:</p>

<h3 id="world-war-ii">World War II</h3>
<p>During the <a href="Japanese_Occupation_of_Singapore" title="wikilink">Japanese Occupation</a>, New World was renamed <em>Shin Segal</em> and turned into a gambling farm opened only to <a href="civilian" title="wikilink">civilians</a> but not Japanese soldiers.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> As commodities were scarce during the Occupation, the park was also turned into a <a href="black_market" title="wikilink">black market</a> selling necessities at inflated prices.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="striptease">Striptease</h3>
<p>After the war, the park roared back into life again when it was widely patronised by <a href="Allied" class="uri" title="wikilink">Allied</a> soldiers and returning <a href="expatriate" title="wikilink">expatriates</a> with their families. With the departure of those troops that resulted in much lower takings, the park decided to come up with a new attraction in 1949 &lt;U+2014&gt; <a href="striptease" class="uri" title="wikilink">striptease</a>. Madame Tai Fong, a former singer and dancer, started the <em>Fong Fong Revue</em>, introducing new dances and comedy routines, with exciting costumes for her girls that became the first known striptease public entertainment in Singapore. Her <a href="revue" title="wikilink">revues</a> were soon pulling in huge crowds; the crowds got worse to the point that the <a href="British_Empire" title="wikilink">colonial</a> police had to moved in to manage crowd control and issuing a final warning that &quot;this monkey business must cease&quot;.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> Striptease was thus stopped in its tracks but in time, it resurfaced back in New World again when Rose Chan took over the centrestage in the 1950s.</p>
<h4 id="rose-chan">Rose Chan</h4>
<p>Rose Chan Wai Cheng, who was <a href="China" class="uri" title="wikilink">China</a>-born but locally raised, took up her striptease act when she was 27. She was known as the local <em>Queen of Strip</em> and took her acts around the three Worlds.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> She was famous for her <a href="python" class="uri" title="wikilink">python</a> act; in which she cavorted with a large and sinuous python, coiling it provocatively round her bare body.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> Despite being labelled by conservatives as a 'rebel'; she was kind hearted and gave money to <a href="charities" class="uri" title="wikilink">charities</a> and <a href="orphanage" title="wikilink">orphanages</a>.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> She gave up her striptease career when she embarked on a new career &lt;U+2014&gt; operating a hotel and restaurant in Jalan Raja Laut, <a href="Kuala_Lumpur" title="wikilink">Kuala Lumpur</a> in 1976.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> In 1989, she died of <a href="cancer" class="uri" title="wikilink">cancer</a> at the age of 62 in <a href="Penang" class="uri" title="wikilink">Penang</a> but her memory lingers. A movie based on her life will be made in 2008 by <a href="Royston_Tan" title="wikilink">Royston Tan</a>, a local <a href="Film_director" title="wikilink">movie director</a> of <em><a href="881_(film)" title="wikilink">881</a></em> movie fame.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="wrestler-king-kong">Wrestler 'King Kong'</h3>
<p>A <a href="Hungary" title="wikilink">Hungarian</a>-born professional <a href="wrestler" class="uri" title="wikilink">wrestler</a>, Emile Czaya, who weighed 236kg in his prime and was often described as the &quot;King Kong&quot; or the &quot;Hungarian Behemoth&quot;.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> An actor in his younger days, he took the name of &quot;King Kong&quot; after acting as the <a href="gorilla" class="uri" title="wikilink">gorilla</a> in the film of the same name. He won the <a href="heavyweight" class="uri" title="wikilink">heavyweight</a> wrestling title of <a href="Europe" class="uri" title="wikilink">Europe</a> three times and the <a href="middleweight" class="uri" title="wikilink">middleweight</a> title once.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> In 1938, he went to Singapore at the age of 19 with a troupe of European wrestlers to perform at the New World. Known for being &quot;the meanest&quot; amongst the wrestlers at New World, a former spectator, Abdul Wahab Mohamad said King Kong was the wrestler fans just loved to hate:</p>

<p>On 12 March 1970, Czaya was driving back to Singapore after a bout in Penang when his car crashed into a wall in <a href="Ipoh" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ipoh</a> and he was badly injured. He was moved to the <a href="Singapore_General_Hospital" title="wikilink">Outram Road General Hospital</a> in Singapore but died on May 15 at the age of 61.</p>
<h3 id="strongman-mat-tarzan">Strongman 'Mat Tarzan'</h3>
<p>Ali Ahmad, better known as Mat Tarzan (or &quot;Tarzan of Malaya&quot;), was a well-known <a href="Malaysia" title="wikilink">Malaysian</a> strongman. Mat hailed from Penang and was the son of the late Haji Ali, who used to be a <a href="chef" class="uri" title="wikilink">chef</a> at Kedah House, now known as Istana Kedah in Jalan Sultan Ahmad Shah.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> During his prime, his famous feats included pulling with his teeth a <a href="lorry" class="uri" title="wikilink">lorry</a> carrying 15 adults which would weigh about three <a href="ton" title="wikilink">tons</a>, and bending <a href="iron" class="uri" title="wikilink">iron</a> bars across his throat. He could also lift 73 <a href="kilogram" class="uri" title="wikilink">kilogram</a> of <a href="weights" class="uri" title="wikilink">weights</a> from the floor with his teeth and dive through a burning wooden frame spiked with eight sharp blades and wrestled with full-grown pythons.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
<p>He had won various <a href="bodybuilding" class="uri" title="wikilink">bodybuilding</a> tiltes such as <em>Mr Penang Health Culture League</em> in 1959, 1960 and 1961, <em>Mr Body Beautiful</em> in 1963 and <em>Mr Penang</em> in 1966.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> Mat Tarzan was also a good cook in his own right, having picked up some useful <a href="culinary" class="uri" title="wikilink">culinary</a> skills from his father, specialising in Malay dishes such as 'mee bandung', ox-tail soup and <a href="satay" class="uri" title="wikilink">satay</a> which he ran a chain of food stalls in <a href="Malaysia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Malaysia</a> since the 1960s to the present day.</p>
<h3 id="boxer-felix-boy">Boxer 'Felix Boy'</h3>
<p>New World also hosted weekly <a href="boxing" class="uri" title="wikilink">boxing</a> tournaments with fighters from Thailand, Philipines, <a href="Australia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Australia</a>, as well as local <a href="pugilist" title="wikilink">pugilists</a>. Malaysian boxer Felix Boy, who was born S. Sinniah, became a household name in the early 1960s. He stood just 1.5 <a href="metres" class="uri" title="wikilink">metres</a> tall but packed a terrific wallop in both fists and often despatched his taller opponents by the second or third round in the <a href="flyweight" class="uri" title="wikilink">flyweight</a> and <a href="bantamweight" class="uri" title="wikilink">bantamweight</a> divisions. Out of 84 fights, he lost two &lt;U+2014&gt; both to Thai boxers.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>
<p>Sinniah had a tragic childhood. At the age of five, his parents were captured and sent by the <a href="Empire_of_Japan" title="wikilink">Japanese</a> to work on the <a href="Death_Railway" title="wikilink">Death Railway</a> in Thailand, and they died there. As a result, he and his elder brother, Shanmugam, were taken in by an <a href="orphanage" class="uri" title="wikilink">orphanage</a>. At nine, he used to watch a skilful Thai boxer in action at New World and that was the beginning of his interest in boxing. A <a href="French_people" title="wikilink">French</a> <a href="Priesthood_(Catholic_Church)" title="wikilink">priest</a>, Father Louis Ribaud of the St Joseph's Orphanage in Jalan Penang where Sinniah grew up, gave him the name of &quot;Felix Boy&quot; which was to bring him fame and glory in the <a href="Boxing_ring" title="wikilink">ring</a> in later years.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="other-celebrities">Other celebrities</h3>
<p>New World was also the place where <a href="Sakura_Teng" title="wikilink">Sakura Teng</a>, a well-known 1970s <a href="Malaysia" title="wikilink">Malaysian</a> songbird, launched her music career at age 17. During her heyday in the 1960s and 1970s, the <em>A go-go Queen</em> as she was nicknamed, cut more than 50 <a href="Gramophone_record" title="wikilink">records</a> and was best known for her <a href="yodelling" class="uri" title="wikilink">yodelling</a>.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> The late popular stand-up <a href="Double_act" title="wikilink">comics</a>, <a href="Wang_Sa_and_Ye_Fong" title="wikilink">Wang Sa and Ye Fong</a>, held their regular stage shows at New World too.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="closure">Closure</h3>
<p>New World faded from the night scene after the 1960s in the face of rival entertainment attractions such as shopping centres, <a href="disco" title="wikilink">discos</a> and particularly television which took off locally in 1963.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> In April 1987, New World finally closed when Shaw Organisation sold the <a href="Freehold_(real_property)" title="wikilink">freehold</a> site for <a href="S$" class="uri" title="wikilink">S$</a>35 million (<a href="US$" class="uri" title="wikilink">US$</a> 23 million), to City Developments, a property firm owned by <a href="Kwek_Leng_Beng" title="wikilink">Kwek Leng Beng</a> and his family for future commercial redevelopment.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a></p>

<p>Today, the site where the park sat is being developed by City Developments for its City Square project, comprising a 910-unit <a href="condominium" class="uri" title="wikilink">condominium</a>, a eight-storey shopping mall and a public park.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> The park, which is to be completed in 2009, will feature the original gate to the former New World.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a></p>
