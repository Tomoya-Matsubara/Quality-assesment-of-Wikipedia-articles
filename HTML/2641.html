He's carrying himself a lot differently. He's got more pep in his step and he's a lot more confident. He knows that he is the man for us, and needs to be kind of like our enforcer as well as our go-to guy. If he stays comfortable in that role, we look for Brian to have just a huge senior season. A lot of our success will be based around a lot of what he can do on both ends of the floor for us.&quot; Qvale finished his stint with Montana averaging a team-high 7.1 rebounds per game, and became the second-leading scorer with 10.2 points each game. He ranked as one of the top shot-blockers in Big Sky Conference history.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
