<h2 id="military-career">Military career</h2>
<p><img src="gen-hawise2.jpg" title="fig:Gen. Wise during the American Civil War." alt="Gen. Wise during the American Civil War." /> Wise served as a brigadier general in the <a href="Confederate_States_Army" title="wikilink">Confederate Army</a>. He commanded the District of <a href="Roanoke_Island" title="wikilink">Roanoke Island</a> during the <a href="Battle_of_Roanoke_Island" title="wikilink">Battle of Roanoke Island</a>. His part in the decision to cede the island when faced with much greater Union forces drew the ire of some of the Confederate government leadership. </p>
<p>His forces were attached to the division of Maj. Gen. <a href="Theophilus_H._Holmes" title="wikilink">Theophilus H. Holmes</a> during the <a href="Seven_Days_Battles" title="wikilink">Seven Days Battles</a>. For the rest of 1862 and 1863 he held various commands in North Carolina and Virginia. In 1864 Wise was in command of a brigade in the Department of North Carolina &amp; Southern Virginia. His brigade defended Petersburg and was credited with saving the city at the <a href="First_Battle_of_Petersburg" title="wikilink">First Battle of Petersburg</a> and to an extent at the <a href="Second_Battle_of_Petersburg" title="wikilink">Second Battle of Petersburg</a>.

<h2 id="postbellum-activities">Postbellum activities</h2>
<p>After the war Wise resumed his law practice in Richmond, and settled there for the rest of his life. In 1865 he was unable to reclaim Rolleston, his plantation outside <a href="Norfolk" class="uri" title="wikilink">Norfolk</a>, before he received pardon from the president. After Wise entered Confederate service, he and his family abandoned Rolleston in 1862 as Union troops were taking over Norfolk. Wise arranged then for residence for his family in <a href="Rocky_Mount" title="wikilink">Rocky Mount</a>, <a href="Franklin_County,_Virginia" title="wikilink">Franklin County, Virginia</a>.</p>
<p>As a result, Maj. Gen. Terry of the U.S. command in the Norfolk area did not permit Wise to reclaim the Rolleston property. In an exchange of letters published in the <em>New York Times</em>, Terry stated that under conditions of parole, Wise had claim only to the Rocky Mount property where he had been living when he went to war. The <a href="Freedmen&#39;s_Bureau" title="wikilink">Freedmen's Bureau</a> used Rolleston Hall and other plantations in the Norfolk area as schools for freedmen. Two hundred were said to be at Rolleston.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<p>Along with working at his law career, Wise wrote a book based on his public service entitled <em>Seven Decades of the Union</em> (1872). His two surviving sons were both active in state and Federal politics.</p>
<p>One of his sons, John Sergeant Wise, wrote a memoir entitled <em>The End of an Era.</em><a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> John Wise was fourteen in the summer of 1860 and served in the Confederate Army late in the war. He wrote about his own memories of Rolleston and the war years, as well as about his father's role and their family members. Henry A. Wise's grandson Barton Haxall Wise wrote a biography of the former governor called <em>The Life of Henry A. Wise of Virginia</em> (New York, 1899).<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
