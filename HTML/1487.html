The site was excavated by the archaeologist <a href="Heinrich_Schliemann" title="wikilink">Heinrich Schliemann</a> in 1876, following the descriptions of <a href="Homer" class="uri" title="wikilink">Homer</a> and <a href="Pausanias_(geographer)" title="wikilink">Pausanias</a>.

<h2 id="history">History</h2>

<p>Grave Circle A, formed circa 1600 BC as a new elite burial place, was probably first restricted to men and seems to be a continuation of the earlier Grave Circle B and correlates with the general social trend of higher burial investment taking place throughout entire Greece that time.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> The Grave Circle A site was part of a larger funeral place from the <a href="Middle_Helladic" title="wikilink">Middle Helladic</a> period. At the time it was built, during the <a href="Late_Helladic" title="wikilink">Late Helladic</a> I (1600 BC),<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> there was probably a small unfortified palace on Mycenae,<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> while the graves of the Mycenean ruling family remained outside of the city walls.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> There is no evidence of a circular wall around the site during the period of the burials.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> The last interment took place circa 1500 BC.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<p>Immediately after the last interment, the local rulers abandoned the shaft graves in favour of a new and more imposing form of tomb already developing in <a href="Messenia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Messenia</a>, south <a href="Peloponessus" class="uri" title="wikilink">Peloponessus</a>, the <a href="Beehive_tomb" title="wikilink">tholos</a>.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> Around 1250 BC, when the fortifications of Mycenae were extended, the Grave Circle was included inside the new wall. A double ring <a href="peribolos" class="uri" title="wikilink">peribolos</a> wall was also built around the area.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> It appears that the site became a <a href="temenos" class="uri" title="wikilink">temenos</a> (sacred precinct), while a circular construction, possibly an altar was found above one grave.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> The burial site had been replanned as a monument, an attempt by the 13th century BC Mycenean rulers to appropriate the possible heroic past of the older ruling dynasty.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> Under this context, the land surface was built up to make a level precinct for ceremonies, with the stelae over the graves being re-erected. A new entrance, the <a href="Lion_Gate" title="wikilink">Lion Gate</a>, was constructed near the site.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="findings">Findings</h2>

<p>Grave Circle A, with a diameter of , is situated on the acropolis of Mycenae southeast of the Lion Gate. The site is surrounded by two rows of slabs, while the space between the rows was filled with earth and roofed with slabs. The Grave Circle contains six <a href="shaft_grave" title="wikilink">shaft graves</a>, the smallest of which is measured at 3.0 m by 3.5 m and the largest measured at 4.50 m by 6.40 m (the depth of each shaft grave ranges from 1.0 m to 4.0 m). Over each grave a mound was constructed and <a href="stele" title="wikilink">stelae</a> were erected.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> These stelae had been probably erected in memory of the Mycenaean rulers buried there; three of them depict <a href="chariot" class="uri" title="wikilink">chariot</a> scenes.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>
<p>A total of nineteen bodies &lt;U+2013&gt; eight men, nine woman and two children<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> &lt;U+2013&gt; were found in the shafts, which contained two to five bodies each (with the exception of Grave II, which was a single burial).<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> Among the findings, boars' tusks were found in Grave IV, as well as five golden masks in Graves IV and V. One of them, the supposed <a href="Mask_of_Agamemnon" title="wikilink">Mask of Agamemnon</a>, was found in Grave V. Additionally, gold and silver cups, including <a href="Nestor&#39;s_Cup" title="wikilink">Nestor's Cup</a> and the <a href="Silver_Siege_Rhyton" title="wikilink">Silver Siege Rhyton</a>, were found by the side of the deceased. A number of gold rings, buttons and bracelets were also found.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> Most of the graves were equipped with full sets of weapons, especially swords,<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> and the figural depictions of the objects show fighting and hunting scenes.</p>
<p>Many objects were designed to signify the social rank of the deceased, for instance, decorated daggers, which were <a href="objects_d&#39;art" title="wikilink">objects d'art</a> and cannot be considered real weapons. Ornate staffs as well as a <a href="scepter" class="uri" title="wikilink">scepter</a> from Grave IV clearly indicate a very significant status of the deceased.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> Items such as bulls' heads with a <a href="double_axe" title="wikilink">double axe</a> display clear <a href="Minoan_civilization" title="wikilink">Minoan</a> influences.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> At the time that the Grave Circle was built the Mycenaeans had not yet conquered Minoan <a href="Crete" class="uri" title="wikilink">Crete</a>. Although it seems that they recognized the Minoans as the providers of the finest in design and craftsmanship, most of the objects decorated in Minoan style and buried in Grave Circle A are not of Minoan but of indigenous craftsmanship.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> On the other hand, certain motifs such as fighting and hunting scenes are clearly of Mycenaean style.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="excavations">Excavations</h2>

<p>The site of Mycenae was the first in Greece to be subjected to modern archaeological excavation.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> It was excavated by the German archaeologist <a href="Heinrich_Schliemann" title="wikilink">Heinrich Schliemann</a> in 1876.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> Schliemann, inspired by <a href="Homer" class="uri" title="wikilink">Homer</a>&lt;U+2019&gt;s descriptions in the <em><a href="Iliad" class="uri" title="wikilink">Iliad</a></em>, in which Mycenae is termed &quot;abounding in gold&quot;, began digging there.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> He was also following the accounts of the ancient geographer <a href="Pausanias_(geographer)" title="wikilink">Pausanias</a> who, during the 2nd century AD, described the once prosperous site and mentioned that according to a local tradition, the graves of <a href="Agamemnon" class="uri" title="wikilink">Agamemnon</a> and his followers, including his charioteer <a href="Eurymedon_(charioteer)" title="wikilink">Eurymedon</a> and the two children of <a href="Cassandra" class="uri" title="wikilink">Cassandra</a>, were buried within the citadel.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> What Schliemann discovered in his excavation satisfied both his opinion of Homer's historical accuracy and his craving for valuable treasures. Among the objects he unearthed in Grave Circle A was a series of gold death masks, including one he proclaimed &quot;The Death Mask of Agamemnon&quot;.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> Schliemann cleared five shafts and recognized them as the graves mentioned by Pausanias. He stopped his exploration after the fifth grave was explored, believing that he had finished excavating the Grave Circle, however a year later <a href="Panagiotis_Stamatakis" title="wikilink">Panagiotis Stamatakis</a> found a sixth shaft grave.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a></p>
<p>It has since been proven that the burials in Grave Circle A date from 16th century BC, before the <a href="Trojan_war#Dates_of_the_Trojan_War" title="wikilink">traditional time of the Trojan War</a> (13th-12th century BC), in which Agamemnon is supposed to have participated.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="historical-inferences">Historical inferences</h2>
<p>The valuable objects found in the graves suggest that powerful rulers were buried in this site. Although Agamemnon was supposed to have lived centuries later, these graves might have belonged to the former ruling dynasty of Mycenae &lt;U+2013&gt; according to Greek mythology, the <a href="Perseides" class="uri" title="wikilink">Perseides</a>.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a></p>
<p>In the 2006 <a href="History_Channel" title="wikilink">History Channel</a> documentary, <em><a href="The_Exodus_Decoded" title="wikilink">The Exodus Decoded</a></em>, it was suggested that some of the objects are related to the events of the <a href="The_Exodus" title="wikilink">Exodus</a>, the departure of the <a href="Israelites" class="uri" title="wikilink">Israelites</a> from <a href="ancient_Egypt" title="wikilink">ancient Egypt</a>. It was argued that the <a href="Tribe_of_Dan" title="wikilink">Tribe of Dan</a> is linked with the <a href="Danaans" class="uri" title="wikilink">Danaans</a> of the Greek mythology, though this view is not widely supported.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a></p>
