The route passes through rural areas as well as the towns of Bridgeville and <a href="Georgetown,_Delaware" title="wikilink">Georgetown</a>. DE 404 runs <a href="concurrency_(road)" title="wikilink">concurrent</a> with <a href="Delaware_Route_18" title="wikilink">DE 18</a> from east of Bridgeville to Georgetown and with US 9 from Georgetown to Five Points. DE 404 has a business route, <a href="Delaware_Route_404_Business" title="wikilink">DE 404 Bus.</a>, that passes through Bridgeville. DE 404, along with MD 404, serves as a major route connecting the <a href="Chesapeake_Bay_Bridge" title="wikilink">Chesapeake Bay Bridge</a> and the <a href="Baltimore-Washington_Metropolitan_Area" title="wikilink">Baltimore-Washington Metropolitan Area</a> with the <a href="Delaware_beaches" title="wikilink">Delaware beaches</a>.</p>
<p>DE 404 was first designated by 1936 to run from the Maryland border to DE 18 southeast of Bridgeville. The route was extended to Five Points by 1987. By 1999, DE 404 was aligned to bypass Bridgeville, with DE 404 Bus. designated on the former route through the town. The new alignment of DE 404 around Bridgeville replaced <a href="Delaware_Route_404_Alternate" title="wikilink">DE 404 Alternate</a> (DE 404 Alt.)</p>

From the state line, the route heads southeast on two-lane undivided Seashore Highway, passing through a mix of farmland and woodland with some homes. In the community of <a href="Scotts_Corner,_Delaware" title="wikilink">Scotts Corner</a>, the road intersects the western terminus of <a href="Delaware_Route_36" title="wikilink">DE 36</a>. DE 404 continues through more rural areas and turns northeast onto Newton Road, with <a href="Delaware_Route_404_Business" title="wikilink">DE 404 Bus.</a> continuing southeast along Seashore Highway toward <a href="Bridgeville,_Delaware" title="wikilink">Bridgeville</a>. From here, DE 404 heads through agricultural areas to the north of Bridgeville, curving east and crossing <a href="Norfolk_Southern" title="wikilink">Norfolk Southern</a>'s Delmarva Secondary railroad line. The route comes to an intersection with <a href="U.S._Route_13_in_Delaware" title="wikilink">US 13</a> and turns south to form a <a href="concurrency_(road)" title="wikilink">concurrency</a> with that route on Sussex Highway, a four-lane <a href="divided_highway" title="wikilink">divided highway</a>. A short distance later, <a href="U.S._Route_13_Business_(Bridgeville,_Delaware)" title="wikilink">US 13 Bus.</a> splits off to the southwest to head into Bridgeville. The road continues through farmland with some businesses to the east of Bridgeville. Upon reaching an intersection with US 13 Bus./DE 404 Bus., DE 404 splits from US 13 by heading southeast onto four-lane divided Seashore Highway. The road passes a few businesses before becoming two lanes and undivided as it continues through agricultural areas, coming to an intersection with <a href="Delaware_Route_18" title="wikilink">DE 18</a>.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a><a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>At this point, DE 18 heads east concurrent with DE 404 along Seashore Highway, running through a mix of farmland and woodland with some residences. The road heads through more forested areas with some agriculture and homes, passing through tracts of the <a href="Redden_State_Forest" title="wikilink">Redden State Forest</a>.

The two routes head southeast onto North Bedford Street, passing homes and businesses. The road comes to an intersection with <a href="U.S._Route_9_in_Delaware" title="wikilink">US 9</a> at The Circle in the center of Georgetown, where DE 18 ends.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a><a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>

The road crosses Norfolk Southern's Indian River Secondary railroad line and runs through residential areas with a few commercial establishments. US 9/DE 404 heads east-northeast out of Georgetown and becomes Lewes Georgetown Highway, passing through farmland with some homes and businesses. The two routes intersect the eastern terminus of <a href="U.S._Route_9_Truck_(Georgetown,_Delaware)" title="wikilink">US 9 Truck</a> and run through wooded areas with some fields and development. In <a href="Gravel_Hill,_Delaware" title="wikilink">Gravel Hill</a>, the road intersects <a href="Delaware_Route_30" title="wikilink">DE 30</a>. Following this intersection, US 9/DE 404 passes through more farmland and woodland with some residences, reaching a junction with <a href="Delaware_Route_5" title="wikilink">DE 5</a> in <a href="Harbeson,_Delaware" title="wikilink">Harbeson</a>. The two routes run through more rural areas, crossing a <a href="Delaware_Coast_Line_Railroad" title="wikilink">Delaware Coast Line Railroad</a> line. The road heads through farmland with increasing residential subdivisions. Upon reaching the area of the <a href="Five_Points,_Delaware" title="wikilink">Five Points</a> intersection in <a href="Nassau,_Delaware" title="wikilink">Nassau</a>, US 9/DE 404 runs past homes and businesses, widening into a divided highway and coming to an intersection with <a href="Delaware_Route_1D" title="wikilink">DE 1D</a>/<a href="Delaware_Route_23" title="wikilink">DE 23</a>. These two routes join US 9/DE 404 for a concurrency on a four-lane divided highway before the road comes to a junction with <a href="Delaware_Route_1" title="wikilink">DE 1</a>. Here, DE 1D/DE 23/DE 404 all end, <a href="U.S._Route_9_Business_(Lewes,_Delaware)" title="wikilink">US 9 Bus.</a> continues northeast, and US 9 heads east for a concurrency with DE 1.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a><a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>

<p>By 1920, what would originally become DE 404 was an unimproved county road, with the section east of Bridgeville under contract as a state highway.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> The entire route of what would become DE 404 was completed as a state highway to a point northwest of Bridgeville by 1924.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> By 1931, the road was built as a state highway northwest to the Maryland border.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> When Delaware designated its state highways by 1936, DE 404 was designated to run from the Maryland border, where it connected to MD 404, southeast to DE 18 southeast of Bridgeville.
