<p>The Longhorns scored a field goal on their first possession and Texas Tech answered with a touchdown pass by <a href="Cody_Hodges" title="wikilink">Cody Hodges</a>. Texas regained the lead when Henry Melton rushed for a touchdown. In the second quarter, the Red Raiders tied up the game with a field goal before Texas regained the lead with two touchdown runs by Selvin Young and a touchdown pass to Billy Pittman. In the third quarter, the Longhorns extended their lead with two touchdowns to one by Texas Tech. Texas' seventh touchdown came with 6:30 left in the game and it was the last points scored in the game.<a href="#fn139" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref139"><sup>139</sup></a></p>
<p>Texas won the game 52&lt;U+2013&gt;17<a href="#fn140" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref140"><sup>140</sup></a> and moved into first place in the <a href="Bowl_Championship_Series" title="wikilink">Bowl Championship Series</a> (BCS) standings for the first time since they were implemented in 1998. The BCS formula took into account <a href="Bowl_Championship_Series#2004-05_formula" title="wikilink">strength of schedule</a> so that teams received more credit for beating stronger opponents. This allowed Texas to advance in the rankings since they beat an unbeaten team while <a href="University_of_Southern_California" title="wikilink">University of Southern California</a>, who previously held the number one spot, beat Washington, a 1&lt;U+2013&gt;6 team.<a href="#fn141" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref141"><sup>141</sup></a></p>
<p>The week following the Texas Tech game Vince Young said he still planned to return for his senior season in 2006. Young, a candidate for the <a href="Heisman_trophy" title="wikilink">Heisman trophy</a>, also apologized for striking the &quot;Heisman pose&quot; during the win over Texas Tech; this had been viewed as an immodest indiscretion.<a href="#fn142" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref142"><sup>142</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="oklahoma-state">Oklahoma State</h3>

<p>Texas place at the top of the BCS rankings lasted only one week. On October 29, 2005, Texas initially trailed but rallied to beat an <a href="Oklahoma_State_Cowboys" title="wikilink">Oklahoma State Cowboys</a> team that had held a losing record through the season so far.<a href="#fn143" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref143"><sup>143</sup></a> Texas retained the top spot in the computer rankings, but not by enough to stay ahead of USC in the overall BCS standings.<a href="#fn144" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref144"><sup>144</sup></a></p>
<p>Oklahoma State scored first, with a surprising 49 yard pass from Al Pena to D'Juan Woods. The Cowboys had lined up tight on 4th and 1 as if trying a short, power run, but faked that play and threw a deep pass instead, catching the Longhorn defense off-guard. Texas replied with a touchdown pass from Young to Thomas, but David Pino missed the extra point, allowing the Cowboys to retain the lead. Oklahoma State scored another touchdown and Texas completed a field goal to make the score 21&lt;U+2013&gt;9 at the end of the first quarter. The Cowboys scored one touchdown in the second quarter off of a pass that was deflected by Texas, and Texas made a field goal near the end to cut into the lead, leaving Oklahoma State ahead 28&lt;U+2013&gt;12 at halftime. The second half was dominated by Texas as they scored five unanswered touchdowns to win the game. The scores consisted of two rushing touchdowns by Vince Young, two rushing touchdowns by Ramonce Taylor, and a 21 yard touchdown pass to Neale Tweedie.<a href="#fn145" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref145"><sup>145</sup></a></p>
<p>Despite Oklahoma State's 0&lt;U+2013&gt;4 start to conference play, they led Texas the entire first half, including a lead of as much as nineteen points. It was the third straight year that Texas trailed Oklahoma State at halftime and came from behind to win by a sizable margin (47&lt;U+2013&gt;28). Vince Young set a school record for total yards in one game with 506 yards (239 passing, 267 rushing).<a href="#fn146" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref146"><sup>146</sup></a> Young also became one of only seven players in NCAA history to have accumulated over 200 yards rushing and 200 yards passing in a single game.<a href="#fn147" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref147"><sup>147</sup></a> Over the past three meetings between the two schools (2003&lt;U+2013&gt;2005), the Longhorns outscored the Cowboys by a combined second-half score of 118&lt;U+2013&gt;0.<a href="#fn148" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref148"><sup>148</sup></a></p>
<p><a href="Turner_Broadcasting_System" title="wikilink">TBS</a> announced that the Longhorns' come-from-behind victory scored a record <a href="Audience_measurement" title="wikilink">viewership</a> rating of 1.927 million viewers.

<h3 id="baylor">Baylor</h3>

<p>The Longhorns first played the <a href="Baylor_Bears" title="wikilink">Baylor Bears</a> in 1901 and have faced them annually since both were members of the <a href="Southwest_Conference" title="wikilink">Southwest Conference</a>. In the 95 meetings through 2005, Texas' record was 69 wins, 22 losses, and 4 ties. Only Texas A&amp;M and the University of Oklahoma had faced Texas more often on the football field.<a href="#fn150" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref150"><sup>150</sup></a></p>
<p>Texas was stopped on their first drive due to an unsuccessful <a href="Glossary_of_American_football#F" title="wikilink">fourth down conversion</a>. Baylor's first possession ended when UT's <a href="Michael_Huff" title="wikilink">Michael Huff</a> intercepted a pass from Baylor's Terrance Park. Longhorn Jamaal Charles scored a touchdown on the drive but the kick was blocked, giving Texas the only first-quarter score and a 6&lt;U+2013&gt;0 lead. Texas extended the lead in the second quarter with rushing touchdowns from Henry Melton, Jamaal Charles, and Ramonce Taylor. Taylor made two more touchdowns in the third quarter and Quan Cosby caught a touchdown pass from Young. In the fourth quarter, Taylor scored his fourth touchdown and backup quarterback Matt Nordgren scored on an odd play where he was hit and fumbled while scrambling for the goal line but the ball traveled forward at about the same speed he was running and bounced right back up into his hands. Texas won the 2005 game 62&lt;U+2013&gt;0<a href="#fn151" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref151"><sup>151</sup></a> making it the only <a href="shutout" class="uri" title="wikilink">shutout</a> of the 2005 season for the Longhorns.<a href="#fn152" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref152"><sup>152</sup></a></p>

<h3 id="kansas">Kansas</h3>

<p>In order to win the 2004 game against the <a href="Kansas_Jayhawks_football" title="wikilink">Kansas Jayhawks</a>, Texas had to convert a 4th-and-18 situation and complete a touchdown pass with only eleven seconds remaining on the clock.<a href="#fn158" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref158"><sup>158</sup></a> The 2005 game provided much less on-field drama, as Texas led 52&lt;U+2013&gt;0 by halftime and defeated Kansas 66&lt;U+2013&gt;14.<a href="#fn159" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref159"><sup>159</sup></a></p>
<p>In the first quarter, Texas scored touchdowns on a pass to Limas Sweed, a run by Jamaal Charles, a pass to Quan Cosby, and a <a href="Glossary_of_American_football#P" title="wikilink">punt return</a> by Aaron Ross. In the second quarter, the Longhorns had a touchdown run by Ramonce Taylor and touchdown catches from David Thomas and Peter Ullman. David Pino also kicked a field goal for the Horns. In the third quarter, Kansas opened the scoring with a 59-yard touchdown by <a href="Jon_Cornish" title="wikilink">Jon Cornish</a>. Taylor scored another touchdown. UT had the only score of the fourth quarter, a touchdown by Selvin Young.<a href="#fn160" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref160"><sup>160</sup></a></p>
<p>UT fans were unhappy with <a href="American_Broadcasting_Company" title="wikilink">ABC</a>'s television coverage of the event. The network elected to stick with the Oklahoma vs. Texas A&amp;M game instead of switching to the Kansas vs. Texas game. ABC stayed with the Oklahoma vs. A&amp;M game through the final down and then ran three full minutes of commercials while the Texas vs. Kansas game continued. By the time they switched over Texas was already leading 14&lt;U+2013&gt;0. The ABC announcers started their coverage saying &quot;And now, we'll join the game you've been waiting for all week, which has pretty much already been decided.&quot;<a href="#fn161" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref161"><sup>161</sup></a> ABC then broke away from their coverage at halftime to broadcast other events. This left thousands of UT fans who assembled to watch the game in Darrell K. Royal &lt;U+2013&gt; Texas Memorial Stadium stranded without coverage for much of the game.<a href="#fn162" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref162"><sup>162</sup></a></p>
<p>The lopsided victory allowed Texas to play several less-experienced players. Back-up quarterback Matt Nordgren entered the game in the third quarter, replacing Vince Young. Third-string quarterback Matt McCoy replaced Nordgren just past the mid-point of the fourth quarter.<a href="#fn163" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref163"><sup>163</sup></a> Since <a href="Colt_McCoy" title="wikilink">Colt McCoy</a> was listed third on the UT depth chart, television broadcasters referred to Matt McCoy (no relation) as Colt McCoy, a mistake they repeated over the season.

<p>On October 24, 2005, Texas passed USC in the BCS rankings due to a strong showing in the computer rankings, which favored the Longhorns because of the overall strength of their opponents as well as the October 22, 2005, win over previously unbeaten Texas Tech. The first place ranking was the first for UT in the BCS era, and the first top ranking in any major football poll since October 8, 1984, when they were atop both the Associated Press and Coaches polls.<a href="#fn248" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref248"><sup>248</sup></a> The 0.0007% margin separating Texas from USC was the slimmest margin between the top two teams since the inception of BCS rankings.<a href="#fn249" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref249"><sup>249</sup></a></p>

However, USC remained atop both human polls and was able to reclaim the top overall ranking. Texas and USC won the rest of their games and faced each other in the National Championship, which Texas won 41&lt;U+2013&gt;38.

<p>The 2005 season marks only the eighth time in 50 years that exactly two teams have gone into the bowl season undefeated. This has been a major criticism of the BCS format, which does not use a playoff to determine the national championship. Unless there are exactly two unbeaten teams, both from BCS conferences, the choice of the top two teams can generate controversy. If more than two undefeated teams remain, then one or more of those teams must be left out. If one or fewer undefeated teams remain, then an opponent must be chosen from among the one-loss teams, meaning that other one-loss teams will be left out.<a href="#fn253" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref253"><sup>253</sup></a><a href="#fn254" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref254"><sup>254</sup></a><a href="#fn255" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref255"><sup>255</sup></a></p>
