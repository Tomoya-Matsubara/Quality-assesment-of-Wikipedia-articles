<p><strong>St. Vaast's Abbey</strong> was a <a href="Order_of_St._Benedict" title="wikilink">Benedictine</a> monastery situated at <a href="Arras" class="uri" title="wikilink">Arras</a>, <em><a href="d&lt;U+00E9&gt;partement_in_France" title="wikilink">d&lt;U+00E9&gt;partement</a></em> of <a href="Pas-de-Calais" class="uri" title="wikilink">Pas-de-Calais</a>, <a href="France" class="uri" title="wikilink">France</a>.</p>
<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<p>It was founded in <a href="667" class="uri" title="wikilink">667</a>. Saint Vaast or <a href="Vedast" class="uri" title="wikilink">Vedast</a> (c. 453â€“540) was first bishop of Arras and later also of <a href="Cambrai" class="uri" title="wikilink">Cambrai</a>, and was buried in the cathedral at Arras. In <a href="667" class="uri" title="wikilink">667</a> Saint <a href="Auburt" class="uri" title="wikilink">Auburt</a>, seventh bishop of Arras, began to build an abbey for <a href="Order_of_St._Benedict" title="wikilink">Benedictine</a> monks on the site of a little chapel which Saint Vedast had erected in honour of <a href="Simon_Peter" title="wikilink">Saint Peter</a>. Vedast's relics were transferred to the new abbey, which was completed by Auburt's successor and generously endowed by King <a href="Theuderic_III" title="wikilink">Theuderic III</a>, who together with his wife was afterwards buried there.</p>
<p>St. Vaast's Abbey was of great importance amongst the monasteries of the Low Countries. It was exempt from episcopal jurisdiction and maintained its independence until <a href="1778" class="uri" title="wikilink">1778</a>, when it was aggregated to the <a href="Congregation_of_Cluny" title="wikilink">Congregation of Cluny</a>.</p>
<p>At the <a href="French_Revolution" title="wikilink">French Revolution</a> it was suppressed and the monastic buildings were used first as a hospital and then as barracks. In 1838 the premises were purchased by the town; part was used as a museum and archive, and the rest as the residence of the bishop. The church, which had been desecrated and partially destroyed, was rebuilt and consecrated in 1833 and now serves as the cathedral.</p>
