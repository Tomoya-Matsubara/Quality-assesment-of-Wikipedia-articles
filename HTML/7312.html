<h2 id="plot-overview">Plot overview</h2>

<p>The show centers on <a href="Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation" title="wikilink">FBI</a> special agents <a href="Fox_Mulder" title="wikilink">Fox Mulder</a> (<a href="David_Duchovny" title="wikilink">David Duchovny</a>) and <a href="Dana_Scully" title="wikilink">Dana Scully</a> (<a href="Gillian_Anderson" title="wikilink">Gillian Anderson</a>) who work on cases linked to the paranormal, called <a href="X-File" title="wikilink">X-Files</a>. When the <a href="Syndicate_(The_X-Files)" title="wikilink">Syndicate</a> suspect that one of their members is passing information to Mulder and Scully, they organize a <a href="canary_trap" title="wikilink">canary trap</a> to find the leak, using information about the safety of Mulder's mother as bait. X's (<a href="Steven_Williams" title="wikilink">Steven Williams</a>) role as an informant is discovered, and he is shot dead, although he is able to pass along the name of another informant who can be of use to Mulder&lt;U+2014&gt;<a href="Marita_Covarrubias" title="wikilink">Marita Covarrubias</a> (<a href="Laurie_Holden" title="wikilink">Laurie Holden</a>), the Special Representative to the <a href="Secretary-General_of_the_United_Nations" title="wikilink">Secretary-General of the United Nations</a>.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a><a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> Covarrubias' aid is sought when Mulder attempts to reach <a href="Podkamennaya_Tunguska_River" title="wikilink">Tunguska</a> in Russia to investigate the source of a further black oil contamination.

<p>Having been diagnosed with cancer, Scully is unsure of her future with the FBI. Mulder is convinced that her condition is a result of her earlier abduction (&quot;<a href="Ascension_(The_X-Files)" title="wikilink">Ascension</a>&quot;), and is prepared to make a deal with the Syndicate to find a cure.

<p><img src="GillianAndersonByIdoCarmelWonderCon2008.jpg" title="fig:The writers for The X-Files decided to give Gillian Anderson&#39;s character cancer in season four." alt="The writers for The X-Files decided to give Gillian Anderson&#39;s character cancer in season four." width="170" /> The season saw drastic changes to the series' alien mythology. In the premiere episode, &quot;<a href="Herrenvolk_(The_X-Files)" title="wikilink">Herrenvolk</a>&quot;, Williams&lt;U+2014&gt;the actor who played Mulder's informant X&lt;U+2014&gt;was written out of the show. He said that, &quot;Carter called me up personally [and said] 'Got good news, got bad news. The good news is we're gonna bring you up for another episode this week. The bad news is you're gonna take a bullet.&quot; <a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> The writers created a new character, Marita Covarrubias, to function as Mulder's informant. Carter felt it would be &quot;more interesting for Mulder's next contact to be a woman&quot;, noting that he &quot;wanted there to be some suspicion about whether Mulder would become involved with her romantically.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> &quot;Herrenvolk&quot; also introduced the killer bees, who would go on to play a larger part in the <a href="The_X-Files_(film)" title="wikilink">1998 movie</a>.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<p>The season is notable in that it introduced a story arc about Scully developing terminal cancer, which would not be resolved until the beginning of the <a href="The_X-Files_(season_5)" title="wikilink">fifth season</a>. The show's producers decided to give Gillian Anderson's character Dana Scully cancer early in the season. Carter initially discussed giving Scully's mother cancer but decided to have Scully suffer from it instead. Carter felt the move would give the show an interesting platform on which to discuss things such as faith, science, health care and a certain element of the paranormal.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> Some of the writing staff felt that the decision was a poor one to make, citing it as &quot;a cheap TV thing&quot;. However, <a href="Frank_Spotnitz" title="wikilink">Frank Spotnitz</a> felt that, given the appearances of cancer-stricken abductees in previous episodes, it was an &quot;obligatory&quot; move to have Scully follow suit.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
<p>Following the cancellation of the Fox television series <em><a href="Space:_Above_and_Beyond" title="wikilink">Space: Above and Beyond</a></em>, Carter called the series' creators Glen Morgan and Wong&lt;U+2014&gt;who had previously been writers for the first two seasons of <em>The X-Files</em>&lt;U+2014&gt;and asked if they wanted to rejoin the series. Morgan told Carter that the two of them would rejoin, but only for four episodes, and only if they could use members for the cast of <em>Space: Above and Beyond</em>, so that &quot;the world can finally see them&quot;.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> Carter accepted this condition, and the two dutifully provided four of the seasons episodes.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="filming">Filming</h3>
<p>The season finale, &quot;Gethsemane&quot;, was notable in that an entire set created to emulated icy caverns was constructed inside a warehouse which had previously been used for cold storage;<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> and required the use of truckloads of lumber and  of Styrofoam. The set would become one of the most expensive and elaborate built during the series' history.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> The set required a constant temperature of  in order to maintain the real snow and ice used to decorate it. This refrigeration allowed the actors' breath to visibly fog up, and allowed the cast to &quot;have a place that feels real&quot; to aid their acting.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> The outdoor scenes for the episode were filmed around <a href="Vancouver" class="uri" title="wikilink">Vancouver</a>'s <a href="Mount_Seymour" title="wikilink">Mount Seymour</a>, with weather conditions making shooting difficult enough to require an extra day of work.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a></p>
<p>Although the series' 1998 movie would take place after the events of the fifth season, the movie was actually filmed in the <a href="Recess_(break)" title="wikilink">hiatus</a> between the show's fourth and fifth season and re-shoots were conducted during the filming of the show's fifth season.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a></p>

However, he also contended that many of the mythology episodes&lt;U+2014&gt;especially the season finale&lt;U+2014&gt;began to have &quot;a ring of familiarity to&quot; them and that &quot;the repetition is getting old&quot;.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a></p>
<p>Episodic reviews were diverse.
