<p><strong>Prince George of Denmark and Norway, Duke of Cumberland</strong> (; 2 April 1653 &lt;U+2013&gt; 28 October 1708), was the husband of <a href="Anne,_Queen_of_Great_Britain" title="wikilink">Queen Anne of Great Britain</a>.</p>
<p>His marriage to Anne was arranged in the early 1680s with a view to developing an Anglo-Danish alliance to contain Dutch maritime power. As a result, George was unpopular with his Dutch brother-in-law <a href="William_III_of_England" title="wikilink">William of Orange</a>, who was married to Anne's elder sister, <a href="Mary_II_of_England" title="wikilink">Mary</a>. William and Mary became joint monarchs of Britain, with Anne as their <a href="heiress_presumptive" title="wikilink">heiress presumptive</a>, in 1689 after the &quot;<a href="Glorious_Revolution" title="wikilink">Glorious Revolution</a>&quot; deposed <a href="James_II_of_England" title="wikilink">James II and VII</a>, the father of Anne and Mary.</p>
<p>William excluded George from active military service, and neither George nor Anne wielded any great influence until after the deaths of William and Mary, when Anne became queen. During his wife's reign, George occasionally used his influence in support of his wife, even when privately disagreeing with her views. He had an easy-going manner and little interest in politics; his appointment as <a href="List_of_Lord_High_Admirals_and_First_Lords_of_the_Admiralty" title="wikilink">Lord High Admiral</a> in 1702 was largely honorary.</p>
<p>Anne's seventeen pregnancies by George resulted in twelve miscarriages or stillbirths, four infant deaths, and a chronically sick son <a href="Prince_William,_Duke_of_Gloucester" title="wikilink">William</a>, who died at the age of eleven. Despite the history of their children, George and Anne's marriage was a strong one. He died aged 55 from a recurring and chronic lung disease, and was buried in Westminster Abbey.</p>

<p>George was born in <a href="Copenhagen" class="uri" title="wikilink">Copenhagen</a>, the youngest son of King <a href="Frederick_III_of_Denmark" title="wikilink">Frederick III of Denmark and Norway</a> and <a href="Sophie_Amalie_of_Brunswick-L&lt;U+00FC&gt;neburg" title="wikilink">Sophie Amalie of Brunswick-L&lt;U+00FC&gt;neburg</a>. His mother was the sister of <a href="Ernest_Augustus,_Elector_of_Brunswick-L&lt;U+00FC&gt;neburg" title="wikilink">Ernest Augustus, Duke of Brunswick-L&lt;U+00FC&gt;neburg</a>, later <a href="Elector_of_Hanover" title="wikilink">Elector of Hanover</a>. From 1661, his governor was <a href=":de:Otto_Grote_zu_Schauen" title="wikilink">Otto Grote</a>, later Hanoverian minister to Denmark. Grote was &quot;more courtier and statesman than educator&quot; and when he left for the Hanoverian court in 1665, he was replaced by the more effective <a href=":da:Christen_Jensen_Lodberg" title="wikilink">Christen Lodberg</a>.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> George received military training, and undertook a <a href="Grand_Tour" title="wikilink">Grand Tour</a> of Europe, spending eight months in 1668&lt;U+2013&gt;69 in France and mid-1669 in England.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> His father died in 1670, while George was in Italy, and George's elder brother, <a href="Christian_V_of_Denmark" title="wikilink">Christian</a>, inherited the <a href="Monarchy_of_Denmark" title="wikilink">Danish throne</a>. George returned home through Germany.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> He travelled through Germany again in 1672&lt;U+2013&gt;73, to visit two of his sisters, who were married to the <a href="Prince-elector" title="wikilink">electoral princes</a> of <a href="John_George_III,_Elector_of_Saxony" title="wikilink">Saxony</a> and the <a href="Charles_II,_Elector_Palatine" title="wikilink">Palatinate</a>.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1674, George was a candidate for the <a href="Polish&lt;U+2013&gt;Lithuanian_Commonwealth" title="wikilink">Polish</a> <a href="Royal_elections_in_Poland" title="wikilink">elective throne</a>, for which he was backed by King <a href="Louis_XIV_of_France" title="wikilink">Louis XIV of France</a>.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> George's staunch <a href="Lutheranism" class="uri" title="wikilink">Lutheranism</a> was a barrier to election in <a href="Roman_Catholic" title="wikilink">Roman Catholic</a> Poland,<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> and <a href="John_III_Sobieski" title="wikilink">John Sobieski</a> was chosen instead.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> In 1677, he served with distinction with his elder brother Christian in the <a href="Scanian_War" title="wikilink">Scanian War</a> against Sweden.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> His brother was captured by the Swedes at the <a href="Battle_of_Landskrona" title="wikilink">Battle of Landskrona</a>, and George &quot;cut his way through the enemies' numbers, and rescued him at the imminent danger of his own life.&quot;<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<p>As a <a href="Protestant" class="uri" title="wikilink">Protestant</a>, George was considered a suitable partner for the niece of King <a href="Charles_II_of_England" title="wikilink">Charles II of England</a>, <a href="Anne,_Queen_of_Great_Britain" title="wikilink">Lady Anne</a>. Although they were distantly related (they were both descended from <a href="Frederick_II_of_Denmark" title="wikilink">Frederick II of Denmark</a>), they had never met. George was hosted by Charles II in London in 1669, but Anne had been in France at the time of George's visit.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> Both Denmark and Britain were Protestant countries, and Louis XIV was keen on an Anglo-Danish alliance to contain the power of the Dutch. Anne's uncle <a href="Laurence_Hyde,_1st_Earl_of_Rochester" title="wikilink">Laurence Hyde, 1st Earl of Rochester</a>, and the English <a href="Secretary_of_State_for_the_Northern_Department" title="wikilink">Secretary of State for the Northern Department</a>, <a href="Robert_Spencer,_2nd_Earl_of_Sunderland" title="wikilink">Robert Spencer, 2nd Earl of Sunderland</a>, negotiated a marriage treaty with the Danes in secret, to prevent the plans leaking to the Dutch.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> Anne's father, <a href="James_II_of_England" title="wikilink">James, Duke of York</a>, welcomed the marriage because it diminished the influence of his other son-in-law, Dutch <a href="Stadtholder" class="uri" title="wikilink">Stadtholder</a> <a href="William_III_of_England" title="wikilink">William of Orange</a>, who was naturally unhappy at the match.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>

<p><img src="George,_Prince_of_Denmark_by_John_Riley.jpg" title="fig:Portrait by John Riley, c. 1687" alt="Portrait by John Riley, c. 1687" /> George and Anne were married on 28 July 1683 in the <a href="Chapel_Royal" title="wikilink">Chapel Royal</a> at <a href="St_James&#39;s_Palace" title="wikilink">St James's Palace</a>, <a href="London" class="uri" title="wikilink">London</a>, by <a href="Henry_Compton_(bishop)" title="wikilink">Henry Compton</a>, <a href="Bishop_of_London" title="wikilink">Bishop of London</a>.

<p>George was not ambitious, and hoped to live a quiet life of domesticity with his wife. He wrote to a friend: &quot;We talk here of going to tea, of going to Winchester, and everything else except sitting still all summer, which was the height of my ambition. God send me a quiet life somewhere, for I shall not be long able to bear this perpetual motion.&quot;<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
<p>Within months of the marriage, Anne was pregnant but the baby, a girl, was stillborn in May. Anne recovered at the <a href="spa_town" title="wikilink">spa town</a> of <a href="Tunbridge_Wells" title="wikilink">Tunbridge Wells</a>,<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> and over the next two years, she gave birth to two daughters in quick succession, Mary and Anne Sophia.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> In early 1687, within a matter of days, George and his two young daughters caught <a href="smallpox" class="uri" title="wikilink">smallpox</a>, and Anne suffered another miscarriage. George recovered, but both his daughters died. <a href="Rachel_Russell,_Baroness_Russell" title="wikilink">Lady Russell</a> wrote that George and Anne had &quot;taken [the deaths] very heavily. The first relief of that sorrow proceeded from the threatening of a greater, the Prince being so ill of a fever. I never heard any relation more moving than that of seeing them together. Sometimes they wept, sometimes they mourned in words; then sat silent, hand in hand; he sick in bed, and she the carefullest nurse to him that can be imagined.&quot;<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> He returned to Denmark for a two-month visit in mid-1687, while Anne remained in England.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> Later that year, after his return, Anne gave birth to another dead child, this time a son.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a></p>
<p>In February 1685, King Charles II died without legitimate issue, and George's father-in-law, the <a href="Roman_Catholic" title="wikilink">Roman Catholic</a> Duke of York, became king as James II in England and Ireland and James VII in Scotland. George was appointed to the <a href="Privy_Council_of_the_United_Kingdom" title="wikilink">Privy Council</a> and invited to attend Cabinet meetings, although he had no power to alter or affect decisions.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> William of Orange refused to attend James's <a href="Coronation_of_the_British_monarch" title="wikilink">coronation</a> largely because George would take precedence over him. Although they were both sons-in-law of King James, George was also the son and brother of a king and so outranked William, who was an elected stadtholder of a republic.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a></p>
<p>Anne's older sister <a href="Mary_II_of_England" title="wikilink">Mary</a> had moved to the Netherlands after her marriage to William of Orange. Protestant opposition to James was therefore increasingly focused around Anne and George instead of Mary, who was <a href="heir_presumptive" title="wikilink">heiress presumptive</a>.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> The social and political grouping centred on George and Anne was known as the &quot;Cockpit Circle&quot; after their London residence.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> On 5 November 1688, William invaded England in an action, known as the &quot;<a href="Glorious_Revolution" title="wikilink">Glorious Revolution</a>&quot;, which ultimately deposed King James. George was forewarned by the Danish envoy in London, Frederick Gersdorff, that William was assembling an invasion fleet.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> George informed Gersdorff that James's army was disaffected, and as a result he would refuse any command under James, but only serve as an uncommissioned volunteer. Gersdorff's alternative plan to evacuate George and Anne to Denmark was rejected by George.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> George accompanied the King's troops to Salisbury in mid-November, but other nobles and their soldiers soon deserted James for William. At each defection, George apparently exclaimed, &quot;<em>Est-il possible?</em>&quot; (Is it possible?).<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> He abandoned James on 24 November, and sided with William.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> &quot;So 'Est-il possible' is gone too&quot;, James supposedly remarked.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> In his memoirs, James dismissed George's defection as trivial, saying the loss of one good trooper was of more consequence,<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> but Gersdorff claimed the defection greatly perturbed the King.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> The defection of George and other nobles was instrumental in whittling away the King's support. In December, James fled to France, and early the following year William and Mary were declared joint monarchs, with Anne as heiress presumptive. In early April 1689, William assented to a bill naturalizing George as an English subject,<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> and George was created <a href="Duke_of_Cumberland" title="wikilink">Duke of Cumberland</a>, <a href="Earl_of_Kendal" title="wikilink">Earl of Kendal</a> and Baron of Okingham (Wokingham) by the new monarchs.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a><a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a></p>

Behind George, a ship offshore is flying the Admiralty flag." /> The mistrust between George and William was set aside during the revolution of 1688&lt;U+2013&gt;89 but dogged relations during the latter's reign. George held mortgages on <a href="Femern" class="uri" title="wikilink">Femern</a>, <a href="Tremsb&lt;U+00FC&gt;ttel" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tremsb&lt;U+00FC&gt;ttel</a> and <a href="Steinhorst,_Schleswig-Holstein" title="wikilink">Steinhorst, Schleswig-Holstein</a>, which he surrendered to the <a href="Christian_Albert,_Duke_of_Holstein-Gottorp" title="wikilink">Duke of Holstein</a> as part of the peace of Altona of 1689 negotiated by William between Denmark and Sweden. William agreed to pay George interest and the capital in compensation, but George remained unpaid.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> During the <a href="Williamite_War_in_Ireland" title="wikilink">military campaign against James's supporters in Ireland</a>, George accompanied the Williamite troops at his own expense, but was excluded from command, and was even refused permission to travel in his brother-in-law's coach.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> Snubbed from the army by William, George sought to join the navy, without rank, but was again thwarted by his brother-in-law.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> When William's Dutch guards failed to salute George, Anne assumed they were acting under orders.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> George and Anne retired from court.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> Some degree of reconciliation was achieved following Queen Mary's sudden and unexpected death from smallpox in 1694, which made Anne <a href="heir_apparent" title="wikilink">heiress apparent</a>.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> In November 1699, William finally recommended that Parliament pay the mortgage debt to George, and in early 1700, the debt was honoured.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a></p>
<p>By 1700, Anne had been pregnant at least seventeen times; twelve times, she miscarried or gave birth to stillborn children, and two of their five children born alive died within a day.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> The only one of the couple's children to survive infancy&lt;U+2014&gt;<a href="Prince_William,_Duke_of_Gloucester" title="wikilink">Prince William, Duke of Gloucester</a>&lt;U+2014&gt;died in July 1700 at the age of 11. With Gloucester's death, Anne was the only person in the line of succession to the throne, as established by the &quot;Glorious Revolution&quot;. To extend the line and secure the Protestant succession, Parliament passed the <a href="Act_of_Settlement_1701" title="wikilink">Act of Settlement 1701</a>, which designated William and Anne's nearest Protestant cousins, the <a href="House_of_Hanover" title="wikilink">House of Hanover</a>, as the next in line after Anne.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a></p>
<p>George did not play a senior role in government until his wife Anne succeeded as queen on William's death in 1702. George was the chief mourner at William's funeral.<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> Anne appointed him generalissimo of all English military forces on 17 April, and <a href="List_of_Lord_High_Admirals_and_First_Lords_of_the_Admiralty" title="wikilink">Lord High Admiral</a>, the official but nominal head of the <a href="Royal_Navy" title="wikilink">Royal Navy</a>, on 20 May.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a> Actual power at the <a href="Admiralty" class="uri" title="wikilink">Admiralty</a> was held by <a href="George_Churchill_(Royal_Navy_officer)" title="wikilink">George Churchill</a>, whose elder brother was <a href="John_Churchill,_1st_Duke_of_Marlborough" title="wikilink">John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough</a>, a great friend of Anne's and the captain-general of English land forces.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a> Prince George had known the Churchills for years: another brother <a href="Charles_Churchill_(British_Army_general)" title="wikilink">Charles Churchill</a>, had been one of his <a href="Gentleman_of_the_Bedchamber" title="wikilink">gentlemen of the bedchamber</a> in Denmark, and Marlborough had accompanied George on his journey from Denmark to England for his marriage to Anne in 1683.<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a> His secretary in the 1680s was Colonel Edward Griffith, brother-in-law of the <a href="Sarah_Churchill,_Duchess_of_Marlborough" title="wikilink">Duchess of Marlborough</a>, who was Anne's close confidante and friend.<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a> George followed William III as Captain-General of the <a href="Honourable_Artillery_Company" title="wikilink">Honourable Artillery Company</a>,<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a> and was made <a href="Lord_Warden_of_the_Cinque_Ports" title="wikilink">Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports</a>.<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a> Anne failed, however, in her attempts to persuade the <a href="States-General_of_the_Netherlands" title="wikilink">States-General of the Netherlands</a> to elect her husband captain-general of all Dutch forces, to maintain the unified command of the <a href="Maritime_Powers" title="wikilink">Maritime Powers</a> that William had held.<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a> <img src="Equestrian_portrait_of_Prince_George_of_Denmark_-_Dahl_1704.jpg" title="fig:George on horseback, painted by Michael Dahl, 1704" alt="George on horseback, painted by Michael Dahl, 1704" /> Anne obtained a parliamentary allowance of &lt;U+00A3&gt;100,000 a year for George in the event of her death. The bill sped through the <a href="House_of_Commons_of_England" title="wikilink">House of Commons</a> easily but it was only narrowly passed by the <a href="House_of_Lords" title="wikilink">House of Lords</a>.

<p>Generally, during her reign, Anne and her husband spent the winter at <a href="Kensington_Palace" title="wikilink">Kensington</a> and <a href="St_James&#39;s_Palace" title="wikilink">St James's Palaces</a>, and the summer at <a href="Windsor_Castle" title="wikilink">Windsor Castle</a> or <a href="Hampton_Court_Palace" title="wikilink">Hampton Court Palace</a>, where the air was fresher. George had recurrent <a href="asthma" class="uri" title="wikilink">asthma</a>, and the cleaner air in the country was better for his breathing.

<p>At the end of 1702, the Occasional Conformity Bill was introduced to Parliament. The bill aimed to disqualify Protestant <a href="Dissenter" title="wikilink">Dissenters</a> from public office by closing a loophole in the <a href="Test_Act" title="wikilink">Test Acts</a>, legislation that restricted public office to <a href="Anglicanism" title="wikilink">Anglican</a> <a href="conformist" title="wikilink">conformists</a>. The existing law permitted <a href="nonconformist" title="wikilink">nonconformists</a> to take office if they took Anglican <a href="Eucharist" title="wikilink">communion</a> once a year. Anne was in favour of the measure, and forced George to vote for the bill in the House of Lords, even though, being a practising <a href="Lutheran" class="uri" title="wikilink">Lutheran</a>, he was an occasional conformist himself.<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a> As he cast his vote, he reportedly told an opponent of the bill, &quot;My heart is vid you&quot; .<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a> The bill did not gather sufficient parliamentary support and was eventually dropped.<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a> The following year, the bill was revived, but Anne withheld support, fearing its reintroduction was a deliberate pretence to cause a quarrel between the two main political groups: the <a href="Tory" title="wikilink">Tories</a> (who supported the bill) and the <a href="British_Whig_Party" title="wikilink">Whigs</a> (who opposed it).

<p>In the first years of Anne's reign, the Whigs gained more power and influence at the expense of the Tories. In his capacity as Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports, George held influence in parliamentary boroughs on the south coast of England, which he used to support Whig candidates in the <a href="English_general_election,_1705" title="wikilink">general election of 1705</a>.<a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a> In that year's election for <a href="Speaker_of_the_House_of_Commons_(United_Kingdom)" title="wikilink">Speaker of the House of Commons</a>, George and Anne supported a Whig candidate, <a href="John_Smith_(Chancellor_of_the_Exchequer)" title="wikilink">John Smith</a>.

Pressure grew to replace Admiral Churchill with someone more dynamic.<a href="#fn69" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref69"><sup>69</sup></a> By October 1708, five powerful politicians, known as the <a href="Whig_Junto" title="wikilink">Whig Junto</a>&lt;U+2014&gt;Lords <a href="John_Somers,_1st_Baron_Somers" title="wikilink">Somers</a>, <a href="Charles_Montagu,_1st_Earl_of_Halifax" title="wikilink">Halifax</a>, <a href="Edward_Russell,_1st_Earl_of_Orford" title="wikilink">Orford</a>, <a href="Thomas_Wharton,_1st_Marquess_of_Wharton" title="wikilink">Wharton</a> and <a href="Charles_Spencer,_3rd_Earl_of_Sunderland" title="wikilink">Sunderland</a>&lt;U+2014&gt;were clamouring for the removal of both Prince George and Churchill.

<p>Amid the political pressure, George was on his deathbed, suffering from severe asthma and <a href="dropsy" class="uri" title="wikilink">dropsy</a>.<a href="#fn72" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref72"><sup>72</sup></a> He died at 1:30 p.m. on 28 October 1708 at <a href="Kensington_Palace" title="wikilink">Kensington Palace</a>.<a href="#fn73" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref73"><sup>73</sup></a> The Queen was devastated.<a href="#fn74" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref74"><sup>74</sup></a> <a href="James_Brydges,_1st_Duke_of_Chandos" title="wikilink">James Brydges</a> wrote to <a href="William_Cadogan,_1st_Earl_Cadogan" title="wikilink">General Cadogan</a>, &quot;His death has flung the Queen into an unspeakable grief.

She burst into tears on the first occasion she was brought papers to sign in George's stead.<a href="#fn81" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref81"><sup>81</sup></a> Undeterred, the Junto demanded the appointment of Lord Orford, a member of the Junto and one of Prince George's leading critics, as <a href="First_Lord_of_the_Admiralty" title="wikilink">First Lord of the Admiralty</a>. Admiral Churchill retired, and Anne appointed the moderate Tory <a href="Thomas_Herbert,_8th_Earl_of_Pembroke" title="wikilink">Lord Pembroke</a> to lead the Admiralty, instead of a Whig. The Junto Whigs Somers and Wharton, however, were appointed to the Cabinet in Pembroke's vacated posts of <a href="Lord_President_of_the_Council" title="wikilink">Lord President of the Council</a> and <a href="Lord_Lieutenant_of_Ireland" title="wikilink">Lord Lieutenant of Ireland</a>. The Whigs were still dissatisfied, and continued to pressure Pembroke and the Queen. Pembroke resigned after less than a year in office. Another month of arguments followed before the Queen finally consented to put Orford in control of the Admiralty as First Lord in November 1709.<a href="#fn82" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref82"><sup>82</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="personal-traits-and-portrayal">Personal traits and portrayal</h3>
<p><a href="Charles_II_of_England" title="wikilink">Charles II</a>, Anne's uncle, famously said of Prince George, &quot;I have tried him drunk, and I have tried him sober and there is nothing in him&quot;.<a href="#fn83" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref83"><sup>83</sup></a> He was quiet and self-effacing. <a href="John_Macky" title="wikilink">John Macky</a> thought him &quot;of a familiar, easy disposition with a good sound understanding but modest in showing it &lt;U+2026&gt; very fat, loves news, his bottle &amp; the Queen.&quot;<a href="#fn84" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref84"><sup>84</sup></a> In making fun of George's asthma, <a href="John_Sheffield,_1st_Duke_of_Buckingham_and_Normanby" title="wikilink">Lord Mulgrave</a> said the Prince was forced to breathe hard in case people mistook him for dead and buried him.<a href="#fn85" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref85"><sup>85</sup></a> By the time of <a href="Queen_Victoria" title="wikilink">Queen Victoria</a>, George had a reputation as a dullard, and was the target of disdain. Victoria hoped her own husband, <a href="Albert,_Prince_Consort" title="wikilink">Prince Albert</a>, would never fill the &quot;subordinate part played by the very stupid and insignificant husband of Queen Anne&quot;.<a href="#fn86" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref86"><sup>86</sup></a> In the 1930s, <a href="Winston_Churchill" title="wikilink">Winston Churchill</a> said he &quot;mattered very little&quot;, except to Anne.<a href="#fn87" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref87"><sup>87</sup></a> <img src="Miniature_of_Prince_George.jpg" title="fig:Miniature in the Royal Collection by Henry Pierce Bone, 1841.

Purchased by Prince Albert." /> He had little impact on the running of the navy, but he was interested enough in navigation and welfare at sea to sponsor the publication of <a href="John_Flamsteed" title="wikilink">John Flamsteed</a>'s <em>Observations</em> in 1704.<a href="#fn88" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref88"><sup>88</sup></a> He was not one of the most colourful political characters of his day&lt;U+2014&gt;he was content to spend his time building model ships<a href="#fn89" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref89"><sup>89</sup></a>&lt;U+2014&gt;but he was a loyal and supportive husband to Queen Anne. Their marriage was a devoted, loving and faithful one, though beset by personal tragedy.<a href="#fn90" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref90"><sup>90</sup></a></p>
<p>The previous husband of a British <a href="queen_regnant" title="wikilink">queen regnant</a>, William of Orange, had become king, refusing to take a subordinate rank to Mary. <a href="William_and_Mary" title="wikilink">William and Mary</a> had exemplified the traditional gender roles of seventeenth-century Europe: Mary was the dutiful wife and William held the power. George and Anne, however, reversed the roles: George was the dutiful husband and it was Anne who exercised the royal prerogatives. William had assumed incorrectly that George would use his marriage to Anne as a means of building a separate power base in Britain, but George never challenged his wife's authority and never strove to accrue influence. Anne occasionally used the image of wifely virtue to escape unpalatable situations by claiming, as a woman, she knew &quot;nothing except what the prince tells me&quot;, but it was an artifice.<a href="#fn91" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref91"><sup>91</sup></a> Husbands had a legal right to their wife's property, and it was argued that it was unnatural and against the church's teachings for a man to be subject to his wife.<a href="#fn92" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref92"><sup>92</sup></a> George made no such claim or demand; he was content to remain a prince and duke. &quot;I am her Majesty's subject&quot;, he said, &quot;I shall do naught but what she commands me.&quot;<a href="#fn93" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref93"><sup>93</sup></a> In the words of historian <a href="Anne_Somerset_(historian)" title="wikilink">Anne Somerset</a>, &quot;the fact that Prince George was widely regarded as a nonentity helped reconcile people to his anomalous status, and so, almost by accident, George achieved a major advance for feminism.&quot;<a href="#fn94" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref94"><sup>94</sup></a> Winston Churchill wrote that he &quot;was a fine-looking man, tall, blond, and good-natured &lt;U+2026&gt; He was neither clever nor learned&lt;U+2014&gt;a simple, normal man without envy or ambition, and disposed by remarkable appetite and thirst for all the pleasures of the table. Charles's well-known verdict &lt;U+2026&gt; does not do justice to the homely virtues and unfailing good-humour of his staid and trustworthy character.&quot;<a href="#fn95" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref95"><sup>95</sup></a></p>
