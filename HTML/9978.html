<p><strong><em>Myst</em></strong> is a <a href="graphic_adventure_game" title="wikilink">graphic adventure</a> <a href="video_game" title="wikilink">video game</a> designed and directed by the brothers <a href="Robyn_Miller" title="wikilink">Robyn</a> and <a href="Rand_Miller" title="wikilink">Rand Miller</a>. It was developed by <a href="Cyan,_Inc." title="wikilink">Cyan</a> (now Cyan Worlds), a <a href="Spokane,_Washington" title="wikilink">Spokane, Washington</a>-based studio, and <a href="video_game_publisher" title="wikilink">published</a> and distributed by <a href="Br&lt;U+00F8&gt;derbund" class="uri" title="wikilink">Br&lt;U+00F8&gt;derbund</a>. The Millers began working on <em>Myst</em> in  and released it for the <a href="Macintosh" class="uri" title="wikilink">Macintosh</a> computer on September 24, 1993; it was developer Cyan's largest project to date. Remakes and <a href="porting" title="wikilink">ports</a> of the game have been released for <a href="Sega_Saturn" title="wikilink">Saturn</a>, <a href="Microsoft_Windows" title="wikilink">Microsoft Windows</a>, <a href="Atari_Jaguar_CD" title="wikilink">Jaguar CD</a>, <a href="3DO_Interactive_Multiplayer" title="wikilink">3DO</a>, <a href="CD-i" class="uri" title="wikilink">CD-i</a>, <a href="PlayStation_(console)" title="wikilink">PlayStation</a>, <a href="AmigaOS" class="uri" title="wikilink">AmigaOS</a>, <a href="PlayStation_Portable" title="wikilink">PSP</a>, <a href="Nintendo_DS" title="wikilink">Nintendo DS</a>, and <a href="iOS_(Apple)" title="wikilink">iOS</a> by publishers <a href="Midway_Games" title="wikilink">Midway Games</a>, <a href="Sunsoft" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sunsoft</a>, and <a href="Mean_Hamster_Software" title="wikilink">Mean Hamster Software</a>.</p>
<p><em>Myst</em> puts the player in the role of the <a href="Characters_of_Myst" title="wikilink">Stranger</a>, who uses a special book to travel to the island of Myst. There, the player uses other special books written by an artisan and explorer named <a href="Characters_of_Myst#Atrus" title="wikilink">Atrus</a> to travel to several worlds known as &quot;Ages&quot;. Clues found in each of these Ages help reveal the back-story of the game's characters. The game has several endings, depending on the course of action the player takes.</p>
<p>Upon release, <em>Myst</em> was a surprise hit, with critics lauding the ability of the game to immerse players in the fictional world. The game was the <a href="List_of_best-selling_video_games" title="wikilink">best-selling PC game</a> of all time, until <em><a href="The_Sims" title="wikilink">The Sims</a></em> exceeded its sales in .<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> <em>Myst</em> helped drive adoption of the then-nascent <a href="CD-ROM" class="uri" title="wikilink">CD-ROM</a> format. <em>Myst</em>{{'}}s success spawned four direct video game sequels as well as several spin-off games and novels.</p>

</figure>
<p>The gameplay of <em>Myst</em> consists of a <a href="first-person_narrative" title="wikilink">first-person</a> journey through an interactive world. The player moves the character by clicking on locations shown in the main display; the scene then crossfades into another frame, and the player can continue to explore. Players can interact with specific objects on some screens by <a href="Point-and-click" title="wikilink">clicking</a> or dragging them.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> To assist in rapidly crossing areas already explored, <em>Myst</em> has an optional &quot;Zip&quot; feature. When a lightning bolt cursor appears, players can click and skip several frames to another location. While this provides a rapid method of travel, it can also cause players to miss important items and clues.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> Some items can be carried by the player and read, including journal pages which provide <a href="Back-story" title="wikilink">backstory</a>. Players can only carry a single page at a time, and pages return to their original locations when dropped.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>To complete the game, the player must explore the seemingly deserted island of Myst.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> There the player discovers and follows clues to be transported via &quot;linking books&quot; to several &quot;Ages&quot;, each of which is a self-contained mini-world. Each Age&lt;U+2014&gt;named Selenitic, Stoneship, Mechanical, and Channelwood&lt;U+2014&gt;requires the user to solve a series of logical, interrelated puzzles to complete its exploration. Objects and information discovered in one Age may be required to solve puzzles in another Age, or to complete the game's primary puzzle on Myst. For example, in order to activate a switch, players must first open a safe and use the matches found within to start a boiler.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p>Apart from its predominantly nonverbal storytelling,<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> <em>Myst</em>{{'}}s gameplay is unusual among adventuring computer games in several ways. The player is provided with very little backstory at the beginning of the game, and no obvious goals or objectives are laid out. This means that players must simply begin to explore. There are no obvious enemies, <a href="nonviolent_video_game" title="wikilink">no physical violence</a>, and no threat of &quot;dying&quot; at any point,<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> although it is possible to reach a few &quot;losing&quot; endings. There is no time limit to complete the game.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> The game unfolds at its own pace and is solved through a combination of patience, observation, and logical thinking.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="plot">Plot</h2>
<p>The game's instruction manual explains that an unnamed person known as the <a href="Characters_of_Myst#The_Stranger" title="wikilink">Stranger</a> stumbles across an unusual book titled &quot;Myst&quot;. The Stranger reads the book and discovers a detailed description of an island world. Placing his hand on the last page, the Stranger is whisked away to the world described, and is left with no choice but to explore;<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> the player then gains control and is allowed to wander the new surroundings.</p>
<p>Myst, the island world described in the book, contains a library where two additional books can be found, colored red and blue. These books are traps which hold <a href="Characters_of_Myst#Sirrus_and_Achenar" title="wikilink">Sirrus and Achenar</a>, the sons of <a href="Characters_of_Myst#Atrus" title="wikilink">Atrus</a>, who lives on Myst island with his wife Catherine. Atrus uses an ancient practice to write special &quot;linking books&quot;, which transport people to the worlds, or &quot;Ages&quot;, that the books describe. From the panels of their books, Sirrus and Achenar tell the Stranger that Atrus is dead, each claiming that the other brother murdered him, and plead for the Stranger to help them escape. However, the books are missing several pages, so the sons' messages are at first unclear, and riddled with static.</p>
<p>As the Stranger continues to explore the island, more books are discovered hidden behind complex mechanisms and puzzles. There are four books in total, each linking to a different Age. The Stranger must visit each Age, find the red and blue pages hidden there, and then return to Myst Island. These pages can then be placed in the corresponding books. As the Stranger adds more pages to these books, the brothers can speak more and more clearly. Throughout this process, each brother maintains that the other brother cannot be trusted. After collecting four pages, the brothers can talk clearly enough to tell the Stranger where the fifth page is hidden. If the Stranger gives either brother their fifth page, they will be free. The Stranger is left with a choice to help Sirrus, Achenar, or neither.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<p>Both brothers beg the Stranger not to touch the green book that is stored in the same location as their last pages. They claim that it is a book like their own that will trap the Stranger. In truth, it leads to D'ni, where Atrus is imprisoned. When the book is opened, Atrus asks the Stranger to bring him a final page that is hidden on Myst Island; without it, he cannot bring his sons to justice.</p>
<p>The game has several endings, depending on the player's actions. Giving either Sirrus or Achenar the final page of their book causes the Stranger to switch places with the son, leaving the player trapped inside the Prison book. Linking to D'ni without the page Atrus asks for leaves both the Stranger and Atrus trapped on D'ni. Linking to D'ni with the page allows Atrus to complete his Myst book and return to the island.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> Upon returning to the library, the red and blue books are gone, and there are burn marks on the shelves where they used to be.</p>
<h2 id="development">Development</h2>

<p>s fictional history<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a>}}</p>
<p>The <em>Myst</em> creative team consisted of the brothers Rand and Robyn Miller, with help from sound designer Chris Brandkamp, 3D artist and animator, Chuck Carter, Richard Watson, Bonnie McDowall, and <a href="Ryan_Miller_(author)" title="wikilink">Ryan Miller</a>, who together made up <a href="Cyan_Worlds" title="wikilink">Cyan, Inc.</a> The company had previously only made children's games. <em>Myst</em> was conceived by the brothers as a challenging but aesthetically simple game that would appeal to adults;<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> <em>Myst</em> was not only the largest collaboration Cyan had attempted at the time, but also took the longest to develop.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> According to Rand Miller, the brothers spent months solely designing the look and puzzles of the Ages,<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> which were influenced by earlier whimsical &quot;worlds&quot; made for children.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> According to the creators, the game's name, as well as the overall solitary and mysterious atmosphere of the island, was inspired by the book <em><a href="The_Mysterious_Island" title="wikilink">The Mysterious Island</a></em> by <a href="Jules_Verne" title="wikilink">Jules Verne</a>.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a></p>
<p>At first, the developers had no idea how they would actually create the physical terrain for the Ages.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> Eventually, they created grayscale <a href="heightmap" title="wikilink">heightmaps</a>, extruding them to create changes in elevation. From this basic terrain, textures were painted onto a colormap which was wrapped over the landscapes. Objects such as trees were added to complete the design.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> Rand noted that attention to detail allowed <em>Myst</em> to deal with the limitations of CD-ROM drives and graphics, stating &quot;A lot can be done with texture&lt;U+2026&gt;Like finding an interesting texture you can map into the tapestry on the wall, spending a little extra time to actually put the bumps on the tapestry, putting screws in things. These are the things you don't necessarily notice, but if they weren't there, would flag to your subconscious that this is fake.&quot;<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a></p>
<p>The game was created on <a href="Macintosh" class="uri" title="wikilink">Macintosh</a> computers, principally <a href="Macintosh_Quadra" title="wikilink">Macintosh Quadras</a>. The graphics were individual shots of fully rendered rooms. Overall, <em>Myst</em> contains 2,500 frames, one for each possible area the player can explore.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> Each scene was modeled and rendered in <a href="StrataVision_3D" title="wikilink">StrataVision 3D</a>, with some additional modeling in <a href="Macromedia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Macromedia</a> MacroModel.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> The images were then edited and enhanced using <a href="Adobe_Photoshop" title="wikilink">Photoshop</a> 1.0.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a></p>
<p>The original Macintosh version of <em>Myst</em> was constructed in <a href="HyperCard" class="uri" title="wikilink">HyperCard</a>. Each Age was a unique <a href="HyperCard" class="uri" title="wikilink">HyperCard</a> stack. Navigation was handled by the internal button system and <a href="HyperTalk" class="uri" title="wikilink">HyperTalk</a> scripts, with image and <a href="QuickTime" class="uri" title="wikilink">QuickTime</a> movie display passed off to various plugins; essentially, <em>Myst</em> functions as a series of separate multimedia slides linked together by commands.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> As the main technical constraint that impacted <em>Myst</em> was slow <a href="CD-ROM" class="uri" title="wikilink">CD-ROM</a> drive read speeds, Cyan had to go to great lengths to make sure all the game elements loaded as quickly as possible.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> Images were stored as 8-bit <a href="PICT" class="uri" title="wikilink">PICT</a> resources with custom color palettes and QuickTime still image compression.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> Animated elements such as movies and object animations were encoded as QuickTime movies with <a href="Cinepak" class="uri" title="wikilink">Cinepak</a> compression;<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> in total, there were more than 66 minutes of Quicktime animation.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> This careful processing made the finished graphics look like <a href="truecolor" class="uri" title="wikilink">truecolor</a> images despite their low bit depth; the stills were reduced in size from 500 <a href="kilobyte" title="wikilink">KB</a> to around 80 KB.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="audio">Audio</h3>

<p>Chris Brandkamp produced most of the <a href="Ambient_noise_level" title="wikilink">ambient</a> and incidental sounds in the game. To make sure the sounds fit, Brandkamp had to wait until the game's visuals were placed in context.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> Sound effects were drawn from unlikely sources; the noise of a fire in a boiler was created by driving slowly over stones in a driveway, because recordings of actual fire did not sound like fire burning.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> The chimes of a large clock tower were simulated using a wrench, then transposed to a lower pitch.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a></p>
<p>At first, <em>Myst</em> had no music, because the Millers did not want music to interfere with the gameplay.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> After a few tests, they realized that the background music did not adversely affect the game and, in fact, &quot;seemed to really help the mood of certain places that you were at in the game.&quot;<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> Robyn Miller ended up composing 40 minutes of <a href="Synthesizer" title="wikilink">synthesized</a> music that was used in the game and later published as <em>Myst: The Soundtrack</em>.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> Initially, Cyan released the soundtrack via a mail-order service, but before the release of <em>Myst</em>{{'}}s sequel, <em><a href="Riven" class="uri" title="wikilink">Riven</a></em>, <a href="Virgin_Records" title="wikilink">Virgin Records</a> acquired the rights to releasing the soundtrack,<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> and the CD was rereleased on April 21, 1998.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="reception">Reception</h2>

<p><em>Myst</em> was commercially successful on release. Along with <em><a href="The_7th_Guest" title="wikilink">The 7th Guest</a></em>, it was widely regarded as a <a href="killer_application" title="wikilink">killer application</a> that accelerated the sales of CD-ROM drives.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a><a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> The game's success also led to a number of games which sought to copy <em>Myst</em>{{'}}s success, referred to as &quot;<em>Myst</em> clones&quot;.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> <em>Myst</em> was the <a href="List_of_best-selling_video_games" title="wikilink">bestselling PC game</a> throughout the 1990s, until <em><a href="The_Sims" title="wikilink">The Sims</a></em> exceeded its sales in 2002.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> The PC version of <em>Myst</em> holds an average score of 90% at <a href="GameRankings" class="uri" title="wikilink">GameRankings</a> based on six reviews,<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> although the subsequent remakes of the game and the console ports have generally received lower average scores. <em>Myst</em>{{'}}s success baffled some who wondered how a game some saw as &quot;little more than 'an interactive slide show'&quot; turned out to be a hit.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a></p>
<p><em>Myst</em> was generally praised by critics. <em><a href="Wired_(magazine)" title="wikilink">Wired</a></em> and <em><a href="The_New_York_Times" title="wikilink">The New York Times</a></em> suggested that <em>Myst</em> was evidence that video games could in fact evolve into an art form.<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> <em><a href="Entertainment_Weekly" title="wikilink">Entertainment Weekly</a></em> reported that some players considered <em>Myst</em>{{'}}s &quot;virtual morality&quot; a religious experience.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a> <a href="Aarhus_University" title="wikilink">Aarhus University</a> professor S&lt;U+00F8&gt;ren Pold pointed to <em>Myst</em> as an excellent example of how stories can be told using objects rather than people.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a> Laura Evenson, writing for the <em><a href="San_Francisco_Chronicle" title="wikilink">San Francisco Chronicle</a></em>, pointed to adult-oriented games like <em>Myst</em> as evidence the video game industry was emerging from its &quot;adolescent&quot; phase.<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a></p>
<p><a href="GameSpot" class="uri" title="wikilink">GameSpot</a> said that &quot;<em>Myst</em> is an immersive experience that draws you in and won't let you go.&quot;<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a> Writing about <em>Myst</em>{{'}}s reception, Greg M. Smith noted that <em>Myst</em> had become a hit and was regarded as incredibly immersive despite most closely resembling &quot;the hoary technology of the <a href="slideshow" class="uri" title="wikilink">slideshow</a> (with accompanying music and effects)&quot;.<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a> Smith concluded that &quot;<em>Myst</em>{{'}}s primary brilliance lies in the way it provides narrative justification for the very things that are most annoying&quot; about the technological constraints imposed on the game;<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a> for instance, <em><a href="Macworld" class="uri" title="wikilink">Macworld</a></em> praised <em>Myst</em>{{'}}s designers for overcoming the occasionally debilitating slowness of CD drives to deliver a consistent experience throughout the game.<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a> The publication went on to declare <em>Myst</em> the best game of 1994, stating that <em>Myst</em> removed the &quot;most annoying parts of adventure games — vocabularies that [you] don't understand, people you can't talk to, wrong moves that get you killed and make you start over. You try to unravel the enigma of the island by exploring the island, but there's no time pressure to distract you, no arbitrary punishments put in your way&quot;.<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a></p>
<p>Some aspects of the game still received criticism. Several publications did not agree with the positive reception of the story; Jeremy Parrish of <a href="1UP.com" class="uri" title="wikilink">1UP.com</a> noted that while <em>Myst</em>{{'}}s lack of interaction and continual plot suited the game, it helped usher in the death of the adventure game genre.<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a> <em><a href="Edge_(magazine)" title="wikilink">Edge</a></em> stated the main flaw with the game was that the game engine was nowhere near as sophisticated as the graphics.<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a> Heidi Fournier of <em><a href="Adventure_Gamers" title="wikilink">Adventure Gamers</a></em> noted a few critics complained about the difficulty and lack of context of the puzzles, while others believed these elements added to the gameplay.<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a> Similarly, critics were split on whether the lack of a plot the player could actually change was a good or bad element.<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a> In a 2000 retrospective review, <a href="IGN" class="uri" title="wikilink">IGN</a> declared that <em>Myst</em> had not aged well and that playing it &quot;was like watching hit TV shows from the 70s. 'People watched that?,' you wonder in horror.&quot;<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a></p>

<p>In addition to the numerous remakes and ports of the game, <em>Myst</em>{{'}}s success led to several sequels. <em><a href="Riven" class="uri" title="wikilink">Riven</a></em> was released on October 29, 1997, in which Atrus asks the Stranger to return to help him rescue his wife from <a href="Characters_of_Myst#Gehn" title="wikilink">Gehn</a>. <em><a href="Myst_III:_Exile" title="wikilink">Myst III: Exile</a></em> was released simultaneously for Macintosh and Windows systems in North America on May 7, 2001, and was later ported to the <a href="PlayStation_2" title="wikilink">PlayStation 2</a> and <a href="Xbox" class="uri" title="wikilink">Xbox</a> consoles. <em>Exile</em> was not developed by Cyan; <a href="Presto_Studios" title="wikilink">Presto Studios</a> developed the title and <a href="Ubisoft" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ubisoft</a> published it.<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a> Taking place 10 years after the events of <em>Riven</em>, <em>Exile</em> reveals the reasons for Atrus' sons being imprisoned and the disastrous effects their greed caused.<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a> The fourth entry in the series, <em><a href="Myst_IV:_Revelation" title="wikilink">Myst IV: Revelation</a></em>, was released on September 10, 2004, and was developed and published entirely by Ubisoft.

References to <em>Myst</em> made appearances in an episode of the <em><a href="The_Simpsons" title="wikilink">The Simpsons</a></em> (&quot;<a href="Treehouse_of_Horror_VI" title="wikilink">Treehouse of Horror VI</a>&quot;),<a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a> and <a href="Matt_Damon" title="wikilink">Matt Damon</a> wanted <em><a href="Robert_Ludlum&#39;s_The_Bourne_Conspiracy" title="wikilink">The Bourne Conspiracy</a></em> to be a puzzle game like <em>Myst</em>, refusing to lend his voice talent to the game when it was turned into a shooter instead.<a href="#fn69" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref69"><sup>69</sup></a> <em>Myst</em> has also been used for educational and scientific purposes; <a href="Becta" class="uri" title="wikilink">Becta</a> recognized a Primary school teacher, Tim Rylands, who had made literacy gains using <em>Myst</em> as a teaching tool,<a href="#fn70" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a> and researchers have used the game for studies examining the effect of video games on aggression.<a href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="rereleases-and-ports">Rereleases and ports</h2>

<h3 id="pc-remakes">PC remakes</h3>

<p><em>Myst: Masterpiece Edition</em> was an updated version of the original <em>Myst</em>, released in May 2000. It featured several improvements over the original game, with the images re-rendered in 24-bit <a href="truecolor" class="uri" title="wikilink">truecolor</a> instead of the original <em>Myst</em>{{'}}s 8-bit color. The score was re-mastered and sound effects were enhanced, and some cinematics were redone.<a href="#fn72" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref72"><sup>72</sup></a></p>
<p><em>realMyst: Interactive 3D Edition</em> was a remake of <em>Myst</em> released in November 2000 for Windows PCs, and in January 2002 for Mac. Unlike <em>Myst</em> and the <em>Masterpiece Edition</em>, <em>realMyst</em> featured free-roaming, real-time 3D graphics instead of pre-rendered stills.<a href="#fn73" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref73"><sup>73</sup></a> Weather effects like thunderstorms, sunsets, and sunrises were added to the Ages, and minor additions were made to keep the game in sync with the story of the <em>Myst</em> novels and sequels. The game also added a new Age called Rime, which is featured in an extended ending.<a href="#fn74" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref74"><sup>74</sup></a> <em>realMyst</em> was developed by Cyan, Inc. and <a href="Sunsoft" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sunsoft</a>, and published by <a href="Ubisoft" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ubisoft</a>.

<h3 id="handhelds">Handhelds</h3>
<p>In November 2005, <a href="Midway_Games" title="wikilink">Midway Games</a> announced that they would be developing a remake of <em>Myst</em> for the <a href="PlayStation_Portable" title="wikilink">PlayStation Portable</a>. The remake would include additional content that was not featured in the original <em>Myst</em>, including the Rime age that was earlier seen in <em>realMyst</em>.<a href="#fn76" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref76"><sup>76</sup></a> The game was released in Japan and Europe in 2006, and the US version was released in 2008.<a href="#fn77" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref77"><sup>77</sup></a></p>
<p>A version of <em>Myst</em> for the <a href="Nintendo_DS" title="wikilink">Nintendo DS</a> was also released in December 2007. The version features re-mastered video and audio, using <a href="source_code" title="wikilink">source code</a> specifically re-written for the Nintendo DS. The remake features <a href="Ages_of_Myst#Rime" title="wikilink">Rime</a> as a playable Age, with an all new graphic set.<a href="#fn78" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref78"><sup>78</sup></a> <em>Myst DS</em> was released in North America on May 13, 2008. The title was heavily panned by the gaming press, with an aggregate score of 43/100 on Metacritic.<a href="#fn79" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref79"><sup>79</sup></a></p>
<p>In February 2005, Cyan and <a href="Mean_Hamster_Software" title="wikilink">Mean Hamster Software</a> released <em>Myst</em> for the Microsoft <a href="PocketPC" class="uri" title="wikilink">PocketPC</a> platform;<a href="#fn80" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref80"><sup>80</sup></a> shortly thereafter <a href="Riven" class="uri" title="wikilink">Riven</a> was also ported.<a href="#fn81" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref81"><sup>81</sup></a> In August 2008, Cyan announced that the company was developing a version of <em>Myst</em> for Apple's <a href="iOS_(Apple)" title="wikilink">iOS</a>.<a href="#fn82" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref82"><sup>82</sup></a> Cyan confirmed that the project was near completion in April 2009,<a href="#fn83" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref83"><sup>83</sup></a> submitting the title to Apple on April 22.<a href="#fn84" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref84"><sup>84</sup></a> The game was made available to download from the iTunes <a href="App_Store" title="wikilink">App Store</a> on May 2, 2009.<a href="#fn85" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref85"><sup>85</sup></a> The original download size was 727 MB, which was considered very large by iPhone standards.<a href="#fn86" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref86"><sup>86</sup></a></p>
