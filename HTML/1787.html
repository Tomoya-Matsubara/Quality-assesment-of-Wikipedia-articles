<p><strong>James Howard &quot;Jim&quot; Thome</strong> (;<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> born August 27, 1970) is an American <a href="professional_baseball" title="wikilink">baseball</a> <a href="designated_hitter" title="wikilink">designated hitter</a> and <a href="first_baseman" title="wikilink">first baseman</a>. He has played for the <a href="Cleveland_Indians" title="wikilink">Cleveland Indians</a>, <a href="Philadelphia_Phillies" title="wikilink">Philadelphia Phillies</a>, <a href="Chicago_White_Sox" title="wikilink">Chicago White Sox</a>, <a href="Los_Angeles_Dodgers" title="wikilink">Los Angeles Dodgers</a>, <a href="Minnesota_Twins" title="wikilink">Minnesota Twins</a>, and <a href="Baltimore_Orioles" title="wikilink">Baltimore Orioles</a>. Thome is a <a href="free_agent" title="wikilink">free agent</a>. In 1996, Thome won the <a href="Silver_Slugger_Award" title="wikilink">Silver Slugger Award</a> and in 2006, he won the <a href="Major_League_Baseball_Comeback_Player_of_the_Year_Award" title="wikilink">Comeback Player of the Year Award</a>. He has also received the <a href="Roberto_Clemente_Award" title="wikilink">Roberto Clemente Award</a> (2002), <a href="Babe_Ruth_Home_Run_Award" title="wikilink">Babe Ruth Home Run Award</a> (2003), and <a href="Lou_Gehrig_Memorial_Award" title="wikilink">Lou Gehrig Memorial Award</a> (2004). In 2011, he became the eighth MLB player to hit 600 home runs (HR). He has hit the seventh-most home runs of all-time with 612 and is 24th all-time for <a href="runs_batted_in" title="wikilink">runs batted in</a> (RBIs) with 1,699.</p>
<p>Thome was part of the Cleveland Indians core group of players who led the franchise to two <a href="World_Series" title="wikilink">World Series</a> appearances in three years during the mid-1990s. After spending over a decade with Cleveland, Thome signed a free agent contract with the Philadelphia Phillies, where he spent the next three seasons of his career. Traded to the White Sox before the 2006 season, he played in Chicago for three more seasons and joined the <a href="500_home_run_club" title="wikilink">500 home run club</a>. After a brief stint with the Dodgers, Thome played with the Minnesota Twins for two seasons before returning to Cleveland and then Philadelphia. He was traded to the Baltimore Orioles in 2012; at the end of the season he filed for free agency.</p>
<p>Throughout his career, Thome's strength has been power hitting. In six different seasons, he has hit more than 40 home runs; his career <a href="on-base_plus_slugging" title="wikilink">on-base plus slugging</a> (OPS) of .956 is 19th all-time. Later in his career, repeated back injuries which kept him from playing the field much. He primarily was a designated hitter. Thome is known for his batting stance, in which he holds the bat out with his right hand and points it at right field before the pitcher is ready to throw, which he first saw in <em><a href="The_Natural_(film)" title="wikilink">The Natural</a></em>;<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> and his constant positive attitude.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a><a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="early-life">Early life</h2>
<p>Thome was born in <a href="Peoria,_Illinois" title="wikilink">Peoria</a>, <a href="Illinois" class="uri" title="wikilink">Illinois</a> on August 27, 1970, the youngest of five children. All the members of his family played sports. His grandmother was hired at a local <a href="Caterpillar_Inc." title="wikilink">Caterpillar</a> plant solely to play for the company's softball team. His father built bulldozers for Caterpillar and played slow-pitch softball.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> Thome's two older brothers, Chuck III and Randy, played baseball at <a href="Limestone_Community_High_School_District_310" title="wikilink">Limestone High School</a>.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> Growing up, his favorite player was <a href="Dave_Kingman" title="wikilink">Dave Kingman</a>, and one day, while at <a href="Wrigley_Field" title="wikilink">Wrigley Field</a> trying to get Kingman's autograph, he sneaked into the Cubs' clubhouse to try to find Kingman. Though to his dismay he ultimately did not get Kingman's autograph, he did get the autographs of several others, and, because of his childhood difficulties in getting autographs, now makes a point to sign autographs for fans.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p>Like his older brothers, Thome attended Limestone<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> where he achieved all-state honors in both baseball, playing shortstop, and basketball. Although he had hoped to be noticed by scouts, his relatively small stature ( ) meant that he attracted only passing interest. Thome graduated in 1988 and, after not being drafted, enrolled at <a href="Illinois_Central_College" title="wikilink">Illinois Central College</a> where he continued his baseball and basketball careers.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> After one season, he was drafted by the <a href="Cleveland_Indians" title="wikilink">Cleveland Indians</a> in the 13th round of the <a href="1989_Major_League_Baseball_Draft" title="wikilink">1989 Major League Baseball Draft</a>.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>

<h3 id="cleveland-indians-1991u20132002">Cleveland Indians (1991&lt;U+2013&gt;2002)</h3>
<p>Thome was originally assigned to the <a href="GCL_Indians" title="wikilink">Gulf Coast League Indians</a>, where he played exclusively in 1989 posting a <a href="batting_average" title="wikilink">batting average</a> (BA) of .237 with no home runs and 22 RBIs.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> After his rookie season, he met &quot;hitting guru&quot; <a href="Charlie_Manuel" title="wikilink">Charlie Manuel</a>, who later was his manager and mentor. Unlike most Indians staff, Manuel saw potential in Thome and worked hard with him, particularly on how he used his hips in his swing. Thome later said, &quot;He saw something in me I didn't.&quot; During this work, Manuel suggested to Thome that he point his bat out to center field before the pitch to relax himself like <a href="Roy_Hobbs" title="wikilink">Roy Hobbs</a> did in <em><a href="The_Natural_(film)" title="wikilink">The Natural</a></em> when batting.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<p>The work paid off; in 1990, Thome hit .340 and totaled 16 home runs and 50 RBIs playing at both the <a href="Minor_League_Baseball#Rookie" title="wikilink">Rookie</a> and <a href="Minor_League_Baseball#Class_A" title="wikilink">Class A</a> levels. After splitting the 1991 season between <a href="Minor_League_Baseball#Double-A" title="wikilink">Double-A</a> and <a href="Triple-A_(baseball)" title="wikilink">Triple-A</a> where, in combination, he hit .319 with 7 home runs and 73 RBIs, Thome made his MLB debut on September 4, 1991, as a <a href="third_baseman" title="wikilink">third baseman</a> against the <a href="Minnesota_Twins" title="wikilink">Minnesota Twins</a>. In the game he had two hits in four at-bats (2-for-4) and recorded his first <a href="hit_(baseball)" title="wikilink">hit</a>. He hit his first career home run on October 4. Injuries shortened Thome's 1992 campaign during which he played for both the Indians and the <a href="Colorado_Springs_Sky_Sox" title="wikilink">Colorado Springs Sky Sox</a>, the Indians' Triple-A affiliate at the time. He combined to play 52 games with 4 home runs and 26 RBIs while hitting .236.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> Thome played mostly for the <a href="Charlotte_Knights" title="wikilink">Charlotte Knights</a>, the Indians' new Triple-A affiliate, in 1993. He led the <a href="International_League" title="wikilink">International League</a> with a .332 batting average and 102 RBIs, complemented by 25 home runs. This performance earned him a late season call up in which he hit .266 with 7 home runs and 22 RBIs in 47 games.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<p>In the 1994 offseason, Cleveland made several offseason acquisitions in an attempt to compete after six consecutive seasons with a losing record. <a href="Sandy_Alomar_Jr." title="wikilink">Sandy Alomar Jr.</a>, <a href="Kenny_Lofton" title="wikilink">Kenny Lofton</a>, <a href="Carlos_Baerga" title="wikilink">Carlos Baerga</a>, and <a href="Mark_Clark_(baseball)" title="wikilink">Mark Clark</a> were brought in to work with Thome and 22-year-old <a href="Manny_Ramirez" title="wikilink">Manny Ramirez</a>.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> For the first time in his career, Thome spent the entire year with Cleveland, playing in 98 games while hitting .268 with 20 home runs and 52 RBIs.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> This group led the Indians to within one game of the <a href="1994_Chicago_White_Sox_season" title="wikilink">Chicago White Sox</a>'s <a href="American_League_Central" title="wikilink">American League Central</a> lead and a <a href="Major_League_Baseball_Wild_Card" title="wikilink">wild card</a> spot prior to <a href="1994&lt;U+2013&gt;95_Major_League_Baseball_strike" title="wikilink">the 1994 players' strike</a>, which forced cancellation of the season's remaining games.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> During the strike-shortened season, Thome had his first career multi-home run game, hitting two solo home runs on June 22, 1994 against <a href="Detroit_Tigers" title="wikilink">Detroit Tigers</a>' pitcher <a href="John_Doherty_(pitcher)" title="wikilink">John Doherty</a>.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> Despite Thome's statistical improvement in 1994, it was not until  that the Indians' success led to a playoff berth. Thome led the team by hitting .314 with 25 home runs and 73 RBIs and the Indians finished with a 100&lt;U+2013&gt;44 record to win the American League Central, but lost the World Series to the Atlanta Braves in six games. Thome hit .211 in the World Series with one home run and two runs batted in.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> Coming into the 1996 season, sportswriters predicted that Thome would move up in the batting order and bat in the sixth position.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> (He had previously hit anywhere from the fifth to the eighth positions during his first two seasons.)<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a><a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> During the 1996 season, Thome hit 38 home runs, once hitting a  homer at Cleveland's <a href="Jacobs_Field" title="wikilink">Jacobs Field</a>, the longest home run ever at a Cleveland ballpark.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a></p>
<p>Originally a third baseman, the Indians moved Thome to first base in 1997 after they acquired third baseman <a href="Matt_Williams_(third_baseman)" title="wikilink">Matt Williams</a>.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a><a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> In 1997, Thome helped the Indians hit a club record 220 home runs, contributing 40 of them. Thome also totaled an American League high 120 <a href="base_on_balls" title="wikilink">walks</a> to go along with 102 RBIs. Cleveland returned to the <a href="1997_World_Series" title="wikilink">World Series</a> that year powered by their record offense, but they lost to the Florida Marlins in seven games. Thome hit .286 with two home runs and four RBIs.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a></p>
<p>The next three seasons would not be as successful for either Thome or the Indians as the previous three had been. In July 1998, Thome hit his 24th home run of the season while helping the Indians snap the Yankees' 10 game winning streak.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a><a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> An article in <em><a href="Sports_Illustrated" title="wikilink">Sports Illustrated</a></em> published in July 1998 commented that despite Thome's early career success (two all-star games and two of the previous three World Series), he was only &quot;faintly famous&quot; nationally and was not particularly well-known outside of Cleveland and hometown Peoria. His former teammate <a href="Jeromy_Burnitz" title="wikilink">Jeromy Burnitz</a> noted that:  In August, Thome broke a bone in his right hand and spent several weeks on the disabled list missing 35 games.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a><a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a><a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> He finished the year with 30 home runs and 85 RBIs while posting a .293 batting average.

<p>Headed into 1999, there were high hopes for the Indians; writers expected Thome to bat in the <a href="cleanup_hitter" title="wikilink">cleanup spot</a>.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> The next year in May, Thome hit a <a href="grand_slam_(baseball)" title="wikilink">grand slam</a> against Yankees pitcher <a href="Orlando_Hernandez" title="wikilink">Orlando Hernandez</a>, which helped Cleveland to a 7&lt;U+2013&gt;1 victory.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> In total, his batting averaged decreased, falling to .277, but he improved both his home run and RBI totals by posting 33 and 108 respectively. In game one of the <a href="1999_American_League_Division_Series" title="wikilink">ALDS</a>, Thome hit a game-tying two-run home run off of <a href="Derek_Lowe" title="wikilink">Derek Lowe</a> (Cleveland would go on to defeat the <a href="1999_Boston_Red_Sox_season" title="wikilink">Boston Red Sox</a> by a score of 3&lt;U+2013&gt;2).<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> However, after going up two games to none, Cleveland lost the series.</p>

He and <a href="Juan_Gonzalez_(baseball)" title="wikilink">Juan Gonzalez</a>, who totaled 140 RBI, powered the Indians to another division title. Despite these numbers, the Indians could once again only reach the <a href="American_League_Division_Series" title="wikilink">American League Division Series</a>, where they lost in five games to the <a href="2001_Seattle_Mariners_season" title="wikilink">Seattle Mariners</a>.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a></p>
<p>Thome had his best season in 2002, leading the American League in walks (122), slugging percentage (.677) and OPS (1.122), while batting .304 (16th in AL) with a .445 on-base percentage (2nd in AL). He also hit a career high 52 home runs (2nd in AL) and collected 118 runs batted in (7th in AL).
