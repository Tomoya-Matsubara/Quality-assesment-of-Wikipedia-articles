<p><img src="Leaf_Hills.jpg" title="fig:Photograph c. 1895 of Leaf Hills in west-central Minnesota" alt="Photograph c. 1895 of Leaf Hills in west-central Minnesota" width="275" />The <strong>Leaf Hills Moraines</strong>, sometimes called the <strong>Leaf Mountains</strong>, are a range of hills in west-central <a href="Minnesota" class="uri" title="wikilink">Minnesota</a>. The land, while not exhibiting many characteristics of mountains, nevertheless rises typically to a height of  to  above the surrounding farmland through the duration of its range, occasionally reaching higher than . The name of this range of hills is translated from the <a href="Anishinaabe_language" title="wikilink">Ojibwe</a> <em>Gaaskibag-wajiwan</em>, which was interpreted by <a href="Joseph_Gilfillan" title="wikilink">Gilfillan</a> as &lt;U+201C&gt;Rustling Leaf Mountains.&lt;U+201D&gt; The name is also shared by <a href="Leaf_Mountain_Township,_Minnesota" title="wikilink">Leaf Mountain Township</a>, the two Leaf Lakes (&quot;<em>Gaaskibag-wajiwi-zaaga'iganan</em>&quot;), and the <a href="Leaf_River_(Minnesota)" title="wikilink">Leaf River</a> (&quot;<em>Gaaskibag-wajiwi-ziibi</em>&quot;), all named for the hills.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> In turn, the hills in Ojibwe are named after <a href="Inspiration_Peak" title="wikilink">Inspiration Peak</a> (&quot;<em>Gaaskibag-wajiw</em>&quot;), the highest hill of this hill range.</p>
<h2 id="description">Description</h2>
<p>The hills are described by <a href="Warren_Upham" title="wikilink">Upham</a> as &quot;running southeast from Fergus Falls to the south line of the county and thence east and northeast to East Leaf Lake, a distance of 50 miles.&quot;<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> Through their full extent in <a href="Otter_Tail_County" title="wikilink">Otter Tail County</a>, the hills have steeply sloped sides covered by <a href="prairie" title="wikilink">prairies</a> and <a href="deciduous" class="uri" title="wikilink">deciduous</a> forests, primarily <a href="Maple" class="uri" title="wikilink">Maple</a> and <a href="Oak" class="uri" title="wikilink">Oak</a>. In most regions these hills would not be considered mountains, but in generally flat Minnesota they are significant and unique features of the landscape, much more notable than in a really mountainous area.</p>
<h2 id="geology">Geology</h2>
<p>The hills are formed by the convergence of the eighth and ninth <a href="moraines" title="wikilink">marginal moraines</a> formed by the <a href="Wadena_lobe" title="wikilink">Wadena</a> and <a href="Des_Moines_lobe" title="wikilink">Des Moines lobes</a> of the <a href="Wisconsonian_glaciation" title="wikilink">Wisconsonian glaciation</a>. This moraine forms an arc about ten to twenty miles (16 -32 km) wide and 200 miles (320 km) long. It is composed of a huge volume of morainic drift up to  thick, overlain with thin sandy soil as well as rocks and boulders.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>

<p><img src="View_from_top_of_Inspiration_Peak.jpg" title="fig:View from top of Inspiration Peak" alt="View from top of Inspiration Peak" /> The hills' outline is not regular, but erratic, and in many places the range is broken by rivers, streams, and Minnesota&lt;U+2019&gt;s famous lakes. Only a few of the many high points of the range have received names. Prominent among them are <a href="Indian_Hill_(Minnesota)" title="wikilink">Indian Hill</a> and <a href="Inspiration_Peak" title="wikilink">Inspiration Peak</a>.</p>
<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<p><a href="Paleoindians" class="uri" title="wikilink">Paleoindians</a> lived in the area at least 6,000 years ago,<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> and perhaps longer, as earlier remains have been found in the general vicinity.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a><a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> Artifacts from both the <em>Prairie</em> and <a href="Woodland_culture" title="wikilink">Woodland cultures</a> have been found; most items date from a period starting 900 to 1200 years ago.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> In more recent times, the region was held by the <a href="Dakota_people" title="wikilink">Dakota</a> until they were displaced by the <a href="Ojibwa" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ojibwa</a> in the Eighteenth Century.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p>Also in the Eighteenth Century, the area became a source of pelts for the <a href="fur_trade" title="wikilink">fur trade</a>. In the 1840s, the mountains were pierced by the <a href="Red_River_Trails#Woods_Trail" title="wikilink">Woods Trail</a> and skirted by the <a href="Red_River_Trails#East_Plains_Trail" title="wikilink">East Plains Trail</a>, two of the <a href="Red_River_Trails" title="wikilink">Red River Trails</a> between <a href="Fort_Garry" title="wikilink">Fort Garry</a> (modern <a href="Winnipeg" class="uri" title="wikilink">Winnipeg</a>) and <a href="Saint_Paul,_Minnesota" title="wikilink">Saint Paul, Minnesota</a>.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> These trails opened up the area to settlement in the last half of the Nineteenth Century.</p>
<p>Due to their steepness and the abundance of <a href="fieldstone" class="uri" title="wikilink">fieldstone</a> and boulders, the hills were found by pioneers to be generally unsuitable for plowing but well suited for raising and grazing <a href="livestock" class="uri" title="wikilink">livestock</a>. Part of the region has been preserved in <a href="Maplewood_State_Park" title="wikilink">Maplewood State Park</a>.</p>
