<p>The law limited <a href="wildcat_strikes" title="wikilink">wildcat strikes</a> and prohibited limitations on legitimate <a href="Strike_action" title="wikilink">strikes</a>. It also established the <a href="National_Industrial_Relations_Court" title="wikilink">National Industrial Relations Court</a>, which was empowered to grant <a href="injunctions" class="uri" title="wikilink">injunctions</a> as necessary to prevent injurious strikes and also to settle a variety of labour disputes. The Act repealed portions of the Trade Disputes and Trade Unions Act 1927, which prohibited <a href="general_strikes" title="wikilink">general strikes</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="Trades_Union_Congress" title="wikilink">Trades Union Congress</a> under the leadership of <a href="General_Secretary_of_the_TUC" title="wikilink">General Secretary</a> <a href="Vic_Feather" title="wikilink">Vic Feather</a> campaigned against the legislation with a nationwide &quot;Kill the Bill&quot; campaign. <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/march/1/newsid_2514000/2514033.stm">1</a> On <a href="12_January" title="wikilink">12 January</a>, <a href="1971" class="uri" title="wikilink">1971</a> the TUC held a 'day of action' in protest, with a march through London. In March, 1,500,000 members of the <a href="Amalgamated_Engineering_Union" title="wikilink">Amalgamated Engineering Union</a> staged a one day strike. After the Bill received Royal Assent, in September 1971 the TUC voted to require its member unions not to comply with its provisions (including registering as a union under the Act). The <a href="Transport_and_General_Workers_Union" title="wikilink">Transport and General Workers Union</a> was twice fined for <a href="contempt_of_court" title="wikilink">contempt of court</a> over its refusal to comply. However, some smaller unions did comply and 32 were suspended from membership of the TUC at the 1972 congress.</p>

<p>Campaigning against the Bill eventually coalesced around individual workers. When the <a href="Pentonville_Five" title="wikilink">Pentonville Five</a> were arrested for refusing to appear before the National Industrial Relations Court and imprisoned in the summer of 1972, their case received great publicity. Eventually, the <a href="Official_Solicitor" title="wikilink">Official Solicitor</a> intervened to order their release.</p>
