<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<p>The gardens opened in 1828 as the private Royal Belfast Botanical Gardens. It continued as a private park for many years, only opening to members of the public on Sundays prior to 1895. Then it became a public park in 1895 when the Belfast Corporation bought the gardens from the Belfast Botanical and Horticultural Society. The Belfast Corporation was the predecessor of <a href="Belfast_City_Council" title="wikilink">Belfast City Council</a>, the present owner.</p>
<h2 id="the-palm-house">The Palm House</h2>
<p>The gardens' most notable feature is the Palm House. The foundation stone was laid by the <a href="George_Chichester,_3rd_Marquess_of_Donegall" title="wikilink">Marquess of Donegall</a> in 1839 and work was completed in 1840. It is one of the earliest examples of a curvilinear <a href="cast_iron" title="wikilink">cast iron</a> <a href="glasshouse" class="uri" title="wikilink">glasshouse</a> in the world. Designed by <a href="Charles_Lanyon" title="wikilink">Charles Lanyon</a> and built by <a href="Richard_Turner_(iron-founder)" title="wikilink">Richard Turner</a>, Belfast's Palm House predates the glasshouses at <a href="Royal_Botanic_Gardens,_Kew" title="wikilink">Kew</a> and the <a href="Irish_National_Botanic_Gardens" title="wikilink">Irish National Botanic Gardens</a> at <a href="Glasnevin" class="uri" title="wikilink">Glasnevin</a>. Turner went on to build both of these glasshouses. The Palm House consists of two wings, the cool wing and the tropical wing which contains the dome. Lanyon altered his original plans to increase the height of the dome, allowing for much taller plants. In the past these have included an 11 metre tall <em>Globe Spear Lily</em>. The <a href="Lilium" title="wikilink">lily</a>, which is native to <a href="Australia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Australia</a>, finally bloomed in March 2005 after a 23 year wait. The Palm House also features a 400 year old <em><a href="Xanthorrhoea" class="uri" title="wikilink">Xanthorrhoea</a></em>.</p>
