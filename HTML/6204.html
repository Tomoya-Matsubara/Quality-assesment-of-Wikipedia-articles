The suspect, Michael &quot;Styx&quot; Addison, fled the state of <a href="New_Hampshire" title="wikilink">New Hampshire</a>, prompting a <a href="manhunt" class="uri" title="wikilink">manhunt</a> by police. 15 hours after the shooting, Addison was arrested in <a href="Dorchester,_Massachusetts" title="wikilink">Dorchester, Massachusetts</a> and was extradited back to New Hampshire.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> Addison was charged with the shooting of Michael Briggs and fleeing police.

<h3 id="michael-styx-addison">Michael &quot;Styx&quot; Addison</h3>
<p>Michael &quot;Styx&quot; Addison (b. 1980) was a resident of Manchester, New Hampshire. Before the <a href="October_16" title="wikilink">October 16</a>, <a href="2006" class="uri" title="wikilink">2006</a> shooting, Addison had previous run-ins with the police. In 1997, Addison was charged with <a href="assault" class="uri" title="wikilink">assault</a> and <a href="battery_(crime)" title="wikilink">battery</a> after an armed robbery attempt, that resulted in Addison being sentenced 2-3 years in prison for that crime and three years of probation upon his release on his 21st birthday. In 2000, however, Addison was sentenced to jail again for violating his probation. In October 2003, Addison was arrested in Londonderry, NH, and charged with false imprisonment.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> A month later, Addison pled guilty to <a href="criminal_restraint" title="wikilink">criminal restraint</a>, a misdemeanor, in the dispute over drug money. Addison was sentenced to six months in the Rockingham County House of Corrections for that charge.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> In addition, Addison had previous run-ins with Officer Briggs. In 2002, Addison was arrested by Briggs near the <a href="Queen_City_Bridge" title="wikilink">Queen City Bridge</a>.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> In March 2003, Addison received first aid by Briggs after a shooting incident.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<p>Addison is the adopted son of Lucious Addison, a disabled Viet Nam veteran, and was primarily reared by his grandmother in North Carolina.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a>Many family relatives described him as a loving and responsible parent to his son despite his criminal record. In a 2004 juvenile court case, a paternity test proved that Addison was the father of that child. As of October 2006, the child is currently adopted by someone else.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="october-16-2006-shooting">October 16, 2006 Shooting</h2>
<p>On <a href="October_16" title="wikilink">October 16</a>, <a href="2006" class="uri" title="wikilink">2006</a>, Officer Michael Briggs and his partner John Breckenridge were responding to a domestic disturbance call involving Addison and Antonie Bell-Rodgers. When the two officers spotted the suspects, Briggs ordered them to stop. Bell-Rodgers stopped but Addison continued walking away. When Officer Briggs commanded Addison to stop, Addison turned and shot Briggs. Bell-Rodgers surrendered to police but Addison fled the <a href="crime_scene" title="wikilink">crime scene</a>. Later, police found Addison's gun and t-shirt.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> In a court reenactment, eyewitnesses claimed that moments before the shooting, they saw a dark gray van and two men jumping out of it and running north towards <a href="Lincoln_Street" title="wikilink">Lincoln Street</a> where the shooting took place. <a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
<p>A <a href="manhunt" class="uri" title="wikilink">manhunt</a> was launched after the shooting, as <a href="SWAT" class="uri" title="wikilink">SWAT</a> teams and local police searched throughout the city of Manchester looking for Addison. A SWAT team showed up at an apartment building where Addison's girlfriend Angela Swist lived and found clothing stained with blood in a <a href="bathtub" class="uri" title="wikilink">bathtub</a> and a bottle of bleach nearby and questioned Swist. Later the police conducted search warrants at two other apartment buildings where they found more evidence.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> The manhunt forced several schools to be placed under <a href="lockdown" class="uri" title="wikilink">lockdown</a> as police and SWAT teams searched vehicles leaving or coming to work or school.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> The search later expanded into <a href="Massachusetts" class="uri" title="wikilink">Massachusetts</a> after an Internet search revealed Addison's previous address in Massachusetts and police using <a href="GPS" class="uri" title="wikilink">GPS</a> to track his cell phone calls to an apartment building outside of <a href="Boston,_Massachusetts" title="wikilink">Boston</a> where Addison was later found by police.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a><a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a><a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a>After a stand-off with <a href="police" class="uri" title="wikilink">police</a>, Addison was soon arrested.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a><a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="extradition-and-charges">Extradition and charges</h3>
<p>Addison was extradited back to New Hampshire<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> and denied his role in the murder. During a taped interview, Addison told his story six different times before confessing to authorities that he shot at the police officers coming towards him.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> The <a href="Manchester,_New_Hampshire" title="wikilink">Manchester District Court</a> charged Addison with <a href="capital_murder" title="wikilink">capital murder</a>. <a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a>As a result of the charge, prosecutors against Addison sought the <a href="death_penalty" title="wikilink">death penalty</a> as stated under <a href="Capital_punishment_in_New_Hampshire" title="wikilink">New Hampshire state law</a> that a murder of a police officer is punishable by death. <a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> Later Addison was also charged with <a href="armed_robbery" title="wikilink">armed robbery</a>, <a href="conspiracy" class="uri" title="wikilink">conspiracy</a> and felony possession of a firearm in relation to a five day crime spree that started a week before the shooting.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="investigation-and-further-arrests">Investigation and further arrests</h3>
<p>An investigation conducted by local officials followed the shooting. During the investigation two women connected to Michael Addison turned themselves in to police after authorities issued <a href="Warrant_(law)" title="wikilink">warrants</a>&lt;U+2014&gt; for their arrest and the fact that they were accused of robbing a <a href="7-Eleven" class="uri" title="wikilink">7-Eleven</a> store five days before the shooting. During an interview with police, one of the women, Angela Swist, told officers that she drove Addison and Anthonie Rodgers to the 7-Eleven on <a href="October_11" title="wikilink">October 11</a>, where Addison and his accomplice robbed the store and fled. She also admitted that she was the driver of the get-away car. <a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a></p>
<p>Antoine Bell-Rogers, one of the men arrested at the scene of the <a href="October_16" title="wikilink">October 16</a>, <a href="2006" class="uri" title="wikilink">2006</a> shooting, was charged with firing a <a href="handgun" class="uri" title="wikilink">handgun</a> at an apartment and felony possession of a firearm but was not charged in connection with the shooting of officer Michael Briggs. A grand jury, however, charged Rodgers with armed robbery and conspiracy after robbing a convenience store five days before the shooting. A bail of $50,000 (2006 <a href="USD" class="uri" title="wikilink">USD</a>) was set in October 2006 and was upheld in January 2007.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> On <a href="March_5" title="wikilink">March 5</a>, <a href="2007" class="uri" title="wikilink">2007</a>, Bell-Rodgers asked the court to have his felony charges dropped.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a></p>
<p>On <a href="March_28" title="wikilink">March 28</a>, <a href="2007" class="uri" title="wikilink">2007</a>, the Hillsborough County Superior Court re-indicted Bell-Rodgers of the weapons charges after a defense lawyer tried to dismiss Bell-Rodgers original indictment.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> That same day, Teresia Shipley pleaded guilty for the charges of helping Addison robbing a convenience store days before the shooting.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a></p>
