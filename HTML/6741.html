<p><strong>Ernest Miller Hemingway</strong> (July 21, 1899 &lt;U+2013&gt; July 2, 1961) was an American <a href="American_literature" title="wikilink">writer</a> and <a href="journalist" class="uri" title="wikilink">journalist</a>. His distinctive writing style&lt;U+2014&gt;known as the <a href="iceberg_theory" title="wikilink">iceberg theory</a>&lt;U+2014&gt;characterized by economy and <a href="understatement" class="uri" title="wikilink">understatement</a>, influenced 20th-century fiction, as did his apparent life of adventure and the public image he cultivated. He produced most of his work between the mid-1920s and the mid-1950s, and his career peaked in 1954 when he won the <a href="Nobel_Prize_in_Literature" title="wikilink">Nobel Prize in Literature</a>. Hemingway's fiction was successful because the characters he presented exhibited authenticity that reverberated with his audience. Many of his works are classics of <a href="American_literature" title="wikilink">American literature</a>. He published seven novels, six short stories collections, and two non-fiction works during his lifetime; with a further three novels, four collections of short stories, and three non-fiction works published after his death.</p>
<p>Hemingway was born and raised in Oak Park, Illinois. After leaving high school he worked for a few months as a reporter, before leaving for the <a href="Italian_Campaign_(World_War_I)" title="wikilink">Italian front</a> to become an <a href="Red_Cross" title="wikilink">ambulance driver</a> during World War I, which became the basis for his novel <em><a href="A_Farewell_to_Arms" title="wikilink">A Farewell to Arms</a></em>. He was seriously wounded and returned home within the year. In 1922 Hemingway married <a href="Hadley_Richardson" title="wikilink">Hadley Richardson</a>, the first of his four wives, and the couple moved to Paris, where he worked as a <a href="Correspondent" title="wikilink">foreign correspondent</a>. During his time there he met and was influenced by <a href="modernism" title="wikilink">modernist</a> writers and artists of the 1920s expatriate community known as the &quot;<a href="Lost_Generation" title="wikilink">Lost Generation</a>&quot;. His first novel, <em><a href="The_Sun_Also_Rises" title="wikilink">The Sun Also Rises</a></em>, was written in 1924.</p>
<p>After divorcing Hadley Richardson in 1927 Hemingway married <a href="Pauline_Pfeiffer" title="wikilink">Pauline Pfeiffer</a>; they divorced following Hemingway's return from covering the <a href="Spanish_Civil_War" title="wikilink">Spanish Civil War</a>, after which he wrote <em><a href="For_Whom_the_Bell_Tolls" title="wikilink">For Whom the Bell Tolls</a></em>. <a href="Martha_Gellhorn" title="wikilink">Martha Gellhorn</a> became his third wife in 1940, but he left her for <a href="Mary_Welsh_Hemingway" title="wikilink">Mary Welsh Hemingway</a> after World War II, during which he was present at <a href="Normandy_Landings" title="wikilink">D-Day</a> and the <a href="liberation_of_Paris" title="wikilink">liberation of Paris</a>.</p>
<p>Shortly after the publication of <em><a href="The_Old_Man_and_the_Sea" title="wikilink">The Old Man and the Sea</a></em> in 1952 Hemingway went on safari to Africa, where he was almost killed in a plane crash that left him in pain or ill-health for much of the rest of his life. Hemingway had permanent residences in <a href="Key_West" title="wikilink">Key West</a>, Florida, and <a href="Cuba" class="uri" title="wikilink">Cuba</a> during the 1930s and 40s, but in 1959 he moved from Cuba to <a href="Idaho" class="uri" title="wikilink">Idaho</a>, where he committed suicide in the summer of 1961.</p>

<p>Hemingway returned home early in 1919 to a time of readjustment. At not yet 20 years old, the war had created in him a maturity at odds with living at home without a job and the need for recuperation.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> Biographer Michael Reynolds explains Hemingway &quot;could not really tell his parents what he thought when he saw his bloody knee.

The trip became the inspiration for his short story &quot;<a href="Big_Two-Hearted_River" title="wikilink">Big Two-Hearted River</a>&quot;, in which the <a href="semi-autobiographical" class="uri" title="wikilink">semi-autobiographical</a> character <a href="Nick_Adams_(character)" title="wikilink">Nick Adams</a> takes to the country to find solitude after returning from war.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> A family friend offered him a job in Toronto; having nothing else to do he accepted.

After World War I, he and other modernists &quot;lost faith in the central institutions of Western civilization&quot;, by reacting against the &quot;elaborate style&quot; of 19th century writers; and by creating a style &quot;in which meaning is established through dialogue, through action, and silences&lt;U+2014&gt;a fiction in which nothing crucial&lt;U+2014&gt;or at least very little&lt;U+2014&gt;is stated explicitly.&quot;<a href="#fn185" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref185"><sup>185</sup></a></p>

<p>Because he began as a writer of short stories, Baker believes Hemingway learned to &quot;get the most from the least, how to prune language how to multiply intensities, and how to tell nothing but the truth in a way that allowed for telling more than the truth&quot;.<a href="#fn187" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref187"><sup>187</sup></a> Hemingway referred to his style as the <a href="Iceberg_Theory" title="wikilink">iceberg theory</a>: in his writing the facts float above water; the supporting structure and symbolism operate out-of-sight.<a href="#fn188" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref188"><sup>188</sup></a> Writing in &quot;The Art of the Short Story&quot;, he explains: &quot;A few things I have found to be true.

<p>Jackson Benson believes Hemingway used autobiographical details as framing devices about life in general&lt;U+2014&gt;not only about his life. For example, Benson postulates that Hemingway used his experiences and drew them out with &quot;what if&quot; scenarios: &quot;what if I were wounded in such a way that I could not sleep at night? What if I were wounded and made crazy, what would happen if I were sent back to the front?&quot;<a href="#fn190" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref190"><sup>190</sup></a> The concept of the iceberg theory is sometimes referred to as the &quot;theory of omission.&quot; Hemingway believed the writer could describe one thing (such as Nick Adams fishing in &quot;The Big Two-Hearted River&quot;) though an entirely different thing occurs below the surface (Nick Adams concentrating on fishing to the extent that he does not have to think about anything else).<a href="#fn191" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref191"><sup>191</sup></a></p>
<p>The simplicity of the prose is deceptive. Zoe Trodd believes Hemingway crafted skeletal sentences in response to <a href="Henry_James" title="wikilink">Henry James</a>'s observation that World War I had &quot;used up words&quot;. Hemingway offers a &quot;multi-focal&quot; photographic reality. His iceberg theory of omission is the foundation on which he builds. The syntax, which lacks <a href="grammatical_conjunction" title="wikilink">subordinating conjunctions</a>, creates static sentences. The photographic &quot;<a href="Snapshot_(photography)" title="wikilink">snapshot</a>&quot; style creates a <a href="collage" class="uri" title="wikilink">collage</a> of images. Many types of internal punctuation (colons, semicolons, dashes, parentheses) are omitted in favor of short declarative sentences. The sentences build upon another, as events build to create a sense of the whole. Multiple strands exist in one story; an &quot;embedded text&quot; bridges to a different angle. He also uses other cinematic techniques of &quot;cutting&quot; quickly from one scene to the next; or of &quot;splicing&quot; a scene into another. Intentional omissions allow the reader to fill the gap, as though responding to instructions from the author, and create three-dimensional prose.<a href="#fn192" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref192"><sup>192</sup></a></p>

The dark woman&lt;U+2014&gt;<a href="Brett_Ashley" title="wikilink">Brett Ashley</a> of <em>The Sun Also Rises</em>&lt;U+2014&gt;is a goddess; the light woman&lt;U+2014&gt;Margot Macomber of &quot;The Short Happy Life of Francis Macomber&quot;&lt;U+2014&gt;is a murderess.<a href="#fn206" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref206"><sup>206</sup></a> Robert Sholes admits that early Hemingway stories, such as &quot;A Very Short Story&quot;, present &quot;a male character favorably and a female unfavorably.&quot;<a href="#fn207" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref207"><sup>207</sup></a> According to Rena Sanderson, early Hemingway critics lauded his male-centric world of masculine pursuits, and the fiction divided women into &quot;castrators or love-slaves.&quot; Feminist critics attacked Hemingway as &quot;public enemy number one&quot;, although more recent re-evaluations of his work &quot;have given new visibility to Hemingway's female characters (and their strengths) and have revealed his own sensitivity to gender issues, thus casting doubts on the old assumption that his writings were one-sidedly masculine.&quot;<a href="#fn208" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref208"><sup>208</sup></a> Nina Baym believes that Brett Ashley and Margot Macomber &quot;are the two outstanding examples of Hemingway's 'bitch women.'&quot;<a href="#fn209" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref209"><sup>209</sup></a></p>
<p>The theme of women and death is evident in stories as early as &quot;Indian Camp&quot;. The theme of death permeates Hemingway's work. Young believes the emphasis in &quot;Indian Camp&quot; was not so much on the woman who gives birth or the father who commits suicide, but on Nick Adams who witnesses these events as a child, and becomes a &quot;badly scarred and nervous young man.&quot; Hemingway sets the events in &quot;Indian Camp&quot; that shape the Adams persona. Young believes &quot;Indian Camp&quot; holds the &quot;master key&quot; to &quot;what its author was up to for some thirty-five years of his writing career.&quot; <a href="#fn210" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref210"><sup>210</sup></a> Stoltzfus considers Hemingway's work to be more complex with a representation of the truth inherent in <a href="existentialism" class="uri" title="wikilink">existentialism</a>: if &quot;nothingness&quot; is embraced, then redemption is achieved at the moment of death. Those who face death with dignity and courage live an authentic life. Francis Macomber dies happy because the last hours of his life are authentic; the <a href="bullfighter" class="uri" title="wikilink">bullfighter</a> in the <a href="Bullfighting" title="wikilink">corrida</a> represents the pinnacle of a life lived with authenticity.<a href="#fn211" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref211"><sup>211</sup></a> In his paper <em>The Uses of Authenticity: Hemingway and the Literary Field</em>, Timo M&lt;U+00FC&gt;ller writes that Hemingway's fiction is successful because the characters live an &quot;authentic life&quot;, and the &quot;soldiers, fishers, boxers and backwoodsmen are among the archetypes of authenticity in modern literature&quot;.<ref name="M<U+00FC>ller 2010&quot;/&gt;</p>
<p>The theme of emasculation is prevalent in Hemingway's work, most notably in <em>The Sun Also Rises</em>. Emasculation, according to Fiedler, is a result of a generation of wounded soldiers; and of a generation in which women such as Brett gained <a href="Women&#39;s_suffrage" title="wikilink">emancipation</a>.<a href="#fn212" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref212"><sup>212</sup></a> Baker believes Hemingway's work emphasizes the &quot;natural&quot; versus the &quot;unnatural&quot;. In &quot;Alpine Idyll&quot; the &quot;unnaturalness&quot; of skiing in the high country late spring snow is juxtaposed against the &quot;unnaturalness&quot; of the peasant who allowed his wife's dead body to linger too long in the shed during the winter. The skiers and peasant retreat to the valley to the &quot;natural&quot; spring for redemption.<a href="#fn213" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref213"><sup>213</sup></a></p>
<p>Hemingway's work has been characterized as misogynistic and homophobic. Susan Beegel analyzed four decades of Hemingway criticism, published in her essay &quot;Critical Reception&quot;. She found, particularly in the 1980s, &quot;critics interested in multiculturalism&quot; simply ignored Hemingway; although some &quot;apologetics&quot; have been written. Typical is this analysis of <em>The Sun Also Rises</em>: &quot;Hemingway never lets the reader forget that Cohn is a Jew, not an unattractive character who happens to be a Jew but a character who is unattractive because he is a Jew.&quot; During the same decade, according to Beegel, criticism was published that investigated the &quot;horror of homosexuality&quot;, and racism in Hemingway's fiction.<a href="#fn214" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref214"><sup>214</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="influence-and-legacy">Influence and legacy</h2>
<p>Hemingway's legacy to American literature is his style: writers who came after him emulated it or avoided it.<a href="#fn215" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref215"><sup>215</sup></a> As early as the 1930s Hemingway's style was <a href="parody" title="wikilink">parodied</a>, while critics pointed to it as &quot;lazy&quot; within the context of the &quot;American literary tradition&quot;.<a href="#fn216" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref216"><sup>216</sup></a> After his reputation was sealed with the publication of <em>The Sun Also Rises</em>, he became the spokesperson for the post-World War I generation, having established a style to follow.<a href="#fn217" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref217"><sup>217</sup></a> His books were <a href="Nazi_book_burning" title="wikilink">burned</a> in Berlin in 1933, &quot;as being a monument of modern decadence&quot;, and disavowed by his parents as &quot;filth&quot;.<a href="#fn218" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref218"><sup>218</sup></a> Reynolds asserts the legacy is that &quot;he left stories and novels so starkly moving that some have become part of our cultural heritage.&quot;<a href="#fn219" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref219"><sup>219</sup></a> In a 2004 speech at the <a href="John_F._Kennedy_Library" title="wikilink">John F.

<p>Benson believes the details of Hemingway's life have become a &quot;prime vehicle for exploitation&quot;, creating a &quot;Hemingway industry&quot;.<a href="#fn221" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref221"><sup>221</sup></a> Hemingway scholar Hallengren believes the &quot;hard boiled style&quot;, and the machismo, must be separated from the author himself. <a href="#fn222" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref222"><sup>222</sup></a> Benson agrees, describing him as introverted and private as <a href="J._D._Salinger" title="wikilink">J.

<p>The extent of Hemingway's influence is seen in the tributes, and echoes of his fiction found in popular culture. The <a href="International_Imitation_Hemingway_Competition" title="wikilink">International Imitation Hemingway Competition</a> was created in the 1980s to publicly acknowledge his influence and the comically misplaced efforts of lesser authors to imitate his style.

<p>In 1965 Mary Hemingway established the Hemingway Foundation, and in the 1970s she donated her husband's papers to the John F. Kennedy Library.
