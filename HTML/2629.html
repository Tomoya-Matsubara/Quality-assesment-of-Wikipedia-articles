<p>In 2007, Tamerlan confronted a <a href="Brazil" title="wikilink">Brazilian</a> youth who had dated his younger sister, Bella, for about two years, and punched him in the face.

<p>The Tsarnaev brothers' uncle, Ruslan Tsarni, said he &quot;had been concerned about his nephew being an extremist since 2009&quot;. Tsarni said that Tamerlan's radicalization started not during his visit to Russia in January 2012, but much earlier in Boston after he was influenced by a Muslim convert known as &quot;Misha&quot;.<a href="#fn78" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref78"><sup>78</sup></a> &quot;Misha&quot; was later identified as Mikhail Allakhverdov, a 39-year-old from <a href="Rhode_Island" title="wikilink">Rhode Island</a> (originally from <a href="Azerbaijan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Azerbaijan</a>).<a href="#fn79" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref79"><sup>79</sup></a> Allakhverdov told the <em><a href="The_New_York_Review_of_Books" title="wikilink">The New York Review of Books</a></em> that he rejected violence, was not Tamerlan's teacher, had not spoken to Tamerlan in three years and had never met his family members.

Thousands of dollars worth of marijuana and cash were left covering the victims' bodies, and $5,000 was left at the scene.<a href="#fn115" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref115"><sup>115</sup></a> The local district attorney said that it appeared that the killer and the victims knew each other. It was reported on April 23, 2013, that local authorities believed Tamerlan may have been responsible for the triple homicide, and they and the FBI were actively investigating the possibility.<a href="#fn116" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref116"><sup>116</sup></a><a href="#fn117" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref117"><sup>117</sup></a><a href="#fn118" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref118"><sup>118</sup></a><a href="#fn119" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref119"><sup>119</sup></a><a href="#fn120" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref120"><sup>120</sup></a> In May, forensic evidence connected the two brothers to the scene of the killings, and their cell phone records appeared to place them in the area. The officials cautioned that until more definitive DNA testing is complete, it is still too early to consider bringing an indictment against the younger of the two brothers.<a href="#fn121" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref121"><sup>121</sup></a></p>

<p>Tamerlan traveled to Russia through Moscow's <a href="Domodedovo_International_Airport" title="wikilink">Domodedovo International Airport</a> in January 2012, and returned to the U.S. in July 2012.<a href="#fn122" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref122"><sup>122</sup></a> Tamerlan and his wife received <a href="public_assistance" title="wikilink">public assistance</a> and <a href="food_stamp" title="wikilink">food stamps</a> from September 2011 to November 2012, which included all the time Tamerlan was in Russia. Zubeidat Tsarnaeva said her son had wanted his wife and their child to move to Dagestan with him, and that: &quot;She herself agreed; she said she wanted to study a different culture, language.&quot;<a href="#fn123" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref123"><sup>123</sup></a></p>
<p>During the six months he was overseas, he visited his family in the <a href="North_Caucasus" title="wikilink">North Caucasus</a>.</p>
<p>His father said that Tamerlan was with him in <a href="Makhachkala" class="uri" title="wikilink">Makhachkala</a>, the capital of Dagestan, for six months and that they had done ordinary things, such as visiting relatives. His father also said that he and Tamerlan visited Chechnya twice, to see relatives there and to receive Tamerlan's new <a href="Russian_passport" title="wikilink">Russian passport</a>.<a href="#fn124" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref124"><sup>124</sup></a><a href="#fn125" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref125"><sup>125</sup></a> While Tsarnaev arrived in Russia in January 2012, however, he only arrived in Dagestan around March, and his father arrived there in May.<a href="#fn126" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref126"><sup>126</sup></a> <a href="U.S._House_Committee_on_Homeland_Security" title="wikilink">U.S. House Homeland Security</a> Chairman <a href="Michael_McCaul" title="wikilink">Michael McCaul</a> said he believed that Tamerlan received training during his trip, and became radicalized.<a href="#fn127" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref127"><sup>127</sup></a> In an early report, Dagestan's interior minister Abdurashid Magomedov said through a spokesman that Tamerlan &quot;did not have contact with the [Islamist] underground during his visit&quot;.<a href="#fn128" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref128"><sup>128</sup></a></p>
<p>A distant cousin of the Tsarnaev brothers, Magomed Kartashov, is a leading intellectual figure in Dagestan's Islamist community. Zubeidat confirmed that they &quot;became very close.&quot; Kartashov's Islamist organization, &quot;The Union of the Just,&quot; advocates Islam as a political system under <a href="sharia" title="wikilink">sharia law</a>. He and Tamerlan discussed fighting the global fight. Kartashov said the Boston bombing is &quot;good&quot; in that it will increase converts to Islam similar to the attacks of September 11.<a href="#fn129" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref129"><sup>129</sup></a></p>
<p>According to media reports, Tamerlan was seen by Dagestan police, who were conducting surveillance, making six visits to a known Islamic militant in a <a href="Salafi" class="uri" title="wikilink">Salafi</a> mosque in Makhachkala founded by an associate of <a href="Ayman_Zawahiri" title="wikilink">Ayman Zawahiri</a>.<a href="#fn130" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref130"><sup>130</sup></a><a href="#fn131" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref131"><sup>131</sup></a><a href="#fn132" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref132"><sup>132</sup></a><a href="#fn133" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref133"><sup>133</sup></a> According to Russian investigative newspaper <em><a href="Novaya_Gazeta" title="wikilink">Novaya Gazeta</a></em>, quoting unnamed Russian security sources, Tamerlan was linked to 23-year-old <a href="William_Plotnikov" title="wikilink">William Plotnikov</a>, an <a href="Russians" title="wikilink">ethnic Russian</a>-<a href="Tatars" title="wikilink">Tatar</a> Islamic militant and Canadian citizen, with whom he communicated via online social networking sites.<a href="#fn134" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref134"><sup>134</sup></a><a href="#fn135" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref135"><sup>135</sup></a><a href="#fn136" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref136"><sup>136</sup></a> Tamerlan had also visited Toronto, where Plotnikov lived with his parents.<a href="#fn137" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref137"><sup>137</sup></a> Once in Dagestan, Tamerlan is said to have met on several occasions with Makhmud Mansur Nidal, a 19-year-old Dagestani-Palestinian man.

After Tamerlan's alleged contacts were both killed, he &quot;got frightened and fled&quot;. He left Russia in July two days after Plotnikov was killed, in an apparent hurry that Russian authorities considered suspicious, not waiting to pick up his new Russian passport &lt;U+2014&gt; ostensibly one of his main reasons for coming to Russia.<a href="#fn139" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref139"><sup>139</sup></a><a href="#fn140" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref140"><sup>140</sup></a><a href="#fn141" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref141"><sup>141</sup></a><a href="#fn142" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref142"><sup>142</sup></a></p>
<p>In an interview, Tsarnaev's father later said he had to force his son to return to the United States to complete his U.S. citizenship application, after Tamerlan tried to convince his family to allow him to stay in Dagestan for good.<a href="#fn143" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref143"><sup>143</sup></a></p>

<p>After his return to the U.S., Tamerlan created a YouTube channel with playlist links to two videos which were tagged under a category labeled &quot;Terrorists&quot;, including one to Dagestani Islamic militant Amir Abu Dujana (Gadzhimurad Dolgatov, also known as 'Robin Hood', a commander of a small group in the <a href="Kizilyurt" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kizilyurt</a> district, who was killed in battle in late December 2012); the videos were later deleted.<a href="#fn150" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref150"><sup>150</sup></a><a href="#fn151" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref151"><sup>151</sup></a><a href="#fn152" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref152"><sup>152</sup></a><a href="#fn153" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref153"><sup>153</sup></a> <a href="CNN" class="uri" title="wikilink">CNN</a> and the <a href="SITE_Institute" title="wikilink">SITE Institute</a> found a screen grab of one of the videos, which featured members of the militant Islamist group <a href="Caucasus_Emirate" title="wikilink">Caucasus Emirate</a> from the North Caucasus.<a href="#fn154" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref154"><sup>154</sup></a> He also linked to <a href="jihadi" class="uri" title="wikilink">jihadi</a> videos on YouTube, including ones by radical cleric <a href="Feiz_Mohammad" title="wikilink">Feiz Mohammad</a>; in one video, voices can be heard singing in Arabic as bombs explode.<a href="#fn155" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref155"><sup>155</sup></a><a href="#fn156" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref156"><sup>156</sup></a><a href="#fn157" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref157"><sup>157</sup></a><a href="#fn158" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref158"><sup>158</sup></a> He frequently read extremist sites, including <a href="Al-Qaeda_in_the_Arabian_Peninsula" title="wikilink">Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula</a>'s <em><a href="Inspire_(magazine)" title="wikilink">Inspire</a></em> online magazine.<a href="#fn159" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref159"><sup>159</sup></a></p>

Also in November 2012, Tamerlan stood up and challenged a sermon in which the speaker said that, just like &quot;we all celebrate the birthday of the Prophet, we can also celebrate July 4 and Thanksgiving,&quot; according to Yusufi Vali, a mosque spokesman.
