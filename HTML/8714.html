<p><strong>Robert George Dylan Willis</strong> <a href="Order_of_the_British_Empire" title="wikilink">MBE</a>, born <strong>Robert George Willis</strong> and known as <strong>Bob Willis</strong> (30 May 1949 – ) is a former <a href="England" title="wikilink">English</a> <a href="cricket" title="wikilink">cricketer</a> who played for <a href="Surrey_County_Cricket_Club" title="wikilink">Surrey</a>, <a href="Warwickshire_County_Cricket_Club" title="wikilink">Warwickshire</a>, <a href="Northerns_cricket_team" title="wikilink">Northern Transvaal</a> and <a href="English_cricket_team" title="wikilink">England</a>. A right-handed and aggressive <a href="fast_bowler" title="wikilink">fast bowler</a> with a notably long run-up, Willis spearheaded several England bowling attacks between 1971 and 1984, across 90 <a href="Test_cricket" title="wikilink">Test matches</a> in which he took 325 wickets at 25.20 <a href="bowling_average" title="wikilink">runs per wicket</a>, at the time second only to <a href="Dennis_Lillee" title="wikilink">Dennis Lillee</a>.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> He is currently behind only <a href="Ian_Botham" title="wikilink">Ian Botham</a> as England's leading wicket taker. He took 899 <a href="first-class_cricket" title="wikilink">first-class wickets</a> overall, although from 1975 onwards he bowled with constant pain, having had surgery on both knees. He nevertheless continued to find success, taking a career best eight wickets for 43 runs in the <a href="1981_Ashes_series" title="wikilink">1981 Ashes series</a> against <a href="Australia_cricket_team" title="wikilink">Australia</a>, one of the all-time best Test bowling performances, in the famous 1981 Ashes series against Australia.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> He was <em>Wisden</em> Cricketer of the Year for 1978.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>In addition to the Test arena, Willis played 64 <a href="One_Day_International" title="wikilink">One Day International</a> matches for his country, taking 80 wickets, and was a prolific <a href="List-A" class="uri" title="wikilink">List-A</a> (one day) cricketer with 421 wickets overall at 20.18. With the bat, Willis made little impression as a tail-ender with a best Test score of 28 <a href="Not_out_(cricket)" title="wikilink">not-out</a> (*); however, he managed two half-centuries at first-class level and for a time held a record number of Test not-outs.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> Willis captained the England team in 18 Tests and 28 ODI matches between June 1982 and March 1984. Under Willis' captaincy England won seven, lost five and drew six Tests, and won 16 of the ODIs. Botham recalled Willis as &quot;a tremendous trier.. a great team-man and an inspiration&quot;,<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> as well as the &quot;only world-class fast bowler in my time as an England player.&quot;<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> The editor of <a href="Wisden_Cricketers&#39;_Almanack" title="wikilink"><em>Wisden</em></a> wrote of him in similar terms: &quot;His indomitable service to England is handsomely reflected in his great collection of Test wickets. Although often beset with aches and pains, he never spared himself when bowling for his country.&quot;<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p>Retiring in 1984 following a Test series against the <a href="West_Indies_cricket_team" title="wikilink">West Indies</a>, Willis found later work as a commentator with <a href="Sky_Sports" title="wikilink">Sky Sports</a>. He formed a noted commentary partnership with Botham; however, Willis' relatively low-key style, in contrast to Botham's ebullience, meant that from 2006 onwards Willis tended to be used as a second string commentator.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a><a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> He remains an often-heard broadcaster, a published writer and an occasional critic of the modern game.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a><a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="early-life">Early life</h2>
<p>Willis was born in <a href="Sunderland,_Tyne_and_Wear" title="wikilink">Sunderland</a>, <a href="Durham" class="uri" title="wikilink">Durham</a>,<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> and grew up in the <a href="Surrey" class="uri" title="wikilink">Surrey</a> village of <a href="Stoke_d&#39;Abernon" title="wikilink">Stoke d'Abernon</a> near <a href="Cobham,_Surrey" title="wikilink">Cobham</a>, having moved there at the age of six.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> His father was an employee of the <a href="BBC" class="uri" title="wikilink">BBC</a>, and Willis had an elder brother named David with whom he played cricket in the garden, and an elder sister.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> He adopted his third name &quot;Dylan&quot; by <a href="deed_poll" title="wikilink">deed poll</a> in honour of <a href="United_States" title="wikilink">American</a> musician <a href="Bob_Dylan" title="wikilink">Bob Dylan</a>, of whom he is a fan.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> Willis was educated at the <a href="Royal_Grammar_School,_Guildford" title="wikilink">Royal Grammar School, Guildford</a>,<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> playing his early cricket for Stoke d'Abernon Cricket Club, where he later became Vice President and Life Member,<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> and two seasons for the Cobham Avorians.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> He was also an avid schoolboy footballer,<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> but was not a natural athlete and loathed <a href="Rugby_football" title="wikilink">rugby</a>, which was the school's dominant sport. Willis recalled in 2009 that during his school years &quot;in the winter when the muscled brethren were playing, I used to play football with the school old boys. This taught me how to drink cider and vomit it up on Surbiton station, and other life-altering lessons.&quot;<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> Willis' bowling potential was rewarded with selection for Surrey Schools and Surrey Colts, under the directorship of <a href="Watcyn_Evans" title="wikilink">Watcyn Evans</a>, who would become a close friend.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="playing-career">Playing career</h2>
<h3 id="county-debut">County debut</h3>
<p>In 1968, Willis accepted an invitation to join Middlesex and Surrey Young Cricketers on tour in Pakistan, and used this opportunity to further hone his skills.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> Upon his return he made early appearances for Surrey's Second XI, his first being on 26 August against <a href="Worcestershire_CCC" title="wikilink">Worcestershire</a>'s Seconds. Willis, 19 years of age, took one wicket for 48 runs in the first innings, and bowled four wicketless overs in the second. He was not called on to bat at all.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> Two days later, he faced Glamorgan and took three wickets.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> He played several further Second XI matches through May and June 1969,<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> before his first-class debut on August 6.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> <a href="Scotland_cricket_team" title="wikilink">Scotland</a> was touring England that season and had already beaten <a href="Warwickshire_CCC" title="wikilink">Warwickshire</a>. Willis took three wickets for 13 runs from 13 overs in his first innings, and two for 37 in his second, to help Surrey to victory by an innings and 97 runs.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> Willis went on to take 22 first-class wickets that season at 17.22 from six matches,<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> placing him 15th in the national averages for that season's County Championship.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> Surrey came third in the competition that year.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> Willis also played two List-A games, but took only one wicket at 52.00.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> </p>
<p>Willis had thus earned a second season at Surrey, and in 1970 played 14 Championship matches, taking 40 first-class wickets at 28.37,<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> and 31 one day wickets at 14.65.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> Surrey came fifth in the Championship that year.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> He achieved a noteworthy performance in the <a href="Friends_Provident_Trophy" title="wikilink">Gillette Cup</a> quarter-final against Middlesex. In a high-scoring match, Surrey made 280 for the loss of five wickets. Middlesex appeared to be coasting to victory when they reached 240-3, but Willis turned the game, and they collapsed and finished on 272-9. Willis took 6-49 in his 12 overs and won the Man of the Match award.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> Despite this, Surrey's preference for <a href="Geoff_Arnold" title="wikilink">Geoff Arnold</a> and <a href="Robin_Jackman" title="wikilink">Robin Jackman</a> kept Willis out of the side on occasions. He prepared to spend the winter employed at the Crystal Palace Recreation Centre while playing as a <a href="Goalkeeper_(association_football)" title="wikilink">goalkeeper</a> for local football clubs. However, <a href="Ray_Illingworth" title="wikilink">Ray Illingworth</a> and <a href="Colin_Cowdrey" title="wikilink">Colin Cowdrey</a>, captain and vice captain of England's Test side, contacted him via <a href="telephone" class="uri" title="wikilink">telephone</a> to ask him to travel to <a href="Australia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Australia</a> and join the current England tour there. Willis, who knew that Illingworth and Cowdrey had little knowledge of his bowling, later credited his call up to the influence of senior member of the touring party <a href="John_Edrich" title="wikilink">John Edrich</a>, Willis' long-term friend, mentor, and Surrey team-mate.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="international-beginnings">International beginnings</h3>
<p>Willis joined <a href="English_cricket_team_in_Australia_in_1970&lt;U+2013&gt;71" title="wikilink">England's 1970-71 tour of Australia</a> as a replacement for the injured <a href="Alan_Ward" title="wikilink">Alan Ward</a>, and played several warm-up matches for the <a href="Marylebone_Cricket_Club" title="wikilink">MCC</a> in December. <em>Wisden</em> records that his &quot;infectious enthusiasm and team spirit played no small part in Australia's downfall&quot; as England won <a href="The_Ashes" title="wikilink">The Ashes</a> in the subsequent Test series. Willis' first Test, on January 9, 1971 – the fourth Test of the series, played when the series stood level after two draws and an abandonment – saw him score 15 not out as England batted first and reached 332. In the Australian first innings he bowled an economical nine overs for 26 runs, while <a href="Derek_Underwood" title="wikilink">Derek Underwood</a> took four wickets to reduce Australia to 236. Subsequently, an unbeaten 142* from <a href="Geoffrey_Boycott" title="wikilink">Geoffrey Boycott</a> set Australia 416 to win. With <a href="John_Snow_(cricketer)" title="wikilink">John Snow</a> routing Australia with 7/40, Willis was only given three overs to bowl on a pitch &quot;without pace&quot;,<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> but he managed to take his first Test wicket – <a href="Ashley_Mallett" title="wikilink">Ashley Mallett</a>, caught by <a href="Alan_Knott" title="wikilink">Alan Knott</a> for six.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a></p>
<p>Willis remained in the team for the fifth Test at <a href="Melbourne_Cricket_Ground" title="wikilink">Melbourne Cricket Ground</a>, and rewarded the selectors with 3/73 in the first innings and 1/42 in the second as the match was drawn.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> Of the final two matches, Willis took three wickets in the drawn <a href="Adelaide_Oval" title="wikilink">Adelaide Oval</a> Test,<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> and four more in the final match of the series, a victory at <a href="Sydney_Cricket_Ground" title="wikilink">Sydney Cricket Ground</a> which gave England a 2:0 series victory.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> Willis finished his first Test series with 12 wickets at 27.41, and had also taken several &quot;crucial catches&quot;.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> He was retained for the second match of the two-Test series against <a href="New_Zealand_cricket_team" title="wikilink">New Zealand</a> in <a href="Auckland" class="uri" title="wikilink">Auckland</a> in March, where he took two wickets.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="surrey-to-warwickshire">Surrey to Warwickshire</h3>

<p>Willis returned in early 1971 to help Surrey win the 1971 County Championship title. However, friction was developing between the club and himself. During that season Willis took 31 Championship wickets at 28.83,<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> but found himself unable to accept the contract offered to him by the club. Though the county was reluctant to lose him, Willis sought another club. He took two wickets in his final match for Surrey against <a href="Hampshire_CCC" title="wikilink">Hampshire</a> on September 11, 1971.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a> After turning down <a href="Leicestershire_CCC" title="wikilink">Leicestershire</a> and <a href="Lancashire_CCC" title="wikilink">Lancashire</a> he signed for <a href="Warwickshire_CCC" title="wikilink">Warwickshire</a>, for whom he had immediate success, with 25 wickets at 29.28, including one five-wicket haul (taking five wickets in one innings).<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> Willis, who under rules then applying was banned from playing for his new county before July, helped Warwickshire win the 1972 Championship, thus achieving the unusual feat of winning the Championship in consecutive years with two different counties.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a> In his final match of the season, he took 8/44 to dismantle <a href="Derbyshire_CCC" title="wikilink">Derbyshire</a>.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a> His new team won nine of their 20 matches, drew 11 and lost none.<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a> He was not selected for the <a href="1972_Ashes_series" title="wikilink">1972 Ashes series</a> in England, and travelled to <a href="South_Africa" title="wikilink">South Africa</a> as part of <a href="Derrick_Robins" title="wikilink">Derrick Robins</a>' invitation XI in January.<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a> On the tour Willis took 13 wickets from the six matches.<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a></p>
<p>Willis spent part of the 1973 season injured with one of what would become several recurring complaints.<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a> He nevertheless managed 43 wickets in the Championship at 18.95,<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a> though his injury barred him from all but one Test against the <a href="West_Indies_cricket_team" title="wikilink">West Indies cricket team</a>. The West Indies amassed 652/8 declared. Willis took four wickets for 118 runs – career-best Test figures thus far – and was the last batsman standing as <a href="Vanburn_Holder" title="wikilink">Vanburn Holder</a> and <a href="Keith_Boyce" title="wikilink">Keith Boyce</a> routed England for 233 and 193.<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a> He then make his ODI debut with two games against the touring side in September, taking 2/29 and scoring five not out as England took a one-wicket victory in the West Indies' first ever ODI match.<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a> Willis went wicketless and at conceded 5.5 runs an over in the second, which the West Indies won by eight wickets.<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="west-indies-sub-continent-and-australia">West Indies, sub-continent and Australia</h3>
<p>Willis then travelled to the <a href="Caribbean" class="uri" title="wikilink">Caribbean</a> as part of England's winter tour, in what <em>Wisden</em> described as an &quot;automatic selection&quot; however he was to struggle against the top Test side.<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a> In the first Test, on February 2, 1974, he took only one wicket,<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a> followed by three in the second,<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a> and one for a hundred runs in the final match.<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a> He was to struggle against the West Indies throughout his career. His bowling average against them ended at 36.34, whereas against no other team was it above 26.14.<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a></p>
<p>Willis then returned to England, to face <a href="India_cricket_team" title="wikilink">India</a> and <a href="Pakistan_cricket_team" title="wikilink">Pakistan</a>, playing in one Test against each. Against India he took 4/64 – a career best against that team – and made a Test best 24 with the bat.<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a> Pakistan toured in early August, and Willis featured in one Test. He took one wicket for 133 runs. He also played one ODI where he took one wicket caught and bowled as Pakistan achieved a seven wicket victory.<a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a><a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a> At this point, Willis was suffering from a recurring back injury. He played 13 Championship games for Warwickshire during the 1974 season, taking 44 wickets at 21.56 including one five-wicket haul.<a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a> In November, Willis touring Australia during the <a href="1974/75_Ashes_series" title="wikilink">1974/75 Ashes series</a>, playing in five Test matches. He took 17 Test wickets at 30.70, including a best of 5/42,<a href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a> out of 26 first-class wickets at 31.19 overall.<a href="#fn67" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a> He was, however, playing with growing injury concerns which required several painkilling injections.<a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="injury-and-operation">Injury and operation</h3>
<p>Willis returned to England in January 1975 with a recurring knee injury which had caused him to collapse at a county game early that season, and underwent several operations to correct it. He had surgery on both knees, and suffered a post-operative <a href="blood_clot" title="wikilink">blood clot</a>. He was forced to use crutches for most of the season, and reflected in 1978 that it was &quot;similar to a 50,000-mile service.&quot;<a href="#fn69" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref69"><sup>69</sup></a> His recovery was particularly tortuous, requiring daily runs around the cricket field and an intensive gym program under the supervision of Dr. Arthur Jackson, an advocate of slow running therapy to build stamina.<a href="#fn70" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a> He played no part in the international arena in 1975, and managed only four first-class appearances, though these returned a healthy 18 wickets at 18.77.<a href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a> He was not to return to the Test game until 1976, where he faced the West Indies in two matches in July and August.</p>
<p>That year, he had made a comfortable return to the county game from injury – taking 16 Championship wickets at 26.12.<a href="#fn72" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref72"><sup>72</sup></a> He had also scored a career best 43 with the bat.<a href="#fn73" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref73"><sup>73</sup></a> After coming fit from injury, Willis was brought into the squad for the fourth Test against the West Indies on July 22 as part of wholesale bowling changes that saw <a href="Brian_Close" title="wikilink">Brian Close</a>, Edrich, <a href="Mike_Hendrick" title="wikilink">Mike Hendrick</a>, <a href="Mike_Selvey" title="wikilink">Mike Selvey</a> and <a href="Pat_Pocock" title="wikilink">Pat Pocock</a> replaced with <a href="John_Snow_(cricketer)" title="wikilink">John Snow</a>, Ward, <a href="Bob_Woolmer" title="wikilink">Bob Woolmer</a>, <a href="David_Steele_(cricketer)" title="wikilink">David Steele</a> and Willis. He took three wickets for 71 runs and then a five-wicket haul in the second innings. This both gave him career best figures and took him past 50 Test wickets.<a href="#fn74" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref74"><sup>74</sup></a> His last four wickets fell in 24 balls at the cost of three runs, described by <em>Wisden</em> as a &quot;fine piece of fast bowling&quot;.<a href="#fn75" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref75"><sup>75</sup></a> <a href="Tony_Greig" title="wikilink">Tony Greig</a>'s England, however, struggled to make any impression on the West Indies through the series, <a href="Viv_Richards" title="wikilink">Viv Richards</a> dominating with 829 runs across the series.<a href="#fn76" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref76"><sup>76</sup></a> Willis could only take one further wicket in the fifth and final Test, which the tourists won easily.<a href="#fn77" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref77"><sup>77</sup></a> By this time Willis, whose injury troubles were continuing, turned down a coaching opportunity in South Africa in order to not risk his fitness, and went on the <a href="Jobseeker&#39;s_Allowance" title="wikilink">dole</a>.<a href="#fn78" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref78"><sup>78</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="revival-in-india-and-the-1977-ashes">Revival in India and the 1977 Ashes</h3>
<p>Over the winter of 1976/77, England toured India in a five Test series through December to February, and it proved to be a revival for Willis. <em>Wisden</em> recorded the India tour to be the time when he &quot;put to flight any who doubted his right to be acclaimed as one of the world's foremost fast bowlers.&quot;<a href="#fn79" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref79"><sup>79</sup></a> Willis took 32 wickets for 15.09 across the entire tour,<a href="#fn80" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref80"><sup>80</sup></a> 20 of those in the Test matches for 16.75.<a href="#fn81" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref81"><sup>81</sup></a> He took five for 27 in the second Test,<a href="#fn82" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref82"><sup>82</sup></a> and then six for 53 in the fourth – earning him career best Test figures thus far, and taking him past 400 first-class wickets.<a href="#fn83" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref83"><sup>83</sup></a> Four of his wickets came in four overs with the second new ball, &quot;although he received no help from the pitch&quot;.<a href="#fn84" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref84"><sup>84</sup></a> <em>Wisden</em> record that &quot;His 20 wickets in the series stamped Willis as a bowler of genuine pace and in-disputable class.&quot;<a href="#fn85" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref85"><sup>85</sup></a></p>
<p>The <a href="1977_Ashes" title="wikilink">1977 Ashes</a> took place across five Tests between June and August that year, in all of which Willis featured.

Willis, however, combined with Dilley, Hendrick and Botham to reduce Australia to 179 all out, with three wickets for Willis. England could not take advantage, however, as Lillee and Alderman shared the host nation's ten wickets equally between them to leave Australia only 132 to win. Dilley took four wickets and Willis snatched <a href="Graeme_Wood" title="wikilink">Graeme Wood</a> for eight to reach 200 Test wickets,<a href="#fn155" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref155"><sup>155</sup></a> however the tourists won the match with four wickets to space.<a href="#fn156" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref156"><sup>156</sup></a><a href="#fn157" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref157"><sup>157</sup></a> </p>

Australia surpassed this and were dismissed for 345, with three wickets for Willis and three for Dilley. The England bowlers suffered from no balls, Willis alone bowling 28.<a href="#fn159" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref159"><sup>159</sup></a> England declared late in the game on 265/8, and Willis picked up another wicket as Australia reached 90/4 at the close of play.<a href="#fn160" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref160"><sup>160</sup></a> Botham, who had captained the side until then, was sacked and replaced by Brearley.

He took 12 wickets at 31.75 against India,<a href="#fn177" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref177"><sup>177</sup></a> and three more Test and two wickets ODI against Sri Lanka.<a href="#fn178" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref178"><sup>178</sup></a><a href="#fn179" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref179"><sup>179</sup></a> Between these international fixtures, Willis had secured 13 County Championship wickets at 28.55,<a href="#fn180" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref180"><sup>180</sup></a> though Warwickshire came bottom of the table.<a href="#fn181" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref181"><sup>181</sup></a></p>

<p>s assessment of Willis' demeanour as a captain.</p>

<p>}}</p>
<p>Willis began the 1982 county season with five County Championship fixtures, featuring his first half-century with the bat, a career-best 72, while leading Warwickshire against the touring Indian side on May 9. He also took two wickets.<a href="#fn182" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref182"><sup>182</sup></a> He also reached his 750th first-class wickets with his 2/71 against Yorkshire on May 19.<a href="#fn183" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref183"><sup>183</sup></a> India were scheduled to play three Tests and two ODI matches that tour, however before the matches began, the England selectors dropped Fletcher, the captain. Willis, though seen as an unlikely candidate and ambivalent towards the role, was awarded the captaincy.<a href="#fn184" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref184"><sup>184</sup></a> On June 2, the new captain faced India as part of the England ODI squad, taking two wickets and effecting a run-out with the help of Botham, who also took four wickets. England restricted India to 193 and achieved victory by nine wickets. The second ODI match followed two days later, and England also won – this time by 114 runs with Willis taking 1/10 from seven overs.<a href="#fn185" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref185"><sup>185</sup></a></p>
<p>With two victories under his belt, Willis led his team to the first Test on June 10. Batting first, he hit a career-best 28 runs in a last-wicket partnership with Allott (41) worth 70 – an England record against India – which took the hosts to 433 all out.<a href="#fn186" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref186"><sup>186</sup></a> Willis then set about taking apart the Indian batting line-up with 3/41 and 6/101 to leave England 65 runs to chase, which they reached for the loss of three wickets.<a href="#fn187" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref187"><sup>187</sup></a> <em>Wisden</em> described Willis as &quot;bowling near his fastest&quot;<a href="#fn188" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref188"><sup>188</sup></a> and he took his 250th Test wicket during the match.<a href="#fn189" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref189"><sup>189</sup></a> Willis took two further wickets in the second Test, however centuries from Botham and <a href="Sandeep_Patil" title="wikilink">Sandeep Patil</a> ensured large innings scores that pushed the match to a draw.<a href="#fn190" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref190"><sup>190</sup></a> Botham followed with his career-best 208 in the third match to take England to 594 all out, and Willis then took 3/78 to keep India to 410. He then declared England's second innings at 191 to leave India 376 to win, and collected the wicket of <a href="Ravi_Shastri" title="wikilink">Ravi Shastri</a> before India closed out the final day with 111/3.<a href="#fn191" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref191"><sup>191</sup></a> Willis thus completed his first Test series in victorious fashion, with 15 Test wickets of his own at 22.00.<a href="#fn192" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref192"><sup>192</sup></a> Willis was available for only three more first-class games that season, and finished it with a total of 24 wickets at 35.08.<a href="#fn193" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref193"><sup>193</sup></a> He promptly travelled to Australia to lead England in the <a href="1982-83_Ashes" title="wikilink">1982-83 Ashes</a>.<a href="#fn194" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref194"><sup>194</sup></a></p>
<p>Over the winter of 1982/83, England's winning Ashes team travelled to Australia under Willis' captaincy. Willis took two three-wicket hauls in two warm-up first-class matches, however he was absent from two others and Botham took over the captaincy.<a href="#fn195" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref195"><sup>195</sup></a> By now, continuing injury problems were beginning to plague the ageing bowler's body.<a href="#fn196" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref196"><sup>196</sup></a> He took 3/95 in the first Test as Australia reached 424 in reply to England's first innings 411, of which Willis had made 26. <a href="Derek_Randall" title="wikilink">Derek Randall</a>'s century in England's second innings took them to 358, however Australia completed their unchallenging fourth innings target for the loss of two wickets, both of which were taken by Willis.<a href="#fn197" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref197"><sup>197</sup></a> Willis picked up 5/66 in the second Test, however Australia easily reached another low fourth innings target to take the series to 2:0.<a href="#fn198" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref198"><sup>198</sup></a> The third Test followed a similar pattern, with England replying with two low scores in the face of Australia's first innings 438, and Australia taking an eight-wicket win to win back the Ashes, despite Willis' three wickets.<a href="#fn199" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref199"><sup>199</sup></a> England achieved what was then the narrowest Ashes victory margin of three runs in the fourth Test, with Willis taking three wickets.<a href="#fn200" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref200"><sup>200</sup></a> Wills commentated on the game that &quot;You never give up and you never think it has gone.&quot;<a href="#fn201" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref201"><sup>201</sup></a> The fifth match ended in a draw.<a href="#fn202" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref202"><sup>202</sup></a> Across the entire tour, Willis took 28 first-class wickets.<a href="#fn203" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref203"><sup>203</sup></a> In the following World Series Cup between England, Australia and New Zealand, England were knocked out despite 14 wickets for Willis at 21.14.<a href="#fn204" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref204"><sup>204</sup></a></p>
<p>Willis returned to Warwickshire for the 1983 season, struggling in the county season with 21 wickets at 36.76 in the County Championship,<a href="#fn205" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref205"><sup>205</sup></a> though finding more success in the one day arena with a career-best 45 wickets at 16.24.<a href="#fn206" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref206"><sup>206</sup></a> He also led England in a four Test series against New Zealand, finding greater success with 20 wickets at 13.65 including a five-wicket haul.<a href="#fn207" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref207"><sup>207</sup></a> This, coming in the second Test, took Willis past 850 first-class wickets and 300 Test wickets.<a href="#fn208" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref208"><sup>208</sup></a> England won the series convincingly 3:1,<a href="#fn209" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref209"><sup>209</sup></a> and returned to New Zealand over the winter. In the drawn first Test, Willis overtook <a href="Fred_Trueman" title="wikilink">Fred Trueman</a>'s record England tally of 307 Test wickets when he dismissed <a href="Lance_Cairns" title="wikilink">Lance Cairns</a> in the first innings.<a href="#fn210" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref210"><sup>210</sup></a> England lost the second Test by an innings despite 4/51 from Willis.<a href="#fn211" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref211"><sup>211</sup></a> With the third Test ending as a draw, England lost the series.<a href="#fn212" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref212"><sup>212</sup></a> Willis, with increasing physical and mental weariness and now using hypnotherapy to reduce stress and focus his game,<a href="#fn213" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref213"><sup>213</sup></a> took three wickets in the following ODI series, in which England whitewashed New Zealand 3:0.<a href="#fn214" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref214"><sup>214</sup></a></p>
<p>England played a three Test series against Pakistan in early 1984, however Willis was unable to contribute more than two wickets in the first match due to injury.<a href="#fn215" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref215"><sup>215</sup></a><a href="#fn216" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref216"><sup>216</sup></a> He made only five County Championship appearances, taking only nine wickets at 42.22.<a href="#fn217" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref217"><sup>217</sup></a> Willis, with pressure mounting due to injury and poor performances by the England team, was sacked as captain before the upcoming Test series against the West Indies, and replaced by Gower.</p>
<p>As a captain, Willis has subsequently received mixed assessment.<a href="#fn218" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref218"><sup>218</sup></a> Botham retained fond memories of Willis the player,<a href="#fn219" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref219"><sup>219</sup></a> however remarked Willis found it difficult to captain him because the men were of similar age.<a href="#fn220" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref220"><sup>220</sup></a> Willis, often noted for his enthusiasm,<a href="#fn221" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref221"><sup>221</sup></a> became an &quot;effective motivator&quot; as a captain however he was &quot;no outstanding tactical genius&quot; and &quot;towards the end his feelings bordered on disgust at the conviction that some of England's cricketers accepted failure too readily. Nor was he able to close himself off against media comment.&quot;<a href="#fn222" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref222"><sup>222</sup></a> He was also characterised as a loner in the game, and a reluctant captain grateful to be placed back within the ranks after repeated defeats while he was at the reigns.<a href="#fn223" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref223"><sup>223</sup></a> His 18 Tests as England captain saw 7 victories, 5 defeats, and 6 draws,<a href="#fn224" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref224"><sup>224</sup></a> while he led England in 29 ODI matches, winning 16 and losing 13.<a href="#fn225" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref225"><sup>225</sup></a></p>
<p>Willis played in the next Test series against the West Indies, taking two wickets in the first two matches.<a href="#fn226" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref226"><sup>226</sup></a><a href="#fn227" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref227"><sup>227</sup></a> and before the last match played against Derbyshire for his county, taking three wickets.<a href="#fn228" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref228"><sup>228</sup></a> Willis took to the field on July 12 for the third Test and took only two wickets for 123 runs as the West Indies, particularly <a href="Michael_Holding" title="wikilink">Michael Holding</a>, &quot;hammered&quot; his bowling – Holding hit 59 from 55 deliveries. Willis conceded 40 more runs from eight overs in the second innings, which <em>Wisden</em> referred to as &quot;the death throes&quot; of his career.<a href="#fn229" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref229"><sup>229</sup></a><a href="#fn230" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref230"><sup>230</sup></a> He announced his retirement from all cricket immediately after England's defeat.<a href="#fn231" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref231"><sup>231</sup></a></p>

<h2 id="commentary">Commentary</h2>
<p>After retiring from playing cricket, Willis established himself as a television commentator on <a href="British_Sky_Broadcasting" title="wikilink">Sky</a>. He began a television career in 1985, and was initially in partnership with Botham in the commentary box, &quot;his laconic style did not suit all&quot; and he was dropped from the &quot;front-line commentary duties&quot;.<a href="#fn235" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref235"><sup>235</sup></a> Willis appeared on <em>BBC TV Cricket</em> between 1989 and 1999 as a summariser before joining <a href="Sky_Sports" title="wikilink">Sky Sports</a> in 2000. He also appeared on <a href="David_Tomlinson" title="wikilink">David Tomlinson</a>'s <em><a href="This_is_Your_Life" title="wikilink">This is Your Life</a></em> in 1991, <em><a href="A_Question_of_Sport" title="wikilink">A Question of Sport</a></em> in 2004 and <em><a href="20_to_1" title="wikilink">20 to 1</a></em> in 2005.<a href="#fn236" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref236"><sup>236</sup></a></p>
<p>Willis has continued to work for Sky Sports, largely commentating in the county game, where he has been vocal on the need for changes in English cricket, particularly through a group of former players known as the Cricket Reform Group.<a href="#fn237" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref237"><sup>237</sup></a> He was critical of <a href="Michael_Atherton" title="wikilink">Michael Atherton</a> during the England tour of Zimbabwe in 1997.<a href="#fn238" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref238"><sup>238</sup></a> In 2006 he criticised the then England coach <a href="Duncan_Fletcher" title="wikilink">Duncan Fletcher</a>'s practices,<a href="#fn239" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref239"><sup>239</sup></a> England's performance in the <a href="2006-07_Ashes" title="wikilink">2006-07 Ashes</a>,<a href="#fn240" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref240"><sup>240</sup></a> and was vocal in calling for the retirement of out-of-form national captain <a href="Michael_Vaughan" title="wikilink">Michael Vaughan</a> in 2008.<a href="#fn241" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref241"><sup>241</sup></a></p>
<p>Willis has attracted detractors due to his somewhat melancholy style. <em><a href="The_Independent" title="wikilink">The Independent</a></em> commentated on the 1995 <a href="Texaco_Trophy" title="wikilink">Texaco Trophy</a> that Willis had &quot;trenchant content, dismal delivery.
