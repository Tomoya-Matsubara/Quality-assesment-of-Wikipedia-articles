<p><em>Fist of the North Star</em> was one of the <em>Weekly Shonen Jump's</em> most popular titles during the <a href="1980&#39;s" class="uri" title="wikilink">1980's</a>. As of 2007, it is the seventh best-selling <em>Shonen Jump</em> manga of all time in Japan.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> In a poll conducted by <a href="TV_Asahi" title="wikilink">TV Asahi</a> in 2005, the <em>Fist of the North Star</em> anime series ranked 25 in a list of Top 100 Anime series.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> In a second poll in 2006, it ranked No. 89.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> In a celebrity version of the poll, it ranked No. 15.</p>
<p>The title <em>Fist of the North Star</em> is somewhat of a <a href="mistranslation" class="uri" title="wikilink">mistranslation</a> of the Japanese original, as <em>Hokuto</em> refers not to the <a href="Polaris" title="wikilink">North Star</a> <a href="Polaris" class="uri" title="wikilink">Polaris</a>, but to the <a href="Big_Dipper" title="wikilink">Big Dipper</a> <a href="asterism_(astronomy)" title="wikilink">asterism</a>, which is known in Japan as <em>Hokuto Shichisei</em> (&lt;U+5317&gt;&lt;U+6597&gt;&lt;U+4E03&gt;&lt;U+661F&gt;, literally &quot;Seven Stars of the Northern Dipper&quot;). In Japan, the actual North Star is known as <em>Hokkyokusei</em> (&lt;U+5317&gt;&lt;U+6975&gt;&lt;U+661F&gt;, &quot;North Pole Star&quot;) or <em>Tenteisei</em> (&lt;U+5929&gt;&lt;U+5E1D&gt;&lt;U+661F&gt;, &quot;Imperial Star&quot;). In official English localization of the series, the term <em>Hokuto</em> is usually translated as &quot;North Star&quot; in an effort to maintain consistency with the title.</p>

<p>The original <a href="One-shot_(comics)" title="wikilink">one shot</a> prototype of <em>Hokuto no Ken</em>, published in the April <a href="1983" class="uri" title="wikilink">1983</a> edition of <em>Fresh Jump</em>, was set in present-day Japan and told the story of a teenager by the name of , the successor of the &quot;<em><a href="Hokuto_Shinken" title="wikilink">Hokuto Shinken</a></em>&quot; <a href="martial_arts" title="wikilink">martial arts</a> style, a deadly style which kills or cripples opponents internally by striking <a href="pressure_point" title="wikilink">pressure points</a>. Kenshiro's main adversaries in this incarnation of the story were a rival martial arts school known as the , a secret organization of assassins with influence over the <a href="Japanese_government" title="wikilink">Japanese government</a>. Kenshiro's girlfriend, Yuki, becomes a witness in one of the organization's <a href="assassination" title="wikilink">hits</a> and is subsequently killed by the culprit, with Kenshiro being framed for the crime. This event serves as a catalyst for Kenshiro's war against the Taizanji organization. A second one-shot, titled <em>Hokuto no Ken II</em>, was published in the June 1983 issue of <em>Fresh Jump</em>. Both pilots were collected in the second collected volume of <em>Tetsu no Don Quixote</em> (Tetsuo Hara's prior manga series before <em>Hokuto no Ken</em>).</p>
<p>Tetsuo Hara has stated that he came up with the idea of <em>Hokuto no Ken</em> from his editor <a href="Nobuhiko_Horie" title="wikilink">Nobuhiko Horie</a>. According to Hara, Horie suggested to him that he should draw a manga about &quot;a martial artist who destroys his opponents by striking their acupressure points&quot; based on Hara's wishes to draw a martial arts manga and his knowledge of pressure points.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>

The storyline was completely revamped, with the present-day setting being discarded in favor of a <em><a href="Mad_Max" title="wikilink">Mad Max</a></em>-inspired post apocalyptic future. The Taizanji Kenpo school were no longer the main antagonists and Kenshiro, originally a teenager, was now an adult with seven scars on his chest whose design was partly inspired by <a href="Bruce_Lee" title="wikilink">Bruce Lee</a>.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p>Originally, Tetsuo Hara was contracted to do <em>Fist of the North Star</em> for a three-year run, but due to its popularity and the publisher's demand, it was extended to a five-year run.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>

<p>After the manga ended its run, Tetsuo Hara and Buronson wrote a novel based on the manga titled , published by Jump Books in Japan in <a href="1996" class="uri" title="wikilink">1996</a>. It was adapted into a three-part <a href="OVA" class="uri" title="wikilink">OVA</a> series titled  in <a href="2003" class="uri" title="wikilink">2003</a>. The story is set sometime after the conclusion of the manga.</p>

Set during the <a href="Second_Sino-Japanese_War" title="wikilink">Second Sino-Japanese War</a> in <a href="1935" class="uri" title="wikilink">1935</a>, the story stars <a href="Hokuto_Shinken" title="wikilink">Hokuto Shinken</a> predecessor and Kenshiro's namesake, Kenshiro Kasumi.</p>
<p>Following the theatrical release of the movie <em>Ra&lt;U+014D&gt; Den Jun'ai no Sho</em> in 2006, numerous <em>Fist of the North Star</em> spinoffs began to be published in the <em>Weekly Comic Bunch</em> and <em>Big Comics Superior</em>.

<h2 id="plot-overview">Plot overview</h2>
<p>The prologue of <em>Fist of the North Star</em> informs us that the world was engaged in a global nuclear war in the year <a href="19XX" title="wikilink">199X</a>. After the war, the earth's surface became devoid of vegetation, the seas evaporated and civilization was thrown into chaos, turning everyday life into a battle for supplies of uncontaminated food and water, where the strong survive by preying on the weak. However, one man vows to make a difference. <a href="Kenshiro" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kenshiro</a> is the successor of the art of <a href="Hokuto_Shinken" title="wikilink">Hokuto Shinken</a>, a deadly 1,800 year-old <a href="ansatsuken" title="wikilink">assassination style</a> that is only passed down from one master to a chosen son. Kenshiro uses his skills and knowledge to protect the innocent from the bloodthirsty gangs that threaten their survival. Throughout the course of the series, Kenshiro meets several allies and rivals, most of whom are also trained in various martial arts styles.</p>
<p>The series begins with Kenshiro's quest to reclaim his <a href="fiancee" class="uri" title="wikilink">fiancee</a> Yuria, who was taken from him by his former friend Shin, a master of the rival  style.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> The story later evolves into a successorship struggle between Ken and his three older brothers, who were also trained in the Hokuto Shinken style. Raoh, the eldest of the brothers, has taken on the mantle of , a conqueror who uses his power to restore order through force and tyranny. A major <a href="sub-plot" class="uri" title="wikilink">sub-plot</a> is also introduced in the form of an internal conflict within the Nanto school between its six grand masters, the .</p>
<p>After Raoh's death, the story skips several years. Peace and order has slowly returned to the world, but the return of a civilized world has also brought forth with it the division of social classes. The evil Jak&lt;U+014D&gt; has taken over the Celestial Empire after the disappearance of the true Empress, turning it into a corrupt force that seeks to extend its regime through oppression, with the  masters forced to do his evil bidding. Kenshiro aids his former sidekicks Bat and Lin, now the leaders of the rebel Hokuto Army, in overthrowing Jak&lt;U+014D&gt;. But after Jak&lt;U+014D&gt; is defeated, Lin is kidnapped and taken overseas to the , the birthplace of the Hokuto Shinken style. The Land of Asura has become a war-torn nation now ruled by the three , masters of the forbidden  style, a branch of the original  along with Hokuto Shinken. After Kenshiro defeats Kaioh, the leader of the Rash&lt;U+014D&gt;, he returns to his country to train Raoh's orphaned son, Ry&lt;U+016B&gt;, as the next Hokuto Shinken successor.</p>
<h3 id="characters">Characters</h3>

<p><em>Fist of the North Star</em> has a large ensemble of characters that has changed constantly during the series' original five-year run. Among the inhabitants of the post-apocalyptic world of <em>Fist of the North Star</em> includes martial artists, royal families, rebels, bandits and villagers that are merely attempting to survive a cruel, harsh world.</p>
<p>Although protagonist <a href="Kenshiro" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kenshiro</a> is the only truly permanent character from the series' inception up until the final chapter, his two <a href="sidekick" title="wikilink">sidekicks</a>, <a href="Bat_(Fist_of_the_North_Star)" title="wikilink">Bat</a> and <a href="Lin_(Fist_of_the_North_Star)" title="wikilink">Lin</a> have serve as series' mainstays as well, introduced as a pair of orphaned children whom Kenshiro meets during the first chapter of the series and then growing up into rebel leaders and heroes in their own right.</p>
<p>Kenshiro encounters several rivals and allies throughout the course of the series, many of whom are affiliated with the martial arts schools featured in the series (see fighting styles section). The series initially focuses on two rival factions, the <a href="Hokuto_Shinken" title="wikilink">Hokuto Shinken</a> school and the <a href="Nanto_Seiken" title="wikilink">Nanto Seiken</a> school. <a href="Characters_in_Fist_of_the_North_Star#Shin" title="wikilink">Shin</a>, a representative of Nanto Seiken, serves as Kenshiro's first major nemesis, being the man responsible for engraving the seven stab wounds on Kenshiro's chest and kidnapping his fiancee <a href="Characters_in_Fist_of_the_North_Star#Yuria" title="wikilink">Yuria</a>. After Shin's death, the authors would expand the storyline by introducing other Hokuto and Nanto disciples, namely the Nanto Roku Seiken and the four Hokuto brothers. A major recurring antagonist is introduced in the form of <a href="Raoh" class="uri" title="wikilink">Raoh</a>, the eldest of the four Hokuto brothers, who would become the series' most prominent villain.</p>
<p>After Raoh's death, the <a href="Characters_in_Fist_of_the_North_Star#Gento_Koken" title="wikilink">Gento K&lt;U+014D&gt;ken</a> fighters and their leader Falco would serve as reluctant adversaries of Kenshiro. Another group of antagonists are introduced with the fighters from the Land of Asura. Their ruler of Asura, <a href="Characters_in_Fist_of_the_North_Star#Hokuto_Ryuken" title="wikilink">Kaioh</a> of the Hokuto Ryuken school, is the last major nemesis Kenshiro confronts in the series, although other villains appear after him in the manga.</p>
<p>Many of the characters in the series have since become stars of their own spinoff manga (see later works section).</p>
<h3 id="fighting-styles">Fighting styles</h3>

<p>The primary fighting style depicted in <em>Fist of the North Star</em> is <em><a href="Hokuto_Shinken" title="wikilink">Hokuto Shinken</a></em>, the style used by Kenshiro and his three adopted brothers. <em>Hokuto Shinken</em> relies primarily on 708 secret <a href="accupressure" class="uri" title="wikilink">accupressure</a> points on the human's body that forms part of a fictional system known as the . By pushing into one of the <em>hik&lt;U+014D&gt;</em> points, one can cause destruction into the enemy's body from within or even control their body against their own will. There are also beneficial <em>hik&lt;U+014D&gt;</em> points that can be used to cure sickness or heal wounds, including restore a mute person's voice or a blind person's sight. In addition, the masters of <em>Hokuto Shinken</em> can tap into their body's full potential strength, whereas an average person only uses 30% of their strength.</p>
<p>The main rival style of <em>Hokuto Shinken</em> in the beginning of the series is <em><a href="Nanto_Seiken" title="wikilink">Nanto Seiken</a></em>, a style which is described as the <a href="yin_and_yang" title="wikilink">polar opposite</a> of <em>Hokuto Shinken</em>. In contrast to the <em>Hokuto</em> style, which uses the <em>hik&lt;U+014D&gt;</em> points to cause destruction from within, the <em>Nanto</em> style specializes in stabbing and slicing techniques that penetrate the body from the outside and destroy everything in its path. Originally the style is used by Shin, the first major antagonist, but throughout the course of the series the existence of other branches of the <em>Nanto Seiken</em> are revealed, the six top branches being the <em>Nanto Roku Seiken</em>.</p>
<p>Two other major styles are introduced during the latter half of the series; <em>Gento K&lt;U+014D&gt;ken</em>, a style which specializes in <a href="qi" title="wikilink">ki</a>-based projectile attacks that destroy the enemy on a cellular level; and <em>Hokuto Ry&lt;U+016B&gt;ken</em>, a brother style of <em>Hokuto Shinken</em> which causes destruction through an opponent's  and teaches its users to summon their .</p>

Viz resumed publication of the series from <a href="1995" class="uri" title="wikilink">1995</a> to <a href="1997" class="uri" title="wikilink">1997</a>, publishing the subsequent 28 chapters of the series in 18 monthly pamphlet-sized issues (each issue containing roughly one chapter and a half) divided into three &quot;parts&quot;. Four graphic novel collections were published by Viz: <em>Fist of the North Star</em>, <em>Night of the Jackal</em>, <em>Southern Cross</em> and <em>Blood Brothers</em>. The Viz edition featured mirrored artwork, as was the standard with English translated manga at the time.</p>

Entertainment</a> began publishing a <em>Master Edition</em> of the series, large squarebound graphic novel installments (eight/nine chapters per volume) that were printed in high quality paper. In addition to sporting a revised translation and retaining the original right-to-left orientation, the <em>Master Edition</em> of the series also featured new <a href="Computer-generated_imagery" title="wikilink">CG</a> coloring added to the original artwork.

<p><img src="Hokuto_anime.jpg" title="fig:TV&#39;s Hokuto no Ken title card." alt="TV&#39;s Hokuto no Ken title card." /> <img src="Hokuto2_anime.jpg" title="fig:Hokuto no Ken 2 title card." alt="Hokuto no Ken 2 title card." /> <em>Hokuto no Ken</em> was first adaptated into a weekly anime series by <a href="Toei_Animation" title="wikilink">Toei Animation</a>. The series aired on <a href="Fuji_Television" title="wikilink">Fuji Television</a> from <a href="October_4" title="wikilink">October 4</a>, <a href="1984" class="uri" title="wikilink">1984</a> to <a href="March_5" title="wikilink">March 5</a>, <a href="1987" class="uri" title="wikilink">1987</a> and was given the subtitle of  following episode 22.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> It was immediately followed by a sequel series, titled <em>Hokuto no Ken 2</em>, which aired from <a href="March_13" title="wikilink">March 13</a>, <a href="1987" class="uri" title="wikilink">1987</a> to <a href="February_18" title="wikilink">February 18</a>, <a href="1988" class="uri" title="wikilink">1988</a>. A combined total of 152 episodes were produced for the two series. Reruns are aired in Japan on the <a href="satellite_television" title="wikilink">satellite television</a> network <a href="Animax" class="uri" title="wikilink">Animax</a>.</p>
<p>The violent content of the TV series is toned down considerably compared to the original manga, with much of the gore being discolored via desaturation, and scenes where children die were often rewritten so that Kenshiro would save the child at the last minute. Like many manga-based anime series, <a href="Filler_(media)" title="wikilink">filler</a> material was added to prevent the series from getting ahead of its source material.</p>
<p>The <em>Hokuto no Ken</em> portion of the series spans four major story arcs that follows the manga's plotline from the beginning and up until chapter 136 (prior to the timeskip). Each story arc (or chapters, as they referred within the show) spans a certain number of episodes each adapting a portion of the original manga. The first chapter is based on chapters 1-25 of the original manga, but changes the order of events so that Ken's battle with Shin is left for last, turning all the other villains into his subordinates. The rest of the series follows the manga's plotline more closely. The <em>Hokuto no Ken 2</em> portion takes place after the timeskip and adapts the storyline of the Celestial Emperor and Asura arcs of the manga. The post-Asura chapters were not adapted for the series.</p>
<p>The entire series has been collected on DVD in Japan, in a boxed collection known as the <em>Super Premium Box</em><a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> and in 26 individually released discs containing 5-6 episodes per volume.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> A three volume DVD series, the <em>Ky&lt;U+016B&gt;kyoku Retsuden</em> series, contains highlight episodes of the show.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a></p>
<p>The first 36 episodes were licensed to <a href="Manga_Entertainment" title="wikilink">Manga Entertainment</a> and released in English dubbed and subtitled formats on <a href="VHS" class="uri" title="wikilink">VHS</a> and <a href="DVD" class="uri" title="wikilink">DVD</a>. Manga Entertainment initially the released the series in eight VHS volumes spanning only 24 episodes in 1999 and later released all 36 episodes in five DVD volumes in 2003.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a>. The English dub of the show features a new soundtrack provided by <a href="Reinforced_Records" title="wikilink">Reinforced Records</a> and voice acting by <a href="Animaze" class="uri" title="wikilink">Animaze</a>. The original opening and ending sequences were replaced by in-house versions produced by Manga Entertainment with music by Mike Egan. The dubbed version aired on <a href="Showtime_Beyond" title="wikilink">Showtime Beyond</a> in the US and on the <a href="Sci_Fi_Channel_(United_Kingdom)" title="wikilink">Sci-Fi Channel</a> in the UK.</p>
<p>Manga Entertainment's treatment of the series has been criticized by reviewers, particularly at their decision to replace the original Japanese soundtrack with their own music for the English dub. A reviewer of DVD Vision Japan stated that the English voice acting was &quot;terrible, even for an early dub&quot; and compared <a href="David_Lucas" title="wikilink">David Lucas</a>' performance as Shin unfavorably to his role as <a href="Spike_Spiegel" title="wikilink">Spike Spiegel</a> in <em><a href="Cowboy_Bebop" title="wikilink">Cowboy Bebop</a></em>. The same reviewer also states that the music by Mike Egan is mediocre.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> Mike Toole of Anime Jump proclaimed that the drum n' bass soundtrack is &quot;ocasionally nice, but usually just obtrusive&quot;.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> Chadwick Ngan of EX Anime wrote that the &quot;American voice actors' efforts are commendable&quot; and that the new opening and ending themes &quot;aren't bad, but nothing to get excited about either.&quot;<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="animated-movie">1986 animated movie</h3>
<p><img src="FotNS02.jpg" title="fig:A promotional illustration of the Fist of the North Star animated movie." alt="A promotional illustration of the Fist of the North Star animated movie." width="220" /> An animated <a href="feature_film" title="wikilink">feature film</a> version of <em>Fist of the North Star</em> was produced by <a href="Toei_Animation" title="wikilink">Toei Animation</a>, which premiered in Japan on <a href="March_8" title="wikilink">March 8</a>, <a href="1986" class="uri" title="wikilink">1986</a>. The movie was intended to be a big-screen treatment of the manga, and avoid the watering-down of violence that came with the TV series. An English-dubbed version produced by <a href="Streamline_Pictures" title="wikilink">Streamline Pictures</a> was first released in <a href="1991" class="uri" title="wikilink">1991</a>.</p>
<p>In a notable deviation from the series, the film finds time to begin with a detailed peek at the Earth as it was before and during the fabled nuclear devastation. Starting with a calm, surreal look at various points of mother nature, a brief on-screen message then informs the audience of the imminent calamity, followed by unsettling scenes of human life consumed in flame.</p>
<p>The film follows the TV series and manga from Kenshiro's defeat at the hands of Shin to the first battle with Raoh, although certain liberties were taken to tell the story in a condensed form. Toki, the second of the four Hokuto Brothers, is never seen or mentioned, while Shin and Rei are the only Nanto Seiken masters to appear in the film. While Yuria's Nanto heritage is mentioned thorought the movie in the Japanese version, her role as the Last Nanto General is downplayed. Mamiya, Rei's love interest, is never seen, partly because Yuria is the heroine in her place. Raoh serves as the main antagonist, with Jagi and Shin as the other two major villains. Many other villains from the manga such as the Colonel and Jackal only make cameo appearances as minor henchmen with some of the notable fight scenes involving Zeed, Heart, the Fang King and Uighur.</p>
<p>There were two endings produced for the film. The original theatrical ending in Japan showed Raoh emerging victorious over Kenshiro, but sparing his life, leaving him to protect Lin. An alternate ending was produced that shows the fight ending in a draw, which was the ending featured in the VHS and Laserdisc release of the film in Japan. The English dub version by Streamline Pictures is based on the theatrical version and thus features the original ending. Many Western fans believe that the &quot;draw ending&quot; was the original ending, but this is a common misconception due to the fact that the original ending where Raoh wins is not featured in any of the official home video releases in Japan.</p>
<p>The English dub version of the movie was not only first animated incarnation of <em>Fist of the North Star</em> to be released in English, it was also one of the earliest anime films distributed in North America and has had mixed reviews among casual viewers and anime fandom. A review from Akemi's Anime World calls it &quot;so bad it's good, and the original in the genre&quot; and calls quality of the dub &quot;cheesy&quot;, but &quot;suitable&quot;.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> Richard Harrington of the <a href="Washington_Post" title="wikilink">Washington Post</a> criticized the violent nature of the movie and quality of the animation, saying that &quot;watching it you'll feel as comfortable as a hemophiliac in a razor blade factory&quot;.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> Stephen Nolden of the <a href="New_York_Times" title="wikilink">New York Times</a> expresses that &quot;in its carelessly translated and poorly dubbed English adaptation, the characters express themselves in diction so stiff that they seem ludicrously prissy&quot;.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="live-action-movie">1995 live-action movie</h3>
<p>An American-produced live-action movie version of <em>Fist of the North Star</em> was released in 1995, directed by <a href="Tony_Randel" title="wikilink">Tony Randel</a> based on a script by Peter Atkins and Wynne McLaughlin. The movie, loosely based on the Shin storyline of the manga, stars <a href="Gary_Daniels" title="wikilink">Gary Daniels</a> as Kenshiro, <a href="Costas_Mandylor" title="wikilink">Costas Mandylor</a> as Shin and Japanese actress Isako Washio as Yuria, with <a href="Malcom_McDowell" title="wikilink">Malcom McDowell</a> as Ryuken and <a href="Chris_Penn" title="wikilink">Chris Penn</a> as &quot;Jackal&quot; (actually a renamed Jagi). The movie saw a theatrical release in Japan, but went <a href="direct-to-video" title="wikilink">straight-to-video</a> in the US. The Japanese dubbed version used the original voice actors from the 1980s anime series.</p>
<p>The movie had mixed reviews from fans and critics. <a href="Dave_Foster" title="wikilink">Dave Foster</a> of <em>DVD Times</em> panned the movie as a poor adaptation and commented that Kenshiro's pressure point techniques &quot;<em>look rather tame</em>&quot; in comparison to the way depicted in the manga and anime series.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a>A reviewer from eFilmCritic remarked that Kenshiro's defeat at the hands of Shin &quot;<em>comes off as standard</em>&quot; and &quot;<em>unbelievably goofy</em>&quot; compared to the 1986 animated movie version.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="new-fist-of-the-north-star"><em>New Fist of the North Star</em></h3>

<p>is a three-part <a href="OVA" class="uri" title="wikilink">OVA</a> series produced by <a href="Toei_Animation" title="wikilink">Toei Animation</a> that was originally released in <a href="2003" class="uri" title="wikilink">2003</a> and <a href="2004" class="uri" title="wikilink">2004</a> in Japan. It is based on an original <em>Hokuto no Ken</em> novel by Buronson and Hara , whom the first episode of the trilogy draws its title from. It was fully licensed and released in English by <a href="ADV_Films" title="wikilink">ADV Films</a>. <a href="Akira_Kamiya" title="wikilink">Akira Kamiya</a>, who had voiced Kenshiro in all previous animated incarnations, was replaced by <a href="Takehito_Koyasu" title="wikilink">Takehito Koyasu</a> for this new OVA series. Celebrity voices were also employed, with musician <a href="Gackt" class="uri" title="wikilink">Gackt</a> (who also performs the opening and ending themes of the OVA) as the antagonist Seiji. It was the last animated incarnation of <em>Hokuto no Ken</em> produced by Toei.</p>
<p>Set sometime after the conclusion of <em>Hokuto no Ken 2</em> and the original manga, a man named Sanga has constructed a fortified zone called The Last Land. While Sanga's men go out and seek water through violent means, they encounter Kenshiro who desires to end their reign of terror.</p>
<p>The ADV Films'dub of the trilogy has garnered positive reviews from critics. Chris Wood of Toon Zone praised &quot;Kenshiro is in fine form, and though the story may not blow you away, it&lt;U+2019&gt;s plenty adequate to support the action&quot;<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> Mike Toole of Anime Jump says that <em>New Fist</em> is &quot;flashy and a little cheap, but ultimately rewarding.&quot;<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> Chris Beveridge of AnimeOnDVD.com was &quot;very pleased with&quot; the first episode<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a>, but felt that the second episode could've been &quot;much better written&quot;<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> and that the third episode was unneccesary and that the trilogy &quot;could have been a lot tighter with a bit more streamlining of the script&quot;.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a></p>

<li id="fn1">While the name Hokuto Shinken literally means <em>Big Dipper God Fist</em>, the standard translation for the fighting style is the same as its English title, <em>Fist of the North Star</em>. It is also referred as the <em>Sacred Martial Arts of the Great Bear</em> in Viz Media edition and as <em>God Fist of the North Star</em> in the Gutsoon! edition.<a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-back">↩</a></li>

<li id="fn12">Like Hokuto, the term Nanto is usually localized in English translations as &quot;South Star&quot; (or &quot;Southern Cross&quot; in the Viz edition, the name of Shin's city). Nanto actually refers to the <a href="Dipper_(Chinese_constellation)" title="wikilink">South Dipper</a>, a Chinese asterism that forms part of <a href="Sagittarius_(constellation)" title="wikilink">Sagittarius</a>. The <em>Fighting Mania</em> arcade game actually alternates between &quot;South Star&quot; and the literal &quot;South Dipper&quot; in translations. The asterism has no relation to the <a href="Southern_Cross" title="wikilink">Southern Cross</a>.<a href="#fnref12" class="footnote-back">↩</a></li>
