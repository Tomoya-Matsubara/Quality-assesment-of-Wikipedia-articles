The original idea was mooted by a graduates' association and an open design competition was held for the memorial project. The foundation stone was initially erected along Collyer Quay Street outside the <a href="The_Fullerton_Hotel_Singapore" title="wikilink">Fullerton Hotel</a> in 1970. After a series of setbacks and delays, the project was finally scrapped after no worthy design was accepted, which resulted the foundation stone becoming the memorial afterwards. In 2000, the memorial was relocated to the <a href="National_Archives_of_Singapore" title="wikilink">National Archives of Singapore</a> at Canning Rise where it stands today.</p>

An open design competition was held and <a href="sculptor" title="wikilink">sculptors</a> were asked to come up with a design to celebrate the Singaporean for &quot;his courage, his adventurous and enterprising spirit and his indomitable will, not only to survive but to make good.&quot;<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>

<p>On January 18, 1970, <a href="President_of_Singapore" title="wikilink">President</a> <a href="Yusof_bin_Ishak" title="wikilink">Yusof bin Ishak</a> laid the memorial's <a href="Cornerstone" title="wikilink">foundation stone</a> along <a href="Collyer_Quay" title="wikilink">Collyer Quay Street</a>, on what was supposed to be a temporary site. Before an audience of some 500 people, including members of the diplomatic corps, President Yusof gave a speech:</p>

<p>The foundation stone consists of a rectangular <a href="granite" class="uri" title="wikilink">granite</a> stone topping off a <a href="pyramid" class="uri" title="wikilink">pyramid</a>-shaped brick pedestal with inscriptions in the four <a href="Languages_of_Singapore" title="wikilink">official languages</a> (<a href="English_language" title="wikilink">English</a>, <a href="Malay_language" title="wikilink">Malay</a>, <a href="Mandarin_language" title="wikilink">Mandarin</a>, and <a href="Tamil_language" title="wikilink">Tamil</a>):</p>

<h3 id="competition">Competition</h3>
<p>In July 1973, designs for the memorial had been received from 38 sculptors but the top two prizes were not awarded; it was found that no entry being deemed worthy of the honour by AIS panel of judges earlier. Instead, five sculptors received merit awards from AIS, together with a token S$250.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p><img src="War_Memorial_Park_5,_Singapore,_Aug_06.JPG" title="fig:180|The Civilian War Memorial in the War Memorial Park at Beach Road was referred as resembling &quot;four chopsticks&quot;" alt="180|The Civilian War Memorial in the War Memorial Park at Beach Road was referred as resembling &quot;four chopsticks&quot;" /> One of the merit awards recipients, <a href="Ng_Eng_Teng" title="wikilink">Ng Eng Teng</a>, who was to receive Singapore's <a href="Cultural_Medallion" title="wikilink">Cultural Medallion</a> in 1981 and who now has his critically-acclaimed works all over Singapore, commented unhappily: &quot;We have never been so embarrassed or insulted in all our professional lives. No professional artist of our standing would condescend to receive such an amount. We felt we had been taken for a ride.&quot;<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>In response, AIS expressed regret that the aggrieved sculptors had publicly stated their dissatisfaction. The alumni further rejected a complaint that the results were 10 months overdue, and repeated that no suitable entry had been received. Subsequently, three of the five sculptors banded together to produce a design they described as &quot;four pieces of <a href="cuboid" class="uri" title="wikilink">cuboid</a> leaning towards each other and pivoted on four corners&quot; which was referred by AIS as resembling &quot;four <a href="chopstick" title="wikilink">chopsticks</a>&quot;.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> Ironically, this was the nickname and roughly the design concept of the <a href="Civilian_War_Memorial" title="wikilink">Civilian War Memorial</a>, which was adopted in another separate open competition in 1966.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p>In September 1975, the alumni announced in public again that the Early Founders Project was at &quot;a very advanced stage and will be launched as soon as Government approval has been obtained. The site of the monument has already been earmarked on the reclaimed land off the <a href="Esplanade,_Singapore" title="wikilink">Esplanade</a>.&quot;<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p>Despite the announcement, the ambitious project became inactive and was finally scrapped after no worthy design was accepted and not nearly enough of the S$250,000 funds had been raised. In 1985, the alumni announced that the funds collected earlier would be rediverted to other projects, such as providing scholarships.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="roles-switched">Roles switched</h3>
<p>As a result, the memorial stone became the memorial itself. The monument was later moved by the authorities to make way for the <a href="gentrification" class="uri" title="wikilink">gentrification</a> of the Fullerton Building, and was relocated to the National Archives of Singapore, where it stands almost forgotten today. The authorities hope that when Singapore's community of values had evolved to the point that a common language of art could be used to complete the task of building such a monument again.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
