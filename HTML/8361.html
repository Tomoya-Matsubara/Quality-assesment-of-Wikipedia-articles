<p><strong><em>1982, Janine</em></strong> is a <a href="novel" class="uri" title="wikilink">novel</a> by the <a href="Scotland" title="wikilink">Scottish</a> author <a href="Alasdair_Gray" title="wikilink">Alasdair Gray</a>. His second, it was published in <a href="1984" class="uri" title="wikilink">1984</a>. Its use of <a href="pornography" class="uri" title="wikilink">pornography</a> as a <a href="narrative" class="uri" title="wikilink">narrative</a> device attracted much criticism, although others, including Gray himself, consider it his best work.</p>

<p>The novel is narrated by Jock McLeish, a supervisor of the installation of alarm systems. <a href="Divorce" title="wikilink">Divorced</a>, <a href="alcoholic" class="uri" title="wikilink">alcoholic</a> and approaching fifty, his problems coalesce in a long night of the soul in a hotel room in <a href="Greenock" class="uri" title="wikilink">Greenock</a>.</p>
<p>McLeish attempts to spend the night assembling an intricate <a href="pornographic" class="uri" title="wikilink">pornographic</a> <a href="Fantasy_(psychology)" title="wikilink">fantasy</a>. His cast of characters includes: Janine, based on a childhood memory of <a href="Jane_Russell" title="wikilink">Jane Russell</a> in <a href="The_Outlaw" title="wikilink">The Outlaw</a>; Superb (short for Superbitch); and Big Momma, a <a href="obesity" title="wikilink">obese</a> <a href="lesbian" class="uri" title="wikilink">lesbian</a>. All of these are submitted to <a href="sadomasochistic" class="uri" title="wikilink">sadomasochistic</a> practices, parts of which are described at some length. However, McLeish constantly returns to reminiscences of his previous life and <a href="lover" title="wikilink">lovers</a>. These prompt his attempted <a href="suicide" class="uri" title="wikilink">suicide</a>. Chapter 11 of the novel is a <a href="typographical" class="uri" title="wikilink">typographical</a> explosion, with the text splitting into several parallel voices on each page (including that of <a href="God" class="uri" title="wikilink">God</a>). The crisis concludes with McLeish <a href="vomit" title="wikilink">vomiting</a> up the pills which he had hoped would kill him, and facing the truth of his actions as morning dawns.</p>
<h2 id="criticism">Criticism</h2>
<p>On the <a href="dust_jacket" title="wikilink">dust jacket</a> of the <a href="hardback" class="uri" title="wikilink">hardback</a> edition, Gray wrote that &quot;Every stylistic excess and moral defect which critics conspired to ignore in the author's first books... is to be found here in concentrated form.&quot;</p>
<p><img src="Janinechapter11.jpg" title="fig:An example of the typography in chapter 11" alt="An example of the typography in chapter 11" width="200" /> The <a href="paperback" class="uri" title="wikilink">paperback</a> edition of the novel concludes with an appendix of criticism of the work, both for and against. Critics praising the work included Jonathan Baumbach in the <a href="New_York_Times" title="wikilink">New York Times</a> (&quot;1982 Janine has a verbal energy, an intensity of vision&quot;) and <a href="William_Boyd_(writer)" title="wikilink">William Boyd</a> in the <a href="Times_Literary_Supplement" title="wikilink">Times Literary Supplement</a> (&quot;His style is limpid and classically elegant&quot;). The Boyd quotation is juxtaposed with one from Paul Ableman in <a href="The_Literary_Review" title="wikilink">The Literary Review</a> criticising the &quot;irritating mannerisms&quot;. Peter Levi on the <a href="BBC" class="uri" title="wikilink">BBC</a> called the book &quot;Radioactive hogwash&quot;, while Joe Ambrose of <a href="The_Irish_Sunday_Tribune" title="wikilink">The Irish Sunday Tribune</a> called the author &quot;a vainglorious lout&quot; and &quot;a profoundly reactionary penman&quot;.</p>
<p>In an introduction to the <a href="2003" class="uri" title="wikilink">2003</a> Canongate Classic edition, <a href="Will_Self" title="wikilink">Will Self</a> argues that the controversial pornographic fantasies illustrate McLeish's repression of his past real love affairs, reflect his <a href="reactionary" class="uri" title="wikilink">reactionary</a> political stance, and show the effects of his childhood experiences. McLeish's linking of sex with the idea of &quot;homecoming&quot; originates in his difficult relationship with his mother.</p>
<p>Self also notes the significance of the title, <a href="1982" class="uri" title="wikilink">1982</a> being &quot;a point at which Scotland could be said to have reached just one of its many nadirs&quot;. This lowpoint included the destruction of the <a href="coal" class="uri" title="wikilink">coal</a> industry which had employed McLeish's father, under a <a href="Conservative_Party_(UK)" title="wikilink">Conservative</a> government of which McLeish is a supporter.</p>
