<p><strong>Bruce Castle</strong> (formerly the Lordship House) is a <a href="Listed_building" title="wikilink">Grade I listed</a> 16th-century<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> <a href="manor_house" title="wikilink">manor house</a> in <a href="Lordship_Lane_(Haringey)" title="wikilink">Lordship Lane</a>, <a href="Tottenham" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tottenham</a>, <a href="London" class="uri" title="wikilink">London</a>. Believed to have been built on the site of an earlier manor house, about which little is known, the current house is one of the oldest surviving English houses to be built in <a href="brick" class="uri" title="wikilink">brick</a>. It was repeatedly remodelled in the 17th and 18th centuries.</p>
<p>The house has been home to <a href="William_Compton_(courtier)" title="wikilink">Sir William Compton</a>, <a href="Richard_Sackville,_3rd_Earl_of_Dorset" title="wikilink">Richard Sackville</a>, the <a href="Baron_Coleraine#Barons_Coleraine,_First_Creation_(1625)" title="wikilink">Barons Coleraine</a> and <a href="Rowland_Hill_(postal_reformer)" title="wikilink">Sir Rowland Hill</a>, among others. After a period as a school in the 19th century, during which time a large extension was built to the west, it was converted into a museum on the history of the areas which constitute the present <a href="London_Borough_of_Haringey" title="wikilink">London Borough of Haringey</a> and on the history of the postal service. The building also houses the archives of the London Borough of Haringey. Since 1892 the grounds have been a public park, Tottenham's oldest.</p>
<h2 id="origins-of-the-name">Origins of the name</h2>
<p>The name derives from the <a href="House_of_Bruce" title="wikilink">House of Bruce</a>, which had historically owned a third of the <a href="manorialism" title="wikilink">manor</a> of Tottenham. However, there was no castle in the area at the time, and the family is unlikely to have lived in the area.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> Upon his accession to <a href="King_of_Scots" title="wikilink">the Scottish throne</a>, <a href="Robert_I_of_Scotland" title="wikilink">Robert I of Scotland</a> forfeited his lands in England,<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> along with any connection between the family and the area, the land then being granted to <a href="Richard_Spigurnell" title="wikilink">Richard Spigurnell</a> and <a href="Thomas_Hethe" title="wikilink">Thomas Hethe</a>.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>

The Norman All Hallows Church and priory, then as now the oldest surviving buildings in the area, are also shown." /> The three parts of the manor of Tottenham were united in the early 15th century, under the Gedeney family, and have remained united since.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> In all early records, the building is referred to as the Lordship House. The name of &quot;Bruce Castle&quot; first appears to have been adopted by <a href="Henry_Hare,_2nd_Baron_Coleraine" title="wikilink">Henry Hare, 2nd Baron Coleraine</a> (1636&lt;U+2013&gt;1708),<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> although Lysons dates the usage of the name to the late 13th century.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="early-construction">Early construction</h2>
<p>A detached <a href="Tudor_style_architecture" title="wikilink">Tudor</a> round <a href="tower" class="uri" title="wikilink">tower</a> stands immediately to the southeast of the house, and is generally considered to be the earliest part of the building;<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> however, Lysons believes it to have been a later addition.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> The tower is built of local red brick, and is  tall, with walls  thick. The purpose of the tower is not known; it is conjectured that it was built as a <a href="dovecote" class="uri" title="wikilink">dovecote</a>.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> In 2006, excavations revealed that the tower continues for some distance below the current ground level.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> The design of a window, in the <a href="Strawberry_Hill_Gothic" title="wikilink">Strawberry Hill Gothic</a> style made popular by <a href="Horace_Walpole" title="wikilink">Horace Walpole</a>, in the uppermost part of the tower, suggests internal alterations were made during the late 18th century.</p>
<p><img src="Tottenham,Bruce_Castle,_Tower.jpg" title="fig:The round tower" alt="The round tower" /> Sources disagree on the house's initial construction date, and no records survive of its construction. There is some archaeological evidence for parts of the building dating to the 15th century;<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> Robinson's 1840 <em>History and Antiquities of the Parish of Tottenham</em> suggests a date of about 1514,<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> although the Royal Commission on Historic Monuments attributes it to the late-16th century. Pevsner speculates that the front may have formed part of a <a href="courtyard_house" title="wikilink">courtyard house</a> of which the remainder has disappeared.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<p>The principal facade of the Grade I mansion has been substantially remodelled over time, and now shows little evidence of its early antecedents, appearing more an 17th-century manor house then a castle. The house is constructed of red brick with <a href="ashlar" class="uri" title="wikilink">ashlar</a> <a href="Quoin_(architecture)" title="wikilink">quoining</a>, the principal facade, terminated by symmetrical matching bays, has tall paned windows. The house and detached tower are amongst the earliest uses of brick as the principal building material for an English house.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
<p>The 2006 excavations by the <a href="Museum_of_London" title="wikilink">Museum of London</a> uncovered the chalk foundations of an earlier building on the site, of which nothing is currently known.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> Although there is no archaeological evidence or surviving historical record of its construction, and it does not appear in any illustrations, <a href="Pipe_Rolls" title="wikilink">court rolls</a> of 1742 refer to the repair of a <a href="drawbridge" class="uri" title="wikilink">drawbridge</a>, implying that the building then had a <a href="moat" class="uri" title="wikilink">moat</a>.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> A 1911 archaeological journal made passing reference to &quot;the recent levelling of the moat&quot;.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>

<p>It is generally believed that the earliest occupant of the house was <a href="William_Compton_(courtier)" title="wikilink">Sir William Compton</a>, <a href="Groom_of_the_Stool" title="wikilink">Groom of the Stool</a> to <a href="Henry_VIII_of_England" title="wikilink">Henry VIII</a> and one of the most prominent courtiers of the period, who acquired the manor of Tottenham in 1514.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> However, there is no recorded evidence of Compton's living in the house, and there is some evidence that the current building dates to a later period.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>

Sackville&#39;s large debts led to the sale of the house to Hugh Hare." alt="Richard Sackville, by William Larkin. Sackville&#39;s large debts led to the sale of the house to Hugh Hare." /> The earliest reference to the building dates from 1516, when <a href="Henry_VIII_of_England" title="wikilink">Henry VIII</a> met his sister <a href="Margaret_Tudor" title="wikilink">Margaret, Queen of Scots</a>, at &quot;Maister Compton's House beside Tottenham&quot;.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> The Comptons owned the building throughout the 16th century, but few records of the family or the building survive from the period.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a></p>
<p>In the early 17th century the house was owned by <a href="Richard_Sackville,_3rd_Earl_of_Dorset" title="wikilink">Richard Sackville, 3rd Earl of Dorset</a> and <a href="Lady_Anne_Clifford" title="wikilink">Lady Anne Clifford</a>. Sackville ran up high debts through gambling and extravagant spending; the house (then still called &quot;The Lordship House&quot;) was leased to <a href="Sir_Thomas_Peniston" title="wikilink">Thomas Peniston</a>. Peniston's wife, Martha, daughter of <a href="Sir_Thomas_Temple,_1st_Baronet,_of_Stowe" title="wikilink">Sir Thomas Temple</a> was said to be the Earl of Dorset's mistress. The house was later sold to wealthy <a href="Norfolk" class="uri" title="wikilink">Norfolk</a> landowner <a href="Hugh_Hare,_1st_Baron_Coleraine" title="wikilink">Hugh Hare</a>.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a></p>

<h3 id="hugh-hare-1st-baron-coleraine">Hugh Hare, 1st Baron Coleraine</h3>
<p>Hugh Hare (1606&lt;U+2013&gt;1667) had inherited a large amount of money from his great-uncle <a href="Nicholas_Hare" title="wikilink">Sir Nicholas Hare</a>, <a href="Master_of_the_Rolls" title="wikilink">Master of the Rolls</a>. On the death of his father, his mother had remarried <a href="Henry_Montagu,_1st_Earl_of_Manchester" title="wikilink">Henry Montagu, 1st Earl of Manchester</a>, allowing the young Hugh Hare to rise rapidly in <a href="Noble_court" title="wikilink">Court</a> and social circles. He married Montagu's daughter by his first marriage and purchased the manor of Tottenham, including the Lordship House, in 1625, and was ennobled as <a href="Baron_Coleraine" title="wikilink">Baron Coleraine</a> shortly thereafter.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a></p>
<p>Being closely associated with the court of <a href="Charles_I_of_England" title="wikilink">Charles I</a>, Hare's fortunes went into decline during the <a href="English_Civil_War" title="wikilink">English Civil War</a>. His <a href="Longford_Castle" title="wikilink">castle at Longford</a> and his house in <a href="Totteridge" class="uri" title="wikilink">Totteridge</a> were seized by Parliamentary forces, and returned upon the <a href="English_Restoration" title="wikilink">Restoration</a> in a severe state of disrepair. Records of Tottenham from the period are now lost, and it is not known what happened at the Lordship House during the period.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> Hugh Hare died at his home in Totteridge in 1667, having choked to death on a bone attempting to eat <a href="Domestic_turkey" title="wikilink">turkey</a> whilst laughing and drinking,<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> and was succeeded by his son <a href="Henry_Hare,_2nd_Baron_Coleraine" title="wikilink">Henry Hare, 2nd Baron Coleraine</a>.</p>
<h3 id="henry-hare-2nd-baron-coleraine">Henry Hare, 2nd Baron Coleraine</h3>
<p>Henry Hare (1635&lt;U+2013&gt;1708) settled at the Lordship House, renaming it Bruce Castle in honour of the area's historic connection with the <a href="House_of_Bruce" title="wikilink">House of Bruce</a>.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> Hare was a noted historian and author of the first history of Tottenham. He grew up at the Hare family house at Totteridge, and it is not known when he moved to Tottenham. At the time of the birth of his first child, Hugh, in 1668, the family were still living in Totteridge, while by the time of the death of his first wife Constantia, in 1680, the family were living in Bruce Castle. According to Hare, Constantia was buried in <a href="Tottenham#Sites_or_buildings_of_historical_interest" title="wikilink">All Hallows Church</a> in Tottenham. However, the <a href="parish_register" title="wikilink">parish register</a> for the period is complete and makes no mention of her death or burial.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a></p>
<p><img src="Bruce_Castle_Park.JPG" title="fig:The grounds of Bruce Castle, now a public park" alt="The grounds of Bruce Castle, now a public park" /> Following the death of Constantia, Hare married Sarah Alston. They had been engaged in 1661, but she had instead married <a href="John_Seymour,_4th_Duke_of_Somerset" title="wikilink">John Seymour, 4th Duke of Somerset</a>. There is evidence that during Sarah's marriage to Seymour and Hare's marriage to Constantia, a close relationship was sustained between them.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a></p>

<p><img src="Bruce_Castle_north_elevation.JPG" title="fig:North elevation, showing the Coleraine crest on the north pediment" alt="North elevation, showing the Coleraine crest on the north pediment" /> The house was remodelled again under the 3rd Baron Coleraine's ownership. An extra range of rooms was added to the north, and the pediment of the north front ornamented with a large crest of the Coleraine arms.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a></p>
<p>Hare's marriage was not consummated, and following an affair with a French woman, Rosa du Plessis, du Plessis bore him his only child, a daughter named Henrietta Rosa Peregrina, born in France in 1745.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> Hare died in 1749 leaving his estates to the four-year-old Henrietta, but her claim was rejected due to her French nationality. After many years of legal challenges, the estates, including Bruce Castle, were granted to her husband <a href="James_Townsend" title="wikilink">James Townsend</a>, who she had married at age 18.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a></p>
<p>James Townsend was a leading citizen of the day. He served as a <a href="magistrate" class="uri" title="wikilink">magistrate</a>, was <a href="Member_of_Parliament" title="wikilink">Member of Parliament</a> for <a href="West_Looe_(UK_Parliament_constituency)" title="wikilink">West Looe</a>, and in 1772 became <a href="Lord_Mayor_of_the_City_of_London" title="wikilink">Lord Mayor of London</a>, whilst Henrietta was a prominent artist, many of whose <a href="engraving" title="wikilink">engravings</a> of 18th century Tottenham survive in the Bruce Castle Museum.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a></p>
<p>After 1764, under the ownership of James Townsend, the house was remodelled again. The narrow east front was remodelled into an entrance front, and given the appearance of a typical Georgian house, while the gabled attics on the south front were removed, giving the south facade the appearance it has today.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a></p>
<p>James and Henrietta Townsend's son, Henry Hare Townsend, showed little interest in the area or in the traditional role of the <a href="Lord_of_the_Manor" title="wikilink">Lord of the Manor</a>. After leasing the house to a succession of tenants, the house and grounds were sold in 1792 to Thomas Smith of <a href="Gray&#39;s_Inn" title="wikilink">Gray's Inn</a> as a country residence.</p>

<p>Following the <a href="French_Revolution" title="wikilink">French Revolution</a> in 1789, a second wave of refugees arrived in England.
