<p><strong>The Baltimore City College</strong> (<strong>BCC</strong>), also referred to as <strong>The Castle on the Hill</strong>, historically <strong>The College</strong>, and most commonly <strong>City</strong>, is a public <a href="college-preparatory" class="uri" title="wikilink">college-preparatory</a> <a href="magnet_school" title="wikilink">magnet school</a> in <a href="Baltimore,_Maryland" title="wikilink">Baltimore, Maryland</a>, <a href="United_States" title="wikilink">U.S.</a> Despite its name, the school is not a college as it lacks the authority to confer baccalaureate degrees. The City College curriculum includes the <a href="International_Baccalaureate_Programme" title="wikilink">International Baccalaureate Programme</a> and emphasizes study in the <a href="classics" class="uri" title="wikilink">classics</a> and <a href="liberal_arts" title="wikilink">liberal arts</a>. Admission to City College is competitive. Applicants from Baltimore and the surrounding area are evaluated using a combination of grades and standardized test scores.</p>
<p>Established in 1839 as an all-male institution, City College is the third oldest public <a href="high_school" title="wikilink">high school</a> in the United States, predated by the <a href="English_High_School_of_Boston" title="wikilink">English High School of Boston</a> (1829) and the <a href="Central_High_School_of_Philadelphia" title="wikilink">Central High School of Philadelphia</a> (1836).<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a><a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a><a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> The school was located in three different buildings in <a href="downtown_Baltimore" title="wikilink">downtown Baltimore</a> before relocating in 1928 to its current 38-<a href="acre" class="uri" title="wikilink">acre</a> (153,781 <a href="square_metre" title="wikilink">m&lt;U+00B2&gt;</a>) campus at 33rd Street and The Alameda in the <a href="Waverly,_Baltimore" title="wikilink">Waverly</a> neighborhood of north Baltimore. Following an extensive renovation of the school's main building in 1978, the school became <a href="coeducational" class="uri" title="wikilink">coeducational</a>.</p>
<p>City College has maintained a strong academic tradition and has many <a href="List_of_Baltimore_City_College_people" title="wikilink">notable alumni</a> including a <a href="Nobel_Laureate" title="wikilink">Nobel Laureate</a>, a <a href="Wolf_Prize" title="wikilink">Wolf Prize</a> recipient, <a href="Pulitzer_Prize" title="wikilink">Pulitzer Prize</a> winners, and leaders in business, military, and state and national <a href="politics" class="uri" title="wikilink">politics</a>.

<p>The creation of a male high school &quot;in which the higher branches of English and classical literature only should be taught&quot;, was authorized unanimously by the <a href="City_Council" title="wikilink">City Council</a> of <a href="Baltimore,_Maryland" title="wikilink">Baltimore</a>, <a href="Maryland" class="uri" title="wikilink">Maryland</a> on <a href="March_7" title="wikilink">March 7</a>, <a href="1839" class="uri" title="wikilink">1839</a>.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> Accordingly, a building on what was then Courtland Street (now Preston Gardens at St. Paul Place) was acquired to serve as the new high school. The school opened it doors on <a href="October_20" title="wikilink">October 20</a>, <a href="1839" class="uri" title="wikilink">1839</a> with 46 students and 1 teacher, <a href="Nathan_C._Brooks" title="wikilink">Nathan C. Brooks</a>. The school was housed in three different locations in its first three years of existence before returning to the original building on Courtland Street. Finally, in 1843 the city council allocated $23,000 to acquire the Assembly Rooms at the northwestern corner of Fayette and Holliday Streets for the school.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> In 1850, the city council granted the board of school commissioners the right to confer graduates of the school with certificates, and the following year the school held its first <a href="commencement" class="uri" title="wikilink">commencement</a> ceremony in 1851.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1865, in accordance with a recommendation from the Board of Commissioners of the Baltimore City public schools, the school began offering a five-year track,<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> as part of a process aimed at elevating the school to the status of a college so that it could grant its graduates baccalaureate degrees. The following year on <a href="October_9" title="wikilink">October 9</a>, <a href="1866" class="uri" title="wikilink">1866</a>, as another part of this process, the school was renamed &quot;The Baltimore City College&quot; (BCC) by act of the city council. The city council failed to take any further action, and although the school changed nominally, it was never granted the power to confer <a href="Bachelor_of_Arts" title="wikilink">Bachelor of Arts</a> degrees.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<p>The building on Fayette and Holliday Streets had been in a state of decline for two decades. It was not until 1873, when a fire spread from the Holliday Street Theater to the &quot;Assembly Rooms&quot;, that the city council finally decided to expend the resources to erect a building for City College. A lot was acquired on Howard Street opposite Centre Street and the city council allocated $150,000 for the construction of the new building.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> The new English <a href="Gothic_revival" title="wikilink">Gothic revival</a>-styled building was dedicated on <a href="February_1" title="wikilink">February 1</a>, <a href="1875" class="uri" title="wikilink">1875</a> and the school moved in the following week.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>

<p>The Tudor Gothic building which housed the school lasted until 1892, when it was undermined by the construction of the <a href="Baltimore_&amp;_Ohio_Railroad" title="wikilink">Baltimore &amp; Ohio Railroad</a> tunnel from Camden Station to Mount Royal Station and collapsed.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> In 1895, a new structure, designed by the architects Baldwin and Pennington, was erected on the site. This new building quickly became overcrowded and an annex was established on 26th Street. The addition did not help with the increase in school-aged youth beginning to attend City College by <a href="World_War_I" title="wikilink">World War I</a>. During the 1920s, alumni began a campaign to provide the school with a more suitable building, and in 1926 ground was broken for a massive Collegiate <a href="Gothic_architecture" title="wikilink">Gothic</a> stone castle at 33rd Street and The Alameda. This new structure cost almost $3 million.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
<p>The school began admitting <a href="African-American" class="uri" title="wikilink">African-American</a> students following the landmark ruling <em><a href="Brown_v._Board_of_Education" title="wikilink">Brown v. Board of Education</a></em>. In September 1954,  entered City College.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> The administration also sent two African-American men, Eugene Parker and Pierre Davis, to teach at school in 1956. Parker taught at City College for 30 years and Davis, after teaching for one year, returned as the school's first black principal in 1971.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1978, after having undergone its first major capital renovations, the high school welcomed women for the first time. The all-male tradition did not end easily; alumni had argued for the uniqueness of a single-sex educational system and convinced the task force studying the issue to vote 11&lt;U+2013&gt;6 in favor of keeping the all-male tradition. The Board of School Commissioners, in a reversal, voted to admit women citing <a href="U.S._Constitution" title="wikilink">constitutional</a> concerns.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>

In addition to providing the building's utilities, the power plant originally housed five work shops: an electrical shop, a mechanical shop, a metal shop, a printing shop, and a wood shop.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> Only the main building is in academic use by the school. Both buildings were designed by the architecture firm of Buckler and Fenhagen. Just south of the main building is Alumni Field, the school's stadium, which serves as home to the <a href="American_football" title="wikilink">football</a>, boy's and girl's lacrosse and track teams. During a major building renovation in 1978 a modern gymnasium was added to the southwest corner of the main building.</p>
<p>On <a href="June_30" title="wikilink">June 30</a>, <a href="2003" class="uri" title="wikilink">2003</a>, the current building was placed on the <a href="National_Register_of_Historic_Places" title="wikilink">National Register of Historic Places</a>.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> The listing of the building coincided with its 75th anniversary.

<p>Throughout most of the 20th century the <a href="college_preparatory" title="wikilink">college preparatory</a> curriculum at City College was divided into two tracks: the &quot;A&quot; course and the &quot;B&quot; course. Though both tracks were intended to provide students with the skills necessary for college, the &quot;A&quot; course was intended to be more rigorous. In the early 1990s, Principal Joseph Antenson removed the two tier system because he believed it to be racially discriminatory.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> In 1998, the academic program took on the general form in which it exists today, when Principal Joseph M. Wilson introduced the <a href="IB_Diploma_Program" title="wikilink">International Baccalaureate Diploma Program</a> (IB Program) into the 11th and 12th grade curricula.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> The IB Program is a comprehensive, liberal arts program that must be completed in students&lt;U+2019&gt; junior and senior years. Students now have the option to pursue a standard college preparatory curriculum, the IB Program, or a combination of the two.</p>
<p>In 2007, opposition to the continuation of the IB Program arose. Members of the Baltimore City College Alumni Association argued that the IB Program was diverting a significant amount of the school's resources, in order to benefit a fraction of the student population.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> Only approximately 30 students are in the full IB Diploma Program at City College. Some members also argued that the rigidity of the program did not give students enough flexibility. Citing these concerns, the alumni association encouraged the school to replace the IB Program with the &quot;A course&quot; and expand the number of <a href="Advanced_Placement_Program" title="wikilink"> Advanced Placement</a> courses offered.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> The alumni association's recommendation, though non-binding, was intended to persuade the school to terminate the IB program and replace it with a more equitable and flexible curriculum. Nevertheless, the school administration is moving ahead with plans to expand the IB Program by incorporating the <a href="IB_Middle_Years_Program" title="wikilink">IB Middle Years Program</a> into the 9th and 10th grade curricula.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a></p>
<p>In addition to the 23 IB courses,<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> the school offers . Both programs have contributed to the academic ranking of the school. In the 1999&lt;U+2013&gt;2000 academic year, City College was recognized by the <a href="U.S._Department_of_Education" title="wikilink">U.S. Department of Education</a> as a National Blue Ribbon School.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> In June 2005, the <em>Johns Hopkins Magazine</em> reported that the <a href="Johns_Hopkins_University" title="wikilink">Johns Hopkins University</a> had awarded full time, four-year scholarships to ten seniors. <a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> In the May 2007, <em><a href="Newsweek" class="uri" title="wikilink">Newsweek</a></em> report of the nation's top 1200 schools, City College was ranked 258<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> and in the 2006 report the school was ranked 206.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> The expansion of the number of AP and IB courses offered allowed City to perform well in the <em>Newsweek</em> rankings, which are based heavily on the number of AP and IB courses offered.</p>

<p>Students wishing to enroll in City College must apply in the 8th grade. Enrollment is open to both residents and non-residents of Baltimore City, though non-residents must pay tuition. Eligibility is based on a composite score that is determined by the Baltimore City Public School System. The school system generates the composite score based on a student's grades in the 7th grade and first quarter of the 8th grade, and a student's performance on a national standardized test, with the student's grades receiving double the weight as the test scores.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a></p>
<p>The enrollment at City College in 2007 was 1353 students. Of those students, 504 were males representing approximately 37.25% of the student populations, and the remaining 849 students were females, representing approximately 62.75% of the student population. The 1229 students who identified themselves as African-American comprised 90.84% of the student population. An additional 105 students identified themselves as white, comprising 7.76% of the student population.

The formal organization of an athletic program did not occur until 1895.<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a> During the early years of the athletic program, City College played mainly against college teams because few other secondary schools existed in Maryland.

<h4 id="football">Football</h4>

<p>The football program began in the 1880s, yet at the time the school faced mainly collegiate opponents, since few other schools in the area fielded teams.<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a> By the early 1900s this trend shifted, and the team began competing with other high schools. Between 1936 and 1940, under coach Harry Lawrence, City College remained undefeated for 38 consecutive games, which included 35 wins, three ties, and four state championships.<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a> In 1959, <a href="George_Young_(football_executive)" title="wikilink">George Young</a>, who would later become the <a href="general_manager" title="wikilink">general manager</a> of the <a href="New_York_Giants" title="wikilink">New York Giants</a>, became head coach of the team.

<p>One of the most memorable City&lt;U+2013&gt;Poly games occurred on <a href="Thanksgiving_Day" title="wikilink">Thanksgiving Day</a> 1965, at Baltimore's <a href="Memorial_Stadium_(Baltimore)" title="wikilink">Memorial Stadium</a>, with some 25,000 fans in attendance. City beat Poly 52–6, and completed a 10–0 season with the team being ranked eighth in the nation by a national sports poll.<a href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a> City's 52–6 victory over Poly in that game is the largest margin of victory in the history of the series.<a href="#fn72" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref72"><sup>72</sup></a> Former Baltimore Mayor <a href="Kurt_Schmoke" title="wikilink">Kurt Schmoke</a> was the <a href="quarterback" class="uri" title="wikilink">quarterback</a> and Maryland Delegate <a href="Curt_Anderson" title="wikilink">Curt Anderson</a> was the captain of that team.

<h4 id="lacrosse">Lacrosse</h4>
<p>The lacrosse program at City College is the oldest high school lacrosse program in the state of Maryland.<a href="#fn73" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref73"><sup>73</sup></a> The informal playing of lacrosse began at the school in 1879, when a group of students decided to field a team; this continued annually until 1891.<a href="#fn74" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref74"><sup>74</sup></a> In 1902, lacrosse became a permanent part of the school's athletic program. During the program's inception, City College played against collegiate lacrosse teams, including Johns Hopkins University. It was not until City's rival Poly fielded a team in 1912 that the school had high school opponents.<a href="#fn75" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref75"><sup>75</sup></a> At least 10 former members of the mens lacrosse team are in the <a href="National_Lacrosse_Hall_of_Fame" title="wikilink">National Lacrosse Hall of Fame</a>.

<h3 id="the-green-bag"><em>The Green Bag</em></h3>
<p><em>The Green Bag</em> is the senior class annual at City College. Published continuously since 1896, <em>The Green Bag</em> is the oldest publication still in existence at the school.<a href="#fn76" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref76"><sup>76</sup></a> G. Warfield Hobbs Jr., president of the 1896 senior class and first editor-in-chief of the <em>Green Bag</em>, gave the publication its name in recognition of the role of City College graduates in political leadership. Historically, the political appointees of the <a href="Governor_of_Maryland" title="wikilink">Governor of Maryland</a> have been known as the &quot;green bag&quot;, though the derivation of the term is unknown.<a href="#fn77" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref77"><sup>77</sup></a> The first yearbooks contained sketches of faculty and seniors, and included recollections, anecdotes, stories, and quotes significant to the student body. Underclassmen were included for the first time in 1948. In 2007, <em>The Green Bag</em> released its first full-color edition.<a href="#fn78" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref78"><sup>78</sup></a></p>
<p>The most controversial issue of the <em>Green Bag</em> was published in 1900 when Members of the senior class used the annual to make fun of their professors. The school board attempted to censor the edition by requiring the <em>Green Bag</em> to be reviewed by Principal Francis Soper. The yearbook had already been printed, and in defiance of the school board, the editors refused to have the edition censored and reprinted. The school board responded by withholding the diplomas of six of the editors and the business manager and by preventing the school from holding a public commencement ceremony. One of the boys expelled, Clarence Keating Bowie, became a member of the school board in 1926.<a href="#fn79" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref79"><sup>79</sup></a></p>

Instead the paper is produced by students enrolled in the <a href="journalism" class="uri" title="wikilink">journalism</a> course. Citing the decline of <em>The Collegian</em> and increasing disorder in the school, several students started an underground publication entitled <em>Omnibus</em> in May 2007.<a href="#fn82" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref82"><sup>82</sup></a></p>
