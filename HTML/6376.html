Because of the harsh winter conditions, difficult trail, and limited support competitors are allowed, it is considered the &quot;most difficult sled dog race in the world&quot;,<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> or even the &quot;toughest race in the world&quot;.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>In the competition, first run in 1984, a dog team leader (called a <a href="mushing" title="wikilink">musher</a>) and a team of 6 to 14 dogs race for 10 to 20 days. The course follows the route of the historic 1890s <a href="Klondike_Gold_Rush" title="wikilink">Klondike Gold Rush</a>, mail delivery, and transportation routes between Fairbanks, <a href="Dawson_City" title="wikilink">Dawson City</a>, and Whitehorse. Mushers pack up to  of equipment and provisions for themselves and their dogs to survive between checkpoints. They are permitted to leave dogs at checkpoints and dog drops, but not to replace them. <a href="dog_sled" title="wikilink">Sleds</a> may not be replaced (without penalty) and mushers cannot accept help from non-racers except at Dawson City, the halfway mark. Ten checkpoints and four dog drops, some more than  apart, lie along the trail. <a href="Veterinarian" title="wikilink">Veterinarians</a> are present at each to ensure the health and welfare of the dogs, give advice, and provide veterinary care for dropped dogs; together with the race marshal or a race judge, they may remove a dog or team from the race for medical or other reasons.</p>
<p>The route runs on frozen rivers, over four mountain ranges, and through isolated northern villages. Racers cover  or more, temperatures commonly drop as low as , and winds can reach  at higher elevations. <a href="Sonny_Lindner" title="wikilink">Sonny Lindner</a> won the inaugural race in 1984 from a field of 26 teams. The fastest run took place in 2009, when <a href="Sebastian_Schnuelle" title="wikilink">Sebastian Schnuelle</a> finished after 9 days, 23 hours, and 20 minutes. The 2009 competition also had the closest one-two finish, as Schnuelle beat second-place Hugh Neff by just four minutes. <a href="Lance_Mackey" title="wikilink">Lance Mackey</a>, who held the quickest finish record before Schnuelle, is the only musher to have won the race four times. In 2007, he became the first to win both the Yukon Quest and the <a href="Iditarod_Trail_Sled_Dog_Race" title="wikilink">Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race</a>, a feat he repeated the following year. The longest race time was in 1988, when <a href="Ty_Halvorson" title="wikilink">Ty Halvorson</a> took 20 days, 8 hours, and 29 minutes to finish. In 2000, <a href="Aliy_Zirkle" title="wikilink">Aliy Zirkle</a> became the first woman to win the race, in 10 days, 22 hours, and 57 minutes. To allow participation in both the Yukon Quest and the Iditarod, the 2010 Yukon Quest will begin in Fairbanks one week earlier than usual&lt;U+2014&gt;on February 6. Yukon Quest International, which runs the Yukon Quest sled dog race, also runs two shorter races: the Junior Quest and the Yukon Quest 300 (previously the Yukon Quest 250).</p>
<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<p>The idea for the Yukon Quest originated in April 1983 during a bar-room discussion among four Alaskans: LeRoy Shank, Roger Williams, Ron Rosser, and Willie Libb.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> The four proposed a thousand-mile sled dog race from Fairbanks, Alaska to Whitehorse, Yukon, to celebrate the <a href="Klondike_Gold_Rush" title="wikilink">Klondike Gold Rush</a>-era mail and transportation routes between the two.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> They disdained the many checkpoints and <a href="Race_stage" title="wikilink">stages</a> of the <a href="Iditarod_Sled_Dog_Race" title="wikilink">Iditarod Sled Dog Race</a><a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> and envisioned an endurance race in which racers would rely on themselves and survival would be as important as speed.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> &quot;We wanted more of a <a href="The_Bush_(Alaska)" title="wikilink">Bush</a> experience, a race that would put a little woodsmanship into it&quot;, Shank said at the race's 25th anniversary.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p>This remained a vague plan until August 1983, when the first public organizational meetings took place.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> Fundraising began, and the start date for the race was optimistically moved forward from February 1985 to February 25, 1984. The entry fee for the first race was $500, and Murray Clayton of <a href="Haines,_Alaska" title="wikilink">Haines, Alaska</a> became the first person to enter when he paid his fee in October 1983.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> In December 1983, the race was officially named the Yukon Quest.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> Two more months of planning followed, and a crew of volunteers was organized to staff the checkpoints and place trail markers.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> On February 25, 1984, 26 racers left Fairbanks for Whitehorse.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> Each team was limited to a maximum of 12 dogs, and racers had to finish with no fewer than nine. They also had to haul  of food per dog ( total) to cover the long distances between checkpoints.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<p>Numerous problems occurred in the first race. The leading mushers had to break trail because the <a href="snowmobile" class="uri" title="wikilink">snowmobile</a> intended for the task broke down. Trail markers often were absent or misplaced, and no preparations had been made for racers in <a href="Dawson_City" title="wikilink">Dawson City</a> until organizer Roger Williams flew there shortly after the race began. After Dawson City, mushers had their dogs and sleds trucked  to avoid a section of snowless trail, then had to deal with open sections of the Yukon River near Whitehorse due to above-average temperatures.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> The eventual winner of the inaugural race, Sonny Lindner, was greeted with little fanfare on his arrival. On the race's 25th anniversary, he recalled, &quot;I think it was 90 percent (camping) trip and maybe a little bit of racing.&quot;<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="first-decade">First decade</h3>
<p>After the inaugural race, organizers improved the marking of the trail for the first contest held in the Whitehorse&lt;U+2013&gt;Fairbanks direction. Musher Bill Cotter said, &quot;The trail was so nice that it was difficult to keep from going too fast.&quot;<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> The race grew in popularity over the next few years. In 1988 and again in 1989, 47 mushers entered. In 1989, 31 completed the race&lt;U+2014&gt;the most that have ever finished it.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> In 1990, Connie and Terri Frerichs became the first (and so far only) mother and daughter to compete in the same Yukon Quest: Terri finished 21st, beating her mother (22nd) by 26 minutes.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> The 1991 race saw eight teams withdraw in the first quarter due to an outbreak of a canine disease called the &quot;<a href="Healy,_Alaska" title="wikilink">Healy</a> Virus&quot;. Thirty-five more dogs were sickened before the spread of the virus was halted by colder weather halfway through the race.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> In 1992, unseasonable warmth caused problems in the first half of the race, and the second was affected by bitter cold.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> The head veterinarian of that race, Jeannie Olson, was replaced after she offered canine <a href="acupuncture" class="uri" title="wikilink">acupuncture</a> to several mushers. Though not then forbidden by any rule, this violated equal-treatment guidelines because she did not offer the treatment to every musher.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> At the end of that race, George Cook became the first musher since 1984 to finish short of Whitehorse when open water on the Yukon River prevented him from continuing. Because he did not quit, race officials gave him the Red Lantern Award.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a></p>
<p>Following the 1992 race, controversy erupted when the Alaska board of directors of Yukon Quest International informed the Yukon board that they were considering dropping the Yukon half of the Quest because Yukon officials did not meet fundraising goals. Alaska officials also believed it would be easier to manage an Alaska-only race.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> A crisis was averted when the Yukon board of directors agreed to raise more money and the two sides formed a joint board of directors.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> The 1993 race was run as usual, but Jeff Mann had a more eventful race than most. When a moose attacked his dog team, he was forced to kill it with an axe, then butcher it according to Quest rules. Later, he was penalized 90 minutes for borrowing a reporter's head lantern. Finally, after the conclusion of the race, he was fined half his winnings when his dogs tested positive for <a href="ibuprofen" class="uri" title="wikilink">ibuprofen</a>.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a></p>
<p>In the 1994 race, Alaskan Bruce Cosgrove was denied entry by Canadian customs officials in the pre-race verification process, the first and only time a musher has been denied entry into either Canada or Alaska. Cosgrove started the race, but quit before the border.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> Following the race, controversy again erupted when Alaska Yukon Quest officials announced they would unilaterally eliminate Whitehorse from the Yukon Quest and run a cheaper Fairbanks-to-Dawson City race. Members of the Yukon Quest organization revolted against this and voted to evict the board members who had proposed it.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="second-decade">Second decade</h3>
<p>The 1995 race featured 22 mushers, of whom 13 finished.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> Budget problems caused the first prize to drop by 25% to $15,000, contributing to the low participation.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> This problem was fixed for the 1996 race, with a first-place prize of $25,000.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> The 1997 race was won by Rick Mackey, brother of later Quest winner Lance Mackey; the two are the only brother-brother winning tandem in Quest history.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> Following the 1997 race, financial troubles again arose, this time on the Alaska side. Canadian organizers secured international sponsorship for the 1998 race, and when they refused to let this sponsorship money be used to pay debts accumulated in Alaska, members of the Alaska board threatened to host a separate competition. In the end, the Alaska board members were forced to resign, and a deal was worked out between the two sides.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a></p>
<p><img src="Quest_dogs.JPG" title="fig:Dogs race ahead at the start of the 2003 Yukon Quest in Whitehorse." alt="Dogs race ahead at the start of the 2003 Yukon Quest in Whitehorse." width="270" /> The 1998 race was run on schedule and had 38 entrants.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> The 1999 race was won by <a href="Alaska_Native" title="wikilink">Alaska Native</a> veterinarian Ramy Brooks, who defeated Mark May by 10 minutes.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> In 2000, Aliy Zirkle became the first woman to win the Yukon Quest after taking 10 days, 22 hours, and 57 minutes to trek the .<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> Also in 2000, Yukon Quest International added two races: the Quest 250 (today the Quest 300) and the Junior Quest<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> (both described <a href="#Junior_Yukon_Quest_and_Yukon_Quest_300" title="wikilink">below</a>). Competitors in each have gone on to participate in the Yukon Quest. The first of these graduated mushers competed in the 2001 race, won by Tim Osmar.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a></p>
<p>In 2002, the Yukon Quest was won by Hans Gatt, an Austrian-born resident of British Columbia and the first European to win. This was the first of three consecutive wins, making him the first three-time winner.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> In 2003, Gatt's second win was truncated by a lack of snow near Whitehorse. Unseasonable warmth forced organizers to truck mushers and their dog teams to Braeburn before continuing what became a  competition.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> The 2004 race saw 31 mushers start the race and 20 finish, a drop-out rate of 35%.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> During the first 24 years of the competition, there were 776 starters and 513 finishers.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> Though 90 more mushers attempted the race in the first 12 years than in the next dozen runnings, there is little difference in the percentage that did not finish (35% in 1984–1995; 33% in 1996–2007).<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="third-decade">Third decade</h3>
<p>In 2005, first-time participant Lance Mackey broke Hans Gatt's three-win streak. Mackey finished in 11 days, 32 seconds.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> The victory was the first of four straight wins by Mackey, who holds the record for most consecutive wins and is the only four-time winner. During Mackey's second win, a fierce storm atop Eagle Summit caused a whiteout that forced seven mushers and dog teams to be evacuated by helicopter. Partly because of the storm, only 11 finished the 2006 race&lt;U+2014&gt;the fewest ever.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> The finishers also endured an unusual course: because snow was scarce near Whitehorse, they doubled back and finished in Dawson City after racing the .<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a> In 2007, three dogs were killed in unrelated incidents, but Mackey tied Gatt's record of three consecutive wins. One month later, Mackey became the first person to win both the Yukon Quest and the Iditarod in the same year.<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> Mackey's fourth win came during the 2008 race, the first Yukon Quest to end in Whitehorse since 2003.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a></p>
<p>Because of the <a href="late_2000s_recession" title="wikilink">late 2000s recession</a>, the 2009 Yukon Quest <a href="Prize_money" title="wikilink">purse</a> was reduced to $151,000 from a planned total of $200,000. As a result, the first prize was reduced to $30,000 from the planned $35,000.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a> Partly because of this, Mackey withdrew before the race, making it easier for a newcomer to win.<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a> In the closest one&lt;U+2013&gt;two finish, German Sebastian Schnuelle completed the race faster than anyone before, finishing that year's  trip in 9 days, 23 hours, and 20 minutes. He was just four minutes ahead of Hugh Neff.<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a></p>
<p>Following the 2009 race, officials decided to advance the competition's start date by one week to better accommodate mushers also participating in the Iditarod. The 2010 race will start in Fairbanks on February 6, 2010.<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a> That race will run a slightly changed route because the building that housed the dog drop at McCabe Creek burned down shortly after the 2009 competition.<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a></p>

<p><img src="2009_Yukon_Quest_map.svg" title="fig:2009_Yukon_Quest_map.svg" alt="2009_Yukon_Quest_map.svg" width="464" /> The course of the race varies slightly from year to year due to ice conditions on the <a href="Yukon_River" title="wikilink">Yukon River</a>, snowfall, and other factors. The length of the route has also fluctuated, ranging from <a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a> in the weather-shortened 2003 race to  in 1998.<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a> In even-numbered years, the race starts in Fairbanks and ends in Whitehorse.

<p>Because of the extreme difficulty of the competition, several stages of preparation are needed. The first is the food drop, when mushers and race officials position caches of food and supplies at race checkpoints.<a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a> This is necessary because mushers may only use their supplies along the route, reflecting the Gold Rush era, when dog trains would resupply at points along the trail.<a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a> One week after the food drop, all dogs participating in the race undergo a preliminary veterinarian inspection to ensure they are healthy enough to race 1,000 miles in subarctic conditions.<a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a> The final stage of formal preparation is two days before the race, when mushers pick their starting order from a hat.<a href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a> {{-}}</p>

<p>The Yukon Quest encourages particpants' self-sufficiency,<a href="#fn176" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref176"><sup>176</sup></a> and one of its objectives is &quot;[to] encourage and facilitate knowledge and application of the widest variety of bush skills and practices that form the foundation of Arctic survival.&quot;<a href="#fn177" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref177"><sup>177</sup></a> On the trail, racers may not accept outside assistance and are limited in the changes they may make to their teams and sled.<a href="#fn178" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref178"><sup>178</sup></a> There are 10 checkpoints and four additional locations where sick or injured dogs may be dropped from a team. Only four checkpoint stops are mandated: a 36-hour stop at Dawson City; a four-hour stop in Eagle, Alaska; a two-hour stop at the first checkpoint; and an eight-hour stop at the last.<a href="#fn179" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref179"><sup>179</sup></a></p>
<p>As well as food, camping equipment, and dog-care gear, mushers must carry an axe, a cold-weather <a href="sleeping_bag" title="wikilink">sleeping bag</a>, a pair of <a href="snowshoes" class="uri" title="wikilink">snowshoes</a>, veterinary records, Quest promotional material, a cooker, and eight <a href="Dog_booties" title="wikilink">booties</a> per dog.<a href="#fn180" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref180"><sup>180</sup></a> Included in the required promotional material are numerous <a href="event_cover" title="wikilink">event covers</a> intended to reflect the Quest's ancestry as a mail route.<a href="#fn181" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref181"><sup>181</sup></a> One unusual rule requires mushers to immediately <a href="butcher" class="uri" title="wikilink">butcher</a> any <a href="Game_(food)" title="wikilink">game animal</a> killed during the race. This rule was applied in 1993, when a musher was attacked by a moose and killed it to protect himself.<a href="#fn182" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref182"><sup>182</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="entry-requirements">Entry requirements</h3>
<p>Competitors must meet a series of written and unwritten requirements before entering. The first is that each musher must have a team of dogs. The race does not furnish any dogs, but participants have been known to lease or borrow dog teams rather than raise their own. In the 2009 Yukon Quest, for example, Jamaican Newton Marshall borrowed a dog team from Canadian Hans Gatt.<a href="#fn183" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref183"><sup>183</sup></a> Each competitor must have completed at least two sled dog races sanctioned by Yukon Quest International: one of 200 miles (160 km) and one of 300 miles (180 km).<a href="#fn184" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref184"><sup>184</sup></a> Sanctioned races include the Copper Basin 300 and the Tustumena 200, Alaska races held before the Quest.<a href="#fn185" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref185"><sup>185</sup></a><a href="#fn186" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref186"><sup>186</sup></a></p>
<p>Those who have completed at least  of Quest-sanctioned racing are eligible to send in an entry form. This requires entrants to certify that they are older than 18, have not been censured by the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race, and have never been convicted of animal abuse or neglect.<a href="#fn187" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref187"><sup>187</sup></a> They must pay $1,500 or $2,000 for late entries.<a href="#fn188" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref188"><sup>188</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="dog-health">Dog health</h3>
<p><img src="Dog_care_after_the_2009_Yukon_Quest.jpg" title="fig:Veterinarians, handlers, and mushers examine two dog teams after the 2009 Yukon Quest." alt="Veterinarians, handlers, and mushers examine two dog teams after the 2009 Yukon Quest." width="300" /> Many of the Quest's rules are intended to ensure the health of dogs in hazardous conditions. This process begins before the race, when all dogs must be examined by race veterinarians, who certify that the animals are suited and healthy enough to participate.<a href="#fn189" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref189"><sup>189</sup></a> Before the race, dog equipment also must be checked by race officials. Padded harnesses are required, each musher must carry an appropriate amount of food, and additional food supplies must be in position at checkpoints.<a href="#fn190" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref190"><sup>190</sup></a></p>
<p>Mushers must start the race with at most fourteen dogs and finish with no fewer than six.<a href="#fn191" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref191"><sup>191</sup></a> Dogs are visually examined by veterinarians stationed at every checkpoint, and mushers can be ejected and banned from the race for mistreating dogs. Dog whips and forced feeding are forbidden.<a href="#fn192" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref192"><sup>192</sup></a> Participating dogs may not receive injections during the race or be under the influence of performance-enhancing substances such as <a href="steroid" title="wikilink">steroids</a>. The race marshal may remove any team from the race for violations of these rules or substandard dog care.<a href="#fn193" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref193"><sup>193</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="penalties">Penalties</h3>
<p>The Yukon Quest's rules allow race officials latitude on whether to assess a time penalty or monetary fine on mushers who violate one or more regulations.<a href="#fn194" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref194"><sup>194</sup></a> The most serious penalties can be assessed for mistreating dogs. Racers have been forcibly removed from the race for inadequate dog care; the most recent instance of this took place in 2008, when Donald Smidt was removed.<a href="#fn195" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref195"><sup>195</sup></a> More common are minor time and monetary penalties. For example, Dan Kaduce was fined $500 of his eventual $9,000 winnings for missing roll call at a mandatory meeting in 2007. Fines of $500 also have been levied for not attending the finish banquet, littering, not wearing start and finish bibs, or losing veterinary records.<a href="#fn196" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref196"><sup>196</sup></a> These minor penalties can have an effect on the race. In 2009, Hugh Neff, then in second place, was penalized two hours for mushing on the Steese Highway.<a href="#fn197" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref197"><sup>197</sup></a> As a result, he finished four minutes behind <a href="Sebastian_Schnuelle" title="wikilink">Sebastian Schnuelle</a>, the winner.<a href="#fn198" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref198"><sup>198</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="junior-yukon-quest-and-yukon-quest-300">Junior Yukon Quest and Yukon Quest 300</h2>
<p>In addition to the main 1,000-mile sled dog race, the Yukon Quest organization operates two shorter races: the Junior Yukon Quest and the Yukon Quest 300.<a href="#fn199" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref199"><sup>199</sup></a> The two began in 2000, though in its first three years the Quest 300 was only 250 miles and thus known as the Quest 250.<a href="#fn200" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref200"><sup>200</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="junior-yukon-quest">Junior Yukon Quest</h3>
<p>The Junior Yukon Quest, or Junior Quest, is a 135-mile (217 km) race for mushers older than 14 but under 18.<a href="#fn201" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref201"><sup>201</sup></a> Unlike the Yukon Quest, the Junior Quest does not change locations and always starts and ends in Fairbanks.<a href="#fn202" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref202"><sup>202</sup></a> It is billed as an opportunity for young racers to experience a mid-distance sled dog race. They must plan a food drop, camp away from checkpoints, and carry much of the same equipment as mushers in the Yukon Quest and Yukon Quest 300.<a href="#fn203" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref203"><sup>203</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="yukon-quest-300">Yukon Quest 300</h3>
<p>The Yukon Quest 300 is a 300-mile (483 km) race along the regular Yukon Quest trail. It alternates starting locations along with the main race and is intended for less-experienced mushers training for longer races. The race is also a qualifier for the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race and the following year's Yukon Quest. Several mushers, including <a href="Fort_Yukon,_Alaska" title="wikilink">Fort Yukon</a> <a href="Alaska_Native" title="wikilink">Native</a> Josh Cadzow, have used the race as a trial before entering the longer races.<a href="#fn204" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref204"><sup>204</sup></a><a href="#fn205" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref205"><sup>205</sup></a></p>
<p>In 2009, the race was capped at 25 entries.<a href="#fn206" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref206"><sup>206</sup></a> When the Quest 300 starts in Whitehorse, its course follows the main Yukon Quest trail until the Stepping Stone hospitality stop. From there, it turns southwest, ending in Minto Landing, Yukon.<a href="#fn207" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref207"><sup>207</sup></a> The Fairbanks route follows the main trail to Circle, then reverses course, ending in Central.<a href="#fn208" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref208"><sup>208</sup></a></p>
