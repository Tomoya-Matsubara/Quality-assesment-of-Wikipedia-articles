<p><strong>Richard Hakluyt</strong> (, , or )<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> (c. 1552 or 1553 &lt;U+2013&gt; 23 November 1616) was an English writer. He is principally remembered for his efforts in promoting and supporting the settlement of North America by the <a href="English_people" title="wikilink">English</a> through his works, notably <em>Divers Voyages Touching the Discoverie of America</em> (1582) and <em>The Principal Navigations, Voiages, Traffiques and Discoueries of the English Nation</em> (1598&lt;U+2013&gt;1600).</p>
<p>Educated at <a href="Westminster_School" title="wikilink">Westminster School</a> and <a href="Christ_Church,_Oxford" title="wikilink">Christ Church, Oxford</a>, between 1583 and 1588 Hakluyt was <a href="chaplain" class="uri" title="wikilink">chaplain</a> and <a href="secretary#Origins" title="wikilink">secretary</a> to Sir <a href="Edward_Stafford_of_Grafton" title="wikilink">Edward Stafford</a>, English <a href="ambassador" class="uri" title="wikilink">ambassador</a> at the French court.

<p>Richard Hakluyt, the second of four sons, was born in either <a href="Hereford" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hereford</a> in the <a href="Counties_of_England" title="wikilink">county</a> of <a href="Herefordshire" class="uri" title="wikilink">Herefordshire</a> around 1552,<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> or in or near <a href="London" class="uri" title="wikilink">London</a> around 1553.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a><a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> Hakluyt's father, also named Richard Hakluyt, was a member of the <a href="Worshipful_Company_of_Skinners" title="wikilink">Worshipful Company of Skinners</a> whose members dealt in skins and furs. He died in 1557 when his son was aged about five years, and his wife Margery<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> followed soon after. Hakluyt's cousin, also named Richard Hakluyt, of the <a href="Middle_Temple" title="wikilink">Middle Temple</a>, became his <a href="Legal_guardian" title="wikilink">guardian</a>.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<p>While a Queen's Scholar at <a href="Westminster_School" title="wikilink">Westminster School</a>, Hakluyt visited his guardian, whose conversation, illustrated by &quot;certain bookes of cosmographie, an universall mappe, and the Bible&quot;, made Hakluyt resolve to &quot;prosecute that knowledge, and kind of literature&quot;.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> Entering <a href="Christ_Church,_Oxford" title="wikilink">Christ Church, Oxford</a>,<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> in 1570 with financial support from the Skinners' Company,<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> &quot;his exercises of duty first performed&quot;,<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> he set out to read all the printed or written voyages and discoveries that he could find. He took his <a href="Bachelor_of_Arts" title="wikilink">Bachelor of Arts</a> (B.A.) on 19 February 1574, and shortly after taking his <a href="Master_of_Arts_(Oxford,_Cambridge_and_Dublin)" title="wikilink">Master of Arts</a> (M.A.) on 27 June 1577,<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a><a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> began giving public lectures in <a href="geography" class="uri" title="wikilink">geography</a>.

<p>Hakluyt was <a href="ordination" title="wikilink">ordained</a> in 1578, and that same year he received a &quot;pension&quot; from the <a href="Worshipful_Company_of_Clothworkers" title="wikilink">Worshipful Company of Clothworkers</a> to study <a href="divinity_(academic_discipline)" title="wikilink">divinity</a>.

<p>According to one source,<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> Hakluyt's first publication was <em>A Shorte and Briefe Narration of the Two Nauigations and Discoueries to the Northwest Partes Called Newe Fraunce</em> (1580), a translation of <em>Bref R&lt;U+00E9&gt;cit et Succincte Narration de la Navigation Faite en MDXXXV et MDXXXVI</em><a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> by <a href="French_people" title="wikilink">French</a> <a href="navigator" class="uri" title="wikilink">navigator</a> <a href="Jacques_Cartier" title="wikilink">Jacques Cartier</a>, which was a description of his second voyage to Canada in 1535&lt;U+2013&gt;1536. However, this seems to be an error as the <a href="British_Library" title="wikilink">British Library</a>'s copy of this work indicates it was translated from an Italian version into English by <a href="John_Florio" title="wikilink">John Florio</a>.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> If that is correct, then Hakluyt's first publication was one that he wrote himself, <em>Divers Voyages Touching the Discoverie of America and the Ilands Adjacent unto the Same, Made First of all by our Englishmen and Afterwards by the Frenchmen and Britons</em> (1582).</p>
<p>Hakluyt's <em>Voyages</em> brought him to the notice of <a href="William_Howard,_1st_Baron_Howard_of_Effingham" title="wikilink">Lord Howard of Effingham</a>, and Sir <a href="Edward_Stafford_of_Grafton" title="wikilink">Edward Stafford</a>, Lord Howard's brother-in-law.

In accordance with the instructions of Secretary <a href="Francis_Walsingham" title="wikilink">Francis Walsingham</a>, he occupied himself chiefly in collecting information of the Spanish and French movements, and &quot;making diligent inquirie of such things as might yield any light unto our westerne discoverie in America&quot;.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> Although this was his only visit to the <a href="Mainland_Europe" title="wikilink">Continent</a> in his life, he was angered to hear the limitations of the English in terms of travel being discussed in Paris.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a></p>
<p>The first-fruits of Hakluyt's labours in Paris were embodied in his important work entitled <em>A Particuler Discourse Concerninge the Greate Necessitie and Manifolde Commodyties That Are Like to Growe to This Realme of Englande by the Westerne Discoueries Lately Attempted, Written in the Yere 1584</em>, which <a href="Walter_Raleigh" title="wikilink">Sir Walter Raleigh</a> commissioned him to prepare. The manuscript, lost for almost 300 years, was published for the first time in 1877. Hakluyt revisited England in 1584, and laid a copy of the <em>Discourse</em> before <a href="Elizabeth_I_of_England" title="wikilink">Elizabeth I</a> (to whom it had been dedicated) together with his analysis in <a href="Latin" class="uri" title="wikilink">Latin</a> of <a href="Aristotle" class="uri" title="wikilink">Aristotle</a>'s <em><a href="Politics_(Aristotle)" title="wikilink">Politicks</a></em>. His objective was to recommend the enterprise of planting the English race in the unsettled parts of North America, and thus gain the Queen's support for <a href="Walter_Raleigh#The_New_World" title="wikilink">Raleigh's expedition</a>.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> In May 1585 when Hakluyt was in Paris with the English Embassy, the Queen granted to him the next <a href="prebendal_stall" title="wikilink">prebendal stall</a> at <a href="Bristol_Cathedral" title="wikilink">Bristol Cathedral</a> that should become vacant,<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a><a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> to which he was admitted in 1585 or 1586 and held with other preferments till his death.</p>
<p>Hakluyt's other works during his time in Paris consisted mainly of <a href="translation" title="wikilink">translations</a> and compilations, with his own <a href="dedication#Book_dedications" title="wikilink">dedications</a> and <a href="preface" title="wikilink">prefaces</a>. These latter writings, together with a few letters, are the only extant material out of which a <a href="biography" class="uri" title="wikilink">biography</a> of him can be framed. Hakluyt interested himself in the publication of the <a href="manuscript" class="uri" title="wikilink">manuscript</a> journal of <a href="Ren&lt;U+00E9&gt;_de_Laudonni&lt;U+00E8&gt;re" title="wikilink">Ren&lt;U+00E9&gt; de Laudonni&lt;U+00E8&gt;re</a>, the <em>Histoire Notable de la Florida</em> in Paris in 1586.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> The attention that the book excited in Paris encouraged Hakluyt to prepare an English translation and publish it in London under the title <em>A Notable Historie Containing Foure Voyages Made by Certayne French Captaynes unto Florida</em> (1587). The same year, his edition of <a href="Peter_Martyr_d&#39;Anghiera" title="wikilink">Peter Martyr d'Anghiera</a>'s <em>De Orbe Nouo Decades Octo</em> saw the light at Paris.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> This work contains an exceedingly-rare <a href="copperplate" class="uri" title="wikilink">copperplate</a> map dedicated to Hakluyt and signed F.G.

<p>In 1588 Hakluyt finally returned to England with <a href="Douglas_Sheffield,_Baroness_Sheffield" title="wikilink">Lady Stafford</a>, after a residence in France of nearly five years. In 1589 he published the first edition of his chief work, <em>The Principall Navigations, Voiages and Discoveries of the English Nation</em>, using eyewitness accounts as far as possible. In the preface to this he announced the intended publication of the first <a href="globe#Terrestrial_and_planetary_globes" title="wikilink">terrestrial globe</a> made in England by <a href="Emery_Molyneux" title="wikilink">Emery Molyneux</a>. Between 1598 and 1600 appeared the final, reconstructed and greatly-enlarged edition of <em>The Principal Navigations, Voiages, Traffiques and Discoueries of the English Nation</em> in three volumes. In the dedication of the second volume (1599) to his patron, <a href="Robert_Cecil,_1st_Earl_of_Salisbury" title="wikilink">Sir Robert Cecil</a>, he strongly urged the minister as to the expediency of colonizing Virginia.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> A few copies of this monumental work contain a map of great rarity, the first on the <a href="Mercator_projection" title="wikilink">Mercator projection</a> made in England according to the true principles laid down by <a href="Edward_Wright_(mathematician)" title="wikilink">Edward Wright</a>.

He held this position until his death, and resided in Wetheringsett through the 1590s and frequently thereafter.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> In 1601 Hakluyt edited a translation from the <a href="Portuguese_language" title="wikilink">Portuguese</a> of Antonio Galv&lt;U+00E3&gt;o's <em>The Discoveries of the World</em>.

<p>In the late 1590s Hakluyt became the client and personal chaplain of <a href="Robert_Cecil,_1st_Earl_of_Salisbury" title="wikilink">Sir Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury</a>, Lord Burghley's son, who was to be Hakluyt's most fruitful patron. Hakluyt dedicated to Cecil the second (1599) and third volumes (1600) of the expanded edition of <em>Principal Navigations</em> and also his edition of Galv&lt;U+00E3&gt;o's <em>Discoveries</em> (1601). Cecil, who was the principal <a href="Secretary_of_State_(England)" title="wikilink">Secretary of State</a> to Elizabeth I and <a href="James_I_of_England" title="wikilink">James I</a>, rewarded him by installing him as <a href="prebendary" class="uri" title="wikilink">prebendary</a> of <a href="Westminster_Abbey" title="wikilink">Westminster Abbey</a> on 4 May 1602.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a><a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> In the following year, he was elected <a href="archdeacon" class="uri" title="wikilink">archdeacon</a> of the Abbey.</p>
<p>Hakluyt was married twice, once in or about 1594<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> and again in 1604. In the licence of Hakluyt's second marriage dated 30 March 1604, he is described as one of the <a href="chaplain" title="wikilink">chaplains</a> of the <a href="Savoy_Palace" title="wikilink">Savoy Hospital</a>; this position was also conferred on him by Cecil. His <a href="Will_(law)" title="wikilink">will</a> refers to chambers occupied by him there up to the time of his death, and in another official document he is styled <a href="Doctor_of_Divinity" title="wikilink">Doctor of Divinity</a> (D.D.).<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a></p>

In 1606 he appears as the chief promoter of the petition to James I for <a href="letters_patent" title="wikilink">letters patent</a> to colonize Virginia, which were granted on 10 April 1606.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> His last publication was a translation of <a href="Hernando_de_Soto_(explorer)" title="wikilink">Hernando de Soto</a>'s discoveries in Florida, entitled <em>Virginia Richly Valued, by the Description of the Maine Land of Florida, Her Next Neighbour</em> (1609). This work was intended to encourage the young colony of Virginia; Scottish <a href="historian" class="uri" title="wikilink">historian</a> <a href="William_Robertson_(historian)" title="wikilink">William Robertson</a> wrote of Hakluyt, &quot;England is more indebted for its American possessions than to any man of that age.&quot;<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a></p>
<p>Hakluyt prepared an English translation of Dutch jurist <a href="Hugo_Grotius" title="wikilink">Hugo Grotius</a>' <em>Mare Liberum</em> (1609),<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> a treatise that sought to demonstrate that the Dutch had the right to trade freely in the <a href="Indies" class="uri" title="wikilink">Indies</a> contrary to Spanish and Portuguese claims of sovereignty over the seas,<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a> in the early 1600s.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a> Helen Thornton has suggested that the translation was commissioned by <a href="Thomas_Smythe" title="wikilink">Thomas Smythe</a> who became treasurer of the Virginia Company in 1609 and was also Governor of the East India Company. In that year, Hakluyt was a consultant to the Company when it was renewing its charter. Grotius' arguments supported England's right to trade in the Indies.<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a> The translation may also have been part of the propaganda encouraging English people to settle in Virginia. In <em>Mare Liberum</em>, Grotius denied that the 1493 donation by <a href="Pope_Alexander_VI" title="wikilink">Pope Alexander VI</a> that had divided the oceans between Spain and Portugal entitled Spain to make territorial claims to North America. Instead, he stressed the importance of occupation, which was favourable to the English as they and not the Spanish had occupied Virginia. Grotius also argued that the seas should be freely navigable by all, which was useful since the England to Virginia route crossed seas which the Portuguese claimed.<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a> However, it is not clear why Hakluyt's translation was not published in his lifetime. George Bruner Parks has theorized that publication at that time would have been inconvenient to England because after England had successfully helped Holland and Spain to negotiate the <a href="Twelve_Years&#39;_Truce" title="wikilink">Twelve Years' Truce</a> during the <a href="Eighty_Years&#39;_War" title="wikilink">Eighty Years' War</a>, the work would have supported English claims for free seas against Spain, but not its claims for closed seas against Holland.<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a><a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a> Hakluyt's handwritten manuscript, MS Petyt 529, in <a href="Inner_Temple_Library" title="wikilink">Inner Temple Library</a> in London was eventually published as <em><a href="The_Free_Sea" title="wikilink">The Free Sea</a></em> for the first time in 2004.<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1591, Hakluyt inherited family property upon the death of his elder brother Thomas; a year later, upon the death of his youngest brother Edmund, he inherited another property which derived from his uncle. In 1612 Hakluyt became a charter member of the North-west Passage Company.<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a> By the time of his death, he had amassed a small fortune out of his various <a href="remuneration" title="wikilink">emoluments</a> and <a href="wikt:preferment" title="wikilink">preferments</a>, of which the last was <a href="Gedney,_Lincolnshire" title="wikilink">Gedney</a> Rectory, <a href="Lincolnshire" class="uri" title="wikilink">Lincolnshire</a>, presented to him by his younger brother Oliver in 1612. Unfortunately, his wealth was squandered by his only son.<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a></p>
<p>Hakluyt died on 23 November 1616, probably in London, and was buried on 26 November in <a href="Westminster_Abbey" title="wikilink">Westminster Abbey</a>;<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a><a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a> by an error in the abbey register his burial is recorded under the year 1626.<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a> A number of his manuscripts, sufficient to form a fourth volume of his collections of 1598&lt;U+2013&gt;1600, fell into the hands of <a href="Samuel_Purchas" title="wikilink">Samuel Purchas</a>, who inserted them in an abridged form in his <em>Pilgrimes</em> (1625&lt;U+2013&gt;1626).<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a> Others, consisting chiefly of notes gathered from contemporary authors, are preserved at the <a href="University_of_Oxford" title="wikilink">University of Oxford</a>.<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a></p>
<p>Hakluyt is principally remembered for his efforts in promoting and supporting the settlement of North America by the English through his writings. These works were a fertile source of material for <a href="William_Shakespeare" title="wikilink">William Shakespeare</a><a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a> and other authors. Hakluyt also encouraged the production of geographical and historical writings by others. It was at Hakluyt's suggestion that Robert Parke translated Juan Gonzalez de Mendoza's <em>The History of the Great and Mighty Kingdom of China and the Situation Thereof</em> (1588&lt;U+2013&gt;1590),<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a> <a href="John_Pory" title="wikilink">John Pory</a> made his version of <a href="Leo_Africanus" title="wikilink">Leo Africanus</a>'s <em>A Geographical Historie of Africa</em> (1600),<a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a> and P. Erondelle translated <a href="Marc_Lescarbot" title="wikilink">Marc Lescarbot</a>'s <em>Nova Francia</em> (1609).<a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a></p>
<p>The <a href="Hakluyt_Society" title="wikilink">Hakluyt Society</a> was founded in 1846 for printing rare and unpublished accounts of voyages and travels, and continues to publish volumes each year.<a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a></p>
