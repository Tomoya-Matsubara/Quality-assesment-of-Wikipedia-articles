She is also one of the playable characters in <em><a href="Resident_Evil:_The_Mercenaries_3D" title="wikilink">Resident Evil: The Mercenaries 3D</a></em> (2011), an action game based on &quot;The Mercenaries&quot; <a href="minigame" class="uri" title="wikilink">minigame</a> from <em>Resident Evil 4</em> and <em>Resident Evil 5</em>.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>

Jill and her new partner, Parker Luciani, now out of contact and uninformed of the dire situation they face, find the ship infested with a new breed of leech-like zombies, infected with a new, stronger strain of the T-virus: the T-Abyss virus. Meanwhile, Chris and his new partner Jessica make their way to the ship to find Jill and some answers. Together, they slowly unravel a global conspiracy involving an earlier outbreak of the original strain of the T-virus at the city of Terragrigia, and a botched investigation by a rival agency, the Federal Bioterrorism Commission (FBC). During this mission Jill is exposed to the T-Abyss and receives an experimental vaccine.</p>
<p>Outside of the <em>Resident Evil</em> series, Jill appears as a player character in the crossover fighting game <em><a href="Marvel_vs._Capcom_2:_New_Age_of_Heroes" title="wikilink">Marvel vs. Capcom 2: New Age of Heroes</a></em> (2000), wearing her STARS uniform.

She also appears as a playable character in the crossover tactical role-playing game <em><a href="Project_X_Zone" title="wikilink">Project X Zone</a></em> (2012), wearing her costume from <em>Revelations</em>,<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> and in the browser-based social game <em><a href="Onimusha" class="uri" title="wikilink">Onimusha</a> Soul</em> (2013), where she was re-designed to fit the <a href="feudal_Japan" title="wikilink">feudal Japan</a> theme.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a></p>
<h4 id="design-and-portrayal">Design and portrayal</h4>
<p>During development of the original <em>Resident Evil</em>, Jill was conceived as physically weaker than the game's male protagonist Chris Redfield, but she was given more skills and weapons to compensate for this.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> The game's director <a href="Shinji_Mikami" title="wikilink">Shinji Mikami</a> said about Jill and <a href="Claire_Redfield" title="wikilink">Claire</a>: &quot;I don't know if I've put more emphasis on women characters, but when I do introduce them, it is never as objects. In some games, they will be peripheral characters with ridiculous breast physics. I avoid that sort of obvious eroticism. I also don't like female characters who are submissive to male characters, or to the situation they're in. I won't portray women in that way. I write women characters who discover their interdependence as the game progresses, or who already know they are independent but have that tested against a series of challenges.&quot;<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> The development team for <em>Resident Evil 3: Nemesis</em>, which was also overseen by Mikami, said Jill was deliberately designed to make her &quot;beautiful for everybody&quot; and appeal to both male and female gamers, as males would find her physically attractive and females would see her as a tough role model.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a></p>

<p>For the 2002 <a href="Resident_Evil_(2002_video_game)" title="wikilink">remake of <em>Resident Evil</em></a>, Capcom producer <a href="Hiroyuki_Kobayashi_(producer)" title="wikilink">Hiroyuki Kobayashi</a> said the team wanted Jill to be &quot;a little cuter&quot; so that &quot;her action and atmosphere has charm&quot;. Her facial and physical appearance from the remake onwards is based on Canadian model and actress <a href="Julia_Voth" title="wikilink">Julia Voth</a>, and her body was scanned into computers to make her look as much like Voth as possible. Character designer Kenichiro Yoshimura said that he &quot;made Jill's face as much similar as I could to the model actress face.&quot;<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> However, so that she remains a tough character, her body is designed to be &quot;not skinny, more like muscular&quot;.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a></p>

<p>On the subject of changes to Jill and Chris Redfield's appearance in <em>Resident Evil 5</em>, production director Yasuhiro Anpo said that he tried &quot;to preserve their image and imagined how they would have changed over the passage of time&quot; and so they &quot;made a new design that retained their signature color&lt;U+2014&gt;green for Chris, blue for Jill&lt;U+2014&gt;to carry over the same look from the past. The facial structures are mainly based on the visuals of the Nintendo GameCube version, and we added various details to these in order to develop a realistic structure.&quot;<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> Jill's character model was paler than usual in this entry to the series and her hair was blonde, both of which were explained in-universe as being due to a pigment abnormality sustained while her body was under experimentation. Capcom producer <a href="Jun_Takeuchi" title="wikilink">Jun Takeuchi</a> said Jill's <a href="Unlockable_(gaming)" title="wikilink">unlockable</a> &quot;classic look&quot; STARS uniform from the original game was his favorite extra costume in <em>Resident Evil 5</em>.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a></p>
<p>Jill was voiced by <a href="Catherine_Disher" title="wikilink">Catherine Disher</a> in <em>Resident Evil 3</em> and '' Marvel vs. Capcom 2''. Heidi Anderson voiced her in the 2002 GameCube remake of the first game. <a href="Patricia_Ja_Lee" title="wikilink">Patricia Ja Lee</a> provided the voice and motion capture in <em>The Umbrella Chronicles</em>, <em>Resident Evil 5</em> and all of its later released <a href="downloadable_content" title="wikilink">downloadable content</a> (DLC), and <em>Resident Evil: The Mercenaries 3D</em>. <a href="Kari_Wahlgren" title="wikilink">Kari Wahlgren</a> assumed the role in <em>Marvel vs. Capcom 3</em>; <a href="Michelle_Ruff" title="wikilink">Michelle Ruff</a> lent her voice to the character in <em>Resident Evil: Revelations</em> and <em>Resident Evil: Operation Raccoon City</em>. Ruff said about her role: &quot;Jills's voice says a lot about her personality. I kept her in my lower register. She's all business and not 'girly' at all. Almost military-ish.&quot;<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> </p>
<h4 id="gameplay">Gameplay</h4>
<p>Jill was one of the first two player characters in the <em>Resident Evil</em> series. In the original game, Jill plays very differently to Chris as she runs slower, can take less damage and is less accurate with firearms, but has two more inventory slots and an access to stronger weapons (including starting armed with a gun, while Chris begins with only a knife). She also carries a <a href="lock_picking" title="wikilink">lockpick</a> capable of opening many doors and caches, knows how to play <a href="piano" class="uri" title="wikilink">piano</a> (which is useful in-game), and is aided by the overprotective Barry.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> In the game's 2002 remake, she has a <a href="taser" class="uri" title="wikilink">taser</a> as her personal defensive weapon.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> In <em>Resident Evil 3: Nemesis</em>, Jill will enter the &quot;Live Selection Mode&quot; during certain sections of the game, in which the player is prompted to quickly choose between one of two possible actions (the choice of action affects the direction of the game and story, including which ending the player receives). It was also during this game that Jill became the first character to be able to perform a quick 180-degree turn, which has since become a staple of the series.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a></p>
<p>In <em>Marvel vs. Capcom 2</em>, Jill is a very fast and agile character that is able to summon monsters to attack her opponent.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> She can also heal the player's active character if she is summoned as a support character. In <em>Marvel vs. Capcom 3</em>, Jill is available as a DLC character,<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> and was given a complete overhaul, with her appearance and move-set being based on her <em>Resident Evil 5</em> incarnation and using Wesker-like teleportation moves.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a></p>

<p>One of the celebrated aspects of Jill's role in the series has been her ongoing partnership with Chris Redfield.

<p>Jill has been often regarded as one of most attractive female characters in video games by various publications.
