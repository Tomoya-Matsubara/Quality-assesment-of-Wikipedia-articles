<p><strong>King's Highway 417</strong>, commonly referred to as <strong>Highway 417</strong> and the <strong>Queensway</strong> through Ottawa, is a <a href="400-series_highway" title="wikilink">400-series highway</a> in the <a href="Canada" title="wikilink">Canadian</a> province of <a href="Ontario" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ontario</a>. It connects <a href="Montreal" class="uri" title="wikilink">Montreal</a> (via <a href="Quebec_Autoroute_40" title="wikilink">A40</a>) with <a href="Ottawa" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ottawa</a>, and is the backbone of the transportation system in the <a href="National_Capital_Region_(Canada)" title="wikilink">National Capital Region</a>. Within Ottawa, it forms part of the Queensway (along with <a href="Regional_Road_174" title="wikilink">Ottawa Road 174</a> east to Trim Road) west to <a href="Ontario_Highway_7" title="wikilink">Highway 7</a>. Highway 417 extends from the <a href="Quebec" class="uri" title="wikilink">Quebec</a> border (near <a href="Hawkesbury,_Ontario" title="wikilink">Hawkesbury</a>) to <a href="Arnprior,_Ontario" title="wikilink">Arnprior</a>, where it continues westward as <a href="Ontario_Highway_17" title="wikilink">Highway 17</a>. Aside from the urban section through Ottawa, Highway 417 passes through farmland that dominates much of the fertile <a href="Ottawa_Valley" title="wikilink">Ottawa Valley</a>.</p>
<p>Within Ottawa, the Queensway was built as part of a <a href="Greber_Plan" title="wikilink">grand plan for the city</a> between 1957 and 1966, and later reconstructed to its present form throughout the 1980s. The eastern section, from <a href="Gloucester,_Ontario" title="wikilink">Gloucester</a> to the Quebec border, opened in 1975 in preparation for the <a href="1976_Montreal_Olympics" title="wikilink">1976 Montreal Olympics</a>. Sections west of Ottawa have been under construction since the mid-1970s, with the latest section to Arnprior opening in 2005. As of 2012, the Arnprior Bypass is being <a href="twinning_(roads)" title="wikilink">twinned</a> as far west as Campbell Drive and is scheduled for completion by the end of the year.</p>
<h2 id="route-description">Route description</h2>
<p>Highway 417 is a  <a href="controlled-access_highway" title="wikilink">controlled-access highway</a> that traverses the lower <a href="Ottawa_Valley" title="wikilink">Ottawa Valley</a> and upper <a href="St._Lawrence_Valley" title="wikilink">St. Lawrence Valley</a>, bypassing the generally two-lane Highway 17 and providing a high-speed connection between Montreal and Ottawa via A-40. The freeway has also gradually been extended northwest from Ottawa alongside the old highway to its current terminus in Arnprior. Highway 417 currently has 42 interchanges from the Quebec border to Arnprior, with more planned as the highway is extended westward. Unlike other highways in Ontario and most of North America, exits are numbered from east to west.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>While a significant portion of Highway 417 is a rural four lane freeway divided by a <a href="central_reservation" title="wikilink">grass median</a>, the section within urban Ottawa is a busy commuter route as wide as eight lanes. The portion of the route from the <a href="Ontario_Highway_7" title="wikilink">Highway 7</a> interchange east to <em>the Split</em> &lt;U+2013&gt; a large four-way interchange between Highway 417, <a href="Ottawa_Regional_Road_174" title="wikilink">Ottawa Regional Road 174</a> and the <a href="Aviation_Parkway_(Ottawa)" title="wikilink">Aviation Parkway</a> &lt;U+2013&gt; is known formally as the <em>Queensway</em>, although no indication of this name appears on any signage.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>

<p><img src="Welcome_to_Ontario.jpg" title="fig:Autoroute 40 becomes Highway 417 at the Ontario border; both form part of the Trans-Canada Highway." alt="Autoroute 40 becomes Highway 417 at the Ontario border; both form part of the Trans-Canada Highway." /> Highway 417 begins at the border between the provinces of Ontario and Quebec, east of which the four lane freeway continues as Autoroute 40. The route proceeds west along the former <a href="right-of-way_(transportation)" title="wikilink">alignment</a> of Highway 17, which it has served to replace. It passes through a forested and agricultural landscape en route to Ottawa, serving the communities of <a href="Hawkesbury,_Ontario" title="wikilink">Hawkesbury</a>, <a href="Vankleek_Hill" title="wikilink">Vankleek Hill</a>, <a href="Casselman,_Ontario" title="wikilink">Casselman</a>, <a href="Limoges,_Ontario" title="wikilink">Limoges</a> and <a href="Vars,_Ontario" title="wikilink">Vars</a>. After approximately  the route curves southwest while ramps provide access from the westbound lanes to <a href="Prescott_and_Russell_County_Road_17" title="wikilink">Prescott and Russell County Road 17</a> and from County Road 17 to the eastbound lanes of Highway 417. The route later meets the southern terminus of <a href="Ontario_Highway_34" title="wikilink">Highway 34</a> at Exit 27. Continuing southwest, the route meanders along the boundary between <a href="The_Nation" title="wikilink">The Nation</a> and <a href="North_Glengarry" title="wikilink">North Glengarry</a>, eventually encountering the northern terminus of <a href="Ontario_Highway_138" title="wikilink">Highway 138</a>&lt;U+2014&gt;a highway built to connect Highway 417 with <a href="Highway&amp;nbsp;401" class="uri" title="wikilink">Highway&amp;nbsp;401</a> and <a href="Cornwall,_Ontario" title="wikilink">Cornwall</a><a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a>&lt;U+2014&gt;east of Casselman. At this point, the freeway enters The Nation and diverges from the boundary.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>After crossing a <a href="Via_Rail" title="wikilink">Via Rail</a> line, the route dips south of Casselman and curves to the west at Exit 66 (County Road 7). It roughly parallels the Via Rail line several kilometres north of the freeway, though significant deviations bypass the communities of <a href="Benoit,_Ontario" title="wikilink">Benoit</a> and Limoges; the latter is served by Exit 79 (County Road 5).<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> Near Limoges is the <a href="Larosse_Forest" title="wikilink">Larosse Forest</a>, a man-made forest planted between 1928 and 1980 over the Bourget Desert, itself created as the result of clear cutting in the 19th century.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> At Exit 88, Highway 417 enters the city of <a href="Ottawa" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ottawa</a>,<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> though the surroundings remain unchanged until Exit 110 (Walkley Road), near Ramsayville.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p>North of Ramsayville, the route jogs abruptly to the west as it crosses Greens Creek and enters the suburbs of Ottawa; an interchange with Innes Road divides the countryside to the south and east from the city to the north and west.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> The freeway merges with the Queensway at a large multi-level interchange known locally as the Split, curving to the west and into downtown Ottawa. The interchange also provides access to Aviation Parkway from westbound Highway 417 and from the parkway to eastbound Highway 417.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>

<p><img src="Highway_416_near_Highway_417.jpg" title="fig:Highway 417 facing east at the Split" alt="Highway 417 facing east at the Split" /> Within Ottawa, the Queensway extends from Orleans in the east and passes just south of downtown through central Ottawa to Kanata in the west. Two major interchanges anchor either end of this section: in the east, Highway 417 diverges south towards Montreal at <em>The Split</em>, while the Queensway continues east as <a href="Ottawa_Regional_Road_174" title="wikilink">Regional Road 174</a> and <a href="Aviation_Parkway_(Ottawa)" title="wikilink">Aviation Parkway</a> branches north; in the west, <a href="Ontario_Highway_416" title="wikilink">Highway 416</a> travels south to <a href="Ontario_Highway_401" title="wikilink">Highway 401</a>. The core section of the Queensway is eight lanes wide, four per carriageway.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<p>The freeway is elevated on a <a href="berm" class="uri" title="wikilink">berm</a> along some central portions of the route, providing views of downtown and the <a href="Gatineau_Hills" title="wikilink">Gatineau Hills</a> to the north. This section was constructed along a former <a href="Canadian_National_Railway" title="wikilink">Canadian National Railway</a> railbed.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> The route bisects central Ottawa with downtown and the Parliament Buildings lay to the north of the highway and residential neighbourhoods including the Glebe to the south.

<p>West of the interchange with Highway 416, the freeway enters the suburb of <a href="Kanata" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kanata</a> &lt;U+2014&gt; an independent city until the formation of the new City of Ottawa in 2001<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> &lt;U+2014&gt; and travels through it in an east&lt;U+2013&gt;west direction.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> At Exit 145, the route encounters the eastern terminus of Highway 7, which travels southwest to <a href="Peterborough" class="uri" title="wikilink">Peterborough</a> and the GTA and provides an alternative route to Highway 401 via Highway 416. Highway 417 makes a broad 90-degree curve to the north to meet with the midpoint of the Carp Bypass at the former <a href="Ontario_Highway_44" title="wikilink">Highway 44</a> (now Ottawa Regional Road 49).<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a></p>
<p>The Carp Bypass was built in the mid-1960s as a bypass of the existing Highway 17, which meandered through the communities of <a href="Carp,_Ontario" title="wikilink">Carp</a>, <a href="Kinburn,_Ottawa,_Ontario" title="wikilink">Kinburn</a> and <a href="Antrim,_Ontario" title="wikilink">Antrim</a>; the former highway is now Donald B.

North of Antrim, Highway 417 travels in a straight line parallel to old Highway 17 as far as Arnprior, where it curves to bypass south of that town. The divided freeway ends immediately east of the Madawaska River, west of an interchange with Renfrew County Road 29.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> Twinning is underway for several kilometres northeast of this point, but not yet open to traffic.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a></p>

<p><img src="417_Alta_Vista_overpass_1961.png" title="fig:The Queensway facing west from Alta Vista Drive in 1961" alt="The Queensway facing west from Alta Vista Drive in 1961" /> Highway 417 was initially constructed as a connection between the existing Queensway and <a href="Quebec_Autoroute_40" title="wikilink">Autoroute 40</a> in Quebec,<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> the latter being constructed in advance of <a href="Expo_1967" title="wikilink">Expo 1967</a> and opening December 17, 1966.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a><a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> However, the designation has since been applied to the Queensway west of the interchange between the two freeways.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a></p>
<p>Construction of the Queensway was driven by the <a href="Greber_Plan" title="wikilink">Greber Plan</a>, which was produced by <a href="Jacques_Gr&lt;U+00E9&gt;ber" title="wikilink">Jacques Gr&lt;U+00E9&gt;ber</a> under the direction of Prime Minister <a href="William_Lyon_Mackenzie_King" title="wikilink">William Mackenzie</a> in the late 1940s. Although Gr&lt;U+00E9&gt;ber had been corresponding with King as early as 1936, <a href="World_War_II" title="wikilink">World War II</a> halted any plans from reaching fruition at that time. Following the war, Gr&lt;U+00E9&gt;ber was again contacted and his expertise requested. He arrived on October 2, 1945 and began working almost immediately.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> The Greber Plan, as it came to be known, was released in 1950 and presented to the House of Commons on May 22, 1951.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> The plan called for the complete reorganization of Ottawa's road and rail network, and included amongst the numerous <a href="parkways" class="uri" title="wikilink">parkways</a> was a east to west expressway along what was then a <a href="Canadian_National_Railway" title="wikilink">Canadian National Railway</a> line.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a><a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a></p>
<p>With the rail lines removed, construction of the new expressway got underway in 1957 when <a href="Elizabeth_II" title="wikilink">Queen Elizabeth</a> visited Ottawa to open the first session of the 23rd Parliament. On October 15, the Queen detonated dynamite charges from the Hurdman Bridge, which now overlooks the highway as it crosses the Rideau River, and formally dedicated the new project as the Queensway. At the ceremony, premier <a href="Leslie_Frost" title="wikilink">Leslie Frost</a> indicated that the entire project would cost C$31 million and emphasized the importance of the link to the Trans-Canada Highway.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a><a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a></p>

The central section presented the greatest challenge, as an embankment was built to create <a href="grade-separated" title="wikilink">grade-separations</a>. In addition, the structures over the Rideau Canal and river required several years of construction. On May 15, 1964, the majority of the third phase was ceremonially opened.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> completing the Carling Avenue interchange and extending the freeway as far as Bronson Avenue.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> Several months later, on September 17 the short but complicated section east to O'Connor Street was opened.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> This left only phase four, the central section of the Queensway, which was opened in three segments. On November 26, 1965, the structures over the Rideau Canal were opened to traffic. At the same time, the westbound lanes of the Queensway were extended to Concord Street, located west of the Nicholas Street interchange.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> The interchange opened on January 1, 1966, allowing travel in both directions over the canal.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> The final segment, linking the two section of the Queensway, was placed into service on October 28, 1966.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> Following this, the Highway 17 designation was applied along the Queensway and the old routing renumbered as Highway 17B.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="new-freeway">New freeway</h3>
<p>Planning was underway on a new freeway, Highway 417, that would run east of Ottawa from the Queensway, connecting with <a href="Quebec_Autoroute_40" title="wikilink">A-40</a> to provide a high-speed route to Montreal. Highway 17, closely following the shore of the Ottawa River as it meanders towards <a href="Pointe-Fortune,_Ontario" title="wikilink">Pointe-Fortune</a>, was dangerous, narrow, and accident prone, earning it the nickname of &quot;the killer strip&quot;.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> The awarding of the <a href="1976_Summer_Olympics" title="wikilink">1976 Summer Olympics</a> to Montreal on May 12, 1970<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> resulted in an accelerated construction schedule due to the anticipated high volume of traffic that would be travelling the corridor between Ottawa and Montreal during the games. Contracts to construct the new route were opened to bidding on November 15, 1968; construction began in May 1969 starting at Base Line Road (now Ramsayville Road) and proceeding easterly.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a><a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a></p>
<p>The new freeway was built under a continuous construction program over the following 6 years, opening progressively as each segment of roadway was completed. The first  segment, from Ramsayville Road to Rockdale Road, near Vars, opened on September 21, 1972. By the end of that month, the easternmost  of Highway 17 had been converted into a divided freeway,<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> and construction was progressing on the remainder of the route.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a> On October 1, 1973, a  section of freeway opened between Vars and Limoges.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a> On July 15, 1974, Minister of Transportation and Communications <a href="John_Reginald_Rhodes" title="wikilink">John Rhodes</a> ceremonially opened the next section of Highway 417, between Limoges Road and Highland Road.<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a> The section between Highland Road and Highway 17 opened on November 8, 1974, connecting with the existing section leading from the Quebec border.<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a> The final segment of the new route, connecting the section east of Ramsayville with the Queensway, was opened to traffic on December 2, 1975.

<h3 id="extensions-and-expansions">Extensions and expansions</h3>
<p>Meanwhile, to the west of Ottawa, planning got underway on a continuation of the Queensway.<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a> This extension was designed to connect with the Carp Bypass &lt;U+2013&gt; a portion of Highway 17 designed to <a href="bypass_(road)" title="wikilink">bypass</a> the old meandering route (now known as Donald B. Munro Drive) through <a href="Carp,_Ontario" title="wikilink">Carp</a>, <a href="Marathon,_Ontario" title="wikilink">Marathon</a> and <a href="Antrim,_Ontario" title="wikilink">Antrim</a> that opened November 9, 1965<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a> &lt;U+2013&gt; with an interchange and connection to Highway 7. Prior to the completion of this section of freeway, Highway 17 followed Carling Avenue and March Road from Ottawa to west of Carp. Construction began in the west end of Ottawa in 1967. By 1970, a short extension to Moodie Drive was completed, including the realignment of that road for continuity north and south of Highway 417.<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a><a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a> The following year, the freeway was extended to March Road.<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a> Construction halted at the eastern edge of Kanata for several years while a study was conducted into the merits of building the highway in a trench through the established city. During this time, construction began in 1974 on the future Queensway and Highway 7 interchange. Work also began on the two lane connections to Highway 7 as well as to the Highway 17 and <a href="Ontario_Highway_44" title="wikilink">Highway 44</a> junction west of Carp at the same time.<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a></p>
<p><img src="OntHwy417Ottawa.svg" title="fig:Map of Highway 417 through Ottawa" alt="Map of Highway 417 through Ottawa" /> Upon the completion of the Ottawa&lt;U+2013&gt;Quebec section of freeway, the Queensway was designated as Highway 417 west of The Split.<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a> With the completion of the Kanata study during early 1976, work began to build the route through the city-centre in a depressed-grade; as a result all the crossings though that section pass over the freeway. By early 1978, the western extension was opened to traffic, providing four lanes between Richmond Road and Highway 7 / 417. The two legs beyond the interchange were initially constructed as two-lane undivided roads, and remained as such for over a decade.<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a></p>
<p>Throughout the 1980s, work on Highway 417 shifted from extensions to expansions. Within Ottawa, the initially four lane route, separated by a wide grass median, was expanded to eight lanes with paved shoulders and centre-mounted lighting beginning in 1982.<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a> To reduce weaving, the exit at Kent Street was removed during this work. Expansion of the two lane Highway 17 west of the interchange with Highway 7 got underway in 1991; this section was renumbered as Highway 417 as construction progressed westward. The construction saw a second two lane roadway built parallel to the existing route to create a divided freeway, a process known as <a href="twinning_(roads)" title="wikilink">twinning</a>.<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a></p>
<p>When the twinning of Highway 17 reached March Road, new contracts were tendered to continue the process northward.

<p>Construction is currently underway to twin the Arnprior Bypass portion of Highway 17, which will include a new interchange at White Lake Road. The major structure in this project was a second crossing of the Madawaska River. Work began during the spring of 2009<a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a> and is tentatively scheduled to be completed by the end of 2012,<a href="#fn69" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref69"><sup>69</sup></a> with a projected cost of $70 million.<a href="#fn70" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a> The Arnprior Bypass was completed in 1981 as one of a number of upgrades to Highway 17 between Ottawa and North Bay. It was intended for directing through traffic around downtown Arnprior and was designed for an eventual upgrade to a divided freeway.<a href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a></p>
<p>The MTO plans to further extend Highway 417 westerly through the Ottawa Valley by twinning and realigning the existing route to a four-lane freeway beyond Arnprior, where it presently merges into a two-laned Highway 17.<a href="#fn72" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref72"><sup>72</sup></a> No immediate construction timelines have been announced,<a href="#fn73" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref73"><sup>73</sup></a> but route planning has been completed to <a href="Pembroke,_Ontario" title="wikilink">Pembroke</a>, with a bypass to the east of the <a href="Cobden,_Ontario" title="wikilink">Cobden</a> area. Planning and construction efforts to upgrade Highway 17 through Sudbury and east of North Bay have prompted speculation that Highway 417 will continue to be extended west through Northern Ontario.<a href="#fn74" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref74"><sup>74</sup></a><a href="#fn75" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref75"><sup>75</sup></a> </p>
