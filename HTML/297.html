<p>Pashtuns are also historically referred to as ethnic <a href="Afghans" class="uri" title="wikilink">Afghans</a> as the terms Pashtun and Afghan were synonymous until the advent of modern Afghanistan and the division of the Pashtuns by the <a href="Durand_Line" title="wikilink">Durand Line</a>, a border drawn by the British in the late 19th century.

Many Pashtuns have intermingled with various invaders, neighboring groups, and migrants (as have the other Iranian peoples).

For example, according to the <em><a href="Encyclopaedia_of_Islam" title="wikilink">Encyclopaedia of Islam</a></em>, the <a href="Theory_of_Pashtun_descent_from_Israelites" title="wikilink">Theory of Pashtun descent from Israelites</a> is traced to <em>Maghzan-e-Afghani</em> who compiled a history for <em>Khan-e-Jehan Lodhi</em> in the reign of <a href="Mughal" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mughal</a> Emperor <a href="Jehangir" class="uri" title="wikilink">Jehangir</a> in the <a href="17th_century" title="wikilink">seventeenth century</a> CE. Another book, that corresponds with Pashtun historical records, <em>Taaqati-Nasiri</em>, states that in the seventh century a people called the <a href="Children_of_Israel" title="wikilink">Bani Israel</a> settled in <a href="Ghor" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ghor</a>, southeast of <a href="Herat" class="uri" title="wikilink">Herat</a>, Afghanistan and then migrated south and east. These Bani Israel references are in line with the commonly held view by Pashtuns that when the twelve tribes of <a href="Israelite" title="wikilink">Israel</a> were dispersed (see <a href="Israel_and_Judah" title="wikilink">Israel and Judah</a> and <a href="Lost_Ten_Tribes" title="wikilink">Lost Ten Tribes</a>), the tribe of <a href="Tribe_of_Joseph" title="wikilink">Joseph</a>, among other Hebrew tribes, settled in the region.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> Hence the tribal name '<a href="Yousafzai" title="wikilink">Yusef Zai</a>' in Pashto translates to the 'sons of Joseph'.

<p>Maghzan-e-Afghani's Bani-Israel theory has largely been debunked due to historical and linguistic inconsistencies. The oral tradition is believed to be a myth that grew out of a political and cultural struggle between Pashtuns and the <a href="Mughal_Empire" title="wikilink">Mughals</a>, which explains the historical backdrop for the creation of the myth, the inconsistencies of the mythology, and the linguistic research that refutes any <a href="Semitic" class="uri" title="wikilink">Semitic</a> origins.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a></p>
<p>Other Pashtun tribes claim descent from <a href="Arabs" class="uri" title="wikilink">Arabs</a> including some even claiming to be descendants of the Muslim Prophet <a href="Muhammad" class="uri" title="wikilink">Muhammad</a> (popularly referred to as <a href="sayyid" title="wikilink">sayyids</a>).<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> Some groups from <a href="Peshawar" class="uri" title="wikilink">Peshawar</a> and <a href="Kandahar" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kandahar</a> (such as the <a href="Afridis" class="uri" title="wikilink">Afridis</a>, <a href="Khattak" title="wikilink">Khattaks</a> and <a href="Sadozai" title="wikilink">Sadozais</a>) also claim to be descended from <a href="Alexander_the_Great" title="wikilink">Alexander the Great</a>'s Greeks.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a></p>

The most prominent views are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pashtuns are predominantly an <a href="Iranian_people" title="wikilink">Eastern Iranian people</a> who are speakers of the <a href="Pashto" class="uri" title="wikilink">Pashto</a> language and live in a contiguous geographic location across Pakistan and Afghanistan.

<li>In accordance with the legend of <a href="Qais_Abdur_Rashid" title="wikilink">Qais Abdur Rashid</a>, the figure traditionally regarded as progenitor of the Pashtun people, Pashtuns are those whose related patrilineal descent may be traced back to legendary times.</li>
</ul>
<p>These three definitions may be described as the ethno-linguistic definition, the religious-cultural definition, and the patrilineal definition, respectively.</p>
<h3 id="ethnic-definition">Ethnic definition</h3>
<p>The ethno-linguistic definition is the most prominent and accepted view as to who is and is not a Pashtun.<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> Generally, this most common view holds that Pashtuns are defined within the parameters of having mainly eastern Iranian ethnic origins, sharing a common language, culture and history, living in relatively close geographic proximity to each other, and acknowledging each other as kinsmen. Thus, tribes that speak disparate yet mutually intelligible dialects of Pashto will acknowledge each other as ethnic Pashtuns and even subscribe to certain dialects as &quot;proper&quot;, such as the Pukhtu spoken by the <a href="Yousafzai" class="uri" title="wikilink">Yousafzai</a> and the Pashto spoken by the <a href="Durrani" class="uri" title="wikilink">Durrani</a> in Kandahar.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a> These criteria tend to be used by most Pashtuns in Pakistan and Afghanistan as the basis for who can be counted as a Pashtun.</p>

<p>The religious and cultural definition is more stringent and requires Pashtuns to be Muslim and adherents of the Pashtunwali code.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a> This is the most prevalent view among the more orthodox and conservative tribesmen who do not view Pashtuns of the Jewish faith as actual Pashtuns even if they themselves might claim to be of Hebrew ancestry depending upon which tribe is in question. The religious definition for Pashtuns is partially based upon the laws of Pashtunwali, and that those who are Pashtun must follow and honor Pashtunwali. However, Pashtun society is not entirely homogenous in the religious sense, as Pashtuns, who are predominantly <a href="Sunni" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sunni</a> Muslims, can also be followers of the <a href="Shia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Shia</a> sect among others. In addition, the <a href="Jews_and_Judaism_in_Pakistan" title="wikilink">Pakistani Jews</a> and the <a href="Jews_of_Afghanistan" title="wikilink">Afghan Jewish</a> population, once numbering in the thousands, have largely relocated to <a href="Israel" class="uri" title="wikilink">Israel</a>. Overall, more flexibility can be found among Pashtun intellectuals and academics who sometimes simply define who is and is not a Pashtun based upon other criteria that often excludes religion.</p>
<h3 id="ancestral-definition">Ancestral definition</h3>
<p>The patrilineal definition is based on an important orthodox law of Pashtunwali. Its main requirement is that anyone claiming to be a Pashtun must have a Pashtun father. This law has maintained the tradition of exclusively patriarchal tribal lineage intact. Under this definition, in order to be an ethnic Pashtun, there is less regard as to what language one speaks (Pashto, Persian, Urdu, English, etc.), while more emphasis is placed upon one's father. Thus, the Pathans in <a href="India" class="uri" title="wikilink">India</a>, for example, who have lost both the language and presumably many of the ways of their putative ancestors, can, by being able to trace their fathers' ethnic heritage back to the Pashtun tribes (who some believe are descendants of the four grandsons of <a href="Qais_Abdur_Rashid" title="wikilink">Qais Abdur Rashid</a>, a possible legendary progenitor of the Pashtuns), remain &quot;Pashtun&quot;.<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a> The legend states that Qais, after having heard of the new religion of Islam, traveled to meet the Muslim Prophet <a href="Muhammad" class="uri" title="wikilink">Muhammad</a> in <a href="Medina" class="uri" title="wikilink">Medina</a> and returned to Afghanistan-Pakistan area a Muslim. Qais, in turn, purportedly had many children and one son, Afghana, produced up to four sons who set out towards the east including one son who went towards <a href="Swat_(Pakistan)" title="wikilink">Swat</a>, another towards <a href="Lahore" class="uri" title="wikilink">Lahore</a>, another to <a href="Multan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Multan</a>, and finally one to <a href="Quetta" class="uri" title="wikilink">Quetta</a>. This legend is one of many traditional tales among the Pashtuns regarding their disparate origins that remain largely unverifiable.</p>
<h2 id="putative-ancestry">Putative ancestry</h2>
<p>There are various communities which claim Pashtun descent and are largely found amongst other groups in <a href="South_Asia" title="wikilink">South</a> and <a href="Central_Asia" title="wikilink">Central Asia</a> who generally do not speak Pashto and are often considered either overlapping groups or are simply assigned to the ethno-linguistic group that corresponds to their geographic location and their mother tongue. Some groups who claim Pashtun descent include various non-Pashtun Afghans who are often conversant in <a href="Persian_language" title="wikilink">Persian</a> rather than Pashto.<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a></p>
<p>Many claimants of Pashtun heritage in <a href="South_Asia" title="wikilink">South Asia</a> have mixed with local Muslim populations and refer to themselves (and Pashto-speaking Pashtuns and often Afghans in general) in the <a href="Hindi-Urdu" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hindi-Urdu</a> variant <strong>Pathan</strong> rather than Pashtun or Pukhtun.<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a> These populations are usually only part-Pashtun, to varying degrees, and often trace their Pashtun ancestry putatively through a paternal lineage, and are not universally viewed as ethnic Pashtuns (see section on <em>Pashtuns Defined</em> for further analysis).</p>
<p>Some groups claiming Pashtun descent live in close proximity to Pashtuns such as the <a href="Hindkowan_people" title="wikilink">Hindkowans</a> who are sometimes referred to as <em>Punjabi Pathans</em> (in publications such as <a href="Encyclopedia_Britannica" title="wikilink">Encyclop&lt;U+00E6&gt;dia Britannica</a>). The Hindkowans speak the <a href="Hindko_language" title="wikilink">Hindko language</a> and are regarded as a group of mixed Pashtun and <a href="Punjabi_people" title="wikilink">Punjabi</a> origin.<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a> Culturally similar to Pashtuns, the Hinkowans often practice Pashtunwali in Pashtun-majority areas. The Hindkowans are a large minority in major cities such as <a href="Peshawar" class="uri" title="wikilink">Peshawar</a>, <a href="Kohat" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kohat</a>, <a href="Mardan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mardan</a>, and <a href="Dera_Ismail_Khan" title="wikilink">Dera Ismail Khan</a> and in mixed districts including <a href="Haripur" class="uri" title="wikilink">Haripur</a> and <a href="Abbottabad" class="uri" title="wikilink">Abbottabad</a> where they are often bilingual in <a href="Hindko" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hindko</a> and <a href="Pashto" class="uri" title="wikilink">Pashto</a>.</p>
<p>Additionally, upwards of 20% of <a href="Urdu_language" title="wikilink">Urdu</a>-speakers claim partial Pashtun ancestry.<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a><a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a> Indian Pathans claim descent from Pashtun soldiers that settled in northern India and intermarried with local Muslims during the era of the <a href="Delhi_Sultanate" title="wikilink">Delhi Sultanate</a> and <a href="Mughal_Empire" title="wikilink">Mughal Empire</a>. The <a href="Rohilla" class="uri" title="wikilink">Rohilla</a> Pashtuns, after their defeat by the British, are notable for having intermarried with local Muslims. They are believed to have been bilingual in Pashto and Urdu until the mid-nineteenth century. The repression of Rohilla Pashtuns by the British in the late eighteenth century caused thousands to flee to the <a href="Netherlands" title="wikilink">Dutch</a> colony of <a href="Guyana" class="uri" title="wikilink">Guyana</a> in <a href="South_America" title="wikilink">South America</a>.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rohillas''&gt;<a href="http://afghanland.com/culture/guyana.html">Afghans of Guyana</a>, <em>Afghanland.com</em> (retrieved 18 January 2007)</ref></p>

<h2 id="culture">Culture</h2>

<p><img src="Pasht_rug.jpg" title="fig:Pashtun vendor displaying a silk rug from Afghanistan" alt="Pashtun vendor displaying a silk rug from Afghanistan" width="200" /> Pashtun culture was formed over the course of many centuries. Pagan traditions survived in the form of traditional dances, while literary styles and music largely reflect strong influence from the <a href="Culture_of_Iran" title="wikilink">Persian tradition</a> and regional musical instruments fused with localized variants and interpretation. Pashtun culture is a unique blend of native customs and strong influences from <a href="Central_Asian" title="wikilink">Central</a>, <a href="South_Asia" title="wikilink">South</a> and <a href="Middle_East" title="wikilink">West Asia</a>.</p>
<h3 id="language">Language</h3>

<p>The Pashtuns speak <a href="Pashto_language" title="wikilink">Pashto</a>, an <a href="Indo-European_language" title="wikilink">Indo-European language</a>. It belongs to the <a href="Iranian_languages" title="wikilink">Iranian sub-group</a> of the <a href="Indo-Iranian_languages" title="wikilink">Indo-Iranian</a> branch.<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a> It can be further delineated within <a href="Eastern_Iranian" title="wikilink">Eastern Iranian</a> and Southeastern Iranian. Pashto is written in the <a href="Perso-Arabic_script" title="wikilink">Perso-Arabic script</a> and is divided into two main dialects, the northern &quot;Pukhtu&quot; and the southern &quot;Pashto&quot;.</p>
<p>Pashto has ancient origins and bears similarities to extinct languages such as <a href="Avestan_language" title="wikilink">Avestan</a> and <a href="Bactrian_language" title="wikilink">Bactrian</a>.<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a> Its closest modern relatives include <a href="Pamir_languages" title="wikilink">Pamir languages</a>, such as <a href="Shughni_language" title="wikilink">Shughni</a> and <a href="Wakhi_language" title="wikilink">Wakhi</a>, and more distantly <a href="Ossetic" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ossetic</a> and has an ancient legacy of borrowing vocabulary from neighboring languages including <a href="Persian_language" title="wikilink">Persian</a> and <a href="Vedic_Sanskrit" title="wikilink">archaic Sanskrit</a>. Invaders have left vestiges as well as Pashto has borrowed words from <a href="ancient_Greek" title="wikilink">ancient Greek</a>, <a href="Arabic" class="uri" title="wikilink">Arabic</a> and <a href="Turkic_languages" title="wikilink">Turkic</a>, while modern borrowings come primarily from <a href="English_language" title="wikilink">English</a>.<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a></p>
<p>Fluency in Pashto is often the main determinant as to whether there is group acceptance as to who is and is not considered a Pashtun. Pashtun nationalism emerged following the rise of Pashto poetry that linked language and ethnic identity starting with the work of <a href="Khushal_Khan_Khattak" title="wikilink">Khushal Khan Khattak</a> and continued with his grandson <a href="Afzal_Khan_Khattak" title="wikilink">Afzal Khan</a> (author of <em>Tarikh-e Morassa</em>, a history of the Pashtun people).<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a></p>
<p>Pashto has national status in Afghanistan and regional status in Pakistan. In addition to their mother-tongue, many Pashtuns are fluent in <a href="Dari_(Afghanistan)" title="wikilink">Dari</a> (Afghan Persian) and/or <a href="Urdu" class="uri" title="wikilink">Urdu</a> as well as English.</p>
<h3 id="religion">Religion</h3>

<p>Pashtuns are predominantly <a href="Sunni" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sunni</a> <a href="Muslims" class="uri" title="wikilink">Muslims</a>, most of them followers of the <a href="Hanafite" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hanafite</a> branch of Sunni <a href="Islam" class="uri" title="wikilink">Islam</a>. There is a small minority of <a href="Twelvers" title="wikilink">Ithna Asharia Shia</a> Pashtuns largely concentrated in Afghanistan.<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a></p>
<p>Studies conducted amongst the <a href="Ghilzai" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ghilzai</a> reveal strong linkages between tribal affiliation and membership in the larger <a href="ummah" class="uri" title="wikilink">ummah</a> (Islamic community), as most Pashtuns believe that they are descendents of the aforementioned <a href="Qais_Abdur_Rashid" title="wikilink">Qais Abdur Rashid</a> who is purported to have been an early convert to Islam and thus bequeathed the faith to the entire Pashtun population.<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a> A legacy of <a href="sufi" class="uri" title="wikilink">sufi</a> activity remains common in Pashtun regions as evident in song and dance. Many Pashtuns are prominent <a href="Ulema" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ulema</a>, or Islamic scholars, such as <a href="Muhammad_Muhsin_Khan" title="wikilink">Dr. Muhammad Muhsin Khan</a> who translated the <a href="Noble_Qur&#39;an_(Hilali-Khan)" title="wikilink">Noble Quran</a> and <a href="Sahih_Al-Bukhari" title="wikilink">Sahih Al-Bukhari</a> and many other books into <a href="English_language" title="wikilink">English</a>.<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a></p>
<p>Non-Muslim Pashtuns are virtually non-existent as there is limited data regarding <a href="Irreligion" title="wikilink">irreligious</a> groups and minorities. Following the founding of the state of <a href="Israel" class="uri" title="wikilink">Israel</a> after <a href="World_War_II" title="wikilink">World War II</a> and ensuing decades, a tiny Pashtun <a href="Jewish" class="uri" title="wikilink">Jewish</a> population (numbering in the hundreds) left Kandahar and Peshawar.<a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a><a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="pashto-literature">Pashto literature</h3>
<p>Throughout Pashtun history, poets, prophets, kings and warriors have been amongst the most revered members of society. For much of Pashtun history, literature has not played a major role as <a href="Persian_literature" title="wikilink">Persian</a> was the literary <em><a href="lingua_franca" title="wikilink">lingua franca</a></em> used for communication purposes by neighboring peoples and generally relied upon for writing purposes. However, by the sixteenth century early written records of Pashto began to appear, the earliest of which describes Sheikh Mali's conquest of <a href="State_of_Swat" title="wikilink">Swat</a>.<a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a> The advent of Pashto poetry and the revered works of <a href="Khushal_Khan_Khattak" title="wikilink">Khushal Khan Khattak</a> and <a href="Rahman_Baba" title="wikilink">Rahman Baba</a> in the seventeenth century helped transition Pashto towards the modern period.<a href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a> In the twentieth century, Pashto literature gained significant prominence with the poetic works of <a href="Ameer_Hamza_Shinwari" title="wikilink">Ameer Hamza Shinwari</a> who was noted for his development of <em>Pashto Ghazals</em>.<a href="#fn67" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a> In recent times, Pashto literature has received increased patronage, but due to relatively high illiteracy rates, many Pashtuns continue to rely upon the oral tradition. Pashtun males continue to meet at <em>chai khaana</em>s or tea cafes to listen and relate various oral tales of valor and history.</p>
<p>Despite the general male dominance of Pashto oral story-telling, Pashtun society is also marked by some <a href="matriarchal" class="uri" title="wikilink">matriarchal</a> tendencies.<a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a> Folktales involving reverence for Pashtun mothers and matriarchs are common and are passed down from parent to child, as is most Pashtun heritage, through a rich <a href="oral_tradition" title="wikilink">oral tradition</a> that has survived the ravages of time.</p>
<h3 id="pashtunwali">Pashtunwali</h3>

<p>The term &quot;Pakhto&quot; or &quot;Pashto&quot; from which the Pashtuns derive their name is not merely the name of their language, but is synonymous with a pre-Islamic honor code/religion formally known as <a href="Pashtunwali" class="uri" title="wikilink">Pashtunwali</a> (or <em>Pakhtunwali</em>).<a href="#fn69" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref69"><sup>69</sup></a> Pashtunwali is believed to have originated millennia ago during pagan times and has, in many ways, fused with Islamic tradition.<a href="#fn70" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a> Pashtunwali governs and regulates nearly all aspects of Pashtun life ranging from tribal affairs to individual &quot;honor&quot; (<em>nang</em>) and behavior.</p>
<p>There are numerous intricate tenets of Pashtunwali that influence Pashtun social behavior. One of the better known tenets is <em>Melmastia</em> or the notion of hospitality and asylum to all guests seeking help. Perceived wrongs or injustice call for <em>Badal</em> or swift revenge. A popular Pashtun saying, &quot;Revenge is dish best served cold&quot;, was borrowed by the British and popularized in the <a href="Western_world" title="wikilink">West</a>.<a href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a> Men are expected to protect <em>Zan, Zar, Zameen</em> which translates to women, treasure, and land. Some aspects promote peaceful co-existence such as <em>Nanawati</em> or the humble admission of guilt for a wrong committed, which should result in automatic forgiveness from the wronged party. These and other basic precepts of Pashtunwali continue to be followed by many Pashtuns, especially in rural areas.</p>
<h3 id="sports">Sports</h3>
<p>Native traditional sports include <em><a href="buzkashi" class="uri" title="wikilink">buzkashi</a></em>, a contest between horsemen (believed to have been brought to the region by the <a href="Mongols" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mongols</a>) that entails dragging a goat carcass and keeping it away from other players. Another Pashtun past-time is <em>naiza bazi</em>, which also involves horsemen who compete in spear throwing.<a href="#fn72" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref72"><sup>72</sup></a></p>
<p><a href="Polo" class="uri" title="wikilink">Polo</a> is also an ancient traditional sport in the region and is a popular amongst many tribesmen such as the <a href="Yousafzai" class="uri" title="wikilink">Yousafzai</a>. Like other Afghans, many Pashtuns engage in wrestling (<em><a href="Pehlwani" class="uri" title="wikilink">Pehlwani</a></em>), which is often part of larger sporting events.<a href="#fn73" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref73"><sup>73</sup></a> Another Pashtun past-time is <em>naiza bazi</em>, which also involves horsemen who compete in spear throwing.<a href="#fn74" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref74"><sup>74</sup></a> Cricket is largely a legacy of British rule in the North-West Frontier Province and many Pashtuns have become prominent participants (such as <a href="Shahid_Afridi" title="wikilink">Shahid Afridi</a> and <a href="Imran_Khan" title="wikilink">Imran Khan</a>).</p>
<p><a href="Football_(soccer)" title="wikilink">Football (soccer)</a> is a more recent sport that increasing numbers of Pashtuns have started to play. Children engage in various games including a form of <a href="marbles" class="uri" title="wikilink">marbles</a> called <em>buzul-bazi</em> which is played with the knuckle bones of sheep. Although traditionally less involved in sports than boys, young Pashtun girls often play <a href="volleyball" class="uri" title="wikilink">volleyball</a> and <a href="basketball" class="uri" title="wikilink">basketball</a>, especially in urban areas.</p>
<h3 id="performing-arts">Performing arts</h3>
<p>Pashtun performers remain avid participants in various physical forms of expression including dance, sword fighting, and other physical feats. Perhaps the most common form of artistic expression can be seen in the various forms of Pashtun dances.</p>
<p>One of the most prominent dances is the <em>Attan</em>, a dance with ancient pagan roots, that was later modified by Islamic mysticism in some regions, and has become the national dance of Afghanistan.<a href="#fn75" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref75"><sup>75</sup></a> A rigorous exercise, the Attan is performed as musicians play various native instruments including the <em><a href="dhol" class="uri" title="wikilink">dhol</a></em> (drums), <em><a href="tabla" title="wikilink">tablas</a></em> (percussions), <em><a href="Afghan_Rubab" title="wikilink">rubab</a></em> (a bowed string instrument), and <em>toola</em> (wooden flute). Involving a rapid circular motion, dancers perform until no one is left dancing in a fashion similar to <a href="sufi" class="uri" title="wikilink">sufi</a> <a href="whirling_dervishes" title="wikilink">whirling dervishes</a>. Numerous other dances are affiliated with various tribes including the <em>Khattak Wal Atanrh</em> (eponymously named after the <a href="Khattak" class="uri" title="wikilink">Khattak</a> tribe), <em>Mahsood Wal Atanrh</em> (which, in modern times, involves the juggling of loaded rifles), and <em>Waziro Atanrh</em> among others. A sub-type of the <em>Khattak Wal Atanrh</em> known as the <em>Braghoni</em> involves the use of up to three swords and requires great skill to successfully execute. Though most dances are dominated by males, some dance performances such as the <em>Spin Takray</em> feature female dancers.<a href="#fn76" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref76"><sup>76</sup></a> Additionally, young women and girls often entertain at weddings with the <em>Tumbal</em> (tambourine).</p>
<p>Traditional Pashtun music has ties to <em><a href="Klasik" class="uri" title="wikilink">Klasik</a></em> (traditional Afghan music heavily inspired by <a href="Indian_classical_music" title="wikilink">Indian classical music</a>), <a href="Iranian_music" title="wikilink">Iranian musical</a> traditions, and other various forms found in <a href="South_Asia" title="wikilink">South Asia</a>. Popular forms include the <a href="ghazal" class="uri" title="wikilink">ghazal</a> (sung poetry) and <a href="Sufi" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sufi</a> <a href="qawwali" class="uri" title="wikilink">qawwali</a> music.<a href="#fn77" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref77"><sup>77</sup></a> General themes tend to revolve around love and religious introspection. Modern Pashto music is currently centered around the city of Peshawar due to the various wars in Afghanistan and tends to combine indigenous techniques and instruments with Iranian-inspired <a href="Persian_music" title="wikilink">Persian music</a> and Indian <a href="Filmi" class="uri" title="wikilink">Filmi</a> music prominent in <a href="Bollywood" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bollywood</a>.<a href="#fn78" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref78"><sup>78</sup></a></p>
<p>Other modern Pashtun media include an established Pashto language film and tv industry that is based in Pakistan. Producers based in <a href="Lahore" class="uri" title="wikilink">Lahore</a> have created Pashto language films since the 1970s. Pashto films were once popular, but have declined both commercially and critically in recent years.<a href="#fn79" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref79"><sup>79</sup></a> Past films such as <em>Yusuf Khan Sherbano</em> dealt with serious subject matter, traditional stories, and legends, but the Pashto film industry has, since the 1980s, been accused of churning out increasingly lewd <a href="Exploitation_film" title="wikilink">exploitation</a>-style films.<a href="#fn80" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref80"><sup>80</sup></a><a href="#fn81" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref81"><sup>81</sup></a> Pashtun lifestyle and issues have been raised by Western and Pashtun expatriate film-makers in recent years.

<h2 id="institutions">Institutions</h2>

<p>A prominent institution of the Pashtun people is the intricate system of tribes. The Pashtuns remain a predominantly tribal people, but the world-wide trend of urbanization has begun to alter Pashtun society as cities such as Peshawar and Quetta have grown rapidly due to the influx of rural Pashtuns and Afghan refugees.<a href="#fn84" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref84"><sup>84</sup></a> Many still identify themselves with various <a href="clan" title="wikilink">clans</a> despite this trend towards urbanization.</p>
<p>More precisely, there are several levels of organization within the Pashtun tribal system: the <em><a href="Tabar" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tabar</a></em> (tribe) is subdivided into kinship groups called <em><a href="Khel" title="wikilink">Khels</a></em>. The <em>Khel</em> in turn is divided into smaller groups (<em><a href="Pllarina" class="uri" title="wikilink">Pllarina</a></em> or <em>Plarganey</em>), each of which consists of several extended families or <em><a href="Kahols" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kahols</a></em>.<a href="#fn85" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref85"><sup>85</sup></a> &quot;A large tribe often has dozens of sub-tribes whose members may see themselves as belonging to each, some, or all of the sub-tribes in different social situations (co-operative, competitive, confrontational) and identify with each accordingly.&quot;<a href="#fn86" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref86"><sup>86</sup></a> Pashtun tribes are divided into four 'greater' tribal groups: <a href="Sarbans" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sarbans</a>, <a href="Qais_Abdur_Rashid" title="wikilink">Batans</a>, <a href="Qais_Abdur_Rashid" title="wikilink">Ghurghusht</a> and <a href="Qais_Abdur_Rashid" title="wikilink">Karlans</a>.</p>
<p>In addition to the tribal hierarchy, another prominent Pashtun institution is that of the <em><a href="Jirga" class="uri" title="wikilink">Jirga</a></em> or 'Senate' of elected <a href="Elder_(administrative_title)" title="wikilink">elders</a> and wise men. Most decisions in tribal life are made by members of the Jirga, which is the main institution of authority that the largely egalitarian Pashtuns willingly acknowledge as a viable governing body.<a href="#fn87" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref87"><sup>87</sup></a></p>
<p>Pashtuns often observe special occasions upon which to celebrate and/or commemorate events, which are also quite often national holidays in Pakistan and Afghanistan. A common <a href="Turko-Iranian" class="uri" title="wikilink">Turko-Iranian</a> celebration known as <em><a href="Nouruz" class="uri" title="wikilink">Nouruz</a></em> (or New Year) is often observed by Pashtuns.<a href="#fn88" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref88"><sup>88</sup></a> Most prominent are <a href="Muslim_holidays" title="wikilink">Muslim holidays</a> including <em><a href="Ramadan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ramadan</a></em> and <em><a href="Eid_al-Fitr" title="wikilink">Eid al-Fitr</a></em>. Muslim holidays tend to be the most widely observed and commercial activity can come to a halt as large extended families gather together in what is often both a religious duty and a festive celebration.</p>

<p><img src="Afghan_woman_Pashtun.jpg" title="fig:A Pashtun woman in Kabul, Afghanistan." alt="A Pashtun woman in Kabul, Afghanistan." width="300" /> The lives of Pashtun women vary from those who reside in conservative rural areas, such as the <a href="Federally_Administered_Tribal_Areas" title="wikilink">tribal belt</a>, to those found in relatively freer urban centers.<a href="#fn89" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref89"><sup>89</sup></a> Though many Pashtun women remain tribal and illiterate, others have become educated and gainfully employed.<a href="#fn90" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref90"><sup>90</sup></a> The ravages of the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan and the <a href="Wars_in_Afghanistan" title="wikilink">Afghan wars</a>, leading to the rise and fall of the Taliban, caused considerable hardship amongst Pashtun women as many of their rights were curtailed in favor of a rigid interpretation of <a href="Wahabbism" title="wikilink">Islamic law</a>. The difficult lives of Afghan female refugees gained considerable notriety with the iconic image of the so-called &quot;Afghan Girl&quot; (<a href="Sharbat_Gula" title="wikilink">Sharbat Gula</a>) depicted on the June 1985 cover of <a href="National_Geographic_Magazine" title="wikilink">National Geographic Magazine</a>.<a href="#fn91" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref91"><sup>91</sup></a> In addition, the male-dominated code of <em>Pashtunwali</em> often constrains women and forces them into designated traditional roles that separate the genders.<a href="#fn92" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref92"><sup>92</sup></a><a href="#fn93" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref93"><sup>93</sup></a> The pace of change and reform for women has been slow as a result of the wars in Afghanistan and the isolation and instability of tribal life in Pakistan.</p>
<p>Modern social reform for Pashtun women began in the 20th century. During the early 20th century, Queen <a href="Soraya_Tarzi" title="wikilink">Soraya Tarzi</a> of Afghanistan was an early feminist leader whose advocacy of social reforms for women was so radical that it led to the fall of her and her husband <a href="King_Amanullah" title="wikilink">King Amanullah</a>'s dynasty.<a href="#fn94" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref94"><sup>94</sup></a> Even during the tumultuous Soviet occupation of Afghanistan, civil rights remained an important issue as feminist leader <a href="Meena_Keshwar_Kamal" title="wikilink">Meena Keshwar Kamal</a> campaigned for women's rights and founded the Revolutionary Women of Afghanistan (RAWA) in the 1980s.<a href="#fn95" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref95"><sup>95</sup></a></p>
<p>Today, Pashtun women vary from the traditional housewives who live in seclusion to urban workers, some of whom seek or have attained parity with men.<a href="#fn96" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref96"><sup>96</sup></a> However, due to numerous social hurdles, the literacy rate for Pashtun women remains considerably lower than that of males.<a href="#fn97" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref97"><sup>97</sup></a><a href="#fn98" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref98"><sup>98</sup></a> Abuse against women is also widespread and yet is increasingly being challenged by women's rights organizations which find themselves struggling with conservative religious groups as well as government officials in both Pakistan and Afghanistan. According to researcher Benedicte Grima's book <em>Performance of Emotion Among Paxtun Women</em>, &quot;a powerful ethic of forbearance severely limits traditional Pashtun women's ability to mitigate the suffering they acknowledge in their lives.&quot;<a href="#fn99" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref99"><sup>99</sup></a></p>
<p>Pashtun women often have their legal rights curtailed in favor of their husbands or male relatives as well. For example, though women are technically allowed to vote in Afghanistan and Pakistan, many have been kept away from ballot boxes by males.<a href="#fn100" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref100"><sup>100</sup></a> Traditionally, Pashtun women have few inheritance rights and are often charged with taking care of large extended families of their spouses.<a href="#fn101" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref101"><sup>101</sup></a> Another tradition that persists is <em>swara</em>, a practice that involves giving a female relative to someone in order to rectify a dispute. The practice was declared illegal in 2000, but continues in tribal regions.<a href="#fn102" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref102"><sup>102</sup></a></p>
<p>Despite obstacles, many Pashtun women have begun a process of slow change. While most Pashtun women are illiterate, a rich <a href="oral_tradition" title="wikilink">oral tradition</a> and resurgence of poetry has been inspirational to many Pashtun women seeking to learn to read and write.<a href="#fn103" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref103"><sup>103</sup></a> As a sign of further female emancipation, a Pashtun woman recently became one of the first female fighter pilots in Pakistan's Air force.<a href="#fn104" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref104"><sup>104</sup></a> In addition, numerous Pashtun women have attained high political office both in Pakistan and, following recent elections, in Afghanistan, where the percentage of female representatives is one of the highest in the world.<a href="#fn105" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref105"><sup>105</sup></a> Substantial work remains though for Pashtun women who hope to gain equal rights with men who remain disproportionately dominant in most aspects of Pashtun society. Human rights organizations, including the <a href="Afghan_Women&#39;s_Network" title="wikilink">Afghan Women's Network</a>, continue to struggle for greater <a href="women&#39;s_rights" title="wikilink">women's rights</a> as does the <a href="Aurat_Foundation" title="wikilink">Aurat Foundation</a> in Pakistan, which attempts to safeguard women from domestic abuse.<a href="#fn106" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref106"><sup>106</sup></a><a href="#fn107" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref107"><sup>107</sup></a></p>
