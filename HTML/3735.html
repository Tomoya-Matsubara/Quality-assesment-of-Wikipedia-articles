<p><strong>Plano Senior High School</strong> (commonly <strong>Plano</strong>, <strong>Plano Senior</strong>, or <strong>PSHS</strong>) is a free <a href="public_high_school" title="wikilink">public secondary school</a> in <a href="Plano,_Texas" title="wikilink">Plano</a>, <a href="Texas" class="uri" title="wikilink">Texas</a>, <a href="United_States" title="wikilink">United States</a> serving <a href="eleventh_grade" title="wikilink">eleventh</a> and <a href="twelfth_grade" title="wikilink">twelfth graders</a>. The school is part of the <a href="Plano_Independent_School_District" title="wikilink">Plano Independent School District</a>, with admission primarily based on the locations of students' homes. Plano is a two-time <a href="Blue_Ribbon_Schools_Program" title="wikilink">Blue Ribbon School</a> and a Texas Exemplary School, and has a longstanding history of academic excellence.</p>
<p>Founded in 1891 as Plano Public School, serving both primary and secondary students, the school was by the mid-1910s sending a majority of its graduating classes on to college. Plano High School, created in 1952 by separating off the primary students into Mendenhall Elementary School, was immediately accredited by the <a href="Southern_Association_of_Colleges_and_Schools" title="wikilink">Southern Association of Colleges and Schools</a>, allowing its graduates to enter college without taking an entrance exam. In 1964, Plano High School integrated with the <a href="Frederick_Douglass" title="wikilink">Frederick Douglass</a> School, formerly Plano Colored School, and the integrated football team won the first of the school's seven state championships in 1965.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> In 1975, the school moved to a new 96 acre (0.4 km&lt;U+00B2&gt;) campus with five buildings, very similar to the layout of a <a href="junior_college" title="wikilink">junior college</a>, where it has remained since.</p>
<p>Plano administers more <a href="Advanced_Placement_Program" title="wikilink">Advanced Placement</a> tests each year than any other school west of the <a href="Mississippi_River" title="wikilink">Mississippi River</a> and all but one school in the United States.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> The school is accredited by the <a href="Texas_Education_Agency" title="wikilink">Texas Education Agency</a> and the <a href="Southern_Association_of_Colleges_and_Schools" title="wikilink">Southern Association of Colleges and Schools</a>. Plano's graduating classes are among the largest for high schools in the United States. Plano's Class of 2005, with 1112 graduates, was the second-largest high school graduating class in the U.S. that year, behind only that of <a href="Plano_East_Senior_High_School" title="wikilink">Plano East Senior High School</a>. <a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> Plano's mascot is the <a href="Wild_cat" title="wikilink">Wildcat</a>.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>

<p>In the 19th century, various private institutions existed within Plano for the education of children. One of these, the Plano Institute, was a private school founded in 1882 that offered an <a href="Bachelor_of_Arts" title="wikilink">Artium Baccalaureatus</a> degree. On <a href="June_9" title="wikilink">June 9</a>, <a href="1891" class="uri" title="wikilink">1891</a>, the people of Plano determined by a vote that the city should assume control of the schools. In July of that same year, the citizens approved a fifty <a href="Cent_(currency)" title="wikilink">cent</a> tax for school purposes<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> and for the purchase of the Plano Institute's land and building.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> The building was used for the new Plano Public School, from which Plano Senior High School would develop. Thus, 1891 is generally considered the school's foundation year. The original school grounds would later become the Cox Administration Building.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> In 1892, Plano graduated its first class of five people.</p>
<p>In 1899, the <a href="Plano_Independent_School_District" title="wikilink">Plano Independent School District</a> became a separate entity from the city.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> Because of this separation, 1899 is cited by the district as the establishment date for Plano Senior High School. Starting in 1901, the school was affiliated with the <a href="University_of_Texas_at_Austin" title="wikilink">University of Texas</a>, <a href="Baylor_University" title="wikilink">Baylor</a>, <a href="Texas_A&amp;M_University" title="wikilink">Texas A&amp;M</a>, and <a href="Southwestern_University" title="wikilink">Southwestern</a> in order to ensure that graduates could secure entrance to college. Unfortunately for students, official affiliations eventually ended due to budget restrictions.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> However, the affiliations, coupled with the high standards of Plano schools, led to a large number of graduating students going on to attend college. By the mid-1910s, a majority of the graduating class (as much as eighty percent) matriculated to an institute of higher learning, such as <a href="Harvard_University" title="wikilink">Harvard University</a>, <a href="Yale_University" title="wikilink">Yale University</a>, <a href="University_of_Texas_at_Austin" title="wikilink">University of Texas at Austin</a>, or <a href="Baylor_University" title="wikilink">Baylor University</a>. According to the 1915 Plano Review, &quot;The University of Texas probably draws more students from Plano than any one other institution.&quot; The Review goes on to state that &quot;no town in Texas, in proportion to its size, has more students in higher institutions of learning than Plano.&quot;<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<p>The original building burned down in 1894 and was reconstructed on the same site. The rebuilt Plano Public School again burned down in the spring of 1903, leading to the construction of yet another new building. The students went to classes in the local Opera House until the completion of the new building, often called the &quot;Spanish School&quot; because of its <a href="Islamic_architecture" title="wikilink">Moorish architecture</a>. Following its construction, the district built various new facilities to support its students, including a new <a href="band_(music)" title="wikilink">band hall</a>, <a href="gym" title="wikilink">gymnasium</a>, and <a href="auditorium" class="uri" title="wikilink">auditorium</a>.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1922, the <a href="Texas_Education_Agency" title="wikilink">Texas Department of Education</a> informed the district that the Spanish School was &quot;inadequate ... for high school work.&quot; By 1924, the district had constructed a new building to house the Plano Public School. In 1935, while the country was in the midst of the <a href="Great_Depression" title="wikilink">Great Depression</a>, the <a href="Works_Progress_Administration" title="wikilink">WPA</a> offered to build the district a much-needed new gym.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> The $125,000 USD (1.61 million 2005 dollars)<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> building, completed in 1938, was used as a gym, auditorium, classroom, and laboratory, allowing new subjects to be taught, including <a href="agriculture" class="uri" title="wikilink">agriculture</a>, <a href="business" class="uri" title="wikilink">business</a>, and <a href="family_and_consumer_science" title="wikilink">home economics</a>.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> At the time, Texas required that students complete 16 <a href="credit_(education)" title="wikilink">credits</a>, or full semester courses, to graduate. This expansion allowed Plano students a choice of 30 credits with which to fulfill the requirement.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="plano-high-school">Plano High School</h3>
<p>In September 1952, Mendenhall Elementary School was created, allowing primary students to be separated from secondary students. That same year, the newly created Plano High School was accredited by the <a href="Southern_Association_of_Colleges_and_Schools" title="wikilink">Southern Association of Colleges and Schools</a>, allowing its graduates to enter college without taking an entrance exam.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> In 1961, Plano High School moved to a new location on the east side of town, now the site of Williams High School, and the new building was constructed at a cost of $993,590 (6.2 million 2005 dollars).<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a><a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
<p>Following the 1954 <a href="Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States" title="wikilink">U.S. Supreme Court</a> decision <em><a href="Brown_v._Board_of_Education" title="wikilink">Brown v. Board of Education</a></em>, the Plano <a href="board_of_education" title="wikilink">school board</a> considered the issue of <a href="desegregation" title="wikilink">integrating</a> Plano High School with Plano Colored High School. The school board formed a committee of &quot;colored citizens&quot; to address the concern. Twice, in 1955 and 1957, when asked if they favored <a href="racial_integration" title="wikilink">integration</a>, the citizens on the committee stated they &quot;were perfectly happy with their school and would like to be left alone.&quot; In 1964, the issue was raised again when the school board voted to let students of the Plano Colored School, by then renamed the Frederick Douglass School, decide if they wanted to integrate with Plano High School. The students voted to integrate, and Douglass School became a primary facility. The 1964–1965 football team, the first integrated team for the school, won the first state championship in school history, helping to ease racial tensions. By 1968, Douglass School was closed. The Texas Education Agency later praised the district for its handling of integration, calling it &quot;an exceptional job.&quot;<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="plano-senior-high-school">Plano Senior High School</h3>
<p>In the 1970s, in response to massive growth and with a desire to lower <a href="dropout" class="uri" title="wikilink">dropout</a> rates and increase college readiness, then Superintendent H. Wayne Hendrick began a search for a new way to organize the school system. After touring several successful systems across the country, including those in <a href="Flint,_Michigan" title="wikilink">Flint, Michigan</a>, <a href="Denver,_Colorado" title="wikilink">Cherry Creek, Colorado</a>, <a href="Evanston,_Illinois" title="wikilink">Evanston, Illinois</a>, and <a href="Hillsboro,_Oregon" title="wikilink">Hillsboro, Oregon</a>, Hendrick found none of their systems suitable for Plano's needs. He instead decided to create a new senior high system. While the majority of American high schools serve students from grades nine through twelve, Plano's high schools serve only <a href="ninth_grade" title="wikilink">ninth</a> and <a href="tenth_grade" title="wikilink">tenth graders</a>, while senior high schools serve eleventh and twelfth graders. Two high schools <a href="feeder_school" title="wikilink">feed</a> into each senior high school, such as Plano Senior High.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> This system allows students to complete most of their required credits in high school and specialize with vocational classes at the senior high.</p>
<p>A plan was created for a 96 acre (0.4 km&lt;U+00B2&gt;) campus with five buildings, very similar to the layout of a <a href="junior_college" title="wikilink">junior college</a>. The campus now contains six buildings with the addition in 2002 of an indoor workout facility. The buildings are interconnected by <a href="green_belt" title="wikilink">greenspace</a>, which features a man-made <a href="pond" class="uri" title="wikilink">pond</a> as the central element. The campus was constructed at a cost of 10.3 million <a href="United_States_dollar" title="wikilink">U.S. dollars</a> (38.6 million 2005 dollars).<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> The school opened for the 1975-1976 school year with only two buildings completed. By <a href="Christmas" class="uri" title="wikilink">Christmas</a> of 1975, all five buildings were completed, and the school was dedicated on <a href="March_7" title="wikilink">March 7</a>, <a href="1975" class="uri" title="wikilink">1975</a>. The new senior high school offered a broad variety of studies previously unseen in the district. The new facility offered courses in <a href="social_studies" title="wikilink">social studies</a>, <a href="drama" class="uri" title="wikilink">drama</a>, <a href="art" class="uri" title="wikilink">art</a>, <a href="journalism" class="uri" title="wikilink">journalism</a> as well as vocational studies in <a href="fashion_design" title="wikilink">clothing design</a>, professional <a href="childcare" class="uri" title="wikilink">childcare</a>, <a href="cosmetology" class="uri" title="wikilink">cosmetology</a>, <a href="air_conditioning" title="wikilink">air conditioning</a> repair, and <a href="metalworking" class="uri" title="wikilink">metalworking</a>.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a></p>
<p>Due to high population growth rates in Plano, <a href="Plano_East_Senior_High_School" title="wikilink">Plano East Senior High School</a> was built in 1979 to alleviate overcrowding. In 1999, <a href="Plano_West_Senior_High_School" title="wikilink">Plano West Senior High School</a> was built for the same purpose. Plano Senior High students currently feed from Vines and <a href="Jasper_High_School_(Plano,_Texas)" title="wikilink">Jasper High Schools</a>. In 2002, Plano completed an $18 million renovation, making <a href="Americans_with_Disabilities_Act_of_1990" title="wikilink">ADA</a> compliance upgrades, and renovations to the science department, <a href="HVAC" class="uri" title="wikilink">HVAC</a>, fire sprinkler, and security systems, and site lighting.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a></p>

<p>Plano offers 29 <a href="Advanced_Placement_Program" title="wikilink">Advanced Placement</a> courses, which is all of the 31 courses possible with the exception of <a href="French_literature" title="wikilink">French literature</a> and <a href="Latin_literature" title="wikilink">Latin literature</a>. Yearly, the school administers more Advanced Placement tests than any other school west of the <a href="Mississippi_River" title="wikilink">Mississippi River</a>, and the second most tests in the United States (2,237 total exams in the year 2005).<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> The school also offers many <a href="vocational_education" title="wikilink">vocational courses</a>, as was Superintendent Hendrick's intent when it was built.

<p>In the 2005 graduating class, 97% of graduates went onto college or university: 85% went on to four-year universities, while the remaining 12% went to two-year colleges. Students in the class achieved an average composite <a href="SAT" class="uri" title="wikilink">SAT</a> score of 1162 out of 1600 and a mean composite <a href="ACT_(examination)" title="wikilink">ACT</a> score of 24.7 out of 36.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> Many Plano students received <a href="National_Merit_Scholarship_Program" title="wikilink">National Merit Scholarship</a> accolades in the 2005 school year, including 30 finalists, 33 semi-finalists, and 58 commended students.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> These individual class statistics are indicative of previous years' performances.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a><a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="extracurricular-activities">Extracurricular activities</h2>
<p>The <a href="extracurricular_activity" title="wikilink">extracurricular activities</a> offered at Plano Senior High School are many and varied due to the school's large size. There are chapters of national organizations such as the <a href="National_Honor_Society" title="wikilink">National Honor Society</a> and clubs founded by Plano students such as Acoustical Word, in which students play guitar and recite poetry. Service organizations such as <a href="Key_Club" title="wikilink">Key Club</a> coexist alongside clubs where students can have fun. The usual range of athletic and music organizations are there for students to join in addition to some of Plano's more unique clubs. <a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a></p>
<p>Plano Senior High School teams compete in <a href="University_Interscholastic_League" title="wikilink">UIL</a> competitions in District 8 of the 5A Class, the class designated for the largest schools. Districts are assigned arbitrarily, with the sole controlling factor being the proximity of schools in the district. Plano will move to District 9-5A in the 2006–2007 school year, following the UIL system's biennial realignment.</p>
<p>Plano's 2005 enrollment for competitive purposes is officially listed as 4,706.87. This is the number used by the UIL when determining what other schools Plano competes against in all UIL-sponsored athletic and academic competitions. This number exceeds the on-site enrollment of Plano Senior High because the official enrollment of each senior high school also includes the enrollment of each of its <a href="feeder_school" title="wikilink">feeder schools</a>. Ninth and tenth graders who are good enough to compete at the <a href="varsity_team" title="wikilink">varsity</a> level of a sport may be bussed to the senior high school to compete in varsity sports, therefore becoming part of the senior high's talent pool. The number is fractional because Jasper High School, one of Plano's feeder schools, is also a feeder school for <a href="Plano_West_Senior_High_School" title="wikilink">Plano West Senior High School</a>, and therefore the enrollment is split.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="athletics">Athletics</h3>
<h4 id="football">Football</h4>
<p><img src="Plano_High_School_football_team_1900.jpg" title="fig:The 1900 Plano football team was the school&#39;s first athletic team." alt="The 1900 Plano football team was the school&#39;s first athletic team." width="200" /> <img src="Plano_High_School_1914_girls_basketball.jpg" title="fig:Plano&#39;s girls&#39; basketball team, 1914" alt="Plano&#39;s girls&#39; basketball team, 1914" width="200" /> A small group of Plano boys formed an unofficial <a href="American_football" title="wikilink">football</a> team in 1898. In 1900, the first official high school team was formed. In 1909, Superintendent C.F. Walker complained to the local paper, &quot;Do you sleep well at night when you know your boy is on the streets kicking a football?&quot; Despite his concerns, by 1914, Plano fielded a football team and a men's and women's basketball team. However, the <a href="World_War_I" title="wikilink">first World War</a> cancelled all athletics, as there were not enough men to field any teams.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a></p>
<p>By 1925, athletics programs had been re-established, and a mascot had been chosen, the Wildcat. The 1925 football team completed an undefeated season, and the resulting fervor led to the increased funding of athletics in Plano. The district allocated funds to purchase a cow pasture for the purpose of playing football and other sports. The pasture was renamed Guy M. Rice Field, after the team's first football coach. By 1939, a &quot;modern&quot; stadium had been built at this site. With the construction of Plano High School in 1957, an accompanying stadium was built, and Rice Field was abandoned. In 1977, Plano completed construction on John Clark Field at a cost of $2.75 million ($8.92 million 2005 dollars).<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> Clark Field, with a capacity of 14,224, is the facility used for most varsity football games today. Kimbrough Stadium, a new stadium in 2004, is also occasionally the site for home games.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a><a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a></p>
<p>Following the integration of Plano High School with Plano Colored School, the football team made its first run at the Texas state championship in 1965. Most of the town shut down to make the drive to <a href="Austin,_Texas" title="wikilink">Austin, Texas</a>, and see the Wildcats win their first state championship. After the Wildcats won the championship again in 1967, the team was voted Texas Outstanding Football Team.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a></p>
<p>The Plano Varsity football team has gone to nine Texas state championships, as detailed below, and won seven. Plano's seven championships tie the school with <a href="Brownwood,_Texas" title="wikilink">Brownwood</a>, <a href="Celina,_Texas" title="wikilink">Celina</a>, and <a href="Southlake,_Texas" title="wikilink">Southlake Carroll</a> for the most in Texas. <a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> <a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a></p>
<p>Following the creation of <a href="Plano_West_Senior_High_School" title="wikilink">Plano West Senior High School</a> in 1999, Plano lost much of its player base to the new school, and the 2003 Plano Varsity football team suffered a winless season for the first time in the history of the school. The tenth graders who were recruited to play at the varsity level during the dismal 2003 season became twelfth graders in the 2005 season. Partly due to this extra experience, the 2005 team completed a perfect 10-0 regular season and went 3-1 in the playoffs, finally being defeated by the eventual state champions, the nationally rated number one <a href="Southlake,_Texas" title="wikilink">Southlake Carroll Dragons</a>.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a></p>
