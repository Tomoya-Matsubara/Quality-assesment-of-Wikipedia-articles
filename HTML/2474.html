<p>The <strong>1939 Pacific typhoon season</strong> has no official bounds; it ran year-round in <a href="1939" class="uri" title="wikilink">1939</a>, but most <a href="tropical_cyclones" title="wikilink">tropical cyclones</a> tend to form in the northwestern <a href="Pacific_Ocean" title="wikilink">Pacific Ocean</a> between <a href="May" class="uri" title="wikilink">May</a> and <a href="November" class="uri" title="wikilink">November</a>.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the northwestern <a href="Pacific_Ocean" title="wikilink">Pacific Ocean</a>.</p>
<p>The scope of this article is limited to the Pacific Ocean, north of the equator and west of the <a href="international_date_line" title="wikilink">international date line</a>. Storms that form east of the date line and north of the equator are called hurricanes; see <a href="1925-1949_Pacific_hurricane_seasons" title="wikilink">1939 Pacific hurricane season</a>. Storms in the season were tracked by the <a href="National_Oceanic_and_Atmospheric_Administration" title="wikilink">United States Weather Bureau</a> and released in the <a href="Monthly_Weather_Review" title="wikilink">Monthly Weather Review</a> under the header <strong>Typhoons and Depressions over the Far East</strong>. The Monthly Weather Review only covers <a href="tropical_cyclone" title="wikilink">tropical cyclones</a> west of 150&lt;U+00B0&gt; <a href="Longitude" title="wikilink">E</a>. Due to lack of satellites and ship reports due to the <a href="Pacific_War" title="wikilink">Pacific theatre</a> of <a href="World_War_II" title="wikilink">World War II</a>, it is possible other tropical cyclones existed, especially if they were short-lived or of minor intensity.</p>

<h3 id="depression-one">Depression One</h3>
<p>A depression was first observed on <a href="February_3" title="wikilink">February 3</a> while located about 250 miles (400 km) of <a href="Yap" class="uri" title="wikilink">Yap</a>. It tracked steadily westward until <a href="February_7" title="wikilink">February 7</a> when it stalled about 200 miles (320 km) east of the <a href="Philippines" title="wikilink">Philippine</a> island of <a href="Mindanao" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mindanao</a>. The depression remained nearly stationary for two days until turning to a steady northwest motion. It approached the island of <a href="Samar_Island" title="wikilink">Samar Island</a> on <a href="February_12" title="wikilink">February 12</a>, where a pressure of 1006 <a href="mbar" class="uri" title="wikilink">mbar</a> was reported, and subsequently turned to the north and later to the northeast. The depression was last observed on <a href="February_16" title="wikilink">February 16</a> accelerating towards the <a href="Aleutian_Islands" title="wikilink">Aleutian Islands</a>. The system produced heavy rainfall in the Philippines, with extensive flooding reported in <a href="Surigao_del_Norte" title="wikilink">Surigao del Norte</a>. It is unknown if the system intensified into a tropical storm.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="typhoon-two">Typhoon Two</h3>
<p>On <a href="April_29" title="wikilink">April 29</a>, an <a href="low_pressure_area" title="wikilink">area of low pressure</a> was located about 300 miles (480 km) south of <a href="Yap" class="uri" title="wikilink">Yap</a>. It moved westward, northward, and ultimately to the west-northwest before developing into a tropical depression on <a href="May_2" title="wikilink">May 2</a> to the east of the <a href="Philippines" class="uri" title="wikilink">Philippines</a>. Early on <a href="May_3" title="wikilink">May 3</a>, after intensifying into a tropical storm the system struck the Philippine island of <a href="Samar_Island" title="wikilink">Samar Island</a>, and the next day it hit <a href="Masbate" class="uri" title="wikilink">Masbate</a> before turning northward. After passing over northern <a href="Luzon" class="uri" title="wikilink">Luzon</a> on <a href="May_5" title="wikilink">May 5</a>, the storm accelerated northeastward as it moved through the <a href="Luzon_Strait" title="wikilink">Luzon Strait</a>, and intensified into a typhoon on <a href="May_7" title="wikilink">May 7</a>. While the typhoon was off the southern coast of <a href="Japan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Japan</a>, a ship located 290 miles (465 km) south of <a href="Nagoya" class="uri" title="wikilink">Nagoya</a> reported a minimum central pressure of 986 <a href="mbar" class="uri" title="wikilink">mbar</a> (hPa).

<p>The storm produced strong winds throughout the eastern portions of the Philippine archipelago. 90 fishermen were caught in the storm, with one person drowned and eleven missing at one estimate one month after the storm passed the area. Winds reached tropical storm force in southern Japan.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="typhoon-three">Typhoon Three</h3>
<p>A tropical depression developed on <a href="May_26" title="wikilink">May 26</a> in the northern portion of the <a href="South_China_Sea" title="wikilink">South China Sea</a>. After initially moving to the northwest, the depression later turned to the northeast and quickly intensified to attain typhoon status by <a href="May_28" title="wikilink">May 28</a> while located to the east of <a href="Hainan_Island" title="wikilink">Hainan Island</a>. The typhoon stalled stalled on <a href="May_30" title="wikilink">May 30</a> before turning to the west, and moved inland on southern <a href="China" class="uri" title="wikilink">China</a> on <a href="May_31" title="wikilink">May 31</a>. Several ships reported strong winds, rough seas, and heavy rainfall in conjunction with the storm, with one ship reporting a minimum central pressure of 994 <a href="mbar" class="uri" title="wikilink">mbar</a> (hPa). On land, a station in <a href="Hong_Kong" title="wikilink">Hong Kong</a> recorded a pressure of about 1000 mbar as well as minor winds. No damage was reported.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="typhoon-four">Typhoon Four</h3>
<p>On <a href="July_7" title="wikilink">July 7</a>, a tropical depression was first observed while located about 400 miles (645 km) east of <a href="Naha,_Okinawa" title="wikilink">Naha, Okinawa</a>. It moved to the northwest, and the next day a station in <a href="Amami_&lt;U+014C&gt;shima" title="wikilink">&lt;U+014C&gt;shima</a> reported winds in excess of 65 mph (105 km/h) and a pressure of 978 <a href="mbar" class="uri" title="wikilink">mbar</a> (hPa) when the storm was nearby. Based on the report, it is estimated it intensified into a typhoon, and after turning northeastward upon entering the <a href="Yellow_Sea" title="wikilink">Yellow Sea</a> it struck <a href="North_Korea" title="wikilink">North Korea</a>. The storm turned to the east, and was last observed on <a href="July_12" title="wikilink">July 12</a> in the open <a href="Pacific_Ocean" title="wikilink">Pacific Ocean</a>. Rainfall and flooding from the typhoon and several other storms during the month resulted in two deaths and considerable damage to private and public property in the Philippines.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="typhoon-five">Typhoon Five</h3>
<p>A tropical depression developed roughly 250 miles (400 km) of the eastern <a href="Philippines" class="uri" title="wikilink">Philippines</a> on <a href="July_7" title="wikilink">July 7</a>. The depression tracked northwestward initially, and after intensifying into a typhoon its motion turned to the north-northeast, followed by a turn back to the northwest on <a href="July_10" title="wikilink">July 10</a>. The typhoon crossed the <a href="East_China_Sea" title="wikilink">East China Sea</a> and made <a href="landfall_(meteorology)" title="wikilink">landfall</a> on eastern <a href="China" class="uri" title="wikilink">China</a> near <a href="Shanghai" class="uri" title="wikilink">Shanghai</a> on <a href="July_12" title="wikilink">July 12</a>, where 80 mph winds and a pressure of 992 <a href="mbar" class="uri" title="wikilink">mbar</a> (hPa) were recorded. The storm weakened as it continued its motion while roughly paralleling the northern coastline, and dissipated on <a href="July_13" title="wikilink">July 13</a>. The passage of the typhoon killed at least six people in Shanghai.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>

<p>On <a href="November_4" title="wikilink">November 4</a> a tropical disturbance organized into a tropical depression while located about 300 miles (480 km) east of <a href="Mindanao" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mindanao</a>. It moved quickly to the west-northwest, and struck the <a href="Philippines" title="wikilink">Philippine</a> island of <a href="Samar" class="uri" title="wikilink">Samar</a> without strengthening further. After passing through the archipelago, the storm entered the <a href="South_China_Sea" title="wikilink">South China Sea</a> late on <a href="November_5" title="wikilink">November 5</a>, and gradually weakened until dissipation on <a href="November_9" title="wikilink">November 9</a> near southwestern <a href="Taiwan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Taiwan</a>. A station in <a href="Santa_Cruz,_Laguna" title="wikilink">Santa Cruz</a> in <a href="Laguna_(province)" title="wikilink">Laguna province</a> recorded a pressure of 997 <a href="mbar" class="uri" title="wikilink">mbar</a> (hPa), with at least one station in the Philippines reporting tropical storm force winds. Reports from the country indicate it was potentially a typhoon, though meteorologists decided it was not due to relatively high pressures and lack of significant convection to the southwest of the center. Damage, if any, is unknown.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="depression-twenty-two">Depression Twenty-Two</h3>
<p>A tropical depression formed on <a href="November_6" title="wikilink">November 6</a> about 500 miles (800 km) east of <a href="Mindanao" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mindanao</a>. It initially moved to the west-northwest, and gradually recurved to the northeast. After accelerating east-northeastward, the depression was last observed on <a href="November_13" title="wikilink">November 13</a> as a remnant low pressure area over the open western <a href="Pacific_Ocean" title="wikilink">Pacific Ocean</a>. It is unknown if it strengthened into a tropical storm.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="typhoon-twenty-three">Typhoon Twenty-Three</h3>
<p>On <a href="November_18" title="wikilink">November 18</a> a tropical depression was first observed to the east of <a href="Mindanao" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mindanao</a>. The depression steadily intensified as it tracked west-northwestward, and intensified into a typhoon prior to striking <a href="Samar_Island" title="wikilink">Samar Island</a> and <a href="Leyte_Island" title="wikilink">Leyte Island</a> on <a href="November_19" title="wikilink">November 19</a>. It continued westward until reaching the western region of the <a href="South_China_Sea" title="wikilink">South China Sea</a> on <a href="November_22" title="wikilink">November 22</a>.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> An approaching <a href="surface_weather_analysis" title="wikilink">cold front</a> turned the typhoon to the northeast, resulting in a rare occurrence of a typhoon recurving northeastward in the western portion of the South China Sea. On <a href="November_24" title="wikilink">November 24</a> the typhoon passed over <a href="Macau" class="uri" title="wikilink">Macau</a>, and two hours later the <a href="eye_(cyclone)" title="wikilink">eye</a> crossed directly over <a href="Hong_Kong" title="wikilink">Hong Kong</a>. The calm of the center of the eye lasted for fifteen minutes at the <a href="Hong_Kong_Observatory" title="wikilink">Hong Kong Observatory</a>, the first time on record that the calm of the typhoon was recorded there. The typhoon began to become <a href="extratropical" class="uri" title="wikilink">extratropical</a> after making landfall,<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> and continued northeastward through southern <a href="China" class="uri" title="wikilink">China</a>. It gradually weakened while passing through the <a href="Taiwan_Strait" title="wikilink">Taiwan Strait</a> and possibly over <a href="Taiwan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Taiwan</a> before dissipating on <a href="November_26" title="wikilink">November 26</a>.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a></p>
<p>While crossing over the <a href="Philippines" class="uri" title="wikilink">Philippines</a>, a station in <a href="Capiz" class="uri" title="wikilink">Capiz</a> on <a href="Panay_Island" title="wikilink">Panay Island</a> recorded a pressure of 981 <a href="mbar" class="uri" title="wikilink">mbar</a> (hPa) as well as winds in excess of 55 mph (88 km/h). The passage of the typhoon sunk a motor boat on <a href="Masbate" class="uri" title="wikilink">Masbate</a> island, killing 48 of the 50 occupants aboard. One person was reported missing and presumed dead in <a href="Balangiga,_Eastern_Samar" title="wikilink">Balangiga</a> in <a href="Eastern_Samar" title="wikilink">Eastern Samar</a>, believed to be caused by drowning. Property damage was great in <a href="Samar_province" title="wikilink">Samar</a>, <a href="Leyte_province" title="wikilink">Leyte</a>, and <a href="Capiz_province" title="wikilink">Capiz provinces</a>.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> In <a href="Hong_Kong" title="wikilink">Hong Kong</a>, wind gusts reached 74 mph (119 km/h) during a <a href="rainband" class="uri" title="wikilink">rainband</a> ahead of the storm. Rainfall began seven hours prior to the arrival of the typhoon, and amounted to roughly 4.27 inches (108 mm). The heaviest rainfall occurred in rainbands ahead of the typhoon, with about 1.6 inches (40 mm) falling during a 1 hour time period. The lowest pressure recorded in Hong Kong was about 989 <a href="mbar" class="uri" title="wikilink">mbar</a> (hPa) while the typhoon was passing through the area.
