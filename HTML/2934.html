<p>Because Saltalamacchia was &quot;blocked&quot; (McCann, who was recently signed to a large contract with Atlanta, is a more accomplished player already catching with the Braves), he was the subject of much trade speculation within baseball, as a powerful switch-hitting catcher commands interest from nearly any baseball club within the major leagues. After much speculation, he was traded to the Texas Rangers on July 31, 2007, with four prospects for first baseman <a href="Mark_Teixeira" title="wikilink">Mark Teixeira</a> and reliever <a href="Ron_Mahay" title="wikilink">Ron Mahay</a>.</p>
<p>Though actual playing time was limited, Saltalamacchia batted .284 with 4 home runs and 12 RBI in 47 games with Atlanta in 2007.</p>
