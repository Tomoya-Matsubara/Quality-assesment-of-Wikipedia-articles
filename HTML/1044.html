<h2 id="history">History</h2>

<h3 id="toponymy">Toponymy</h3>
<p>Didsbury derives its name from the Anglo-Saxon <em>Dyddi's burg</em>, probably referring to a man known as Dyddi whose stronghold or township it was<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> on a low cliff overlooking a place where the river <a href="Mersey" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mersey</a> could be forded. In the 13th century Didsbury was variously referred to as Dydesbyre, Dydesbiri, Didsbury, or Dodesbury.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="parish-church">Parish Church</h3>
<p><img src="Exterior_of_St_James.JPG" title="fig:Church of St James, Didsbury in 2013" alt="Church of St James, Didsbury in 2013" /> A charter granted in about 1260 shows that a corn-grinding mill was operating in Didsbury, along the River Mersey,<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> but the earliest reference to Didsbury is in a document dating from 1235, recording a grant of land for the building of a chapel.&lt;ref name=St James'&gt;</ref> The church was named <a href="Church_of_St_James,_Didsbury" title="wikilink">St James Church</a> in 1855. It underwent major refurbishment in 1620 and again in the 19th century, although most of the stonework visible today dates from the 17th century.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> A parsonage was built next to one of the two public houses that flanked the nearby village green, Ye Olde Cock Inn, so-called because of the cock fighting that used to take place there. The parsonage soon gained a reputation for being haunted; servants refused to sleep on the premises, and it was abandoned in 1850. Local alderman Fletcher Moss bought the house in 1865, and lived in it for more than 40 years. In 1902, he installed wrought iron gates at the entrance to the parsonage's garden, which, because of the building's reputation, became known locally as &quot;the gates to Hell&quot;. The parsonage became a museum, now closed, but the gardens are still open to the public. The area around St James Church has the highest concentration of <a href="listed_building" title="wikilink">listed buildings</a> in Manchester, outside the city centre.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="river-mersey">River Mersey</h3>
<p>Didsbury was one of the few places between Stretford and Stockport where the River Mersey could be <a href="Ford_(crossing)" title="wikilink">forded</a>, which made it significant for troop movements during the <a href="English_Civil_War" title="wikilink">English Civil War</a>, in which Manchester was on the <a href="Roundheads" title="wikilink">Parliamentarian</a> side. The <a href="Cavalier" title="wikilink">Royalist</a> commander, <a href="Prince_Rupert_of_the_Rhine" title="wikilink">Prince Rupert</a>, stationed himself at Didsbury Ees, to the south of Barlow Moor. It is also likely that <a href="Charles_Edward_Stuart" title="wikilink">Bonnie Prince Charlie</a> crossed the Mersey at Didsbury in 1745, in the <a href="Jacobitism" title="wikilink">Jacobite</a> march south from Manchester to Derby, and again in his subsequent retreat.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="immigration-from-europe">Immigration from Europe</h3>
<p>Jewish immigrants started to arrive in Manchester from the late 18th century, initially settling mainly in the suburbs to the north of the city. From the 1890s onwards, many of them moved to what were seen as the more &quot;sophisticated&quot; suburbs in the south, such as Withington and Didsbury.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> The influx of Jewish immigrants led to West Didsbury being nicknamed &quot;Yidsbury&quot; and Palatine Road, a main road through West Didsbury, &quot;Palestine Road&quot;.</p>
<h3 id="th-and-20th-centuries">19th and 20th centuries</h3>
<p>During the Victorian expansion of Manchester, Didsbury developed as a prosperous settlement; a few mansions from the period still exist on Wilmslow Road between Didsbury Village and Parrs Wood to the east and Withington to the north, but they have now been converted to nursing homes and offices. The opening of the <a href="Midland_Railway" title="wikilink">Midland Railway</a> line in 1880 contributed greatly to the rapid growth in the population of Didsbury, with stations at Didsbury and Withington and West Didsbury offering easy rail connections to <a href="Manchester_Central_railway_station" title="wikilink">Manchester Central</a>. The line closed in 1967, although Didsbury station building remained standing until its demolition in the 1980s. The station clock and water fountain have survived, dedicated to local doctor and campaigner for the poor, Dr. J. Milson Rhodes.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
<p>On 28 April 1910, French pilot <a href="Louis_Paulhan" title="wikilink">Louis Paulhan</a> landed his <a href="Farman" class="uri" title="wikilink">Farman</a> biplane in Barcicroft Fields, Pytha Fold Farm, on the borders of Withington, Burnage and Didsbury, at the end of the <a href="1910_London_to_Manchester_air_race" title="wikilink">first flight from London to Manchester in under 24 hours</a>, with one short overnight stop at Lichfield. Arriving at 5:30 am, Paulhan beat the British contender, <a href="Claude_Grahame-White" title="wikilink">Claude Grahame-White</a>, winning a &lt;U+00A3&gt;10,000 prize offered by the <em><a href="Daily_Mail" title="wikilink">Daily Mail</a></em>. This was the first powered flight into Manchester from any point outside the city. Two special trains were chartered to the newly built but unopened Burnage Station to take spectators to the landing, many of whom had stood throughout the night. Paulhan's progress was followed throughout by a special train carrying his wife, <a href="Henri_Farman" title="wikilink">Henri Farman</a> and his mechanics. Afterwards his train took the party to a civic reception given by the Lord Mayor of Manchester in the Town Hall. A house in Paulhan Road, constructed in the 1930s near the site of his landing, is marked by a <a href="blue_plaque" title="wikilink">blue plaque</a> to commemorate his achievement.</p>

<p>In the early 13th century, Didsbury lay within the <a href="Manorialism" title="wikilink">manor</a> of Withington, a feudal estate that also included the townships of <a href="Withington" class="uri" title="wikilink">Withington</a>, <a href="Chorlton-cum-Hardy" class="uri" title="wikilink">Chorlton-cum-Hardy</a>, <a href="Moss_Side" title="wikilink">Moss Side</a>, <a href="Rusholme" class="uri" title="wikilink">Rusholme</a>, <a href="Burnage" class="uri" title="wikilink">Burnage</a>, <a href="Denton,_Greater_Manchester" title="wikilink">Denton</a> and <a href="Haughton,_Greater_Manchester" title="wikilink">Haughton</a>, ruled by the Hathersage, Longford and Tatton families,<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> and within the <a href="Historic_counties_of_England" title="wikilink">historic county boundaries</a> of <a href="Lancashire" class="uri" title="wikilink">Lancashire</a>.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> Didsbury remained within the manor of Withington for several centuries.</p>
<p>By 1764, Didsbury was described as a township in its own right.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> It became a <a href="civil_parishes_in_England" title="wikilink">civil parish</a> in 1866, and in 1876 was incorporated into the Withington Urban Sanitary District, superseded in 1894 by the creation of Withington Urban District.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> Withington Urban District was a subdivision of the <a href="Administrative_counties_of_England" title="wikilink">administrative county</a> of Lancashire, created as part of the provisions of the <a href="Local_Government_Act_1894" title="wikilink">Local Government Act 1894</a>. In 1904, Withington Urban District was amalgamated into the city and <a href="county_borough" title="wikilink">county borough</a> of Manchester, and so Didsbury was absorbed into Manchester, although it remained a civil parish until 1910. Following the <a href="Local_Government_Act_1972" title="wikilink">Local Government Act 1972</a>, Manchester became a <a href="metropolitan_borough" title="wikilink">metropolitan borough</a> of the <a href="metropolitan_county" title="wikilink">metropolitan county</a> of <a href="Greater_Manchester" title="wikilink">Greater Manchester</a>.</p>
<h3 id="political-representation">Political representation</h3>
<p>Didsbury is in the <a href="parliamentary_constituency" title="wikilink">parliamentary constituency</a> of <a href="Manchester_Withington_(UK_Parliament_constituency)" title="wikilink">Manchester Withington</a>, and is represented by <a href="John_Leech_(politician)" title="wikilink">John Leech MP</a>, a member of the <a href="Liberal_Democrats" title="wikilink">Liberal Democrats</a>.</p>
<p>Until 2004, most of the area formed the Didsbury <a href="Ward_(politics)" title="wikilink">ward</a> of <a href="City_of_Manchester" title="wikilink">Manchester City Council</a> with a section of West Didsbury contained within the Barlow Moor ward. However, <a href="Boundary_Commissions_(United_Kingdom)" title="wikilink">boundary changes</a> in 2004 resulted in Didsbury being split mainly between the two new wards of Didsbury East and Didsbury West while a small section of West Didsbury was incorporated into the new ward of <a href="Chorlton_Park" title="wikilink">Chorlton Park</a>.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> Didsbury East is represented by Liberal Democrat Councillor Andrew Taylor and Labour councillors Bridie Adams and Andrew Simcock.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> Didsbury West is represented by Liberal Democrat Councillor Mark Clayton and Labour councllors Carl Ollerhead and David Ellison.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> All wards within Manchester elect in thirds on a <a href="Elections_in_the_United_Kingdom#Regional_and_local_elections" title="wikilink">four yearly cycle</a>.</p>

<p><img src="Didsbury_1905.jpg" title="fig:Ordnance survey map of Didsbury from 1905" alt="Ordnance survey map of Didsbury from 1905" width="275" /> Didsbury, at  (53.4166, &lt;U+2212&gt;2.2311), is south of the midpoint of the <a href="Greater_Manchester_Urban_Area" title="wikilink">Greater Manchester Urban Area</a>,  south of Manchester city centre. To the north, Didsbury is bordered by <a href="Withington" class="uri" title="wikilink">Withington</a>, <a href="Chorlton-cum-Hardy" class="uri" title="wikilink">Chorlton-cum-Hardy</a> and <a href="Burnage" class="uri" title="wikilink">Burnage</a>, to the west by <a href="Northenden" class="uri" title="wikilink">Northenden</a>, to the east and south-east by <a href="Heaton_Mersey" title="wikilink">Heaton Mersey</a> and <a href="Cheadle,_Greater_Manchester" title="wikilink">Cheadle</a>, and by <a href="Gatley" class="uri" title="wikilink">Gatley</a> to the south.</p>
<p>The <a href="River_Mersey" title="wikilink">River Mersey</a> forms Didsbury's southern and southwestern boundaries and certain stretches of the river also demarcate the boundaries of the <a href="City_of_Manchester" title="wikilink">City of Manchester</a>. The area is generally considered to be roughly enclosed by Princess Parkway to the west, Kingsway to the east and the Ball Brook, just north of Lapwing Lane/Fog Lane to the north. This northern boundary is marked by a boundary stone in the front garden wall of a house on the west side of Wilmslow Road. A &quot;country trail&quot; passes from West Didsbury to East, named the Trans Pennine Trail (<a href="National_Cycle_Network" title="wikilink">National Cycle Route</a> 62). It was sited along a disused railway track, as part of a nationwide initiative to promote cycling.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a></p>
<p>Didsbury's built environment has developed around the areas of East Didsbury, West Didsbury, and Didsbury Village, which separates the two. The Albert Park conservation area, covering much of West Didsbury, places planning restrictions on development, alterations to buildings, and pruning of trees. The areas adjacent to the Mersey lie within the river's flood plain, and so have historically been prone to flooding after heavy rainfall.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> The last major flooding was in the late 1960s. In the 1970s extensive flood mitigation work carried out along the Mersey Valley through Manchester has helped to speed up the passage of floodwater. <a href="Fletcher_Moss_Botanical_Garden" title="wikilink">Fletcher Moss Botanical Garden</a> also acts as an emergency flood basin, storing floodwater until it can be safely released back into the river.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a></p>
