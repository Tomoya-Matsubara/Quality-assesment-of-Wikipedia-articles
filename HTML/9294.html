<p><strong>Grand Forks</strong> is a city in <a href="Grand_Forks_County,_North_Dakota" title="wikilink">Grand Forks County</a>, <a href="North_Dakota" title="wikilink">North Dakota</a> in the <a href="United_States" title="wikilink">United States</a>. It is the <a href="county_seat" title="wikilink">county seat</a> of Grand Forks County and the third largest city in North Dakota. The population was 49,321 at the 2000 census (2005 city estimate: 53,230<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>). Grand Forks was founded in <a href="1870" class="uri" title="wikilink">1870</a> and incorporated in <a href="1881" class="uri" title="wikilink">1881</a>.</p>
<p>Named after the forking of the <a href="Red_River_of_the_North" title="wikilink">Red River of the North</a> with the <a href="Red_Lake_River" title="wikilink">Red Lake River</a> near the <a href="Downtown_Grand_Forks" title="wikilink">downtown area</a>, the city lies on the western bank of the Red River in the <a href="Red_River_Valley" title="wikilink">Red River Valley</a>. It has a <a href="twin_cities" title="wikilink">twin city</a>, <a href="East_Grand_Forks,_Minnesota" title="wikilink">East Grand Forks, Minnesota</a>, which lies on the east side of the Red River. The two communities make up the core urban area of the &quot;Grand Forks, North Dakota, <a href="North_Dakota" title="wikilink">ND</a>-<a href="Minnesota" title="wikilink">MN</a> <a href="Metropolitan_Statistical_Area" title="wikilink">Metropolitan Statistical Area</a>&quot;. The metropolitan area is often called &quot;<a href="Greater_Grand_Forks" title="wikilink">Greater Grand Forks</a>&quot; or &quot;The Grand Cities&quot; (although that nickname is newer and not as generally accepted). The city of Grand Forks occasionally uses the nickname &quot;The Sunflake City&quot;.</p>
<p>Grand Forks is home to the <a href="University_of_North_Dakota" title="wikilink">University of North Dakota</a> (UND) and the <a href="Grand_Forks_Air_Force_Base" title="wikilink">Grand Forks Air Force Base</a> (located 13 miles west of town). These two entities are among the largest employers in the state. Historically dependent on local <a href="agriculture" class="uri" title="wikilink">agriculture</a>, the city's economy has moved towards one centered on higher education, health care, the retail and service sector, and some scientific research. The city is somewhat of a hybrid of an agricultural town and a <a href="college_town" title="wikilink">college town</a>.</p>
<p>The city became known for its battle with the flooding Red River during April of 1997 in what is referred to as <a href="Red_River_Flood,_1997" title="wikilink">The Flood of 1997</a>. Today, Grand Forks has mostly recovered from the flooding. The metropolitan area encompasses two counties and is seen as the retail, educational, healthcare, and entertainment center of a large portion of northeastern North Dakota and northwestern <a href="Minnesota" class="uri" title="wikilink">Minnesota</a>.</p>
<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<h3 id="early-history">Early history</h3>
<p>Grand Forks is the oldest major city in <a href="The_Dakotas" title="wikilink">The Dakotas</a>. Prior to settlement by Europeans, the area where the city now sits (at the forks of the <a href="Red_River_of_the_North" title="wikilink">Red River</a> and <a href="Red_Lake_River" title="wikilink">Red Lake River</a>) had been an important meeting and trading point for <a href="Native_Americans_in_the_United_States" title="wikilink">Native Americans</a>. Early French explorers, fur trappers, and traders called the area &quot;<em>Les Grandes Fourches</em>&quot; (meaning &quot;The Grand Forks&quot;). By the 1740s, <em>Les Grandes Fourches</em> was an important rendezvous point for French fur trappers. This French fur trade continued until the <a href="French_and_Indian_War" title="wikilink">French and Indian War</a> gave <a href="Canada" class="uri" title="wikilink">Canada</a> to the British. In 1800, British fur trader <a href="Alexander_Henry_(the_younger)" title="wikilink">Alexander Henry the Younger</a>, an agent for the <a href="North_West_Company" title="wikilink">North West Company</a> of <a href="Montreal" class="uri" title="wikilink">Montreal</a>, located a temporary camp at <em>Les Grandes Fourches</em> and, in 1808, established a permanent post. By the 1820s, the <a href="Hudson&#39;s_Bay_Company" title="wikilink">Hudson's Bay Company</a> and <a href="John_Jacob_Astor" title="wikilink">John Jacob Astor</a>'s <a href="American_Fur_Company" title="wikilink">American Fur Company</a> also had operations at the site.</p>
<p>During the mid-1800s, <em>Les Grandes Fourches</em> was a stopping off point for the <a href="Red_River_ox_cart" title="wikilink">Red River ox carts</a> which carried goods between <a href="St._Paul,_Minnesota" title="wikilink">St. Paul, Minnesota</a> and <a href="Fort_Garry" title="wikilink">Fort Garry</a> (now <a href="Winnipeg,_Manitoba" title="wikilink">Winnipeg, Manitoba</a>). On <a href="June_15" title="wikilink">June 15</a>, <a href="1870" class="uri" title="wikilink">1870</a>, the first post office was opened and &quot;<em>Les Grandes Fourches</em>&quot; was anglicanized to &quot;Grand Forks&quot;. Unlike most cities in <a href="North_Dakota" title="wikilink">North Dakota</a>, the city of Grand Forks does not owe its existence to the arrival of the <a href="railroad" class="uri" title="wikilink">railroad</a>. Instead, Grand Forks was first an important steamboat port on the Red River of the North. In late 1870, a <a href="steamboat" class="uri" title="wikilink">steamboat</a> captained by <a href="Alexander_Griggs" title="wikilink">Alexander Griggs</a> froze in the Red River at Grand Forks and Griggs and his men were forced to remain there for the rest of the winter. They built a temporary shed to live in for the winter and Griggs seemed to have decided that the area would be a good spot for a town. In the spring, he claimed a nine acre (36,000 m&lt;U+00B2&gt;) piece of property that would become the townsite and, ultimately, <a href="downtown_Grand_Forks" title="wikilink">downtown Grand Forks</a>.</p>
<h3 id="settlement">Settlement</h3>
<p>A small community quickly developed. In 1875, <em>The Plaindealer</em>, the town's first newspaper, was started by <a href="George_H._Walsh" title="wikilink">George H. Walsh</a>. In 1879, <a href="George_Winship" title="wikilink">George Winship</a> started <em><a href="Grand_Forks_Herald" title="wikilink">The Herald</a></em>. The <a href="twin_cities" title="wikilink">twin cities</a> of Grand Forks and <a href="East_Grand_Forks,_Minnesota" title="wikilink">East Grand Forks</a> were first physically connected when, in 1879, Alexander Griggs built a pontoon toll bridge at the present day site of the Sorlie Bridge at DeMers Avenue. The city of Grand Forks was officially incorporated on <a href="February_22" title="wikilink">February 22</a>, <a href="1881" class="uri" title="wikilink">1881</a>.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>Grand Forks grew rapidly in its early years. Growth was spurred by waves of <a href="immigrants" class="uri" title="wikilink">immigrants</a> and Americans from the eastern portion of the country, the steamboat traffic on the river, and the coming of the railroad. The <a href="St._Paul,_Minneapolis,_and_Manitoba_Railway" title="wikilink">St. Paul, Minneapolis, and Manitoba Railway</a> (<a href="Great_Northern_Railway_(US)" title="wikilink">Great Northern Railway</a>) reached Grand Forks in 1880 and the <a href="Northern_Pacific_Railway" title="wikilink">Northern Pacific Railway</a> came in 1887. The first settlers of Grand Forks were farmers and working men, but merchants and professional people from <a href="Minneapolis,_Minnesota" title="wikilink">Minneapolis</a> and other cities soon populated the city. After the arrival of the railroad, old wood-frame buildings were quickly replaced with brick buildings. The Hotel Dacotah, the St. John's Block, and the Security Building - all five stories - dominated the community's skyline and were a sign of a growing city.</p>
<p>In 1883, the <a href="University_of_North_Dakota" title="wikilink">University of North Dakota</a> was founded by George H. Walsh before North Dakota was formally recognized as an independent state (born from the <a href="Dakota_Territory" title="wikilink">Dakota Territory</a>). In 1893, The Diamond Milling Company of Grand Forks started making a new breakfast cereal they called <a href="Cream_of_Wheat" title="wikilink">Cream of Wheat</a>, invented by mill employee Thomas Amidon.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> By the dawn of the 20th century, the city had become the commercial, transportation, educational, health care, entertainment, and cultural center of the region and boasted many amenities usually found in larger cities.</p>
<h3 id="th-century">20th century</h3>
<p>The first half of the 1900s saw steady growth and the development of new neighborhoods farther south and west of <a href="Downtown_Grand_Forks" title="wikilink">downtown</a>. The 1920s saw the construction of the <a href="public_ownership" title="wikilink">state-owned</a> <a href="North_Dakota_Mill_and_Elevator" title="wikilink">North Dakota Mill and Elevator</a> on the north side of the city. In 1954, Grand Forks was chosen as the site for an <a href="United_States_Air_Force" title="wikilink">Air Force</a> base.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> <a href="Grand_Forks_Air_Force_Base" title="wikilink">Grand Forks Air Force Base</a> brought thousands of new jobs and residents to the community. The military base and the University of North Dakota would become the two most integral pieces of the city's economy.</p>
<p>The later half of the century saw an increased shift away from downtown and towards the outskirts of the community. The coming of the <a href="Interstate_Highway_System" title="wikilink">Interstate Highway System</a> revolutionized the way people traveled throughout the region. Several <a href="urban_renewal" title="wikilink">urban renewal</a> projects tore down sections of the downtown area to make way for public buildings and transportation improvements. New public schools, a new hospital, and many commercial centers were built during this period. The opening of the <a href="Columbia_Mall_(Grand_Forks)" title="wikilink">Columbia Mall</a> on the south side of town in 1978 forever changed the retail scene in the community.</p>
<h3 id="flood-of-1997">Flood of 1997</h3>

<p><img src="redrivergrandforkscairn.jpg" title="fig:Flood memorial in Grand Forks commemorating the 1997 flood" alt="Flood memorial in Grand Forks commemorating the 1997 flood" width="150" /> The city was struck by a severe flood in 1997, causing extensive damage.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> With <a href="Fargo,_North_Dakota" title="wikilink">Fargo</a> upstream from the bulk of the waters, and <a href="Winnipeg" class="uri" title="wikilink">Winnipeg</a> with its flood control structures, Grand Forks became the hardest hit city in the <a href="Red_River_Valley" title="wikilink">Red River Valley</a>. During the height of the flooding, a major fire also destroyed eleven buildings in the city's <a href="Downtown_Grand_Forks" title="wikilink">downtown area</a>. One of the buildings destroyed by fire was the office of the <em><a href="Grand_Forks_Herald" title="wikilink">Grand Forks Herald</a></em>, the city's daily newspaper. National media attention and a large donation from <a href="McDonald&#39;s" class="uri" title="wikilink">McDonald's</a> restaurant heiress <a href="Joan_Kroc" title="wikilink">Joan Kroc</a> helped speed the city's recovery. Several neighborhoods had to be completely demolished to make way for a massive new dike system which, when completed in 2006, will protect the community from future flooding. This land bordering the Red River is now known as <a href="The_Greenway_(Greater_Grand_Forks)" title="wikilink">The Greenway</a>, and is being developed as a system of parks.</p>
<h3 id="recent-history">Recent history</h3>
<p>Since the flood, growth and new development has taken place throughout the city. Major projects have included the <a href="Alerus_Center" title="wikilink">Alerus Center</a> (concert venue and home of the UND <a href="North_Dakota_Fighting_Sioux_football" title="wikilink">Fighting Sioux football</a> team), the $100+ million <a href="Ralph_Engelstad_Arena" title="wikilink">Ralph Engelstad Arena</a> (home of the UND <a href="North_Dakota_Fighting_Sioux_hockey" title="wikilink">Fighting Sioux hockey</a> team) on the UND campus, and a number of new commercial projects on the outskirts of town. The city is currently experiencing steady population growth. A large number of homes, townhouses, and apartment buildings have been constructed recently. Most commercial development has taken place along the 32nd Avenue South commercial corridor and around the Ralph Engelstad Arena (an area known as &quot;<a href="University_Village_(Grand_Forks,_North_Dakota)" title="wikilink">University Village</a>&quot;).</p>
<p>Current issues the city is facing include the Spring 2007 opening of a $50 million <a href="Canad_Inns" title="wikilink">Canad Inns</a> hotel and water park complex located adjacent to the Alerus Center, the impact of a realignment at <a href="Grand_Forks_Air_Force_Base" title="wikilink">Grand Forks Air Force Base</a>, and economic growth coupled with a low unemployment rate.</p>
<h2 id="geography">Geography</h2>
<p>Grand Forks is located at  (47.912326, -97.054860).</p>
<p>Grand Forks sits on the western bank of the <a href="Red_River_of_the_North" title="wikilink">Red River of the North</a> in an area known as the <a href="Red_River_Valley" title="wikilink">Red River Valley</a>. The term &quot;Forks&quot; refers to the forking of the Red River with the <a href="Red_Lake_River" title="wikilink">Red Lake River</a>. This junction is located near downtown Grand Forks.</p>
<p>According to the <a href="United_States_Census_Bureau" title="wikilink">United States Census Bureau</a>, the city has a total area of 49.9 <a href="km&lt;U+00B2&gt;" class="uri" title="wikilink">km&lt;U+00B2&gt;</a> (19.2 <a href="square_mile" title="wikilink">mi&lt;U+00B2&gt;</a>), all land.</p>
<p>Since it is in one of the flattest parts of the world, the city has very few differences in elevation.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> There are no lakes in or near Grand Forks. The meandering Red River and the English Coulee flow through the community and provide some break in the terrain. The Red River Valley is the result of an ancient glacier carving its way south during the most recent Ice Age. Once the glacier receded, it formed a glacial lake called <a href="Lake_Agassiz" title="wikilink">Lake Agassiz</a>. The ancient beaches can still be seen as rolling hills west of town.</p>
<p>Grand Forks is 75 miles north of the <a href="Fargo-Moorhead" class="uri" title="wikilink">Fargo-Moorhead</a> area and 143 miles south of <a href="Winnipeg,_Manitoba" title="wikilink">Winnipeg, Manitoba</a>, both along <a href="Interstate_29" title="wikilink">Interstate 29</a> and <a href="U.S._Highway_81" title="wikilink">U.S. Highway 81</a>.</p>

<p>Grand Forks has a number of distinct neighborhoods. The area adjacent to the Red River developed first so this is where some of the oldest neighborhoods, including the downtown area, can be found. The area between downtown and the <a href="University_of_North_Dakota" title="wikilink">University of North Dakota</a> campus was another early growth area and historic properties can be found here as well.</p>
<p><a href="Downtown_Grand_Forks" title="wikilink">Downtown Grand Forks</a> is the oldest part of the city and thus contains many historic buildings.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> It is the governmental center of the city and county. It also sees use as a gathering place for large festivals and a weekly <a href="farmers&#39;_market" title="wikilink">farmers' market</a> during the summer months. There have been several attempts to bring back the major retail and office developments that once filled the downtown landscape, but it has been a hard process. There are now far fewer offices, shops, and restaurants in the area than there were before the push to develop the outskirts of the city. Recently, city leaders and developers have announced plans to convert several older buildings into high-end condos and apartments and to construct some new buildings for the same purpose. Bringing new residents to the downtown area is seen as essential for the revitalization of the area.</p>
<p>Located directly south of downtown, the streets of the Near Southside Historic District are lined with classic houses. Reeves Drive used to be the most fashionable address in the city and, to this day, it is still the home of many old mansions exhibiting several unique architectural styles.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> Also located in this neighborhood are areas of original granitoid paving, several historic churches (including the unusually styled <a href="Art_Deco" title="wikilink">Art Deco</a> United Lutheran), and the newly-developed Lincoln Drive Park. Lincoln Drive was formerly a low-lying residential neighborhood prior to the <a href="Red_River_Flood,_1997" title="wikilink">Flood of 1997</a>. After the flood, the homes in the neighborhood were demolished and the area is now a park. The Near Southside neighborhood was recently granted the &quot;Historic District&quot; designation by the <a href="National_Register_of_Historic_Places" title="wikilink">National Register of Historic Places</a>.</p>
<p>University Avenue used to be a country road connecting the downtown area with the University of North Dakota campus which, at that time, was roughly two miles west of the city. Today, the University Avenue area is a middle-class neighborhood filled with older homes built on tree-lined streets. At the center of the neighborhood sits University Park. In the past, a <a href="tram" title="wikilink">trolley</a> used to run down the middle of University Avenue bringing students from the downtown area to the remote campus. University Avenue is the home of <a href="The_Red_Pepper" title="wikilink">The Red Pepper</a>, a local dining institution with a <a href="cult_following" title="wikilink">cult following</a>.</p>
<h4 id="modern-neighborhoods">Modern neighborhoods</h4>

<p>Modern neighborhoods in Grand Forks are less defined and more spread out than their older counterparts. In general, the newer parts of the city are located in the southern and western parts of town.</p>
<p>The 32nd Avenue South corridor has been the commercial center of the city since the <a href="Columbia_Mall_(Grand_Forks)" title="wikilink">Columbia Mall</a> opened in 1978. Many <a href="big_box" title="wikilink">big box</a> stores, as well as hotels and restaurants, are now located along the avenue. A large strip mall, called the Grand Forks Marketplace, opened in 2001 near the Columbia Mall.</p>
<p><a href="University_Village_(Grand_Forks,_North_Dakota)" title="wikilink">University Village</a> is a new commercial district that was built on formerly vacant lands owned by the University of North Dakota. The centerpiece of the Village is the imposing <a href="Ralph_Engelstad_Arena" title="wikilink">Ralph Engelstad Arena</a> which is used by the University's <a href="North_Dakota_Fighting_Sioux_hockey" title="wikilink">Fighting Sioux hockey</a> team. All of the buildings in the Village have been built in a similar style to buildings on the nearby UND campus. The area now includes several restaurants and stores, as well as the University bookstore. A new <a href="http://wellness.und.edu/building/">Wellness Center</a> for UND students has recently opened on the Village's west side.</p>
<h2 id="demographics">Demographics</h2>

<p>As of the <a href="census" class="uri" title="wikilink">census</a> of 2000, there were 49,321 people (2005 city estimate: 53,230<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a>), 19,677 households, and 11,058 families residing in the city.

<p>Grand Forks uses the <a href="mayor-council_government" title="wikilink">mayor-council</a> model of <a href="municipal_government" title="wikilink">municipal government</a>. The mayor is elected to a four year term and receives a salary of $24,000 per year. The mayor's primary job is to oversee the daily administration of city government and to work directly with department heads to ensure the proper provision of services.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> The current mayor of Grand Forks is <a href="obstetrics" title="wikilink">obstetrician</a> <a href="Michael_Brown_(mayor)" title="wikilink">Dr. Michael Brown</a>. He was first elected in 2000 and was re-elected in 2004.</p>
<p>The city is divided into seven wards with each ward electing a single city council representative for a four year term. Currently, the council consists of only men. The council meets twice each month as the council proper and twice each month as a <a href="committee_of_the_whole" title="wikilink">committee of the whole</a>.

They included: Council President Hal Gershman, Gerald Hamerlik, and Dorette Kerian. Incumbent Gershman ran unopposed and retained control of Ward 4, while Mike McNamara (a local radio talk-show host and Marine serving in the <a href="Iraq_War" title="wikilink">Iraq War</a> at the time of the election) took Ward 2 and Art Bakken won Ward 6. Odd-numbered ward council members and the mayor are up for re-election in 2008.</p>
<p>The political climate in Grand Forks, on average, could best be described as being less conservative than the rest of <a href="North_Dakota" title="wikilink">North Dakota</a>. Democratic-leaning neighborhoods include areas adjacent to downtown and the <a href="University_of_North_Dakota" title="wikilink">University of North Dakota</a> while Republican-leaning sections can be found in the out-lying, suburban areas. In the 2004 presidential election, <a href="George_W._Bush" title="wikilink">George W. Bush</a> captured about 54 percent of the vote - the lowest of any major city in North Dakota. The presence of the University of North Dakota may be one reason why Grand Forks is traditionally less conservative than other places in North Dakota.</p>

<p><img src="LMGlasfiberBlade.jpg" title="fig:Employees at LM Glasfiber work on a giant blade for a wind turbine" alt="Employees at LM Glasfiber work on a giant blade for a wind turbine" width="250" /> The economy of Grand Forks has historically been dependent on the surrounding agricultural lands. However, since the middle part of the 20th century, Grand Forks' economy has become more diversified. Now, government (federal, state, and civic), the health care industry, and a growing manufacturing sector dominate the employment scene in the city.</p>
<p>The <a href="University_of_North_Dakota" title="wikilink">University of North Dakota</a> is the largest employer in the metropolitan area. Nearby <a href="Grand_Forks_Air_Force_Base" title="wikilink">Grand Forks Air Force Base</a> employs a large number of civilian workers in addition to its enlisted personnel. <a href="Altru_Health_System" title="wikilink">Altru Health System</a> is the largest private employer.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<p>Other major employers include manufacturing firms (<a href="LM_Glasfiber" title="wikilink">LM Glasfiber</a>, <a href="Cirrus_Design" title="wikilink">Cirrus Design</a>), call centers (<a href="Amazon.com" class="uri" title="wikilink">Amazon.com</a>, <a href="SEI_Information_Technologies" title="wikilink">SEI Information Technologies</a>), and food producers (<a href="Simplot" title="wikilink">J. R. Simplot Company</a> and the <a href="public_ownership" title="wikilink">state-owned</a> <a href="North_Dakota_Mill_and_Elevator" title="wikilink">North Dakota Mill and Elevator</a>). A substantial number of people are also employed in the city's retail and service sectors.</p>
<p>The city is actively involved in the economic development process, helping existing firms grow and attracting new ones. A portion of sales tax revenues is set aside for this, some of it going into the Grand Forks Growth Fund. Companies can request low-interest loans or grants from this fund provided they meet certain criteria, such as paying a relatively high wage and doing most of their business outside the city's trade region. Cirrus Design and Amazon.com have dealt with the Growth Fund.</p>
<p>The city also contributes to the <a href="http://www.grandforks.org/">Grand Forks Region Economic Development Corporation</a> (EDC), a public-private organization that also receives funding from banks and other major businesses. The EDC plays a consulting role for businesses, such as identifying suitable sites for expansion or assembling public funding packages. Its other key role is to vet businesses to see if they're suitable for funding by the Growth Fund.</p>
<p>UND has long been seen by community leaders as an &quot;economic engine&quot; for the city. Besides its regular faculty, it also has business-like components such as the <a href="Energy_and_Environmental_Research_Center" title="wikilink">Energy and Environmental Research Center</a>, which has contracts all over the world. UND hosts a technology incubator called the <a href="http://www.innovators.net/">Center for Innovation</a>. More recently, the University has been working to commercialize its research. A major thrust in that direction is the construction of a research park on the western fringes of the campus. The first building in the park, when completed, will house a &quot;germ lab&quot; capable of supporting medical research. The lab, and the building as a whole, will feature a high level of security. This will also allow for defense-related research.</p>
<p>Another economic opportunity for the city is the addition of the <a href="unmanned_aerial_vehicle" title="wikilink">unmanned aerial vehicle</a> (UAV) mission to Grand Forks Air Force Base. Economic development officials hope the huge emphasis the Air Force is putting on UAVs will attract new businesses to Grand Forks. The base currently hosts <a href="KC-135_Stratotanker" title="wikilink">KC-135 Stratotankers</a>, which will gradually be transferred to other bases around the country.</p>
<p>Depending on the relative strength of the Canadian dollar versus its American counterpart, the Greater Grand Forks area may also attract significant numbers of tourist shoppers from <a href="Manitoba" class="uri" title="wikilink">Manitoba</a> and especially from <a href="Winnipeg,_Manitoba" title="wikilink">Winnipeg</a> (about 140 miles north of Grand Forks). Grand Forks is a popular weekend getaway destination for many Manitobans. This is reflected in the large number of hotels built over the last 20 years near major retail nodes on the south side of Grand Forks.</p>

<p>Grand Forks has an active <a href="town_twinning" title="wikilink">sister city</a> program designed to encourage cultural and economic exchanges. In the case of <a href="Dickinson,_North_Dakota" title="wikilink">Dickinson, North Dakota</a>, the relationship is also a kind of political alliance.</p>
<p>Grand Forks' first sister city was <a href="Ishim" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ishim</a> in the <a href="Soviet_Union" title="wikilink">Soviet Union</a>. The relationship with the <a href="Siberia" title="wikilink">Siberian</a> city formally began in 1984 during the <a href="Cold_War" title="wikilink">Cold War</a>, but progressed slowly due to red tape. In fact, the first in-person exchanges didn't happen until 1990, following <a href="glasnost" class="uri" title="wikilink">glasnost</a>. More exchanges followed despite the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991. Sometime in the late 1990s, though, political and economic turmoil in <a href="Russia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Russia</a> put the relationship in deep freeze from which it has yet to recover.</p>
<p>While the relationship with Ishim faded, Grand Forks found a new sister in <a href="Awano,_Tochigi" title="wikilink">Awano</a>, <a href="Japan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Japan</a>. An informal relationship began in 1994 when the school districts of both cities began exchanging students. The bond strengthened after the 1997 flood devastated Grand Forks. Awano, a city of 10,000, sent $26,000 to help Grand Forks. In 1998, the two formally proclaimed themselves sisters. The most concrete evidence of the warm relationship between the two is a Japanese rock garden in Grand Forks' Sertoma Park and a sculpture of an <a href="American_bison" title="wikilink">American bison</a> in an Awano park. They're gifts the sister cities gave one another.</p>
<p>Awano is no longer a sister city, however, because it is no longer a city. The nearby city of <a href="Kanuma,_Tochigi" title="wikilink">Kanuma</a> recently annexed Awano, a smaller city. Kanuma city leaders say they already have a sister city in Australia and can't afford another one. The student exchange is expected to continue, though every other year instead of annually.</p>
<p>Grand Forks' relationship with Dickinson, North Dakota began in 2002, when delegations from each city visited the other. The Greater Grand Forks Convention and Visitors Bureau organized the exchange with its counterpart in Dickinson to showcase tourist attractions and improve cooperation in promoting statewide tourism. There's also a political component. Grand Forks Mayor <a href="Michael_Brown_(mayor)" title="wikilink">Michael Brown</a> has said he thinks having friends in western North Dakota, which typically has diverging interests from eastern cities, would help at the state legislature.</p>
<p><a href="Sarpsborg" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sarpsborg</a>, <a href="Norway" class="uri" title="wikilink">Norway</a> became a sister city in 2005 following several exchanges among leaders from both cities. Located southeast of <a href="Oslo,_Norway" title="wikilink">Oslo</a>, Sarpsborg is a city with a similar sized population to Grand Forks. Mayor Brown has said he values sisterhood with Sarpsborg because his city is home to so many descendants of Norwegian immigrants. The Grand Forks School District has announced plans to teach Norwegian language classes in the high schools though no exchange programs have been announced.</p>
<h2 id="health-care">Health care</h2>
<p>With 3,500 employees and over 160 physicians, <a href="Altru_Health_System" title="wikilink">Altru Health System</a> is the major provider of health care within Grand Forks and the surrounding region and is also the largest private employer in Grand Forks.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> Altru's 90-acre medical campus near the center of the city offers a 240-bed acute care hospital, a 40-bed rehabilitation hospital, and several clinics. Altru recently announced plans to spend $100 million dollars to upgrade and expand their facilities. Around 40 physicians and 400 other personnel will also be added to the Altru staff. Altru Hospital, formerly called United Hospital, is the result of a 1971 merger of Grand Forks' Deaconess Hospital and St. Michael's Hospital.</p>
<p>Grand Forks has long had just one major healthcare provider, but recently a new medical campus has been developing on the south side of the city. Facilities in the development currently include the Stadter Center (a 70-bed psychiatric hospital) and a two story clinic called Aurora Medical Park. Individual spaces within the clinic building are leased out to private medical practices. In early April of 2007, it was announced that a $60 million dollar, 70-bed, &quot;small full-service hospital&quot; called <a href="Aurora_Hospital" title="wikilink">Aurora Hospital</a> would be built on the medical campus.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>

The U.S. Highway 81 business route, Washington Street, runs through many of the city's major commercial districts.</p>
<p>The city maintains a bus system called Cities Area Transit (or CAT). The system has operated since 1926 when it was introduced to replace an earlier <a href="tram" title="wikilink">trolley</a> system (in homage to which, the city now operates a bus that looks like a trolley). There are currently eleven bus routes including night service and service in the community of <a href="East_Grand_Forks,_Minnesota" title="wikilink">East Grand Forks</a>. The Metro Area Transit Center is located downtown on Kittson Avenue. It is essentially the &quot;depot&quot; and main connecting point of the system. CAT is considered to be the best fixed-route public transit service in the state of <a href="North_Dakota" title="wikilink">North Dakota</a>, and was used as a model when <a href="Bismarck-Mandan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bismarck-Mandan</a> launched a &quot;Capital Area Transit&quot; service in 2004. Grand Forks is served by two taxi companies: Grand Forks Taxi and Nodak Radio Cab Company.</p>
<p>The older sections of Grand Forks are structured in the classic grid street system. In Grand Forks, roads that run from north to south are traditionally called &quot;streets&quot; and roads that run from east to west are traditionally called &quot;avenues.&quot; Streets are numbered in blocks west of the <a href="Red_River_of_the_North" title="wikilink">Red River</a>. Avenues are numbered in blocks north or south of Demers Avenue (the city's historic dividing route adjacent to the rail yards).</p>
