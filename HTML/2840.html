<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<h3 id="origin-of-the-concept">Origin of the concept</h3>

<p>The <a href="teleological_argument" title="wikilink">teleological argument</a>, also known as the design argument, is one of three basic religious arguments for the existence of God which have been advanced for centuries (the others being the <a href="ontological_argument" title="wikilink">ontological argument</a> and the <a href="cosmological_argument" title="wikilink">cosmological argument</a>). In the 13th century <a href="Thomas_Aquinas" title="wikilink">Thomas Aquinas</a> argued that natural things act to achieve the best result, and as they cannot do this without intelligence, an intelligent being must exist, setting the goal and providing direction, and this being is God. The version formulated in 1802 by the <a href="theology" title="wikilink">theologian</a> <a href="William_Paley" title="wikilink">William Paley</a> used the <a href="watchmaker_analogy" title="wikilink">watchmaker analogy</a> to argue that complexity and <a href="adaptation" class="uri" title="wikilink">adaptation</a> in nature demonstrated God's benevolent and perfect design, for the good of humans. Paley's <a href="natural_theology" title="wikilink">natural theology</a> strongly influenced scientists of the time, including <a href="Charles_Darwin" title="wikilink">Charles Darwin</a>, who began with the assumption that God had designed nature and were open to a <a href="deism" title="wikilink">deistic</a> interpretation that this design was implemented by laws. While Darwin's <a href="natural_selection" title="wikilink">natural selection</a> explained complexity and adaptation without the need for a designer, he was still inclined to think that everything resulted from designed laws,<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> by which Nature's God shaped life. Intelligent design has Paley's religious argument from design at its centre, but unlike Paley's openness to deistic design through God given laws, the point of intelligent design is to seek scientific confirmation of repeated miraculous interventions in the history of life.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<p>By 1910 evolution was not a topic of major religious controversy in America, but in the 1920s <a href="Fundamentalist_Christianity" title="wikilink">Fundamentalist Christianity</a> engaged in the <a href="Fundamentalist&lt;U+2013&gt;Modernist_Controversy" title="wikilink">Fundamentalist&lt;U+2013&gt;Modernist Controversy</a> took up opposition to evolution,<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> and effectively suspended teaching of evolution in U.S. public schools. In the 1960s, after evolution was reintroduced into the curriculum, <a href="Young_Earth_creationism" title="wikilink">Young Earth creationists</a> promoted <a href="Creation_Science" title="wikilink">Creation Science</a> as &quot;an alternative scientific explanation of the world in which we live&quot;, which frequently invoked the design argument to explain complexity in nature. These explanations prefigured the intelligent design arguments of <a href="irreducible_complexity" title="wikilink">irreducible complexity</a>, even featuring the bacterial <a href="flagellum" class="uri" title="wikilink">flagellum</a>. Attempts to introduce this in schools led to court rulings that Creation Science is religious in nature, and thus cannot be taught in public school science classrooms. Intelligent design is also presented as science invoking Paley's religious argument from design. It shares other arguments with Creation Science but differs in avoiding overt literal Biblical references such as the age of the Earth and <a href="Noah&#39;s_Flood" title="wikilink">Noah's Flood</a>.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
<p><a href="Barbara_Forrest" title="wikilink">Barbara Forrest</a> writes that the intelligent design movement began in 1984 with the publication by Jon A. Buell's the <a href="Foundation_for_Thought_and_Ethics" title="wikilink">Foundation for Thought and Ethics</a> of <em>The Mystery of Life's Origin</em> by <a href="Charles_B._Thaxton" title="wikilink">Charles B.

Thaxton held a conference in 1988, &quot;Sources of Information Content in DNA&quot;, which attracted creationists such as <a href="Stephen_C._Meyer" title="wikilink">Stephen C. Meyer</a>.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
<p>In March 1986, a review by Meyer used information theory to suggest that messages transmitted by DNA in the cell show &quot;specified complexity&quot; specified by intelligence, and must have originated with an intelligent agent.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> In November of that year Thaxton described his reasoning as a more sophisticated form of Paley's argument from design.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> At the <em>Sources of Information Content in DNA</em> conference in 1988 he said that his intelligent cause view was compatible with both <a href="metaphysical_naturalism" title="wikilink">metaphysical naturalism</a> and supernaturalism.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>

<p><img src="MichaelBehe.jpg" title="fig:The concept of irreducible complexity was popularised by Michael Behe, in his 1996 book, Darwin&#39;s Black Box." alt="The concept of irreducible complexity was popularised by Michael Behe, in his 1996 book, Darwin&#39;s Black Box." /> The term &quot;irreducible complexity&quot; was introduced by biochemist <a href="Michael_Behe" title="wikilink">Michael Behe</a> in his 1996 book <em><a href="Darwin&#39;s_Black_Box" title="wikilink">Darwin's Black Box</a></em>, though he had already described the concept in his contributions to the 1993 revised edition of <em>Of Pandas and People</em>.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> Behe defines it as &quot;a single system which is composed of several well-matched interacting parts that contribute to the basic function, wherein the removal of any one of the parts causes the system to effectively cease functioning&quot;.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a></p>
<p>Behe uses the analogy of a mousetrap to illustrate this concept. A mousetrap consists of several interacting pieces&lt;U+2014&gt;the base, the catch, the spring and the hammer&lt;U+2014&gt;all of which must be in place for the mousetrap to work. Removal of any one piece destroys the function of the mousetrap. Intelligent design advocates assert that natural selection could not create irreducibly complex systems, because the selectable function is present only when all parts are assembled. Behe argued that irreducibly complex biological mechanisms include the bacterial flagellum of <em><a href="Escherichia_coli" title="wikilink">E. coli</a></em>, the blood clotting cascade, <a href="cilia" class="uri" title="wikilink">cilia</a>, and the adaptive <a href="immune_system" title="wikilink">immune system</a>.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a><a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a></p>

Furthermore, they argue, evolution often proceeds by altering preexisting parts or by removing them from a system, rather than by adding them. This is sometimes called the &quot;scaffolding objection&quot; by an analogy with scaffolding, which can support an &quot;irreducibly complex&quot; building until it is complete and able to stand on its own.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a> Behe has acknowledged using &quot;sloppy prose&quot;, and that his &quot;argument against Darwinism does not add up to a logical proof&quot;.<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> Irreducible complexity has remained a popular argument among advocates of intelligent design; in the <a href="Kitzmiller_v._Dover_Area_School_District" title="wikilink">Dover trial</a>, the court held that &quot;Professor Behe's claim for irreducible complexity has been refuted in peer-reviewed research papers and has been rejected by the scientific community at large&quot;.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="specified-complexity">Specified complexity</h3>

<p>In 1986 <a href="Charles_Thaxton" title="wikilink">Charles Thaxton</a>, a physical chemist and creationist, used the term &quot;specified complexity&quot; from <a href="information_theory" title="wikilink">information theory</a> when claiming that messages transmitted by DNA in the cell were specified by intelligence, and must have originated with an intelligent agent.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a> The intelligent design concept of &quot;specified complexity&quot; was developed in the 1990s by mathematician, philosopher, and theologian <a href="William_Dembski" title="wikilink">William Dembski</a>.<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a> Dembski, Research Professor of Philosophy and Director of the Center for Cultural Engagement at Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary, states that when something exhibits specified complexity (i.e., is both complex and &quot;specified&quot;, simultaneously), one can infer that it was produced by an intelligent cause (i.e., that it was designed) rather than being the result of natural processes. He provides the following examples: &quot;A single letter of the alphabet is specified without being complex. A long sentence of random letters is complex without being specified. A <a href="Shakespearean" class="uri" title="wikilink">Shakespearean</a> <a href="sonnet" class="uri" title="wikilink">sonnet</a> is both complex and specified&quot;.<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a> He states that details of living things can be similarly characterized, especially the &quot;patterns&quot; of molecular sequences in functional biological molecules such as <a href="DNA" class="uri" title="wikilink">DNA</a>.</p>
<p><img src="Dembski_head_shot.jpg" title="fig:William Dembski proposed the concept of specified complexity." alt="William Dembski proposed the concept of specified complexity." width="140" /> Dembski defines <a href="complex_specified_information" title="wikilink">complex specified information</a> (CSI) as anything with a less than 1 in 10<sup>150</sup> chance of occurring by (natural) chance. Critics say that this renders the argument a <a href="Tautology_(rhetoric)" title="wikilink">tautology</a>: complex specified information cannot occur naturally because Dembski has defined it thus, so the real question becomes whether or not CSI actually exists in nature.<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a><a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a><a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a></p>
<p>The conceptual soundness of Dembski's specified complexity/CSI argument has been discredited in the scientific and mathematical communities.<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a><a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a> Specified complexity has yet to be shown to have wide applications in other fields, as Dembski asserts. John Wilkins and <a href="Wesley_R._Elsberry" title="wikilink">Wesley Elsberry</a> characterize Dembski's &quot;explanatory filter&quot; as <em>eliminative</em>, because it eliminates explanations sequentially: first regularity, then chance, finally defaulting to design. They argue that this procedure is flawed as a model for scientific inference because the asymmetric way it treats the different possible explanations renders it prone to making false conclusions.<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a></p>
<p><a href="Richard_Dawkins" title="wikilink">Richard Dawkins</a>, another critic of intelligent design, argues in <em><a href="The_God_Delusion" title="wikilink">The God Delusion</a></em> that allowing for an intelligent designer to account for unlikely complexity only postpones the problem, as such a designer would need to be at least as complex.<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a> Other scientists have argued that evolution through selection is better able to explain the observed complexity, as is evident from the use of selective evolution to design certain electronic, aeronautic and automotive systems that are considered problems too complex for human &quot;intelligent designers&quot;.<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="fine-tuned-universe">Fine-tuned Universe</h3>

<p>Intelligent design proponents have also occasionally appealed to broader teleological arguments outside of biology, most notably an argument based on the <a href="Fine-tuned_universe" title="wikilink">fine-tuning of universal constants</a> that make matter and life possible and which are argued not to be solely attributable to chance. These include the values of <a href="fundamental_physical_constants" title="wikilink">fundamental physical constants</a>, the relative strength of <a href="nuclear_force" title="wikilink">nuclear forces</a>, <a href="electromagnetism" class="uri" title="wikilink">electromagnetism</a>, and <a href="gravity" class="uri" title="wikilink">gravity</a> between <a href="fundamental_particles" title="wikilink">fundamental particles</a>, as well as the ratios of masses of such particles. Intelligent design proponent and <a href="Center_for_Science_and_Culture" title="wikilink">Center for Science and Culture</a> fellow <a href="Guillermo_Gonzalez_(astronomer)" title="wikilink">Guillermo Gonzalez</a> argues that if any of these values were even slightly different, the universe would be dramatically different, making it impossible for many <a href="chemical_elements" title="wikilink">chemical elements</a> and features of the <a href="Universe" class="uri" title="wikilink">Universe</a>, such as <a href="galaxies" class="uri" title="wikilink">galaxies</a>, to form.<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a> Thus, proponents argue, an intelligent designer of life was needed to ensure that the requisite features were present to achieve that particular outcome.</p>
<p>Scientists have generally responded that these arguments are poorly supported by existing evidence.<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a><a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a> <a href="Victor_J._Stenger" title="wikilink">Victor J.

<h3 id="intelligent-designer">Intelligent designer</h3>

<p>Intelligent design arguments are formulated in secular terms and intentionally avoid identifying the intelligent agent (or agents) they posit. Although they do not state that God is the designer, the designer is often implicitly hypothesized to have intervened in a way that only a god could intervene. Dembski, in <em><a href="The_Design_Inference" title="wikilink">The Design Inference</a></em>, speculates that an alien culture could fulfill these requirements. <em><a href="Of_Pandas_and_People" title="wikilink">Of Pandas and People</a></em> proposes that <a href="SETI" class="uri" title="wikilink">SETI</a> illustrates an appeal to intelligent design in science. In 2000, philosopher of science <a href="Robert_T._Pennock" title="wikilink">Robert T. Pennock</a> suggested the <a href="Ra&lt;U+00EB&gt;lian_beliefs_and_practices" title="wikilink">Ra&lt;U+00EB&gt;lian</a> <a href="UFO" class="uri" title="wikilink">UFO</a> religion as a real-life example of an extraterrestrial intelligent designer view that &quot;make[s] many of the same bad arguments against evolutionary theory as creationists&quot;.<a href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a> The authoritative description of intelligent design,<a href="#fn67" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a> however, explicitly states that the <em>Universe</em> displays features of having been designed. Acknowledging the <a href="paradox" class="uri" title="wikilink">paradox</a>, Dembski concludes that &quot;no intelligent agent who is strictly physical could have presided over the origin of the universe or the origin of life&quot;.<a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a> The leading proponents have made statements to their supporters that they believe the designer to be the <a href="God_in_Christianity" title="wikilink">Christian god</a>, to the exclusion of all other religions.<a href="#fn69" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref69"><sup>69</sup></a><a href="#fn70" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a></p>
<p>Beyond the debate over whether intelligent design is scientific, a number of critics argue that existing evidence makes the design hypothesis appear unlikely, irrespective of its status in the world of science. For example, <a href="Jerry_Coyne" title="wikilink">Jerry Coyne</a> asks why a designer would &quot;give us a pathway for making <a href="vitamin_C" title="wikilink">vitamin C</a>, but then destroy it by disabling one of its enzymes&quot; (see <a href="pseudogene" class="uri" title="wikilink">pseudogene</a>) and why he or she would not &quot;stock oceanic islands with reptiles, mammals, amphibians, and freshwater fish, despite the suitability of such islands for these species&quot;. Coyne also points to the fact that &quot;the flora and fauna on those islands resemble that of the nearest mainland, even when the environments are very different&quot; as evidence that species were not placed there by a designer.<ref name="CoyneTNR"></p>

<p></ref> Previously, in <em><a href="Darwin&#39;s_Black_Box" title="wikilink">Darwin's Black Box</a></em>, Behe had argued that we are simply incapable of understanding the designer's motives, so such questions cannot be answered definitively. Odd designs could, for example, &quot;have been placed there by the designer ... for artistic reasons, to show off, for some as-yet undetectable practical purpose, or for some unguessable reason&quot;. Coyne responds that in light of the evidence, &quot;either life resulted not from intelligent design, but from evolution; or the intelligent designer is a cosmic prankster who designed everything to make it look as though it had evolved&quot;.<a href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a></p>
<p>Intelligent design proponents such as <a href="Paul_Nelson_(creationist)" title="wikilink">Paul Nelson</a> avoid the <a href="Argument_from_poor_design" title="wikilink">problem of poor design in nature</a> by insisting that we have simply failed to understand the perfection of the design. Behe cites Paley as his inspiration, but he differs from Paley's expectation of a perfect Creation and proposes that designers do not necessarily produce the best design they can. Behe suggests that, like a parent not wanting to spoil a child with extravagant toys, the designer can have multiple motives for not giving priority to excellence in engineering. He says that &quot;the argument for imperfection critically depends on a psychoanalysis of the unidentified designer. Yet the reasons that a designer would or would not do anything are virtually impossible to know unless the designer tells you specifically what those reasons are.&quot; This reliance on inexplicable motives of the designer makes intelligent design scientifically untestable. <a href="Phillip_E._Johnson" title="wikilink">Phillip E. Johnson</a> puts forward a core definition that the designer creates for a purpose, giving the example that in his view <a href="AIDS" class="uri" title="wikilink">AIDS</a> was created to punish immorality and was not caused by <a href="HIV" class="uri" title="wikilink">HIV</a>, but such motives cannot be tested by scientific methods.<a href="#fn72" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref72"><sup>72</sup></a></p>
<p>Asserting the need for a designer of complexity also raises the question &quot;What designed the designer?&quot;<a href="#fn73" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref73"><sup>73</sup></a> Intelligent design proponents say that the question is irrelevant to or outside the scope of intelligent design.<a href="#fn74" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref74"><sup>74</sup></a> Richard Wein counters that the unanswered questions an explanation creates &quot;must be balanced against the improvements in our understanding which the explanation provides. Invoking an unexplained being to explain the origin of other beings (ourselves) is little more than <a href="Begging_the_question" title="wikilink">question-begging</a>. The new question raised by the explanation is as problematic as the question which the explanation purports to answer&quot;.<a href="#fn75" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref75"><sup>75</sup></a> Richard Dawkins sees the assertion that the designer does not need to be explained, not as a contribution to knowledge, but as a <a href="thought-terminating_clich&lt;U+00E9&gt;" title="wikilink">thought-terminating clich&lt;U+00E9&gt;</a>.<ref name="Rosenhouse"></p>

<p></ref><ref> </p>
<p></ref> In the absence of observable, measurable evidence, the very question &quot;What designed the designer?&quot; leads to an <a href="turtles_all_the_way_down" title="wikilink">infinite regression</a> from which intelligent design proponents can only escape by resorting to religious creationism or logical contradiction.<ref></p>

The pragmatics of a scientific theory can, to be sure, be pursued without recourse to Christ. But the conceptual soundness of the theory can in the end only be located in Christ.&quot;<a href="#fn97" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref97"><sup>97</sup></a> Dembski also stated, &quot;ID is part of God's <a href="general_revelation" title="wikilink">general revelation</a> [...] Not only does intelligent design rid us of this ideology (<a href="materialism" class="uri" title="wikilink">materialism</a>), which suffocates the human spirit, but, in my personal experience, I've found that it opens the path for people to come to Christ&quot;.<ref> </p>
<p></ref> Both Johnson and Dembski cite the Bible's <a href="Gospel_of_John" title="wikilink">Gospel of John</a> as the foundation of intelligent design.<a href="#fn98" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref98"><sup>98</sup></a><a href="#fn99" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref99"><sup>99</sup></a></p>
<p>Barbara Forrest contends such statements reveal that leading proponents see intelligent design as essentially religious in nature, not merely a scientific concept that has implications with which their personal religious beliefs happen to coincide.<a href="#fn100" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref100"><sup>100</sup></a> She writes that the leading proponents of intelligent design are closely allied with the ultra-conservative <a href="Christian_Reconstructionism" title="wikilink">Christian Reconstructionism</a> movement.

<p>Not all creationist organizations have embraced the intelligent design movement. According to Thomas Dixon, &quot;Religious leaders have come out against ID too. An open letter affirming the compatibility of Christian faith and the teaching of evolution, first produced in response to controversies in Wisconsin in 2004, has now been signed by over ten thousand clergy from different Christian denominations across America. In 2006, the director of the Vatican Observatory, the Jesuit astronomer George Coyne, condemned ID as a kind of 'crude creationism' which reduced God to a mere engineer.&quot;<a href="#fn102" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref102"><sup>102</sup></a> <a href="Hugh_Ross_(creationist)" title="wikilink">Hugh Ross</a> of Reasons to Believe, a proponent of <a href="Old_Earth_creationism" title="wikilink">Old Earth creationism</a>, believes that the efforts of intelligent design proponents to divorce the concept from Biblical Christianity make its hypothesis too vague. In 2002 he wrote: &quot;Winning the argument for design without identifying the designer yields, at best, a sketchy origins model. Such a model makes little if any positive impact on the community of scientists and other scholars&lt;U+2026&gt; The time is right for a direct approach, a single leap into the origins fray. Introducing a biblically based, scientifically verifiable creation model represents such a leap.&quot;<a href="#fn103" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref103"><sup>103</sup></a></p>
<p>Likewise, two of the most prominent <a href="Young_Earth_creationism" title="wikilink">Young Earth creationism</a> organizations in the world have attempted to distinguish their views from intelligent design. Henry M. Morris of the <a href="Institute_for_Creation_Research" title="wikilink">Institute for Creation Research</a> (ICR) wrote, in 1999, that ID, &quot;even if well-meaning and effectively articulated, will not work! It has often been tried in the past and has failed, and it will fail today. The reason it won't work is because it is not the Biblical method.&quot; According to Morris: &quot;The evidence of intelligent design&lt;U+2026&gt; must be either followed by or accompanied by a sound presentation of true Biblical creationism if it is to be meaningful and lasting.&quot;<a href="#fn104" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref104"><sup>104</sup></a> In 2002, Carl Wieland, then of <a href="Answers_in_Genesis" title="wikilink">Answers in Genesis</a> (AiG), criticized design advocates who, though well-intentioned, &quot;left the Bible out of it&quot; and thereby unwittingly aided and abetted the modern rejection of the Bible. Wieland explained that &quot;AiG's major 'strategy' is to boldly, but humbly, call the church back to its Biblical foundations&lt;U+2026&gt; [so] we neither count ourselves a part of this movement nor campaign against it.&quot;<a href="#fn105" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref105"><sup>105</sup></a></p>

<p>Several surveys were conducted prior to the December 2005 decision in <em>Kitzmiller v. Dover</em>, which sought to determine the level of support for intelligent design among certain groups. According to a 2005 <a href="Harris_Interactive" title="wikilink">Harris poll</a>, 10% of adults in the United States viewed human beings as &quot;so complex that they required a powerful force or intelligent being to help create them&quot;.<a href="#fn109" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref109"><sup>109</sup></a> Although <a href="John_Zogby" title="wikilink">Zogby polls</a> commissioned by the Discovery Institute show more support, these polls suffer from considerable flaws, such as having a very low response rate (248 out of 16,000), being conducted on behalf of an organization with an expressed interest in the outcome of the poll, and containing <a href="leading_question" title="wikilink">leading questions</a>.<a href="#fn110" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref110"><sup>110</sup></a><a href="#fn111" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref111"><sup>111</sup></a><a href="#fn112" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref112"><sup>112</sup></a></p>

<p>Advocates of intelligent design seek to keep God and the Bible out of the discussion, and present intelligent design in the language of science as though it were a scientific hypothesis.<a href="#fn117" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref117"><sup>117</sup></a><a href="#fn118" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref118"><sup>118</sup></a> For a theory to qualify as scientific,<a href="#fn119" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref119"><sup>119</sup></a><a href="#fn120" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref120"><sup>120</sup></a><a href="#fn121" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref121"><sup>121</sup></a> it is expected to be:</p>

<li>Useful (describes and explains observed phenomena, and can be used in a predictive manner)</li>
<li>Empirically testable and <a href="Falsifiability" title="wikilink">falsifiable</a> (potentially confirmable or disprovable by experiment or observation)</li>

</ul>
<p>For any theory, hypothesis or conjecture to be considered scientific, it must meet most, and ideally all, of these criteria. The fewer criteria are met, the less scientific it is; and if it meets only a few or none at all, then it cannot be treated as scientific in any meaningful sense of the word. Typical objections to defining intelligent design as science are that it lacks consistency,<a href="#fn122" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref122"><sup>122</sup></a> violates the principle of parsimony,<a href="#fn123" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref123"><sup>123</sup></a> is not scientifically useful,<a href="#fn124" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref124"><sup>124</sup></a> is not falsifiable,<a href="#fn125" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref125"><sup>125</sup></a> is not empirically testable,<a href="#fn126" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref126"><sup>126</sup></a> and is not correctable, dynamic, provisional or progressive.<a href="#fn127" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref127"><sup>127</sup></a><a href="#fn128" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref128"><sup>128</sup></a><a href="#fn129" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref129"><sup>129</sup></a></p>
<p>Intelligent design proponents seek to change this fundamental basis of science<a href="#fn130" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref130"><sup>130</sup></a> by eliminating &quot;<a href="Naturalism_(philosophy)" title="wikilink">methodological naturalism</a>&quot; from science<a href="#fn131" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref131"><sup>131</sup></a> and replacing it with what the leader of the intelligent design movement, <a href="Phillip_E._Johnson" title="wikilink">Phillip E.

<p>The failure to follow the procedures of scientific discourse and the failure to submit work to the scientific community that withstands scrutiny have weighed against intelligent design being accepted as valid science.<a href="#fn134" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref134"><sup>134</sup></a> The intelligent design movement has not published a properly peer-reviewed article supporting ID in a scientific journal, and has failed to publish supporting peer-reviewed research or data.<a href="#fn135" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref135"><sup>135</sup></a> The only article published in a peer-reviewed scientific journal that made a case for intelligent design was <a href="Sternberg_peer_review_controversy" title="wikilink">quickly withdrawn by the publisher</a> for having circumvented the journal's peer-review standards.<a href="#fn136" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref136"><sup>136</sup></a> The Discovery Institute says that a number of intelligent design articles have been published in peer-reviewed journals,<a href="#fn137" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref137"><sup>137</sup></a> but critics, largely members of the scientific community, reject this claim and state intelligent design proponents have set up their own journals with peer review that lack impartiality and rigor,<a href="#fn138" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref138"><sup>138</sup></a> consisting entirely of intelligent design supporters.<a href="#fn139" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref139"><sup>139</sup></a></p>
<p>Further criticism stems from the fact that the phrase <em>intelligent</em> design makes use of an assumption of the quality of an observable intelligence, a concept that has no <a href="scientific_consensus" title="wikilink">scientific consensus</a> definition. William Dembski, for example, has written that &quot;Intelligence leaves behind a characteristic signature&quot;. The characteristics of intelligence are assumed by intelligent design proponents to be observable without specifying what the criteria for the measurement of intelligence should be. Critics say that the design detection methods proposed by intelligent design proponents are radically different from conventional design detection, undermining the key elements that make it possible as legitimate science. Intelligent design proponents, they say, are proposing both searching for a designer without knowing anything about that designer's abilities, parameters, or intentions (which scientists do know when searching for the results of human intelligence), as well as denying the very distinction between natural/artificial design that allows scientists to compare complex designed artifacts against the background of the sorts of complexity found in nature.<a href="#fn140" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref140"><sup>140</sup></a></p>
<p>Among a significant proportion of the general public in the United States, the major concern is whether conventional evolutionary biology is compatible with belief in God and in the Bible, and how this issue is taught in schools.<a href="#fn141" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref141"><sup>141</sup></a> The Discovery Institute's &quot;Teach the Controversy&quot; campaign promotes intelligent design while attempting to discredit evolution in United States public high school science courses.<a href="#fn142" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref142"><sup>142</sup></a><a href="#fn143" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref143"><sup>143</sup></a><a href="#fn144" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref144"><sup>144</sup></a><a href="#fn145" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref145"><sup>145</sup></a><a href="#fn146" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref146"><sup>146</sup></a><a href="#fn147" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref147"><sup>147</sup></a> The scientific community and science education organizations have replied that there is no scientific controversy regarding the validity of evolution and that the controversy exists solely in terms of religion and politics.<a href="#fn148" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref148"><sup>148</sup></a><a href="#fn149" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref149"><sup>149</sup></a><a href="#fn150" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref150"><sup>150</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="arguments-from-ignorance">Arguments from ignorance</h3>
<p><a href="Eugenie_Scott" title="wikilink">Eugenie Scott</a>, along with Glenn Branch and other critics, has argued that many points raised by intelligent design proponents are <a href="Argument_from_ignorance" title="wikilink">arguments from ignorance</a>. In the argument from ignorance, a lack of evidence for one view is erroneously argued to constitute proof of the correctness of another view. Scott and Branch say that intelligent design is an argument from ignorance because it relies on a lack of knowledge for its conclusion: lacking a natural explanation for certain specific aspects of evolution, we assume intelligent cause. They contend most scientists would reply that the unexplained is not unexplainable, and that &quot;we don't know yet&quot; is a more appropriate response than invoking a cause outside science. Particularly, <a href="Michael_Behe" title="wikilink">Michael Behe</a>'s demands for ever more detailed explanations of the historical evolution of molecular systems seem to assume a <a href="false_dichotomy" title="wikilink">false dichotomy</a>, where either evolution or design is the proper explanation, and any perceived failure of evolution becomes a victory for design. Scott and Branch also contend that the supposedly novel contributions proposed by intelligent design proponents have not served as the basis for any productive scientific research.<ref name="2002-09-10"></p>

<p></ref></p>
<p>In his conclusion to the Kitzmiller trial, Judge Jones wrote that &quot;ID is at bottom premised upon a false dichotomy, namely, that to the extent evolutionary theory is discredited, ID is confirmed.&quot; This same argument had been put forward to support <a href="creation_science" title="wikilink">creation science</a> at the <em><a href="McLean_v._Arkansas" title="wikilink">McLean v. Arkansas</a></em> trial which found it was &quot;contrived dualism&quot;, the false premise of a &quot;two-model approach&quot;. Behe's argument of irreducible complexity puts forward negative arguments against evolution but does not make any positive scientific case for intelligent design. It fails to allow for scientific explanations continuing to be found, as has been the case with several examples previously put forward as supposed cases of irreducible complexity.<a href="#fn151" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref151"><sup>151</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="theological-issues">Theological issues</h3>
<p>The insistence of intelligent design on repeated miraculous interventions rather than designed laws raises theological difficulties for those who believe that God's design must be perfect and should not need such changes. The claim to be scientific implies that science can test religion, and the <a href="problem_of_evil" title="wikilink">problem of evil</a> raises the issue of a lack of miraculous intervention to reduce suffering.<a href="#fn152" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref152"><sup>152</sup></a> Intelligent design proponents avoid the problem of <a href="Argument_from_poor_design" title="wikilink">poor design in nature</a> by insisting that we have simply failed to understand the perfection of the design, or by proposing that designers do not necessarily produce the best design they can, and may have unknowable motives for their actions.<a href="#fn153" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref153"><sup>153</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="god-of-the-gaps">God of the gaps</h3>
<p>Intelligent design has also been characterized as a <a href="God_of_the_gaps" title="wikilink">God-of-the-gaps</a> argument,<a href="#fn154" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref154"><sup>154</sup></a> which has the following form:</p>

<p>:*The gap is filled with acts of God (or <a href="intelligent_designer" title="wikilink">intelligent designer</a>) and therefore proves the existence of God (or intelligent designer).<a href="#fn155" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref155"><sup>155</sup></a></p>
<p>A God-of-the-gaps argument is the <a href="theological" class="uri" title="wikilink">theological</a> version of an <a href="argument_from_ignorance" title="wikilink">argument from ignorance</a>.

<p>On December 20, 2005, Judge Jones issued his 139-page <a href="finding_of_fact" title="wikilink">findings of fact</a> and decision, <a href="s:Kitzmiller_v._Dover_Area_School_District_et_al." title="wikilink">ruling that</a> the Dover mandate was unconstitutional, and barring intelligent design from being taught in Pennsylvania's Middle District public school science classrooms. The eight Dover school board members who voted for the intelligent design requirement were all defeated in a November 8, 2005, election by challengers who opposed the teaching of intelligent design in a science class, and the current school board president stated that the board does not intend to appeal the ruling.<a href="#fn161" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref161"><sup>161</sup></a></p>
<p>In his finding of facts, Judge Jones made the following condemnation of the <a href="Teach_the_Controversy" title="wikilink">Teach the Controversy</a> strategy:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Moreover, ID's backers have sought to avoid the scientific scrutiny which we have now determined that it cannot withstand by advocating that the controversy, but not ID itself, should be taught in science class. This tactic is at best disingenuous, and at worst a <a href="Wikt:canard#Noun" title="wikilink">canard</a>.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="reaction">Reaction</h3>
<p>Judge Jones himself anticipated that his ruling would be criticized, saying in his decision that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Those who disagree with our holding will likely mark it as the product of an activist judge. If so, they will have erred as this is manifestly not an activist Court. Rather, this case came to us as the result of the activism of an ill-informed faction on a school board, aided by a national public interest law firm eager to find a constitutional test case on ID, who in combination drove the Board to adopt an imprudent and ultimately unconstitutional policy. The breathtaking inanity of the Board's decision is evident when considered against the factual backdrop which has now been fully revealed through this trial. The students, parents, and teachers of the Dover Area School District deserved better than to be dragged into this legal maelstrom, with its resulting utter waste of monetary and personal resources.&quot;<ref name="kitz137"></p>

<p></ref></p>

<p>As Jones had predicted, <a href="John_G._West" title="wikilink">John G. West</a>, Associate Director of the <a href="Center_for_Science_and_Culture" title="wikilink">Center for Science and Culture</a> at <a href="Discovery_Institute" title="wikilink">Discovery Institute</a>, said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The Dover decision is an attempt by an activist federal judge to stop the spread of a scientific idea and even to prevent criticism of Darwinian evolution through government-imposed censorship rather than open debate, and it won't work. He has conflated Discovery Institute's position with that of the Dover school board, and he totally misrepresents intelligent design and the motivations of the scientists who research it.&quot;<a href="#fn162" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref162"><sup>162</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Newspapers have noted with interest that the judge is &quot;a <a href="Republican_Party_(United_States)" title="wikilink">Republican</a> and a <a href="Church_(building)" title="wikilink">churchgoer</a>&quot;.<a href="#fn163" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref163"><sup>163</sup></a><a href="#fn164" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref164"><sup>164</sup></a><a href="#fn165" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref165"><sup>165</sup></a><a href="#fn166" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref166"><sup>166</sup></a></p>
<p>Subsequently, the decision has been examined in a search for flaws and conclusions, partly by intelligent design supporters aiming to avoid future defeats in court. In the Spring of 2007 the University of Montana Law review published three articles.<ref></p>

<p></ref> In the first, David K. DeWolf, John G. West and Casey Luskin, all of the Discovery Institute, argued that intelligent design is a valid scientific theory, the Jones court should not have addressed the question of whether it was a scientific theory, and that the Kitzmiller decision will have no effect at all on the development and adoption of intelligent design as an alternative to standard evolutionary theory.<ref name=DeWolf></p>

<p></ref> In the second <a href="Peter_Irons" title="wikilink">Peter Irons</a> responded, arguing that the decision was extremely well reasoned and spells the death knell for the intelligent design efforts to introduce creationism in public schools,<a href="#fn167" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref167"><sup>167</sup></a> while in the third, DeWolf et al. answer the points made by Irons.<a href="#fn168" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref168"><sup>168</sup></a> However, fear of a similar lawsuit has resulted in other school boards abandoning intelligent design &quot;teach the controversy&quot; proposals.<a href="#fn169" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref169"><sup>169</sup></a></p>
<p>In April 2010, the <a href="American_Academy_of_Religion" title="wikilink">American Academy of Religion</a> issued <em>Guidelines for Teaching About Religion in K-12 Public Schools in the United States</em>, which included guidance that <a href="Creation_Science" title="wikilink">Creation Science</a> or intelligent design should not be taught in science classes, as &quot;Creation science and intelligent design represent worldviews that fall outside of the realm of science that is defined as (and limited to) a method of inquiry based on gathering observable and measurable evidence subject to specific principles of reasoning.&quot; However, they, as well as other &quot;worldviews that focus on speculation regarding the origins of life represent another important and relevant form of human inquiry that is appropriately studied in literature or social sciences courses. Such study, however, must include a diversity of worldviews representing a variety of religious and philosophical perspectives and must avoid privileging one view as more legitimate than others.&quot;<a href="#fn170" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref170"><sup>170</sup></a></p>

<h3 id="europe">Europe</h3>
<p>In June 2007 the <a href="Council_of_Europe" title="wikilink">Council of Europe</a>'s &quot;Committee on Culture, Science and Education&quot; issued a report, <em>The dangers of creationism in education</em>, which states &quot;Creationism in any of its forms, such as 'intelligent design', is not based on facts, does not use any scientific reasoning and its contents are pathetically inadequate for science classes.&quot;<a href="#fn171" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref171"><sup>171</sup></a> In describing the dangers posed to education by teaching creationism, it described intelligent design as &quot;anti-science&quot; and involving &quot;blatant scientific fraud&quot; and &quot;intellectual deception&quot; that &quot;blurs the nature, objectives and limits of science&quot; and links it and other forms of creationism to <a href="denialism" class="uri" title="wikilink">denialism</a>. On October 4, 2007, the Council of Europe's Parliamentary Assembly approved a resolution stating that schools should &quot;resist presentation of creationist ideas in any discipline other than religion&quot;, including &quot;intelligent design&quot;, which it described as &quot;the latest, more refined version of creationism&quot;, &quot;presented in a more subtle way&quot;. The resolution emphasises that the aim of the report is not to question or to fight a belief, but to &quot;warn against certain tendencies to pass off a belief as science&quot;.<ref></p>

<p>On June 25, 2007, the UK Government responded to an e-petition by saying that creationism and intelligent design should not be taught as science, though teachers would be expected to answer pupils' questions within the standard framework of established scientific theories.<a href="#fn180" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref180"><sup>180</sup></a> Detailed government &quot;Creationism teaching guidance&quot; for schools in England was published on September 18, 2007. It states that &quot;Intelligent design lies wholly outside of science&quot;, has no underpinning scientific principles, or explanations, and is not accepted by the science community as a whole. Though it should not be taught as science, &quot;questions about creationism and intelligent design which arise in science lessons, for example, as a result of media coverage, could provide the opportunity to explain or explore why they are not considered to be scientific theories and, in the right context, why evolution is considered to be a scientific theory&quot;. However, &quot;Teachers of subjects such as RE, history or citizenship may deal with creationism and intelligent design in their lessons&quot;.<a href="#fn181" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref181"><sup>181</sup></a></p>
<p>The <a href="British_Centre_for_Science_Education" title="wikilink">British Centre for Science Education</a> lobbying group has the goal of &quot;countering creationism within the UK&quot; and has been involved in government lobbying in the UK in this regard.<a href="#fn182" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref182"><sup>182</sup></a> <a href="Northern_Ireland" title="wikilink">Northern Ireland</a>'s <a href="Department_of_Education_(Northern_Ireland)" title="wikilink">Department for Education</a> says that the curriculum provides an opportunity for alternative theories to be taught.

<li id="fn127">Intelligent design professes to offer an answer that does not need to be defined or explained, the intelligent agent, designer. By asserting a conclusion that cannot be accounted for scientifically, <em>the designer</em>, intelligent design cannot be sustained by any further explanation, and objections raised to those who accept intelligent design make little headway. Thus intelligent design is not a provisional assessment of data, which can change when new information is discovered. Once it is claimed that a conclusion that need not be accounted for has been established, there is simply no possibility of future correction. The idea of the progressive growth of scientific ideas is required to explain previous data and any previously unexplainable data.

The current controversy surrounding the teaching of evolution is not a scientific one.&quot; <a href="http://www.aaas.org/news/releases/2006/pdf/0219boardstatement.pdf">AAAS Statement on the Teaching of Evolution</a> <a href="American_Association_for_the_Advancement_of_Science" title="wikilink">American Association for the Advancement of Science</a>.
