It was adopted and standardized in <a href="1947" class="uri" title="wikilink">1947</a>. Compared to the autoloading <a href="rifle" title="wikilink">rifles</a> used in <a href="World_War_II" title="wikilink">World War II</a>, the AK-47 was generally lighter, more compact, with a shorter range, a smaller <a href="7.62_x_39_mm" title="wikilink">7.62 &lt;U+00D7&gt; 39 mm</a> cartridge, and was capable of <a href="selective_fire" title="wikilink">selective fire</a>. It was one of the first true assault rifles, and remains the most widely used. The AK-47 and its numerous variants and descendents have been produced in greater numbers than any other assault rifle, and it remains in production to this day.</p>
<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<p>During the Second World War, <a href="Germany" class="uri" title="wikilink">Germany</a> had developed the concept of the assault rifle. This concept was based on the knowledge that most military engagements in modern warfare were happening at fairly close range with the majority happening within 100 meters. The power and range of contemporary rifle cartridges was simply overkill for a vast majority of engagements with small arms. As a result, a cartridge and firearm were sought combining the features of a <a href="submachine_gun" title="wikilink">submachine gun</a> (high-capacity magazine and <a href="Automatic_firearm" title="wikilink">fully-automatic</a> fire capability) with an intermediate-power cartridge that would be effective to a range of 300 meters. For the sake of reduced manufacturing costs, this was done by shortening the <a href="7,92_x_57_mm" title="wikilink">8 mm Mauser</a> cartridge to 33 mm and using a lighter bullet.</p>
<p>The resulting <a href="Sturmgewehr_44" title="wikilink">Sturmgewehr 44</a> (StG44) was not the first rifle to use these features; it was preceded by earlier <a href="Italy" title="wikilink">Italian</a>, and Russian designs. The Germans were, however, the first to produce and field a sufficient number of the type to properly evaluate its utility. They fielded the weapon in large numbers against the Russians towards the end of the war. This experience deeply influenced Russian doctrine in the years following the war. <img src="Young_kalashnikov.jpg" title="fig:Mikhail Kalashnikov in the late 1940s" alt="Mikhail Kalashnikov in the late 1940s" width="200" /></p>
<p>Mikhail Kalashnikov began imagining his weapon while still in the hospital, after being wounded in the battle of <a href="Bryansk" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bryansk</a>. He had been informed that a new weapon was required for the 7.62 &lt;U+00D7&gt; 41 mm cartridge developed by Elisarov and Semin in 1943. Sudayev's <a href="PPS43" class="uri" title="wikilink">PPS43</a> submachine gun was preferred to Kalashnikov's design. Kalashnikov redesigned his losing design after examining a German StG44 in 1946. Kalashnikov was chosen to lead a team of designers possibly more for propaganda value due to his war-hero status rather than for his expertise. This would follow Soviet patterns in other industries.</p>
<p>Despite circumstantial evidence, Mikhail Kalashnikov denies that his rifle was <em>based</em> on the German assault rifle. To support his position, the AK-47 owes more to the <a href="M1_Garand" title="wikilink">M1 Garand</a> Rifle than any German design. The double locking lugs, unlocking raceway, and trigger mechanism are clearly derived from the earlier American design. This is not surprising as millions of Garand rifles had operated reliably in combat around the globe. Though mechanically similar to the Garand, the AK-47 clearly borrows its cartridge concept, weapon layout, gas system, and construction methods from the StG44. Further, the safety is surprisingly similar to the <a href="John_Browning" title="wikilink">Browning</a> designed <a href="Remington_Arms" title="wikilink">Remington</a> Model 8 rifle.</p>
<p>The genius in the design of the Kalashnikov rifle is in the simplification of those contributing designs and adaptation to mass production by relatively unskilled labor. The AK-47 can be seen as a fusion of the best that the M1 Garand offered combined with the best aspects of the StG44 made by the best processes available in the Soviet Union at the time.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>The operating mechanism of the Kalashnikov family of weapons is basically very similar to that of the US M1 and M14 rifles and M1/M2 carbines. In fact, as is often the case in a successful weapon design, there is little new about the individual elements of Kalashnikov&lt;U+2019&gt;s design; the inventor&lt;U+2019&gt;s accomplishment was in the recombination of known elements into a compact, reliable and durable package.</em> &lt;U+2014&gt;Ed Ezell.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There were many difficulties during the initial phase of production. The first production models had stamped sheet metal receivers. Difficulties were encountered welding the guide and ejector rails causing high rejection rates. Instead of halting production, a heavy machined receiver was substituted for the sheet metal receiver. This was a more costly process, but the use of machined receivers accelerated production as tooling and labor for the earlier <a href="Mosin-Nagant" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mosin-Nagant</a> rifle's machined receiver were easily adapted. Partly because of these problems, the Soviets were not able to distribute large numbers of the new rifle to soldiers until 1956. During this time, production of the interim <a href="SKS" class="uri" title="wikilink">SKS</a> rifle continued.</p>
<p>Once manufacturing difficulties had been overcome, a redesigned version designated the AKM (<em>M</em> for <em>modernized</em> or <em>upgraded</em>) was introduced in 1959. This new model used a stamped sheet metal receiver and featured a slanted device on the end of the <a href="Gun_barrel" title="wikilink">barrel</a> to compensate for muzzle rise under recoil. It was also somewhat lighter than the previous AK-47. The AKM was exported around the world to aid in the spread of Communism. Licensed production of the Kalashnikov weapons abroad as well as unlicensed production was almost exclusively of the AKM; this model is the most commonly encountered one. Despite this reality, rifles of this pattern are most often referred to as AK-47s in the West. In most former Eastern Bloc countries the weapon is known simply as the &quot;Kalashnikov.&quot;</p>
<p>In <a href="1978" class="uri" title="wikilink">1978</a>, the <a href="Soviet_Union" title="wikilink">Soviet Union</a> began replacing their AK-47 and AKM rifles with a newer design, the <a href="AK-74" class="uri" title="wikilink">AK-74</a>. This new rifle and cartridge had only started being exported to eastern European nations when the Soviet Union collapsed drastically slowing production of this and all other small arms.</p>
<h2 id="features">Features</h2>
<p><img src="AK-components.jpg" title="fig:A diagram showing the design of AKM." alt="A diagram showing the design of AKM." width="280" /> The AK-47 is simple and inexpensive to manufacture and easy to clean and maintain. Its ruggedness and reliability are legendary. The large gas piston, generous clearances between moving parts, and tapered cartridge case design allow the gun to endure large amounts of foreign matter and fouling without failing to cycle. This reliability comes at the cost of accuracy.</p>
<p>The notched rear tangent iron sight is adjustable with each setting denoting hundreds of meters. The front sight is a post adjustable for elevation in the field. Windage adjustment is done by the armory prior to issue. The battle setting places the round within a few centimeters above or below the point of aim out to approximately 250 meters. This &quot;<a href="point-blank_range" title="wikilink">point-blank range</a>&quot; setting allows the shooter to fire the gun at any close target without adjusting the sights. Longer settings are intended for area suppression. These settings mirror the <a href="Mosin-Nagant" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mosin-Nagant</a> and <a href="SKS" class="uri" title="wikilink">SKS</a> rifles which the AK-47 replaced. This eased transition and simplified training.</p>
<p>The <a href="bore" class="uri" title="wikilink">bore</a> and <a href="chamber" class="uri" title="wikilink">chamber</a>, as well as the gas piston and the interior of the <a href="gas_cylinder" title="wikilink">gas cylinder</a>, are generally <a href="chromium" class="uri" title="wikilink">chromium</a> plated. This plating dramatically increases the life of these parts by resisting corrosion and wear. Chrome plating of critical parts is now common on most modern military weapons.</p>
<h3 id="operating-cycle">Operating cycle</h3>
<p>To fire, the operator inserts a loaded <a href="Magazine_(firearm)" title="wikilink">magazine</a>, moves the selector lever to the lowest position, pulls back and releases the charging handle, and then pulls the <a href="trigger_(mechanism)" title="wikilink">trigger</a>. In this setting, the gun fires once requiring the trigger be released and depressed again for the next shot until the magazine is exhausted. With the selector in the middle position, the rifle continues to fire, automatically cycling fresh rounds into the chamber, until the magazine is exhausted or pressure is released from the trigger.</p>
<p>Dismantling the gun involves the operator depressing the magazine catch and removing the magazine. The charging handle is pulled to the rear and the operator inspects the chamber to verify the gun is unloaded. The operator presses forward on the retainer button at the rear of the receiver cover while simultaneously lifting up on the rear of the cover to remove it. He then pushes the spring assembly forward and lifts it from its raceway, withdrawing it out of the bolt carrier and to the rear. The operator must then pull the carrier assembly all the way to the rear, lift it, and then pull it away. He removes the bolt by pushing it to the rear of the bolt carrier; rotating the bolt so the camming lug clears the raceway on the underside of the bolt carrier and then pulls it forward and free. When cleaning, the operator will pay special attention to the barrel, bolt face, and gas piston, then oil lightly and reassemble.</p>
<h3 id="ballistics">Ballistics</h3>
<p>The standard AK-47 or AKM fires a <a href="7.62_x_39_mm" title="wikilink">7.62 &lt;U+00D7&gt; 39 mm</a> <a href="cartridge_(weaponry)" title="wikilink">round</a> with a muzzle velocity of 710 m/s (2,329 ft/s). Muzzle energy is 1,990 <a href="joule" title="wikilink">joules</a> (1,467 <a href="Foot-pound_force" title="wikilink">ft&lt;U+00B7&gt;lb<em>f</em></a>). Cartridge case length is 38.6 mm, weight is 18.21 <a href="Gram" title="wikilink">g</a>. Projectile weight is normally 8 g (123 <a href="Grain_(measure)" title="wikilink">gr</a>). The AK-47 and AKM, with the 7.62 &lt;U+00D7&gt; 39 mm cartridge, have an effective range of around 300 meters. For comparison, the <a href="7.62_x_54_mm_R" title="wikilink">7.62 &lt;U+00D7&gt; 54 mm R</a> mm cartridge has a projectile of 12 g (185 gr) at a velocity of 818 m/s (2,683 ft/s) for approximately 4,000 joules (2,950 ft&lt;U+00B7&gt;lb<em>f</em>) of energy.</p>

<p><img src="Misccaparms.jpg" title="fig:Small arms captured in Fallujah by U.S. Marines, including two AKMs, a variant of the AK-47 (first and third rifles from the left)" alt="Small arms captured in Fallujah by U.S. Marines, including two AKMs, a variant of the AK-47 (first and third rifles from the left)" width="280" /> Private ownership of fully-automatic AK-47 rifles is tightly regulated by the <a href="National_Firearms_Act" title="wikilink">National Firearms Act</a> (NFA) of 1934. The <a href="Gun_Control_Act_of_1968" title="wikilink">Gun Control Act of 1968</a> ceased importing of foreign-manufactured fully-automatic firearms for civilian sales and possession, effectively halting further importation of civilian accessible AK-47 rifles. In 1986, an amendment to the <a href="Firearm_Owners_Protection_Act" title="wikilink">Firearm Owners Protection Act</a> stopped all future domestic manufacture of fully-automatic weapons for civilian use.</p>
<p>However, machine guns manufactured domestically prior to 1986 and imported prior to 1968 may be transferred between civilians in accordance with federal and state law. Several Soviet and Chinese rifles made it into the U.S. during the mid-1960s, when returning Vietnam veterans brought them home after capture from enemy troops. Many of these were properly registered during the 1968 NFA amnesty. In addition, several states have laws on their books outlawing private possession of fully-automatic firearms even with NFA approval.</p>
<p>Certain <a href="Semi-automatic_firearm" title="wikilink">semi-automatic</a> AK-47 models were banned by the now-expired <a href="Federal_assault_weapons_ban" title="wikilink">Assault Weapons Ban</a> of 1994&lt;U+2013&gt;2004. A semi-automatic rifle, similar externally to the AK-47 but operably identical to many hunting rifles, was used in a much-publicized 1989 shooting in a schoolyard in <a href="Stockton,_California" title="wikilink">Stockton, California</a>, and also in the 1993 murders outside of the <a href="Central_Intelligence_Agency" title="wikilink">CIA</a> headquarters in <a href="Langley,_Virginia" title="wikilink">Langley, Virginia</a> (see <a href="Mir_Aimal_Kansi" title="wikilink">Mir Aimal Kansi</a>). Another much-publicized use of the AK-47 in the United States happened when bank robbers exchanged fire with police after a botched robbery. The <a href="North_Hollywood_shootout" title="wikilink">North Hollywood shootout</a> involved AK-47s that were illegally modified to fully-automatic.</p>
<h3 id="in-canada">In Canada</h3>
<p>In <a href="Canada" class="uri" title="wikilink">Canada</a>, the AK-47 is illegal for purchase, acquisition, or import. However, as with many gun issues in Canada presently, the particular issue of <a href="Grandfathering" title="wikilink">&quot;grandfathered&quot;</a> AK-47 rifles remains unclear.</p>
<h3 id="illicit-trade">Illicit trade</h3>
<p>Throughout the world, the AK-47 and variants are commonly smuggled and sold to governments, rebels, criminals and civilians alike, with little international oversight. This trade ensures a ready supply of inexpensive weapons to a number of conflicts, including (but certainly not limited to) <a href="Iraq" class="uri" title="wikilink">Iraq</a>, <a href="Afghanistan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Afghanistan</a>, and <a href="Somalia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Somalia</a>.</p>
<h2 id="cultural-influence">Cultural influence</h2>
<p><img src="Coat_of_arms_of_Mozambique.png" title="fig:Coat of arms of Mozambique" alt="Coat of arms of Mozambique" width="200" /> The AK-47 and its derivatives are favored by many non-<a href="Western_world" title="wikilink">Western</a> powers because of their ease of use, robustness, simplicity, and manufacturing cost effectiveness. Estimates for production range over 100 million units.</p>
<p>During the <a href="Cold_War" title="wikilink">Cold War</a>, the Soviet Union, <a href="People&#39;s_Republic_of_China" title="wikilink">China</a> and the <a href="United_States" title="wikilink">United States</a> supplied arms and technical knowledge to numerous countries and rebel forces to promote their interests. This period saw the proliferation, sometimes free of charge, of AK-47s by the Soviet Union and China to pro-communist countries and groups such as the <a href="Nicaragua" title="wikilink">Nicaraguan</a> <a href="Sandinistas" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sandinistas</a> and <a href="Viet-Cong" class="uri" title="wikilink">Viet-Cong</a>.</p>
<p>The proliferation of this weapon is reflected by more than just numbers. The AK-47 is included in the <a href="flag_of_Mozambique" title="wikilink">flag of Mozambique</a> and <a href="coat_of_arms" title="wikilink">coat of arms</a> (formerly also in <a href="Burkina_Faso" title="wikilink">Burkina Faso</a> coat of arms) and the <a href="Hezbollah" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hezbollah</a> flag. &quot;<a href="Kalash" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kalash</a>&quot;, a shortened form of &quot;<a href="Kalashnikov" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kalashnikov</a>&quot;, is used as a name for boys in some African countries.</p>
<p>In the U.S., rap artists reference AK-47s and moviemakers arm cinema terrorists, gang members (e.g. films like <em><a href="Boyz_N_The_Hood" title="wikilink">Boyz N The Hood</a></em>), and &quot;bad guys&quot; in general with AK-47s. Numerous computer and video games feature AK-47s. Toy makers and the airsoft industry make millions of replica AK-47's. Combined, these factors add much to the weapon's cultural mystique.</p>
<p>The sheer ubiquity of the AK-47, its iconography and the fact that it possesses easily the most distinguishable weapon outline ensures a significant and conspicuous impact on society.</p>
