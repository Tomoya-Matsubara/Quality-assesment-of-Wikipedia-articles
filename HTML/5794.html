<p>Set eight months after the preceding episode,<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> &quot;Soprano Home Movies&quot; details a weekend that series <a href="protagonist" class="uri" title="wikilink">protagonist</a> <a href="Tony_Soprano" title="wikilink">Tony Soprano</a> and his wife <a href="Carmela_Soprano" title="wikilink">Carmela</a> (<a href="James_Gandolfini" title="wikilink">James Gandolfini</a> and <a href="Edie_Falco" title="wikilink">Edie Falco</a>) spend at his sister and brother-in-law's lakefront vacation home in upstate <a href="New_York" title="wikilink">New York</a>. As they celebrate Tony's birthday, a casual argument leads to insults and culminates in a fistfight between Tony and his brother-in-law, <a href="Bobby_Bacala" title="wikilink">Bobby</a> (<a href="Steve_Schirripa" title="wikilink">Steve Schirripa</a>). After losing the fight, Tony contemplates how to get back at Bobby.</p>
<h2 id="plot">Plot</h2>
<p>In a flashback to 2004, a neighborhood teenage boy witnesses <a href="Johnny_Sack" title="wikilink">Johnny Sack</a>'s (<a href="Vincent_Curatola" title="wikilink">Vincent Curatola</a>) arrest and Tony Soprano's dropping of his gun in the snow as he flees the scene. The same teenage boy later picks up and fires the gun.</p>
<p>Three years later, <a href="Essex_County,_New_Jersey" title="wikilink">Essex County</a> authorities arrest Tony on a gun charge. Tony spends a short period of time in custody before appearing in court with his attorney, <a href="List_of_characters_from_The_Sopranos_in_the_DiMeo_Crime_Family#Neil_Mink" title="wikilink">Neil Mink</a> (<a href="David_Margulies" title="wikilink">David Margulies</a>), and is released on bail. In <a href="Brooklyn,_New_York" title="wikilink">Brooklyn</a>, a party is held for <a href="Phil_Leotardo" title="wikilink">Phil Leotardo</a> (<a href="Frank_Vincent" title="wikilink">Frank Vincent</a>), who has recently returned from the hospital.</p>
<p>Tony returns home to a warm welcome. Later, he and Carmela travel to <a href="Janice_Soprano" title="wikilink">Janice</a> (<a href="Aida_Turturro" title="wikilink">Aida Turturro</a>) and Bobby's upstate New York lakefront vacation home to celebrate Tony's forty-seventh birthday, where Tony fires Bobby's customized <a href="AR-10" class="uri" title="wikilink">AR-10</a> <a href="assault_rifle" title="wikilink">assault rifle</a> in the nearby woods. Bobby gives Tony the <a href="firearm" class="uri" title="wikilink">firearm</a> as a birthday present. The two later relax by fishing on the lake in Bobby's boat. Tony raises the fact that Bobby has never &quot;popped his cherry&quot; in regard to murdering someone and juxtaposes this with the kill record of <a href="List_of_characters_from_The_Sopranos_in_the_Soprano_crime_family#Robert_&quot;Bobby&quot;_Baccalieri,_Sr." title="wikilink">Bobby's father</a>. Bobby replies that he has &quot;come close,&quot; but that his father never wanted it for him. In <a href="New_Jersey" title="wikilink">New Jersey</a>, <a href="A.J._Soprano" title="wikilink">A.J.</a> (<a href="Robert_Iler" title="wikilink">Robert Iler</a>) uses his parents' bedroom to entertain his new girlfriend and has friends over for a party while his parents are away.</p>
<p>Tony, Carmela, Bobby, and Janice celebrate Tony's birthday with <a href="karaoke" class="uri" title="wikilink">karaoke</a>, drinking, and <a href="Monopoly_(game)" title="wikilink">Monopoly</a>. An argument starts after a discussion of <a href="Monopoly_(game)#House_rules" title="wikilink">Monopoly house rules</a>. Over Tony's objections, Janice relates a childhood story of their <a href="List_of_characters_from_The_Sopranos_-_Friends_and_Family#John_Francis_&quot;Johnny_Boy&quot;_Soprano" title="wikilink">father</a> and <a href="Livia_Soprano" title="wikilink">mother</a>; tensions reach a crescendo with Tony's remarks about Janice's looks and past promiscuous behavior. Bobby hits Tony in the face and the two have a fight, ending with Tony bloodied and bruised on the floor. Janice scolds Bobby for hitting Tony, and Bobby runs outside, where he drives off drunk in his SUV and reverses into a tree. He returns inside and apologizes to Tony and the two couples go to their beds. Tony wakes up in the middle of the night and tells Bobby and Janice that Bobby beat him in a fair fight. The next day, the couples seem to make amends, but as the day progresses Tony increasingly obsesses over losing the fight to Bobby.</p>
<p><img src="Sopranos613b.jpg" title="fig:Bobby returns to the vacation home after committing his first murder." alt="Bobby returns to the vacation home after committing his first murder." width="200" /> Tony and Bobby leave for a pre-arranged business meeting. They meet with two <a href="Quebecers" class="uri" title="wikilink">Quebecers</a> who are interested in doing business with Tony. As a part of a business arrangement, Tony agrees to arrange the <a href="murder" class="uri" title="wikilink">murder</a> of one of the Quebecer's former brother-in-law and asks Bobby to take care of it. Back at the vacation home, Carmela and Tony leave for home and Bobby sets off for <a href="Montreal" class="uri" title="wikilink">Montreal</a>, where the man he agreed to murder lives. He finds his target in the laundry room of an apartment building and kills him by shooting him twice.</p>
<p>Back home, Tony watches a <a href="DVD" class="uri" title="wikilink">DVD</a> given to him by Janice. Mink calls, informing Tony that the gun charge, though dropped by Essex County, has been picked up by the <a href="FBI_on_The_Sopranos" title="wikilink">FBI</a>. Bobby returns to his lake front house, picks up his daughter, and gazes out over the lake.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="production">Production</h2>
<p>The episode title derives from Janice's birthday present to Tony: a DVD onto which she has had transferred old home movies of them and their <a href="List_of_characters_from_The_Sopranos_-_Friends_and_Family#Barbara_Soprano_Giglione" title="wikilink">sister</a> during their childhood.</p>
<p>&quot;Soprano Home Movies&quot; was the first episode of the final batch of episodes to be produced, following a six-month-long production hiatus. In preparation for shooting the episode, series creator/executive producer David Chase held several rehearsals with the lead actors.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>The scenes at the lake front vacation home were filmed over two weeks in June 2006 in <a href="Putnam_Valley,_New_York" title="wikilink">Putnam Valley</a>, New York. Additional interior shots were filmed six months later at <a href="Silvercup_Studios" title="wikilink">Silvercup Studios</a>, New York, where a replica of the cabin had been built in a <a href="sound_stage" title="wikilink">sound stage</a>. The lake seen multiple times in the episode is <a href="Lake_Oscawana" title="wikilink">Lake Oscawana</a>. The scenes of Tony and Bobby fishing were filmed on location on the lake but much closer to the shore than it appears in the episode. The scenes set in Montreal were actually filmed in <a href="Clinton_Hill,_Brooklyn" title="wikilink">Clinton Hill, Brooklyn</a>. Filming of the scenes set in <a href="New_Jersey" title="wikilink">New Jersey</a> and the Soprano residence took place on location in Essex County, New Jersey and in Silvercup Studios. The ripping of Bobby's shirt when he commits his first murder was not in the script but was added during production.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> While filming the cabin fight scene between Tony and Bobby in Silvercup Studios, Steve Schirripa accidentally headbutted James Gandolfini. The fight scene was choreographed but Gandolfini didn't step out of the way in time. His nose was bloodied but not broken. The real headbutting was kept in the episode.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>Gregory Antonacci, who plays Phil Leotardo's advisor <a href="Butch_DeConcini" title="wikilink">Butch DeConcini</a> on the show, is now billed in the opening credits. <a href="Joseph_R._Gannascoli" title="wikilink">Joseph R. Gannascoli</a> has been removed from the main credits as <a href="Vito_Spatafore" title="wikilink">his character</a> was murdered two episodes prior to &quot;Soprano Home Movies&quot;. The characters <a href="Dr._Jennifer_Melfi" title="wikilink">Dr. Jennifer Melfi</a> (<a href="Lorraine_Bracco" title="wikilink">Lorraine Bracco</a>) and <a href="Junior_Soprano" title="wikilink">Junior Soprano</a> (<a href="Dominic_Chianese" title="wikilink">Dominic Chianese</a>) do not appear in the episode but the actors who play them are still listed in the opening credits.</p>

<p>The episode was generally well-received by critics.

[...] Such signature exaggerations remain both hilarious and unsettling.&quot; She awarded the episode a score of 9 out of 10 (shared with the following two episodes).<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> Tom Biro of <a href="television" class="uri" title="wikilink">television</a> <a href="webblog" class="uri" title="wikilink">webblog</a> <a href="TV_Squad" title="wikilink">TV Squad</a> gave the episode a favorable review, writing &quot;All in all, big thumbs up from me.&quot;<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> Kim Reed of <a href="Television_Without_Pity" title="wikilink">Television Without Pity</a> gave the midseason premiere an A-, writing &quot;...while, on the surface, not much happened, I think there were a ton of callbacks to previous episodes, and that familiar Soprano tension was used to good effect.&quot;<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> Alessandra Stanley of <em><a href="The_New_York_Times" title="wikilink">The New York Times</a></em> gave the episode a mixed review, calling it &quot;solemn&quot; and wrote that &quot;even before last season the series had started to sag in places, a creative fatigue that matched the main characters' weariness and also the audience's.&quot;<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
