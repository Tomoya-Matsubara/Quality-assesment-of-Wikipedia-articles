<p><strong>William P. Hobby Airport</strong>  is named after former <a href="Texas" class="uri" title="wikilink">Texas</a> governor <a href="William_P._Hobby" title="wikilink">William P. Hobby</a>, receiving this name in <a href="1967" class="uri" title="wikilink">1967</a>, and is located 7 miles (11 km) southeast of downtown <a href="Houston,_Texas" title="wikilink">Houston</a>, in <a href="Harris_County,_Texas" title="wikilink">Harris County</a>, <a href="Texas" class="uri" title="wikilink">Texas</a>. Despite occasional claims of being the only U.S. commercial airport to be named after a woman, it was not named after <a href="Oveta_Culp_Hobby" title="wikilink">Oveta Culp Hobby</a>.</p>
<p>Hobby Airport is Houston's oldest commercial airport. It was the city's primary air terminal until the opening of <a href="George_Bush_Intercontinental_Airport" title="wikilink">George Bush Intercontinental Airport</a>. Hobby is now Houston's secondary airport and mainly handles domestic service, particularly from one carrier, <a href="Southwest_Airlines" title="wikilink">Southwest Airlines</a>.</p>
<p>It was first called <strong>Houston Municipal Airport</strong> in <a href="1937" class="uri" title="wikilink">1937</a>. It was named <strong><a href="Howard_Hughes" title="wikilink">Howard R. Hughes</a> Airport</strong> in <a href="1938" class="uri" title="wikilink">1938</a>, but because the person was alive at the time and regulations at the time did not allow federal improvement funds for an airport named after a living person, the airport's name changed back to Houston Municipal.</p>
<p>In <a href="1950" class="uri" title="wikilink">1950</a>, <a href="Pan_American_World_Airways" title="wikilink">Pan Am</a> started a Houston-<a href="Mexico_City" title="wikilink">Mexico City</a> flight, and in <a href="1954" class="uri" title="wikilink">1954</a>, the name was changed to Houston International Airport. KLM started <a href="Amsterdam" class="uri" title="wikilink">Amsterdam</a> operations in <a href="1957" class="uri" title="wikilink">1957</a>. <a href="KLM" class="uri" title="wikilink">KLM</a> later moved to Houston Intercontinental Airport (now <a href="George_Bush_Intercontinental_Airport" title="wikilink">George Bush Intercontinental Airport</a>), where it remains today.</p>
<p>Houston Intercontinental Airport (now <a href="George_Bush_Intercontinental_Airport" title="wikilink">George Bush Intercontinental Airport</a>) was built in <a href="1969" class="uri" title="wikilink">1969</a> because of expansion limitations at Hobby. All commercial aviation operations at Hobby were moved to Houston Intercontinental when the airport opened.</p>
<p>Hobby was reopened to commercial aviation in <a href="1971" class="uri" title="wikilink">1971</a>.</p>
<p>Hobby has multiple low-fare carrier operations, as opposed to Bush Intercontinental Airport's hub operation with <a href="Continental_Airlines" title="wikilink">Continental Airlines</a>. Business travellers on shorter routes to Houston from within the United States tend to prefer Hobby over Bush Intercontinental.</p>
<p>In a survey among travelers in the United States by J.D. Power and Associates for an Aviation Week traveler satisfaction report, passengers have selected William P. Hobby Airport as the number one airport in the country for customer satisfaction. <a href="http://www.fly2houston.com/0/4079/0/0/0/0/">1</a></p>
<p>Recent developments at Hobby include a new concourse to serve <a href="Southwest_Airlines" title="wikilink">Southwest Airlines</a> and the upgrade of Runway 4/22.</p>
<h2 id="concourses">Concourses</h2>
<p>Hobby Airport has three concourses: A, C, and the new Central Concourse. All concourses are open as of October 2005. A major reconstruction program is underway to replace all three original concourses (A, B, and C). As of July 2006, Concourse B has been demolished to open up new gates on that side of the Central Concourse. Future plans call for Councourses A and C to be replaced with a new East Councourse to house all carriers except for Southwest.</p>
<h3 id="concourse-a">Concourse A</h3>
<p>Originally Southwest's center of operations at HOU, Concourse A currently serves as overflow for Southwest's Central Concourse. Plans call for Concourse A to be replaced with a new, modern East Concourse.</p>
