<p>The <strong>Afghan National Army</strong> (ANA) is the main branch of the <a href="military_of_Afghanistan" title="wikilink">military of Afghanistan</a> and is responsible for <a href="army" title="wikilink">land-based military</a> <a href="military_operations" title="wikilink">operations</a> or <a href="ground_warfare" title="wikilink">ground warfare</a> to defend the nation against foreign military incursions. It is under the <a href="Ministry_of_Defense_(Afghanistan)" title="wikilink">Ministry of Defense</a> in <a href="Kabul" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kabul</a> and is assembled by <a href="NATO" class="uri" title="wikilink">NATO</a> states. The <a href="Kabul_Military_Training_Center" title="wikilink">Kabul Military Training Center</a> and the <a href="National_Military_Academy_of_Afghanistan" title="wikilink">National Military Academy of Afghanistan</a> serve as the main compounds for training the new army. The <a href="Afghan_Defense_University" title="wikilink">Afghan Defense University</a> (ADF), after completion, will serve as the primary educational institution for the army as well as the <a href="Afghan_Air_Force" title="wikilink">Afghan Air Force</a>. The ANA is divided into six regional <a href="Corps" class="uri" title="wikilink">Corps</a>, with about 180,000 active troops as of December 2011,<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> although others claim only 100,000 troops are active.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> The current <a href="Chief_of_staff_(military)" title="wikilink">Chief of Staff</a> of the Afghan National Army is <a href="Lieutenant_General" title="wikilink">Lt.

<p>Afghanistan's army traces its roots to the early 18th-century when the <a href="Hotaki_dynasty" title="wikilink">Hotaki dynasty</a> was established in <a href="Kandahar" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kandahar</a> followed by <a href="Ahmad_Shah_Durrani" title="wikilink">Ahmad Shah Durrani</a>'s rise to power. It was reorganized in 1880 during <a href="Emir" class="uri" title="wikilink">Emir</a> <a href="Abdur_Rahman_Khan" title="wikilink">Abdur Rahman Khan</a>'s reign.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a><a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a><a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a><a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a><a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a><a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> During <a href="World_War_I" title="wikilink">World War I</a> and <a href="World_War_II" title="wikilink">World War II</a>, Afghanistan remained a <a href="Neutrality_(international_relations)" title="wikilink">neutral</a> state. From the 1960s to the early 1990s, the army of Afghanistan was equipped by the <a href="Soviet_Union" title="wikilink">Soviet Union</a>. By 1992, the national army fragmented into regional militias under various <a href="Northern_Alliance" title="wikilink">local warlords</a>. This was followed by the <a href="Islamic_Emirate_of_Afghanistan" title="wikilink">Taliban government</a> in the mid 1990s, which was minimally supported by the <a href="Pakistani_Armed_Forces" title="wikilink">armed forces of Pakistan</a>.</p>
<p>After the end of the Taliban rule in late 2001, the new Afghan National Army was formed by NATO states. Billions of dollars worth of <a href="Military_technology_and_equipment" title="wikilink">military equipment</a>, <a href="military_base" title="wikilink">facilities</a>, and other forms of aid has been provided to the ANA. Some of the weapons arrived from the <a href="United_States" title="wikilink">United States</a>, which included <a href="Humvee" title="wikilink">Humvees</a> and other trucks, <a href="M16_rifle" title="wikilink">M-16</a> <a href="assault_rifle" title="wikilink">assault rifles</a>, <a href="bulletproof_vest" title="wikilink">body armored jackets</a> as well as other types of vehicles and military equipment. It also included the building of a national <a href="Command_center#Military" title="wikilink">military command center</a>, with training compounds in different parts of the country. To thwart and dissolve anti-government militant groups, the <a href="Karzai_administration" title="wikilink">Karzai administration</a> began offering cash and vocational training to encourage members to join the nation's security forces. NATO is expanding the Afghan armed forces to about 260,000 active personnel by 2015, a move supported and funded primarily by the <a href="United_States_Department_of_Defense" title="wikilink">United States Department of Defense</a>.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> There were more than 4,000 <a href="United_States_armed_forces" title="wikilink">American military</a> trainers in late 2009 and additional numbers from other NATO member states, providing advanced warfare training to the Afghan armed forces and <a href="Afghan_National_Police" title="wikilink">police</a>.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<p><img src="Afghan_infantry.jpg" title="fig:Afghan Army infantry soldier in 1890" alt="Afghan Army infantry soldier in 1890" /> The modern army has its roots to the <a href="Hotaki_dynasty" title="wikilink">Hotaki dynasty</a> which was formed in April 1709, before the establishment of the <a href="Durrani_Empire" title="wikilink">Afghan Empire</a> by <a href="Ahmad_Shah_Durrani" title="wikilink">Ahmad Shah Durrani</a>. In 1880 <a href="Emir" title="wikilink">Amir</a> <a href="Abdur_Rahman_Khan" title="wikilink">Abdur Rahman Khan</a> established a newly equipped Afghan army with help from the <a href="United_Kingdom" title="wikilink">British</a>.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a><a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a><a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a><a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a><a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a><a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> The Afghan army was more modernized by King <a href="Amanullah_Khan" title="wikilink">Amanullah Khan</a> in the early 20th century just before the <a href="Third_Anglo-Afghan_War" title="wikilink">Third Anglo-Afghan War</a>. King Amanullah and his Afghan army fought against the British in 1919, resulting in Afghanistan becoming fully independent after the <a href="Treaty_of_Rawalpindi" title="wikilink">Treaty of Rawalpindi</a> was signed. The Afghan army was further upgraded during King <a href="Zahir_Shah" title="wikilink">Zahir Shah</a>'s reign, starting in 1933. <img src="1950s_Afghanistan_-_Afghan_Army_soldiers_on_parade.jpg" title="fig:Afghan army soldiers in the 1950s." alt="Afghan army soldiers in the 1950s." /></p>
<p>From the 1960s to the early 1990s, the Afghan army received training and equipment mostly from the former <a href="Soviet_Union" title="wikilink">Soviet Union</a>. Before the 1978 <a href="Saur_Revolution" title="wikilink">Marxist revolution</a>, according to military analyst George Jacobs, the armed forces included &quot;some three armored divisions (570 medium tanks plus T 55s on order), eight infantry divisions (averaging 4,500 to 8,000 men each), two mountain infantry brigades, one artillery brigade, a guards regiment (for palace protection), three artillery regiments, two commando regiments, and a parachute battalion (largely grounded). All the formations were under the control of three corps level headquarters. All but three infantry divisions were facing <a href="Pakistan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Pakistan</a> along a line from <a href="Bagram" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bagram</a> south to Khandahar.&quot;<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> After the <a href="coup" class="uri" title="wikilink">coup</a>, desertions swept the force, affecting the loyalty and moral values of soldiers, there were purges on patriotic junior and senior officers, and upper class Afghan <a href="Aristocracy_(class)" title="wikilink">aristocrats</a> in society.</p>
<p>Gradually the army's three armoured divisions (4th and 15th at Kabul/Bagram and 7th at Khandahar) and now sixteen infantry divisions dropped in size to between battalion and regiment sized, with no formation stronger than about 5,000 troops.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> During the 1980s <a href="Soviet_war_in_Afghanistan" title="wikilink">Soviet war in Afghanistan</a>, the national army of Afghanistan was involved in fighting against the <a href="mujahideen" class="uri" title="wikilink">mujahideen</a> rebel groups. A big problem in the Afghan army became deserters or defectors. The Afghan army's casualties were as high as 50&lt;U+2013&gt;60,000 and another 50,000 deserted the armed forces. The Afghan army's defection rate was about 10,000 per year between 1980&lt;U+2013&gt;89, the average deserters left the Afghan army after the first five months.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a></p>
<p>By 1992, after the withdrawal of the Soviet forces from Afghanistan and the fall of the communist regime in Kabul, the Soviet-trained army splintered between the government in Kabul and the various warring factions.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> By mid 1994 for example, there were two parallel 6th Corps operating in the north. <a href="Abdul_Rashid_Dostam" title="wikilink">Abdul Rashid Dostam</a>'s 6th Corps was based at <a href="Pul-i-Khumri" class="uri" title="wikilink">Pul-i-Khumri</a> and had three divisions. The Defence Ministry of the Kabul government's 6th Corps was based at <a href="Kunduz" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kunduz</a> and also had three divisions, two sharing numbers with formations in Dostum's corps.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> During that time local <a href="militia" class="uri" title="wikilink">militia</a> forces were formed or the former Soviet era national army units 'regionalised;' both provided security for their own people living in the territories they controlled. The country was factionalized with different warlords controlling the territories they claimed, and there was no officially recognized national army in the country. </p>
<p>This era was followed by the <a href="Islamic_Emirate_of_Afghanistan" title="wikilink">Taliban regime</a> in 1996, which removed the militia forces and decided to control the country by <a href="Islam" title="wikilink">Islamic</a> <a href="Sharia_law" title="wikilink">Sharia law</a>. The Taliban also began training its own army troops and commanders, some of whom were secretly trained by the intelligence agency (<a href="Inter-Services_Intelligence" title="wikilink">ISI</a>) or <a href="Pakistani_Armed_Forces" title="wikilink">Pakistani Armed Forces</a> in the border region on the <a href="Durand_Line" title="wikilink">Durand Line</a>. After the removal of the Taliban government in late 2001, private armies or militia forces took over security around the country. Formations in existence by the end of 2002 included the 1st Army Corps (<a href="Nangrahar" class="uri" title="wikilink">Nangrahar</a>), 2nd Army Corps (<a href="Kandahar" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kandahar</a>, dominated by <a href="Gul_Agha_Sherzai" title="wikilink">Gul Agha Sherzai</a> and his allies), 3rd Army Corps (<a href="Paktia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Paktia</a>, where the US allegedly attempted to impose Atiquallah Ludin as commander), 4th Army Corps (<a href="Herat" class="uri" title="wikilink">Herat</a>, dominated by <a href="Ismail_Khan" title="wikilink">Ismail Khan</a>), 6th Army Corps at Kunduz, 7th Army Corps (under <a href="Ustad_Atta_Mohammad_Noor" title="wikilink">Atta Mohammad Noor</a> at <a href="Mazar-i-Sharif" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mazar-i-Sharif</a> in Balkh Province<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a>), 8th Army Corps (at Shiberghan, dominated by Dostum's <a href="National_Islamic_Movement_of_Afghanistan" title="wikilink">National Islamic Movement of Afghanistan</a>) and the Central Army Corps around Kabul.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> <img src="First_ANA_graduates_in_2002.jpg" title="fig:The first batch of graduates of the new Afghan National Army (ANA) in 2002." alt="The first batch of graduates of the new Afghan National Army (ANA) in 2002." /></p>
<p>The new Afghan National Army was founded with the issue of a decree by <a href="President_of_Afghanistan" title="wikilink">President</a> <a href="Hamid_Karzai" title="wikilink">Hamid Karzai</a> on December 1, 2002.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> Upon his election Karzai set a goal of an army of at least 70,000 men by 2009.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> However, many western military experts as well as the <a href="Afghan_Defense_Ministry" title="wikilink">Defense Minister of Afghanistan</a>, <a href="Abdul_Rahim_Wardak" title="wikilink">Abdul Rahim Wardak</a>, believed that the nation needed at least 200,000 active troops in order to defend it from enemy forces.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a></p>
<p>The first new Afghan battalion was trained by <a href="British_Army" title="wikilink">British Army</a> personnel of the <a href="International_Security_Assistance_Force" title="wikilink">International Security Assistance Force</a>, becoming 1st Battalion, Afghan National Guard.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> Yet while the British troops provided high quality training, they were few in number. After some consideration, it was decided that <a href="United_States_Army_Special_Forces" title="wikilink">U.S. Army Special Forces</a> might be able to provide the training. Thus follow-on battalions were recruited and trained by 1st Battalion, <a href="3rd_Special_Forces_Group_(United_States)" title="wikilink">3rd Special Forces Group</a> of Ft. Bragg, NC, under the command of LTC McDonnell. 3rd SFG built the training facilities and ranges for early use, using a Soviet built facility on the eastern side of Kabul, near the then ISAF headquarters. The first training commenced in May 2002, with a difficult but successful recruitment process of bringing hundreds of new recruits in from all parts of Afghanistan. Early training was done in <a href="Pashto_language" title="wikilink">Pashto</a> and <a href="Dari_(Persian)" title="wikilink">Dari (Persian)</a> and some Arabic due to the very diverse ethnicities.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a></p>
<p>By January 2003 just over 1,700 soldiers in five <em>Kandaks</em> (<a href="Pashto_language" title="wikilink">Pashto</a> for <a href="battalion" title="wikilink">battalions</a>) had completed the 10-week training course, and by mid 2003 a total of 4,000 troops had been trained. Approximately 1,000 ANA soldiers were deployed in the US-led <a href="Operation_Warrior_Sweep" title="wikilink">Operation Warrior Sweep</a>, marking the first major combat operation for Afghan troops. Initial recruiting problems lay in the lack of cooperation from regional warlords and inconsistent international support. The problem of desertion dogged the force in its early days: in the summer of 2003, the desertion rate was estimated to be 10% and in mid-March 2004, estimate suggested that 3,000 soldiers had deserted. Some recruits were under 18 years of age and many could not read or write. Recruits who only spoke the Pashto language experienced difficulty because instruction was usually given through interpreters who spoke Dari.</p>
<p>In March 2004, fighting erupted in the western city of <a href="Herat" class="uri" title="wikilink">Herat</a> between Ismail Khan's private army and the Defense Ministry's 4th Corps militia.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> Ismail Khan's son <a href="Mirwais_Sadiq" title="wikilink">Mirwais Sadiq</a> was killed by a rocket-propelled grenade during the military standoff between his father and the Defense Ministry's Herat Division commander, General Abdul Zaher Nayebzadah. The death toll from the fighting was estimated at 50 to 100 people. In response to the fighting, about 1,500 Afghan National Army troops were deployed to Herat. The ANA were sent to the garrison of the 17th Herat Division of the Defense Ministry's 4th Corps &lt;U+2013&gt; General Abdul Zaher Nayebzadah's headquarters. The 17th Division headquarters had been overrun by Ismail Khan's private militia on 21 March. <img src="Non_Commissioned_Officers_of_the_Afghan_National_Army.jpg" title="fig:Newly trained ANA officers recite the oath ceremony of the first term bridmals at the Ghazi Military Training Center in Kabul." alt="Newly trained ANA officers recite the oath ceremony of the first term bridmals at the Ghazi Military Training Center in Kabul." width="250" /> <img src="ANA_graduation_at_Kandahar_in_January_2011.jpg" title="fig:Newly graduated recruits from its Basic Warrior Trainee course at Regional Military Training Center (RMTC) in Kandahar." alt="Newly graduated recruits from its Basic Warrior Trainee course at Regional Military Training Center (RMTC) in Kandahar." width="250" /></p>

<p>According to a 2009 news report, the Afghan National Army was plagued by inefficiency and corruption.<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a> U.S. training efforts have been drastically slowed by the corruption, widespread illiteracy, vanishing supplies, and lack of discipline.<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a> Jack Kem, deputy to the commander of NATO Training Mission Afghanistan and Combined Security Transition Command Afghanistan, stated that the literacy rate in the ANA will reach over 50% by January 2012. What began as a voluntary literacy program became mandatory for basic army training in early 2011.<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a> According to the United States Government Accounting Office (GAO), however, only 14 percent of ANA soldiers are literate at the first grade level. The GAO report further states that the illiteracy problem is a major contributing factor to the ongoing shortage of non-commissioned officers, and of enlisted men trained in technical skills, because according to the report, these positions require greater literacy. <a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a></p>
<p>In some cases, US trainers have reported missing vehicles, weapons and other military equipment, and outright theft of fuel provided by the U.S.<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a> Death threats have also been leveled against some U.S. officers who tried to stop Afghan soldiers from stealing. Some Afghan soldiers often find improvised explosive devices and snip the command wires instead of marking them and waiting for U.S. forces to come to detonate them. The Americans say this just allows the insurgents to return and reconnect them.<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a> US trainers frequently must remove the cell phones of Afghan soldiers hours before a mission for fear that the operation will be compromised by bragging, gossip and reciprocal warnings.<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a></p>
<p>In other cases American trainers spend large amounts of time verifying that Afghan rosters are accurate &lt;U+2014&gt; that they are not padded with &lt;U+201C&gt;ghosts&lt;U+201D&gt; being &lt;U+201C&gt;paid&lt;U+201D&gt; by Afghan commanders who quietly collect the bogus wages.<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a> <img src="Afghan_soldiers.jpg" title="fig:Soldiers of the Afghan National Army, including the ANA Commando Battalion standing in the front." alt="Soldiers of the Afghan National Army, including the ANA Commando Battalion standing in the front." width="300" /></p>
<p>It was reported in 2009 that in one green unit in <a href="Baghlan_Province" title="wikilink">Baghlan Province</a>, some soldiers have been found cowering in ditches rather than fighting.<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a> Some were suspected of collaborating with the Taliban against the Americans or engaging in reciprocal exchanges on offensives or unsanctioned psychological warfare through boasts or using their knowledge to communicate with friends or family in the battlezone. &quot;They don&lt;U+2019&gt;t have the basics, so they lay down,&quot; said Capt. Michael Bell, who is one of a team of U.S. and Hungarian mentors tasked with training Afghan soldiers. &quot;I ran around for an hour trying to get them to shoot, getting fired on. I couldn&lt;U+2019&gt;t get them to shoot their weapons.&quot;.<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a> For example, in multiple firefights during the February, 2010 NATO offensive in Helmand Province, many Afghan soldiers did not aim &lt;U+2014&gt; they pointed their American-issued M-16 rifles in the rough direction of the incoming small-arms fire and pulled their triggers without putting rifle sights to their eyes. Their rifle muzzles were often elevated several degrees high.<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a> During the battle for Combat Outpost Keating in October 2009, ANA troops ran away, hid under their beds, and stole from the American barracks.<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a></p>
<p>Desertion remains a problem. One in every four combat soldiers quited the ANA during the 12-month period ending in September 2009, according to data from the <a href="U.S._Defense_Department" title="wikilink">U.S. Defense Department</a> and the Inspector General for Reconstruction in Afghanistan. The problem was so severe that the army was forced to write off 2,000 soldiers and officers in a usual month. In order to filter potential deserters from the rank, some of the soldiers are trained by being deployed in real operations.<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a> According to NATO statistics, the attrition rate averaged 32 per cent annually over the 12 months that ended in November 2011.<a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a></p>
<p>Included in the controversy of developing the ANA, Germany alleged that the US military took 15% of &lt;U+20AC&gt;50 million the German government gave to a trust fund to build up the ANA.<a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a></p>
<p>According to Marin Strmecki, a member of the Defense Policy Board and a former top Pentagon adviser on Afghanistan in a speech to the <a href="United_States_Senate" title="wikilink">United States Senate</a>, &quot;the Afghan Army should increase to 250,000 soldiers... Only when Afghan security forces reaches those numbers would they achieve the level necessary for success in counterinsurgency.&quot;<a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a> In 2009, U.S. <a href="Barack_Obama" title="wikilink">Barack Obama</a> called for an expansion of the Afghan National Army to 260,000 soldiers.

<h3 id="kandak">Kandak</h3>
<p>The basic unit in the Afghan National Army is the <em>kandak</em> (battalion), consisting of 600 troops. Kandaks may be further broken down into four <em>toli</em> (company-sized units).<a href="#fn70" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a> Although the vast majority of kandaks are infantry, at least one mechanized and one tank battalion have been formed; more may be planned. Every ANA Corps will be assigned an <a href="ANA_Commando_Brigade" title="wikilink">ANA Commando Brigade</a> with the sixth designated as a special national unit under the Afghan Defense Ministry's purview.</p>

<p>, 28 of the 31 Afghan National Army battalions were ready for combat operations and many had already participated in them. At least nine brigades are planned at this time, each consisting of six battalions. By March 1, 2007, half of the planned army of 70,000 ANA soldiers had been achieved with 46 of the planned 76 Afghan battalions operating in the fore or in concert with NATO forces. The size and limits of the ANA were specified in the <a href="Bonn" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bonn</a> II Agreement, signed in 2002. This agreement called for the establishment of the ANA and formal development of Afghan forces under NATO doctrine.</p>

<p>A total of 14 brigades that will primarily be regionally oriented are planned for 2008. According to <a href="Combined_Security_Transition_Command_-_Afghanistan" title="wikilink">Combined Security Transition Command - Afghanistan</a> (CSTC-A) thirteen of these brigades are to be light infantry, one will be mechanized and one will be commando.</p>

Each corps has three to four subordinate brigades, and each brigade has four infantry battalions as its basic fighting unit. Each infantry battalion is assigned a specific area for which it is responsible, the battalion's mission is to secure its area from internal and external threats. Originally, the four outlying corps were assigned one or two brigades, with the majority of the manpower of the army based in Kabul's 201st Corps. This was superseded by a buildup in which each corps added extra brigades. Establishment of the corps started when four regional corps commanders and some of their staff were appointed on 1 September 2004.</p>

On the ANA side,  all training and education in the Army is managed and implemented by the newly formed Afghan National Army Training Command (ANATC), a two-star command which reports directly to the Chief of the General Staff. All training centers and military schools are under ANATC HQ. The coalition forces are partnered with the ANA to mentor and support formal training through <a href="Task_Force_Phoenix" title="wikilink">Task Force Phoenix</a>. This program was formalized in April 2003, based near the <a href="Kabul_Military_Training_Center" title="wikilink">Kabul Military Training Center</a> coordinating collective and individual training, mentoring, and Coalition Force support.</p>
<p>Each ANA HQ above battalion level has an embedded <a href="Operational_Mentor_and_Liaison_Team" title="wikilink">Operational Mentor and Liaison Team</a> (OMLT) of NATO trainers and mentors acting as liaisons between ANA and <a href="International_Security_Assistance_Force" title="wikilink">ISAF</a>.

Basic training has been expanded to include required literacy courses for recruits who don't already know how to read.</p>
<p>A <a href="French_Army" title="wikilink">French Army</a> advisory team oversees the training of officers for staff and platoon or company command in a combined commissioning/infantry officer training unit called the Officer Training Brigade, also located at Kabul Military Training Center. OTB candidates in the platoon- and company- command courses are usually older former militia and mujaheddin leaders with various levels of military experience.</p>
<p>The <a href="United_Kingdom" title="wikilink">United Kingdom</a> also conducts initial infantry officer training and commissioning at the Officer Candidate School. While OCS is administratively under OTB's control, it is kept functionally separate. OCS candidates are young men with little or no military experience. The <a href="British_Army" title="wikilink">British Army</a> also conduct initial and advanced <a href="Non-Commissioned_Officer" title="wikilink">Non-Commissioned Officer</a> training as well in a separate NCO Training Brigade.</p>
<p>The <a href="Canadian_Forces" title="wikilink">Canadian Forces</a> supervises the Combined Training Exercise portion of initial military training, where trainee soldiers, NCOs, and officers are brought together in field training exercises at the <a href="platoon" class="uri" title="wikilink">platoon</a>, <a href="company_(military_unit)" title="wikilink">company</a> and (theoretically) <a href="battalion" class="uri" title="wikilink">battalion</a> levels to certify them ready for field operations. In the Regional Corps, line ANA battalions have attached Coalition <a href="Embedded_Training_Teams" title="wikilink">Embedded Training Teams</a> that continue to mentor the battalion's leadership, and advise in the areas of intelligence, communications, fire support, logistics and infantry tactics.</p>
<p>Formal education and professional development is currently conducted at two main ANATC schools, both in Kabul. The <a href="National_Military_Academy_of_Afghanistan" title="wikilink">National Military Academy of Afghanistan</a>, located near <a href="Kabul_International_Airport" title="wikilink">Kabul International Airport</a>, is a four-year military university, which will produce degreed second lieutenants in a variety of military professions. NMAA's first cadet class entered its second academic year in spring 2006. A contingent of US and <a href="Turkish_Army" title="wikilink">Turkish military</a> instructors jointly mentor the NMAA faculty and staff. The Command and General Staff College, located in southern Kabul, prepares mid-level ANA officers to serve on brigade and corps staffs. France established the CGSC in early 2004, and a cadre of French Army instructors continues to oversee operations at the school. A National Defense University will also be established at a potential site in northwestern Kabul. Eventually all initial officer training (to include the NMAA) as well as the CGSC will be re-located to the new NDU facility.</p>
<p>According to Lieutenant Colonel Kane Mangin of the Australian-led of the International Artillery Training Team, the Afghan National Army (ANA) Artillery Training School in Kabul is expected to train enough officers and NCOs for about 23 artillery batteries, using the D-30 howitzers of the ANA Artillery Branch.</p>

<p>According to statements made by Colonel Thomas McGrath on October 19, 2007 the coalition supporting the build-up of the ANA has seen progress and is pleased with the Afghan performance in recent exercises. McGrath estimated that the ANA should be capable of carrying out independent brigade-size operations by the spring of 2008.<a href="#fn129" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref129"><sup>129</sup></a> However, as of October 1, 2011, four years after McGrath's estimated date for independent brigade-size operations, not a single one of the ANA's 180 battalions can carry out independent operations, much less an entire brigade.<a href="#fn130" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref130"><sup>130</sup></a></p>
<p>On December 23, 2007, the <a href="CTV_News" title="wikilink">CTV</a> and <a href="CBC_News" title="wikilink">CBC</a> television network reported that <a href="Canada" class="uri" title="wikilink">Canada</a>'s military will supply the Afghan National Army with surplus <a href="Colt_Canada_C7_rifle" title="wikilink">Colt Canada C7 rifles</a> in order to bring the ANA up to <a href="NATO" class="uri" title="wikilink">NATO</a> equipment standards.<a href="#fn131" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref131"><sup>131</sup></a></p>
<p>The Afghan National Army has a contract with International Trucks. It will provide a fleet of 2,781 trucks which can be used for transporting personnel, water, petroleum and a recovery truck. The Afghan National Army has already received 374 out of the 2,781 trucks.</p>
<p>The <a href="Czech_Republic" title="wikilink">Czech Republic</a> and <a href="Hungary" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hungary</a> have announced they will donate advanced air medic choppers to the Army and National Police, as well as more new trucks for border security in the Afghan-Pakistan frontier to defend it from Pakistani Taliban incursions.</p>
<p><a href="Greece" class="uri" title="wikilink">Greece</a> is donating at least 13 <a href="M60A3" class="uri" title="wikilink">M60A3</a> main battle tanks to help bolster Afghan tank platoons. Greece may increase this number to almost 50 tanks, within the alliance&lt;U+2019&gt;s efforts for equipping and training Afghan military forces.<a href="#fn132" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref132"><sup>132</sup></a> On November 12, 2009, the Canadian <a href="Chief_of_the_Defence_Staff_(Canada)" title="wikilink">Chief of the Defence Staff</a> <a href="Walter_Natynczyk" title="wikilink">Walter Natynczyk</a> declared the Afghan National Army will not receive the Canadian <a href="Leopard_1" title="wikilink">Leopard 1</a> as anticipated by <a href="Abdul_Rahim_Wardak" title="wikilink">Abdul Rahim Wardak</a> in 2007. General <a href="Walter_Natynczyk" title="wikilink">Walter Natynczyk</a> declared the Afghan National Army maybe have access to surplus supplies and also <a href="M113_armored_personnel_carrier" title="wikilink">M-113</a> recently modernized.<a href="#fn133" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref133"><sup>133</sup></a> The reason for the reversal of delivery of tanks is probably connected to Long War Journal reports that the single Afghan tank and mechanised battalions are operating as infantry due to inadequate heavy equipment maintenance.<a href="#fn134" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref134"><sup>134</sup></a></p>
<p>According to Marin Strmecki, a member of the Defense Policy Board and a former top Pentagon adviser on Afghanistan in a speech to the <a href="United_States_Senate" title="wikilink">United States Senate</a>, &quot;the Afghan Army should increase to 250,000 soldiers and the National Police Force should add more than 100,000 officers. Only when Afghan security forces reaches those numbers would they achieve the level necessary for success in counterinsurgency.&quot;<a href="#fn135" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref135"><sup>135</sup></a> On March 19, 2009, American President <a href="Barack_Obama" title="wikilink">Barack Obama</a> called for an expansion of the Afghan National Army to 260,000 soldiers. The cost would reach $20 billion dollars and would beef up Afghan manpower as well as inject the army with more modern equipment.<a href="#fn136" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref136"><sup>136</sup></a></p>
<p>Sales of US Arms to Afghanistan alone totaled nearly $20 billion for fiscal years 2009 through 2011.<a href="#fn137" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref137"><sup>137</sup></a></p>

The army is financially unsustainable even at 70,000 strong and not being trained for combat in small units.</li>
