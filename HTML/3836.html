<p><strong>Southport</strong> is a <a href="seaside_resort" title="wikilink">seaside town</a> on the <a href="Irish_Sea" title="wikilink">Irish Sea</a> coast situated within the <a href="Metropolitan_Borough_of_Sefton" title="wikilink">Metropolitan Borough of Sefton</a>, in <a href="England" class="uri" title="wikilink">England</a>. The town is located  to the north of <a href="Liverpool" class="uri" title="wikilink">Liverpool</a> and  west-southwest of <a href="Preston" class="uri" title="wikilink">Preston</a>. Southport has a population of around 100,000,<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> with approximately 40% of the population over 55 years old and around 55% defined as <a href="NRS_social_grade" title="wikilink">social class ABC1</a>.</p>

<p>The town contains examples of <a href="Victorian_architecture" title="wikilink">Victorian architecture</a> and <a href="town_planning" title="wikilink">town planning</a>. These include much of <a href="Lord_Street" title="wikilink">Lord Street</a> in addition to Cambridge Hall, Town Hall and Wayfarers' Arcade. A particular feature of the town is the extensive tree planting. This was one of the conditions required by the Hesketh family when they made land available for development in the 19th century. Hesketh Park at the northern end of the town is named after the Hesketh family.</p>
<p>Extensive sand dunes stretch for several kilometers between <a href="Birkdale" class="uri" title="wikilink">Birkdale</a> and <a href="Ainsdale" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ainsdale</a>/<a href="Woodvale,_Merseyside" title="wikilink">Woodvale</a> to the south of the town. The <a href="Ainsdale" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ainsdale</a> sand dunes have been designated as a <a href="National_Nature_Reserves_in_England" title="wikilink">National Nature Reserve in England</a> and a <a href="Ramsar_Convention" title="wikilink">Ramsar</a> site.

<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<p><img src="William_Sutton_plaque.JPG" title="fig:Plaque dedicated to William Sutton, located on the corner of Duke Street, Southport." alt="Plaque dedicated to William Sutton, located on the corner of Duke Street, Southport." /> Southport, in its present form, was founded by <a href="William_Sutton_(Southport)" title="wikilink">William Sutton</a> (&quot;The Mad Duke&quot;) in 1792. However, there have been settlements in the area for much longer than that: the northern part of the town around St Cuthbert's Church (in the part of the parish of <a href="North_Meols" title="wikilink">North Meols</a> now known as <a href="Churchtown,_Sefton" title="wikilink">Churchtown</a>), was mentioned in the <a href="Domesday_Book" title="wikilink">Domesday Book</a>, and some areas of the town have names of <a href="Viking" class="uri" title="wikilink">Viking</a> origin.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p>Southport grew quickly in the 19th century as it gained a reputation for being a more refined seaside resort than its neighbour-up-the-coast <a href="Blackpool" class="uri" title="wikilink">Blackpool</a>. The permanent funfair, <a href="Pleasureland_Southport" title="wikilink">Pleasureland</a> closed in late 2006.</p>
<p>Southport's suburbs are built around, and still named after, the old villages of the area. From north to south, the districts are: <a href="Crossens" class="uri" title="wikilink">Crossens</a>, <a href="Marshside,_Sefton" title="wikilink">Marshside</a>, <a href="Churchtown,_Sefton" title="wikilink">Churchtown</a>, <a href="Blowick" class="uri" title="wikilink">Blowick</a>, <a href="Birkdale" class="uri" title="wikilink">Birkdale</a>, Hillside, <a href="Ainsdale" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ainsdale</a>, and <a href="Woodvale,_Merseyside" title="wikilink">Woodvale</a>; home to <a href="RAF_Woodvale" title="wikilink">RAF Woodvale</a>.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> The town of <a href="Formby" class="uri" title="wikilink">Formby</a> is south of Southport, with <a href="Hightown,_Sefton" title="wikilink">Hightown</a> and <a href="Liverpool" class="uri" title="wikilink">Liverpool</a> further southward, along the <a href="A565_road" title="wikilink">A565 road</a>.</p>
<p><a href="Napoleon_III_of_France" title="wikilink">Louis-Napol&lt;U+00E9&gt;on Bonaparte</a> lived in exile on Lord Street, the main thoroughfare of Southport, between 1846 and 1848, before returning to France, where he became <a href="President_of_France" title="wikilink">President</a> and subsequently <a href="List_of_French_monarchs" title="wikilink">Emperor of the French</a>. During his reign, he caused much of the medieval centre of Paris to be replaced with broad tree-lined boulevards, covered walkways and arcades, just like Lord Street. On the strength of this coincidence, it has been suggested that the redevelopment may have been inspired by memories of Southport's town centre.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<p><img src="Southport_lifeboat_disaster_memorial_1.JPG" title="fig:Memorial to the crew of the &quot;Eliza Fernley&quot; lifeboat, in Duke Street Cemetery, Southport." alt="Memorial to the crew of the &quot;Eliza Fernley&quot; lifeboat, in Duke Street Cemetery, Southport." /> On the night of the <a href="December_9" title="wikilink">December 9</a>, <a href="1886" class="uri" title="wikilink">1886</a>, the worst <a href="Southport_and_St_Anne&#39;s_lifeboats_disaster" title="wikilink">lifeboat disaster</a> in the history of the UK occurred off the shores of Southport. A cargo ship called the <em>Mexico</em> was on its way to <a href="South_America" title="wikilink">South America</a> when it found itself in difficulty. Lifeboats from <a href="Lytham" class="uri" title="wikilink">Lytham</a>, <a href="St._Annes" title="wikilink">St. Annes</a> and Southport set off in order to try and rescue those aboard the vessel. The crews battled against storm-force winds as they rowed towards the casualty. The entire crew from the St. Anne&lt;U+2019&gt;s boat was lost and all but two of the Southport crew were too. In all, 28 lifeboatmen lost their lives on that night, leaving many widows and fatherless children. A memorial was erected in Duke Street Cemetery and a permanent exhibition can be seen in the Museum of the Botanic Gardens in Churchtown, Southport.</p>
<p>In 1925, the <a href="RNLI" class="uri" title="wikilink">RNLI</a> abandoned the station at Southport and left the town with no lifeboat. However in the late 1980s, after a series of unfortunate tragedies, local families from Southport started to raise funds and eventually bought a new lifeboat for the town stationed at the old RNLI lifeboat house.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> The lifeboat is completely independent from the RNLI and receives no money from them. Instead it relies entirely on donations from the public.</p>
<h2 id="geography-and-climate">Geography and Climate</h2>
<p>At  the town is situated in <a href="North_West_England" title="wikilink">North West England</a>. The closest cities are <a href="Preston" class="uri" title="wikilink">Preston</a> approximately  to the north east and <a href="Liverpool" class="uri" title="wikilink">Liverpool</a> approximately  to the south.</p>
<p>Existing on the <a href="West_Lancashire_Coastal_Plain" title="wikilink">West Lancashire Coastal Plain</a> most of the town is only slightly above sea-level and thus parts of Southport used to be susceptible to <a href="flooding" class="uri" title="wikilink">flooding</a>. This would be most frequently noticed on Southport's Marine Drive, which was regularly closed due to flooding from <a href="high_tide" title="wikilink">high tides</a>. But in February 1997, new <a href="sea_defences" title="wikilink">sea defences</a> started being constructed and in 2002 the whole project was completed.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<p>Southport has a <a href="Oceanic_climate" title="wikilink">maritime climate</a> like most of the UK. Due to its position by the coast, Southport rarely sees substantial <a href="snowfall" class="uri" title="wikilink">snowfall</a> and temperatures rarely fall below &lt;U+2013&gt;5&lt;U+00B0&gt;C so it doesn't have frequent <a href="frost" title="wikilink">frosts</a>. Southport generally has moderate precipitation, unlike the rest of western UK.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>

<h2 id="governance-and-politics">Governance and politics</h2>
<p>Politically, Southport is a stronghold of the <a href="Liberal_Democrats_(UK)" title="wikilink">Liberal Democrats</a> with the <a href="Conservative_Party_(UK)" title="wikilink">Conservative Party</a> also strong in some areas. <a href="John_Pugh" title="wikilink">John Pugh</a> is <a href="Southport_(UK_Parliament_constituency)" title="wikilink">Southport</a>'s current <a href="Member_of_Parliament" title="wikilink">Member of Parliament</a>.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<p>Southport lies within the <a href="Historic_counties_of_England" title="wikilink">historic county boundaries</a> of <a href="Lancashire" class="uri" title="wikilink">Lancashire</a>, and was incorporated as <a href="municipal_borough" title="wikilink">municipal borough</a> in 1866. It became a <a href="county_borough" title="wikilink">county borough</a> independent of the <a href="administrative_counties_of_England" title="wikilink">administrative county</a> of Lancashire in 1915, having reached the minimum 50,000 population (the 1911 census gave a figure of 51,643). The <a href="Birkdale" class="uri" title="wikilink">Birkdale</a> Urban District, including the parishes of Birkdale and Ainsdale was added to Southport in 1912.</p>
<p>Under the 1971 Local Government White Paper, presented in February 1971, Southport would have lost its county borough status, becoming a <a href="non-metropolitan_district" title="wikilink">non-metropolitan district</a> within Lancashire. Rather than accept this fate and lose its separate education and social services departments, Southport Corporation lobbied for inclusion in the nearby planned <a href="metropolitan_county" title="wikilink">metropolitan county</a> of <a href="Merseyside" class="uri" title="wikilink">Merseyside</a>, to join with <a href="Bootle" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bootle</a> and other units to form a district with the 250,000 required population. It was duly included in the <a href="Metropolitan_Borough_of_Sefton" title="wikilink">Metropolitan Borough of Sefton</a><a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<p>This decision has been regretted by some of the population. A recurring local political issue has been the cross-party movement campaigning for Southport to leave Sefton and form its own <a href="unitary_authority" title="wikilink">unitary authority</a>, perhaps adjoined to the neighbouring <a href="West_Lancashire" title="wikilink">West Lancashire</a> authority. Support for this has been seen amongst <a href="Liberal_Democrat_(UK)" title="wikilink">Liberal Democrat (UK)</a> councillors,<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> and also within the Southport <a href="Conservative_Party_(UK)" title="wikilink">Conservative Party (UK)</a>.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1980, a <a href="Private_Member&#39;s_Bill" title="wikilink">Private Member's Bill</a> proposed restoring Southport to Lancashire, and renaming the residue of Sefton to the Metropolitan Borough of Bootle. The <a href="Local_Government_Boundary_Commission_for_England" title="wikilink">Local Government Boundary Commission for England</a> conducted a review of the area in 1987, which attracted 10,000 messages, of which &quot;70% were <a href="pro_forma" title="wikilink">pro forma</a>&quot;. In 1990 the LGBC made suggestions that Southport, Ainsdale and Birkdale should be made a district of Lancashire: the final recommendations in 1991 &quot;concluded that public opinion was more evenly divided than initially thought&quot;, and also that eastward transport links with Lancashire were poor compared to those southward to the Liverpool area.</p>
<p>The government again directed the <a href="Local_Government_Commission_for_England_(1992)" title="wikilink">Local Government Commission for England</a> to make a review in December 1996 (after it had finished the work on the <a href="1990s_UK_local_government_reform" title="wikilink">creation of unitary authorities</a>), commencing in January 1997. This review was constrained by the legal inability of the commission to recommend that the current Sefton-West Lancashire border be altered. In an MORI poll conducted at the behest of the LGCE, 65% of Southport residents supported the campaign, compared to 37% in the borough as a whole. Local MPs <a href="Matthew_Banks" title="wikilink">Matthew Banks</a> and <a href="Ronnie_Fearn" title="wikilink">Ronnie Fearn</a> (MPs for Southport at various times) supported making Southport a unitary authority, with Banks wishing to see it tied to Lancashire <a href="ceremonial_counties_of_England" title="wikilink">ceremonially</a>, but Fearn wishing to see it remain, as a separate borough, in Merseyside.</p>
<p>The commission noted that Southport would have a relatively low population for a unitary authority, even including Formby (89,300 or 114,700), and that it was worried about the viability of a south Sefton authority without Southport, and therefore recommended the status quo be kept. However, the commission suggested the use of <a href="area_committee" title="wikilink">area committees</a> for the various parts of the borough and also that Southport could become a <a href="civil_parish" title="wikilink">civil parish</a>.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> Another request made in 2004 was turned down, the <a href="Electoral_Commission_(United_Kingdom)" title="wikilink">Electoral Commission (United Kingdom)</a> must request such a review).</p>
<p>In 2002, a local independent party calling themselves the Southport Party was established, with many members supporting a policy of &quot;Southport out of Sefton&quot;. Three council seats were won in the 2002 local elections, including that of the leader of Sefton Council, Liberal Democrat Councillor, David Bamber. At the following election there were no gains and a drop in the number of votes for the party. At the all out election in 2004, 1 of their councillors stood down, whilst the other 2 lost their seats. They have not regained any seats, although the group retains a campagning presence in the town.</p>
<p>To date, there have been no further moves to change Sefton's boundaries, but the Boundary Commission indicated in 2004 that a future review is possible:</p>
<dl>

<dd><em>&quot;whether or not structural change takes place in accordance with our recommendations, the boundaries between or within Sefton and West Lancashire could be reviewed at a later stage to address these long-standing boundary concerns.&quot;</em><a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a>

<h2 id="education">Education</h2>

<p>The town possesses a variety of academic institutions, both private and state-funded. The prestigious all-girls' <a href="Greenbank_High_School" title="wikilink">Greenbank High School</a> situated next to the <a href="Royal_Birkdale_Golf_Club" title="wikilink">Royal Birkdale Golf Club</a>, repeatedly gains grades of the highest standard.

The male equivalent (also situated in <a href="Birkdale" class="uri" title="wikilink">Birkdale</a>) is the all-boys' Birkdale High School, also known for its academic success. There are several other high schools prominent in the town, including <a href="Stanley_High_School" title="wikilink">Stanley High School</a>, (which is a specialist Sports College), Meols Cop High School, and <a href="Christ_the_King_Catholic_High_School" title="wikilink">Christ the King School</a>.</p>
<p><a href="King_George_V_College" title="wikilink">King George V College</a>, is one of the most respected <a href="sixth_form_college" title="wikilink">sixth form colleges</a> in the area, which sees pupils travel far and wide (from <a href="Maghull" class="uri" title="wikilink">Maghull</a>, <a href="Bootle" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bootle</a> etc) to sample its academic success. Its academic achievements repeatedly rival some of the private institutions in the surrounding area, including <a href="Merchant_Taylors&#39;_School,_Crosby" title="wikilink">Merchant Taylors</a> and <a href="St_Mary&#39;s_College,_Crosby" title="wikilink">St Mary's College</a> in <a href="Crosby,_Merseyside" title="wikilink">Crosby</a>.

<li><em>from the south</em> - junction 3 of the <a href="M58_motorway" title="wikilink">M58</a> (on the A570, twelve miles)</li>
<li><em>from the north</em> - junction 1 of the <a href="M65_motorway" title="wikilink">M65</a> (on the <a href="A582_road" title="wikilink">A582</a>/<a href="A59_road" title="wikilink">A59</a>, nineteen miles)</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="Marine_Way_Bridge.JPG" title="fig:Marine Way Bridge." alt="Marine Way Bridge." /> An east-west bypass for the A570 at <a href="Ormskirk" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ormskirk</a> is planned to relieve congestion on Southport's main access route to the motorway network, although the effectiveness of the proposals are still under debate.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a></p>
<p>Several areas within Southport town centre have recently undergone major road redevelopment; the largest scheme was the construction of the Marine Way Bridge (opened May 2004), which connects the Lord Street shopping district with the new seafront developments. The 150 foot high structure is thought to have cost in the region of &lt;U+00A3&gt;5m.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a></p>
<p>Also one of the main shopping areas in the town, Chapel Street, has undergone a pedestrianisation scheme to be similar to parts of Liverpool city centre.</p>
<h3 id="aviation">Aviation</h3>
<p>Southport is also home to Birkdale Sands, a sand runway located on one of Southport's beaches. For many years this was used for pleasure flights using one of the last <a href="De_Havilland" title="wikilink">De Havilland</a> <a href="De_Havilland_Fox_Moth" title="wikilink">Fox Moth</a> <a href="aeroplane" title="wikilink">aeroplanes</a> flying in the UK.</p>
<h3 id="rail">Rail</h3>
<p><img src="Southport_railway_station.JPG" title="fig:Southport railway station." alt="Southport railway station." /> Southport has a <a href="Southport_railway_station" title="wikilink">railway station</a> with a frequent service of electric trains to <a href="Liverpool" class="uri" title="wikilink">Liverpool</a> and a regular service to <a href="Wigan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Wigan</a>, <a href="Bolton,_Greater_Manchester" title="wikilink">Bolton</a>, <a href="Manchester" class="uri" title="wikilink">Manchester</a>, <a href="Manchester_Airport" title="wikilink">Manchester Airport</a> and <a href="Rochdale" class="uri" title="wikilink">Rochdale</a>.</p>
<p>The Liverpool line was originally built by the <a href="Liverpool,_Crosby_and_Southport_Railway" title="wikilink">Liverpool, Crosby and Southport Railway</a> in 1848. It was followed on <a href="9_April" title="wikilink">9 April</a> <a href="1855" class="uri" title="wikilink">1855</a> by the <a href="Manchester_and_Southport_Railway" title="wikilink">Manchester and Southport Railway</a> with a line to Manchester via <a href="Wigan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Wigan</a>.</p>
<p>Formerly, Southport was also served by two further railway lines:</p>
<ul>
<li>From 1882, the <a href="West_Lancashire_Railway" title="wikilink">West Lancashire Railway</a> operated from <a href="Southport_Derby_Road_railway_station" title="wikilink">Southport Derby Road</a> station to <a href="Preston_Fishergate_Hill" title="wikilink">Preston Fishergate Hill</a>. This line was shut in 1964, however. Nowadays, the towns of Southport and Preston are linked only by the (largely dual-carriageway) A565 and A59 roads.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>In 1884, another line from Southport to Liverpool was opened: the <a href="Cheshire_Lines_Committee" title="wikilink">Cheshire Lines Committee</a>'s <a href="Southport_&amp;_Cheshire_Lines_Extension_Railway" title="wikilink">Southport &amp; Cheshire Lines Extension Railway</a> extended the CLC's <a href="North_Liverpool_Extension_Line" title="wikilink">North Liverpool Extension Line</a> from <a href="Liverpool_Central_railway_station" title="wikilink">Liverpool Central</a> to <a href="Southport_Lord_Street_railway_station" title="wikilink">Southport Lord Street</a>. The West Lancashire Railway sponsored the <a href="Liverpool,_Southport_and_Preston_Junction_Railway" title="wikilink">Liverpool, Southport and Preston Junction Railway</a> to provide a connection to the CLC line, joining it at Altcar and Hillhouse.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> These lines ultimately proved uncompetitive, however, and the Southport services were withdrawn in 1952.</li>
</ul>
<p>In July 1897, both the West Lancashire and the Liverpool, Southport and Preston Junction Railways were absorbed into the <a href="Lancashire_and_Yorkshire_Railway" title="wikilink">Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway</a> (L&amp;Y). The L&amp;Y had a large terminus at Southport Chapel Street and could see no sense in operating two termini at very close proximity. In 1901, the L&amp;Y completed a remodeling of the approach lines to Central to allow trains to divert onto the Manchester to Southport line and into Southport Chapel Street Station. Southport Central was closed to passengers and it became a goods depot eventually amalgamating with Chapel Street depot. It survived intact well into the 1970s.</p>
<h2 id="sports">Sports</h2>
<p><img src="haig_Avenue.JPG" title="fig:Haig Avenue, home of Southport F.C." alt="Haig Avenue, home of Southport F.C." /> Southport is somewhat lesser known for its sporting prowess, but being surrounded by other North West cities this is understandable. The eastern side of town towards Blowick and Kew is home to the &quot;Sandgrounders&quot; - <a href="Southport_F.C." title="wikilink">Southport F.C.</a>, a club with a long football league history and occasional <a href="FA_Cup" title="wikilink">FA Cup</a> giantkillers, they play at <a href="Haig_Avenue" title="wikilink">Haig Avenue</a> and currently find themselves in the <a href="Conference_North" title="wikilink">Conference North</a> League. There is also a league for local amateur football teams. Southport is also home to a rugby union club, Southport RUFC,<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> who play at the Recreational Ground on Waterloo Road, Hillside.</p>
<p>Southport is also home to one of the largest junior football clubs in the north west, boasting both a boys' and girls' sections, as well as male and female. The youngest boys' team are Under 7s, with the girls being Under 9s. The club has been the foundations for many professional footballers, including Dominic Matteo, Shaun Teale and Paul Dalgleish.</p>
<p>The junior section of Southport RUFC are known as the Southport Sharks,<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> and have sides that range from 7 years old upwards. They also play on the same grounds, and train every Sunday 10am-12noon.</p>
<p>However, the town is probably best known for <a href="golf" class="uri" title="wikilink">golf</a>; the <a href="Royal_Birkdale_Golf_Club" title="wikilink">Royal Birkdale Golf Club</a> situated in the dunes to the south of the town is one of the venues on <a href="The_Open_Championship" title="wikilink">The Open Championship</a> rotation and has hosted two <a href="Ryder_Cup" title="wikilink">Ryder Cups</a>. Nearby <a href="Southport_and_Ainsdale_Golf_Club" title="wikilink">Southport and Ainsdale Golf Club</a> is also a two time Ryder Cup venue and <a href="Hillside_Golf_Club" title="wikilink">Hillside Golf Club</a> hosts many major events as well as being a final open qualifying course. Many smaller links courses also surround the town. Southport also holds its own small skatepark, located next to the Marine Way Bridge. It is open to skateboarders and BMX riders.</p>
<p><img src="PC310021.JPG" title="fig:Sculler on Marine Lake." alt="Sculler on Marine Lake." /> Southport's location by the coast also lends itself to some more specialised sporting activities - Ainsdale Beach, south of the town, is popular for kite sports, including kite-surfing. In 1925, <a href="Henry_Segrave" title="wikilink">Henry Segrave</a> set a world <a href="land_speed_record" title="wikilink">land speed record</a> of 152.33 mph on the beach, driving the <a href="Sunbeam_Tiger_(1925)" title="wikilink">Sunbeam Tiger</a>. His association is largely forgotten locally, but is commemorated by the name of a pub on Lord St.</p>
<p>Marine Lake lies nestled between the town centre and the sea and is used for a variety of water-sports including water-skiing, sailing and rowing. The lake is home to the <a href="West_Lancs_Yacht_Club" title="wikilink">West Lancashire Yacht Club</a> and Southport Sailing Club, both of which organise <a href="dinghy" class="uri" title="wikilink">dinghy</a> racing. The annual <a href="Southport_24_Hour_Race" title="wikilink">Southport 24 Hour Race</a>, organised by the West Lancashire Yacht Club, is an endurance race of national standing, with an average turnout of 60 to 80 boats. In 2006, the event marked its 40th anniversary.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a></p>
<p>The flat and scenic route alongside the beach is very popular with cyclists, and is the start of the <a href="Trans_Pennine_Trail" title="wikilink">Trans Pennine Trail</a>, a <a href="National_Cycle_Network" title="wikilink">cycle route</a> running across the north of the country to <a href="Selby" class="uri" title="wikilink">Selby</a> in <a href="North_Yorkshire" title="wikilink">North Yorkshire</a>, through <a href="Kingston_upon_Hull" title="wikilink">Hull</a> and on to <a href="Hornsea" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hornsea</a> on the east coast.</p>
<h2 id="scouting">Scouting</h2>
<p>The scouting district of Southport has always been an active one, Southport Scouts has been around since the start of scouting and has had a very full history. Currently there are approximately 700 members in the Southport area and there are 12 groups with two Explorer units.</p>
<p>Southport scouts engage in several different town events such as the carnival.</p>
<p>The Southport District Scout Headquarters is Waterside Lodge which is situated next to the Marine Lake. The scouts in this district and many nearby scout districts use Waterside for activities such as canoeing, kayaking, sailing, bell boating and dragon boating and various land activities.</p>
