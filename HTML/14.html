<p><strong>Hajnal Ban</strong> (also known as <strong>Hajnal Black</strong>) is an Australian author, right wing politician and convicted of charges that prevent her being elected to public office for four years.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> She was elected 15 March 2008 a councillor for <a href="Logan_City" title="wikilink">Logan City</a> but was disqualified from 27 March 2012. Previously she was a councillor for the (now defunct) <a href="Shire_of_Beaudesert" title="wikilink">Beaudesert Shire</a> Council from 27 March 2004. She was an unsuccessful <a href="National_Party_of_Australia" title="wikilink">National Party</a> candidate for the federal seat of <a href="Division_of_Forde" title="wikilink">Forde</a>, south of Brisbane, at the 2007 federal election. She won <a href="Liberal_National_Party_of_Queensland" title="wikilink">Liberal National Party</a> selection for the newly-created federal seat of <a href="Division_of_Wright" title="wikilink">Wright</a> in November 2009 but subsequently lost endorsement following allegations that she mismanaged the funds of a 65-year-old man.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> She had meantime openly acknowledged that she was backed by the Australian TEA Party (and <a href="English_Defence_League" title="wikilink">Australian Defence League</a>, ADL, group) with David Goodridge<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>In 2002 she underwent surgery to increase the length of each leg by 8 cm. She published her experiences in the book <em>God Made Me Small, Surgery Made Me Tall</em> under the <a href="pseudonym" class="uri" title="wikilink">pseudonym</a> Sara Vornamen. She also released a book called <em>Her Secret</em>.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a><a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="early-life">Early life</h2>
<p>Hajnal Ban was born in <a href="Afula" class="uri" title="wikilink">Afula</a>, <a href="Israel" class="uri" title="wikilink">Israel</a>, to <a href="Hungary" title="wikilink">Hungarian</a> parents.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> Ban's grandfather was an Eastern European <a href="Judaism" title="wikilink">Jewish</a> <a href="The_Holocaust" title="wikilink">Holocaust</a> survivor who moved the family to Israel in 1976 to escape communism.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> The family moved to <a href="Austria" class="uri" title="wikilink">Austria</a> in 1980 and then immigrated to <a href="Logan_City" title="wikilink">Logan City</a>, south of <a href="Brisbane" class="uri" title="wikilink">Brisbane</a>, <a href="Australia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Australia</a> in 1983. On gaining pre-selection for a Federal seat, Ban relinquished her Israeli citizenship as <a href="Section_44_of_the_Australian_Constitution" title="wikilink">Section 44 of the Australian Constitution</a> forbids the election of people holding dual citizenship to its parliament.</p>
<h2 id="education">Education</h2>
<p>Ban was educated at <a href="Marsden,_Queensland" title="wikilink">Marsden</a> Primary School and then <a href="Marsden_State_High_School" title="wikilink">Marsden State High School</a> in <a href="Logan_City" title="wikilink">Logan City</a>, graduating in 1995. After high school she entered <a href="Griffith_University" title="wikilink">Griffith University's</a> <a href="Griffith_Law_School" title="wikilink">law school</a> and completed a double degree in Law and International Business. Ban was then admitted as a Barrister-at-Law in 2001.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="leg-lengthening-surgery">Leg lengthening surgery</h2>
<p>In 2002 Ban undertook radical cosmetic surgery to gain 8 cm of height. She travelled to the <a href="Russian_Ilizarov_Scientific_Center_for_Restorative_Traumatology_and_Orthopaedics" title="wikilink">Russian Ilizarov Scientific Center for Restorative Traumatology and Orthopaedics</a> in <a href="Kurgan,_Kurgan_Oblast" title="wikilink">Kurgan</a>, Russia where she was operated on by Dr Constantine Novikov.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a><a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<p>Over a period of 5 months Ban was bedridden as her legs were lengthened. The process of lengthening took 12 months. She returned to Australia and talked to the media about her operation under the pseudonym Sara Vornamen in an attempt to hide her identity. Under the name 'Sara Vornamen' Hajnal Ban wrote a book about her surgery, <em>God made me small, Surgery made me Tall</em>.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a><a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<p>Brisbane's <a href="The_Courier-Mail" title="wikilink">Courier-Mail</a> revealed in April 2009 that Ban was actually Sara Vornamen.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> Since that time Ban has received world wide attention for her surgery<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> and has been a commentator on issues from sex-discrimination to extra airline charges.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="personal-life">Personal life</h2>
<p>Ban made no secret of her relationship with Russell Tacon.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
<p>Ban married Logan City Councillor <a href="Sean_Black" title="wikilink">Sean Black</a> at <a href="Tamborine_Mountain" title="wikilink">Tamborine Mountain</a> on 30 May 2010.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> Black has acted as her campaign manager. She was known as <strong>Hajnal Black</strong> until they separated in mid 2012.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="political-career">Political career</h2>
<h3 id="shire-of-beaudesert-council">2004 - 2008, Shire of Beaudesert Council</h3>
<p>Hajnal Ban was first elected as Councillor for Division 4 in the former Shire of Beaudesert on 27 March 2004 at the age of 26 where she significantly outpolled her four male opponents.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> She was the youngest ever councillor to be elected in the shire and the only Barrister. She was elected to council as an independent and had no previous political party affiliation. She joined the National Party in 2006.</p>
<p>She was Chairperson of the Shire's Planning and Development Committee from April 2004, until December 2005 when she was removed from the post, a move spearheaded by Councillor John Fronis, over her opposition to the State's decision to designate the North McLean Enterprise Precinct in the <a href="South_East_Queensland" title="wikilink">South East Queensland</a> Regional Plan, which would have placed heavy industry in the middle of her rural residential division.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="federal-election">2007 Federal election</h3>
<p>In the November 2007 <a href="Australian_federal_election,_2007" title="wikilink">Federal Election</a> Ban stood as the National Party candidate for the seat of Forde.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a><a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> Although she worked hard at her campaign<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> and was credited with achieving a larger than expected swing, Ban only achieved 12.2% of the primary vote.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> The Forde electorate's voter base is heavily urban, so it was always unlikely the electorate would have voted for a National Party candidate over their urban Conservative sister party, the <a href="Liberal_Party_of_Australia" title="wikilink">Liberals</a>.</p>
<h3 id="local-government-elections">2008 Local Government Elections</h3>
<p>In July 2007, the Queensland <a href="Australian_Labor_Party" title="wikilink">Labor</a> <a href="Government_of_Queensland" title="wikilink">Government</a> announced widespread <a href="Local_Government_Reform_Commission" title="wikilink">reform to local government</a>. The major reform was to amalgamate many councils, and Beaudesert was included in the process. Half of the Shire was amalgamated with the <a href="Shire_of_Boonah" title="wikilink">Shire of Boonah</a> to create the <a href="Scenic_Rim_Region" title="wikilink">Scenic Rim Region</a> while the other half was amalgamated with Logan City. Hajnal Ban's entire division was in the transferring area to be amalgamated into Logan City. Her division underwent significant change as it was merged with the neighbouring Division 5 (held by John Fronis, a Labor councillor) to form the new Logan City Division 11. Fronis and Ban subsequently contested the new division at the March 2008 elections, with Ban winning convincingly, even in areas where the Labor vote at state and federal elections has historically been high. Ban achieved 66.06% of the two-candidate-preferred vote to John Fronis' 33.94%.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="post-2008-election">Post 2008 election</h3>
<p>After her election to Logan City Hajnal Ban was elected Chairperson of the Community, Sport and Customer Services Committee but was removed from this position in May 2009 and replaced by a neighbouring urban based councillor, Phil Pidgeon, because of her strong and somewhat outspoken advocacy for the amalgamated areas she represents.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a></p>
<p>Ban formed an alliance with the only other Logan City rural councillor, Sean Black, in late 2008. Together they formed a strong allegiance in council advocating and representing their similar constituencies. Ban and Black married in 2010.</p>
<h3 id="lnp-candidacy-for-wright">2010 LNP candidacy for Wright</h3>
<p>After questions were raised by Queensland&lt;U+2019&gt;s Adult Guardian about her administration of an elderly man&lt;U+2019&gt;s <a href="Estate_(law)" title="wikilink">estate</a>, the Liberal National Party revoked their endorsement of Ban as their candidate for the federal division of Wright on 7 June 2010.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> The LNP claim the Adult Guardian&lt;U+2019&gt;s questions were never disclosed in her vetting committee. Ban voluntarily surrendered her Power of Attorney on 2 July 2010 after which proceedings in the <a href="Queensland_Civil_and_Administrative_Tribunal" title="wikilink">Queensland Civil and Administrative Tribunal</a> (QCAT) were ceased.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a></p>
<p>Ban hit out at the Liberal National Party for taking pre-emptive action against her despite tribunal matters being settled within a month. She went on to say men in the LNP hierarchy were never comfortable with a woman being preselected in a winnable seat.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> She had meantime openly acknowledged that she was backed by the Australian TEA Party (and Australian Defence League, ADL, group) with David Goodridge<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a></p>
<p>2012 Logan Council Election</p>
<p>Hajnal originally nominated to run again as councillor for Division 11, but several weeks prior to the election she withdrew from the contest. As of the 28th of April 2012, she is unemployed and most likely, completely unemployable, due to the criminal convictions she has accrued over the course of 2012.</p>
<h3 id="policies-on-gaming-machines">Policies on Gaming Machines</h3>
<p>Hajnal Ban is an anti-<a href="Slot_machine" title="wikilink">pokies</a> campaigner and continues to advocate for the reduction in the number of gaming machines within the Logan City local government area.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> Ban voted prominently in several ballots to remove Deputy Mayor of Logan, Russell Lutton, who is a pro-pokies councillor.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a><a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a><a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a><a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> Lutton has since fought back criticising Ban, including references to her leg lengthening story.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a><a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="criminal-charges">Criminal charges</h3>

<p>In November 2011, Black faced criminal charges for allegedly breaching local government financial disclosure laws. In December 2011, a Brisbane judge found that she had failed to act properly on behalf of a dementia patient after the sale of his Park Ridge property south of Brisbane. The funds from the sale had been transferred into her own bank account instead of being held in a separate trust account.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> Black lodged an appeal against the decision of the Supreme court in January 2012, the case has yet to be set down for mention. She has had two warrants issued for her arrest in March 2012, for ignoring a court date and storming out of another. <a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> On 27 March 2012 she was found guilty on four of the five charges, fined $3500 and ordered to pay costs of $5000 and had a conviction recorded.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> Black has 28 days to appeal that verdict. </p>
