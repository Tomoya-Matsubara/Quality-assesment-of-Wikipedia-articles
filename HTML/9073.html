<p>The <strong>St. Johns River</strong> is the longest river in the U.S. state of <a href="Florida" class="uri" title="wikilink">Florida</a> and its most significant for commercial and recreational use. At  long, it winds through or borders twelve counties, three of which are the state's largest. The drop in elevation from the headwaters to the mouth is less than ; like most Florida waterways, the St. Johns has a very slow flow rate at a third of a mile an hour (0.2 km/h), and is often described as &quot;lazy&quot;.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> It is one of the few rivers in the United States to run north. Numerous lakes are formed by the river or flow into it, but as a river its widest point is  across, spanning several miles between <a href="Palatka,_Florida" title="wikilink">Palatka</a> and <a href="Jacksonville,_Florida" title="wikilink">Jacksonville</a>, the latter being the largest urban area on the river. The narrowest point is in the headwaters, an unnavigable marsh in <a href="Indian_River_County,_Florida" title="wikilink">Indian River County</a>. In all, 3.5 million people live within the various watersheds that feed into the St. Johns River.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>Comprising a drainage basin of , the St. Johns is one of the major interior wetlands of Florida.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a><a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> It is separated into three major basins and two associated watersheds for <a href="Lake_George_(Florida)" title="wikilink">Lake George</a> and the <a href="Ocklawaha_River" title="wikilink">Ocklawaha River</a>, all managed by the <a href="St._Johns_River_Water_Management_District" title="wikilink">St. Johns River Water Management District</a>. Like all waterways in Florida, the St. Johns is fed primarily by rainfall, most of which is immediately deposited into the river and its tributaries as stormwater runoff. Much of the water flowing into the St. Johns also comes from the <a href="Floridan_Aquifer" title="wikilink">Floridan Aquifer</a>, a natural underground reservoir that serves as the fresh water source for populations living north of <a href="St._Petersburg,_Florida" title="wikilink">St. Petersburg</a>. The St. Johns itself is being considered as a potential fresh water source for 2020 as populations continue to grow, taxing the Floridan Aquifer.</p>
<p>A vast variety of people have lived on or near the St. Johns, including <a href="Archaic_period_in_the_Americas" title="wikilink">Archaic people</a>, <a href="Timucua" title="wikilink">Timucuan</a>, French and Spanish settlers, <a href="Seminole" title="wikilink">Seminoles</a>, slaves and freemen, <a href="Florida_cracker" title="wikilink">Florida crackers</a>, land developers, tourists, and retirees. It has been the subject of <a href="William_Bartram" title="wikilink">William Bartram</a>'s journals, <a href="Marjorie_Kinnan_Rawlings" title="wikilink">Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings</a>' books, and <a href="Harriet_Beecher_Stowe" title="wikilink">Harriet Beecher Stowe</a>'s letters home. Although Florida was the location of the first permanent European colony in what would become the United States, it was the last U.S. territory on the east coast to be developed, and it remained a wilderness frontier into the 20th century. When attention was turned to the state, however, much of the land was rapidly overdeveloped in a national zeal for progress. The St. Johns, like many Florida rivers, was altered to make way for agricultural and residential centers and suffered severe pollution and human interference that has diminished the natural order of life in and around the river. It was named one of 14 <a href="American_Heritage_River" title="wikilink">American Heritage Rivers</a> in 1998 but was included on a list of America's Ten Most Endangered Rivers in 2008.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> Restoration efforts are underway for the basins around the St. Johns as Florida continues to deal with population increases in the river's vicinity.</p>
<h2 id="geography-and-ecology">Geography and ecology</h2>
<p>Starting in Indian River County and meeting the Atlantic Ocean at <a href="Duval_County,_Florida" title="wikilink">Duval County</a>, the St. Johns is Florida's primary commercial and recreational waterway. It flows north&lt;U+2014&gt;which is unusual in North America&lt;U+2014&gt;from its headwaters from the direction of the Lake Wales Ridge, which is only slightly elevated at  above sea level. Furthermore, barrier islands and land between the St. Johns and the Atlantic Ocean affect its slow discharge: the river ebbs and flows with tides.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> Uniquely, it shares the same regional terrain as the parallel <a href="Kissimmee_River" title="wikilink">Kissimmee River</a>, although the Kissimmee flows south.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>

<p>The St. Johns River is separated into three basins and two associated watersheds managed by the <a href="St._Johns_River_Water_Management_District" title="wikilink">St. Johns River Water Management District</a>. Because the river flows in a northerly direction, the upper basin is located in the headwaters of the river at its southernmost point.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> Indian River County is where the river begins as a network of marshes, at a point west of <a href="Vero_Beach,_Florida" title="wikilink">Vero Beach</a> aptly named the St. Johns Marsh in central Florida. The St. Johns River is a <a href="blackwater_river" title="wikilink">blackwater stream</a>, meaning it is fed primarily by swamps and marshes lying beneath it; water seeps through the sandy soil and collects in a slight valley.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> The upper basin measures approximately ; the St. Johns transforms into a navigable waterway one county north of Indian River in <a href="Brevard_County,_Florida" title="wikilink">Brevard County</a>. The river touches on the borders of <a href="Osceola_County,_Florida" title="wikilink">Osceola</a> and <a href="Orange_County,_Florida" title="wikilink">Orange Counties</a>, and flows through the southeast tip of <a href="Seminole_County,_Florida" title="wikilink">Seminole County</a>, transitioning into the middle basin a dozen miles (19 km) or so north of <a href="Titusville,_Florida" title="wikilink">Titusville</a>.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> The length of the river through the upper basin measures about .</p>
<p>The river is at its narrowest and most unpredictable in this basin. Channel flows are not apparent and usually unmarked. The most efficient way to travel on this part of the river is by <a href="airboat" class="uri" title="wikilink">airboat</a>. Approximately 3,500 lakes lie within the overall St. Johns watershed and all of them are shallow, with maximum depths between .<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a><a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> The river flows into many of them that further confuse navigation.

<p>Wetlands in the upper and middle basin are fed by rainwater, trapped by the structure of the surrounding land. It is an oxygen and nutrient-poor environment; what grows usually does so in <a href="peat" class="uri" title="wikilink">peat</a> which is created by centuries of decaying plant material.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> Water levels fluctuate with the subtropical wet and dry seasons.

This basin, spreading throughout Orange, <a href="Lake_County,_Florida" title="wikilink">Lake</a>, <a href="Volusia_County,_Florida" title="wikilink">Volusia</a>, and Seminole Counties, is home to the greater <a href="Orlando,_Florida" title="wikilink">Orlando</a> metropolitan area, where 2 million people live and major tourist attractions are located.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> The topography of the middle basin varies between clearly distinguishable banks along the river and broad, shallow lakes. Two of the largest lakes in the middle basin are created by the river: <a href="Lake_Harney" title="wikilink">Lake Harney</a> and Lake Monroe. The shallow  Lake Harney is fed by the long narrow <a href="Puzzle_Lake" title="wikilink">Puzzle Lake</a>; immediately north is the <a href="Econlockhatchee_River" title="wikilink">Econlockhatchee River</a>, which joins to increase the volume of the St. Johns where larger boat traffic navigation becomes easier.

<p>Of the most vital importance to marshes are invertebrate animals, which are the foundation of <a href="food_webs" title="wikilink">food webs</a>.

<p>The towns and cities along the lower basin of the river are some of the oldest in Florida, and their histories have centered on the river. Both Palatka and Green Cove Springs have been popular tourist destinations in the past. Several smaller locations along the river sprang up around ferry landings, but when rail lines and then <a href="Interstate_Highway_System" title="wikilink">Interstate highways</a> were constructed closer to the Atlantic Coast, many of the towns experienced significant economic decline, and ferry landings were forgotten.<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a></p>
<p>The final  of the river's course run through the city of Jacksonville, the largest in area in Florida, with a population of more than a million. Much of the economic base of Jacksonville depends on the river:  of goods are shipped in and out of Jacksonville annually. Exports include paper, phosphate, fertilizers, and citrus, while major imports include oil, coffee, limestone, cars, and lumber.<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a> The Port of Jacksonville produces $1.38 billion in the local economy and supports 10,000 jobs.<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a> The U.S. Navy has three bases in the Jacksonville area: <a href="Naval_Station_Mayport" title="wikilink">Naval Station Mayport</a>, at the mouth of the river, serves as the second largest Atlantic fleet operation in the country. <a href="Naval_Air_Station_Jacksonville" title="wikilink">Naval Air Station Jacksonville</a>, and <a href="Cecil_Field" title="wikilink">Cecil Field</a>, are both primarily Naval airports.<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a></p>

<p>Tides cause seawater to enter the mouth of the St. Johns River and can affect the river's level into the middle basin. As a result, much of the river in Jacksonville is part seawater, making it an <a href="estuarine" class="uri" title="wikilink">estuarine</a> ecosystem.

<p>Lying within a <a href="coastal_plain" title="wikilink">coastal plain</a>, the St. Johns River passes through an area that was at one time barrier islands, coastal dunes, and estuary marshes. The Florida Peninsula was created primarily by forces and minerals from the ocean. It lies so low that minor fluctuations in sea levels can have a dramatic effect on its geomorphology. Florida was once part of the supercontinent <a href="Gondwana" class="uri" title="wikilink">Gondwana</a>.

During the <a href="Cretaceous_period" title="wikilink">Cretaceous period</a> (145 to 65 million years ago), the basement and its sedimentary overlay were further covered by <a href="calcium_carbonate" title="wikilink">calcium carbonate</a> and formations left by the evaporation of water called <a href="evaporites" class="uri" title="wikilink">evaporites</a>.<a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a> What covers the peninsula is the result of simultaneous processes of deposits of sands, shells, and coral, and erosion from water and weather.<a href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a> As ocean water has retreated and progressed, the peninsula has been covered with sea water at least seven times. Waves compressed sands, calcium carbonate, and shells into <a href="limestone" class="uri" title="wikilink">limestone</a>; at the ocean's edge, beach ridges were created by this depositional forming. North-south axis rivers, such as the St. Johns, were created by past beach ridges which were often divided by <a href="Swale_(geographical_feature)" title="wikilink">swales</a>. As ocean water retreated, <a href="lagoon" title="wikilink">lagoons</a> formed in the swales, which were further eroded by acidic water.<a href="#fn67" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a> <a href="Barrier_island" title="wikilink">Barrier islands</a>, furthermore, formed along the Atlantic Coast, surrounding the lagoon with land and forming a freshwater river.<a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a></p>
<p>The majority of rivers in the Northern Hemisphere tend to flow south towards the <a href="equator" class="uri" title="wikilink">equator</a>, probably caused by the force of the Earth's rotation.

<p>All of Florida's abundant fresh water is the result of precipitation that returns to the atmosphere in a process called <a href="evapotranspiration" class="uri" title="wikilink">evapotranspiration</a> that involves evaporation and transpiration of moisture from plants. As rains fall, most of the water is directed to lakes, streams, and rivers.<a href="#fn73" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref73"><sup>73</sup></a> However, a significant amount of fresh water is held underground but close to the surface in <a href="aquifers" class="uri" title="wikilink">aquifers</a>. A <a href="surficial_aquifer" title="wikilink">surficial aquifer</a> comprised mostly of clay, shells, and sand is over a confining layer of denser materials. Wells are drilled in the surficial aquifer, which supplies better quality water in areas where the deepest aquifer has a high mineral content.<a href="#fn74" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref74"><sup>74</sup></a> Occasionally the confining layer is fractured to allow breaches of water to percolate down to recharge the layer below. The <a href="Floridan_Aquifer" title="wikilink">Floridan Aquifer</a>, underneath the confining layer, underlies the entire state and portions of Georgia, Alabama, and South Carolina. It is particularly accessible in the northern part of Florida, serving as the fresh water source of metropolitan areas from <a href="St._Petersburg,_Florida" title="wikilink">St. Petersburg</a> north to Jacksonville and <a href="Tallahassee,_Florida" title="wikilink">Tallahassee</a>.<a href="#fn75" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref75"><sup>75</sup></a></p>
<p>Acidic rainwater erodes the limestone and can form underground caverns. When the overlay of these caverns is particularly thin&lt;U+2014&gt;less than &lt;U+2014&gt;<a href="sinkhole" title="wikilink">sinkholes</a> can form. Where the limestone or sand/clay overlay dissolves over the aquifer and the pressure of the water pushes out, springs form. The upper and middle basins of the St. Johns River are located in a portion of the peninsula where the aquifer system is thinly confined, meaning springs and sinkholes are abundant. Springs are measured in magnitude of how much water is discharged, which is dependent upon season and rainfall. The greatest discharge is from first magnitude springs that emit at least  of water per second.

Tides regularly affect water levels as far south as Lake George; when combined with extreme winds, the river's tidal effects can extend to Lake Monroe  away and have on occasion reached Lake Harney.<a href="#fn89" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref89"><sup>89</sup></a> Tides typically raise the river level about  at Jacksonville, decreasing some to  at <a href="Orange_Park,_Florida" title="wikilink">Orange Park</a> where the river widens, and increasing back to  at Palatka as it narrows. As a result of tidal effects, discharge measurements in the lower basin are often inaccurate.

<p>As distance between the mouth of the St. Johns and the middle and upper basins increases, the <a href="salinity" class="uri" title="wikilink">salinity</a> in the river gradually decreases. Marine water measures at 35 parts per thousand (ppt) or more while fresh water measures below 2 ppt. What ranges in between is characterized as brackish water. Near the center of Jacksonville, average measures have been collected at 11.40 ppt. Farther south at the Buckman Bridge, joining the south side of Jacksonville to Orange Park, it decreases to 2.9 ppt and falls again to 0.81 ppt at the <a href="Shands_Bridge" title="wikilink">Shands Bridge</a> near <a href="Green_Cove_Springs,_Florida" title="wikilink">Green Cove Springs</a>.<a href="#fn93" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref93"><sup>93</sup></a><a href="#fn94" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref94"><sup>94</sup></a></p>

The U.S. <a href="Environmental_Protection_Agency" title="wikilink">Environmental Protection Agency</a> and the State of Florida recommend no less than 5 mg of oxygen per liter. Several locations on the St. Johns or its tributaries reported at or below these minimums in the 1990s, including the mouth of the Wekiva River, the St. Johns at the town of <a href="Christmas,_Florida" title="wikilink">Christmas</a>, and in the early 2000s at Blue Spring and Blackwater Creek.<a href="#fn95" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref95"><sup>95</sup></a> Sustained low levels of dissolved oxygen may create algal blooms, which may also cause a further decrease in dissolved oxygen.<a href="#fn96" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref96"><sup>96</sup></a></p>

Much of the land was far from water&lt;U+2014&gt;most fresh water was contained in glaciers and polar ice caps. As a result, Florida was an arid landscape with few trees, dominated by grasslands and scrub vegetation.<a href="#fn99" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref99"><sup>99</sup></a> Around 9,000 years ago, the climate warmed, melting many of the polar ice caps and glaciers, creating a wetter environment and submerging half the peninsular shelf. As Paleo-Indians did not have to travel as far to find water, their camps became more permanent, turning into villages.

<p>The French and Spanish continued to spar over who would control the natural resources and native peoples of the colony, foreshadowing a history during which eight different countries would control the river.

<p>The first years following Florida's annexation to the United States in 1821 were marked with violent conflicts between white settlers and Seminoles, whose bands often included runaway African slaves. The clashes between American and Seminole forces during the establishment of the Florida territory are reflected in the towns and landmarks along the St. Johns named for those who were directly involved. Even before Florida was under U.S. jurisdiction, Major General <a href="Andrew_Jackson" title="wikilink">Andrew Jackson</a> was responsible for removing the Alachua Seminoles west of the <a href="Suwannee_River" title="wikilink">Suwannee River</a>, either killing them or forcing them farther south towards Lake County, in 1818. Jackson's efforts became the <a href="First_Seminole_War" title="wikilink">First Seminole War</a>, and were rewarded by the naming of a cattle crossing across a wide portion of the St. Johns near the Georgia border&lt;U+2014&gt;previously named Cowford&lt;U+2014&gt;to Jacksonville. The result of Jackson's offensive was the transfer of Florida to the U.S.<a href="#fn131" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref131"><sup>131</sup></a><a href="#fn132" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref132"><sup>132</sup></a> Following the Seminole Wars, a gradual increase in commerce and population occurred on the St. Johns, made possible by steamship travel. <a href="Steamboat" title="wikilink">Steamboats</a> heralded a heyday for the river, and preceding railroads they were the only way to reach interior portions of the state. They also afforded the citizens of Jacksonville a pastime to watch competing races.<a href="#fn133" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref133"><sup>133</sup></a> By the 1860s, weekly trips between Jacksonville, <a href="Charleston,_South_Carolina" title="wikilink">Charleston</a>, and <a href="Savannah,_Georgia" title="wikilink">Savannah</a> were made to transport tourists, lumber, cotton, and citrus.

<p><a href="Florida_in_the_American_Civil_War" title="wikilink">Florida's involvement</a> in the <a href="U.S._Civil_War" title="wikilink">U.S. Civil War</a> was limited compared to other <a href="Confederate_States_of_America" title="wikilink">Confederate states</a> because it had a fraction of the populations of states that had been developed. Florida provided materials to the Confederacy by way of steamboats on the St. Johns, although the river and the Atlantic coasts were blockaded by the U.S. Navy. One action in Florida's role in the Civil War was the sinking of the <em><a href="USS_Columbine_(1862)" title="wikilink">USS Columbine</a></em>, a Union <a href="paddle_steamer" title="wikilink">paddle steamer</a> used for patrolling the St. Johns to keep materials from reaching the Confederate Army. In 1864, near Palatka, Confederate forces captured and then burned the <em>USS Columbine</em> and sank her, making it perhaps the only ship commandeered by the Confederacy.<a href="#fn135" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref135"><sup>135</sup></a><a href="#fn136" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref136"><sup>136</sup></a> The same year and farther downriver, Confederates again sunk a Union boat named the <em><a href="Maple_Leaf_(shipwreck)" title="wikilink">Maple Leaf</a></em>, that struck a floating keg filled with explosives and settled into the muck near <a href="Julington_Creek" title="wikilink">Julington Creek</a>, south of Jacksonville.

Florida Governor <a href="William_Bloxham" title="wikilink">William Bloxham</a> in 1881 appealed directly to a Pennsylvania-based industrialist named <a href="Hamilton_Disston" title="wikilink">Hamilton Disston</a>, initially to build canals to improve steamboat passage through the <a href="Caloosahatchee_River" title="wikilink">Caloosahatchee River</a>, and drain lands in the central part of the state to turn into agriculturally productive tracts. Disston was furthermore persuaded to purchase  of land in central Florida for $1 million, which at the time was reported to be the largest purchase of land in human history. Disston was ultimately unsuccessful in his drainage attempts, but his investment sparked the tourist industry and made it possible for railroad magnates <a href="Henry_Morrison_Flagler" title="wikilink">Henry Morrison Flagler</a> and <a href="Henry_Bradley_Plant" title="wikilink">Henry Bradley Plant</a> to construct rail lines down the east coast of Florida, and another connecting Sanford to Tampa.

<p>An Englishman named <a href="Nelson_Fell" title="wikilink">Nelson Fell</a>, persuaded by Disston's advertisements to make his fortunes in Florida, arrived in the 1880s.

Yet the call to <a href="Restoration_of_the_Everglades" title="wikilink">save the Everglades</a> has been celebrated much more than restoration to the St. Johns River.<a href="#fn159" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref159"><sup>159</sup></a> Within the past 50 years, however, urban areas in the northern and central parts of the state have grown considerably. In the upper basin, population increased by 700 percent between 1950 and 2000, and is expected to rise another 1.5 million by 2020.<a href="#fn160" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref160"><sup>160</sup></a></p>
<p><a href="Nitrates" class="uri" title="wikilink">Nitrates</a> and <a href="phosphorus" class="uri" title="wikilink">phosphorus</a> used as lawn and crop fertilizers wash into the St. Johns. Broken septic systems and seepage from cattle grazing lands create pollution that also finds its way into the river. Storm water washes from street drains directly to the river and its tributaries: in the 1970s, the Econlockhatchee River received  of treated wastewater every day.<a href="#fn161" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref161"><sup>161</sup></a> Wetlands were drained and paved, unable to filter pollutants from the water, made worse by the river's own slow discharge. Algal blooms, fish kills, and deformations and lesions on fish occur regularly in the river from Palatka to Jacksonville. Although most of the pollutanats in the river are washed from the southern parts of the river, the Jacksonville area produces approximately 36 percent of them found in the lower basin.<a href="#fn162" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref162"><sup>162</sup></a></p>
<p>The State of Florida implemented a program named Surface Water Improvement and Management (SWIM) in 1987 to assist with river cleanups, particularly with <a href="nonpoint_source_pollution" title="wikilink">nonpoint source pollution</a>, or chemicals that enter the river by soaking into the ground, as opposed to direct piped dumping.<a href="#fn163" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref163"><sup>163</sup></a> SWIM assists local jurisdictions with purchasing land for wetlands restoration. The St. Johns River Water Management District (SJRWMD) is charged by the <a href="Florida_Department_of_Environmental_Protection" title="wikilink">Florida Department of Environmental Protection</a> (DEP) with restoring the river. The first step in restoration, particularly in the upper basin, is the purchase of public lands bordering the river; ten different reserves and conservation areas have been implemented for such use around the St. Johns headwaters.<a href="#fn164" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref164"><sup>164</sup></a> Around <a href="Lake_Griffin" title="wikilink">Lake Griffin</a> in the Ocklawaha Chain of Lakes, the SJRWMD has purchased  of land that was previously used for muck farming.<a href="#fn165" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref165"><sup>165</sup></a> More than  have been purchased along Lake Apopka to restore its wetlands, and the SJRWMD has removed nearly  of gizzard shad (<em><a href="Dorosoma_cepedianum" title="wikilink">Dorosoma cepedianum</a></em>), a fish species that stores phosphorus and adds to algae problems.<a href="#fn166" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref166"><sup>166</sup></a> The SJRWMD has also set minimum levels for the lakes and tributaries in the St. Johns watersheds to monitor permitted water withdrawals and declare water shortages when necessary.<a href="#fn167" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref167"><sup>167</sup></a></p>
<p>To assist with river cleanup and the associated funds for improving water quality in the St. Johns, Mayor <a href="John_Delaney" title="wikilink">John Delaney</a> of Jacksonville waged a campaign to get it named as an <a href="American_Heritage_River" title="wikilink">American Heritage River</a>, beginning in 1997. The designation by the Environmental Protection Agency is intended to coordinate efforts among federal agencies to improve natural resource and environmental protection, economic revitalization, and historic and cultural preservation.<a href="#fn168" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref168"><sup>168</sup></a> The campaign was controversial as the Republican mayor defended asking for federal government assistance, writing &quot;Other rivers have relied heavily on federal help for massive environmental clean-ups. It's the St. Johns' turn now.&quot;<a href="#fn169" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref169"><sup>169</sup></a> Twenty-two towns along the St. Johns and environmental, sporting, recreation, boating, and educational organizations also supported its designation,<a href="#fn170" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref170"><sup>170</sup></a> but several prominent Republican politicians expressed concerns over increased federal regulations and restrictions on private property ownership along the river; the <a href="Florida_House_of_Representatives" title="wikilink">Florida House of Representatives</a> passed a resolution asking President <a href="Bill_Clinton" title="wikilink">Bill Clinton</a> not to include the St. Johns. Despite this, Clinton designated the St. Johns as one of only 14 American Heritage Rivers out of 126 nominated in 1998 for its ecological, historic, economic and cultural significance.<a href="#fn171" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref171"><sup>171</sup></a><a href="#fn172" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref172"><sup>172</sup></a></p>
<p>The continuing increase of population in Florida has caused urban planners to forecast that the Floridan Aquifer will no longer be able to sustain the people living in north Florida. By 2020, 7 million people are predicted to live in the St. Johns basins, double the number living there in 2008.<a href="#fn173" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref173"><sup>173</sup></a> Proposals to use  a day from the St. Johns, and another  from the Ocklawaha River for fresh water are controversial, prompting a private organization named St. Johns Riverkeeper to nominate it to the list of the Ten Most Endangered Rivers by an environmental watchdog group named <a href="American_Rivers" title="wikilink">American Rivers</a>. In 2008, it was listed as #6,<a href="#fn174" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref174"><sup>174</sup></a> which was met with approval from Jacksonville's newspaper, <em><a href="The_Florida_Times-Union" title="wikilink">The Florida Times-Union</a></em>, and skepticism from the SJRWMD.<a href="#fn175" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref175"><sup>175</sup></a><a href="#fn176" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref176"><sup>176</sup></a></p>

<li id="fn132">Lake Monroe on the St. Johns was named for President <a href="James_Monroe" title="wikilink">James Monroe</a>, who persuaded the U.S. government to finance the First Seminole War. As American settlers trickled in to farms and homesteads in north and central Florida, they came into increased conflict with several Seminole bands for food and sometimes to take the Seminoles as slaves. The <a href="Treaty_of_Moultrie_Creek" title="wikilink">Treaty of Moultrie Creek</a> in 1823 placed Seminoles on a reservation near Lake Okeechobee, but further U.S. policy strongly encouraged them to leave Florida for <a href="Indian_Territory" title="wikilink">Indian Territory</a> in what would become Oklahoma. (Tebeau, p. 156.) By 1835, the Seminoles rebelled, inspired and led by <a href="Osceola" class="uri" title="wikilink">Osceola</a>, whose name is one of the most widely used for landmarks and structures in the state. (McCarthy, p. 17.) Lake Jesup's namesake is the American military leader in Florida, Major General <a href="Thomas_Jesup" title="wikilink">Thomas Jesup</a>, who captured Osceola in 1837. Lake Harney was named for Brigadier General <a href="William_S._Harney" title="wikilink">William S. Harney</a>, who led several raids against Seminoles in west and south Florida.
