<p><strong>Syracuse University</strong>, commonly referred to as <strong>Syracuse</strong>, <strong>'Cuse</strong>, or <strong>SU</strong>,<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> is a private research university located in <a href="Syracuse,_New_York" title="wikilink">Syracuse</a>, <a href="New_York" title="wikilink">New York</a>, United States. Its roots can be traced back to Genesee Wesleyan Seminary, founded by the <a href="Methodist_Episcopal_Church" title="wikilink">Methodist Episcopal Church</a> in 1832, which also later founded <a href="Genesee_College" title="wikilink">Genesee College</a>. Following several years of debate over relocating the college to Syracuse, the university was founded independent of the college in 1870. Since 1920, the university has identified itself as <a href="nonsectarian" class="uri" title="wikilink">nonsectarian</a>,<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a><a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a><a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a><a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a><a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a><a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> although it maintains a relationship with <a href="The_United_Methodist_Church" title="wikilink">The United Methodist Church</a>.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a><a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a><a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a><a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a><a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<p>The campus is located in the <a href="University_Hill,_Syracuse" title="wikilink">University Hill</a> neighborhood of Syracuse, east and southeast of <a href="Downtown_Syracuse" title="wikilink">downtown</a>, on one of the larger hills. Its large campus features an eclectic mix of buildings, ranging from nineteenth-century <a href="Romanesque_architecture" title="wikilink">Romanesque</a> structures to contemporary buildings. SU is organized into 13 schools and colleges, with nationally recognized programs in <a href="Syracuse_University_School_of_Information_Studies" title="wikilink">information studies and library science</a>, <a href="Syracuse_University_School_of_Architecture" title="wikilink">architecture</a>, <a href="S._I._Newhouse_School_of_Public_Communications" title="wikilink">communications</a>, <a href="business_administration" title="wikilink">business administration</a>, <a href="public_administration" title="wikilink">public administration</a>, <a href="engineering" class="uri" title="wikilink">engineering</a> and the <a href="Syracuse_University_College_of_Arts_and_Sciences" title="wikilink">College of Arts and Sciences</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="Genesee_Wesleyan_Seminary" title="wikilink">Genesee Wesleyan Seminary</a> was founded in 1832 by the Genesee <a href="Annual_Conference" title="wikilink">Annual Conference</a> of the <a href="Methodist_Episcopal_Church" title="wikilink">Methodist Episcopal Church</a> in Lima, New York, south of <a href="Rochester,_New_York" title="wikilink">Rochester</a>. In 1850, it was resolved to enlarge the institution from a seminary into a college, or to connect a college with the seminary, becoming <a href="Genesee_College" title="wikilink">Genesee College</a>. However, the location was soon thought by many to be insufficiently central. Its difficulties were compounded by the next set of technological changes: the railroad that displaced the Erie Canal as the region's economic engine bypassed Lima completely. The trustees of the struggling college then decided to seek a locale whose economic and transportation advantages could provide a better base of support. The college began looking for a new home at the same time that Syracuse, ninety miles to the east, was engaged in a search to bring a university to the city, having failed to convince <a href="Ezra_Cornell" title="wikilink">Ezra Cornell</a> and <a href="Andrew_Dickson_White" title="wikilink">Andrew Dickson White</a> to locate <a href="Cornell_University" title="wikilink">Cornell University</a> there rather than in <a href="Ithaca,_New_York" title="wikilink">Ithaca</a>.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a><a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> White pressed that the university should locate on the hill in <a href="Syracuse,_New_York" title="wikilink">Syracuse</a> (the current location of Syracuse University) due to the city's attractive transportation hub, which would ease the recruitment of faculty, students, and other persons of note. However, as a young carpenter working in Syracuse, Cornell had been twice robbed of his wages,<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a><a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> and thereafter considered Syracuse a <a href="Sodom_and_Gomorrah" title="wikilink">Sodom and Gomorrah</a> insisting that the university be located in <a href="Ithaca,_New_York" title="wikilink">Ithaca</a> on his large farm on East Hill, overlooking the town and <a href="Cayuga_Lake" title="wikilink">Cayuga Lake</a>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, there were several years of dispute between the Methodist ministers, Lima, and contending cities across the state, over proposals to move Genesee College to Syracuse. At the time, the ministers wanted a share of the funds from the <a href="Morrill_Land_Grant_Act" title="wikilink">Morrill Land Grant Act</a> for Genesee College. Eventually, they agreed to a quid-pro quo donation of $25,000 from Ezra Cornell in exchange for their support for his bill. Cornell insisted the bargain be written into the bill and Cornell became New York State's Land Grant University in 1865. In 1869, Genesee College obtained New York State approval to move to Syracuse, but Lima got a court injunction to block the move, and Genesee stayed in Lima until it was dissolved in 1875.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> At its founding on March 24, 1870, the state of New York granted the University its charter independent of Genesee College.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> The City of Syracuse offered $100,000 to establish the school.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> <a href="Jesse_T._Peck" title="wikilink">Bishop Jesse Truesdell Peck</a> donated $25,000 to the proposed school<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> and was elected the first president of the Board of Trustees.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> Rev. Daniel Steele, a former Genesee College president, served as the first administrative leader of Syracuse until its Chancellor was appointed.<ref name="The Hill: an illustrated biography of Syracuse University, 1870<U+2013>present&quot;/&gt; The university opened in September 1871 in rented space downtown.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> George F. Comstock, a member of the new University's Board of Trustees, had offered the school  of farmland on a hillside to the southeast of the city center. Comstock intended Syracuse University and the hill to develop as an integrated whole; a contemporary account described the latter as &quot;a beautiful town ... springing up on the hillside and a community of refined and cultivated membership ... established near the spot which will soon be the center of a great and beneficent educational institution.&quot;<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a></p>
<p>The university was founded as coeducational, and President Peck stated at the opening ceremonies, &quot;The conditions of admission shall be equal to all persons... there shall be no invidious discrimination here against woman.... brains and heart shall have a fair chance... &quot;<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> Syracuse implemented this policy with a high proportion of women students. The ratio between male and female students during the 19th century in the College of Liberal Arts was approximately even. The College of Fine Arts was predominantly female, and a low ratio of women enrolled as students in the College of Medicine and the College of Law.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> Men and women were taught together in the same courses, and many extra-curricular activities were coeducational as well. Syracuse also developed &quot;women-only&quot; organizations, such as the Ladies' Glee Club, the Y.W.C.A. and various sororities.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="expansion">Expansion</h3>
<p>Coeducation at Syracuse traced its roots to the early days of the Genesee College where suffragists like <a href="Frances_Willard_(suffragist)" title="wikilink">Frances Willard</a> and <a href="Belva_Lockwood" title="wikilink">Belva Lockwood</a> began to distinguish themselves nationally. However, the progressive &quot;co-ed&quot; policies initiated at Genesee would soon find controversy at the new university in Syracuse.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> Colleges and universities admitted few women students in the 1870s. Administrators and faculty argued women had inferior minds and could not master mathematics and the classics. Dr. <a href="Erastus_Otis_Haven" title="wikilink">Erastus Otis Haven</a>, Syracuse University chancellor and former president of the <a href="University_of_Michigan" title="wikilink">University of Michigan</a> and <a href="Northwestern_University" title="wikilink">Northwestern University</a>, maintained that women should receive the advantages of higher education. He enrolled his daughter, Frances, at SU, where she was initiated in the newly formed Gamma Phi Beta sorority.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a></p>

<p>In the late 1880s the University resumed construction on the south side of University Place. Holden Observatory (1887) was followed by two Romanesque Revival buildings &lt;U+2013&gt; von Ranke Library (1889), now Tolley Administration Building, and Crouse College (1889). Together with the Hall of Languages, these first buildings formed the basis for the &quot;Old Row,&quot; a grouping which, along with its companion Lawn, established one of Syracuse's most enduring images.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> The emphatically linear organization of these buildings along the brow of the hill follows a tradition of American campus planning which dates to the construction of the &quot;Yale Row&quot; in the 1790s. At Syracuse, the Old Row continued to provide the framework for growth well into the twentieth century.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a></p>
<p>From its founding until through early 1920s, the University grew rapidly. It offered programs in the physical sciences and modern languages, and in 1873, Syracuse added one of the first architecture programs in the U.S.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> In 1874, Syracuse created the nation's first bachelor of fine arts degree,<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> and in 1876, the school offered its first post-graduate courses in the College of Arts and Sciences.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> SU created its first doctoral program in 1911.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> SU's school of journalism, now the <a href="S.I._Newhouse_School_of_Public_Communications" title="wikilink">S.I. Newhouse School of Public Communications</a>, was established at Syracuse in 1934.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a></p>
<p>The growth of Syracuse University from a small liberal arts college into a major comprehensive university were due to the efforts of two men, Chancellor <a href="James_Roscoe_Day" title="wikilink">James Day</a> and <a href="John_Dustin_Archbold" title="wikilink">John Archbold</a>. James Roscoe Day was serving the Calvary Church in New York City where he befriended Archbold. Together, the two dynamic figures would oversee the first of two great periods of campus renewal in Syracuse's history.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a></p>
<p>John Dustin Archbold was a capitalist, philanthropist, and President of the Board of Trustees at Syracuse University. He was known as John D. Rockefeller&lt;U+2019&gt;s right hand man and successor at the <a href="Standard_Oil" title="wikilink">Standard Oil</a> Company. He was a close friend of Syracuse University Chancellor James R. Day, and gave almost $6 million to the University over his lifetime.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> Said a journalist in 1917:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Mr. Archbold&lt;U+2019&gt;s ... is the president of the board of trustees of Syracuse University, an institution which has prospered so remarkably since his connection with it that its student roll has increased from hundreds to over 4,000, including 1,500 young women, placing it in the ranks of the foremost institutions of learning in the United States.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In addition to keeping the university financially solvent during its early years, he also contributed funds for eight buildings, including the full cost of Archbold Stadium (opened 1907, demolished 1978), Sims Hall (men's dormitory, 1907), the Archbold Gymnasium (1909, nearly destroyed by fire in 1947, but still in use), and the oval athletic field.</p>
<h3 id="modern">Modern</h3>
<p>After <a href="World_War_II" title="wikilink">World War II</a>, Syracuse University began to transform into a major research institution. Enrollment increased in the four years after the war due to the <a href="G.I._Bill" title="wikilink">G.I. Bill</a>, which paid tuition, room, board, and a small allowance for veterans returning from World War II. In 1946, SU admitted 9,464 freshmen, nearly four times greater than the previous incoming class.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> Branch campuses were established in <a href="Endicott,_New_York" title="wikilink">Endicott, New York</a> and <a href="Utica,_New_York" title="wikilink">Utica, New York</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The velocity with which the university sped through its change into a major research institution was astounding. By the end of the 1950s, Syracuse ranked twelfth nationally in terms of the amount of its sponsored research, and it had over four hundred professors and graduate students engaging in that investigation.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>From the early 1950s through the 1960s, Syracuse University added programs and staff that continued the transformation of the school into a research university. In 1954, Arthur Phillips was recruited from <a href="Massachusetts_Institute_of_Technology" title="wikilink">MIT</a> and started the first <a href="pathogen" class="uri" title="wikilink">pathogen</a>-free animal research laboratory. The lab focused on studying medical problems using animal models. The School of Social Work, which eventually merged into the College of Human Ecology, was founded in 1956.<ref name="Syracuse University History, 1951<U+2013>1960&quot;/&gt; Syracuse's College of Engineering also founded the nation's second oldest computer engineering and bioengineering programs. In 1962, <a href="Samuel_Irving_Newhouse,_Sr." title="wikilink">Samuel Irving Newhouse, Sr.</a> donated $15 million to begin construction of a school of communications, eventually known as the <a href="SI_Newhouse_School_of_Public_Communications" title="wikilink">SI Newhouse School of Public Communications</a>. In 1966, Syracuse University was admitted to the <a href="Association_of_American_Universities" title="wikilink">Association of American Universities</a>, an <a href="organization" class="uri" title="wikilink">organization</a> of leading research <a href="university" title="wikilink">universities</a> devoted to maintaining a strong system of academic <a href="research" class="uri" title="wikilink">research</a> and education.<ref name="Syracuse University History, 1961<U+2013>1970&quot;/&gt;</p>

<p>In April 1990, Syracuse University dedicated a memorial wall to the students killed on Flight 103, constructed at the entrance to the main campus in front of the Hall of Languages. Every year the university holds &quot;Remembrance Week&quot; during the fall semester to commemorate the students. On December 21 a service in the university's chapel at 2:03 p.m. (19:03 <a href="UTC" class="uri" title="wikilink">UTC</a>) marks the exact minute on that date in 1988 when the plane exploded. The University also maintains a link to the tragedy with the &quot;Remembrance Scholars&quot; program, when 35 senior students receive scholarships during their final year at the University. With the &quot;Lockerbie Scholars&quot; program, two graduating students from Lockerbie Academy study at Syracuse for one year.<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a></p>

<p>After World War II, a large, undeveloped hill owned by the university was used to house returning <a href="veterans" class="uri" title="wikilink">veterans</a> in military-style campus housing. During the 1970s, this housing was replaced by permanent two-level townhouses for two or three students each, or for graduate family housing. There are also three small residence halls which feature open doubles and a kitchen on every floor. South Campus is also home to the Institute for Sensory Research, Tennity Ice Pavilion, Goldstein Student Center, Skytop Office Building and 621 Skytop Road (for administration), and the InnComplete Pub, a graduate student bar. Just north is the headquarters of SU Athletics located in the Manley Athletics Complex. Approximately 2,500 students live on the South Campus, which is connected to the main campus by frequent bus service.</p>
<h3 id="downtown">Downtown</h3>
<p>In December 2004, the university announced that it had purchased or leased twelve buildings in <a href="downtown_Syracuse" title="wikilink">downtown Syracuse</a>. Five Design Programs; Communication, Advertising, Interiors, Industrial, and Fashion; reside permanently in the newly renovated facilities, fittingly called <a href="The_Warehouse_(Syracuse)" title="wikilink">The Warehouse</a>, which was renovated by <a href="Gluckman_Mayner_Architects" title="wikilink">Gluckman Mayner Architects</a>. Both programs were chosen to be located in the downtown area because of their history of working on projects directly with the community.

<p>Founded in 1957, the Student Association (SA) represents the undergraduate students of both SU and ESF. The SA, through the Student Assembly, oversees the allocation and designation of the Student Activity Fee that was first collected in the 1968&lt;U+2013&gt;69 school year. The goals of the SA are to participate through a unified student voice in the formulation of Syracuse University rules and regulations. The SA-SGA Alumni Organization maintains the history and an organizational timeline on its website.<a href="#fn95" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref95"><sup>95</sup></a> Students elect two non-voting representatives to the Board of Trustees.<a href="#fn96" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref96"><sup>96</sup></a></p>

<p>Syracuse played its first intercollegiate lacrosse game in 1916, and captured its first USILA championship in 1920. It won USILA championships in 1922, 1924, and 1925. In the modern NCAA era, Syracuse is the first school to capture 11 National Championships, the most of any team in college lacrosse history.

<p>Toward the end of the 1970s, Syracuse University was under pressure to improve its football facilities in order to remain a NCAA Division I football school. Its small concrete stadium, <a href="Archbold_Stadium" title="wikilink">Archbold Stadium</a>, was seventy years old and not up to the standards of other schools. The stadium could not be expanded; it had been reduced from 40,000 seats to 26,000 due to the fire codes. Syracuse University decided to build a new stadium. In 1978, Archbold Stadium was demolished to make way for the Carrier Dome, which was to have a domed <a href="Teflon" class="uri" title="wikilink">Teflon</a>-coated, <a href="fiberglass" class="uri" title="wikilink">fiberglass</a> <a href="air-supported_structure" title="wikilink">inflatable roof</a>.

<p>The College of Environmental Science and Forestry (ESF) has a long affiliation with Syracuse University, shares many campus resources, and operates its main academic campus immediately adjacent to Syracuse University. ESF was founded in 1911 as the <a href="History_of_the_New_York_State_College_of_Forestry" title="wikilink">New York State College of Forestry</a> at Syracuse University, under the leadership of Syracuse University Trustee <a href="Louis_Marshall" title="wikilink">Louis Marshall</a>, with the active support of Syracuse University Chancellor Day.

<p>ESF is an autonomous institution, administratively separate from SU, while resources, facilities, and some infrastructure are shared. The two schools share a common Schedule of Classes; students at both institutions may take courses at the other, and degrees from ESF bear the Syracuse University seal along with the State University of New York. A number of concurrent degree programs and certificates are offered between the schools, as well. The college receives an annual appropriation as part of the SUNY budget and the state builds and maintains all of the college's educational facilities. The state has similar relationships with five <a href="statutory_college" title="wikilink">statutory colleges</a> that are at <a href="Alfred_University" title="wikilink">Alfred University</a> and <a href="Cornell_University" title="wikilink">Cornell University</a>.</p>
<p>ESF faculty, students, and students' families join those from SU to take part in a joint convocation ceremony at the beginning of the academic year in August, and joint commencement exercises in May. ESF and SU students share access to libraries, recreational facilities, student clubs, and other activities at both institutions, except for the schools' intercollegiate sports teams, affiliated with the NCAA and NAIA, respectively.
