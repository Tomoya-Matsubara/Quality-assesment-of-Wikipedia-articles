<p>&quot;<strong>It's Alright, Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)</strong>&quot; is a song written and performed by <a href="Bob_Dylan" title="wikilink">Bob Dylan</a> and first released on his 1965 album, <em><a href="Bringing_It_All_Back_Home" title="wikilink">Bringing It All Back Home</a></em>. It was written in the summer of 1964, first performed live on October 10, 1964, and recorded on January 15, 1965. Described by Dylan biographer <a href="Howard_Sounes" title="wikilink">Howard Sounes</a> as a &quot;grim masterpiece,&quot; the song features some of Dylan's most memorable lyrical images. Among the well-known lines sung in the song are &quot;Money doesn't talk, it swears,&quot; &quot;Although the masters make the rules, for the wisemen and the fools&quot; and &quot;But even the president of the United States sometimes must have to stand naked.&quot; The lyrics express Dylan's anger at hypocrisy, commercialism, consumerism, warmongers and contemporary American culture, but unlike his earlier protest songs, &quot;It's Alright, Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)&quot; does not express optimism in the possibility of political solutions.</p>
<p>Dylan has stated that &quot;It's Alright, Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)&quot; is one of his songs that means the most to him, and he has played the song often in live concerts. Since its original release on <em>Bringing It All Back Home</em>, live versions of the song have been issued on <em><a href="The_Bootleg_Series_Vol._6:_Bob_Dylan_Live_1964,_Concert_at_Philharmonic_Hall" title="wikilink">The Bootleg Series Vol. 6: Bob Dylan Live 1964, Concert at Philharmonic Hall</a></em>, <em><a href="Before_the_Flood" title="wikilink">Before the Flood</a></em> and <em><a href="Bob_Dylan_at_Budokan" title="wikilink">Bob Dylan at Budokan</a></em>. Dylan can also be seen performing the song in the film <em><a href="Don&#39;t_Look_Back" title="wikilink">Don't Look Back</a></em> and the video of the HBO special <em>Hard to Handle</em>. The song has been covered by a number of other artists, including <a href="Roger_McGuinn" title="wikilink">Roger McGuinn</a>, <a href="The_Byrds" title="wikilink">The Byrds</a>, <a href="Billy_Preston" title="wikilink">Billy Preston</a>, <a href="Hugo_Race" title="wikilink">Hugo Race</a>, <a href="Terence_Trent_D&#39;Arby" title="wikilink">Terence Trent D'Arby</a>, <a href="Mick_Farren" title="wikilink">Mick Farren</a>, <a href="Caetano_Veloso" title="wikilink">Caetano Veloso</a>, <a href="Marilyn_Scott" title="wikilink">Marilyn Scott</a>, and <a href="The_Duhks" title="wikilink">The Duhks</a>.</p>

<p>Dylan biographer Howard Sounes described &quot;It's Alright, Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)&quot; as a &quot;grim masterpiece.&quot;<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> The only accompaniment is Dylan's guitar, playing <a href="folk-blues" class="uri" title="wikilink">folk-blues</a> riffs and up and down <a href="Guitar_chord" title="wikilink">chord</a> progressions.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> Authour Sean Wilentz has noted that the song's <a href="chord_(music)" title="wikilink">chord</a> structure is similar to that used by the <a href="Everly_Brothers" title="wikilink">Everly Brothers</a>' in their <a href="Hit_single" title="wikilink">hit</a> recording of &quot;<a href="Wake_Up_Little_Susie" title="wikilink">Wake Up Little Susie</a>&quot;.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> The lyrics of &quot;It's Alright, Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)&quot; express Dylan's anger at hypocrisy, commercialism, consumerism, warmongers and contemporary American culture.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a><a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a><a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> In his book <em><a href="Bob_Dylan,_Performing_Artist" title="wikilink">Bob Dylan, Performing Artist</a></em>, author <a href="Paul_Williams_(Crawdaddy!_creator)" title="wikilink">Paul Williams</a> has suggested that the song addresses &quot;the possibility that the most important (and least articulated) political issue of our times is that we are all being fed a false picture of reality, and it's coming at us from every direction.&quot;<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> Williams goes on to say that the song successfully paints a portrait of an &quot;alienated individual identifying the characteristics of the world around him and thus declaring his freedom from its 'rules'.&quot;<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> As such, a major target in the song is the old, established concepts which give a false picture of reality and hinder new worldviews from being accepted.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
<p>While it shares a sense of prevailing entropy with the previous song on the album, &quot;Gates of Eden&quot;, the critique in &quot;It's Alright, Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)&quot; is more direct and less allusive.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> Author Michael Gray has commented that although the vitriol Dylan unleashes towards his targets is similar to his earlier political protest songs, &quot;It's Alright, Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)&quot; is a transitionary song in that it does not express optimism in the possibility of political solutions.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> Instead, Dylan sings in a new prophetic voice that would later become his trademark.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> However, with the political pessimism comes a more poetic vision than in his earlier protest songs, along with a more complex figurative language.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> Howard Sounes notes that the song features some of Dylan's most memorable images.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> The opening lines begin the song's torrent of <a href="apocalypse" title="wikilink">apocalyptic</a> images:<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a></p>
<dl>

<dd>''Darkness at the break of noon
</dd>
<dd>''Shadows even the silver spoon
</dd>
<dd>''The handmade blade, the child's balloon
</dd>
<dd>''Eclipses both the sun and moon
</dd>
<dd>''To understand you know too soon
</dd>
<dd>''There is no sense in trying
</dd>
</dl>
<p>According to Seth Rogovoy, this opening echoes the Book of <a href="Ecclesiastes" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ecclesiastes</a>, where the author states (1:17) &quot;I observed all deeds beneath the sun, and behold all is futile.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> There are echoes of Ecclesiastes throughout the song. Another example is:<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a></p>
<dl>

<dd>''The masters make the rules
</dd>
<dd>''For the wise man and the fools.
</dd>
</dl>
<p>The author of Ecclesiastes laments (2:15–16) &quot;The fate of the fool will befall me also; to what advantage, then, have I become wise? But I come to the conclusion that this, too, was futility, because the wise man and the fool are both forgotten. The wise man dies, just like the fool.&quot;</p>
<p>One of the most famous lines from the song reminds listeners that even the most powerful people will ultimately be judged:<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a><a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a></p>
<dl>

<dd>''But even the president of the United States
</dd>
<dd>''Sometimes must have to stand naked
</dd>
</dl>
<p>These lines seemed particularly prescient when Dylan performed the song on his <a href="Bob_Dylan_and_The_Band_1974_Tour" title="wikilink">1974 tour</a> with <a href="The_Band" title="wikilink">The Band</a>, a few months before <a href="Richard_Nixon" title="wikilink">Richard Nixon</a> resigned as President of the United States as a result of the <a href="Watergate" class="uri" title="wikilink">Watergate</a> crisis.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a><a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> After the song has confronted sex, religion and politics, it end with the lines:<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a><a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a></p>
<dl>

<dd>''And if my thought-dreams could be seen
</dd>
<dd>''They'd probably put my head in a guillotine
</dd>
<dd>''But it's alright, Ma, it's life and life only
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Throughout the song, the words pour out quickly, with Dylan barely taking a breath between lines, so that the intricate rhyming structure is often missed: AAAAAB CCCCCB DDDDDB in the verses and AAB in the chorus.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a><a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a></p>
<p>Dylan has cited &quot;It's Alright, Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)&quot; as one of his songs that means the most to him.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> In 1980 he stated that &quot;I don't think I could sit down now and write 'It's Alright, Ma' again. I wouldn't even know where to begin, but I can still sing it.&quot;<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> The song has featured often in Dylan's live concerts, and concert performances of it have been released on <em><a href="The_Bootleg_Series_Vol._6:_Bob_Dylan_Live_1964,_Concert_at_Philharmonic_Hall" title="wikilink">The Bootleg Series Vol. 6: Bob Dylan Live 1964, Concert at Philharmonic Hall</a></em> (recorded on October 31, 1964), <em><a href="Before_the_Flood" title="wikilink">Before the Flood</a></em> (recorded in 1974) and <em><a href="Bob_Dylan_at_Budokan" title="wikilink">Bob Dylan at Budokan</a></em> (recorded in 1978).<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> Dylan also played the song on his <a href="Rolling_Thunder_Revue" title="wikilink">Rolling Thunder Revue</a> Tour in 1975 and 1976, as well as on his 1978 tour and his <a href="Never_Ending_Tour" title="wikilink">Never Ending Tour</a> from the late 1980s up to the present.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> Footage of Dylan playing &quot;It's Alright, Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)&quot; is included in the film <em><a href="Don&#39;t_Look_Back" title="wikilink">Don't Look Back</a></em>, and a live performance of Dylan playing the song with <a href="Tom_Petty_and_the_Heartbreakers" title="wikilink">Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers</a> is included in the video of the HBO special <em>Hard to Handle</em>.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a><a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> Dylan also sang this song at his 1993 30th anniversary celebration concert at <a href="Madison_Square_Garden" title="wikilink">Madison Square Garden</a>, which was released on <em><a href="The_30th_Anniversary_Concert_Celebration" title="wikilink">The 30th Anniversary Concert Celebration</a></em> album.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> The studio recording was re-released on the 2008 compilation album <em>Playlist: The Very Best of Bob Dylan '60s</em>.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a></p>

<p>Arguably the most widely known <a href="Cover_version" title="wikilink">cover</a> of the song is that performed by <a href="Roger_McGuinn" title="wikilink">Roger McGuinn</a> for the soundtrack of the 1969 film, <em><a href="Easy_Rider" title="wikilink">Easy Rider</a></em>. The film's scriptwriter and star, <a href="Peter_Fonda" title="wikilink">Peter Fonda</a>, had originally intended to use Dylan's version of the song in the film but after failing to secure the appropriate licensing he asked McGuinn to record a cover of it instead.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a><a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> Although McGuinn's version of &quot;It's Alright, Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)&quot; was listed as a solo performance on the <a href="Easy_Rider_(soundtrack)" title="wikilink"><em>Easy Rider</em> soundtrack album</a>, it actually features McGuinn on guitar and vocals, accompanied by his bandmate from <a href="The_Byrds" title="wikilink">The Byrds</a>, <a href="Gene_Parsons" title="wikilink">Gene Parsons</a>, on <a href="harmonica" class="uri" title="wikilink">harmonica</a>.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a></p>

<h2 id="influence">Influence</h2>
<p><a href="Clinton_Heylin" title="wikilink">Clinton Heylin</a>, in his biography <em>Bob Dylan: Behind the Shades Revisited</em>, wrote that the recording &quot;opened up a whole new genre of finger-pointing song, not just for Dylan but for the entire panoply of pop.&quot; To this, Heylin adds that &quot;It's Alright, Ma&quot; probably contained more &quot;memorable aphorisms&quot; than any of Dylan's songs.<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a> One of these lines is &quot;he not busy being born is busy dying,&quot; from the song's second verse, which was used by <a href="Jimmy_Carter" title="wikilink">Jimmy Carter</a> in his Presidential nomination acceptance speech at the <a href="1976_Democratic_National_Convention" title="wikilink">1976 Democratic National Convention</a>.<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a> During his campaign for President in 2000, <a href="Al_Gore" title="wikilink">Al Gore</a> told talk show host <a href="Oprah_Winfrey" title="wikilink">Oprah Winfrey</a> that this was his favorite quotation.<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a></p>

<p>In a 2005 reader's poll reported in <em><a href="Mojo_(magazine)" title="wikilink">Mojo</a></em> magazine, &quot;It's Alright, Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)&quot; was listed as the #8 all-time greatest Bob Dylan song, and a similar poll of artists ranked the song at #21.<a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a> In 2002, <em><a href="Uncut_(magazine)" title="wikilink">Uncut</a></em> magazine listed it as the #5 all-time Dylan song.<a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a> The song was featured in <a href="Made_in_America_(The_Sopranos)" title="wikilink">the final episode</a> of <em><a href="The_Sopranos" title="wikilink">The Sopranos</a></em>.<a href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a> It has also been referenced by other songwriters.
