<p><strong>Alpha Phi Alpha</strong> (<strong>&lt;U+0391&gt;&lt;U+03A6&gt;&lt;U+0391&gt;</strong>) is the first intercollegiate <a href="Fraternities_and_sororities" title="wikilink">fraternity</a> established by <a href="African_American" title="wikilink">African Americans</a>. Founded on <a href="December_4" title="wikilink">December 4</a>, <a href="1906" class="uri" title="wikilink">1906</a>, on the campus of <a href="Cornell_University" title="wikilink">Cornell University</a> () in <a href="Ithaca,_New_York" title="wikilink">Ithaca, New York</a>, as a social fraternity, Alpha Phi Alpha has initiated over 175,000 men into the organization and has been open to men of all races since 1945. The fraternity utilizes motifs and artifacts from <a href="Ancient_Egypt" title="wikilink">Ancient Egypt</a> to represent the organization and preserves its archives at the <a href="Moorland-Spingarn_Research_Center" title="wikilink">Moorland-Spingarn Research Center</a>.</p>
<p>The founders, Henry Callis, Charles Chapman, Eugene Jones, George Kelley, Nathaniel Murray, Robert Ogle, and Vertner Tandy, are collectively known as the &quot;<a href=":Category:Alpha_Phi_Alpha_founders" title="wikilink">Seven Jewels</a>&quot;. The fraternity expanded when a second chapter was chartered at <a href="Howard_University" title="wikilink">Howard University</a> in 1907. Beginning in 1908, Alpha Phi Alpha became the prototype for other Black Greek Letter Organizations (BGLO). Today, there are over 680 active Alpha chapters in the Americas, Africa, Europe, Asia, the West Indies, and the <a href="Virgin_Islands" title="wikilink">Virgin Islands</a></p>
<p>Alpha Phi Alpha evolved into a primarily service organization and has provided leadership and service during the Great Depression, <a href="World_war" title="wikilink">World Wars</a>, <a href="Civil_rights_movement#Civil_Rights_Movement_in_the_United_States" title="wikilink">Civil Rights Movements</a>, and addresses social issues such as <a href="wiktionary:apartheid" title="wikilink">apartheid</a> and urban housing, and other economic, cultural, and political issues affecting <a href="black_people" title="wikilink">people of color</a>. The <a href="Martin_Luther_King,_Jr._National_Memorial" title="wikilink">Martin Luther King, Jr. National Memorial</a> is a project of Alpha Phi Alpha and the fraternity jointly leads philanthropic programming initiatives with <a href="March_of_Dimes" title="wikilink">March of Dimes</a>, <a href="Head_Start" title="wikilink">Head Start</a>, <a href="Boy_Scouts_of_America" title="wikilink">Boy Scouts of America</a> and <a href="Big_Brothers_Big_Sisters_of_America" title="wikilink">Big Brothers Big Sisters of America</a>.</p>

Cornell University was the site of the founding of Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity, Inc., in 1905, although the organization would remain unnamed until 1906." /> At the start of the 20<sup>th</sup> century, black students attending American universities were often excluded from the personal and close associations the predominantly <a href="Caucasian_race" title="wikilink">white</a> student population enjoyed in existing fraternal organizations.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> During the 1905&lt;U+2013&gt;06 school year, <a href="Cornell_University" title="wikilink">Cornell University</a> witnessed the organization of the first Greek letter fraternity for black students, by black students. Alpha Phi Alpha was organized with the stated desire of providing a mechanism to build those associations and provide mutual support among African American students. At the outset, there was disagreement about the group's purpose. Some desired to organize a social and literary club where all persons could participate. Others in the group supported a traditional fraternal organization. The overwhelming sentiment was dissatisfaction with lack of access to a literary society and members proposed to enlarge the functions of the group. The fraternal supporters were in the minority and the society thereafter organized with the intention of providing a literary, study, social, and support group for all minority students who encountered social and academic racial prejudice.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>

The fraternity was still in process of formation and the divisive issue of whether the terms &quot;club&quot; or &quot;fraternity&quot; be used was debated within the group.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>By <a href="December_4" title="wikilink">December 4</a>, <a href="1906" class="uri" title="wikilink">1906</a>, the members' views changed and the decision was made to become a fraternity.

<p>During the <a href="Great_Depression" title="wikilink">Great Depression</a>, Alpha Phi Alpha and its members continued to implement programs which it deemed affected the black community. The Committee on Public Policy, the Alpha Phi Alpha Education Foundation and &quot;The Foundation Publishers&quot; were established at the 1933 general convention.

The first investigation of the committee was of <a href="Franklin_D._Roosevelt" title="wikilink">Franklin D. Roosevelt</a>'s <a href="New_Deal" title="wikilink">New Deal</a> agencies.

This period is the time the <a href="pledge" class="uri" title="wikilink">pledge</a> learns of the organization's history, principles and tenacity of brotherhood.</p>
<p>An Alpha Phi Alpha Pledge is initially referred to as a &quot;Sphinxman&quot;, and later an &quot;Ape&quot; during &quot;Hell Week&quot; when pledges are submitted to compounded endurances.</p>
<p>In the selection of candidates for membership, certain chapters had not escaped challenges of racial stereotyping and allegations of <a href="colorism" class="uri" title="wikilink">colorism</a>. In a biography of Justice Thurgood Marshall, the authors recounted how certain chapters of the fraternity used a &quot;brown paper bag test&quot; and would not consider students whose skin color was darker than the bag.<a href="#fn76" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref76"><sup>76</sup></a> General President Belford Lawson, Jr. lamented this attitude and condemned initiation practices of snobbery and exclusivity, and said &quot;<a href="Jesus" title="wikilink">Jesus Christ</a> could not make Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity today; they would <a href="Blackball_(blacklist)" title="wikilink">blackball</a> Him because He was not <em>hot enough</em>&quot;.<a href="#fn77" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref77"><sup>77</sup></a></p>

<p>There are periods in the history of the fraternity where <a href="hazing" class="uri" title="wikilink">hazing</a> was involved in certain pledge lines. The fraternity has never condoned hazing, but has been aware of problems with &quot;rushing&quot; and &quot;initiations&quot; dated as far back as the 1934 General Convention when the fraternity founders communicated their concern with physical violence in initiation ceremonies.<a href="#fn78" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref78"><sup>78</sup></a> At the 1940 General Convention, a pledge manual was discussed that would contain a brief general history, the list of chapters and locations, the achievements of Alpha men, outstanding Alpha men, and pledge procedures.<a href="#fn79" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref79"><sup>79</sup></a></p>

<p>Hazing is now against the law in many U.S. states; that and the objections of parents, students, and fraternity alumni have prompted Alpha Phi Alpha to implement its current policy abolishing pledging as a means of obtaining membership. The fraternity's official policy is that hazing is against the purposes and goals of the Fraternity and has been discontinued as a condition or manner of initiation into the membership of Alpha Phi Alpha. It is no longer legal within the organization for members to establish a pledge line or to require aspirants to the organization to submit to hazing. All membership intake activities for the fraternity are conducted by the National Intake Office and must occur in the presence of a National Intake Officer.<a href="#fn80" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref80"><sup>80</sup></a></p>

<p>The other BGLOs to come in succession with four additional being founded at Howard University, namely, <a href="Omega_Psi_Phi" title="wikilink">Omega Psi Phi</a> (1911), <a href="Delta_Sigma_Theta" title="wikilink">Delta Sigma Theta</a> (1913), <a href="Phi_Beta_Sigma" title="wikilink">Phi Beta Sigma</a> (1914) and <a href="Zeta_Phi_Beta" title="wikilink">Zeta Phi Beta</a> (1920). <a href="Sigma_Gamma_Rho" title="wikilink">Sigma Gamma Rho</a> (1922) and <a href="Iota_Phi_Theta_Fraternity,_Inc." title="wikilink">Iota Phi Theta</a> (1963) were founded at <a href="Butler_University" title="wikilink">Butler University</a> and <a href="Morgan_State_University" title="wikilink">Morgan State University</a> respectively.<a href="#fn107" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref107"><sup>107</sup></a></p>

<p>Alpha Phi Alpha holds the historic position as the first intercollegiate Greek-letter fraternity in the United States established for people of African descent, and the <a href="wiktionary:paragon" title="wikilink">paragon</a> for the remaining BGLOs to follow.<a href="#fn108" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref108"><sup>108</sup></a> Historian Charles H. Wesley, a member of Alpha Phi Alpha, authored <em>The History of Alpha Phi Alpha, A Development in College Life</em> and asserts that Alpha Phi Alpha was the first Greek-letter organization among black college students.<a href="#fn109" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref109"><sup>109</sup></a> The history books of Kappa Alpha Psi, Omega Psi Phi and Phi Beta Sigma omit the fraternity's place and contribution to the college Negro fraternal movement. Historian and Alpha archivist Herman Mason has stated, &quot;As a historian who recognizes that laying a foundation for any period of history, I find their omission inexcusable and without merit.&quot;<a href="#fn110" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref110"><sup>110</sup></a></p>
