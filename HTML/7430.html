<p>Blaze is a 14-year-old, purple <a href="anthropomorphism" title="wikilink">anthropomorphic</a> cat, standing 95 cm (3'1&quot;) tall.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a><a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a><a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> While creating the 2005 <a href="Nintendo_DS" title="wikilink">Nintendo DS</a> game <em><a href="Sonic_Rush" title="wikilink">Sonic Rush</a></em>, which would host Blaze's first appearance, developer <a href="Sonic_Team" title="wikilink">Sonic Team</a> desgined her to play like <a href="Sonic_the_Hedgehog_(character)" title="wikilink">Sonic the Hedgehog</a>&lt;U+2014&gt;who stars in the game alongside her&lt;U+2014&gt;but with a dance-like style of movement.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> Mirroring her name, Blaze has powerful <a href="pyrokinesis" title="wikilink">pyrokinetic</a> abilities.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>Blaze comes from a world outside the main <em><a href="Sonic_the_Hedgehog_(series)" title="wikilink">Sonic the Hedgehog</a></em> series.

Her personality is calm, <a href="extraversion_and_introversion" title="wikilink">introverted</a>, and stoic, although this sometimes conceals a greater level of emotion. She is highly disciplined and focused on her job as the Sol Emeralds' guardian, and frequently suffers from this high degree of self-pressure.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a><a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> She also has difficulty making friends and, when she does, frequently rejects their offers to help her.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a><a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>

<p>Blaze is a recurring character in the <em><a href="Sonic_the_Hedgehog_(comics)" title="wikilink">Sonic the Hedgehog</a></em> comic book series published by <a href="Archie_Comics" title="wikilink">Archie Comics</a>. She suffers frequent dreams about a blue hedgehog and arrives in Sonic's world, known in the comics as Mobius, to seek him out. However, she is captured, knocked unconscious, and imprisoned by Eggman's robots; she wakes up and destroys them and part of the facility while Sonic simultaneously arrives to rescue her.<a href="#fn90" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref90"><sup>90</sup></a> Blaze attacks him, but he whips up air currents around her and she almost suffocates until he saves her from them. Unfazed and ungrateful, she vanishes.<a href="#fn91" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref91"><sup>91</sup></a> She next appears in a <em>Rush Adventure</em> adaptation, where she attains great respect for Sonic.<a href="#fn92" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref92"><sup>92</sup></a> Her story on the island with Marine continues with the two rescuing Shadow from drowning in the ocean.

<p>Blaze re-enters the comics' main arc when she returns to Mobius to look for more Sol Emeralds. She finds Amy and Cream and fights them, thinking they have found one and are keeping it from her, but apologizes when it turns out to be a broken glass bottle. Amy and Cream sense her need for help and go with her as she searches for Emeralds. <a href="Rouge_the_Bat" title="wikilink">Rouge the Bat</a> arrives and assists them by flying Blaze down into a ravine and defending the three from a giant falling tree branch, but when they all reach the Emerald, Rouge steals it for herself. <a href="E-123_Omega" title="wikilink">E-123 Omega</a> and Shadow show up to defend Rouge; in a resultant scuffle, the Emerald changes hands a few times before being stolen by <a href="Nack_the_Weasel" title="wikilink">Nack the Weasel</a>. Still desiring some level of friendship, Shadow attempts to explain his actions, but Blaze brushes him off.<a href="#fn94" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref94"><sup>94</sup></a> She steals Shadow's motorcycle and with it she, Cream, and Amy chase Nack; Shadow shows up again to apologize, with the same result.

As Shadow and Rouge again come to their aid, Blaze successfully obtains the Emerald, says goodbye to Amy and Cream, and returns to her world.<a href="#fn96" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref96"><sup>96</sup></a> Later, in a lengthy <em><a href="Mega_Man" title="wikilink">Mega Man</a></em> crossover arc, Blaze appears to assist Sonic and other <em>Sonic</em> and <a href="List_of_Mega_Man_characters" title="wikilink"><em>Mega Man</em> characters</a> in combating antagonist <a href="Dr._Wily" title="wikilink">Dr. Wily</a> and his robot army.<a href="#fn97" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref97"><sup>97</sup></a></p>
