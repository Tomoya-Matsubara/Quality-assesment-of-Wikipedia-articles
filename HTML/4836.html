<h2 id="plot">Plot</h2>
<h3 id="season-1">Season 1</h3>

<p><a href="Bo_Jones_(Lost_Girl)" title="wikilink">Bo</a> is a succubus who grew up in an adoptive <a href="human" class="uri" title="wikilink">human</a> family, unaware of her non-human nature and of the <a href="Fairy" title="wikilink">Fae</a> world. Her succubus powers only become apparent to her when she accidentally kills her first love by draining him of his life energy, an act which forces her to flee her home. Bo exchanges her previously normal life for one without family or friends, moving from place to place whenever she kills again.</p>
<p>In the pilot episode, Bo saves a human girl named Kenzi; the two quickly become friends and Kenzi decides they should team up to create a Fae/Human detective agency. Confronted by the Fae elders with having to choose a side (&quot;Light&quot; or &quot;Dark&quot;), Bo declares herself neutral, deciding to side with humans after Kenzi risked her life to find what had happened to Bo for her own sake where most of the Fae simply saw her as another factor on the board. Throughout the season, Bo learns more about the Fae world and herself while she searches for information about her origins. Along the way, Bo also develops romantic relationships with both Dyson, a wolf shifter <a href="police_detective" title="wikilink">police detective</a> and Lauren, a human <a href="Physician" title="wikilink">doctor</a>.</p>
<h3 id="season-2">Season 2</h3>

While Bo grows stronger and learns more about who she really is, relationships will be tested and passions will ignite, but answers will not come easily.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>

<p>On August 19, 2009, Canwest Global issued a press release that the Showcase television channel, a subsidiary of the main company, had picked up the rights to a one hour supernatural drama series. The cast would include <a href="Anna_Silk" title="wikilink">Anna Silk</a>, previously in such series as <em><a href="Billable_Hours" title="wikilink">Billable Hours</a></em> and <em><a href="Being_Erica" title="wikilink">Being Erica</a></em>, filling the lead role of the character Bo in the series. <a href="Kristen_Holden-Ried" title="wikilink">Kristen Holden-Ried</a>, from the series <em><a href="The_Tudors" title="wikilink">The Tudors</a></em>, as another main character named Dyson, an inhuman cop involved in a love/hate relationship with Bo, and two-time <a href="Gemini_Award" title="wikilink">Gemini Award</a> winner <a href="Ksenia_Solo" title="wikilink">Ksenia Solo</a> as a third character named Kenzi, Bo&lt;U+2019&gt;s street-smart and fiercely loyal human best friend.

<p>On April 7, 2010, Prodigy reported that the <a href="green-light" class="uri" title="wikilink">green-light</a> had been given for a series to be produced to consist of thirteen one-hour episodes.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> Production on the series began in Toronto, Ontario, Canada in the spring of 2010, at sites across southern Ontario and at a small studio in western Toronto.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> Completion of the series' primary production occurred June 25, and the series was aimed for a September 2010 release date.</p>

<p>As part of the promotion of the series, an official site was opened at the beginning of August 2010 at lostgirlseries.com. It contained a short trailer for the series, and a summary of information on the series and the characters. On August 20, an interactive comic book was also released that would serve as a lead-in to the series and characters for viewers.

<h2 id="reception">Reception</h2>
<p>Viewership of the <a href="television_pilot" title="wikilink">pilot</a> was over 400,000 for the first airing, and &quot;another 184,000&quot; for the second airing, making it the &quot;highest-rated Canadian scripted series premiere of all time on Showcase.&quot;<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a></p>
<p>In Canada, Rob Salem of the <em><a href="Toronto_Star" title="wikilink">Toronto Star</a></em> described the show as one that &quot;definitely bears watching.&quot;<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> Vladislav Tinchev, writer for the German site <em>Serienjunkies</em> wrote that the series would benefit from &quot;revealing more background information about the represented world,&quot; rather than spend time on &quot;clumsy action scenes.&quot; But Tinchev pointed out that &quot;<em>Lost Girl</em> is not lost at all, and has immediately won the audience and entertains them well. And there is nothing wrong with that, because TV series need not be world-shaking events.&quot;<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a></p>
<p>Upon its U.S. premiere, <em>The New York Times</em> said &quot;Like other fantasy-tinged shows on Syfy and USA, it offers the minor pleasures of formulaic fantasy and weekly puzzle solving, though in a cheaper-looking and less original package than usual&quot;; &quot;<em>Lost Girl</em> could be more than routine if we felt Bo&lt;U+2019&gt;s magnetism the way her hapless victims do, but through the first few episodes Ms. Silk is more stolid than steamy.&quot;<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> In his review for <em>Variety</em>, Brian Lowry wrote: &quot;At first glance, <em>Lost Girl</em> looks like another one of those Canadian imports picked up mostly for financial reasons. The pilot, however, proves unexpectedly fun—a sort of diluted version of <em><a href="True_Blood" title="wikilink">True Blood</a></em>... but the show has wit, style and an enticing lead in the leather-clad Anna Silk.&quot;<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a></p>
