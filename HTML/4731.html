In folkloric tales, the <a href="undead" class="uri" title="wikilink">undead</a> vampires often visited loved ones and caused mischief or deaths in the neighbourhoods they inhabited when they were alive. They wore shrouds and were often described as bloated and of ruddy or dark countenance, markedly different from today's gaunt, pale vampire which dates from the early 1800s. Although vampiric entities have been <a href="Vampire_folklore_by_region" title="wikilink">recorded in most cultures</a>, the term <em>vampire</em> was not popularised until the early 18th century, after an influx of vampire superstition into Western Europe from areas where vampire legends were frequent, such as the <a href="Balkans" class="uri" title="wikilink">Balkans</a> and Eastern Europe,<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> although local variants were also known by different names, such as <em><a href="vrykolakas" class="uri" title="wikilink">vrykolakas</a></em> in <a href="Greece" class="uri" title="wikilink">Greece</a> and <em><a href="strigoi" class="uri" title="wikilink">strigoi</a></em> in <a href="Romania" class="uri" title="wikilink">Romania</a>. This increased level of vampire superstition in Europe led to what can only be called <a href="mass_hysteria" title="wikilink">mass hysteria</a> and in some cases resulted in corpses actually being staked and people being accused of vampirism.</p>
<p>In modern times, however, the vampire is generally held to be a fictitious entity, although belief in similar vampiric creatures such as the <em><a href="chupacabra" class="uri" title="wikilink">chupacabra</a></em> still persists in some cultures. Early folkloric belief in vampires has been ascribed to the ignorance of the body's process of <a href="decomposition" class="uri" title="wikilink">decomposition</a> after death and how people in pre-industrial societies tried to rationalise this, creating the figure of the vampire to explain the mysteries of death. <a href="Porphyria" class="uri" title="wikilink">Porphyria</a> was also linked with legends of vampirism in 1985 and received much media exposure, but has since been largely discredited.</p>
<p>The charismatic and sophisticated vampire of modern fiction was born in <a href="1819_in_literature" title="wikilink">1819</a> with the publication of <em><a href="The_Vampyre" title="wikilink">The Vampyre</a></em> by <a href="John_William_Polidori" title="wikilink">John Polidori</a>; the story was highly successful and arguably the most influential vampire work of the early 19th century.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> However, it is <a href="Bram_Stoker" title="wikilink">Bram Stoker's</a> <a href="1897_in_literature" title="wikilink">1897</a> novel <em><a href="Dracula" class="uri" title="wikilink">Dracula</a></em> which is remembered as the quintessential <a href="Vampire_literature" title="wikilink">vampire novel</a> and provided the basis of the modern vampire legend. The success of this book spawned a distinctive vampire <a href="genre" class="uri" title="wikilink">genre</a>, still popular in the 21st century, with books, films, and television shows. The vampire has since become a dominant figure in the horror genre.</p>
<h2 id="etymology">Etymology</h2>
<p>The <em><a href="Oxford_English_Dictionary" title="wikilink">Oxford English Dictionary</a></em> dates the first appearance of the word <em>vampire</em> in English from 1734, in a travelogue titled <em>Travels of Three English Gentlemen</em> published in the <em><a href="Harleian_Miscellany" title="wikilink">Harleian Miscellany</a></em> in 1745.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a><a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> Many mentions of the subject had been made in <a href="German_language" title="wikilink">German</a> literature.

<h2 id="folk-beliefs">Folk beliefs</h2>
<p>The notion of vampirism has existed for millennia; cultures such as the <a href="Mesopotamia" title="wikilink">Mesopotamians</a>, <a href="Hebrews" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hebrews</a>, <a href="Ancient_Greece" title="wikilink">Ancient Greeks</a>, and <a href="Ancient_Rome" title="wikilink">Romans</a> had tales of demons and spirits which are considered precursors to modern vampires. However, despite the occurrence of vampire-like creatures in these ancient civilizations, the folklore for the entity we know today as the vampire originates almost exclusively from early 18th century Southeastern Europe,<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> when <a href="oral_culture" title="wikilink">verbal traditions</a> of many ethnic groups of the region were recorded and published. In most cases, vampires are <a href="Revenant_(folklore)" title="wikilink">revenants</a> of evil beings, suicide victims, or witches, but they can also be created by a malevolent spirit possessing a corpse or by being bitten by a vampire. Belief in such legends became so pervasive that in some areas it caused <a href="mass_hysteria" title="wikilink">mass hysteria</a> and even public executions of people believed to be vampires.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="description-and-common-attributes">Description and common attributes</h3>
<p><img src="Munch_vampire.jpg" title="fig:Vampyren &quot;The Vampire&quot;, by Edvard Munch." alt="Vampyren &quot;The Vampire&quot;, by Edvard Munch." width="225" /> It is difficult to make a single, definitive description of the folkloric vampire, though there are several elements common to many European legends. Vampires were usually reported as bloated in appearance, and ruddy, purplish, or dark in colour; these characteristics were often attributed to the recent drinking of blood. Indeed, blood was often seen seeping from the mouth and nose when one was seen in its shroud or coffin and its left eye was often open.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> It would be clad in the linen shroud it was buried in, and its teeth, hair, and nails may have grown somewhat, though in general fangs were not a feature.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a></p>
<p>Other attributes varied greatly from culture to culture; some vampires, such as those found in Transylvanian tales, were gaunt, pale, and had long fingernails, while those from <a href="Bulgaria" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bulgaria</a> only had one nostril,<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> and <a href="Bavaria" title="wikilink">Bavarian</a> vampires slept with thumbs crossed and one eye open.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> <a href="Moravia" title="wikilink">Moravian</a> vampires only attacked while naked, and those of <a href="Albania" title="wikilink">Albanian</a> folklore wore high-heeled shoes.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> As stories of vampires spread throughout the globe to the Americas and elsewhere, so did the varied and sometimes bizarre descriptions of them: <a href="Mexico" title="wikilink">Mexican</a> vampires had a bare skull instead of a head,<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> <a href="Brazil" title="wikilink">Brazilian</a> vampires had furry feet and vampires from the <a href="Rocky_Mountains" title="wikilink">Rocky Mountains</a> only sucked blood with their noses and from the victim's ears.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> Common attributes were sometimes described, such as red hair.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> Some were reported to be able to <a href="Shapeshifting" title="wikilink">transform</a> into bats, rats, dogs, wolves, spiders and even moths.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> From these various legends, works of literature such as <a href="Bram_Stoker" title="wikilink">Bram Stoker's</a> <em>Dracula</em>, and the influences of historical figures such as <a href="Gilles_de_Rais" title="wikilink">Gilles de Rais</a>, <a href="Elizabeth_Bathory" title="wikilink">Elizabeth Bathory</a>, and <a href="Vlad_III_the_Impaler" title="wikilink">Vlad &lt;U+0162&gt;epe&lt;U+015F&gt;</a>, the vampire developed into the modern stereotype.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a><a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a></p>
<h4 id="creating-vampires">Creating vampires</h4>
<p>The causes of vampiric generation were many and varied in original folklore. In Slavic and Chinese traditions, any corpse which was jumped over by an animal, particularly a dog or a cat, was feared to become one of the undead.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> A body with a wound which had not been treated with boiling water was also at risk. In Russian folklore, vampires were said to have once been witches or people who had rebelled against the Church while they were alive.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a></p>
<p>Cultural practices often arose that were intended to prevent a recently deceased loved one from turning into an undead revenant. Burying a corpse upside-down was widespread, as was placing earthly objects, such as <a href="scythe" title="wikilink">scythes</a> or <a href="sickle" title="wikilink">sickles</a>,<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> near the grave to satisfy any demons entering the body or to appease the dead so that it would not wish to arise from its coffin. This method resembles the <a href="Ancient_Greek" title="wikilink">Ancient Greek</a> practice of placing an <a href="obolus" class="uri" title="wikilink">obolus</a> in the corpse's mouth to pay the toll to cross the <a href="River_Styx" title="wikilink">River Styx</a> in the underworld; it has been argued that instead, the coin was intended to ward off any evil spirits from entering the body, and this may have influenced later vampire folklore. This tradition persisted in modern Greek folklore about the <em><a href="vrykolakas" class="uri" title="wikilink">vrykolakas</a></em>, in which a wax cross and piece of pottery with the inscription &quot;Jesus Christ conquers&quot; were placed on the corpse to prevent the body from becoming a vampire.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> Other methods commonly practised in Europe included severing the tendons at the knees or placing poppy seeds, millet, or sand on the ground at the grave site of a presumed vampire; this was intended to keep the vampire occupied all night by counting the fallen grains.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> Similar Chinese narratives state that if a vampire-like being came across a sack of rice, it would have to count every grain; this is a theme encountered in myths from the Indian subcontinent as well as in South American tales of witches and other sorts of evil or mischievous spirits or beings.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a></p>
<h4 id="identifying-vampires">Identifying vampires</h4>
<p>Many elaborate rituals were used to identify a vampire. One method of finding a vampire's grave involved leading a virgin boy through a graveyard or church grounds on a virgin stallion—the horse would supposedly balk at the grave in question.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> Generally a black horse was required, though in Albania it should be white.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> Holes appearing in the earth over a grave were taken as a sign of vampirism.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a></p>
<p>Corpses thought to be vampires were generally described as having a healthier appearance than expected, plump and showing little or no signs of decomposition.<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> In some cases, when suspected graves were opened, villagers even described the corpse as having fresh blood from a victim all over its face.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a> Evidence that a vampire was active in a given locality included death of cattle, sheep, relatives or neighbours. Folkloric vampires could also make their presence felt by engaging in minor <a href="poltergeist" class="uri" title="wikilink">poltergeist</a>-like activity, such as hurling stones on roofs or moving household objects,<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a> and <a href="mara_(folklore)" title="wikilink">pressing</a> on people in their sleep.<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a></p>

The items vary from region to region; a branch of <a href="wild_rose" title="wikilink">wild rose</a> and <a href="Common_hawthorn" title="wikilink">hawthorn</a> plant are said to harm vampires; in Europe, sprinkling mustard seeds on the roof of a house was said to keep them away.<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a> Other apotropaics include sacred items, for example a <a href="crucifix" class="uri" title="wikilink">crucifix</a>, <a href="rosary" class="uri" title="wikilink">rosary</a>, or holy water. Vampires are said to be unable to walk on consecrated ground, such as those of churches or temples, or cross running water.<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a> Although not traditionally regarded as an apotropaic, mirrors have been used to ward off vampires when placed facing outwards on a door (vampires do not have a reflection and in some cultures, do not cast shadows, perhaps as a manifestation of the vampire's lack of a soul).<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a> This attribute, although not universal (the Greek <em>vrykolakas/tympanios</em> was capable of both reflection and shadow), was utilized by Bram Stoker in <em>Dracula</em> and has remained popular with subsequent authors and filmmakers.<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a> Some traditions also hold that a vampire cannot enter a house unless invited by the owner, although after the first invitation they can come and go as they please.<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a> Though folkloric vampires were believed to be more active at night, they were not generally considered vulnerable to sunlight.<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a></p>
<p>Methods of destroying suspected vampires varied, with staking the most commonly cited method, particularly in southern Slavic cultures.<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a> <a href="Ash_tree" title="wikilink">Ash</a> was the preferred wood in Russia and the Baltic states,<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a> or <a href="Common_Hawthorn" title="wikilink">hawthorn</a> in Serbia,<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a> with a record of <a href="oak" class="uri" title="wikilink">oak</a> in <a href="Silesia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Silesia</a>.<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a> Potential vampires were most often staked though the heart, though the mouth was targeted in Russia and northern Germany<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a><a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a> and the stomach in northeastern Serbia.<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a> Piercing the skin of the chest was a way of &quot;deflating&quot; the bloated vampire; this is similar to the act of burying sharp objects, such as sickles, in with the corpse, so that they may penetrate the skin if the body bloats sufficiently while transforming into a revenant.<a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a> <a href="Decapitation" class="uri" title="wikilink">Decapitation</a> was the preferred method in German and western Slavic areas, with the head buried between the feet, behind the buttocks or away from the body.<a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a> This act was seen as a way of hastening the departure of the soul, which in some cultures, was said to linger in the corpse. The vampire's head, body, or clothes could also be spiked and pinned to the earth to prevent rising.<a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a> Gypsies drove steel or iron needles into a corpse's heart and placed bits of steel in the mouth, over the eyes, ears and between the fingers at the time of burial. They also placed hawthorn in the corpse's sock or drove a hawthorn stake through the legs. Further measures included pouring boiling water over the grave or complete incineration of the body. In the Balkans a vampire could also be killed by being shot or drowned, by repeating the funeral service, by sprinkling <a href="holy_water" title="wikilink">holy water</a> on the body, or by <a href="exorcism" class="uri" title="wikilink">exorcism</a>. In Romania garlic could be placed in the mouth, and as recently as the 19th century, the precaution of shooting a bullet through the coffin was taken. For resistant cases, the body was dismembered and the pieces burned, mixed with water, and administered to family members as a cure. In Saxon regions of Germany, a lemon was placed in the mouth of suspected vampires.<a href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a></p>

The <a href="1100s" title="wikilink">12th-century</a> English historians and chroniclers <a href="Walter_Map" title="wikilink">Walter Map</a> and <a href="William_of_Newburgh" title="wikilink">William of Newburgh</a> recorded accounts of <a href="revenant_(folklore)" title="wikilink">revenants</a>,<a href="#fn80" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref80"><sup>80</sup></a><a href="#fn81" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref81"><sup>81</sup></a> though records in English legends of vampiric beings after this date are scant.<a href="#fn82" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref82"><sup>82</sup></a> These tales are similar to the later folklore widely reported from Eastern Europe in the 18th century and were the basis of the vampire legend that later entered Germany and England, where they were subsequently embellished and popularised.</p>
<p>During the 18th century, there was a frenzy of vampire sightings in Eastern Europe, with frequent stakings and grave diggings to identify and kill the potential revenants; even government officials were compelled into the hunting and staking of vampires.<a href="#fn83" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref83"><sup>83</sup></a> Despite being called the <a href="Age_of_Enlightenment" title="wikilink">Age of Enlightenment</a>, during which most folkloric legends were quelled, the belief in vampires increased dramatically, resulting in a <a href="mass_hysteria" title="wikilink">mass hysteria</a> throughout most of Europe.<a href="#fn84" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref84"><sup>84</sup></a> The panic began with an outbreak of alleged vampire attacks in <a href="East_Prussia" title="wikilink">East Prussia</a> in 1721 and in the <a href="Habsburg_Monarchy" title="wikilink">Habsburg Monarchy</a> from 1725 to 1734, which spread to other localities. Two famous vampire cases, the first to be officially recorded, involved the corpses of <a href="Peter_Plogojowitz" title="wikilink">Peter Plogojowitz</a> and <a href="Arnold_Paole" title="wikilink">Arnold Paole</a> from <a href="Serbia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Serbia</a>. Plogojowitz was reported to have died at the age of 62, but allegedly returned after his death asking his son for food. When the son refused, he was found dead the following day. Plogojowitz supposedly returned and attacked some neighbours who died from loss of blood.<a href="#fn85" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref85"><sup>85</sup></a> In the second case, Paole, an ex-soldier turned farmer who allegedly was attacked by a vampire years before, died while <a href="haying" class="uri" title="wikilink">haying</a>.

<p>The two incidents were well-documented: government officials examined the bodies, wrote case reports, and published books throughout Europe.<a href="#fn87" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref87"><sup>87</sup></a> The hysteria, commonly referred to as the &quot;18th-Century Vampire Controversy&quot;, raged for a generation. The problem was exacerbated by rural epidemics of so-claimed vampire attacks, undoubtedly caused by the higher amount of superstition that was present in village communities, with locals digging up bodies and in some cases, staking them. Although many scholars reported during this period that vampires did not exist, and attributed reports to premature burial or <a href="rabies" class="uri" title="wikilink">rabies</a>, superstitious belief increased. <a href="Antoine_Augustine_Calmet" title="wikilink">Dom Augustine Calmet</a>, a well-respected French <a href="theologian" class="uri" title="wikilink">theologian</a> and scholar, put together a comprehensive treatise in 1746, which was ambiguous concerning the existence of vampires. Calmet amassed reports of vampire incidents; numerous readers, including both a critical <a href="Voltaire" class="uri" title="wikilink">Voltaire</a> and supportive <a href="demonologist" title="wikilink">demonologists</a>, interpreted the treatise as claiming that vampires existed.<a href="#fn88" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref88"><sup>88</sup></a> In his <em><a href="Dictionnaire_philosophique" title="wikilink">Philosophical Dictionary</a></em>, Voltaire wrote:<a href="#fn89" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref89"><sup>89</sup></a></p>

He concluded that vampires did not exist and the Empress passed laws prohibiting the opening of graves and desecration of bodies, sounding the end of the vampire epidemics.

There are many documented cases of families disinterring loved ones and removing their hearts in the belief that the deceased was a vampire who was responsible for sickness and death in the family, although the term &quot;vampire&quot; was never actually used to describe the deceased. The deadly disease <a href="tuberculosis" class="uri" title="wikilink">tuberculosis</a>, or &quot;consumption&quot; as it was known at the time, was believed to be caused by nightly visitations on the part of a dead family member who had died of consumption themselves.<a href="#fn98" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref98"><sup>98</sup></a> The most famous, and most recently recorded, case of suspected vampirism is that of nineteen-year-old <a href="Mercy_Brown_vampire_incident" title="wikilink">Mercy Brown</a>, who died in Exeter, Rhode Island in 1892.

<p>Rooted in older folklore, the modern belief in vampires spread throughout Asia with tales of ghoulish entities from the mainland, to vampiric beings from the islands of <a href="Southeast_Asia" title="wikilink">Southeast Asia</a>. India also developed other vampiric legends. The <em><a href="Bh&lt;U+016B&gt;ta" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bh&lt;U+016B&gt;ta</a></em> or <em>Pr&lt;U+00E9&gt;t</em> is the soul of a man who died an untimely death.

The mandurugo is a variety of the <a href="aswang" class="uri" title="wikilink">aswang</a> that takes the form of an attractive girl by day, and develops wings and a long, hollow, thread-like tongue by night. The tongue is used to suck up blood from a sleeping victim. The <em>manananggal</em> is described as being an older, beautiful woman capable of severing its upper torso in order to fly into the night with huge bat-like wings and prey on unsuspecting, sleeping pregnant women in their homes. They use an elongated proboscis-like tongue to suck fetuses off these pregnant women. They also prefer to eat entrails (specifically the heart and the liver) and the phlegm of sick people.<a href="#fn102" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref102"><sup>102</sup></a></p>
<p>The Malaysian <em><a href="Penanggalan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Penanggalan</a></em> may be either a beautiful old or young woman who obtained her beauty through the active use of <a href="black_magic" title="wikilink">black magic</a> or other unnatural means, and is most commonly described in local folklores to be dark or demonic in nature.

<p>In modern fiction, the vampire tends to be depicted as a suave, charismatic villain.<a href="#fn111" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref111"><sup>111</sup></a> Despite the general disbelief in vampiric entities, occasional sightings of vampires are reported. Indeed, vampire hunting societies still exist, although they are largely formed for social reasons.<a href="#fn112" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref112"><sup>112</sup></a> Allegations of vampire attacks swept through the <a href="Africa" title="wikilink">African</a> country of <a href="Malawi" class="uri" title="wikilink">Malawi</a> during late 2002 and early 2003, with mobs stoning one individual to death and attacking at least four others, including Governor <a href="Eric_Chiwaya" title="wikilink">Eric Chiwaya</a>, based on the belief that the government was colluding with vampires.<a href="#fn113" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref113"><sup>113</sup></a></p>
<p>In early 1970 local press spread rumors that a vampire haunted <a href="Highgate_Cemetery" title="wikilink">Highgate Cemetery</a> in <a href="London" class="uri" title="wikilink">London</a>. Amateur vampire hunters flocked in large numbers to the cemetery. Several books have been written about the case, notably by Sean Manchester, a local man who was among the first to suggest the existence of the &quot;<a href="Highgate_Vampire" title="wikilink">Highgate Vampire</a>&quot; and who later claimed to have <a href="exorcise" title="wikilink">exorcised</a> and destroyed a whole nest of vampires in the area.<a href="#fn114" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref114"><sup>114</sup></a> In January 2005, rumours circulated that an attacker had bitten a number of people in <a href="Birmingham" class="uri" title="wikilink">Birmingham</a>, <a href="England" class="uri" title="wikilink">England</a>, fuelling concerns about a vampire roaming the streets.

<p>In Europe, where much of the vampire folklore originates, the vampire is considered a fictitious being, although many communities have embraced the revenant for economic purposes. In some cases, especially in small localities, vampire superstition is still rampant and sightings or claims of vampire attacks occur frequently. In <a href="Romania" class="uri" title="wikilink">Romania</a> during February 2004, several relatives of Toma Petre feared that he had become a vampire.

<h2 id="theoretical-origins">Theoretical origins</h2>

<h3 id="pathology">Pathology</h3>
<p>Belief in vampires has been described as the result of people of pre-industrial societies attempting to explain the natural, but to them inexplicable, process of death and decomposition.<a href="#fn119" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref119"><sup>119</sup></a></p>
<p>People sometimes suspected vampirism when a cadaver did not look as they thought a normal corpse should when disinterred. However, rates of decomposition vary depending on temperature and soil composition, and many of the signs are little known. This has led vampire hunters to mistakenly conclude that a dead body had not decomposed at all, or, ironically, to interpret signs of decomposition as signs of continued life.<a href="#fn120" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref120"><sup>120</sup></a><a href="#fn121" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref121"><sup>121</sup></a> Corpses swell as gases from decomposition accumulate in the torso and the increased pressure forces blood to ooze from the nose and mouth. This causes the body to look &quot;plump&quot;, &quot;well-fed&quot;, and &quot;ruddy&quot;&lt;U+2014&gt;changes that are all the more striking if the person was pale or thin in life.<a href="#fn122" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref122"><sup>122</sup></a> The exuding blood gave the impression that the corpse had recently been engaging in vampiric activity.<a href="#fn123" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref123"><sup>123</sup></a> Darkening of the skin is also caused by decomposition.<a href="#fn124" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref124"><sup>124</sup></a> The staking of a swollen, decomposing body could cause the body to bleed and force the accumulated gases to escape the body. This could produce a groan-like sound when the gases moved past the vocal cords, or a sound reminiscent of <a href="flatulence" class="uri" title="wikilink">flatulence</a> when they passed through the anus.<a href="#fn125" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref125"><sup>125</sup></a></p>
<p>After death, the skin and gums lose fluids and contract, exposing the roots of the hair, nails, and teeth, even teeth that were concealed in the jaw. This can produce the illusion that the hair, nails, and teeth have grown. At a certain stage, the nails fall off and the skin peels away, as reported in the Plogojowitz case&lt;U+2014&gt;the <a href="dermis" class="uri" title="wikilink">dermis</a> and <a href="nail_(anatomy)#Parts_of_the_human_nail" title="wikilink">nail beds</a> emerging underneath were interpreted as &quot;new skin&quot; and &quot;new nails&quot;.<a href="#fn126" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref126"><sup>126</sup></a></p>
<p>In some cases in which people reported sounds emanating from a specific coffin, it was later dug up and fingernail marks were discovered on the inside from the victim trying to escape.

<h3 id="disease">Disease</h3>
<p>Folkloric vampirism has been associated with a series of deaths due to unidentifiable or mysterious illnesses, usually within the same family or the same small community.<a href="#fn130" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref130"><sup>130</sup></a> <a href="Tuberculosis" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tuberculosis</a> and the pneumonic form of <a href="bubonic_plague" title="wikilink">bubonic plague</a> were associated with breakdown of lung tissue which would cause blood to appear at the lips.&lt;ref name=&quot;&quot;Barb100&quot;&gt;Barber, <em>Vampires, Burial and Death</em>, p. 115.</ref> The idea of destroying the initial vampire and subsequent suspected victims dates back to at least the twelfth century with William of Newburgh's report of the Berwick Vampire.<a href="#fn131" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref131"><sup>131</sup></a></p>
<p>Dr Juan G&lt;U+00F3&gt;mez-Alonso, a neurologist at Xeral Hospital in <a href="Vigo" class="uri" title="wikilink">Vigo</a>, Spain, examined the possibility of a link with <a href="rabies" class="uri" title="wikilink">rabies</a> in the journal <em><a href="Neurology_(journal)" title="wikilink">Neurology</a></em>. The susceptibility to garlic and light could be due to rabies-induced hypersensitivity. The disease can also affect portions of the brain that could lead to disturbance of normal sleep patterns (thus becoming nocturnal) and <a href="hypersexuality" class="uri" title="wikilink">hypersexuality</a>. Legend once said a man was not rabid if he could look at his own reflection (an allusion to the legend that vampires have no reflection). Wolves and bats, which are often associated with vampires, can be carriers of rabies.

<h3 id="vampire-bats">Vampire bats</h3>

<p><img src="Desmodus.jpg" title="fig:A vampire bat near Peru" alt="A vampire bat near Peru" /> Although many cultures have stories about them, <a href="vampire_bat" title="wikilink">vampire bats</a> have only recently become an integral part of the traditional vampire lore.<a href="#fn138" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref138"><sup>138</sup></a> The vampire bat was revered in South American culture; <a href="Camazotz" class="uri" title="wikilink">Camazotz</a> was a bat god of the caves who lived in the bathhouse of the Underworld. Although there are no vampire bats in Europe, <a href="bat" title="wikilink">bats</a> and <a href="owl" title="wikilink">owls</a> have long been associated with the supernatural, mainly due to their nocturnal habits,<a href="#fn139" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref139"><sup>139</sup></a><a href="#fn140" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref140"><sup>140</sup></a> and in modern English <a href="heraldry" title="wikilink">heraldic</a> tradition, a bat means &quot;Awareness of the powers of darkness and chaos&quot;.<a href="#fn141" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref141"><sup>141</sup></a></p>
<p>As the three species of actual <a href="vampire_bat" title="wikilink">vampire bats</a> are all <a href="endemic_(ecology)" title="wikilink">endemic</a> to <a href="Latin_America" title="wikilink">Latin America</a>, it is unlikely that the folkloric vampire represents a distorted association with them. During the 16th century the Spanish <a href="conquistador" title="wikilink">conquistadors</a> first came into contact with vampire bats and recognized the similarity between the feeding habits of the bats and those of their legendary vampires. The bats were named after the folkloric vampire rather than vice versa; the <em>Oxford English Dictionary</em> records their folkloric use in English from 1734 and the zoological not until 1774. Although the vampire bat's bite is usually not harmful to a person, the bat has been known to actively feed on humans and large prey such as cattle and often leave the trademark, two-prong bite mark on its victim's skin.<a href="#fn142" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref142"><sup>142</sup></a></p>
<p>Though the literary <a href="Count_Dracula" title="wikilink">Dracula's</a> flying shapeshifted form was originally described as merely bird- or lizard-like, it was not long before vampire bats were adapted into vampiric accoutrements; they were used in the 1927 stage production of <em>Dracula</em> and the resulting <a href="Dracula_(1931_film)" title="wikilink">film</a>, where <a href="Bela_Lugosi" title="wikilink">Bela Lugosi</a> would transform into a bat.<a href="#fn143" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref143"><sup>143</sup></a> The bat transformation scene would again be used by <a href="Lon_Chaney,_Jr." title="wikilink">Lon Chaney Jr.</a> in 1943's <em><a href="Son_of_Dracula_(1943_film)" title="wikilink">Son of Dracula</a></em>.<a href="#fn144" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref144"><sup>144</sup></a> Ironically, vampire bats are small creatures and have never been used in the film industry; instead, the much larger <a href="Pteropus" title="wikilink">flying fox</a> bat (which is entirely herbivorous) is used in bat transformation scenes.<a href="#fn145" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref145"><sup>145</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="in-modern-fiction">In modern fiction</h2>
<p>The vampire is now a fixture in popular fiction; this stems from the series of vampiric novels released in the early 1800s, but fictional vampires certainly date back further into the late 18th century when the revenant appeared in poems such as <a href="Johann_Wolfgang_von_Goethe" title="wikilink">Johann Wolfgang von Goethe's</a> 1797 <em>Die Braut von Corinth</em> (<em>The Bride of Corinth</em>).<a href="#fn146" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref146"><sup>146</sup></a> <a href="Lord_Byron" title="wikilink">Lord Byron</a> introduced the vampire theme to Western literature in his <a href="epic_poem" title="wikilink">epic poem</a> <em><a href="The_Giaour" title="wikilink">The Giaour</a></em> (1813), but it was his personal physician <a href="John_Polidori" title="wikilink">John Polidori</a> who authored the first vampire story called <em><a href="The_Vampyre" title="wikilink">The Vampyre</a></em>.<a href="#fn147" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref147"><sup>147</sup></a> The vampire made the transition into prose works when Polidori used Byron's own wild life as the model for his undead protagonist <a href="Lord_Ruthven_(vampire)" title="wikilink">Lord Ruthven</a>. <em>The Vampyre</em> was highly successful and the most influential vampire work of the early 19th century.<a href="#fn148" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref148"><sup>148</sup></a> The continuing popularity of the vampire theme has been ascribed to a combination of two factors: the representation of sexuality&lt;U+2014&gt;something which has become more overt in the Internet age&lt;U+2014&gt;and the perennial dread of mortality.<a href="#fn149" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref149"><sup>149</sup></a></p>
<p>Over time, some attributes now regarded as integral became incorporated into the vampire's profile: fangs and vulnerability to sunlight appeared over the course of the 19th century, with Varney the Vampire and Dracula both bearing protruding teeth,<a href="#fn150" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref150"><sup>150</sup></a> and <a href="Friedrich_Wilhelm_Murnau" title="wikilink">Murnau's</a> <em><a href="Nosferatu" class="uri" title="wikilink">Nosferatu</a></em> (1922) fearing daylight.<a href="#fn151" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref151"><sup>151</sup></a> The cloak appeared in stage productions of the 1820s, with a high collar introduced by playwright Hamilton Deane to help Dracula 'vanish' on stage.<a href="#fn152" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref152"><sup>152</sup></a> Lord Ruthven and Varney were able to be healed by moonlight, although no account of this is known in traditional folklore.<a href="#fn153" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref153"><sup>153</sup></a> Implied though not often explicitly documented in folklore, <a href="immortality" class="uri" title="wikilink">immortality</a> is one attribute which features heavily in vampire film and literature.

The story was published in book form in 1847 and runs to 868 double-columned pages. It has a distinctly suspenseful style, using vivid imagery to describe the horrifying exploits of Varney.<a href="#fn155" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref155"><sup>155</sup></a> Other examples of early vampire fictions exist, such as <a href="Samuel_Taylor_Coleridge" title="wikilink">Samuel Taylor Coleridge's</a> unfinished poem <em><a href="Christabel_(poem)" title="wikilink">Christabel</a></em> and <a href="Sheridan_Le_Fanu" title="wikilink">Sheridan Le Fanu's</a> <a href="lesbian_vampire" title="wikilink">lesbian vampire</a> story &quot;<a href="Carmilla" class="uri" title="wikilink">Carmilla</a>&quot; (1871).

<p>No effort to depict vampires in popular fiction was as influential or as definitive as <a href="Bram_Stoker" title="wikilink">Bram Stoker's</a> <em><a href="Dracula" class="uri" title="wikilink">Dracula</a></em> (1897).<a href="#fn157" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref157"><sup>157</sup></a> Its portrayal of vampirism as a disease of contagious demonic possession, with its undertones of sex, blood and death, struck a chord in <a href="Victorian_era" title="wikilink">Victorian</a> Europe where <a href="tuberculosis" class="uri" title="wikilink">tuberculosis</a> and <a href="syphilis" class="uri" title="wikilink">syphilis</a> were common. The vampiric traits described in Stoker's work merged with and dominated folkloric tradition, eventually evolving into the modern fictional vampire. Drawing on past works such as <em>The Vampyre</em> and &quot;Carmilla&quot;, Stoker began to research his new book in the late 1800s, reading works such as <em>The Land Beyond the Forest</em> (1888) by <a href="Emily_Gerard" title="wikilink">Emily Gerard</a> and other books about Transylvania and vampires. A member of the <em>Order of the Golden Dawn</em> cult, he was keen to travel around Eastern Europe to learn about the folkloric vampires and the <a href="occult" class="uri" title="wikilink">occult</a>. In London, a colleague mentioned to him the story of <a href="Vlad_III_the_Impaler" title="wikilink">Vlad &lt;U+0162&gt;epe&lt;U+015F&gt;</a>, the &quot;real-life Dracula&quot;, and Stoker immediately incorporated this story into his book. The first chapter of the book was omitted when it was published in 1897, but it was released in 1914 as <em>Dracula's Guest</em>.<a href="#fn158" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref158"><sup>158</sup></a></p>
<p>The latter part of the twentieth century saw the rise of multi-volume vampire epics. The first of these was gothic romance writer <a href="Marilyn_Ross" title="wikilink">Marilyn Ross's</a> <em><a href="Barnabas_Collins" title="wikilink">Barnabas Collins</a></em> series (1966–71), loosely based on the contemporary American TV series <em><a href="Dark_Shadows" title="wikilink">Dark Shadows</a></em>. It also set the trend for seeing vampires as poetic tragic heroes rather than as the more traditional embodiment of evil. This formula was followed in novelist <a href="Anne_Rice" title="wikilink">Anne Rice's</a> highly popular and influential <em><a href="Vampire_Chronicles" title="wikilink">Vampire Chronicles</a></em> (1976–2003).<a href="#fn159" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref159"><sup>159</sup></a></p>

In addition to this film was Universal's <em><a href="Dracula_(1931_film)" title="wikilink">Dracula</a></em> (1931), starring <a href="B&lt;U+00E9&gt;la_Lugosi" title="wikilink">B&lt;U+00E9&gt;la Lugosi</a> as the count in what was the first talking film to portray Dracula.
