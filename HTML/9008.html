<p><img src="British_Museum_Lion_of_Knidos.jpg" title="fig:The Lion of Knidos on display at the British Museum" alt="The Lion of Knidos on display at the British Museum" width="350" /> The <strong>Lion of Knidos</strong> is the name for a colossal ancient Greek statue that was discovered near the ancient port of <a href="Knidos" class="uri" title="wikilink">Knidos</a>, south-west Asia Minor (now near <a href="Dat&lt;U+00E7&gt;a" class="uri" title="wikilink">Dat&lt;U+00E7&gt;a</a> in Turkey). Soon after its discovery, the statue was shipped to London where it became part of the <a href="British_Museum" title="wikilink">British Museum</a>'s collection. There is some debate about the age of the sculpture but in general scholarly opinion dates it to the 2nd century BC. Since 2000, it has been prominently displayed on a plinth under the roof of the <a href="Queen_Elizabeth_II_Great_Court" title="wikilink">Queen Elizabeth II Great Court</a>.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="description">Description</h2>
<p>This sculpture of a recumbent lion was carved from the same marble used to build the <a href="Parthenon" class="uri" title="wikilink">Parthenon</a>. It was quarried from <a href="Mount_Pentelikon" title="wikilink">Mount Pentelikon</a> near Athens. The lion is in excellent condition; only the lower jaw and front legs are missing and its eyes were probably once inlaid with glass. The statue is greater than life-size; it weighs seven tonnes and measures 2.89 metres long and 1.82 metres high.</p>
<h2 id="discovery">Discovery</h2>
<p>The Lion of Knidos was found in 1858 by the British archaeologist <a href="Richard_Popplewell_Pullan" title="wikilink">Richard Popplewell Pullan</a> as he walked the cliffs near what is now the Turkish town of Dat&lt;U+00E7&gt;a. Popplewell was three miles away from where he was helping <a href="Charles_Thomas_Newton" title="wikilink">Charles Thomas Newton</a> who was excavating the ancient Greek city of <a href="Knidos" class="uri" title="wikilink">Knidos</a>.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> The statue crowned a 20 metre high funerary monument, that had commanding views over the sea and may have once acted as a navigation aid for passing sailors. The monument may have been destroyed in an earthquake, as the statue was found lying on its side some distance from the tomb. The Knidos Lion was transported with some difficulty further down the coast, where it was loaded onto the naval ship <a href="HMS_Supply" title="wikilink">HMS Supply</a> by <a href="Robert_Murdoch_Smith" title="wikilink">Robert Murdoch Smith</a> and shipped to London.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>In 2008 the Turkish town of <a href="Dat&lt;U+00E7&gt;a" class="uri" title="wikilink">Dat&lt;U+00E7&gt;a</a> petitioned the British Ministry of Culture and Tourism for the return of the two statues known as the <a href="Lion_of_Knidos" title="wikilink">Lion of Knidos</a> and the <a href="Demeter_of_Knidos" title="wikilink">Demeter of Knidos</a>.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
