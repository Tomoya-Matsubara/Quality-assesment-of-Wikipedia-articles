<p><strong><em>Destroy to Create</em></strong> is the first full-length release from <a href="The_Flatliners" title="wikilink">The Flatliners</a>. The album was released independently to two sold out shows held at the Caledon East Recreation Centre, where it is said by many in attendance that at one of the shows, due to rental time constraints and a fire alarm the band was unable to complete their set. This venue was also undesirable to be booked again for a long period of time, due to a gazebo outside of the centre being damaged by intoxicated attendees and ended with the band having to pay for the repairs. After signing to Stomp Records, the album was subsequently rereleased on the label. The independently released version features a live recording of &quot;Pickin' at my brain&quot; that is not found on the rerelease.</p>

<li>A hidden acoustic track, What The Hell Happened To You, appears 1:58 after Do or Die ends while on the independent release it is after the track Pickin' at my Brain. The hidden track also includes a scripted argument between the band mates that quickly deteriorates and is ended with &quot;Paul, save all of this, we're putting it before...&quot;.</li>
<li>Scumpunch! is a play on the name <a href="Rum_Punch" title="wikilink">Rum Punch</a>, a book later made into the movie <a href="Jackie_Brown_(film)" title="wikilink">Jackie Brown</a> by Quentin Tarantino.
