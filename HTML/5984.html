<p>The <strong>Republican Party of Virginia</strong> (RPV) is based in <a href="Richmond,_Virginia" title="wikilink">Richmond</a> in the <a href="Virginia" title="wikilink">Commonwealth of Virginia</a>. It is affiliated with the National <a href="Republican_Party_(United_States)" title="wikilink">Republican Party</a> of the <a href="United_States" title="wikilink">United States</a>.</p>
<h2 id="organization-and-candidate-selection">Organization and candidate selection</h2>
<p>The State Party Plan<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> specifies the organization of the state party and how candidates will be selected. The 79-member State Central Committee sets the policy and plans for the party between larger State Conventions, which gather at least once every four years.</p>
<p>Candidates for elective office can be selected by (1) mass meetings, (2) party canvasses, (3) conventions, or (4) primaries. A mass meeting consists of a meeting where any participants must remain until votes are taken at the end. A party canvass or &quot;firehouse primary&quot; allows participants to arrive anytime during announced polling hours, cast a secret ballot, and then leave. A convention includes a process for selecting delegates, and then only the delegates may vote. Mass meetings, party canvasses and conventions are conducted by party officials and volunteers. Primaries are administered by the <a href="http://www.sbe.state.va.us">State Board of Elections</a> at all established polling places. Because Virginia does not have party registrations, participation in primaries are open to any register voter regardless of party. However, on <a href="June_15" title="wikilink">June 15</a>, <a href="2006" class="uri" title="wikilink">2006</a>, the Plan was amended to redefine a primary:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Primary&quot; is as defined in and subject to the Election Laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia, except to the extent that any provisions of such laws conflict with this Plan, infringe the right to freedom of association, or are otherwise invalid.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At the same time, the Plan was amended to require participants in any of the candidate selection methods to &quot;express in open meeting either orally or in writing as may be required their intent to support all [Republican] nominees for public office in the ensuing election&quot;.</p>
<p>The candidate selection process has been criticised as favoring &quot;party insiders&quot; and disfavoring moderate candidates. For example, both <a href="Jim_Gilmore" title="wikilink">Jim Gilmore</a> and the more moderate <a href="Thomas_M._Davis" title="wikilink">Thomas M. Davis</a> were seeking the 2008 Republican candidate for <a href="U.S._Senate" title="wikilink">U.S. Senate</a>. However, two weeks following the decision that the candidate will be selected at a convention instead of a primary,<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> Davis announced that he would not seek the nomination.</p>
<h3 id="open-primary-litigation">Open primary litigation</h3>
<p>Virginia does not provide for voters to register by party. Virginia law requires <a href="open_primary" title="wikilink">&quot;open&quot; primaries</a> that are not restricted based on party registration:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All persons qualified to vote... may vote at the primary. No person shall vote for the candidates of more than one party.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In 2004, the Republican Party amended the State Party Plan to attempt to restrict participation in primaries to exclude voters who had voted in a Democratic primary after <a href="March_1" title="wikilink">March 1</a>, <a href="2004" class="uri" title="wikilink">2004</a>, or in the last five years, whichever is more recent. In August 2004, <a href="Stephen_Martin_(Virginia)" title="wikilink">Stephen Martin</a>, an encumbent State Senator, designated that the Republican candidate for his seat in the November 2007 election should be selected by primary. The Republicans then sued the State Board of Elections demanding that a closed primary be held, with taxpayer funding of a mechanism to exclude voters who had participated in past Democratic primaries.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>The Federal District Court dismissed the suit on standing and ripeness grounds. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit reversed and sent the case back for a trial on its merits. The District Court then ruled that the open primary statute was constitutional on its face, but was applied in a manner which severely limited the Republicans freedom to associate under the <a href="First_Amendment" title="wikilink">First Amendment</a> of the Constitution.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> On <a href="October_1" title="wikilink">October 1</a>, <a href="2007" class="uri" title="wikilink">2007</a>, the Fourth Circuit affirmed this holding apparently ending the Virginia open-primary system as unconstitutional.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p>The Republican State Central Committee dropped plans to require voters to sign a loyalty oath before voting in the February 2008 Presidential primary. The party had proposed to require each voter to sign a pledge stating &quot;I, the undersigned, pledge that I intend to support the nominee of the Republican Party for President.&quot; However, there was no way to enforce the pledge, and the proposal caused vocal public opposition.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="richard-d.-obenshain-center">Richard D. Obenshain Center</h2>
<p>The party headquarters building is named the Richard D. Obenshain Center in memory of <a href="Richard_D._Obenshain" title="wikilink">Richard D. Obenshain</a> (1936-1978), the State Party Chairman who beginning in 1972, helped lead the party's renaissance in Virginia following 85 years of virtual control by the State's <a href="Democratic_Party_(United_States)" title="wikilink">Democratic Party</a> (since <a href="Reconstruction" class="uri" title="wikilink">Reconstruction</a> when <a href="William_Mahone" title="wikilink">William Mahone</a> and the <a href="Readjuster_Party" title="wikilink">Readjuster Party</a> coalition dominated affairs for a few years).</p>
<p>In 1978, &quot;Dick&quot; Obenshain had won the party's nomination to run for the U.S. Senate to replace retiring Senator <a href="William_Scott" title="wikilink">William Scott</a> when the 42-year old candidate and two others were killed in an <a href="airplane_crash" title="wikilink">airplane crash</a> of a twin engine aircraft on <a href="August_2" title="wikilink">August 2</a>, <a href="1978" class="uri" title="wikilink">1978</a> while attempting a night landing at the <a href="Chesterfield_County,_Virginia" title="wikilink">Chesterfield County Airport</a>.

<h2 id="policy-positions">Policy Positions</h2>
<p>While Virginia Republicans take positions on a wide variety of issues, some of the noteworthy ones include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Religion</strong> - the Party creed states, &quot;That faith in God, as recognized by our Founding Fathers, is essential to the moral fibre of the Nation.&quot; <a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> The Virginia Republicans are allied with the <a href="Religious_Right" title="wikilink">Religious Right</a>.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></li>
<li><strong>Immigration</strong> - offered legislation to limit government services, such as in-state tuition at state colleges, to undocumented residents.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a>State and local law enforcement should cooperate in enforcing immigration laws.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a><a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a><a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a></li>
<li><strong>Transportation</strong> - opposed funding transportation needs through increases in taxes and/or fees, offered <a href="Virginia_abusive_driver_fees" title="wikilink">abusive driver fees</a> as an alternative revenue source; seeks to fund projects through bonds which will be funded from future general funds.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a><a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></li>

</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Handgun control</strong> - expanded the rights to carry concealled handguns and eased the process for issuing concealled weapon permits.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a></li>
<li><strong>Judiciary</strong> - blocked judicial appointments in the 2007 legislative session.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="current-events">Current events</h2>
<p>Republicans lost control of the State Senate in the 2007 election, and narrowed their majority in the <a href="Virginia_House_of_Delegates" title="wikilink">House of Delegates</a>. The Democrats now have 21 Senate seats with one more being the subject of a possible recount. Republicans will hold a 7- or 8-seat majority in the House. <a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> In addition, Tom Davis and Jim Gilmore were vying to seek the nomination to run for the <a href="United_States_Senate" title="wikilink">United States Senate</a> to succeed <a href="John_Warner" title="wikilink">John Warner</a>, <a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> but following the withdrawal of Davis, Gilmore appears to be the inevitable candidate. Gilmore is competing for the nomination with State Del. Robert G. Marshall and Bob Berry.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a></p>
<p>Candidates from both parties are now gearing up for the 2009 Governor's race with <a href="Attorney_General" title="wikilink">Attorney General</a> <a href="Robert_McDonnell" title="wikilink">Robert McDonnell</a>, <a href="Lieutenant_Governor" title="wikilink">Lieutenant Governor</a> <a href="Bill_Bolling" title="wikilink">Bill Bolling</a>, and former Governor and former Senator <a href="George_Allen" title="wikilink">George Allen</a> apparent candidates.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> Republican candidates for the 2009 Attorney General's race include Senators <a href="Mark_Obenshain" title="wikilink">Mark D.

<p>Although it is difficult to measure total fundraising contributions because money is donated to <a href="political_action_committee" title="wikilink">political action committees</a> as well as directly to the parties, public records show that in 2007, the Virginia Republican Party has received $3,376,215 compared with $8,245,806 for the Democrats. <a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a></p>

<p>In 2006, a budget deadlock between the Republican-controlled House of Delegates and the Republican-controlled <a href="Senate_of_Virginia" title="wikilink">Senate</a> resulted in the legislative session extending far beyond its normal term as well as a special session.</p>
<p>As a part of the 2007 campaign, two Republican Delegates who are unopposed, C. Tood Gilbert and C.L. Athley Jr., are publicizing their investigation that <a href="Democratic_Party_of_Virginia" title="wikilink">Democratic</a> leaders support radical Islamic organizations. These delegates report that the <a href="Muslim_American_Society" title="wikilink">Muslim American Society</a> and the Dar Al Hijrah Islamic Center, both of which are located in <a href="Falls_Church,_Virginia" title="wikilink">Falls Church, Virginia</a>, are connected to radical Islam, even though federal officials found no such connection.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> House Speaker <a href="William_J._Howell" title="wikilink">William J. Howell</a> has not sanctioned the Gilbert-Athley report, but the Speaker's staff has been helping distribute their findings to the media. Gilbert and Athley allege that the mosque is linked to terrorism because two of the September 11, 2001 hijackers had worshipped there in the months before the attack. But the <a href="FBI" class="uri" title="wikilink">FBI</a> and the Presidential <a href="9/11_Commission" title="wikilink">9/11 Commission</a> both concluded that the mosque had no role in the attacks. In response, Delacey Skinner, Governor <a href="Tim_Kaine" title="wikilink">Tim Kaine</a>'s communications director, stated that &quot;Politics and campaigning have stooped to a new low when the governor of Virginia's efforts to reach out to people of all faiths and races is characterized as an association with terrorists.&quot;<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a></p>
<p>In 2007, the need to fund $1 billion per year for pressing transportation projects resulted in another impass between the House of Delegates and <a href="Senate_of_Virginia" title="wikilink">Senate</a>. Rather than approve additional tax increases, the final Republican plan, which was enacted into law, resulted in new fees of up to $3,000 for abusive drivers, which are assessed against Virginia residents in addition to the historic fines assessed on out-of-state drivers convicted of the same driving law violations. The Republican plan also called for issuing general obligation bonds which Democrats claim may reduce funding of non-transportation needs in future years. On <a href="23_August" title="wikilink">23 August</a> <a href="2007" class="uri" title="wikilink">2007</a>, the Republican leaders of the House and Senate responded to public opposition of the new fees by promising to moderate them in the 2008 legislative session.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> </p>

<p>State Del. Marshall (who is also a Republican U.S. Senate Candidate) challenged the Consitutionality of the 2007 transportation plan in court. On February 29, 2008, the <a href="Virginia_Supreme_Court" title="wikilink">Virginia Supreme Court</a> rule the plan to be an unconstitional delegation of the state legislature's powers to a separate transportation authority.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a></p>
<p>In anticipation of the November 2007 elections, where all of the House of Delegates and Senate seats were up for reelection, Republicans focused on <a href="illegal_immigration" title="wikilink">illegal immigration</a> and unveiled a proposal to prohibit illegal immigrants from attending public colleges and requiring sheriffs to check people's immingation status before releasing them from jail.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a></p>
<p>On <a href="December_11" title="wikilink">December 11</a>, <a href="2007" class="uri" title="wikilink">2007</a>, Republican state legislator <a href="Rob_Wittman" title="wikilink">Rob Wittman</a> was elected in the <a href="Virginia&#39;s_1st_congressional_district" title="wikilink">First Congressional District</a>, defeating Democrat <a href="Philip_Forgit" title="wikilink">Philip Forgit</a> and independent Lucky Narain.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a></p>

<p>The second step is a set of city and county caucuses to elect delegates to Congressional District and the State Conventions. The third step is a series of Congressional District conventions to be held in late April and early May 2008, where some delegates to the Republican National Convention are selected. The Republican State Convention will be held in <a href="Richmond,_Virginia" title="wikilink">Richmond, Virginia</a> on May 30-31, 2008. That convention will select the Republican Senate nominee as well as twenty-seven (27) delegates and twenty-seven (27) alternate delegates at large to the 2008 Republican National Convention.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> Because the Republican primary is winner-take-all, all National Convention delegates elected must vote for John McCain on the first ballot,<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> so the main criteria for selecting State Convention delegates will be their preference for U.S. Senate nominees.</p>
