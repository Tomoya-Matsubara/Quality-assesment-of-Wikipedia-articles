Stine</a>, initially published by <a href="Scholastic_Corporation" title="wikilink">Scholastic Publishing</a>. The stories follow child characters, who find themselves in scary situations.</p>
<p>From 1992 to 1997, 62 books were published under the <em><a href="Goosebumps_(original_series)" title="wikilink">Goosebumps</a></em> umbrella title. Various spin-off series were written by Stine: <em><a href="Goosebumps_Series_2000" title="wikilink">Goosebumps Series 2000</a></em>, <em><a href="Give_Yourself_Goosebumps" title="wikilink">Give Yourself Goosebumps</a></em>, <em><a href="List_of_Goosebumps_books#Tales_to_Give_You_Goosebumps" title="wikilink">Tales to Give You Goosebumps</a></em>, <em>Goosebumps Triple Header</em>, <em><a href="Goosebumps_HorrorLand" title="wikilink">Goosebumps HorrorLand</a></em>, and <em><a href="Goosebumps_Most_Wanted" title="wikilink">Goosebumps Most Wanted</a></em>. Another series, <em><a href="List_of_Goosebumps_books#Goosebumps_Gold" title="wikilink">Goosebumps Gold</a></em>, was never released. <em>Goosebumps</em> has spawned a <a href="Goosebumps_(TV_series)" title="wikilink">television series</a> and merchandise.</p>
<p>Since the release of its first novel, <em><a href="Welcome_to_Dead_House" title="wikilink">Welcome to Dead House</a></em>, in July 1992, the books have gained immense popularity and commercial success worldwide. As of 2012, the series has sold over 300 million books worldwide in 32 languages, and individual books in the series have been listed in many <a href="bestseller" class="uri" title="wikilink">bestseller</a> lists, including the <a href="The_New_York_Times_Best_Seller_list" title="wikilink"><em>New York Times</em> Best Seller list</a> for children. Two reviewers of the series thought the quality of the <em>Goosebumps</em> literature was not good, but others were happy the books got children excited about reading.</p>

This illustration was from the cover of Stine&#39;s autobiography, It Came from Ohio!: My Life as a Writer." alt="An illustration of R. L. Stine with some of his creations. This illustration was from the cover of Stine&#39;s autobiography, It Came from Ohio!: My Life as a Writer." /> The <em>Goosebumps</em> series falls under the children's fiction, horror and <a href="thriller_(genre)" title="wikilink">thriller</a> genres, although Stine characterizes the series as &quot;scary books that are also funny.&quot; Each book features different child characters<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> and settings. The primary <a href="protagonist" title="wikilink">protagonists</a> are middle class and can be either male or female.</p>
<p>The primary protagonists of a <em>Goosebumps</em> story are often situated in a remote location or somehow isolated from typical societal conventions. This can range anywhere from comfortable suburban areas to <a href="boarding_school" title="wikilink">boarding schools</a>, foreign villages or campsites.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> Books typically feature characters who either recently moved to a new neighborhood or are sent to stay with <a href="Kinship" title="wikilink">relatives</a>.</p>
<p>The books in the <em>Goosebumps</em> series feature similar plot structures with fictional children being involved in scary situations. The books are mostly written in first person <a href="narrative" class="uri" title="wikilink">narrative</a>, often concluding with <a href="twist_ending" title="wikilink">twist endings</a>. They contain <a href="Surrealism" title="wikilink">surreal</a> horror, with characters encountering the strange and <a href="supernatural" class="uri" title="wikilink">supernatural</a>.</p>
<p>The author has plot devices that he follows throughout his <em>Goosebumps</em> books. He does not have any death in his stories, and the children in his novels are never put into situations that would be considered too serious.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> Stine attributed the success of his books by their absence of drugs, <a href="wikt:depravity" title="wikilink">depravity</a> and <a href="violence" class="uri" title="wikilink">violence</a>.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="inspiration-and-themes">Inspiration and themes</h2>
<p>Books and characters in the series were inspired by books and films. For example, the character <a href="Slappy_the_Dummy" title="wikilink">Slappy the Dummy</a> was inspired by the literary classic <em><a href="The_Adventures_of_Pinocchio" title="wikilink">The Adventures of Pinocchio</a></em>.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> Some of Stine's ideas for the books also came from real life; Stine got the idea for the book <em><a href="The_Haunted_Mask" title="wikilink">The Haunted Mask</a></em> after his son, Matt, had a <a href="Halloween" class="uri" title="wikilink">Halloween</a> mask that he had trouble getting off.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p>Stine uses his childhood fears to help him write his books. The author said, &quot;Luckily, I have a great memory. As I write a story, I can remember what it feels like to be afraid and panicky&quot;.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> Stine states that he often thinks of a title to a novel first, then lets the title lead him to a story.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p>Two common themes in the series are children triumphing over evil and children facing horrid or frightening situations and using their own <a href="wit" class="uri" title="wikilink">wit</a> and imagination to escape them.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> Stine does not attempt to incorporate moral lessons into his novels, and says his books are &quot;strictly reading motivation&quot;.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>

<p>Following the success of Stine's <a href="Young-adult_fiction" title="wikilink">young adult</a> horror novels, the co-<a href="Entrepreneur" title="wikilink">founder</a> of <a href="Parachute_Press" title="wikilink">Parachute Press</a> (the company that developed the series),<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> Joan Waricha, persuaded him to write scary books for younger children.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> Stine says the name for the book series came to him after he saw a TV station's ad in <em><a href="TV_Guide" title="wikilink">TV Guide</a></em> that stated &quot;It&lt;U+2019&gt;s goosebumps week on Channel 11.&quot;<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> He originally signed a six-book deal with the publisher <a href="Scholastic_Corporation" title="wikilink">Scholastic</a>,<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> but went on to write 62 books in the original series, the first book being <em><a href="Welcome_to_Dead_House" title="wikilink">Welcome to Dead House</a></em>, released in July 1992. The series was originally aimed at girls, but both boys and girls enjoyed the series equally with half of Stine's fan mail being sent from boys.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
<p>The <em>Goosebumps</em> books in this series featured one main story in every book. The cover illustrations for this series were first done by <a href="Tim_Jacobus" title="wikilink">Tim Jacobus</a>.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>

<p>The books in the <em><a href="List_of_Goosebumps_books#Tales_to_Give_You_Goosebumps" title="wikilink">Tales to Give You Goosebumps</a></em> and <em>Goosebumps Triple Header</em> series were written as short story anthologies, featuring a collection of stories in each book. From 1994 to 1997, six <em>Tales to Give You Goosebumps</em> books were published. Two <em>Goosebumps Triple Header</em> books were released from 1997 to 1998, beginning with <em>Three Shocking Tales of Terror: Book 1</em>.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
<p>Fifty <em><a href="Give_Yourself_Goosebumps" title="wikilink">Give Yourself Goosebumps</a></em> books were published from 1995 to 2000, starting with <em>Escape from the Carnival of Horrors</em>. The books in this series were written as <a href="gamebook" title="wikilink">gamebooks</a>, featuring multiple endings. Many of the cover illustrations for this series were done by Mark Nagata.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
<p>Due to declining <em>Goosebumps</em> sales and increasing competition, Scholastic and Stine decided to create <em><a href="Goosebumps_Series_2000" title="wikilink">Goosebumps Series 2000</a></em>. From 1998 to 2000, 25 books in the series published, beginning with <em>Cry of the Cat</em>. The books in this series were written in a similar format and featured similar content to the original series, but Stine classified them as being &quot;much scarier.&quot;<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> The covers in this series were illustrated by Tim Jacobus.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>
<p>The books in the <em><a href="List_of_Goosebumps_books#Goosebumps_Gold" title="wikilink">Goosebumps Gold</a></em> series appeared on illustrator Tim Jacobus's website<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> and marketing sites but were never released. In this series, Stine intended to write a sequel to <em>The Haunted Mask II</em> (<em>The Haunted Mask Lives!</em>), and a sequel to <em>Welcome to Dead House</em> (<em>Happy Holidays from Dead House</em>). It was one of the two book series by Stine that was planned to be released in 2000 (the other was <em><a href="The_Nightmare_Room" title="wikilink">The Nightmare Room</a></em>).<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a></p>
<p>The series was renewed in 2008 following the release of the first book in the <em><a href="Goosebumps_HorrorLand" title="wikilink">Goosebumps HorrorLand</a></em> series, <em><a href="Revenge_of_the_Living_Dummy" title="wikilink">Revenge of the Living Dummy</a></em>, that was published on April 1, 2008.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> Before the 2008 release of <em>Revenge of the Living Dummy</em>, there had not been a <em>Goosebumps</em> book published in almost 10 years.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> Nineteen <em>Goosebumps HorrorLand</em> books were published,<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> and books in the series mainly featured two stories.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> The series continued in 2012 with new stories featuring some of the series' most memorable villains, including <a href="Slappy_the_Dummy" title="wikilink">Slappy the Dummy</a>, the Lawn Gnomes and others.

<p>In 1996, the book series accounted for almost 15% of Scholastic's annual revenue. Following the decline of <em>Goosebumps</em> sales in 1997, Scholastic's sales had dropped 40%.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> The decline in <em>Goosebumps</em> book sales had made front page news of most newspaper business sections, which Patrick Jones stated &quot;demonstrates the impact and importance of R.

<p>As of 2008, the <em>Goosebumps</em> series maintains an 82% brand awareness among children 7&lt;U+2013&gt;12.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> It is listed as the number two bestselling children's book series of all time<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> and as Scholastic's bestselling children's book series of all time.

<h3 id="reception">Reception</h3>
<p><a href="Slate_(magazine)" title="wikilink"><em>Slate</em></a>'s Katy Waldman classified a classic <em>Goosebumps</em> story as &quot;funny, icky, and just a bit menacing&quot;.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> Following the release of the first <em>Goosebumps HorrorLand</em> book, <em>Publishers Weekly</em> stated in a starred review that the new <em>Goosebumps</em> series was &quot;deliciously chilling.&quot;<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a></p>
<p>Two reviewers of the <em>Goosebumps</em> books did not feel that the books were high quality literature. <em><a href="U.S._News_&amp;_World_Report" title="wikilink">U.S. News &amp; World Report</a></em>'s Marc Silver thought the series was &quot;quite tame&quot;. He called the <em>Goosebumps</em> books &quot;<a href="subliterature" class="uri" title="wikilink">subliterature</a>&quot;, stating the plotting in the books was careless and that characters in the stories rarely grew.<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> Roderick McGillis, from the academic journal <em><a href="Bookbird:_A_Journal_of_International_Children&#39;s_Literature" title="wikilink">Bookbird</a></em>, described the books as <a href="Camp_(style)" title="wikilink">camp</a>, writing the books &quot;are so artificial, so formulaic, so predictable, so repetitive&quot;.

<p>Stine's books have a reputation for getting children excited about reading, which the writer is very proud of.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a> James Carter, writing in <em>Talking Books: Children's Authors Talk About the Craft, Creativity and Process of Writing</em>, stated &quot;regarding <em>Point Horrors</em> and <em>Goosebumps</em>, I feel that anything that children read avidly is a good thing.&quot; Librarian and writer Patrick Jones commented that &quot;[t]he real horror is a culture where kids, especially boys, don&lt;U+2018&gt;t read&lt;U+2014&gt;and Stine has done his best to stop that turn of the screw from happening in his lifetime.&quot;</p>
<h3 id="book-challenges">Book challenges</h3>
<p><em>Goosebumps</em> was listed 15th in the list of most frequently <a href="Challenge_(literature)" title="wikilink">challenged</a> books during 1990&lt;U+2013&gt;1999<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a> and 94th in the list of top banned/challenged books during 2000&lt;U+2013&gt;2009<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a> by the <a href="American_Library_Association" title="wikilink">American Library Association</a> (ALA). According to the ALA, a challenge is an attempt by a person or group to remove or restrict materials from a library or school curriculum.<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a> The series was challenged for being too frightening for young people and depicting occult or <a href="satanism" title="wikilink">satanic</a> themes.<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a> By 1997, the ALA was informed of 46 challenges, over 75% of which occurred in school libraries.

<p>In November 1996, Scholastic, the publisher of the series,<a href="#fn78" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref78"><sup>78</sup></a> and Parachute Press, the developer of the series,<a href="#fn79" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref79"><sup>79</sup></a> agreed to a new contract. Scholastic retained control of book publishing and the TV series, but gave Parachute Press merchandising rights to the series. In September 1997, following a dispute between Scholastic and Parachute Press, Scholastic accused Parachute Press of <a href="breach_of_contract" title="wikilink">breaching the contract</a>. Scholastic claimed that Parachute Press had been making merchandising deals and issuing press releases without Scholastic's required consent, and had begun withholding payments from them. In November 1997, Parachute responded by alleging Scholastic had repudiated its financial obligations, claiming Scholastic had voided its rights to publish 54 books. Parachute Press filed a lawsuit, which followed with numerous other suits and counter lawsuits<a href="#fn80" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref80"><sup>80</sup></a> over who controls certain rights to the series. In 2003, the two sides reached an agreement, with Scholastic receiving the <em>Goosebumps</em> trademark and all other rights to the series for 9.65 million dollars.<a href="#fn81" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref81"><sup>81</sup></a></p>
