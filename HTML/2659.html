<p><strong><em>The Colbert Report</em></strong> (&lt;U+2014&gt;<em>t</em> is silent in both &quot;Colbert&quot; and &quot;Report&quot;) is a <a href="Peabody_Award" title="wikilink">Peabody</a> and <a href="Emmy_Award" title="wikilink">Emmy</a> award-winning American <a href="news_satire" title="wikilink">satirical</a> <a href="late_night" title="wikilink">late night</a> <a href="television_program" title="wikilink">television program</a> that airs Monday through Thursday on <a href="Comedy_Central" title="wikilink">Comedy Central</a> in the United States and on both <a href="The_Comedy_Network" title="wikilink">The Comedy Network</a> and <a href="CTV_Television_Network" title="wikilink">CTV</a> in Canada. It stars political humorist <a href="Stephen_Colbert" title="wikilink">Stephen Colbert</a>, a former <a href="correspondent" class="uri" title="wikilink">correspondent</a> for <em><a href="The_Daily_Show" title="wikilink">The Daily Show</a></em>.</p>
<p><em>The Colbert Report</em> is a <a href="spin-off" class="uri" title="wikilink">spin-off</a> of and counterpart to <em>The Daily Show</em> that, like <em>The Daily Show</em>, critiques politics and the media. It satirizes conservative personality-driven political <a href="pundit_(expert)" title="wikilink">pundit</a> programs, particularly <a href="Fox_News" title="wikilink">Fox News</a>' <em><a href="The_O&#39;Reilly_Factor" title="wikilink">The O'Reilly Factor</a></em>.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a><a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> The show focuses on a <a href="Stephen_Colbert_(character)" title="wikilink">fictional anchorman character named Stephen Colbert</a>, played by his real-life namesake. The character, described by Colbert as a &quot;well-intentioned, poorly informed, high-status <a href="Idiot_(usage)" title="wikilink">idiot</a>&quot;, is a caricature of televised political pundits.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a><a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p><em>The Colbert Report</em> has been nominated for four <a href="Emmy" title="wikilink">Emmys</a> each in 2006, 2007 and 2008, two <a href="Television_Critics_Association" title="wikilink">Television Critics Association</a> Awards, and two <a href="Satellite_Awards" title="wikilink">Satellite Awards</a>. It has been presented as non-satirical journalism in several instances, by the <a href="Tom_DeLay" title="wikilink">Tom DeLay</a> Legal Defense Trust, and following <a href="Robert_Wexler" title="wikilink">Robert Wexler</a>'s interview on the program. <em>The Report</em> received considerable media coverage following its debut on October 17, 2005, for Colbert's popularizing of the term &quot;<a href="truthiness" class="uri" title="wikilink">truthiness</a>&quot;, which <a href="dictionary" class="uri" title="wikilink">dictionary</a> <a href="publisher" class="uri" title="wikilink">publisher</a> <a href="Merriam-Webster" class="uri" title="wikilink">Merriam-Webster</a> named its 2006 <a href="Word_of_the_Year" title="wikilink">Word of the Year</a>.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> <em>The Report</em> has also coined other <a href="neologism" title="wikilink">neologisms</a>, such as &quot;freem&quot;.</p>
<p><em>The Report</em> has had cultural influence in a number of ways. In 2006, after Colbert encouraged viewers to vote online to name a <a href="Hungary" title="wikilink">Hungarian</a> bridge after him, he won the first round of voting with 17,231,724 votes.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> <a href="Andr&lt;U+00E1&gt;s_Simonyi" title="wikilink">The Ambassador of Hungary</a> presented Mr. Colbert with a declaration certifying him as the winner of the second and final round of voting, though it was later announced that the bridge would be named the <a href="Megyeri_Bridge" title="wikilink">Megyeri Bridge</a>. (It couldn't be named after a living person.) In 2007, the Democratic Caucus chair, <a href="Rahm_Emanuel" title="wikilink">Rahm Emanuel</a>, instructed freshmen Representatives not to appear on the show's &quot;<a href="Better_Know_a_District" title="wikilink">Better Know a District</a>&quot; segment.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>

<p><img src="thecolbertgang.jpg" title="fig:Colbert on &quot;The Colbert Gang&quot;" alt="Colbert on &quot;The Colbert Gang&quot;" /> In 2005, <em><a href="The_Daily_Show" title="wikilink">The Daily Show</a></em> had won <a href="Emmy_Award" title="wikilink">Emmy Awards</a>, and Comedy Central wanted to expand the franchise.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> Producers were also looking for a way to hold on to Colbert, <em>Daily Show</em> correspondent and co-writer for six seasons, after the show's other breakout star, <a href="Steve_Carell" title="wikilink">Steve Carell</a>, left the program to pursue a successful career in film and network television. <a href="Jon_Stewart" title="wikilink">Jon Stewart</a> and <a href="Ben_Karlin" title="wikilink">Ben Karlin</a> (<em>The Daily Show</em>'s executive producer) supposedly came up with the idea for <em>The Colbert Report</em> after watching coverage of the <a href="sexual_harassment" title="wikilink">sexual harassment</a> lawsuit filed against <a href="Bill_O&#39;Reilly_(commentator)" title="wikilink">Bill O'Reilly</a>. Jon Stewart's production company, <a href="Busboy_Productions" title="wikilink">Busboy Productions</a>, developed <em>The Report</em>. Colbert, Stewart, and Karlin pitched the idea of the show (reportedly with one phrase: &quot;our version of <em><a href="The_O&#39;Reilly_Factor" title="wikilink">The O'Reilly Factor</a></em> with Stephen Colbert&quot;) to <a href="Comedy_Central" title="wikilink">Comedy Central</a> chief <a href="Doug_Herzog" title="wikilink">Doug Herzog</a>, who agreed to run the show for eight weeks without creating a pilot.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<p><em>The Colbert Report</em> first appeared in the form of three <a href="television_commercial" title="wikilink">television commercials</a> for itself which aired several times on <em>The Daily Show</em>, although the themes that form the basis for <em>The Report</em> can be seen in the reports of Colbert's correspondent character on <em>The Daily Show</em>. The show debuted October 17, 2005, with an initial contract for an eight-week run. On November 2, 2005 based on the strong <a href="Nielsen_Ratings" title="wikilink">ratings</a> for the show's first two weeks, Comedy Central and Colbert announced they had signed for an additional year, through the end of 2006.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> In 2007, co-head writer <a href="Allison_Silverman" title="wikilink">Allison Silverman</a> became an executive producer of the show.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="program-format">Program format</h3>

<p>Typically, Colbert starts each episode with teasers regarding the show's topics and guest, each headline structured to be a deliberate pun, followed by a verbal <a href="metaphor" class="uri" title="wikilink">metaphor</a> that promotes the show—for example, &quot;Go out ten yards and <a href="American_football_plays#Hook" title="wikilink">button-hook</a> to the left. I'm going to hit you with a perfect spiral of the truth. This is <em>The Colbert Report</em>.&quot; The show's opening title sequence begins with images of flag waving, eagles, Colbert striking poses and words describing Colbert flying by, some of which that have been used as The W&lt;U+00F8&gt;rd. Originally, the last word was <em>Grippy</em>, but it has changed to, among others, &quot;<em>Megamerican</em>,&quot; &quot;<em>Lincolnish</em>,&quot; &quot;<em>Superstantial</em>,&quot; &quot;<em>Freem</em>,&quot; &quot;<em>Eneagled</em>,&quot; &quot;<em>Flagaphile</em>,&quot; &quot;<em>Warrior-Poet</em>,&quot; &quot;<em>Good</em>,&quot; &quot;<em>Gutly</em>,&quot; &quot;<em>President Bush, Have A Hot Dog With Me</em>,&quot; &quot;<em>Self-Evident</em>,&quot; &quot;<em>Multi-Grain</em>,&quot; &quot;<em>Factose Intolerant</em>,&quot; &quot;<em>Colmes-Free Since 2009</em>,&quot; &quot;<em>Juice It!</em>,&quot; and currently &quot;<em>Purple-Mounted</em>.&quot; It was changed on May 4 2009 to, &quot;<em>346x</em>&quot; but returned to <em>Purple-Mounted</em> on May 5 2009. (The change to <em>346x</em> was among many hints in the episode planted by <a href="J._J._Abrams" title="wikilink">J. J. Abrams</a> about when and where Colbert will be in the <a href="Persian_Gulf" title="wikilink">Persian Gulf</a>.).&quot; The sequence ends with a computer-generated shrieking eagle swooping toward the foreground.</p>
<p>Following the opening sequence, Colbert proceeds a run-through of the day's headlines, similar to that of <em>The Daily Show</em> but with a pseudo-<a href="right-wing_politics" title="wikilink">right-wing</a> spin. The program proper then begins with Colbert addressing a specific topic. That topic will usually lead into a &quot;The W&lt;U+00F8&gt;rd&quot; segment, which juxtaposes Colbert's commentary with satirical bullet points on-screen, a parody on <em>The O'Reilly Factor</em>'s &quot;Talking Points Memo&quot;;<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> though on occasion he will conduct a short interview with someone having to do with the topic. The format of the middle segment varies, but it is normally a visual presentation or skit. Often, these skits are parts of <a href="Recurring_segments_on_The_Colbert_Report" title="wikilink">recurring segments</a>, which may include &quot;<a href="Better_Know_a_District" title="wikilink">Better Know a District</a>,&quot; in which Colbert interviews a <a href="United_States_House_of_Representatives" title="wikilink">U.S. Representative</a> from a certain district of the United States; &quot;Tip of the Hat/Wag of the Finger,&quot; in which Colbert voices his approval or disapproval of prominent people and news items; &quot;Cheating Death with Dr. Stephen T. Colbert, D.F.A.,&quot; a health segment; and &quot;The ThreatDown,&quot; in which Colbert lists the five greatest threats to America, and others.</p>
<p>Sometimes, there is a &quot;<em>Colbert Report Special Repor-t</em>&quot; (final &quot;t&quot; pronounced with special emphasis), in which Colbert devotes a section of an episode, and sometimes the entire episode to a special subject. The third segment is almost always an interview with a celebrity guest, often an author or government official.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> The interview is, unlike <em>The Daily Show</em>, conducted at a different table on the set. Viewers applaud as Colbert hammily jogs from his desk to the interview area, where his guest awaits. At times, Colbert will give <a href="high_five" title="wikilink">high fives</a> to the front row of his audience as they stand and clap. This is different from the traditional format, in which the guest enters to applause and joins the already seated host. Afterwards, Colbert ends the show by giving some parting words to the audience.</p>
<h3 id="set">Set</h3>
<p><img src="Colbert_report.jpg" title="fig:Colbert on the set of The Colbert Report. Note the three instances of the show&#39;s title." alt="Colbert on the set of The Colbert Report. Note the three instances of the show&#39;s title." width="175" /> The studio in which <em>The Colbert Report</em> is taped, located in <a href="New_York_City" title="wikilink">New York City's</a> <a href="Hell&#39;s_Kitchen,_Manhattan" title="wikilink">Hell's Kitchen</a> neighborhood, was used for <em>The Daily Show</em> until July 2005. NEP Studio 54 on <a href="54th_Street_(Manhattan)" title="wikilink">54th Street</a> is owned by <a href="NEP_Broadcasting" title="wikilink">NEP Broadcasting</a> which is New York City's largest production facility and also owns <em>The Daily Show</em> set at NEP Studio 52 two blocks south on <a href="52nd_Street_(Manhattan)" title="wikilink">52nd Street</a>.</p>
<p>The set for <em>The Colbert Report</em> is called &quot;The Eagle's Nest&quot; and reflects and facilitates Colbert's self-aggrandizing style.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> The set has two main areas: the desk, from which Colbert hosts most of the show, and the guest interview area to camera right, where his guest for the evening is interviewed. Colbert's desk is in the shape of serifed C, standing for Colbert. On one wall, above an artificial fireplace, is a portrait of Colbert; it originally showed Colbert standing in front of the same mantel with another portrait of himself. On the show's first anniversary, the portrait was replaced by one of Colbert standing in front of the mantel with the first portrait above it; the original was auctioned off at a charity event<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> and currently hangs in the <a href="Sticky_Fingers_(restaurant)" title="wikilink">Sticky Fingers</a> restaurant in Colbert's native <a href="Charleston,_South_Carolina" title="wikilink">Charleston, S.C.</a><a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> Colbert stated that the portrait will be changed every year to add another level of depth. On October 17, 2007, the portrait was removed and replaced with a new one that followed an identical pattern, but changed Colbert's placement in the foreground.<img src="Colbertportraitpicture.jpg" title="fig:The Colbert portrait hanging on display near the bathrooms of the National Portrait Gallery." alt="The Colbert portrait hanging on display near the bathrooms of the National Portrait Gallery." width="175" /></p>
<p>On January 16, 2008, the &quot;3-deep&quot; <a href="Colbert_portrait" title="wikilink">Colbert portrait</a> was placed on display &quot;right between the bathrooms near the 'America's Presidents' exhibit&quot; at the <a href="National_Portrait_Gallery_(United_States)" title="wikilink">National Portrait Gallery</a> in <a href="Washington,_DC" title="wikilink">Washington, DC</a>.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> After first being rejected by the National Museum of American History, Colbert petitioned the Smithsonian to display his portrait, who agreed to &quot;go along with the joke&quot;, though they stressed that it was only temporary. Colbert said &quot;I don't mean to brag, but as it contains three portraits, my portrait has more portraits than any other portrait in the National Portrait Gallery!&quot; The portrait was then put on display at the Smithsonian until April 13. On October 16, 2008, the 3-deep portrait was officially donated to the permanent collection of the Smithsonian's American Treasures exhibit. At the end of that show, a new 5-deep portrait was unveiled, with the newest Colbert holding his newly-won Emmy with another Emmy and a Peabody by the mantle.<img src="Colbert_Report_studio.jpg" title="fig:Outside the studio" alt="Outside the studio" width="175" /></p>
<p>The graphics used throughout the show and the studio itself are saturated with <a href="United_States_flag" title="wikilink">American flags</a>, <a href="bald_eagle" title="wikilink">bald eagles</a>, <a href="Captain_America" title="wikilink">Captain America</a>'s shield, and other patriotic imagery.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> The set contains many references to Colbert, and on the show's first episode he pointed out several examples: his name, initials and the name of the show appear on the desk's plasma screen, on the rafters above the desk, and the desk itself is shaped like a giant &quot;C&quot;.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> In an interview with <em><a href="The_A.V._Club" title="wikilink">The A.V. Club</a></em>, Colbert explained that much of the design for the set was inspired by <a href="Leonardo_da_Vinci" title="wikilink">Leonardo da Vinci</a>'s <em><a href="The_Last_Supper_(Leonardo)" title="wikilink">The Last Supper</a></em>. &quot;All the architecture of that room points at <a href="Jesus" class="uri" title="wikilink">Jesus</a>' head, the entire room is a <a href="halo_(religious_iconography)" title="wikilink">halo</a>&quot;, Colbert said. &quot;On the set, I'd like the lines of the set to converge on my head. And so if you look at the design, it all does, it all points at my head...there's a sort of <a href="solar_deity" title="wikilink">sun-god</a> burst quality about the set around me.&quot;<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> On the floor to the front stage right of his desk there is an eagle's nest, and a tape outline of where he injured his wrist, akin to those seen at murder scenes on television police procedurals.</p>
<p>For the week of April 14 through April 17, 2008, the program was taped at the <a href="Annenberg_Center_for_the_Performing_Arts" title="wikilink">Annenberg Center for the Performing Arts</a> at the <a href="University_of_Pennsylvania" title="wikilink">University of Pennsylvania</a> campus, in advance of the <a href="Democratic_Party_(United_States)" title="wikilink">Democratic Party</a> primary in that state on April 22. This was the first time the program has been taped outside its regular New York City studios.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="writers-strike">Writers' strike</h3>
<p>Production of new episodes was suspended on November 5, 2007 due to the <a href="2007-08_Writers_Guild_of_America_strike" title="wikilink">Writers Guild of America strike</a>, although a live untaped performance called <em>The Colbert Report - On Strike!</em> took place on December 3, 2007, with proceeds going towards show staffers.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> The show returned on January 7, 2008, without the writing staff. Upon the show's return, Colbert modified the pronunciation of the show's name, using hard 't's (); a similar move was made by <em>The Daily Show</em> which returned to air as <em><a href="A_Daily_Show" title="wikilink">A Daily Show</a></em>. On February 13, in honor of the end of the strike, the original names of both shows were restored.</p>
<p>During the strike, Colbert stopped performing the customary &quot;table of contents&quot; that usually precedes the opening titles, as well as other regular written segments such as The W&lt;U+00F8&gt;rd. As a member of the <a href="Writers_Guild_of_America,_East" title="wikilink">Writers Guild of America</a>, Colbert was barred from writing any material for the show himself which his writers would ordinarily write.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> As a result, Colbert conducted more guest interviews, although several people turned down invitations to cross the picket line to appear on the show, including <a href="Katrina_van_den_Heuvel" title="wikilink">Katrina van den Heuvel</a> and <a href="Naomi_Klein" title="wikilink">Naomi Klein</a>.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> At one stage, pitched as an effort to fill time on the show, Colbert lashed out at fellow late night host <a href="Conan_O&#39;Brien" title="wikilink">Conan O'Brien</a>, who had also recently returned to air without his writers, for claiming to have elevated the popularity—or &quot;made&quot;—presidential candidate <a href="Mike_Huckabee" title="wikilink">Mike Huckabee</a>, which Colbert's character had frequently claimed credit for in the past. In response, <a href="Jon_Stewart" title="wikilink">Jon Stewart</a>, Colbert's former <em>Daily Show</em> colleague, claimed that he had introduced O'Brien to the public on <a href="MTV" class="uri" title="wikilink">MTV</a>'s <em><a href="The_Jon_Stewart_Show" title="wikilink">The Jon Stewart Show</a></em>, and thus, by his logic, <em>Stewart</em> was responsible for Huckabee's success. This sparked a briefly recurring <a href="Who_Made_Huckabee?" title="wikilink">mock feud</a> between Colbert, O'Brien, and Stewart&lt;U+2014&gt;during which they appeared on each other's shows&lt;U+2014&gt;which culminated in a three-way brawl on <em><a href="Late_Night_with_Conan_O&#39;Brien" title="wikilink">Late Night with Conan O'Brien</a></em> on February 4, 2008.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a></p>

<p><img src="Colbertreport.jpg" title="fig:Stephen Colbert as the fictional Stephen Colbert" alt="Stephen Colbert as the fictional Stephen Colbert" width="150" />  The Stephen Colbert character is a fictional character portrayed by comedian and actor Stephen Colbert. The character is a caricature of news pundits such as <a href="Stone_Phillips" title="wikilink">Stone Phillips</a>, <a href="Bill_O&#39;Reilly_(commentator)" title="wikilink">Bill O'Reilly</a>, <a href="Sean_Hannity" title="wikilink">Sean Hannity</a>, and <a href="Geraldo_Rivera" title="wikilink">Geraldo Rivera</a>, whose shows focus on &quot;bluster and personality&quot;.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a><a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> Colbert's character, a &quot;well-intentioned, poorly informed, high-status idiot&quot;, is <a href="right-wing" class="uri" title="wikilink">right-wing</a>, <a href="egomania" title="wikilink">egomaniacal</a>, fact-averse (&quot;factose intolerant&quot;), God-fearing, and super-<a href="patriotic" class="uri" title="wikilink">patriotic</a>. He claims to be an <a href="independent_(voter)" title="wikilink">independent</a> who is often mistaken for a <a href="Republican_Party_(United_States)" title="wikilink">Republican</a>, but uniformly despises <a href="Modern_American_liberalism" title="wikilink">liberals</a> and generally agrees with the actions and decisions of <a href="George_W._Bush" title="wikilink">George W.

Bush: great President, or the <em>greatest</em> President?&quot;<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a></p>
<p>The character's self-aggrandizing style includes frequent promotion of an extensive range of fictional merchandising and products, including perfumes, <a href="science_fiction" title="wikilink">sci-fi</a> novels, medications, his own &quot;<a href="semen" title="wikilink">man seed</a>&quot;, and other products, all of which are either produced or endorsed by Colbert.

<p>Colbert's character also holds a recurring grudge against everything <a href="France" title="wikilink">French</a>, including their <a href="language" class="uri" title="wikilink">language</a>. Ironically, he repeatedly pronounces the &quot;Report&quot; in &quot;The Colbert Report&quot; with a silent T in the traditional French accent. This faux-French way of pronouncing &quot;Report&quot; has started a trend amongst other <a href="American_journalists" title="wikilink">American journalists</a>, such as <a href="Bobby_Dunbar" title="wikilink">Bobby Dunbar</a>, of <a href="The_Colorado_Rap_Report" title="wikilink">The Colorado Rap Report</a>.

<p>Colbert's character has been described as a &quot;caustic right-wing bully&quot;.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> On the interview segment of the show, Colbert frequently attempts to nail his guest by using various <a href="rhetorical_device" title="wikilink">rhetorical devices</a>, and often <a href="logical_fallacy" title="wikilink">logical fallacies</a>, to prove them wrong.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> Despite his bluster, Colbert's character suffers from <a href="wikt:arctophobia" title="wikilink">arctophobia</a>, the <a href="phobia" title="wikilink">fear</a> of <a href="bear" title="wikilink">bears</a>, which he refers to as &quot;giant, marauding, godless killing machines&quot;.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> This bear phobia was inspired by Colbert's real-life fear of bears as a child.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> Colbert refers to Bill O'Reilly as &quot;Papa Bear&quot;, a title with a double meaning, considering Colbert's fear of bears.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> Colbert displays fear and suspicion of nearly any animal and is quick to declare they are &quot;training&quot; to attack humanity.

Colbert said that, &quot;I don't trust books, they're all fact, no heart. And that's exactly what's pulling our country apart today. Let's face it folks, we are a divided nation&lt;U+2026&gt;between those who think with their head and those who know with their heart.&quot;<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> In December 2005, <em>The New York Times</em> selected <em>truthiness</em> as one of nine words that captured the <a href="zeitgeist" class="uri" title="wikilink">zeitgeist</a> of the year, and in January 2006, the <a href="American_Dialect_Society" title="wikilink">American Dialect Society</a> announced that <em>truthiness</em> was selected as its 2005 Word of the Year.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a></p>

<p>The Stephen Colbert character and <em>The Colbert Report</em> are generally parodies of <a href="Bill_O&#39;Reilly_(commentator)" title="wikilink">Bill O'Reilly</a> and <em><a href="The_O&#39;Reilly_Factor" title="wikilink">The O'Reilly Factor</a></em> respectively. New episodes of <em>The Colbert Report</em> are scheduled in the same time slot as rebroadcasts of <em>The O'Reilly Factor</em>, while <em>Colbert</em> rebroadcasts are scheduled during new <em>O'Reilly</em> shows.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a> When O'Reilly appeared on <em>The Daily Show</em> before the second episode of <em>The Colbert Report</em> aired, he commented, &quot;Before we get started, somebody told me walking in here, you got some French guy on after you making fun of me?&quot;, and made several references in the following interview to 'the French Guy'.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a><a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a> In a subsequent <em><a href="Newsweek" class="uri" title="wikilink">Newsweek</a></em> interview, O'Reilly said that he &quot;feels it's a compliment&quot; to have Colbert parody him because Colbert &quot;isn't mean-spirited&quot; and does not &quot;use [his] platform to injure people&quot;. Later, Colbert replied on-air, &quot;I like you too. In fact, if it wasn't for you, this show wouldn't exist.&quot;<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a></p>
<p><em>The Colbert Report</em> features a commentary segment called &quot;The W&lt;U+00F8&gt;rd&quot;, similar to O'Reilly's &quot;Talking Points Memo&quot;. Like the Memo, The W&lt;U+00F8&gt;rd features the commentator asserting a political point of view with a text screen graphic next to him. However, while O'Reilly's text serves to emphasize his points, Colbert's text generally serves as an ironic counterpoint to his character's position. Other segments that can be juxtaposed with <em><a href="The_O&#39;Reilly_Factor" title="wikilink">The O'Reilly Factor</a></em> are The Colbert Report's <em>Inbox</em> (compared to O'Reilly's &quot;Factor Mail&quot;); <em>Stephen Colbert's Balls for Kidz</em> which, unlike The Factor's &quot;Children at Risk&quot;, tends to portray messages and lessons typically considered unsuitable for children; and <em>That's The Craziest F#?king Thing I've Ever Heard</em>, which is comparable to O'Reilly's &quot;The Most Ridiculous Item of the Day&quot;. Additionally, Colbert parodies O'Reilly's references to his program as the &quot;no spin zone&quot; by inviting viewers of his show to &quot;take a spin in the no fact zone&quot;.<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a> O'Reilly and Colbert each appeared as a guest on the other's show on January 18, 2007.

He later sent over a replacement microwave, emblazoned with <em>The Colbert Report</em> logo.)</p>

In response, The Decemberists challenged Colbert to a <a href="guitar" class="uri" title="wikilink">guitar</a> solo challenge.<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a> For a few weeks, the upcoming contest, which Colbert titled &quot;Rock and Awe: Countdown to Guitarmageddon&quot; (&quot;The I-Rock War: Cut and Strum&quot; and &quot;<a href="The_Iceman_Cometh" title="wikilink">The Axeman Cometh</a>: <a href="Mourning_Becomes_Electra" title="wikilink">Mourning Becomes Electric</a>&quot; were announced as alternate titles; Colbert added that he would find and fire the English major on his staff who created the latter title), became a focus of the show. On December 20, 2006, <a href="Chris_Funk" title="wikilink">Chris Funk</a>, lead guitarist for The Decemberists, came on the show for the guitar solo challenge. Once Funk finished playing, Colbert arrived on stage with a five-necked guitar belonging to <a href="Rick_Nielsen" title="wikilink">Rick Nielsen</a> of <a href="Cheap_Trick" title="wikilink">Cheap Trick</a>. Colbert played two notes, pretended to cut his hand, and insisted that he could no longer play, so <a href="Peter_Frampton" title="wikilink">Peter Frampton</a> played a solo in Colbert's place.

DeCurtis voted for the Colbert/Frampton team, Anderson voted for Funk, and Spitzer withdrew himself from judging as Colbert tried to <a href="bribe" class="uri" title="wikilink">bribe</a> him during the commercial break. The deciding vote was given to <a href="Henry_Kissinger" title="wikilink">Henry Kissinger</a>, who had briefly appeared earlier in the show. Kissinger said that the American people had won, at which point Colbert declared himself the winner.<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a> As a prize, Colbert received <em><a href="The_Crane_Wife" title="wikilink">The Crane Wife</a></em>, The Decemberists' new album, saying &quot;The Crane Wife by the Decemberists?

<p>On June 12, 2008, Stephen announced his third green screen challenge, &quot;Stephen Colbert's Make McCain Exciting Challenge!&quot;, in which he invited viewers to replace the <a href="chroma_key" title="wikilink">green screen</a> behind <a href="John_McCain" title="wikilink">John McCain</a> during one of his speeches with something more exciting.

<p>On September 5, 2008, Colbert issued a follow up McCain green screen challenge. He challenged his viewers to alter the footage of McCain's acceptance speech, while Colbert himself took a one week hiatus.</p>
<h3 id="wrist-violence-and-fictional-addiction">Wrist violence and fictional addiction</h3>
<p>On July 26, 2007, Colbert broke his left wrist while performing his warm-up for the show.<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a> Following the accident Colbert launched a new section of the show entitled &quot;Wrist Watch&quot;, featuring news stories about wrists during which the character attacks what he sees as <a href="Hollywood" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hollywood</a>'s glamorization of &quot;wrist violence&quot;.<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a> On August 8, Colbert debuted the &quot;Wriststrong&quot; <a href="wrist_band" title="wikilink">wrist band</a>, based on <a href="Lance_Armstrong" title="wikilink">Lance Armstrong</a>'s &quot;<a href="Livestrong_wristband" title="wikilink">Livestrong</a>&quot; wrist band, in a hope to increase wrist awareness.<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a> The wristbands were made available for purchase online and Colbert ordered those wearing the bracelets to give them to anyone they meet who is more famous than themselves.

<h3 id="recurring-characters">Recurring characters</h3>

<p>While the show is largely dominated by Colbert, there are a number of recurring characters who appear periodically. Colbert will frequently address the show's director, Jimmy&lt;U+2014&gt;a reference to real-life <em>Colbert Report</em> director Jim Hoskinson&lt;U+2014&gt;and will sometimes converse with him. On the rare occasions Jimmy has appeared on screen, he has been portrayed by staff writer <a href="Peter_Gwinn" title="wikilink">Peter Gwinn</a>. Building manager Tad, portrayed by <a href="Paul_Dinello" title="wikilink">Paul Dinello</a>, has appeared on the show multiple times to host special segments.

Colbert himself has portrayed his character's Cuban <a href="alter_ego" title="wikilink">alter ego</a>, Esteban Colberto; and his Chinese alter ego, Ching Chong Ding Dong.</p>
<p>Early in the show's run, Stephen occasionally encountered Russ Lieber, a liberal media personality character portrayed by <a href="David_Cross" title="wikilink">David Cross</a>. <a href="Tim_Meadows" title="wikilink">Tim Meadows</a> has also appeared on the show as P.K.

<p>An inanimate character was created in response to <a href="Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States" title="wikilink">Supreme Court</a> ruling to lift the Washington, D.C. gun ban. Sweetness is a black <a href="pistol" class="uri" title="wikilink">pistol</a> that Colbert claims he can hear talking to him. He will often converse with Sweetness by holding the gun up to his ear and then relaying what it has supposedly said.</p>
<p>Colbert has also voiced <a href="Wilford_Brimley" title="wikilink">Wilford Brimley</a> in false phone conversations. Gorlock, Colbert's alien financial adviser, is another recurring character mentioned on the show.</p>
<h2 id="reception">Reception</h2>
<p><em>The Colbert Report</em> drew an unusual amount of media attention prior to its premiere.

<p><em>The Colbert Report</em> drew 1.13 million viewers for its premiere episode, 47 percent greater than the average for that time slot over the previous four weeks, and 98 percent of the viewership of <em>The Daily Show</em>, which has Comedy Central's second-largest viewership.<a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a> Averaged over its opening week, <em>The Report</em> had 1.2 million viewers per episode, more than double the average for the same time the previous year, when the time slot was occupied by <em><a href="Too_Late_with_Adam_Carolla" title="wikilink">Too Late with Adam Carolla</a></em>.

Three different interviews with DeLay on different networks were spliced for humorous effect, and Colbert ended the &quot;interview&quot; by saying &quot;I do hope you enjoyed my manipulation of your words.&quot; DeLay has since appeared as a guest on the program.</p>
