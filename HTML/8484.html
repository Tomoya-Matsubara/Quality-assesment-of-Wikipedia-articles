<p><strong>Yantaringa railway station</strong> was located about 41km by rail from <a href="Adelaide_Railway_Station" title="wikilink">Adelaide Railway Station</a>. Yantaringa was actually a passing siding on the <a href="Melbourne-Adelaide_railway" title="wikilink">Melbourne-Adelaide railway</a> in the Adelaide Hills suburb of <a href="Verdun,_South_Australia" title="wikilink">Verdun</a>, and is a few hundred metres to the east of the Yantaringa Tunnel, which may explain how it was named. It was unknown when the station, or siding opened, possibly in the late 1800's (probably c1883), In 1925 the station was a stopping place for rail motors. <a href="http://www.wilsonvineyard.com.au/the_trains/wn_1925.html" class="uri">http://www.wilsonvineyard.com.au/the_trains/wn_1925.html</a>  The patronage at Yantaringa was low due to it's location. The station/siding probably closed in the 1960's when country passenger services ceased.</p>
