<p><img src="Miller_V.jpg" title="fig:Keith Miller in 1946" alt="Keith Miller in 1946" /> The <strong>early life of <a href="Keith_Miller" title="wikilink">Keith Miller</a></strong>, an <a href="Australia" title="wikilink">Australian</a> <a href="Test_cricket" title="wikilink">Test cricketer</a> and <a href="Australian_rules_football" title="wikilink">Australian rules footballer</a>, spans the period from his birth on 28 November 1919 until 20 August 1940, when he joined the <a href="Australian_Army_Reserve" title="wikilink">Militia</a> (army reserve) during the <a href="Second_World_War" title="wikilink">Second World War</a>. Miller's early life was dominated by his interest in sport. The youngest of four children of Scottish descent, Miller joined his siblings in being inculcated with a love of sport by his father, playing football in winter and cricket in summer. Miller's father emphasised the importance of technique over power; Miller needed the former as he was of small stature in his childhood and could not rely on brute strength. Due to his size, Miller yearned to be a <a href="horse_racing" title="wikilink">horse racing</a> jockey.</p>
<p>Miller received his secondary education at the academically selective <a href="Melbourne_High_School" title="wikilink">Melbourne High School</a>, where his mathematics teacher was the then Australian cricket captain <a href="Bill_Woodfull" title="wikilink">Bill Woodfull</a>. Miller neglected his studies and was academically poor, but he excelled at sports. He made the school's First XI cricket team at the age of 14 and gained attention for his technical and defensive ability, which was compared to that of Woodfull. He was rejected by the <a href="St_Kilda_Cricket_Club" title="wikilink">St Kilda Cricket Club</a> so he signed up for <a href="Casey-South_Melbourne_Cricket_Club" title="wikilink">South Melbourne</a> in <a href="Victorian_Premier_Cricket" title="wikilink">district cricket</a>, making his debut at the start of the 1935–36 season, still only 162 cm tall. He went on score a rearguard 61 in a low-scoring match against Woodfull's <a href="Carlton_Cricket_Club" title="wikilink">Carlton</a> team, prompting Woodfull to award him a silver eggcup during maths class. It remained one of his most treasured possessions.</p>
<p>In the following year, Miller grew 28 cm (11 in) and began to play cricket and football with more power. Leaving school at the end of year ten, he played cricket for the Victorian Colts for two seasons, before breaking through for his first-class debut late in the 1937–38 season. He played sporadically until making his <a href="Sheffield_Shield" title="wikilink">Sheffield Shield</a> debut during the 1939–40 season and scoring his maiden <a href="century_(cricket)" title="wikilink">century</a>. During this time, Miller played exclusively as a batsman. Miller's football career also took off. He played for the <a href="Brighton_Football_Club" title="wikilink">Brighton Football Club</a> in the <a href="Victorian_Football_Association" title="wikilink">Victorian Football Association</a> for three years starting in 1937, mainly as a defender. At the start of his fourth season, he restricted <a href="Bob_Pratt" title="wikilink">Bob Pratt</a>, regarded as the best forward of the time, to one goal, and was promptly signed by the <a href="St_Kilda_Saints" title="wikilink">St Kilda Saints</a> to play in the leading <a href="Australian_Football_League" title="wikilink">Victorian Football League</a> in 1940, where the Saints' came second to last.</p>

<p>Born in the western <a href="Melbourne" class="uri" title="wikilink">Melbourne</a> suburb of <a href="Sunshine,_Victoria" title="wikilink">Sunshine</a> on 28 November 1919, Keith Ross Miller was the youngest of Leslie (Les Sr) and Edith (Edie) Miller's four children.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> Miller had two elder brothers and an sister. Gladys was 12 when Miller was born, while Les Jr and Ray were nine and seven respectively.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> He was named after the Australian pioneer aviator brothers <a href="Ross_Macpherson_Smith" title="wikilink">Ross</a> and <a href="Keith_Macpherson_Smith" title="wikilink">Keith Smith</a>, who were half-way through their historic <a href="England_to_Australia_flight" title="wikilink">flight from England to Australia</a> at the time Miller was born.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a><a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> Miller's two Christian names reflected his <a href="Scottish_people" title="wikilink">Scottish</a> heritage; his father's family originated from the dock area of <a href="Edinburgh" class="uri" title="wikilink">Edinburgh</a> and <a href="Dundee" class="uri" title="wikilink">Dundee</a>.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> Miller's paternal grandfather had come to Australia in April 1849.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> The family lived in a one-level terrace house in Sunshine, which at the time was a separate town of 900 people, eleven kilometres west of Melbourne. The town was dominated by the farm machinery maker <a href="H._V._McKay" title="wikilink">H. V. McKay</a>. Miller's father was originally a teacher in <a href="Warracknabeal" class="uri" title="wikilink">Warracknabeal</a> in rural Victoria, before working for McKay in <a href="Ballarat" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ballarat</a> until a transfer brought him to Sunshine.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="early-schooling">Early schooling</h2>
<p>Sunshine offered open fields, and the three Miller boys quickly took a liking to sport in their childhood, playing <a href="Australian_rules_football" title="wikilink">Australian rules football</a> in winter and <a href="cricket" class="uri" title="wikilink">cricket</a> in summer. Their father had been a player for <a href="Warracknabeal" class="uri" title="wikilink">Warracknabeal</a>, winning a premiership in the local league in 1900. Les taught the boys to play with a side-on stance and underlined the importance of correct batting technique.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> He reminded his sons to use a high leading elbow.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> They were taught to rely on a solid defence, concentration, and self-control in the mould of the leading Victorian and Australian Test batsman of the era, <a href="Bill_Ponsford" title="wikilink">Bill Ponsford</a>.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> Miller began his schooling in Sunshine, where he quickly became known for his diminutive height, being one of the smallest children in the school.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> At the age of seven, Miller's family moved to the inner-eastern middle-class Melbourne suburb of <a href="Elsternwick,_Victoria" title="wikilink">Elsternwick</a>, where his parents had purchased a two-storey house with a spacious garden for the children to play sport. By this time his elder brothers had given him the derisive nickname <em>Weedy</em>.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> Miller's small size and his age deficit to his brothers meant that he conceded a strength advantage in backyard cricket matches. This forced him to develop his technique rather than rely on power, which held him in good stead for his future playing. Whenever Miller managed to dismiss his brothers to earn himself some batting time, he typically played with a straight bat in a watchful manner. Miller and his friends would loiter outside Ponsford's home, just 400 m (1310 ft) away, in the hope of catching a glimpse of their hero.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> Like Miller in the backyard, Ponsford was known for his powers of concentration, having scored two quadruple centuries in first-class cricket.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> Miller often practised for hours by himself, putting a tennis ball inside a stocking before suspending it from a clothes line and hitting it back and forth.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
<p>A small child, Miller's major sporting aspiration was to be a <a href="jockey" class="uri" title="wikilink">jockey</a>; he also played cricket and Australian football.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> At the age of 12, he played for an under-15 Victorian schoolboys cricket team captained by <a href="Merv_Harvey" title="wikilink">Merv Harvey</a>, which played in <a href="Queensland" class="uri" title="wikilink">Queensland</a>.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> At the time, he stood only  and wielded a sawn-off bat.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> His shots did not go a long way, but he impressed observers with the manner in which he moved his feet and stroked the ball.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> Miller's small stature in a contact sport such as football forced him to rely on physical courage, something for which he was known.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> However, his lack of growth in childhood made him turn to horseracing. <a href="Caulfield_Racecourse" title="wikilink">Caulfield Racecourse</a> was only a short ways away from the family home, and Miller spent many early mornings watching the trainers and jockeys go about their routines. Miller eventually persuaded his father to let him take horseriding lessons.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> Aside from being attracted to the culture of racing, Miller felt that as he appeared destined to be a small person, a successful career as a jockey was more likely than cricket or football.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a></p>

This disappointed Woodfull, a disciplined man who invoked the school motto, which meant <em>Honour the Work</em> and exhorted his students to work hard as Australia was attempting to emerge from the depths of the <a href="Great_Depression" title="wikilink">Great Depression</a>.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> Despite being Australia's captain, Woodfull refused to involve himself in coaching the school's cricket teams, feeling that it would intrude on the responsibilities of the sports teachers. Despite this, Woodfull watched the students at cricket training and quickly noticed Miller's skills.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> Miller, aged 14 and still under , was selected in the school's First XI. With his pads flapping against his stomach and sporting a sawn-down bat, Miller batted at No. 6 and scored 44 on his senior debut, and although his lack of power was obvious, his control and solidity prompted the spectators to call him <em>the Unbowlable</em>, the same nickname which was accorded to the similarly strong defensive style of Woodfull. Melbourne went on to win the match.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> Miller impressed his captain <a href="Keith_Truscott" title="wikilink">Keith Truscott</a>, who fought for his selection and took him under his wing.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> Truscott was later to become an ace fighter pilot in the <a href="Royal_Australian_Air_Force" title="wikilink">Royal Australian Air Force</a>, and Miller would follow him into to air force as well. Truscott's social influence also compounded the distractions from Miller's study. He failed all eight of his subjects at the end of 1934, with an average mark of 25%, and was the class dunce. He scored zero in his final exam for Woodfull's geometry class.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> As a result, Miller was forced to repeat year 9.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a></p>

He was given out caught by Bradman from Garth Burton, after a disputed catch in which he asked the umpires if he had hit a <a href="bump_ball" title="wikilink">bump ball</a>.<a href="#fn81" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref81"><sup>81</sup></a><a href="#fn82" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref82"><sup>82</sup></a> Nevertheless, Bradman praised Miller's innings.<a href="#fn83" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref83"><sup>83</sup></a> Apart from the century, Miller had an average season, making 37, one and 24 in his remaining innings to end with 298 runs at 29.80.<a href="#fn84" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref84"><sup>84</sup></a> He did not bowl during the season.<a href="#fn85" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref85"><sup>85</sup></a></p>

<p>In 1940, Miller started his fourth season in the VFA. In a match against <a href="Coburg_Tigers" title="wikilink">Coburg</a>, regarded as one of the strongest teams in the competition, he was assigned to man the greatest forward of the era, <a href="Bob_Pratt" title="wikilink">Bob Pratt</a>.<a href="#fn86" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref86"><sup>86</sup></a> Pratt had scored 678 goals in ten seasons for <a href="Sydney_Swans" title="wikilink">South Melbourne</a> in the <a href="Australian_Football_League" title="wikilink">Victorian Football League</a> (VFL), the top tier of football, and had scored more than 100 goals in each of the last three seasons.<a href="#fn87" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref87"><sup>87</sup></a> Miller managed to restrict Pratt to one goal for the match and was named as the best on ground. In the third quarter of the match, Miller restricted him to two marks, and in the fourth quarter, he prevented Pratt from getting a single kick. Scouts from the VFL club <a href="St_Kilda_Football_Club" title="wikilink">St Kilda</a> signed Miller on the spot.<a href="#fn88" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref88"><sup>88</sup></a> Upon Miller's signing, <em>The Age</em> opined that he &quot;is one of the most promising players ever to enter league ranks, and can be played anywhere in defence. It was he who kept Bob Pratt to one goal in last week's Association match&quot;.<a href="#fn89" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref89"><sup>89</sup></a></p>
<p>At the time, <a href="World_War_II" title="wikilink">World War II</a> had broken out and by mid-1940, <a href="France" class="uri" title="wikilink">France</a>, <a href="Belgium" class="uri" title="wikilink">Belgium</a> and <a href="The_Netherlands" title="wikilink">The Netherlands</a> had fallen to <a href="Nazi_Germany" title="wikilink">Nazi Germany</a>. Australia had declared war on Germany and Miller wanted to join the military, but St Kilda told him that if he was deployed outside Victoria, his career would be in jeopardy. As a result, Miller postponed his enlistment until the end of the season.<a href="#fn90" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref90"><sup>90</sup></a></p>
<p>Playing as a defender, Miller debuted for St Kilda in their fifth round home game against <a href="Carlton_Blues" title="wikilink">Carlton</a>, at the <a href="Junction_Oval" title="wikilink">Junction Oval</a> on 25 May, playing on the half-back flank. Immediately upon the start of the game, his opponent <a href="Ron_Cooper_(Australian_footballer)" title="wikilink">Ron Cooper</a> <a href="king_hit" title="wikilink">king hit</a> him, resulting in concussion. Miller said of the experience, &quot;I learnt more in a second or two than I would have in a year&quot;.<a href="#fn91" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref91"><sup>91</sup></a><a href="#fn92" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref92"><sup>92</sup></a><a href="#fn93" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref93"><sup>93</sup></a> When St Kilda next met Carlton in the return match at <a href="Princes_Park" title="wikilink">Princes Park</a> on 17 August,<a href="#fn94" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref94"><sup>94</sup></a> Miller shoulder bumped Cooper in the first minute of the match, forcing his opponent to leave the field.<a href="#fn95" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref95"><sup>95</sup></a> In a match against <a href="Richmond_Tigers" title="wikilink">Richmond</a>, Miller was targeted by its renowned enforcer <a href="Jack_Dyer" title="wikilink">Jack Dyer</a>, known as <em>Captain Blood</em>. However, Dyer slipped and missed.<a href="#fn96" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref96"><sup>96</sup></a> In one match, Miller was reported to showing dissent to a goal umpire, but was let off without punishment. St Kilda came second to last, so they did not make the playoffs.<a href="#fn97" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref97"><sup>97</sup></a><a href="#fn98" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref98"><sup>98</sup></a></p>
