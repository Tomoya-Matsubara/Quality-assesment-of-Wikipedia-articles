<p><strong>Sikhism</strong> (<a href="International_Phonetic_Alphabet" title="wikilink">IPA</a>:  or ; , <em></em>, IPA: ) is a <a href="religion" class="uri" title="wikilink">religion</a> that began in <a href="16th_century" title="wikilink">sixteenth century</a> <a href="Northern_India" title="wikilink">Northern India</a> with the teachings of <a href="Guru_Nanak_Dev" title="wikilink">Nanak</a> and nine successive human <a href="Sikh_Gurus" title="wikilink">gurus</a>. This system of religious <a href="philosophy" class="uri" title="wikilink">philosophy</a> and expression has been traditionally known as the <a href="Gurmat" class="uri" title="wikilink">Gurmat</a> (literally <em>the teachings of the gurus</em>) or the Sikh Dharma. <em>Sikhism</em> comes from the word <em>Sikh</em>, which in turn comes from the <a href="Sanskrit" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sanskrit</a> root <em></em> meaning &quot;disciple&quot; or &quot;learner&quot;, or <em></em> meaning &quot;instruction.&quot;<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a><a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> Sikhism is the <a href="Major_religious_groups" title="wikilink">fifth-largest</a> organised religion in the world.</p>
<p>The principal belief in Sikhism is faith in <em><a href="Waheguru" title="wikilink">V&lt;U+0101&gt;higur&lt;U+016B&gt;</a></em>&lt;U+2014&gt;represented using the sacred symbol of <em></em>. Sikhism advocates the pursuit of salvation through disciplined, personal meditation on the name and message of God. The followers of Sikhism are ordained to follow the teachings of the ten <a href="The_Sikh_Gurus" title="wikilink">Sikh gurus</a>, or enlightened leaders, as well as the holy scripture&lt;U+2014&gt;the <em><a href="Guru_Granth_Sahib" title="wikilink">Gur&lt;U+016B&gt; Granth S&lt;U+0101&gt;hib</a></em>&lt;U+2014&gt;which includes the selected works of many authors from diverse socioeconomic and religious backgrounds. The text was decreed by <a href="Guru_Gobind_Singh" title="wikilink">Gobind Singh</a>, the tenth guru, as the final guru of the <a href="Khalsa_Panth" title="wikilink">Khalsa Panth</a>. Sikhism's traditions and teachings are distinctly associated with the history, society and culture of the <a href="Punjab_region" title="wikilink">Punjab</a>.</p>
<p>Adherents of Sikhism are known as <a href="Sikh" title="wikilink">Sikhs</a> (<em>students</em> or <em>disciples</em>) and number over 23 million across the world. However, most Sikhs live in the <a href="Punjab_(India)" title="wikilink">state of Punjab</a> in <a href="India" class="uri" title="wikilink">India</a>; prior to <a href="Partition_of_India" title="wikilink">partition</a>, millions of Sikhs lived in what is now the <a href="Punjab_(Pakistan)" title="wikilink">Punjab province</a> of <a href="Pakistan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Pakistan</a>.</p>

Especially important to the connection with Sikhism were the teachings of some of the saints such as Ravidas and <a href="Kabir" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kabir</a>. Sikhism is also inspired by the emphasis on devotion to God in the traditions of <a href="Vaishnavism" class="uri" title="wikilink">Vaishnavism</a>, especially through the <em><a href="Bhakti" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bhakti</a></em> movement, as well as influences of <a href="Sufism" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sufism</a>. However, Nanak's teachings diverge significantly from Vaishnavism in their rejection of idol worship, the doctrine of <a href="Avatara" title="wikilink">divine incarnations</a> and a strict emphasis on inward devotion; Sikhism is professed to be a more difficult personal pursuit than <em><a href="Bhakti" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bhakti</a></em>.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> The evolution of Nanak's thoughts on the basis of his own experiences and study have also given Sikhism a distinctly unique feature.</p>
<p>Scholars have presented Sikhism as both a distinct faith and a <a href="syncretic" class="uri" title="wikilink">syncretic</a> religion which combines some elements of <a href="Hinduism" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hinduism</a> and <a href="Islam" class="uri" title="wikilink">Islam</a>. Sikhs maintain that their religion was directly revealed by God, and many of them consider the notion that Sikhism is a syncretic religion to be offensive.</p>
<h3 id="god">God</h3>
<p>In Sikhism, God &lt;U+2013&gt; termed <em><a href="Waheguru" title="wikilink">V&lt;U+0101&gt;higur&lt;U+016B&gt;</a></em> &lt;U+2013&gt; is <a href="Nirankar" title="wikilink">formless</a>, <a href="akal" title="wikilink">eternal</a>, and <a href="Alakh_Niranjan" title="wikilink">unobserved</a>: <em></em>, <em>ak&lt;U+0101&gt;l</em>, and <em>alakh</em>. Nanak interpreted V&lt;U+0101&gt;higur&lt;U+016B&gt; as a single, personal and <a href="transcendence_(religion)" title="wikilink">transcendental</a> creator. The beginning of the first composition of Sikh scripture is the figure &quot;<a href="1_(number)" title="wikilink">1</a>&quot;&lt;U+2014&gt;signifying the unity of God. To achieve salvation, the devotee must develop an intimate faith in and relationship with God.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> God is <a href="omnipresent" class="uri" title="wikilink">omnipresent</a> and infinite, and is signified by the term <em><a href="Ek_Onkar" title="wikilink">&lt;U+0113&gt;k &lt;U+014D&gt;a&lt;U+1E45&gt;k&lt;U+0101&gt;r</a></em>. Sikhs believe that prior to creation, all that existed was God and his infinite <em><a href="hukam" class="uri" title="wikilink">hukam</a></em> (will).<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> When God willed, the entire cosmos was created. From these beginnings, God nurtured &quot;enticement and attachment&quot; to <em><a href="Maya_(illusion)" title="wikilink">m&lt;U+0101&gt;y&lt;U+0101&gt;</a></em>, or the human perception of reality.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p>While a full understanding of God is beyond human beings,<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> Nanak described God as not wholly unknowable. God is omnipresent (<em><a href="sarav_vi&lt;U+0101&gt;pak" title="wikilink">sarav vi&lt;U+0101&gt;pak</a></em>) in all creation and visible everywhere to the spiritually awakened. Nanak stressed that God must be seen from &quot;the inward eye,&quot; or the &quot;heart&quot; of a human being: devotees must <a href="meditate" class="uri" title="wikilink">meditate</a> to progress towards enlightenment. Nanak emphasised the revelation through meditation, as its rigorous application permits the existence of communication between God and human beings.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> God has no gender in Sikhism, though translations may incorrectly present a masculine God. In addition, Nanak wrote that there are many worlds on which God has created life.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="pursuing-salvation">Pursuing salvation</h3>
<p><img src="Sikh.man.at.the.Golden.Temple.jpg" title="fig:A Sikh man at the Harimandir Sahib." alt="A Sikh man at the Harimandir Sahib." width="250" /> Nanak's teachings are founded not on a final destination of <a href="heaven" class="uri" title="wikilink">heaven</a> or <a href="hell" class="uri" title="wikilink">hell</a>, but on a spiritual union with God which results in <a href="salvation" class="uri" title="wikilink">salvation</a>. The chief obstacles to the attainment of salvation are social conflicts and an attachment to worldly pursuits, which commit men and women to an endless cycle of birth - a concept known as <em><a href="karma" class="uri" title="wikilink">karma</a></em>.</p>
<p><em><a href="Maya_(illusion)" title="wikilink">M&lt;U+0101&gt;y&lt;U+0101&gt;</a></em>&lt;U+2014&gt;defined as illusion or &quot;unreality&quot;&lt;U+2014&gt;is one of the core deviations from the pursuit of God and salvation - people are distracted from devotion by worldly attractions which give only illusive satisfaction. However, Nanak emphasised m&lt;U+0101&gt;y&lt;U+0101&gt; as not a reference to the unreality of the world, but of its values. In Sikhism, the influences of <a href="ahankar" title="wikilink">ego</a>, <a href="krodh" title="wikilink">anger</a>, <a href="lobh" title="wikilink">greed</a>, <a href="moh" title="wikilink">attachment</a> and <a href="kam" title="wikilink">lust</a>&lt;U+2014&gt;known as the <em>Five Evils</em>&lt;U+2014&gt;are to be particularly pernicious. The fate of people vulnerable to the Five Evils is separation from God, and the situation may be remedied only after intensive and relentless devotion.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<p>Nanak described God's revelation&lt;U+2014&gt;the path to salvation&lt;U+2014&gt;with terms such as <em>n&lt;U+0101&gt;m</em> (the divine <em>Name</em>) and <em><a href="shabad" title="wikilink">&lt;U+015B&gt;abad</a></em> (the divine Word) to emphasise the totality of the revelation. Nanak designated the word <em>guru</em> (meaning <em>teacher</em>) as the voice of God and the source and guide for knowledge and salvation.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> Salvation can be reached only through rigorous and disciplined devotion to God. Nanak distinctly emphasised the irrelevance of outwardly observations such as rites, pilgrimages or <a href="asceticism" class="uri" title="wikilink">asceticism</a>. He stressed that devotion must take place through the heart, with the spirit and the soul.</p>
<p>A key practice to be pursued is <em></em>&lt;U+2014&gt;remembrance of the divine Name. The verbal repetition of the name of God or a sacred syllable is an established practice in religious traditions in India, but Nanak's interpretation emphasised inward, personal observance. Nanak's ideal is the total exposure of one's being to the divine Name and a total conforming to the divine Order. Nanak described the result of the disciplined application of <em></em> as a &quot;growing towards and into God&quot; through a gradual process of five stages. The last of these is <em></em> (<em>The Realm of Truth</em>)&lt;U+2014&gt;the final union of the spirit with God.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<p>Nanak stressed <em><a href="kirat_kar&lt;U+014D&gt;" title="wikilink">kirat kar&lt;U+014D&gt;</a></em> - that a Sikh should balance work, worship, and charity, and should defend the rights of all creatures, and in particular, fellow human beings. They are encouraged to have a <em></em>, or <em>optimistic</em>, view of life. Sikh teachings also stress the concept of sharing&lt;U+2014&gt;<em></em>&lt;U+2014&gt;through the distribution of free food at Sikh <a href="gurdwara" title="wikilink">gurdwaras</a> (<em></em>), giving charitable donations, and working for the betterment of the community and others (<em>s&lt;U+0113&gt;v&lt;U+0101&gt;</em>).</p>
<h2 id="the-ten-gurus-and-religious-authority">The ten gurus and religious authority</h2>

<p><img src="Sikh_Gurus_with_Bhai_Bala_and_Bhai_Mardana.jpg" title="fig:A rare Tanjore style painting from the late 19th century depicting the ten Sikh Gurus with Bhai Bala and Bhai Mardana." alt="A rare Tanjore style painting from the late 19th century depicting the ten Sikh Gurus with Bhai Bala and Bhai Mardana." width="250" /> The term <a href="guru" class="uri" title="wikilink">guru</a> comes from the <a href="Sanskrit" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sanskrit</a> <em>gur&lt;U+016B&gt;</em>, meaning teacher, guide or mentor. The traditions and philosophy of Sikhism were established by ten specific gurus from 1469 to 1708. Each guru added to and reinforced the message taught by the previous, resulting in the creation of the Sikh religion. <a href="Guru_Nanak_Dev" title="wikilink">Guru Nanak Dev</a> was the first guru and appointed a disciple as successor. <a href="Guru_Gobind_Singh" title="wikilink">Guru Gobind Singh</a> was the final guru in human form. Before his death, Gobind Singh decreed that the <a href="Gur&lt;U+016B&gt;_Granth_S&lt;U+0101&gt;hib" title="wikilink">Gur&lt;U+016B&gt; Granth S&lt;U+0101&gt;hib</a> would be the final and perpetual guru of the Sikhs.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> </p>
<p>After Nanak's death, the most important phase in the development of Sikhism came with the second successor, Amar Das. Nanak's teachings emphasised the pursuit of salvation; Nanak had significant but loose followings. Amar Das began building a cohesive community of followers with initiatives such as sanctioning distinctive ceremonies for birth, marriage and death. Amar Das also established the <em>manji</em> (comparable to a <a href="diocese" class="uri" title="wikilink">diocese</a>) system of clerical supervision. <a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> <img src="Interior_of_Akal_Takht.jpg" title="fig:The interior of the Akal Takht." alt="The interior of the Akal Takht." width="250" /> Amar Das's successor and son-in-law Ram Das founded the city of <a href="Amritsar" class="uri" title="wikilink">Amritsar</a>, which is home of the <a href="Harimandir_Sahib" title="wikilink">Harimandir Sahib</a> and regarded widely as the holiest city for all Sikhs. When Ram Das's youngest son Arjun Dev succeeded him, the line of male gurus from the <em>Sodhi Khatri</em> family was established: all succeeding gurus were direct descendants of this line. Arjun Dev was responsible for compiling the Sikh scriptures. Arjun Dev was captured by Mughal authorities who were suspicious and hostile to the religious order he was developing.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> His persecution and death inspired his successors to promote a military and political organisation of Sikh communities to defend themselves against the attacks of Mughal forces.</p>
<p>The Sikh gurus established a mechanism which allowed the Sikh religion to react as a community to changing circumstances. The sixth guru, Har Gobind, was responsible for the creation of the <a href="Akal_Takht" title="wikilink">Akal Takht</a> (<em>throne of the timeless one</em>) which serves as the supreme decision-making centre of Sikhdom and sits opposite the Harimandir Sahib. The <em></em> (a representative portion of the Khalsa Panth) historically gathers at the Akal Takht on special festivals such as Vaisakhi or Diwali and when there is a need to discuss matters that affect the entire Sikh nation. A <em><a href="gurmata" title="wikilink">gurmat&lt;U+0101&gt;</a></em> (literally, <em>guru's intention</em>) is an order passed by the  in the presence of the Gur&lt;U+016B&gt; Granth S&lt;U+0101&gt;hib. A gurmat&lt;U+0101&gt; may only be passed on a subject that affects the fundamental principles of Sikh religion; it is binding upon all Sikhs.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> The term <em><a href="Hukamnama" title="wikilink">hukamn&lt;U+0101&gt;m&lt;U+0101&gt;</a></em> (literally, <em>edict</em> or <em>royal order</em>) is often used interchangeably with the term gurmat&lt;U+0101&gt;. However, a hukamn&lt;U+0101&gt;m&lt;U+0101&gt; formally refers to a hymn from the Gur&lt;U+016B&gt; Granth S&lt;U+0101&gt;hib which is given as an order to Sikhs.</p>

Nanak's mother was <a href="Mata_Tripta" title="wikilink">Tripta Devi</a> and he had one older sister, <a href="Bibi_Nanki" title="wikilink">Nanaki</a>. His parents were <a href="Khatri" class="uri" title="wikilink">Khatri</a> <a href="Hindu" title="wikilink">Hindus</a> of the <a href="Bedi" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bedi</a> clan. As a boy, Nanak was fascinated by religion, and his desire to explore the mysteries of life eventually led him to leave home. It was during this period that Nanak was said to have met <a href="Kabir" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kabir</a> (1440–1518), a saint revered by people of different faiths.</p>
<p>Sikh tradition states that at the age of thirty, Nanak went missing and was presumed to have drowned after going for one of his morning baths to a local stream called the <em>Kali Bein</em>. Three days later he reappeared and would give the same answer to any question posed to him: &quot;There is no Hindu, there is no Muslim&quot; (in Punjabi, &quot;<em>n&lt;U+0101&gt; k&lt;U+014D&gt; hind&lt;U+016B&gt; n&lt;U+0101&gt; k&lt;U+014D&gt; musalm&lt;U+0101&gt;n</em>&quot;). It was from this moment that Nanak would begin to spread the teachings of what was then the beginning of Sikhism.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> Although the exact account of his itinerary is disputed, he is widely acknowledged to have made four major journeys, spanning thousands of kilometres. The first tour being east towards <a href="Bengal" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bengal</a> and <a href="Assam" class="uri" title="wikilink">Assam</a>, the second south towards <a href="Ceylon" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ceylon</a> via <a href="Tamil_Nadu" title="wikilink">Tamil Nadu</a>, the third north towards <a href="Kashmir" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kashmir</a>, <a href="Ladakh" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ladakh</a> and <a href="Tibet" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tibet</a>, and the final tour west towards <a href="Baghdad" class="uri" title="wikilink">Baghdad</a> and <a href="Mecca" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mecca</a>.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>
<p>Nanak was married to Sulakhni, the daughter of Moolchand Chona, a rice trader from the town of <a href="Batala" class="uri" title="wikilink">Batala</a>. They had two sons. The elder son, <a href="Sri_Chand" title="wikilink">Sri Chand</a> was an ascetic and he came to have a considerable following of his own, known as the <a href="Udasi" title="wikilink">Udasis</a>. The younger son, Lakshmi Das, on the other hand was totally immersed in worldly life. To Nanak, who believed in the ideal of <em></em> (detachment in civic life), both his sons were unfit to carry on the Guruship.</p>

They refused to accept Angad's succession. On Nanak's advice, Angad shifted from Kartarpur to Khadur, where his wife <a href="Mata_Khivi" title="wikilink">Khivi</a> and children were living, until he was able to bridge the divide between his followers and the Udasis.

<p>From the time of Nanak, when it was a loose collection of followers who focused entirely on the attainment of salvation and God, the Sikh community had significantly transformed. Even though the core Sikh religious philosophy was never affected, the followers now began to develop a political identity. Conflict with Mughal authorities escalated during the lifetime of Teg Bahadur and Gobind Singh. The latter founded the Khalsa in 1699. The Khalsa is a disciplined community that combines its religious purpose and goals with political and military duties.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> After Aurangzeb killed four of his sons, Gobind Singh sent Aurangzeb the <a href="Zafarnama" title="wikilink">Zafarn&lt;U+0101&gt;m&lt;U+0101&gt;</a> (<em>Notification/Epistle of Victory</em>).</p>
<p>Shortly before his death, Gobind Singh ordered that the <a href="Guru_Granth_Sahib" title="wikilink">Gur&lt;U+016B&gt; Granth S&lt;U+0101&gt;hib</a> (the Sikh Holy Scripture), would be the ultimate spiritual authority for the Sikhs and temporal authority would be vested in the Khalsa Panth – The Sikh Nation/Community.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> The first scripture was compiled and edited by the fifth guru, Arjun Dev, in 1604. <img src="Guru_Gobind_Singh_meets_Guru_Nanak_Dev.jpg" title="fig:Guru Gobind Singh (with bird) encounters Guru Nanak Dev.

<p>The Sikh community's embrace of military and political organisation made it a considerable regional force in medieval India and it continued to evolve after the demise of the gurus. After the death of Banda Bahadur, a <a href="Sikh_Confederacy" title="wikilink">loose confederation</a> of Sikh warrior bands known as <em><a href="misls" class="uri" title="wikilink">misls</a></em> formed. With the decline of the Mughal empire, a Sikh empire arose in the Punjab under <a href="Maharaja_Ranjit_Singh_(Punjab)" title="wikilink">Maharaja Ranjit Singh</a>, with its capital in <a href="Lahore" class="uri" title="wikilink">Lahore</a> and limits reaching the <a href="Khyber_Pass" title="wikilink">Khyber Pass</a> and the borders of <a href="China" class="uri" title="wikilink">China</a>.

<h2 id="scripture">Scripture</h2>
<p>There are two primary sources of scripture for the Sikhs: the Gur&lt;U+016B&gt; Granth S&lt;U+0101&gt;hib and the Dasam Granth. The Gur&lt;U+016B&gt; Granth S&lt;U+0101&gt;hib may be referred to as the &lt;U+0100&gt;di Granth&lt;U+2014&gt;literally, <em>The First Volume</em>&lt;U+2014&gt;and the two terms are often used synonymously. Here, however, the &lt;U+0100&gt;di Granth refers to the version of the scripture created by <a href="Guru_Arjun_Dev" title="wikilink">Arjun Dev</a> in 1604. The Gur&lt;U+016B&gt; Granth S&lt;U+0101&gt;hib refers to the final version of the scripture created by <a href="Guru_Gobind_Singh" title="wikilink">Gobind Singh</a>.</p>
<h3 id="adi-granth">Adi Granth</h3>

<p>It is believed that the &lt;U+0100&gt;di Granth was compiled primarily by <a href="Bhai_Gurdas" title="wikilink">Bhai Gurdas</a> under the supervision of <a href="Guru_Arjun_Dev" title="wikilink">Arjun Dev</a> between the years 1603 and 1604.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> It is written in the <a href="Gurmukhi" title="wikilink">Gurmukh&lt;U+012B&gt;</a> script, which is a descendant of the  script used in the Punjab at that time.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> The <a href="Gurmukhi" title="wikilink">Gurmukh&lt;U+012B&gt;</a> script was standardised by Arjun Dev for use in the Sikh scriptures and is thought to have been influenced by the  and <a href="Devan&lt;U+0101&gt;gar&lt;U+012B&gt;" class="uri" title="wikilink">Devan&lt;U+0101&gt;gar&lt;U+012B&gt;</a> scripts. An authoritative scripture was created to protect the integrity of hymns and teachings of the Sikh gurus and selected bhagats. At the time, Arjun Dev tried to prevent undue influence from the followers of Prithi Chand, the guru's older brother and rival.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a></p>

<p>The final version of the Gur&lt;U+016B&gt; Granth S&lt;U+0101&gt;hib was compiled by Guru Gobind Singh. It consists of the original &lt;U+0100&gt;di Granth with the addition of Guru Teg Bahadur's hymns. It was decreed by Gobind Singh that the Granth was to be considered the eternal, living guru of all Sikhs:</p>

<p>The bulk of the scripture is classified into <em><a href="raga" title="wikilink">r&lt;U+0101&gt;gs</a></em>, with each r&lt;U+0101&gt;g subdivided according to length and author. There are 31 main r&lt;U+0101&gt;gs within the Gur&lt;U+016B&gt; Granth S&lt;U+0101&gt;hib. In addition to the r&lt;U+0101&gt;gs, there are clear references to the folk music of Punjab. The main language used in the scripture is known as <em></em>, a language related to both Punjabi and <a href="Hindi_language" title="wikilink">Hindi</a> and used extensively across medieval northern India by proponents of popular devotional religion.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> The text further comprises over 5000 <em><a href="shabhad" title="wikilink">&lt;U+015B&gt;abads</a></em>, or hymns, which are poetically constructed and set to classical form of music rendition, can be set to predetermined musical <em><a href="Tala_(music)" title="wikilink">t&lt;U+0101&gt;l</a></em>, or rhythmic beats.</p>
<p>The Granth begins with the <em><a href="Mul_Mantra" title="wikilink">M&lt;U+016B&gt;l Mantra</a></em>, an iconic verse created by Nanak:</p>

<p>All text within the Granth is known as <em><a href="gurbani" title="wikilink">gurb&lt;U+0101&gt;n&lt;U+012B&gt;</a></em>. Gurb&lt;U+0101&gt;n&lt;U+012B&gt;, according to Nanak, was revealed by God directly, and the authors wrote it down for the followers. The status accorded to the scripture is defined by the evolving interpretation of the concept of <em>gur&lt;U+016B&gt;</em>. In the <em>Sant</em> tradition of Nanak, the guru was literally the word of God. The Sikh community soon transferred the role to a line of men who gave authoritative and practical expression to religious teachings and traditions, in addition to taking socio-political leadership of Sikh adherents. Gobind Singh declared an end of the line of human gurus, and now the Gur&lt;U+016B&gt; Granth S&lt;U+0101&gt;hib serves as the eternal guru, with its interpretation vested with the community.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a></p>

The teachings of Gobind Singh were not included in Gur&lt;U+016B&gt; Granth S&lt;U+0101&gt;hib, the holy book of the <a href="Sikh" title="wikilink">Sikhs</a>, and instead were collected in the Dasam Granth. Unlike the Gur&lt;U+016B&gt; Granth S&lt;U+0101&gt;hib, the Dasam Granth was never declared to hold guruship. The authenticity of some portions of the Granth has been questioned and the appropriateness of the Granth's content still causes much debate.</p>
<p>The entire Granth is written in the <a href="Gurmukh&lt;U+012B&gt;_script" title="wikilink">Gurmukh&lt;U+012B&gt;</a> script, although most of the language is actually <a href="Brij_Bhasha" title="wikilink">Braj</a> and not <a href="Punjabi_language" title="wikilink">Punjabi</a>. Sikh tradition states that <a href="Bhai_Mani_Singh" title="wikilink">Mani Singh</a> collected the writings of Gobind Singh after his death to create the Granth.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a></p>

<p>The Janams&lt;U+0101&gt;kh&lt;U+012B&gt;s (literally <em>birth stories</em>), are writings which profess to be biographies of Guru Nanak Dev. Although not scripture in the strictest sense, they provide an interesting look at Nanak's life and the early start of Sikhism. There are several&lt;U+2014&gt;often contradictory and sometimes unreliable&lt;U+2014&gt;Janams&lt;U+0101&gt;kh&lt;U+012B&gt;s and they are not held in the same regard as other sources of scriptural knowledge.</p>

The daily recitation from memory of specific passages from the Gur&lt;U+016B&gt; Granth S&lt;U+0101&gt;hib, especially the <em>Japu</em> (or <em>Japj&lt;U+012B&gt;</em>, literally <em>chant</em>) hymns is recommended immediately after rising and bathing. Family customs include both reading passages from the scripture and attending the <a href="gurdwara" class="uri" title="wikilink">gurdwara</a> (also <em>gurdu&lt;U+0101&gt;r&lt;U+0101&gt;</em>, meaning <em>the doorway to God</em>). There are many gurdwaras prominently constructed and maintained across India, as well as in almost every nation where Sikhs reside. Gurdwaras are open to all, regardless of religion, background, caste or race.</p>
<p>Worship in a gurdwara consists chiefly of singing of passages from the scripture. Sikhs will commonly enter the temple, touch the ground before the holy scripture with their foreheads, and make an offering. The recitation of the eighteenth century <em><a href="ard&lt;U+0101&gt;s" class="uri" title="wikilink">ard&lt;U+0101&gt;s</a></em> is also customary for attending Sikhs. The ard&lt;U+0101&gt;s recalls past sufferings and glories of the community, invoking divine grace for all humanity.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a></p>
<p>The most sacred shrine is the <a href="Harimandir_Sahib" title="wikilink">Harimandir Sahib</a> in Amritsar, famously known as the <em>Golden Temple</em>. Groups of Sikhs regularly visit and congregate at the Harimandir Sahib. On specific occasions, groups of Sikhs are permitted to undertake a pilgrimage to Sikh shrines in the province of <a href="Punjab_(Pakistan)" title="wikilink">Punjab</a> in Pakistan, especially at <a href="Nankana_Sahib" title="wikilink">Nankana Sahib</a> and the <em><a href="sam&lt;U+0101&gt;dh&lt;U+012B&gt;" class="uri" title="wikilink">sam&lt;U+0101&gt;dh&lt;U+012B&gt;</a></em> (place of cremation) of Maharaja Ranjit Singh in Lahore.</p>
<p>Festivals in Sikhism mostly centre around the lives of the Gurus and Sikh martyrs. The <a href="SGPC" class="uri" title="wikilink">SGPC</a>, the Sikh organisation in charge of upkeep of the gurdwaras, organises celebrations based on the new <a href="Nanakshahi" class="uri" title="wikilink">Nanakshahi</a> calendar. This calendar is highly controversial among Sikhs and is not universally accepted. Several festivals (Hola Mohalla, Diwali and Guru Nanak's birthday) continue to be celebrated using the <a href="Hindu_calendar" title="wikilink">Hindu calendar</a>. Sikh festivals include the following:</p>

<li><a href="Gurpurab" title="wikilink">Gurpurabs</a> are celebrations or commemorations based on the lives of the Sikh gurus. They tend to be either birthdays or celebrations of Sikh martyrdom.</li>
<li><a href="Vaisakhi" class="uri" title="wikilink">Vaisakhi</a> normally occurs on 13 April and marks the beginning of the new spring year and the end of the harvest.

Migration beginning from the nineteenth century led to the creation of significant communities in <a href="Canada" class="uri" title="wikilink">Canada</a> (Brampton, Ontario; Surrey, British Columbia), the <a href="United_Kingdom" title="wikilink">United Kingdom</a>, the <a href="Middle_East" title="wikilink">Middle East</a>, <a href="East_Africa" title="wikilink">East Africa</a>, <a href="Southeast_Asia" title="wikilink">Southeast Asia</a> and more recently, the <a href="United_States" title="wikilink">United States</a>, <a href="Western_Europe" title="wikilink">Western Europe</a>, <a href="Australia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Australia</a> and <a href="New_Zealand" title="wikilink">New Zealand</a>.</p>
<p>Smaller populations of Sikhs are found in <a href="Mauritius" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mauritius</a>, <a href="Sri_Lanka" title="wikilink">Sri Lanka</a>, <a href="Nepal" class="uri" title="wikilink">Nepal</a>, <a href="Fiji" class="uri" title="wikilink">Fiji</a> and other countries.</p>
<p>As with most world religions, there are groups of Sikhs (such as the <a href="Namdhari" title="wikilink">Namdharis</a>, <a href="Ravidasi" title="wikilink">Ravidasis</a> and <a href="Udasi" title="wikilink">Udasis</a>) who do not adhere to the mainstream principles followed by most Sikhs. Some of these groups may not consider themselves a part of Sikhism, although similarities in beliefs and principles firmly render them a part of the Sikh religious domain. Groups such as the <a href="Nirankari" title="wikilink">Nirankaris</a> have a history of bad relations with mainstream Sikhism, and are considered pariahs by some Sikhs. Others, such as the <a href="Nihang" title="wikilink">Nihangs</a>, tend to have little difference in belief and practice, and are considered Sikhs proper by mainstream Sikhism.</p>
