<p>In 1892 <strong>William H. White</strong> published &quot;The Architect and his artists, an essay to assist the public in considering the question is architecture a profession or an art&quot; in reply to &quot;Architecture, a Profession or an Art&quot; edited by <a href="Norman_Shaw" title="wikilink">Norman Shaw</a> and <a href="T._G._Jackson" title="wikilink">T. G. Jackson</a>.</p>
<p>This had been part of the course of events which resulted in the passing of the the <a href="Architects_(Registration)_Acts,_1931_to_1938" title="wikilink">Architects (Registration) Acts, 1931 to 1938</a> which established the statutory <a href="Architects_Registration_in_the_United_Kingdom" title="wikilink"> Register of Architects</a> and <a href="monopoly" title="wikilink"> monopolistic</a> restrictions on the use of the <a href="vernacular" class="uri" title="wikilink">vernacular</a> word &quot;<a href="architect" class="uri" title="wikilink">architect</a>&quot;, imposed with threat of <a href="penalty" class="uri" title="wikilink">penalty</a> on <a href="prosecution" class="uri" title="wikilink">prosecution</a> for <a href="infringement" class="uri" title="wikilink">infringement</a>.</p>
<p>The keeping of the Register of Architects is now governed by the Architects Act 1997, and the name of the body responsible for the Register has been changed from the <a href="Architects_Registration_Council_of_the_United_Kingdom" title="wikilink">Architects Registration Council of the United Kingdom</a> (ARCUK) to the <a href="Architects_Registration_Board" title="wikilink">Architects Registration Board</a> (ARB).</p>
