<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<p>The city was founded in 1877 along the newly-constructed line of the <a href="Colorado_Central_Railroad" title="wikilink">Colorado Central Railroad</a>, near its crossing of the <a href="Big_Thompson_River" title="wikilink">Big Thompson River</a>. It was named in honor of <a href="William_A.H._Loveland" title="wikilink">William A.H. Loveland</a>, the president of the Colorado Central Railroad. The city was founded one mile (1.6 km) upstream from the existing small settlement of St. Louis, the buildings of which were moved to the site of Loveland. For the first half of the 20th century the town was dependent on agriculture. The primary crops in the area were <a href="sugar_beet" title="wikilink">sugar beets</a> and <a href="sour_cherries" title="wikilink">sour cherries</a>. In 1901, the <a href="Great_Western_Sugar_Company" title="wikilink">Great Western Sugar Company</a> built a factory in Loveland, which remained as a source of employment until its closure in 1985. During the late 1920s the Spring Glade orchard was the largest cherry orchard west of the <a href="Mississippi_River" title="wikilink">Mississippi River</a>. At that time the cherry orchards produced more than <a href="United_States_dollar" title="wikilink">$</a>1 million worth of <a href="cherry" title="wikilink">cherries</a> per year. A series of droughts, attacks of blight and finally a killer freeze destroyed the industry. By 1960 cherries were no longer farmed. In the late 20th century, the economy diversified with the arrival of manufacturing facilities by <a href="Hewlett-Packard" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hewlett-Packard</a>, <a href="Teledyne" class="uri" title="wikilink">Teledyne</a>, and Hach, a <a href="water_quality" title="wikilink">water quality</a> analysis equipment manufacturer. A new <a href="Hospital" title="wikilink">medical center</a> has added a substantial amount of employment in that sector as well.</p>
<p>The city is south of <a href="Fort_Collins,_Colorado" title="wikilink">Fort Collins</a>, its larger neighbor and the county seat. The two cities have been steadily growing towards each other over the last several decades and are considered to be a single metropolitan area by the U.S. government. The establishment of county-owned open space between the two communities in the 1990s was intended to create a permanent buffer to contiguous growth. Loveland has aggressively expanded its incorporated limits eastward to embrace the interchange of <a href="Interstate_25_(Colorado)" title="wikilink">Interstate 25</a> and <a href="U.S._Highway_34_(Colorado)" title="wikilink">U.S. Highway 34</a>, and is currently developing the area. In the last decade, the intersection has become a primary commercial hub of <a href="northern_Colorado" title="wikilink">northern Colorado</a>, with the construction of shopping centers and the <a href="Budweiser_Events_Center" title="wikilink">Budweiser Events Center</a>. A <a href="http://www.bannerhealth.com/Locations/Colorado/McKee+Medical+Center/_McKee+Medical+Center+Home.htm">new medical center</a> and <a href="http://www.thepromenadeshopsatcenterra.com/index.cfm">mall</a> have also been built on the <a href="Interstate_25_(Colorado)" title="wikilink">Interstate 25</a> and <a href="U.S._Highway_34_(Colorado)" title="wikilink">U.S. Highway 34</a> interchange. This area is known as Centerra. The interchange is shared with its smaller neighbor <a href="Johnstown,_Colorado" title="wikilink">Johnstown</a>, of <a href="Weld_County,_Colorado" title="wikilink">Weld County</a>.</p>

<h2 id="the-valentine-re-mailing-program">The Valentine Re-Mailing Program</h2>
<p>Loveland is the home of the <a href="Valentine&#39;s_Day" title="wikilink">Valentine</a> Re-Mailing Program. For decades people from across the world have sent their valentines to Loveland, Colorado, to be hand-stamped with a cachet and verse, and a specially designed postal cancelation. A new verse and stamp are selected each year through a contest held by the Loveland Chamber of Commerce and residents can submit their poems and artwork to be judged. On average, this program re-mails more than 160,000 cards from the United States and more than 110 countries. Loveland&lt;U+2019&gt;s Valentine Re-mailing Program has inspired many other Valentine&lt;U+2019&gt;s Day programs including the Official Loveland Valentine, Miss Loveland Valentine and the Thompson Valley Rotary Heart&lt;U+2019&gt;s Program. Information on all these programs is available through the <a href="http://www.loveland.org/valentineprogram">Loveland Chamber of Commerce website</a>. The Loveland Chamber of Commerce and the Loveland Post Office sponsor the Loveland Valentine Re-mailing Program.</p>
<p>Loveland&lt;U+2019&gt;s Valentine Re-mailing Program began in January 1947 by Ted Thompson and Elmer Ivers, the Loveland postmaster after Ivers received about 30 valentines from individuals requesting to have the cards postmarked from Loveland for, &lt;U+201C&gt;a romantic extra touch.&lt;U+201D&gt; The two thought re-mailing valentines would be an opportunity to advertise Loveland, and the Loveland Chamber of Commerce agreed to promote the service. Thompson designed a cachet with the message, &lt;U+201C&gt;A Valentine Greeting from Sweetheart Town, Loveland, Colorado,&lt;U+201D&gt; and the image was a heart pierced by an arrow over the Rocky Mountains. The cachet was used twice, then Thompson started the tradition of changing it each year at the request of collectors. Since then, a different verse and design have been used every year.</p>
<h2 id="the-public-arts-program">The public arts program</h2>
