<p><strong>Ralph George Houk</strong> (born <a href="August_9" title="wikilink">August 9</a>, <a href="1919" class="uri" title="wikilink">1919</a> in <a href="Lawrence,_Kansas" title="wikilink">Lawrence, Kansas</a>), nicknamed &quot;The Major,&quot; is a former <a href="catcher" class="uri" title="wikilink">catcher</a>, <a href="coach_(baseball)" title="wikilink">coach</a>, <a href="manager_(baseball)" title="wikilink">manager</a>, and front office executive in <a href="Major_League_Baseball" title="wikilink">Major League Baseball</a>. He is best known as the successor of <a href="Casey_Stengel" title="wikilink">Casey Stengel</a> as the manager of the <a href="New_York_Yankees" title="wikilink">New York Yankees</a> from 1961-63, when he won three consecutive <a href="American_League" title="wikilink">American League</a> pennants and the 1961-62 <a href="World_Series" title="wikilink">World Series</a> championships.</p>
<h2 id="playing-career">Playing career</h2>
<p>Houk was a catcher working his way through the Yankees' <a href="farm_system" title="wikilink">farm system</a> when the U.S. entered <a href="World_War_II" title="wikilink">World War II</a>. He enlisted in the armed forces, became an <a href="Army_Ranger" title="wikilink">Army Ranger</a>, and received a battlefield commission, rising from private to major. He was a combat veteran of <a href="Bastogne" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bastogne</a> and the <a href="Battle_of_the_Bulge" title="wikilink">Battle of the Bulge</a>, and was awarded the <a href="Silver_Star" title="wikilink">Silver Star</a>, <a href="Purple_Heart" title="wikilink">Purple Heart</a> and <a href="Bronze_Star_Medal" title="wikilink">Bronze Star</a>. Returning to baseball after the war, Houk eventually reached the major leagues, serving as the Yankees' second- and third-string catcher behind <a href="Yogi_Berra" title="wikilink">Yogi Berra</a>. A right-handed hitter, Houk appeared in only 91 games over eight seasons (1947-54), finishing with a <a href="batting_average" title="wikilink">batting average</a> of .272. Although the Yankees participated in seven World Series during that period, Houk had only two Series at-bats (one in <a href="1947_World_Series" title="wikilink">1947</a>, the other in <a href="1952_World_Series" title="wikilink">1952</a>), batting .500.</p>
<p>Houk's last two years as an active player, 1953-54, were actually spent as the Yankees' full-time bullpen coach, thus beginning his managerial apprenticeship. In 1955, he was named manager of the Yanks' AAA affiliate, the <a href="Denver_Bears" title="wikilink">Denver Bears</a> of the <a href="American_Association_(20th_century)" title="wikilink">American Association</a>. Following three highly successful seasons at Denver, Houk returned to the Bronx as Stengel's first-base coach from 1958-60. From late May through early June <a href="1960_in_baseball" title="wikilink">1960</a>, Houk served as acting manager of the Yanks for 13 games while Stengel, 70, was sidelined by illness. (The team won 7 and lost 6.) Then, after the Yanks lost the <a href="1960_World_Series" title="wikilink">1960 World Series</a> to the <a href="Pittsburgh_Pirates" title="wikilink">Pittsburgh Pirates</a> &lt;U+2014&gt; and with Houk one of the hottest managerial candidates in baseball &lt;U+2014&gt; the Yankees &quot;discharged&quot; Stengel (to use Stengel's own words) and promoted Houk.</p>
<h2 id="a-players-manager">A player's manager</h2>
<p>Houk was known as a &quot;player's manager&quot; &lt;U+2014&gt; albeit one with a fearsome temper. <a href="Tommy_Lasorda" title="wikilink">Tommy Lasorda</a>, a <a href="Baseball_Hall_of_Fame" title="wikilink">Baseball Hall of Fame</a> manager, briefly played for Houk at Denver (one of Lasorda's rare stints outside the <a href="Los_Angeles_Dodgers" title="wikilink">Dodger</a> organization) and called Houk the best handler of men he ever played for, and modeled his managerial style on him. On the other hand, the <a href="Kansas_Sports_Hall_of_Fame" title="wikilink">Kansas Sports Hall of Fame</a>, of which Houk is a member, describes Houk as &quot;rough, blunt and decisive&quot; and his famous cap-throwing and -kicking tantrums in arguments with <a href="umpire_(baseball)" title="wikilink">umpires</a> earned him 45 ejections as a skipper in the majors. In <a href="2007_in_baseball" title="wikilink">2007</a>, Houk was tied with another former Yankee skipper, <a href="Billy_Martin" title="wikilink">Billy Martin</a>, for fourteenth place on baseball's &quot;most ejected&quot; list. <a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>He was a breath of fresh air after the distant and sarcastic Stengel, and the early 1960s Yankees responded to his leadership. His <a href="1961_in_baseball" title="wikilink">1961</a> team led by <a href="Roger_Maris" title="wikilink">Roger Maris</a> (61 <a href="home_run" title="wikilink">home runs</a>), <a href="Mickey_Mantle" title="wikilink">Mickey Mantle</a> (54 homers) and <a href="Whitey_Ford" title="wikilink">Whitey Ford</a> (25 victories) won 109 games and thrashed the <a href="Cincinnati_Reds" title="wikilink">Cincinnati Reds</a> in five games in the <a href="1961_World_Series" title="wikilink">World Series</a>. His <a href="1962_in_baseball" title="wikilink">1962</a> club won 96 games and the pennant and outlasted the <a href="San_Francisco_Giants" title="wikilink">San Francisco Giants</a> in a thrilling <a href="1962_World_Series" title="wikilink">Fall Classic</a>. In <a href="1963_in_baseball" title="wikilink">1963</a>, the Yanks won 104 games and rolled to the pennant, but were ignominiously swept in four games by the Los Angeles Dodgers in the <a href="1963_World_Series" title="wikilink">Series</a>.</p>
<h2 id="in-the-yankees-front-office">In the Yankees front office</h2>
<p>That winter, Houk moved into the Yankees' front office as <a href="General_Manager_(baseball)" title="wikilink">general manager</a>, replacing <a href="Roy_Hamey" title="wikilink">Roy Hamey</a>, and Berra, at the end of his brilliant playing career, became the Yanks' new skipper. Yogi would win the <a href="1964_in_baseball" title="wikilink">1964</a> pennant, but Houk and the Yankee ownership quickly became disenchanted with Berra's work and in mid-season they made up their mind to fire him. After Berra's seven-game loss to the <a href="St._Louis_Cardinals" title="wikilink">St. Louis Cardinals</a> in the <a href="1964_World_Series" title="wikilink">1964 World Series</a>, Houk sacked the Yankee legend and ironically hired the Cardinal manager, <a href="Johnny_Keane" title="wikilink">Johnny Keane</a>, as his successor. But the great postwar Yankee dynasty was aged and crumbling, the farm system had seriously deteriorated, the <a href="Oakland_Athletics" title="wikilink">Kansas City Athletics</a> were no longer a reliable source for major league talent, and the inception of the player draft cut into Yankee recruiting. Keane, a longtime minor league skipper, was better suited by temperament for managing young players than established and aging superstars, and his hiring was a failure. The team fell to sixth in <a href="1965_in_baseball" title="wikilink">1965</a> and had won only four of the first 20 games of <a href="1966_in_baseball" title="wikilink">1966</a> when Keane was fired by Houk, who named himself manager.</p>
<h2 id="back-to-the-bench">Back to the bench</h2>
<p>Houk came down from the front office (he was eventually succeeded as general manager by <a href="Lee_MacPhail" title="wikilink">Lee MacPhail</a>) to begin a second, and far less successful, term as Yankee skipper, finishing the 1966 season. Their talent depleted, the Yankees finished dead last&lt;U+2014&gt;the first time they had done so since <a href="1912_in_baseball" title="wikilink">1912</a>. At season's end, the Yankees would start a long rebuilding process, which included <a href="Bobby_Richardson" title="wikilink">Bobby Richardson</a>'s retirement (longtime roommate <a href="Tony_Kubek" title="wikilink">Tony Kubek</a> had retired with a bad back after the 1965 season) and the trading of both Maris and <a href="Clete_Boyer" title="wikilink">Clete Boyer</a>.</p>
<p>Houk would continue to manage the Yankees from 1967-73. His best season was <a href="1970_in_baseball" title="wikilink">1970</a>, when the Yanks won 93 games, but finished 15 games behind the eventual world champion <a href="Baltimore_Orioles" title="wikilink">Baltimore Orioles</a>. He worked for <a href="George_Steinbrenner" title="wikilink">George Steinbrenner</a> for one season, in <a href="1973_in_baseball" title="wikilink">1973</a>, and was the Bombers' manager during their final game in 1973 at the &quot;original&quot; <a href="Yankee_Stadium" title="wikilink">Yankee Stadium</a> prior to its closure for two seasons for needed renovations.</p>
<p>He then left the Yankee organization to become the manager of the rebuilding <a href="Detroit_Tigers" title="wikilink">Detroit Tigers</a>. His <a href="1975_in_baseball" title="wikilink">1975</a> team lost 102 games, but by <a href="1978_in_baseball" title="wikilink">1978</a> Houk had restored Detroit to respectability and brought to the majors future stars of the <a href="Sparky_Anderson" title="wikilink">Sparky Anderson</a> Tigers such as <a href="Lou_Whitaker" title="wikilink">Lou Whitaker</a>, <a href="Alan_Trammell" title="wikilink">Alan Trammell</a> and <a href="Jack_Morris" title="wikilink">Jack Morris</a>. After an 86-76 season in 1978, Houk retired.</p>
<h3 id="boston-red-sox">Boston Red Sox</h3>
<p>Since the late 1950s, Houk and the <a href="Boston_Red_Sox" title="wikilink">Boston Red Sox</a>, the Yankees' arch-rivals, had flirted over their manager's job. After two years of retirement, in the autumn of <a href="1980_in_baseball" title="wikilink">1980</a>, Houk (at 61) was ready to get back into baseball and when the Red Sox called about their open managerial post (they had fired <a href="Don_Zimmer" title="wikilink">Don Zimmer</a>), he jumped at the chance.</p>
<p>Although not as daunting as his Detroit assignment, Houk faced another rebuilding job: the powerful Boston team of the 1970s was about to lose marquee players such as <a href="Carlton_Fisk" title="wikilink">Carlton Fisk</a> and <a href="Fred_Lynn" title="wikilink">Fred Lynn</a> and needed to retool its roster. But Houk rose to the challenge, and in four seasons produced three over-.500 teams. On his watch, Boston broke in young players such as <a href="Wade_Boggs" title="wikilink">Wade Boggs</a>, <a href="Roger_Clemens" title="wikilink">Roger Clemens</a>, <a href="Bruce_Hurst" title="wikilink">Bruce Hurst</a> and <a href="Marty_Barrett" title="wikilink">Marty Barrett</a>. When Houk retired from managing permanently in October <a href="1984_in_baseball" title="wikilink">1984</a>, just after his 65th birthday, he bequeathed the core of another pennant winning ballclub (in this case, in <a href="1986_in_baseball" title="wikilink">1986</a>) to his successor, <a href="John_McNamara_(baseball)" title="wikilink">John McNamara</a>.</p>
<p>His final record, over 20 years with the Yankees (1961-63, 1966-73), Tigers (1974-78) and Red Sox (1981-84) was 1,619 wins and 1,531 losses (.514), plus eight wins and eight losses in the World Series. After his first three championship seasons, he never appeared in the postseason.</p>
<h2 id="late-career">Late career</h2>
<p>Houk served in the front office of the <a href="Minnesota_Twins" title="wikilink">Minnesota Twins</a> under <a href="Andy_MacPhail" title="wikilink">Andy MacPhail</a>, Lee's son, from 1986-88 before quitting the game for good.</p>
<p>Colorful opinions about Houk can be found in <a href="Jim_Bouton" title="wikilink">Jim Bouton</a>'s classic 1970 memoir, <em><a href="Ball_Four" title="wikilink">Ball Four</a></em>. Houk was Bouton's first major league manager and sparred with him over contracts when Houk was the Yankees' GM.</p>
