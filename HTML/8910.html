<h3 id="greekonomics">Greekonomics</h3>
<p>In October 2012, <a href="Biteback_Publishing" title="wikilink">Biteback Publishing</a> brought out her book, <a href="Greekonomics" class="uri" title="wikilink">Greekonomics</a>, a discussion of the crises in the eurozone, with the focus especially as the title indicates on the country of her birth. This book is intended for a broad, not merely an academic, audience.</p>
<p>It paints a vivid picture of what a Greek exit from the eurozone might mean: &quot;A serious possibility of exit -- and how could it be kept completely secret? -- would lead to a full-scale run on the banks. Clearly any country wishing to exit the eurozone would have to nationalize or take temporary control of the banks and reintroduce controls on the movement of capital. The government would also need to reintroduce stringent border controls to stop people leaving the country with euro notes and coins in their luggage or in their underwear! In countries like Greece, where taking to the streets is part of the political way of life, the population would probably react by attempting to physically remove their savings, breaking into the banks -- and then for good measure attacking Parliament. So in Greece a euro exit could easily end with troops on the streets and martial law -- just the circumstances that joining the EU was meant to prevent.&quot;</p>
