<h2 id="early-life">Early life</h2>

<p>Pacelli was born in <a href="Rome" class="uri" title="wikilink">Rome</a> on <a href="March_2" title="wikilink">March 2</a> <a href="1876" class="uri" title="wikilink">1876</a> into a well-off <a href="aristocracy" title="wikilink">aristocratic</a> family with a history of ties to the papacy (the &quot;<a href="Black_Nobility" title="wikilink">Black Nobility</a>&quot;). His grandfather, Marcantonio Pacelli was Undersecretary of the Interior under <a href="Pope_Pius_IX" title="wikilink">Pope Pius IX</a> from 1851 to 1870 and founded the Vatican's newspaper, <em><a href="L&#39;Osservatore_Romano" title="wikilink">L'Osservatore Romano</a></em> in 1861;<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> his uncle, Ernesto Pacelli, was a key financial advisor to <a href="Pope_Leo_XII" title="wikilink">Pope Leo XII</a>; his father, Filippo Pacelli, was the dean of the <a href="Sacra_Rota_Romana" title="wikilink">Sacra Rota Romana</a>; and his brother, Francesco Pacelli, became a highly-regarded <a href="Laity" title="wikilink">lay</a> <a href="Canon_law" title="wikilink">canon lawyer</a>, credited for his role in negotiating the <a href="Lateran_treaties" title="wikilink">Lateran treaties</a>, whom Pius XII would later name a <a href="marchese" class="uri" title="wikilink">marchese</a>.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> At the age of twelve Pacelli announced his intentions to enter the priesthood instead of becoming a lawyer. Most of what is known about Pacelli's early life comes from a comprehensive biography by Sister Margherita Marchione. <a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>After completing state primary schools, Pacelli received his secondary, <a href="classics" title="wikilink">classical</a> education at the Visconti Institute. In 1894, at the age of eighteen, he entered the Almo Capranica Seminary to begin study for the priesthood and enrolled at the <a href="Pontifical_Gregorian_University" title="wikilink">Pontifical Gregorian University</a> and the Appolinare Institute of Lateran University. From 1895-1896, he studied <a href="philosophy" class="uri" title="wikilink">philosophy</a> at <a href="University_of_Rome_La_Sapienza" title="wikilink">University of Rome La Sapienza</a>.

In 1901, he entered the <a href="Department_of_Extraordinary_Ecclesiastical_Affairs" title="wikilink">Department of Extraordinary Ecclesiastical Affairs</a>, a sub-office of the <a href="Secretariat_of_State_(Vatican)" title="wikilink">Vatican Secretariat of State</a>, where he became a <em>minutante</em>, at the recommendation of Cardinal Vannutelli, another family friend.</p>
<p>In 1904, Pacelli became a <a href="papal_chamberlain" title="wikilink">papal chamberlain</a> and in 1905 a <a href="Domestic_Prelate" title="wikilink">domestic prelate</a>. From 1904 until 1916, Father Pacelli assisted <a href="Pietro_Gasparri" title="wikilink">Cardinal Gasparri</a> in his codification of <a href="Canon_law_(Catholic_Church)" title="wikilink">canon law</a> with the Department of Extraordinary Ecclesiastical Affairs. He was also chosen by <a href="Pope_Leo_XIII" title="wikilink">Pope Leo XIII</a> to deliver condolences on behalf of the Vatican to <a href="Edward_VII_of_the_United_Kingdom" title="wikilink">Edward VII of the United Kingdom</a> after the death of <a href="Victoria_of_the_United_Kingdom" title="wikilink">Queen Victoria</a>.

<p>In 1908 and 1911, Pacelli turned down professorships in canon law at a Roman university and <a href="The_Catholic_University_of_America" title="wikilink">The Catholic University of America</a>, respectively. Pacelli became the under-secretary in 1911, adjunct-secretary in 1912 (a position he received under <a href="Pope_Pius_X" title="wikilink">Pope Pius X</a> and retained under <a href="Pope_Benedict_XV" title="wikilink">Pope Benedict XV</a>) and secretary of the Department of Extraordinary Ecclesiastical Affairs in 1914—succeeding Gasparri, who was promoted to <a href="Cardinal_Secretary_of_State" title="wikilink">Cardinal Secretary of State</a>. As secretary, Pacelli concluded a concordat with <a href="History_of_Serbia" title="wikilink">Serbia</a> four days before Archduke <a href="Franz_Ferdinand" title="wikilink">Franz Ferdinand</a> was assassinated in <a href="Sarajevo" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sarajevo</a>. During <a href="World_War_I" title="wikilink">World War I</a>, Pacelli maintained the Vatican's registry of <a href="prisoner_of_war" title="wikilink">prisoners of war</a>. In 1915, he travelled to <a href="Vienna" class="uri" title="wikilink">Vienna</a> to assist Monsignor Scapinelli—the <a href="nuncio" title="wikilink">apostolic nuncio</a> to Vienna—in his negotiations with <a href="Franz_Joseph_I_of_Austria" title="wikilink">Franz Joseph I of Austria</a> regarding Italy.</p>

As there was no nuncio to <a href="Prussia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Prussia</a> at the time, Pacelli was, for all practical purposes, the nuncio to all of the German Empire, having his nunciature extended to <a href="Germany" class="uri" title="wikilink">Germany</a> and <a href="Prussia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Prussia</a> officially in June 23, 1920 and 1925 respectively. Many of Pacelli's Munich staff would stay with him for the rest of his life, including <a href="Pasqualina_Lehnert" title="wikilink">Sister Pasqualina Lehnert</a>—housekeeper, friend, and adviser to Pacelli for 41 years.</p>
<p>When <a href="Eugen_Levine" title="wikilink">Eugen Levine</a> and <a href="Kurt_Eisner" title="wikilink">Kurt Eisner</a> established a short-lived <a href="Bavarian_Soviet_Republic" title="wikilink">Soviet Republic</a> in Bavaria on November 7, 1918, Pacelli was one of the few foreign diplomats to remain in <a href="Munich" class="uri" title="wikilink">Munich</a>. In 1919, Pacelli faced down a small group of <a href="Spartacist_League" title="wikilink">Spartacist</a> revolutionaries and reportedly convinced them to leave the offices of the nunciature without incident. The oft-repeated anecdote—reminiscent of <a href="Pope_Leo_I" title="wikilink">Pope Leo I</a> turning <a href="Attila_the_Hun" title="wikilink">Attila the Hun</a> away from the gates of Rome—is often cited as a formative experience which informed Pacelli's later impressions of <a href="Communism" class="uri" title="wikilink">Communism</a> and leftist movements in general.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> Similarly, he later dispersed a mob attacking his car by raising his cross and blessing his assailants, as related by <a href="Fulton_J._Sheen" title="wikilink">Bishop Fulton Sheen</a>—the recipient of the cross—on <a href="television" class="uri" title="wikilink">television</a>.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>

<p><img src="Piusgutenberg.jpg" title="fig:Pacelli examines a Gutenberg Bible at the Library of Congress" alt="Pacelli examines a Gutenberg Bible at the Library of Congress" /> Pacelli was appointed cardinal on <a href="16_December" title="wikilink">16 December</a>, <a href="1929" class="uri" title="wikilink">1929</a> by <a href="Pope_Pius_XI" title="wikilink">Pope Pius XI</a>. Within a few months, on <a href="7_February" title="wikilink">7 February</a> <a href="1930" class="uri" title="wikilink">1930</a>, Pius XI appointed Pacelli <a href="Cardinal_Secretary_of_State" title="wikilink">Cardinal Secretary of State</a>. In 1935, Cardinal Pacelli was named as the <a href="camerlengo" class="uri" title="wikilink">camerlengo</a> of the Holy Roman Church. As Cardinal Secretary of State, Pacelli signed concordats with many non-Communist states in an attempt to gain recognition for the four-year-old Vatican State, including concordats with <a href="Baden" class="uri" title="wikilink">Baden</a> (1932), Austria (1933), Germany (1933), <a href="Kingdom_of_Yugoslavia" title="wikilink">Yugoslavia</a> (1935) and <a href="Portugal" class="uri" title="wikilink">Portugal</a> (1940). The <a href="Lateran_treaties" title="wikilink">Lateran treaties</a> with <a href="Italy" class="uri" title="wikilink">Italy</a> (1929) were concluded before Pacelli rose to the office of Secretariat. Such concordats allowed the Catholic Church to organize youth groups, make ecclesiastical appointments, run schools, hospitals, and charities, or even conduct religious services. They also ensured that canon law would be recognized within some spheres (e.g. church decrees of <a href="nullity" class="uri" title="wikilink">nullity</a> in the area of <a href="marriage" class="uri" title="wikilink">marriage</a>).</p>
<p>He also made many diplomatic visits throughout Europe and the Americas, including an extensive visit to the <a href="United_States" title="wikilink">United States</a> in 1936 where he met with <a href="Charles_Coughlin" title="wikilink">Charles Coughlin</a> and <a href="Franklin_D._Roosevelt" title="wikilink">Franklin D. Roosevelt</a>, who appointed a personal envoy—who did not require Senate confirmation—to the <a href="Holy_See" title="wikilink">Holy See</a> in December 1939, re-establishing a diplomatic tradition that had been broken since 1870 when the pope lost <a href="temporal_power" title="wikilink">temporal power</a>.</p>
<p>Pacelli presided as <a href="Papal_Legate" title="wikilink">Papal Legate</a> over the <a href="International_Eucharistic_Congress" title="wikilink">International Eucharistic Congress</a> in <a href="Buenos_Aires" title="wikilink">Buenos Aires</a>, <a href="Argentina" class="uri" title="wikilink">Argentina</a> on October 10-14, 1934, and in <a href="Budapest" class="uri" title="wikilink">Budapest</a> on May 25-30, 1938.</p>
<p>Historians have argued that Pacelli, as Cardinal Secretary of State, dissuaded <a href="Pope_Pius_XI" title="wikilink">Pope Pius XI</a>—who was nearing death at the time<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a>—from condemning <em><a href="Kristallnacht" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kristallnacht</a></em> in November 1938,<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> when he was informed of it by the papal nuncio in Berlin. <a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>

<p>The <em><a href="Reichskonkordat" class="uri" title="wikilink">Reichskonkordat</a></em>, signed on <a href="July_20" title="wikilink">July 20</a>, <a href="1933" class="uri" title="wikilink">1933</a>, between Germany and the Holy See remains the most important and controversial of Pacelli's concordats. A national concordat with Germany was one of Pacelli's main objectives as secretary of state — historian <a href="Klaus_Scholder" title="wikilink">Klaus Scholder</a> called it his &quot;great goal&quot;. As <a href="nuncio" class="uri" title="wikilink">nuncio</a> during the 1920s he had made unsuccessful attempts to obtain German agreement for such a treaty, and between 1930 and 1933 he attempted to initiate negotiations with representatives of successive German governments.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a><a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<p><a href="Heinrich_Br&lt;U+00FC&gt;ning" title="wikilink">Heinrich Br&lt;U+00FC&gt;ning</a>, leader of the Catholic <a href="Centre_Party_(Germany)" title="wikilink">German Centre Party</a> and <a href="Chancellor_of_Germany" title="wikilink">Chancellor of Germany</a> met with Pacelli on August 8, 1931. According to Br&lt;U+00FC&gt;ning's memoirs Pacelli suggested that he disband the Centre Party's governing coalition with the Social Democrats and &quot;form a government of the right simply for the sake of a Reich concordat, and in doing so make it a condition that a concordat be concluded immediately.&quot; Br&lt;U+00FC&gt;ning refused to do so, replying that Pacelli &quot;mistook the political situation in Germany and, above all, the true character of the Nazis.&quot;<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<p>After the Nazis gained even more seats in the July 1932 elections—with 230 of 608 seats they were the largest party in the Reichstag—Pacelli again advised the Centre Party to work with the Nazis in a coalition, despite the official condemnation of Nazism by the German bishops at the time. He told Bavarian envoy Ritter: &quot;it is to be hoped and desired that, like the Centre Party and the Bavarian Peoples' Party, so too the other parties which stand on Christian principles and which now also include the National Socialist party, now the strongest party in the Reichstag, will use every means to hold off the cultural Bolshevizing of Germany, which is on the march behind the Communist Party.&quot;<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<p>According to Klaus Scholder, such a concordat was impossible prior to the rise of the Nazis because the Catholic parties in the <a href="Weimar_Republic" title="wikilink">Weimar Republic</a> could not overcome Protestant and socialist opposition.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
<p>According to Vice-Chancellor <a href="Franz_von_Papen" title="wikilink">Franz von Papen</a>, the new German cabinet began to talk about a concordat &quot;immediately after 30 January, 1933,&quot; the day that Hitler was appointed chancellor of the coalition government.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a>. Centre Party chairman <a href="Ludwig_Kaas" title="wikilink">Ludwig Kaas</a> (a priest and associate of Pacelli) agreed to support the <a href="Enabling_Act" title="wikilink">Enabling Act</a>, which required a constitutional amendment and gave Hitler dictatorial powers, in exchange for a Reich concordat with the Vatican.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a><a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> One of Hitler's key conditions for agreeing the concordat had been the dissolution of the Centre Party, which occurred on 6th July.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a></p>
<p>Between 1933 to 1939, Pacelli would issue 55 protests of violations of the <em>Reichskonkordat</em>. Most notably, early in 1937, Pacelli asked several German cardinals, including <a href="Michael_Cardinal_von_Faulhaber" title="wikilink">Michael Cardinal von Faulhaber</a> to help him write a protest of Nazi violations of the <em>Reichskonkordat</em>, which would become Pius XI's encyclical <em><a href="Mit_Brennender_Sorge" title="wikilink">Mit Brennender Sorge</a></em>, promulgated on <a href="Palm_Sunday" title="wikilink">Palm Sunday</a> 1937, condemning <a href="racism" class="uri" title="wikilink">racism</a> and <a href="statism" class="uri" title="wikilink">statism</a>.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>

The morning after Pius XII's election, the Berlin Morgenpost reported: &quot;The election of Cardinal Pacelli is not accepted with favor in Germany because he was always opposed to Nazism and practically determined the policies of the Vatican under his predecessor.&quot; <a href="Das_Schwarze_Korps" title="wikilink">Das Schwarze Korps</a>, the official publication of the <a href="Schutzstaffel" title="wikilink">SS</a>, said: &quot;As nuncio and secretary of state, Eugenio Pacelli had little understanding of us; little hope is placed in him.

<h3 id="theology">Theology</h3>
<p>Pope Pius XII accepted the <a href="Rhythm_Method" title="wikilink">Rhythm Method</a> as a moral form of <a href="family_planning" title="wikilink">family planning</a>, although only in limited circumstances, in two speeches on October 29, 1951, and November 26, 1951. (These speeches were translated into English and published under the title <em>Moral Questions Affecting Married Life.</em>) Some had controversially interpreted <a href="Pope_Pius_XI" title="wikilink">Pope Pius XI</a>'s 1930 encyclical <em><a href="Casti_Connubii" title="wikilink">Casti Connubii</a></em> to allow moral use of Rhythm, but these speeches by Pope Pius XII were the first explicit acceptance of any method of birth regulation aside from complete <a href="sexual_abstinence" title="wikilink">sexual abstinence</a>. The Catholic Church's modern view on family planning was further developed in the 1968 encyclical <em><a href="Humanae_Vitae" title="wikilink">Humanae Vitae</a></em> by <a href="Pope_Paul_VI" title="wikilink">Pope Paul VI</a>.</p>
<p>Pius was an energetic proponent of the theory of the <a href="Big_Bang" title="wikilink">Big Bang</a>. As he told the <a href="Pontifical_Academy_of_Sciences" title="wikilink">Pontifical Academy of Sciences</a> in 1951: &quot;...it would seem that present-day science, with one sweep back across the centuries, has succeeded in bearing witness to the august instant of the primordial Fiat Lux [Let there be Light], when along with matter, there burst forth from nothing a sea of light and radiation, and the elements split and churned and formed into millions of galaxies.&quot;<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a></p>

<p>Pius is one of few popes in recent history to exercise his <a href="Papal_Infallibility" title="wikilink">Papal Infallibility</a> by issuing, on <a href="November_1" title="wikilink">November 1</a> <a href="1950" class="uri" title="wikilink">1950</a> an <a href="apostolic_constitution" title="wikilink">apostolic constitution</a>, <em><a href="Munificentissimus_Deus" title="wikilink">Munificentissimus Deus</a></em>, which defines <em><a href="ex_cathedra" title="wikilink">ex cathedra</a></em> the <a href="dogma" class="uri" title="wikilink">dogma</a> of the <a href="Assumption_of_Mary" title="wikilink">Assumption</a> of the <a href="Blessed_Virgin_Mary" title="wikilink">Blessed Virgin Mary</a> into <a href="heaven" class="uri" title="wikilink">heaven</a>.

<p>His other apostolic constitutions are <em>Sponsa Christi</em> (November 21, 1950), <em>Bis Saeculari Die</em> (September 27, 1948), and <em>Provida Mater Ecclesia</em> (February 2, 1947).</p>
<h4 id="encyclicals">Encyclicals</h4>

<p><em><a href="Summi_Pontificatus" title="wikilink">Summi Pontificatus</a></em>, Pius's first <a href="encyclical" class="uri" title="wikilink">encyclical</a>, promulgated in 1939 condemned the &quot;ever-increasing host of Christ's enemies.&quot;</p>
<p><em><a href="Humani_Generis" title="wikilink">Humani Generis</a></em>, promulgated in 1950, acknowledged that <a href="evolution" class="uri" title="wikilink">evolution</a> might accurately describe the biological origins of human life, but at the same time criticized those who &quot;imprudently and indiscreetly hold that evolution... explains the origin of all things&quot;. The encyclical reiterated the Church's teaching that, whatever the physical origins of human beings, the human soul was directly created by God.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> While <em>Humani Generis</em> was significant as the first occasion on which a pope explicitly addressed the topic of evolution at length, it did not represent a change in doctrine for the <a href="Catholic_Church" title="wikilink">Catholic Church</a>. As early as 1868, Cardinal <a href="John_Henry_Newman" title="wikilink">John Henry Newman</a> wrote, &quot;the theory of Darwin, true or not, is not necessarily atheistic; on the contrary, it may simply be suggesting a larger idea of divine providence and skill.&quot;<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a></p>
<p><a href="John_Paul_II" title="wikilink">Pope John Paul II</a> went further in acknowledging the success of evolutionary theory in his 1996 <a href="http://www.ncseweb.org/resources/articles/8712_message_from_the_pope_1996_1_3_2001.asp"><em>Message to Pontifical Academy of Sciences</em></a>.

<h4 id="canonizations-and-beatifications">Canonizations and Beatifications</h4>

<h3 id="great-consistory">Great Consistory</h3>
<p>Only twice in his pontificate did Pius XII hold a <a href="consistory" class="uri" title="wikilink">consistory</a> to create new cardinals, a decided contrast to Pius XI, who had done so seventeen times in seventeen years on the papal throne. The first occasion has been known as the &quot;Great Consistory&quot;, of February 1946; it was the largest in the history of the Church up to that time, and brought an end to over five hundred years of Italians constituting a majority of the College. By his appointments then and in 1953 he substantially reduced the proportion of cardinals who belonged to the <a href="Roman_Curia" title="wikilink">Roman Curia</a>.</p>
<p>Earlier in 1945 Pius XII had dispensed with the complicated <a href="papal_conclave" title="wikilink">papal conclave</a> procedures which attempted to ensure secrecy while preventing Cardinals from voting for themselves, compensating for this change by raising the requisite majority from two-thirds to two thirds plus one.</p>

<p>Pius XII's pontificate began on the eve of the <a href="World_War_II" title="wikilink">Second World War</a>. During the war, the Pope followed a policy of neutrality mirroring that of <a href="Pope_Benedict_XV" title="wikilink">Pope Benedict XV</a> during the <a href="World_War_I" title="wikilink">First World War</a>.</p>
<p>On <a href="18_January" title="wikilink">18 January</a> <a href="1940" class="uri" title="wikilink">1940</a>, after over 15,000 Polish civilians had been killed, Pius XII said in a radio broadcast, &quot;The horror and inexcusable excesses committed on a helpless and a homeless people have been established by the unimpeachable testimony of eye-witnesses.&quot;<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a></p>
<p>After the Nazis invaded the small nations of the Netherlands, Luxembourg, and Belgium during 1940, Pius XII sent expressions of sympathy to the Queen of the Netherlands, the King of Belgium, and the Grand Duchess of Luxembourg. When the Italian Fascist dictator Mussolini learned of the warnings and the telegrams of sympathy, he took them as a personal affront and had his ambassador to the Vatican file an official protest, charging that Pius XII had taken sides against Italy's ally Germany. In any case, Mussolini's foreign minister claimed that Pius XII was &quot;ready to let himself be deported to a concentration camp, rather than do anything against his conscience.&quot;<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a>.</p>
<p>In the spring of 1940, a group of German generals seeking to overthrow Hitler and make peace with the English approached Pope Pius XII, who acted as a negotiator between the British and the abortive plot.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a></p>
<p>In April 1941 Pius XII granted a private audience to <a href="Ante_Paveli&lt;U+0107&gt;" title="wikilink">Ante Paveli&lt;U+0107&gt;</a>, the leader of the <a href="Independent_State_of_Croatia" title="wikilink">newly proclaimed Croatian state</a> (rather than the diplomatic audience Paveli&lt;U+0107&gt; had wanted).<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> Pius was criticised for his reception of Paveli&lt;U+0107&gt;: an unattributed British <a href="Foreign_Office" title="wikilink">Foreign Office</a> memo on the subject described Pius as &quot;the greatest moral coward of our age&quot;.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> The Vatican did not officially recognise Paveli&lt;U+0107&gt;'s regime.

<p>In 1941, Pius XII interpreted <em><a href="Divini_Redemptoris" title="wikilink">Divini Redemptoris</a></em>, an <a href="encyclical" class="uri" title="wikilink">encyclical</a> of <a href="Pope_Pius_XI" title="wikilink">Pope Pius XI</a>, which forbade <a href="Catholics" class="uri" title="wikilink">Catholics</a> to help <a href="Communists" class="uri" title="wikilink">Communists</a>, as not applying to military assistance to the <a href="Soviet_Union" title="wikilink">Soviet Union</a>.

<p>In March 1942, Pius XII established diplomatic relations with the <a href="Japanese_Empire" title="wikilink">Japanese Empire</a>. In May 1942, Kazimierz Pap&lt;U+00E9&gt;e, Polish ambassador to the Vatican, complained that Pius had failed to condemn the recent wave of atrocities in Poland; when Cardinal Secretary of State Maglione replied that the Vatican could not document individual atrocities, Pap&lt;U+00E9&gt;e declared, &quot;when something becomes notorious, proof is not required.&quot;<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a></p>
<p>Pius XII's famous <a href="Christmas" class="uri" title="wikilink">Christmas</a> broadcast on the <a href="Vatican_Radio" title="wikilink">Vatican Radio</a> delivered December 24, 1942—which at 26 pages and over 5000 words took more than 45 minutes to deliver—remains a &quot;lightning rod&quot; in debates about Pope Pius XII during the war, particularly the Holocaust.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> The majority of the speech spoke generally about human rights and civil society; at the very end of the speech, Pius seems to turn to current events, albeit not specifically, referring to &quot;all who during the war have lost their Fatherland and who, although personally blameless, have simply on account of their nationality and origin, been killed or reduced to utter destitution.&quot;<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a></p>
<p>As the war was approaching its end in 1945, Pius advocated a lenient policy by the <a href="Allies_of_World_War_II" title="wikilink">Allied</a> leaders in an effort to prevent what he perceived to be the mistakes made at the end of <a href="World_War_I" title="wikilink">World War I</a>.</p>

The pope's appointment of two Jews to the Vatican Academy of Science as well as the hiring of Almagia were reported by the New York Times in the editions of November 11, 1939, and January 10, 1940.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a><img src="TheConcordat.jpg" title="fig:The Concordat by Fritz Hirschberger, a Holocaust survivor, illustrates the view that the Reichskonkordat made the church complicit in The Holocaust" alt="The Concordat by Fritz Hirschberger, a Holocaust survivor, illustrates the view that the Reichskonkordat made the church complicit in The Holocaust" /></p>

<p>On April 30, 1943, Pius wrote to Archbishop Von Preysing of Berlin to say : &quot;We give to the pastors who are working on the local level the duty of determining if and to what degree the danger of reprisals and of various forms of oppression occasioned by episcopal declarations...seem to advise caution....The Holy See has done whatever was in its power, with charitable, financial and moral assistance.

<p>In March 1944, through the <a href="papal_nuncio" title="wikilink">papal nuncio</a> in <a href="Budapest" class="uri" title="wikilink">Budapest</a>, Angelo Rotta urged the <a href="Hungarian" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hungarian</a> government to moderate its treatment of the Jews.<a href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a> These protests, along with others from the King of Sweden, the International Red Cross, the United States, and Britain led to the cessation of deportations on <a href="8_July" title="wikilink">8 July</a>, <a href="1944" class="uri" title="wikilink">1944</a>.<a href="#fn72" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref72"><sup>72</sup></a> Also in 1944, Pius appealed to 13 Latin American governments to accept &quot;emergency passports&quot;, although it also took the intervention of the U.S. State Department for those countries to honor the documents.<a href="#fn73" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref73"><sup>73</sup></a></p>
<p>When the church transferred 6,000 Jewish children in Bulgaria to Palestine, <a href="Cardinal_Secretary_of_State" title="wikilink">Cardinal Secretary of State</a> Maglione reiterated that the Holy See was not a supporter of <a href="Zionism" class="uri" title="wikilink">Zionism</a>.<a href="#fn74" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref74"><sup>74</sup></a></p>
<p>On September 21, 1945, the general secretary of the <a href="World_Jewish_Council" title="wikilink">World Jewish Council</a>, Dr. Leon Kubowitzky, presented some money to the pope, &quot;in recognition of the work of the Holy See in rescuing Jews from Fascist and Nazi persecutions.&quot;<a href="#fn75" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref75"><sup>75</sup></a></p>
<p>In the autumn of 1945, Harry Greenstein from Baltimore, a close friend of Chief Rabbi Herzog of Jerusalem, told Pius how grateful Jews were for all he had done for them. &quot;My only regret,&quot; the pope replied, &quot;is not to have been able to save a greater number of Jews.&quot;<a href="#fn76" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref76"><sup>76</sup></a></p>

<p>Pius's anti-Communist activities became more potent following the war. In 1948, Pius declared that any Italian Catholic who supported Communist candidates in the parliamentary elections of that year would be <a href="excommunicated" class="uri" title="wikilink">excommunicated</a> and also encouraged <a href="Azione_Cattolica" title="wikilink">Azione Cattolica</a> to support the Italian Christian Democratic Party.

<p>After the war, Pius also became an outspoken advocate of clemency and forgiveness for all, including war criminals. He also applied pressure through his <a href="United_States" title="wikilink">U.S.</a> <a href="nuncio" class="uri" title="wikilink">nuncio</a> to commute the sentences of Germans convicted by the occupation authorities. The Vatican also asked for a blanket pardon for all those who had received death sentences, after the ban on execution of war criminals was lifted in 1948.<a href="#fn78" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref78"><sup>78</sup></a></p>
<p>Pius concluded concordats with <a href="Francisco_Franco" title="wikilink">Francisco Franco</a>'s <a href="Spain" class="uri" title="wikilink">Spain</a> in 1953 and <a href="Rafael_Le&lt;U+00F3&gt;nidas_Trujillo" title="wikilink">Rafael Trujillo</a>'s <a href="Dominican_Republic" title="wikilink">Dominican Republic</a> in 1954. In both countries , the rights of the Catholic Church had been violated by repressive regimes. Pius would also excommunicate <a href="Juan_Per&lt;U+00F3&gt;n" title="wikilink">Juan Per&lt;U+00F3&gt;n</a> in 1955 for his arrests of church officials.<a href="#fn79" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref79"><sup>79</sup></a></p>
<p>In 2005, <em><a href="Corriere_della_Sera" title="wikilink">Corriere della Sera</a></em> published a document dated <a href="20_November" title="wikilink">20 November</a>, <a href="1946" class="uri" title="wikilink">1946</a>, ordering Jewish children in France, who had been baptized by Catholics during the war, should be kept in the custody of the Church; the document stated that the decision &quot;has been approved by the Holy Father.&quot; <a href="Pope_John_XXIII" title="wikilink">Angelo Roncalli</a> (who would become <a href="Pope_John_XXIII" title="wikilink">Pope John XXIII</a>) ignored this directive.<a href="#fn80" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref80"><sup>80</sup></a> Two Italian scholars, Matteo Luigi Napolitano and Andrea Tornielli, confirmed that the memorandum was genuine although the initial reporting by the <em>Coriere della Sera</em> was misleading, as the document had originated in the French Catholic Church archives rather than the Vatican archives.<a href="#fn81" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref81"><sup>81</sup></a> <a href="Abe_Foxman" title="wikilink">Abe Foxman</a>, the national director of the <a href="Anti-Defamation_League" title="wikilink">Anti-Defamation League</a> (ADL), called for an immediate freeze on Pius's beatification process until the relevant <a href="Vatican_Secret_Archives" title="wikilink">Vatican Secret Archives</a> and baptismal records were opened.

<p><img src="Pacelli.jpg" title="fig:Pope Pius XII at the start of his lying-in-state." alt="Pope Pius XII at the start of his lying-in-state." /> Pius was dogged with ill health later in life, largely due to a <a href="charlatan" class="uri" title="wikilink">charlatan</a>, <a href="Riccardo_Galeazzi-Lisi" title="wikilink">Riccardo Galeazzi-Lisi</a>, whom Pius made an honorary member of the <a href="Pontifical_Academy_of_Sciences" title="wikilink">Pontifical Academy of Sciences</a>. Pius suffered from <a href="gastritis" class="uri" title="wikilink">gastritis</a> brought on by kidney dysfunctions. Galeazzi-Lisi, with the aid of a Swiss colleague, prescribed injections made from the glands of fetal lambs that gave Pius chronic <a href="hiccup" title="wikilink">hiccups</a> and rotting teeth.<a href="#fn83" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref83"><sup>83</sup></a><a href="#fn84" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref84"><sup>84</sup></a></p>
<p>The role of <a href="Pasqualina_Lehnert" title="wikilink">Sister Pasqualina Lehnert</a>—who had served Pacelli since he was <a href="nuncio" class="uri" title="wikilink">nuncio</a> to <a href="Bavaria" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bavaria</a>—also became controversial as Pius fell under ill-health. Many—including Pius's family members who called her <em>scaltrissima</em> (<a href="Italian_language" title="wikilink">Italian</a> for &quot;very cunning&quot;) and asked Pius to dismiss her from the <a href="Prefecture_for_the_Pontifical_Household" title="wikilink">Prefecture for the Pontifical Household</a>—distrusted the level of influence she allegedly had, including controlling access to the ailing pope. Most notably, many in the <a href="curia" class="uri" title="wikilink">curia</a> speculated that she convinced Pius to deny a <a href="Cardinal_(Catholicism)" title="wikilink">cardinalate</a> to <a href="Pope_Paul_VI" title="wikilink">Archbishop Giovanni Montini</a> (who later became Pope Paul VI), thus making him ineligible for the <a href="Papal_conclave,_1958" title="wikilink">1958 papal conclave</a>.<a href="#fn85" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref85"><sup>85</sup></a> Montini was the first person appointed cardinal by <a href="Pope_John_XXIII" title="wikilink">Pope John XXIII</a>, Pius's eventual successor.</p>
<p>Pius died on <a href="October_9" title="wikilink">October 9</a>, <a href="1958" class="uri" title="wikilink">1958</a> in <a href="Castel_Gandolfo" title="wikilink">Castel Gandolfo</a>, the papal summer residence. Galeazzi-Lisi gained admittance as the pope lay dying and took photographs of Pius which he sold to magazines, forcing him to resign as head of the Vatican medical services in the wake of massive public protests.</p>
<p>When Pius died, Galeazzi-Lisi assumed the role of Pius' <a href="embalm" title="wikilink">embalmer</a>. Rather than slow the process of decay, the doctor-mortician's self-made technique (<em>aromatizazzione</em>), which involved encasing Pius in a <a href="cellophane" class="uri" title="wikilink">cellophane</a> bag with <a href="herbs" class="uri" title="wikilink">herbs</a> and <a href="spices" class="uri" title="wikilink">spices</a>, sped it up, causing the Holy Father's corpse to disintegrate rapidly, turning purple, with the nose falling off. It is reported that while transporting the pope's body from Castel Gandolfo to the Vatican, pressure within the coffin due to gases given off by decay blew off the seals.<a href="#fn86" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref86"><sup>86</sup></a> The stench caused by the decay was such that guards had to be rotated every 15 minutes; otherwise they would collapse. The condition of the body became so bad that the remains were secretly removed at one point for further treatments before being returned in the morning. This caused considerable embarrassment to the <a href="Holy_See" title="wikilink">Vatican</a> and one of the first acts of Pius' successor, <a href="Pope_John_XXIII" title="wikilink">Pope John XXIII</a>, was to ban the charlatan from Vatican City for life.<a href="#fn87" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref87"><sup>87</sup></a></p>
<p>The Italian Medical Council expelled Galeazzi-Lisi for &quot;infamous conduct&quot; but the High Court of the Italian Central Health Commission reversed the decision.<a href="#fn88" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref88"><sup>88</sup></a></p>
<p>On <a href="September_2" title="wikilink">September 2</a>, <a href="2000" class="uri" title="wikilink">2000</a>. during the pontificate of <a href="Pope_John_Paul_II" title="wikilink">Pope John Paul II</a>, Pius's cause for <a href="canonization" class="uri" title="wikilink">canonization</a> was elevated to the level of <a href="Venerable" class="uri" title="wikilink">Venerable</a>. Rome's Chief Rabbi <a href="Elio_Toaff" title="wikilink">Elio Toaff</a> also began promoting the cause of Pius to receive such posthumous recognition from <a href="Yad_Vashem" title="wikilink">Yad Vashem</a> as a &quot;righteous gentile&quot;. The <a href="Boy_Scouts_of_America" title="wikilink">Boy Scouts of America</a> named the highest Catholic Award after him.</p>
<h2 id="views-interpretations-and-scholarship">Views, interpretations, and scholarship</h2>
<h3 id="contemporary">Contemporary</h3>
<p>During the war, the pope was widely praised for making a principled stand. For example, Time Magazine credited Pius XII and the Catholic Church for &quot;fighting totalitarianism more knowingly, devoutly, and authoritatively, and for a longer time, than any other organized power&quot;<a href="#fn89" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref89"><sup>89</sup></a> Some early works echoed these favorable sentiments, including Oskar Halecki's <em>Pius XII: Eugenio Pacelli: Pope of peace</em> (1954) and Nazareno Padellaro's <em>Portrait of Pius XII</em> (1949). Many Jews publicly thanked the pope for his help. For example, <a href="Pinchas_Lapide" title="wikilink">Pinchas Lapide</a>, a Jewish theologian and Israeli diplomat to Milan in the 1960s, estimated that Pius &quot;was instrumental in saving at least 700,000 but probably as many as 860,000 Jews from certain death at Nazi hands.&quot; Some historians have questioned these figures. Kevin Madigan interprets this and other praise from prominent Jewish leaders, including <a href="Golda_Meir" title="wikilink">Golda Meir</a>, as an attempt to secure Vatican recognition of the <a href="Israel" title="wikilink">State of Israel</a>.<a href="#fn90" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref90"><sup>90</sup></a></p>
<p>Pius was also criticized during his lifetime. For example, <a href="Leon_Poliakov" title="wikilink">Leon Poliakov</a> wrote five years after <a href="World_War_II" title="wikilink">World War II</a> that Pius had been a tacit supporter of <a href="Vichy_France" title="wikilink">Vichy France</a>'s anti-Semitic laws, calling him &quot;less forthright&quot; than <a href="Pope_Pius_XI" title="wikilink">Pope Pius XI</a> either out of &quot;Germanophilia&quot; or the hope that Hitler would defeat communist Russia.<a href="#fn91" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref91"><sup>91</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="the-deputy"><em>The Deputy</em></h3>

<p>In 1963, Pius XII's role during <a href="World_War_II" title="wikilink">World War II</a> became a source of controversy with the publication of <a href="Rolf_Hochhuth" title="wikilink">Rolf Hochhuth</a>'s controversial drama <em>Der Stellvertreter. Ein christliches Trauerspiel</em> (<em>The Deputy, a Christian tragedy</em>, released in English in 1964), which portrayed Pope Pius XII as a hypocrite who remained silent about the <a href="Holocaust" class="uri" title="wikilink">Holocaust</a>. Books such as Dr. Joseph Lichten's <em>A Question of Judgment</em> (1963), written in response to <em>The Deputy</em>, defended Pius XII's actions during the war. Lichten labelled any criticism of the pope's actions during World War II as &quot;a stupefying paradox&quot; and said, &quot;no one who reads the record of Pius XII's actions on behalf of Jews can subscribe to Hochhuth's accusation.&quot; Critical scholarly works like Guenther Lewy's <em>The Catholic Church and Nazi Germany</em> (1964) also followed the publication of <em>The Deputy</em>.</p>
<h3 id="actes"><em>Actes</em></h3>

<p>In the aftermath of the controversy surrounding <em>The Deputy</em>, in 1964 <a href="Pope_Paul_VI" title="wikilink">Pope Paul VI</a> authorized four Jesuit scholars to access the <a href="Vatican_Secret_Archives" title="wikilink">Vatican's secret archives</a>, which are normally not opened for seventy-five years. A selected collection of primary sources, <em><a href="Actes_et_Documents_du_Saint_Si&lt;U+00E8&gt;ge_relatifs_&lt;U+00E0&gt;_la_Seconde_Guerre_Mondiale" title="wikilink">Actes et Documents du Saint Si&lt;U+00E8&gt;ge relatifs &lt;U+00E0&gt; la Seconde Guerre Mondiale</a></em>, was published in eleven volumes between 1965 and 1981. The <em>Actes</em> documents are not translated from their original language (mostly <a href="Italian_language" title="wikilink">Italian</a>) and the volume introductions are in <a href="French_language" title="wikilink">French</a>. Only one volume has been translated into <a href="English_language" title="wikilink">English</a>.</p>
<p>Notable documents not included in the <em>Actes</em> include most of the letters from Bishop Konrad Preysing of Berlin to Pope Pius XII in 1943 and 1944, the papers of Austrian bishop <a href="Alois_Hudal" title="wikilink">Alois Hudal</a>, and virtually everything appertaining to <a href="Eastern_Europe" title="wikilink">Eastern Europe</a>.<a href="#fn92" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref92"><sup>92</sup></a> <a href="Saul_Friedlander" title="wikilink">Saul Friedlander</a>'s <em>Pope Pius and the Third Reich: A Documentation</em> (1966) did not cite the <em>Actes</em> and drew instead on unpublished diplomatic documents from German embassies. Most later historical works, however, draw heavily on the <em>Actes</em>.</p>
<h3 id="hitlers-pope"><em>Hitler's Pope</em></h3>

<p><img src="hitlerspope.jpg" title="fig:The cover of Hitler&#39;s Pope, showing Nuncio Pacelli leaving the residence of President Hindenburg in 1927." alt="The cover of Hitler&#39;s Pope, showing Nuncio Pacelli leaving the residence of President Hindenburg in 1927." /> In 1999, <a href="John_Cornwell_(writer)" title="wikilink">John Cornwell's</a> <em><a href="Hitler&#39;s_Pope" title="wikilink">Hitler's Pope</a></em> criticized Pius for not doing enough, or speaking out enough, against the Holocaust. Cornwell argues that Pius's entire career as the nuncio to Germany, cardinal secretary of state, and pope was characterized by a desire to increase and centralize the power of the Papacy, and that he subordinated opposition to the Nazis to that goal. He further argues that Pius was <a href="anti-Semitism" title="wikilink">anti-Semitic</a> and that this stance prevented him from caring about the European Jews.</p>
<p>Cornwell's work was the first to have access to testimonies from Pius's beatification process as well as to many documents from Pacelli's nunciature which had just been opened under the seventy-five year rule by the Vatican State Secretary archives.<a href="#fn93" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref93"><sup>93</sup></a> Cornwell concluded, &quot;Pacelli's failure to respond to the enormity of the Holocaust was more than a personal failure, it was a failure of the papal office itself and the prevailing culture of Catholicism.&quot;</p>
<p>Cornwell's work has received much praise and criticism. Much praise of Cornwell centered around his admission that he was a practising Catholic who had attempted to absolve Pius with his work.<a href="#fn94" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref94"><sup>94</sup></a> Works such as Susan Zuccotti's <em>Under His Very Windows: The Vatican and the Holocaust in Italy</em> (2000) and Michael Phayer's <em>The Catholic Church and the Holocaust, 1930&lt;U+2013&gt;1965</em> (2000) are critical of both Cornwell and Pius. Defenders of Pius have also criticized Cornwell. For example, Kenneth L. Woodward stated in his review in <em>Newsweek</em> that &quot;errors of fact and ignorance of context appear on almost every page.&quot;<a href="#fn95" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref95"><sup>95</sup></a> Cornwell himself gives a more ambiguous assessment of Pius' conduct in a 2004 interview where he states that &quot;Pius XII had so little scope of action that it is impossible to judge the motives for his silence during the war&quot;<a href="#fn96" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref96"><sup>96</sup></a> Most recently, <a href="David_G._Dalin" title="wikilink">Rabbi David Dalin's</a> <em><a href="The_Myth_of_Hitler&#39;s_Pope" title="wikilink">The Myth of Hitler's Pope</a></em> argued that critics of Pius were liberal Catholics who &quot;exploit the tragedy of the Jewish people during the Holocaust to foster their own political agenda of forcing changes on the Catholic Church today&quot; and that Pius XII was actually responsible for saving the lives of thousands of Jews.<a href="#fn97" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref97"><sup>97</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="icjhc">ICJHC</h3>

<p>In 1999, in an attempt to address some of this controversy, the Vatican appointed the <a href="International_Catholic-Jewish_Historical_Commission" title="wikilink">International Catholic-Jewish Historical Commission</a> (ICJHC), a group composed of three Jewish and three Catholic scholars to investigate the role of the Church during the Holocaust. In 2001, the ICJHC issued its preliminary finding, raising a number of questions about the way the Vatican dealt with the Holocaust, titled &quot; The Vatican and the Holocaust: A Preliminary Report.&quot; <a href="#fn98" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref98"><sup>98</sup></a></p>
<p>The Commission discovered documents making it clear that Pius was aware of widespread anti-Jewish persecution in 1941 and 1942, and they suspected that the Church may have been influenced in not helping Jewish immigration by the <em>nuncio</em> of Chile and the Papal representative to Bolivia, who complained about the &quot;invasion of the Jews&quot; to their countries, where they engaged in &quot;dishonest dealings, violence, immorality, and even disrespect for religion.&quot; (Questions 7 and 12 of the ICJHC report)</p>
<p>The ICJHC raised a list of 47 questions about the way the Church dealt with the Holocaust, requested documents that had not been publicly released in order to continue their work, and, not receiving permission, they disbanded in July of 2001, having never issued a final report. Dr. Michael Marrus, one of the three Jewish members of the Commission, said the commission &quot;ran up against a brick wall.... It would have been really helpful to have had support from the Holy See on this issue.&quot;<a href="#fn99" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref99"><sup>99</sup></a></p>
