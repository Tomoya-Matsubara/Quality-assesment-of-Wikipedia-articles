<p><strong>Morgellons</strong> (also called <strong>Morgellons disease</strong> or <strong>Morgellons syndrome</strong>), is a name given in 2002 by Mary Leitao<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> to a proposed condition referred to by the <a href="Centers_for_Disease_Control" title="wikilink">Centers for Disease Control</a> as <strong>unexplained dermopathy</strong> and characterized by a range of <a href="cutaneous" class="uri" title="wikilink">cutaneous</a> (skin) symptoms including crawling, biting, and stinging sensations; finding fibers on or under the skin; and persistent skin lesions (e.g., rashes or sores). Current <a href="scientific_consensus" title="wikilink">scientific consensus</a> holds that Morgellons is not a new disorder and is instead a new and misleading name for a well known condition. Most doctors,<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> including dermatologists<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> and psychiatrists,<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> regard Morgellons as a manifestation of known medical conditions, including <a href="delusional_parasitosis" title="wikilink">delusional parasitosis</a>.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a><a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a><a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p>Despite the lack of evidence that Morgellons is a novel or distinct condition and the absence of any agreed set of diagnostic symptoms,<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> the <a href="Morgellons_Research_Foundation" title="wikilink">Morgellons Research Foundation</a> and self-diagnosed Morgellons patients have successfully lobbied members of Congress and the U.S. government's <a href="Centers_for_Disease_Control_and_Prevention" title="wikilink">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a> (CDC) to investigate the proposed condition.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> The CDC states that while it is not known at present whether the condition represents a new disease entity, or whether persons who identify themselves as having Morgellons have a common cause for their symptoms, share common risk factors, or are contagious, it has begun an <a href="epidemiological" class="uri" title="wikilink">epidemiological</a> investigation of the &quot;Unexplained Dermopathy (aka 'Morgellons').&quot;<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>

<p>Leitao says that her son developed more sores, and more fibers continued to poke out of them.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a><a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> She and her husband, Edward Leitao, an internist with South Allegheny Internal Medicine in <a href="Pennsylvania" class="uri" title="wikilink">Pennsylvania</a>, felt their son suffered from &quot;something unknown.&quot;<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> She chose the name <em>Morgellons disease</em> (with a hard <em>g</em>) from a description of an illness in the monograph <em>A Letter to a Friend</em> by Sir <a href="Thomas_Browne" title="wikilink">Thomas Browne</a>, in 1690, wherein Browne describes several medical conditions in his experience, including &quot;that endemial distemper of children in <a href="Languedoc" class="uri" title="wikilink">Languedoc</a>, called the morgellons, wherein they critically break out with harsh hairs on their backs.&quot;<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a><a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> There is no suggestion that the symptoms described by Browne are linked to the alleged modern cases.</p>

<h3 id="media-coverage">Media coverage</h3>
<p>In May 2006, a CBS news segment on Morgellons aired in Southern California.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> The same day the Los Angeles County Department of Health services issued a statement saying, &quot;No credible medical or public health association has verified the existence or diagnosis of 'Morgellons Disease',&quot; and &quot;at this time there is no reason for individuals to panic over unsubstantiated reports of this disease.&quot;<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> In June and July 2006 there were segments on <a href="CNN" class="uri" title="wikilink">CNN</a>,<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> <a href="American_Broadcasting_Company" title="wikilink">ABC</a>'s <em><a href="Good_Morning_America" title="wikilink">Good Morning America</a></em>,<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> and <a href="NBC" class="uri" title="wikilink">NBC</a>'s <em><a href="Today_(NBC_program)" title="wikilink">The Today Show</a></em>. In August 2006, a segment of the ABC show <em>Medical Mysteries</em><a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> was devoted to the subject. The disease was featured on <a href="American_Broadcasting_Company" title="wikilink">ABC</a>'s <em><a href="Nightline_(US_news_program)" title="wikilink">Nightline</a></em> on January 16, 2008,<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> and as the cover story of the January 20, 2008 issue of the <em>Washington Post Magazine.</em><a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a></p>
<p>The first article to propose Morgellons as a new disease in a scientific journal was a review article co-authored by members of the MRF and published in 2006 by the <em>American Journal of Clinical Dermatology</em>.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> An article in the <em><a href="San_Francisco_Chronicle" title="wikilink">San Francisco Chronicle</a></em> reported, &quot;There have been no clinical studies&quot; (of Morgellons disease).<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> A <em><a href="New_Scientist" title="wikilink">New Scientist</a></em> article in 2007 also covered the phenomenon noting that people are reporting similar symptoms in Europe and Australia.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a></p>

<p>A <a href="Centers_for_Disease_Control_and_Prevention" title="wikilink">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a> (CDC) task force first met in June 2006.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> In July 2006, Dan Rutz, MPH, a communications specialist for the CDC, said, &quot;We're not ready to concede there's a new disease, but the volume of concern has stepped up because a lot of people are writing or calling their congressmen about it.&quot;<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> By August 2006, the task force consisted of 12 people, including two pathologists, a toxicologist, an ethicist, a mental health expert and specialists in infectious, parasitic, environmental and chronic diseases.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> In May 2007, <a href="KGW-TV" class="uri" title="wikilink">KGW-TV</a> <a href="Newschannel" class="uri" title="wikilink">Newschannel</a> 8's Laural Porter asked Rutz if he had any information about the nature of the fibers. At that time Rutz said, &quot;None. We don't know. We haven't studied them in a lab yet. There is nothing to imply there is [an infectious process], but our mind is open to everything, including that remote possibility.&quot; Since then, the CDC has launched a funded study (see below) that will include further examination of fibers taken from Morgellons lesions by the CDC.</p>
<p>In June 2007, the CDC opened a website on &quot;Unexplained Dermopathy (aka 'Morgellons')&quot;.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> By November 2007, the CDC had announced an investigation process, stating that, &quot;The primary goals of the investigation are to better describe the clinical and epidemiologic features of this condition and to generate hypotheses about possible risk factors.&quot;<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a> <a href="Kaiser_Permanente" title="wikilink">Kaiser Permanente</a> in Northern California was chosen to assist with investigation, which will begin when the scientific protocols and review board structure have been prepared and approved. Investigators will report on the geographic distribution of the illness and estimate rates of illness in affected communities. The investigation will involve skin biopsies from affected patients and characterization of foreign material such as fibers or threads obtained from patients to determine their potential source.<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a><a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a> In January 2008 it was reported that CDC was enlisting the aid of the U.S. Armed Forces Institute of Pathology and the American Academy of Dermatology &quot;to conduct 'immediate' and 'rigorous' research.&quot;<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a></p>
<p>Following a mailing campaign coordinated by the Morgellons Research Foundation in which &quot;self-described sufferers clicked on the foundation Web site and sent thousands of form letters to members of Congress,&quot;<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a> the CDC, in conjunction with Kaiser Permanente's Northern California Division of Research, launched a study of the unexplained skin condition known as Morgellons. A press conference was held on Jan 16, 2008, with Michele Pearson, principal investigator for the CDC, and Joe Selby, Director of Kaiser Permanente's Northern California Division of Research.<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a> During the press conference, Pearson stated: &quot;What I can tell you is real is the suffering that these patients are experiencing. I cannot characterize this as a syndrome, as disease. I can tell you it's an unexplained illness.&quot; Clinical examinations for the study will be done in <a href="Oakland,_California" title="wikilink">Oakland, California</a>.</p>
<p>On 4 November 2009, the CDC issued a preliminary report based on an external peer review of the project. The report stated that &quot;Data collection has been completed and analysis is ongoing.&quot;<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a> This report also explained that any findings would most likely be published in a peer-reviewed scientific journal once data analysis is complete and results are available.</p>
<h2 id="symptoms-and-diagnosis">Symptoms and diagnosis</h2>
<p>Morgellons is not recognized as a unique disorder, so there is currently no list of symptoms or <a href="differential_diagnosis" title="wikilink">differential diagnosis</a> for Morgellons that is generally accepted by the medical community. Patients usually self-diagnose based on media reports and the internet.</p>
<p>The 2007 <em>Atlas of Human Parasitology</em> covers the proposed condition in its section on &quot;Pseudoparasites and Artifacts&quot;:</p>

<p>The main purported symptom of Morgellons is &quot;a fixed belief&quot; that fibers are embedded in or extruding from the skin.<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a> The Morgellons Research Foundation claims patients have reported additional&lt;U+2014&gt;though unsubstantiated&lt;U+2014&gt;symptoms<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a>, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="formication" class="uri" title="wikilink">formication</a>, the sensation of insects &quot;moving, stinging or biting&quot; beneath the skin</li>
<li>skin lesions, both spontaneous and self-inflicted</li>
<li>musculoskeletal effects and pain, including joints, muscles, tendons and connective tissue</li>
<li>disabling fatigue</li>
<li>cognitive and emotional effects</li>
</ul>
<p>William T. Harvey, director of the MRF medical advisory board, claimed in 2007 that Morgellons patients exhibit laboratory findings including increased levels of <a href="Inflammation" title="wikilink">inflammatory</a> <a href="cytokines" class="uri" title="wikilink">cytokines</a>, increased <a href="insulin" class="uri" title="wikilink">insulin</a>, and <a href="antibodies" class="uri" title="wikilink">antibodies</a> to three bacterial pathogens, but did not provide evidence for these claims.<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a> Many Morgellons patients have symptoms that are also consistent with <a href="chronic_fatigue_syndrome" title="wikilink">chronic fatigue syndrome</a>, <a href="Clinical_depression" title="wikilink">depression</a>, <a href="obsessive&lt;U+2013&gt;compulsive_disorder" title="wikilink">obsessive&lt;U+2013&gt;compulsive disorder</a>, and <a href="attention_deficit_disorder" title="wikilink">attention deficit disorder</a>.<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a> Rhonda Casey, chief of pediatrics at <a href="Oklahoma_State_University_Medical_Center" title="wikilink">OSU Medical Center</a>, while working with the <a href="Oklahoma_State_University_Center_for_Health_Sciences" title="wikilink">OSU-CHS</a> for the Investigation of Morgellons Disease, stated that her Morgellons patients looked ill with neurological symptoms, which included confusion, difficulty walking and controlling their feet (<a href="foot_drop" title="wikilink">foot drop</a>), and a sagging mouth when speaking.<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a> The OSU-CHS has issued a list of symptoms similar to that of the MRF.<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a></p>

<p>Most dermatologists, psychiatrists, and other medical professionals view Morgellons as a new name for a well established condition, <a href="delusional_parasitosis" title="wikilink">delusional parasitosis</a>,<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a> also known as &quot;delusions of parasitosis&quot; (DP or DOP) and <em>Ekbom's Syndrome</em>: Morgellons is &quot;a pattern of dermatologic symptoms very similar, if not identical, to those of delusions of parasitosis,&quot;<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a> and &quot;the vast majority&quot;<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a> (elsewhere, 95%)<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a> of Morgellons patients are diagnosed with delusional parasitosis or another psychosomatic illness. This explanation is, however, &quot;unpopular among individuals identifying themselves as having Morgellons disease.&quot;<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a></p>
<p>In delusional parasitosis, patients hold a delusional belief that they are infested with parasites. They may experience <a href="formication" class="uri" title="wikilink">formication</a>, a sensation similar to that of insects crawling on or under the skin. Individuals suffering from this condition may develop elaborate rituals of inspection and cleansing to locate and remove &quot;parasites&quot; and fibers, resulting in a form of self-mutilation; they injure themselves in attempts to be rid of the &quot;parasites&quot; by picking at the skin, causing <a href="lesion" title="wikilink">lesions</a>, and then pick at the lesions, preventing them from healing.<a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a> Patients with delusional parasitosis often present at the doctor's office with what MDs term the &quot;<a href="matchbox_sign" title="wikilink">matchbox sign</a>&quot;<a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a><a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a> -- a <a href="medical_sign" title="wikilink">medical sign</a> characterized by the patient making collections of fibers and other foreign objects supposedly retrieved from the skin<a href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a> -- and, because of &quot;unshakeable delusional ideation&quot;, strongly reject diagnoses that do not involve parasites.<a href="#fn67" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a><a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a> A significant minority of DP cases occur in groups of two, three, or more individuals in close proximity, even families, known by the French terms <em><a href="folie_&lt;U+00E0&gt;_deux" title="wikilink">folie &lt;U+00E0&gt; deux</a></em>, <em><a href="folie_&lt;U+00E0&gt;_trois" title="wikilink">folie &lt;U+00E0&gt; trois</a></em>, and <em><a href="folie_&lt;U+00E0&gt;_famille" title="wikilink">folie &lt;U+00E0&gt; famille</a></em>.<a href="#fn69" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref69"><sup>69</sup></a> Delusional parasitosis, with symptoms that have &quot;extraordinary similarities&quot; to Morgellons, has been described in the medical literature for over 75 years.<a href="#fn70" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a> Dr. Noah Craft, a dermatologist at the Harbor-<a href="UCLA" class="uri" title="wikilink">UCLA</a> Medical Center, <a href="Torrance,_California" title="wikilink">Torrance, CA</a>, has seen a handful of Morgellons patients and biopsied their skin lesions, but found only normal skin and inflammation, as one would find in a bump that has been picked at.<a href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a></p>
<p>Some cases of delusional parasitosis have organic causes other than those associated with neurological/psychological conditions of unknown etiology. For example, formication, the sensation that bugs are crawling under ones' skin, can be caused by allergies, <a href="diabetic_neuropathy" title="wikilink">diabetic neuropathy</a>, <a href="menopause" class="uri" title="wikilink">menopause</a>, <a href="skin_cancer" title="wikilink">skin cancer</a>, <a href="demodex" class="uri" title="wikilink">demodex</a> mites, stimulant drug abuse or <a href="herpes_zoster" title="wikilink">herpes zoster</a>.

<p>The MRF's William Harvey has written that non-healing &quot;Morgellons lesions&quot; have been found on infants' bodies in locations that the infants cannot themselves reach to scratch.<a href="#fn74" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref74"><sup>74</sup></a> In his letter to the editor, he does not provide evidence to support this claim.</p>
<p>Some cases of Morgellons have been diagnosed as &quot;cutaneous dysaesthesia&quot;.<a href="#fn75" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref75"><sup>75</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="role-of-the-internet">Role of the Internet</h3>
<p>Morgellons patients usually self-diagnose on the <a href="Internet" class="uri" title="wikilink">Internet</a> and find support and confirmation in on-line communities of people with similar illness beliefs.<a href="#fn76" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref76"><sup>76</sup></a><a href="#fn77" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref77"><sup>77</sup></a><a href="#fn78" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref78"><sup>78</sup></a> In 2006, Waddell and Burke reported the influence of the Internet on their self-diagnosed Morgellons patients: &quot;physicians are becoming more and more challenged by the many persons who attempt self-diagnosis on-line. In many cases, these attempts are well-intentioned, yet wrong, and a patient's belief in some of these oftentimes unscientific sites online may preclude their trust in the evidence-based approaches and treatment recommendations of their physician.&quot;<a href="#fn79" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref79"><sup>79</sup></a> Dermatologist Caroline Koblenzer specifically faults the MRF website for misleading patients: &quot;Clearly, as more and more of our patients discover this site (MRF), there will be an ever greater waste of valuable time and resources on fruitless research into fibers, fluffs, irrelevant bacteria, and innocuous worms and insects.&quot;<a href="#fn80" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref80"><sup>80</sup></a> Vila-Rodriguez and MacEwan said in the <em><a href="American_Journal_of_Psychiatry" title="wikilink">American Journal of Psychiatry</a></em> that the Internet is important in spreading and supporting &quot;bizarre&quot; disease beliefs, because &quot;a belief is not considered delusional if it is accepted by other members of an individual&lt;U+2019&gt;s culture or subculture.&quot;<a href="#fn81" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref81"><sup>81</sup></a></p>
<p>The <em>LA Times</em>, in an article on Morgellons, notes that &quot;(t)he recent upsurge in symptoms can be traced directly to the Internet, following the naming of the disease by Mary Leitao, a Pennsylvania mother.&quot;<a href="#fn82" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref82"><sup>82</sup></a> Robert Bartholomew, a sociologist who has studied the Morgellons phenomenon, states that the &quot;World Wide Web has become the incubator for mass delusion and it (Morgellons) seems to be a socially transmitted disease over the Internet.&quot; According to this hypothesis, patients with delusions of parasitosis and other psychological disorders become convinced they have &quot;Morgellons&quot; after reading internet accounts of others with similar symptoms.<a href="#fn83" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref83"><sup>83</sup></a><a href="#fn84" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref84"><sup>84</sup></a> A 2005 <em>Popular Mechanics</em> article stated that Morgellons symptoms are well-known and characterized in the context of other disorders, and that &quot;widespread reports of the strange fibers date back&quot; only a few years to when the MRF first described them on the Internet.<a href="#fn85" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref85"><sup>85</sup></a></p>
<p>The <em>Dallas Observer</em> writes that Morgellons may be spread via the Internet and mass media, and &quot;(i)f this is the case, then Morgellons is one in a long line of weird diseases that have swept through populations, only to disappear without a trace once public concern subsides.&quot;<a href="#fn86" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref86"><sup>86</sup></a> The article draws parallels to several mass media-spread mass delusions.

<p>Randy Wymore, a former research director of the MRF and presently director of the Oklahoma State University Center for Health Sciences' Center for the Investigation of Morgellons Disease, claims that Morgellons patients have masses of dark fibers visible at 60x magnification under the unbroken skin, while unaffected individuals do not.<a href="#fn90" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref90"><sup>90</sup></a> Wymore sent samples of fibers supplied by Morgellons patients to the Police Crime Lab in <a href="Tulsa,_Oklahoma" title="wikilink">Tulsa, Oklahoma</a>, for analysis. A forensic scientist at the Tulsa Police Crime Lab in Oklahoma searched the FBI's national database, but the Morgellons sample did not match any known fiber in the database.<a href="#fn91" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref91"><sup>91</sup></a> Lab director Mark Boese said the fibers were &quot;consistent with something that the body may be producing,&quot; adding, &quot;These fibers cannot be manmade and do not come from a plant. This could be a byproduct of a biological organism.&quot;<a href="#fn92" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref92"><sup>92</sup></a></p>
<p>Rhonda Casey, chief of pediatrics at Oklahoma State University Hospital and part of the MRF research team at OSU, claimed that she has examined many patients' skin via a <a href="dermatoscope" class="uri" title="wikilink">dermatoscope</a> and performed biopsies on both lesions and apparently healthy skin, and that &quot;she saw fibers embedded in both places. The white ones, she says, are hard to see. A dermatologist who either didn't look at all, or didn't use a dermatoscope, might not see them under the skin.&quot;<a href="#fn93" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref93"><sup>93</sup></a></p>
<p>Dermatologists say any fibers are from clothing embedded in self-imposed sores, and the fibers patients bring in bags, are textile in nature.<a href="#fn94" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref94"><sup>94</sup></a><a href="#fn95" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref95"><sup>95</sup></a> The fibers may also be peripheral nerve endings.<a href="#fn96" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref96"><sup>96</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="bacterial-hypothesis">Bacterial hypothesis</h3>
<p>Three members of the Morgellons Research Foundation, including Raphael Stricker, Director and former President of the International Lyme and Associated Diseases Society (ILADS), and Ginger Savely, also an ILADS member,<a href="#fn97" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref97"><sup>97</sup></a> authored an article about Morgellons published by the <em>American Journal of Clinical Dermatology</em> in early 2006. The authors wrote that &quot;Morgellons disease may be linked to an undefined infectious process,&quot; and reported that many patients with Morgellons disease have positive <a href="Western_blot" title="wikilink">Western blots</a> for <em><a href="Borrelia_burgdorferi" title="wikilink">Borrelia burgdorferi</a></em>, the causative agent of <a href="Lyme_disease" title="wikilink">Lyme disease</a>, and treatment with anti-bacterials appropriate for Lyme disease leads to remission of Morgellons symptoms in most patients;<a href="#fn98" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref98"><sup>98</sup></a> however, no methodology or clinical data are provided in support of any of these claims. Harvey, another member of ILADS, has also stated there is <a href="serology" title="wikilink">serological</a> evidence of bacterial pathogens in Morgellons patients, but did not provide any such evidence.<a href="#fn99" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref99"><sup>99</sup></a> Stricker, along with Citovsky, MRF board member from the <a href="State_University_of_New_York_at_Stony_Brook" title="wikilink">State University of New York at Stony Brook</a>, claimed that Morgellons skin fibers could come from <em><a href="Agrobacterium" class="uri" title="wikilink">Agrobacterium</a></em>, a plant-infecting organism known to induce cellulose fibers at infected sites within plant tissues.<a href="#fn100" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref100"><sup>100</sup></a> <em>Agrobacterium</em> is already known to be responsible for <a href="opportunistic_infection" title="wikilink">opportunistic infections</a> in humans with weakened <a href="immune_system" title="wikilink">immune systems</a>, but has not been shown to be a primary pathogen in otherwise healthy individuals.<a href="#fn101" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref101"><sup>101</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="environmental-toxins">Environmental toxins</h3>
<p>Richard Fagerlund, an entomologist who has a column titled &quot;Ask the Bugman&quot; in the <em><a href="San_Francisco_Chronicle" title="wikilink">San Francisco Chronicle</a></em> and <em><a href="Albuquerque_Journal" title="wikilink">Albuquerque Journal</a></em>, stated that he takes Morgellons disease seriously, and he receives letters from people with Morgellons symptoms daily. Twenty years ago, he got three to four letters like this a year. He believes the condition is reaching epidemic proportions and speculates only a small percentage of cases are delusional parasitosis, while the rest may be caused by something else, such as pollutants, especially <a href="pesticide" title="wikilink">pesticides</a>.<a href="#fn102" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref102"><sup>102</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="treatment">Treatment</h2>
<h3 id="treatment-for-delusional-parasitosis">Treatment for delusional parasitosis</h3>
<p>Many dermatologists treat Morgellons as delusional parasitosis. After a thorough medical examination to rule out known organic causes for the symptoms, delusional parasitosis patients are typically prescribed one of several <a href="typical_antipsychotic" title="wikilink">typical antipsychotic</a> drugs.<a href="#fn103" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref103"><sup>103</sup></a><a href="#fn104" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref104"><sup>104</sup></a> In the past, <a href="pimozide" class="uri" title="wikilink">pimozide</a> was the drug of choice; in addition to antipsychotic activity, it also has <a href="antipruritic" class="uri" title="wikilink">antipruritic</a> activity, meaning it inhibits the sensation of itching.<a href="#fn105" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref105"><sup>105</sup></a> However, pimozide requires frequent electrocardiographic monitoring.<a href="#fn106" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref106"><sup>106</sup></a> Currently, <a href="atypical_antipsychotic" title="wikilink">atypical antipsychotics</a> such as <a href="olanzapine" class="uri" title="wikilink">olanzapine</a> or <a href="risperidone" class="uri" title="wikilink">risperidone</a> are used as first line treatment.<a href="#fn107" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref107"><sup>107</sup></a> Antipsychotics are effective at treating delusional parasitosis at doses as low as one-fifth to one-tenth the dose typically prescribed for schizophrenia.<a href="#fn108" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref108"><sup>108</sup></a> It is common for patients who believe they have Morgellons to reject a physician's diagnosis of delusional parasitosis. It has been suggested that the term Morgellons should be adopted by dermatologists to enhance their <a href="rapport" class="uri" title="wikilink">rapport</a> with their patients, allowing them to overcome this resistance.<a href="#fn109" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref109"><sup>109</sup></a></p>
<p>A <em>Popular Mechanics</em> article described a dermatologist who would not allow the use of his name, citing &quot;concern for his safety.&quot; He said he has &quot;diagnosed 50 or so Morgellons patients&quot; with a disorder that can result in the sensation of insects, and &quot;typically puts a cast over the lesions to prevent further irritation and after four weeks removes it.&quot; According to the doctor, the patients' lesions heal under the cast.<a href="#fn110" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref110"><sup>110</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="treatment-for-infectious-disease">Treatment for infectious disease</h3>
<p>People who say they have Morgellons frequently reject the diagnosis of delusional parasitosis,<a href="#fn111" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref111"><sup>111</sup></a> &quot;report that their symptoms are not taken seriously,&quot;<a href="#fn112" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref112"><sup>112</sup></a> and refuse psychotropic medicine. Hypothesizing that Morgellons is the result of an infectious process, some medical practitioners associated with the MRF recommend the use of <a href="antibiotic" title="wikilink">antibiotics</a>, <a href="antifungal" title="wikilink">antifungals</a>, <a href="antiparasitic" class="uri" title="wikilink">antiparasitic</a> medications, herbal supplements, and light therapy.<a href="#fn113" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref113"><sup>113</sup></a><a href="#fn114" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref114"><sup>114</sup></a><a href="#fn115" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref115"><sup>115</sup></a><a href="#fn116" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref116"><sup>116</sup></a><a href="#fn117" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref117"><sup>117</sup></a><a href="#fn118" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref118"><sup>118</sup></a><a href="#fn119" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref119"><sup>119</sup></a> Randy Wymore, a former MRF director, has claimed on his website that some Morgellons patients who test positive for Lyme disease obtain symptom relief using aggressive, long-term antibiotic treatment similar to what is used by some doctors to treat <a href="Lyme_disease_controversy" title="wikilink">&quot;chronic&quot; Lyme disease</a>, another proposed but medically disputed condition.<a href="#fn120" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref120"><sup>120</sup></a> Virginia Savely, a nurse with the MRF and member of the International Lyme and Associated Diseases Society (ILADS), claims to have similar unpublished results.<a href="#fn121" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref121"><sup>121</sup></a> The antibiotic treatment is not curative, because when it is discontinued, the symptoms return.<a href="#fn122" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref122"><sup>122</sup></a> Dermatologists say that these positive effects of antibiotic use for some patients are likely the result of a placebo effect or anti-inflammatory actions of the drugs. They advise against prescribing antibiotics, which may reinforce the patients' delusions instead of addressing what these doctors consider the core problem: delusional parasitosis.<a href="#fn123" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref123"><sup>123</sup></a> In addition, long-term antibiotic use can have serious side effects.</p>
<h3 id="self-treatment">Self-treatment</h3>
<p>Persons with Morgellons symptoms may turn to alternative remedies described on web sites and discussion groups. Some treatments are dangerous, however, and have included the use of bleach, veterinary medicines intended for deworming horses, and industrial insecticides.<a href="#fn124" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref124"><sup>124</sup></a></p>
