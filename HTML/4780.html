<p><strong>Rogers Hornsby, Sr.</strong> (April 27, 1896 &lt;U+2013&gt; January 5, 1963), nicknamed <strong>&quot;The Rajah&quot;</strong>, was an American <a href="baseball" class="uri" title="wikilink">baseball</a> <a href="infielder" class="uri" title="wikilink">infielder</a>, <a href="manager_(baseball)" title="wikilink">manager</a>, and <a href="coach_(baseball)" title="wikilink">coach</a> who played 23 seasons in <a href="Major_League_Baseball" title="wikilink">Major League Baseball</a> (MLB). He played for the <a href="St._Louis_Cardinals" title="wikilink">St. Louis Cardinals</a> (1915&lt;U+2013&gt;1926, 1933), <a href="San_Francisco_Giants" title="wikilink">New York Giants</a> (1927), <a href="Atlanta_Braves" title="wikilink">Boston Braves</a> (1928), <a href="Chicago_Cubs" title="wikilink">Chicago Cubs</a> (1929&lt;U+2013&gt;1932), and <a href="Baltimore_Orioles" title="wikilink">St. Louis Browns</a> (1933&lt;U+2013&gt;1937). Hornsby had 2,930 <a href="Hit_(baseball)" title="wikilink">hits</a>, 301 <a href="home_run" title="wikilink">home runs</a>, and a .358 <a href="batting_average" title="wikilink">batting average</a> during his career; he was named the <a href="National_League" title="wikilink">National League</a> (NL)'s <a href="Major_League_Baseball_Most_Valuable_Player_Award" title="wikilink">Most Valuable Player</a> (MVP) twice, and was a member of one <a href="World_Series" title="wikilink">World Series</a> championship team.</p>
<p>Born and raised in Texas, Hornsby played for several semi-professional and minor league teams. In 1915, he began his major league career with the St. Louis Cardinals and remained with the team for 12 seasons; in this time, Hornsby won his first MVP Award and the Cardinals won the <a href="1926_World_Series" title="wikilink">1926 World Series</a>. After that season, he spent one season at the New York Giants and another with the Boston Braves before being traded to the Chicago Cubs. He played with the Cubs for four years and won his second MVP Award before the team released him in 1932. Hornsby re-signed with the Cardinals in 1933, but was released partway through the season and was picked up by the St. Louis Browns. He remained there until his final season in 1937. From 1925 to 1937, Hornsby intermittently managed the teams for which he played. After retiring as a player, he managed the Browns in 1952 and the <a href="Cincinnati_Reds" title="wikilink">Cincinnati Reds</a> from 1952 to 1953.</p>
<p>Sportswriters consider Hornsby to be one of the best hitters of all time. His career batting average of .358 is second only to <a href="Ty_Cobb" title="wikilink">Ty Cobb</a> in MLB history. He also won two <a href="Major_League_Baseball_Triple_Crown" title="wikilink">Triple Crowns</a> and batted .400 or more three times during his career. He is the only player to hit 40 home runs and bat .400 in the same year (1922). His batting average for the 1924 season was .424, a mark that no player has matched since. He was elected into the <a href="National_Baseball_Hall_of_Fame_and_Museum" title="wikilink">National Baseball Hall of Fame</a> in 1942.</p>
<p>Hornsby married three times during his life, in 1918, 1924, and 1957, and had two children, one from each of his first two marriages. Known as someone difficult to get along with, he was not well-liked by fellow players. He never smoked, drank, or went to the movies, but frequently gambled on horse races during his career.</p>

<p>Hornsby was born in <a href="Winters,_Texas" title="wikilink">Winters, Texas</a>, the last of Ed and Mary (Rogers) Hornsby's six children.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> When Hornsby was two years old, his father died of unknown causes.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> Four years later, the surviving Hornsbys moved to <a href="Fort_Worth,_Texas" title="wikilink">Fort Worth, Texas</a>, so Hornsby's brothers could get jobs in the <a href="meat_packing_industry" title="wikilink">meat packing industry</a> to support the family.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>

<p>In 1914, Hornsby's older brother Everett, a minor league baseball player for many years,<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> arranged for Rogers to get a tryout with the <a href="Texas_League" title="wikilink">Texas League</a>'s <a href="Dallas_Steers" title="wikilink">Dallas Steers</a>. He made the team, but did not play in any games for the Steers; he was released after only two weeks.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> Following his dismissal, he signed with the Hugo Scouts of the <a href="Minor_league_baseball#Class_B,_C_and_D" title="wikilink">Class D</a> <a href="Texas-Oklahoma_League" title="wikilink">Texas-Oklahoma League</a> as their <a href="shortstop" class="uri" title="wikilink">shortstop</a> for $75 per month ($ today). The Scouts went out of business a third of the way through the season, and Hornsby's contract was sold to the <a href="Denison_Railroaders" title="wikilink">Denison Champions</a> of the same league for $125 ($ today).<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> With both teams in 1914, Hornsby <a href="batting_average" title="wikilink">batted</a> .232 and committed 45 <a href="Error_(baseball)" title="wikilink">errors</a> in 113 games.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a><a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<p>The Denison team changed its name to the Denison Railroaders and joined the <a href="Western_Association" title="wikilink">Western Association</a> in 1915.

<p><img src="Rhornsby.jpg" title="fig:Rogers Hornsby with the St. Louis Cardinals in 1917" alt="Rogers Hornsby with the St. Louis Cardinals in 1917" /> Hornsby came to the attention of the <a href="St._Louis_Cardinals" title="wikilink">St. Louis Cardinals</a> during an exhibition series between that team and the Railroaders in <a href="spring_training" title="wikilink">spring training</a> in 1915. Cardinals' manager <a href="Miller_Huggins" title="wikilink">Miller Huggins</a> told his only <a href="scout_(sport)" title="wikilink">scout</a>, Bob Connery, to look for minor league players to fill the roster of their financially-struggling team. In September, the Cardinals purchased Hornsby's contract from Denison and added him to their major league roster, although his only professional baseball experience had been in <a href="minor_league_baseball#Class_B,_C_and_D" title="wikilink">Class D</a>.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> Hornsby's first game came on September 10, when he relieved <a href="Art_Butler" title="wikilink">Art Butler</a> at shortstop in a 7&lt;U+2013&gt;1 loss to the <a href="Cincinnati_Reds" title="wikilink">Cincinnati Reds</a>.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> Three days later he started a game, and he got his first <a href="hit_(baseball)" title="wikilink">hit</a> the next day against <a href="Rube_Marquard" title="wikilink">Rube Marquard</a> of the <a href="Brooklyn_Robins" title="wikilink">Brooklyn Robins</a>.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> Hornsby finished the season with a .246 average in 57 <a href="at-bat" title="wikilink">at-bats</a> while the Cardinals finished in sixth place in the <a href="National_League" title="wikilink">National League</a> (NL). At only 19 years old, Hornsby was the fourth-youngest player in the NL that year.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>
<p>The Cardinals picked up <a href="Roy_Corhan" title="wikilink">Roy Corhan</a> from the <a href="San_Francisco_Seals_(baseball)" title="wikilink">San Francisco Seals</a> of the <a href="Pacific_Coast_League" title="wikilink">Pacific Coast League</a> to play at shortstop in 1916, making Hornsby one of three candidates for the position. Hornsby's great performance in spring training, a shoulder injury to Corhan and poor hitting by Butler meant Hornsby was the starting shortstop on <a href="Opening_Day" title="wikilink">Opening Day</a>.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> He had both <a href="Run_batted_in" title="wikilink">runs batted in</a> (RBIs) in the Cardinals' 2&lt;U+2013&gt;1 victory over the <a href="Pittsburgh_Pirates" title="wikilink">Pittsburgh Pirates</a> that day.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> On May 14, he hit his first major league <a href="home_run" title="wikilink">home run</a> against <a href="Jeff_Pfeffer" title="wikilink">Jeff Pfeffer</a> of Brooklyn.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> He rotated amongst infield positions before finally settling in at <a href="third_baseman" title="wikilink">third base</a> for much of the second half of the year.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> Late in the season, he missed 11 games with a sprained ankle.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> He finished 1916 with a .313 average, fourth in the NL, and he was one short of the league lead in <a href="triple_(baseball)" title="wikilink">triples</a> with 15.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a></p>
<p>Hornsby returned to the shortstop position in 1917 after Corhan returned to San Francisco and Butler was released.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> After playing nearly every game throughout the first month of the season, Hornsby was called away from the team on May 29 after his brother William was shot and killed in a <a href="Western_saloon" title="wikilink">saloon</a>. Rogers attended the funeral on June 1 and returned to the Cardinals on June 3, finishing the season without missing any more playing time.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> His batting statistics improved from the previous season; his .327 batting average was second in the league, and he led the league in triples (17), <a href="total_bases" title="wikilink">total bases</a> (253), and <a href="slugging_percentage" title="wikilink">slugging percentage</a> (.484).<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a></p>
<p>Many baseball players were drafted to fight in <a href="World_War_I" title="wikilink">World War I</a> in 1918, but Hornsby was given deferment status by the government because he was supporting his family.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> During the offseason, Miller Huggins, unhappy with the Cardinals' management, left the team to manage the <a href="New_York_Yankees" title="wikilink">New York Yankees</a>.

Rowe with his <a href="Buick" class="uri" title="wikilink">Buick</a> when Rowe stepped out in front of traffic to cross an intersection. Rowe sued Hornsby for $15,000 ($ today), but Hornsby eventually settled for a smaller, undisclosed amount, and the case was dismissed.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> He was still among the league leaders in triples and slugging percentage in 1918, but after the season ended with the Cardinals in last place, he announced that he would never play under Hendricks again.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> Partially due to Hornsby's complaints, Hendricks was fired after the season and replaced by <a href="Branch_Rickey" title="wikilink">Branch Rickey</a>, then-president of the Cardinals.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1919, after the Cardinals acquired shortstop <a href="Doc_Lavan" title="wikilink">Doc Lavan</a>, Rickey tried converting Hornsby into a <a href="second_baseman" title="wikilink">second baseman</a> in spring training. Hornsby played third base for most of the year.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> His batting average was low at the beginning of the season but improved by June.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> At season's end, his average of .318 was second-highest in the league, and he also finished second in total bases and runs batted in.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="u20131926">1920&lt;U+2013&gt;1926</h3>

<p>In 1920, Rickey moved Hornsby to second base, where he remained for the rest of his career.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> He started the year with a 14-game <a href="hitting_streak" title="wikilink">hitting streak</a>.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> On June 4, he had two triples and two RBIs as the Cardinals defeated the <a href="Chicago_Cubs" title="wikilink">Chicago Cubs</a> 5&lt;U+2013&gt;1, a game that ended future <a href="National_Baseball_Hall_of_Fame" title="wikilink">Hall of Famer</a> <a href="Grover_Cleveland_Alexander" title="wikilink">Grover Cleveland Alexander</a>'s 11-game winning streak.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a><a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> Hornsby finished the season with the first of seven batting titles by hitting .370, and he also led the league in <a href="on-base_percentage" title="wikilink">on-base percentage</a> (.431), slugging percentage (.559), hits (218), total bases (329), <a href="double_(baseball)" title="wikilink">doubles</a> (44), and RBIs (94).</p>
<p>The rise of the <a href="live-ball_era" title="wikilink">live-ball era</a> led to a spike in hitting productivity throughout the majors, which helped Hornsby to hit with increased power during the 1921 season. He hit .397 in 1921, and his 21 home runs were second in the league, more than twice his total in any previous season. He also led the league in on-base percentage (.458), slugging percentage (.639), <a href="run_(baseball)" title="wikilink">runs scored</a> (131), RBIs (126), doubles (44), and triples (18).<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> The Cardinals held a special day in Hornsby's honor on September 30 before a home game against the <a href="Pittsburgh_Pirates" title="wikilink">Pittsburgh Pirates</a>, and they presented Hornsby with multiple awards before the game, including a baseball autographed by <a href="President_of_the_United_States" title="wikilink">President of the United States</a> <a href="Warren_G._Harding" title="wikilink">Warren G.

<p>By the 1922 season, Hornsby was considered a big star, having led the league in batting average, hits, doubles, and runs batted in multiple times.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a> As a result, he sought a three-year contract for $25,000 per season. After negotiating with Cardinals management, he settled for a three-year, $18,500 contract ($ today), which made him the highest-paid player in league history to that point.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a> He then became the only player in history to hit over 40 home runs and bat over .400 in the same season.<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a> On August 5, Hornsby set a new NL record when he hit his 28th home run of the season off of <a href="Jimmy_Ring" title="wikilink">Jimmy Ring</a> of the <a href="Philadelphia_Phillies" title="wikilink">Philadelphia Phillies</a>.<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a><a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a> From August 13 through September 19, he had a 33-game hitting streak.<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a> He finished the year with a new record of 42 home runs, and he also set NL records in hits (250) and slugging percentage (.722).

His 450 total bases was the highest mark for any NL player during the 20th century. On defense, Hornsby led all second basemen in <a href="putout" title="wikilink">putouts</a>, <a href="double_play" title="wikilink">double plays</a>, and <a href="fielding_percentage" title="wikilink">fielding percentage</a>.<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a></p>

Hornsby missed several games late in the year with injuries that the Cardinals (and Hyland) did not believe to be serious; as a result he was fined $500 ($ today) and suspended for the last five games of the year.<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a> However, Hornsby still won his fourth consecutive NL batting title with a batting average of .384.

<p>Hornsby raised his average to .424 in 1924, which is the sixth-highest batting average in a single season in MLB history, and the <a href="live-ball_era" title="wikilink">live-ball era</a> batting average record. He led the league with 89 <a href="base_on_balls" title="wikilink">walks</a>, producing a .507 on-base percentage.

<p>In 1925, <a href="Sam_Breadon" title="wikilink">Sam Breadon</a>, the owner of the Cardinals, wished to replace Rickey as manager. Hornsby initially declined the job. After discovering that Rickey planned to sell his stock in the Cardinals if he was replaced as field manager, Hornsby agreed to take the job as long as Breadon would help him purchase the stock. Breadon agreed, and Hornsby became the Cardinals' manager.<a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a> Hornsby finished the year with his second Triple Crown, when he combined a .403 batting average with 39 home runs and 143 RBIs.

<p>Hornsby had an off-year offensively in 1926, as he hit only .317 with 11 home runs. Nonetheless, St. Louis won its first NL pennant.

<p>Hornsby enjoyed a better season in 1927, as he hit .361 and led the league in runs scored (133), walks (86), and on-base percentage (.448). He managed the Giants for part of the year as well, as manager <a href="John_McGraw" title="wikilink">John McGraw</a> dealt with health problems.<a href="#fn73" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref73"><sup>73</sup></a> Hornsby's performance helped guide the Giants to a 92&lt;U+2013&gt;62 <a href="Winning_percentage" title="wikilink">win&lt;U+2013&gt;loss record</a> during the season, which was good enough for third place in the NL.

That year, Hornsby began operating a baseball school in <a href="Hot_Springs,_Texas" title="wikilink">Hot Springs, Texas</a>, which he ran on and off between 1933 and 1951 with various associates.<a href="#fn102" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref102"><sup>102</sup></a></p>

<p>In 1934, Hornsby started only two games, one at third base, and the other in <a href="right_fielder" title="wikilink">right field</a>.

<p>Hornsby played in 10 games in the 1935 season, starting in 4.

<p>Hornsby only appeared in two games with the team during the 1936 season.

<p>On July 20, Hornsby appeared in what would be his final game, a 5&lt;U+2013&gt;4 loss to the Yankees. A day later, Hornsby was fired as manager and released as a player by the Browns, who were in last place at the time of his release. His release was partly due to an incident with Browns owner <a href="Donald_Barnes" title="wikilink">Donald Barnes</a>. On July 15, Hornsby won $35,000 ($ today) from betting on a horse race. When he tried to use $4,000 of this money to pay off a debt to Barnes, Barnes refused it, since it had come from a bookmaker. Hornsby protested to Barnes, &quot;The money is as good as the money you take from people in the loan-shark business. It's better than taking interest from widows and orphans... &quot;; that made his release five days later an easy decision for Barnes.<a href="#fn111" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref111"><sup>111</sup></a> Hornsby finished the 1937 season with a .321 batting average and 18 hits in 20 games, and was the oldest player in the AL that season.<a href="#fn112" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref112"><sup>112</sup></a></p>

<p>Following his release from the Browns, Hornsby was unable to retire because his gambling had lost him much of his money over the years.<a href="#fn113" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref113"><sup>113</sup></a> He signed as a player-coach with the <a href="Baltimore_Orioles_(minor_league)" title="wikilink">Baltimore Orioles</a> of the <a href="International_League" title="wikilink">International League</a> in 1938 before leaving them to play for and manage the <a href="Chattanooga_Lookouts" title="wikilink">Chattanooga Lookouts</a> of the <a href="Southern_Association" title="wikilink">Southern Association</a> for the rest of the season.

After hitting a game-winning <a href="grand_slam_(baseball)" title="wikilink">grand slam</a> for the second win of a series in March, he resigned when the team owner complained that the win would diminish the crowd for the third game of the series.<a href="#fn117" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref117"><sup>117</sup></a> Following his release, he did some commentary for radio station WTMV, assisted the <a href="Cleveland_Indians" title="wikilink">Cleveland Indians</a> in spring training in 1947,<a href="#fn118" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref118"><sup>118</sup></a> and became a TV announcer for Chicago Cubs games in 1949.<a href="#fn119" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref119"><sup>119</sup></a></p>
<p>Hornsby did not become a manager or coach again until 1950, when he was hired to manage the Texas League's <a href="Beaumont_Exporters" title="wikilink">Beaumont Roughnecks</a>.

<p>In 1952, Hornsby was again hired to manage the St. Louis Browns, his first major league job in 16 years. The Browns' owner, <a href="Bill_Veeck" title="wikilink">Bill Veeck</a>, was the son of former Cubs president and general manager William Veeck, Sr. Hornsby was not well received by the players, however.

Hornsby did not initially argue the call, and a few minutes later Veeck forced him to do it (when it was already too late to do anything about it). This led to Hornsby and the Browns parting ways.

<p>Baseball experts and sportswriters have considered Hornsby to be one of the greatest hitters of all time. His lifetime batting average of .358 is only exceeded by <a href="Ty_Cobb" title="wikilink">Ty Cobb</a>'s career mark of .367. He won seven batting titles in total, a feat tied or exceeded by only five players (Cobb (11), <a href="Tony_Gwynn" title="wikilink">Tony Gwynn</a> (8), <a href="Honus_Wagner" title="wikilink">Honus Wagner</a> (8), <a href="Rod_Carew" title="wikilink">Rod Carew</a> (7), and <a href="Stan_Musial" title="wikilink">Stan Musial</a> (7)). Hornsby led the National League in slugging percentage nine times, a record that still stands. He also hit more home runs, drove in more runs, and had a higher batting average than any other National League player during the 1920s, which makes him one of four players in baseball history (along with Honus Wagner, <a href="Ted_Williams" title="wikilink">Ted Williams</a>, and <a href="Albert_Pujols" title="wikilink">Albert Pujols</a>) to win a &quot;decade&quot; triple crown.<a href="#fn128" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref128"><sup>128</sup></a> He hit a career total of 301 home runs and was the first National League player to hit 300.<a href="#fn129" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref129"><sup>129</sup></a> His 264 home runs as a second baseman was a major league record for that position until <a href="Joe_Morgan" title="wikilink">Joe Morgan</a> surpassed him in 1984. Hornsby was also a very consistent hitter whether he was playing at home or on the road. His lifetime home batting average was .359, and his lifetime away batting average was .358. Ted Williams said that Hornsby was the greatest hitter for power and average in baseball,<a href="#fn130" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref130"><sup>130</sup></a> and <a href="Frankie_Frisch" title="wikilink">Frankie Frisch</a> said of him, &quot;He's the only guy I know who could hit .350 in the dark.&quot;<a href="#fn131" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref131"><sup>131</sup></a> Hornsby also holds second place on the unofficial major league record list of &quot;consecutive games with two or more hits&quot; with 13 games,<a href="#fn132" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref132"><sup>132</sup></a> first place honors going to <a href="Count_Campau" title="wikilink">Count Campau</a>'s 15-game streak.<a href="#fn133" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref133"><sup>133</sup></a> Hornsby is the only right-handed batter in history to hit over .400 three times<a href="#fn134" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref134"><sup>134</sup></a> and is considered, according to the <em><a href="Los_Angeles_Times" title="wikilink">Los Angeles Times</a></em>, to be the greatest right-handed hitter in history.<a href="#fn135" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref135"><sup>135</sup></a> He led the National League in batting average, on-base percentage, slugging percentage, and total bases every year from 1920 to 1925.<a href="#fn136" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref136"><sup>136</sup></a></p>

<p>However, Hornsby was often hard to get along with. He usually left a team because he annoyed the team's owner. Most of the players he managed did not like him due to his insistence that others follow his lifestyle, although some (like <a href="Woody_English" title="wikilink">Woody English</a> and <a href="Clint_Courtney" title="wikilink">Clint Courtney</a>) did.<a href="#fn139" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref139"><sup>139</sup></a><a href="#fn140" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref140"><sup>140</sup></a> Hornsby never played cards, but he did bet frequently on horse races, and he lost more than he won.<a href="#fn141" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref141"><sup>141</sup></a> His gambling was often a factor in his dismissal from a team.<a href="#fn142" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref142"><sup>142</sup></a> By most contemporary accounts, he was at least as mean and nasty as Cobb, who was known in his time for his aggressive attitude and dirty play.<a href="#fn143" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref143"><sup>143</sup></a><a href="#fn144" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref144"><sup>144</sup></a> He never went to movies, convinced that it would harm a batter's eyesight, and he never smoked or drank.<a href="#fn145" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref145"><sup>145</sup></a></p>
