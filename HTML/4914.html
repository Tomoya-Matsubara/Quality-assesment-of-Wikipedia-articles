Shortly after Ned's funeral, the family finds the phrase &quot;I KNOW WHAT YOU DID!&quot; written in blood everywhere they go.

<p>An x-ray machine scanning Halloween candy malfunctions gives Bart the ability to <a href="List_of_comic_book_superpowers#Shapeshifting" title="wikilink">stretch his body like rubber</a> and Lisa <a href="superhuman_strength" title="wikilink">super strength</a>. They become a <a href="superhero" class="uri" title="wikilink">superhero</a> duo, calling themselves &quot;Stretch Dude &amp; Clobber Girl&quot;. Later, <a href="Lucy_Lawless" title="wikilink">Lucy Lawless</a> (dressed as <a href="Xena" class="uri" title="wikilink">Xena</a>) addresses fans at a science fiction convention. <a href="Comic_Book_Guy" title="wikilink">Comic Book Guy</a>, who has styled himself as a villain called &quot;The Collector&quot;, kidnaps her using a magnet to attract her metal breast plate. Lawless tries to remove the <a href="breastplate" class="uri" title="wikilink">breastplate</a> but stops after she notices that the fans would take pictures of her topless. The Collector takes her to his lair, where he puts her in an aluminized <a href="PET_film_(biaxially_oriented)" title="wikilink">PET film bag</a> for &quot;safekeeping&quot; and imprisons her in a room of other similarly-captured celebrities. Stretch Dude and Clobber Girl then enter the fray in an attempt to free Xena, but they are soon captured as well. The Collector suspends the duo over a vat of <a href="polymethyl_methacrylate" title="wikilink">Lucite</a>. After feigning interest in the villain, Lawless starts clobbering him. The Collector grabs his limited edition double edged lightsaber from <em><a href="Star_Wars_Episode_I:_The_Phantom_Menace" title="wikilink">Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace</a></em> and ignites the blades, but when Lawless reminds him that he has removed it from its original packaging, he panics and ends up falling into the Lucite. Lawless then flies the children home.</p>

Homer, the <a href="Springfield_Nuclear_Power_Plant" title="wikilink">Springfield Nuclear Power Plant</a>'s <a href="Year_2000_problem" title="wikilink">Y2K</a> compliance officer, declares that he fixed all the possible Y2K problems at the plant, including the computers. Unfortunately, Homer forgot to fix his own computer, and in the process sends a virus across the world. Chaos ensues and widespread looting begins. Krusty's malfunctioning pacemaker kills him in front of the family. A letter in Krusty's pocket states that a rocket is being populated with humanity's &quot;best &amp; brightest&quot; and will be launched in order to preserve human civilization on <a href="Mars" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mars</a>. When they reach the shuttle, Homer attempts to bluff his way on board, but the armed guard recognizes Lisa as having a seat reserved.

<h2 id="production">Production</h2>
<p>&quot;Treehouse of Horror X&quot; was directed by <a href="Pete_Michels" title="wikilink">Pete Michels</a> and written by <a href="Donick_Cary" title="wikilink">Donick Cary</a>, <a href="Tim_Long" title="wikilink">Tim Long</a> and <a href="Ron_Hauge" title="wikilink">Ron Hauge</a>. It originally aired on the <a href="Fox_Broadcasting_Company" title="wikilink">Fox network</a> in the United States on <a href="Halloween" class="uri" title="wikilink">Halloween</a>, 1999.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> &quot;I Know What You Diddily-Iddily-Did&quot; was conceived and written by former staff writer Cary. In the DVD commentary for the episode, Cary said that he came up with the segment after watching the 1997 horror film <em><a href="I_Know_What_You_Did_Last_Summer" title="wikilink">I Know What You Did Last Summer</a></em>. &quot;I had just seen the movie and I was like, 'Hey, there you go.'&quot; he said.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> While Flanders serves as the segment's antagonist, the role would originally go to <a href="Grampa_Simpson" title="wikilink">Grampa</a>,<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> who would chase Homer inside a <a href="roller_disco" title="wikilink">roller disco</a>. While Grampa does not appear in the segment, the Springfield Roller Disco is seen during the Simpsons escape from Flanders.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> Despite serving as writer for the segment, Cary left the series after finishing the first draft in order to work on the animated <em>Austin Powers</em> series, which never came to fruition. In his absence, the writing staff rewrote the last quarter of the segment and added the revelation that Flanders is a werewolf.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> In order to dispose of Ned Flanders' corpse, Homer throws his body into Flanders' house. After he is finished, he says &quot;That's the end of that chapter&quot;, a phrase that Cary often uses in his everyday life. &quot;That's just something that comes up a lot in my life is when no matter if it's a good or a bad thing, just move on&quot; he said.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a>  &quot;Desperately Xeeking Xena&quot; was written by staff writer Long. At the beginning of the segment, Milhouse is seen wearing a plastic smock with a picture of Radioactive Man on it. The scene was based on an experience in Long's childhood; &quot;I asked my mom for a Batman costume. And I got a smock that had Batman on it and said 'Batman'. It was very dispiriting&quot; he said in the episode's DVD commentary.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> &quot;Stretch Dude &amp; Clobber Girl&quot;'s theme song was written by Long and composed by <a href="Alf_Clausen" title="wikilink">Alf Clausen</a>. During the sequence, Stretch Dude and Clobber Girl are seen assaulting <a href="Saddam_Hussein" title="wikilink">Saddam Hussein</a>, the fifth President of <a href="Iraq" class="uri" title="wikilink">Iraq</a>. According to Long, the writing staff had a &quot;passionate&quot; discussion about whether the duo would be attacking Hussein or <a href="Iran" title="wikilink">Iranian</a> religious leader and politician <a href="Ruhollah_Khomeini" title="wikilink">Ruhollah Khomeini</a> during the sequence.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> Scully quipped that Hussein was chosen because &quot;he was always asking to be on the show.&quot;<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> The segment features American actress <a href="Lucy_Lawless" title="wikilink">Lucy Lawless</a> as herself. According to Long, Lawless was very happy with the segment's script. She was especially fond of the speech she gives to The Collector, in which she mentions that she was very tall as an adolescent.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> Lawless was directed by Scully, who commented that she was &quot;terrific&quot;.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> In an interview with the Hungarian online newspaper Origo, Lawless said that her part in the episode was the best experience she had guest-starring for a show. &quot;It was really funny when the Comic Book Guy kidnapped me&quot;, she said.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<p>&quot;Life's a Glitch, Then You Die&quot; was written and conceived by Hauge. In DVD commentary for the episode, Hauge stated that, when writing the segment, he knew it would not age well. &quot;I was aware of it at the time, that it wouldn't last forever&quot; he said, &quot;But I wanted to capture that moment.&quot;<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> According to director Michels, the rocket which transported the &quot;best and brightest&quot; of the population was drawn to resemble a <a href="popsicle" class="uri" title="wikilink">popsicle</a>.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> <em>The Simpsons</em>' staff had a lot of trouble finding a guest star for the second rocket, and the only person who agreed to participate was American actor <a href="Tom_Arnold_(actor)" title="wikilink">Tom Arnold</a>. In the episode, Arnold is depicted as an annoying, &quot;not-so-great&quot; celebrity. Although he was mostly in on the joke, Arnold did &quot;bust [the staff's] chops&quot; a little bit when recording his lines. &quot;He would say a line and then they'd yell cut and he'd look over at me and take a shot at me&quot; Hauge said.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> Still, Hauge found Arnold's performance &quot;fantastic&quot;<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> and Scully said that he was a &quot;good sport&quot;.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> The segment also features television personality <a href="Dick_Clark" title="wikilink">Dick Clark</a> as himself. A few months after the episode aired, Hauge discussed the segment with Clark in a Fox studio. According to Hauge, Clark said that the episode gave the &quot;biggest response&quot; he had ever gotten from anything he had ever done. &quot;After the career that he had in television for so long, just to give him a highlight was a highlight for me&quot; Hauge said in the episode's DVD commentary.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="cultural-references">Cultural references</h2>
<p>The opening segment, which shows Kang and Kodos attempting to entertain an audience of aliens, was &quot;born out of [<em>The Simpsons</em>' staff's] love&quot; of comedy teams like <a href="Martin_and_Lewis" title="wikilink">Martin and Lewis</a> and the <a href="Smothers_Brothers" title="wikilink">Smothers Brothers</a>.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> The plot of &quot;I Know What You Diddily-Iddily-Did&quot; is based on the 1997 horror film <em>I Know What You Did Last Summer</em>. At the beginning of the segment, the Simpsons are seen escaping from a group of vampires. Holding a package of Sugar Sugar Crisp cereal, Homer starts singing a jingle about the cereal. Sugar Sugar Crisp is a reference to the breakfast cereal <a href="Golden_Crisp" title="wikilink">Golden Crisp</a>, while the jingle Homer sings references &quot;Can't get enough of that Golden Crisp&quot;, a jingle sung by Golden Crisp's mascot <a href="Sugar_Bear" title="wikilink">Sugar Bear</a> during advertisements for the cereal. According to Scully, the series' staff had a lot of trouble clearing the song for the episode. &quot;Apparently, they didn't want the tune [...] used in this context&quot; he said in the episode's DVD commentary.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>
<p>Although there is a fictional <a href="Marvel_comics" title="wikilink">Marvel comics</a> character called <a href="Collector_(comics)" title="wikilink">Collector</a>, Long did not base The Collector on him. While carrying Lawless with an electromagnet, The Collector says &quot;Care for a <a href="Rolo" class="uri" title="wikilink">Rolo</a>, sweet Xena?&quot; The reference was included because the writing staff were given free Rolos at the time.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> In The Collector's lair, several celebrities are seen stored in aluminized PET film bags. Some of these include <em>The Simpsons</em>' co-creator <a href="Matt_Groening" title="wikilink">Matt Groening</a> and <a href="Tom_Baker" title="wikilink">Tom Baker</a>, who portrayed the <a href="Fourth_Doctor" title="wikilink">fourth incarnation</a> of <a href="Doctor_(Doctor_Who)" title="wikilink">the doctor</a> in the British <a href="Science_fiction_on_television" title="wikilink">science fiction television</a> series <em><a href="Doctor_Who" title="wikilink">Doctor Who</a></em>. &quot;There are several <em>Doctor Who</em> actors but Tom Baker is the one we always go with&quot; Hauge explained in the episode's DVD commentary.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> The segment also features the series' first reference to <em><a href="Star_Wars_Episode_I:_The_Phantom_Menace" title="wikilink">Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace</a></em>. Because the episode was written before the film's release, the writers did not know &quot;how bad it was gonna be&quot; and therefore did not include any &quot;obligatory shot&quot; at the film.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> As he dies, The Collector poses as <a href="Lorne_Greene" title="wikilink">Lorne Greene</a>'s character <a href="Commander_Adama" title="wikilink">Commander Adama</a> in the science fiction series <em><a href="Battlestar_Galactica_(1978_TV_series)" title="wikilink">Battlestar Galactica</a></em>.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> Hauge based &quot;Life's a Glitch, Then You Die&quot; on the hysteria involving <a href="Y2K" class="uri" title="wikilink">Y2K</a>, a digital problem that occurred the night into January 1, 2000. In a scene in the segment, several celebrities, including actor <a href="Mel_Gibson" title="wikilink">Mel Gibson</a> and former <a href="Major_League_Baseball" title="wikilink">Major League Baseball</a> player <a href="Mark_McGwire" title="wikilink">Mark McGwire</a>, can be seen waiting in line for the first rocket.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> They both gueststarred as themselves in two earlier episodes from the season.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a><a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a></p>

<p>Following its broadcast, &quot;Treehouse of Horror X&quot; received positive reviews from critics. In his review of <em>The Simpsons: The Complete Eleventh Season</em>, Colin Jacobson of DVD Movie Guide wrote &quot;Even in the series&lt;U+2019&gt; crummier seasons, the staff always seems to come up with a good Halloween episode&quot;, and that &quot;Treehouse of Horror X&quot; &quot;continues that trend&quot;.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> Of the three segments, Jacobson found &quot;Life's a Glitch, Then You Die&quot; to be the weakest. He wrote &quot;[...] other than a good ending, it simply doesn&lt;U+2019&gt;t have a lot going for it&quot; and added that it is the most dated of the three.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> He continued, &quot;'Diddily' offers a fun horror spoof, and 'Xena' is a terrific superhero bit with plenty of cleverness.&quot;<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> <a href="DVD_Talk" title="wikilink">DVD Talk</a>'s Ian Jane gave the episode a positive review as well. Considering it to be one of the season's best episodes, Jane wrote &quot;This one, like so many that have come before and since, is a great blend of horror movie parody and Halloween themed fun in Springfield.&quot;<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> In 2007, Seb Patrick of Noise to Signal included &quot;Desperately Xeeking Xena&quot; in a list called &quot;The Ten Best Treehouse of Horror Vignettes&quot;. Although he disliked Bart and Lisa's part in the segment, Patrick wrote that it &quot;earns its stripes by being perhaps Comic Book Guy's finest hour&quot;.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> He also praised the segment's references, as well as Lawless' line &quot;A wizard did it&quot;, a phrase used to explain continuity errors.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> In 2009, The Collector's marriage proposal to Lawless was included in &quot;Line-O-Rama: Comic Book Guy&quot;, a compilation of what <a href="IGN" class="uri" title="wikilink">IGN</a> considers to be The Comic Book Guy's best lines.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a></p>
