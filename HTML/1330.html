<p><strong>Lazare Ponticelli</strong> (<a href="December_7" title="wikilink">December 7</a>, <a href="1897" class="uri" title="wikilink">1897</a> – <a href="March_12" title="wikilink">March 12</a>, <a href="2008" class="uri" title="wikilink">2008</a>) was, at the time of his death, the last documented surviving <a href="France" title="wikilink">French</a> veteran of <a href="World_War_I" title="wikilink">the First World War</a> and the last <em><a href="poilu" class="uri" title="wikilink">poilu</a></em>, or foot soldier, of its trenches. Born in Italy, he moved to France at age nine and lied about his age to join the <a href="French_Army" title="wikilink">French Army</a> in 1914. However, upon the entry of Italy into the Second World War in 1915, Ponticelli was transferred to <a href="Italian_Army" title="wikilink">its army</a> when authorities discovered his true ancestry. After World War I, he and his brothers founded the piping and metal work company &quot;Ponticelli Fr&lt;U+00E8&gt;res&quot; (&quot;Ponticelli Brothers&quot;), which assisted with <a href="World_War_II" title="wikilink">the Second World War</a> effort and is still in existence.</p>
<p>At the time of his death, Ponticelli was both the oldest living man born in <a href="Italy" class="uri" title="wikilink">Italy</a> and the oldest man living in France. In his later years, he was critical of war in general and humbly kept his war awards in a shoe box. While he felt unworthy of the state funeral the French government offered him, he eventually accepted one, although he asked for the emphasis of the procession to be on the common soldier that died on the battlefield.</p>
<h2 id="early-life">Early life</h2>
<p>Ponticelli was born &quot;L&lt;U+00E0&gt;zzaro&quot; in Groppo Ducale near the village of <a href="Bettola" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bettola</a>, <a href="province_of_Piacenza" title="wikilink">Piacenza province</a>, in northern Italy.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> Raised in the mountain village of Cordiani, he was one of seven children born to Jean and Philomena Ponticelli. His father worked the fairgrounds and occasionally as a carpenter and cobbler.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> His mother cultivated the family's small plot of land and, like many women of the area, commuted three times a year to the <a href="Po_Valley" title="wikilink">Po Valley</a> to work in its rice fields.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> When Lazare was two, his mother moved to France to try to earn a better living.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> After the unexpected death of their father and his eldest son, Peter, the rest of the family moved to <a href="Paris" class="uri" title="wikilink">Paris</a>, leaving Lazare in the care of his neighbors.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>At the age of six, Ponticelli started working several jobs, including making clogs.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> In 1906, at age nine, he saved enough money to buy a train ticket to Paris, which he considered &quot;paradise&quot;.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a><a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a><a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> Although he spoke no French, he found work as a chimney sweep in <a href="Nogent-sur-Marne" class="uri" title="wikilink">Nogent-sur-Marne</a> and later as a <a href="paper_boy" title="wikilink">paper boy</a> in Paris.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a><a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a><a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="world-war-i">World War I</h2>
<p>In August 1914, when he was 16, he lied about his age to join the 1<sup>st</sup> R&lt;U+00E9&gt;giment de Marche of the <a href="French_Foreign_Legion" title="wikilink">French Foreign Legion</a>, where his older brother C&lt;U+00E9&gt;leste was already serving.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a><a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> According to Ponticelli, France had done much for him, and serving was his way of showing his gratitude.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> He served at <a href="Soissons" class="uri" title="wikilink">Soissons</a> in <a href="Picardy" class="uri" title="wikilink">Picardy</a>, northeast France and at <a href="Douaumont" class="uri" title="wikilink">Douaumont</a>, near <a href="Verdun" class="uri" title="wikilink">Verdun</a>.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> Ponticelli worked at digging burial pits and trenches.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> On one occasion he reportedly rescued a German and a French soldier who had been wounded and caught on the front lines.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
<p>With the entry of Italy into the First World War in 1915, Ponticelli was told he had to join the Italian Army and was discharged. At first refusing to leave, Ponticelli was escorted by two gendarmes to <a href="Torino" class="uri" title="wikilink">Torino</a>, where he joined a regiment of <a href="Alpini" class="uri" title="wikilink">Alpini</a> for service against <a href="Austrian_Army" title="wikilink">the Austrians</a>. At his new post as a <a href="machine_gun" title="wikilink">machine gunner</a>, Ponticelli was seriously wounded by a shell during an assault on an Austrian mountain position.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> He described the event in an undated interview as &quot;blood running through [his] eyes&quot;, but he &quot;... continued firing despite [his] wound.&quot;<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>
<p>After undergoing surgery, Ponticelli travelled back to his post.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> His regiment once stopped firing for three weeks on the Austrians, whose language many of them spoke, and swapped loaves of bread for tobacco, taking pictures of each other.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> In 1918 he was gassed in an Austrian chemical weapon attack that killed hundreds of his fellow soldiers.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> Reflecting on war, he said: &quot;You shoot at men who are fathers. War is completely stupid.&quot;<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> and once questioned why he, or his regiment, had ever been fighting.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> In one of his last interviews, Ponticelli stated he was amazed at his own survival.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a></p>

<p><img src="Ponticelli_bros.jpg" title="fig:The &quot;Ponticelli Brothers&quot;" alt="The &quot;Ponticelli Brothers&quot;" /> After being demobilised in 1920, Lazare founded a piping and metal work company with his brothers called &quot;Ponticelli Fr&lt;U+00E8&gt;res&quot; (&quot;Ponticelli Brothers&quot;). Located in the 13th <a href="Arrondissements_of_France" title="wikilink">arrondissement of Paris</a>, it became profitable and well-known in its field, and still exists today.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> At the time of his death it was reported that the company had 4,000 employees.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a></p>
<p>During the <a href="World_War_II" title="wikilink">Second World War</a> Ponticelli, who became a French citizen in 1939, was too old for combat, although he supported the war effort by supplying soldiers with his products.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a><a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> He moved his factory into an unoccupied zone when Germany invaded and occupied France. After <a href="Vichy_France" title="wikilink">Vichy France</a> was taken over, he returned northwards and began working with the <a href="French_Resistance" title="wikilink">resistance</a>. Ponticelli continued managing the company until his retirement in 1960.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="later-life">Later life</h2>

<p>Until his death Ponticelli lived with his daughter in <a href="Le_Kremlin-Bic&lt;U+00EA&gt;tre" title="wikilink">Le Kremlin-Bic&lt;U+00EA&gt;tre</a>, France and every <a href="November_11" title="wikilink">November 11</a> until 2007 attended <a href="Armistice_Day" title="wikilink">Armistice Day</a> ceremonies.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a><a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> A recipient of several awards, Ponticelli knew it was his age that gave him the medals and kept them in a shoe box.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> When originally offered a state funeral by then French President <a href="Jacques_Chirac" title="wikilink">Jacques Chirac</a>, he asserted that he did not want one, although the death of the penultimate soldier, <a href="Louis_de_Cazenave" title="wikilink">Louis de Cazenave</a>, on <a href="January_20" title="wikilink">January 20</a>, <a href="2008" class="uri" title="wikilink">2008</a><a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> forced him to reconsider.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> He eventually accepted a small ceremony &quot;in the name of all those who died, men and women&quot;,<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> during World War I.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a></p>
<p>Ponticelli died at 12:45 pm (1145 GMT) at his home in Le Kremlin-Bic&lt;U+00EA&gt;tre on <a href="March_12" title="wikilink">March 12</a>, <a href="2008" class="uri" title="wikilink">2008</a>, aged 110.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> At the time of his death, Ponticelli was both the oldest man living born in Italy and the oldest man living in France.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> <a href="Nicolas_Sarkozy" title="wikilink">Nicolas Sarkozy</a>, the <a href="President_of_France" title="wikilink">French president</a>, released a statement and said there would be a day of national remembrance for the war dead of France.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> Ponticelli was survived by at least a daughter, then-78-year-old Janine Desbaucheron.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a><a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a></p>

After the procession he was buried in a family plot in Paris.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a></p>
