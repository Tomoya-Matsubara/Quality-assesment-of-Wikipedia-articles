<p>The <strong>Naval Battle of Guadalcanal</strong>, sometimes referred to as the <strong>Third and Fourth Battles of Savo Island</strong>, the <strong>Battle of the Solomons</strong> or, in Japanese sources, as the , took place <a href="November_12" title="wikilink">November 12</a> &lt;U+2013&gt; <a href="November_15" title="wikilink">November 15</a> <a href="1942" class="uri" title="wikilink">1942</a>, and was the decisive engagement in a series of <a href="naval_battle" title="wikilink">naval battles</a> between <a href="Allies_of_World_War_II" title="wikilink">Allied</a> (primarily <a href="United_States" title="wikilink">United States</a>) and <a href="Military_of_Japan" title="wikilink">Imperial Japanese forces</a> during the months-long <a href="Guadalcanal_campaign" title="wikilink">Guadalcanal campaign</a> in the <a href="Solomon_Islands" title="wikilink">Solomon Islands</a>. The action consisted of combined air and sea engagements over four days, most near <a href="Guadalcanal" class="uri" title="wikilink">Guadalcanal</a> and all related to a Japanese effort to reinforce land forces on the island.</p>
<p>Allied forces, primarily from the U.S., had landed on Guadalcanal on <a href="August_7" title="wikilink">August 7</a>, <a href="1942" class="uri" title="wikilink">1942</a> and seized an airfield, later called <a href="Honiara_International_Airport" title="wikilink">Henderson Field</a>, that was under construction by the Japanese military. Several subsequent attempts by the <a href="Imperial_Japanese_Army" title="wikilink">Imperial Japanese Army</a> and <a href="Imperial_Japanese_Navy" title="wikilink">Navy</a>, using reinforcements delivered to Guadalcanal by ship, to recapture the airfield failed. In early November 1942, the Japanese organized a transport convoy to take 7,000 infantry troops and their equipment to Guadalcanal to attempt once again to retake the airfield. To allow the convoy to approach the island and deliver its cargo, the Japanese navy sent several warship forces to bombard Henderson Field with the goal of destroying Allied aircraft stationed at the airfield that posed a threat to the troop convoy. Learning of the Japanese reinforcement effort, U.S. forces prepared to interdict the Japanese convoy and warships with aircraft and warship attacks.</p>
<p>In the resulting battle, both sides lost numerous warships in two extremely destructive nighttime surface engagements, with the U.S. suffering more warships sunk or heavily damaged than the Japanese. The U.S., however, was successful in turning back attempts by the Japanese to bombard Henderson Field with battleships. Air attacks by Allied aircraft also sank most of the Japanese troop transports and prevented the majority of the Japanese troops and equipment from reaching Guadalcanal. The battle turned back Japan's last major attempt to dislodge Allied forces from Guadalcanal and nearby <a href="Tulagi" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tulagi</a>, resulting in a <a href="military_strategy" title="wikilink">strategic</a> <a href="Strategic_victory" title="wikilink">victory</a> for the U.S. and its allies and deciding the ultimate outcome of the Guadalcanal campaign in favor of Allied forces.</p>
<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>The six-month <a href="Guadalcanal_campaign" title="wikilink">Guadalcanal campaign</a> began <a href="August_7" title="wikilink">August 7</a> <a href="1942" class="uri" title="wikilink">1942</a>, when Allied forces (primarily U.S.) landed on Guadalcanal, Tulagi, and the <a href="Florida_Islands" title="wikilink">Florida Islands</a> in the <a href="Solomon_Islands" title="wikilink">Solomon Islands</a>, at the time a colonial possession of the <a href="United_Kingdom_of_Great_Britain_and_Northern_Ireland" title="wikilink">United Kingdom</a>. The landings were meant to deny the islands' use by the Japanese as <a href="Military_base" title="wikilink">bases</a> for threatening the <a href="materiel" title="wikilink">supply</a> routes between the U.S. and <a href="Australia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Australia</a>, and to secure them as starting points for a <a href="Military_campaign" title="wikilink">campaign</a> to isolate the major <a href="Empire_of_Japan" title="wikilink">Imperial Japanese</a> military base at <a href="Rabaul" class="uri" title="wikilink">Rabaul</a> and support of the Allied <a href="New_Guinea_campaign" title="wikilink">New Guinea campaign</a>. The Japanese had occupied Tulagi in May 1942 and began constructing an airfield on Guadalcanal in June 1942.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>The Japanese were taken by surprise, and by nightfall on <a href="August_8" title="wikilink">August 8</a> the 11,000 Allied troops, under the command of <a href="Lieutenant_General" title="wikilink">Lieutenant General</a> <a href="Alexander_Vandegrift" title="wikilink">Alexander Vandegrift</a>, <a href="Battle_of_Tulagi_and_Gavutu-Tanambogo" title="wikilink">secured Tulagi</a> and nearby small islands as well as the Japanese airfield under construction at Lunga Point on Guadalcanal. The Allies later renamed the airfield Henderson Field. Allied aircraft operating out of Henderson were called the &quot;<a href="Cactus_Air_Force" title="wikilink">Cactus Air Force</a>&quot; (CAF) after the Allied code name for Guadalcanal. To protect the airfield, the US Marines established a perimeter defense around Lunga Point. Additional reinforcements over the next two months later increased the number of US troops at Lunga Point on Guadalcanal to more than 20,000.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>In response to the Allied landings on Guadalcanal, the Japanese <a href="Imperial_General_Headquarters" title="wikilink">Imperial General Headquarters</a> assigned the Imperial Japanese Army's 17th Army, a <a href="corps" class="uri" title="wikilink">corps</a>-sized command based at Rabaul and under the command of Lieutenant-General <a href="Harukichi_Hyakutake" title="wikilink">Harukichi Hyakutake</a>, with the task of retaking Guadalcanal. Units of the 17th Army began to arrive on Guadalcanal on <a href="August_19" title="wikilink">August 19</a> to drive Allied forces from the island.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>Because of the threat by CAF aircraft based at Henderson Field, the Japanese were unable to use large, slow transport ships to deliver troops and supplies to the island. Instead, the Japanese used warships based at Rabaul and the <a href="Shortland_Islands" title="wikilink">Shortland Islands</a> to carry their forces to Guadalcanal. The Japanese warships, mainly light <a href="cruiser" title="wikilink">cruisers</a> or <a href="destroyer" title="wikilink">destroyers</a> from the <a href="IJN_8th_Fleet" title="wikilink">Eighth Fleet</a> under the command of <a href="Vice_Admiral" title="wikilink">Vice Admiral</a> <a href="Gunichi_Mikawa" title="wikilink">Gunichi Mikawa</a>, were usually able to make the round trip down &quot;<a href="The_Slot" title="wikilink">The Slot</a>&quot; to Guadalcanal and back in a single night, thereby minimizing their exposure to CAF air attack. Delivering the troops in this manner, however, prevented most of the soldiers' heavy equipment and supplies, such as heavy artillery, vehicles, and much food and ammunition, from being carried to Guadalcanal with them. These high speed warship runs to Guadalcanal occurred throughout the campaign and were later called the &quot;<a href="Tokyo_Express" title="wikilink">Tokyo Express</a>&quot; by Allied forces and &quot;Rat Transportation&quot; by the Japanese.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p><img src="HendersonField.jpg" title="fig:Aerial view of Henderson Field on Guadalcanal, late August 1942. The view looks northwest with the Lunga River and Lunga Point at the top of the image." alt="Aerial view of Henderson Field on Guadalcanal, late August 1942. The view looks northwest with the Lunga River and Lunga Point at the top of the image." width="250" />The first Japanese attempt to recapture Henderson Field failed when a 917-man force was defeated on <a href="August_21" title="wikilink">August 21</a> in the <a href="Battle_of_the_Tenaru" title="wikilink">Battle of the Tenaru</a>. The next attempt took place from <a href="September_12" title="wikilink">September 12</a> through <a href="September_14" title="wikilink">September 14</a>, ending in the defeat of the <a href="Kawaguchi_Detachment" title="wikilink">6,000Â soldiers</a> under the command of Major General <a href="Kiyotake_Kawaguchi" title="wikilink">Kiyotake Kawaguchi</a> at the <a href="Battle_of_Edson&#39;s_Ridge" title="wikilink">Battle of Edson's Ridge</a>.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>In October, the Japanese again tried to recapture Henderson Field by delivering 15,000 more <a href="Japanese_Imperial_Army" title="wikilink">army</a> troops, mainly from the <a href="2nd_Division_(Imperial_Japanese_Army)" title="wikilink">2nd Infantry Division</a>, to Guadalcanal. In addition to delivering the troops and their equipment by Tokyo Express runs, the Japanese also successfully pushed through one large convoy of slower transport ships. Enabling the approach of the transport convoy was a nighttime bombardment of Henderson Field by two battleships on <a href="October_14" title="wikilink">October 14</a> that heavily damaged the airfield's runways, destroyed half of the CAF's aircraft, and burned most of the available aviation fuel. In spite of the damage, Henderson personnel were able to restore the two runways to service and replacement aircraft and fuel were delivered, gradually restoring the CAF to its pre-bombardment level over the next few weeks.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p>The next Japanese attempt to retake the island with the newly arrived troops occurred from <a href="October_20" title="wikilink">October 20</a> to <a href="October_26" title="wikilink">October 26</a> and was defeated with heavy losses in the <a href="Battle_for_Henderson_Field" title="wikilink">Battle for Henderson Field</a>.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> At the same time, Admiral <a href="Isoroku_Yamamoto" title="wikilink">Isoroku Yamamoto</a> (the commander of the Japanese <a href="Combined_Fleet" title="wikilink">Combined Fleet</a>) attempted to decisively defeat U.S. naval forces in the <a href="Battle_of_the_Santa_Cruz_Islands" title="wikilink">Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands</a>. In that battle, U.S. naval forces were defeated and driven from the area with the loss of one aircraft carrier and severe damage to another. The Japanese carriers, however, were also forced to retreat because of crippling losses to their carrier aircraft and aircrews.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> Thereafter, Yamamoto's ships returned to their main bases at <a href="Chuuk" title="wikilink">Truk</a> in <a href="Micronesia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Micronesia</a>, where he had his <a href="headquarters" class="uri" title="wikilink">headquarters</a>, and Rabaul on <a href="New_Britain" title="wikilink">New Britain</a> while three of the four Japanese carriers returned to Japan for repairs and refitting.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<p>The Japanese army planned another attack on Guadalcanal in November 1942, but further reinforcements were needed before the operation could proceed. The army requested assistance from Yamamoto to deliver the needed reinforcements to the island and to support their planned offensive on the Allied forces guarding Henderson Field. To support the reinforcement effort, Yamamoto provided 11 large transport ships to carry 7,000 army troops from the 38th Infantry Division, their <a href="ammunition" class="uri" title="wikilink">ammunition</a>, food, and heavy equipment from Rabaul to Guadalcanal. He also sent a warship support force from Truk on <a href="November_9" title="wikilink">November 9</a> that included two battleships. The two battleships, <em><a href="Japanese_battleship_Hiei" title="wikilink">Hiei</a></em> and <em><a href="Japanese_battleship_Kirishima" title="wikilink">Kirishima</a></em>, equipped with special <a href="fragmentation_(weaponry)" title="wikilink">fragmentation</a> <a href="Shell_(projectile)" title="wikilink">shells</a>, were to bombard Henderson Field on the night of <a href="November_12" title="wikilink">November 12</a> &lt;U+2014&gt; <a href="November_13" title="wikilink">13</a> and destroy it and the aircraft stationed there in order to allow the slow, heavy transports to reach Guadalcanal and unload safely the next day.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> The warship force was commanded from <em>Hiei</em> by recently-promoted Vice Admiral <a href="Hiroaki_Abe" title="wikilink">Hiroaki Abe</a>.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>

<p>At about 01:25 on <a href="November_13" title="wikilink">November 13</a>, in almost complete pitch darkness because of the bad weather and <a href="Lunar_phase" title="wikilink">dark moon</a>, the ships of the Japanese force entered the sound between <a href="Savo_Island" title="wikilink">Savo Island</a> and Guadalcanal and prepared to bombard Henderson Field.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> Several of the U.S. ships detected the Japanese ships on radar, beginning about 01:24, but had trouble communicating the information to Callaghan because of problems with their ship's radio equipment and lack of discipline with their <a href="communication" title="wikilink">communications</a> procedures.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a><a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> Several minutes later, both forces visually sighted each other about the same time, but both Abe and Callaghan hesitated ordering their ships into action.

<p><em>Hiei</em>, with her nine lit searchlights, huge size, and course taking her directly through the U.S. formation, became the focus of gunfire from many of the U.S. ships. <em>Laffey</em> passed so close to <em>Hiei</em> that they missed <a href="collision" title="wikilink">colliding</a> by 20Â feet (6Â m).<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> <em>Hiei</em> was unable to depress her main or secondary batteries low enough to hit <em>Laffey</em>, but <em>Laffey</em> was able to rake <em>Hiei</em>&lt;U+2019&gt;s superstructure with  shells and <a href="machine_gun" title="wikilink">machine gun</a> fire, causing heavy damage to <em>Hiei</em>&lt;U+2019&gt;s <a href="superstructure" class="uri" title="wikilink">superstructure</a> and <a href="Bridge_(ship)" title="wikilink">bridge</a>, wounding Admiral Abe, and killing his <a href="Chief_of_staff_(military)" title="wikilink">chief of staff</a>.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> Admiral Abe was thereafter limited in his ability to direct his ships for the rest of the battle.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> <em>Sterett</em> and <em>O'Bannon</em> likewise pumped several <a href="salvo" title="wikilink">salvos</a> into <em>Hiei</em>&lt;U+2019&gt;s superstructure from close range, and perhaps one or two torpedoes into her <a href="hull_(watercraft)" title="wikilink">hull</a>, causing <em>Hiei</em> further damage, before both destroyers escaped into the darkness.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a></p>
<p><img src="Hiei1942.jpg" title="fig:Japanese battleship Hiei in 1942" alt="Japanese battleship Hiei in 1942" width="275" />Unable to fire her main or secondary batteries at the three destroyers causing her so much trouble, <em>Hiei</em> instead concentrated on <em>SanÂ Francisco</em> which was passing by only 2,500 yards (2.3 km) away.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> Along with <em>Kirishima</em>, <em>Inazuma</em>, and <em>Ikazuchi</em>, the four ships made repeated hits on <em>SanÂ Francisco</em>, disabling her steering control and killing Admiral <a href="Daniel_J._Callaghan" title="wikilink">Callaghan</a>, Captain <a href="Cassin_Young" title="wikilink">Cassin Young</a>, and most of the bridge staff. The first few salvos from <em>Hiei</em> and <em>Kirishima</em> consisted of the special fragmentation bombardment shells, which reduced damage to the interior of <em>SanÂ Francisco</em> and may have saved her from being sunk outright. Not expecting a ship-to-ship confrontation, it took the crews of the two Japanese battleships several minutes to switch to <a href="Armor-piercing_shot_and_shell" title="wikilink">armor-piercing</a> ammunition. Nevertheless, <em>SanÂ Francisco</em>, almost helpless to defend herself, managed to momentarily sail clear of the melee.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> However, she landed at least one shell in <em>Hiei</em>&lt;U+2019&gt;s steering gear room during the exchange, flooding it with water, shorting out her power steering generators, and severely inhibiting <em>Hiei</em>&lt;U+2019&gt;s steering capability.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> <em>Helena</em> followed <em>SanÂ Francisco</em> to try and protect her from further harm.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a></p>

<p><em>Yudachi</em> and <em>Amatsukaze</em> independently charged the rear five ships of the U.S. formation.

<p><a href="Robert_Leckie" title="wikilink">Robert Leckie</a>, a <a href="United_States_Marine_Corps" title="wikilink">Marine</a> private on Guadalcanal, described the battle: </p>
<p>After nearly 40 minutes of the brutal, close-quarters fighting, the two sides broke contact and ceased fire at 02:26 after Abe and Captain Gilbert Hoover (the captain of <em>Helena</em> and senior surviving U.S. officer at this point) ordered their respective forces to disengage.<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a> Admiral Abe had one battleship (<em>Kirishima</em>), one light cruiser (<em>Nagara</em>), and four destroyers (<em>Asagumo</em>, <em>Teruzuki</em>, <em>Yukikaze</em>, and <em>Harusame</em>) with only light damage that could continue fighting (<em>Inazuma</em>, <em>Ikazuchi</em>, <em>Murasame</em>, and <em>Samidare</em> were damaged enough that their fighting ability was somewhat impaired). The U.S. had only one light cruiser (<em>Helena</em>) and one destroyer (<em>Fletcher</em>) that were still capable of effective resistance. Although perhaps unclear to Abe, the way was clear for him to bombard Henderson Field and finish off the U.S. naval forces in the area, clearing the way for the troops and supplies to be landed safely on Guadalcanal.<a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a></p>
<p>However, at this crucial juncture, Abe chose to abandon the mission and depart the area. Several reasons are conjectured as to why he made this decision. Much of the special bombardment ammunition had been expended in the battle. His own injuries and the deaths of some of his staff from battle action may have affected his thought processes. Perhaps he was also unsure as to how many of his or the U.S. ships were still combat-capable because of communication problems with the damaged <em>Hiei</em>. Furthermore, his own ships were scattered and would have taken some time to reassemble for a coordinated resumption of the mission to attack Henderson Field and the remnants of the U.S. warship force. For whatever reason, Abe called for a disengagement and general retreat of his warships, although <em>Yukikaze</em> and <em>Teruzuki</em> remained behind to assist <em>Hiei</em>.<a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a> <em>Samidare</em> picked-up survivors from <em>Yudachi</em> at 03:00 before joining the other Japanese ships in the retirement northwards.<a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a></p>

<p><em>Hiei</em> was attacked repeatedly by Marine <a href="TBF_Avenger" title="wikilink">TBF Avenger</a> torpedo planes from Henderson Field, TBFs and <a href="SBD_Dauntless" title="wikilink">SBD Dauntless</a> dive-bombers from <a href="USS_Enterprise_(CV-6)" title="wikilink"><em>Enterprise</em></a>, which had departed <a href="Noumea" class="uri" title="wikilink">Noumea</a> on <a href="November_11" title="wikilink">November 11</a>, and <a href="B-17_Flying_Fortress" title="wikilink">B-17 Flying Fortress</a> bombers of the <a href="United_States_Army_Air_Forces" title="wikilink">United States Army Air Forces</a> 11th Heavy Bombardment Group from <a href="Espiritu_Santo" title="wikilink">Espiritu Santo</a>. Abe and his staff transferred to <em>Yukikaze</em> at 08:15. <em>Kirishima</em> was ordered by Abe to take <em>Hiei</em> under tow, escorted by <em>Nagara</em> and its destroyers, but the attempt was cancelled because of the threat of submarine attack and <em>Hiei</em>'s increasing unseaworthiness.<a href="#fn70" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a> After sustaining more damage from air attacks, <em>Hiei</em> sank northwest of Savo Island, perhaps after being scuttled by her remaining crew, in the late evening of <a href="November_13" title="wikilink">November 13</a>.<a href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a></p>
<p><em>Portland</em>, <em>San Francisco</em>, <em>Aaron Ward,</em> <em>Sterett</em>, and <em>O'Bannon</em> were eventually able to make it back to rear-area ports for repairs. <em>Atlanta</em>, however, sank near Guadalcanal at 20:00 on <a href="November_13" title="wikilink">November 13</a>.<a href="#fn72" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref72"><sup>72</sup></a> Departing from the Solomon Islands area with <em>SanÂ Francisco</em>, <em>Helena</em>, <em>Sterret</em>, and <em>O'Bannon</em> later that day, <em>Juneau</em> was torpedoed and sunk by <a href="Japanese_submarine_I-26" title="wikilink">Japanese submarine <em>I-26</em></a> (). <em>Juneau</em>&lt;U+2019&gt;s 100+ survivors (out of a total complement of 650) were left to fend on their own in the open ocean for eight days before rescue aircraft belatedly arrived. While awaiting rescue, all but 10 of <em>Juneau</em>&lt;U+2019&gt;s crew died from their injuries, the elements, or <a href="shark" class="uri" title="wikilink">shark</a> attacks. The dead included the five <a href="Sullivan_brothers" title="wikilink">Sullivan brothers</a>.<a href="#fn73" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref73"><sup>73</sup></a></p>
<p>Because of the confused nature of the battle, the U.S. believed that they had sunk as many as seven Japanese ships.<a href="#fn74" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref74"><sup>74</sup></a> This, plus the Japanese retreat, caused the U.S. to believe at the time that they had won a significant victory. It was only after the war that the U.S. learned that they had suffered what most see as a crushing <em>tactical</em> defeat.<a href="#fn75" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref75"><sup>75</sup></a></p>
<p>Nevertheless, most historians appear to agree that Abe's decision to retreat turned this tactical defeat into a strategic victory for the U.S. Henderson Field remained operational with attack aircraft ready to deter the slow Japanese transports from approaching Guadalcanal with their precious cargoes.<a href="#fn76" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref76"><sup>76</sup></a><a href="#fn77" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref77"><sup>77</sup></a> Plus, the Japanese had lost an opportunity to eliminate the U.S. naval forces in the area, a result which would have taken even the comparatively resource-rich U.S. some time to recover from. Reportedly furious, Admiral Yamamoto relieved Abe of command and later directed his forced retirement from the military. However, it appears that Yamamoto may have been more angry over the loss of one of his battleships (<em>Hiei</em>) than he was over the abandonment of the supply mission and failure to completely destroy the U.S. force. Shortly before noon, Yamamoto ordered Vice Admiral <a href="Nobutake_Kondo" title="wikilink">Nobutake Kondo</a>, commanding the Second Fleet at Truk, to form a new bombardment unit around <em>Kirishima</em> and attack Henderson Field on the night of <a href="November_14" title="wikilink">November 14</a>&lt;U+2013&gt;<a href="November_15" title="wikilink">November 15</a>.<a href="#fn78" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref78"><sup>78</sup></a></p>
<p>Including the sinking of <em>Juneau</em>, total U.S. losses in the battle were 1,439 dead.

<p>Low on undamaged ships, Admiral <a href="William_Halsey,_Jr." title="wikilink">William Halsey, Jr.</a>, detached the new battleships <a href="USS_Washington_(BB-56)" title="wikilink"><em>Washington</em></a> and <a href="USS_South_Dakota_(BB-57)" title="wikilink"><em>South Dakota</em></a>, of <em>Enterprise</em>&lt;U+2019&gt;s support group, together with four destroyers, as Task Force 64 under Admiral <a href="Willis_A._Lee" title="wikilink">Willis A. Lee</a> to defend Guadalcanal and Henderson Field. It was a scratch force; the battleships had only operated together for a few days, and their four escorts were from four different divisions&lt;U+2014&gt;chosen simply because, of the available destroyers, they had the most fuel.<a href="#fn89" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref89"><sup>89</sup></a> The U.S. force arrived in Ironbottom Sound in the evening of <a href="November_14" title="wikilink">November 14</a> and began patrolling around Savo Island. The U.S. warships were in column formation with the four destroyers in the lead, followed by <em>Washington</em>, with <em>South Dakota</em> bringing up the rear. At 22:55 on <a href="November_14" title="wikilink">November 14</a>, radar on the <em>South Dakota</em> and <em>Washington</em> began to detect Kondo's oncoming ships near Savo Island around 18,000Â m range.<a href="#fn90" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref90"><sup>90</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="action-1">Action</h3>
<p>Kondo split his force into several groups, with one group, commanded by <a href="Shintaro_Hashimoto" title="wikilink">Shintaro Hashimoto</a> and consisting of <em>Sendai</em> and destroyers <a href="Japanese_destroyer_Shikinami_(1929)" title="wikilink"><em>Shikinami</em></a> and <a href="Japanese_destroyer_Uranami_(1928)" title="wikilink"><em>Uranami</em></a> (&quot;C&quot; on the maps), sweeping along the east side of Savo Island, and destroyer <a href="Japanese_destroyer_Ayanami_(1929)" title="wikilink"><em>Ayanami</em></a> (&quot;B&quot; on the maps) sweeping counterclockwise around the southwest side of Savo Island to check for the presence of Allied ships.<a href="#fn91" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref91"><sup>91</sup></a> The Japanese ships spotted Lee's force around 23:00, though Kondo misidentified the battleships as cruisers. Kondo ordered the <em>Sendai</em> group of ships, plus <em>Nagara</em> and four destroyers (&quot;D&quot; on the maps) to engage and destroy the U.S. force before he brought the bombardment force of <em>Kirishima</em> and heavy cruisers (&quot;E&quot; on the maps) into Ironbottom Sound.<a href="#fn92" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref92"><sup>92</sup></a> The U.S. ships (&quot;A&quot; on the maps) detected the <em>Sendai</em> force on radar but did not detect the other groups of Japanese ships. Using radar targeting, the two U.S. battleships opened fire on the <em>Sendai</em> group at 23:17. Admiral Lee ordered a cease fire about five minutes later after the radar returns on the northern group appeared to disappear from his ship's radar scopes. However, <em>Sendai</em>, <em>Uranami</em>, and <em>Shikinami</em> were undamaged and circled out of the danger area.<a href="#fn93" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref93"><sup>93</sup></a></p>
<p><img src="GuadalcanalMap2.gif" title="fig:Second phase of the engagement, 23:30&lt;U+2013&gt;02:00. Red lines are Japanese warship forces and black lines are U.S. warships.

Numbered yellow dots represent sinking warships." width="250" />Meanwhile, the four U.S. destroyers in the vanguard of the U.S. formation began engaging both <em>Ayanami</em> and the <em>Nagara</em> group of ships at 23:22. <em>Nagara</em> and her escorting destroyers responded effectively with accurate gunfire and torpedoes, and destroyers <a href="USS_Walke_(DD-416)" title="wikilink"><em>Walke</em></a> and <a href="USS_Preston_(DD-379)" title="wikilink"><em>Preston</em></a> were hit and sunk within 10Â minutes with heavy loss of life. The destroyer <a href="USS_Benham_(DD-397)" title="wikilink"><em>Benham</em></a> had part of her bow blown off by a torpedo and had to retreat (she sank the next day), and destroyer <a href="USS_Gwin_(DD-433)" title="wikilink"><em>Gwin</em></a> was hit in her engine room and put out of the fight.<a href="#fn94" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref94"><sup>94</sup></a> However, the U.S. destroyers had completed their mission as screens for the battleships, absorbing the initial impact of contact with the enemy, although at great cost.<a href="#fn95" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref95"><sup>95</sup></a> Lee ordered the retirement of <em>Benham</em> and <em>Gwin</em> at 23:48.<a href="#fn96" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref96"><sup>96</sup></a></p>
<p><em>Washington</em> passed through the area still occupied by the damaged and sinking U.S. destroyers and fired on <em>Ayanami</em> with her secondary batteries, setting her afire. Following close behind, <em>South Dakota</em> suddenly suffered a series of electrical failures, reportedly during repairs when her chief engineer locked down a <a href="circuit_breaker" title="wikilink">circuit breaker</a> in violation of safety procedures, causing her circuits repeatedly to go into <a href="Series_and_parallel_circuits" title="wikilink">series</a>, making her radar, radios, and most of her gun batteries inoperable. However, she continued to follow <em>Washington</em> towards the western side of Savo Island until 23:35, when <em>Washington</em> changed course left to pass to the southward behind the burning destroyers. <em>South Dakota</em> tried to follow but had to turn to right to avoid <em>Benham</em> which resulted in the ship being silhouetted by the fires of the burning destroyers and made her a closer and easier target for the Japanese.<a href="#fn97" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref97"><sup>97</sup></a></p>
<p>Receiving reports of the destruction of the U.S. destroyers from <em>Ayanami</em> and his other ships, Kondo pointed his bombardment force towards Guadalcanal, believing that the U.S. warship force had been defeated. His force and the two U.S. battleships were now heading towards each other.<a href="#fn98" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref98"><sup>98</sup></a></p>
<p>Almost blind and unable to effectively fire her main and secondary armament, <em>South Dakota</em> was illuminated by searchlights and targeted by gunfire and torpedoes by most of the ships of the Japanese force, including <em>Kirishima</em>, beginning about 00:00 on <a href="November_15" title="wikilink">November 15</a>. Although able to score a few hits on <em>Kirishima</em>, <em>South Dakota</em> took 25 medium and one large-caliber hit, some of which did not explode, that completely knocked out her communications and remaining gunfire control operations, set portions of her upper decks on fire, and forced her to try to steer away from the engagement. All of the Japanese torpedoes missed.<a href="#fn99" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref99"><sup>99</sup></a> Admiral Lee later described the cumulative effect of the gunfire damage to <em>South Dakota</em> as to, &quot;render one of our new battleships deaf, dumb, blind, and impotent.&quot;<a href="#fn100" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref100"><sup>100</sup></a> <em>South Dakota</em>'s crew casualties were 39 killed and 59 wounded, and she turned away from the battle at 00:17 without informing Admiral Lee, though observed by Kondo's lookouts.<a href="#fn101" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref101"><sup>101</sup></a><a href="#fn102" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref102"><sup>102</sup></a></p>
<p><img src="NavalGuadalcanalWashington.jpg" title="fig:Washington fires upon Kirishima during the battle on November 15. The low elevation of the gun barrels is because of the relatively close range of the two adversaries." alt="Washington fires upon Kirishima during the battle on November 15. The low elevation of the gun barrels is because of the relatively close range of the two adversaries." width="250" />The Japanese ships continued to concentrate their fire on <em>South Dakota</em> and none detected <em>Washington</em> approaching to within 9,000 yards (8 km). <em>Washington</em> was tracking a large target (<em>Kirishima</em>) for some time but refrained from firing since there was a chance it could be <em>South Dakota</em>. <em>Washington</em> had not been able to track <em>South Dakota</em>&lt;U+2019&gt;s movements because she was in a blind spot in the <em>Washington</em>&lt;U+2019&gt;s radar and Lee could not raise her on the radio to confirm her position. When the Japanese illuminated and fired on <em>South Dakota</em>, all doubts were removed as to which ships were friend or foe. From this close range, <em>Washington</em> opened fire and quickly hit <em>Kirishima</em> with at least nine main battery shells and almost forty secondary ones, causing heavy damage and setting her aflame. <em>Kirishima</em> was hit below the waterline and suffered a jammed rudder, causing her to circle uncontrollably to <a href="port_(nautical)" title="wikilink">port</a>.<a href="#fn103" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref103"><sup>103</sup></a></p>
<p>At 00:25 Kondo ordered all of his ships that were able to converge and destroy any remaining U.S. ships. However, the Japanese ships still did not know where <em>Washington</em> was located, and the other surviving U.S. ships had already departed the battle area. <em>Washington</em> steered a northwesterly course towards the <a href="Russell_Islands" title="wikilink">Russell Islands</a> to draw the Japanese force away from Guadalcanal and the presumably damaged <em>South Dakota</em>. The Japanese ships finally sighted <em>Washington</em> and launched several torpedo attacks, but by adroit maneuvering by her captain, <em>Washington</em> avoided all of them and also avoided grounding his ship in shallow waters. At length, believing that the way was clear for the transport convoy to proceed to Guadalcanal (but apparently disregarding the threat of air attack in the morning), Kondo ordered his remaining ships to break contact and retire from the area about 01:04, which most of the Japanese warships complied with by 01:30.<a href="#fn104" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref104"><sup>104</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="aftermath-1">Aftermath</h3>
<p>Both <em>Kirishima</em> and <em>Ayanami</em> were <a href="scuttling" title="wikilink">scuttled</a> and sank by 03:25, <a href="November_15" title="wikilink">November 15</a>.<a href="#fn105" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref105"><sup>105</sup></a> <em>Uranami</em> rescued survivors from <em>Ayanami</em> and destroyers <em>Asagumo</em>, <em>Teruzuki</em>, and <em>Samidare</em> rescued the remaining crew from <em>Kirishima</em>.<a href="#fn106" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref106"><sup>106</sup></a> In the engagement, 242 U.S. and 249 Japanese sailors died.<a href="#fn107" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref107"><sup>107</sup></a> The engagement was one of only two battleship-against-battleship surface battles in the entire Pacific campaign of World War II, the other being at the <a href="Battle_of_Surigao_Strait" title="wikilink">Surigao Strait</a> during the <a href="Battle_of_Leyte_Gulf" title="wikilink">Battle of Leyte Gulf</a>.</p>
<p><img src="BeachedTransports.jpg" title="fig:Two Japanese transports beached on Guadalcanal and burning on November 15" alt="Two Japanese transports beached on Guadalcanal and burning on November 15" width="250" />The four Japanese transports beached themselves at Tassafaronga on Guadalcanal by 04:00, <a href="November_15" title="wikilink">November 15</a> and Tanaka and the escort destroyers departed and raced back up the Slot towards safer waters. The transports were attacked, beginning at 05:55 by U.S. aircraft from Henderson Field and elsewhere, and field artillery from U.S. ground forces on Guadalcanal. Later, destroyer <a href="USS_Meade_(DD-602)" title="wikilink"><em>Meade</em></a> approached and opened fire on the beached transports and surrounding area. These attacks set the transports afire and destroyed any equipment on them that the Japanese had not managed to quickly unload. Only 2,000&lt;U+2013&gt;3,000 of the troops originally embarked actually made it to Guadalcanal, and most of their ammunition and food supplies were lost.<a href="#fn108" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref108"><sup>108</sup></a></p>
<p>Yamamoto's reaction to Kondo's failure to accomplish his mission of neutralizing Henderson Field and ensuring the safe landing of troops and supplies was milder than his earlier reaction to Abe's withdrawal, perhaps because of Imperial Navy culture and politics. Kondo, who also held the position of second in command of the Combined Fleet, was a member of the upper staff and battleship &quot;clique&quot; of the Imperial Navy while Abe was a career destroyer specialist. Admiral Kondo was not reprimanded or reassigned but instead was left in command of one of the large ship fleets based at Truk.<a href="#fn109" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref109"><sup>109</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="significance">Significance</h2>
<p>The failure to deliver to Guadalcanal most of the troops and supplies in the convoy prevented the Japanese from launching another offensive to retake Henderson Field. Thereafter, the Japanese Navy was only able to deliver subsistence supplies and a few replacement troops to Japanese Army forces on Guadalcanal. Because of the continuing threat from Allied aircraft based at Henderson Field, plus nearby U.S. <a href="aircraft_carriers" title="wikilink">aircraft carriers</a>, the Japanese had to continue to rely on Tokyo Express warship deliveries to their forces on Guadalcanal. However, these supplies and replacements were not enough to sustain Japanese troops on the island, who by <a href="December_7" title="wikilink">December 7</a>, <a href="1942" class="uri" title="wikilink">1942</a>, were losing about 50Â men each day from malnutrition, disease, and Allied ground or air attacks. On <a href="December_12" title="wikilink">December 12</a>, the Japanese Navy proposed that Guadalcanal be abandoned. Despite opposition from Japanese Army leaders, who still hoped that Guadalcanal could eventually be retaken from the Allies, Japan's <a href="Imperial_General_Headquarters" title="wikilink">Imperial General Headquarters</a>, with approval from the <a href="Emperor_of_Japan" title="wikilink">Emperor</a>, on <a href="December_31" title="wikilink">December 31</a>, <a href="1942" class="uri" title="wikilink">1942</a>, agreed to the evacuation of all Japanese forces from the island and establishment of a new line of defense for the Solomons on <a href="New_Georgia" title="wikilink">New Georgia</a>.<a href="#fn110" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref110"><sup>110</sup></a></p>
<p><img src="KinugawaMaru1.jpg" title="fig:The wreck of one of the four Japanese transports beached and destroyed at Guadalcanal on November 15, 1942, photographed one year later." alt="The wreck of one of the four Japanese transports beached and destroyed at Guadalcanal on November 15, 1942, photographed one year later." width="250" />  Thus, the Naval Battle of Guadalcanal was the last major attempt by the Japanese to seize control of the seas around Guadalcanal or to retake the island. In contrast, the U.S. Navy was thereafter able to resupply the U.S. forces at Guadalcanal at will, including the delivery of two fresh divisions by late December 1942. The inability to neutralize Henderson Field doomed the Japanese effort to successfully combat the Allied conquest of Guadalcanal.<a href="#fn111" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref111"><sup>111</sup></a> The last Japanese resistance in the Guadalcanal campaign ended on <a href="February_9" title="wikilink">February 9</a>, <a href="1943" class="uri" title="wikilink">1943</a>, with the successful evacuation of most of the surviving Japanese troops from the island by the Japanese navy in <a href="Operation_Ke" title="wikilink">Operation Ke</a>. Building on their success at Guadalcanal and elsewhere, the Allies continued their campaign against Japan, ultimately culminating in Japan's defeat and the end of World War II. U.S. <a href="President_of_the_United_States" title="wikilink">President</a> <a href="Franklin_Roosevelt" title="wikilink">Franklin Roosevelt</a>, upon learning of the results of the battle commented, &quot;It would seem that the turning point in this war has at last been reached.&quot;<a href="#fn112" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref112"><sup>112</sup></a></p>

Morison and Jersey state that 2,000 Japanese soldiers landed with 260 cases of ammunition and 1,500 bags of rice. Lost were provisions for 30,000 men for 20 days, 22,000 artillery shells, thousands of cases of small-arms ammunition, and 76 large and seven small landing craft. Realizing that the transports wouldn't have enough time to unload before daybreak, Tanaka asked permission to run them aground. Mikawa rejected his request, but Kondo accepted it, so Tanaka ordered the transport captains to run their ships aground. The American artillery that shelled the beached transports was from the 244th Coast Artillery Battalion and 3rd Defense Battalion, including two 155mm guns and several 5-inch guns.<a href="#fnref108" class="footnote-back">â©</a></li>
