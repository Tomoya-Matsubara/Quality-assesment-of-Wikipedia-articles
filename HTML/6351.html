<h2 id="college-career">College career</h2>
<p><img src="DAmendola.jpg" title="fig:Amendola as a freshman at Texas Tech" alt="Amendola as a freshman at Texas Tech" /> Amendola finished his college career at <a href="Texas_Tech_Red_Raiders_football" title="wikilink">Texas Tech</a> with 204 receptions for 2,246 yards and 15 <a href="touchdown" title="wikilink">touchdowns</a>. He also returned 116 punts for 1,283 yards and one TD, an 11.06 yards per return average ranking Amendola third all-time in school history in punt returns and yardage, behind only <a href="Wes_Welker" title="wikilink">Wes Welker</a> and Tyrone Thurman.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> Amendola's best year was his <a href="2007_Texas_Tech_Red_Raiders_football_team" title="wikilink">senior year</a>, in which he was overshadowed by teammate <a href="Michael_Crabtree" title="wikilink">Michael Crabtree</a>, but still recorded 109 catches for 1,245 yards and 6 TDs.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>During the 2005 season, Amendola made two memorable plays that led to Red Raider victories. The first was late in the 2005 game against <a href="Oklahoma_Sooners_football_under_Bob_Stoops#2005" title="wikilink">Oklahoma</a>. Tech was trailing. On fourth down, a <a href="Cody_Hodges" title="wikilink">Cody Hodges</a> pass attempt was tipped, and Amendola made a leaping catch in traffic. He was tackled immediately and appeared to have been stopped just short of a first down. However, the spot was reviewed by the replay officials and the final spot of the ball resulted in a first down. The drive was kept alive and resulted in yet another disputed call&lt;U+2014&gt;<a href="Taurean_Henderson" title="wikilink">Taurean Henderson</a>'s stretch over the goal line on the final play of regulation, which gave the Red Raiders the victory over the Sooners.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>Another game-changing play came when Amendola recovered the fumble from an intercepted pass during the final drive of the 2005 game against <a href="2005_Nebraska_Cornhuskers_football_team" title="wikilink">Nebraska</a>. Tech needed a touchdown to win. Tech quarterback <a href="Cody_Hodges" title="wikilink">Cody Hodges</a>' pass was tipped and intercepted. Instead of taking a knee to seal the victory, the Nebraska defender decided to run with the ball and had it stripped. Amendola dove for the loose ball and recovered it.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> Tech retained possession, resulting in a game-winning touchdown pass from Hodges to <a href="Joel_Filani" title="wikilink">Joel Filani</a> on fourth down with under 30 seconds remaining.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> Amendola graduated with a major in Communication Studies.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
