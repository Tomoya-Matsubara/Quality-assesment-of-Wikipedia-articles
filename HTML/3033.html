<p>Over the years, there have been several issues highlighted in American political commentator <a href="Bill_O&#39;Reilly_(commentator)" title="wikilink">Bill O'Reilly</a>'s print and broadcast work. He has drawn criticism from several individuals and groups including <a href="Al_Franken" title="wikilink">Al Franken</a>, <a href="Bill_Moyers" title="wikilink">Bill Moyers</a>,<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> <a href="David_Letterman" title="wikilink">David Letterman</a> in addition to <a href="Fairness_and_Accuracy_in_Reporting" title="wikilink">Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting</a>, <a href="Free_Press_(organization)" title="wikilink">Free Press</a>, <a href="Jon_Stewart" title="wikilink">Jon Stewart</a>, <a href="Keith_Olbermann" title="wikilink">Keith Olbermann</a>, and <a href="Media_Matters_for_America" title="wikilink">Media Matters for America</a>, usually in response to criticism by him or disputes of factual accuracy. <img src="Rsz_billoreilly.jpg" title="fig:O&#39;Reilly at Camp Striker in Iraq." alt="O&#39;Reilly at Camp Striker in Iraq." /></p>
<h2 id="analysis-of-bill-oreilly-and-his-methods">Analysis of Bill O'Reilly and his Methods</h2>
<h3 id="indiana-university-study">Indiana University study</h3>
<p>In early 2007, researchers from the <a href="Indiana_University" title="wikilink">Indiana University</a> School of Journalism published a report in the <a href="academic_journal" title="wikilink">academic journal</a> <em>Journalism Studies</em> that analyzed the Talking Points Memo segment that opens most <em><a href="O&#39;Reilly_Factor" title="wikilink">O'Reilly Factor</a></em> broadcasts. Using analysis techniques developed in the 1930s by the <a href="Institute_for_Propaganda_Analysis" title="wikilink">Institute for Propaganda Analysis</a>, the researchers compared O'Reilly's comments and style to a 1939 study of Father <a href="Charles_Coughlin" title="wikilink">Charles Coughlin</a>. Among the conclusions, the study found that O'Reilly used <a href="propaganda" class="uri" title="wikilink">propaganda</a> far more often than Coughlin and that he was three times more likely to be a &quot;name caller&quot;. The report also found &quot;a consistent pattern of O'Reilly casting non-Americans in a negative light. Both <a href="illegal_alien" title="wikilink">illegal aliens</a> and foreigners were constructed as physical threats to the public and never featured in the role of victim or hero.&quot;<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a><a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>O'Reilly criticized the study. He asserted that &quot;the terms '<a href="conservative" class="uri" title="wikilink">conservative</a>,' '<a href="Liberalism" title="wikilink">liberal</a>,' '<a href="Left-wing_politics" title="wikilink">left</a>,' '<a href="Right-wing_politics" title="wikilink">right</a>,' '<a href="Progressivism" title="wikilink">progressive</a>,' 'traditional' or '<a href="centrism" title="wikilink">centrist</a>' were treated as name-calling if they were associated with a problem or social ill.&quot; The study's authors responded that O'Reilly was incorrect and that, as the study itself said, &quot;We did not count 'liberal, conservative, centrist' as name-calling unless they were linked to a derogatory qualifier. O'Reilly's reference to &quot;<a href="Kool-Aid" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kool-Aid</a> left&quot; is an example of what we counted as name-calling. Or is the reference to folks of a particular political persuasion as a <a href="cult" class="uri" title="wikilink">cult</a> on a <a href="suicide" class="uri" title="wikilink">suicide</a> mission fair and balanced reporting?&quot;<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> O'Reilly also claimed that Indiana University has received millions of dollars from <a href="George_Soros" title="wikilink">George Soros</a>' <a href="Open_Society_Institute" title="wikilink">Open Society Institute</a>.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> The authors refuted O'Reilly's claim, responding that they had received no funding at all, including from Soros, for the study.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p><a href="Fox_News" title="wikilink">Fox News</a> producer Ron Mitchell also wrote an op-ed criticizing the study. He echoed O'Reilly's charge that too many terms were counted as name-calling and pointed to &quot;buried headline&quot; as an example. He also accused the authors of seeking to manipulate their research to fit a predetermined outcome. Mitchell argued that by using tools developed for examining propaganda, the researchers presupposed that O'Reilly propagandized.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> He also pointed to a section in which the authors describe making changes to their &quot;coding instrument&quot; because the first attempts generated &quot;unacceptably low scores.&quot; The authors responded that their study had been extensively vetted through two rounds of anonymous peer review prior to publication. They also pointed out that the methodology that Mitchell criticized was accepted scientific practice that is put in place to prevent bias, not to create it.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> Specifically, a Media Matters response piece said that Mitchell misunderstood what a &quot;coding instrument&quot; is. The methodology called for individual researchers (&quot;coders&quot;) to analyze broadcasts and code their findings into a database. The mention of &quot;unacceptably low scores&quot; did not mean that initial methods found too few instances of O'Reilly calling names; instead, it referred to &quot;unacceptably low&quot; consistency between coders analyzing the same data.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>

<p>Peter Hart (a media analyst for the progressive <a href="Fairness_and_Accuracy_in_Reporting" title="wikilink">Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting</a>) is the co-author of <em>The Oh Really Factor: Unspinning Fox News Channel's Bill O'Reilly.</em><a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> In the 2004 documentary <em><a href="Outfoxed:_Rupert_Murdoch&#39;s_War_on_Journalism" title="wikilink">Outfoxed: Rupert Murdoch's War on Journalism</a></em>, Hart states that <em><a href="The_O&#39;Reilly_Factor" title="wikilink">The O'Reilly Factor</a></em> is a &quot;perfect example&quot; of what is wrong with Fox News Channel, alleging that the <a href="United_States_Republican_Party" title="wikilink">Republican Party</a> gets favored treatment over the <a href="United_States_Democrat_Party" title="wikilink">Democratic Party</a>.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="selective-editing">Selective Editing</h3>
<p>In an <a href="Air_America_Radio" title="wikilink">Air America</a> broadcast on the <a href="Sundance_Channel" title="wikilink">Sundance Channel</a>, <a href="Al_Franken" title="wikilink">Al Franken</a> criticized O'Reilly for selectively and misleadingly editing a <a href="June_5" title="wikilink">June 5</a>, <a href="2005" class="uri" title="wikilink">2005</a> interview of <a href="Joe_Biden" title="wikilink">Senator Joseph Biden</a> by <a href="George_Stephanopoulos" title="wikilink">George Stephanopoulos</a>.

O'Reilly accused Biden of misusing the prison abuse story and then presented the missing part of Biden's remarks as his own opinion: &quot;The <a href="Bush_administration" title="wikilink">Bush administration</a> should set up an independent commission to investigate American detainee policy across the board. The president must take the offensive on this, or else the country's image will continue to suffer and the <a href="jihad" title="wikilink">jihadists</a> and their enablers will win another victory.&quot; Franken criticized this as a misrepresentation by O'Reilly.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="marvin-kitman-and-his-oreilly-biography">Marvin Kitman and his O'Reilly biography</h3>
<p>In January 2007, <a href="St._Martin&#39;s_Press" title="wikilink">St. Martin's Press</a> released a biography <em>The Man Who Would Not Shut Up: The Rise of Bill O'Reilly</em>, written by longtime <em><a href="Newsday" class="uri" title="wikilink">Newsday</a></em> TV critic Marvin Kitman. O'Reilly initially cooperated with the author by giving him 29 interviews. According to Kitman, O'Reilly was going to help promote and publicize the book until, just prior to publication, they had a disagreement over the inclusion of a chapter covering Andrea Mackris' 2004 sexual harassment lawsuit against O'Reilly.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> After the book came out with the chapter included, Kitman asserts that O'Reilly, instead of promoting the book, attempted to bury it by &quot;intimidating&quot; and &quot;terrorizing&quot; Fox News reporters to keep them from giving Kitman interviews.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
<p>In an interview with Keith Olbermann, Kitman criticized O'Reilly as &quot;kind of a hypocrite&quot; by pointing out O'Reilly's belief that journalists should not attempt to flatter or indulge the people they cover. &quot;Throughout all my interviews,&quot; Kitman said, &quot;[O'Reilly] was telling me that nobody could ever tell him what question to ask, or what to say.&quot; However, when the subject was O'Reilly himself, Kitman said that &quot;it turned out that he&lt;U+2018&gt;s not so much in favor of telling it like it is, but like it isn&lt;U+2018&gt;t&quot;.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> Kitman also said he found it strange that O'Reilly sought to suppress the book when it cast him in a generally favorable light. When speaking to Olbermann, Kitman said, &quot;This is the only book that&lt;U+2018&gt;s ever said anything positive about Bill, except for the six he wrote about himself.&quot;<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> Several critics agree that the book's portrayal is fair.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a><a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="conflicting-comments-on-teen-pregnancy">Conflicting comments on teen pregnancy</h3>
<p>O'Reilly criticized the news media for addressing the matter of Vice Presidential nominee <a href="Sarah_Palin" title="wikilink">Sarah Palin</a>'s seventeen year-old, unwed daughter's pregnancy. O'Reilly claimed it was a strictly private family matter and that Palin could not be responsible for her daughter's actions. The <a href="Atlanta_Journal_Constitution" title="wikilink">Atlanta Journal Constitution</a>'s Editorial Page Editor <a href="Cynthia_Tucker" title="wikilink">Cynthia Tucker</a>, <a href="Jon_Stewart" title="wikilink">Jon Stewart</a> and the <a href="Huffington_Post" title="wikilink">Huffington Post</a> each noted that O'Reilly himself had several months earlier criticized another unwed pregnant teenager, <a href="Jamie_Lynn_Spears" title="wikilink">Jamie Lynn Spears</a>, sixteen at the time, labeling her a &quot;pinhead&quot; and calling her parents irresponsible.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> <a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a><a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> <a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a><a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> In response to Tucker's criticism, O'Reilly sent a producer to confront her outside her home. During the brief confrontation, Tucker defended her column and her opinion that O'Reilly is a &quot;hypocrite.&quot;<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a><a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> <a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> <a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="critics-and-rivals">Critics and Rivals</h2>
<p>O'Reilly has been involved in numerous controversies and rivalries with various people and organizations. Some of the more notable are <a href="Media_Matters_for_America" title="wikilink">Media Matters for America</a>, <a href="Al_Franken" title="wikilink">Al Franken</a>, <a href="George_Soros" title="wikilink">George Soros</a> and <a href="Keith_Olbermann" title="wikilink">Keith Olbermann</a>.</p>

<p>Media Matters for America describes itself as a politically <a href="progressive" class="uri" title="wikilink">progressive</a>, <a href="Internet" title="wikilink">web</a>-based, <a href="non-profit_organization" title="wikilink">non-profit organization</a> that reports and criticizes what it describes as &quot;conservative <a href="misinformation" class="uri" title="wikilink">misinformation</a> in the U.S. media.&quot;<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> O'Reilly is often the subject of Media Matters' online reports.</p>
<p>O'Reilly has referred to Media Matters as &quot;smear merchants,&quot; and &quot;the most vile, despicable human beings on the planet,&quot; and has expressed distaste for the site he claims is funded by George Soros.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> Media Matters maintains that it has never received funding from Soros &quot;either directly or through another organization.&quot;<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> Media Matters founder <a href="David_Brock" title="wikilink">David Brock</a> says that he has repeatedly requested that O'Reilly debate him on O'Reilly's program and that O'Reilly has refused.

<h3 id="al-franken">Al Franken</h3>
<p><img src="Al_Franken_at_Rammstein_Air_Force_Base,_Dec_2000.JPEG" title="fig:Al Franken." alt="Al Franken." /> <a href="Al_Franken" title="wikilink">Al Franken</a>'s 2003 book <em><a href="Lies_and_the_Lying_Liars_Who_Tell_Them" title="wikilink">Lies and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them: A Fair and Balanced Look At the Right</a></em> included a picture of O'Reilly on the cover and a chapter devoted to him inside. In his book, Franken accused O'Reilly of distorting facts both to serve conservative politics and to improve his public image. The two men participated in a panel discussion at the 2003 BookExpoAmerica (which was televised on <a href="C-SPAN" class="uri" title="wikilink">C-SPAN</a>). Franken described O'Reilly's denial of erroneous statements regarding receiving two <a href="Peabody_Award" title="wikilink">Peabody Awards</a>. After Franken spoke, the two men argued.</p>
<p>Following the <a href="Book_TV" title="wikilink">Book TV</a> argument, <a href="Fox_v._Franken" title="wikilink">Fox News sued Franken</a> for <a href="trademark_infringement" title="wikilink">trademark infringement</a> over the use of the phrase &quot;fair and balanced&quot; in the book's title. O'Reilly has generally said that he was not involved in the lawsuit. In an interview with <em><a href="Time_magazine" title="wikilink">Time</a></em>, O'Reilly was asked if he &quot;regrets pushing the lawsuit against Al Franken&quot;, to which he replied, &quot;Not at all.&quot;<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> When the case reached court, the presiding judge denied Fox's request for <a href="injunctive_relief" title="wikilink">injunctive relief</a> and described the case as &quot;wholly without merit, both factually and legally&quot;. <a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> Fox then dropped the suit. O'Reilly later said he had considered personally suing Franken for <a href="defamation" class="uri" title="wikilink">defamation</a> but was told that, as a public person, the <a href="standard_of_proof" title="wikilink">standard of proof</a> would be too high to sustain a lawsuit.</p>
<h3 id="keith-olbermann">Keith Olbermann</h3>

<p>Olbermann's show <em><a href="Countdown_with_Keith_Olbermann" title="wikilink">Countdown</a></em> on <a href="MSNBC" class="uri" title="wikilink">MSNBC</a>, which airs opposite <em>The O'Reilly Factor</em>, is highly critical of O'Reilly. Olbermann frequently names O'Reilly in the &quot;Worst Persons in the World&quot; segment of the program. On <em>Countdown</em>, Olbermann had also previously initiated an unsuccessful campaign to &quot;Save the Tapes&quot;, referring to the rumor that there exist tapes of O'Reilly making lurid phone sex calls to <a href="Andrea_Mackris" title="wikilink">Andrea Mackris</a>, a former producer of his show. Mackris sued O'Reilly for <a href="sexual_harassment" title="wikilink">sexual harassment</a> and the suit was <a href="legal_settlement" title="wikilink">settled</a> out of court. O'Reilly also sued Mackris for attempted <a href="extortion" class="uri" title="wikilink">extortion</a>, but dropped the case when her suit was settled. O'Reilly never refers to Olbermann specifically, usually just saying &quot;NBC News&quot; instead.</p>
<h3 id="financial-bailout-criticism-of-right-wing-radio">2008 Financial Bailout: Criticism of Right wing radio</h3>
<p>O'Reilly criticized conservative radio hosts for opposing the $700 billion <a href="Emergency_Economic_Stabilization_Act_of_2008" title="wikilink">bailout</a>. He said, &quot;Most talk radio is conservative-dominated, ideologue, Kool-Aid&lt;U+2013&gt;drinking idiots.&quot; Conservative radio host <a href="Mark_Levin" title="wikilink">Mark Levin</a> fired back, by saying about O'Reilly &quot;He&lt;U+2019&gt;s another mainstream, moron, phony journalist&quot;.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a><a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a></p>

<h2 id="notable-controversies">Notable Controversies</h2>
<p>Bill O'Reilly has been involved in several controversies throughout the years.</p>
<h3 id="malmedy-massacre-controversy">Malmedy massacre controversy</h3>
<p>On <a href="October_3" title="wikilink">October 3</a>, <a href="2005" class="uri" title="wikilink">2005</a>, retired four-star general <a href="Wesley_Clark" title="wikilink">Wesley Clark</a> was a guest on <em>The O'Reilly Factor</em>. A topic of debate on the program was a ruling regarding the potential release of more photos from the infamous <a href="Abu_Ghraib" title="wikilink">Abu Ghraib</a> prison in Iraq. Clark defended the release of the additional Abu Ghraib photos saying the country needed to know what happened. While debating with Clark, O'Reilly incorrectly stated a historical fact of <a href="World_War_II" title="wikilink">World War II</a> when he said &quot;General, you need to look at the <a href="Malmedy_massacre" title="wikilink">Malmedy massacre</a> in World War II and the <a href="82nd_Airborne_Division_(United_States)" title="wikilink">82nd Airborne</a> that did it.&quot; Historically, German troops were actually responsible for the massacre of 84 American soldiers in the town of <a href="Malmedy" class="uri" title="wikilink">Malmedy</a>, <a href="Belgium" class="uri" title="wikilink">Belgium</a> during World War II.</p>
<p>On <a href="May_30" title="wikilink">May 30</a>, <a href="2006" class="uri" title="wikilink">2006</a>, Clark again appeared on The O'Reilly Factor. While discussing &quot;the apparent murder of Iraqi civilians in <a href="Haditha" class="uri" title="wikilink">Haditha</a>&quot;, O'Reilly once again incorrectly referred to the Malmedy massacre, stating &quot;In Malmedy, as you know, US forces captured <a href="SS" class="uri" title="wikilink">SS</a> forces, who had their hands in the air and they were unarmed and they shot them down. You know that. That's on the record; [it's] been documented.&quot;<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a></p>
<p>The next day, on <a href="May_31" title="wikilink">May 31</a>, <a href="2006" class="uri" title="wikilink">2006</a>, O'Reilly addressed a viewer email regarding the inaccuracy. As reported on <em>The O'Reilly Factor</em>, the email came from a <a href="Fort_Worth" title="wikilink">Fort Worth</a> Texas viewer named Donn Caldwell and stated: &quot;Bill, you mentioned Malmedy as the site of an American massacre during World War II. It was the other way around, the <a href="SS" class="uri" title="wikilink">SS</a> shot down U.S. prisoners.&quot; O'Reilly responded to this by saying: &quot;In the heat of the debate with General Clark my statement wasn't clear enough Mr. Caldwell. After Malmedy, some German captives were executed by American troops.&quot;<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a></p>
<p>According to Keith Olbermann, &quot;Fox washed its transcript of O'Reilly's remarks&quot; altering the line to &quot;In <em><a href="Normandy" class="uri" title="wikilink">Normandy</a></em>, as you know, US forces captured SS forces&quot; when the video clearly shows that O'Reilly said &quot;Malmedy&quot; rather than &quot;Normandy.&quot;<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a></p>
<p>This second instance of O'Reilly misstating the facts of the massacre, combined with his denial of doing so and the apparent cover up in the transcript by Fox News prompted a harsh response on the <a href="June_1" title="wikilink">June 1</a>, <a href="2006" class="uri" title="wikilink">2006</a> edition of <a href="MSNBC" class="uri" title="wikilink">MSNBC</a>'s <em>Countdown with Keith Olbermann.</em><a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a> Countdown showed video clips of O'Reilly making these incorrect statements from the October 3 and May 30 editions of <em>The O'Reilly Factor</em> and showed the clip of O'Reilly addressing the viewer email the following day. Olbermann lambasted O'Reilly, calling him a &quot;false patriot who would rather be loud than right.&quot; He also compared the editing of the transcript to <a href="George_Orwell" title="wikilink">George Orwell</a>'s <a href="1984_(novel)" title="wikilink"><em>1984</em></a>.</p>
<p>After the airing, Fox News corrected the afore-mentioned transcript on June 2, which was noted in a follow up report on <em>Countdown with Keith Olbermann</em> the following Monday.<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a> The <em>Media Matters for America</em> website also posted a report detailing the correction of the transcript that same day.<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="jeremy-glick">Jeremy Glick</h3>
<p>On his televised program on <a href="February_4" title="wikilink">February 4</a>, <a href="2003" class="uri" title="wikilink">2003</a>, O'Reilly interviewed Jeremy Glick (co-author of <em>Another World is Possible</em>), whose father had been killed in the <a href="September_11_attacks" title="wikilink">September 11 attacks</a>. Glick had signed an anti-war ad that made comments relating the attacks to atrocities in <a href="Baghdad" class="uri" title="wikilink">Baghdad</a>, <a href="Panama_City" title="wikilink">Panama City</a> and <a href="Vietnam" class="uri" title="wikilink">Vietnam</a>. After Glick accused O'Reilly of evoking &quot;9/11 to rationalize everything from domestic plunder to <a href="imperialism" title="wikilink">imperialistic</a> aggression worldwide&quot;, and also of evoking &quot;sympathy with the 9/11 families&quot; to do the same, O'Reilly became visibly angered with Glick and said, &quot;That's a bunch of crap. I've done more for the 9/11 families by their own admission — I've done more for them than you will ever hope to do&quot;. At one point in the interview, O'Reilly told Glick to &quot;shut up&quot; and said, &quot;I don't really care what you think.&quot; The short and heated segment ended with O'Reilly giving the command to his staff to cut Glick's microphone.<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a><a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a></p>

<p>Franken called Lloyd Grove, a reporter for <em><a href="The_Washington_Post" title="wikilink">The Washington Post</a>,</em> who called O'Reilly and asked him about his statements.

He has rejected the characterization that he was lying and maintained that he never said that he personally won any such award.

<h3 id="controversy-about-oreillys-childhood-home-and-upbringing">Controversy about O'Reilly's childhood home and upbringing</h3>
<p>O'Reilly has long said that his inspiration for speaking up for average Americans, or what he calls &quot;the folks&quot;, are his <a href="working-class" class="uri" title="wikilink">working-class</a> roots. He has pointed to his boyhood home in lower-middle-class <a href="Levittown,_New_York" title="wikilink">Levittown, New York</a> as a credential. In an interview with <em><a href="The_Washington_Post" title="wikilink">The Washington Post</a></em>, O'Reilly's mother said that her family lived in <a href="Westbury,_New_York" title="wikilink">Westbury</a>,<a href="#fn73" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref73"><sup>73</sup></a> which is a few miles from Levittown. Citing this interview, <a href="Al_Franken" title="wikilink">Al Franken</a>, <a href="Michael_Kinsley" title="wikilink">Michael Kinsley</a>, and others have accused O'Reilly of distorting his background to create a more working-class image.</p>
<p>O'Reilly has countered that <em>The Washington Post</em> misquoted his mother,<a href="#fn74" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref74"><sup>74</sup></a> and he said his mother still lives in his childhood home, which was built by William Levitt. O'Reilly placed a copy of the house's mortgage, which shows a Levittown postal address, on his website. Levittown was redrawn into a squarish shape<a href="#fn75" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref75"><sup>75</sup></a> to conform with the 11756 <a href="ZIP_code" title="wikilink">ZIP code</a>, which was introduced in 1963. After this time the O'Reilly home was located in <a href="Westbury,_New_York" title="wikilink">Westbury</a>. On a 2005 episode of <em><a href="The_Al_Franken_Show" title="wikilink">The Al Franken Show</a></em>, Franken invited a <a href="Long_Island" title="wikilink">Long Island</a> historian onto the show, and she said that O'Reilly's statement about having lived in &quot;the Westbury section of Levittown&quot; was generally accurate and that the house could fairly be described as being in either town. She also said that O'Reilly's neighborhood was not the &quot;hardscrabble&quot; environment he suggested it was.<a href="#fn76" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref76"><sup>76</sup></a></p>
<p>O'Reilly has also said, &quot;You don't come from any lower than I came from on an economic scale&quot;<a href="#fn77" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref77"><sup>77</sup></a> and that his father &quot;never earned more than $35,000 a year in his life.&quot; <a href="Fairness_and_Accuracy_in_Reporting" title="wikilink">Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting</a> has calculated that adjusted for <a href="inflation" class="uri" title="wikilink">inflation</a>, $35,000 in 1978 would be worth over $90,000 in 2001 dollars.<a href="#fn78" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref78"><sup>78</sup></a> O'Reilly has retorted that his father's $35,000 income only came at the end of his long career, at which point O'Reilly would have been long independent of his parents. <a href="#fn79" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref79"><sup>79</sup></a></p>

No.&quot; He continued, &quot;I&lt;U+2019&gt;m not in fear of the lesbians beating me up tonight.&quot; Robinson called O'Reilly's response a &quot;non-apology apology&quot; and added that &quot;the story is a complete and total fabrication, and he still has failed to offer one shred of evidence as to why it&lt;U+2019&gt;s legitimate news.&quot;<a href="#fn83" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref83"><sup>83</sup></a></p>

He didn't have to go to school, he could run around and do whatever he wanted&lt;U+2026&gt;there was an element here that this kid liked about this circumstance.&quot; He then went on to say that Hornbeck was probably maladjusted before being abducted.

<p>On the <a href="Huffington_Post" title="wikilink">Huffington Post</a> blog, author <a href="Earl_Ofari_Hutchinson" title="wikilink">Earl Ofari Hutchinson</a> wrote that the comments &quot;looked and sounded dumb and racist&quot;, but O'Reilly &quot;didn't say anything that was earth shatteringly offensive&quot; or anything that others might not say in private.<a href="#fn109" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref109"><sup>109</sup></a> Also on the Huffington Post, Eric Deggans, chairman of the Black Journalists Media Monitoring Committee, said that O'Reilly's history of using racially charged rhetoric suggests that he stereotyped black people as &quot;either vocal protesters like Sharpton and Jesse Jackson or straight-up thugs like <a href="N.W.A." class="uri" title="wikilink">N.W.A.</a>&quot; Deggans said that he found it unfortunate that it &quot;took a lunch with Al Sharpton&quot; for O'Reilly to realize otherwise.<a href="#fn110" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref110"><sup>110</sup></a></p>
<p><a href="Juan_Williams" title="wikilink">Juan Williams</a> said the criticism of O'Reilly was &lt;U+201C&gt;rank dishonesty&lt;U+201D&gt; and that the original comments &quot;had nothing to do with racist ranting by anybody except by these idiots at CNN.&quot;<a href="#fn111" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref111"><sup>111</sup></a> Williams went on to say it was &quot;frustrating&quot; that the media try to criticize anyone who wanted to have an honest discussion about race.<a href="#fn112" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref112"><sup>112</sup></a></p>
<p>On the <a href="Today_(NBC_program)" title="wikilink"><em>Today</em> show</a>, host <a href="Matt_Lauer" title="wikilink">Matt Lauer</a> said, &quot;I thought Bill O'Reilly was saying that we should not be surprised.&quot; He said O'Reilly's point is that &quot;the small group of people&quot; who think that certain rappers represent all African Americans &quot;need to get out and live life a little bit&quot;. Lauer later speculated that O'Reilly would want to get &quot;a do-over&quot; and phrase his comments differently.<a href="#fn113" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref113"><sup>113</sup></a></p>
<p>Following the controversy, Jesse Jackson made his first appearance on the <em>O'Reilly Factor</em>.<a href="#fn114" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref114"><sup>114</sup></a> Jackson asked O'Reilly what he had intended by his comments and said that &quot;to underestimate the civility of black people was offensive&quot; but that the controversy over O'Reilly's remarks had obscured other, more important issues.<a href="#fn115" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref115"><sup>115</sup></a></p>
