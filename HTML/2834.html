Until the fifteenth century, those Scots who wished to attend university had to travel to England, or to the Continent. This situation was transformed by the founding of <a href="St_John&#39;s_College,_St_Andrews" title="wikilink">St John's College, St Andrews</a> in 1418 by <a href="Henry_Wardlaw" title="wikilink">Henry Wardlaw</a>, bishop of St. Andrews. <a href="St_Salvator&#39;s_College,_St_Andrews" title="wikilink">St Salvator's College</a> was added to St. Andrews in 1450. The other great bishoprics followed, with the <a href="University_of_Glasgow" title="wikilink">University of Glasgow</a> being founded in 1451 and <a href="King&#39;s_College,_Aberdeen" title="wikilink">King's College, Aberdeen</a> in 1495. Initially, these institutions were designed for the training of clerics, but they would increasingly be used by laymen. International contacts helped integrate Scotland into a wider European scholarly world and would be one of the most important ways in which the new ideas of Humanism were brought into Scottish intellectual life in the sixteenth century.</p>
<p><a href="St_Leonard&#39;s_College_(University_of_St_Andrews)" title="wikilink">St Leonard's College</a> was founded in Aberdeen in 1511 and St John's College as <a href="St_Mary&#39;s_College,_St_Andrews" title="wikilink">St Mary's College, St Andrews</a> was re-founded in 1538, as a Humanist academy for the training of clerics. Public lectures that were established in Edinburgh in the 1540s would eventually become the University of Edinburgh in 1582. After the Reformation, Scotland's universities underwent a series of reforms associated with <a href="Andrew_Melville" title="wikilink">Andrew Melville</a>, who was influenced by the anti-Aristotelian <a href="Pierre_Ramus" title="wikilink">Pierre Ramus</a>. In 1617 James IV decreed that the town college of Edinburgh should be known as King James's College. In 1641, the two colleges at Aberdeen were united by decree of <a href="Charles_I_of_England" title="wikilink">Charles I</a> (r. 1625-49), to form the &quot;King Charles University of Aberdeen&quot;. Under the <a href="Scotland_under_the_Commonwealth" title="wikilink">Commonwealth</a> (1652&lt;U+2013&gt;60), the universities saw an improvement in their funding. After the <a href="Restoration_in_Scotland" title="wikilink">Restoration</a> there was a purge of Presbyterians from the universities, but most of the intellectual advances of the preceding period were preserved. The colleges at St. Andrews were demerged. The five Scottish university colleges recovered from the disruption of the civil war years and Restoration with a lecture-based curriculum that was able to embrace economics and science, offering a high-quality liberal education to the sons of the nobility and gentry.</p>
<p>In the eighteenth century the universities went from being small and parochial institutions, largely for the training of clergy and lawyers, to major intellectual centres at the forefront of Scottish identity and life, seen as fundamental to democratic principles and the opportunity for social advancement for the talented. Chairs of medicine were founded at all the university towns. By the 1740s Edinburgh medical school was the major centre of medicine in Europe and was a leading centre in the Atlantic world. Access to Scottish universities was probably more open than in contemporary England, Germany or France. Attendance was less expensive and the student body more representative of society as a whole. The system was flexible and the curriculum became a modern philosophical and scientific one, in keeping with contemporary needs for improvement and progress. Scotland reaped the intellectual benefits of this system in its contribution to the <a href="European_Enlightenment" title="wikilink">European Enlightenment</a>. Many of the key figures of the Scottish Enlightenment were university professors, who developed their ideas in university lectures.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the nineteenth century, Scotland's five university colleges had no entrance exam, students typically entered at ages of 15 or 16, attended for as little as two years, chose which lectures to attend and left without qualifications. The curriculum was dominated by divinity and the law and there was a concerted attempt to modernise the curriculum, particularly by introducing degrees in the physical sciences and the need to reform the system to meet the needs of the emerging middle classes and the professions. The result of these reforms was a revitalisation of the Scottish university system, which expanded to 6,254 students by the end of the century and produced leading figures in both the arts and sciences. In the first half of the twentieth century Scottish universities fell behind those in England and Europe in terms of participation and investment. After the <a href="Robbins_Report" title="wikilink">Robbins Report</a> of 1963 there was a rapid expansion in higher education in Scotland. By the end of the decade the number of Scottish Universities had doubled. New universities included the <a href="University_of_Dundee" title="wikilink">University of Dundee</a>, <a href="University_of_Strathclyde" title="wikilink">Strathclyde</a>, <a href="Heriot-Watt_University" title="wikilink">Heriot-Watt</a>, <a href="University_of_Stirling" title="wikilink">Stirling</a>. From the 1970s the government preferred to expand higher education in the non-university sector and by the late 1980s roughly half of students in higher education were in colleges. In 1992, under the <a href="Further_and_Higher_Education_Act_1992" title="wikilink">Further and Higher Education Act 1992</a>, the distinction between universities and colleges was removed, creating new universities at <a href="Abertay_University" title="wikilink">Abertay</a>, <a href="Glasgow_Caledonian_University" title="wikilink">Glasgow Caledonian</a>, <a href="Napier_University" title="wikilink">Napier</a>, <a href="Paisley_University" title="wikilink">Paisley</a> and <a href="Robert_Gordon_University" title="wikilink">Robert Gordon</a>.</p>

He produced an edition of the works of <a href="Shakespeare" class="uri" title="wikilink">Shakespeare</a> and is best known for <em>Sermons</em> (1777&lt;U+2013&gt;1801), a five-volume endorsement of practical Christian morality, and Lectures on Rhetoric and <em>Belles Lettres</em> (1783), an essay on literary composition, which was to have a major impact on the work of Adam Smith. He was also one of the figures who first drew the <a href="Ossian" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ossian</a> cycle of <a href="James_Macpherson" title="wikilink">James Macpherson</a> to public attention.<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a></p>

<p><img src="Marischalcollege1.jpg" title="fig:Marischal College with the new front under construction; c. 1900" alt="Marischal College with the new front under construction; c. 1900" /> At the beginning of the nineteenth century, Scotland's five university colleges had about 3,000 students between them.<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a> They had no entrance exam, students typically entered at ages of 15 or 16, attended for as little as two years, chose which lectures to attend and left without qualifications.<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a> Although Scottish universities had gained a formidable reputation in the eighteenth century, the curriculum was dominated by divinity and the law and there was a concerted attempt to modernise the curriculum, particularly by introducing degrees in the physical sciences and the need to reform the system to meet the needs of the emerging middle classes and the professions.<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a> The result was two commissions of inquiry in 1826 and 1876 and reforming acts of parliament in <a href="Universities_(Scotland)_Act_1858" title="wikilink">1858</a> and <a href="Universities_(Scotland)_Act_1889" title="wikilink">1889</a>.<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a></p>
<p>The curriculum and system of graduation were reformed. Entrance examinations that were equivalent to the School Leaving Certificate were introduced and average ages of entry rose to 17 or 18. Standard patterns of graduation in the arts curriculum offered three-year ordinary and four-year honours degrees.<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a> There was resistance among professors, particularly among chairs of divinity and classics, to the introduction of new subjects, especially the physical sciences. The crown established <a href="Regius_Professor" title="wikilink">Regius chairs</a>, all in the sciences, including medicine, chemistry, natural history and botany. The chair of Engineering at Glasgow was the first of its kind in the world. By the 1870s the physical sciences were well established in Scottish universities, whereas in England the battle to modernise the curriculum would not be complete until the end of the century.<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a> The new separate science faculties were able to move away from the compulsory Latin, Greek and philosophy of the old MA curriculum.<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a> Under the commissions, all the universities were restructured. They were given <a href="University_Court" title="wikilink">Courts</a>, which included external members and who oversaw the finances of the institution.<a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a> <a href="Students&#39;_Representative_Council" title="wikilink">Students' Representative Councils</a> were founded in 1884 and ratified under the 1889 act.<a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a> Under this act new arts subjects were established, with chairs in Modern History, French, German and Political Economy.<a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a></p>

It was restructured by commissioners appointed under the 1858 act and began a revival.<a href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a> It pioneered the admission of women to Scottish universities, creating the <a href="Lady_Literate_in_Arts" title="wikilink">Lady Literate in Arts</a> (LLA) in 1882, which proved highly popular. From 1892 Scottish universities could all admit and graduate women, with St Andrews the first to do so, and the numbers of women at Scottish universities steadily increased from this point until the early twentieth century.<a href="#fn67" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a> A new college of St Andrews was opened in the thriving burgh of <a href="University_of_Dundee" title="wikilink">Dundee</a> in 1883, allowing the university to teach sciences and open a <a href="University_of_St_Andrews_School_of_Medicine" title="wikilink">medical school</a>.<a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a> The University of Glasgow became a leader in British higher education by providing the educational needs of youth from the urban and commercial classes.<a href="#fn69" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref69"><sup>69</sup></a> It moved from the city centre to a new set of grand <a href="Gothic_Revival_architecture" title="wikilink">neo-Gothic</a> buildings, paid for largely by public subscription, at Gilmorehill in 1870.<a href="#fn70" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a> The two colleges at Aberdeen were considered too small to be viable and they were restructured as the <a href="University_of_Aberdeen" title="wikilink">University of Aberdeen</a> in 1860. Marischal College was rebuilt in the Gothic style from 1900.<a href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a> Unlike the other Medieval and ecclesiastical foundations, because the <a href="University_of_Edinburgh" title="wikilink">University of Edinburgh</a> was a civic college it was relatively poor. In 1858 it was taken out of the care of the city and established on a similar basis to the other ancient universities.<a href="#fn72" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref72"><sup>72</sup></a></p>
<p><img src="Hubert_von_Herkomer03.jpg" title="fig:Lord Kelvin by Hubert von Herkomer" alt="Lord Kelvin by Hubert von Herkomer" /> The result of these reforms was a revitalisation of the Scottish university system, which expanded to 6,254 students by the end of the century<a href="#fn73" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref73"><sup>73</sup></a> and produced leading figures in both the arts and sciences. The chair of Engineering at Glasgow became highly distinguished under its second incumbent <a href="William_John_Macquorn_Rankine" title="wikilink">William John Macquorn Rankine</a> (1820&lt;U+2013&gt;72), who held the position from 1859 to 1872 and became the leading figure in <a href="heat_engine" title="wikilink">heat engines</a> and founder president of the <a href="Institution_of_Engineers_and_Shipbuilders_in_Scotland" title="wikilink">Institution of Engineers and Shipbuilders in Scotland</a>.<a href="#fn74" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref74"><sup>74</sup></a> <a href="Thomas_Thomson_(chemist)" title="wikilink">Thomas Thomson</a> (1773&lt;U+2013&gt;1852) was the first Professor of Chemistry at Glasgow and in 1831 founded the Shuttle Street laboratories, perhaps the first of their kind in the world. His students founded practical chemistry at Aberdeen soon after. <a href="William_Thomson,_1st_Baron_Kelvin" title="wikilink">William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin</a> was appointed to the chair of natural philosophy at Glasgow aged only 22. His work included the mathematical analysis of electricity and formulation of the first and second <a href="laws_of_thermodynamics" title="wikilink">laws of thermodynamics</a>. By 1870 Kelvin and Rankine had made Glasgow the leading centre of science and engineering education and investigation in Britain.<a href="#fn75" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref75"><sup>75</sup></a></p>
<p>At Edinburgh, major figures included <a href="David_Brewster" title="wikilink">David Brewster</a> (1781&lt;U+2013&gt;1868), who made contributions to the science of optics and to the development of photography. <a href="Fleeming_Jenkin" title="wikilink">Fleeming Jenkin</a> (1833&lt;U+2013&gt;85) was the first professor of engineering at the university and among wide interests helped develop ocean telegraphs and mechanical drawing.<a href="#fn76" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref76"><sup>76</sup></a> In medicine <a href="Joseph_Lister,_1st_Baron_Lister" title="wikilink">Joseph Lister</a> (1827&lt;U+2013&gt;1912) and his student <a href="William_Macewen" title="wikilink">William Macewen</a> (1848&lt;U+2013&gt;1924), pioneered antiseptic surgery.<a href="#fn77" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref77"><sup>77</sup></a> The University of Edinburgh was also a major supplier of surgeons for the <a href="Royal_Navy" title="wikilink">Royal Navy</a>, and <a href="Robert_Jameson" title="wikilink">Robert Jameson</a> (1774&lt;U+2013&gt;1854), Professor of Natural History at Edinburgh, ensured that a large number of these were surgeon-naturalists, who were vital in the <a href="Humboldtian_science" title="wikilink">Humboldtian</a> and imperial enterprise of investigating nature throughout the world.<a href="#fn78" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref78"><sup>78</sup></a><a href="#fn79" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref79"><sup>79</sup></a> Major figures to emerge from Scottish universities in the science of humanity included the philosopher <a href="Edward_Caird" title="wikilink">Edward Caird</a> (1835&lt;U+2013&gt;1908), the anthropologist <a href="James_George_Frazer" title="wikilink">James George Frazer</a> (1854&lt;U+2013&gt;1941) and the sociologist and urban planner <a href="Patrick_Geddes" title="wikilink">Patrick Geddes</a> (1854&lt;U+2013&gt;1932).<a href="#fn80" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref80"><sup>80</sup></a></p>

<p><img src="University_of_Stirling_from_Wallace_Monument.jpg" title="fig:The purpose-built modern buildings of the University of Stirling" alt="The purpose-built modern buildings of the University of Stirling" /> From 1901 large numbers of students received bursaries from the <a href="Carnegie_Trust_for_the_Universities_of_Scotland" title="wikilink">Carnegie Trust</a>.<a href="#fn81" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref81"><sup>81</sup></a> By 1913 there were 7,776 students in Scottish universities. Of these 1,751 (23 per cent) were women. By the mid-1920s it had risen to a third. It then fell to 25-7 per cent in the 1930s as opportunities in school teaching, virtually the only careers outlet for female graduates in arts and sciences, decreased. No woman was appointed to a Scottish professorship until after 1945.<a href="#fn82" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref82"><sup>82</sup></a> The fall in numbers was most acute among women students, but it was part of a general trend. In the first half of the twentieth century Scottish universities fell behind those in England and Europe in terms of participation and investment. The decline of traditional industries between the wars undermined recruitment to subjects in which Scotland had been traditionally strong, such as science and engineering. English universities increased the numbers of students registered between 1924 and 1927 by 19 per cent, but in Scotland the number of full-time students fell from 10,400 in 1924 to 9,900 in 1937. In the same period, while expenditure in English universities rose by 90 per cent, in Scotland the increase was less than a third of that figure.<a href="#fn83" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref83"><sup>83</sup></a></p>
<p>Before the First World War relationships between male and female students tended to be very formal, but in the inter-war years there was an increase in social activities, such as <a href="dance_hall" title="wikilink">dance halls</a>, cinemas, cafes and public houses. From the 1920s much drunken and high spirited activity was diverted into the annual charity gala or <a href="Rag_(student_society)" title="wikilink">rag</a>. Male centred activities included the Student's Union, Rugby Club and <a href="Officers&#39;_Training_Corps#Scotland" title="wikilink">Officers' Training Corps</a>. Women had their own unions and athletics clubs. Universities remained largely non-residential, although a few women's halls of residence were created, most not owned by the universities.<a href="#fn84" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref84"><sup>84</sup></a></p>
<p><img src="abertaylib.jpg" title="fig:The student library at Abertay University" alt="The student library at Abertay University" /> After the <a href="Robbins_Report" title="wikilink">Robbins Report</a> of 1963 there was a rapid expansion in higher education in Scotland. By the end of the decade the number of Scottish Universities had doubled. The <a href="University_of_Dundee" title="wikilink">University of Dundee</a> was demerged from St. Andrews, <a href="University_of_Strathclyde" title="wikilink">Strathclyde</a> and <a href="Heriot-Watt_University" title="wikilink">Heriot-Watt</a> developing from technical colleges and the <a href="University_of_Stirling" title="wikilink">Stirling</a> was begun as a completely new university on a <a href="greenfield_land" title="wikilink">greenfield</a> site in 1966. From the 1970s the government preferred to expand higher education in the non-university sector of educational and technical colleges, which were cheaper because they undertook little research. By the late 1980s roughly half of students in higher education were in colleges. In 1992, under the <a href="Further_and_Higher_Education_Act_1992" title="wikilink">Further and Higher Education Act 1992</a>, the distinction between universities and colleges was removed.<a href="#fn85" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref85"><sup>85</sup></a> This created new universities at <a href="Abertay_University" title="wikilink">Abertay</a>, <a href="Glasgow_Caledonian_University" title="wikilink">Glasgow Caledonian</a>, <a href="Napier_University" title="wikilink">Napier</a>, <a href="Paisley_University" title="wikilink">Paisley</a> and <a href="Robert_Gordon_University" title="wikilink">Robert Gordon</a>.<a href="#fn86" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref86"><sup>86</sup></a> Despite the expansion the number of male students experienced a downturn in growth from 1971 to 1990. The growth in female student numbers was much larger and continued until, by 1999 and 2000, the numbers of women students exceeded male students for the first time.<a href="#fn87" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref87"><sup>87</sup></a></p>
<p>After devolution, in 1999 the new <a href="Scottish_Executive" title="wikilink">Scottish Executive</a> set up an Education Department and an <a href="Enterprise,_Transport_and_Lifelong_Learning_Department_(Scotland)" title="wikilink">Enterprise, Transport and Lifelong Learning Department</a>, which together took over its functions.<a href="#fn88" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref88"><sup>88</sup></a> One of the major diversions from practice in England, possible because of devolution, was the abolition of <a href="Tuition_fees_in_the_United_Kingdom" title="wikilink">student tuition fees</a> in 1999, instead retaining a system of means-tested student grants.<a href="#fn89" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref89"><sup>89</sup></a> In 2001 the <a href="University_of_the_Highlands_and_Islands" title="wikilink">University of the Highlands and Islands</a> was created by a federation of 13 colleges and research institutions in the Highlands and Islands in 2001 and which gained full university status in 2011.<a href="#fn90" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref90"><sup>90</sup></a> In 2008-09, approximately 231,000 students studied at universities or institutes of higher education in Scotland, of which 56 per cent were female and 44 per cent male.<a href="#fn91" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref91"><sup>91</sup></a></p>
