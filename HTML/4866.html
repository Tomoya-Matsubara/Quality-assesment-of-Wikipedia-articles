<p><strong>Anne</strong> (6 February 1665 &lt;U+2013&gt; 1 August 1714<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>) became <a href="List_of_English_monarchs" title="wikilink">Queen of England</a>, <a href="List_of_Scottish_monarchs" title="wikilink">Scotland</a> and <a href="List_of_Irish_monarchs" title="wikilink">Ireland</a> on 8 March 1702. On 1 May 1707, under the <a href="Acts_of_Union_1707" title="wikilink">Acts of Union</a>, two of her realms, the kingdoms of <a href="Kingdom_of_England" title="wikilink">England</a> and <a href="Kingdom_of_Scotland" title="wikilink">Scotland</a>, united as a single <a href="sovereign_state" title="wikilink">sovereign state</a>, the <a href="Kingdom_of_Great_Britain" title="wikilink">Kingdom of Great Britain</a>. She continued to reign as <a href="List_of_British_monarchs" title="wikilink">Queen of Great Britain</a> and <a href="King_of_Ireland" title="wikilink">Ireland</a> until her death.</p>
<p>Anne was born in the reign of her uncle <a href="Charles_II_of_England" title="wikilink">Charles II</a>, who had no legitimate children. Her father, <a href="James_II_of_England" title="wikilink">James</a>, was first in line to the throne. His <a href="Catholicism" class="uri" title="wikilink">Catholicism</a> was unpopular in England and on Charles's instructions Anne was raised as a <a href="Protestantism" title="wikilink">Protestant</a>. Three years after he succeeded Charles, James was deposed in the &quot;<a href="Glorious_Revolution" title="wikilink">Glorious Revolution</a>&quot; of 1688. Anne's Protestant brother-in-law and cousin <a href="William_III_of_England" title="wikilink">William III</a> became joint monarch with his wife, Anne's elder sister <a href="Mary_II_of_England" title="wikilink">Mary II</a>. Although the sisters had been close, disagreements over Anne's finances, status and choice of acquaintances arose shortly after Mary's accession and they became estranged. William and Mary had no children. After Mary's death in 1694, William continued as sole monarch until he was succeeded by Anne upon his death in 1702.</p>
<p>As queen, Anne favoured moderate <a href="Tories_(British_political_party)" title="wikilink">Tory</a> politicians, who were more likely to share her <a href="Anglicanism" title="wikilink">Anglican</a> religious views than their opponents, the <a href="British_Whig_Party" title="wikilink">Whigs</a>. The Whigs grew more powerful during the course of the <a href="War_of_the_Spanish_Succession" title="wikilink">War of the Spanish Succession</a>, until in 1710 Anne dismissed many of them from office. Her close friendship with <a href="Sarah_Churchill,_Duchess_of_Marlborough" title="wikilink">Sarah Churchill, Duchess of Marlborough</a>, turned sour as the result of political differences.</p>
<p>Anne was plagued by ill-health throughout her life. From her 30s onwards, she grew increasingly lame and corpulent. Despite seventeen pregnancies by her husband, <a href="Prince_George_of_Denmark" title="wikilink">Prince George of Denmark</a>, she died without any surviving children and was the last monarch of the <a href="House_of_Stuart" title="wikilink">House of Stuart</a>. Under the terms of the <a href="Act_of_Settlement_1701" title="wikilink">Act of Settlement 1701</a>, she was succeeded by her <a href="second_cousin" title="wikilink">second cousin</a> <a href="George_I_of_Great_Britain" title="wikilink">George I</a> of the <a href="House_of_Hanover" title="wikilink">House of Hanover</a>, who was a descendant of the Stuarts through his maternal grandmother, <a href="Elizabeth_Stuart,_Queen_of_Bohemia" title="wikilink">Elizabeth</a>, daughter of <a href="James_VI_and_I" title="wikilink">James VI and I</a>.</p>

At her <a href="Anglicanism" title="wikilink">Anglican</a> baptism in the <a href="Chapel_Royal" title="wikilink">Chapel Royal</a> at St James's, her older sister, <a href="Mary_II_of_England" title="wikilink">Mary</a>, was one of her godparents, along with the <a href="Anne_Scott,_1st_Duchess_of_Buccleuch" title="wikilink">Duchess of Monmouth</a> and the <a href="Archbishop_of_Canterbury" title="wikilink">Archbishop of Canterbury</a>, <a href="Gilbert_Sheldon" title="wikilink">Gilbert Sheldon</a>.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> The Duke and Duchess of York had eight children, but Anne and Mary were the only ones to survive into adulthood.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>As a child, Anne suffered from an eye condition, which manifested as excessive watering known as &quot;defluxion&quot;. For medical treatment, she was sent to France, where she lived with her paternal grandmother, <a href="Henrietta_Maria_of_France" title="wikilink">Queen Henrietta Maria</a>, at the Ch&lt;U+00E2&gt;teau de Colombes near Paris.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> Following her grandmother's death in 1669, Anne lived with an aunt, <a href="Princess_Henrietta_of_England" title="wikilink">Henrietta Anne, Duchess of Orl&lt;U+00E9&gt;ans</a>. On the sudden death of her aunt in 1670, Anne returned to England. Her mother died the following year.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p>As was traditional in the royal family, Anne and her sister were brought up separated from their father in their own establishment at <a href="Richmond,_London" title="wikilink">Richmond, London</a>.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> On the instructions of Charles II, they were raised as Protestants.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> Placed in the care of Colonel <a href="Edward_Villiers_(1620&lt;U+2013&gt;1689)" title="wikilink">Edward and Lady Frances Villiers</a>,<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> their education was focused on the teachings of the Anglican church.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> <a href="Henry_Compton_(bishop)" title="wikilink">Henry Compton</a>, <a href="Bishop_of_London" title="wikilink">Bishop of London</a>, was appointed as Anne's <a href="preceptor" class="uri" title="wikilink">preceptor</a>.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<p>Around 1671, Anne first made the acquaintance of <a href="Sarah_Churchill,_Duchess_of_Marlborough" title="wikilink">Sarah Jennings</a>, who later became her close friend and one of her most influential advisors.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> Jennings married <a href="John_Churchill,_1st_Duke_of_Marlborough" title="wikilink">John Churchill</a> (the future Duke of Marlborough) in about 1678. His sister, <a href="Arabella_Churchill_(royal_mistress)" title="wikilink">Arabella Churchill</a>, was the Duke of York's mistress, and he was to be Anne's most important general.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1673, the Duke of York's conversion to <a href="Roman_Catholicism" title="wikilink">Roman Catholicism</a> became public, and he married a Catholic princess, <a href="Mary_of_Modena" title="wikilink">Mary of Modena</a>, who was only six and a half years older than Anne. Charles II had no legitimate children, and so the Duke of York was next in the line of succession, followed by his two surviving daughters from his first marriage, Mary and Anne. Over the next ten years, the new Duchess of York had ten children, but all were either stillborn or died in infancy, leaving Mary and Anne second and third in the line of succession after their father.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> There is every indication that, throughout Anne's early life, she and her stepmother got on well together,<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> and the Duke of York was a conscientious and loving father.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>

Lady Frances Villiers contracted the disease, and died. Anne's aunt <a href="Henrietta_Hyde,_Countess_of_Rochester" title="wikilink">Lady Henrietta Hyde</a> (the wife of <a href="Laurence_Hyde,_1st_Earl_of_Rochester" title="wikilink">Laurence Hyde</a>) was appointed as her new governess.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> A year later, Anne and her stepmother visited Mary in Holland for two weeks.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a></p>
<p>Anne's father and stepmother retired to Brussels in March 1679 in the wake of anti-Catholic hysteria fed by the <a href="Popish_Plot" title="wikilink">Popish Plot</a>, and Anne visited them from the end of August.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> In October, they returned to Britain, the Duke and Duchess to Scotland and Anne to England.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> She joined her father and stepmother at <a href="Holyrood_Palace" title="wikilink">Holyrood Palace</a> in <a href="Edinburgh" class="uri" title="wikilink">Edinburgh</a> from July 1681 until May 1682.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> It was her last journey outside England.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a></p>
<p>Anne's second cousin <a href="George_I_of_Great_Britain" title="wikilink">George of Hanover</a> (her eventual successor) visited London for three months from December 1680, sparking rumours of a potential marriage between them.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> Historian Edward Gregg dismissed the rumours as ungrounded, as her father was essentially exiled from court, and the Hanoverians planned to marry George to his first cousin <a href="Sophia_Dorothea_of_Celle" title="wikilink">Sophia Dorothea of Celle</a> as part of a scheme to unite the Hanoverian inheritance.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> Other rumours claimed she was courted by <a href="John_Sheffield,_1st_Duke_of_Buckingham_and_Normanby" title="wikilink">Lord Mulgrave</a> (later made Duke of Buckingham), although he denied it. Nevertheless, as a result of the gossip, he was temporarily dismissed from court.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a></p>
<p>With George of Hanover out of contention as a potential suitor for Anne, King Charles looked elsewhere for an eligible prince who would be welcomed as a groom by his Protestant subjects but also acceptable to his Catholic ally, <a href="Louis_XIV_of_France" title="wikilink">Louis XIV of France</a>.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> The Danes were Protestant allies of the French, and Louis XIV was keen on an Anglo-Danish alliance to contain the power of the Dutch. A marriage treaty between Anne and <a href="Prince_George_of_Denmark" title="wikilink">Prince George of Denmark</a>, younger brother of <a href="Christian_V_of_Denmark" title="wikilink">King Christian V</a>, was negotiated by Anne's uncle Laurence Hyde, who had been made Earl of Rochester, and the English <a href="Secretary_of_State_for_the_Northern_Department" title="wikilink">Secretary of State for the Northern Department</a>, <a href="Robert_Spencer,_2nd_Earl_of_Sunderland" title="wikilink">Robert Spencer, 2nd Earl of Sunderland</a>.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> Anne's father consented to the marriage eagerly because it diminished the influence of his other son-in-law, William of Orange, who was naturally unhappy at the match.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a></p>
<p>Bishop Compton officiated at the wedding of Anne and George of Denmark on 28 July 1683 in the Chapel Royal.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> Though it was an arranged marriage, they were faithful and devoted partners.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> They were given a set of buildings in the <a href="Palace_of_Whitehall" title="wikilink">Palace of Whitehall</a> known as <a href="Cockpit-in-Court" title="wikilink">the Cockpit</a> as their London residence,<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> and Sarah Churchill was appointed one of Anne's <a href="Lady_of_the_Bedchamber" title="wikilink">ladies of the bedchamber</a>.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> Within months of the marriage, Anne was pregnant, but the baby was stillborn in May. Anne recovered at the <a href="spa_town" title="wikilink">spa town</a> of <a href="Tunbridge_Wells" title="wikilink">Tunbridge Wells</a>,<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> and over the next two years, gave birth to two daughters in quick succession: Mary and Anne Sophia.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="accession-of-james-ii-and-vii">Accession of James II and VII</h2>
<p>When Charles II died in 1685, Anne's father became king as James II in England and Ireland and James VII in Scotland. To the consternation of the English people, James began to give Catholics military and administrative offices, in contravention of the <a href="Test_Act" title="wikilink">Test Acts</a> that were designed to prevent such appointments.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> Anne shared the general concern, and continued to attend Anglican services. As her sister Mary lived in the Netherlands, Anne and her family were the only members of the royal family attending Protestant religious services in England.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> When her father tried to get Anne to baptise her youngest daughter into the Catholic faith, Anne burst into tears.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> &quot;The Church of Rome is wicked and dangerous&quot;, she wrote to her sister, &quot;their ceremonies &lt;U+2013&gt; most of them &lt;U+2013&gt; plain downright idolatry.&quot;<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> Anne became estranged from her father and stepmother as James moved to weaken the Church of England's power.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a></p>
<p>In early 1687, within a matter of days, Anne miscarried, her husband caught smallpox, and their two young daughters died of the same infection. <a href="Rachel_Russell,_Lady_Russell" title="wikilink">Lady Rachel Russell</a> wrote that George and Anne had &quot;taken [the deaths] very heavily ... Sometimes they wept, sometimes they mourned in words; then sat silent, hand in hand; he sick in bed, and she the carefullest nurse to him that can be imagined.&quot;<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> Later that year, she suffered another stillbirth.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> <img src="James_III_and_Mary_of_Modena.JPG" title="fig:Mary of Modena and James Francis Edward, Anne&#39;s stepmother and half-brother" alt="Mary of Modena and James Francis Edward, Anne&#39;s stepmother and half-brother" /> Public alarm at James's Catholicism increased when his wife, Mary of Modena, became pregnant for the first time since James's accession.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> In letters to her sister Mary, Anne raised suspicions that the Queen was faking her pregnancy in an attempt to introduce a false heir. She wrote, &quot;they will stick at nothing, be it never so wicked, if it will promote their interest ... there may be foul play intended.&quot;<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> Anne suffered another miscarriage in April 1688, and left London to recuperate in the spa town of <a href="Bath,_Somerset" title="wikilink">Bath</a>.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a></p>
<p>Anne's stepmother gave birth to a son, <a href="James_Francis_Edward_Stuart" title="wikilink">James Francis Edward</a>, on 10 June 1688, and a Catholic succession became more likely.<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> Anne was still at Bath, so she did not witness the birth, which fed the belief that the child was spurious. Anne may have left the capital deliberately to avoid being present, or because she was genuinely ill,<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a> but it is also possible that James desired the exclusion of all Protestants, including his daughter, from affairs of state.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a><a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a> &quot;I shall never now be satisfied&quot;, Anne wrote to her sister Mary, &quot;whether the child be true or false. It may be it is our brother, but God only knows ... one cannot help having a thousand fears and melancholy thoughts, but whatever changes may happen you shall ever find me firm to my religion and faithfully yours.&quot;<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a></p>
<p>To dispel rumours of a <a href=":wikt:supposititious" title="wikilink">supposititious</a> child, James had 40 witnesses to the birth attend a <a href="Privy_Council_of_the_United_Kingdom" title="wikilink">Privy Council</a> meeting, but Anne claimed she could not attend because she was pregnant herself (which she was not)<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a> and then declined to read the depositions because it was &quot;not necessary&quot;.<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="glorious-revolution">&quot;Glorious Revolution&quot;</h2>
<p><img src="William&amp;MaryEngraving1703.jpg" title="fig:Engraving of William and Mary" alt="Engraving of William and Mary" /> In what became known as the &quot;<a href="Glorious_Revolution" title="wikilink">Glorious Revolution</a>&quot;, Anne's brother-in-law, William of Orange, invaded England on 5 November 1688 in an action that ultimately deposed King James. Forbidden by James to pay Mary a projected visit in the spring of 1687,<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a> Anne corresponded with her and was aware of William's plans to invade.<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a> On the advice of the Churchills,<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a> she refused to side with James after William landed and instead wrote to her brother-in-law on 18 November declaring her approval of his action.<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a> Churchill abandoned the unpopular king on the 24th. Prince George followed suit that night,<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a> and in the evening of the following day James issued orders to place Sarah Churchill under house arrest at St James's Palace.<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a> Anne and Sarah fled from Whitehall by a back staircase, putting themselves under the care of Bishop Compton. They spent one night in his house, and subsequently arrived at <a href="Nottingham" class="uri" title="wikilink">Nottingham</a> on 1 December.<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a> Two weeks later and escorted by a large company, Anne arrived at <a href="Oxford" class="uri" title="wikilink">Oxford</a>, where she met Prince George in triumph.<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a> &quot;God help me!&quot;, lamented James on discovering the desertion of his daughter on 26 November, &quot;Even my children have forsaken me.&quot;<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a> On 19 December, Anne returned to London, where she was at once visited by her brother-in-law William. James fled to France on the 23rd.<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a> Anne showed no concern at the news of her father's flight, and instead merely asked for her usual game of cards. She justified herself by saying that she &quot;was used to play and never loved to do anything that looked like an affected constraint&quot;.<a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a></p>
<p>In January 1689, a <a href="Convention_Parliament_(1689)" title="wikilink">Convention Parliament</a> assembled in England and declared that James had effectively abdicated when he fled, and that the thrones of England and Ireland were therefore vacant. The <a href="Parliament_of_Scotland" title="wikilink">Parliament or Estates of Scotland</a> took similar action, and William and Mary were declared monarchs of all three realms.<a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a> The <a href="Bill_of_Rights_1689" title="wikilink">Bill of Rights 1689</a> and <a href="Claim_of_Right_Act_1689" title="wikilink">Claim of Right Act 1689</a> settled the succession. Anne and her descendants were to be in the line of succession after William and Mary, and they were to be followed by any descendants of William by a future marriage.<a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a> On 24 July 1689, Anne gave birth to a son, <a href="Prince_William,_Duke_of_Gloucester" title="wikilink">Prince William, Duke of Gloucester</a>, who, though ill, survived infancy. As King William and Queen Mary had no children, it looked as though Anne's son would eventually inherit the Crown.<a href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="william-and-mary">William and Mary</h2>
<p>Soon after their accession, William and Mary rewarded John Churchill by granting him the <a href="Earl_of_Marlborough" title="wikilink">Earldom of Marlborough</a> and Prince George was made <a href="Duke_of_Cumberland" title="wikilink">Duke of Cumberland</a>. Anne requested the use of <a href="Richmond_Palace" title="wikilink">Richmond Palace</a> and a parliamentary allowance. William and Mary refused the first, and unsuccessfully opposed the latter, both of which caused tension between the two sisters.<a href="#fn67" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a> Anne's resentment grew worse when William refused to allow Prince George to serve in the military in an active capacity.<a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a> The new king and queen feared that Anne's financial independence would weaken their influence over her and allow her to set up a rival political faction.<a href="#fn69" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref69"><sup>69</sup></a> From around this time,<a href="#fn70" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a> at Anne's request she and Sarah Churchill, Lady Marlborough, began to call each other the pet names Mrs. Morley and Mrs. Freeman respectively, to facilitate a relationship of greater equality between the two when they were alone.<a href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a> In January 1692, suspecting that Marlborough was secretly conspiring with James's followers, the <a href="Jacobitism" title="wikilink">Jacobites</a>, William and Mary dismissed him from all his offices. In a public show of support for the Marlboroughs, Anne took Sarah to a social event at the palace, and refused her sister's request to dismiss Sarah from her household.<a href="#fn72" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref72"><sup>72</sup></a> Lady Marlborough was subsequently removed from the royal household by the <a href="Lord_Chamberlain" title="wikilink">Lord Chamberlain</a>, and Anne angrily left her royal lodgings and took up residence at <a href="Syon_House" title="wikilink">Syon House</a>, the home of the <a href="Charles_Seymour,_6th_Duke_of_Somerset" title="wikilink">Duke of Somerset</a>.<a href="#fn73" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref73"><sup>73</sup></a> Anne was stripped of her guard of honour; courtiers were forbidden to visit her, and civic authorities were instructed to ignore her.<a href="#fn74" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref74"><sup>74</sup></a> In April, Anne gave birth to a son who died within minutes. Mary visited her, but instead of offering comfort took the opportunity to berate Anne once again for her friendship with Sarah. The sisters never saw each other again.<a href="#fn75" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref75"><sup>75</sup></a> Later that year, Anne moved to <a href="Berkeley_House" title="wikilink">Berkeley House</a> in <a href="Piccadilly" class="uri" title="wikilink">Piccadilly</a>, London, where she had a stillborn daughter in March 1693.<a href="#fn76" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref76"><sup>76</sup></a></p>

The Duchess arrived at <a href="Kensington_Palace" title="wikilink">Kensington Palace</a> shortly before George died, and after his death insisted that Anne leave Kensington for St James's Palace against her wishes.<a href="#fn164" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref164"><sup>164</sup></a> Anne resented the Duchess's intrusive actions, which included removing a portrait of George from the Queen's bedchamber and then refusing to return it in the belief that it was natural &quot;to avoid seeing of papers or anything that belonged to one that one loved when they were just dead&quot;.<a href="#fn165" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref165"><sup>165</sup></a></p>
<p>The Whigs used George's death to their own advantage. The leadership of the <a href="Admiralty" class="uri" title="wikilink">Admiralty</a> was unpopular among the Whig leaders, who had blamed Prince George and his deputy <a href="George_Churchill_(Royal_Navy_officer)" title="wikilink">George Churchill</a> (who was Marlborough's brother) for mismanagement of the navy.<a href="#fn166" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref166"><sup>166</sup></a> With Whigs now dominant in Parliament, and Anne distraught at the loss of her husband, they forced her to accept the Junto leaders Lords Somers and Wharton into the cabinet. Anne, however, insisted on carrying out the duties of Lord High Admiral herself, without appointing a member of the government to take George's place. Undeterred, the Junto demanded the appointment of the Earl of Orford, another member of the Junto and one of Prince George's leading critics, as <a href="First_Lord_of_the_Admiralty" title="wikilink">First Lord of the Admiralty</a>. Anne appointed the moderate <a href="Thomas_Herbert,_8th_Earl_of_Pembroke" title="wikilink">Earl of Pembroke</a>, on 29 November 1708. Pressure mounted on Pembroke, Godolphin and the Queen from the dissatisfied Junto Whigs, and Pembroke resigned after less than a year in office. Another month of arguments followed before the Queen finally consented to put Orford in control of the Admiralty as First Lord in November 1709.<a href="#fn167" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref167"><sup>167</sup></a></p>
<p>Sarah continued to berate Anne for her friendship with Abigail, and in October 1709, Anne wrote to the Duke of Marlborough asking that his wife &quot;leave off teasing &amp; tormenting me &amp; behave herself with the decency she ought both to her friend and Queen&quot;.<a href="#fn168" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref168"><sup>168</sup></a> On <a href="Maundy_Thursday" title="wikilink">Maundy Thursday</a> 6 April 1710, Anne and Sarah saw each other for the last time. According to Sarah, the Queen was taciturn and formal, repeating the same phrases&lt;U+2014&gt;&quot;Whatever you have to say you may put in writing&quot; and &quot;You said you desired no answer, and I shall give you none&quot;&lt;U+2014&gt;over and over.<a href="#fn169" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref169"><sup>169</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="war-of-the-spanish-succession">War of the Spanish Succession</h3>
<p>As the expensive War of the Spanish Succession grew unpopular, so did the Whig administration.<a href="#fn170" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref170"><sup>170</sup></a> The <a href="impeachment" class="uri" title="wikilink">impeachment</a> of <a href="Henry_Sacheverell" title="wikilink">Henry Sacheverell</a>, a <a href="High_Church" title="wikilink">High Church</a> Tory Anglican who had preached anti-Whig sermons, led to further public discontent. Anne thought Sacheverell ought to be punished for questioning the &quot;Glorious Revolution&quot;, but that his punishment should only be a mild one to prevent further public commotion.<a href="#fn171" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref171"><sup>171</sup></a> In London, riots broke out in support of Sacheverell, but the only troops available to quell the disturbances were Anne's guards, and Secretary of State Sunderland was reluctant to use them and leave the Queen less protected. Anne declared God would be her guard and ordered Sunderland to redeploy her troops.<a href="#fn172" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref172"><sup>172</sup></a> In line with Anne's views, Sacheverell was convicted, but his sentence&lt;U+2014&gt;suspension of preaching for three years&lt;U+2014&gt;was so light as to render the trial a mockery.<a href="#fn173" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref173"><sup>173</sup></a> <img src="Queen_Anne.jpg" title="fig:Tinted engraving of Anne from an atlas commissioned by Augustus of Saxony, 1706&lt;U+2013&gt;1710" alt="Tinted engraving of Anne from an atlas commissioned by Augustus of Saxony, 1706&lt;U+2013&gt;1710" /> The Queen, increasingly disdainful of the Marlboroughs and her ministry, finally took the opportunity to dismiss Sunderland in June 1710.<a href="#fn174" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref174"><sup>174</sup></a> Godolphin followed in August. The Junto Whigs were removed from office, although Marlborough, for the moment, remained as commander of the army. In their place, she appointed a new ministry, headed by Harley, which began to seek peace with France. Unlike the Whigs, Harley and his ministry were ready to compromise by giving Spain to the Bourbon claimant, Philip of Anjou, in return for commercial concessions.<a href="#fn175" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref175"><sup>175</sup></a> In the <a href="British_general_election,_1710" title="wikilink">parliamentary elections</a> that soon followed his appointment, Harley, aided by government patronage, secured a large Tory majority.<a href="#fn176" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref176"><sup>176</sup></a> In January 1711, Anne forced Sarah to resign her court offices, and Abigail took over as Keeper of the Privy Purse.<a href="#fn177" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref177"><sup>177</sup></a> Harley was stabbed by a disgruntled French refugee, the <a href="Antoine_de_Guiscard" title="wikilink">Marquis de Guiscard</a>, in March, and Anne wept at the thought he would die. He recovered slowly.<a href="#fn178" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref178"><sup>178</sup></a> Godolphin's death from natural causes in September 1712 reduced Anne to tears; she blamed their estrangement on the Marlboroughs.<a href="#fn179" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref179"><sup>179</sup></a></p>
<p>The elder brother of Archduke Charles, <a href="Joseph_I,_Holy_Roman_Emperor" title="wikilink">Emperor Joseph I</a>, died in April 1711 and Charles succeeded him in Austria, Hungary and the <a href="Holy_Roman_Empire" title="wikilink">Holy Roman Empire</a>. To give him also the Spanish throne was no longer in Britain's interests, but the proposed <a href="Peace_of_Utrecht" title="wikilink">Peace of Utrecht</a> submitted to Parliament for ratification did not go as far as the Whigs wanted to curb Bourbon ambitions.<a href="#fn180" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref180"><sup>180</sup></a> In the <a href="House_of_Commons_of_the_United_Kingdom" title="wikilink">House of Commons</a>, the Tory majority was unassailable, but the same was not true in the <a href="House_of_Lords" title="wikilink">House of Lords</a>. The Whigs secured the support of the Earl of Nottingham against the treaty by promising to support <a href="Occasional_Conformity_Act_1711" title="wikilink">his Occasional Conformity bill</a>.<a href="#fn181" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref181"><sup>181</sup></a> Seeing a need for decisive action to erase the anti-peace majority in the House of Lords, and seeing no alternative, Anne reluctantly created twelve new peers.<a href="#fn182" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref182"><sup>182</sup></a> Abigail's husband, <a href="Samuel_Masham,_1st_Baron_Masham" title="wikilink">Samuel Masham</a>, was made a baron, although Anne protested to Harley that she &quot;never had any design to make a great lady of [Abigail], and should lose a useful servant&quot;.<a href="#fn183" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref183"><sup>183</sup></a> Such a mass creation of peers was unprecedented.<a href="#fn184" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref184"><sup>184</sup></a> On the same day, Marlborough was dismissed as commander of the army.<a href="#fn185" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref185"><sup>185</sup></a> The peace treaty was ratified and Britain's military involvement in the War of the Spanish Succession ended.<a href="#fn186" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref186"><sup>186</sup></a></p>
