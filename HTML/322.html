<p><strong>United States Bankruptcy Courts</strong> are legislative courts which were created under Article I of the Constitution. They function as units of the <a href="United_States_district_courts" title="wikilink">district courts</a> and have <a href="subject-matter_jurisdiction" title="wikilink">subject-matter jurisdiction</a> over <a href="Bankruptcy_in_the_United_States" title="wikilink">bankruptcy cases</a>. Because the federal district courts have original and exclusive jurisdiction over all cases arising under the bankruptcy code, (see ), bankruptcy cases cannot be filed in <a href="State_court_(United_States)" title="wikilink">state court</a>. Each of the 94 federal judicial districts handles bankruptcy matters. The current system of bankruptcy courts was created by <a href="United_States_Congress" title="wikilink">United States Congress</a> in 1979.</p>
<p>The bankruptcy judges in each judicial district in regular active service constitute a &quot;unit&quot; of the applicable <a href="United_States_district_court" title="wikilink">United States district court</a> (see ). The bankruptcy judge is appointed for a term of 14 years by the <a href="United_States_court_of_appeals" title="wikilink">United States court of appeals</a> for the circuit in which the applicable district is located (see ).</p>
<p>Technically, the United States district courts have subject matter jurisdiction over bankruptcy matters (see ). However, each such district court may, by order, &quot;refer&quot; bankruptcy matters to the bankruptcy court (see ). As a practical matter, most district courts have a standing &quot;reference&quot; order to that effect, so that all bankruptcy cases in that district are handled, at least initially, by the bankruptcy court. In unusual circumstances, a district court may in a particular case &lt;U+201C&gt;withdraw the reference&lt;U+201D&gt; (i.e., take the case or a particular proceeding within the case away from the bankruptcy court and decide the matter itself) under .</p>
<p>The overwhelming majority of all proceedings in bankruptcy are held before a United States bankruptcy judge, whose decision in all matters is final, subject to <a href="appeal" title="wikilink">appeals</a> to the district court. In some judicial circuits, appeals may be taken to a <a href="Bankruptcy_Appellate_Panel" title="wikilink">Bankruptcy Appellate Panel</a> (&quot;BAP&quot;).</p>
<p>The <a href="Federal_Rules_of_Bankruptcy_Procedure" title="wikilink">Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure</a> (FRBP) govern <a href="Legal_procedure" title="wikilink">procedure</a> in the U.S. bankruptcy courts.</p>
<p>Decisions of the Bankruptcy Courts are not collected and published in an official <a href="Law_report" title="wikilink">reporter</a> produced by the government. Instead, the <em>de facto</em> official source for opinions of the Bankruptcy Courts is <em>West's Bankruptcy Reporter</em>, published privately by <a href="Thomson_West" title="wikilink">Thomson West</a>.</p>
