<p><a href="Wimbledon_F.C." title="wikilink">Wimbledon Football Club</a> was an English professional <a href="Association_football" title="wikilink">football</a> club from <a href="Wimbledon,_London" title="wikilink">Wimbledon</a>, south-west <a href="London" class="uri" title="wikilink">London</a>. Founded in 1889, the club spent most of its history in amateur and semi-professional <a href="non-League_football" title="wikilink">non-League football</a> prior to a &quot;fairytale&quot; rise through the divisions following election to <a href="The_Football_League" title="wikilink">The Football League</a> in 1977. This success resulted in the club looking to move from its home ground, <a href="Plough_Lane" title="wikilink">Plough Lane</a>, and seeking an alternative base.</p>
<p>Relocation to <a href="Milton_Keynes" title="wikilink">Milton Keynes</a>, a <a href="New_towns_in_the_United_Kingdom" title="wikilink">new town</a>  to the north of Wimbledon, was originally considered in the late 1970s, soon after the club's election to the Football League, but not followed up. Various abortive local options were explored during the 1980s, but the 1991 <a href="Taylor_Report" title="wikilink">Taylor Report</a>, which recommended all-seater stadia for all top-flight clubs, led the team to temporarily <a href="groundshare" class="uri" title="wikilink">groundshare</a> with <a href="Crystal_Palace_F.C." title="wikilink">Crystal Palace</a> at <a href="Selhurst_Park" title="wikilink">Selhurst Park</a> whilst an alternative was sought.</p>
<p>Milton Keynes, because of its foundation and designation as a new town in 1967, represented a unique situation in English football in that there was no professional team representing it that had secured the loyalty of local supporters. Wimbledon were not the only team to be approached regarding a move there – a move by Charlton was briefly mooted in 1973 and the subject was regularly broached with <a href="Luton_Town_F.C." title="wikilink">Luton Town</a>, most notably in 1982. In the early 2000s, the Milton Keynes Stadium Consortium, led by <a href="Pete_Winkelman" title="wikilink">Pete Winkelman</a>, proposed a Football League-standard stadium in Milton Keynes, partly funded by an attached retail development. The opportunity to take up this new ground was offered to Luton, Wimbledon, <a href="Barnet_F.C." title="wikilink">Barnet</a>, Crystal Palace and <a href="Queens_Park_Rangers_F.C." title="wikilink">Queens Park Rangers</a>. Despite an initial negative response from Wimbledon, the appointment in 2000 by its owners of a new chairman, Charles Koppel, led to more receptive talks.</p>
<p>The Wimbledon board announced its intention to move the club to Milton Keynes in August 2001; received permission in May 2002; and did so in September 2003. Soon after the relocation's confirmation in May 2002, supporters opposed to the move formed a new team, <a href="AFC_Wimbledon" title="wikilink">AFC Wimbledon</a>. The relocated club renamed itself <a href="Milton_Keynes_Dons_F.C." title="wikilink">Milton Keynes Dons</a> in June 2004 and after a period of time playing at the <a href="National_Hockey_Stadium" title="wikilink">National Hockey Stadium</a>, moved to a new 22,000 seat stadium in the town playing their first game at the new ground in July 2007.</p>

<h3 id="previous-milton-keynes-relocation-proposals">Previous Milton Keynes relocation proposals</h3>

<p>In English football, the relocation of teams away from their traditional districts is extremely unusual because of nature of the relationship between clubs and their local fans: the local football club is regarded by most English football supporters as part of the local identity and social fabric rather than as a business that can be transplanted by its owners at will. As a result, any relocation plan would be strongly opposed by fans in the club's original area, and unlikely to succeed in most new locations due to the existence of established local clubs in most towns and cities that would already have secured the loyalty of local supporters. However, due to its recent establishment in 1967, Milton Keynes provided an exception to this rule; most people living there had been born and raised elsewhere,<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> and no team representing Milton Keynes or any of its constituent towns had yet risen high enough in the <a href="English_football_league_system" title="wikilink">football pyramid</a> to secure their loyalty.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a></p>
