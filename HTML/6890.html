<p>The <strong>Medal of Honor</strong> is the <a href="United_States" title="wikilink">United States of America's</a> highest <a href="Awards_and_decorations_of_the_United_States_military" title="wikilink">military honor</a>, awarded for personal acts of <a href="Courage" title="wikilink">valor</a> above and beyond the call of duty. The medal is awarded by the <a href="President_of_the_United_States" title="wikilink">President of the United States</a> in the name of <a href="United_States_Congress" title="wikilink">Congress</a>. There are three versions of the medal, one for the <a href="United_States_Army" title="wikilink">Army</a>, one for the <a href="United_States_Navy" title="wikilink">Navy</a>, and one for the <a href="United_States_Air_Force" title="wikilink">Air Force</a>. Members of the <a href="United_States_Marine_Corps" title="wikilink">Marine Corps</a> and <a href="United_States_Coast_Guard" title="wikilink">Coast Guard</a> receive the Navy Medal of Honor.</p>
<p>The Medal of Honor is usually presented by the President at the <a href="White_House" title="wikilink">White House</a> in a formal ceremony intended to represent the gratitude of the American people, with posthumous presentations made to the primary next of kin.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a><a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> In 1990, Congress designated March 25 annually as &quot;National Medal of Honor Day&quot;.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> Due to its prestige and status, the Medal of Honor is afforded special protection under U.S. law against any unauthorized adornment, sale or manufacture, which includes any associated ribbon or badge.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>

<li>1782: <a href="Badge_of_Military_Merit" title="wikilink">Badge of Military Merit</a>: The first formal system for rewarding acts of individual gallantry by American soldiers was established by <a href="George_Washington" title="wikilink">George Washington</a> when he issued a field order on August 7, 1782, for a Badge of Military Merit to recognize those members of the <a href="Continental_Army" title="wikilink">Continental Army</a> who performed &quot;any singular meritorious action&quot;. This decoration is America's first combat decoration and was preceded only by the Fidelity Medallion, the Congressional medal for Henry Lee awarded in September 1779 in recognition of his attack on the British at Paulus Hook, the Congressional medal for General Horatio Gates awarded in November 1777 in recognition of his victory over the British at Saratoga, and the Congressional medal for George Washington awarded in March 1776.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a><a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a><a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> Although the Badge of Military Merit fell into disuse after the American Revolutionary War, the concept of a <a href="military_award" title="wikilink">military award</a> for individual gallantry by members of the <a href="U.S._Armed_Forces" title="wikilink">U.S. Armed Forces</a> had been established.</li>

In the fall of 1861, a proposal for a battlefield decoration for <a href="Courage" title="wikilink">valor</a> was memorandumed to <a href="Winfield_Scott" title="wikilink">Winfield Scott</a>, the general-in-chief of the army, by Lt.

Scott however, was strictly against medals being awarded which was the European tradition. After Scott retired in October 1861, the <a href="Secretary_of_the_Navy" title="wikilink">Secretary of the Navy</a>, <a href="Gideon_Welles" title="wikilink">Gideon Welles</a>, adopted the idea of a decoration to recognize and honor distinguished naval service.

<h3 id="historical-versions">Historical versions</h3>
<p>The Medal of Honor has evolved in appearance over time. The upside-down star design of the Navy version's pendant adopted in early 1862 has not changed since its inception. The Army 1862 version followed and was identical to the Navy version except an eagle perched atop cannons was used instead of an anchor to connect the pendant to the suspension ribbon. In 1896, the Army version changed the ribbon's design and colors due to misuse and imitation by nonmilitary organizations.<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a> In 1904, the Army &quot;<a href="George_Lewis_Gillespie,_Jr." title="wikilink">Gillespie</a>&quot; version introduced a smaller redesigned star and the ribbon was changed to the light blue pattern with white stars seen today.<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a> In 1913, the Navy version adopted the same ribbon pattern.</p>

<p>After World War I, the Navy decided to separate the Medal of Honor into two versions, one for combat and one for non-combat. The original upside-down star was designated as the non-combat version and a new pattern of the medal pendant, in cross form, was designed by the <a href="Tiffany_&amp;_Co." title="wikilink">Tiffany Company</a> in 1919. It was to be presented to a sailor or Marine who &quot;in action involving actual conflict with the enemy, distinguish[es] himself conspicuously by gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty&quot;<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a> Despite the &quot;actual conflict&quot; guidelines, the <em>Tiffany Cross</em> was awarded to <a href="Floyd_Bennett" title="wikilink">Floyd Bennett</a> and <a href="Richard_E._Byrd" title="wikilink">Richard E. Byrd</a> for arctic exploration. The <em>Tiffany Cross</em> was not popular. In 1942, the Navy returned to using only the original 1862 inverted 5-point star design, and ceased issuing the award for non-combat action.<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1944, the suspension ribbons for both the Army and Navy version were replaced with the now familiar neck ribbon.<a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a> When the Air Force version was designed in 1956, it incorporated similar elements and design from the Army version. It used a larger star with the Statue of Liberty image in place of Minerva on the medal and changed the connecting device from an eagle to a pair of wings with thunderbolts.<a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a><a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a></p>

<ul>
<li>1800s: Several months after President Abraham Lincoln signed Public Resolution 82 into law on December 21, 1861 for a Navy medal of honor, a similar resolution was passed in July 1862 for an Army version of the medal. Six <a href="Union_Army" title="wikilink">Union Army</a> soldiers who <a href="Great_Locomotive_Chase" title="wikilink">hijacked</a> a <a href="Confederate_States_of_America" title="wikilink">Confederate</a> <a href="locomotive" class="uri" title="wikilink">locomotive</a> named the <em><a href="General" class="uri" title="wikilink">General</a></em> in 1862, were the first <a href="Medal_of_Honor_recipients" title="wikilink">Medal of Honor recipients</a>;<a href="#fn76" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref76"><sup>76</sup></a> <a href="James_J._Andrews" title="wikilink">James J. Andrews</a>, a civilian, led the raid. He was caught and hanged as a Union spy, but was not awarded the medal. Many Medals of Honor awarded in the 19th century were associated with, &quot;saving the flag&quot; (and country), not just for patriotic reasons, but because the <a href="U.S._flag" title="wikilink">U.S. flag</a> was a primary means of battlefield communication at the time. Because no other military decoration was authorized during the Civil War, some seemingly less exceptional and notable actions were recognized by a Medal of Honor during that conflict.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>1900s: Early in the 20th century, the Navy awarded many Medals of Honor for peacetime bravery. For instance, in 1901, <a href="John_Henry_Helms" title="wikilink">John Henry Helms</a> aboard the  was awarded the medal for saving the ship's cook from drowning. Seven sailors aboard the  were awarded the medal after the ship's boiler exploded on January 25, 1904. <a href="Richard_Evelyn_Byrd" title="wikilink">Richard Byrd</a> and <a href="Floyd_Bennett" title="wikilink">Floyd Bennett</a> were awarded the medal after <a href="World_War_I" title="wikilink">World War I</a> for the exploration of the <a href="North_Pole" title="wikilink">North Pole</a>.<a href="#fn77" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref77"><sup>77</sup></a> And, <a href="Thomas_J._Ryan_(admiral)" title="wikilink">Admiral Thomas J. Ryan</a> was awarded the medal for saving a woman from the burning Grand Hotel in <a href="Yokohama" class="uri" title="wikilink">Yokohama</a>, Japan, following the 1923 <a href="Great_Kant&lt;U+014D&gt;_earthquake" title="wikilink">Great Kant&lt;U+014D&gt; earthquake</a>.<a href="#fn78" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref78"><sup>78</sup></a> Between 1919 and 1942, the Navy issued two separate versions of the Medal of Honor, one for acts related to combat and one for non-combat bravery. The criteria for the award tightened during World War I for the Army version of the Medal of Honor, while the Navy version retained a non-combat provision until 1963. In an Act of Congress of July 9, 1918, the War Department version of the medal required that the recipient &quot;distinguish himself conspicuously by gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty,&quot; and also required that the act of valor be performed &quot;in action involving actual conflict with an enemy.&quot;<a href="#fn79" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref79"><sup>79</sup></a> This was in reaction to the results of the Army Medal of Honor Review Board, which struck 911 names from the Medal of Honor Roll in February 1917 for lack of basic prerequisites. These included the members of the 27th Maine erroneously awarded the medal for reenlisting to guard the capital during the Civil War, 29 members of Abraham Lincoln's funeral detail, and six civilians including Buffalo Bill Cody and Mary Walker.<a href="#fn80" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref80"><sup>80</sup></a></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>World War II: Starting in 1942, the Medal would only be awarded for action in combat, although the Navy version of the Medal of Honor technically allowed non-combat awards until 1963.<a href="#fn81" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref81"><sup>81</sup></a> Official accounts vary, but generally, the Medal of Honor for combat was known as the &quot;Tiffany Cross&quot;, after <a href="Tiffany_&amp;_Co." title="wikilink">the company that designed the medal</a>. The Tiffany Cross was first awarded in 1919, but was unpopular partly because of its design.<a href="#fn82" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref82"><sup>82</sup></a> The Tiffany Cross Medal of Honor was awarded twice for non-combat. By a special authorized <a href="Act_of_Congress" title="wikilink">Act of Congress</a>, the medal was presented to Commander (later Rear Admiral) Richard Byrd and Floyd Bennett for their flight over the North Pole in 1926.<a href="#fn83" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref83"><sup>83</sup></a><a href="#fn84" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref84"><sup>84</sup></a> In 1942, the United States Navy reverted back to a single Medal of Honor, although the statute still contained a loophole allowing the award for both &quot;action involving actual conflict with the enemy&quot; or &quot;in the line of his profession.&quot;<a href="#fn85" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref85"><sup>85</sup></a> Arising from these criteria, approximately 60 percent of the medals earned during and after World War II have been awarded posthumously.<a href="#fn86" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref86"><sup>86</sup></a></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Public Law 88-77, July 25, 1963: The requirements for the Medal of Honor were standardized among all the services, requiring that a recipient had &quot;distinguished himself conspicuously by gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty.&quot;<a href="#fn87" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref87"><sup>87</sup></a> Thus, the act removed the loophole allowing non-combat awards to Navy personnel. The act also clarified that the act of valor must occur during one of three circumstances:<a href="#fn88" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref88"><sup>88</sup></a></li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>While engaged in action against an enemy of the United States</li>
<li>While engaged in military operations involving conflict with an opposing foreign force.</li>
<li>While serving with friendly foreign forces engaged in an armed conflict against an opposing armed force in which the United States is not a belligerent party.<a href="#fn89" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref89"><sup>89</sup></a><a href="#fn90" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref90"><sup>90</sup></a></li>

<p>Congress drew the three permutations of combat from President Kennedy's executive order of April 25, 1962, which previously added the same criteria to the Purple Heart. On August 24, Kennedy added similar criteria for the Bronze Star Medal.<a href="#fn91" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref91"><sup>91</sup></a><a href="#fn92" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref92"><sup>92</sup></a> The amendment was necessary because Cold War armed conflicts did not qualify for consideration under previous statutes such as the 1918 Army Medal of Honor Statute that required valor &quot;in action involving actual conflict with an enemy,&quot; since the United States has not formally declared war since World War II as a result of the provisions of the United Nations Charter.<a href="#fn93" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref93"><sup>93</sup></a> According to congressional testimony by the Army's Deputy Chief of Staff for Personnel, the services were seeking authority to award the Medal of Honor and other valor awards retroactive to July 1, 1958, in areas such as Berlin, Lebanon, Quemoy and Matsu Islands, Taiwan Straits, Congo, Laos, Vietnam, and Cuba.<a href="#fn94" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref94"><sup>94</sup></a></p>

<p>While the governing statute for the Army Medal of Honor(), beginning in 1918, explicitly stated that a recipient must be &quot;an officer or enlisted man of the Army,&quot; &quot;distinguish himself conspicuously by gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty,&quot; and perform an act of valor &quot;in action involving actual conflict with an enemy,&quot;<a href="#fn149" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref149"><sup>149</sup></a> exceptions have been made:</p>

Some congressmen objected to Lindbergh's award because it contradicted the 1918 statute, but Representative Snell reportedly quelled this dissent by explaining that &quot;it was and it wasn't the Congressional Medal of Honor which Lindbergh would receive under his bill; that the Lindbergh medal would be entirely distinct from the valor award for war service.&quot;<a href="#fn152" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref152"><sup>152</sup></a></li>

This included the 864 medals awarded to members of the 27th Maine regiment, 29 who served as Abraham Lincoln's funeral guard, six civilians, including Dr. Mary Edwards Walker and <a href="Buffalo_Bill" title="wikilink">Buffalo Bill Cody</a>, and 12 others.<a href="#fn168" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref168"><sup>168</sup></a><a href="#fn169" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref169"><sup>169</sup></a> Dr. Walker's medal was restored by President <a href="Jimmy_Carter" title="wikilink">Jimmy Carter</a> in 1977.<a href="#fn170" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref170"><sup>170</sup></a> Cody and four other civilian scouts who rendered distinguished service in action, and who were therefore considered by the board to have fully earned their medals, had theirs restored in 1989.<a href="#fn171" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref171"><sup>171</sup></a> The report was endorsed by the <a href="Judge_Advocate_General&#39;s_Corps" title="wikilink">Judge Advocate General</a>, who also advised that the War Department should not seek the return of the revoked medals from the recipients identified by the board.

<ul>
<li>A 1993 study commissioned by the U.S. Army investigated racial discrimination in the awarding of medals.<a href="#fn173" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref173"><sup>173</sup></a> At the time, no Medals of Honor had been awarded to American soldiers of <a href="African_descent" title="wikilink">African descent</a> who served in World War II. After an exhaustive review of files, the study recommended that ten of their <a href="Distinguished_Service_Cross_(United_States)" title="wikilink">Distinguished Service Cross</a> recipients be awarded the Medal of Honor. On January 13, 1997, President <a href="Bill_Clinton" title="wikilink">Bill Clinton</a> presented the Medal of Honor to seven of these World War II veterans, six of them posthumously.
