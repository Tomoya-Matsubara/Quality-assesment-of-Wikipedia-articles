<h3 id="clown-without-pity">Clown Without Pity</h3>
<p>The segment opens on Bart's birthday at the Simpson house. Homer suddenly realizes that he forgot to buy Bart a present, so he rushes to the <em>House of Evil</em>, where he purchases a <a href="Krusty" title="wikilink">Krusty the Clown</a> talking doll. The shopkeeper warns him that the doll is cursed but Homer takes little heed. Homer returns to the party and gives Bart the doll. Grandpa starts exclaiming that the doll is evil, but admits that he is just doing it to get attention. Later, Homer is playing with the doll when it starts saying that it is going to kill Homer. He dismisses this until the doll produces a large knife. After numerous attempts on Homer&lt;U+2019&gt;s life, he captures the evil Krusty doll, locks it in a suitcase and drops it in a &quot;Bottomless Pit&quot;. Returning home, Homer goes into the living room but is ambushed by the escaped doll. Marge finally sees the doll choking Homer (none of the family believed Homer before) and calls the &quot;KrustyCo&quot; toy company for help. A repairman arrives and discovers that the doll has been accidentally set to &quot;Evil&quot; mode. He flips the switch back to &quot;Good&quot; and the Krusty doll becomes friends with Homer.</p>
<p>Later, it is shown that Homer has been using the doll as a slave for the remainder of the day. The Krusty doll returns to his girlfriend (a <a href="Malibu_Stacy" title="wikilink">Malibu Stacy</a> doll) with whom he shares Lisa's dollhouse. The scene ends happily as Krusty gives Stacy a kiss on the cheek.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a><a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>

<p><a href="image:Treehouse_of_Horror_IIIb.jpg" title="wikilink">thumb|left|220px|King Homer, having just escaped from the <a href="Broadway_theatre" title="wikilink">Broadway theatre</a>.</a> In a black and white style segment, Marge joins <a href="Montgomery_Burns" title="wikilink">Mr. Burns</a> and <a href="Waylon_Smithers" title="wikilink">Smithers</a> on an expedition to Ape Island to find the legendary King Homer. After landing on the island, Mr. Burns, Smithers, and Marge stealthily approach a native tribe, but are spotted due to Marge&lt;U+2019&gt;s hair protruding over the bushes. The villagers agree that &quot;The blue haired woman would make a good sacrifice&quot; and tie her to a post. The sound of drums summons King Homer (who was busy fighting a giant dinosaur similar to a <a href="T-Rex" class="uri" title="wikilink">T-Rex</a>). Marge is initially terrified but sees the friendly side of Homer when he is attracted to Marge's perfume and the two form a friendship. Nonetheless, Mr. Burns is determined to capture King Homer and Smithers knocks Homer unconscious with a gas bomb. Returning to New York, the group display King Homer at the <a href="Broadway_theatre" title="wikilink">Broadway theatre</a>. The photographers' flashes enrage King Homer, who breaks free from his restraints. He abducts Marge and wreaks havoc, eating several people. He attempts to climb the Springfield State Building, but is unable to get past the second storey of the building. King Homer collapses in exhaustion and Marge helpfully suggests that he eat more vegetables and less people. In the end, King Homer and Marge get married. The story ends with the wedding, and King Homer eating Marge's father (although Marge is not upset).<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a><a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="dial-z-for-zombies">Dial 'Z' For Zombies</h3>
<p>While in the <a href="Springfield_Elementary" title="wikilink">Springfield Elementary</a> <a href="library" class="uri" title="wikilink">library</a> searching for material for a <a href="book_report" title="wikilink">book report</a>, Bart finds a book of <a href="black_magic" title="wikilink">black magic</a> in the library&lt;U+2019&gt;s &lt;U+201C&gt;<a href="Occult" class="uri" title="wikilink">Occult</a> section&lt;U+201D&gt;. That night, when Lisa reminisces about the family&lt;U+2019&gt;s dead cat, Snowball I, Bart suggests that he could use the book he found to resurrect Snowball for her. At the Springfield pet cemetery, Bart utters an incantation from the book but accidentally reanimates corpses from the nearby human cemetery instead. The <a href="zombie" title="wikilink">zombies</a> terrorize Springfield, turning several people, including Principal <a href="Seymour_Skinner" title="wikilink">Skinner</a>, <a href="Ned_Flanders" title="wikilink">Ned Flanders</a> and Krusty the Clown, into zombies. Meanwhile, the Simpson family has barricaded all the doors and windows except for the back door, which Homer forgot to do because he was watching TV. Several zombies break into the house and chase the Simpsons outside. Lisa realizes that the school library must have a book that can reverse the spell. The family runs to the car under the protection of Homer&lt;U+2019&gt;s shotgun. Flanders comes over and asks if he can chew Homer&lt;U+2019&gt;s ear. Homer responds by blasting Flanders with his shotgun. The family voice their shock that he killed the zombie Flanders. Homer then utters the famous line, &lt;U+201C&gt;He was a zombie?&lt;U+201D&gt;</p>
<p>The Simpsons arrive at Springfield Elementary and burst through the doors, Homer leading with his shotgun. Numerous zombies try to attack the family. Some of the zombies are famous people, such as <a href="George_Washington" title="wikilink">George Washington</a>, <a href="Albert_Einstein" title="wikilink">Albert Einstein</a> and <a href="William_Shakespeare" title="wikilink">William Shakespeare</a>. Homer shoots them all and the family reaches the occult section. Bart searches desperately through books while zombies pound on the doors. Bart casts the appropriate counter spell and the zombies return to their graves. The morning after the disaster, <a href="Mayor_Quimby" title="wikilink">Mayor Quimby</a> gives a speech to the town parodying inspirational speeches at the end of disaster movies. Meanwhile, the Simpsons are watching TV and Marge remarks that it was lucky that they weren&lt;U+2019&gt;t turned into zombies. However, while watching TV, the family all talk in slow monotone voices, and Homer talks in a disjointed manner, eerily reminiscent of how zombies talk. The show ends and the credits roll.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a><a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
