<p><strong><em>Minersville School District v. Gobitis</em></strong>, , was a decision by the <a href="Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States" title="wikilink">Supreme Court of the United States</a> involving the religious rights of public school students under the <a href="First_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution" title="wikilink">First Amendment to the United States Constitution</a>. The Court ruled that public schools could compel students—in this case, <a href="Jehovah&#39;s_Witnesses" title="wikilink">Jehovah's Witnesses</a>—to salute the <a href="American_Flag" title="wikilink">American Flag</a> and recite the <a href="Pledge_of_Allegiance" title="wikilink">Pledge of Allegiance</a> despite the students' religious objections to these practices. This decision led to increased persecution of Witnesses in the United States. The Supreme Court overruled this decision a mere three years later, in <em><a href="West_Virginia_State_Board_of_Education_v._Barnette" title="wikilink">West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette</a></em>, 319 U.S. 624 (1943).</p>

<h3 id="compulsory-flag-pledges">Compulsory flag pledges</h3>
<p>Mandatory flag pledges in public schools were motivated by patriotic fervor in wartime America. The first known mandatory flag pledges were instituted in a number of states during the Spanish-American war. During World War I, many more states instituted mandatory flag pledges with only a few dissents recorded by the <a href="ACLU" class="uri" title="wikilink">ACLU</a>. It wasn't until World War II was drawing close that the practice was challenged directly in a way that rose through the court system.</p>
<p>In 1935, the Jehovah's Witnesses pronounced a doctrine that declared saluting the flag to be a form of idolatry. According to their beliefs, the Bible forbids having any false idols before God; and since, in their view, the ceremonial saluting of a national flag is a form of idolatry, a violation of the commandment in Exodus 20:4-6 that &quot;thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, nor bow down to them. . . .&quot; and forbidden as well by John 5:21 and Matthew 22:21.</p>
<p>In 1935 in Lynn, Massachusetts, a third-grader and Jehovah&lt;U+2019&gt;s Witness Carleton Nichols refused to recite the Pledge of Allegiance and was expelled from school. This incident received widespread media attention, and other Witness students soon followed suit. Watchtower Society President <a href="J.F._Rutherford" title="wikilink">J.F. Rutherford</a> gave a radio address praising Nichols, and schools around the country began expelling Witness students and firing Witness teachers. Witnesses hired teachers and set up &lt;U+201C&gt;Kingdom schools&lt;U+201D&gt; to continue their children&lt;U+2019&gt;s education.</p>
<p>Minersville was 90% Roman Catholic and there was significant animosity towards the Jehovah's Witnesses. Tensions were already high before this case arose and many viewed this as one way to get back at the troublesome Witnesses.</p>
<h3 id="gobitas-family">Gobitas family</h3>
<p>Walter Gobitas<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> was a recent convert to the Jehovah's Witnesses. The national leadership had recently decided to make an issue of the forced pledges and asked people to stand up for their right to religious freedom. Those who heeded this call and challenged the practice of pledging the flag were accused of working with or being duped by German sympathizers. Ironically, Jehovah's Witnesses in Germany under Hitler rule were sentenced to concentration camps for the same reason, namely the denial to salute national symbols. A further irony lay in the fact that, at the time, many flag pledges were performed not with the right hand over the heart as they are today, but instead with an outstretched right hand, a gesture which has now become associated with the &quot;Sieg Heil&quot; salute of the Nazis.</p>
<p>Gobitas was inspired by stories of other Jehovah's Witnesses who challenged the system and suffered for it, and decided to make a stand himself and instructed his children not to pledge allegiance when at school.</p>
<h2 id="facts-of-the-case">Facts of the case</h2>
<p>As a result, the children were subjected to teasing, taunting, and attacks from the other kids. For Lillian, this meant giving up her status as class president and losing most of her friends. &quot;When I'd come to school,&quot; she said, &quot;they would throw a hail of pebbles and yell things like, 'Here comes Jehovah!' Billy's fifth grade teacher attempted to physically force his arm out of his pocket to make the requisite salute.</p>
<p>A local Catholic church started a boycott of the family store and its business dropped off. Because of their eventual expulsion, their father had to pay for them to enroll in a private school, resulting in even more economic hardship.</p>
<p>At first the school board was in a quandary because the law did not provide penalties for those who refused to pledge. Finally, though, the school board got permission to punish the Gobitas children and expelled them, without appeal.</p>
<h2 id="prior-history">Prior history</h2>
<p>The case was argued in Philadelphia on 15 February 1938. During the trial, school superintendent Roudabush displayed contempt for the beliefs of the children, stating that he felt they had been &quot;indoctrinated&quot; and that the existence of even a few dissenters would be &quot;demoralizing,&quot; leading to widespread disregard for the flag and American values. Four months later District Judge Albert B. Maris found that the board's requirement that the children salute the flag was an unconstitutional violation of their free exercise of religious beliefs.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>Within two weeks, the school board unanimously agreed to appeal the decision. Oral arguments in the appeal were made before the Third Circuit of the U.S. Court of Appeals on 9 November 1938. One year later, the three-judge court unanimously affirmed the district court decision.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>Despite its two defeats in the lower courts, the school board decided to take its case to the Supreme Court, authorizing its attorney to file file a petition for a writ of certiorari, which the Court granted on 4 March 1940.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="arguments">Arguments</h2>
<p>The Court heard oral arguments on 25 April. <a href="Joseph_Rutherford" title="wikilink">Joseph Rutherford</a>, president of the Watch Tower Society, and himself a lawyer, took over the defense, assisted by the new head of the sect's Legal Department, <a href="Hayden_C._Covington" title="wikilink">Hayden Covington</a>.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> The ACLU and the Committee on the Bill of Rights of the American Bar Association filed amicus curiae briefs.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="decision">Decision</h2>
<p>The Court's decision was nearly unanimous; only Justice Harlan F. Stone dissented. In an 8-to-1 decision, the Court upheld the mandatory flag salute, declining to make itself &quot;the school board for the country.&quot;</p>
<p>Justice <a href="Felix_Frankfurter" title="wikilink">Felix Frankfurter</a> wrote the majority decision;in doing so, he relied primarily on the &quot;secular regulation&quot; rule, which weighs the secular purpose of a concededly nonreligious government regulation against the religious practice it makes illegal or otherwise burdens the exercise of religion. He identified the Pennsylvania flag-salute requirement as an intrinsically secular policy enacted to encourage patriotism among school children.</p>
<p>Frankfurter wrote that the school district's interest in creating national unity was enough to allow them to require students to salute the flag. According to Frankfurter, the nation needed loyalty and the unity of all the people. Since saluting the flag was a primary means of achieving this legitimate goal, an issue of national importance was at stake.</p>
<p>The Court held that the state's interest in &quot;national cohesion&quot; was &quot;inferior to none in the hierarchy of legal values&quot;.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>National unity is the basis of national security. To deny the legislature the right to select appropriate means for its attainment presents a totally different order of problem from that of the propriety of subordinating the possible ugliness of littered streets to the free expression opinion through handbills.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Weighing the circumstances in this case, he argued that the social need for conformity with the requirement was greater than the individual liberty claims of the Jehovah's Witnesses. He emphasized that</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Conscientious scruples have not, in the course of the long struggle for religious toleration, relieved the individual from obedience to a general law not aimed at the promotion or restriction of religious beliefs</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Frankfurter further wrote that the recitation of a pledge advanced the cause of patriotism in the United States. He said the country's foundation as a free society depends upon building sentimental ties.</p>
<p>The flag, the Court found, was an important symbol of national unity and could be a part of legislative initiatives designed &quot;to promote in the minds of children who attend the common schools an attachment to the institutions of their country.&quot;<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="stones-dissent">Stone's dissent</h3>
<p><a href="Harlan_Stone" title="wikilink">Harlan Stone</a>, the lone dissenter from the majority's decision wrote: </p>
<h2 id="effects-of-the-decision">Effects of the decision</h2>
<p>On June 9th, a mob of 2,500 burned the Kingdom Hall in Kennebunkport, Maine.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> On June 16th, Litchfield, Illinois police jailed all of that town's sixty Witnesses, ostensibly protecting them from their neighbors. On June 18th, townspeople in Rawlins, Wyoming brutally beat five Witnesses; on the 22nd, the people of Parco, Wyoming tarred and feathered another.</p>
<p><a href="American_Legion" title="wikilink">American Legion</a> posts harassed Witnesses nationwide. For example, on June 27th, members of the American Legion forced Witnesses from a trailer camp in Jackson, Mississippi and escorted them across state lines to Louisiana, where they were &quot;...passed from county to county, finally winding up in the vicinity of Dallas, Texas.&quot; A Nebraska Witness was castrated. Little Rock Witnesses were beaten with pipes and screwdrivers. West Virginia Witnesses were forced to drink castor oil and then tied together with police department rope. Witnesses were jailed for sedition, jailed for distributing literature, jailed for holding a parade, jailed for canvassing without a license.</p>
<p>The American Civil Liberties Union reported to the Justice Department that nearly 1,500 Witnesses were physically attacked in more than 300 communities nationwide. One Southern sheriff told a reporter why Witnesses were being run out of town: &quot;They're traitors; the Supreme Court says so. Ain't you heard?&quot;</p>
<p>First Lady <a href="Eleanor_Roosevelt" title="wikilink">Eleanor Roosevelt</a> appealed publicly for calm, while newspaper editorials and the American legal community condemned the Gobitas decision as a blow to liberty. Several justices signaled their belief that the case had been &lt;U+201C&gt;wrongly decided.&lt;U+201D&gt;</p>
<h2 id="subsequent-history">Subsequent history</h2>
<p>Partly because of the violent reaction to its decision, the Supreme Court reversed itself a few years later. On 14 June 1943 (Flag Day), the court handed down <em><a href="West_Virginia_State_Board_of_Education_v._Barnette" title="wikilink">West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette</a></em>. Justice <a href="Robert_Jackson" title="wikilink">Robert Jackson</a> wrote, &quot;If there is any fixed star in our constitutional constellation, it is that no official, high or petty, can prescribe what shall be orthodox in politics, nationalism, religion or other matters of opinion&quot;.</p>
<p>Justice <a href="Frank_Murphy" title="wikilink">Frank Murphy</a> considered the reversal to be an important personal landmark.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<p>The active persecution of Jehovah's Witnesses abated somewhat, although thousands were arrested during World War II for seeking religious exemption from military service. They were accused, without any basis, of being Nazi sympathizers.</p>
