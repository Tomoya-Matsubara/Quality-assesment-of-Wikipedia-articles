<p>The station was opened on <a href="10_August" title="wikilink">10 August</a> <a href="1896" class="uri" title="wikilink">1896</a> by the <a href="Glasgow_Central_Railway" title="wikilink">Glasgow Central Railway</a>.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> Also known as <strong>Kirklee for North Kelvinside</strong>, it was closed between <a href="1_January" title="wikilink">1 January</a> <a href="1917" class="uri" title="wikilink">1917</a> and <a href="2_March" title="wikilink">2 March</a> <a href="1919" class="uri" title="wikilink">1919</a> due to <a href="First_World_War" title="wikilink">wartime economy</a>,<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> and closed permanently to passengers on <a href="1_May" title="wikilink">1 May</a> <a href="1939" class="uri" title="wikilink">1939</a>,<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> with the line being closed on <a href="5_October" title="wikilink">5 October</a> <a href="1964" class="uri" title="wikilink">1964</a>.</p>
<p>The station building was designed by famous architect <a href="Sir_J.J._Burnet" title="wikilink">Sir J.J. Burnet</a> who earned his knighthood on the basis of his design for the extension of the <a href="British_Museum" title="wikilink">British Museum</a>.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> The construction of the station was controversial in the 1890s as it destroyed a local beauty spot known as the <i>Peatree Well</i>.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a>. Little is known of the station's use after closure but a photo taken in 1959 appears to show it in use a private house.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> The station buildings were demolished in 1971 having fallen into disrepair.</p>
<p>The bulk of the station site is now occupied by blocks of apartments, however the platforms partially remain in place to the south, beyond the supports for a bridge which has since been removed, and just before a long tunnel leading to <a href="Botanic_Gardens_railway_station" title="wikilink">Botanic Gardens railway station</a>. A telegraph pole dating from the line's operation is still present just before the mouth of the tunnel.</p>
