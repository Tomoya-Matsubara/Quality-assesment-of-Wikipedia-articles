<p>To receive the radioactive wastes from the chemical separations process, the HEW built &quot;tank farms&quot; consisting of 64 single-shell underground waste tanks (241-B, 241-C, 241-T, and 241-U).<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> The project required  of roads,  of railway, and four electrical substations.

<h3 id="plutonium-production">Plutonium production</h3>

<p>The B-Reactor (105-B) at Hanford was the first large-scale plutonium production reactor in the world. It was designed and built by DuPont based on an experimental design by <a href="Enrico_Fermi" title="wikilink">Enrico Fermi</a>, and originally operated at 250 <a href="megawatt" title="wikilink">megawatts</a>. The reactor was <a href="graphite" class="uri" title="wikilink">graphite</a> moderated and water cooled. It consisted of a 28- by 36-foot (8.5- by 11-meter), 1,200-ton graphite cylinder lying on its side, penetrated through its entire length horizontally by 2,004 <a href="aluminum" class="uri" title="wikilink">aluminum</a> tubes.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a>  (181 MT) of uranium slugs the size of rolls of quarters and sealed in aluminum cans went into the tubes. <a href="Cooling_water" title="wikilink">Cooling water</a> was pumped through the aluminum tubes around the uranium slugs at the rate of  per minute.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> <img src="Hanford_B_Reactor.jpg" title="fig:Front face of the B-Reactor" alt="Front face of the B-Reactor" /> Construction on the B-Reactor began in August 1943 and was completed just over a year later, on <a href="September_13" title="wikilink">September 13</a>, <a href="1944" class="uri" title="wikilink">1944</a>. The reactor went <a href="critical_mass" title="wikilink">critical</a> in late September and, after overcoming <a href="nuclear_poison" title="wikilink">nuclear poisoning</a>, produced its first plutonium on <a href="November_6" title="wikilink">November 6</a>, <a href="1944" class="uri" title="wikilink">1944</a>.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> Plutonium was produced in the Hanford reactors when a <a href="Uranium-238" class="uri" title="wikilink">Uranium-238</a> atom in a fuel slug absorbed a <a href="neutron" class="uri" title="wikilink">neutron</a> to form <a href="Uranium-239" class="uri" title="wikilink">Uranium-239</a>. U-239 rapidly undergoes <a href="beta_decay" title="wikilink">beta decay</a> to form <a href="Neptunium-239" class="uri" title="wikilink">Neptunium-239</a>, which rapidly undergoes a second beta decay to form <a href="Plutonium-239" class="uri" title="wikilink">Plutonium-239</a>. The irradiated fuel slugs were transported by rail to three huge remotely operated chemical separation plants called &quot;canyons&quot; that were located about  away. A series of chemical processing steps separated the small amount of plutonium that was produced from the remaining uranium and the fission waste products. This first batch of plutonium was refined in the 221-T plant from <a href="December_26" title="wikilink">December 26</a>, <a href="1944" class="uri" title="wikilink">1944</a>, to <a href="February_2" title="wikilink">February 2</a>, <a href="1945" class="uri" title="wikilink">1945</a>, and delivered to the <a href="Los_Alamos_National_Laboratory" title="wikilink">Los Alamos National Laboratory</a> in <a href="New_Mexico" title="wikilink">New Mexico</a> on <a href="February_5" title="wikilink">February 5</a>, <a href="1945" class="uri" title="wikilink">1945</a>.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a></p>
<p>Two identical reactors, the D-Reactor and the F-reactor, came online in December 1944 and February 1945, respectively. By April 1945, shipments of plutonium were headed to Los Alamos every five days, and Hanford soon provided enough material for the bombs dropped at <a href="Trinity_(nuclear_test)" title="wikilink">Trinity</a> and <a href="Fat_Man" title="wikilink">Nagasaki</a>.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> Throughout this period, the Manhattan Project maintained a top secret classification. Until news arrived of the bomb dropped on <a href="Atomic_bombings_of_Hiroshima_and_Nagasaki" title="wikilink">Hiroshima</a>, fewer than one percent of Hanford's workers knew they were working on a nuclear weapons project.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> General Groves noted in his memoirs that &quot;We made certain that each member of the project thoroughly understood his part in the total effort; that, and nothing more.&quot;<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="technological-innovations">Technological innovations</h3>
<p>In the compressed time frame of the Manhattan Project, Hanford engineers produced many significant technological advances. As no one had ever built an industrial-scale reactor before, scientists were unsure how much heat would be generated by fission during normal operations. Seeking the greatest margin of error, DuPont engineers installed <a href="ammonia" class="uri" title="wikilink">ammonia</a>-based <a href="refrigeration" class="uri" title="wikilink">refrigeration</a> systems with the D and F reactors to further chill the river water before its use as reactor coolant.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a></p>
<p>Another issue the engineers struggled with was how to deal with radioactive contamination. Once the canyons began processing irradiated slugs, the machinery would become so radioactive that it would be unsafe for humans ever to come in contact with it. The engineers therefore had to devise methods to allow for the replacement of any component via remote control. They came up with a modular cell concept, which allowed major components to be removed and replaced by an operator sitting in a heavily shielded overhead crane. This method required early practical application of two technologies that later gained widespread use: <a href="Polytetrafluoroethylene" title="wikilink">Teflon</a>, used as a gasket material, and <a href="closed-circuit_television" title="wikilink">closed-circuit television</a>, used to give the crane operator a better view of the process.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a></p>

<p>In September 1946, the <a href="General_Electric" title="wikilink">General Electric Company</a> assumed management of the Hanford Works under the supervision of the newly created <a href="United_States_Atomic_Energy_Commission" title="wikilink">Atomic Energy Commission</a>. As the Cold War began, the United States faced a new strategic threat in the rise of the <a href="Soviet_atomic_bomb_project" title="wikilink">Soviet nuclear weapons program</a>.

With this announcement, Hanford entered a new phase of expansion.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a></p>
<p>By 1963, the Hanford Site was home to nine nuclear reactors along the Columbia River, five reprocessing plants on the central plateau, and more than 900 support buildings and radiological laboratories around the site.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> Extensive modifications and upgrades were made to the original three World War II reactors, and a total of 177 underground waste tanks were built.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> Hanford was at its peak production from 1956 to 1965.

<p>Most of the reactors were shut down between 1964 and 1971, with an average individual life span of 22 years. The last reactor, the <a href="N-reactor" class="uri" title="wikilink">N-reactor</a>, continued to operate as a dual-purpose reactor, being both a power reactor used to feed the civilian electrical grid via the <a href="Washington_Public_Power_Supply_System" title="wikilink">Washington Public Power Supply System</a> (WPPSS) and a plutonium production reactor for nuclear weapons. The N-Reactor operated until 1987.

<p>The Hanford reactors required a huge volume of water from the Columbia River to dissipate the heat produced by the nuclear reactions. From 1944 to 1971, pump systems drew cooling water from the river and, after treating this water for use by the reactors, returned it to the river. Before being released back into the river, the used water was held in large tanks known as retention basins for up to six hours. Longer-lived <a href="isotope" title="wikilink">isotopes</a> were not affected by this retention, and several <a href="becquerel" title="wikilink">terabecquerels</a> entered the river every day. By 1957, the eight plutonium production reactors at Hanford dumped a daily average of 50,000 <a href="curie" title="wikilink">curies</a> of radioactive material into the Columbia.<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a> These releases were kept secret by the federal government.<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a> Radiation was later measured downstream as far west as the Washington and <a href="Oregon" class="uri" title="wikilink">Oregon</a> coasts.<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a></p>
<p>The plutonium separation process also resulted in the release of radioactive isotopes into the air, which were carried by the wind throughout southeastern Washington and into parts of <a href="Idaho" class="uri" title="wikilink">Idaho</a>, <a href="Montana" class="uri" title="wikilink">Montana</a>, Oregon, and <a href="British_Columbia" title="wikilink">British Columbia</a>.<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a> <a href="Downwinders" class="uri" title="wikilink">Downwinders</a> were exposed to <a href="radionuclides" class="uri" title="wikilink">radionuclides</a>, particularly <a href="iodine-131" class="uri" title="wikilink">iodine-131</a>, with the heaviest releases during the period from 1945 to 1951. These radionuclides filtered into the food chain via contaminated fields where <a href="dairy_cows" title="wikilink">dairy cows</a> grazed; hazardous fallout was ingested by communities who consumed the radioactive food and drank the milk. Most of these airborne releases were a part of Hanford's routine operations, while a few of the larger releases occurred in isolated incidents. In 1949, an intentional release known as the &quot;Green Run&quot; released 8,000 curies of iodine-131 over two days.<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a> Another source of contaminated food came from Columbia River fish, an impact felt disproportionately by <a href="Native_Americans_in_the_United_States" title="wikilink">Native American</a> communities who depended on the river for their customary diets.<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a></p>
<p><img src="Salmon_at_Hanford_Site.jpg" title="fig:Salmon spawning in the Hanford Reach near the H-Reactor" alt="Salmon spawning in the Hanford Reach near the H-Reactor" /> Beginning in the 1960s, scientists with the <a href="United_States_Public_Health_Service" title="wikilink">U.S. Public Health Service</a> published reports about radioactivity released from Hanford, and there were protests from the health departments of Oregon and Washington. By February 1986, mounting citizen pressure forced the Department of Energy to release to the public 19,000 pages of previously unavailable historical documents about Hanford&lt;U+2019&gt;s operations.<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a> The Washington State Department of Health collaborated with the citizen-led Hanford Health Information Network (HHIN) to publicize data about the health effects of Hanford&lt;U+2019&gt;s operations. HHIN reports concluded that residents who lived downwind from Hanford or who used the Columbia River downstream were exposed to elevated doses of radiation that placed them at increased risk for various cancers and other diseases.<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a> A <a href="class_action" title="wikilink">class-action</a> lawsuit brought by two thousand Hanford downwinders against the federal government has been in the court system for many years.<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a> The first six plaintiffs went to trial in 2005, in a <a href="bellwether" class="uri" title="wikilink">bellwether</a> trial to test the legal issues applying to the remaining plaintiffs in the suit.<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a> </p>

The cleanup effort is focused on three outcomes: restoring the Columbia River corridor for other uses, converting the central plateau to long-term waste treatment and storage, and preparing for the future.<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a> The cleanup effort is managed by the Department of Energy under the oversight of the two regulatory agencies. A citizen-led Hanford Advisory Board provides recommendations from community stakeholders, including local and state governments, regional environmental organizations, business interests, and Native American tribes.<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a></p>
<p>While major releases of radioactive material ended with the reactor shutdown in the 1970s, parts of the Hanford site remain heavily contaminated. Many of the most dangerous wastes are contained, but there are concerns about contaminated groundwater headed toward the Columbia River. There are also continued concerns about workers' health and safety.<a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a></p>
<p>The most significant challenge at Hanford is stabilizing the 53 million U.S. gallons (204,000 m&lt;U+00B3&gt;) of high-level radioactive waste stored in 177 underground tanks. About a third of these tanks have leaked waste into the soil and groundwater.<a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a> As of 2008, most of the liquid waste has been transferred to more secure double-shelled tanks; however, 2.8 million US gallons (10,599 m&lt;U+00B3&gt;) of liquid waste, together with 27 million US gallons (102,206 m&lt;U+00B3&gt;) of salt cake and sludge, remains in the single-shelled tanks.<a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a> Nearby aquifers contain an estimated 270 billion US gallons (1 billion m&lt;U+00B3&gt;) of contaminated groundwater as a result of the leaks.<a href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a> As of 2008, 1 million US gallons (3,785 m&lt;U+00B3&gt;) of highly radioactive waste is traveling through the groundwater toward the Columbia River. This waste is expected to reach the river in 12 to 50 years if cleanup does not proceed on schedule.<a href="#fn67" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a> The site also includes 25 million cubic feet (707,921 m&lt;U+00B3&gt;) of solid radioactive waste.<a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a></p>

<p>Under the Tri-Party Agreement, lower-level hazardous wastes are buried in huge lined pits that will be sealed and monitored with sophisticated instruments for many years. Disposal of plutonium and other high-level wastes is a more difficult problem that continues to be a subject of intense debate. As an example, plutonium has a <a href="half-life" class="uri" title="wikilink">half-life</a> of 24,100 years, and a decay of ten half-lives is required before a sample is considered to be safe.<a href="#fn69" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref69"><sup>69</sup></a><a href="#fn70" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a> The Department of Energy is currently building a <a href="vitrification" class="uri" title="wikilink">vitrification</a> plant on the Hanford site. Vitrification is a method designed to combine these dangerous wastes with glass to render them stable. <a href="Bechtel" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bechtel</a>, the San Francisco based construction and engineering firm, has been hired to construct the vitrification plant, which is currently estimated to cost approximately $12 billion. Construction began in 2001. After some delays, the plant is scheduled to be operational in 2019.<a href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a></p>
<p>The federal government currently spends about $2 billion a year on the Hanford project.<a href="#fn72" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref72"><sup>72</sup></a> Cleanup to a nationally accepted level will likely take until at least 2030 and cost at least $50 billion total.<a href="#fn73" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref73"><sup>73</sup></a> About 11,000 workers are on site to consolidate, clean up, and mitigate waste, contaminated buildings, and contaminated soil, though this number fluctuates somewhat based on current cleanup tasks and construction projects.<a href="#fn74" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref74"><sup>74</sup></a></p>
