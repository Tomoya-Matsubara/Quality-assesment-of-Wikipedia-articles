<p><strong>Household Hacker</strong> is a <a href="YouTube" class="uri" title="wikilink">YouTube</a> channel and <a href="website" class="uri" title="wikilink">website</a> that posts videos of various &quot;hacks&quot;, or quick solutions, to common everyday problems. They are known for their high-profile hoaxes, especially &quot;How to Charge an iPod using electrolytes and an onion.&quot; As of July 2009, the channel was the second most subscribed &quot;guru&quot; channel on YouTube, and the 27th most subscribed overall.</p>
<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>The Household Hacker YouTube channel is dedicated to making &quot;videos about everything geek&quot;.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> The videos, which are cross-posted at householdhacker.com, are the work of two anonymous editors known as &quot;Traveler and Frosty Brain&quot; or &quot;Spencer and Dylan&quot; who reside in <a href="San_Jose,_California" title="wikilink">San Jose, California</a> and <a href="Peachtree_City,_Georgia" title="wikilink">Peachtree City, Georgia</a>.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a><a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> Each video features a simple hack, or &quot;a quick and/or clever creation for a method of solving of a problem.&quot;<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> Household Hacker makes money by offering subscription downloads and T-shirts, but the duo told the LATimes that they do not make enough money to &quot;live off comfortably at this point.&quot;<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>Household Hacker was launched in November 2007 and quickly attracted interest, becoming YouTube's most subscribed channel for the month of December 2007.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> By January 2009, Household Hacker was the 22nd most subscribed YouTube channel.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> The channel's popularity began to wane and by July they had fallen to 27th place overall.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> As of July 2009, Household Hacker is the second most subscribed &quot;guru&quot; channel on YouTube.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<p>Their work, more recently, began to shift to a more social level, having long revealed both their full names and faces, with more blogging, discussions on <a href="video_games" title="wikilink">video games</a>, and a more recent &quot;Scientific Tuesdays&quot; segment, rather than the semi-legitimate how-to videos that the duo was known for. This has attracted a new audience, and helped significantly in retaining the old one, marking a revival after a slight decline in their popularity.</p>
<h2 id="ipod-onion">iPod Onion</h2>
<p>In November 2007, Household Hacker released a video entitled &quot;How to Charge an iPod using electrolytes and an onion.&quot; The video, which claimed to demonstrate how one could recharge an <a href="iPod" class="uri" title="wikilink">iPod</a> using little more than <a href="Gatorade" class="uri" title="wikilink">Gatorade</a> and a <a href="white_onion" title="wikilink">white onion</a>, was an overnight success. The video drew the attention of the Unofficial Apple Weblog, which reported it as fact,<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> and hundreds of other blogs. Within its first week, the video had been viewed over 4 million times.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<p><img src="IPod_Onion.JPG" title="fig:The Household Hacker setup for charging an iPod" alt="The Household Hacker setup for charging an iPod" /> By the following November, the video had been viewed more than 7 million times and attracted the attention of <a href="ABCNews.com" class="uri" title="wikilink">ABCNews.com</a>, who asked &quot;Can an Onion Charge an iPod?&quot;<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> ABC put the video to the test, but failed to obtain the promised result. Reporter Emily Friedman remarked &quot;this appears to be an iFraud.&quot;<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<p><a href="MythBusters" class="uri" title="wikilink">MythBusters</a> also put the onion video to the test in 2008. In a segment dubbed <a href="MythBusters_(2008_season)#iOnion" title="wikilink">&quot;iOnion&quot;</a>, <a href="Grant_Imahara" title="wikilink">Grant</a> was unable to get any charge from the onion setup found in the Household Hacker video.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> He explained that the setup lacked the crucial <a href="anode" class="uri" title="wikilink">anode</a> and <a href="cathode" class="uri" title="wikilink">cathode</a> that would be required to get the <a href="electrolyte" title="wikilink">electrolytes</a> found in Gatorade moving and concluded the video was a complete hoax.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> In an interview with ABCNews, <a href="Adam_Savage" title="wikilink">Adam Savage</a> called the video &quot;complete horseshit.&quot;<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="appeal">Appeal</h3>
<p>The iPod onion video fooled a number of normally savvy folks, or at least had them trying the technique out for themselves,<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> which has led to several theories as to why it was so appealing. Farhad Manjoo of <a href="Salon.com" class="uri" title="wikilink">Salon.com</a> speculates that it is the style in which the video was delivered. &quot;He's got a friendly, helpful voice, but he's not casual – he speaks in the formal, confident manner of a TV how-to guy,&quot; says Manjoo.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> Anna Solana of <a href="La_Vanguardia" title="wikilink">La Vanguardia</a>, on the other hand, speculated that it was the &quot;science&quot; itself that attracted the viewers, remarking that something so magical &quot;freaks&quot; people out and makes them want to believe.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="follow-up-videos">Follow up videos</h2>
<p>Following the iPod onion success, Household Hacker has released a number of videos that have generated some attention, but none that have risen to the level of the iPod onion. A March 2008 video entitled &quot;How to Cheat on any Test&quot; has attracted 4 million views and the ire of some school teachers. While a video entitled &quot;How to Create a High-Def speaker for under a buck&quot; again drew the attention of MythBusters. <a href="Tory_Belleci" title="wikilink">Tory</a> followed the instructions in the video, but when it came time to plug in the speakers nothing happened. In addition to disproving the video, he pointed out that the &quot;under a buck&quot; part of the claim was also false, noting that a single <a href="minijack" class="uri" title="wikilink">minijack</a> alone typically costs about $10 retail.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> However, it is possible to get minijack cables for under a dollar online.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> While the focus of the channel has become more social, they have taken humor into the truthfulness of their early videos. In the first &quot;Ask HouseholdHacker&quot; video, when questioned the validity of the speaker video, the camera was panned, revealing a surround-sound stereo system presumably constructed out of paper plates and aluminum foil.</p>
<p>In addition to high profile hoaxes, the Household Hacker channel hosts a number of less provocative videos such as &quot;How to Prank your Roommate on April Fools&quot; and &quot;How to make a secret, disguised safe.&quot;<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a></p>
