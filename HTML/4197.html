<p><strong>Sir Leonard &quot;Len&quot; Hutton</strong> (23 June 1916 &lt;U+2013&gt; 6 September 1990) was an <a href="England_national_cricket_team" title="wikilink">English</a> <a href="Test_cricket" title="wikilink">Test cricketer</a>, who played for <a href="Yorkshire_County_Cricket_Club" title="wikilink">Yorkshire</a> and England before and after the <a href="Second_World_War" title="wikilink">Second World War</a> as an <a href="Batting_order_(cricket)#Opening_batsmen" title="wikilink">opening batsman</a>. He was described by <em><a href="Wisden_Cricketers&#39;_Almanack" title="wikilink">Wisden Cricketers' Almanack</a></em> as one of the greatest batsmen in the history of <a href="cricket" class="uri" title="wikilink">cricket</a>. In 1938, he set a record for the highest individual innings in a Test match in only his sixth Test appearance, scoring 364 <a href="Run_(cricket)" title="wikilink">runs</a> against Australia, a milestone that stood for nearly 20 years. In 1952 he became the first professional cricketer of the 20th century to captain England in Tests; under his captaincy England won <a href="the_Ashes" title="wikilink">the Ashes</a> the following year for the first time in 19 years. In the years immediately following the war, he was the mainstay of England's batting.</p>
<p>Marked out as a potential star from his teenage years, Hutton made his debut for Yorkshire in 1934 and quickly established himself at county level. By 1937, he was playing for England and when the war interrupted his career in 1939, critics regarded him as one of the leading batsmen in the country, and even the world. However, during the war, he received a serious injury to his arm while taking part in a commando training course. His arm never fully recovered, forcing him to alter his batting style. When cricket restarted, Hutton resumed his role as one of England's leading batsmen; by the time of England's <a href="MCC_tour_of_Australia_in_1950&lt;U+2013&gt;51" title="wikilink">tour to Australia in 1950&lt;U+2013&gt;51</a>, the team relied heavily on his batting and did so for the remainder of his career. As a batsman, Hutton was cautious and built his style on a sound defence. Although capable of attacking strokeplay, both Yorkshire and England depended on him greatly for their success, and awareness of this affected his style. Hutton remains statistically among the best batsmen to have played Test cricket.</p>
<p>Hutton captained the England Test team between 1952 and 1955, although his leadership was at times controversial. He pursued a cautious approach and faced criticism for negativity. Never comfortable in the role, Hutton felt that the <a href="Amateur_status_in_first-class_cricket" title="wikilink">former amateur players</a> who administered and governed English cricket did not trust him. In 23 Tests as captain, he won eight Tests and lost four with the others drawn. Worn out by the mental and physical demands of his role, Hutton retired from regular first-class cricket during the 1955 season. He was <a href="Knight_Bachelor" title="wikilink">knighted</a> for his contributions to cricket in 1956. He went on to be a Test selector, a journalist and broadcaster. He also worked as a representative for an engineering firm until retiring from the job in 1984. Hutton remained involved in cricket, and became Yorkshire president in 1990. He died a few months afterwards in September 1990, aged 74.</p>

<p>Following this endorsement, Hutton went to the county's indoor practice shed at <a href="Headingley_Stadium" title="wikilink">Headingley</a> in February 1930.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> <a href="George_Hirst" title="wikilink">George Hirst</a>, a former Yorkshire cricketer responsible for assessing and coaching young players, believed that Hutton's batting technique was essentially already complete.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> <a href="Bill_Bowes" title="wikilink">Bill Bowes</a>, the Yorkshire pace bowler, was equally impressed, and helped Hutton to correct a minor flaw in his technique.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> In 1930, Hutton watched the Australian <a href="Don_Bradman" title="wikilink">Don Bradman</a> hit 334 <a href="not_out" title="wikilink">not out</a> at Headingley in a Test match, then a record individual score in Tests&lt;U+2014&gt;which Hutton himself would surpass eight years later.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> Hutton was sufficiently encouraged to decide to attempt a career in professional cricket, but at the prompting of his parents decided to learn a trade as well.

After joining Yorkshire as a professional, Hutton continued to work for the company during the winter months in the years until the Second World War.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a><a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>

<p>An operation on his nose before the 1935 season delayed Hutton's appearance on the cricket field that year.

<p>Throughout his first seasons, Hutton faced press criticism for his caution and his reluctance to play attacking shots.

<p>Hutton began 1937 very well, with a series of high scores,<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> including an innings of 271 against <a href="Derbyshire_County_Cricket_Club" title="wikilink">Derbyshire</a>, the reigning County Champions, and a partnership of 315 with Sutcliffe against <a href="Leicestershire_County_Cricket_Club" title="wikilink">Leicestershire</a> two days later.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a> He was subsequently chosen for England in the first Test against the touring New Zealand team.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a> On 26 June, he made his Test debut at <a href="Lord&#39;s_Cricket_Ground" title="wikilink">Lord's Cricket Ground</a> and he scored 0 and 1.<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a> However, centuries for Yorkshire in the following games meant he retained his place in the England side for the second Test at <a href="Old_Trafford_Cricket_Ground" title="wikilink">Old Trafford, Manchester</a>.<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a><a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a> Here he scored his maiden Test hundred on 24 July, batting three-and-a-half hours to score exactly 100 runs and sharing a century opening partnership with <a href="Charlie_Barnett_(cricketer)" title="wikilink">Charlie Barnett</a>.<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a> Hutton's remaining two innings in his first Test series yielded 14 and 12, giving him 127 runs at an average of 25.40.<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a><a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a> Also in 1937, Hutton made his first appearance for <a href="Gentlemen_v_Players" title="wikilink">the Players against the Gentlemen</a> at Lord's.<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a> In total that year he scored 2,888 runs, more than double his previous seasonal best, at an average of 56.62 and including ten centuries.<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a> He also recorded the best bowling performance of his career, six wickets for 76 against Leicestershire, altogether taking ten wickets in the match&lt;U+2014&gt;the only time he achieved this.<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a> His performances that year earned him selection as one of <em>Wisden's</em> <a href="Wisden_Cricketers_of_the_Year" title="wikilink">Cricketers of the Year</a>.

<p>Commentators mainly praised Hutton's concentration and stamina; his slow scoring, particularly when compared to Bradman's innings of 334, was excused on the grounds that the Oval match was played without a time limit, and run accumulation was more important than fast scoring.

On the last day of a commando training course in York, Hutton fell in the gymnasium when a mat slipped from under him. He suffered a fractured left forearm and dislocated his <a href="ulna" class="uri" title="wikilink">ulna</a> at the wrist. By the summer, surgery and rest initially looked to have repaired the injury; Hutton returned to his unit and resumed cricket, scoring a century in one game. However, he began to suffer increasing pain and underwent more surgery to graft bone from his legs onto the injured arm. A first operation failed, but the second attempt at the end of 1941 eventually proved successful.<a href="#fn114" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref114"><sup>114</sup></a> Hutton was discharged from the army in the summer of 1942 and after a period of recovery he began work as a civilian for the <a href="Corps_of_Royal_Engineers" title="wikilink">Royal Engineers</a>, inspecting the condition of government-owned properties. However, the surgery left him with a left arm almost two inches shorter than the right.<a href="#fn115" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref115"><sup>115</sup></a> His subsequent recovery and return to cricket was closely followed by the wartime press, which kept track of many pre-war cricketers.<a href="#fn116" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref116"><sup>116</sup></a></p>
<p>Hutton resumed professional cricket with Pudsey St Lawrence in 1943, briefly captaining the team before poor results and a disagreement with the committee led him to resign the captaincy. He played for Pudsey until 1945, batting successfully and helping the team to the Priestley Cup, but his relationship with the club remained strained and he did not play for them again after 1945.<a href="#fn117" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref117"><sup>117</sup></a><a href="#fn118" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref118"><sup>118</sup></a> When the war ended in 1945, a programme of first-class matches was organised, involving counties and other teams.

<p>Hutton's tonsils were removed before the start of the 1947 season but his poor health continued, forcing him to miss some games at the start of the season. Nevertheless, his form remained good and he scored four centuries in early matches.<a href="#fn154" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref154"><sup>154</sup></a> However, Yorkshire dropped to equal seventh in the County Championship, affected by the retirement of key players and the frequent loss of Hutton to representative cricket.<a href="#fn155" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref155"><sup>155</sup></a><a href="#fn156" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref156"><sup>156</sup></a> In the Test matches Hutton did not initially score heavily.

<h2 id="captain-of-england">Captain of England</h2>

<h3 id="appointment">Appointment</h3>
<p>Brown's resignation from the captaincy of England at the end of 1951 left no obvious replacement candidate.<a href="#fn280" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref280"><sup>280</sup></a> Traditionally, captains in county or Test cricket were amateurs, who usually came from privileged backgrounds, in contrast to professionals, who often came from the <a href="working_class" title="wikilink">working classes</a>. Consequently, class distinction pervaded cricket which was organised and administered by former and current amateurs,<a href="#fn281" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref281"><sup>281</sup></a><a href="#fn282" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref282"><sup>282</sup></a> many of whom reasoned that professionals would not make good captains owing to their worries over safeguarding their contracts or concerns about affecting the livelihoods of other professionals.<a href="#fn283" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref283"><sup>283</sup></a> But in 1952, the selectors judged that none of the serving amateur county captains possessed the required ability or experience to fill the role of England captain. Consequently, the selectors decided to radically depart from tradition and appoint a professional captain.<a href="#fn284" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref284"><sup>284</sup></a> All previous England captains in home Test matches had been amateurs, and no professional had captained England in any match in the 20th century. However, as widely anticipated by the press, Hutton was appointed to captain England in the first Test of a four-match series against the 1952 Indian tourists. He harboured private doubts whether the cricket establishment would accept a professional captain, but declined to turn amateur, as Wally Hammond had done in 1938.<a href="#fn285" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref285"><sup>285</sup></a><a href="#fn286" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref286"><sup>286</sup></a> The decision met with broad approval from the press, and the editor of <em>Wisden</em> wrote: &quot;In breaking with tradition and choosing a professional as captain the Selection Committee made a vital decision in the interests of England, because it should mean that in future no man will be picked as leader unless he is worth a place in the side.&quot;<a href="#fn287" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref287"><sup>287</sup></a><a href="#fn288" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref288"><sup>288</sup></a> Hutton had not expected to be asked and had thought an amateur would have been appointed as usual.<a href="#fn289" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref289"><sup>289</sup></a> He presumed his appointment was an interim measure until a more suitable candidate could be appointed.<a href="#fn290" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref290"><sup>290</sup></a></p>

In the fourth innings of the game, Australia needed 177 runs to win, with 115 minutes of play remaining. However, Hutton's negative tactics, including time-wasting and <a href="leg_theory" title="wikilink">leg theory</a> bowling, meant Australia could not score the runs in the available time and the match was drawn.<a href="#fn313" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref313"><sup>313</sup></a><a href="#fn314" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref314"><sup>314</sup></a> The Australian press criticised Hutton for his negativity, but English critics believed the tactics were justified.<a href="#fn315" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref315"><sup>315</sup></a> Amid great public interest for the deciding fifth Test, Hutton lost his fifth successive toss but replying to Australia's first innings of 275, England established a narrow first-innings lead.

Many commentators viewed this as a sign that Hutton's reserve had slipped in the critical situation, but Alan Gibson believes it was a deliberate ploy to inspire Compton.<a href="#fn390" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref390"><sup>390</sup></a> England went on to draw the final Test in a match ruined by rain. Hutton was out to the fourth ball of the match, but Australia were forced to follow on for the first time by England since 1938, and Hutton took a wicket with the last ball of the match before time ran out.<a href="#fn391" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref391"><sup>391</sup></a> This ended the series, which England won 3&lt;U+2013&gt;1.<a href="#fn392" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref392"><sup>392</sup></a></p>
<p>Hutton's tactical approach in the series was praised by Australian and English commentators; they noted how Hutton observed his opponents carefully to spot weaknesses. His caution was criticised, but the main complaint was that he deliberately slowed the speed of play, reducing the number of overs bowled, allowing the fast bowlers to rest and restricting the rate at which Australia scored.<a href="#fn393" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref393"><sup>393</sup></a> With the bat, Hutton scored 220 runs in Tests at an average of 24.44.

The selectors appointed him England captain for the entire forthcoming series against South Africa, a rare indication of confidence.{{#tag:ref|Usually, captains were appointed for one or two matches; the only other captain to be appointed for a whole summer was <a href="C._B._Fry" title="wikilink">C.

He captained MCC against the tourists, but withdrew from the final day of the match with lumbago and his uncertain health led him to resign the England captaincy. The selectors made Peter May captain in his place and appointed Hutton as a selector.<a href="#fn405" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref405"><sup>405</sup></a> Hutton played for Yorkshire until the end of June. Against Nottinghamshire, he scored 194 in five hours, his final first-class century. His last 100 runs came in an hour.

<h3 id="batting">Batting</h3>
<p><em>Wisden</em> viewed Hutton, with <a href="Jack_Hobbs" title="wikilink">Jack Hobbs</a>, as &quot;one of the two most accomplished professional batsmen to have played for his country&quot;,<a href="#fn413" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref413"><sup>413</sup></a> and following the Second World War, critics regarded him as the best batsman in the world.<a href="#fn414" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref414"><sup>414</sup></a> In October 2010, he was chosen as part of the ESPNCricinfo All-time World XI, a team selected by a panel of respected commentators and cricket writers to represent the greatest cricketers of all time.<a href="#fn415" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref415"><sup>415</sup></a> As part of the same process, he was also chosen in England's greatest team.<a href="#fn416" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref416"><sup>416</sup></a> The official Yorkshire history describes him as &quot;technically and aesthetically the best batsman to play for Yorkshire&quot;.<a href="#fn417" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref417"><sup>417</sup></a> E. W. Swanton believed that if Hobbs was the greatest professional batsman, Hutton, along with Hammond and Compton, came next.<a href="#fn418" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref418"><sup>418</sup></a> However, Hutton was more cautious than these others. Following the lead of Herbert Sutcliffe, he saw the role of an opening batsman as defensive. The basis of his game was a good defensive technique, although he was able to accelerate and play attacking shots when the situation demanded.<a href="#fn419" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref419"><sup>419</sup></a><a href="#fn420" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref420"><sup>420</sup></a> Cricket historian <a href="David_Frith" title="wikilink">David Frith</a> believes that &quot;there was an apparent touch of genius about his batsmanship&quot;,<a href="#fn421" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref421"><sup>421</sup></a> and Alan Gibson described Hutton's <a href="Drive_(cricket)" title="wikilink">off drive</a> as &quot;the glory of the game.&quot;<a href="#fn422" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref422"><sup>422</sup></a> He was particularly effective on difficult batting pitches.<a href="#fn423" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref423"><sup>423</sup></a> Of the next generation of England batsmen, Peter May tried to adopt Hutton's mental approach to both batting and captaincy,<a href="#fn424" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref424"><sup>424</sup></a> while Colin Cowdrey later said &quot;I had tried to model myself on Len Hutton ever since I started playing serious cricket.&quot;<a href="#fn425" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref425"><sup>425</sup></a> Statistically, Hutton stands near the highest achievers. When he retired, only two men had scored more than his 6,971 Test runs; his average of 56.67 is seventh highest of those who played at least fifty Test matches, as of 2012, while only Sutcliffe has a higher average among openers who scored over 4,000 runs. He also displayed consistency; his annual average only fell below 50 three times, he averaged over 50 each year from 1947 to 1954 and scored 20 or more in 90 of his 138 innings.<a href="#fn426" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref426"><sup>426</sup></a></p>
<p>Hutton's batting technique was orthodox and conventional. John Woodcock believes that he seemed to possess great intuition, for example playing mystery spinners Ramadhin and Iverson with ease.<a href="#fn427" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref427"><sup>427</sup></a> His batting stance was relaxed and still, his first movement being to slide his right foot back and across towards middle stump. He often played the ball off the <a href="Glossary_of_cricket_terms#B" title="wikilink">back foot</a>, getting right back onto his stumps, but never played as far forward, preferring to let the ball come to him and play it late.<a href="#fn428" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref428"><sup>428</sup></a> Occasionally, he left a slight gap between his bat and pads, meaning he was sometimes bowled through it when out of form.<a href="#fn429" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref429"><sup>429</sup></a> This arose mainly through the wartime injury to his arm and by 1950 he had adjusted his technique to compensate and had fewer problems.<a href="#fn430" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref430"><sup>430</sup></a> Immediately before the war, Hutton batted in a more attacking style and several of his contemporaries remembered his attractive strokeplay. By his own admission, Hutton was not the same player after the war. A combination of the effects of his injury and the responsibility of opening the batting in generally weak Yorkshire and England teams, whose success often depended on Hutton, meant that he batted cautiously.<a href="#fn431" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref431"><sup>431</sup></a><a href="#fn432" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref432"><sup>432</sup></a> Hutton only played attacking shots when they presented no risk, and he rarely lifted the ball in the air; he hit just seven sixes in Test matches.<a href="#fn433" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref433"><sup>433</sup></a><a href="#fn434" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref434"><sup>434</sup></a> However, Patrick Murphy writes: &quot;Just now and again he would play an innings of genius, when bowlers could not contain him.&quot;<a href="#fn435" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref435"><sup>435</sup></a> One such innings was his score of 37 in the second Test of 1946–47 in which the attacking shots he played reminded older spectators of <a href="Victor_Trumper" title="wikilink">Victor Trumper</a>, regarded as the ultimate Australian strokeplayer.<a href="#fn436" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref436"><sup>436</sup></a> In all his innings, he was expert at hitting the ball just out of the reach of fieldsmen to allow runs to be taken.<a href="#fn437" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref437"><sup>437</sup></a> Several of his contemporaries believed he did not get enough credit for surviving the short-pitched attacks of the Australian bowlers following the war.<a href="#fn438" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref438"><sup>438</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="captaincy">Captaincy</h3>
<p>As captain, Hutton believed that the key to success was a strong pace attack, stemming from his experiences against Lindwall and Miller, which influenced his selection of several promising fast bowlers. His natural inclination and the background to his appointment made him a cautious captain, for example slowing down of the game to rest his fast bowlers which set a precedent for other captains.<a href="#fn439" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref439"><sup>439</sup></a> A poor communicator, Hutton distanced himself from his team when they needed a stronger lead.<a href="#fn440" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref440"><sup>440</sup></a> Tactically, Norman Yardley found him &quot;sound rather than venturesome&quot;.<a href="#fn441" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref441"><sup>441</sup></a> Run saving was his main priority, but he quickly adjusted his approach to attack the weakness of a particular batsmen.<a href="#fn442" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref442"><sup>442</sup></a> Jim Kilburn believed that Hutton pursued a serious approach to all matches, to the point where he missed some enjoyment of the game. Kilburn wrote that the &quot;outstanding characteristic of his captaincy was shrewdness. He made no romantic gestures; he lit no fires of inspiration. He invited admiration rather than affection and would have exchanged either or both for effective obedience.&quot;<a href="#fn443" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref443"><sup>443</sup></a></p>
<p>Some of his selections as captain were widely debated. Following incidents in the Caribbean, Trueman did not play for England again under Hutton's captaincy, although he was still regarded as an England prospect. Jim Laker was also omitted from the team, possibly because Hutton doubted Laker's commitment.<a href="#fn444" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref444"><sup>444</sup></a> Both <a href="Jim_McConnon" title="wikilink">Jim McConnon</a>, Laker's replacement, and <a href="Vic_Wilson_(cricketer)" title="wikilink">Vic Wilson</a> were controversial selections in Australia for the 1954–55 tour which <a href="Trevor_Bailey" title="wikilink">Trevor Bailey</a> attributed to Hutton;<a href="#fn445" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref445"><sup>445</sup></a> neither played a substantial role on the tour.<a href="#fn446" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref446"><sup>446</sup></a> Trueman and Trevor Bailey also considered Hutton a poor communicator with his players: amateur critics considered this an inevitable consequence of a professional leading other professionals.<a href="#fn447" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref447"><sup>447</sup></a> On the other hand, Hutton played a key role in the development of fast bowlers Trueman, Tyson and <a href="Brian_Statham" title="wikilink">Brian Statham</a>. Tyson and Statham later acknowledged his advice and encouragement as factor in their subsequent success.<a href="#fn448" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref448"><sup>448</sup></a> Cowdrey also acknowledged Hutton's advice and assistance when the former began his career. Furthermore, on the 1954–55 tour of Australia, Hutton took a close interest in him and was a particular comfort when Cowdrey's father died during the tour.<a href="#fn449" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref449"><sup>449</sup></a></p>
<p>Cricket followers from the south of England remained slightly distrustful of Hutton owing to the perception that he occasionally carried professionalism to excess.<a href="#fn450" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref450"><sup>450</sup></a> When he was appointed England captain, many in the cricketing establishment held his professionalism against him with the result that Hutton never felt comfortable dealing with the amateurs who ran English cricket at the time. While captain, he was criticised for caution and negativity but also was expected to lead a successful team at a time when results began to assume a far greater importance than in previous years.<a href="#fn451" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref451"><sup>451</sup></a> Consequently, Hutton never felt secure in the position and was often uncomfortable around the amateur establishment. Like Herbert Sutcliffe, he attempted to alter his accent to match that of leading southern amateurs to help him to fit in.<a href="#fn452" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref452"><sup>452</sup></a> But he did not enjoy the attention that went with the captaincy,<a href="#fn453" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref453"><sup>453</sup></a> and he often worried about the impression he was making.<a href="#fn454" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref454"><sup>454</sup></a></p>
<p>Hutton rarely captained Yorkshire, except in the absence of the official captain, through a combination of poor health, frequent absences with England and the presence of amateur Norman Yardley in the side.<a href="#fn455" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref455"><sup>455</sup></a> Yardley claimed several times that he would have stood down in Hutton's favour, but the committee remained distrustful of professional captaincy and thought Hutton a hypochondriac who used his health as an excuse not to play.<a href="#fn456" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref456"><sup>456</sup></a> A reserved, serious man who nevertheless possessed a quiet sense of humour,<a href="#fn457" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref457"><sup>457</sup></a><a href="#fn458" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref458"><sup>458</sup></a> the dressing room clashes of the Yorkshire side of the 1950s did not appeal to Hutton,<a href="#fn459" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref459"><sup>459</sup></a> and, as the side's senior professional, he did not always provide the guidance which younger players in the side were seeking.<a href="#fn460" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref460"><sup>460</sup></a> The team was divided and the players frequently clashed with each other; some critics believe this was a factor in the county's failure to win the County Championship in the 1950s. <a href="Ray_Illingworth" title="wikilink">Ray Illingworth</a>, a player at the time, believes that Hutton was the only man who could have changed the negative attitude around the team, but &quot;he didn't do anything about it&quot;.<a href="#fn461" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref461"><sup>461</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="personal-life">Personal life</h2>
<p>Hutton married Dorothy Mary Dennis, the sister of former Yorkshire cricketer <a href="Frank_Dennis" title="wikilink">Frank Dennis</a>, on 16 September 1939 at <a href="Wykeham,_Scarborough" title="wikilink">Wykeham near Scarborough</a>; they met at an end-of-season dance which Dorothy had attended with her brother.<a href="#fn462" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref462"><sup>462</sup></a> They had two sons: <a href="Richard_Hutton_(cricketer)" title="wikilink">Richard</a>, who later played cricket for Yorkshire and England, in 1942,<a href="#fn463" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref463"><sup>463</sup></a> and John in 1947.<a href="#fn464" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref464"><sup>464</sup></a></p>
<p>During and after the war, Hutton worked for a paper manufacturer,<a href="#fn465" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref465"><sup>465</sup></a> but writing and journalism provided a more permanent career. Hutton worked with <a href="Thomas_Moult" title="wikilink">Thomas Moult</a>, a journalist and writer, to produce a book of memoirs, <em>Cricket is My Life</em> in 1949,<a href="#fn466" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref466"><sup>466</sup></a> and he wrote for the <em><a href="News_of_the_World" title="wikilink">News of the World</a></em> while still playing.<a href="#fn467" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref467"><sup>467</sup></a> Following his cricketing retirement, Hutton worked in broadcasting until 1961,<a href="#fn468" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref468"><sup>468</sup></a> and after 1955, he wrote for the London <a href="The_Evening_News_(London_newspaper)" title="wikilink"><em>Evening News</em></a> until 1963.<a href="#fn469" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref469"><sup>469</sup></a> A second book, <em>Just my story</em>, followed in 1956 in collaboration with journalist, R. J. Hayter. In 1958&lt;U+2013&gt;59, Hutton travelled to Australia to cover the M.C.C. tour as correspondent for the <em>Evening News</em>, again assisted by a professional journalist, while between 1963 and 1986, he wrote for <em><a href="The_Observer" title="wikilink">The Observer</a></em>.<a href="#fn470" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref470"><sup>470</sup></a> He wrote a third book, <em>Thirty Years in Cricket</em>, in 1984.<a href="#fn471" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref471"><sup>471</sup></a> Hutton's increasing commitments in the south of England meant he moved to North London in 1959.<a href="#fn472" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref472"><sup>472</sup></a> In 1960, Hutton was invited to join the engineering firm of J. H. Fenner,<a href="#fn473" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref473"><sup>473</sup></a> mainly working in a <a href="public_relations" title="wikilink">public relations</a> capacity. Later, he moved into marketing and overseas promotion of products,<a href="#fn474" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref474"><sup>474</sup></a> became a director of the firm in 1973,<a href="#fn475" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref475"><sup>475</sup></a> and retired in 1984.<a href="#fn476" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref476"><sup>476</sup></a></p>
<p>Although he disliked committees, he served as an England Test selector in 1975 and 1976, but business commitments limited his availability and for this reason he resigned in 1977.<a href="#fn477" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref477"><sup>477</sup></a> Hutton became involved with Surrey cricket in later years but maintained links with Yorkshire, and assumed the position of Yorkshire president in January 1990.<a href="#fn478" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref478"><sup>478</sup></a> In his final years, Hutton suffered from ill health and became increasingly frail. In September 1990, he suffered a <a href="Traumatic_aortic_rupture" title="wikilink">ruptured aorta</a> shortly after watching a cricket match at the Oval. After an unsuccessful operation, he died on 6 September.<a href="#fn479" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref479"><sup>479</sup></a><a href="#fn480" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref480"><sup>480</sup></a></p>
