As a junior officer he came to prominence due to his brave conduct during a fire on the first-rate <a href="HMS_Queen_Charlotte_(1790)" title="wikilink">HMS <em>Queen Charlotte</em></a>. As a result of this he was appointed to the command of the sixth-rate <a href="HMS_Calpe_(1800)" title="wikilink">HMS <em>Calpe</em></a> in which he took part in the <a href="Algeciras_Campaign" title="wikilink">Battle of Algeciras Bay</a> in July 1801 during the <a href="French_Revolutionary_Wars" title="wikilink">French Revolutionary Wars</a>.

<p>Born the fifth son of <a href="Thomas_Dundas,_1st_Baron_Dundas" title="wikilink">Thomas Dundas</a> (created <a href="Marquess_of_Zetland" title="wikilink">Baron Dundas</a> in 1794) by his wife Charlotte Dundas (daughter of <a href="William_Fitzwilliam,_3rd_Earl_Fitzwilliam" title="wikilink">William Fitzwilliam, 3rd Earl Fitzwilliam</a>),<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> Dundas became a <a href="lieutenant" class="uri" title="wikilink">lieutenant</a> in the <a href="Royal_Navy" title="wikilink">Royal Navy</a> in 1797 and served for several years with the <a href="Mediterranean_Fleet" title="wikilink">Mediterranean Fleet</a>.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="hms-queen-charlotte">HMS <em>Queen Charlotte</em></h3>
<p>In February 1800 Dundas was aboard <a href="George_Elphinstone,_1st_Viscount_Keith" title="wikilink">Lord Keith</a>'s flagship, the first-rate <a href="HMS_Queen_Charlotte_(1790)" title="wikilink">HMS <em>Queen Charlotte</em></a>. Dundas was junior to Lieutenant <a href="Thomas_Cochrane,_10th_Earl_of_Dundonald" title="wikilink">Lord Cochrane</a> but Cochrane had taken command of <a href="Horatio_Nelson,_1st_Viscount_Nelson" title="wikilink">Nelson</a>'s prize, the <em>Genereaux</em>, in late 1799 to take her into port; Dundas therefore became 5th Lieutenant of the <em>Queen Charlotte</em>. One month later, early in the morning of 17 March 1800, cries of &quot;Fire&quot; rang out throughout the vessel. Some hay lying under the half-deck had been set on fire by a match kept there for the signal guns. Dundas was in the forecastle where he organized fire-fighting efforts. Dundas led a party below decks where they secured the main and fore hatches and then opened the lower-deck ports and the sea cocks to flood the lower decks to prevent the fire spreading down. These efforts delayed the fire from reaching the two <a href="Magazine_(artillery)" title="wikilink">magazines</a>. Dundas continued working below decks until some middle-deck guns fell through the deck. At about 9am Dundas climbed out the foremost lower-deck port and climbed up to the forecastle, joining the about 150 men there who were throwing water on the fire.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> Despite the crew's exertions, the <em>Queen Charlotte</em> eventually blew up with the loss of 673 people out of its complement of 840 officers, men and boys, including the Captain and her first Lieutenant. Dundas however survived.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="hms-calpe">HMS <em>Calpe</em></h3>
<p>Following his performance during the fire on HMS <em>Queen Charlotte</em> Dundas was appointed to the command of the sixth-rate <a href="HMS_Calpe_(1800)" title="wikilink">HMS <em>Calpe</em></a>.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> On the night of 27 October 1800, <a href="Francis_Beaufort" title="wikilink">Francis Beaufort</a>, inventor of the <a href="Beaufort_scale" title="wikilink">Beaufort Wind-Scale</a>, had led <a href="HMS_Phaeton_(1782)" title="wikilink"><em>Phaeton</em></a>'s boats on a cutting out expedition. They captured the <em>San Jos&lt;U+00E9&gt;</em>, alias <em>Aglies</em>, of 14 guns, which they immediately re-commissioned under the name of HMS <em>Calpe</em>, the ancient name of Gibraltar. Although it would have been usual to promote Beaufort, the successful and heroic leader of the expedition, to command <em>Calpe</em>, <a href="George_Elphinstone,_1st_Viscount_Keith" title="wikilink">Lord Keith</a> chose instead to promote Dundas who not only was not present at the battle, but was junior to Beaufort.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> Dundas was promoted to <a href="commander" class="uri" title="wikilink">commander</a> in December 1800.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a><a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p>In July 1801 Dundas was in command of <em>Calpe</em> at the <a href="Algeciras_Campaign" title="wikilink">Battle of Algeciras Bay</a>. After the third-rate <a href="HMS_Hannibal_(1786)" title="wikilink">HMS <em>Hannibal</em></a> grounded, Dundas, deceived by a signal from her, sent his boats to save <em>Hannibal</em>{{'}}s crew. The French detained the boats and their crews, including <em>Calpe</em>{{'}}s lieutenant, Thomas Sykes; after firing several broadsides at the enemy's shipping and batteries, Dundas and <em>Calpe</em> returned to Gibraltar.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> In the subsequent second phase of the Battle of Algeciras Bay, the two Spanish first-rates <a href="Spanish_ship_Real_Carlos" title="wikilink"><em>Real Carlos</em></a> and <a href="Spanish_ship_Hermenegildo" title="wikilink"><em>Hermenegildo</em></a> fired upon each other during the night, caught fire and exploded, with tremendous loss of life. The British captured the third-rate <a href="French_ship_St_Antoine" title="wikilink"><em>St Antoine</em></a>, with <a href="HMS_Superb_(1798)" title="wikilink"><em>Superb</em></a> and <em>Calpe</em> then assisting in securing the prize and removing the prisoners.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> Rear Admiral <a href="James_Saumarez,_1st_Baron_de_Saumarez" title="wikilink">James Saumarez</a> promoted Dundas to <a href="post-captain" class="uri" title="wikilink">post-captain</a> on 9 August 1801<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a><a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> and Dundas took command of <em>St Antoine</em>, which he sailed back to England.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="politics">Politics</h3>
<p>After the <a href="Treaty_of_Amiens" title="wikilink">peace of 1802</a>, Dundas entered politics becoming <a href="Whig_(British_political_party)" title="wikilink">Whig</a> <a href="Member_of_Parliament" title="wikilink">Member of Parliament</a> for <a href="Richmond_(Yorks)_(UK_Parliament_constituency)" title="wikilink">Richmond</a> in the <a href="United_Kingdom_general_election,_1802" title="wikilink">1802 general election</a><a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> but resigned in February 1806, using the device of applying to be <a href="List_of_Stewards_of_the_Manor_of_East_Hendred" title="wikilink">Steward of the Manor of East Hendred</a>, to take up an offer of a naval command again and to allow his brother, Charles, to enter Parliament.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> In February 1805 he was given command of the fifth-rate <a href="HMS_Quebec_(1781)" title="wikilink">HMS <em>Quebec</em></a>.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="hms-euryalus">HMS <em>Euryalus</em></h3>
<p>In January 1806 Dundas took command of fifth-rate <a href="Apollo_class_frigate" title="wikilink">Apollo class frigate</a> <a href="HMS_Euryalus_(1803)" title="wikilink">HMS <em>Euryalus</em></a>.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> Euryalus was asked, along with <a href="HMS_Ocean" title="wikilink">HMS <em>Ocean</em></a> and several other warships to act as escorts to a large convoy bound for Oporto, Lisbon and the Mediterranean. Towards the end of 1807 <em>Euryalus</em> returned to England with <a href="HMS_Niger_(1759)" title="wikilink"><em>Niger</em></a> as escort to a convoy of several thousand troops under <a href="Sir_John_Moore,_1st_Baronet" title="wikilink">Sir John Moore</a> from Gibraltar. She went into dock at Plymouth for a refit and was then stationed in the North Sea.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> She carried the <a href="Charles_X_of_France" title="wikilink">Duke d'Angoul&lt;U+00EA&gt;me</a> from Yarmouth to Gottenburg and escorted the Baltic convoys through the <a href="Great_Belt" title="wikilink">Great Belt</a>.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a></p>
<p>In June 1808 Dundas discovered several vessels at anchor at the entrance of <a href="Nakskov" class="uri" title="wikilink">Nakskov</a> close into the shore. He anchored and sent four boats to destroy them. They burnt two large troop transports and captured a gun-vessel armed with two 18-pounders and carrying 64 men. The enemy lost seven men killed and twelve wounded, as well as many drowned; the British had one man slightly wounded.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> During the same year Dundas went to <a href="Elbl&lt;U+0105&gt;g" title="wikilink">Elbing</a>, a small port in West Prussia about 60 kilometers east of <a href="Gdansk" title="wikilink">Dantzig</a> (now in Poland) to embark <a href="Princess_Marie_Josephine_Louise_of_Savoy" title="wikilink">Princess Marie Josephine Louise of Savoy</a> (the consort of <a href="Louis_XVIII_of_France" title="wikilink">Louis XVIII</a>), the Duc du Berry and other members of the French royal family. He took them to <a href="Karlskrona" title="wikilink">Carlscrona</a> in southern Sweden and, after re-embarking them at <a href="Gottenburg" class="uri" title="wikilink">Gottenburg</a>, finally to Harwich.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a></p>
<p>Dundas was also involved in the <a href="Walcheren_Campaign" title="wikilink">Walcheren Campaign</a> in July 1809 when a British armed force of 39,000 men landed on <a href="Walcheren" class="uri" title="wikilink">Walcheren</a>. <em>Euryalus</em> joined the squadron which forced the passage of the <a href="Scheldt" class="uri" title="wikilink">Scheldt</a> between the batteries at Flushing and Cadsand on 11 August 1809. <em>Euryalus</em> had no casualties although two men were killed and nine wounded in the other ships.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> Later she was stationed off <a href="Cherbourg" class="uri" title="wikilink">Cherbourg</a> under the orders of Captain <a href="Sir_Richard_King,_2nd_Baronet" title="wikilink">Sir Richard King</a>, and in November 1809 she captured the French privateer lugger <em>Etoile</em> of 14 guns and 48 men.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> In the spring of 1810 <em>Euryalus</em> escorted a large convoy from Spithead to Portugal and the Mediterranean and was then attached to Captain Blackwood's inshore squadron off Toulon.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a></p>
<p>Early in 1811 Dundas temporarily took command of the 74-gun <a href="Third-rate" title="wikilink">Third Rate</a> <a href="HMS_Achille_(1798)" title="wikilink"><em>Achille</em></a> until relieved by Captain <a href="Aiskew_Hollis" title="wikilink">Aiskew Paffard Hollis</a>, who had transferred from <a href="HMS_Standard_(1782)" title="wikilink"><em>Standard</em></a>. Dundas then returned to <em>Euryalus</em>. On 7 June 1811 the boats of <em>Euryalus</em> and <a href="HMS_Swallow_(1805)" title="wikilink"><em>Swallow</em></a> captured the French privateer <em>Intrepide</em> off Corsica after a long chase. She had a crew of 58 and was armed with two 8-pounders.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a></p>
<p>Dundas became Member of Parliament for Richmond again at a by-election in 1812 but was defeated at the <a href="United_Kingdom_general_election,_1812" title="wikilink">1812 general election</a>.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a></p>

In 1813 Dundas and <em>Edinburgh</em> were in the Mediterranean. On the morning of 5 October, <em>Edinburgh</em> joined Capt.

During the attack in the afternoon, <em>Edinburgh</em> supported <em>Eclair</em> and <em>Pylades</em> as they bore up against the battery to the south. After the ships opened fire, landing parties brought out the 29 vessels of the convoy, 20 of which were laden with wood for the arsenal at Toulon. All the works were blown up.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a></p>
<p>On 30 November 1812 Dundas was placed in command of a small squadron consisting of <em>Edinburgh</em>, <a href="HMS_Furieuse_(1809)" title="wikilink"><em>Furieuse</em></a> and <a href="HMS_Termagant_(1796)" title="wikilink"><em>Termagant</em></a> which landed troops at <a href="Viareggio" class="uri" title="wikilink">Viareggio</a> in <a href="Italy" class="uri" title="wikilink">Italy</a>. Some 600 cavalry and infantry from the <a href="Livorno" class="uri" title="wikilink">Livorno</a> garrison attacked the troops, who routed them, capturing two field pieces and a howitzer. From the prisoners they learned of the weak state of the garrison and asked to be re-embarked to be taken to Livorno. Boats of the squadron towed them off the shore in country vessels and the ships towed the whole to the Livorno roads. The troops and Marines landed on the evening of 13 December and they occupied the suburbs of the town. Some 700 cavalry and infantry attacked the marines, who opened to let the cavalry pass through them, killing all but 14 and 2 officers. Of these, the Italian levy killed all but one officer. The marines charged and routed the remainder, killing, wounding or taking prisoner between 250 and 300 men. <em>Edinburgh</em> had three marines wounded.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a></p>
