<p><strong>Animal testing</strong> or <strong>animal research</strong> is the use of non-human <a href="animals" class="uri" title="wikilink">animals</a> in <a href="Experiment" title="wikilink">scientific experimentation</a>. It is estimated that 50 to 100 million <a href="vertebrate" class="uri" title="wikilink">vertebrate</a> animals worldwide — from <a href="zebrafish" class="uri" title="wikilink">zebrafish</a> to <a href="Primate" title="wikilink">non-human primates</a> — are used annually.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> Although much larger numbers of <a href="invertebrate" title="wikilink">invertebrates</a> are used and the use of flies and worms as <a href="model_organism" title="wikilink">model organisms</a> is very important, experiments on invertebrates are largely unregulated and not included in statistics. Most animals are euthanized after being used in an experiment. Sources of laboratory animals vary between countries and species; while most animals are purpose-bred, others may be caught in the wild or supplied by dealers who obtain them from auctions and <a href="Animal_shelter" title="wikilink">pounds</a>.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>The research is conducted inside universities, medical schools, pharmaceutical companies, farms, defense establishments, and commercial facilities that provide animal-testing services to industry.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> It includes pure research such as <a href="genetic" title="wikilink">genetics</a>, <a href="developmental_biology" title="wikilink">developmental biology</a>, <a href="animal_behaviour" title="wikilink">behavioural studies</a>, as well as applied research such as <a href="biomedical_research" title="wikilink">biomedical research</a>, <a href="xenotransplantation" class="uri" title="wikilink">xenotransplantation</a>, drug testing and <a href="Toxicology_testing" title="wikilink">toxicology tests</a>, including <a href="Testing_cosmetics_on_animals" title="wikilink">cosmetics testing</a>.

<h2 id="definitions">Definitions</h2>
<p>The terms animal testing, <strong>animal experimentation</strong>, animal research, <strong><em>in vivo</em> testing</strong>, and <strong><a href="vivisection" class="uri" title="wikilink">vivisection</a></strong> have similar <a href="denotation" title="wikilink">denotations</a> but different <a href="connotation" title="wikilink">connotations</a>. Literally, &quot;vivisection&quot; means the &quot;cutting up&quot; of a living animal, and historically referred only to experiments that involved the <a href="dissection" class="uri" title="wikilink">dissection</a> of live animals. The term is now used to refer to any experiment using living animals; for example, the <em>Encyclopaedia Britannica</em> defines &quot;vivisection&quot; as: &quot;Operation on a living animal for experimental rather than healing purposes; more broadly, all experimentation on live animals.&quot;<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> For others, the word has a pejorative connotation, implying torture and suffering.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> The word &quot;vivisection&quot; is preferred by those opposed to this research, whereas scientists typically use the term &quot;animal experimentation.&quot;<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a><a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>

<p>Animals have been used throughout the history of scientific research. In the 1880s, <a href="Louis_Pasteur" title="wikilink">Louis Pasteur</a> convincingly demonstrated the <a href="Germ_theory_of_disease" title="wikilink">germ theory</a> of medicine by inducing <a href="anthrax" class="uri" title="wikilink">anthrax</a> in sheep.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> In the 1890s, <a href="Ivan_Pavlov" title="wikilink">Ivan Pavlov</a> famously used dogs to describe <a href="classical_conditioning" title="wikilink">classical conditioning</a>.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> <a href="Insulin" class="uri" title="wikilink">Insulin</a> was first isolated from dogs in 1922, and revolutionized the treatment of <a href="diabetes" class="uri" title="wikilink">diabetes</a>.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> On <a href="November_3" title="wikilink">November 3</a>, <a href="1957" class="uri" title="wikilink">1957</a>, a <a href="Russian_space_dogs" title="wikilink">Russian dog</a>, <a href="Laika" class="uri" title="wikilink">Laika</a>, became the first of many <a href="Animals_in_space" title="wikilink">animals to orbit the earth</a>.

The ability of humans to change the <a href="genetic" title="wikilink">genetics</a> of animals took a large step forwards in 1974 when <a href="Rudolf_Jaenisch" title="wikilink">Rudolf Jaenisch</a> was able to produce the first <a href="genetically_modified_organism" title="wikilink">transgenic mammal</a>, by integrating DNA from the <a href="SV40" class="uri" title="wikilink">SV40</a> virus into the <a href="genome" class="uri" title="wikilink">genome</a> of mice.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> This genetic research progressed rapidly and, in 1996, <a href="Dolly_the_sheep" title="wikilink">Dolly the sheep</a> was born, the first mammal to be <a href="Clone_(genetics)" title="wikilink">cloned</a> from an adult cell.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> <img src="Claude_Bernard_5.jpg" title="fig:Claude Bernard, regarded as the &quot;prince of vivisectors&quot; and one of the greatest men of science, argued that experiments on animals are &quot;entirely conclusive for the toxicology and hygiene of man,&quot;." alt="Claude Bernard, regarded as the &quot;prince of vivisectors&quot; and one of the greatest men of science, argued that experiments on animals are &quot;entirely conclusive for the toxicology and hygiene of man,&quot;." width="180" /> Toxicology testing became important in the 20th century. In the 19th century, laws regulating drugs were lax. For example, in the U.S., the government could only ban a drug after a company had been prosecuted for selling products that harmed customers. However, in response to a tragedy in 1937 where a drug labeled &lt;U+201C&gt;Elixir of Sulfanilamide&lt;U+201D&gt; killed 73 people, the U.S. congress passed laws that required safety testing of drugs, before they could be marketed.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> Similar laws soon followed in other countries.</p>
<p>The controversy surrounding animal testing dates back to the 17th century. In 1655, the advocate of <a href="Galen" title="wikilink">Galenic</a> physiology <a href="Edmund_O&#39;Meara" title="wikilink">Edmund O'Meara</a> said that &quot;the miserable torture of vivisection places the body in an unnatural state.&quot;<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a><a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> O'Meara and others argued that animal physiology could be affected by pain during vivisection, rendering results unreliable. There were also objections on an <a href="Ethics_(philosophy)" title="wikilink">ethical</a> basis, contending that the benefit to humans did not justify the harm to animals.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> Early objections to animal testing also came from another angle — many people believed that animals were inferior to humans and so different that results from animals could not be applied to humans.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a></p>
<p>On the other side of the debate, those in favor of animal testing held that experiments on animals were necessary to advance medical and biological knowledge. <a href="Claude_Bernard" title="wikilink">Claude Bernard</a>, known as the &quot;prince of vivisectors&quot;<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> and the father of physiology — whose wife, Marie Fran&lt;U+00E7&gt;oise Martin, founded the first anti-vivisection society in France in 1883<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> — famously wrote in 1865 that &quot;the science of life is a superb and dazzlingly lighted hall which may be reached only by passing through a long and ghastly kitchen&quot;.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> Arguing that &quot;experiments on animals ... are entirely conclusive for the toxicology and hygiene of man...the effects of these substances are the same on man as on animals, save for differences in degree,&quot;<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> Bernard established animal experimentation as part of the standard <a href="scientific_method" title="wikilink">scientific method</a>.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> In 1896, the physiologist and physician <a href="Walter_Cannon" title="wikilink">Dr. Walter B.

The legislation was promoted by <a href="Charles_Darwin" title="wikilink">Charles Darwin</a>, who wrote to <a href="Ray_Lankester" title="wikilink">Ray Lankester</a> in March 1871: &quot;You ask about my opinion on vivisection.

Antivivisectionists of the era generally believed the spread of mercy was the great cause of civilization, and vivisection was cruel. However, in the USA the antivivisectionists' efforts were defeated in every legislature, overwhelmed by the superior organization and influence of the medical community. Overall, this movement had little legislative success until the passing of the Laboratory Animal Welfare Act, in 1966.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a></p>

<h3 id="regulations">Regulations</h3>
<p>The regulations that apply to animals in laboratories vary across species. In the U.S., under the provisions of the Animal Welfare Act and the <a href="National_Institutes_of_Health" title="wikilink">National Institutes of Health</a>'s (NIH) <em>Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals</em> (the <em>Guide</em>), any procedure can be performed on an animal if it can be successfully argued that it is scientifically justified. In general, researchers are required to consult with the institution's veterinarian and its <a href="Institutional_Animal_Care_and_Use_Committee" title="wikilink">Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee</a> (IACUC), which every research facility is obliged to maintain.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> The IACUC must ensure that alternatives, including non-animal alternatives, have been considered, that the experiments are not unnecessarily duplicative, and that pain relief is given unless it would interfere with the study. Larry Carbone, a laboratory animal veterinarian, writes that, in his experience, IACUCs take their work very seriously regardless of the species involved, though the use of non-human primates always raises what he calls a &quot;red flag of special concern.&quot;<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a></p>
<p>Mice, rats, and birds are not included in the provisions of the Animal Welfare Act (though they are included in the <em>Guide</em>) and over the years, the definition of &quot;animal&quot; used by <a href="United_States_Congress" title="wikilink">Congress</a> and the <a href="United_States_Department_of_Agriculture" title="wikilink">United States Department of Agriculture</a> (USDA) has changed several times to ensure that certain animals are included in protective legislation and that others, particularly farm animals, are excluded.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a></p>

The <a href="British_Union_for_the_Abolition_of_Vivisection" title="wikilink">British Union for the Abolition of Vivisection</a> (BUAV) estimates that 100 million vertebrates are experimented on around the world every year, 10–11 million of them in the European Union.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> The Nuffield Council on Bioethics reports that global annual estimates range from 50 to 100 million animals.</p>

In the case of <em>C. elegans</em>, the worm's body is completely transparent and the precise lineage of all the organism's cells is known,<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a> while studies in the fly <em>D. melanogaster</em> can use an amazing array of genetic tools.<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a> These animals offer great advantages over vertebrates, including their short life cycle and the ease with which large numbers may be studied, with thousands of flies or nematodes fitting into a single room. However, the lack of an adaptive <a href="immune_system" title="wikilink">immune system</a> and their simple organs prevent worms from being used in medical research such as vaccine development.<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a> Similarly, flies are not widely used in applied medical research, as their <a href="immune_system" title="wikilink">immune system</a> differs greatly from that of humans,<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a> and diseases in insects can be very different from diseases in more complex animals.<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a></p>

<h3 id="pain-and-suffering">Pain and suffering</h3>


<p>The extent to which animal testing causes pain and suffering, and the capacity of animals to experience and comprehend them, is the subject of much debate.<a href="#fn85" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref85"><sup>85</sup></a></p>
<p>According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, in 2006 about 670,000 animals (not including rats, mice, birds, or invertebrates) were used in procedures that did not include more than momentary pain or distress. About 420,000 were used in procedures in which pain or distress was relieved by anesthesia, while 84,000 were used in studies that would cause pain or distress that would not be relieved.<a href="#fn86" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref86"><sup>86</sup></a></p>
<p>In the UK, research projects are classified as mild, moderate, and substantial in terms of the suffering the researchers conducting the study say they may cause; a fourth category of &quot;unclassified&quot; means the animal was <a href="Anesthesia" title="wikilink">anesthetized</a> and killed without recovering <a href="consciousness" class="uri" title="wikilink">consciousness</a>, according to the researchers. In December 2001, 39 percent (1,296) of project licenses in force were classified as mild, 55 percent (1,811) as moderate, two percent (63) as substantial, and 4 percent (139) as unclassified.<a href="#fn87" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref87"><sup>87</sup></a> Although there have been suggestions of systemic underestimation of procedure severity<a href="#fn88" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref88"><sup>88</sup></a></p>
<p>The idea that animals might not feel pain as human beings feel it traces back to the 17th-century French philosopher, <a href="Ren&lt;U+00E9&gt;_Descartes" title="wikilink">Ren&lt;U+00E9&gt; Descartes</a>, who argued that animals do not experience pain and suffering because they lack <a href="consciousness" class="uri" title="wikilink">consciousness</a>.<a href="#fn89" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref89"><sup>89</sup></a><a href="#fn90" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref90"><sup>90</sup></a> <a href="Bernard_Rollin" title="wikilink">Bernard Rollin</a> of <a href="Colorado_State_University" title="wikilink">Colorado State University</a>, the principal author of two U.S. federal laws regulating pain relief for animals,<a href="#fn91" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref91"><sup>91</sup></a> writes that researchers continued remained unsure into the 1980s as to whether animals experience pain, and that veterinarians trained in the U.S. before 1989 were simply taught to ignore animal pain.<a href="#fn92" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref92"><sup>92</sup></a> In his interactions with scientists and other veterinarians, he was regularly asked to &quot;prove&quot; that animals are conscious, and to provide &quot;scientifically acceptable&quot; grounds for claiming that they feel pain.<a href="#fn93" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref93"><sup>93</sup></a> Carbone writes that the view that animals feel pain differently is now a minority view. Academic reviews of the topic are more equivocal, noting that although the argument that animals have at least simple conscious thoughts and feelings has strong support,<a href="#fn94" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref94"><sup>94</sup></a> some critics continue to question how reliably animal mental states can be determined.<a href="#fn95" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref95"><sup>95</sup></a><a href="#fn96" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref96"><sup>96</sup></a> The ability of invertebrate species of animals, such as insects, to feel pain and suffering is also unclear.<a href="#fn97" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref97"><sup>97</sup></a><a href="#fn98" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref98"><sup>98</sup></a></p>
<p>The defining text on animal welfare regulation, &quot;Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals&quot; defines the parameters that govern animal testing in the USA. It states &quot;The ability to experience and respond to pain is widespread in the animal kingdom...Pain is a stressor and, if not relieved, can lead to unacceptable levels of stress and distress in animals.&quot;<a href="#fn99" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref99"><sup>99</sup></a> The Guide states that the ability to recognize the symptoms of pain in different species is vital in efficiently applying pain relief and that it is essential for the people caring for and using animals to be entirely familiar with these symptoms. On the subject of analgesics used to relieve pain, the Guide states &quot;The selection of the most appropriate analgesic or anesthetic should reflect professional judgment as to which best meets clinical and humane requirements without compromising the scientific aspects of the research protocol&quot;. Accordingly, all issues of animal pain and distress, and their potential treatment with analgesia and anesthesia, are required regulatory issues in receiving animal protocol approval.</p>
<h3 id="euthanasia">Euthanasia</h3>

<p>There is general agreement that animal life should not be taken wantonly, and regulations require that scientists use as few animals as possible.<a href="#fn100" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref100"><sup>100</sup></a> However, policy makers consider suffering to be the central issue, and see animal euthanasia as a way to reduce suffering, while others, such as the <a href="RSPCA" class="uri" title="wikilink">RSPCA</a>, argue that the lives of laboratory animals have intrinsic value.<a href="#fn101" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref101"><sup>101</sup></a> Regulations focus on whether particular methods cause pain and suffering, not whether their death is undesirable in itself.<a href="#fn102" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref102"><sup>102</sup></a> Researchers call the killing of laboratory animals after an experiment &quot;euthanasia&quot; — literally &quot;good death&quot; — a term applied to all animals, including the young and healthy, although the same term is used of human beings only when the death will end severe suffering that cannot otherwise be relieved.<a href="#fn103" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref103"><sup>103</sup></a> The animals are euthanized at the end of studies for sample collection or <a href="Autopsy" title="wikilink">post-mortem examination</a>; during studies if their pain or suffering falls into certain categories regarded as unacceptable, such as depression, infection that is unresponsive to treatment, or the failure of large animals to eat for five days;<a href="#fn104" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref104"><sup>104</sup></a> or when they are unsuitable for breeding or unwanted for some other reason.<a href="#fn105" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref105"><sup>105</sup></a></p>
<p>Methods of euthanizing laboratory animals are chosen to induce rapid unconsciousness and death without pain or distress.<a href="#fn106" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref106"><sup>106</sup></a> The methods that are preferred are those published by councils of veterinarians. The animal can be made to inhale a gas, such as <a href="carbon_monoxide" title="wikilink">carbon monoxide</a> and <a href="carbon_dioxide" title="wikilink">carbon dioxide</a>, by being placed in a chamber, or by use of a face mask, with or without prior sedation or anesthesia. <a href="Sedative" title="wikilink">Sedatives</a> or <a href="anesthetic" title="wikilink">anesthetics</a> such as <a href="barbiturate" title="wikilink">barbiturates</a> can be given <a href="Intravenous_therapy" title="wikilink">intravenously</a>, or inhalant anesthetics may be used. Amphibians and fish may be immersed in water containing an anesthetic such as <a href="tricaine" class="uri" title="wikilink">tricaine</a>. Physical methods are also used, with or without sedation or anesthesia depending on the method. Recommended methods include <a href="decapitation" class="uri" title="wikilink">decapitation</a> (beheading) for small rodents or rabbits. <a href="Cervical_dislocation" title="wikilink">Cervical dislocation</a> (breaking the neck or spine) may be used for birds, mice, and immature rats and rabbits. <a href="Maceration" class="uri" title="wikilink">Maceration</a> (grinding into small pieces) is used on 1 day old chicks.

<h3 id="pure-research">Pure research</h3>
<p>Basic or pure research investigates how organisms behave, develop, and function. Those opposed to animal testing object that pure research may have little or no practical purpose, but researchers argue that it may produce unforeseen benefits, rendering the distinction between pure and applied research — research that has a specific practical aim — unclear.<a href="#fn108" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref108"><sup>108</sup></a></p>
<p>Pure research uses larger numbers and a greater variety of animals than applied research. Fruit flies, nematode worms, mice and rats together account for the vast majority, though small numbers of other species are used, ranging from <a href="California_sea_slug" title="wikilink">sea slugs</a> through to <a href="armadillo" title="wikilink">armadillos</a>.<a href="#fn109" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref109"><sup>109</sup></a></p>

<ul>
<li>Studies on <em><a href="embryogenesis" class="uri" title="wikilink">embryogenesis</a></em> and <em><a href="developmental_biology" title="wikilink">developmental biology</a></em>. Mutants are created by adding <a href="transposon" title="wikilink">transposons</a> into their <a href="genome" title="wikilink">genomes</a>, or specific genes are deleted by <a href="gene_targeting" title="wikilink">gene targeting</a>.<a href="#fn110" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref110"><sup>110</sup></a><a href="#fn111" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref111"><sup>111</sup></a> By studying the changes in development these changes produce, scientists aim to understand both how organisms normally develop, and what can go wrong in this process. These studies are particularly powerful since the basic controls of development, such as the <a href="homeobox" class="uri" title="wikilink">homeobox</a> genes, have similar functions in organisms as diverse as fruit flies and man.<a href="#fn112" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref112"><sup>112</sup></a><a href="#fn113" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref113"><sup>113</sup></a></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Experiments into <em>behavior</em>, to understand how organisms detect and interact with each other and their environment, in which fruit flies, worms, mice, and rats are all widely used.<a href="#fn114" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref114"><sup>114</sup></a><a href="#fn115" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref115"><sup>115</sup></a> Studies of brain function, such as memory and social behavior, often use rats and birds.<a href="#fn116" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref116"><sup>116</sup></a><a href="#fn117" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref117"><sup>117</sup></a> For some species, behavioral research is combined with <a href="Behavioral_enrichment" title="wikilink">enrichment</a> strategies for animals in captivity because it allows them to engage in a wider range of activities.<a href="#fn118" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref118"><sup>118</sup></a></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Breeding experiments to study <em><a href="evolution" class="uri" title="wikilink">evolution</a></em> and <em><a href="genetics" class="uri" title="wikilink">genetics</a></em>. Laboratory mice, flies, fish, and worms are <a href="Inbreeding" title="wikilink">inbred</a> through many generations to create strains with defined characteristics.<a href="#fn119" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref119"><sup>119</sup></a> These provide animals of a known genetic background, an important tool for genetic analyses. Larger mammals are rarely bred specifically for such studies due to their slow rate of reproduction, though some scientists take advantage of <a href="Selective_breeding" title="wikilink">inbred domesticated animals</a>, such as dog or cattle breeds, for <a href="Comparative_genomics" title="wikilink">comparative</a> purposes. Scientists studying how animals evolve use many animal species, including <a href="mosquito" title="wikilink">mosquitos</a>, <a href="stickleback" title="wikilink">sticklebacks</a>, and <a href="lamprey" title="wikilink">lampreys</a>, to see how variations in where and how an organism lives (their <a href="ecological_niche" title="wikilink">niche</a>) produce <a href="adaptation" title="wikilink">adaptations</a> in their physiology and <a href="Comparative_anatomy" title="wikilink">morphology</a>.<a href="#fn120" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref120"><sup>120</sup></a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="applied-research">Applied research</h3>
<p>Applied research aims to solve specific and practical problems. Compared to pure research, which is largely academic in origin, applied research is usually carried out in the <a href="pharmaceutical_industry" title="wikilink">pharmaceutical industry</a>, or by universities in commercial partnerships. These may involve the use of <a href="animal_model" title="wikilink">animal models</a> of diseases or conditions, which are often discovered or generated by pure research programmes. In turn, such applied studies may be an early stage in the <a href="drug_discovery" title="wikilink">drug discovery</a> process. Examples include:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="Genetic_modification" title="wikilink">Genetic modification</a> of animals to study disease.

<li>Studies on models of naturally occurring disease and condition. Certain domestic and wild animals have a natural propensity or predisposition for certain conditions that are also found in humans.

</ul>
<ul>
<li>Studies on induced animal models of human diseases. Here, an animal is treated so that it develops <a href="pathology" class="uri" title="wikilink">pathology</a> and symptoms that resemble a human disease. Examples include restricting blood flow to the brain to induce <a href="stroke" class="uri" title="wikilink">stroke</a>, or giving <a href="neurotoxin" title="wikilink">neurotoxins</a> that cause damage similar to that seen in <a href="Parkinson&#39;s_disease" title="wikilink">Parkinson's disease</a>.<a href="#fn129" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref129"><sup>129</sup></a> Such studies can be difficult to interpret, and it is argued that they are not always comparable to human diseases.<a href="#fn130" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref130"><sup>130</sup></a> For example, although such models are now widely used to study Parkinson's disease, the British anti-vivisection interest group <a href="British_Union_for_the_Abolition_of_Vivisection" title="wikilink">BUAV</a> argues that these models only superficially resemble the disease symptoms, without the same time course or cellular pathology.<a href="#fn131" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref131"><sup>131</sup></a> In contrast, scientists assessing the usefulness of animal models of Parkinson's disease, as well as the medical research charity <em>The Parkinson's Appeal</em>, state that these models were invaluable and that they led to improved surgical treatments such as <a href="pallidotomy" class="uri" title="wikilink">pallidotomy</a>, new drug treatments such as <a href="levodopa" class="uri" title="wikilink">levodopa</a>, and later <a href="deep_brain_stimulation" title="wikilink">deep brain stimulation</a>.<a href="#fn132" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref132"><sup>132</sup></a><a href="#fn133" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref133"><sup>133</sup></a><a href="#fn134" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref134"><sup>134</sup></a></li>

The experiments were conducted by Imutran Ltd, a subsidiary of <a href="Novartis" class="uri" title="wikilink">Novartis</a> Pharma AG in conjunction with Cambridge University and Huntingdon Life Sciences. Novartis told the newspaper that developing new cures for humans invariably means experimenting on live animals.<a href="#fn140" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref140"><sup>140</sup></a></p>
<p>The newspaper also wrote that researchers were deliberately underestimating the suffering in order to obtain licences.

<h3 id="toxicology-testing">Toxicology testing</h3>


<p>Toxicology testing, also known as safety testing, is conducted by pharmaceutical companies testing drugs, or by contract animal testing facilities, such as <a href="Huntingdon_Life_Sciences" title="wikilink">Huntingdon Life Sciences</a>, on behalf of a wide variety of customers.<a href="#fn143" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref143"><sup>143</sup></a> According to 2005 EU figures, around one million animals are used every year in Europe in toxicology tests; which are about 10% of all procedures.<a href="#fn144" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref144"><sup>144</sup></a> According to <em>Nature</em>, 5,000 animals are used for each chemical being tested, with 12,000 needed to test pesticides.<a href="#fn145" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref145"><sup>145</sup></a> The tests are conducted without <a href="anesthesia" class="uri" title="wikilink">anesthesia</a>, because <a href="drug_interaction" title="wikilink">interactions between drugs</a> can affect how animals <a href="xenobiotic_metabolism" title="wikilink">detoxify</a> chemicals, and may interfere with the results.<a href="#fn146" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref146"><sup>146</sup></a> <img src="DraizeTest-PETA.jpg" title="fig:A rabbit during a Draize test." alt="A rabbit during a Draize test." width="180" /> Toxicology tests are used to examine finished products such as <a href="pesticide" title="wikilink">pesticides</a>, <a href="medication" title="wikilink">medications</a>, <a href="food_additives" title="wikilink">food additives</a>, packing materials, and air freshener, or their chemical ingredients. Most tests involve testing ingredients rather than finished products, but according to <a href="BUAV" class="uri" title="wikilink">BUAV</a>, manufacturers believe these tests overestimate the toxic effects of substances; they therefore repeat the tests using their finished products to obtain a less toxic label.<a href="#fn147" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref147"><sup>147</sup></a></p>
<p>The substances are applied to the skin or dripped into the eyes; injected <a href="intravenous" title="wikilink">intravenously</a>, <a href="intramuscular" title="wikilink">intramuscularly</a>, or <a href="subcutaneous" title="wikilink">subcutaneously</a>; inhaled either by placing a mask over the animals and restraining them, or by placing them in an inhalation chamber; or administered orally, through a tube into the stomach, or simply in the animal's food. Doses may be given once, repeated regularly for many months, or for the lifespan of the animal.</p>
<p>There are several different types of <a href="acute_toxicity" title="wikilink">acute toxicity</a> tests. The <a href="LD50" class="uri" title="wikilink">LD50</a> (&quot;Lethal Dose 50%&quot;) test is used to evaluate the toxicity of a substance by determining the dose required to kill 50% of the test animal <a href="Statistical_population" title="wikilink">population</a>. This test was removed from <a href="Organisation_for_Economic_Co-operation_and_Development" title="wikilink">OECD</a> international guidelines in 2002, replaced by methods such as the <a href="Fixed_Dose_Procedure" title="wikilink">fixed dose procedure</a>, which use fewer animals and cause less suffering.<a href="#fn148" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref148"><sup>148</sup></a><a href="#fn149" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref149"><sup>149</sup></a> <em>Nature</em> writes that, as of 2005, &quot;the LD50 acute toxicity test ... still accounts for one-third of all animal [toxicity] tests worldwide.&quot;<a href="#fn150" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref150"><sup>150</sup></a> <img src="LD50mouse.jpg" title="fig:|right|thumb|180px|A rat undergoing an LD50 test.

For Draize eye testing, the recommended protocol involves observing the effects of the substance at intervals and grading any damage or irritation, but that the test should be halted and the animal killed if it shows &quot;continuing signs of severe pain or distress&quot;.<a href="#fn151" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref151"><sup>151</sup></a> The <a href="Humane_Society_of_the_United_States" title="wikilink">Humane Society of the United States</a> writes that the procedure can cause redness, ulceration, hemorrhaging, cloudiness, or even blindness.<a href="#fn152" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref152"><sup>152</sup></a> This test has also been criticized by scientists for being cruel and inaccurate, subjective, over-sensitive, and failing to reflect human exposures in the real world.<a href="#fn153" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref153"><sup>153</sup></a> Although no accepted <em>in vitro</em> alternatives exist, a modified form of the Draize test called the <em>low volume eye test</em> may reduce suffering and provide more realistic results, but it has not yet replaced the original test.<a href="#fn154" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref154"><sup>154</sup></a></p>
<p>The most stringent tests are reserved for drugs and foodstuffs. For these, a number of tests are performed, lasting less than a month (acute), one to three months (subchronic), and more than three months (chronic) to test general toxicity (damage to organs), eye and skin irritancy, <a href="mutagen" title="wikilink">mutagenicity</a>, <a href="carcinogen" title="wikilink">carcinogenicity</a>, <a href="teratogen" title="wikilink">teratogenicity</a>, and reproductive problems. The cost of the full complement of tests is several million dollars per substance and it may take three or four years to complete.</p>
<p>These toxicity tests provide, in the words of a 2006 <a href="United_States_National_Academy_of_Sciences" title="wikilink">United States National Academy of Sciences</a> report, &quot;critical information for assessing hazard and risk potential&quot;.<a href="#fn155" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref155"><sup>155</sup></a> However, as <em>Nature</em> reported, most animal tests either over- or underestimate risk, or do not reflect toxicity in humans particularly well.<a href="#fn156" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref156"><sup>156</sup></a> This variability stems from using the effects of high doses of chemicals in small numbers of laboratory animals to try to predict the effects of low doses in large numbers of humans.<a href="#fn157" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref157"><sup>157</sup></a> Although relationships do exist, opinion is divided on how to use data on one species to predict the exact level of risk in another.<a href="#fn158" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref158"><sup>158</sup></a></p>

<h4 id="cosmetics-testing">Cosmetics testing</h4>

<p>Cosmetics testing on animals is particularly controversial. Such tests, which are still conducted in the U.S., involve general toxicity, eye and skin irritancy, <a href="phototoxic" title="wikilink">phototoxicity</a> (toxicity triggered by <a href="ultraviolet" class="uri" title="wikilink">ultraviolet</a> light) and mutagenicity.<a href="#fn159" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref159"><sup>159</sup></a></p>
<p>Cosmetics testing is banned in the Netherlands, Belgium, and the UK, and in 2002, after 13 years of discussion, the European Union (EU) agreed to phase in a near-total ban on the sale of animal-tested cosmetics throughout the EU from 2009, and to ban all cosmetics-related animal testing. France, which is home to the world's largest cosmetics company, <a href="L&#39;Oreal" class="uri" title="wikilink">L'Oreal</a>, has protested the proposed ban by lodging a case at the <a href="European_Court_of_Justice" title="wikilink">European Court of Justice</a> in <a href="Luxembourg" class="uri" title="wikilink">Luxembourg</a>, asking that the ban be quashed.<a href="#fn160" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref160"><sup>160</sup></a> The ban is also opposed by the European Federation for Cosmetics Ingredients, which represents 70 companies in Switzerland, Belgium, France, Germany and Italy.<a href="#fn161" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref161"><sup>161</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="drug-testing">Drug testing</h3>
<p><img src="Dogs6CCcopy.jpg" title="fig:Beagles used for safety testing of pharmaceuticals in a British facility." alt="Beagles used for safety testing of pharmaceuticals in a British facility." width="220" /> Before the early 20th century, laws regulating drugs were lax. Nowadays all new pharmaceuticals undergo rigorous animal testing before being licensed for human use. Tests on pharmaceutical products involve:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>metabolic tests</em>, investigating <a href="pharmacokinetics" class="uri" title="wikilink">pharmacokinetics</a> - how drugs are absorbed, <a href="Drug_metabolism" title="wikilink">metabolized</a> and <a href="Excretion" title="wikilink">excreted</a> by the body when introduced <a href="Wiktionary:oral" title="wikilink">orally</a>, <a href="intravenous" title="wikilink">intravenously</a>, intraperitoneally, <a href="intramuscular" title="wikilink">intramuscularly</a>, or <a href="Transdermal_patch" title="wikilink">transdermally</a>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><em>toxicology tests</em>, which gauge <a href="acute_toxicity" title="wikilink">acute</a>, sub-acute, and <a href="chronic_toxicity" title="wikilink">chronic toxicity</a>. Acute toxicity is studied by using a rising dose until signs of toxicity become apparent. Current European legislation demands that &quot;acute toxicity tests must be carried out in two or more mammalian species&quot; covering &quot;at least two different routes of administration&quot;.<a href="#fn162" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref162"><sup>162</sup></a> Sub-acute toxicity is where the drug is given to the animals for four to six weeks in doses below the level at which it causes rapid poisoning, in order to discover if any toxic <a href="drug_metabolism" title="wikilink">drug metabolites</a> build up over time. Testing for chronic toxicity can last up to two years and, in the European Union, is required to involve two species of mammals, one of which must be non-rodent.<a href="#fn163" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref163"><sup>163</sup></a></li>
<li><em>efficacy studies</em>, which test whether experimental drugs work by inducing the appropriate illness in animals. The drug is then administered in a <a href="Randomized_controlled_trial" title="wikilink">double-blind controlled trial</a>, which allows researchers to determine the effect of the drug and the <a href="Dose_response" title="wikilink">dose-response</a> curve.</li>
<li>Specific tests on <em>reproductive function</em>, <em>embryonic toxicity</em>, or <em>carcinogenic potential</em> can all be required by law, depending on the result of other studies and the type of drug being tested.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="education-breeding-and-defense">Education, breeding, and defense</h3>
<p>Animals are also used for education and training; are bred for use in laboratories; and are used by the military to develop weapons, vaccines, battlefield surgical techniques, and defensive clothing.<a href="#fn164" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref164"><sup>164</sup></a> <img src="Rodent52copy.jpg" title="fig:A technician assessing mice in a typical research vivarium." alt="A technician assessing mice in a typical research vivarium." width="220" /></p>
<p>There are efforts in many countries to find alternatives to using animals in education.<a href="#fn165" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref165"><sup>165</sup></a> Horst Spielmann, German director of the Central Office for Collecting and Assessing Alternatives to Animal Experimentation, while describing Germany's progress in this area, told German broadcaster <a href="ARD" class="uri" title="wikilink">ARD</a> in 2005: &quot;Using animals in teaching curricula is already superfluous. In many countries, one can become a doctor, vet or biologist without ever having performed an experiment on an animal.&quot;<a href="#fn166" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref166"><sup>166</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="ethics">Ethics</h2>

<p>The <a href="ethics" title="wikilink">ethical</a> questions raised by performing experiments on animals are subject to much debate, and viewpoints have shifted significantly over the 20th century.<a href="#fn167" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref167"><sup>167</sup></a> There remain strong disagreements about which animal testing procedures are useful for which purposes, as well as disagreements over which ethical principles apply, and to which species of animals. The dominant ethical position, world-wide, is that achievement of scientific and medical goals using animal testing is desirable, provided that animal suffering and use is minimized.<a href="#fn168" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref168"><sup>168</sup></a> The British government has additionally required that the cost to animals in an experiment be weighed against the gain in knowledge.<a href="#fn169" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref169"><sup>169</sup></a></p>
<p>A wide range of minority viewpoints exist as well. The view that animals have moral rights (<a href="animal_rights" title="wikilink">animal rights</a>) is a philosophical position proposed by <a href="Tom_Regan" title="wikilink">Tom Regan</a>, who argues that animals are beings with beliefs, desires and self-consciousness.<a href="#fn170" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref170"><sup>170</sup></a> Such beings are seen as having inherent value and thus possessing <a href="right" title="wikilink">rights</a>. Regan still sees clear ethical differences between killing animals and killing humans, and argues that to save human lives it is permissible to kill animals. However, some such as <a href="Bernard_Rollin" title="wikilink">Bernard Rollin</a> have taken his position further and argue that any benefits to human beings cannot outweigh animal suffering, and that human beings have no moral right to use an individual animal in ways that do not benefit that individual.<a href="#fn171" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref171"><sup>171</sup></a> Another prominent position is articulated by <a href="Peter_Singer" title="wikilink">Peter Singer</a>, who sees no convincing reason to include a being's species in considerations of whether their suffering is important in <a href="utilitarianism" title="wikilink">utilitarian</a> moral considerations.<a href="#fn172" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref172"><sup>172</sup></a> Although these arguments have not been widely accepted, in response to these concerns some governments such as the <a href="Netherlands" class="uri" title="wikilink">Netherlands</a> and <a href="New_Zealand" title="wikilink">New Zealand</a> have outlawed invasive experiments on certain classes of non-human primates, particularly the <a href="Great_Apes" title="wikilink">Great Apes</a>.<a href="#fn173" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref173"><sup>173</sup></a><a href="#fn174" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref174"><sup>174</sup></a></p>

<h2 id="alternatives-to-animal-testing">Alternatives to animal testing</h2>

<p>Scientists and governments state that animal testing should cause as little suffering to animals as possible, and that animal tests should only be performed where necessary. The &quot;three Rs&quot;<a href="#fn196" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref196"><sup>196</sup></a> are guiding <a href="Moral_obligation" title="wikilink">principles</a> for the use of animals in research in most countries:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Reduction</strong> refers to methods that enable researchers to obtain comparable levels of information from fewer animals, or to obtain more information from the same number of animals.</li>
<li><strong>Replacement</strong> refers to the preferred use of non-animal methods over animal methods whenever it is possible to achieve the same scientific aim.</li>
<li><strong>Refinement</strong> refers to methods that alleviate or minimize potential pain, suffering or distress, and enhance animal welfare for the animals still used.<a href="#fn197" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref197"><sup>197</sup></a></li>
</ul>
<p>Although such principles have been welcomed as a step forwards by some animal welfare groups,<a href="#fn198" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref198"><sup>198</sup></a> they have also been criticized as both outdated by current research,<a href="#fn199" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref199"><sup>199</sup></a> and of little practical effect in improving animal welfare.<a href="#fn200" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref200"><sup>200</sup></a></p>
