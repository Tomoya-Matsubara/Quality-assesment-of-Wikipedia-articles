He has loved her ever since she made a childhood promise to marry him when they were older, but because of Takashi's indecisiveness, Rei ended up dating their friend Hisashi. He was one of the first people to notice that something was wrong in the school, when the teachers were attacked at the front gate. When Hisashi was bitten, Takashi was asked to throw Hisashi off the roof, but Rei refused, and when Hisashi turned into a zombie, Takashi killed him with a blow to the head. After being accused by Rei that he did that out of jealousy, Takashi proceeds to leave, but Rei holds him back, apologizing, and Takashi responds with a hug.</p>
<p>Though initially depicted as a poor student who often skips class and was held back a year, he is proven to be a very reliable and capable person with a resolve to protect his friends. He is given the role of leader of the group by his peers.</p>
<p>Takashi initially uses a <a href="baseball_bat" title="wikilink">baseball bat</a> to fight, but recovers a <a href="Smith_&amp;_Wesson_Model_37" title="wikilink">Smith &amp; Wesson Model 37</a> pistol from a dead cop, and, in chapter 9, he tries out the <a href="Ithaca_37" title="wikilink">Ithaca M37 riot shotgun</a> that he and Kohta acquired when they stayed at Rika's apartment when they fight at the <a href="Humvee" class="uri" title="wikilink">Humvee</a>.

<p>is Takashi Komuro's classmate and the female protagonist of the series. Before high school, she made a pinky promise to marry Takashi in the future, but because of Takashi's indecisiveness, Rei ended up dating Hisashi. Rei was furious when Takashi killed Hisashi even though he turned into a zombie. However, when Takashi was going to leave, Rei quickly rescinded her words and apologized, pulling him back, and then received a hug from Takashi.</p>
<p>Rei dated Hisashi, but her feelings for Takashi never disappeared. In chapter 12, Rei tells Takashi that girls like guys that are cute and caring, even though Takashi replied that he wasn't either of those. Rei responds that she used to be like that, but because Takashi is selfless, that's why she likes him, and she doesn't want him to be with any other girls.</p>
<p>Rei dislikes <a href="#Koichi_Shido" title="wikilink">Mr. Shido</a>. In chapter 14, Rei reveals that Shido held Rei back a year in school because Rei's father was a police detective who was investigating some funding corruption by Shido's father.</p>
<p>Rei is a member of the <em><a href="s&lt;U+014D&gt;jutsu" class="uri" title="wikilink">s&lt;U+014D&gt;jutsu</a></em> club, so for weapons, Rei started fighting the zombies using the sharp end of a disassembled broomstick.

<dl>

<dd><p><a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
</dd>
</dl>

<p>is a second-year student at Fujimi High School. She is a self-proclaimed genius; her knowledge and deductive capabilities have allowed the group to escape from harm many times. Her hair style is pink <a href="bunches" title="wikilink">twin tails</a>, and in chapter 2, she <a href="meganekko" title="wikilink">wears glasses</a> after stating that her contacts have been in too long. She was among the first to conclude that &quot;they&quot; were attracted to only sound. She and Takashi have also been childhood friends since kindergarten, although this is not mentioned until the gang reaches the Takagi estate.</p>
<p>Slightly self-conscious, she detests the fact that people, due to her status, only call her by her last name and never look her in the eyes when speaking to her. Thus, she insists that Kohta and Takashi call her by her first name throughout the series, even stating that they would lose their privilege to do so if they don't listen to her. She also insists that Alice call her by the <a href="Oneesama#Sama" title="wikilink">-onee-sama(big sister)</a> <a href="Japanese_honorifics" title="wikilink">honorific</a> instead of the <a href="-chan" class="uri" title="wikilink">-chan</a> <a href="Japanese_honorifics" title="wikilink">honorific</a>.</p>
<p>Saya is the daughter of an influential <a href="Uyoku_dantai" title="wikilink">Uyoku dantai</a> politician, and her family is fairly wealthy, that they are able to use their mansion estate as a base. Her relationship with her parents is mixed; on one hand, she admires all their capabilities in saving their staff, but on the other hand, she believes they neglected finding her when the outbreak happened.</p>
<p>Saya is hinted to have romantic feelings for Takashi but denies it when confronted. Saya might also have some feelings for Kohta, as his image haunts her in a dream, and she tried to bury her feelings when she sees Kohta and Asami happily conversing, sadly telling Alice that she can't be the best in everything.</p>
<p>Saya initially used an <a href="electric_drill" title="wikilink">electric drill</a> on a zombie in the school, and later she borrows a rifle to fight off the zombies when they are stuck at the <a href="Humvee" class="uri" title="wikilink">Humvee</a> When the zombies invade the Takagi estate, Saya's mother gives her a <a href="Luger_P08_pistol" title="wikilink">Luger P08 pistol</a>. After the gang raids the police station, she expresses her desire to fight more, and exchanges her mom's <a href="Luger_P08_pistol" title="wikilink">Luger</a> for Kohta's <a href="MP5#Suppressed_variants" title="wikilink">Suppressed MP5 SFK</a>.</p>
<h3 id="kohta-hirano">Kohta Hirano</h3>

</dl>

<p>is a 16-year old second-year student at Fujimi High School. Although he appears to be just another wimpy overweight guy with glasses, Kohta is a <a href="gun" class="uri" title="wikilink">gun</a> <a href="otaku" class="uri" title="wikilink">otaku</a>; his knowledge of firearms and skills as a basic marksman have proven to be an invaluable asset to keeping everyone alive. He credits this to a visit to America, where he spent a month doing Army training with a guy who worked for the US military contractor, <a href="Blackwater_USA" title="wikilink">Blackwater</a>. In the beginning of the story, Saya rescues Kohta who was cringing in the hallway after the students were running out in panic. They hide out in a classroom where Hirano is able to craft a <a href="nail_gun" title="wikilink">nail gun</a> rifle that fires using gas cartridges. Kohta has a crush on Saya and has wanted to ask her out on various occasions, only to either be rejected or not taken seriously. Kohta was also the first guy who wanted to rescue Alice, after seeing her father get killed by neighbors, and her being left for &quot;them&quot;.</p>
<p>At Saya's mansion, Kohta is confronted by some of Takagi's followers who demand that he surrender his weapons, but Kohta refuses, saying this was the one thing he was good at, and that he wanted to protect Saya. The rest of the group, including Saya, came out to defend him.</p>
<p>Kohta develops feelings for the police officer trainee, Asami Nakaoka, after helping her by subduing an angry mall survivor. He spends some quality time with her, and after she briefly escaped to the rooftop from seeing her supervisor turned zombie, Kohta manages to convince her to join the group. Unfortunately, the friendship is short-lived as Asami attempts to save a boy in the parking lot, and gets trapped. She shouts for Kohta to make it so that she won't become a zombie and cause pain to others around her. Kohta later finds himself in shock over what he did, but he is set straight by Shizuka, who uses a psychology trick of ordering him around like a sergeant.</p>
<p>Since crafting a <a href="nail_gun" title="wikilink">nail gun</a> rifle, Kohta has used a variety different firearms, preferring the <a href="AR-10" class="uri" title="wikilink">AR-10</a> (illegally modified to resemble an <a href="SR-25" class="uri" title="wikilink">SR-25</a>), since it has a scope to take out targets from a distance. During the raid on the police station, Kohta finds a <a href="MP5#Suppressed_variants" title="wikilink">Suppressed MP5 SFK</a>, but soon afterwards, gives it to Saya while holding onto her mom's <a href="Luger_P08_pistol" title="wikilink">Luger P08 pistol</a>.</p>
<p>His character seems to be based on <a href="Hirano_K&lt;U+014D&gt;ta" title="wikilink">Hirano K&lt;U+014D&gt;ta</a>, the author of the <em><a href="Hellsing_(manga)" title="wikilink">Hellsing</a></em> manga, as they both wear glasses, are overweight, and have detailed knowledge of different firearms.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>

She initially wears a long skirt at school. Saeko has a calm and collected personality, with a sense of pride in her skills. Early on in the series, Saeko does a mercy killing on a student who was bitten. Not much is known about her family except that she mentioned her father had traveled abroad for a martial arts tournament.</p>
<p>Saeko shares with Takashi about how four years prior, an assailant attacked her, but she easily fought back with her <a href="bokken" class="uri" title="wikilink">bokken</a>, breaking several of his bones before the police came. Although it was claimed to be self-defense, Saeko says this is her &quot;raw nature&quot; of taking pleasure in inflicting pain, and in that way she is no different from one of &quot;them&quot;. She struggles with this part of her character, and even considers giving up to &quot;them&quot;. When she fights her way out of the grounds, Saeko is so excited that she even says , a <a href="double_entendre" title="wikilink">double entendre</a>, considering she was doused by the river water earlier.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a><a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p>Saeko uses a <a href="bokken" class="uri" title="wikilink">bokken</a> for a weapon, but when they are at the Takagi estate, Saya's father tells Saeko that her father once gave him guidance so to repay the favor, and he gives her a <a href="katana" class="uri" title="wikilink">katana</a>, crafted in the Tokyo armory by General Murata during the <a href="Meiji_Era" title="wikilink">Meiji Era</a>.

She is close friends with <a href="#Rika_Minami" title="wikilink">Rika Minami</a>, who works as a sniper on the prefectural police <a href="Special_Assault_Team" title="wikilink">Special Assault Team</a>, and she even <a href="House_sitting" title="wikilink">house-sits</a> for Rika; the gang uses Rika's apartment to rest after they escaped the high school. Despite being the only adult in the group, she is emotionally fragile and doesn't know what will become of her life, revealing to Takashi that she is just the temporary school nurse, and is still taking classes and training. Despite that, Shizuka has put her knowledge to good use, and was also able to bring Kohta to his senses after an incident where Asami Nakaoka was killed.</p>
<p>As the eldest and only one with a license, she is the group's designated driver, initially driving the bus out of the school, and then Rika's military-grade <a href="Humvee" class="uri" title="wikilink">Humvee</a>.</p>

<p>In the English dub of the anime, she goes by the name <strong>Arisu</strong>.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> According to a bonus chapter, she was the next door neighbor to Takashi's friend, Imamuru.</p>

</dl>

<p>is the main antagonist of the series and the teacher of Class 3A. Rei Miyamoto is afraid and is disgusted by him and Saeko Busujima says his name with a scowl, hinting that he apparently is a sadistic and villainous character. This is affirmed when he leaves behind a student who sprained his ankle and even kicks him back towards a group of pursuing zombies, saying there is no point in keeping weaklings alive.</p>
<p>After Rei and Takashi leave, Shido appoints himself leader of the group on the bus, winning the approval of the other students. Saya and Saeko comment that Shido's actions are like that of a recruiter for a religious cult. Shido permits the main cast to leave the bus except for Shizuka, but Kohta expresses his disapproval of Shido's actions and grazes Shido's face with a nail gun shot, stating that Shido used to allow bullies to beat Kohta up as he watched with glee.</p>
<p>Shido reappears when he is talking with a spy at the Takagi estate. He then watches over an orgy among his followers. He finds this behavior acceptable during the group's &quot;free time&quot;. Shido declares his followers angels that will help usher in a new age, but when one of the boys disagrees and shows concern for his own family, Shido convinces his followers to eject the &quot;weak link&quot; for the sake of the New World, and they callously throw the teen off the bus and leave him to be eaten by &quot;them&quot;.</p>
<p>Shido was the son of Ichiro Shido, a politician that was admired by Saya&lt;U+2019&gt;s father. His mother died, but he went into the teaching profession at Tokonosu where his father was a director. But his father had an illegitimate son, and he was ordered to work in the family business with his half-brother; one of the shady dealings involved stopping Rei&lt;U+2019&gt;s father from investigating the Shido family&lt;U+2019&gt;s funding, and so he arranged that Rei was to be held back a year. When Rei threatens to kill Shido with her rifle-mounted bayonet, Shido dares her to do it, but she cannot, saying he is not worth the trouble. Saya's dad orders him and his student followers to leave, and he complies, but a <a href="high-altitude_nuclear_explosion" title="wikilink">high-altitude nuclear explosion</a> causes both the bus and nearby forklift with a concrete barrier to stall and they collide. He recovers consciousness in time to see the undead horde advancing through the gap in the barrier.</p>

Aware of his fate, he requested that Takashi throw him off the rooftop, but before Takashi could do that, he died, leaving Rei crying in pain, but then he rose back up as one of &quot;them&quot;, so Takashi consequently finished him off with a blow to the head.</p>

He also ordered that Kohta give up his weapons; however, Kohta insisted on keeping them to protect Saya, and Kohta's friends rallied in support.</p>
<p>Soichiro seems to be a sword expert, as he preferred using that over his wife's <a href="Luger_P08_pistol" title="wikilink">Luger P08 pistol</a>. He trained with Saeko's dad, and entrusts Saeko with a <a href="katana" class="uri" title="wikilink">katana</a>. When the zombies breach the estate, he and his troops fight them off.

She <a href="Illeism" title="wikilink">refers to herself in the third-person</a>. Asami's authority quickly waned amongst the survivors until Kohta and Takashi intervened by handing her their <a href="Smith_&amp;_Wesson_Model_37" title="wikilink">Smith &amp; Wesson Model 37</a> pistol (the standard-issue firearm for Japanese police officers) and building up her confidence. She develops a liking for Kohta after he subdued a guy named Shimada who wanted to sexually assault Shizuka.

Shortly after breaking out of the mall with the group, she attempts to save a frightened student trapped on top of a truck in the parking lot. She and Shimada distract the zombies long enough for the student to escape, however, Asami herself becomes trapped without any more bullets. Asami shouts that she hates Kohta, although Takashi immediately recognizes and tells Kohta she is just yelling to attract the zombies so they can escape. She shouts out one final request for Kohta to not let her get turned into a zombie, and Kohta sadly aims his rifle at her head as she salutes goodbye.</p>
