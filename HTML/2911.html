<p>The <strong>September 2009 Vietnam tropical depression</strong> was a weak tropical depression that produced deadly flooding throughout central Vietnam in early September. Forming out of an area of low pressure on September 3, the depression hardly intensified as it meandered off the coast of Vietnam. Initially situated in a favorable environment, <a href="Atmospheric_convection" title="wikilink">convective</a> <a href="Rainband" title="wikilink">banding features</a> began to develop and shower and thunderstorm activity formed near the center. On September 4, the <a href="Joint_Typhoon_Warning_Center" title="wikilink">Joint Typhoon Warning Center</a> issued a <a href="Tropical_Cyclone_Formation_Alert" title="wikilink">Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert</a>; however, a sudden increase in <a href="wind_shear" title="wikilink">wind shear</a> caused the system to rapidly become disorganized, leading to the cancellation of the alert the next day. The system continued to slowly track off the coast of Vietnam, nearly dissipating on September 5, before becoming better organized. However the depression remained weak, with the JTWC reporting on September 7 that the depression had dissipated, though the <a href="Japan_Meteorological_Agency" title="wikilink">Japan Meteorological Agency</a> (JMA) continued to issue advisories until the depression dissipated during September 9.</p>
<p>Although the depression did not make landfall, the outer effects of the storm led to heavy rainfall throughout central Vietnam, peaking at . The ensuing flood killed at least six people and left three others missing. Large areas of cropland were inundated by the waters and numerous homes were damaged. In <a href="Quang_Nam_Province" title="wikilink">Quang Nam Province</a>, damages from the system were estimated at 45 billion (<a href="Vietnamese_dong" title="wikilink">VND</a>; $2.52 million <a href="United_States_dollar" title="wikilink">USD</a>).</p>
<h2 id="meteorological-history">Meteorological history</h2>

<p>The tropical depression originated from an <a href="Low_pressure_area" title="wikilink">area of low pressure</a> in the <a href="South_China_Sea" title="wikilink">South China Sea</a> on September 1. Scattered <a href="Atmospheric_convection" title="wikilink">convection</a> was associated with the system, with the center devoid of showers and thunderstorms, as the low slowly tracked westward in a weak steering environment. Weak <a href="Outflow_(meteorology)" title="wikilink">outflow</a> had formed along the northern edge of the system; however, intensification was not anticipated.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> The following day, convection began to form around the <a href="Eye_(cyclone)" title="wikilink">center of circulation</a> and weak <a href="diffluence" class="uri" title="wikilink">diffluence</a> was noted around the system due to an <a href="anticyclone" class="uri" title="wikilink">anticyclone</a> to the north. With low <a href="wind_shear" title="wikilink">wind shear</a>, convective <a href="Rainband" title="wikilink">banding features</a> began to develop and the possibility of the system becoming a tropical cyclone increased.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> Early on September 3, the JMA began issuing advisories on the cyclone, classifying it as a tropical depression, the twentieth depression to be monitored by the JMA during the season.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>Although the system had a partially exposed low-level circulation center, the <a href="Joint_Typhoon_Warning_Center" title="wikilink">Joint Typhoon Warning Center</a> (JTWC) issued a <a href="Tropical_Cyclone_Formation_Alert" title="wikilink">Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert</a> (TCFA) as the depression was likely to intensify as it was situated over high <a href="sea_surface_temperature" title="wikilink">sea surface temperatures</a> and in a favorable environment.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> However, by September 4, wind shear quickly increased and dislocated all of the convection associated with the depression from the center of circulation. This led to the JTWC canceling their TCFA as the environment was no longer favorable for development.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> The following day, the JTWC declared that the system had dissipated and was no longer a suspect area for tropical cyclone development as the system was virtually stationary off the coast of Vietnam.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> The JMA, on the other hand, continued to monitor the cyclone as a tropical depression.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p>Although previously declaring that the system dissipated early on September 6, the JTWC began monitoring the re-developing system later that day. Convective banding had reformed, wind shear had decreased and the cyclone had less interaction with land as it slowly moved further into the South China Sea.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> However, late on September 8, both agencies declared that the depression had dissipated off the coast of Vietnam.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a><a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
