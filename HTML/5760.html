<p>The <strong>social history of viruses</strong> describes the influence of <a href="virus" title="wikilink">viruses</a> and viral infections on human history. <a href="Epidemic" title="wikilink">Epidemics</a> caused by viruses began when human behaviour changed during the <a href="Neolithic_period" title="wikilink">Neolithic period</a>. Having been <a href="hunter-gatherer" title="wikilink">hunter-gatherers</a>, humans developed more densely populated agricultural communities, which allowed viruses to spread rapidly and subsequently to become <a href="endemic_(epidemiology)" title="wikilink">endemic</a>. <a href="Plant_virus" title="wikilink">Viruses of plants</a> and livestock also increased, and as humans became dependent on agriculture and farming, diseases such as <a href="potyvirus" title="wikilink">potyviruses</a> of potatoes and <a href="rinderpest" class="uri" title="wikilink">rinderpest</a> of cattle had devastating consequences.</p>
<p><a href="Smallpox" class="uri" title="wikilink">Smallpox</a> and <a href="measles" class="uri" title="wikilink">measles</a> viruses are among the oldest that infect humans. Having evolved from viruses that infected animals, they first appeared in humans in Europe and North Africa thousands of years ago. The viruses were later carried to the New World by Europeans during the time of the <a href="Spanish_colonization_of_the_Americas" title="wikilink">Spanish Conquests</a>, but the <a href="Indigenous_peoples_of_the_Americas" title="wikilink">indigenous people</a> had no natural resistance to the viruses and thousands of them died during epidemics. Influenza <a href="pandemic" title="wikilink">pandemics</a> have been recorded since 1580, and they have occurred with increasing frequency in subsequent centuries. The <a href="1918_flu_pandemic" title="wikilink">pandemic of 1918&lt;U+2013&gt;19</a>, in which 40&lt;U+2013&gt;50 million died in less than a year, was one of the most devastating in history.</p>
<p><a href="Louis_Pasteur" title="wikilink">Louis Pasteur</a> and <a href="Edward_Jenner" title="wikilink">Edward Jenner</a> were the first to develop <a href="vaccine" title="wikilink">vaccines</a> to protect against viral infections. The nature of viruses remained unknown until the invention of the <a href="electron_microscope" title="wikilink">electron microscope</a> in the 1930s, when the science of <a href="virology" class="uri" title="wikilink">virology</a> gained momentum. In the 20th century many diseases both old and new were found to be caused by viruses. There were epidemics of <a href="poliomyelitis" class="uri" title="wikilink">poliomyelitis</a> that were only controlled following the development of a vaccine in the 1950s. <a href="HIV" class="uri" title="wikilink">HIV</a> is the most <a href="pathogen" title="wikilink">pathogenic</a> new virus to have emerged in centuries. Although scientific interest in them arose because of the diseases they cause, most viruses are beneficial. They drive evolution by <a href="horizontal_gene_transfer" title="wikilink">transferring genes</a> across species, play important roles in <a href="ecosystem" title="wikilink">ecosystems</a> and are essential to life. </p>
<h2 id="in-prehistory">In prehistory</h2>
<p>Over the past 50,000&lt;U+2013&gt;100,000 years, as <a href="modern_humans" title="wikilink">modern humans</a> increased in numbers and dispersed throughout the world, new infectious diseases emerged, including those caused by viruses.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> Earlier, humans lived in small, isolated communities, and most epidemic diseases did not exist.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> <a href="Smallpox" class="uri" title="wikilink">Smallpox</a>, which is the most lethal and devastating viral infection in history, first emerged among agricultural communities in India about 11,000 years ago.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> The virus, which only infected humans, probably descended from the <a href="poxviruses" class="uri" title="wikilink">poxviruses</a> of rodents.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> Humans probably came into contact with these rodents, and some people became infected by the viruses they carried. When viruses cross this so-called &quot;species barrier&quot;, their effects can be severe,<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> and humans may have had little <a href="immune_system" title="wikilink">natural resistance</a>. Contemporary humans lived in small communities, and those who succumbed to infection either died or developed immunity. This <a href="adaptive_immune_system" title="wikilink">acquired immunity</a> is only passed down to offspring temporarily, by <a href="antibody" title="wikilink">antibodies</a> in breast milk and other antibodies that cross the <a href="placenta" class="uri" title="wikilink">placenta</a> from the mother's blood to the unborn child's. Therefore, sporadic outbreaks probably occurred in each generation. In about 9000 BC, when many people began to settle on the fertile flood plains of the <a href="River_Nile" title="wikilink">River Nile</a>, the population became dense enough for the virus to maintain a constant presence because of the high concentration of susceptible people.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> Other epidemics of viral diseases that depend on large concentrations of people, such as <a href="mumps" class="uri" title="wikilink">mumps</a>, <a href="rubella" class="uri" title="wikilink">rubella</a> and <a href="polio" class="uri" title="wikilink">polio</a>, also first occurred at this time.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p>The <a href="Neolithic" class="uri" title="wikilink">Neolithic</a> age, which began in the Middle East in about 9500 BC, was a time when humans became farmers. This agricultural revolution embraced the development of <a href="monoculture" class="uri" title="wikilink">monoculture</a> and presented an opportunity for the rapid spread of several species of <a href="plant_virus" title="wikilink">plant viruses</a>.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> The divergence and spread of <a href="sobemovirus" title="wikilink">sobemoviruses</a> &lt;U+2013&gt; southern bean mosaic virus &lt;U+2013&gt; date from this time.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> The spread of the <a href="potyvirus" title="wikilink">potyviruses</a> of potatoes, and other fruits and vegetables, began about 6,600 years ago.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<p>About 10,000 years ago the humans who inhabited the lands around the <a href="Mediterranean_basin" title="wikilink">Mediterranean basin</a> began to domesticate wild animals. Pigs, cattle, goats, sheep, horses, camels, cats and dogs were all kept and bred in captivity.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> These animals would have brought their viruses with them.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> The transmission of viruses from animals to humans can occur, but such <a href="zoonosis" title="wikilink">zoonotic infections</a> are rare and subsequent human-to-human transmission of animal viruses is even rarer, although there are notable exceptions such as <a href="influenza" class="uri" title="wikilink">influenza</a>. Most viruses are species-specific and would have posed no threat to humans.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> The rare epidemics of viral diseases originating in animals would have been short-lived because the viruses were not fully adapted to humans<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> and the human populations were too small to maintain the chains of infection.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
<p>Other, more ancient, viruses have been less of a threat. <a href="Herpesviridae" title="wikilink">Herpes viruses</a> first infected the ancestors of modern humans over 80 million years ago.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> Humans have developed a tolerance to these viruses, and most are infected with at least one species.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> Records of these milder virus infections are rare, but it is likely that early hominids suffered from colds, influenza and diarrhoea caused by viruses just as humans do today.

<p>A measles infection confers lifelong immunity. Therefore the virus requires a high population density to become <a href="endemic_(epidemiology)" title="wikilink">endemic</a>, and this probably did not occur in the <a href="Neolithic" title="wikilink">Neolithic age</a>.<ref name="Levins, pp. 297<U+2013>298&quot;/&gt; Following the emergence of the virus in the <a href="Middle_East" title="wikilink">Middle East</a>, it reached India by 2500 BC.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> Measles was so common in children at the time that it was not recognised as a disease.

<p><img src="Edward_Jenner2.jpg" title="fig:Edward Jenner" alt="Edward Jenner" />  Lady <a href="Mary_Wortley_Montagu" title="wikilink">Mary Wortley Montagu</a> (1689&lt;U+2013&gt;1762) was an aristocrat, a writer and the wife of a <a href="Member_of_Parliament" title="wikilink">Member of Parliament</a>. In 1716, her husband, Edward Wortley Montagu was appointed British Ambassador in Istanbul. She followed him there and two weeks after her arrival discovered the local practice of protection against smallpox by <a href="variolation" class="uri" title="wikilink">variolation</a> &lt;U+2013&gt; the injection of pus from smallpox victims into the skin.<a href="#fn83" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref83"><sup>83</sup></a> Her younger brother had died of smallpox, and she too had had the disease. Determined to spare her five-year-old son Edward from similar suffering, she ordered the embassy surgeon, Charles Maitland to variolate him. On her return to London, she asked Maitland to variolate her four-year-old daughter in the presence of the king's physicians.<a href="#fn84" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref84"><sup>84</sup></a> Later, Montagu persuaded the <a href="George_II_of_Great_Britain" title="wikilink">Prince and Princess of Wales</a> to sponsor a public demonstration of the procedure. Six prisoners who had been condemned to death and were awaiting execution at <a href="Newgate_Prison" title="wikilink">Newgate Prison</a> were offered a full pardon for serving as the subjects of the public experiment. They accepted and were variolated in 1721. All the prisoners recovered from the procedure; to test its protective effect one of them, a nineteen-year-old woman, was ordered to sleep in the same bed as a ten-year-old smallpox victim for six weeks. She did not contract the disease.<a href="#fn85" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref85"><sup>85</sup></a></p>
<p>The experiment was repeated on eleven orphan children, all of whom survived the ordeal, and by 1722 even <a href="George_I_of_Great_Britain" title="wikilink">King George I</a>'s grandchildren had been inoculated.<a href="#fn86" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref86"><sup>86</sup></a> The practice was not entirely safe and caused many deaths. The procedure was expensive; some medical practitioners charged between &lt;U+00A3&gt;5 and &lt;U+00A3&gt;10 and some sold the method to other practitioners for fees between &lt;U+00A3&gt;50 to &lt;U+00A3&gt;100, or for half of the profits. Variolation became a lucrative franchise, but it remained beyond the means of many until the late 1770s.<a href="#fn87" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref87"><sup>87</sup></a> At the time nothing was known about viruses or the <a href="immune_system" title="wikilink">immune system</a>, and no one knew how the procedure afforded protection.<a href="#fn88" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref88"><sup>88</sup></a> <img src="Jenner_cartoon_from_1802.jpg" title="fig:A cartoon from 1802 depicting Jenner vaccinating &lt;U+2013&gt; the recipients are shown with cows emerging from their bodies." alt="A cartoon from 1802 depicting Jenner vaccinating &lt;U+2013&gt; the recipients are shown with cows emerging from their bodies." /></p>
<p><a href="Edward_Jenner" title="wikilink">Edward Jenner</a> (1749&lt;U+2013&gt;1823), a British rural physician, was variolated as a boy. He had suffered greatly from the ordeal but survived fully protected from smallpox. Jenner knew of a local belief that dairy workers who had contracted a relatively mild infection called <a href="cowpox" class="uri" title="wikilink">cowpox</a> were immune to smallpox. He decided to test the theory (though he was probably not the first to do so). On 14 May 1796 he selected &quot;a healthy boy, about eight years old for the purpose of inoculation for the Cow Pox&quot;.<a href="#fn89" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref89"><sup>89</sup></a> The boy, <a href="James_Phipps" title="wikilink">James Phipps</a> (1788&lt;U+2013&gt;1853), survived the experimental inoculation with cowpox virus and suffered only a mild fever. On 1 July 1796, Jenner took some &quot;smallpox matter&quot; (probably infected pus) and repeatedly inoculated Phipps's arms with it. Phipps survived and was subsequently inoculated with smallpox more than 20 times without succumbing to the disease. Vaccination &lt;U+2013&gt; the word is derived from the Latin <em>vacca</em> meaning &quot;cow&quot; &lt;U+2013&gt; had been invented.<a href="#fn90" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref90"><sup>90</sup></a> Jenner's method was soon shown to be safer than variolation, and by 1801 more than 100,000 people had been vaccinated.<a href="#fn91" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref91"><sup>91</sup></a></p>
<p>Despite objections from those medical practitioners who still practised variolation, and who foresaw a decline in their income, free vaccination of the poor was introduced in the UK in 1840. Because of associated deaths, variolation was declared illegal in the same year.<a href="#fn92" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref92"><sup>92</sup></a> Vaccination was made compulsory in England and Wales by the 1853 <a href="Vaccination_Act" title="wikilink">Vaccination Act</a>, and parents could be fined &lt;U+00A3&gt;1 if their children were not vaccinated before they were three months of age. The law was not adequately enforced, and the system for providing vaccinations, unchanged since 1840, was ineffective. After an early compliance by the population only a small proportion were vaccinated.<a href="#fn93" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref93"><sup>93</sup></a> Compulsory vaccination was not well received and, following protests, the Anti-Vaccination League and the Anti-Compulsory Vaccination League were formed in 1866.<a href="#fn94" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref94"><sup>94</sup></a><a href="#fn95" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref95"><sup>95</sup></a> Following the anti-vaccination campaigns there was a severe outbreak of smallpox in <a href="Gloucester" class="uri" title="wikilink">Gloucester</a> in 1895, the city's first in twenty years; 434 people died, including 281 children.<a href="#fn96" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref96"><sup>96</sup></a> Despite this, the British government conceded to the protesters and the Vaccination Act of 1898 abolished fines and made provision for a &quot;<a href="conscientious_objector" title="wikilink">conscientious objector</a>&quot; clause &lt;U+2013&gt; the first use of the term &lt;U+2013&gt; for parents who did not believe in vaccination.

<p><img src="Louis_Pasteur,_foto_av_F&lt;U+00E9&gt;lix_Nadar.jpg" title="fig:Louis Pasteur" alt="Louis Pasteur" /> Rabies is an often fatal disease caused by the infection of mammals with <a href="rabies_virus" title="wikilink">rabies virus</a>. In the 21st century it is mainly a disease that affects wild mammals such as foxes and bats, but it is one of the oldest known virus diseases: <em>rabies</em> is a <a href="Sanskrit" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sanskrit</a> word (<em>rabhas</em>) that dates from 3000 BC,<a href="#fn99" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref99"><sup>99</sup></a> which means &quot;madness&quot; or &quot;rage&quot;,<a href="#fn100" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref100"><sup>100</sup></a> and the disease has been known for over 4000 years.<a href="#fn101" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref101"><sup>101</sup></a> Descriptions of rabies can be found in <a href="Mesopotamia" title="wikilink">Mesopotamian</a> texts,<a href="#fn102" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref102"><sup>102</sup></a> and the <a href="Ancient_Greece" title="wikilink">ancient Greeks</a> called it &quot;lyssa&quot; or &quot;lytta&quot; meaning &quot;madness&quot;.<a href="#fn103" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref103"><sup>103</sup></a> References to rabies can be found in the <a href="Laws_of_Eshnunna" title="wikilink">Laws of Eshnunna</a>, which date from 2300 BC. <a href="Aristotle" class="uri" title="wikilink">Aristotle</a> (384&lt;U+2013&gt;322 BC) wrote one of the earliest undisputed descriptions of the disease and how it was passed to humans. <a href="Celsus" class="uri" title="wikilink">Celsus</a>, in the first century AD, first recorded the symptom called <a href="wikt:hydrophobia" title="wikilink">hydrophobia</a> and suggested that the saliva of infected animals and humans contained a slime or poison &lt;U+2013&gt; to describe this he invented the word &quot;virus&quot;.<a href="#fn104" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref104"><sup>104</sup></a> Rabies does not cause epidemics, but the infection was greatly feared because of its terrible symptoms, which include insanity, hydrophobia and death.<a href="#fn105" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref105"><sup>105</sup></a></p>
<p>In France during the time of Louis Pasteur (1822&lt;U+2013&gt;1895) there were only a few hundred rabies infections in humans each year, but cures were desperately sought. Aware of the possible danger, Pasteur began to look for the &quot;microbe&quot; in mad dogs.<a href="#fn106" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref106"><sup>106</sup></a> Pasteur showed that when the dried spinal cords from dogs that had died from rabies were crushed and injected into healthy dogs they did not become infected. He repeated the experiment several times on the same dog with tissue that had been dried for fewer and fewer days, until the dog survived even after injections of fresh rabies-infected spinal tissue. Pasteur had immunised the dog against rabies, as he later did with 50 more.<a href="#fn107" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref107"><sup>107</sup></a> <img src="Rabies_cartoon_circa_1826.jpg" title="fig:A cartoon from 1826 depicting a rabid dog on a London street" alt="A cartoon from 1826 depicting a rabid dog on a London street" /></p>
<p>Although Pasteur had little idea how his method worked, he tested it on a boy, <a href="Joseph_Meister" title="wikilink">Joseph Meister</a> (1876&lt;U+2013&gt;1940), who was brought to Pasteur by his mother on 6 July 1885. He was covered in bites, having been set upon by a mad dog. Meister's mother begged Pasteur to help her son. Pasteur was a scientist, not a physician, and he was well aware of the consequences for him if things were to go wrong. He nevertheless decided to help the boy and injected him with increasingly virulent rabid rabbit spinal tissue over the following 10 days.<a href="#fn108" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref108"><sup>108</sup></a> Later Pasteur wrote, &quot;as the death of this child appeared inevitable, I decided, not without deep and severe unease ... to try out on Joseph Meister the procedure, which had consistently worked on dogs&quot;.<a href="#fn109" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref109"><sup>109</sup></a> Meister recovered and returned home with his mother on 27 July. Pasteur successfully treated a second boy in October that same year; Jean-Baptiste Jupille (1869&lt;U+2013&gt;1923) was a 15-year-old shepherd boy who had been severely bitten as he tried to protect other children from a rabid dog.<a href="#fn110" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref110"><sup>110</sup></a> Pasteur's method of treatment remained in use for over 50 years.<a href="#fn111" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref111"><sup>111</sup></a></p>
<p>Little was known about the cause of the disease until 1903 when <a href="Adelchi_Negri" title="wikilink">Adelchi Negri</a> (1876&lt;U+2013&gt;1912) first saw microscopic lesions &lt;U+2013&gt; now called <a href="Negri_bodies" title="wikilink">Negri bodies</a> &lt;U+2013&gt; in the brains of rabid animals.<a href="#fn112" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref112"><sup>112</sup></a> He wrongly thought they were <a href="protozoa" title="wikilink">protozoan</a> parasites. <a href="Paul_Remlinger" title="wikilink">Paul Remlinger</a> (1871&lt;U+2013&gt;1964) soon showed by filtration experiments that they were much smaller than protozoa, and even smaller than bacteria.

<p>At the turn of the 20th century, evidence for the existence of viruses was obtained from experiments with filters that had pores too small for bacteria to pass through; the term &quot;filterable virus&quot; was coined to describe them.<a href="#fn114" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref114"><sup>114</sup></a> Until the 1930s most scientists believed that viruses were small bacteria, but following the invention of the <a href="electron_microscope" title="wikilink">electron microscope</a> in 1931 they were shown to be completely different, to a degree that not all scientists were convinced they were anything other than accumulations of toxic <a href="protein" title="wikilink">proteins</a>.<a href="#fn115" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref115"><sup>115</sup></a> The situation changed radically when it was discovered that viruses contain genetic material in the form of <a href="DNA" class="uri" title="wikilink">DNA</a> or <a href="RNA" class="uri" title="wikilink">RNA</a>.<a href="#fn116" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref116"><sup>116</sup></a> Once they were recognised as distinct biological entities they were soon shown to be the cause of numerous infections of plants, animals and even bacteria.<a href="#fn117" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref117"><sup>117</sup></a></p>
<p>Of the many diseases of humans that were found to be caused by viruses in the 20th century one, smallpox, has been eradicated.

<p>As humans have changed their behaviour during the course of history, so have viruses. In ancient times the human population was too small for pandemics to occur and, in the case of some viruses, too small for them to survive.

In developed countries children were mainly infected between the ages of three and five years old, but in developing countries half the children were infected before the age of two.<a href="#fn147" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref147"><sup>147</sup></a> In the US and the UK, there were regular annual or biannual epidemics of the disease, which depended on the number of children born each year.<a href="#fn148" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref148"><sup>148</sup></a> The current epidemic strain evolved in the first part of the 20th century &lt;U+2013&gt; probably between 1908 and 1943.<a href="#fn149" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref149"><sup>149</sup></a> <img src="Measles_incidence_England&amp;Wales_1940-2007.png" title="fig:Reported cases of measles in England and Wales from 1940 to 2007.

During the <a href="Great_Depression" title="wikilink">Great Depression</a> in the US before the Second World War the birth rate was low, and epidemics of measles were sporadic.

<p>HIV crossed the species barrier between chimpanzees and humans in Africa in the early decades of the 20th century. During the years that followed there were enormous social changes and turmoil in Africa. Population shifts were unprecedented as vast numbers of people moved from rural farms to the expanding cities, and the virus was spread from remote regions to densely populated urban conurbations. The incubation period for AIDS is around 10 years, so a global epidemic starting in the early 1980s is credible.<a href="#fn187" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref187"><sup>187</sup></a> At this time there was much scapegoating and stigmatisation.<a href="#fn188" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref188"><sup>188</sup></a> The &quot;out of Africa&quot; theory for the origin of the HIV pandemic was not well received by Africans, who felt that the &quot;blame&quot; was misplaced.

<p>The HIV pandemic has challenged communities and brought about social changes throughout the world. Opinions on sexuality are more openly discussed. Advice on sexual practices and drug use &lt;U+2013&gt; which were once taboo &lt;U+2013&gt; is sponsored by many governments and their healthcare providers.

This can cause huge economic losses and human tragedies. In <a href="Jordan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Jordan</a> during the 1970s, where tomatoes and <a href="cucurbitaceae" title="wikilink">cucurbits</a> (cucumbers, melons and gourds) were extensively grown, entire fields were infected with viruses.<a href="#fn252" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref252"><sup>252</sup></a> Similarly, in <a href="Ivory_Coast" title="wikilink">C&lt;U+00F4&gt;te d'Ivoire</a>, thirty different viruses infected crops such as <a href="legumes" class="uri" title="wikilink">legumes</a> and vegetables. In Kenya cassava mosaic virus, maize streak virus and groundnut viral diseases caused the loss of up to 70 percent of the crop.<a href="#fn253" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref253"><sup>253</sup></a> <a href="Cassava" class="uri" title="wikilink">Cassava</a> is the most abundant crop that is grown in eastern Africa and it is a staple crop for more than 200 million people.

The most important disease of cassava is caused by cassava mosaic virus, a <a href="geminiviridae" title="wikilink">geminivirus</a>, which is transmitted between plants by <a href="whitefly" title="wikilink">whiteflies</a>. The disease was first recorded in 1894 and outbreaks of the disease occurred in eastern Africa throughout the 20th century, often resulting in famine.<a href="#fn254" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref254"><sup>254</sup></a></p>
<p>In the 1920s the <a href="sugarbeet" class="uri" title="wikilink">sugarbeet</a> growers in the western US suffered huge economic loss caused by damage done to their crops by the <a href="leafhopper" class="uri" title="wikilink">leafhopper</a>-transmitted <a href="beet_curly_top_virus" title="wikilink">beet curly top virus</a>. In 1956, between 25 to 50 percent of the rice crop in Cuba and Venezuela was destroyed by <a href="rice_hoja_blanca_virus" title="wikilink">rice hoja blanca virus</a>. In 1958, it caused the loss of many rice fields in Columbia.

<p>Such disasters occurred when human intervention caused ecological changes by the introduction of crops to new <a href="Vector_(epidemiology)" title="wikilink">vectors</a> and viruses. Cacao is native to South America and was introduced to West Africa in the late 19th century.

The <a href="citrus_tristeza_virus" title="wikilink">citrus tristeza virus</a> (CTV) was introduced to South America from Africa between 1926 and 1930. At the same time, the aphid <em><a href="Toxoptera_citricida" title="wikilink">Toxoptera citricidus</a></em> was carried from Asia to South America and this accelerated the transmission of the virus. By 1950, more than six million citrus trees had been killed by the virus in <a href="S&lt;U+00E3&gt;o_Paulo" title="wikilink">S&lt;U+00E3&gt;o Paulo</a>, Brazil.<a href="#fn261" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref261"><sup>261</sup></a> CTV and citrus trees probably <a href="Coevolution" title="wikilink">coevolved</a> for centuries in their original countries.

<h3 id="west-nile-virus">West Nile virus</h3>

<p>West Nile virus, a flavivirus, was first identified in 1937 when it was found in the blood of a feverish woman. The virus, which is carried by mosquitoes and birds, caused outbreaks of infection in North Africa and the Middle East in the 1950s and by the 1960s horses in Europe fell victim. The largest outbreak in humans occurred in 1974 in <a href="Cape_Province" title="wikilink">Cape Province</a>, South Africa and 10,000 people became ill.<a href="#fn272" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref272"><sup>272</sup></a> An increasing frequency of epidemics and epizootics (in horses) began in 1996, around the Mediterranean basin, and by 1999 the virus had reached New York State. Since then the virus has spread throughout the US.<a href="#fn273" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref273"><sup>273</sup></a> In the US, mosquitoes carry the highest amounts of virus in late summer, and the number of cases of the disease increases in late August to early September. When the weather becomes colder, the mosquitoes die and the risk of disease decreases. In Europe, many outbreaks have occurred; in 2000 a surveillance programme began in the UK to monitor the incidence of the virus in humans, dead birds, mosquitoes and horses.<a href="#fn274" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref274"><sup>274</sup></a> The mosquito <em>(<a href="Culex_modestus" title="wikilink">Culex modestus</a>)</em> that can carry the virus breeds on the marshes of north <a href="Kent" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kent</a>.

<h3 id="nipah-virus">Nipah virus</h3>

<p>In 1997 an outbreak of respiratory disease occurred in Malaysian farmers and their pigs. More than 265 cases of encephalitis, of which 105 were fatal, were recorded.<a href="#fn276" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref276"><sup>276</sup></a> A new <a href="Paramyxoviridae" title="wikilink">paramyxovirus</a> was discovered in a victim's brain; it was named <a href="Nipah_virus" title="wikilink">Nipah virus</a>, after the village where he had lived. The infection was caused by a virus from fruit bats, after their colony had been disrupted by deforestation. The bats had moved to trees nearer the pig farm and the pigs caught the virus from their droppings.<a href="#fn277" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref277"><sup>277</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="viral-hemorrhagic-fevers">Viral hemorrhagic fevers</h3>

The Marburg virus attracted widespread press attention in April 2005 after an outbreak in <a href="Angola" class="uri" title="wikilink">Angola</a>. Beginning in October 2004 and continuing into 2005, there were 252 cases including 227 deaths, which makes the outbreak the world's worst epidemic of any kind of viral haemorrhagic fever.<a href="#fn278" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref278"><sup>278</sup></a> Ebola and Marburg viruses are transmitted to humans by monkeys,<a href="#fn279" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref279"><sup>279</sup></a> and <a href="Lassa_fever" title="wikilink">Lassa fever</a> by rats (<em><a href="Natal_multimammate_mouse" title="wikilink">Mastomys natalensis</a></em>).<a href="#fn280" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref280"><sup>280</sup></a> Zoonotic infections can be severe because humans often have no natural resistance to the infection and it is only when viruses become well-adapted to new host that their virulence decreases. Some zoonotic infections are often &quot;dead ends&quot;, in that after the initial outbreak the rate of subsequent infections subsides because the viruses are not efficient at spreading from person to person.<a href="#fn281" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref281"><sup>281</sup></a></p>
