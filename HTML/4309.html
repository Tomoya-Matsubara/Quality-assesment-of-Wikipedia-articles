The project was developed by the <a href="Port_Authority_of_New_York_and_New_Jersey" title="wikilink">Port Authority of New York and New Jersey</a>, which hired architect <a href="Minoru_Yamasaki" title="wikilink">Minoru Yamasaki</a> who came up with the specific idea for twin towers. After extensive negotiations, the <a href="New_Jersey" title="wikilink">New Jersey</a> and <a href="New_York" title="wikilink">New York State</a> governments, which oversee the Port Authority, agreed to support the World Trade Center project at the <a href="Radio_Row,_Manhattan" title="wikilink">Radio Row</a> site on the lower-west side of <a href="Manhattan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Manhattan</a>. To make the agreement acceptable to New Jersey, the Port Authority agreed to take over the bankrupt Hudson &amp; Manhattan Railroad (renamed as <a href="Port_Authority_Trans-Hudson" title="wikilink">PATH</a>), which brought commuters from New Jersey to the Lower Manhattan site.</p>
<p>The towers were designed as framed tube structures, which provided tenants with open floor plans, uninterrupted by columns or walls. This was accomplished using numerous closely-spaced perimeter columns to provide much of the strength to the structure, along with gravity load shared with the core columns. The <a href="elevator" class="uri" title="wikilink">elevator</a> system, which made use of <a href="sky_lobby" title="wikilink">sky lobbies</a> and a system of express and local elevators, allowed substantial floor space to be freed up for use as office space by making the structural core smaller. The design and construction of the World Trade Center twin towers involved many other innovative techniques, such as the <a href="slurry_wall" title="wikilink">slurry wall</a> for digging the <a href="Foundation_(architecture)" title="wikilink">foundation</a>, and <a href="wind_tunnel" title="wikilink">wind tunnel</a> experiments. Construction of the World Trade Center's North Tower began in August 1968, and the South Tower in 1969. Extensive use of prefabricated components helped to speed up the construction process. The first tenants moved into the North Tower in December 1970 and into the South Tower in January 1972. Four other low-level buildings were constructed as part of the World Trade Center in the 1970s, and a <a href="7_World_Trade_Center" title="wikilink">seventh</a> building was constructed in the mid-1980s.</p>

<p>In 1942, <a href="Austin_J._Tobin" title="wikilink">Austin J.

In 1946, the <a href="New_York_State_Legislature" title="wikilink">New York State Legislature</a> passed a bill that called for a &quot;world trade center&quot; to be established.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> The World Trade Corporation was founded, and a board was appointed by New York Governor <a href="Thomas_E._Dewey" title="wikilink">Thomas E.

The plans, made public in 1960, called for a World Trade Center to be built on a 13-acre (5.25 ha) site along the <a href="East_River" title="wikilink">East River</a>, from <a href="Old_Slip" title="wikilink">Old Slip</a> to <a href="Fulton_Street_(Manhattan)" title="wikilink">Fulton Street</a> and between <a href="Water_Street_(Manhattan)" title="wikilink">Water Street</a> and <a href="South_Street_(Manhattan)" title="wikilink">South Street</a>.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a><a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> The complex would include a 900-foot (275 m) long <a href="Convention_center" title="wikilink">exhibition hall</a>, and a 50&lt;U+2013&gt;70 story building, with some of its upper floors used as a hotel.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> Other amenities would include a theater, shops, and restaurants.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> The plan also called for a new <a href="security_(finance)" title="wikilink">securities</a> exchange building, which the Downtown-Lower Manhattan Association hoped would house the <a href="New_York_Stock_Exchange" title="wikilink">New York Stock Exchange</a>.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<p>David Rockefeller suggested that the Port Authority would be a logical choice for taking on the project.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> Rockefeller argued that the Trade Center would provide great benefits in facilitating and increasing volume of international commerce coming through the Port of New York.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> Given the importance of <a href="New_York_City" title="wikilink">New York City</a> in global commerce, Port Authority director Austin J.

<p><img src="Wtc_locator_map.png" title="fig:Location of World Trade Center and originally proposed site" alt="Location of World Trade Center and originally proposed site" width="300" /> The States of New York and New Jersey also needed to approve the project, given their control and oversight role of the Port Authority. Objections to the plan came from <a href="New_Jersey" title="wikilink">New Jersey</a> Governor <a href="Robert_B._Meyner" title="wikilink">Robert B.

<h3 id="controversy">Controversy</h3>
<p>Even once the agreement between the states of New Jersey, New York, and the Port Authority was finalized, the World Trade Center plan faced continued controversy. The site for the World Trade Center was the location of <a href="Radio_Row" title="wikilink">Radio Row</a>, which was home to hundreds of commercial and industrial tenants, property owners, small businesses, and approximately 100 residents.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> The World Trade Center plans involved evicting these business owners, some of whom fiercely protested the forced relocation.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> In June 1962, a group representing approximately 325 shops and 1,000 other affected small businesses filed an <a href="injunction" class="uri" title="wikilink">injunction</a>, challenging the Port Authority's power of <a href="eminent_domain" title="wikilink">eminent domain</a>.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> The dispute with local business owners worked its way through the court system, up to the <a href="New_York_Court_of_Appeals" title="wikilink">New York State Court of Appeals</a>, which in April 1963 upheld the Port Authority's right of eminent domain, saying that the project had a &quot;public purpose.&quot;<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a><a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> On <a href="November_12" title="wikilink">November 12</a> <a href="1963" class="uri" title="wikilink">1963</a>, the <a href="Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States" title="wikilink">United States Supreme Court</a> refused to accept the case.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a><a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> Under the state law, the Port Authority was required to assist business owners in relocating, though many business owners regarded what the Port Authority offered as inadequate.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a><a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> Questions continued while the World Trade Center was constructed, as to whether the Port Authority really ought to take on the project, described by some as a &quot;mistaken social priority.&quot;<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a></p>
<p>Private <a href="real_estate" title="wikilink">real estate</a> developers and members of the Real Estate Board of New York also expressed concerns about this much &quot;subsidized&quot; office space going on the open market, competing with the private sector when there was already a glut of vacancies.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a><a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> An especially vocal critic was Lawrence A.

<p>In January 1964, the Port Authority inked a deal with the State of New York to locate government offices at the World Trade Center.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> The Port Authority began signing commercial tenants in the spring and summer of 1964, including several banks.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> In 1965, the Port Authority signed the <a href="United_States_Customs_Service" title="wikilink">United States Customs Service</a> as a tenant.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a></p>
<p>A final obstacle for the Port Authority was getting approval from New York City Mayor <a href="John_Lindsay" title="wikilink">John Lindsay</a> and the <a href="New_York_City_Council" title="wikilink">New York City Council</a>, who raised concerns about the limited extent that the Port Authority involved the city in the negotiations and deliberations. Negotiations between The City of New York and the Port Authority were centered on tax issues. A final agreement was made on <a href="August_3" title="wikilink">August 3</a>, <a href="1966" class="uri" title="wikilink">1966</a>, that the Port Authority would make annual payments to the City, in lieu of taxes, for the portion of the World Trade Center leased to private tenants.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> In subsequent years, the payments would rise as the <a href="Property_tax" title="wikilink">real estate tax</a> rate increased.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="design">Design</h2>
<p>On <a href="September_20" title="wikilink">September 20</a> <a href="1962" class="uri" title="wikilink">1962</a>, the Port Authority announced the selection of <a href="Minoru_Yamasaki" title="wikilink">Minoru Yamasaki</a> as lead architect, and <a href="Emery_Roth" title="wikilink">Emery Roth &amp; Sons</a> as associate architects.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> Originally, Yamasaki submitted to the Port Authority a concept incorporating twin towers, but with each building only 80 stories tall. Yamasaki remarked that the &quot;obvious alternative, a group of several large buildings, would have looked like a housing project.&quot;<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> <img src="World_Trade_Center_Building_Design_with_Floor_and_Elevator_Arrangment.svg" title="fig:A typical floor layout and elevator arrangement of the WTC towers" alt="A typical floor layout and elevator arrangement of the WTC towers" width="250" /> To meet the Port Authority's requirement to build 10 million <a href="Square_foot" title="wikilink">square feet</a> (930,000 m&lt;U+00B2&gt;) of office space, the buildings would each need to be 110 stories tall. A major limiting factor in building heights is elevators; the taller the building, the more <a href="elevator" title="wikilink">elevators</a> are needed to service the building, requiring more space-consuming elevator banks.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> Yamasaki and the engineers decided to use a new system with sky lobbies, which are floors where people can switch from a large-capacity express elevator, which goes only to the sky lobbies, to a local elevator that goes to each floor in a section (the local elevators can be stacked within the same elevator shaft). Located on the 44th and 78th floors of each tower, the sky lobbies enabled the elevators to be used efficiently, while also increasing the amount of usable space on each floor from 62 to 75 percent by reducing the number of required elevator shafts.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> The World Trade Center towers were the second <a href="supertall" class="uri" title="wikilink">supertall</a> buildings to use sky lobbies, after the <a href="John_Hancock_Center" title="wikilink">John Hancock Center</a> in <a href="Chicago" class="uri" title="wikilink">Chicago</a>.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a> This system was inspired by the <a href="New_York_City_Subway" title="wikilink">New York City Subway</a> system, whose lines include local stations where local trains stop and express stations where all trains stop.<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> <img src="Wtc_model_at_skyscraper_museum.jpg" title="fig:Original architectural and engineering model" alt="Original architectural and engineering model" width="185" /> Yamasaki's design for the World Trade Center was unveiled to the public on <a href="January_18" title="wikilink">January 18</a> <a href="1964" class="uri" title="wikilink">1964</a>, with an eight-foot model.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a> The towers had a square plan, approximately 207 feet (63 m) in dimension on each side.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a> The buildings were designed with narrow office windows, only 18 <a href="inch" title="wikilink">inches</a> (45 <a href="Centimetre" title="wikilink">cm</a>) wide, which reflected on Yamasaki's <a href="Acrophobia" title="wikilink">fear of heights</a> and desire to make building occupants feel secure.<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a> Yamasaki's design called for the building facades to be sheathed in aluminum-alloy.<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a> In all, the World Trade Center complex contained six buildings within the 16 acre (6.5 ha) <a href="City_block#Superblock" title="wikilink">superblock</a>.</p>

<p>The structural engineering firm Skilling, Helle, Christiansen, <a href="Leslie_Robertson" title="wikilink">Robertson</a> worked to implement Yamasaki's design, developing the tube-frame structural system used in the buildings. The Port Authority's Engineering Department served as <a href="geotechnical_engineering" title="wikilink">foundation engineers</a>, Joseph R.

<h3 id="structural-design">Structural design</h3>
<p>As an interstate agency, the Port Authority was not subject to local laws and regulations of the City of New York, including <a href="building_code" title="wikilink">building codes</a>. Nonetheless, the Port Authority required architects and structural engineers to follow the New York City building codes. At the time when the World Trade Center was planned, new building codes were being devised to replace the 1938 version that was still in place. The structural engineers ended up following draft versions of the new 1968 building codes, which incorporated &quot;advanced techniques&quot; in <a href="building_design" title="wikilink">building design</a>.<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a></p>
<p>The World Trade Center towers included many <a href="structural_engineering" title="wikilink">structural engineering</a> innovations in <a href="skyscraper_design_and_construction" title="wikilink">skyscraper design and construction</a>, which allowed the buildings to reach new heights and become the <a href="List_of_tallest_buildings_in_the_world" title="wikilink">tallest</a> in the world. Traditionally, <a href="skyscraper" title="wikilink">skyscrapers</a> used a skeleton of <a href="column" title="wikilink">columns</a> distributed throughout the interior to support building loads, with interior columns disrupting the floor space. The tube-frame concept was a major innovation, allowing open floor plans and more space to rent. The buildings used high-strength, load-bearing perimeter <a href="steel" class="uri" title="wikilink">steel</a> columns called <a href="Truss#Vierendeel_truss" title="wikilink">Vierendeel trusses</a> that were spaced closely together to form a strong, rigid wall structure. There were 59 perimeter columns, narrowly spaced on each side of the buildings. These were designed to provide support for virtually all lateral loads (such as wind loads) and to share the gravity loads with the core columns.<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a> Structural analysis of major portions of the World Trade Center were computed on an <a href="IBM_1620" title="wikilink">IBM 1620</a>.<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a> <img src="Nistncstar1-1-fig2-4.png" title="fig:Typical WTC architectural floor plan" alt="Typical WTC architectural floor plan" /></p>
<p>The perimeter structure was constructed with extensive use of prefabricated modular pieces, which consisted of three columns, three stories tall, connected by <a href="wikt:spandrel" title="wikilink">spandrel</a> plates. The perimeter columns had a square cross section, 14 inches (36 cm) on a side, and were constructed of welded steel plate.<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a> The thickness of the plates and grade of <a href="structural_steel" title="wikilink">structural steel</a> varied over the height of the tower, ranging from 36,000 to 100,000 pounds per square inch<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a> (260 to 670 MPa). The strength of the steel and thickness of the steel plates decreased with height because they were required to support lesser amounts of building mass on higher floors.<a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a> The tube-frame design required 40 percent less structural steel than conventional building designs.<a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a> From the 7th floor to the ground level, and down to the foundation, the columns were spaced 10 feet (3 m) apart.<a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a> All columns were placed on <a href="bedrock" class="uri" title="wikilink">bedrock</a>, which, unlike that in Midtown Manhattan, where the bedrock is shallow, is at 65–85 feet (20–26 m) below the surface.<a href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a></p>
<p>The spandrel plates were welded to the columns to create the modular pieces off-site at the fabrication shop.<a href="#fn67" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a> The modular pieces were typically 52 inches (1.3 m) deep, and extended for two full floors and half of two more floors.<a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a> Adjacent modules were bolted together, with the splices occurring at mid-span of the columns and spandrels. The spandrel plates were located at each floor, transmitting <a href="shear_stress" title="wikilink">shear stress</a> between columns, allowing them to work together in resisting lateral loads. The joints between modules were staggered vertically, so the column splices between adjacent modules were not at the same floor.<a href="#fn69" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref69"><sup>69</sup></a></p>
<p>The building's core housed the elevator and utility shafts, restrooms, three stairwells, and other support spaces. The core of each tower was a rectangular area 87 by 135 feet (27 by 41 m), and contained 47 steel columns running from the bedrock to the top of the tower.<a href="#fn70" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a> The columns tapered with height, and consisted of welded box-sections at lower floors and rolled wide-flange sections at upper floors. The structural core in 1 WTC was oriented with the long axis east to west, while that of 2 WTC was oriented north to south. All elevators were located in the core. Each building had three stairwells, also in the core, except on the <a href="mechanical_floor" title="wikilink">mechanical floors</a> where they were located outside the core.<a href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a> <img src="Wtc_floor_truss_system.png" title="fig:Schematic of composite floor truss system" alt="Schematic of composite floor truss system" /> The large, column-free space between the perimeter and core was bridged by prefabricated floor trusses. The floors supported their own weight, as well as <a href="live_loads" title="wikilink">live loads</a>, provided lateral stability to the exterior walls, and distributed wind loads among the exterior walls. The floors consisted of 4 inch (10 cm) thick lightweight <a href="concrete" class="uri" title="wikilink">concrete</a> slabs laid on a fluted steel deck. A grid of lightweight bridging trusses and main trusses supported the floors. The trusses had a span of 60 feet (18.2 m) in the long-span areas and 35 feet (11 m) in the short span area.<a href="#fn72" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref72"><sup>72</sup></a> The trusses connected to the perimeter at alternate columns, and were on 6 foot 8 inch (2.03 m) centers. The top chords of the trusses were bolted to seats welded to the spandrels on the exterior side and a channel welded to the core columns on the interior side. The floors were connected to the perimeter spandrel plates with <a href="Viscoelasticity" title="wikilink">viscoelastic</a> dampers, which helped reduce the amount of sway felt by building occupants. The trusses supported a 4 inch thick (10 cm) lightweight concrete floor slab, with shear connections for composite action.<a href="#fn73" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref73"><sup>73</sup></a></p>
<p>Hat <a href="truss" title="wikilink">trusses</a> (or &quot;outrigger truss&quot;) located from the 107th floor to the top of the buildings were designed to support a tall communication <a href="Antenna_(radio)" title="wikilink">antenna</a> on top of each building.<a href="#fn74" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref74"><sup>74</sup></a> Only 1 WTC (north tower) actually had an antenna fitted, which was added in 1978.<a href="#fn75" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref75"><sup>75</sup></a> The truss system consisted of six trusses along the long axis of the core and four along the short axis. This truss system allowed some load redistribution between the perimeter and core columns and supported the transmission tower.</p>
<h3 id="wind-effects">Wind effects</h3>
<p>The tube frame design using steel core and perimeter columns protected with sprayed-on fire resistant material created a relatively lightweight structure that would sway more in response to the wind, compared to traditional structures such as the <a href="Empire_State_Building" title="wikilink">Empire State Building</a> that have thick, heavy <a href="masonry" class="uri" title="wikilink">masonry</a> for <a href="fireproofing" class="uri" title="wikilink">fireproofing</a> of steel structural elements.<a href="#fn76" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref76"><sup>76</sup></a> During the design process, <a href="wind_tunnel" title="wikilink">wind tunnel</a> tests were done at <a href="Colorado_State_University" title="wikilink">Colorado State University</a> and at the <a href="National_Physical_Laboratory,_UK" title="wikilink">National Physical Laboratory</a> in the <a href="United_Kingdom" title="wikilink">U.K.</a> to establish design wind pressures that the World Trade Center towers could be subjected to and structural response to those forces.<a href="#fn77" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref77"><sup>77</sup></a> Experiments also were done to evaluate how much sway occupants could tolerate. Subjects were recruited for &quot;free eye exams,&quot; while the real purpose of the experiment was to subject them to simulated building sway and find out how much they could comfortably tolerate.<a href="#fn78" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref78"><sup>78</sup></a> Many subjects did not respond well, experiencing <a href="dizziness" class="uri" title="wikilink">dizziness</a> and other ill effects. The chief engineer <a href="Leslie_Robertson" title="wikilink">Leslie Robertson</a> worked with Canadian engineer Alan G. Davenport to develop viscoelastic <a href="Damping" title="wikilink">dampers</a> to absorb some of the sway. These viscoelastic dampers, used throughout the structures at the joints between floor trusses and perimeter columns, along with some other structural modifications reduced the building sway to an acceptable level.<a href="#fn79" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref79"><sup>79</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="fire-protection">Fire protection</h3>
<p><a href="Fireproofing" title="wikilink">Sprayed-fire resistant materials</a> (SFRMs) were used to protect some structural steel elements in the towers, including all floor trusses and beams.<a href="#fn80" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref80"><sup>80</sup></a> <a href="Gypsum" class="uri" title="wikilink">Gypsum</a> <a href="wallboard" class="uri" title="wikilink">wallboard</a> in combination with SFRMs, or in some cases gypsum wallboard alone, was used to protect core columns.<a href="#fn81" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref81"><sup>81</sup></a> <a href="Vermiculite" class="uri" title="wikilink">Vermiculite</a> plaster was used on the interior-side and SFRMs on the other three sides of the perimeter columns for fire protection.<a href="#fn82" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref82"><sup>82</sup></a> The 1968 New York City building codes were more lenient in some aspects of fire protection, such as allowing three exit stairwells in the World Trade Center towers, instead of six as required under older building codes.<a href="#fn83" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref83"><sup>83</sup></a></p>
<p>The 1968 New York City building codes did not require <a href="Fire_sprinkler" title="wikilink">sprinklers</a> for <a href="high-rise" class="uri" title="wikilink">high-rise</a> buildings, except for underground spaces. In accordance with building codes, sprinklers were originally installed only in the underground parking structures of the World Trade Center.<a href="#fn84" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref84"><sup>84</sup></a> Following a major fire in February 1975, the Port Authority decided to start installing sprinklers throughout the buildings. By 1993, nearly all of Tower 2 [South Tower] and 85 percent of Tower 1 had sprinklers installed,<a href="#fn85" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref85"><sup>85</sup></a> and the entire complex was retrofitted by 2001.<a href="#fn86" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref86"><sup>86</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="construction">Construction</h2>
<p>In March 1965, the Port Authority began acquiring property at the World Trade Center site.<a href="#fn87" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref87"><sup>87</sup></a> The Ajax Wrecking and Lumber Corporation was hired for the <a href="demolition" class="uri" title="wikilink">demolition</a> work, which began on <a href="March_21" title="wikilink">March 21</a> <a href="1966" class="uri" title="wikilink">1966</a> to clear the site for construction of the World Trade Center.<a href="#fn88" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref88"><sup>88</sup></a></p>
<p><a href="Groundbreaking" class="uri" title="wikilink">Groundbreaking</a> was on <a href="August_5" title="wikilink">August 5</a> <a href="1966" class="uri" title="wikilink">1966</a>, marking the beginning of construction of the World Trade Center's foundations.<a href="#fn89" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref89"><sup>89</sup></a> The site of the World Trade Center was located on <a href="landfill" class="uri" title="wikilink">landfill</a>, with the bedrock located 65 feet (20 m) below.<a href="#fn90" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref90"><sup>90</sup></a> In order to construct the World Trade Center, it was necessary to build the &quot;bathtub&quot;, with the <a href="slurry_wall" title="wikilink">slurry wall</a> along the <a href="West_Side_Highway" title="wikilink">West Street</a> side of the site, to keep water from the <a href="Hudson_River" title="wikilink">Hudson River</a> out. This method was used in place of conventional dewatering methods because lowering the <a href="groundwater_table" title="wikilink">groundwater table</a> would cause large <a href="groundwater-related_subsidence" title="wikilink">settlements</a> of nearby buildings not built on <a href="deep_foundation" title="wikilink">deep foundations</a>.<a href="#fn91" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref91"><sup>91</sup></a> The slurry method involves digging a <a href="trench" class="uri" title="wikilink">trench</a>, and as <a href="excavation" class="uri" title="wikilink">excavation</a> proceeds, filling the space with a &quot;slurry&quot; mixture, composed of <a href="bentonite" class="uri" title="wikilink">bentonite</a> which plugs holes and keeps water out. When the trench was dug out, a steel cage was inserted, with concrete poured in, forcing the &quot;slurry&quot; out. The &quot;slurry&quot; method was devised by Port Authority chief engineer John M. Kyle, Jr. Towards the end of 1966, work began on building the slurry wall, led by <a href="Montreal" class="uri" title="wikilink">Montreal</a>-based Icanda, a subsidiary of an Italian engineering firm, Impresa Costruzioni Opere Specializzate (I.C.O.S.).<a href="#fn92" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref92"><sup>92</sup></a> It took fourteen months for the slurry wall to be completed, which was necessary before excavation of material from the interior of the site could begin.<a href="#fn93" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref93"><sup>93</sup></a> The original <a href="Downtown_Hudson_Tubes" title="wikilink">Hudson Tubes</a>, which carried PATH trains into Hudson Terminal, remained in service as elevated tunnels until 1971 when a new <a href="World_Trade_Center_(PATH_station)" title="wikilink">PATH station</a> was built.<a href="#fn94" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref94"><sup>94</sup></a> <img src="Wtc_panynj_1973.jpg" title="fig:World Trade Center in 1973" alt="World Trade Center in 1973" width="200" /> <a href="Construction" title="wikilink">Construction work</a> began on the North Tower in August 1968 with construction beginning on the South Tower by January 1969.<a href="#fn95" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref95"><sup>95</sup></a> In January 1967, $74 million in contracts were awarded to the <a href="PACCAR" title="wikilink">Pacific Car and Foundry Company</a>, <a href="Laclede_Steel_Company" title="wikilink">Laclede Steel Company</a>, <a href="U.S._Steel" title="wikilink">Granite City Steel Company</a>, and <a href="Karl_Koch_Steel_Consulting" title="wikilink">Karl Koch Erecting Company</a> to supply <a href="steel" class="uri" title="wikilink">steel</a> for the project.<a href="#fn96" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref96"><sup>96</sup></a> The Port Authority chose to use many different steel suppliers, bidding on smaller portions of steel, rather than buy larger amounts from a single source such as <a href="Bethlehem_Steel" title="wikilink">Bethlehem Steel</a> or <a href="U.S._Steel" title="wikilink">U.S. Steel</a> as a cost-saving measure.<a href="#fn97" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref97"><sup>97</sup></a> Karl Koch was also hired to do all the work of erecting the steel, and a contract for work on the aluminum facade was awarded to the <a href="Alcoa" title="wikilink">Aluminum Company of America</a>.<a href="#fn98" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref98"><sup>98</sup></a> <a href="Tishman_Realty_&amp;_Construction" title="wikilink">Tishman Realty &amp; Construction</a> was hired in February 1967 to oversee construction of the project.<a href="#fn99" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref99"><sup>99</sup></a></p>
