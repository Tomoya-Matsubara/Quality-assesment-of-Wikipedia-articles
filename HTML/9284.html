New York Metropolitan Museum of Art." width="280" />  In the 9th&lt;U+2013&gt;14th centuries, the northern <a href="Iran" title="wikilink">Iranian</a> regions of <a href="Tabaristan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tabaristan</a>, <a href="Daylam" class="uri" title="wikilink">Daylam</a> and <a href="Gilan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Gilan</a>, sandwiched between the <a href="Caspian_Sea" title="wikilink">Caspian Sea</a> and the <a href="Alborz" class="uri" title="wikilink">Alborz</a> range, came under the rule of a number of <a href="Alid" class="uri" title="wikilink">Alid</a> dynasties, espousing the <a href="Zaydi" class="uri" title="wikilink">Zaydi</a> branch of <a href="Shi&#39;ism" class="uri" title="wikilink">Shi'ism</a>. The first and most powerful Zaydi emirate was established in <a href="Tabaristan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tabaristan</a> in 864 and lasted until 928. It was interrupted by <a href="Samanid" class="uri" title="wikilink">Samanid</a> occupation in 900, but restored in 914 by another Alid branch. The second period of the Alid emirate was plagued by internal dissensions and power struggles between the two branches, and ended in the second conquest of the region by the Samanids in 928. Subsequently, some of the soldiers and generals of the Alavids joined the Samanids, among them the founder of the <a href="Ziyarid" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ziyarid</a> dynasty, <a href="Mardavij" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mardavij</a>, and <a href="&#39;Imad_al-Daula" title="wikilink">Ali</a>, Hassan and Ahmad, the sons of Buya and founders of the <a href="Buyid" class="uri" title="wikilink">Buyid</a> dynasty.</p>
<p>Local Zaydi rulers survived in Daylam and Gilan until the 16th century.</p>
