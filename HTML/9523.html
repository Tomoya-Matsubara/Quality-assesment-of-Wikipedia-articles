With <a href="John_Lennon" title="wikilink">John Lennon</a>, <a href="George_Harrison" title="wikilink">George Harrison</a> and <a href="Ringo_Starr" title="wikilink">Ringo Starr</a>, he gained worldwide fame as a member of <a href="The_Beatles" title="wikilink">The Beatles</a>, and his <a href="Lennon-McCartney" title="wikilink">collaboration with Lennon</a> is one of the most celebrated songwriting partnerships of the 20th century. Following <a href="The_Beatles&#39;_break-up" title="wikilink">the group's break-up</a>, he pursued a solo career, forming the group <a href="Wings_(band)" title="wikilink">Wings</a> with his first wife, <a href="Linda_McCartney" title="wikilink">Linda McCartney</a>, and singer-songwriter <a href="Denny_Laine" title="wikilink">Denny Laine</a>.</p>
<p>McCartney has been described by <em><a href="Guinness_World_Records" title="wikilink">Guinness World Records</a></em> as the &quot;most successful composer and recording artist of all time&quot;, with 60 <a href="Music_recording_sales_certification" title="wikilink">gold discs</a> and sales of over 100 million albums and 100 million <a href="Single_(music)" title="wikilink">singles</a>, and as the &quot;most successful songwriter&quot; in United Kingdom chart history.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> His Beatles song &quot;<a href="Yesterday" class="uri" title="wikilink">Yesterday</a>&quot; has been <a href="cover_version" title="wikilink">covered</a> by over 2,200 artists, more than any other song in history. Wings' 1977 release &quot;<a href="Mull_of_Kintyre_(song)" title="wikilink">Mull of Kintyre</a>&quot;, is one of the all-time best-selling singles in the UK. McCartney has written or co-written 32 songs that have reached number one on the <a href="Billboard_Hot_100" title="wikilink"><em>Billboard</em> Hot 100</a>, and  he has sold over 15.5 million <a href="RIAA" class="uri" title="wikilink">RIAA</a>-certified units in the United States.</p>
<p>McCartney has released a large catalogue of songs as a solo artist, and has composed classical and electronic music. He has taken part in projects to promote international charities related to such subjects as <a href="animal_rights" title="wikilink">animal rights</a>, <a href="seal_hunting" title="wikilink">seal hunting</a>, <a href="landmines" class="uri" title="wikilink">landmines</a>, <a href="vegetarianism" class="uri" title="wikilink">vegetarianism</a>, <a href="poverty" class="uri" title="wikilink">poverty</a> and <a href="music_education" title="wikilink">music education</a>. He has been married three times, and is the father of five children. </p>
<h2 id="childhood">Childhood</h2>

<p>McCartney was born on 18 June 1942, in <a href="Walton_Hospital" title="wikilink">Walton Hospital</a>, <a href="Liverpool" class="uri" title="wikilink">Liverpool</a>, England, where his mother, Mary (n&lt;U+00E9&gt;e Mohin), had qualified to practise as a nurse. His father, James (&quot;Jim&quot;) McCartney, was absent from his son's birth due to his work as a volunteer firefighter during World War II. McCartney has one younger brother, <a href="Mike_McGear" title="wikilink">Michael</a> (born 7 January 1944). The two boys were baptised in their mother's <a href="Catholic_Church" title="wikilink">Roman Catholic</a> faith, but religion was not emphasised in the household, as Jim was a <a href="Protestantism" title="wikilink">Protestant</a> turned <a href="agnostic" class="uri" title="wikilink">agnostic</a>, who felt Catholic schools sacrificed the education of their students for the sake of their religious teachings.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>McCartney attended Stockton Wood Road Primary School from 1947 until 1949, when he transferred to Joseph Williams Junior School due to overcrowding at Stockton.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> The following year he passed the <a href="11-plus" class="uri" title="wikilink">11-plus</a> exam, with only three others out of ninety examinees, gaining admission to the <a href="Liverpool_Institute_High_School_for_Boys" title="wikilink">Liverpool Institute</a>.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> In 1954, he met Harrison on the bus to the Institute from his suburban home in <a href="Speke" class="uri" title="wikilink">Speke</a>. Harrison had also passed the exam, meaning he could attend a <a href="grammar_school" title="wikilink">grammar school</a> rather than a <a href="secondary_modern" title="wikilink">secondary modern</a> school, where most pupils went until becoming eligible to work. The two soon became friends, although McCartney later admitted: &quot;I tended to talk down to him, because he was a year younger.&quot;<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>

<p>Mary was the family's primary wage earner, and her income as a <a href="Midwifery" title="wikilink">midwife</a> allowed the family to move into <a href="20&amp;nbsp;Forthlin_Road" title="wikilink">20&amp;nbsp;Forthlin Road</a> in <a href="Allerton,_Merseyside" title="wikilink">Allerton</a>, where they lived until 1964.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> She rode a bicycle to her patients; McCartney described an early memory of her leaving at &quot;about three in the morning [the] streets ... thick with snow&quot;. On 31 October 1956, when McCartney was fourteen, his mother died of an <a href="embolism" class="uri" title="wikilink">embolism</a>.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> McCartney's loss later became a point of connection with Lennon, whose mother, <a href="Julia_Lennon" title="wikilink">Julia</a>, had died when he was seventeen.</p>
<p>McCartney's father was a trumpet player and pianist who led Jim Mac's Jazz Band in the 1920s. He kept an <a href="upright_piano" title="wikilink">upright piano</a> in the front room, and he encouraged his sons to be musical. He gave McCartney a <a href="nickel" class="uri" title="wikilink">nickel</a>-plated <a href="trumpet" class="uri" title="wikilink">trumpet</a> for his fourteenth birthday, but when <a href="rock_and_roll" title="wikilink">rock and roll</a> became popular on <a href="Radio_Luxembourg_(English)" title="wikilink">Radio Luxembourg</a>, it was traded for a &lt;U+00A3&gt;15 <a href="Framus" class="uri" title="wikilink">Framus</a> Zenith (model 17) <a href="Steel-string_guitar" title="wikilink">acoustic guitar</a>, rationalising that it would be difficult to sing while playing a trumpet.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> He found it difficult to play guitar right-handed, but after noticing a poster advertising a <a href="Slim_Whitman" title="wikilink">Slim Whitman</a> concert and realising that Whitman also played left-handed, he reversed the order of the strings. McCartney wrote his first song, &quot;<a href="I_Lost_My_Little_Girl" title="wikilink">I Lost My Little Girl</a>&quot;, on the Zenith, and composed another early tune that would become &quot;<a href="When_I&#39;m_Sixty-Four" title="wikilink">When I'm Sixty-Four</a>&quot; on the piano. Against his father's advice, he took very few piano lessons, preferring to learn <a href="Learning_music_by_ear" title="wikilink">by ear</a>. He was heavily influenced by American <a href="rhythm_and_blues" title="wikilink">rhythm and blues</a> music, and <a href="Little_Richard" title="wikilink">Little Richard</a> was his schoolboy idol. &quot;<a href="Long_Tall_Sally" title="wikilink">Long Tall Sally</a>&quot; was the first song McCartney performed in public, at a <a href="Butlins" class="uri" title="wikilink">Butlins</a> holiday camp talent competition.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>

<h3 id="u20131960-the-quarrymen">1957&lt;U+2013&gt;1960: The Quarrymen</h3>

<p>At the age of fifteen, McCartney met Lennon and his band, the Quarrymen, at the St Peter's Church Hall f&lt;U+00EA&gt;te in <a href="Woolton" class="uri" title="wikilink">Woolton</a> on 6 July 1957. The Quarrymen played an even mix of rock and roll and <a href="skiffle" class="uri" title="wikilink">skiffle</a>, a type of <a href="popular_music" title="wikilink">popular music</a> with <a href="jazz" class="uri" title="wikilink">jazz</a>, <a href="blues_music" title="wikilink">blues</a> and <a href="folk_music" title="wikilink">folk</a> influences.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> The group invited McCartney to join soon afterwards as a rhythm guitarist, and he formed a close working relationship with Lennon. Harrison joined in 1958 as lead guitarist, followed by Lennon's art school friend <a href="Stuart_Sutcliffe" title="wikilink">Stuart Sutcliffe</a> on bass, in 1960. By May 1960 the band had tried several names, including Beatals, Johnny and the Moondogs and the Silver Beetles. They adopted the name the Beatles in August 1960, and recruited drummer <a href="Pete_Best" title="wikilink">Pete Best</a> shortly before a five-engagement residency in <a href="Hamburg" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hamburg</a>.</p>

<p><a href="Allan_Williams" title="wikilink">Allan Williams</a> informally represented the Beatles in 1960. His first booking for them was <a href="The_Beatles_in_Hamburg" title="wikilink">a series of performances</a> in Hamburg.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> In 1961, Sutcliffe left the band and McCartney reluctantly became their bass player.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> The Beatles recorded professionally for the first time in Hamburg, performing as the backing group for English singer <a href="Tony_Sheridan" title="wikilink">Tony Sheridan</a> on the <a href="Single_(music)" title="wikilink">single</a> &quot;<a href="My_Bonnie" title="wikilink">My Bonnie</a>&quot; as the Beat Brothers. This brought them to the attention of <a href="Brian_Epstein" title="wikilink">Brian Epstein</a>, a key figure in their subsequent development and success, who became their manager in January 1962. Starr replaced Best in August, and the group had their first hit, &quot;<a href="Love_Me_Do" title="wikilink">Love Me Do</a>&quot;, in October, becoming popular <a href="Beatlemania_in_the_United_Kingdom" title="wikilink">in the UK in 1963</a> and <a href="The_Beatles_in_the_United_States" title="wikilink">in the US</a> a year later. Their fans' hysteria became known as &quot;<a href="Beatlemania" class="uri" title="wikilink">Beatlemania</a>&quot;, and McCartney was sometimes referred to by the press as the &quot;cute Beatle&quot;.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<p>The McCartney composition &quot;<a href="Yesterday_(song)" title="wikilink">Yesterday</a>&quot;, featuring a <a href="string_quartet" title="wikilink">string quartet</a>, was released in 1965. Included on the <em><a href="Help!_(album)" title="wikilink">Help!</a></em> LP, the song was the group's first recorded use of <a href="classical_music" title="wikilink">classical music</a> elements and their first recording that involved only a single group member.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> &quot;Yesterday&quot; became the most covered song in popular music history.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> Later that year, during recording sessions for the album <em><a href="Rubber_Soul" title="wikilink">Rubber Soul</a></em>, McCartney began to supplant Lennon as the dominant musical force in the group. <a href="Musicology" title="wikilink">Musicologist</a> <a href="Ian_MacDonald" title="wikilink">Ian MacDonald</a> wrote, &quot;from [1965] ... [McCartney] would be in the ascendant not only as a songwriter, but also as instrumentalist, arranger, producer, and <em>de facto</em> musical director&quot;. Critics described <em>Rubber Soul</em> as a significant advance in the refinement and profundity of the group's music and lyrics.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> Later in life, both Lennon and McCartney would claim lead authorship for the song, &quot;<a href="In_My_Life" title="wikilink">In My Life</a>&quot;. McCartney said of the album, &quot;we'd had our cute period, and now it was time to expand.&quot; Recording engineer <a href="Norman_Smith_(record_producer)" title="wikilink">Norman Smith</a> stated that the <em>Rubber Soul</em> sessions exposed indications of increasing contention within the group: &quot;the clash between John and Paul was becoming obvious ... [and] as far as Paul was concerned, George [Harrison] could do no right&lt;U+2014&gt;Paul was absolutely finicky.&quot;</p>
<p>In 1966, they released the album <em><a href="Revolver_(album)" title="wikilink">Revolver</a></em>. Featuring sophisticated lyrics, studio experimentation and an expanded repertoire of <a href="Music_genre" title="wikilink">musical genres</a> ranging from innovative string arrangements to <a href="psychedelic_rock" title="wikilink">psychedelic rock</a>, the album marked an artistic leap for the Beatles. The LP's release was preceded by the single &quot;<a href="Paperback_Writer" title="wikilink">Paperback Writer</a>&quot;, the first of three consecutive McCartney <a href="A-side_and_B-side" title="wikilink">A-sides</a>.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> The Beatles produced a short promotional film for the song, and another for its B-side, &quot;<a href="Rain_(The_Beatles_song)" title="wikilink">Rain</a>&quot;. The films, described by Harrison as &quot;the forerunner of <a href="music_video" title="wikilink">videos</a>&quot;, aired on <em><a href="The_Ed_Sullivan_Show" title="wikilink">The Ed Sullivan Show</a></em> and <em><a href="Top_of_the_Pops" title="wikilink">Top of the Pops</a></em> in June 1966.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> <em>Revolver</em> also included McCartney's &quot;<a href="Eleanor_Rigby" title="wikilink">Eleanor Rigby</a>&quot;, which featured a <a href="Octet_(music)" title="wikilink">string octet</a>. According to Gould, the song is, &quot;A neoclassical tour de force ... a true hybrid, conforming to no recognizable style or genre of song&quot;.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> With the exception of some <a href="Backing_vocalist" title="wikilink">backing vocals</a>, the song included only McCartney's lead vocal and the strings arranged by producer <a href="George_Martin" title="wikilink">George Martin</a>.</p>
<p>The Beatles gave their final commercial concert at the end of their <a href="The_Beatles&#39;_1966_US_tour" title="wikilink">1966 US tour</a>. Later that year, McCartney was commissioned for what would be his first musical project apart from the group, a <a href="film_score" title="wikilink">film score</a> for the UK production <em><a href="The_Family_Way_(soundtrack)" title="wikilink">The Family Way</a></em>. The score was a collaboration with Martin, who used two McCartney themes to write thirteen variations.

<p>Upon the end of the band's performing career, McCartney sensed unease in the band and wanted them to maintain creative productivity. He pressed them to start a new project, which became <em><a href="Sgt._Pepper&#39;s_Lonely_Hearts_Club_Band" title="wikilink">Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band</a></em>, widely regarded as <a href="Rock_music" title="wikilink">rock</a>'s first <a href="concept_album" title="wikilink">concept album</a>.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> McCartney was inspired to create a new <a href="persona" class="uri" title="wikilink">persona</a> for the group, to serve as a vehicle for experimentation and to demonstrate to their fans that the band had musically matured.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> As McCartney explained, &quot;We were fed up with being the Beatles. We really hated that fucking four little <a href="The_Beatles&#39;_influence_on_popular_culture#The_mop-top_haircut" title="wikilink">mop-top</a> approach. We were not boys, we were men ... and [we] thought of ourselves as artists rather than just performers.&quot;</p>
<p>Starting in November 1966, the band adopted an experimental attitude during recording sessions. According to engineer <a href="Geoff_Emerick" title="wikilink">Geoff Emerick</a>, &quot;The Beatles were looking to go out on a limb, both musically and sonically ... we were utilising a lot of <a href="Magnetic_tape" title="wikilink">tape</a> <a href="Pitch_control" title="wikilink">varispeeding</a> and other manipulation techniques ... <a href="Dynamic_range_compression#Limiting" title="wikilink">limiters</a> and ... effects like <a href="flanging" class="uri" title="wikilink">flanging</a> and <a href="Automatic_double_tracking" title="wikilink">ADT</a>.&quot;<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> Their recording of &quot;<a href="A_Day_in_the_Life" title="wikilink">A Day in the Life</a>&quot; required a forty-piece <a href="orchestra" class="uri" title="wikilink">orchestra</a>, which Martin and McCartney took turns <a href="conducting" class="uri" title="wikilink">conducting</a>.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> The sessions produced the <a href="double_A-side" title="wikilink">double A-side</a> single &quot;<a href="Strawberry_Fields_Forever" title="wikilink">Strawberry Fields Forever</a>&quot;/&quot;<a href="Penny_Lane" title="wikilink">Penny Lane</a>&quot; in February 1967, and the LP followed in June. McCartney's &quot;<a href="She&#39;s_Leaving_Home" title="wikilink">She's Leaving Home</a>&quot; was an orchestral pop song. MacDonald described the track as &quot;[among] the finest work on <em>Sgt. Pepper</em> &lt;U+2014&gt; imperishable popular art of its time.&quot; The cover was based on an ink drawing by McCartney, which depicted all four Beatles standing in front of a wall featuring framed images of their heroes.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a></p>

<p>Epstein's death in August 1967 created a void, and the group was left perplexed and concerned about their future. McCartney, stepping in to fill that void, gradually became the <em>de facto</em> leader and business manager of the group Lennon had once led. His first creative suggestion after this change of leadership was to propose that the band move forward on their plans to produce a film for television, which was to become <em><a href="Magical_Mystery_Tour_(film)" title="wikilink">Magical Mystery Tour</a></em>. The project was &quot;an administrative nightmare throughout&quot;, according to Beatles' historian <a href="Mark_Lewisohn" title="wikilink">Mark Lewisohn</a>. McCartney largely directed the film, which brought the group their first unfavourable critical response. The <a href="Magical_Mystery_Tour" title="wikilink">film's soundtrack</a> was more successful. Released in the UK as a six-track double <a href="extended_play" title="wikilink">extended play</a> disc (EP), the material was issued as an identically titled LP in the US, filled out with five of the band's recent singles. The only Capitol compilation later included in the group's official canon of studio albums, the <em>Magical Mystery Tour</em> LP achieved $8 million in sales within three weeks of the release, higher initial sales than any other Capitol LP up to that point.</p>
<p>In January 1968, the group were filmed for a <a href="Trailer_(promotion)" title="wikilink">promotional trailer</a> to advertise the animated film <em><a href="Yellow_Submarine_(film)" title="wikilink">Yellow Submarine</a></em>, which was loosely based on the imaginary world evoked by McCartney's 1966 <a href="Yellow_Submarine_(song)" title="wikilink">composition</a>. Though the film was generally admired by critics for its visual style, humour and music, the <a href="Yellow_Submarine_(album)" title="wikilink">soundtrack album</a> that was issued seven months later received a less enthusiastic response.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> By late 1968, relations within the group were deteriorating. The tension grew while recording <em><a href="The_Beatles_(album)" title="wikilink">The Beatles</a></em>, commonly known as <em>The White Album</em>. Matters worsened the following year during the <em><a href="Let_It_Be" title="wikilink">Let It Be</a></em> sessions, when McCartney was filmed lecturing the group: &quot;We've been very negative since Mr. Epstein passed away ... we were always fighting [his] discipline a bit, but it's silly to fight that discipline if it's our own&quot;.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a></p>
<p>McCartney married <a href="Linda_McCartney" title="wikilink">Linda Eastman</a> in March 1969, and five months later the couple had their first child, <a href="Mary_McCartney" title="wikilink">Mary</a>, who was named after McCartney's late mother.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a></p>
<p>For the band's last recorded album, <em><a href="Abbey_Road" title="wikilink">Abbey Road</a></em>, Martin suggested &quot;a continuously moving piece of music&quot;; urging the group to think <a href="Symphony" title="wikilink">symphonically</a>. McCartney agreed, but Lennon did not. They eventually agreed upon McCartney's suggested compromise, featuring individual songs on side one, and a long <a href="Medley_(music)" title="wikilink">medley</a> on side 2.</p>
<p>By 1970, in the midst of business disagreements, McCartney was pitted against his bandmates, leading him to announce his exit on 10 April.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> He filed suit for the group's formal dissolution on 31 December 1970. More legal disputes followed, as McCartney's attorneys, his in-laws <a href="Lee_Eastman" title="wikilink">John and Lee Eastman</a>, fought Lennon, Harrison and Starr's business manager, <a href="Allen_Klein" title="wikilink">Allen Klein</a>, over royalties and creative control. The band was legally dissolved in an English court on 9 January 1975, though sporadic lawsuits against their record company <a href="EMI" class="uri" title="wikilink">EMI</a>, Klein and each other persisted until 1989.</p>

<p>After the Beatles' break-up in 1970, McCartney continued his musical career with his first solo release, <em><a href="McCartney_(album)" title="wikilink">McCartney</a></em>, a US number-one album. Apart from some vocal contributions from Linda, <em>McCartney</em> is a one-man album, with McCartney providing compositions, instrumentation and vocals.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> In 1971, he collaborated with Linda and drummer <a href="Denny_Seiwell" title="wikilink">Denny Seiwell</a> on a second album, <em><a href="Ram_(album)" title="wikilink">Ram</a></em>. A UK number one and a US top five, <em>Ram</em> included the co-written US number-one <a href="hit_single" title="wikilink">hit single</a> &quot;<a href="Uncle_Albert/Admiral_Halsey" title="wikilink">Uncle Albert/Admiral Halsey</a>&quot;.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> Later that year, the McCartneys and Seiwell were joined by <a href="The_Moody_Blues" title="wikilink">ex-Moody Blues</a> guitarist Denny Laine to form the group <a href="Wings_(band)" title="wikilink">Wings</a>. McCartney had this to say on the band's formation: &quot;Wings was always a difficult idea ... any group having to follow [the Beatles'] success would have a hard job ... I found myself in that very position. However, it was a choice between going on or finishing, and I loved music too much to think of stopping.&quot; In September 1971, the McCartneys had a <a href="Stella_McCartney" title="wikilink">second child</a>, named in honour of Linda's grandmothers, who were both named Stella.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a></p>
<p>Following the addition of guitarist <a href="Henry_McCullough" title="wikilink">Henry McCullough</a>, Wings' first concert tour began in 1972 with a d&lt;U+00E9&gt;but performance in front of an audience of seven hundred at the <a href="University_of_Nottingham" title="wikilink">University of Nottingham</a>. Ten more dates followed as they travelled across the UK in a van during an unannounced <a href="Wings_University_Tour" title="wikilink">tour of universities</a>, during which the band stayed in modest accommodation and received pay in <a href="coin" title="wikilink">coinage</a> collected from students, while avoiding Beatles songs during their performances.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> A seven-week, <a href="Wings_Over_Europe_Tour" title="wikilink">25-show tour</a> of Europe followed, during which the band played solely Wings and McCartney solo material with the exception of a few covers, including the Little Richard hit &quot;Long Tall Sally&quot;, the only song McCartney played during the tour that had previously been recorded by the Beatles. McCartney wanted the tour to avoid large venues; most of the small halls they played had capacities of fewer than 3,000 people. Of his first two post-Beatles tours, McCartney said, &quot;The main thing I didn't want was to come on stage, faced with the whole torment of five rows of press people with little pads, all looking at me and saying, 'Oh well, he is not as good as he was.' So we decided to go out on that university tour which made me less nervous ... by the end of that tour I felt ready for something else, so we went into Europe.&quot;</p>

<h2 id="musicianship">Musicianship</h2>
<p>As a musician, McCartney is largely self-taught. <a href="Musicology" title="wikilink">Musicologist</a> <a href="Ian_MacDonald" title="wikilink">Ian MacDonald</a> described his approach as &quot;by nature drawn to music's formal aspects yet wholly untutored ...

<h3 id="bass-guitar">Bass guitar</h3>
<p>McCartney's skill as a bass player has been acknowledged by other <a href="bassist" title="wikilink">bassists</a>, including <a href="Sting_(musician)" title="wikilink">Sting</a>, <a href="Dr._Dre" title="wikilink">Dr. Dre</a> bassist <a href="Mike_Elizondo" title="wikilink">Mike Elizondo</a>, and <a href="Colin_Moulding" title="wikilink">Colin Moulding</a> of <a href="XTC" class="uri" title="wikilink">XTC</a>. McCartney is known to play using a <a href="plectrum" class="uri" title="wikilink">plectrum</a> or <a href="Guitar_pick" title="wikilink">pick</a> almost exclusively, only occasionally changing to fingerstyle. He does not use <a href="Slapping" title="wikilink">slapping or muting</a> techniques. He was strongly influenced by <a href="Motown" class="uri" title="wikilink">Motown</a>, in particular by <a href="James_Jamerson" title="wikilink">James Jamerson</a>, whom McCartney called a hero for his <a href="Melody" title="wikilink">melodic</a> style. He was also influenced by <a href="Brian_Wilson" title="wikilink">Brian Wilson</a> &quot;because he went to very unusual places&quot;. Another favourite bassist is <a href="Stanley_Clarke" title="wikilink">Stanley Clarke</a>.<a href="#fn84" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref84"><sup>84</sup></a></p>

<p>During McCartney's early years with the Beatles, he primarily used a <a href="H&lt;U+00F6&gt;fner_500/1" title="wikilink">H&lt;U+00F6&gt;fner 500/1</a> bass, though in 1965 he began sporadically using a <a href="Rickenbacker_4001" title="wikilink">Rickenbacker 4001S</a> for recording. While typically using <a href="Vox_(musical_equipment)" title="wikilink">Vox amplifiers</a>, by 1967 he had also begun using a <a href="Fender_Bassman" title="wikilink">Fender Bassman</a> for amplification.<a href="#fn85" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref85"><sup>85</sup></a> During the late 1980s and early 1990s, he used a <a href="Wal_(bass)" title="wikilink">Wal 5-String</a>, which he said made him play more thick-sounding <a href="bassline" title="wikilink">basslines</a>, in contrast to the much lighter H&lt;U+00F6&gt;fner, which inspired him to play more sensitively, something he considers fundamental to his playing style. He changed back to the H&lt;U+00F6&gt;fner around 1990 for that reason. He uses <a href="Mesa_Boogie#Bass_amps" title="wikilink">Mesa Boogie</a> bass amplifiers while performing live.</p>
<p>MacDonald identified &quot;<a href="She&#39;s_a_Woman" title="wikilink">She's a Woman</a>&quot; as the point when McCartney's bass playing began to evolve dramatically, and Beatles biographer Chris Ingham singled out <em>Rubber Soul</em> as the moment when McCartney's playing exhibited significant progress, particularly on &quot;<a href="The_Word_(song)" title="wikilink">The Word</a>&quot;.<a href="#fn86" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref86"><sup>86</sup></a> Bacon and Morgan agreed, calling McCartney's <a href="Groove_(music)" title="wikilink">groove</a> on the track &quot;a high point in pop bass playing and ... the first proof on a recording of his serious technical ability on the instrument.&quot;<a href="#fn87" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref87"><sup>87</sup></a> MacDonald inferred the influence of <a href="James_Brown" title="wikilink">James Brown</a>'s &quot;<a href="Papa&#39;s_Got_a_Brand_New_Bag" title="wikilink">Papa's Got a Brand New Bag</a>&quot; and Pickett's &quot;<a href="In_the_Midnight_Hour" title="wikilink">In the Midnight Hour</a>&quot;, American <a href="Soul_music" title="wikilink">soul</a> tracks from which McCartney absorbed elements and drew inspiration as he &quot;delivered his most spontaneous bass-part to date&quot;.</p>
<p>Bacon and Morgan described his bassline for the Beatles song &quot;<a href="Rain_(The_Beatles_song)" title="wikilink">Rain</a>&quot; as &quot;an astonishing piece of playing ... [McCartney] thinking in terms of both rhythm and 'lead bass' ... [choosing] the area of the neck ... he correctly perceives will give him clarity for melody without rendering his sound too thin for groove.&quot; MacDonald considered the track the Beatles' best <a href="A-side_and_B-side" title="wikilink">B-side</a>, stating that its &quot;clangorously saturated texture resonates around McCartney's [bassline]&quot;, which MacDonald described as &quot;so inventive that it threatens to overwhelm the track&quot;.

I was trying to emulate those <a href="Folk_music" title="wikilink">folk</a> players.&quot; He employed a similar technique for &quot;<a href="Jenny_Wren" title="wikilink">Jenny Wren</a>&quot;.

<p>While at school during the 1950s, McCartney thrived at art assignments, often earning top academic accolades for his visual work.

During the 1960s, he delved into the visual arts, explored experimental cinema, and regularly attended film, theatrical and classical music performances. His first contact with the London <a href="avant-garde" class="uri" title="wikilink">avant-garde</a> scene was through artist <a href="John_Dunbar_(artist)" title="wikilink">John Dunbar</a>, who introduced McCartney to art dealer <a href="Robert_Fraser_(art_dealer)" title="wikilink">Robert Fraser</a>. At Fraser's flat he first learned about art appreciation, and during visits to Fraser's home, McCartney met <a href="Andy_Warhol" title="wikilink">Andy Warhol</a>, <a href="Claes_Oldenburg" title="wikilink">Claes Oldenburg</a>, <a href="Peter_Blake_(artist)" title="wikilink">Peter Blake</a>, and <a href="Richard_Hamilton_(artist)" title="wikilink">Richard Hamilton</a>. McCartney later purchased works by <a href="Magritte" class="uri" title="wikilink">Magritte</a>, using his painting of an apple for the <a href="Apple_Records" title="wikilink">Apple Records</a> logo. McCartney was involved in the renovation and publicising of the <a href="Indica_Gallery" title="wikilink">Indica Gallery</a> in Mason's Yard, London&lt;U+2014&gt;where Lennon first met <a href="Yoko_Ono" title="wikilink">Yoko Ono</a>. McCartney's involvement with the gallery brought him into contact with <a href="Barry_Miles" title="wikilink">Barry Miles</a>, whose underground newspaper, the <em><a href="International_Times" title="wikilink">International Times</a></em>, McCartney helped to start. Miles later wrote McCartney's official biography, <em><a href="Many_Years_From_Now" title="wikilink">Many Years From Now</a></em> (1997).</p>

<p>McCartney became interested in painting after watching artist <a href="Willem_de_Kooning" title="wikilink">Willem de Kooning</a> work in de Kooning's <a href="Long_Island" title="wikilink">Long Island</a> studio. McCartney took up painting in 1983, and he first exhibited his work in <a href="Siegen" class="uri" title="wikilink">Siegen</a>, Germany, in 1999. The 70-painting show featured portraits of Lennon, <a href="Andy_Warhol" title="wikilink">Andy Warhol</a> and <a href="David_Bowie" title="wikilink">David Bowie</a>. Though initially reluctant to display his paintings publicly, McCartney chose the gallery because events organiser Wolfgang Suttner showed genuine interest in McCartney's art. In September 2000, the first UK exhibition of McCartney's paintings opened, featuring 500 canvases at the <a href="Arnolfini" title="wikilink">Arnolfini Gallery</a> in <a href="Bristol" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bristol</a>, England.<a href="#fn107" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref107"><sup>107</sup></a> In October 2000, McCartney's art d&lt;U+00E9&gt;buted in his hometown of Liverpool. McCartney said, &quot;I've been offered an exhibition of my paintings at the Walker Art Gallery ... where John and I used to spend many a pleasant afternoon. So I'm really excited about it. I didn't tell anybody I painted for 15 years but now I'm out of the closet&quot;.<a href="#fn108" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref108"><sup>108</sup></a> McCartney is lead patron of the <a href="Liverpool_Institute_for_Performing_Arts" title="wikilink">Liverpool Institute for Performing Arts</a>, a school in the building formerly occupied by the <a href="Liverpool_Institute_for_Boys" title="wikilink">Liverpool Institute for Boys</a>.</p>
<p>When McCartney was a child, his mother read him poems and encouraged him to read books; his father was interested in <a href="crosswords" class="uri" title="wikilink">crosswords</a> and invited Paul and his brother Michael to solve them with him, so as to increase their &quot;word power&quot;, as McCartney said.<a href="#fn109" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref109"><sup>109</sup></a> In 2001, McCartney published <em>Blackbird Singing</em>, a volume of poems and lyrics to his songs for which he gave readings in Liverpool and New York City.<a href="#fn110" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref110"><sup>110</sup></a> In the foreword of the book, he explains: &quot;When I was a teenager ... I had an overwhelming desire to have a poem published in the school magazine. I wrote something deep and meaningful&lt;U+2014&gt;which was promptly rejected&lt;U+2014&gt;and I suppose I have been trying to get my own back ever since&quot;. In 2005, he collaborated with author <a href="Philip_Ardagh" title="wikilink">Philip Ardagh</a> and animator Geoff Dunbar to write <em><a href="High_in_the_Clouds" title="wikilink">High in the Clouds: An Urban Furry Tail</a></em>, which <em><a href="the_Guardian" title="wikilink">the Guardian</a></em> labelled an &quot;anti-capitalist children's book&quot;.<a href="#fn111" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref111"><sup>111</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1981, McCartney asked Geoff Dunbar to direct a short <a href="animated_film" title="wikilink">animated film</a> called <em><a href="Rupert_and_the_Frog_Song" title="wikilink">Rupert and the Frog Song</a></em>. McCartney was the writer and producer, and he also added some of the character voices. In 1992, he worked with Dunbar on an animated film about the work of French artist <a href="Honor&lt;U+00E9&gt;_Daumier" title="wikilink">Honor&lt;U+00E9&gt; Daumier</a>, which won them a <a href="BAFTA" class="uri" title="wikilink">BAFTA</a> award.<a href="#fn112" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref112"><sup>112</sup></a> In 2004, they worked together on the animated short film <em><a href="Tropic_Island_Hum" title="wikilink">Tropic Island Hum</a></em>.

<p>McCartney first used drugs in the Beatles' <a href="Hamburg" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hamburg</a> days, when they often used <a href="Preludin" class="uri" title="wikilink">Preludin</a> to maintain their energy while performing for long periods. <a href="Bob_Dylan" title="wikilink">Bob Dylan</a> introduced them to <a href="cannabis_(drug)" title="wikilink">marijuana</a> in a New York hotel room in 1964; McCartney recalls getting &quot;very high&quot; and &quot;giggling uncontrollably&quot;. His use of the drug soon became habitual, and according to Miles, the lyrics &quot;another kind of mind&quot; in &quot;<a href="Got_to_Get_You_into_My_Life" title="wikilink">Got to Get You into My Life</a>&quot; were written specifically as a reference to cannabis.<a href="#fn113" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref113"><sup>113</sup></a> During the filming of <em><a href="Help!_(film)" title="wikilink">Help!</a></em>, McCartney occasionally smoked a <a href="Joint_(cannabis)" title="wikilink">joint</a> in the car on the way to the studio during filming, and often forgot his lines. Director <a href="Richard_Lester" title="wikilink">Richard Lester</a> overheard two physically attractive women trying to cajole McCartney into using <a href="heroin" class="uri" title="wikilink">heroin</a>, but he refused. He was introduced to <a href="cocaine" class="uri" title="wikilink">cocaine</a> by Robert Fraser, and it was readily available during the recording of <em>Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band</em>. McCartney used the drug for about a year but stopped because of his dislike of the unpleasant melancholy he felt afterwards.</p>
<p>Initially reluctant to try <a href="Lysergic_acid_diethylamide" title="wikilink">LSD</a>, McCartney eventually did so in late 1966, and took his second &quot;<a href="Psychedelic_experience" title="wikilink">acid trip</a>&quot; in March 1967, with Lennon, after a <em>Sgt. Pepper</em> studio session.<a href="#fn114" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref114"><sup>114</sup></a> He later became the first Beatle to discuss the drug publicly, declaring, &quot;It opened my eyes... [and] made me a better, more honest, more tolerant member of society.&quot; He made his attitude about cannabis public in 1967, when he, along with the other Beatles and Epstein, added his name to a July advertisement in <em>The Times</em>, which called for its legalisation, the release of those imprisoned for possession, and research into marijuana's medical uses.</p>
<p>In 1972, McCartney was fined &lt;U+00A3&gt;1,000 by a Swedish court for cannabis possession. Soon after, Scottish police found marijuana plants growing on his farm, leading to his 1973 conviction for <a href="Cannabis_cultivation" title="wikilink">illegal cultivation</a> and a &lt;U+00A3&gt;100 fine. Due to his drug convictions, he was repeatedly denied a US visa until December 1973.<a href="#fn115" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref115"><sup>115</sup></a> He was again arrested for marijuana possession in 1975 in Los Angeles. Linda took the blame, and the charges were soon dismissed. In January 1980, when Wings flew to Tokyo for a tour of Japan, customs officials found approximately 8 ounces (200 g) of cannabis in his luggage, and he was arrested and taken to a local jail while the Japanese government decided what to do. After ten days, he was released without charge and deported. In 1984, while on holiday in <a href="Barbados" class="uri" title="wikilink">Barbados</a>, he was arrested for possession of marijuana and fined $200. Upon his return to England, he stated that &quot;cannabis is ... less harmful than rum punch, whiskey, nicotine and glue, all of which are perfectly legal ... I don't think ... I was doing anyone any harm whatsoever.&quot; In 1997, he spoke out in support of decriminalisation of the drug: &quot;People are smoking pot anyway and to make them criminals is wrong.&quot;</p>
<h3 id="activism">Activism</h3>
<p>Paul and Linda were <a href="vegetarians" class="uri" title="wikilink">vegetarians</a> for most of their 30-year marriage. They decided to stop eating meat after Paul saw lambs in a field as they were having a meal of lamb. Soon after, the couple became outspoken <a href="animal_rights" title="wikilink">animal rights</a> activists. In his first interview after Linda's death, he promised to continue working for animal rights, and in 1999 he spent &lt;U+00A3&gt;3,000,000 to ensure <a href="Linda_McCartney_Foods" title="wikilink">Linda McCartney Foods</a> remained free of <a href="Genetic_engineering" title="wikilink">genetically engineered</a> ingredients.<a href="#fn116" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref116"><sup>116</sup></a></p>

As McCartney explained, &quot;He wrote back very kindly, saying, my doctors tell me that I must eat meat. And I wrote back again, saying, you know, I don't think that's right ... I think he's now being told ... that he can get his protein somewhere else ... It just doesn't seem right &lt;U+2013&gt; the Dalai Lama, on the one hand, saying, 'Hey guys, don't harm sentient beings ...

He explained, &quot;The whole meditation experience was very good and I still use the mantra ... I find it soothing&quot;. In 2009, McCartney and Starr headlined a benefit concert at <a href="Radio_City_Music_Hall" title="wikilink">Radio City Music Hall</a>, raising three million dollars for the <a href="David_Lynch_Foundation" title="wikilink">David Lynch Foundation</a> to fund instruction in Transcendental Meditation for at-risk youth.<a href="#fn123" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref123"><sup>123</sup></a></p>

But after a concert at Wembley Arena I got a bit of a friendship with Kenny Dalglish, who had been to the gig and I thought 'You know what?

<h4 id="dot-rhone">Dot Rhone</h4>
<p>McCartney's first serious girlfriend in Liverpool was Dot Rhone, whom he met at the <a href="The_Casbah_Coffee_Club" title="wikilink">Casbah club</a> in 1959. According to Spitz, Rhone felt McCartney had a compulsion to control situations, choosing clothes and make-up for her, encouraging her to grow her hair out like <a href="Brigitte_Bardot" title="wikilink">Brigitte Bardot</a>'s and at least once insisting she have it re-styled, to disappointing effect. When McCartney first went to Hamburg with the Beatles, he wrote to Rhone regularly, and she accompanied <a href="Cynthia_Lennon" title="wikilink">Cynthia Lennon</a> to Hamburg when they played there again in 1962. The couple had a two-and-a-half-year relationship, and were due to marry until Rhone's miscarriage; according to Spitz, McCartney, now &quot;free of obligation&quot;, ended the engagement.</p>
<h4 id="jane-asher">Jane Asher</h4>
<p>McCartney first met British actress <a href="Jane_Asher" title="wikilink">Jane Asher</a> on 18 April 1963, when a photographer asked them to pose at a Beatles performance at the <a href="Royal_Albert_Hall" title="wikilink">Royal Albert Hall</a> in London. The two began a relationship, and in November of that year he took up residence with Asher at her parents' home at 57 Wimpole Street, London.

<p><a href="Linda_McCartney" title="wikilink">Linda Eastman</a> was a music fan who once commented, &quot;all my teen years were spent with an ear to the radio.&quot; At times, she skipped school to see artists such as <a href="Fabian_(entertainer)" title="wikilink">Fabian</a>, <a href="Bobby_Darin" title="wikilink">Bobby Darin</a> and <a href="Chuck_Berry" title="wikilink">Chuck Berry</a>. She became a popular photographer with several rock groups, including <a href="the_Jimi_Hendrix_Experience" title="wikilink">the Jimi Hendrix Experience</a>, the Grateful Dead, the Doors and the Beatles, whom she first met at Shea Stadium in 1966. She commented, &quot;It was John who interested me at the start. He was my Beatle hero. But when I met him the fascination faded fast and I found it was Paul I liked.&quot; The pair first properly met in 1967 at a <a href="Georgie_Fame" title="wikilink">Georgie Fame</a> concert at <a href="The_Bag_O&#39;Nails" title="wikilink">The Bag O'Nails</a> club, during her UK assignment to photograph rock musicians in London. As Paul remembers, &quot;The night Linda and I met, I spotted her across a crowded club, and although I would normally have been nervous chatting her up, I realised I had to ... Pushiness worked for me that night!&quot;<a href="#fn128" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref128"><sup>128</sup></a> Linda said this about their meeting: &quot;I was quite shameless really. I was with somebody else [that night] ... and I saw Paul at the other side of the room. He looked so beautiful that I made up my mind I would have to pick him up.&quot; The pair were married in 1969. About their relationship, Paul said, &quot;We had a lot of fun together ... just the nature of how we are, our favourite thing really is to just hang, to have fun. And Linda's very big on just following the moment.&quot; He added, &quot;We were crazy. We had a big argument the night before we got married and it was nearly called off ... [it's] miraculous that we made it. But we did.&quot;</p>
<p>The two collaborated musically after the Beatles' break-up, forming Wings in 1971. They faced derision from some fans and critics, who questioned her inclusion. She was nervous about performing with Paul, who explained, &quot;she conquered those nerves, got on with it and was really gutsy.&quot; Paul defended her musical ability: &quot;I taught Linda the basics of the keyboard ... She took a couple lessons and learned some bluesy things ... she did very well and made it look easier than it was ... The critics would say, 'She's not really playing' or 'Look at her&lt;U+2014&gt;she's playing with one finger.' But what they didn't know is that sometimes she was playing a thing called a <a href="Minimoog" class="uri" title="wikilink">Minimoog</a>, which could only be played with one finger. It was <a href="Monophonic_synthesizer" title="wikilink">monophonic</a>.&quot; He went on to say, &quot;We thought we were in it for the fun ... it was just something we wanted to do, so if we got it wrong &lt;U+2013&gt; big deal. We didn't have to justify ourselves.&quot; Former Wings guitarist McCullough said of collaborating with Linda, &quot;trying to get things together with a learner in the group didn't work as far as I was concerned.&quot;</p>
<p>They had four children&lt;U+2014&gt;Linda's daughter <a href="Heather_McCartney" title="wikilink">Heather</a> (legally adopted by Paul), <a href="Mary_McCartney" title="wikilink">Mary</a>, <a href="Stella_McCartney" title="wikilink">Stella</a> and <a href="James_McCartney" title="wikilink">James</a>&lt;U+2014&gt;and remained married until Linda's death from breast cancer in 1998. After her death, Paul stated in <em><a href="Daily_Mail" title="wikilink">The Daily Mail</a></em>, &quot;I got a counsellor because I knew that I would need some help. He was great, particularly in helping me get rid of my guilt [about wishing I'd been] perfect all the time ... a real bugger. But then I thought, hang on a minute. We're just human. That was the beautiful thing about our marriage. We were just a boyfriend and girlfriend having babies.&quot;</p>

<p>In 2002, McCartney married <a href="Heather_Mills" title="wikilink">Heather Mills</a>, a former model and anti-<a href="land_mine" title="wikilink">landmines</a> campaigner. In 2003, the couple had a child, Beatrice Milly, who was named in honour of Mills' late mother, and one of McCartney's aunts. They separated in April 2006, and divorced acrimoniously in March 2008.<a href="#fn129" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref129"><sup>129</sup></a> In 2004 he commented on media animosity toward his partners: &quot;[the British public] didn't like me giving up on Jane Asher&quot; ... &quot;I married [Linda], a New York divorcee with a child, and at the time they didn't like that&quot;.<a href="#fn130" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref130"><sup>130</sup></a></p>

In later years, the two grew apart. While McCartney would often phone, he was apprehensive about the reception he would receive, as during one call when he was told, &quot;You're all pizza and fairytales!&quot; In an effort to avoid talking only about business, they often spoke of cats, babies or baking bread.</p>
<p>On 24 April 1976, the two were watching an episode of <em><a href="Saturday_Night_Live" title="wikilink">Saturday Night Live</a></em> together at Lennon's home in New York City, during which <a href="Lorne_Michaels" title="wikilink">Lorne Michaels</a> made a $3,000 cash offer for the Beatles to reunite.

That evening, as he was leaving an <a href="Oxford_Street" title="wikilink">Oxford Street</a> recording studio, he was surrounded by reporters who asked him for a reaction. He responded &quot;It's a drag&quot;, and was criticised for what appeared to be a superficial response. He later explained, &quot;When John was killed somebody stuck a microphone at me and said: 'What do you think about it?' I said, 'It's a dra-a-ag' and meant it with every inch of melancholy I could muster. When you put that in print it says, 'McCartney in London today when asked for a comment on his dead friend said, &quot;It's a drag&quot;.' It seemed a very flippant comment to make.&quot; He described his first exchange with Ono after the murder, and his last conversation with Lennon:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I talked to Yoko the day after he was killed and the first thing she said was, &quot;John was really fond of you.&quot; The last telephone conversation I had with him we were still the best of mates. He was always a very warm guy, John. His bluff was all on the surface. He used to take his glasses down, those granny glasses, and say, &quot;it's only me.&quot; They were like a wall, you know? A shield. Those are the moments I treasure.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In 1983, McCartney said, &quot;I would not have been as typically human and standoffish as I was if I knew John was going to die. I would have made more of an effort to try and get behind his &quot;mask&quot; and have a better relationship with him.&quot; He said that he went home that night, watched the news on television with his children and cried most of the evening. In 1997, he admitted the ex-Beatles were nervous at the time that they might also be murdered. He told <em>Mojo</em> magazine in 2002 that Lennon was his greatest hero. In June 1981, six months after the murder, McCartney sang backup on Harrison's tribute to their ex-bandmate, &quot;<a href="All_Those_Years_Ago" title="wikilink">All Those Years Ago</a>&quot;, which featured Starr on drums. McCartney released &quot;<a href="Here_Today_(Paul_McCartney_song)" title="wikilink">Here Today</a>&quot; in 1982, a song Everett describes as &quot;a haunting tribute&quot; to McCartney's friendship with Lennon.</p>
<h4 id="george-harrison">George Harrison</h4>
<p>Discussing his relationship with McCartney, <a href="George_Harrison" title="wikilink">Harrison</a> said, &quot;Paul would always help along when you'd done his ten songs&lt;U+2014&gt;then when he got 'round to doing one of my songs, he would help. It was silly. It was very selfish, actually ... There were a lot of tracks, though, where I played bass ... because what Paul would do&lt;U+2014&gt;if he'd written a song, he'd learn all the parts for Paul and then come in the studio and say (sometimes he was very difficult): &quot;Do this&quot;. He'd never give you the opportunity to come out with something.&quot;<a href="#fn136" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref136"><sup>136</sup></a></p>
<p>After Harrison's death in November 2001, McCartney issued a statement outside his home in St. John's Wood, calling him &quot;a lovely guy and a very brave man who had a wonderful sense of humour&quot;. He went on to say, &quot;We grew up together and we just had so many beautiful times together &lt;U+2013&gt; that's what I am going to remember. I'll always love him, he's my baby brother.&quot;<a href="#fn137" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref137"><sup>137</sup></a> On the first anniversary of his death, McCartney played Harrison's &quot;<a href="Something" class="uri" title="wikilink">Something</a>&quot; on a <a href="ukulele" class="uri" title="wikilink">ukulele</a> at the <a href="Concert_for_George" title="wikilink">Concert for George</a>. He also performed &quot;<a href="For_You_Blue" title="wikilink">For You Blue</a>&quot; and &quot;<a href="All_Things_Must_Pass_(song)" title="wikilink">All Things Must Pass</a>&quot;, and played the piano on <a href="Eric_Clapton" title="wikilink">Eric Clapton</a>'s rendition of &quot;<a href="While_My_Guitar_Gently_Weeps" title="wikilink">While My Guitar Gently Weeps</a>&quot;.</p>
<h4 id="ringo-starr">Ringo Starr</h4>
<p><a href="Ringo_Starr" title="wikilink">Starr</a> once described McCartney as &quot;pleasantly insincere&quot;, though the two generally enjoy each other's company, and at least once went on holiday together in Greece. Starr recalled, &quot;We couldn't understand a word of the songs the hotel band were playing, so on the last night Paul and I did a few rockers like &quot;<a href="What&#39;d_I_Say" title="wikilink">What'd I Say</a>&quot;. There was at times discord between them as well, particularly during sessions for <em>the White Album</em>. As Apple's <a href="Peter_Brown_(music_industry)" title="wikilink">Peter Brown</a> recalled, &quot;it was a poorly kept secret among Beatle intimates that after Ringo left the studio Paul would often dub in the drum tracks himself ... [Starr] would pretend not to notice&quot;. In August 1968, the two got into an argument over McCartney's critique of Starr's drum part for &quot;Back in the U.S.S.R.&quot;, which contributed to Starr temporarily leaving the band.<a href="#fn138" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref138"><sup>138</sup></a> He returned in September to find bouquets of flowers on his drum kit. Starr commented on working with McCartney: &quot;Paul is the greatest bass player in the world. But he is also very determined ... [to] get his own way ... [thus] musical disagreements inevitably arose from time to time.&quot;</p>
<p>McCartney and Starr collaborated on several post-Beatles projects starting in 1973, when McCartney contributed instrumentation and <a href="Backing_vocalist" title="wikilink">backing vocals</a> for &quot;Six O'Clock&quot;, a song McCartney wrote for Starr's album <em><a href="Ringo_(album)" title="wikilink">Ringo</a></em>. McCartney played a <a href="kazoo" class="uri" title="wikilink">kazoo</a> solo on another track from the album <em><a href="You&#39;re_Sixteen" title="wikilink">You're Sixteen</a></em>. In 1976, McCartney sang backing vocals on another song he wrote for Starr, &quot;Pure Gold&quot;, from <em><a href="Ringo&#39;s_Rotogravure" title="wikilink">Ringo's Rotogravure</a></em>. In 1981, McCartney produced and performed on three songs from Starr's <em><a href="Stop_and_Smell_the_Roses" title="wikilink">Stop and Smell the Roses</a></em>, two of which McCartney composed. Starr played drums and sang backing vocals on a song from McCartney's 1997 album, <em>Flaming Pie</em>. The pair collaborated again in 1998, on Starr's <em><a href="Vertical_Man" title="wikilink">Vertical Man</a></em>, which featured McCartney's backing vocals on three songs, and instrumentation on one. In 2009, the pair performed &quot;<a href="With_a_Little_Help_From_My_Friends" title="wikilink">With a Little Help From My Friends</a>&quot; at a benefit concert for the <a href="David_Lynch_Foundation" title="wikilink">David Lynch Foundation</a>.<a href="#fn139" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref139"><sup>139</sup></a> They collaborated on Starr's album, <em><a href="Y_Not" title="wikilink">Y Not</a></em>, in 2010. McCartney played bass on a track, and sang a <a href="duet" class="uri" title="wikilink">duet</a> with Starr on another.<a href="#fn140" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref140"><sup>140</sup></a></p>

<h3 id="achievements">Achievements</h3>
<p>McCartney was described by <em><a href="Guinness_World_Records" title="wikilink">Guinness World Records</a></em> as &quot;the Most Successful Composer and Recording Artist of All Time&quot;, with 60 gold discs and sales of 100 million albums, 100 million singles, and a writer's credit on forty-three songs that have sold over one million copies each. According to Guinness, he is &quot;the most successful songwriter&quot; in UK singles chart history and &quot;the most successful musician of all time&quot;. He has written or co-written &quot;188 charted records, of which 129 are different songs. Of these records, 91 reached the Top 10 and 33 made it to number 1. In total, the songs have spent 1,662 weeks in the charts (up to the beginning of 2007).&quot;</p>
<p>In the US, McCartney was included on 32 number-one singles as a songwriter or co-writer on the <em>Billboard</em> Hot 100: twenty with the Beatles; nine solo and/or with Wings; one as a co-writer of &quot;<a href="A_World_Without_Love" title="wikilink">A World Without Love</a>&quot;, a number-one single for <a href="Peter_and_Gordon" title="wikilink">Peter and Gordon</a>; one as a co-writer on <a href="Elton_John" title="wikilink">Elton John</a>'s cover of &quot;Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds&quot;; and one as a co-writer with Jackson on &quot;Say Say Say&quot;.<a href="#fn141" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref141"><sup>141</sup></a> , he has sold 15.5 million <a href="RIAA" class="uri" title="wikilink">RIAA</a> certified units in the United States.<a href="#fn142" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref142"><sup>142</sup></a></p>
<p>McCartney has been involved in more number ones in the UK than any other artist under a variety of credits, totalling twenty-four singles: seventeen with the Beatles, one solo, and one each with Wings, Stevie Wonder, <a href="Let_It_Be_(Ferry_Aid_song)" title="wikilink">Ferry Aid</a>, <a href="Band_Aid_(band)" title="wikilink">Band Aid</a>, <a href="Band_Aid_20" title="wikilink">Band Aid 20</a> and one with &quot;The Christians et al&quot;.<a href="#fn143" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref143"><sup>143</sup></a> He is the only artist to reach the UK number one as a <a href="Solo_(music)" title="wikilink">soloist</a> (&quot;Pipes of Peace&quot;), duo (&quot;Ebony and Ivory&quot; with Wonder), <a href="Trio_(music)" title="wikilink">trio</a> (&quot;Mull of Kintyre&quot;, Wings), quartet (&quot;She Loves You&quot;, the Beatles), quintet (&quot;Get Back&quot;, the Beatles with <a href="Billy_Preston" title="wikilink">Billy Preston</a>) and as part of a musical ensemble for charity (Ferry Aid).</p>
<p>&quot;Yesterday&quot; is the most covered song in history with more than 2,200 recorded versions, and according to the BBC, &quot;the track is the only one by a UK writer to have been aired more than seven million times on American TV and radio and is third in the all-time list ... [and] is the most played song by a British writer [last] century in the US&quot;.<a href="#fn144" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref144"><sup>144</sup></a> His 1968 Beatles composition, &quot;Hey Jude&quot;, is also a career highlight. It achieved the highest sales in the UK that year, and topped the US charts for nine weeks, longer than any other Beatles single. It was also the longest single released by the band, and at seven minutes eleven seconds, the longest ever number one to that point. &quot;Hey Jude&quot; is the best-selling Beatles single, achieving sales of over five million copies soon after its release.</p>
<p>In July 2005, he was involved with the fastest-released single in history, when his performance of &quot;Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot; with <a href="U2" class="uri" title="wikilink">U2</a> at <a href="Live_8" title="wikilink">Live 8</a> was released within forty-five minutes of its recording. Within hours of release, it achieved number one on the <a href="UK_Official_Download_Chart" title="wikilink">UK Official Download Chart</a>.</p>
