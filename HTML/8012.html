<p><strong>Anthony Martin</strong> (born <a href="August_24" title="wikilink">August 24</a>, <a href="1980" class="uri" title="wikilink">1980</a>) is a <a href="United_Kingdom" title="wikilink">British</a> professional <a href="basketball" class="uri" title="wikilink">basketball</a> player, currently plying his trade with the <a href="Plymouth_Raiders" title="wikilink">Plymouth Raiders</a> of the elite <a href="British_Basketball_League" title="wikilink">British Basketball League</a>.</p>
<p>The 6ft tall <a href="Point_guard" title="wikilink">point guard</a> began his career with the BBL Championship winning <a href="Chester_Jets" title="wikilink">Chester Jets</a> team of the <a href="British_Basketball_League_2004-05" title="wikilink">2004/05</a> season, making his debut in a home match against <a href="Sheffield_Sharks" title="wikilink">Sheffield Sharks</a> on <a href="October_1" title="wikilink">October 1</a>, <a href="2004" class="uri" title="wikilink">2004</a>. He also helped the team to the Play-off final that season, eventually losing to <a href="Newcastle_Eagles" title="wikilink">Newcastle Eagles</a>, 75-78.</p>
<p>By his second season, he had commanded a place in the starting five, and averging an impressive 66% on free-throws and 55% from the floor, whilst also tallying 7.38 points in 23.72 minutes-per-game. Sadly, Martin missed the <a href="British_Basketball_League_2006-07" title="wikilink">2006/07 season</a> through injury, but after fully recovering was announced as a suprise signing for the <a href="Plymouth_Raiders" title="wikilink">Plymouth Raiders</a> during the <a href="2007" class="uri" title="wikilink">2007</a> close season, ironically coming in as a replacement for long-term injured captain <a href="Gavin_Love" title="wikilink">Gavin Love</a>.</p>
<p>He quickly filled the void left by Love, and although faced some stiff competition from fellow new guard signing <a href="Brody_Bishop" title="wikilink">Brody Bishop</a> and long-serving Raider <a href="Allister_Gall" title="wikilink">Allister Gall</a>, cemented his place in the first team. His blistering pace is the cornerstone of his game, and Raiders' head coach has claimed him to be the fastest player in the league, while other comparisons to <a href="NBA" class="uri" title="wikilink">NBA</a> star <a href="Chris_Paul" title="wikilink">Chris Paul</a> have also been drawn.</p>
