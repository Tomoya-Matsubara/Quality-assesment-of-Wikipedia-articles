<p><strong>Horseshoe Curve</strong> is a , triple-tracked, <a href="railroad" class="uri" title="wikilink">railroad</a> <a href="Horseshoe_curve" title="wikilink">curve</a> on the <a href="Norfolk_Southern_Railway" title="wikilink">Norfolk Southern Railway</a>'s <a href="Pittsburgh_Line" title="wikilink">Pittsburgh Line</a> in <a href="Logan_Township,_Blair_County,_Pennsylvania" title="wikilink">Logan Township</a>, <a href="Blair_County,_Pennsylvania" title="wikilink">Blair County</a> in the U.S. state of <a href="Pennsylvania" class="uri" title="wikilink">Pennsylvania</a>. It is close to  in diameter and has a <a href="grade_(slope)" title="wikilink">grade</a> of almost 2 percent. As a train travels west from <a href="Altoona,_Pennsylvania" title="wikilink">Altoona</a>, it ascends almost  in the  segment that makes up the curve and rotates 220 degrees.</p>
<p>The curve was completed in 1854 by the <a href="Pennsylvania_Railroad" title="wikilink">Pennsylvania Railroad</a> as a means of lessening the grade to the summit of the <a href="Allegheny_Mountains" title="wikilink">Allegheny Mountains</a> by increasing the distance. It was built as alternative to the time-consuming <a href="Allegheny_Portage_Railroad" title="wikilink">Allegheny Portage Railroad</a>, the only other method of traversing the mountains. It has formed an important part of the region's transport infrastructure since its opening, and during <a href="World_War_II" title="wikilink">World War II</a> was targeted by <a href="Nazi_Germany" title="wikilink">Nazi Germany</a> in 1942 as a part of <a href="Operation_Pastorius" title="wikilink">Operation Pastorius</a>. The curve was later owned and used by the Pennsylvania Railroad's successors—<a href="Penn_Central_Transportation_Company" title="wikilink">Penn Central</a>, <a href="Conrail" class="uri" title="wikilink">Conrail</a>, and Norfolk Southern. Horseshoe Curve was added to the <a href="National_Register_of_Historic_Places" title="wikilink">National Register of Historic Places</a> and designated a <a href="National_Historic_Landmark" title="wikilink">National Historic Landmark</a> in 1966. It was also designated a <a href="National_Historic_Civil_Engineering_Landmark" title="wikilink">National Historic Civil Engineering Landmark</a> in 2004.</p>
<p>Since its opening, Horseshoe Curve has been a tourist attraction. A trackside observation park for visitor's was completed in 1879. The park was renovated and a visitor's center constructed in the early 1990s. The center is managed by <a href="Railroaders_Memorial_Museum" title="wikilink">Railroaders Memorial Museum</a> in Altoona and contains exhibits pertaining to the curve.</p>

<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<p>In 1834, the state of Pennsylvania constructed the <a href="Allegheny_Portage_Railroad" title="wikilink">Allegheny Portage Railroad</a> across the Allegheny Mountains to connect <a href="Philadelphia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Philadelphia</a> and Pittsburgh.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> The Portage Railroad consisted of a series of canals and <a href="funicular" title="wikilink">inclined planes</a> and remained in use until the mid-19th century. The <a href="Pennsylvania_Railroad" title="wikilink">Pennsylvania Railroad</a> was incorporated in 1847 and was tasked with building a railroad from Harrisburg to Pittsburgh, bypassing the cumbersome Portage Railroad.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="construction-and-use">Construction and use</h3>
<p><img src="The_Horseshoe_Curve,_Pennsylvania,_by_H.C._White_Co..jpg" title="fig:Stereo card of a train rounding the curve, circa 1907" alt="Stereo card of a train rounding the curve, circa 1907" /> Using surveys done several years earlier, the state's engineers recommended a route west from <a href="Lewistown,_Pennsylvania" title="wikilink">Lewistown</a> that followed the ridges, keeping the maximum <a href="grade_(slope)" title="wikilink">grade</a> over the entire  line at 0.852 percent.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> The Chief Engineer for the Pennsylvania Railroad <a href="John_Edgar_Thomson" title="wikilink">John Edgar Thomson</a>, however, opted to construct a line from Lewistown following lower, flatter terrain along the <a href="Juniata_River" title="wikilink">Juniata River</a> and having the steep grades only on a  stretch of track west of Altoona. It was discovered that the valley west of Altoona was split into two <a href="ravine" title="wikilink">ravines</a> by a mountain. Surveys done east from Gallitzin had already determined a suitable route on the opposite side of the valley that would keep the grade manageable. Traversing the valley using a bridge would have created a grade of 4.37 percent, which was too steep for most trains. To reduce the grade by increasing the distance between the points by using a curve, engineers constructed an earth <a href="embankment_(transportation)" title="wikilink">fill</a> over the first ravine encountered while ascending, formed by Kittanning Run, <a href="cut_(earthmoving)" title="wikilink">cut</a> the point of the mountain between the ravines, and filled in the second ravine, formed by Glenwhite Run.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
<p>Work on Horseshoe Curve began in 1850 and took over three years to complete.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> The construction was done any without <a href="heavy_equipment_(construction)" title="wikilink">heavy equipment</a>; only men &quot;with picks and shovels, horses and drags&quot; were used.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> The entire line, including Horseshoe Curve, was opened on February 15, 1854. The total cost to lay the  of track between Altoona and <a href="Johnstown,_Pennsylvania" title="wikilink">Johnstown</a> was <a href="United_States_dollar" title="wikilink">$</a>2,495,000 or equivalent to $80,225 per mile ($49,850 /km).<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> The remaining part of the mountain inside the curve was leveled in 1879 to allow for the construction of a park and observation area—the first specifically built for viewing trains.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> As the demand for train travel increased, a third set of tracks was added to the curve in 1898 and a fourth was added two years later to relieve congestion.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a><a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a></p>
<p>From around the 1860s to just before <a href="World_War_II" title="wikilink">World War II</a>, Horseshoe Curve was served by the <a href="Kittanning_Point_(PRR_station)" title="wikilink">Kittanning Point station</a>.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a><a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> Two <a href="branch_line" title="wikilink">branch railroads</a> connected to the main line at Horseshoe Curve in the early-20th century; both the Kittanning Run Railroad and the railroad owned by the Glen White Coal and Lumber Company followed their respective creeks to nearby coal mines.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> The Pennsylvania Railroad delivered empty <a href="hopper_car" title="wikilink">hopper cars</a> to the Kittanning Point station which the two railroads returned loaded with coal.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> Across from the station, a spur track on the hillside supplied a coal trestle, where trains could take on fuel and water during the early 1900s.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> A reservoir was constructed at the apex of Horseshoe Curve in 1887 for the city of Altoona; a second reservoir, below the first, was finished in 1896.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> The third reservoir, Lake Altoona, was completed by 1913.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> A <a href="macadam" class="uri" title="wikilink">macadam</a> road to the curve was opened in 1932 allowing access for visitors, and a <a href="gift_shop" title="wikilink">gift shop</a> was constructed in 1940.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a></p>
<p>Horseshoe Curve was a major selling point for the Pennsylvania Railroad.
