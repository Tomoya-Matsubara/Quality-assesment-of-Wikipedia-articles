<p><strong>500 East</strong><a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> is a <a href="Tram" title="wikilink">streetcar</a> stop in <a href="South_Salt_Lake,_Utah" title="wikilink">South Salt Lake</a>, <a href="Utah" class="uri" title="wikilink">Utah</a>, in the <a href="United_States" title="wikilink">United States</a>, served by <a href="Utah_Transit_Authority" title="wikilink">Utah Transit Authority</a>'s (UTA) <a href="S_Line_(UTA)" title="wikilink">S Line</a> (previously known as the Sugar House Streetcar). The S Line provides service from the <a href="Sugar_House,_Salt_Lake_City" title="wikilink">Sugar House</a> neighborhood of <a href="Salt_Lake_City" title="wikilink">Salt Lake City</a> to the city of South Salt Lake (where it connects with UTA's <a href="TRAX_(light_rail)" title="wikilink">TRAX light rail system</a>).</p>
<h2 id="description">Description</h2>
<p>The 500 East stop is located at 2234 South 500 East, just west of South 500 East. The single set of tracks diverges to form a <a href="Passing_loop" title="wikilink">passing track</a> at this stop, thus permitting (as planned in its schedule<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a>) two cars to stop at the stop at the same time. (The two tracks continue east across 500 East before merging back to a single set.) The two side platforms are located on the far north and south sides of the tracks. There is very limited street-side parking possible nearby. The stop began service on 8 December 2013 and is operated by Utah Transit Authority.</p>
<p>All of UTA's TRAX and <em><a href="FrontRunner" class="uri" title="wikilink">FrontRunner</a></em> trains and stations, streetcars and streetcar stops, and all fixed route buses are compliant with <a href="Americans_with_Disabilities_Act_of_1990" title="wikilink">Americans with Disabilities Act</a> and are therefore accessible to those with disabilities.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> Signage at the stations, on the passenger platforms, and on the trains clearly indicate accessibility options. In accordance with the <a href="List_of_smoking_bans_in_the_United_States#Utah" title="wikilink">Utah Clean Air Act</a> and UTA ordinance, &quot;smoking is prohibited on UTA vehicles as well as UTA bus stops, TRAX stations, and <em>FrontRunner</em> stations&quot;.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
