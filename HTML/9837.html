<p>A family business since its founding as a weekly in 1869, <em>The Gardner News</em> has been a daily since 1897 and part of the Bell family since 1973, when C. Gordon Bell became president and publisher (he had been general manager of the company for a decade). During Gordon Bell's tenure as publisher, the newspaper modernized and was recognized as a leader among small New England dailies.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>Upon Gordon Bell's death in 1992, his wife Alberta Bell became publisher of the newspaper where she had worked since 1986.</p>
<h3 id="the-leominster-times">The Leominster Times</h3>
<p>During Alberta Bell's tenure as publisher, <em>The Gardner News</em> made one attempt at expanding its footprint, a six-month attempt in late <a href="1994" class="uri" title="wikilink">1994</a> to establish a new newspaper for <a href="Fitchburg,_Massachusetts" title="wikilink">Fitchburg</a> and <a href="Leominster,_Massachusetts" title="wikilink">Leominster, Massachusetts</a>. <em>The Leominster Times</em> was marketed as a general-interest newspaper, but Bell said she would make special efforts to cover minorities in Fitchburg and Leominster.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>Initially launched as a six-day daily newspaper (Monday through Saturday) in July 1994, <em>The Times</em> five months later cut back to a twice-weekly schedule and focused its coverage on Leominster only. Its <a href="January_6" title="wikilink">January 6</a>, <a href="1995" class="uri" title="wikilink">1995</a> issue was its last.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
