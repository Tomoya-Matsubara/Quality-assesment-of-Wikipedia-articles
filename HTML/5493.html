<p><strong>Tonalist</strong> (foaled February 11, 2011) is an American <a href="Thoroughbred" class="uri" title="wikilink">Thoroughbred</a> <a href="horse_racing" title="wikilink">racehorse</a> best known for winning the <a href="2014_Belmont_Stakes" title="wikilink">2014 Belmont Stakes</a>, beating the favored <a href="California_Chrome" title="wikilink">California Chrome</a>, who was attempting to win the <a href="United_States_Triple_Crown_of_Thoroughbred_Racing" title="wikilink">Triple Crown</a>. Tonalist won the <a href="Peter_Pan_Stakes" title="wikilink">Peter Pan Stakes</a> in May 2014. He is the first horse since <a href="A.P._Indy" title="wikilink">A.P.

<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>Tonalist is an unusually large bay colt, standing  high.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> with an irregular white <a href="Horse_markings#Facial_markings" title="wikilink">blaze</a> bred in Kentucky by the Virginia-based Woodslane Farm.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> He was sired by <a href="Tapit" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tapit</a>, a <a href="gray_(horse)" title="wikilink">gray</a> son of <a href="Pulpit_(horse)" title="wikilink">Pulpit</a>, who won the <a href="Wood_Memorial_Stakes" title="wikilink">Wood Memorial Stakes</a> and started second favorite for the 2004 Kentucky Derby. Tapit has become a successful breeding stallion with other progeny including <a href="Hansen_(horse)" title="wikilink">Hansen</a>, <a href="Stardom_Bound" title="wikilink">Stardom Bound</a>, Tapitsfly (<a href="Breeders&#39;_Cup_Juvenile_Fillies_Turf" title="wikilink">Breeders' Cup Juvenile Fillies Turf</a>), Tapizar (<a href="Breeders&#39;_Cup_Dirt_Mile" title="wikilink">Breeders' Cup Dirt Mile</a>) and Untapable (<a href="Kentucky_Oaks" title="wikilink">Kentucky Oaks</a>).<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> Tonalist's dam, Settling Mist, a daughter of the Kentucky Derby winner <a href="Pleasant_Colony" title="wikilink">Pleasant Colony</a>, won once from nineteen starts in 2002 and 2003.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> As a great-granddaughter of the broodmare Missy Baba, Settling Mist was closely related to several major winners including <a href="Summer_Squall" title="wikilink">Summer Squall</a>, <a href="A_P_Indy" title="wikilink">A P Indy</a>, <a href="Duke_of_Marmalade" title="wikilink">Duke of Marmalade</a> and <a href="Lemon_Drop_Kid" title="wikilink">Lemon Drop Kid</a>.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p>As a <a href="yearling_(horse)" title="wikilink">yearling</a>, Tonalist was consigned to the <a href="Fasig-Tipton" class="uri" title="wikilink">Fasig-Tipton</a> Sale in August 2012, by Wayne and Cathy Sweezey on behalf of Woodlane Farm's owners, Rene and Lauren Woolcott. Wayne Sweezey described the colt as &quot;one of the most stunning horses we had ever had on the farm. I've raised a lot of horses in my time, and he was special - not only in his looks but also in his temperament&quot; but explained that after a &quot;growth spurt&quot; in July he looked less impressive when he entered the sales ring.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> He was not sold as he failed to reach his <a href="reserve_price" title="wikilink">reserve price</a> of $195,000.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> Shortly after the sale Tonalist was bought privately by Robert S. Evans largely because of a family connection: his father <a href="Thomas_Mellon_Evans" title="wikilink">Thomas Mellon Evans</a> had won the Kentucky Derby with Pleasant Colony.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> The colt was sent into training with the French-born trainer <a href="Christophe_Clement" title="wikilink">Christophe Clement</a>, best-known as a trainer of turf horses.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>

<h3 id="two-year-old-season">2013: two-year-old season</h3>
<p>On his only appearance as a two-year-old, Tonalist started a 16-1 outsider for a <a href="maiden_race" title="wikilink">maiden race</a> at <a href="Aqueduct_Race_Track" title="wikilink">Aqueduct Race Track</a> on November 16 and finished fourth of the nine runners behind Matterhorn. According to Equibase, he was towards the rear in the early stages and was forced five wide on the final turn but made some progress in the closing stages.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="three-year-old-season">2014: three-year-old season</h3>
<p>Tonalist began his second season at <a href="Gulfstream_Park" title="wikilink">Gulfstream Park</a> in Florida, winning a maiden race over nine furlongs in January and running second to Constitution in an allowance race a month later. Any chance he had of competing in the major trials for the Triple Crown ended when he contracted a lung infection which disrupted his training schedule.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> In May he was moved up sharply in class when he contested the Grade II Peter Pan Stakes at <a href="Belmont_Park" title="wikilink">Belmont Park</a>. Wearing <a href="blinkers_(horse_tack)" title="wikilink">blinkers</a> for the first time,<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> he was ridden by <a href="Joel_Rosario" title="wikilink">Joel Rosario</a> and started the 6-5 favorite against six opponents on a &quot;sloppy&quot; track. He stumbled at the start but recovered to take the lead after a quarter of a mile and went clear in the straight to win by four lengths from Commissioner.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> After the race Clement commented &quot;What impressed me was the last eighth of a mile, when he opened up again. I was very worried about the wet track. I don't breeze my horses on the wet track so that was a complete question mark. He answered that pretty nicely. Let's see how the horse comes out of it, but of course we have to think about the Belmont Stakes&quot;. Rosario said &quot;He was doing it easy; he was doing it on his own. I don't think we were going that fast. He can go a mile and a half; I think he can run all day. He's a big horse with a long stride, when you get him in the bridle, the more you ask, the more he'll give&quot;.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
<p>On June 7, in front of a crowd of 120,000,<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> Tonalist contested the 146th running of the Belmont Stakes which attracted much attention as California Chrome, the winner of the Kentucky Derby and Preakness Stakes attempted to become the first horse since Affirmed in 1978 to complete the Triple Crown. Clement professed his lack of concern when Tonalist was drawn on the complete outside of the eleven runner field, saying &quot;He's a really, really big horse with a long stride, so he can basically run his own race without worrying about anybody else.&quot;<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> After a late surge of support in the betting,<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> he started the 9.2/1 fifth choice behind California Chrome, <a href="Wicked_Strong" title="wikilink">Wicked Strong</a>, Ride on Curlin (runner-up in the Preakness) and Commanding Curve (runner-up in the Derby). Tonalist broke well from his outside draw and was third behind Commissioner and General A Rod after the first half mile. He maintained his position despite being forced four wide on the final turn and gradually wore down the opposition in the straight to win by a head from Commissioner, with Medal Count in third and California Chrome <a href="Tie_(draw)" title="wikilink">dead heating</a> with <a href="Wicked_Strong" title="wikilink">Wicked Strong</a> for fourth.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> After the race Rosario commented &quot;He was going easy, I didn't want to be too far behind. When I got to the three-eighths pole I was a little confident. I was worried a little bit turning for home, but he started picking them up.&quot;<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> Stevens said &quot;This morning I went to my father's grave and thanked him for putting me in this position&quot; before commiserating with California Chrome's connections saying &quot;I've been where Steve Coburn has been, and it's not fun. I remember it was real quiet after we lost [when Pleasant Colony finished third in the Belmont] in 1981.&quot;<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> When asked to respond to Coburn's statement that he had taken the &quot;coward's way&quot; by not running his horse in the first two legs of the series, Stevens said &quot;I don&lt;U+2019&gt;t think I have a comment on that&quot;.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a></p>
