<p>Roadblock is one of the most prominent <a href="African-Americans" class="uri" title="wikilink">African-Americans</a> in the series. He is portrayed by <a href="Dwayne_Johnson" title="wikilink">Dwayne Johnson</a> in the 2013 film <em><a href="G.I._Joe:_Retaliation" title="wikilink">G.I. Joe: Retaliation</a></em>.</p>
<h2 id="profile">Profile</h2>
<p>Roadblock's real name is Marvin F. Hinton and he was born in <a href="Biloxi,_Mississippi" title="wikilink">Biloxi, Mississippi</a>. His primary function in G.I. Joe is as a heavy machine gunner and his secondary function is as a <a href="cook_(profession)" title="wikilink">cook</a>.</p>
<p>Roadblock grew up with a large extended family, but was shy despite being a Boy Scout and singing in the church choir.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> Before he enlisted in the <a href="United_States_Army" title="wikilink">U.S. Army</a>, Roadblock wanted to be a gourmet chef, and was working as a bouncer to earn enough money to attend <a href="Escoffier" class="uri" title="wikilink">Escoffier</a> School in <a href="France" class="uri" title="wikilink">France</a>. An army recruiter convinced him that he could learn to be a chef in the Army. After enlisting, Roadblock found Army food appalling, and transferred to infantry where he excelled at using heavy weapons. Roadblock is one of the biggest and strongest members of G.I. Joe, able to carry a fully loaded <a href="M2_Browning_machine_gun" title="wikilink">M2 Browning machine gun</a> as a personal weapon, which can weigh up to 134 lbs, and usually requires a dedicated squad to transport and operate. Despite working in infantry, he still maintains his passion for making good food, and indulges in it while engaging in his secondary duty. He is a qualified expert with the <a href="M2_Browning" title="wikilink">M2 Browning</a> .50 cal heavy machine gun, all <a href="Warsaw_Pact" title="wikilink">Warsaw Pact</a> heavy machine guns, <a href="M16_rifle" title="wikilink">M-16</a>, and the <a href="M1911" title="wikilink">M-1911A1 auto pistol</a>.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>When the G.I. Joe team temporarily disbanded, Roadblock finally took the opportunity to become a gourmet chef. He wrote several cookbooks that became best-sellers, endorsed a line of cooking products under his name, and briefly hosted his own television cooking show. But when the team was reinstated, he happily hung up his chef's hat and rejoined them once again, staying on when the team was re-activated with a reduced roster.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>In the UK <a href="Action_Force" title="wikilink">Action Force</a> toy series, Roadblock is originally from the <a href="French_Congo" title="wikilink">French Congo</a>.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> As the Action Force and G.I. Joe toy lines merged, his profile altered to the American variant.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>In the animated series, Roadblock is depicted as speaking in rhyme. He has a cousin named <a href="Heavy_Duty_(G.I._Joe)" title="wikilink">Heavy Duty</a>.</p>
<h2 id="toys">Toys</h2>
<p>Roadblock was first released as an action figure in 1984.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a><a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> A second version of the figure was released in 1986,<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a><a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> and the original figure was repainted and released as part of the &quot;Tiger Force&quot; line in 1988.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a><a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> A new version of Roadblock was released in 1992.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> This figure was repainted and released as part of the &quot;Battle Corps&quot; line in 1993.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> A new version of Roadblock was also released in 1993 as part of the <a href="Star_Brigade" title="wikilink">Star Brigade</a> line,<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> which was repainted and re-released in 1994.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
<p>Additionally, G.I. Joe issued a 12&quot; Roadblock action figure for the 1992 Hall of Fame series that brought back the 12&quot; G.I. Joe action figures.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> After that, G.I. Joe issued two other versions of the 12&quot; Roadblock. Roadblock's head is bald and the face has a mustache. Some versions have a small goatee on the chin. An action figure called <a href="Double_Blast" title="wikilink">Double Blast</a> used one of the Roadblock molds causing fear in <a href="Fan_(aficionado)" title="wikilink">fans</a> that Hasbro lost the rights to Roadblock's name. Interestingly enough, Hasbro released a figure named Roadblock with Double Blast's information and real name on the filecard. All other versions of Roadblock have been remakes of the original.</p>

<h3 id="marvel-comics">Marvel Comics</h3>
<p>Unlike the cartoon version, the comic book Roadblock does not spout rhymes, and is mentioned to have a fierce temper that &quot;is a long time building, and a long time going&quot;. He has been known to say things like &quot;Flush 'em out with a burst of fifty 'cal&quot;, meaning force enemies out into the open with concentrated fire from his .50 caliber machinegun.</p>

<p>In the next issue, Roadblock is part of a Joe team attempting to keep <a href="Cobra_Commander" title="wikilink">Cobra Commander</a> prisoner in the <a href="Rocky_Mountains" title="wikilink">Rocky Mountains</a>.

<p>In issue #69, while in an American <a href="embassy" class="uri" title="wikilink">embassy</a> that is being looted, Roadblock threatens a man who is intending to burn an American flag. Roadblock aims his weapon at the man's head, asking him to &quot;desist in your actions or I will be obliged to reduce your head to a fine red mist.&quot; When the threatened man points out how looters are stealing typewriters, Roadblock states that &quot;Nobody ever died for a typewriter.&quot; The man backs down.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a></p>
<p>In issues #77 and #78, he and other Joes battle American agents who are trying to frame and arrest every single G.I. Joe member.

He manages to organize a group of Joe allies, along with the unexpected assistance of Destro, temporarily halting the conspiracy.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>

<h3 id="devils-due-comics">Devil's Due Comics</h3>
<p>The Joe team spends much time inactive. When Cobra is revealed to be a threat yet again, Roadblock, now making a living as a chef, eagerly answers the call to reform the team.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> He is one of those stricken by the nanite virus but recovers.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a></p>
<p>Roadblock gains his own television cooking show. It ends up that <a href="Tomax_and_Xamot" title="wikilink">Tomax and Xamot</a>, Cobra operatives, own the show; they decide to have the studios destroyed to cover up <a href="money_laundering" title="wikilink">money laundering</a> crimes. Roadblock ends up fighting overeager Dreadnoks on stage, which just increases his popularity, including sales of his Marvin Hinton Grill.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a></p>
<p>In the alternate continuity of Devil's Due <em>G.I. Joe Versus Transformers</em>, Roadblock is one of the few Joes to pilot large, humanoid robots. They befriend and team up with the Autobots to stop a conspiracy happening literally below their own headquarters.</p>
