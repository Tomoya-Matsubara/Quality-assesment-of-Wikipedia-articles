<h2 id="names-and-etymology">Names and etymology</h2>
<p>The V&lt;U+00F6&gt;lvas and their male counterparts were referred to by many names. The Old Norse word <em>V&lt;U+00F6&gt;lva</em> means &quot;wand carrier&quot; and it continues <a href="Proto-Germanic" class="uri" title="wikilink">Proto-Germanic</a> *<em>walw&lt;U+014D&gt;n</em>, which is derived from a word for &quot;wand&quot; (ON <em>v&lt;U+00F6&gt;lr</em>).<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> <em>Vala</em>, on the other hand, is a literary form based on <em>V&lt;U+00F6&gt;lva</em>.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> Other names were <em>sei&lt;U+00F0&gt;kona</em> for women and <em>sei&lt;U+00F0&gt;ma&lt;U+00F0&gt;r</em> for men, where <em><a href="sei&lt;U+00F0&gt;r" class="uri" title="wikilink">sei&lt;U+00F0&gt;r</a></em> refers to magic practices and is related to the <a href="Lithuanian_language" title="wikilink">Lithuanian</a> words <em>saitas</em> (&quot;magic&quot;), <em>saitu</em> and <em>saisti</em> (&quot;interpret signs&quot;), and also to <a href="Greek_language" title="wikilink">Greek</a> <em>(h)oim&lt;U+1E17&gt;</em> (&quot;song&quot;, etc.).<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> As for <em>sp&lt;U+00E1&gt;kona</em>, and its English form <em>spaewife</em>, the ON word <em>sp&lt;U+00E1&gt;</em> refers to <a href="prophecy" title="wikilink">prophesying</a> and it continues Proto-Germanic <em>*spah-</em> and the <a href="Proto-Indo-European_root" title="wikilink">PIE root</a> <em></em>, and it is consequently related to Latin <em>speccio</em> (&quot;sees&quot;) and <a href="Sanskrit" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sanskrit</a> <em>sp&lt;U+00E1&gt;&lt;U+00E7&gt;ati</em> and <em>p&lt;U+00E1&gt;&lt;U+00E7&gt;yati</em> (&quot;sees&quot;, etc.).<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> The etymology of the <a href="Old_English_language" title="wikilink">Anglo-Saxon</a> word <em>wicce</em>, which resulted in the modern word <a href="witch" class="uri" title="wikilink">witch</a>, is more contested, see <a href="Witch_(etymology)" title="wikilink">Witch (etymology)</a>.

<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>V&lt;U+00F6&gt;lvas practiced <a href="seid" title="wikilink">sei&lt;U+00F0&gt;r</a>, <em>sp&lt;U+00E1&gt;</em> and <a href="galdr" class="uri" title="wikilink">galdr</a>, practices which encompassed <a href="shamanism" class="uri" title="wikilink">shamanism</a>, <a href="sorcery" class="uri" title="wikilink">sorcery</a>, <a href="prophet" title="wikilink">prophecy</a> and other forms of indigenous magic. Sei&lt;U+00F0&gt;r in particular had connotations of <em><a href="ergi" class="uri" title="wikilink">ergi</a></em> (unmanliness), although there were male practitioners. Historical and mythological depictions of V&lt;U+00F6&gt;lvas show that they were held in high esteem and they were held to possess such powers that even the father of the gods, <a href="Odin" class="uri" title="wikilink">Odin</a> himself, consulted a V&lt;U+00F6&gt;lva for what the future had in store for the gods. This account is preserved in the <em><a href="V&lt;U+00F6&gt;lusp&lt;U+00E1&gt;" class="uri" title="wikilink">V&lt;U+00F6&gt;lusp&lt;U+00E1&gt;</a></em> which roughly translates to &quot;prophecy of the V&lt;U+00F6&gt;lva&quot;. Examples of V&lt;U+00F6&gt;lvas in Norse literature include the seeress Heidi (alt. Heith) in <em><a href="V&lt;U+00F6&gt;lusp&lt;U+00E1&gt;" class="uri" title="wikilink">V&lt;U+00F6&gt;lusp&lt;U+00E1&gt;</a></em>, <a href="Gr&lt;U+00F3&gt;a" class="uri" title="wikilink">Gr&lt;U+00F3&gt;a</a> in <em><a href="Svipdagsm&lt;U+00E1&gt;l" class="uri" title="wikilink">Svipdagsm&lt;U+00E1&gt;l</a></em>, Thorbj&lt;U+00F6&gt;rg in the <em><a href="Saga_of_Eric_the_Red" title="wikilink">Saga of Eric the Red</a></em> and <a href="Huld" class="uri" title="wikilink">Huld</a> in for instance <em><a href="Ynglinga_saga" title="wikilink">Ynglinga saga</a></em>.</p>

They sacrificed the prisoners of war and sprinkled their blood (see <a href="Bl&lt;U+00F3&gt;t" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bl&lt;U+00F3&gt;t</a>), in order to prophesy coming events.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p>In his <a href="Commentarii_de_Bello_Gallico" title="wikilink">Commentarii de Bello Gallico</a> (1, 50) <a href="Julius_Caesar" title="wikilink">Julius Caesar</a> writes in the course of clashes with Germanic tribesmen under <a href="Ariovistus" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ariovistus</a> (58 BCE):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When Caesar inquired of his prisoners, wherefore Ariovistus did not come to an engagement, he discovered this to be the reason -- that among the Germans it was the custom for their <em>matrons</em> to pronounce from lots and divination whether it were expedient that the battle should be engaged in or not; that they had said, &quot;that it was not the will of heaven that the Germans should conquer, if they engaged in battle before the new moon.&quot;</p>

<h2 id="viking-society">Viking society</h2>
<p>In Viking society, a V&lt;U+00F6&gt;lva was an elderly woman who had released herself from the strong family bonds that normally surrounded women in the <a href="Norse_clans" title="wikilink">Old Norse clan society</a>. She travelled the land, usually followed by a retinue of young people, and she was summoned in times of crisis. She had immense authority and she charged well for her services.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<p>In addition, many aristocratic Viking women wanted to serve Freyja and represent her in <a href="Midgard" class="uri" title="wikilink">Midgard</a>.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> They married Viking warlords who had <a href="Odin" class="uri" title="wikilink">Odin</a> as a role model, and they settled in great halls that were earthly representations of <a href="Valhalla" class="uri" title="wikilink">Valhalla</a>.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> In these halls there were magnificent feasts with ritualized meals, and the visiting chieftains can be likened with the <a href="einherjar" class="uri" title="wikilink">einherjar</a>, the fallen warriors who fought bravely and were served drinks by <a href="Valkyrie" title="wikilink">Valkyries</a>.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> However, the duties of the mistresses were not limited to serving mead to visiting guests, but they were also expected to take part in warfare by manipulating weaving tools magically when their spouses were out in battle.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> Scholars no longer believe that these women waited passively at home, and there is evidence for their magic activities both in archaeological finds and in Old Norse sources, such as the <em><a href="Darra&lt;U+00F0&gt;arlj&lt;U+00F3&gt;&lt;U+00F0&gt;" class="uri" title="wikilink">Darra&lt;U+00F0&gt;arlj&lt;U+00F3&gt;&lt;U+00F0&gt;</a></em>.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
<p>It is difficult to draw a line between the aristocratic lady and the wandering V&lt;U+00F6&gt;lva, but Old Norse sources present the V&lt;U+00F6&gt;lva as more professional and she went from estate to estate selling her spiritual services.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> The V&lt;U+00F6&gt;lva had greater authority than the aristocratic lady, but both were ultimately dependent on the benevolence of the warlord that they served.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> When they had been attached to a warlord, their authority depended on their personal competence and credibility.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a></p>

<p><em><a href="The_Saga_of_Eric_the_Red" title="wikilink">The Saga of Eric the Red</a></em> relates that the settlers in <a href="Greenland" class="uri" title="wikilink">Greenland</a> c. 1000 were suffering a time of starvation. In order to prepare for the future, the V&lt;U+00F6&gt;lva &lt;U+00DE&gt;&lt;U+00F3&gt;rbj&lt;U+00F6&gt;rgr was summoned. Before her arrival the whole household was thoroughly cleaned and prepared. The high seat, which was otherwise reserved for the master and his wife, was furnished with down pillows.</p>
<p>The V&lt;U+00F6&gt;lva appeared in the evening and she was dressed in a blue or black <a href="cloak" class="uri" title="wikilink">cloak</a>, which was decked with gems to the hem, and it reached down to her feet. In her hand, she wielded a wand, the symbolic <a href="distaff" class="uri" title="wikilink">distaff</a> (<em>sei&lt;U+00F0&gt;stafr</em>), which was adorned with brass and decked with gems on the knob. In <em><a href="Orvar-Odd&#39;s_Saga" title="wikilink">&lt;U+00D6&gt;rvar-Odd's Saga</a></em>, the sei&lt;U+00F0&gt;kona also wears a blue or black cloak and carries a distaff (a wand which allegedly has the power of causing forgetfulness in one who is tapped three times on the cheek by it). The colour of the cloak may be less significant than the fact that it was intended to signify the otherness of the sei&lt;U+00F0&gt;kona.</p>
<p>The <em>Saga of Eric the Red</em> further relates that around her neck she wore a necklace of glass pearls, and on her head she wore a headpiece of black lamb trimmed with white cat skin. Around her waist she wore a belt of <a href="amadou" class="uri" title="wikilink">amadou</a> from which hung a large pouch, where she hid the tools that she used during the sei&lt;U+00F0&gt;r. On her feet she wore shoes of calfskin and the shoelaces had brass knobs in the ends, and on her hands she wore gloves of cat skin, which were white and fluffy inside.</p>
<p>As the V&lt;U+00F6&gt;lva entered the room, she was hailed with reverence by the household, and then she was led to the high seat, where she was provided with dishes prepared only for her. She had a <a href="porridge" class="uri" title="wikilink">porridge</a> made of goat milk and a dish made of hearts from all the kinds of animals at the homestead. She ate the dishes with a brass spoon and a knife whose point was broken off.</p>
<p>The V&lt;U+00F6&gt;lva was to sleep at the farm during the night and the next day was reserved for her dance. In order to dance the sei&lt;U+00F0&gt;r, she needed special tools. First, she positioned herself on a special elevated platform and a group of young women sat down around her. The girls sang special songs intended to summon the powers that the V&lt;U+00F6&gt;lva wished to communicate with. The session was a success, because the V&lt;U+00F6&gt;lva was permitted to see far into the future, and the famine was averted.</p>
<p>In the prologue of the <a href="Prose_Edda" title="wikilink">Prose Edda</a>, the origin of <a href="Thor" title="wikilink">Thor's</a> wife <a href="Sif" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sif</a> is detailed, where she is said to be a <em>sp&lt;U+00E1&gt;kona</em>.

<p>Around 1000 BCE, a V&lt;U+00F6&gt;lva was buried with considerable splendour in Hagebyh&lt;U+00F6&gt;ga in <a href="&lt;U+00D6&gt;sterg&lt;U+00F6&gt;tland" class="uri" title="wikilink">&lt;U+00D6&gt;sterg&lt;U+00F6&gt;tland</a>, Sweden.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> In addition to being buried with her wand, she had received great riches which included horses, a wagon and an Arabian bronze pitcher.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> There was also a silver pendant which represents a woman with a broad necklace around her neck.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> This kind of necklace was only worn by the most prominent women during the Iron Age and some have interpreted it as <a href="Freyja" class="uri" title="wikilink">Freyja</a>'s favourite necklace, the <a href="Br&lt;U+00ED&gt;singamen" class="uri" title="wikilink">Br&lt;U+00ED&gt;singamen</a>. The pendant may represent Freyja herself, the most prominent V&lt;U+00F6&gt;lva of them all.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a></p>
<p>In <a href="Birka" class="uri" title="wikilink">Birka</a>, a V&lt;U+00F6&gt;lva and a warrior were once buried together. Above them, a spear was positioned in order to dedicate the dead couple to <a href="Odin" class="uri" title="wikilink">Odin</a>.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> They had probably served Freyja and Odin, two gods of war, and he had done so with his spear and she with her wand.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a></p>

<p>In theory, invisible fetters and bonds could be controlled from a loom, and if a lady loosened a knot in the woof, she could liberate the leg of her hero.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a> But if she tied a knot, she could stop the enemy from moving.<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> The men may have fought on the battle field in sweat and blood, but in a spiritual way, their women took part.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a> It is not by coincidence that archaeologists find weaving tools and weapons side by side.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a></p>
<p>A distaff possessed magical powers, and in the world of the gods, the <a href="Norn" title="wikilink">Norns</a> twinned the threads of fate.<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a> In <em><a href="Helgakvi&lt;U+00F0&gt;a_Hundingsbana_I" title="wikilink">Helgakvi&lt;U+00F0&gt;a Hundingsbana I</a></em>, Norns arrive at the birth of <a href="Helgi_Hundingsbane" title="wikilink">Helgi Hundingsbane</a> and twinned his fate as a hero, and it is possible that these Norns were not divine beings but V&lt;U+00F6&gt;lvas.<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a> Many of the wands that have been excavated have a basket-like shape in the top, and they are very similar to distaffs used for spinning linnen.<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a> One theory for the origin of the word <em>sei&lt;U+00F0&gt;r</em> is &quot;thread spun with a distaff&quot;, and according to this theory, practicing magic was to send out spiritual threads.<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a> Since the Norsemen believed that the Norns controlled people's fate by spinning, it is very likely that they considered individual fates to be controllable with the same method.<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a></p>
<p>It is not a coincidence, that women are called &quot;peace-weavers&quot; in <em><a href="Beowulf" class="uri" title="wikilink">Beowulf</a></em>, and since <a href="Freyja" class="uri" title="wikilink">Freyja</a> had started the first war, it was on the part of the V&lt;U+00F6&gt;lva to decide when to start wars by practicing magic.<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a> This is probably why <a href="Harald_I_of_Denmark" title="wikilink">Harald Bluetooth</a>, who was at war with the <a href="Holy_Roman_Empire" title="wikilink">Holy Roman emperor</a> apparently kept a V&lt;U+00F6&gt;lva at Fyrkat.<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="sexual-rites-and-drugs">Sexual rites and drugs</h3>
<p>Nowadays, it is generally accepted among scholars that fertility was essential in Viking society, and the most famous find that testify to such rites is a small statuette that was found in R&lt;U+00E4&gt;llinge in Sweden in the early 20th century.<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a> The aspect of this statuette indicates that it was related to fertility rites and it is usually interpreted as Freyja's brother <a href="Freyr" class="uri" title="wikilink">Freyr</a>.<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a> Moreover, <a href="Adam_of_Bremen" title="wikilink">Adam of Bremen</a> tells of the phallic statue of Freyr in the <a href="Temple_at_Uppsala" title="wikilink">Temple at Uppsala</a> and of the racy songs that were song during the rituals.<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a> In <em><a href="V&lt;U+00F6&gt;lsa_&lt;U+00FE&gt;&lt;U+00E1&gt;ttr" title="wikilink">V&lt;U+00F6&gt;lsa &lt;U+00FE&gt;&lt;U+00E1&gt;ttr</a></em>, there is an account on how a horse's penis was worshipped by a pagan family, an account that has connections with an old Indo-Aryan sacrificial rite.<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a> In <a href="Ibn_Fadlan" title="wikilink">Ibn Fadlan</a>'s description of the burial of a Scandinavian chieftain on the Volga, a slave girl who was to be sacrificed had to undergo several sexual rites.<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a> First, she had sex with some of the men in the chieftain's retinue, then when the chieftain had been put in the ship, she went from tent to tent where she visited warriors and traders.<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a> Every man told her that they did what they did for their love to the dead chieftain.<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a> Lastly, she entered a tent that had been raised on the ship, and in it six men had intercourse with her before she was strangled and stabbed.<a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a> The sexual rites with the slave girl show that she was considered to be a vessel for the transmission of life force to the deceased chieftain.<a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a></p>
<p>All wands that have been excavated can not be associated with distaffs, but instead they appear to represent a phallos, and moreover the use of magic had close associations with sexuality in Old Norse society.<a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a> In the eddic poem <em><a href="Lokasenna" class="uri" title="wikilink">Lokasenna</a></em>, due to his interest in seid, <a href="Odin" class="uri" title="wikilink">Odin</a> is depicted as being <a href="ergi" class="uri" title="wikilink">ergi</a>, which suggests that he was perceived as unmanly, cowardly and accepting the female role in sexual intercourse.<a href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a> As early as 1902, an anonymous German scholar (he did not dare publishing in his own name) wrote on how seid was connected with sex.<a href="#fn67" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a> He argued that the wand was an obvious phallic symbol and why should magic otherwise be considered taboo for men.<a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a> It was possible that the magic practices included sexual rites.<a href="#fn69" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref69"><sup>69</sup></a> As early as 1920, it was noted that the name of the male magic practitioner Ragnvald Rettilbein referred to such practices, as <em>rettilbein</em> means &quot;straight member&quot;.<a href="#fn70" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a></p>
<p>The V&lt;U+00F6&gt;lvas were known for their art of seduction, which was one of the reasons why they were considered dangerous.<a href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a> One of the stanzas in <em><a href="H&lt;U+00E1&gt;vam&lt;U+00E1&gt;l" class="uri" title="wikilink">H&lt;U+00E1&gt;vam&lt;U+00E1&gt;l</a></em> warns against sexual intercourse with a woman who is skilled in magic, because the one who does so runs the risk of being caught in a magic bond and also risks getting ill.<a href="#fn72" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref72"><sup>72</sup></a> Freyja, who is the master of seid, has a free sexual life that gives her a bad reputation in certain myths.<a href="#fn73" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref73"><sup>73</sup></a></p>
<p>One of the methods for seducing men may have been the use of drugs.<a href="#fn74" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref74"><sup>74</sup></a> In <a href="Fyrkat" class="uri" title="wikilink">Fyrkat</a>, the grave of a V&lt;U+00F6&gt;lva revealed the use of <a href="henbane" class="uri" title="wikilink">henbane</a>, a drug which does not only give hallucinations, as it can also be a powerful <a href="aphrodisiac" class="uri" title="wikilink">aphrodisiac</a>.<a href="#fn75" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref75"><sup>75</sup></a> If Freyja was the goddess of love in <a href="Asgard" class="uri" title="wikilink">Asgard</a>, the V&lt;U+00F6&gt;lva was her counterpart in <a href="Midgard" class="uri" title="wikilink">Midgard</a>.<a href="#fn76" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref76"><sup>76</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="other-practices">Other practices</h3>
<p>The V&lt;U+00F6&gt;lvas could also employ drums during their sessions, like the <a href="Sami_shamanism" title="wikilink">Sami shamans</a>.<a href="#fn77" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref77"><sup>77</sup></a> All V&lt;U+00F6&gt;lvas were not surrounded by the same retinue and preparations as &lt;U+00DE&gt;&lt;U+00F3&gt;rbj&lt;U+00F6&gt;rgr, but she could also perform the sei&lt;U+00F0&gt;r alone, which was called <em>&lt;U+00FA&gt;tiseta</em> (literally, &quot;sitting out&quot;).<a href="#fn78" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref78"><sup>78</sup></a><a href="#fn79" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref79"><sup>79</sup></a> This practice appears to have involved <a href="meditation" class="uri" title="wikilink">meditation</a> or <a href="introspection" class="uri" title="wikilink">introspection</a>, possibly for the purpose of <a href="divination" class="uri" title="wikilink">divination</a>.

The term is derived from a 13th century <a href="Icelandic_law" title="wikilink">Icelandic law</a> which outlawed <em>&lt;U+00FA&gt;tiseta at vekja tr&lt;U+00F6&gt;ll upp ok fremja hei&lt;U+00F0&gt;ni</em> &quot;sitting out to wake up <a href="troll" title="wikilink">trolls</a> and practicing heathenry&quot;. Although the theoretical punishment for this offense foreseen by the law was death, nobody was convicted under it until a minor <a href="witch_craze" title="wikilink">witch craze</a> reached Iceland in the 17th century.<a href="#fn80" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref80"><sup>80</sup></a> Keyser (1854) describes it as &quot;a peculiar kind of sorcery [...] in which the magician sat out at night under the open sky [...] especially to inquire into the future&quot;.</p>
