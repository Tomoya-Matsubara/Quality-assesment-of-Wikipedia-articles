<p><strong>Justinian I</strong> (, ; 483&lt;U+2013&gt; 13 or 14 November 565), commonly known as <strong>Justinian the Great</strong>, was <a href="Byzantine_Emperor" title="wikilink">Roman (Byzantine) Emperor</a> from 527 to 565. During his reign, Justinian sought to revive the empire's greatness and reconquer the lost <a href="Western_Roman_Empire" title="wikilink">western half</a> of the classical Roman Empire.</p>
<p>One of the most important figures of <a href="Late_Antiquity" title="wikilink">Late Antiquity</a> and the last emperor to speak <a href="Latin" class="uri" title="wikilink">Latin</a> as a first language,<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> Justinian's rule constitutes a distinct epoch in the history of the <a href="Eastern_Roman_Empire" title="wikilink">Eastern Roman Empire</a>. The impact of his administration extended far beyond the boundaries of his time and domain. Justinian's reign is marked by the ambitious but only partly realized <em>renovatio imperii</em>, or &quot;restoration of the empire&quot;.<ref>J.F. Haldon, <em>Byzantium in the seventh century</em> (Cambridge, 2003), 17&lt;U+2013&gt;19.</p>
<p>Because of his restoration activities, Justinian has sometimes been called the &quot;<a href="Last_of_the_Romans" title="wikilink">Last Roman</a>&quot; in modern historiography, for instance by G.P. Baker (<em>Justinian</em>, New York 1938), or in the <em>Outline of Great Books</em> series (<em>Justinian the Great</em>).</ref> This ambition was expressed by the partial recovery of the territories of the <a href="Western_Roman_Empire" title="wikilink">Western Roman Empire</a>. His general <a href="Belisarius" class="uri" title="wikilink">Belisarius</a> swiftly conquered the <a href="Vandal_Kingdom" title="wikilink">Vandal Kingdom</a> in North Africa, extending Roman control to the <a href="Atlantic_Ocean" title="wikilink">Atlantic Ocean</a>. Subsequently Belisarius, <a href="Narses" class="uri" title="wikilink">Narses</a>, and other generals conquered the <a href="Ostrogothic_Kingdom" title="wikilink">Ostrogothic Kingdom</a>, restoring <a href="Dalmatia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Dalmatia</a>, <a href="Sicily" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sicily</a>, <a href="Italian_peninsula" title="wikilink">Italy</a>, and <a href="Rome" class="uri" title="wikilink">Rome</a> to the empire after being under barbarian control for over half a century. The <a href="praetorian_prefect" title="wikilink">prefect</a> <a href="Liberius_(praetorian_prefect)" title="wikilink">Liberius</a> reclaimed most of southern <a href="Iberian_peninsula" title="wikilink">Iberia</a>, establishing the province of <a href="Spania" class="uri" title="wikilink">Spania</a>. These campaigns re-established Roman control over the western Mediterranean, increasing the empire's annual revenue by over a million <a href="solidi" class="uri" title="wikilink">solidi</a>.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> During his reign Justinian also annexed <a href="Lazica" class="uri" title="wikilink">Lazica</a>, a region on the east coast of the <a href="Black_Sea" title="wikilink">Black Sea</a> never under Roman rule before.</p>
<p>A still more resonant aspect of his legacy was the uniform rewriting of Roman law, the <em><a href="Corpus_Juris_Civilis" title="wikilink">Corpus Juris Civilis</a></em>, which is still the basis of <a href="civil_law_(legal_system)" title="wikilink">civil law</a> in many modern states. His reign also marked a blossoming of Byzantine culture, and his building programme yielded such masterpieces as the church of <a href="Hagia_Sophia" title="wikilink">Hagia Sophia</a>, which was to be the center of <a href="Eastern_Orthodox_Church" title="wikilink">Eastern Orthodox Christianity</a> for many centuries.</p>
<p>A devastating outbreak of <a href="bubonic_plague" title="wikilink">bubonic plague</a> (see <a href="Plague_of_Justinian" title="wikilink">Plague of Justinian</a>) in the early 540s marked the end of an age of splendor. The empire entered a period of territorial decline not to be reversed until the ninth century.</p>
<p><a href="Procopius" class="uri" title="wikilink">Procopius</a> provides the primary source for the history of Justinian's reign. The <a href="Syriac" class="uri" title="wikilink">Syriac</a> chronicle of <a href="John_of_Ephesus" title="wikilink">John of Ephesus</a>, which does not survive, was used as a source for later chronicles, contributing many additional details of value. Both historians became very bitter towards Justinian and his empress, <a href="Theodora_(6th_century)" title="wikilink">Theodora</a>.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> Other sources include the histories of <a href="Agathias" class="uri" title="wikilink">Agathias</a>, <a href="Menander_Protector" title="wikilink">Menander Protector</a>, <a href="John_Malalas" title="wikilink">John Malalas</a>, the <a href="Paschal_Chronicle" title="wikilink">Paschal Chronicle</a>, the chronicles of <a href="Marcellinus_Comes" title="wikilink">Marcellinus Comes</a> and <a href="Victor_of_Tunnuna" title="wikilink">Victor of Tunnuna</a>.</p>
<p>Justinian is considered a <a href="saint" class="uri" title="wikilink">saint</a> amongst <a href="Eastern_Orthodox_Christians" title="wikilink">Eastern Orthodox Christians</a>, and is also commemorated by some <a href="Lutheran_Church" title="wikilink">Lutheran Churches</a>.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>

Another contemporary chronicler, <a href="Procopius" class="uri" title="wikilink">Procopius</a>, compares Justinian's appearance to that of tyrannical Emperor <a href="Domitian" class="uri" title="wikilink">Domitian</a>, although this is probably slander.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
<p>When Emperor <a href="Anastasius_I_(emperor)" title="wikilink">Anastasius</a> died in 518, Justin was proclaimed the new emperor, with significant help from Justinian.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> During Justin's reign (518&lt;U+2013&gt;527), Justinian was the emperor's close confidant. Justinian showed much ambition, and it has been thought that he was functioning as virtual regent long before Justin made him associate emperor on 1 April 527, although there is no conclusive evidence for this.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> As Justin became senile near the end of his reign, Justinian became the de facto ruler.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> Justinian was appointed <a href="consul" class="uri" title="wikilink">consul</a> in 521, and later commander of the army of the east.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a><a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> Upon <a href="Justin_I" title="wikilink">Justin I</a>'s death on 1 August 527, Justinian became the sole sovereign.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> <img src="JustinianITremissis.jpg" title="fig:Tremissis of emperor Justinian." alt="Tremissis of emperor Justinian." width="300" /> As a ruler, Justinian showed great energy. He was known as &quot;the Emperor who never sleeps&quot; on account of his work habits. Nevertheless, he seems to have been amenable and easy to approach.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> Justinian's family came from a lowly and provincial background, and therefore he had no power base in the traditional aristocracy of Constantinople. Instead, he surrounded himself with men and women of extraordinary talent, whom he selected not on the basis of aristocratic origin, but on the basis of merit. Around 525 he married in Constantinople <a href="Theodora_(6th_century)" title="wikilink">Theodora</a>, who was by profession a <a href="courtesan" class="uri" title="wikilink">courtesan</a> about 20 years his junior. Justinian would have, in earlier times, been unable to marry her because of her class, but his uncle Emperor Justin I had passed a law allowing intermarriage between social classes.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> Theodora would become very influential in the politics of the Empire, and later emperors would follow Justinian's precedent in marrying outside the <a href="Aristocracy_(class)" title="wikilink">aristocratic</a> class. The marriage caused a scandal, but Theodora would prove to be very intelligent, &quot;street smart&quot;, a good judge of character and Justinian's greatest supporter. Other talented individuals included <a href="Tribonian" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tribonian</a>, his legal adviser; <a href="Peter_the_Patrician" title="wikilink">Peter the Patrician</a>, the diplomat and longtime head of the palace bureaucracy; his finance ministers <a href="John_the_Cappadocian" title="wikilink">John the Cappadocian</a> and <a href="Peter_Barsymes" title="wikilink">Peter Barsymes</a>, who managed to collect taxes more efficiently than any before, thereby funding Justinian's wars; and finally, his prodigiously talented general <a href="Belisarius" class="uri" title="wikilink">Belisarius</a>.</p>
<p>Justinian's rule was not universally popular; early in his reign he almost lost his throne during the <a href="Nika_riots" title="wikilink">Nika riots</a>, and a conspiracy against the emperor's life by dissatisfied businessmen was discovered as late as 562.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a></p>
<p>Justinian was struck by the <a href="plague_of_Justinian" title="wikilink">plague</a> in the early 540s but recovered. Theodora died in 548, perhaps of cancer,<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> at a relatively young age; Justinian outlived her by almost twenty years. Justinian, who had always had a keen interest in theological matters and actively participated in debates on Christian doctrine,<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> became even more devoted to religion during the later years of his life. When he died, on the night of November 13&lt;U+2013&gt;14 of the year 565, he left no children. He was succeeded by <a href="Justin_II" title="wikilink">Justin II</a>, who was the son of his sister Vigilantia, and married to Sophia, the niece of Empress Theodora. Justinian's body was entombed in a specially built mausoleum in the <a href="Church_of_the_Holy_Apostles" title="wikilink">Church of the Holy Apostles</a>.</p>
<h3 id="legislative-activities">Legislative activities</h3>

<p><img src="Diptych_Barberini_Louvre_OA9063_whole.jpg" title="fig:The Barberini Ivory, which is thought to portray either Justinian or Anastasius I." alt="The Barberini Ivory, which is thought to portray either Justinian or Anastasius I." width="250" /> Justinian achieved lasting fame through his judicial reforms, particularly through the complete revision of all <a href="Roman_law" title="wikilink">Roman law</a>,<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> something that had not previously been attempted. The total of Justinian's legislature is known today as the <em><a href="Corpus_juris_civilis" title="wikilink">Corpus juris civilis</a></em>. It consists of the <em><a href="Codex_Justinianus" title="wikilink">Codex Justinianus</a></em>, the <em>Digesta</em> or <em><a href="Pandectae" class="uri" title="wikilink">Pandectae</a></em>, the <em><a href="Institutiones" class="uri" title="wikilink">Institutiones</a></em>, and the <em><a href="Novellae_Constitutiones" title="wikilink">Novellae</a></em>.</p>
<p>Early in his reign, Justinian appointed the <em><a href="quaestor_sacri_palatii" title="wikilink">quaestor</a></em> <a href="Tribonian" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tribonian</a> to oversee this task. The first draft of the <em><a href="Codex_Justinianus" title="wikilink">Codex Justinianus</a></em>, a codification of imperial constitutions from the 2nd century onward, was issued on 7 April 529. (The final version appeared in 534.) It was followed by the <em>Digesta</em> (or <em><a href="Pandectae" class="uri" title="wikilink">Pandectae</a></em>), a compilation of older legal texts, in 533, and by the <em><a href="Institutiones" class="uri" title="wikilink">Institutiones</a></em>, a textbook explaining the principles of law. The <em><a href="Novellae_Constitutiones" title="wikilink">Novellae</a></em>, a collection of new laws issued during Justinian's reign, supplements the <em>Corpus</em>. As opposed to the rest of the corpus, the <em>Novellae</em> appeared in <a href="Greek_language" title="wikilink">Greek</a>, the common language of the Eastern Empire.</p>
<p>The <em>Corpus</em> forms the basis of Latin jurisprudence (including ecclesiastical <a href="Canon_law_(Catholic_Church)" title="wikilink">Canon Law</a>) and, for historians, provides a valuable insight into the concerns and activities of the later Roman Empire. As a collection it gathers together the many sources in which the <em>leges</em> (laws) and the other rules were expressed or published: proper laws, <a href="Roman_Senate" title="wikilink">senatorial</a> consults (<em>senatusconsulta</em>), imperial decrees, <a href="case_law" title="wikilink">case law</a>, and jurists' opinions and interpretations (<em>responsa prudentum</em>).</p>
<p>Tribonian's code ensured the survival of Roman law. It formed the basis of later Byzantine law, as expressed in the <em><a href="Basilika" class="uri" title="wikilink">Basilika</a></em> of <a href="Basil_I" title="wikilink">Basil I</a> and <a href="Leo_VI_the_Wise" title="wikilink">Leo VI the Wise</a>. The only western province where the Justinianic code was introduced was Italy (after the conquest, by the so-called <a href="Pragmatic_Sanction" title="wikilink">Pragmatic Sanction</a> of 554),<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> from where it was to pass to <a href="Western_Europe" title="wikilink">Western Europe</a> in the 12th century and become the basis of much European law code. It eventually passed to <a href="Eastern_Europe" title="wikilink">Eastern Europe</a> where it appeared in Slavic editions, and it also passed on to <a href="Russia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Russia</a>.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> It remains influential to this day.</p>
<p>In order to marry Theodora, he abolished the law which forbade actresses to marry men of senatorial class. He also passed laws to protect prostitutes from exploitation and women being forced into prostitution. Rapists were treated severely. Women charged with major crimes should be guarded by other women to prevent sexual abuse. After a woman got widowed, her dowry should be returned and a husband could not take on a major debt without his wife giving her consent twice.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="nika-riots">Nika riots</h3>

<p>Justinian's habit of choosing efficient, but unpopular advisors nearly cost him his throne early in his reign. In January 532, partisans of the <a href="chariot_racing" title="wikilink">chariot racing</a> factions in Constantinople, normally divided among themselves, united against Justinian in a revolt that has become known as the <a href="Nika_riots" title="wikilink">Nika riots</a>. They forced him to dismiss <a href="Tribonian" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tribonian</a> and two of his other ministers, and then attempted to overthrow Justinian himself and replace him by the senator <a href="Hypatius_(consul_500)" title="wikilink">Hypatius</a>, who was a nephew of the late emperor <a href="Anastasius_I_(emperor)" title="wikilink">Anastasius</a>. While the crowd was rioting in the streets, Justinian considered fleeing the capital, but he remained in the city on the stirring words of <a href="Theodora_(6th_century)" title="wikilink">Theodora</a> (according to Procopius, she said &quot;For an Emperor to become a fugitive is not a thing to be endured...I hold with the old saying that the purple makes an excellent shroud&quot;.) In the next two days, he ordered the brutal suppression of the riots by his generals <a href="Belisarius" class="uri" title="wikilink">Belisarius</a> and <a href="Mundus_(general)" title="wikilink">Mundus</a>. Procopius relates that 30,000<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> unarmed civilians were killed in the Hippodrome. On Theodora's insistence, and apparently against his own judgment,<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> Justinian had Anastasius' nephews executed.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a></p>
<p>The destruction that had taken place during the revolt provided Justinian with an opportunity to tie his name to a series of splendid new buildings, most notably the architectural innovation of the domed <a href="Hagia_Sophia" title="wikilink">Hagia Sophia</a>.</p>
<h3 id="military-activities">Military activities</h3>

<p>One of the most spectacular features of Justinian's reign was the recovery of large stretches of land around the Western Mediterranean basin which had slipped out of imperial control in the 5th century.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> As a Christian Roman emperor, Justinian considered it his divine duty to restore the <a href="Roman_Empire" title="wikilink">Roman Empire</a> to its ancient boundaries. Although he never personally took part in military campaigns, he boasted of his successes in the prefaces to his laws and had them commemorated in art.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> The reconquests were in large part carried out by his general <a href="Belisarius" class="uri" title="wikilink">Belisarius</a>.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a></p>
<h4 id="war-with-the-sassanid-empire-527u2013532">War with the Sassanid Empire, 527&lt;U+2013&gt;532</h4>

<p>From his uncle, Justinian inherited ongoing hostilities with the <a href="Sassanid_Empire" title="wikilink">Sassanid Empire</a>.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> In 530 a Persian army was defeated at <a href="Battle_of_Dara" title="wikilink">Dara</a>, but the next year saw the defeat of Roman forces under Belisarius near <a href="Battle_of_Callinicum" title="wikilink">Callinicum</a>. When king <a href="Kavadh_I_of_Persia" title="wikilink">Kavadh I of Persia</a> died (September 531), Justinian concluded an &quot;<a href="Eternal_Peace_(532)" title="wikilink">Eternal Peace</a>&quot; (which cost him 11,000 pounds of gold)<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> with his successor <a href="Khosrau_I" title="wikilink">Khosrau I</a> (532). Having thus secured his eastern frontier, Justinian turned his attention to the West, where <a href="Arianism" title="wikilink">Arian</a> <a href="Germanic_peoples" title="wikilink">Germanic</a> kingdoms had been established in the territories of the former <a href="Western_Roman_Empire" title="wikilink">Western Roman Empire</a>.</p>

King <a href="Hilderic" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hilderic</a>, who had maintained good relations with Justinian and the North African <a href="Roman_Catholic_Church" title="wikilink">Catholic</a> clergy, had been overthrown by his cousin <a href="Gelimer" class="uri" title="wikilink">Gelimer</a> in 530.

<p>In 533, <a href="Belisarius" class="uri" title="wikilink">Belisarius</a> with a fleet of 92 <a href="dromon" title="wikilink">dromons</a> escorting 500 transports, landed at <a href="Chebba#History" title="wikilink">Caput Vada (modern Ras Kaboudia)</a> in modern <a href="Tunisia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tunisia</a> with an army of about 15,000 men, as well as a number of barbarian troops.

King <a href="Gelimer" class="uri" title="wikilink">Gelimer</a> fled to Mount Pappua in <a href="Numidia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Numidia</a>, but surrendered the next spring.

<p>As in Africa, dynastic struggles in <a href="Ostrogothic_Italy" title="wikilink">Ostrogothic Italy</a> provided an opportunity for intervention. The young king <a href="Athalaric" class="uri" title="wikilink">Athalaric</a> had died on 2 October 534, and an usurper, <a href="Theodahad" class="uri" title="wikilink">Theodahad</a>, had imprisoned queen <a href="Amalasuntha" class="uri" title="wikilink">Amalasuntha</a>, <a href="Theodoric_the_Great" title="wikilink">Theodoric</a>'s daughter and mother of Athalaric, on the island of Martana in <a href="Lake_Bolsena" title="wikilink">Lake Bolsena</a>, where he had her assassinated in 535. Thereupon <a href="Belisarius" class="uri" title="wikilink">Belisarius</a> with 7,500 men<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a> invaded <a href="Sicily" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sicily</a> (535) and advanced into Italy, sacking <a href="Naples" class="uri" title="wikilink">Naples</a> and capturing <a href="Rome" class="uri" title="wikilink">Rome</a> on 9 December 536. By that time <a href="Theodahad" class="uri" title="wikilink">Theodahad</a> had been deposed by the <a href="Ostrogoths" title="wikilink">Ostrogothic</a> army, who had elected <a href="Vitigis" class="uri" title="wikilink">Vitigis</a> as their new king. He gathered a large army and besieged <a href="Rome" class="uri" title="wikilink">Rome</a> from February 537 to March 538 without being able to retake the city. Justinian sent another general, <a href="Narses" class="uri" title="wikilink">Narses</a>, to Italy, but tensions between Narses and Belisarius hampered the progress of the campaign. <a href="Milan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Milan</a> was taken, but was soon recaptured and razed by the Ostrogoths. Justinian recalled <a href="Narses" class="uri" title="wikilink">Narses</a> in 539. By then the military situation had turned in favour of the Romans, and in 540 Belisarius reached the Ostrogothic capital <a href="Ravenna" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ravenna</a>. There he was offered the title of <a href="Western_Roman_Emperor" title="wikilink">Western Roman Emperor</a> by the Ostrogoths at the same time that envoys of Justinian were arriving to negotiate a peace which would leave the region north of the <a href="Po_River" title="wikilink">Po River</a> in Gothic hands. Belisarius feigned to accept the offer, entered the city in May 540, and reclaimed it for the Empire.<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> Then, having been recalled by Justinian, Belisarius returned to Constantinople, taking the captured <a href="Vitigis" class="uri" title="wikilink">Vitigis</a> and his wife <a href="Matasuntha" class="uri" title="wikilink">Matasuntha</a> with him.</p>

Following a revolt against Byzantium in <a href="Marzpanate_Period" title="wikilink">Armenia</a> in the late 530s and possibly motivated by the pleas of <a href="Ostrogoths" title="wikilink">Ostrogothic</a> ambassadors, King <a href="Khosrau_I" title="wikilink">Khosrau I</a> broke the &quot;Eternal Peace&quot; and invaded Roman territory in the spring of 540.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a> He first sacked <a href="Aleppo" title="wikilink">Beroea</a> and then <a href="Antioch" class="uri" title="wikilink">Antioch</a> (allowing the garrison of 6,000 men to leave the city),<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a> besieged <a href="Daras" class="uri" title="wikilink">Daras</a>, and then went on to attack the small but strategically significant satellite kingdom of <a href="Lazic_War" title="wikilink">Lazica</a> near the <a href="Black_Sea" title="wikilink">Black Sea</a>, exacting tribute from the towns he passed along his way. He forced Justinian I to pay him 5,000 pounds of gold, plus 500 pounds of gold more each year.<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a></p>
<p>Belisarius arrived in the East in 541, but, after some success, was again recalled to Constantinople in 542. The reasons for his withdrawal are not known, but it may have been instigated by rumours of disloyalty on behalf of the general reaching the court.<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a> The outbreak of the <a href="Plague_of_Justinian" title="wikilink">plague</a> caused a lull in the fighting during the year 543.

Both parties made little headway, and in 545 a truce was agreed upon for the southern part of the Roman-Persian frontier. After that the <a href="Lazic_War" title="wikilink">Lazic War</a> in the North continued for several years, until a second truce in 557, followed by a Fifty Years' Peace in 562. Under its terms, the Persians agreed to abandon Lazica in exchange for an annual tribute of 400 or 500 pounds of gold (30,000 <em>solidi</em>) to be paid by the Romans.<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a></p>
<h4 id="war-in-italy-second-phase-541u2013554">War in Italy, second phase, 541&lt;U+2013&gt;554</h4>
<p>While military efforts were directed to the East, the situation in Italy took a turn for the worse. Under their respective kings <a href="Ildibad" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ildibad</a> and <a href="Eraric" class="uri" title="wikilink">Eraric</a> (both murdered in 541) and especially <a href="Totila" class="uri" title="wikilink">Totila</a>, the Ostrogoths made quick gains. After a <a href="Battle_of_Faventia" title="wikilink">victory</a> at <a href="Faenza" class="uri" title="wikilink">Faenza</a> in 542, they reconquered the major cities of Southern Italy and soon held almost the entire peninsula. Belisarius was sent back to Italy late in 544, but lacked sufficient troops. Making no headway, he was relieved of his command in 548. Belisarius succeeded in defeating a <a href="Goths" title="wikilink">Gothic</a> fleet with 200 ships. During this period the city of <a href="Rome" class="uri" title="wikilink">Rome</a> changed hands three more times, first taken and depopulated by the Ostrogoths in December 546, then reconquered by the Byzantines in 547, and then again by the Goths in January 550. Totila also plundered <a href="Sicily" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sicily</a> and attacked the Greek coastlines. Finally, Justinian dispatched a force of approximately 35,000 men (2,000 men were detached and sent to invade southern <a href="Visigothic" class="uri" title="wikilink">Visigothic</a> <a href="Spain" class="uri" title="wikilink">Spain</a>) under the command of <a href="Narses" class="uri" title="wikilink">Narses</a>.<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a> The army reached Ravenna in June 552, and defeated the Ostrogoths decisively within a month at the battle of <a href="Battle_of_Busta_Gallorum" title="wikilink">Busta Gallorum</a> in the <a href="Apennine_Mountains" title="wikilink">Apennines</a>, where Totila was slain. After a second battle at <a href="Battle_of_Mons_Lactarius" title="wikilink">Mons Lactarius</a> in October that year, the resistance of the Ostrogoths was finally broken. In 554, a large-scale <a href="Franks" title="wikilink">Frankish</a> invasion was defeated at <a href="Battle_of_Casilinum" title="wikilink">Casilinum</a>, and Italy secured for the Empire, even though it would take Narses several years to reduce the remaining Gothic strongholds. At the end of the war, Italy was garrisoned with an army of 16,000 men.<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a> The recovery of Italy cost the empire about 300,000 pounds of gold.<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a></p>

British Museum." /> In addition to the other conquests, the Eastern Empire established a presence in <a href="Visigothic" class="uri" title="wikilink">Visigothic</a> <a href="Spain" class="uri" title="wikilink">Spain</a>, when the usurper <a href="Athanagild" class="uri" title="wikilink">Athanagild</a> requested assistance in his rebellion against king <a href="Agila" class="uri" title="wikilink">Agila</a>. In 552, Justinian dispatched a force of 2,000 men under the octogenarian <a href="Liberius_(praetorian_prefect)" title="wikilink">Liberius</a>, who had served under the Ostrogoth kings of Italy since the 490s. The Byzantines took <a href="Cartagena,_Spain" title="wikilink">Cartagena</a> and other cities on the southeastern coast and founded the new province of <a href="Spania" class="uri" title="wikilink">Spania</a> before being checked by their former ally Athanagild, who had by now become king. This campaign marked the apogee of Byzantine expansion.</p>
<p>During Justinian's reign, the <a href="Balkans" class="uri" title="wikilink">Balkans</a> suffered from several incursions by the <a href="Turkic_peoples" title="wikilink">Turkic</a> and <a href="Slavic_peoples" title="wikilink">Slavic peoples</a> who lived north of the <a href="Danube" class="uri" title="wikilink">Danube</a>. Here, Justinian resorted mainly to a combination of diplomacy and a system of defensive works. In 559 a particularly dangerous invasion of <a href="Slavic_peoples" title="wikilink">Sklavinoi</a> and <a href="Kutrigurs" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kutrigurs</a> under their <a href="Khan_(title)" title="wikilink">khan</a> <a href="Zabergan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Zabergan</a> threatened Constantinople, but they were repulsed by the aged general Belisarius.</p>

In the West, the brilliant early military successes of the 530s were followed by years of stagnation. The dragging war with the Goths was a disaster for Italy, even though its long-lasting effects may have been less severe than is sometimes thought.<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a> The heavy taxes that the administration imposed upon its population were deeply resented. While the final victory in Italy and the conquest of the coast of southern Spain significantly enlarged the area over which Byzantium could project its power and influence, and while they must have contributed to the empire's prestige, most of the conquests proved ephemeral. The greater part of Italy would be lost to the invading <a href="Lombards" class="uri" title="wikilink">Lombards</a> three years after Justinian's death (568), the newly founded province of Spania was completely recovered by the Spanish Visigoths in 624 under the leadership of <a href="Suintila" class="uri" title="wikilink">Suintila</a>, and within a century and a half Africa would be forever lost for the empire to the <a href="Rashidun_Caliphate" title="wikilink">Rashidun</a> and <a href="Umayyad_Caliphate" title="wikilink">Umayyad Caliphates</a> during the <a href="Muslim_conquests" title="wikilink">Muslim conquests</a>.</p>
<p>Events of the later years of the reign showed that Constantinople itself was not safe from barbarian incursions from the north, and even the relatively benevolent historian <a href="Menander_Protector" title="wikilink">Menander Protector</a> felt the need to explain the emperor's failure to protect the capital from the weakness of his body in his old age.<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a> In his efforts to renew the old Roman Empire, Justinian dangerously stretched the resources of the Eastern Empire while failing to take into account the changed realities of 6th-century Europe.<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a> Paradoxically, the grand scale of Justinian's military successes probably contributed in part to the empire's subsequent decline.<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="religious-activities">Religious activities</h2>
<p>Justinian saw the orthodoxy of his empire threatened by diverging religious currents, especially <a href="Monophysitism" class="uri" title="wikilink">Monophysitism</a>, which had many adherents in the eastern provinces of Syria and Egypt. Monophysite doctrine had been condemned as a <a href="heresy" class="uri" title="wikilink">heresy</a> by the <a href="Council_of_Chalcedon" title="wikilink">Council of Chalcedon</a> in 451, and the tolerant policies towards Monophysitism of <a href="Zeno_(emperor)" title="wikilink">Zeno</a> and <a href="Anastasius_I_(emperor)" title="wikilink">Anastasius I</a> had been a source of tension in the relationship with the bishops of Rome. Justin reversed this trend and confirmed the Chalcedonian doctrine, openly condemning the Monophysites. Justinian, who continued this policy, tried to impose religious unity on his subjects by forcing them to accept doctrinal compromises that might appeal to all parties, a policy which proved unsuccessful as he satisfied none of them. Near the end of his life, Justinian became ever more inclined towards the Monophysite doctrine, especially in the form of <a href="Aphthartodocetae" title="wikilink">Aphthartodocetism</a>, but he died before being able to issue any legislation which would have elevated its teachings to the status of dogma. The empress Theodora sympathised with the Monophysites and is said to have been a constant source of pro-Monophysite intrigues at the court in Constantinople in the earlier years. In the course of his reign Justinian, who had a genuine interest in matters of theology, authored a small number of theological treatises.<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a></p>

<p>As with his secular administration, <a href="despotism" class="uri" title="wikilink">despotism</a> appeared also in the emperor's ecclesiastical policy. He regulated everything, both in religion and in law.</p>
<p>At the very beginning of his reign, he deemed it proper to promulgate by law the Church's belief in the <a href="Trinity" class="uri" title="wikilink">Trinity</a> and the <a href="Incarnation" class="uri" title="wikilink">Incarnation</a>; and to threaten all <a href="Christian_heresy" title="wikilink">heretics</a> with the appropriate penalties;<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a> whereas he subsequently declared that he intended to deprive all disturbers of orthodoxy of the opportunity for such offense by <a href="due_process" title="wikilink">due process</a> of law.<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a> He made the Nicaeno-Constantinopolitan creed the sole symbol of the Church,<a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a> and accorded legal force to the <a href="canon_law" title="wikilink">canons</a> of the four <a href="ecumenical" class="uri" title="wikilink">ecumenical</a> councils.<a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a> The bishops in attendance at the <a href="Second_Council_of_Constantinople" title="wikilink">Second Council of Constantinople</a> in 553 recognized that nothing could be done in the Church contrary to the emperor's will and command;<a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a> while, on his side, the emperor, in the case of the <a href="Patriarch_Anthimus_I_of_Constantinople" title="wikilink">Patriarch Anthimus</a>, reinforced the ban of the Church with temporal proscription.<a href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a> Justinian protected the purity of the church by suppressing heretics. He neglected no opportunity for securing the rights of the Church and <a href="clergy" class="uri" title="wikilink">clergy</a>, for protecting and extending <a href="monasticism" class="uri" title="wikilink">monasticism</a>. He granted the monks the right to inherit property from private citizens and the right to receive solemnia or annual gifts from the imperial treasury or from the taxes of certain provinces and he prohibited lay confiscation on monastic estates.</p>
<p>Although the despotic character of his measures is contrary to modern sensibilities, he was indeed a &quot;nursing father&quot; of the Church. Both the <em>Codex</em> and the <em>Novellae</em> contain many enactments regarding donations, foundations, and the administration of ecclesiastical property; election and rights of bishops, priests and abbots; monastic life, residential obligations of the clergy, conduct of divine service, episcopal jurisdiction, etc. Justinian also rebuilt the Church of <a href="Hagia_Sophia" title="wikilink">Hagia Sophia</a> (which cost 20,000 pounds of gold),<a href="#fn67" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a> the original site having been destroyed during the Nika riots. The new Hagia Sophia, with its numerous chapels and shrines, gilded octagonal dome, and <a href="mosaic" title="wikilink">mosaics</a>, became the centre and most visible monument of <a href="Eastern_Orthodoxy" title="wikilink">Eastern Orthodoxy</a> in Constantinople.</p>
<h3 id="religious-relations-with-rome">Religious relations with Rome</h3>
<p>From the middle of the fifth century onward increasingly arduous tasks confronted the emperors of the East in ecclesiastical matters. For one thing, the radicals on all sides felt themselves constantly repelled by the creed adopted by the <a href="Council_of_Chalcedon" title="wikilink">Council of Chalcedon</a> to defend the biblical doctrine of the nature of Christ and bridge the gap between the <a href="dogma" title="wikilink">dogmatic</a> parties. The letter of <a href="Pope_Leo_I" title="wikilink">Pope Leo I</a> to <a href="Flavian_of_Constantinople" title="wikilink">Flavian of Constantinople</a> was widely considered in the East as the work of <a href="Satan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Satan</a>; so that nobody cared to hear of the Church of Rome. The emperors, however, had a policy of preserving the unity between Constantinople and <a href="Rome" class="uri" title="wikilink">Rome</a>; and this remained possible only if they did not swerve from the line defined at <a href="Council_of_Chalcedon" title="wikilink">Chalcedon</a>. In addition, the factions in the East which had become stirred up and disaffected because of Chalcedon needed restraining and pacifying. This problem proved the more difficult because, in the East, the dissenting groups exceeded supporters of Chalcedon both in numerical strength and in intellectual ability. Tension from the incompatibility of the two aims grew: whoever chose Rome and the West must renounce the East, and vice versa.</p>

<p>Justinian entered the arena of ecclesiastical statecraft shortly after his uncle's accession in 518, and put an end to the <a href="Monophysitism" title="wikilink">Monophysite</a> <a href="Schism_(religion)" title="wikilink">schism</a> that had prevailed between Rome and Constantinople since 483. The recognition of the <a href="Holy_See" title="wikilink">Roman see</a> as the highest ecclesiastical authority<a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a> remained the cornerstone of his Western policy. Offensive as it was to many in the East, nonetheless Justinian felt himself entirely free to take a Despotic stance toward the <a href="pope" title="wikilink">popes</a> such as <a href="Silverius" class="uri" title="wikilink">Silverius</a> and <a href="Vigilius" class="uri" title="wikilink">Vigilius</a>. While no compromise could ever be accepted by the dogmatic wing of the church, his sincere efforts at reconciliation gained him the approval of the major body of the church. A signal proof was his attitude in the <a href="Scythian_monks#Theopaschite_doctrine" title="wikilink">Theopaschite controversy</a>. At the outset he was of the opinion that the question turned on a quibble of words. By degrees, however, Justinian came to understand that the formula at issue not only appeared orthodox, but might also serve as a conciliatory measure toward the Monophysites, and he made a vain attempt to do this in the religious conference with the followers of <a href="Severus_of_Antioch" title="wikilink">Severus of Antioch</a>, in 533.</p>
<p>Again, Justinian moved toward compromise in the religious edict of 15 March 533,<a href="#fn69" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref69"><sup>69</sup></a> and congratulated himself that <a href="Pope_John_II" title="wikilink">Pope John II</a> admitted the orthodoxy of the imperial confession.<a href="#fn70" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a> The serious blunder that he had made at the beginning by abetting a severe persecution of the Monophysite bishops and monks and thereby embittering the population of vast regions and provinces, he remedied eventually. His constant aim now remained to win over the Monophysites, yet not to surrender the Chalcedonian faith. For many at court, he did not go far enough: Theodora especially would have rejoiced to see the Monophysites favored unreservedly. Justinian, however, felt restrained by the complications that would have ensued with the West. But in the condemnation of the <a href="Three-Chapter_Controversy" title="wikilink"><em>Three Chapters</em></a> Justinian tried to satisfy both the East and the West, but succeeded in satisfying neither. Although the pope assented to the condemnation, the West believed that the emperor had acted contrary to the decrees of Chalcedon. Though many delegates emerged in the East subservient to Justinian, many, especially the Monophysites, remained unsatisfied; all the more bitter for him because during his last years he took an even greater interest in theological matters.</p>

<p>Justinian's religious policy reflected the imperial conviction that the unity of the Empire unconditionally presupposed unity of faith; and it appeared to him obvious that this faith could be only the <a href="Nicene_Christianity" title="wikilink">Orthodox</a> (Nicaean). Those of a different belief had to recognize that the process of consolidation, which imperial legislation had effected from the time of <a href="Constantius_II" title="wikilink">Constantius II</a>, would now vigorously continue. The <em>Codex</em> contained two <a href="statute" title="wikilink">statutes</a><a href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a> which decreed the total destruction of <a href="paganism" class="uri" title="wikilink">paganism</a>, even in private life; these provisions were zealously enforced. Contemporary sources (<a href="John_Malalas" title="wikilink">John Malalas</a>, <a href="Theophanes_the_Confessor" title="wikilink">Theophanes</a>, <a href="John_of_Ephesus" title="wikilink">John of Ephesus</a>) tell of severe persecutions, even of men in high position.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most noteworthy event occurred in 529 when the <a href="Neoplatonic_Academy" title="wikilink">Neoplatonic Academy</a> of <a href="Athens" class="uri" title="wikilink">Athens</a> was placed under state control by order of Justinian, effectively strangling this training-school for Hellenism. <a href="Paganism" class="uri" title="wikilink">Paganism</a> was actively suppressed.

<p>The <a href="Jew" title="wikilink">Jews</a> were also persecuted, their civil rights were restricted<a href="#fn82" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref82"><sup>82</sup></a> and their religious privileges threatened.<a href="#fn83" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref83"><sup>83</sup></a> Justinian also interfered in the internal affairs of the <a href="synagogue" class="uri" title="wikilink">synagogue</a>.<a href="#fn84" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref84"><sup>84</sup></a> However, he did not violently persecute the Jews, but nevertheless encouraged them to use the Greek <a href="Septuagint" class="uri" title="wikilink">Septuagint</a> in their synagogues in Constantinople.<a href="#fn85" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref85"><sup>85</sup></a></p>
<p>The emperor had much trouble with the <a href="Samaritan" title="wikilink">Samaritans</a>, resisting conversion to Christianity and repeatedly in insurrection. He opposed them with rigorous edicts, but yet could not prevent hostilities towards Christians from taking place in <a href="Samaria" class="uri" title="wikilink">Samaria</a> toward the close of his reign. The consistency of Justinian's policy meant that the <a href="Manicheans" class="uri" title="wikilink">Manicheans</a> too suffered severe persecution, experiencing both exile and threat of capital punishment.<a href="#fn86" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref86"><sup>86</sup></a> At <a href="Constantinople" class="uri" title="wikilink">Constantinople</a>, on one occasion, not a few Manicheans, after strict inquisition, were executed in the emperor's very presence: some by burning, others by <a href="drowning" class="uri" title="wikilink">drowning</a>.<a href="#fn87" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref87"><sup>87</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="building-activities-learning-art-and-literature">Building activities, learning, art and literature</h2>
<p>Justinian was a prolific builder; the historian Procopius bears witness to his activities in this area.<a href="#fn88" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref88"><sup>88</sup></a> Under Justinian's patronage the <a href="Basilica_of_San_Vitale" title="wikilink">San Vitale</a> in Ravenna, which features two famous mosaics representing Justinian and Theodora, was completed.<a href="#fn89" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref89"><sup>89</sup></a> Most notably, he had the <a href="Hagia_Sophia" title="wikilink">Hagia Sophia</a>, originally a <a href="basilica" class="uri" title="wikilink">basilica</a> style church that had been burnt down during the <a href="Nika_riots" title="wikilink">Nika riots</a>, splendidly rebuilt according to a completely different ground plan, under the architectural supervision of <a href="Isidore_of_Miletus" title="wikilink">Isidore of Miletus</a> and <a href="Anthemius_of_Tralles" title="wikilink">Anthemius of Tralles</a>. According to Procopius, Justinian stated at the completion of this edifice, &quot;Solomon I have outdone thee&quot; (in reference to the 1st Jewish temple). This new cathedral, with its magnificent dome filled with mosaics, remained the centre of eastern Christianity for centuries. Another prominent church in the capital, the <a href="Church_of_the_Holy_Apostles" title="wikilink">Church of the Holy Apostles</a>, which had been in a very poor state near the end of the 5th century, was likewise rebuilt.<a href="#fn90" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref90"><sup>90</sup></a> Works of embellishment were not confined to churches alone: excavations at the site of the <a href="Great_Palace_of_Constantinople" title="wikilink">Great Palace of Constantinople</a> have yielded several high-quality mosaics dating from Justinian's reign, and a <a href="Column_of_Justinian" title="wikilink">column topped by a bronze statue</a> of Justinian on horseback and dressed in a military costume was erected in the <a href="Augustaeum" class="uri" title="wikilink">Augustaeum</a> in Constantinople in 543.<a href="#fn91" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref91"><sup>91</sup></a> Rivalry with other, more established patrons from the Constantinopolitan and exiled Roman aristocracy (like <a href="Anicia_Juliana" title="wikilink">Anicia Juliana</a>) may have enforced Justinian's building activities in the capital as a means of strengthening his dynasty's prestige.<a href="#fn92" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref92"><sup>92</sup></a></p>
<p>Justinian also strengthened the borders of the empire from Africa to the East through the construction of fortifications, and ensured Constantinople of its water supply through construction of underground <a href="cisterns" class="uri" title="wikilink">cisterns</a>. To prevent floods from damaging the strategically important border town <a href="Dara_(Mesopotamia)" title="wikilink">Dara</a>, <a href="Dara_Dam" title="wikilink">an advanced arch dam</a> was built. During his reign the large <a href="Sangarius_Bridge" title="wikilink">Sangarius Bridge</a> was built in <a href="Bithynia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bithynia</a>, securing a major military supply route to the east. Furthermore, Justinian restored cities damaged by earthquake or war and built a new city near his place of birth called <a href="Justiniana_Prima" title="wikilink">Justiniana Prima</a>, which was intended to replace <a href="Thessalonica" class="uri" title="wikilink">Thessalonica</a> as the political and religious center of the <a href="Praetorian_prefecture_of_Illyricum" title="wikilink">Illyricum</a>.</p>
<p>In Justinian's era, and partly under his patronage, Byzantine culture produced noteworthy historians, including <a href="Procopius" class="uri" title="wikilink">Procopius</a> and <a href="Agathias" class="uri" title="wikilink">Agathias</a>, and poets such as <a href="Paul_the_Silentiary" title="wikilink">Paul the Silentiary</a> and <a href="Romanus_the_Singer" title="wikilink">Romanus the Melodist</a> flourished during his reign. On the other hand, centers of learning as the Platonic Academy in Athens and the famous law school of <a href="Beirut" class="uri" title="wikilink">Beirut</a><a href="#fn93" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref93"><sup>93</sup></a> lost their importance during his reign. Despite Justinian's passion for the glorious Roman past, the practice of choosing <a href="Roman_consul" title="wikilink">Roman consul</a> was allowed to lapse after 541.<a href="#fn94" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref94"><sup>94</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="economy-and-administration">Economy and administration</h2>

<p><img src="Gold_coin_of_Justinian_I_527CE_565CE_excavated_in_India_probably_in_the_south.jpg" title="fig:Gold coin of Justinian I (527-565 CE) excavated in India probably in the south, an example of Indo-Roman trade during the period." alt="Gold coin of Justinian I (527-565 CE) excavated in India probably in the south, an example of Indo-Roman trade during the period." /> As was the case under Justinian's predecessors, the empire's economic health rested primarily on agriculture. In addition, long-distance trade flourished, reaching as far north as <a href="Cornwall" class="uri" title="wikilink">Cornwall</a> where <a href="tin" class="uri" title="wikilink">tin</a> was exchanged for Roman wheat.<a href="#fn95" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref95"><sup>95</sup></a> Within the empire, convoys sailing from <a href="Alexandria" class="uri" title="wikilink">Alexandria</a> provided Constantinople with wheat and grains. Justinian made the traffic more efficient by building a large granary on the island of <a href="Tenedos" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tenedos</a> for storage and further transport to Constantinople.<a href="#fn96" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref96"><sup>96</sup></a> Justinian also tried to find new routes for the eastern trade, which was suffering badly from the wars with the Persians. One important luxury product was <a href="silk" class="uri" title="wikilink">silk</a>, which was imported and then processed in the empire. In order to protect the manufacture of silk products, Justinian granted a monopoly to the imperial factories in 541.<a href="#fn97" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref97"><sup>97</sup></a> In order to bypass the Persian landroute, Justinian established friendly relations with the <a href="Habesha_people" title="wikilink">Abyssinians</a>, whom he wanted to act as trade mediators by transporting Indian silk to the empire; the Abyssinians, however, were unable to compete with the Persian merchants in India.<a href="#fn98" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref98"><sup>98</sup></a> Then, in the early 550s, two monks succeeded in smuggling eggs of silk worms from <a href="Central_Asia" title="wikilink">Central Asia</a> back to Constantinople,<a href="#fn99" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref99"><sup>99</sup></a> and silk became an indigenous Byzantine product.</p>
<p>Gold and silver were mined in the Balkans, Anatolia, Armenia,Cyprus, Egypt and Nubia.<a href="#fn100" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref100"><sup>100</sup></a></p>

<p>At the start of Justinian I's reign he had inherited a surplus 28,800,000 <em>solidi</em> (400,000 pounds of gold) in the imperial treasury from Anastasius I and <a href="Justin_I" title="wikilink">Justin I</a>.<a href="#fn101" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref101"><sup>101</sup></a> Under Justinian's rule, measures were taken to counter corruption in the provinces and to make tax collection more efficient. Greater administrative power was given to both the leaders of the <a href="prefectures" class="uri" title="wikilink">prefectures</a> and of the provinces, while power was taken away from the <a href="vicarius" title="wikilink">vicariates</a> of the <a href="dioceses" class="uri" title="wikilink">dioceses</a>, of which a number were abolished. The overall trend was towards a simplification of administrative infrastructure.<a href="#fn102" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref102"><sup>102</sup></a> According to Brown (1971), the increased professionalisation of tax collection did much to destroy the traditional structures of provincial life, as it weakened the autonomy of the town councils in the Greek towns.<a href="#fn103" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref103"><sup>103</sup></a> It has been estimated that before Justinian I's reconquests the state had an annual revenue of 5,000,000 <em>solidi</em> in AD 530, but after his reconquests, the annual revenue was increased to 6,000,000 <em>solidi</em> in AD 550.<a href="#fn104" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref104"><sup>104</sup></a></p>
<p>Throughout Justinian's reign, the cities and villages of the East prospered, although <a href="Antioch" class="uri" title="wikilink">Antioch</a> was struck by two earthquakes (526, 528) and sacked and evacuated by the Persians (540). Justinian had the city rebuilt, but on a slightly smaller scale.<a href="#fn105" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref105"><sup>105</sup></a> Some consider Justinian the &quot;<a href="Last_of_the_Romans" title="wikilink">Last of the Romans</a>,&quot; for he is the last Roman emperor to speak <a href="Latin" class="uri" title="wikilink">Latin</a>.</p>
<p>Despite all these measures, the empire suffered several major setbacks in the course of the 6th century. The first one was the <a href="Plague_of_Justinian" title="wikilink">plague</a>, which lasted from 541 to 543 and, by decimating the empire's population, probably created a scarcity of labour and a rising of wages.<a href="#fn106" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref106"><sup>106</sup></a> The lack of manpower also led to a significant increase in the number of &quot;barbarians&quot; in the Byzantine armies after the early 540s.<a href="#fn107" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref107"><sup>107</sup></a> The protracted war in Italy and the wars with the Persians themselves laid a heavy burden on the empire's resources, and Justinian was criticized for curtailing the government-run post service, which he limited to only one eastern route of military importance.<a href="#fn108" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref108"><sup>108</sup></a></p>
