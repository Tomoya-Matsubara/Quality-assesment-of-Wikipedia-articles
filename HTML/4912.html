In the case of Rusty Wallace's front-stretch crash at <a href="Bristol_Motor_Speedway" title="wikilink">Bristol Motor Speedway</a>, Punch happened to be on Pit Road at the time, and as a result, was the first person on the scene before the rescue crew could be scrambled. Punch's medical training proved pivotal, as Wallace was initially unconscious following this practice-session crash. Punch revived Wallace, who was able to start the following night's race with only minor injuries, driving for about half the race before giving his seat up to a relief driver.

Punch immediately rushed from the podium to the back of the room where Jenny Gill(daughter of singer/musician, <a href="Vince_Gill" title="wikilink">Vince Gill</a>), a Nashville Superspeedway intern, had fainted. Punch helped revive the <a href="Middle_Tennessee_State" title="wikilink">Middle Tennessee State</a> graduate student.
