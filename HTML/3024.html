<p><strong><a href="Capital_punishment" title="wikilink">Capital punishment</a></strong> is legal in <strong><a href="Singapore" class="uri" title="wikilink">Singapore</a></strong>. The city-state had the second highest per-capita execution rate in the world between 1994 and 1999, estimated by the <a href="United_Nations" title="wikilink">United Nations</a> to be 1.383 executions annually per hundred thousand of population during that period.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> The highest was <a href="Turkmenistan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Turkmenistan</a> (now an abolitionist country) with 1.492. Each execution in Singapore is carried out by <a href="hanging" class="uri" title="wikilink">hanging</a> in <a href="Changi_Prison" title="wikilink">Changi Prison</a> at dawn on Friday. Foreigners are not exempt from capital punishment.</p>
<p>Singapore has had capital punishment since it was a <a href="British_Empire#Britain&#39;s_&quot;Imperial_Century&quot;_(1815-1914)" title="wikilink">British colony</a> and became independent before the <a href="United_Kingdom" title="wikilink">United Kingdom</a> abolished capital punishment. The Singaporean procedure of hanging condemned individuals is heavily influenced by the methods formerly used in <a href="Great_Britain" title="wikilink">Great Britain</a>.</p>
<p>In 2012, however, the State amended its law to exempt some cases from the mandatory sentence while boosting enforcement. Although the penalty will stay, discretionary measures are now given to the judge. Singapore has one of the lowest crime rates in the world. <a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>

<p>Detailed statistics are not released by the government of Singapore from 2000 to 2006. Singapore's <a href="Prime_Minister_of_Singapore" title="wikilink">Prime Minister</a> <a href="Goh_Chok_Tong" title="wikilink">Goh Chok Tong</a> told the <a href="BBC" class="uri" title="wikilink">BBC</a> in September 2003 that he believed there were &quot;in the region of about 70 to 80&quot; hangings in 2003. Two days later he retracted his statement, saying the number was in fact ten.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<p>The chief executioner, Darshan Singh, said that he has executed more than 850 people during his service from 1959 using the phrase: &quot;I am going to send you to a better place than this. God bless you.&quot; This included 18 people on one day, using three ropes at a time. Singh also said that he has hanged 7 people within 90 minutes.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="foreign-nationals">Foreign nationals</h3>
<p>The people on death row include foreign nationals, many of whom were convicted of drug-related offences. These inmates come from a diverse group of countries including Australia, Malaysia, Hong Kong, Macau, China, Indonesia, Thailand, the Philippines, Bangladesh, India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Nigeria, Ghana, the Netherlands, United Kingdom and Portugal. Figures released by the Singapore government show that between 1993 to 2003, 36% of those executed were foreigners, including some residents in Singapore (one quarter of Singapore residents are foreigners).<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>

<p>Under Section 316 of the <a href="Criminal_law_of_Singapore#Criminal_procedure" title="wikilink">Criminal Procedure Code</a>:<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
<dl>

<dd>&quot;When any person is sentenced to death, the sentence shall direct that he shall be hanged by the neck till he is dead but shall not state the place where nor the time when the sentence is to be carried out.&quot;
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Hangings always take place at dawn on Friday and are by the <a href="Hanging#Long_drop" title="wikilink">long drop</a> method developed in the <a href="United_Kingdom" title="wikilink">United Kingdom</a> by <a href="William_Marwood" title="wikilink">William Marwood</a>. The executioner refers to the <a href="Official_Table_of_Drops" title="wikilink">Official Table of Drops</a>. The government have said that they:</p>
<dl>

<dd>&quot;&lt;U+2026&gt;had previously studied the different methods of execution and found no reason to change from the current method used, that is, by hanging.&quot;<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Neither persons under the age of 18 at the time of their offence nor pregnant women can be sentenced to death.</p>
<p>Capital cases are heard by a single judge in the <a href="High_Court_of_Singapore" title="wikilink">High Court of Singapore</a>. After conviction and sentencing, the sentenced has one appeal to the <a href="Court_of_Appeal_of_Singapore" title="wikilink">Court of Appeal of Singapore</a>. If the appeal fails, the final recourse rests with the <a href="President_of_Singapore" title="wikilink">President of Singapore</a>, who has the power to grant clemency on the advice of the Cabinet. The exact number of successful appeals is unknown. <a href="Poh_Kay_Keong" title="wikilink">Poh Kay Keong</a> had his conviction overturned after the Court found his statement to a Central Narcotics Bureau officer was made under duress.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> Successful clemency applications are thought to be even rarer. Since 1965, the President's clemency has been granted six times.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> The last clemency was in May 1998 when <a href="Mathavakannan_Kalimuthu" title="wikilink">Mathavakannan Kalimuthu</a> received pardon from President <a href="Ong_Teng_Cheong" title="wikilink">Ong Teng Cheong</a> with the sentence commuted to life imprisonment.</p>
<p>The condemned are given notice at least four days before execution. In the case of foreigners who have been sentenced to death, their families and diplomatic missions/embassies are given one to two weeks' notice.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a></p>
<p>Amnesty International reports that death row inmates are housed in cells of roughly 3 sqm (32 sq ft).<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> Walls make up three sides, while the fourth is vertical bars. They are equipped with a toilet, sleeping mat and a bucket for washing. Exercise is permitted twice a day for half an hour at a time.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> Four days before the execution, the condemned is allowed to watch television or listen to the radio.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> Special meals of their choice are also cooked, if within the prison budget. Visitation rights are increased from one 20 minute visit per week to a maximum of four hours each day,<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> though no physical contact is allowed with any visitors.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="capital-offences">Capital offences</h2>
<p>In addition to the Penal Code, there are four <a href="Act_of_Parliament" title="wikilink">Acts of Parliament</a> in Singapore that prescribe death as punishment for offences. According to the local <a href="civil_rights" title="wikilink">civil rights</a> group, the <a href="Think_Centre" title="wikilink">Think Centre</a>, 70% of hangings are for drug-related offences.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a></p>

<p>Furthermore, any person who has a controlled drug in his possession shall be presumed to have known the nature of that drug.</p>
<p>It would also be interesting to note that Singapore has one of the lowest prevalence of drug abuse worldwide. Over two decades, the number of drug abusers arrested each year has declined by two-thirds, from over 6,000 in the early 1990s to about 2,000 in 2011.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="internal-security-act">Internal Security Act</h3>

<h3 id="arms-offences-act">Arms Offences Act</h3>
<p>The <a href="Arms_Offences_Act_(Singapore)" title="wikilink">Arms Offences Act</a> regulates firearms offences.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> Any person who uses or attempts to use arms (Section 4) can face execution, as well as any person who uses or attempts to use arms to commit scheduled offences (Section 4A).

Any person who is an accomplice (Section 5) to a person convicted of arms use during a scheduled offence can likewise be executed.</p>
<p>Trafficking in arms (Section 6) is a capital offence in Singapore. Under the Arms Offences Act, trafficking is defined as being in unlawful possession of more than two firearms.</p>

<h2 id="public-debate">Public debate</h2>
<p>Public debate in the Singaporean news media on the death penalty is almost non-existent, although the topic does occasionally get discussed in the midst of major, well-known criminal cases. Efforts to garner public opinion on the issue are rare, although it has been suggested that the population is influenced by the traditional Chinese view which held that harsh punishment deters crime and helps maintain social peace and harmony.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> In October 2007, Senior Minister of State for Law and Home Affairs <a href="Ho_Peng_Kee" title="wikilink">Ho Peng Kee</a> said in Parliament that &quot;Certain of us may hold the view that the death penalty should be abolished. But in a survey done two years ago, reported in the Straits Times, 95% of Singaporeans feel that the death penalty should stay. This is something which has helped us to be safe and secure all these years and it is only reserved for a very few select offences.&quot;<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a></p>
<p><a href="Joshua_Benjamin_Jeyaretnam" title="wikilink">Joshua Benjamin Jeyaretnam</a>, a former <a href="Member_of_Parliament" title="wikilink">Member of Parliament</a> in Singapore, was reportedly only given a few minutes to speak in Parliament on the issue before his comments were rebutted by <a href="Ho_Peng_Kee" title="wikilink">Ho Peng Kee</a>, Minister of State for Law and Home Affairs.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a><a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a></p>
<p>Few other opposition members in parliament would bring up the issue, which may be reflective of a population generally indifferent to the matter.</p>

<p>Before the hanging of <a href="Shanmugam_Murugesu" title="wikilink">Shanmugam Murugesu</a>, a three-hour vigil was held on 6 May 2005. The organisers of the event at the <a href="Furama_Hotel" title="wikilink">Furama Hotel</a> said it was the first such public gathering organised solely by members of the public against the death penalty in Singapore. Murugesu had been arrested after being caught in possession of six packets containing just over 1 kg of <a href="Cannabis_(drug)" title="wikilink">cannabis</a> after returning from <a href="Malaysia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Malaysia</a>.

<h3 id="law-society-review">Law Society review</h3>
<p>In December 2005, the <a href="Law_Society_of_Singapore" title="wikilink">Law Society of Singapore</a> revealed that it has set up a committee, named <em>Review Committee on Capital Punishment</em>, to examine capital punishment in the country. The President of the Society, <a href="Senior_Counsel" title="wikilink">Senior Counsel</a> <a href="Philip_Jeyaretnam" title="wikilink">Philip Jeyaretnam</a>, said that the main focus of the review was on issues regarding administering the death penalty such as whether it should be mandatory. A report of the review would be submitted to the <a href="Ministry_of_Law_(Singapore)" title="wikilink">Ministry of Law</a>.<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a> On 6 November 2006, they were invited to give its views on proposed amendments to the Penal Code to the Ministry of Home Affairs. In their report, issued on 30 March 2007, they argued against the mandatory death penalty:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The death penalty should be discretionary for the offences where the death sentence is mandatory - murder, drug trafficking, firearms offences and sedition - a position similar to that for the offence of kidnapping. There are strong arguments for changing the mandatory nature of capital punishment in Singapore. Judges should be given the discretion to impose the death penalty only where deemed appropriate.<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="singapore-governments-response">Singapore government's response</h3>
<p>The Singapore government states that the death penalty is only used in the most serious of crimes, sending, they say, a strong message to potential offenders. They point out that in 1994 and 1999 the <a href="United_Nations_General_Assembly" title="wikilink">United Nations General Assembly</a> failed to adopt <a href="United_Nations_resolution" title="wikilink">resolutions</a> calling for a moratorium on the death penalty worldwide, as a majority of countries opposed such a move.</p>
<p>The Permanent Representative of the Republic of Singapore to the <a href="United_Nations" title="wikilink">United Nations</a> wrote a letter to the <a href="United_Nations_Special_Rapporteur" title="wikilink">Special Rapporteur</a> on <a href="Extrajudicial_punishment" title="wikilink">extrajudicial</a>, summary or arbitrary executions in 2001 which stated:</p>
<dl>

<dd>&quot;&lt;U+2026&gt;the death penalty is primarily a criminal justice issue, and therefore is a question for the sovereign jurisdiction of each country [&lt;U+2026&gt;] the right to life is not the only right, and [&lt;U+2026&gt;] it is the duty of societies and governments to decide how to balance competing rights against each other.&quot;<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>In January 2004, the <a href="Ministry_of_Home_Affairs_(Singapore)" title="wikilink">Ministry of Home Affairs</a> issued a response to <a href="Amnesty_International" title="wikilink">Amnesty International</a>'s report, &quot;Singapore: The death penalty - A hidden toll of executions&quot;. It defended the nation's policy to retain the death penalty, predicating its arguments on, amongst others, the following grounds:<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li>There is no international consensus on whether the death penalty should be abolished.</li>
<li>Each country has the sovereign right to decide on its own judicial system, taking into account its own circumstances.</li>
<li>The death penalty has been effective in keeping Singapore one of the safest places in the world to work and live in.</li>
<li>The application of the death penalty is only reserved for &quot;very serious crimes&quot;.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Ministry of Home Affairs also refuted Amnesty International's claims of the majority of the executed being foreigners, and that it was &quot;mostly the poor, least educated, and vulnerable people who are executed.&quot; The Ministry stated: &quot;Singaporeans, and not foreigners, were the majority of those executed... Of those executed from 1993 to 2003, 95% were above 21 years of age, and 80% had received formal education. About 80% of those who had been sentenced to capital punishment had employment before their convictions&quot;.<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a></p>
<p>Following the hanging of <a href="Van_Tuong_Nguyen" title="wikilink">Van Tuong Nguyen</a> in 2005, Prime Minister <a href="Lee_Hsien_Loong" title="wikilink">Lee Hsien Loong</a> reiterated the government's position, stating that &quot;The evil inflicted on thousands of people with drug trafficking demands that we must tackle the source by punishing the traffickers rather than trying to pick up the pieces afterwards... It's a law which is approved of by Singapore's inhabitants and which allows us to reduce the drug problem.&quot;<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a></p>
<p>Prior to the <a href="United_Nations_General_Assembly" title="wikilink">United Nations General Assembly</a>'s voting on a moratorium on the death penalty in November 2007, Singapore's ambassador <a href="Vanu_Gopala_Menon" title="wikilink">Vanu Gopala Menon</a> said: &quot;My delegation would like to remind this committee that capital punishment is not prohibited under international law. Yet it is clear that the sponsors of this draft resolution have decided that there can only be one view on capital punishment, and that only one set of choices should be respected... [the death penalty] is an important component of the administration of law and our justice system, and is imposed only for the most serious crimes and serves as a deterrent. We have proper legal safeguards in place to prevent any miscarriage of justice.&quot;<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="impact-on-official-debate-and-discussion-in-the-united-states">Impact on official debate and discussion in the United States</h2>
<p>In 2012, U.S. elected officials and office-seekers have stated that Singapore's success in combating drug abuse should be examined as a model for the United States. New York City Mayor <a href="Michael_Bloomberg" title="wikilink">Michael Bloomberg</a> said that America could learn a thing or two from nations like Singapore when it came to drug trafficking, noting that &lt;U+201C&gt;Executing a handful of people saves thousands and thousands of lives.&quot;<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a> In addition, U.S. presidential candidate <a href="Newt_Gingrich" title="wikilink">Newt Gingrich</a> repeated his longstanding advocacy for Singaporean methods in America's <a href="War_on_Drugs" title="wikilink">War on Drugs</a> during campaign interviews and speeches.<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a><a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a></p>
