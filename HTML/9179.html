<h3 id="santa-monica-boulevard">Santa Monica Boulevard</h3>
<p>Route 2 currently begins at the Los Angeles/Santa Monica city limit. From Centinela Avenue, Route 2 heads northeast on Santa Monica Boulevard through the wealthy areas of <a href="West_Los_Angeles,_Los_Angeles,_California" title="wikilink">West Los Angeles</a>, <a href="Westwood,_Los_Angeles,_California" title="wikilink">Westwood</a>, <a href="Century_City,_Los_Angeles,_California" title="wikilink">Century City</a>, and <a href="Beverly_Hills,_California" title="wikilink">Beverly Hills</a> before entering the decidedly urban <a href="West_Hollywood,_California" title="wikilink">West Hollywood</a>. Santa Monica Boulevard, being a major street, is for most of its length at least four lanes wide. <img src="WestHollywoodCityHall03.jpg" title="fig:West Hollywood City Hall." alt="West Hollywood City Hall." width="250" /></p>
<p>At the west end of its run, Santa Monica Boulevard starts off <a href="Ocean_Avenue,_Santa_Monica,_California" title="wikilink">Ocean Avenue</a> in Santa Monica. From there until <a href="Sepulveda_Boulevard" title="wikilink">Sepulveda Boulevard</a>, Santa Monica Boulevard is a densely urban commercial street. Most of the <a href="West_Los_Angeles_(region)" title="wikilink">Westside</a> car dealerships are located on Santa Monica Boulevard. After Sepulveda, Santa Monica Boulevard passes by Century City and its shopping center, and intersects with Wilshire in Beverly Hills. After intersecting with Wilshire in Beverly Hills, Santa Monica Boulevard continues northeast towards West Hollywood, spanning <a href="Beverly_Boulevard" title="wikilink">Beverly Boulevard</a> and <a href="Melrose_Avenue" title="wikilink">Melrose Avenue</a>. In the middle of West Hollywood, Santa Monica turns to run east-west north of <a href="Wilshire_Boulevard" title="wikilink">Wilshire Boulevard</a>. One of the most famous spots for male <a href="prostitution" class="uri" title="wikilink">prostitution</a> and <a href="transgender" class="uri" title="wikilink">transgender</a> prostitution is Santa Monica Boulevard in the Hollywood area, especially the area east of <a href="La_Brea_Avenue" title="wikilink">La Brea Avenue</a>. At Holloway Drive in West Hollywood, Route 2 turns east continuing on Santa Monica Boulevard to the Hollywood Freeway in <a href="Hollywood,_Los_Angeles,_California" title="wikilink">Hollywood</a>.</p>
<p>Santa Monica Boulevard merges on its eastern end with <a href="Sunset_Boulevard" title="wikilink">Sunset Boulevard</a> in the Sunset Junction neighborhood of <a href="Silver_Lake,_California" title="wikilink">Silver Lake</a>.</p>
<p>South Santa Monica Boulevard, often called Little Santa Monica, runs parallel to Santa Monica Boulevard through Beverly Hills, from the Los Angeles city limits to Beverly Drive. After Beverly Drive, Little Santa Monica turns east, becoming Burton Way. Burton Way merges into <a href="San_Vicente_Boulevard" title="wikilink">San Vicente Boulevard</a> at its intersection with <a href="La_Cienega_Boulevard" title="wikilink">La Cienega Boulevard</a>.</p>
<h3 id="hollywood-freeway-and-alvarado-street">Hollywood Freeway and Alvarado Street</h3>
<p>Route 2 then merges onto <a href="U.S._Route_101_in_California" title="wikilink">U.S. Route 101</a> (the <a href="Hollywood_Freeway" title="wikilink">Hollywood Freeway</a>) and heads southeast to the Alvarado Street exit. There, it heads northeast on Alvarado Street through the culturally vivid community of <a href="Echo_Park,_Los_Angeles,_California" title="wikilink">Echo Park</a>.</p>
<h3 id="glendale-blvd.-and-glendale-freeway">Glendale Blvd. and Glendale Freeway</h3>
<p>The route then turns north onto Glendale Boulevard, which is frequently congested, especially after games and events at <a href="Dodger_Stadium" title="wikilink">Dodger Stadium</a>. The route then branches northeast onto the Glendale Freeway, a peculiar north-south route with an east-west demarcation. The <a href="Glendale_Freeway" title="wikilink">Glendale Freeway</a> runs near the communities of <a href="Glassell_Park,_Los_Angeles,_California" title="wikilink">Glassell Park</a> and <a href="Eagle_Rock,_Los_Angeles,_California" title="wikilink">Eagle Rock</a>. After its interchange with <a href="California_State_Route_134" title="wikilink">Route 134</a>, the route follows a mountain ridge through a valley as it flanks the east side of <a href="Glendale,_California" title="wikilink">Glendale</a>. The freeway ends at <a href="Foothill_Boulevard_(Los_Angeles)" title="wikilink">Foothill Boulevard</a> in <a href="La_Ca&lt;U+00F1&gt;ada_Flintridge,_California" title="wikilink">La Ca&lt;U+00F1&gt;ada Flintridge</a>; just before reaching Foothill Boulevard, Route 2 turns off the Glendale Freeway onto the eastbound <a href="Foothill_Freeway" title="wikilink">Foothill Freeway</a> (Interstate 210) for a short while until reaching the Angeles Crest Highway exit.</p>
<h3 id="angeles-crest-highway">Angeles Crest Highway</h3>

<p><img src="LA_cloudbasin.jpg" title="fig:Angeles Crest Highway as it winds through the Angeles National Forest." alt="Angeles Crest Highway as it winds through the Angeles National Forest." width="150" />The route turns north onto the Angeles Crest Highway, cutting through an obscure portion of <a href="Pasadena,_California" title="wikilink">Pasadena</a>. This route winds generally east-northeast through the canyons of the <a href="San_Gabriel_Mountains" title="wikilink">San Gabriel Mountains</a> for over 80 miles (130 miles), before descending through Big Pines and <a href="Wrightwood,_California" title="wikilink">Wrightwood</a> to the edge of the <a href="Victor_Valley" title="wikilink">Victor Valley</a> approximately 20 miles (32 km) west of <a href="Hesperia,_California" title="wikilink">Hesperia</a> and ending at <a href="California_State_Route_138" title="wikilink">Route 138</a>. Starting in <a href="La_Ca&lt;U+00F1&gt;ada_Flintridge,_California" title="wikilink">La Ca&lt;U+00F1&gt;ada-Flintridge</a> at an altitude of 1,300' (394m) the highway climbs to a high point of 7,903' (2,395m) at Dawson Saddle. The eastern portions of the Angeles Crest Highway are notoriously dangerous, with many switchbacks and blind curves, and are often closed during occasions of heavy winter snowfall. The highway is generally closed between Islip Saddle and Vincent Gap from mid-December to mid-May due to snow and rockfall.</p>
<h2 id="history">History</h2>

<p>In <a href="1964" class="uri" title="wikilink">1964</a>, Route 2 was defined as a single route from Santa Monica to Wrightwood with no discontinuities. The segment of former US 66 on Santa Monica Boulevard west of the Hollywood Freeway and Lincoln Boulevard was added to Route 2 at this time, since US 66 was truncated to <a href="Pasadena,_CA" title="wikilink">Pasadena</a>. Route 2 became discontinuous at Routes 101 and 210 in <a href="1965" class="uri" title="wikilink">1965</a> and <a href="1990" class="uri" title="wikilink">1990</a>, respectively.</p>
<p>The first segment of freeway was built in the <a href="1950s" class="uri" title="wikilink">1950s</a> and ran from just west of the Los Angeles River to Avenue 38 in the Atwater district of Los Angeles. This portion was at one time named the <strong>Allesandro Freeway</strong>, named after a character from <a href="Helen_Hunt_Jackson" title="wikilink">Helen Hunt Jackson</a>'s novel <em><a href="Ramona" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ramona</a></em>. The last segment of freeway, from <a href="California_State_Route_134" title="wikilink">Route 134</a> to Route 210, was built in <a href="1970s" class="uri" title="wikilink">1970s</a>. It is named the <strong>Frank G. Lanterman Freeway</strong> in honor of the former <a href="California_State_Assembly" title="wikilink">California state assemblyman</a> from the La Ca&lt;U+00F1&gt;ada region.</p>
<h3 id="santa-monica-boulevard-1">Santa Monica Boulevard</h3>
<p>Starting in July, 1964, Route 2 began in Santa Monica at its junction with Routes 1 and <a href="Interstate_10_(California)" title="wikilink">10</a>. After heading a few blocks northwest on <em><a href="Lincoln_Boulevard_(Southern_California)" title="wikilink">Lincoln Boulevard</a></em>, the route turned northeast on <a href="Santa_Monica_Boulevard" title="wikilink">Santa Monica Boulevard</a>, just several blocks from the <a href="Pacific_Ocean" title="wikilink">Pacific Ocean</a>. The route continued on <em>Santa Monica Boulevard</em> to <a href="Centinela_Avenue" title="wikilink">Centinela Avenue</a>.</p>
<p>For its entire length, until the tracks were removed, Santa Monica Boulevard followed the tracks of the <a href="Pacific_Electric_Railway" title="wikilink">Pacific Electric Railway</a>. In the portion from Holloway Drive in West Hollywood to <a href="Sepulveda_Boulevard" title="wikilink">Sepulveda Boulevard</a> in West Los Angeles, the tracks were in a separate right-of-way, with two roadways on either side of the tracks. For the rest of the route, the tracks ran in the traffic lanes.</p>
<p>Except for a short portion at its eastern end, Santa Monica Boulevard was adopted as a state highway in 1933. From 1934 to 1936,<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> it was signed as State Route 2. Then it became <a href="U.S._Route_66_(California)" title="wikilink">U.S. Route 66</a>. When <a href="U.S._Route_66_(California)" title="wikilink">U.S. Route 66</a> was truncated to <a href="Pasadena,_California" title="wikilink">Pasadena</a> in 1964, Santa Monica Boulevard once again became <a href="California_State_Route_2" title="wikilink">State Route 2</a> as far east as the <a href="Hollywood_Freeway" title="wikilink">Hollywood Freeway</a>. Today, the State Route 2 portion of Santa Monica Boulevard is defined from the Santa Monica/Los Angeles city limits to <a href="U.S._Route_101_(California)" title="wikilink">US 101</a>.</p>
<p>From 1936 to 1964, <a href="U.S._Route_66_(California)" title="wikilink">U.S. Route 66</a> ran along Lincoln Boulevard from its junction with Alternate U. S. 101 (now California Route 1) and California Route 26 (now replaced by Interstate 10) to Santa Monica Boulevard and along Santa Monica Boulevard from Lincoln Boulevard to the Hollywood Freeway. US 66 turned southeast on the Hollywood Freeway with US 101. At that time, Route 2 began on Alvarado Street at the Hollywood Freeway. As is today, Route 2 traversed Alvarado Street and Glendale Boulevard to the Glendale Freeway. Route 2 continued on the Glendale Freeway to a temporary connection with Fletcher Drive at Avenue 38 in the Atwater district of Los Angeles. From the temporary connection, the route ran northeast on Fletcher Drive, and north on Verdugo Road to its south intersection with Ca&lt;U+00F1&gt;ada Boulevard in Glendale. From the south intersection, Route 2 headed north on Ca&lt;U+00F1&gt;ada Boulevard to its north intersection with Verdugo Road, north on Verdugo Road, and east on Verdugo Boulevard, before reaching Foothill Boulevard in La Ca&lt;U+00F1&gt;ada-Flintridge. Route 2 continued approximately one mile southeast on Foothill Boulevard with California Route 118 to Angeles Crest Highway. From Foothill Boulevard, Route 2 continued north on Angeles Crest Highway, where it continues to this day.</p>
<p>Today, Caltrans is <a href="route_relinquishment" title="wikilink">relinquishing</a> the <a href="street" class="uri" title="wikilink">street</a>-running parts of Route 2 to local cities of which it runs through. In 1996, state law was changed to permit the relinquishment of Route 2 in Santa Monica and West Hollywood. When the relinquishment in Santa Monica went through in 1998, the portion from Route 1 to Centinela Avenue was deleted. The law was changed again in <a href="2001" class="uri" title="wikilink">2001</a> to allow Route 2 from Route 405 to Moreno Drive to be relinquished to the City of <a href="Los_Angeles,_California" title="wikilink">Los Angeles</a>. In <a href="2003" class="uri" title="wikilink">2003</a> <a href="California" class="uri" title="wikilink">California</a> Senate Bill 315 was chaptered, acknowledging the relinquishments within Santa Monica, West Hollywood, and from Route 405 to Moreno Drive in Los Angeles, and permitting the relinquishment of Route 2 in Beverly Hills. Whether Route 2 west of Route 101 will stay as a paper route after relinquishment is yet to be determined.</p>
<h3 id="glendale-freeway">Glendale Freeway</h3>
<p><img src="Glendalefreeway.jpg" title="fig:Because of its relatively short length, the Glendale Freeway is often less congested in comparison to other Los Angeles freeways. The overpass from which this picture was taken was featured as a &quot;collapsing&quot; bridge in the 1974 disaster film Earthquake." alt="Because of its relatively short length, the Glendale Freeway is often less congested in comparison to other Los Angeles freeways. The overpass from which this picture was taken was featured as a &quot;collapsing&quot; bridge in the 1974 disaster film Earthquake." width="350" /> Before the segment of the Glendale Freeway was built between Glendale Boulevard and just west of the Los Angeles River, Route 2 began at the Hollywood Freeway on Santa Monica Boulevard, continued east to Myra Avenue, then north on Myra Avenue, east on Fountain Avenue, northeast on Hyperion Avenue, southeast on Rowena Avenue, southeast on Glendale Boulevard, and northeast on Fletcher Drive to just west of the Los Angeles River. From west of the Los Angeles River, Route 2 continued on the Glendale Freeway to its temporary connection with Fletcher Drive at Avenue 38 and then followed the routing described in the previous paragraph to Route 138 northeast of Wrightwood.</p>
<p>Originally, it was to have been the <a href="Beverly_Hills_Freeway" title="wikilink">Beverly Hills Freeway</a> from Route 405 to Route 101 just east of Vermont Avenue, flowing onto the Glendale Freeway. In fact, the proposed freeway on Route 2 west of Route 101 was the original routing of the &quot;Santa Monica Freeway&quot; (a name which subsequently went to the distantly parallel <a href="Interstate_10_(California)" title="wikilink">Route 10</a>). However, for a variety of political reasons, the department never reached agreement with <a href="Beverly_Hills,_California" title="wikilink">Beverly Hills</a> to build the segment through that city. At one time, the department considered building a <a href="cut-and-cover" class="uri" title="wikilink">cut-and-cover</a> tunnel under Beverly Hills, but even this proved a non-starter, and the freeway plan west of Route 101 was quietly cancelled in 1975. Currently, the Glendale Freeway begins as a stub at Glendale Boulevard. A freeway-wide bridge was built over Glendale Boulevard in hopes that the freeway would be built further west. Today, the bridge serves as the westbound lanes of Route 2, connecting the southwestbound freeway lanes to southbound Glendale Boulevard. A more modest freeway/expressway extension to Route 101 has been discussed.</p>
<p>Planners originally intended for it to connect to the <a href="Hollywood_Freeway" title="wikilink">Hollywood Freeway</a> in Echo Park, but community opposition killed the project by the 1960s; as a result, during games at nearby <a href="Dodger_Stadium" title="wikilink">Dodger Stadium</a>, there is often significant congestion in the areas around the freeway's terminus. The Glendale Freeway offers stunning vistas of the eastern <a href="San_Fernando_Valley" title="wikilink">San Fernando Valley</a>, the <a href="Verdugo_Mountains" title="wikilink">Verdugo Mountains</a>, the <a href="Crescenta_Valley" title="wikilink">Crescenta Valley</a>, and the <a href="San_Gabriel_Mountains" title="wikilink">San Gabriel Mountains</a>.</p>
<p>Since the 1950s, proposals have been made to extend the Glendale Freeway to the <a href="Antelope_Valley_Freeway" title="wikilink">Antelope Valley Freeway</a> via a <a href="tunnel" class="uri" title="wikilink">tunnel</a> under the San Gabriels, relieving some of the latter freeway's notorious congestion. The difficulty of designing and building such a route (designated <a href="SR_249_(CA)" title="wikilink">SR 249</a>) and the cost of insuring it against <a href="earthquake" title="wikilink">earthquakes</a> and <a href="terrorism" class="uri" title="wikilink">terrorism</a> would undoubtedly make perpetually cash-strapped <a href="Caltrans" class="uri" title="wikilink">Caltrans</a> unable to undertake such an ambitious project.</p>
<p>The section of freeway between the <a href="Ventura_Freeway" title="wikilink">Ventura Freeway</a> (<a href="California_State_Route_134" title="wikilink">134</a>) and the <a href="Foothill_Freeway" title="wikilink">Foothill Freeway</a> (<a href="Interstate_210_(California)" title="wikilink">210</a>) was largely completed in <a href="1975" class="uri" title="wikilink">1975</a>, but not fully finished until <a href="1979" class="uri" title="wikilink">1979</a>. During this time, the closed freeway was used as a location for several films, including <em><a href="Coffy" class="uri" title="wikilink">Coffy</a></em>, <em><a href="Corvette_Summer" title="wikilink">Corvette Summer</a></em>, and several American <a href="television_series" title="wikilink">television series</a> including &quot;<a href="Adam-12" class="uri" title="wikilink">Adam-12</a>&quot;, &quot;<a href="Emergency!" class="uri" title="wikilink">Emergency!</a>&quot; and &quot;<a href="CHiPs" class="uri" title="wikilink">CHiPs</a>&quot;. The transition overpass from the eastbound <a href="Ventura_Freeway" title="wikilink">Ventura Freeway</a> to the northbound Glendale Freeway was prominently featured in the notorious <a href="disaster_film" title="wikilink">disaster film</a> <em><a href="Earthquake_(movie)" title="wikilink">Earthquake</a></em> when a livestock truck and two cars crash over the side of the overpass (a shot completed in miniature special effects).</p>
