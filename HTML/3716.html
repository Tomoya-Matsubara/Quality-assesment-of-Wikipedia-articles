<p><strong>Osborne Earl &quot;Ozzie&quot; Smith</strong> (born December 26, 1954) is a retired American professional <a href="baseball" class="uri" title="wikilink">baseball</a> player who was elected to the <a href="National_Baseball_Hall_of_Fame_and_Museum" title="wikilink">Baseball Hall of Fame</a> in 2002. Nicknamed &quot;The Wizard&quot;, Smith played <a href="shortstop" class="uri" title="wikilink">shortstop</a> for the <a href="San_Diego_Padres" title="wikilink">San Diego Padres</a> and <a href="St._Louis_Cardinals" title="wikilink">St. Louis Cardinals</a> in <a href="Major_League_Baseball" title="wikilink">Major League Baseball</a>, winning the <a href="National_League" title="wikilink">National League</a> <a href="Gold_Glove_Award" title="wikilink">Gold Glove Award</a> for defensive play at shortstop for 13 consecutive seasons. A 15-time <a href="All-Star" class="uri" title="wikilink">All-Star</a>, Smith accumulated 2,460 <a href="hit_(baseball)" title="wikilink">hits</a> and 580 <a href="stolen_base" title="wikilink">stolen bases</a> during his career, and won the National League <a href="Silver_Slugger_Award" title="wikilink">Silver Slugger Award</a> as the best hitter at shortstop in 1987.</p>
<p>Smith was born in <a href="Mobile,_Alabama" title="wikilink">Mobile, Alabama</a>, but his family moved to the <a href="Watts,_Los_Angeles,_California" title="wikilink">Watts</a> section of <a href="Los_Angeles,_California" title="wikilink">Los Angeles, California</a> when he was six years old. Developing quick reflexes via childhood athletic activities, Smith played baseball in high school and college. Drafted as an amateur player by the San Diego Padres, Smith made his Major League Baseball debut in 1978. Smith quickly established himself as an outstanding defensive player, who later became known for performing backflips on special occasions while running out to his position. Smith won his first Gold Glove award in 1980 and made his first All-Star Game appearance in 1981. When conflict with Padres' ownership developed, he was traded to the St. Louis Cardinals for shortstop <a href="Garry_Templeton" title="wikilink">Garry Templeton</a> in 1982.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>Upon joining the Cardinals, Smith helped the team win the <a href="1982_World_Series" title="wikilink">1982 World Series</a> championship. Three years later his game-winning <a href="home_run" title="wikilink">home run</a> during Game 5 of the <a href="1985_National_League_Championship_Series" title="wikilink">1985 National League Championship Series</a> prompted broadcaster <a href="Jack_Buck" title="wikilink">Jack Buck</a>'s &quot;Go crazy, folks!&quot; play-by-play call. Despite a <a href="rotator_cuff" title="wikilink">rotator cuff</a> injury during the 1985 season, Smith posted career highs in multiple offensive categories in 1987. Smith continued to earn Gold Gloves and All-Star appearances on an annual basis until 1993, and later missed nearly three months of the 1995 season after undergoing shoulder surgery. After tension between Smith and his new manager <a href="Tony_La_Russa" title="wikilink">Tony La Russa</a> developed in 1996, Smith decided to retire at season's end, and subsequently had his uniform number (#1) retired by the Cardinals.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> Smith served as host the television show <em><a href="This_Week_in_Baseball" title="wikilink">This Week in Baseball</a></em> from 1997 to 1999, and continues to be an entrepreneur in a variety of business ventures.</p>
<h2 id="early-life">Early life</h2>
<p>Smith was born in <a href="Mobile,_Alabama" title="wikilink">Mobile, Alabama</a>, the second of Clovis and Marvella Smith's six children (five boys and one girl).<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> While the family lived in Mobile, his father worked as a sandblaster at <a href="Brookley_Air_Force_Base" title="wikilink">Brookley Air Force Base</a>.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> When Smith was six his family moved to the <a href="Watts,_Los_Angeles,_California" title="wikilink">Watts</a> section of <a href="Los_Angeles,_California" title="wikilink">Los Angeles, California</a>.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> His father became a delivery truck driver for <a href="Safeway_Inc." title="wikilink">Safeway</a> stores, while his mother became an aide at a nursing home.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> Smith's mother was an influential part of his life who stressed the importance of education and encouraged him to pursue his dreams.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a><a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p>Smith played a variety of sports in his youth, but considered baseball to be his &quot;favorite.&quot;<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> Smith developed quick reflexes through various athletic and leisure activity, such as bouncing a ball off the concrete steps in front of his house, moving in closer to reduce reaction time with each throw.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> When not at the local <a href="YMCA" class="uri" title="wikilink">YMCA</a> or playing sports, Smith sometimes went with friends to the neighborhood lumberyard, springboarding off inner tubes and doing flips into sawdust piles (a precursor to his famous <a href="backflip" title="wikilink">backflips</a>).<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> In 1965 a ten year old Smith endured the <a href="Watts_Riots" title="wikilink">Watts Riots</a> with his family, recalling that, &quot;We had to sleep on the floor because of all the sniping and looting going on.&quot;<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<p>While Smith was attending <a href="middle_school" title="wikilink">junior high school</a>, his parents decided to <a href="divorce" class="uri" title="wikilink">divorce</a>.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> Continuing to pursue his interest in baseball, Smith would ride the bus for nearly an hour to reach <a href="Dodger_Stadium" title="wikilink">Dodger Stadium</a>, cheering for the <a href="Los_Angeles_Dodgers" title="wikilink">Los Angeles Dodgers</a> at about 25 games a year.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> Upon becoming a student at <a href="Locke_High_School" title="wikilink">Locke High School</a>, Smith played on the basketball and baseball teams.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> Smith was a teammate of future <a href="National_Basketball_Association" title="wikilink">National Basketball Association</a> player <a href="Marques_Johnson" title="wikilink">Marques Johnson</a> on the basketball team, and a teammate of future MLB player <a href="Eddie_Murray" title="wikilink">Eddie Murray</a> on the baseball side.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> After high school Smith attended <a href="California_Polytechnic_State_University" title="wikilink">Cal Poly San Luis Obispo</a> in 1974 on a partial academic scholarship, and managed to <a href="Walk-on_(sport_term)" title="wikilink">walk-on</a> to the baseball team.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> In addition to his academic education, Smith learned to <a href="switch_hitter" title="wikilink">switch-hit</a> from Cal-Poly coach Berdy Harr.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> When Cal Poly's starting shortstop broke his leg midway through the 1974 season, Smith subsequently took over the starting role.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> Later named an All-American athlete, Smith established school records in career <a href="at-bat" title="wikilink">at-bats</a> (754) and career <a href="stolen_base" title="wikilink">stolen bases</a> (110) before graduating in 1977.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a><a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a></p>

<p>Smith was playing semi-professional baseball in <a href="Clarinda,_Iowa" title="wikilink">Clarinda, Iowa</a> in June 1976 when he was selected in the seventh round of the <a href="Major_League_Baseball_Draft" title="wikilink">amateur entry draft</a> by the <a href="Detroit_Tigers" title="wikilink">Detroit Tigers</a>.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a><a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> The parties could not agree on a contract; Smith wanted a $10,000 signing bonus, while the Tigers offered $8,500.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> Smith returned to Cal-Poly for his senior year, then in the 1977 draft was selected in the fourth round by the <a href="San_Diego_Padres" title="wikilink">San Diego Padres</a>, ultimately agreeing to a contract that included a $5,000 signing bonus.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> Smith spent his first year of professional baseball, 1977, with the Class A <a href="Walla_Walla_Padres" title="wikilink">Walla Walla Padres</a> of the <a href="Northwest_League" title="wikilink">Northwest League</a>.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a></p>
<p>Smith began <a href="1978_San_Diego_Padres_season" title="wikilink">1978</a> as a non-roster invitee to the San Diego Padres' spring training camp in <a href="Yuma,_Arizona" title="wikilink">Yuma, Arizona</a>. Smith credited Padres manager <a href="Alvin_Dark" title="wikilink">Alvin Dark</a> for giving him confidence by telling reporters the shortstop job was Smith's until he proved he can't handle it.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> Even though Dark was fired in the middle of training camp, Smith made his <a href="Major_League_Baseball" title="wikilink">Major League Baseball</a> (MLB) debut on April 7, 1978.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a><a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a></p>

<p>It did not take long for Smith to earn recognition in the major leagues, making what some consider his greatest defensive play only ten games into his rookie season.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a><a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> The Padres played host to the <a href="Atlanta_Braves" title="wikilink">Atlanta Braves</a> on April 20, 1978, and with two out in the top of the fourth <a href="inning" class="uri" title="wikilink">inning</a>, Atlanta's <a href="Jeff_Burroughs" title="wikilink">Jeff Burroughs</a> hit a ground ball up the middle.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> Smith described the play by saying, &quot;He hit a ball back up the middle that everybody thought was going into center field. I instinctively broke to my left and dove behind second. As I was in the air, the ball took a bad hop and caromed behind me, but I was able to catch it with my bare hand. I hit the ground, bounced back up, and threw Burroughs out at first.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a></p>
<p>During a roadtrip to <a href="Houston,_Texas" title="wikilink">Houston, Texas</a> later in the season, Smith met a part-time usherette at the <a href="Astrodome" class="uri" title="wikilink">Astrodome</a> named Denise while making his way to the team bus outside the stadium.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> The couple developed a relationship that was sometimes long-distance in nature, but eventually decided to <a href="marriage" title="wikilink">marry</a>.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a><a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> It was also during the 1978 season that Smith introduced a signature move. Padres promotion director Andy Strasberg knew Smith could perform backflips, but that he only did them during practice before fans entered the stadium.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> Strasberg asked Smith to do a backflip for fans during Fan Appreciation Day on October 1, the Padres' last home game of the season.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a><a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> After conferring with veteran teammate <a href="Gene_Tenace" title="wikilink">Gene Tenace</a>, Smith went ahead with the backflip, and it proved to be wildly popular.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> Smith finished the 1978 season with a .258 batting average and .970 fielding percentage, placing second in <a href="Major_League_Baseball_Rookie_of_the_Year_Award" title="wikilink">National League Rookie of the Year</a> voting to <a href="Bob_Horner" title="wikilink">Bob Horner</a>.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a><a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a></p>
<p>After working with a hitting instructor during the offseason, Smith failed to record a base hit in his first 32 at-bats of the <a href="1979_San_Diego_Padres_season" title="wikilink">1979</a> season.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> Off the field, conflict developed between Padres' ownership and the combination of Smith and his agent, Ed Gottlieb. The parties entered into a contract dispute before the <a href="1980_in_baseball" title="wikilink">1980 season</a>, and when negotiations lasted into spring training, the Padres renewed Smith's contract at his 1979 salary of $72,500.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> Angered by the Padres' attitude during those contract talks, Gottlieb took out a help-wanted ad in the <a href="The_San_Diego_Union-Tribune" title="wikilink"><em>San Diego Union</em></a>, part of which read, &quot;Padre baseball player wants part-time employment to supplement income.&quot;<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a> When Joan Kroc, wife of Padres owner <a href="Ray_Kroc" title="wikilink">Ray Kroc</a>, publicly offered Smith a job as an assistant gardener on her estate, Smith and Gottlieb's relationship with the organization deteriorated further.<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a></p>
<p>Meanwhile, Smith was winning recognition for his accomplishments on the field. In 1980 he set the single-season record for most assists by a shortstop (621), and began his string of 13 consecutive <a href="Rawlings_Gold_Glove_Award" title="wikilink">Gold Glove awards</a>.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a> Smith's defensive play prompted the <em>Yuma Daily Sun</em> to use the nickname &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; in a March 1981 feature article about Smith.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a> While &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; nickname was an allusion to the <a href="The_Wizard_of_Oz_(1939_film)" title="wikilink">1939 motion picture</a> of the same name, Smith also came to be known as simply &quot;The Wizard&quot; during his playing career, as Smith's Baseball Hall of Fame plaque would later attest.<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a><a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a> In 1981, Smith made his first <a href="1981_Major_League_Baseball_All-Star_Game" title="wikilink">All-Star Game appearance</a> as a reserve player.<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="trade">Trade</h3>
<p>While Smith was having problems with the Padres' owners, the <a href="St._Louis_Cardinals" title="wikilink">St. Louis Cardinals</a> also found themselves unhappy with their shortstop. During a game at <a href="Busch_Memorial_Stadium" title="wikilink">Busch Stadium</a> on August 26, 1981, <a href="Garry_Templeton" title="wikilink">Garry Templeton</a> made obscene gestures at fans before being pulled off the field by manager <a href="Whitey_Herzog" title="wikilink">Whitey Herzog</a>.<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a><a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a> Given the task of overhauling the Cardinals by owner <a href="Gussie_Busch" title="wikilink">Gussie Busch</a>, Herzog was looking to trade Templeton when he was approached by Padres General Manager <a href="Jack_McKeon" title="wikilink">Jack McKeon</a> at the 1981 <a href="Winter_meetings" title="wikilink">baseball winter meetings</a>.<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a> While McKeon had previously told Herzog that Smith was untouchable in any trade, the Padres were now so angry at Smith's agent Gottlieb that McKeon was willing to deal.<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a></p>
<p>McKeon and Herzog agreed in principle to a six-player trade, with Templeton for Smith as the centerpiece.<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a> It was then that Padres manager <a href="Dick_Williams" title="wikilink">Dick Williams</a> informed Herzog that a <a href="no-trade_clause" title="wikilink">no-trade clause</a> had been included in Smith's 1981 contract.<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a> Upon learning of the trade, Smith's initial reaction was to invoke the clause and stay in <a href="San_Diego" title="wikilink">San Diego</a>, but he was still interested to hear what the Cardinals had to say.<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a> While the deal for the players beside Templeton and Smith went through, Herzog flew to San Diego to meet with Smith and Gottlieb over the Christmas holiday.<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a> Smith later recalled that, &quot;Whitey told me that with me playing shortstop for the St. Louis Cardinals, we could win the pennant. He made me feel wanted, which was a feeling I was quickly losing from the Padres. The mere fact that Whitey would come all the way out there to talk to us was more than enough to convince me that St. Louis was the place I wanted to be.&quot;<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a></p>

<p>Smith became a father for the first time during the 1982 season with the birth of his son O.J., today known as <a href="Nikko_Smith" title="wikilink">Nikko</a>, on April 28.<a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a> Smith also developed a lasting friendship with teammate <a href="Willie_McGee" title="wikilink">Willie McGee</a> during the season, and Smith said he likes to think he &quot;helped Willie get over some of the rough spots of adjusting to the major leagues&quot;.<a href="#fn69" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref69"><sup>69</sup></a> Smith later participated in the postseason for the first time when the Cardinals faced the <a href="Atlanta_Braves" title="wikilink">Atlanta Braves</a> in the best-of-five <a href="1982_National_League_Championship_Series" title="wikilink">1982 National League Championship Series</a> (NLCS).
