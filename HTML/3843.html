<p><strong>Genetically modified foods</strong> or <strong>biotech foods</strong> are foods derived from <a href="genetically_modified_organism" title="wikilink">genetically modified organisms</a> (GMOs). Genetically modified organisms have had specific changes introduced into their DNA by <a href="genetic_engineering" title="wikilink">genetic engineering</a> techniques. These techniques are much more precise<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> than <a href="mutagenesis" class="uri" title="wikilink">mutagenesis</a> (mutation breeding) where an organism is exposed to radiation or chemicals to create a non-specific but stable change. Other techniques by which humans modify food organisms include selective breeding; plant breeding, and animal breeding, and <a href="somaclonal_variation" title="wikilink">somaclonal variation</a>.</p>
<p>Genetically Modified foods (GM foods) were first put on the market in 1996. Typically, genetically modified foods are <a href="transgenic_plant" title="wikilink">transgenic plant</a> products: <a href="Transgenic_soybean" title="wikilink">soybean</a>, <a href="Transgenic_maize" title="wikilink">corn</a>, <a href="canola" class="uri" title="wikilink">canola</a>, <a href="Genetically_modified_rice" title="wikilink">rice</a>, and <a href="cotton_seed_oil" title="wikilink">cotton seed oil</a>. Animal products have also been developed, although as of July 2010 none are currently on the market.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> In 2006 a pig was<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a><a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> engineered to produce <a href="omega-3_fatty_acid" title="wikilink">omega-3 fatty acids</a> through the expression of a <a href="roundworm" class="uri" title="wikilink">roundworm</a> gene.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> Researchers have also developed a genetically-modified breed of pigs that are able to absorb plant phosphorus more efficiently, and as a consequence the phosphorus content of their manure is reduced by as much as 60%.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p>Critics have objected to GM foods on several grounds, including safety issues,<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> <a href="ecology" title="wikilink">ecological</a> concerns, and <a href="economics" title="wikilink">economic</a> concerns raised by the fact these organisms are subject to <a href="intellectual_property" title="wikilink">intellectual property</a> law.</p>
<h2 id="method">Method</h2>
<p>Genetic modification involves the insertion or deletion of genes. In the process of <a href="cisgenesis" class="uri" title="wikilink">cisgenesis</a>, genes are artificially transferred between organisms that could be conventionally bred. In the process of <a href="transgenesis" class="uri" title="wikilink">transgenesis</a>, genes from a different species are inserted, which is a form of <a href="horizontal_gene_transfer" title="wikilink">horizontal gene transfer</a>. In nature this can occur when <a href="exogenous_DNA" title="wikilink">exogenous DNA</a> penetrates the <a href="cell_membrane" title="wikilink">cell membrane</a> for any reason. To do this artificially may require transferring genes as part of an attenuated virus genome or physically inserting the extra DNA into the nucleus of the intended host using a microsyringe, or as a coating on gold nanoparticles fired from a <a href="gene_gun" title="wikilink">gene gun</a>. However, other methods exploit natural forms of gene transfer, such as the ability of <em><a href="Agrobacterium" class="uri" title="wikilink">Agrobacterium</a></em> to transfer genetic material to plants, and the ability of <a href="lentiviruses" class="uri" title="wikilink">lentiviruses</a> to transfer genes to animal cells.''</p>
<p>The method to introduce new genes into plants requires several important factors such as specific promoter, codon usage of the gene and how to deactivate the gene. The specific promoter must relate to area that we want the gene to express. For instance, if we want the gene to express only in the rice instead of the leaf then we would only use an endosperm specific promoter. The reason is because we only want our transgenic genes to express only in the rice and not the leaves. The codon usage of the gene must also be more optimized for the rice since there are several different codons for each of the 20 amino acid. The transgenic genes should also be able to be denatured by heat in order for human consumption.</p>
<h2 id="development">Development</h2>
<p>The first commercially grown genetically modified <a href="Whole_foods" title="wikilink">whole food</a> crop was a tomato (called <a href="FlavrSavr" class="uri" title="wikilink">FlavrSavr</a>), which was modified to ripen without softening, by <a href="Calgene" class="uri" title="wikilink">Calgene</a>, later a subsidiary of <a href="Monsanto" class="uri" title="wikilink">Monsanto</a>.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> Calgene took the initiative to obtain FDA approval for its release in 1994 without any special labeling, although legally no such approval was required.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> It was welcomed by consumers who purchased them at a substantial premium over the price of regular tomatoes. However, production problems<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> and competition from a conventionally bred, longer <a href="Shelf_life" title="wikilink">shelf-life</a> variety prevented the product from becoming profitable. A tomato produced using similar technology to the Flavr Savr was used by Zeneca to produce <a href="tomato_paste" title="wikilink">tomato paste</a> which was sold in Europe during the summer of 1996.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a><a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> The labeling and pricing were designed as a marketing experiment, which proved, at the time, that European consumers would accept genetically engineered foods. Currently, there are a number of food species in which a genetically modified version exists (percent modified are mostly 2009/2010 data).<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a><a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a><a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a><a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a><a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a><a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<p>The beginning of genetically modified foods can be traced back to the 1980s when scientists discovered that pieces of DNA can transfer between organisms. The first genetically modified plant was produced a short time later, in 1983 using an antibiotic resistant tobacco plant. In 1994, the tomato was genetically modified for human consumption. This genetic modification allowed the tomato to delay ripening after picking. Afterwards in 1995, a biotech company <a href="Monsanto" class="uri" title="wikilink">Monsanto</a> introduced herbicide immune soybean also known as the Roundup ready. Also in 1995, the Bt Potato was approved safe by the Environmental Protection Agency, making it the first pesticide producing crop to be approved in the USA. In 1996, the first genetically modified Canola was available on the market. In the year 2000, scientist discovered that they were able to genetically modify foods to increase their nutrient value. In the year 2005, Alfafa began being marketed in the USA. As of 2011, the U.S. leads a list of multiple countries in the production of GM crops. <a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a></p>

<h2 id="growing-gm-crops">Growing GM crops</h2>
<p>Between 1996 and 2011, the total surface area of land cultivated with GMOs had increased by a factor of 94, from 17,000 km<sup>2</sup> (4.2 million acres) to 1,600,000 km<sup>2</sup> (395 million acres).<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> 10% of the world's crop lands were planted with GM crops in 2010.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a></p>
<p>Although most GM crops are grown in <a href="North_America" title="wikilink">North America</a>, in recent years there has been rapid growth in the area sown in <a href="Developing_country" title="wikilink">developing countries</a>. A total of 29 countries worldwide grew GM crops in 2011 by approximately 16.7 million farmers and 50% of GM crops grown worldwide were grown in developing countries. For example, the largest increase in crop area planted to GM crops in 2011 was in Brazil (303,000 km<sup>2</sup> versus 254,000 km<sup>2</sup> in 2010). There has also been rapid and continuing expansion of GM cotton varieties in India since 2002 (Cotton is a major source of vegetable cooking oil and <a href="Fodder" title="wikilink">animal feed</a>) with 106,000 km<sup>2</sup> of GM cotton harvested in India in 2011.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> In 2011, countries that grew the most transgenic crops were the United States, Brazil, Argentina, India, Canada, China, Paraguay, Pakistan, South Africa, Uruguay, Bolivia, Australia, Philippines, Myanmar, Burkino Faso, Mexico and Spain.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a></p>
<p>In the US, by 2009/10, 93% of the planted area of soybeans, 93% of cotton, 86% of corn and 95% of the sugar beet were genetically modified varieties.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a><a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> Genetically modified soybeans carried herbicide-tolerant traits only, but maize and cotton carried both herbicide tolerance and insect protection traits (the latter largely the <em>Bacillus thuringiensis</em> Bt insecticidal protein). These constitute &quot;input-traits&quot; which are aimed to financially benefit the producers, but may have indirect environmental benefits and marginal cost benefits to consumers. The Grocery Manufacturers of America estimated in 2003 that 70-75% of all processed foods in the U.S. contained a GM ingredient.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a></p>
<p>In India, GM cotton yields in Andhra Pradesh were no better than non-GM cotton in 2002, the first year of commercial GM cotton planting. This was because there was a severe drought in Andhra Pradesh that year and the parental cotton plant used in the genetic engineered variant was not well suited to extreme drought. Maharashtra, Karnataka, and Tamil Nadu had an average 42% increase in yield with GM cotton in the same year.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> Drought resistant variants were developed and, with the substantially reduced losses to insect predation, by 2011 88% of Indian cotton was GM.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> Though disputed<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a><a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> the economic and environmental benefits of GM cotton in India to the individual farmer have been documented.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a><a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a></p>

<h3 id="canada-regulations">Canada Regulations</h3>
<p><a href="Health_Canada" title="wikilink">Health Canada</a> is the regulating agency for all GM foods in Canada. Along with assessing the safety of all GM foods, it requires companies producing these food to submit detailed scientific data before this food is approved. This data includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>information on how the GM plant was developed</li>
<li>nucleic acid data that characterizes the genetic change</li>
<li>composition and nutritional data of the novel food compared to the original non-modified food</li>

<li>and potential for being an allergen</li>
</ul>
<p>The <a href="Canadian_Food_Inspection_Agency" title="wikilink">Canadian Food Inspection Agency</a> has a lesser role in GM foods regulation in Canada.

<h3 id="u.s.-regulations">U.S. Regulations</h3>
<p>In 1986 it was determined that there was no need to make new laws to regulate genetically modified food. This policy stated, &lt;U+201C&gt;A commercial product, regardless of its manner of production, should be regulated based on the product&lt;U+2019&gt;s composition and its intended use.&lt;U+201D&gt; This just means that food should be regulated in the way that it has always been regulated. Since the genetically modified foods are complex in production the means of regulation are very complex. Three major agencies; the <a href="Food_and_Drug_Administration" title="wikilink">Food and Drug Administration</a> (FDA), the <a href="United_States_Department_of_Agriculture" title="wikilink">United States Department of Agriculture</a> (USDA), and the <a href="Environmental_Protection_Agency" title="wikilink">Environmental Protection Agency</a> (EPA) regulate the production and safety of genetically modified food. <a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a></p>
<h4 id="regulatory-agencies">Regulatory Agencies</h4>
<h5 id="food-and-drug-administration">Food and Drug Administration</h5>
<p>In the regulation of genetically modified food, the FDA plays a significant role. It's obligation is to ensure the safety of the food and drugs for animals and humans. Within this organization there are department that regulate different areas of GM food which include,the Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition (CFSAN) and the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER).<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a></p>
<h5 id="environmental-protection-agency">Environmental Protection Agency</h5>
<p>The major role of the EPA in the regulation of Genetically modified food is to govern the use of pesticides. This includes all of the testing of any pesticide used. This also consist of pesticide residues in food,non-pesticides potential toxicities, and potentially dangerous microorganisms.<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a></p>
<h5 id="united-states-department-of-agriculture">United States Department of Agriculture</h5>
<p>The USDA's role in the regulation of GM foods is to ensure the safety of meat, poultry, eggs, and related products. Under the scope of these obligations includes the things that these animal eat; controlling plant pest and toxic weeds. A Department within the USDA that also is responsible for GM foods includes the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) which is responsible for biotechnology regulations. <a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a></p>
<h4 id="laws">Laws</h4>
<p>There are several laws that govern these regulatory agencies. These laws are statutes that these agencies review when determining the safety of a particular GM food. These laws include:<a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a></p>

<h2 id="crop-yields">Crop yields</h2>
<p>A 1999 study by Charles Benbrook, Chief Scientist of the Organic Center,<a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a> found that genetically engineered Roundup Ready soybeans did not increase yields.<a href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a> The report reviewed over 8,200 university trials in 1998 and found that Roundup Ready soybeans had a yield drag of 5.3% across all varieties tested. In addition, the same study found that farmers used 2&lt;U+2013&gt;5 times more herbicide (Roundup) on Roundup Ready soybeans compared to other popular weed management systems.<a href="#fn67" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a></p>
<p>However research published in Science in 2003 has shown that the use of genetically modified Bt cotton in India increased yields by 60% over the period 1998&lt;U+2013&gt;2001 while the number of applications of insecticides against bollworm were three times less on average.<a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a></p>
<p>A 2008 Soil Association report found that some scientific studies claimed that genetically modified varieties of plants do not produce higher <a href="crop_yield" title="wikilink">crop yields</a> than normal plants.<a href="#fn69" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref69"><sup>69</sup></a></p>
<p>In 2009 the Union of Concerned Scientists summarized numerous peer-reviewed studies on the yield contribution of genetic engineering in the United States. This report examined the two most widely grown engineered crops&lt;U+2014&gt;soybeans and maize (corn).<a href="#fn70" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a> Unlike many other studies, this work separated the yield contribution of the engineered gene from that of the many naturally occurring yield genes in crops.</p>
<p>The report found that engineered herbicide tolerant soy and maize did not increase yield at the national, aggregate level. Maize engineered with Bt insect resistance genes increased national yield by about 3 to 4 percent. Engineered crops increased <a href="net_(economics)" title="wikilink">net</a> yield in all cases.</p>
<p>The study concluded that in the United States, other agricultural methods have made a much greater contribution to national crop yield increases in recent years than genetic engineering. United States Department of Agriculture data record maize yield increases of about 28 percent since engineered varieties were first commercialized in the mid 1990s. The yield contribution of engineered genes has therefore been a modest fraction&lt;U+2014&gt;about 14 percent&lt;U+2014&gt;of the maize yield increase since the mid 1990s.</p>
<p>A 2010 article supported by <a href="CropLife_International" title="wikilink">CropLife International</a> summarised the results of 49 peer reviewed studies on GM crops worldwide.<a href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a><a href="#fn72" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref72"><sup>72</sup></a> On average, farmers in developed countries experienced increase in yield of 6% and in underdeveloped countries of 29%. Tillage was decreased by 25&lt;U+2013&gt;58% on herbicide resistant soybeans, insecticide applications on Bt crops were reduced by 14&lt;U+2013&gt;76% and 72% of farmers worldwide experienced positive economic results.</p>
<h2 id="coexistence-and-traceability">Coexistence and traceability</h2>
<p>The United States and Canada do not require labeling of genetically modified foods.<a href="#fn73" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref73"><sup>73</sup></a> However in certain other regions, such as the European Union, Japan, Malaysia and Australia, governments have required labeling so consumers can exercise choice between foods that have genetically modified, conventional or organic origins.<a href="#fn74" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref74"><sup>74</sup></a><a href="#fn75" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref75"><sup>75</sup></a> This requires a labeling system as well as the reliable separation of GM and non-GM organisms at production level and throughout the whole processing chain.<a href="#fn76" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref76"><sup>76</sup></a><a href="#fn77" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref77"><sup>77</sup></a></p>
<p>For <a href="Traceability_of_genetically_modified_organisms" title="wikilink">traceability</a>, the OECD has introduced a &quot;unique identifier&quot; which is given to any GMO when it is approved.<a href="#fn78" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref78"><sup>78</sup></a> This <a href="unique_identifier" title="wikilink">unique identifier</a> must be forwarded at every stage of processing.

<h3 id="detection">Detection</h3>
<p>Testing on GMOs in food and feed is routinely done using molecular techniques like <a href="DNA_microarrays" title="wikilink">DNA microarrays</a> or <a href="qPCR" class="uri" title="wikilink">qPCR</a>. These tests can be based on screening genetic elements (like p35S, tNos, pat, or bar) or event-specific markers for the official GMOs (like Mon810, Bt11, or GT73). The array-based method combines <a href="multiplex_(assay)" title="wikilink">multiplex</a> PCR and array technology to screen samples for different potential GMOs,<a href="#fn79" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref79"><sup>79</sup></a> combining different approaches (screening elements, plant-specific markers, and event-specific markers).</p>
<p>The qPCR is used to detect specific GMO events by usage of specific <a href="Primer_(molecular_biology)" title="wikilink">primers</a> for screening elements or event-specific markers. Controls are necessary to avoid false positive or false negative results. For example, a test for <a href="CaMV" class="uri" title="wikilink">CaMV</a> is used to avoid a false positive in the event of a virus contaminated sample.</p>
<h3 id="plu-codes">PLU codes</h3>
<p>A 5-digit <a href="Price_Look-Up_code" title="wikilink">Price Look-Up code</a> beginning with the digit <em>8</em> indicates genetically modified food.<a href="#fn80" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref80"><sup>80</sup></a> However the absence of the &quot;8&quot; does not necessarily indicate the food is not genetically modified since no retailer to date has elected to use the digit in voluntarily labeling genetically modified foods.<a href="#fn81" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref81"><sup>81</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="controversy">Controversy</h2>

<p>To combat the controversy, in May of 2000, the Clinton administration&lt;U+2019&gt;s Council on Environmental Quality and the Office of Science and Technology established a committee. This committee was set up to conduct a six month investigation into the safety of the foods and to make sure that all federal regulations were upheld. After the investigation the committee was to report and if necessary make suggestions in order to improve the process. After the six months were up, lots of research was done but no improvements were suggested. <a href="#fn82" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref82"><sup>82</sup></a></p>
<p>While it is evident that there is a food supply issue,<a href="#fn83" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref83"><sup>83</sup></a><a href="#fn84" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref84"><sup>84</sup></a><a href="#fn85" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref85"><sup>85</sup></a> the question is whether GM can solve world hunger problems, or even if that would be the best way to address the issue. Several scientists argue that in order to meet the demand for food in the developing world, a second <a href="Green_Revolution" title="wikilink">Green Revolution</a> with increased use of GM crops is needed.<a href="#fn86" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref86"><sup>86</sup></a> Others argue that there is <a href="Food_security" title="wikilink">more than enough food</a> in the world and that the hunger crisis is caused by problems in <a href="food_distribution" title="wikilink">food distribution</a> and politics, not production.<a href="#fn87" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref87"><sup>87</sup></a><a href="#fn88" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref88"><sup>88</sup></a> Recently some critics and environmentalists have changed their minds on the issue with respect to the need for additional food supplies.<a href="#fn89" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref89"><sup>89</sup></a><a href="#fn90" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref90"><sup>90</sup></a><a href="#fn91" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref91"><sup>91</sup></a></p>
<p>&lt;U+201C&gt;Genetic modification is analogous to nuclear power: nobody loves it, but climate change has made its adoption imperative,&lt;U+201D&gt; says economist <a href="Paul_Collier" title="wikilink">Paul Collier</a> of Oxford University. &quot;Declining genetic modification makes a complicated issue more complex. Genetic modification offers both faster crop adaptation and a biological, rather than chemical, approach to yield increases.&quot;<a href="#fn92" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref92"><sup>92</sup></a></p>
<p>On the other hand, many believe that GM food has not been a success and that we should devote our efforts and money into another solution. &lt;U+201C&gt;We need biodiversity intensification that works with nature&lt;U+2019&gt;s nutrient and water cycles, not against them,&lt;U+201D&gt; says <a href="Vandana_Shiva" title="wikilink">Vandana Shiva</a>, the founder of <a href="Navdanya" class="uri" title="wikilink">Navdanya</a>, the movement of 500,000 seed keepers and organic farmers in India, who argue that GMFs have not increased yields. Recently, Doug Gurian-Sherman, a member of the <a href="Union_of_Concerned_Scientists" title="wikilink">Union of Concerned Scientists</a>, a nonprofit science advocacy group, published a report called &lt;U+201C&gt;Failure to Yield&lt;U+201D&gt;, in which he stated that in a nearly 20 year record, genetically engineered crops have not increased yields substantially of food and livestock feed crops in the United States.<a href="#fn93" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref93"><sup>93</sup></a></p>
<p>Some claim that genetically modified food help farmers produce, despite the odds or any environmental barriers. &lt;U+201C&gt;While new technology must be tested before it is commercially released, we should be mindful of the risks of not releasing it at all,&lt;U+201D&gt; says Per Pinstrup-Andersen, professor of Food, Nutrition and Public Policy at Cornell University. Per Pinstrup-Andersen argues, &lt;U+201C&gt;Misguided anti-science ideology and failure by governments to prioritize agricultural and rural development in developing countries brought us the food crisis.&lt;U+201D&gt; He clearly states the challenge we face is not the challenge of whether we have enough resources to produce, but whether we will change our behavior.<a href="#fn94" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref94"><sup>94</sup></a></p>
<p>In March 2011 a coalition of family farmers, consumers and other critics of corporate agriculture held a town meeting to protest what they see as unfair consolidation of the nation's food system into the hands of a few multinationals. They contend that global biotech seed leader Monsanto controls the U.S. commercial seed market using unfair, and in some cases illegal, practices. They argue that Monsanto, which develops, licenses and markets genetically altered corn, soybeans and other crops, manipulates the seed market by buying up independent seed companies, patenting seed products, and then spiking prices. The group hopes to re-establish farmer rights to save seed from their harvested crops and replant it.<a href="#fn95" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref95"><sup>95</sup></a><a href="#fn96" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref96"><sup>96</sup></a></p>

<h2 id="intellectual-property">Intellectual property</h2>
<p>Traditionally, farmers in all nations saved their own seed from year to year. It should be noted that this does not apply in more agriculturally developed countries for some crops. Corn is one example where producers generally have not saved seed since the early 1900s with the advent of hybrid corn through selective breeding. Seed producers grow the seed corn instead due to the effort needed to produce hybrids.<a href="#fn117" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref117"><sup>117</sup></a> The offspring of the hybrid corn, while still viable, lose the beneficial traits of the parents, resulting in the loss of <a href="Heterosis" title="wikilink">hybrid vigor</a>. In these cases, the use of hybrid plants has been the primary reason for growers not saving seed, not intellectual property issues, and has been in practice well before genetically-modified seed was developed. However, the practice of not saving seed in non-hybrid crops, such as soybean, is mainly due to intellectual property regulations. Allowing to follow this practice with genetically modified seed would result in seed developers losing the ability to profit from their breeding work. Therefore, genetically-modified seed is subject to licensing by their developers in contracts that are written to prevent farmers from following this practice.<a href="#fn118" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref118"><sup>118</sup></a></p>

<p>Enforcement of <a href="patent" title="wikilink">patents</a> on genetically modified plants is often contentious, especially because of <a href="gene_flow" title="wikilink">gene flow</a>. In 1998, 95&lt;U+2013&gt;98 percent of about 10 km<sup>2</sup> planted with canola by <a href="Canada" title="wikilink">Canadian</a> farmer <a href="Percy_Schmeiser" title="wikilink">Percy Schmeiser</a> were found to contain <a href="Monsanto_Company" title="wikilink">Monsanto Company</a>'s patented <a href="Roundup_Ready" title="wikilink">Roundup Ready</a> gene although Schmeiser had never purchased seed from Monsanto.<a href="#fn119" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref119"><sup>119</sup></a> The initial source of the plants was undetermined, and could have been through either gene flow or intentional theft. However, the overwhelming predominance of the trait implied that Schmeiser must have intentionally selected for it. The court found that Schmeiser had saved seed from areas on and adjacent to his property where Roundup had been sprayed, such as ditches and near power poles.<a href="#fn120" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref120"><sup>120</sup></a></p>
<p>Although unable to prove direct theft, Monsanto sued Schmeiser for piracy since he knowingly grew <em>Roundup Ready</em> plants without paying royalties (Ibid). The case made it to the Canadian Supreme Court, which in 2004 ruled 5 to 4 in Monsanto&lt;U+2019&gt;s favor.<a href="#fn121" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref121"><sup>121</sup></a><a href="#fn122" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref122"><sup>122</sup></a> The dissenting judges focused primarily on the fact that Monsanto's patents covered only the gene itself and glyphosate resistant <em>cells</em>, and failed to cover transgenic plants in their entirety. All of the judges agreed that Schmeiser would not have to pay any damages since he had not benefited from his use of the genetically modified seed.</p>
<p>In response to criticism, Monsanto Canada's Director of Public Affairs stated that &quot;It is not, nor has it ever been Monsanto Canada's policy to enforce its patent on Roundup Ready crops when they are present on a farmer's field by accident...Only when there has been a knowing and deliberate violation of its patent rights will Monsanto act.&quot;<a href="#fn123" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref123"><sup>123</sup></a></p>

Safety testing of these products will also, at the same time, be necessary to ensure that the perceived benefits will indeed outweigh the perceived and hidden costs of development. Plant scientists, backed by results of modern comprehensive profiling of crop composition, point out that crops modified using GM techniques are less likely to have unintended changes than are conventionally bred crops.<a href="#fn126" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref126"><sup>126</sup></a><a href="#fn127" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref127"><sup>127</sup></a></p>

<p>In 1998 <a href="Rowett_Research_Institute" title="wikilink">Rowett Research Institute</a> scientist <a href="&lt;U+00C1&gt;rp&lt;U+00E1&gt;d_Pusztai" title="wikilink">&lt;U+00C1&gt;rp&lt;U+00E1&gt;d Pusztai</a> reported that consumption of potatoes genetically modified to contain <a href="lectin" class="uri" title="wikilink">lectin</a> had adverse intestinal effects on rats.<a href="#fn135" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref135"><sup>135</sup></a> Pusztai eventually published a letter, co-authored by Stanley Ewen, in the journal, <a href="The_Lancet" title="wikilink">The Lancet</a>. The letter claimed to show that rats fed on potatoes genetically modified with the snowdrop lectin had unusual changes to their gut tissue when compared with rats fed on non modified potatoes.<a href="#fn136" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref136"><sup>136</sup></a> The experiment modified potatoes to add a toxin (snowdrop lectin), but the experiment failed to include a control for the toxin alone or a control for genetic modifications alone (without added toxin); therefore, no conclusion could be made about the safety of the genetic engineering. The experiment has been criticised by other scientists on the grounds that the unmodified potatoes were not a fair control diet and that all the rats may have been sick, due to their being fed a diet of only potatoes.<a href="#fn137" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref137"><sup>137</sup></a></p>
<p>In 2009 three scientists (Vend&lt;U+00F4&gt;mois <em>et al.</em>) published a statistical re-analysis of three feeding trials that had previously been published by others as establishing the safety of genetically modified corn.<a href="#fn138" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref138"><sup>138</sup></a><a href="#fn139" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref139"><sup>139</sup></a><a href="#fn140" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref140"><sup>140</sup></a> The new article claimed that their statistics instead showed that the three patented crops (<a href="MON_810" title="wikilink">MON 810</a>, <a href="MON_863" title="wikilink">MON 863</a>, and NK 603) developed and owned by <a href="Monsanto" class="uri" title="wikilink">Monsanto</a> cause liver, kidney, and heart damage in mammals.<a href="#fn141" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref141"><sup>141</sup></a> A 2007 analysis of part of this data by the same group of scientists funded by Greenpeace<a href="#fn142" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref142"><sup>142</sup></a> was assessed by a panel of independent toxicologists in a study funded by Monsanto and published in the journal <em>Food and chemical toxicology.</em> Some reviewers reported that the study was statistically flawed and providing no evidence of adverse effects.<a href="#fn143" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref143"><sup>143</sup></a> The French High Council of Biotechnologies Scientific Committee reviewed the 2009 Vend&lt;U+00F4&gt;mois <em>et al.</em> study and concluded that it &quot;..presents no admissible scientific element likely to ascribe any haematological, hepatic or renal toxicity to the three re-analysed GMOs.&quot;<a href="#fn144" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref144"><sup>144</sup></a><a href="#fn145" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref145"><sup>145</sup></a> An evaluation by the <a href="European_Food_Safety_Authority" title="wikilink">European Food Safety Authority</a> of the 2009 and 2007 studies noted that most of the results were within natural variation and they did not consider any of the effects reported biologically relevant.<a href="#fn146" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref146"><sup>146</sup></a><a href="#fn147" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref147"><sup>147</sup></a> A review by <a href="Food_Standards_Australia_New_Zealand" title="wikilink">Food Standards Australia New Zealand</a> of the 2009 Vend&lt;U+00F4&gt;mois <em>et al.</em> study concluded that the results were due to chance alone.<a href="#fn148" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref148"><sup>148</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="gene-transfer">Gene transfer</h3>
<p>As of January 2009 there has only been one human feeding study conducted on the effects of genetically modified foods. The study involved seven human volunteers who had previously had their large intestines removed. These volunteers were to eat GM soy to see if the DNA of the GM soy transferred to the bacteria that naturally lives in the human gut. Researchers identified that three of the seven volunteers had transgenes from GM soya transferred into the bacteria living in their gut before the start of the feeding experiment. As this low-frequency transfer did not increase after the consumption of GM Soy, the researchers concluded that gene transfer did not occur during the experiment. In volunteers with complete digestive tracts, the transgene did not survive passage through intact gastrointestinal tract.<a href="#fn149" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref149"><sup>149</sup></a> Anti-GM advocates believe the study should prompt additional testing to determine its significance.<a href="#fn150" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref150"><sup>150</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Other studies have found DNA from M13 virus, GFP and even ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase (<a href="Rubisco" class="uri" title="wikilink">Rubisco</a>) genes in the blood and tissue of ingesting animals.<a href="#fn151" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref151"><sup>151</sup></a><a href="#fn152" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref152"><sup>152</sup></a></p>
<p>Two studies on the possible effects of feeding genetically modified feeds to animals found that there was no significant differences in the safety and nutritional value of feedstuffs containing material derived from genetically modified plants.<a href="#fn153" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref153"><sup>153</sup></a><a href="#fn154" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref154"><sup>154</sup></a> Specifically, the studies noted that no residues of <a href="recombinant_DNA" title="wikilink">recombinant DNA</a> or novel proteins have been found in any organ or tissue samples obtained from animals fed with GMP plants.</p>
<p>&quot;HOWEVER, the only tests conducted on the toxicity of Glyphosate Salt, were conducted by Monsanto, who reported the herbiced as being safe. No testing has been done by the USDA or FDA to support that claim. In some European studies, the herbicide 'glyphosate' was found to be present in control groups of mice that were fed GM soy protein. Also, it was found that second and third generations of mice that were fed GM soy, had significant reproductive defects, compared to mice fed non GM soy. This information should be validated by additional studies conducted in the United States. Until those studies are complete, consumption of GM soy that has been exposed to glyphosate herbicide, should be avoided.&quot;</p>
<h3 id="allergies">Allergies</h3>
<p>In the mid 1990s, Pioneer Hi-Bred tested the allergenicity of a transgenic soybean that expressed a <a href="Brazil_nut" title="wikilink">Brazil nut</a> seed storage protein in hope that the seeds would have increased levels of the <a href="amino_acid" title="wikilink">amino acid</a> methionine. The tests (radioallergosorbent testing, immunoblotting, and skin-prick testing) showed that individuals allergic to Brazil nuts were also allergic to the new GM soybean.<a href="#fn155" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref155"><sup>155</sup></a> Pioneer has indicated that it will not develop commercial cultivars containing Brazil nut protein because the protein is likely to be an allergen.<a href="#fn156" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref156"><sup>156</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="human-exposure-to-pesticides-produced-in-gm-foods">Human exposure to pesticides produced in GM foods</h3>
<p>A 2011 study, the first to evaluate the correlation between maternal and fetal exposure to BT toxin (a protein having insecticidal effects on certain insects, produced by a gene from a soil bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis) produced in genetically modified maize and to determine exposure levels of the pesticides and their metabolites, reported the presence of pesticides associated with GM foods in both non-pregnant women and pregnant women and their fetuses. <a href="#fn157" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref157"><sup>157</sup></a><a href="#fn158" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref158"><sup>158</sup></a> The paper did not discuss safety implications or find any health problems.

<h2 id="traceability">Traceability</h2>
<p>In a January 2010 paper<a href="#fn162" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref162"><sup>162</sup></a> the extraction and detection of DNA along a complete industrial soybean oil processing chain was described to monitor the presence of Roundup Ready (RR) soybean: &quot;The amplification of soybean lectin gene by end-point polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was successfully achieved in all the steps of extraction and refining processes, until the fully refined soybean oil. The amplification of RR soybean by PCR assays using event-specific primers was also achieved for all the extraction and refining steps, except for the intermediate steps of refining (neutralisation, washing and bleaching) possibly due to sample instability. The real-time PCR assays using specific probes confirmed all the results and proved that it is possible to detect and quantify genetically modified organisms in the fully refined soybean oil. To our knowledge, this has never been reported before and represents an important accomplishment regarding the traceability of genetically modified organisms in refined oils.&quot;</p>
<h2 id="genetically-modified-animals">Genetically Modified Animals</h2>
<p>Genetically engineered animals are a powerful method of introducing desirable traits into animals using [recombinant DNA] technology by adding, changing or removing certain DNA sequences to modify the charachteristics of the animal. <a href="#fn163" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref163"><sup>163</sup></a> The process of genetically engineering animals is a slow and tedious process that requires a large amount of funds. Thanks to new technologies being introduced, genetically modifying animals is becoming easier and more precise. This is not only transforming science, but could also transform the food we eat. <a href="#fn164" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref164"><sup>164</sup></a></p>
<p>The first transgenic (genetically modified animal), was produced by injecting DNA into eggs, implanting the eggs in animals and then waiting weeks or months to see if any offspring had incorporated the extra DNA. At first only about 10% performed correctly, in the end making this a long and expensive.<a href="#fn165" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref165"><sup>165</sup></a></p>
<p>Genetically modified animals currently being developed can be placed into six different broad classes based on the intended purpose of the genetic modification: (1) to inhance production or food quality traits (faster growing fish, pigs that expel less toxins); (2) to improve animal health (disease resistance); (3) to produce products intended for human theraputic use (pharmacutical products or tissue for implantation); (4) to inrich or inhance the animals' interactions with humans (hypo-allerganic pets); (5) to deveolop animal models for human diseases (pigs as models for cardiovascular disease); (6) and to produce industrial or consumer products (fibers for multiple uses). <a href="#fn166" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref166"><sup>166</sup></a></p>

<p>New traits can be introduced into animals. Here's how it works for animals engineered to produce a human pharmaceutical. Diagram to the right.</p>
<p>1. Generation of the DNA Construct</p>
<p>A. Milk Protein Promoter DNA: allows for expression only in goat mammary glands.</p>
<p>B. Therapeutic Protein Gene: encodes a protein known to treat disease in people.</p>
<p>C. Terminator Sequence: assures that only the gene of interest is controlled by A.</p>
<p>D. Other DNA Sequences: helps with the introduction of the new combination DNA strand.</p>
<p>2. The DNA construct is created by combining A, B, C and D.</p>
<p>3. This new DNA strand is then introduced by any of a number of methods into an animal cell, such as an egg, that is then used to produce a genetically engineered animal.</p>
<p>4. The first genetically engineered goat is produced.</p>
<p>5. The offspring of the first genetically engineered goats, referred to as production animals, are milked. The milk is transferred to a purification facility.</p>
<p>6. The drug to be used to treat human disease is purified from the goat's milk. <a href="#fn167" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref167"><sup>167</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="enviropig">Enviropig</h2>

</figure>
<p>Enviropig is a genetically enhanced line of <a href="Yorkshire_pig" title="wikilink">Yorkshire pigs</a> created with the capability of digesting plant phosphorus more efficiently than conventional Yorkshire pigs.<a href="#fn168" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref168"><sup>168</sup></a> These pigs produce the enzyme phytase (breaks down the indigestible phosphorus) in the salivary glands that is secreted in the saliva. The enzyme <a href="phytase" class="uri" title="wikilink">phytase</a> is introduced into the pig chromosome by pronuclear [microinjection]. With this enzyme, Enviropig is able to digest cereal grain <a href="phosphorus" class="uri" title="wikilink">phosphorus</a>, so there is then no need to supplement the pigs diet with either <a href="phosphate_minerals" title="wikilink">phosphate mineralsor</a> commercially produced phytase, yielding less phosphorus in the manure.<a href="#fn169" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref169"><sup>169</sup></a></p>
<p>Enviropig has beneficial attributes; it reduces feeds costs because farmers are not required to purchase special feed for their pigs which include the phytase, and reduces the potential of water pollution.<a href="#fn170" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref170"><sup>170</sup></a> High concentrations of phosphorus in water streams cause an outbreak in algal growth, because phosphorus is the major nutrient which enables algal to grow.<a href="#fn171" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref171"><sup>171</sup></a> The increase in <a href="algal" class="uri" title="wikilink">algal</a> population decreases the amount of oxygen in the waters resulting in dead zones for fish because the algal depletes the waters oxygen. This would not only be advantageous for the waters surrounding the pigs, but also for the water neighboring the areas which use the <a href="manure" class="uri" title="wikilink">manure</a> for fertilizers.</p>
<p>As of now, there are not regulations or pending approvals on the Enviropig for human consumption according to the FDA.org website.</p>

Chairman Professor Sir David King, Chief Scientific Advisor to the UK Government, P 9: &quot;...it is necessary to produce about 100 GM plants to obtain one that has the desirable characters for its use as a basis of a new GM crop variety. ...Most of these so-called conventional plant breeding methods (such as gene transfer by pollination, mutation breeding, cell selection and induced polyploidy) have a substantially greater discard rate. Mutation breeding, for instance, involves the production of unpredictable and undirected genetic changes and many thousands, even millions, of undesirable plants are discarded in order to identify plants with suitable qualities for further breeding.&quot;<a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-back">↩</a></li>
