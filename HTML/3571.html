<p><strong>James Russell Lowell</strong> (February 22, 1819 &lt;U+2013&gt; August 12, 1891) was an <a href="United_States" title="wikilink">American</a> <a href="Romanticism" title="wikilink">Romantic</a> poet, critic, editor, and <a href="diplomat" class="uri" title="wikilink">diplomat</a>. He is associated with the <a href="Fireside_Poets" title="wikilink">Fireside Poets</a>, a group of <a href="New_England" title="wikilink">New England</a> writers who were among the first American poets who rivaled the popularity of British poets. These poets usually used conventional forms and meters in their poetry, making them suitable for families entertaining at their fireside.</p>
<p>Lowell graduated from <a href="Harvard_College" title="wikilink">Harvard College</a> in 1838, despite his reputation as a troublemaker, and went on to earn a law degree from <a href="Harvard_Law_School" title="wikilink">Harvard Law School</a>. He published his first collection of poetry in 1841 and married <a href="Maria_White_Lowell" title="wikilink">Maria White</a> in 1844. He and his wife had several children, though only one survived past childhood. The couple soon become involved in the <a href="Abolitionism" title="wikilink">slavery abolition movement</a>, with Lowell using poetry to express his anti-<a href="slavery_in_the_United_States" title="wikilink">slavery</a> views and taking a job in <a href="Philadelphia,_Pennsylvania" title="wikilink">Philadelphia, Pennsylvania</a> as the editor of an abolitionist newspaper. After moving back to Cambridge, Lowell was one of the founders of a journal called <em>The Pioneer</em>, which lasted only three issues. He gained notoriety in 1848 with the publication of <em><a href="A_Fable_for_Critics" title="wikilink">A Fable for Critics</a></em>, a book-length poem <a href="satire" title="wikilink">satirizing</a> contemporary critics and poets. The same year, he published <em>The Biglow Papers</em>, which increased his fame. He would publish several other poetry collections and essay collections throughout his literary career.</p>
<p>Maria White died in 1853 and Lowell accepted a professorship of languages at Harvard in 1854. He traveled to Europe before officially assuming his role in 1856; he continued to teach there for twenty years. He married his second wife, Frances Dunlap, shortly thereafter in 1857. That year Lowell also became editor of <em><a href="The_Atlantic_Monthly" title="wikilink">The Atlantic Monthly</a></em>. It was not until 20 years later that Lowell received his first political appointment: the ambassadorship to Spain and, later, to England. He spent his last years in Cambridge, in the same estate where he was born, where he also died in 1891.</p>
<p>Lowell believed that the poet played an important role as a prophet and critic of society. He used poetry for reform, particularly in abolitionism. However, Lowell's commitment to the anti-slavery cause wavered over the years, as did his opinion on African-Americans. Lowell attempted to emulate the true Yankee accent in the dialogue of his characters, particularly in <em>The Biglow Papers</em>. This depiction of the dialect, as well as Lowell's many satires, were an inspiration to writers like <a href="Mark_Twain" title="wikilink">Mark Twain</a> and <a href="H._L._Mencken" title="wikilink">H. L. Mencken</a>. Nevertheless, Lowell's poetry has been criticized by many for its lack of force, its poor quality, and for being forgettable.</p>

<p>Beginning in 1834, at the age of 15, Lowell attended <a href="Harvard_College" title="wikilink">Harvard College</a>, though he was not a good student and often got into trouble.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> In his sophomore year alone, he was absent from required chapel attendance 14 times and from classes 56 times.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> In his last year there, he wrote, &quot;During Freshman year, I did nothing, during Sophomore year I did nothing, during Junior year I did nothing, and during Senior year I have thus far done nothing in the way of college studies&quot;.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> In his senior year, he became one of the editors of <em><a href="Harvardiana" class="uri" title="wikilink">Harvardiana</a></em> literary magazine, to which he contributed prose and poetry that he admitted was of low quality. As he said later, &quot;I was as great an ass as ever brayed &amp; thought it singing&quot;.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> Lowell was elected the poet of the class of 1838<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> and, as was tradition, was asked to recite an original poem on Class Day, the day before Commencement, on July 17, 1838.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> Lowell, however, was suspended and not allowed to participate. Instead, his poem was printed and made available thanks to subscriptions paid by his classmates.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<p>Not knowing what vocation to choose after graduating, he vacillated among <a href="business" class="uri" title="wikilink">business</a>, the <a href="religious_ministry" title="wikilink">ministry</a>, medicine and law. Having decided to practice law, he enrolled at the <a href="Harvard_Law_School" title="wikilink">Harvard Law School</a> in 1840 and was admitted to the bar two years later.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> While studying law, however, he contributed poems and prose articles to various magazines. During this time, Lowell was admittedly depressed and often had <a href="suicide" title="wikilink">suicidal</a> thoughts. He once confided to a friend that he held a cocked pistol to his forehead and considered killing himself at the age of 20.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="marriage-and-family">Marriage and family</h3>
<p>In late 1839, Lowell met <a href="Maria_White_Lowell" title="wikilink">Maria White</a> through her brother William, a classmate of his at Harvard.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> The two became engaged in the autumn of 1840; her father Abijah White, a wealthy merchant from <a href="Watertown,_Massachusetts" title="wikilink">Watertown</a>, insisted that their wedding be postponed until Lowell had gainful employment.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> They were finally married on December 26, 1844,<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> shortly after the groom published <em>Conversations on the Old Poets</em>, a collection of his previously published essays.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> A friend described their relationship as &quot;the very picture of a True Marriage&quot;;<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> Lowell himself believed she was made up &quot;half of earth and more than of Heaven&quot;.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> Like Lowell, she wrote poetry and the next twelve years of Lowell's life were deeply affected by her influence. He said his first book of poetry, <em>A Year's Life</em> (1841), &quot;owes all its beauty to her&quot;, though it only sold 300 copies.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> Her character and beliefs led her to become involved in the movements directed against intemperance and slavery. White was a member of the Boston Female Anti-Slavery Society and convinced Lowell to become an <a href="abolitionism" title="wikilink">abolitionist</a>.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> Lowell had previously expressed anti-slavery sentiments but White urged him towards more active expression and involvement.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> His second volume of poems, <em>Miscellaneous Poems</em>, expressed these anti-slavery thoughts and its 1,500 copies sold well.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a></p>
<p>Maria was in poor health and, thinking her lungs could heal there, the couple moved to <a href="Philadelphia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Philadelphia</a> shortly after their marriage.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> In Philadelphia, he became a contributing editor for the <em>Pennsylvania Freeman</em>, an abolitionist newspaper.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> In the spring of 1845, the Lowells returned to <a href="Cambridge,_Massachusetts" title="wikilink">Cambridge</a> to make their home at Elmwood. They had four children, though only one survived past infancy. Their first, Blanche, was born December 31, 1845, but lived only fifteen months; Rose, born in 1849, survived only a few months as well; their only son, Walter, was born in 1850 but died in 1852.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> Lowell was very affected by the loss of almost all of his children. His grief over the loss of his first daughter in particular was expressed in his poem &quot;<a href="s:The_First_Snowfall" title="wikilink">The First Snowfall</a>&quot; (1847).<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> Again, Lowell considered suicide, writing to a friend that he thought &quot;of my razors and my throat and that I am a fool and a coward not to end it all at once&quot;.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="literary-career">Literary career</h3>
<p>Lowell's earliest poems were published without pay in the <em><a href="Southern_Literary_Messenger" title="wikilink">Southern Literary Messenger</a></em> in 1840.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> Lowell was inspired to new efforts towards self-support and joined with his friend Robert Carter in founding a literary journal, <em>The Pioneer</em>.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> The periodical was characterized by most of its content being new rather than previously published elsewhere and by having very serious criticism which covered not only literature but also art and music.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> Lowell wrote that it would &quot;furnish the intelligent and reflecting portion of the Reading Public with a rational substitute for the enormous quantity of thrice-diluted trash, in the shape of namby-pamby love tales and sketches, which is monthly poured out to them by many of our popular Magazines&quot;.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> <a href="William_Wetmore_Story" title="wikilink">William Wetmore Story</a> noted the journal's higher taste, writing that, &quot;it took some stand &amp; appealled to a higher intellectual Standard than our <a href="wikt:puerile" title="wikilink">puerile</a> milk o watery namby-pamby Mags with which we are overrun&quot;.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> The first issue of the journal included the first appearance of &quot;<a href="The_Tell-Tale_Heart" title="wikilink">The Tell-Tale Heart</a>&quot; by <a href="Edgar_Allan_Poe" title="wikilink">Edgar Allan Poe</a>.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> Lowell, shortly after the first issue, was treated for an eye disease in New York and, in his absence, Carter did a poor job managing the journal.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> After three monthly numbers, beginning in January 1843, the magazine ceased publication, leaving Lowell $1,800 in debt.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> Poe mourned the journal's demise, calling it &quot;a most severe blow to the cause&lt;U+2014&gt;the cause of a Pure Taste&quot;.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a></p>
<p>Despite the failure of <em>The Pioneer</em>, Lowell continued his interest in the literary world. He wrote a series on &quot;Anti-Slavery in the United States&quot; for the <em><a href="London_Daily_News" title="wikilink">London Daily News</a></em>, though it was discontinued by the editors after four articles in May 1846.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> Lowell had published these articles anonymously, believing they would have more impact if they were not known to be the work of a committed abolitionist.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> In the spring of 1848 he formed a connection with the <em>National Anti-Slavery Standard of New York</em>, agreeing to contribute weekly either a poem or a prose article. After only one year, he was asked to contribute half as often to the <em>Standard</em> to make room for contributions from another writer and reformer named Edmund Quincy.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a></p>

A <a href="satire" class="uri" title="wikilink">satire</a>, it was published anonymously; in it, Lowell took good-natured jabs at his contemporary poets and critics. It proved popular, and the first three thousand copies sold out quickly.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> Not all the subjects included were pleased, however. Edgar Allan Poe, who had been referred to as part genius and &quot;two-fifths sheer fudge&quot;, reviewed the work in the <em><a href="Southern_Literary_Messenger" title="wikilink">Southern Literary Messenger</a></em> and called it &quot;'loose'&lt;U+2014&gt;ill-conceived and feebly executed, as well in detail as in general... we confess some surprise at his putting forth so unpolished a performance&quot;.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a> Lowell offered the profits from the book's success, which proved relatively small, to his New York friend <a href="Charles_Frederick_Briggs" title="wikilink">Charles Frederick Briggs</a>, despite his own financial needs.<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1848, Lowell also published <em>The Biglow Papers</em>, later named by the <a href="Grolier_Club" title="wikilink">Grolier Club</a> as the most influential book of 1848.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a> The first 1,500 copies sold out within a week and a second edition was soon issued, though Lowell made no profit having had to absorb the cost of <a href="stereotype_(printing)" title="wikilink">stereotyping</a> the book himself.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a> The book presented three main characters, each representing different aspects of American life and using authentic American dialects in their dialogue.<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a> Under the surface, <em>The Biglow Papers</em> was also a denunciation of the <a href="Mexican&lt;U+2013&gt;American_War" title="wikilink">Mexican&lt;U+2013&gt;American War</a> and war in general.<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a></p>

<p>In 1850, Lowell's mother died unexpectedly, as did his third daughter, Rose. Her death left Lowell depressed and reclusive for six months, despite the birth of his son Walter by the end of the year. He wrote to a friend that death &quot;is a private tutor. We have no fellow-scholars, and must lay our lessons to heart alone&quot;.<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a> These personal troubles as well as the <a href="Compromise_of_1850" title="wikilink">Compromise of 1850</a> inspired Lowell to accept an offer from William Wetmore Story to spend a winter in <a href="Italy" class="uri" title="wikilink">Italy</a>.<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a> To pay for the trip, Lowell sold land around Elmwood, intending to sell off further acres of the estate over time to supplement his income, ultimately selling off 25 of the original 30 acres.<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a> Walter died suddenly in <a href="Rome" class="uri" title="wikilink">Rome</a> of <a href="cholera" class="uri" title="wikilink">cholera</a>, and Lowell and his wife, with their daughter Mabel, returned to the United States in October 1852.<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a> Lowell published recollections of his journey in several magazines, many of which would be collected years later as <em>Fireside Travels</em> (1867). He also edited volumes with biographical sketches for a series on <em>British Poets</em>.<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a></p>
<p>His wife Maria, who had been suffering from poor health for many years, became very ill in the spring of 1853 and died on October 27<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a> of <a href="tuberculosis" class="uri" title="wikilink">tuberculosis</a>.<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a> Just before her burial, her coffin was opened so that her daughter Mabel could see her face while Lowell &quot;leaned for a long while against a tree weeping&quot;, according to the <a href="Henry_Wadsworth_Longfellow" title="wikilink">Henry Wadsworth Longfellow</a> and his wife, who were in attendance.<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a> In 1855, Lowell oversaw the publication of a memorial volume of his wife's poetry, with only fifty copies for private circulation.<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a> Despite his self-described &quot;naturally joyous&quot; nature,<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a> life for Lowell at Elmwood was further complicated by his father becoming deaf in his old age, and the deteriorating mental state of his sister Rebecca, who sometimes went a week without speaking.<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a> He again cut himself off from others, becoming reclusive at Elmwood, and his private diaries from this time period are riddled with the initials of his wife.<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a> On March 10, 1854, for example, he wrote: &quot;Dark without &amp; within.

<p>At the invitation of his cousin <a href="John_Amory_Lowell" title="wikilink">John Amory Lowell</a>, James Russell Lowell was asked to deliver a lecture at the prestigious Lowell Institute.<a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a> Some speculated the opportunity was because of the family connection, offered as an attempt to bring him out of his depression.<a href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a> Lowell chose to speak on &quot;The English Poets&quot;, telling his friend Briggs that he would take revenge on dead poets &quot;for the injuries received by one whom the public won't allow among the living&quot;.<a href="#fn67" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a> The first of the twelve-part lecture series was to be on January 9, 1855, though by December, Lowell had only completed writing five of them, hoping for last-minute inspiration.<a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a> His first lecture was on <a href="John_Milton" title="wikilink">John Milton</a> and the auditorium was oversold; Lowell had to give a repeat performance the next afternoon.<a href="#fn69" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref69"><sup>69</sup></a> Lowell, who had never spoken in public before, was praised for these lectures. <a href="Francis_James_Child" title="wikilink">Francis James Child</a> said that Lowell, who he deemed was typically &quot;perverse&quot;, was able to &quot;persist in being serious contrary to his impulses and his talents&quot;.<a href="#fn70" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a> While his series was still in progress, Lowell was offered the Smith Professorship of Modern Languages at Harvard, a post vacated by Longfellow, at an annual salary of $1,200, though he never applied for it.<a href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a> The job description was changing after Longfellow; instead of teaching languages directly, Lowell would supervise the department's delivery of two lecture courses per year on topics of his own choosing.<a href="#fn72" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref72"><sup>72</sup></a> Lowell accepted the appointment, with the proviso that he should have a year of study abroad.

Primarily, however, Lowell spent his time abroad studying languages, particularly German, which he found difficult. He complained: &quot;The confounding genders! If I die I shall have engraved on my tombstone that I died of <em>der, die, das,</em> not because I caught them but because I couldn't.&quot;<a href="#fn75" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref75"><sup>75</sup></a></p>
<p>He returned to the United States in the summer of 1856 and began his college duties.<a href="#fn76" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref76"><sup>76</sup></a> Towards the end of his professorship, then-president of Harvard <a href="Charles_Eliot_Norton" title="wikilink">Charles Eliot Norton</a> noted that Lowell seemed to have &quot;no natural inclination&quot; to teach; Lowell agreed, but retained his position for twenty years.<a href="#fn77" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref77"><sup>77</sup></a> He focused on teaching literature, rather than <a href="etymology" class="uri" title="wikilink">etymology</a>, hoping that his students would learn to enjoy the sound, rhythm, and flow of poetry rather than the technique of words.<a href="#fn78" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref78"><sup>78</sup></a> He summed up his method: &quot;True scholarship consists in knowing not what things exists, but what they mean; it is not memory but judgment&quot;.<a href="#fn79" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref79"><sup>79</sup></a> Still grieving the loss of his wife, during this time Lowell avoided Elmwood and instead lived on Kirkland Street in Cambridge, an area known as Professors' Row.

<p>Lowell had intended never to remarry after the death of his wife Maria White.

<h2 id="beliefs">Beliefs</h2>
<p>Although he was an abolitionist, Lowell's opinions on African-Americans wavered. Though Lowell advocated suffrage for blacks, he noted that their ability to vote could be troublesome. Even so, he wrote, &quot;We believe the white race, by their intellectual and traditional superiority, will retain sufficient ascendancy to prevent any serious mischief from the new order of things&quot;.<a href="#fn148" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref148"><sup>148</sup></a> Freed slaves, he wrote, were &quot;dirty, lazy &amp; lying&quot;.<a href="#fn149" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref149"><sup>149</sup></a> Even before his marriage to the abolitionist Maria White, Lowell wrote: &quot;The abolitionists are the only ones with whom I sympathize of the present extant parties.&quot;<a href="#fn150" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref150"><sup>150</sup></a> After his marriage, Lowell at first did not share White's enthusiasm for the cause but was eventually pulled in.<a href="#fn151" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref151"><sup>151</sup></a> The couple often gave money to fugitive slaves, even when their own financial situation was not strong, especially if they were asked to free a spouse or child.<a href="#fn152" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref152"><sup>152</sup></a> Even so, he did not always fully agree with the followers of the movement.

They think them unwholesome unless they are swallowed, stones and all.&quot;<a href="#fn153" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref153"><sup>153</sup></a> Lowell depicted Southerners very unfavorably in his second collection of <em>The Biglow Papers</em> but, by 1865, admitted that Southerners were &quot;guilty only of weakness&quot; and, by 1868, said that he sympathized with Southerners and their viewpoint on slavery.<a href="#fn154" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref154"><sup>154</sup></a> Enemies and friends of Lowell alike questioned his vacillating interest in the question of slavery. Abolitionist <a href="Samuel_Joseph_May" title="wikilink">Samuel Joseph May</a> accused Lowell of trying to quit the movement because of his association with Harvard and the <a href="Boston_Brahmin" title="wikilink">Boston Brahmin</a> culture: &quot;Having got into the smooth, dignified, self-complacent, and change-hating society of the college and its Boston circles, Lowell has gone over to the world, and to 'respectability'.&quot;<a href="#fn155" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref155"><sup>155</sup></a></p>
