<p><strong>Hurricane Elida</strong> was the sixth <a href="tropical_cyclone" title="wikilink">tropical cyclone</a>, fifth named storm, and second hurricane of the <a href="2008_Pacific_hurricane_season" title="wikilink">2008 Pacific hurricane season</a>. Elida formed out of a weak tropical wave which formed off the western coast of Central America on July 8. The wave remained poorly organized over the next two days before developing a surface low. The low was declared Tropical Depression Six-E on July 11 while located to the south of Guatemala. The depression intensified into Tropical Storm Elida the next morning. Elida intensified steadily over the next two days before being upgraded to a hurricane. Elida fluctuated in intensity over the next several days before reaching its peak intensity on July 16 with winds of 105 mph (165 km/h). Elida slowly weakened as it passed over cooling waters and was downgraded to a tropical storm on July 18 and further downgraded to a tropical depression on July 19. Elida degenerated into a remnant low shortly after, and completely dissipated on July 21 over open waters.</p>

<p>Hurricane Elida developed out of a weak <a href="tropical_wave" title="wikilink">tropical wave</a> which formed off the western coast of <a href="Central_America" title="wikilink">Central America</a> on July 8. It is possible that the wave formed in the <a href="Atlantic_Ocean" title="wikilink">Atlantic Ocean</a>, but there is little evidence to support this theory. The system remained poorly organized for two days before gaining enough <a href="Atmospheric_convection" title="wikilink">convection</a> to be classified using the <a href="Dvorak_technique" title="wikilink">Dvorak technique</a> on July 10, while located 290 <a href="mile" title="wikilink">mi</a> (465 <a href="kilometer" title="wikilink">km</a>) south of <a href="Guatemala" class="uri" title="wikilink">Guatemala</a>. Later that day, a surface low developed but convection remained minimal. During the night and through the morning of July 11, convection increased sufficiently and a <a href="Tropical_Cyclone_Formation_Alert" title="wikilink">tropical cyclone formation alert</a> was issued. It was determined in the tropical cyclone report that by the end of the day, the storm had become Tropical Depression Six-E, six hours earlier than the operational data.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a><a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> At the time of the upgrade, the depression was located 360 mi (580 km) south-southeast of <a href="Puerto_Angel,_Mexico" title="wikilink">Puerto Angel, Mexico</a>. The depression was moving towards the west-northwest at 16 mph (26 km/h) due to a low to mid-level <a href="Ridge_(meteorology)" title="wikilink">ridge</a> located to the north of the storm.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>The depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Elida early on July 12 while located 200 mi (370 km) south of Puerto Angel, Mexico.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> Elida's foreward motion slowed somewhat to 14 mph (22 km/h) as it neared the southwestern edge of the mid-level ridge. The west-northwest movement was expected to continue for the duration of the storm. Deep convection developed around the center of circulation and a strong banding feature formed along the western side of the storm.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> Slow strengthening took place throughout the morning as the center remained underneath the deep convection. Outflow to the north of the storm was slightly restricted, indicating that there was some easterly <a href="Wind_shear" title="wikilink">wind shear</a>.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> During the afternoon, a well defined banding feature appeared in the northeastern semi-circle of the storm. However, outflow to the north remained highly constricted. Elida began to move slightly faster, still being influenced by the mid-level ridge. The foreword motion was forecast to slow down in the two to three day range as it moved away from the ridge.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> Overnight, wind shear began to weaken and outflow to the north of Elida was established.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> By the morning of July 13, banding features and outflow were present all around the storm, but wind shear managed to keep the center of Elida slightly displaced from the deepest convection. A weakening mid to upper-level trough located just west of <a href="Baja_California" title="wikilink">Baja California</a> was forecasted to move towards the west over the next two to three days. The movement of the trough would allow the ridge to build westward. This would cause Elida to make a westerly turn.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> Later in the morning, the wind shear lessened and the overall symmetry of Elida improved.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> In the early afternoon, a burst of convection near the center of Elida had formed and weakened and the structure remained unchanged and the storm still did not have signs of a developing <a href="Eye_(cyclone)" title="wikilink">eyewall</a>.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> During the night, Elida still failed to develop an eyewall. However, by this point the shear had lessened significantly from its level at the storm's formation and strengthening was anticipated.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<p>In the early afternoon hours, Tropical Storm Elida was upgraded to Hurricane Elida due to a satellite indication of an eye forming at the lower levels in the storm. However, this was not apparent from visible satellite image, as it was covered by the central dense overcast.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> In the late morning hours, the eye continued to develop and Elida intensified slightly.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> A ragged eye appeared in the afternoon as the structure of the storm improved. At this point, forecasters thought the Elida had peaked in intensity or was near its peak. Elida's motion slowed to 10 mph (16 km/h) and shifted from a west-northwest direction to a westerly direction as the ridge located to the north of the storm began influencing the trajectory.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a>The eye disappeared shortly after but the intensity was kept at 85 mph (135 km/h).<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> By the morning of July 15, easterly wind shear began to increase, causing Elida to become less symmetrical.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> The wind shear persisted through the morning and slowly weakened the storm.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> By the afternoon, Elida was barely holding onto hurricane status as both wind shear and cooling weakened the system.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> Overnight, Elida became better organized as convection wrapped around an eye which was discovered by a microwave satellite despite shear remaining at a modest intensity.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>
<p><img src="Elida_Asmr-e_2201_July_17.jpg" title="fig:Microwave satellite image of Elida on July 17 showing the embedded eye within the weakening hurricane." alt="Microwave satellite image of Elida on July 17 showing the embedded eye within the weakening hurricane." /> On the morning of July 16, the eye appeared on <a href="infrared" class="uri" title="wikilink">infrared</a> satellite and <a href="cirrus_cloud" title="wikilink">cirrus</a> outflow improved all around the system. However, Elida was nearing the 26&lt;U+00B0&gt;<a href="Celsius" title="wikilink">C</a> (78&lt;U+00B0&gt;<a href="Fahrenheit" title="wikilink">F</a>) <a href="isotherm" class="uri" title="wikilink">isotherm</a>, which is the lowest water temperature required for a tropical cyclone. The mid-level ridge to the north of Elida was now forecast to move with the storm, ensuring westward motion and slightly increasing the foreword speed to 12 mph (19 km/h). Elida maintained this general motion for the duration of its existence with some minor fluctuation in speed and an eventual southerly tilt.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a><a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> The eye quickly disappeared from infrared satellite later in the morning, but deep convection persisted on the eastern side of the center of circulation.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> In the afternoon, an eye appeared embedded in the deep convection and Elida intensified into a <a href="Saffir-Simpson_Hurricane_Scale" title="wikilink">category two</a> hurricane with winds of 105 mph (165 km/) while located 630 mi (1015 km) southwest of <a href="Cabo_San_Lucas" title="wikilink">Cabo San Lucas</a>, <a href="Mexico" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mexico</a>. <a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a><a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> By the nighttime hours, the cloud tops in the northern semi-circle of Elida warmed but the intensity remained unchanged.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> On the morning of July 17, cold waters began to take their toll on Elida and the eye became cloud filled and less distinct.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> In the late morning, Elida weakened to a category one hurricane as determined in the tropical cyclone report.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> Operationally, it was thought to have maintained winds of 100 mph (155 km/h).<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> Despite continuing deep convection near the center of Elida and even an embedded eye, the center was lagging behind, making the storm slightly tilted.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> Elida produced a large amount of deep convection overnight, but the winds continued to lessen. The storm continued to move over colder waters, but wind shear was forecast to lessen, leading to slow, steady weakening.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a></p>
<p>By the morning of July 18, cloud tops associated with Elida warmed and the storm was downgraded to a tropical storm.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> Despite being over very cool waters, Elida managed to maintain a small area of deep convection as it slowly weakened.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> In the afternoon, the cold water took its toll on Elida. Most of the convection had dissipated and all that remained, save a small area of deep convection to the west of the center, was a swirl of clouds.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> The small area of convection shifted to the east side of the center overnight, allowing Elida to remain a tropical storm with winds barely at 40 mph (65 km/h).<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> By the morning of July 19, Elida was traversing waters of 23&lt;U+00B0&gt;C (73&lt;U+00B0&gt;F) and all the deep convection had dissipated. Due to the lack of convection, Elida was downgraded to a tropical depression.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> Cold waters prevented any convection from redeveloping in the late morning, and it was unlikely that any convection would form.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> Elida was later declared a remnant low that afternoon as the system had been devoid of convection for twelve hours.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> The remnant low continued moving towards the west-southwest before dissipating into an open trough on July 21 while located 690 mi (1,110 km) east-southeast of the <a href="Hawaii" title="wikilink">Hawaiian Islands</a>.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="impact-and-naming">Impact and naming</h2>
<p>Although Elida was fairly close to the coast of Mexico as a tropical storm, it remained far enough away for there to be no impact on the coastline. No other land areas were affected by Elida and there were no ship reports of tropical storm-force winds. Due to the lack of damage, the name Elida was not retired and is on the list of names for the <a href="List_of_Pacific_hurricane_seasons" title="wikilink">2014 Pacific hurricane season</a>.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a></p>
<p>When Tropical Depression Six-E was upgraded to Tropical Storm Elida, it was the fifth time that the name was used for a tropical cyclone in the <a href="Pacific_Ocean" title="wikilink">Eastern Pacific</a>. Hurricane Elida was used previously in 1984, 1990, 1996, and <a href="Hurricane_Elida_(2002)" title="wikilink">2002</a>.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a></p>
