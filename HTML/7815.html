<p><strong>Lemmons</strong>, also known as <strong>Gladsmuir House</strong>, was the home of novelists <a href="Kingsley_Amis" title="wikilink">Kingsley Amis</a> (1922&lt;U+2013&gt;1995) and <a href="Elizabeth_Jane_Howard" title="wikilink">Elizabeth Jane Howard</a> (1923&lt;U+2013&gt;2014) on <a href="Monken_Hadley_Common" title="wikilink">Hadley Common</a>, <a href="Monken_Hadley" title="wikilink">Monken Hadley</a>, on the border of <a href="north_London" title="wikilink">north London</a> and <a href="Hertfordshire" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hertfordshire</a>.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>The couple bought the <a href="Georgian_architecture" title="wikilink">Georgian house</a> and its eight acres of land at auction for &lt;U+00A3&gt;48,000 in 1968, and lived there until 1976.

<p>Jane and Kingsley lived at Lemmons with Jane's mother and brother, two artist friends, and Kingsley's three children, Philip, <a href="Martin_Amis" title="wikilink">Martin</a> and Sally. Several of the family's novels were written at Lemmons, including Kingsley's <em><a href="The_Green_Man" title="wikilink">The Green Man</a></em> (1969) and <em><a href="The_Alteration" title="wikilink">The Alteration</a></em> (1976), Jane's <em>Odd Girl Out</em> (1972) and <em>Mr. Wrong</em> (1975), and Martin's <em><a href="The_Rachel_Papers_(novel)" title="wikilink">The Rachel Papers</a></em> (1973) and <em><a href="Dead_Babies_(novel)" title="wikilink">Dead Babies</a></em> (1975).<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>

<p>The land and an earlier house were owned by Henry Bellamy in 1584. The Quilter family owned the land from 1736 to 1909 (it was an estate of 23 acres in 1778).<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> A Major Hemery appears to have lived in the house in or around 1881.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> Captain Thomas Hall Rokeby Plumer, the 2nd <a href="Viscount_Plumer" title="wikilink">Viscount Plumer</a>, lived there in the 1920s.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<p>The writer <a href="Frances_Trollope" title="wikilink">Frances Trollope</a>, mother of novelist <a href="Anthony_Trollope" title="wikilink">Anthony Trollope</a>, rented a house on Hadley Common from January 1836 until the early summer of 1838, possibly Gladsmuir, shortly after the death of her husband and one of her sons.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> According to Robert Bradford in his 2011 biography of Martin Amis, Jane Howard discovered the Trollope connection from the house's papers, and said that Frances Trollope had purchased it, although a purchase seems unlikely given the Trollope family's finances.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<p>Frances Trollope, her daughters, Emily and Cecilia, and two of her sons, Anthony and Tom, moved to Hadley Common in 1836 from <a href="Bruges" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bruges</a>, Belgium, where they had fled to escape debtors' prison in England.

<p>Trollope described the property as a &quot;pleasant house with a good garden on the common at Hadley, near Barnet,&quot; and her &quot;pretty cottage.&quot; R. H. Super writes that she invited eight guests to stay with her one Christmas, in addition to her family, so referring to it as a cottage was somewhat misleading.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> The move did not, in the end, help Emily, who died in February 1836. She was buried in the nearby churchyard at the Church of St Mary the Virgin. Anthony Trollope later placed one of his characters, in <em>The Bertrams</em> (1859), in a dull country house in Hadley.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>

<p>Kingsley and Jane married in 1965 after meeting two years earlier at the <a href="Cheltenham_Literary_Festival" title="wikilink">Cheltenham Literary Festival</a>, which she had helped to organize.

<p>The core household consisted of Jane and Kingsley; Jane's mother, Katherine (&quot;Kit&quot;), a former ballerina, who died in the house in 1972; one of Jane's brothers, Colin (&quot;Monkey&quot;); and artists Sargy Mann and Terry Raybauld.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> The housekeeper, Mrs. Uniacke, lived in Gladsmuir Cottage.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> Kingsley's children, Philip, Martin and Sally lived in the house from time to time, mostly outside term time, or at weekends in the case of Philip and Martin; the children were 17, 16 and 12 when Kingsley and Jane married.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> Sally moved into Lemmons in 1970 when Martin was in his second year at Oxford.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a></p>
<p>It was Jane who encouraged Martin to start reading. When she and Kingsley married, Martin was reading comics and <a href="Harold_Robbins" title="wikilink">Harold Robbins</a>; she recommended <a href="Jane_Austen" title="wikilink">Jane Austen</a>, <a href="Charles_Dickens" title="wikilink">Charles Dickens</a>, <a href="Scott_Fitzgerald" title="wikilink">Scott Fitzgerald</a>, <a href="Evelyn_Waugh" title="wikilink">Evelyn Waugh</a>, <a href="Graham_Greene" title="wikilink">Graham Greene</a> and <a href="William_Golding" title="wikilink">William Golding</a>. She also advised him to try for a place at Oxford, for which he said he owed her an &quot;unknowable debt.&quot; After 12 months at Sussex Tutors (a <a href="Cram_school#United_Kingdom" title="wikilink">crammer</a> in Brighton) in 1967&lt;U+2013&gt;1968, he passed six O-levels and 3 A-levels, and won an <a href="Exhibition_(scholarship)" title="wikilink">exhibition</a> to <a href="Exeter_College,_Oxford" title="wikilink">Exeter College, Oxford</a>.<ref>Amis 2000, pp. 13&lt;U+2013&gt;14 (for Sussex Tutors), 121 (for &quot;unknowable debt&quot;), 126 (for the exhibition), 173 (for Exeter).</p>

<p>&quot;After just over a year of Jane's tutelage (much of it spent in a last-ditch boarding crammer in Brighton), I had another half-dozen Os (including Latin, from scratch), three As, and a second-tier scholarship to Oxford. None of this would have happened without Jane's energy and determination. ...

<p>The house on Hadley Common was a citadel of riotous insolvency &lt;U+2013&gt; not just at Christmas but every weekend. There was a great sense of in-depth back-up, a cellar, a barrel of malt whisky, a walk-in larder: proof against snowstorm or shutdown. I think it was that Christmas morning [1977], that all four Amises, with breakfast trays on their laps, watched <em>Journey to the Centre of the Earth</em> &lt;U+2013&gt; then the visit to the pub, then the day-long, the week-long lunch. And with Kingsley the hub of all humour and high spirits, like an engine of comedy ... I felt so secure in that house &lt;U+2013&gt; and, clearly, so insecure elsewhere &lt;U+2013&gt; that I always experienced a caress of apprehension as I climbed into the car on Sunday night, any Sunday night, and headed back to the motorway and Monday, to the flat or the flatlet, the street, the job, the tramp dread, the outside world.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a></p>

<p>Lemmons was featured in <em><a href="Woman&#39;s_Journal_(British_magazine)" title="wikilink">Woman's Journal</a></em> in June 1976 in an advertisement for wallpaper by <a href="Arthur_Sanderson_&amp;_Sons" title="wikilink">Arthur Sanderson &amp; Sons</a>.<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a> The company decorated a room and took a photograph of Kingsley and Jane sitting in it, published under the headline &quot;Very Sanderson, Very Amis.&quot;<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a></p>
<p>The couple sold Lemmons shortly after this, for &lt;U+00A3&gt;105,000. They moved to a smaller house, Gardnor House, in Flask Walk, <a href="Hampstead" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hampstead</a>, London NW3. Kingsley was apparently tired of living so far from central London.<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a> Jane loved Lemmons, but was exhausted from the effort of running it. Kingsley expected her to do most of the cooking and domestic work, for the family plus assorted guests, as well as drive him around and do the finances and much of the gardening. Women for Kingsley were &quot;for bed and board,&quot; as Jane put it. She ended up on <a href="Tryptizol" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tryptizol</a> and <a href="Valium" class="uri" title="wikilink">Valium</a>.<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a> Sargy Mann said that Lemmons was &quot;wonderful for everyone but Jane.&quot;<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a></p>
<p>Jane left the marriage in 1980 because she realized that Kingsley did not like her; her lawyer gave him a letter the day she was expected back from a health farm.<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a> Neither of them remarried, and they never spoke again.<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a> Martin wrote: &quot;[T]he big house disappeared ... and so did love.&quot;<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a></p>
