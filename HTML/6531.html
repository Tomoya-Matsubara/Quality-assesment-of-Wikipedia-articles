<h2 id="prelude-to-nazi-anti-tobacco-campaign">Prelude to Nazi anti-tobacco campaign</h2>
<p>Anti-tobacco sentiment existed in <a href="German_Empire" title="wikilink">Germany</a> in the early 1900s. Critics of smoking organized the first anti-tobacco group in the country named the <em>Deutscher Tabakgegnerverein zum Schutze der Nichtraucher</em> (German Tobacco Opponents' Association for the Protection of Non-smokers). Established in 1904, this organization existed for a brief period only. The next anti-tobacco organization, the <em>Bund Deutscher Tabakgegner</em> (Federation of German Tobacco Opponents), was established in 1910 in <a href="Trautenau" class="uri" title="wikilink">Trautenau</a>, <a href="Bohemia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bohemia</a>. Other anti-smoking organizations were established in 1912 in the cities of <a href="Hanover" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hanover</a> and <a href="Dresden" class="uri" title="wikilink">Dresden</a>. In 1920, a <em>Bund Deutscher Tabakgegner in der Tschechoslowakei</em> (Federation of German Tobacco Opponents in Czechoslovakia) was formed in <a href="Prague" class="uri" title="wikilink">Prague</a>, after <a href="Czechoslovakia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Czechoslovakia</a> was separated from <a href="Austria" class="uri" title="wikilink">Austria</a> at the end of <a href="World_War_I" title="wikilink">World War I</a>. A <em>Bund Deutscher Tabakgegner in <a href="Deutsch&lt;U+00F6&gt;sterreich" class="uri" title="wikilink">Deutsch&lt;U+00F6&gt;sterreich</a></em> (Federation of German Tobacco Opponents in Austria) was established in <a href="Graz" class="uri" title="wikilink">Graz</a> in 1920.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
<p>These groups published journals advocating nonsmoking. The first such <a href="German_language" title="wikilink">German language</a> journal was <em>Der Tabakgegner</em> (The Tobacco Opponent), published by the Bohemian organization between 1912 and 1932. The <em>Deutsche Tabakgegner</em> (German Tobacco Opponents) was published in Dresden from 1919 to 1935, and was the second journal on this issue.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> The anti-tobacco organizations were also against consumption of <a href="Ethanol#Alcoholic_beverages" title="wikilink">alcohol</a>.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>

<p>Hitler disapproved of the military personnel's freedom to smoke, and during <a href="World_War_II" title="wikilink">World War II</a> he said on March 2, 1942, &quot;it was a mistake, traceable to the army leadership at the time, at the beginning of the war&quot;. He also said that it was &quot;not correct to say that a soldier cannot live without smoking&quot;. He promised to end the use of tobacco in the military after the end of the war. Hitler personally encouraged close friends not to smoke and rewarded those who <a href="Smoking_cessation" title="wikilink">quit smoking</a>. However, Hitler's personal distaste for tobacco was only one of several catalysts behind the anti-smoking campaign.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="reproductive-policies">Reproductive policies</h2>
<p>The Nazi reproductive policies were a significant factor behind their anti-tobacco campaign.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> Women who smoked were considered to be vulnerable to premature <a href="aging" class="uri" title="wikilink">aging</a> and loss of <a href="physical_attractiveness" title="wikilink">physical attractiveness</a>; they were viewed as unsuitable to be wives and mothers in a German family.

This opinion was also supported by well-known female <a href="racial_hygiene" title="wikilink">racial hygienist</a> Agnes Bluhm, whose book published in 1936 expressed the same view. The Nazi leadership was concerned over this because they wanted German women to give birth. An article published in a German <a href="gynaecology" class="uri" title="wikilink">gynaecology</a> journal in 1943 stated that women smoking three or more cigarettes per day were more likely to remain <a href="childless" class="uri" title="wikilink">childless</a> compared to nonsmoking women.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a></p>

M&lt;U+00FC&gt;ller's 1939 medical dissertation was the world's first controlled epidemiological study of the relationship between tobacco and lung cancer. Apart from mentioning the increasing incidents of lung cancer and many of the causes behind it such as dust, exhaust gas from cars, <a href="tuberculosis" class="uri" title="wikilink">tuberculosis</a>, X-ray and pollutants emitted from factories, M&lt;U+00FC&gt;ller's paper pointed out that &quot;the significance of tobacco smoke has been pushed more and more into the foreground&quot;.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a></p>
<p>Physicians in the Third Reich were aware that smoking is responsible for <a href="cardiac_disease" title="wikilink">cardiac diseases</a>, which were considered to be the most serious diseases resulting from smoking. Use of nicotine was sometimes considered to be responsible for increasing reports of <a href="myocardial_infarction" title="wikilink">myocardial infarction</a> in the country.

A pathologist of the <a href="Heer_(1935-1945)" title="wikilink">Heer</a> examined thirty-two young soldiers who had died from myocardial infarction at the front, and documented in a 1944 report that all of them were &quot;enthusiastic smokers&quot;.

<p>The Nazi anti-tobacco policies were not exempt of contradictions. For example, the <em>Volksgesundheit</em> (People's Health) and <em>Gesundheitspflicht</em> (Duty to be Healthy) policies were enforced in parallel with the active distribution of cigarettes to people who the Nazis saw &quot;deserving&quot; groups (e.g. frontline soldiers, members of the Hitler Youth). On the other hand, &quot;undeserving&quot; and stigmatized groups (Jews, war prisoners) were denied access to tobacco.<a href="#fn90" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref90"><sup>90</sup></a></p>

<p>Apart from public health concerns, the Nazis were heavily influenced by ideology;<a href="#fn91" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref91"><sup>91</sup></a> specifically, the movement was influenced by concepts of <a href="racial_hygiene" title="wikilink">racial hygiene</a> and bodily purity.<a href="#fn92" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref92"><sup>92</sup></a> Nazi leaders believed that it was wrong for the <a href="master_race" title="wikilink">master race</a> to smoke<a href="#fn93" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref93"><sup>93</sup></a> and that tobacco consumption was equal to &quot;racial degeneracy&quot;.<a href="#fn94" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref94"><sup>94</sup></a> The Nazis viewed tobacco as a &quot;genetic poison&quot;.<a href="#fn95" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref95"><sup>95</sup></a> Racial hygienists opposed tobacco use, fearing that it would &quot;corrupt&quot; the &quot;German germ plasm&quot;.<a href="#fn96" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref96"><sup>96</sup></a> Nazi anti-tobacco activists often tried to depict tobacco as a &quot;vice&quot; of the &quot;degenerate&quot; <a href="African" title="wikilink">Africans</a>.<a href="#fn97" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref97"><sup>97</sup></a></p>
<p>The Nazis claimed that the <a href="Jew" title="wikilink">Jews</a> were responsible for introducing tobacco and its harmful effects.

<p>After the collapse of Nazi Germany at the <a href="End_of_World_War_II_in_Europe" title="wikilink">end of World War II</a>, <a href=":Category:Tobacco_companies_of_the_United_States" title="wikilink">American cigarette manufactures</a> quickly entered the German market. Illegal <a href="smuggling" class="uri" title="wikilink">smuggling</a> of tobacco became prevalent,<a href="#fn100" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref100"><sup>100</sup></a> and leaders of the Nazi anti-smoking campaign were silenced.<a href="#fn101" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref101"><sup>101</sup></a> In 1949, approximately 400 million cigarettes manufactured in the United States entered Germany illegally every month. In 1954, nearly two billion <a href="Switzerland" title="wikilink">Swiss</a> cigarettes were smuggled into Germany and <a href="Italy" class="uri" title="wikilink">Italy</a>. As part of the <a href="Marshall_Plan" title="wikilink">Marshall Plan</a>, the United States sent free tobacco to Germany; the amount of tobacco shipped into Germany in 1948 was 24,000 tons and was as high as 69,000 tons in 1949.

At the end of the 20th century, the anti-tobacco campaign in Germany has been unable to exceed the seriousness of the Nazi-era climax in the years 1939&lt;U+2013&gt;41 and German tobacco health research is described by <a href="Robert_N._Proctor" title="wikilink">Robert N.
