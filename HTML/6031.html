<p>The 145th <a href="The_Boat_Race" title="wikilink">Boat Race</a> took place on 3 April 1999. Held annually, the Boat Race is a <a href="Rowing_(sport)#Side_by_side" title="wikilink">side-by-side rowing</a> race between crews from the Universities of <a href="University_of_Oxford" title="wikilink">Oxford</a> and <a href="University_of_Cambridge" title="wikilink">Cambridge</a> along the <a href="River_Thames" title="wikilink">River Thames</a>. Featuring the tallest rower in Boat Race history, Cambridge won the race in the second-fastest time ever. It was their seventh consecutive victory in the event.</p>
<p>In the reserve race, Cambridge's <a href="Goldie_(Cambridge_University_Boat_Club)" title="wikilink">Goldie</a> defeated Oxford's Isis in the fastest time ever, while Cambridge won the <a href="Women&#39;s_Boat_Race" title="wikilink">Women's Boat Race</a>.</p>

<p><a href="The_Boat_Race" title="wikilink">The Boat Race</a> is a <a href="Rowing_(sport)#Side_by_side" title="wikilink">side-by-side rowing</a> competition between the <a href="University_of_Oxford" title="wikilink">University of Oxford</a> (sometimes referred to as the &quot;Dark Blues&quot;)<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> and the <a href="University_of_Cambridge" title="wikilink">University of Cambridge</a> (sometimes referred to as the &quot;Light Blues&quot;).<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> First held in 1829, the race takes place on the  <a href="The_Championship_Course" title="wikilink">Championship Course</a> on the <a href="River_Thames" title="wikilink">River Thames</a> in southwest London.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> The rivalry is a major point of honour between the two universities and followed throughout the United Kingdom and broadcast worldwide.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a><a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> Cambridge went into the race as reigning champions, having won the <a href="The_Boat_Race_1998" title="wikilink">1998 race</a> by three lengths,<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> with Cambridge leading overall with 75 victories to Oxford's 68 (excluding the &quot;dead heat&quot; of 1877).<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p>The first Women's Boat Race took place in 1927, but did not become an annual fixture until the 1960s. The race is conducted as part of the <a href="Henley_Boat_Races" title="wikilink">Henley Boat Races</a>, but in 2015 is slated to be held on the River Thames.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> The reserve race, contested between Oxford's Isis boat and Cambridge's Goldie boat has been held since 1965. It usually takes place on the Tideway, prior to the main Boat Race.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<p><a href="Andrew_Lindsay" title="wikilink">Andrew Lindsay</a> was confident that the Oxford crew would be more motivated than their opponents: &quot;our advantage over Cambridge is that we are hungry for the victory. Everyone in the Oxford boat is driven to go and win this damn thing&quot;.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> He was making his third and final appearance in the race having lost in both the <a href="The_Boat_Race_1997" title="wikilink">1997</a> and <a href="The_Boat_Race_1998" title="wikilink">1998 race</a>. His grandfather represented Cambridge in the 1930s, and his uncle, Alexander Lindsay, rowed for the losing Oxford crew in <a href="The_Boat_Race_1959" title="wikilink">the 1959 race</a> before triumphing <a href="The_Boat_Race_1960" title="wikilink">the following year</a>.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> Cambridge boat club president and Canadian international rower Brad Crombie was also making his third Boat Race appearance, attempting to complete a hat-trick of victories.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> Sean Bowden was the head coach of Oxford. His Cambridge counterpart, <a href="Robin_Williams_(rowing_coach)" title="wikilink">Robin Williams</a>, suggested &quot;it still feels like all or nothing to us. The fear of defeat, the aim of trying to push the limits is motivation itself&quot;.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> Just as he had done in the <a href="The_Boat_Race_1993" title="wikilink">1993 race</a>, umpire Mark Evans introduced modifications to the starting procedure, suggesting that he would be content to hold the crews for up to ten seconds between issuing the &quot;set&quot; and &quot;go&quot; commands.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> Cambridge's Williams remarked: &quot;I'm happy as long as both crews abide by it&quot;, Bowden was nonplussed &quot;Go is when you start races. I'm happy.&quot;<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
<p>The race was sponsored for the first time by <a href="Aberdeen_Asset_Management" title="wikilink">Aberdeen Asset Management</a>,<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> and both crews were competing for the Aberdeen Asset Trophy. It was the fiftieth anniversary of the BBC's coverage of the event and over the preceding five years had secured an average audience in excess of six million.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>

Despite being warned by umpire Davis, Cambridge were soon half-a-length ahead, and a second clear by the Mile Post.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> The lead was extended to a length by <a href="Hammersmith_Bridge" title="wikilink">Hammersmith Bridge</a> and Sharif had steered her boat into a better angle of attack.

They passed the finishing post three-and-a-half lengths ahead, with an eleven-second advantage over the Dark Blues.

<p>Oxford's Bowden was dumbstruck: &quot;I'm really floored.
