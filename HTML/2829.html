<p>Saint <strong>Gregory of Nazianzus</strong> (<a href="329" class="uri" title="wikilink">329</a> - <a href="January_25" title="wikilink">January 25</a>, <a href="389" class="uri" title="wikilink">389</a>), also known as Saint <strong>Gregory the Theologian</strong> or <strong>Gregory Nazianzen</strong>, was a <a href="4th_century" title="wikilink">4th century</a> <a href="Christianity" title="wikilink">Christian</a> <a href="bishop" class="uri" title="wikilink">bishop</a> of <a href="List_of_Constantinople_patriarchs" title="wikilink">Constantinople</a> . Gregory is widely considered the most accomplished rhetorical stylist of the <a href="Church_Fathers" title="wikilink">patristic age</a>.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> As a classically trained speaker and philosopher he infused Hellenism into the early church, establishing the paradigm of Byzantine theologians and church officials.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>Gregory made a significant impact on the shape of Trinitarian theology among both Greek-speaking and Latin-speaking theologians, and he is remembered as the &quot;Trinitarian Theologian.&quot; Much of his theological work continues to influence modern theologians, especially in regard to the relationship among the three <a href="hypostasis" title="wikilink">persons</a> of the <a href="Trinity" class="uri" title="wikilink">Trinity</a>. Along with two brothers, <a href="Basil_the_Great" title="wikilink">Basil the Great</a> and <a href="Gregory_of_Nyssa" title="wikilink">Gregory of Nyssa</a>, he is known as one of the <a href="Cappadocian_Fathers" title="wikilink">Cappadocian Fathers</a>.</p>
<p>Gregory is honored as a <a href="saint" class="uri" title="wikilink">saint</a> in both <a href="Eastern_Christianity" title="wikilink">Eastern</a> and <a href="Western_Christianity" title="wikilink">Western Christianity</a>. In the <a href="Catholicism" title="wikilink">Roman Catholic Church</a> he is among the <a href="Doctor_of_the_Church" title="wikilink">Doctors of the Church</a>; in <a href="Eastern_Orthodoxy" title="wikilink">Eastern Orthodoxy</a> and the <a href="Eastern_Catholic_Churches" title="wikilink">Eastern Catholic Churches</a> he is revered as one of the <a href="Three_Holy_Hierarchs" title="wikilink">Three Holy Hierarchs</a> along with <a href="Basil_of_Caesarea" title="wikilink">Basil of Caesarea</a> and <a href="John_Chrysostom" title="wikilink">John Chrysostom</a>.</p>
<h2 id="biography">Biography</h2>
<h3 id="early-life-and-education">Early life and education</h3>
<p>Gregory was born in Arianzus, near <a href="Nazianzus" class="uri" title="wikilink">Nazianzus</a>, in southwest <a href="Cappadocia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Cappadocia</a>. <a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> His parents, <a href="Gregory_of_Nazianzus_the_Elder" title="wikilink">Gregory</a> and <a href="Nonna_of_Nazianzus" title="wikilink">Nonna</a>, were wealthy land-owners. In 325 Nonna converted her husband to Christianity; he was subsequently consecrated bishop of Nazianzus in 328 or 329.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> The young Gregory and his brother, <a href="Caesarius_of_Nazianzus" title="wikilink">Caesarius</a>, first studied at home with their uncle Amphylokhios. Gregory went on to study advanced rhetoric and philosophy in Nazianzus, <a href="Caesarea_Mazaca" title="wikilink">Caesarea</a>, <a href="Alexandria" class="uri" title="wikilink">Alexandria</a> and <a href="Athens" class="uri" title="wikilink">Athens</a>. While at Athens, he developed a close friendship with fellow student Saint <a href="Basil_of_Caesarea" title="wikilink">Basil of Caesarea</a> and also made the acquaintance of Julian, the later emperor who would become known as <a href="Julian_the_Apostate" title="wikilink">Julian the Apostate</a>.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> In Athens Gregory studied under the famous rhetoricians <a href="Himerius" class="uri" title="wikilink">Himerius</a> and <a href="Proaeresius" class="uri" title="wikilink">Proaeresius</a>.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> Upon finishing his education, he also taught rhetoric in Athens for a short time.</p>
<h3 id="priesthood">Priesthood</h3>
<p>In <a href="361" class="uri" title="wikilink">361</a>, Gregory returned to Nazianzus and was ordained a <a href="presbyter" class="uri" title="wikilink">presbyter</a> by his father, who wanted him to assist with caring for local Christians.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> The younger Gregory, who had been considering a monastic existence, resented his father's decision to force him to choose between priestly services and a solitary existence, calling it an &quot;act of tyranny&quot;.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> Leaving home after a few days, he met his friend Basil at Annesoi, where the two lived as ascetics.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> However, Basil urged him to return home to assist his father, which he did for the next year. Arriving at Nazianzus, Gregory found the local Christian community split by theological differences and his father accused of heresy by local monks.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> Gregory helped to heal the division through a combination of personal diplomacy and oratory.</p>
<p>By this time Emperor Julian had publicly come out in opposition to Christianity.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> In response to the emperor's rejection of the Christian faith, Gregory composed his <em>Invectives Against Julian</em> between 362 and 363. Disparaging the emperor's morals and intellect, the <em>Invectives</em> assert that Christianity will overcome imperfect rulers such as Julian through love and patience. This process as described by Gregory is the public manifestation of the process of deification (<em><a href="theosis" class="uri" title="wikilink">theosis</a></em>), which leads to a spiritual elevation and mystical union with God.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> Julian resolved in late 362 to vigorously prosecute Gregory and his other Christian critics; however, the emperor perished the following year during a campaign against the Persians.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> With the death of the emperor, Gregory and the Eastern churches were no longer under the threat of persecution, as the new emperor <a href="Jovian" class="uri" title="wikilink">Jovian</a> was an avowed Christian and supporter of the church.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<p>Gregory spent the next few years combating the <a href="Arianism" title="wikilink">Arian heresy</a>, which threatened to divide the region of Cappadocia. In this tense environment Gregory interceded on behalf of his friend Basil with Bishop <a href="Eusebius_of_Caesarea" title="wikilink">Eusebius of Caesarea</a> (<a href="Caesarea_Maritima" title="wikilink">Maritima</a>).<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> The two friends then entered a period of close fraternal cooperation as they participated in a great rhetorical contest of the Caesarean church precipitated by the arrival of accomplished Arian theologians and rhetors.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> In the subsequent public debates, presided over by agents of the emperor <a href="Valens" class="uri" title="wikilink">Valens</a>, Gregory and Basil emerged triumphant. This success confirmed for both Gregory and Basil that their futures lay in administration of the church.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> Basil, who had long displayed inclinations to the episcopacy, was elected bishop of the see of <a href="Caesarea_Mazaca" title="wikilink">Caesarea in Cappadocia</a> in 370.</p>
<h3 id="episcopate-in-sasima-and-nazianzus">Episcopate in Sasima and Nazianzus</h3>
<p>Gregory was consecrated Bishop of <a href="Sasima" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sasima</a> in 372 by Basil.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> This was a see newly created by Basil in order to strengthen his position in his dispute with <a href="Anthimus" class="uri" title="wikilink">Anthimus</a>, bishop of Tyana.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> The ambitions of Gregory's father to have his son rise in the church hierarchy and the insistence of his friend Basil convinced Gregory to accept this position despite his reservations. Gregory would later refer to his episcopal ordination as forced upon him by his strong-willed father and Basil.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> Describing his new bishopric, Gregory lamented how it was nothing more than an &quot;utterly dreadful, pokey little hole; a paltry horse-stop on the main road...devoid of water, vegetation, or the company of gentlemen...this was my Church of Sasima!&quot;<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> He made little effort to administer his new diocese, complaining to Basil he preferred instead to pursue a contemplative life.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a></p>
<p>By late 372 Gregory returned to Nazianzus to assist his dying father with the administration of his diocese.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> This strained his relationship with Basil, who insisted that Gregory assume his post at Sasima. Gregory retorted that he had no intention to continue to play the role of pawn to advance Basil's interests.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> He instead focused his attention on his new duties as <a href="co-adjutor" class="uri" title="wikilink">co-adjutor</a> of Nazianzus. It was here that Gregory preached the first of his great episcopal orations.</p>
<p>Following the deaths of his mother and father in 374, Gregory continued to administer the diocese of Nazianzus but refused to be named bishop. Donating most of his inheritance to the needy, he lived an austere existence.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> At the end of 375 he withdrew to a monastery at <a href="Silifke" title="wikilink">Seleukia</a>, living there for three years. Near the end of this period his friend Basil died. Although Gregory's health did not permit him to attend the funeral, he wrote a heartfelt letter of condolence to Basil's brother, <a href="Gregory_of_Nyssa" title="wikilink">Gregory of Nyssa</a> and composed twelve memorial poems dedicated to the memory of his departed friend.</p>
<h3 id="gregory-at-constantinople">Gregory at Constantinople</h3>
<p>Emperor Valens died in 378. The succession of <a href="Theodosius_I" title="wikilink">Theodosius I</a>, a steadfast supporter of Nicene orthodoxy, was good news to those who wished to purge Constantinople of <a href="Arian" class="uri" title="wikilink">Arian</a> and <a href="Apollinarism" title="wikilink">Apollinarian</a> domination.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> The exiled Nicene party gradually returned to the city. From his deathbed, Basil reminded them of Gregory's capabilities and likely recommended his friend to champion the trinitarian cause in Constantinople.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a></p>
<p>In <a href="379" class="uri" title="wikilink">379</a>, the Antioch synod and its archbishop, Meletios, asked Gregory to go to Constantinople to lead a theological campaign to win over that city to Nicene orthodoxy.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> After much hesitation, Gregory agreed. His cousin Theodosia offered him a villa for his residence; Gregory immediately transformed much of it into a church, naming it Anastasia, &quot;a scene for the resurrection of the faith.&quot;<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> From this little chapel he delivered five powerful discourses on Nicene doctrine, explaining the nature of the Trinity and the unity of the Godhead. <a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> Refuting the Eunomion denial of the Holy Spirit's divinity, Gregory offered this argument:</p>

<p>Gregory's homilies were well-received and attracted ever-growing crowds to Anastasia. Fearing his popularity, his opponents decided to strike. On the vigil of Easter in 379, an Arian mob burst into his church during worship services, wounding Gregory and killing another bishop. Escaping the mob, Gregory next found himself betrayed by his erstwhile friend, the philosopher <a href="Maximus_I_of_Constantinople" title="wikilink">Maximus the Cynic</a>. Maximus, who was in secret alliance with Peter, bishop of Alexandria, attempted to seize Gregory's power and have himself concentrated bishop of Constantinople.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> Shocked, Gregory decided to resign his office, but the faction faithful to him induced him to stay and ejected Maximus. However, the episode left him embarrassed and exposed him to criticism as a provincial simpleton unable to cope with intrigues of the imperial city.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a></p>
<p>Affairs in Constantinople remained confused as Gregory's position was still unofficial and Arian priests occupied many important churches. The arrival of the emperor <a href="Theodosius" class="uri" title="wikilink">Theodosius</a> in 380 settled matters in Gregory's favor. The emperor, determined to eliminate Arianism, expelled <a href="Demophilus_of_Constantinople" title="wikilink">Bishop Demophilus</a>. Gregory was subsequently enthroned as bishop of Constantinople at the Basilica of the Apostles, replacing Demophilus.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="second-ecumenical-council-and-retirement-to-arianzum">Second Ecumenical Council and retirement to Arianzum</h3>
<p>Theodosius wanted to further unify the entire empire behind the orthodox position and decided to convene a church council to resolve matters of faith and discipline.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> Gregory was of similar mind, wishing to unify Christianity. In the spring of 381 they convened the <a href="Second_Ecumenical_Council" title="wikilink">Second Ecumenical Council</a> in Constantinople, which was attended by 150 Eastern bishops. After the death of the presiding bishop, <a href="Meletius_of_Antioch" title="wikilink">Meletius of Antioch</a>, Gregory was selected to lead the Council. Hoping to reconcile the West with the East, he offered to recognize <a href="Paulinus" class="uri" title="wikilink">Paulinus</a> as Patriarch of Antioch. The Egyptian and Macedonian bishops who had supported Maximus's consecration, arrived late for the Council. Once there, they refused to recognise Gregory's position as head of the church of Constantinople, arguing that his transfer from the See of Sasima was canonically illegitimate.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a></p>
<p>Gregory was physically exhausted and worried that he was losing the confidence of the bishops and the emperor.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> Rather than press his case and risk further division, he decided to resign his office: &quot;Let me be as the Prophet Jonah! I was responsible for the storm, but I would sacrifice myself for the salvation of the ship. Seize me and throw me... I was not happy when I ascended the throne, and gladly would I descend it.&quot;<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> He stunned the Council with his surprise resignation and then delivered a dramatic speech to Theodosius asking to be released from his offices. The emperor, moved by his words, applauded, commended his labor and granted his resignation. The Council asked him to appear once more for a farewell ritual and celebratory orations. Gregory used this occasion to deliver a final address (Or. 42) and then departed.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a></p>
<p>Returning to his homeland of Cappadocia, Gregory once again resumed his position as bishop of Nazianzus. He spent the next year combatting the local Appolinarian heretics and struggling with periodic illness. He also began composing <em>De Vita Sua</em>, his autobiographical poem. <a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> By then end of 383 he found his health too feeble to cope with episcopal duties. Gregory established Eulalius as bishop of Nazianzus and then withdrew into the solitude of Arianzum. After enjoying five peaceful years in retirement at his family estate, he died January 25, 389.</p>
<p>Throughout his life Gregory faced stark choices. Should he pursue studies as a rhetor or philosopher? Would a monastic life be more appropriate than public ministry? Was it better to blaze his own path or follow the course mapped for him by his father and Basil? Gregory's writings illuminate the conflicts which both tormented and motivated him. Biographers suggest that it was this dialectic which defined him, forged his character and inspired his search for meaning and truth.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a></p>

<h3 id="theology-and-other-works">Theology and other works</h3>
<p>Gregory's most significant theological contributions arose from his defense of the Nicene doctrine of the <a href="Trinity" class="uri" title="wikilink">Trinity</a>. He is especially noted for his contributions to the field of <a href="pneumatology" class="uri" title="wikilink">pneumatology</a>&lt;U+2014&gt;that is, theology concerning the nature of the <a href="Holy_Spirit" title="wikilink">Holy Spirit</a>.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> In this regard, Gregory is the first to use the idea of <em>procession</em> to describe the relationship between the Spirit and the Godhead: &quot;The Holy Spirit is truly Spirit, coming forth from the Father indeed but not after the manner of the Son, for it is not by generation but by <em>procession</em>, since I must coin a word for the sake of clearness.&quot;<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> Although Gregory does not fully develop the concept, the idea of procession would shape most later thought about the Holy Spirit.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a></p>
<p>He emphasized that Jesus did not cease to be God when he became a man, nor did he lose any of his divine attributes when he took on human nature. Furthermore, Gregory asserted that Christ was fully human, including a full human soul. He also proclaimed the eternality of the Holy Spirit, saying that the Holy Spirit's actions were somewhat hidden in the <a href="Old_Testament" title="wikilink">Old Testament</a> but much clearer since the ascension of Jesus into Heaven and the descent of the Holy Spirit at the feast of Pentecost.</p>
<p>In contrast to the Neo-Arian belief that the Son is <em>anomoios</em>, or &quot;unlike&quot; the Father, and with the <a href="Semi-Arian" class="uri" title="wikilink">Semi-Arian</a> assertion that the Son is <em><a href="homoiousios" class="uri" title="wikilink">homoiousios</a></em>, or &quot;like&quot; the Father, Gregory and his fellow Cappadocians maintained the Nicaean doctrine of <em><a href="Homoousian" title="wikilink">homoousia</a></em>, or <a href="consubstantiality" class="uri" title="wikilink">consubstantiality</a> of the Son with the Father.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> The Cappadocian Fathers asserted that God's nature is unknowable to man; helped to develop the framework of <em><a href="hypostases" class="uri" title="wikilink">hypostases</a></em>, or three persons united in a single Godhead; illustrated how Jesus is the eikon of the Father; and explained the concept of <em><a href="theosis" class="uri" title="wikilink">theosis</a></em>, the belief that all Christians can be assimiliated with God in &quot;imitation of the incarnate Son as the divine model.&quot;<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a></p>
<p>Apart from the several theological discourses, Gregory is also one of the most important early Christian men of letters, a very accomplished orator, perhaps one of the greatest of his time,<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> and also a very prolific poet, having written several poems with theological and moral matter and some with biographical content, about himself and about his friends.</p>
<h3 id="influence">Influence</h3>
<p>Gregory's great nephew Nichobulos served as his literary executor, preserving and editing many of his writings. A cousin, Eulalios, published several of Gregory's more noteworthy works in 391.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a> By 400 Rufinius began translating his orations into Latin. As Gregory's works circulated throughout the empire they influenced theological thought. His orations were cited as authoritative by the <a href="Council_of_Ephesus" title="wikilink">Council of Ephesus</a> in <a href="431" class="uri" title="wikilink">431</a>, and by <a href="451" class="uri" title="wikilink">451</a> he was designated <em>Theologus</em>, or Theologian by the <a href="Council_of_Chalcedon" title="wikilink">Council of Chalcedon</a><a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a>- a title held by no others save <a href="John_the_Apostle" title="wikilink">John the Apostle</a>. <a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a> He is widely quoted by Eastern Orthodox theologians and highly regarded as a defender of the Christian faith.<img src="Relics-return.jpg" title="fig:Pope John Paul II and Patriarch Bartholomew of Constantinople preside at the ceremony in St. Peter&#39;s Basilica returning the relics of St. Gregory to the Orthodox Church, November 27, 2004." alt="Pope John Paul II and Patriarch Bartholomew of Constantinople preside at the ceremony in St. Peter&#39;s Basilica returning the relics of St. Gregory to the Orthodox Church, November 27, 2004." /> His contributions to <a href="Trinitarian_theology" title="wikilink">Trinitarian theology</a> are also influential and often cited in the Western churches.<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a> <a href="Paul_Tillich" title="wikilink">Paul Tillich</a> credits Greogory of Nazianzus for having &quot;created the definitive formulae for the doctrine of the trinity&quot;.<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="relics">Relics</h3>
<p>Following his death, Saint Gregory's body was buried at Nazianzus. His relics were transferred to <a href="Constantinople" class="uri" title="wikilink">Constantinople</a> in 950, into the church of the Holy Apostles. Part of the relics were taken from Constantinople by <a href="Crusade" title="wikilink">Crusaders</a> during the <a href="Fourth_Crusade" title="wikilink">Fourth Crusade</a> in <a href="1204" class="uri" title="wikilink">1204</a> and ended up in <a href="Rome" class="uri" title="wikilink">Rome</a>. On <a href="November_27" title="wikilink">November 27</a>, <a href="2004" class="uri" title="wikilink">2004</a>, those relics, along with those of <a href="John_Chrysostom" title="wikilink">John Chrysostom</a>, were returned to <a href="Istanbul" class="uri" title="wikilink">Istanbul</a> by <a href="Pope_John_Paul_II" title="wikilink">Pope John Paul II</a>, with the <a href="Vatican_City" title="wikilink">Vatican</a> retaining a small portion of both. The relics are now enshrined in the <a href="Orthodox_Church_of_Constantinople" title="wikilink">Patriarchal</a> Cathedral of St. George in the <a href="Fanar" class="uri" title="wikilink">Fanar</a>.<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a></p>
