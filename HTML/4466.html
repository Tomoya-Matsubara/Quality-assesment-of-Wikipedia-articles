<p><strong>The Manchester Rambler</strong>, also known as <strong>I'm a Rambler</strong> and <strong>The Rambler's song</strong>, is a song written by the English folk singer <a href="Ewan_MacColl" title="wikilink">Ewan MacColl</a>. It was inspired by his participation in the <a href="Kinder_trespass" title="wikilink">Kinder trespass</a>, a protest by the urban <a href="Young_Communist_League" title="wikilink">Young Communist League</a> of <a href="Manchester" class="uri" title="wikilink">Manchester</a>, and was the work that began MacColl's career as a singer/songwriter.</p>
<h2 id="context">Context</h2>
<p>The <a href="Kinder_mass_trespass" title="wikilink">Kinder mass trespass</a> was a deliberate act of <a href="trespass" class="uri" title="wikilink">trespass</a> by men of the <a href="Young_Communist_League" title="wikilink">Young Communist League</a> of <a href="Manchester" class="uri" title="wikilink">Manchester</a>. The '<a href="walking#As_a_leisure_activity" title="wikilink">ramblers</a>', led by <a href="Benny_Goodman" title="wikilink">Benny Goodman</a>, walked from Bowden Bridge Quarry, near <a href="Hayfield" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hayfield</a> to climb the hill called <a href="Kinder_Scout" title="wikilink">Kinder Scout</a> in the <a href="Derbyshire" class="uri" title="wikilink">Derbyshire</a> <a href="Peak_District" title="wikilink">Peak District</a> on 24 April 1932. MacColl was a keen rambler and an enthusiastic member of the Young Communist League. He played a major part in organising the publicity for the trespass, duplicating and handing out leaflets, though this role is disputed.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> He took part in the trespass, and was shocked by the violent reaction of the <a href="gamekeeper" title="wikilink">gamekeepers</a> who met the ramblers on the hill, and the extremely harsh sentences handed down by the magistrates to the five ramblers who were arrested that day.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a><a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p><img src="North_Flank_Kinder_Scout.JPG" title="fig:Kinder Scout was part of a private estate in 1932." alt="Kinder Scout was part of a private estate in 1932." /> In his biographer Ben Harker's view, &quot;it would be difficult to overstate the extent to which MacColl was shaped by the 1930s&quot;.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> MacColl was a keen rambler, travelling out of Manchester by bus into the Peak District, like thousands of other young unemployed people with time on their hands. For MacColl, rambling was integral to his politics; he did not simply find nature beautiful and the urban world ugly: instead, it was an objective of the hoped-for revolution<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>

<p>Groups of ramblers often sang songs such as &quot;I'm Happy When I'm Hiking&quot;, as well as bawdy songs, ballads and radical protest songs from America at their camps. MacColl published the &quot;Manchester Youth Song&quot; in 1933, singing of &quot;Workers in Cheetham, who slave every day / In waterproof factories at starvation pay&quot;.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> He also wrote the song &quot;Mass Trespass 1932&quot;, setting words like &quot;For the mass trespass is the only way there is / To gain access to the mountains once again&quot; to the old Scottish tune of &quot;<a href="The_Road_to_the_Isles" title="wikilink">The Road to the Isles</a>&quot;. His friends used to sing it as they rambled in the hills.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="folk-song">Folk song</h2>
<p>The Manchester Rambler, written in 1932 not long after the Kinder trespass, was <a href="Ewan_MacColl" title="wikilink">Ewan MacColl</a>'s first important song, according to Harker,<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> who argues that it &quot;marks a departure from the [singer's] leaden-footed and slogan-heavy juvenilia.&quot;<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> It is also the first song that still survives for which he wrote the tune. Its swinging, jaunty melody demonstrates MacColl's ability to combine musical forms and popular rhythms to create a song which is at once familiar and unique. Like the tune, the lyrics are witty and playful. They put out a defiant political message with &quot;I may be a wage slave on Monday / But I am a free man on Sunday&quot;; play with and update traditional English folksong phraseology with &quot;I once loved a maid, a spot-welder by trade / She was fair as the Rowan in bloom&quot;; and is suitably comical in the style of musical theatre, argues Harker, on the confrontation between the ramblers and the gamekeepers with lines such as &quot;He called me a louse and said 'Think of the grouse'&quot;.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a><a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> The song has 5 verses, each of 8 lines, and a 4-line chorus.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<p>The song names the following places: <a href="Mount_Snowdon" title="wikilink">Snowdon</a> (North Wales); <a href="Crowdon" class="uri" title="wikilink">Crowdon</a> (<a href="North_Yorkshire" title="wikilink">North Yorkshire</a>); the Wainstones (<a href="Hasty_Bank" title="wikilink">Hasty Bank</a>, <a href="North_York_Moors" title="wikilink">North York Moors</a>); Kinder Scout; Manchester; Grindsbrook and Upper Tor (both <a href="Edale" class="uri" title="wikilink">Edale</a>, Derbyshire).<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<p>The Manchester Rambler is published by Green Linnet on Ewan MacColl's 1996 CD &quot;Black and White: The Definitive Collection&quot;, also released by Cooking Vinyl Records; the recording lasts 4 minutes 42 seconds.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="reception">Reception</h2>
<p>Ben Harker said of The Manchester Rambler that</p>

<p>MacColl performed the song as a standard all his life.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> Cover versions were performed and recorded by dozens of folk musicians from the 1950s onwards,<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> including for example &quot;<a href="Alive_Alive-O" title="wikilink">Alive Alive-O</a>&quot;<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> and <em><a href="30_Years_A-Greying" title="wikilink">30 Years A-Greying</a></em><a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> by <a href="The_Dubliners" title="wikilink">The Dubliners</a>. <a href="Kirsty_MacColl" title="wikilink">Kirsty MacColl</a> (daughter of Ewan) covered the song on her 1991 album <em>The One And Only</em>.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> <a href="The_Houghton_Weavers" title="wikilink">The Houghton Weavers</a> covered it on their 2005 album &quot;Sit Thi Deawn&quot;.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> Mick Groves performed it on his 2005 album &quot;Fellow Journeyman&quot;.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a></p>
<p>The <em><a href="Oxford_Dictionary_of_National_Biography" title="wikilink">Oxford Dictionary of National Biography</a></em> writes of MacColl that &quot;One of his first and finest protest songs, &lt;U+2018&gt;The Manchester Rambler&lt;U+2019&gt;, dealt with the &lt;U+2018&gt;mass trespass&lt;U+2019&gt; campaigns of the 1930s, in which hikers fought pitched battles with gamekeepers when they invaded privately owned grouse moors.&quot;<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a></p>
<p>The <em>Encyclopaedia of Contemporary British Culture</em> describes Ewan MacColl as &quot;a crucial figure&quot; in the folk revival of the 1950s and 1960s, and names The Manchester Rambler as one of his &quot;more famous songs&quot;.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a></p>
<p>The song was sung at Kinder Downfall (the waterfall on Kinder Scout) in 2009 when Kinder was designated as a <a href="National_Nature_Reserve" title="wikilink">National Nature Reserve</a> (NNR); in attendance were establishment figures including three <a href="Members_of_Parliament" title="wikilink">Members of Parliament</a>, the <a href="Chief_Executive_Officer" title="wikilink">Chief Executive Officers</a> of three <a href="National_Park" title="wikilink">National Parks</a> and the leaders of <a href="Natural_England" title="wikilink">Natural England</a>.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> The <a href="British_Mountaineering_Council" title="wikilink">British Mountaineering Council</a>'s booklet issued in 2012 to commemorate 80 years of the Kinder mass trespass reproduced the lyrics of The Manchester Rambler in full.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a></p>
