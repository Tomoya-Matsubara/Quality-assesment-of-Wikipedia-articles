<p><strong>No. 330 Squadron RNoAF</strong> () is a <a href="military_helicopter" title="wikilink">helicopter</a> unit of the <a href="Royal_Norwegian_Air_Force" title="wikilink">Royal Norwegian Air Force</a> (RNoAF). The squadron operates ten <a href="Westland_Sea_King" title="wikilink">Westland Sea King</a> based at six <a href="military_airbase" title="wikilink">airbases</a> along the coast. Headquartered at <a href="Sola_Air_Station" title="wikilink">Sola Air Station</a>, the <a href="squadron" class="uri" title="wikilink">squadron</a> has <a href="detachment_(military)" title="wikilink">detachments</a> at <a href="Rygge_Air_Station" title="wikilink">Rygge</a>, <a href="Flor&lt;U+00F8&gt;_Airport" title="wikilink">Flor&lt;U+00F8&gt;</a>, <a href="&lt;U+00D8&gt;rland_Main_Air_Station" title="wikilink">&lt;U+00D8&gt;rland</a>, <a href="Bod&lt;U+00F8&gt;_Main_Air_Station" title="wikilink">Bod&lt;U+00F8&gt;</a> and <a href="Station_Group_Banak" title="wikilink">Banak</a>. The units primary duty is <a href="search_and_rescue" title="wikilink">search and rescue</a> (SAR), with secondary duties consisting of <a href="air_ambulance" title="wikilink">air ambulance</a>, <a href="disaster_relief" title="wikilink">disaster relief</a> and <a href="special_operations" title="wikilink">special operations</a> support.</p>
<p>The squadron has its roots in the <a href="No._330_Squadron_RAF" title="wikilink">No. 330 Squadron RAF</a>, which conducted <a href="maritime_surveillance" title="wikilink">maritime surveillance</a>, <a href="Arctic_convoys_of_World_War_II" title="wikilink">Arctic convoy</a> escort and <a href="anti-submarine_warfare" title="wikilink">anti-submarine warfare</a> during the <a href="Second_World_War" title="wikilink">Second World War</a>. It was established on Iceland on 25 April 1941, where it operated <a href="Northrop_N-3PB" title="wikilink">Northrop N-3PB</a> and <a href="Consolidated_PBY_Catalina" title="wikilink">Consolidated PBY Catalina</a> seaplanes. It relocated to <a href="RAF_Oban" title="wikilink">RAF Oban</a> in Scotland on 23 January 1943 and started using <a href="Short_Sunderland" title="wikilink">Short Sunderland</a> <a href="flying_boat" title="wikilink">flying boats</a> in the same role. It relocated to Sola in June 1945, where it operated mostly as an <a href="airline" class="uri" title="wikilink">airline</a> until December, when it was deactivated.</p>
<p>The unit was reactivated between 20 July 1953 and 5 July 1958 to operate the <a href="Republic_F-84G_Thunderjet" title="wikilink">Republic F-84G Thunderjet</a> fighters, first based at <a href="Gardermoen_Air_Station" title="wikilink">Gardermoen Air Station</a> and from 1956 at Rygge. It was again reactivated from 1 March 1962 to 1 October 1968 to operate maritime surveillance and anti-submarine operations out of Sola, using the <a href="Grumman_HU-16_Albatross" title="wikilink">Grumman HU-16 Albatross</a>. Its current role became operational in 1973, using ten, later twelve Sea Kings. These are due to be replaced with the <a href="AgustaWestland_AW101" title="wikilink">AgustaWestland AW101</a> around 2020.</p>

<p>The 330 Squadron is part of the 137th Air Wing of the Royal Norwegian Air Force. It is based at Sola Air Station, with detachments in Flor&lt;U+00F8&gt;, &lt;U+00D8&gt;rland, Bod&lt;U+00F8&gt; and Banak. The unit's primary role is within search and rescue. The squadron is funded through a cooperation between the <a href="Ministry_of_Defence_(Norway)" title="wikilink">Ministry of Defense</a>, the <a href="Ministry_of_Justice_and_Public_Security" title="wikilink">Ministry of Justice and Public Security</a> and the <a href="Ministry_of_Health_and_Social_Affairs" title="wikilink">Ministry of Health and Social Affairs</a>. Operationally the squadron is under the command of the <a href="Joint_Rescue_Coordination_Centre_of_Southern_Norway" title="wikilink">Joint Rescue Coordination Centre of Southern Norway</a> (JRCC SN) and the <a href="Joint_Rescue_Coordination_Centre_of_Northern_Norway" title="wikilink">Joint Rescue Coordination Centre of Northern Norway</a> (JRCC NN), respectively.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> Norway has signed agreements with Denmark, Sweden, Finland, Iceland, the United Kingdom and Russia which under given circumstances may result in the 330 Squadron operating within these countries' territories.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>The squadron operates twelve Westland Sea King helicopters. Two are located on each bases at any given time,<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> except for Flor&lt;U+00F8&gt; which only has one helicopter.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> Up to two helicopters are on long-term maintenance at any time. At all bases at least one of the helicopters is on stand-by at any time.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>The helicopters are manned with two pilots, a systems operator, a navigator, a technician/lift operator, a <a href="rescue_swimmer" title="wikilink">rescue swimmer</a> and an <a href="anesthesiologist" class="uri" title="wikilink">anesthesiologist</a>. Five of these are military personnel, while the anesthesiologista work for the local <a href="health_trust" title="wikilink">health trust</a> and are funded through them.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p><img src="330_skvadron_20120901-1.JPG" title="fig:A demonstration of a rescue" alt="A demonstration of a rescue" /> The Sea Kings fly a combined 4,500 hours per year. Half of these are used for missions, the remainder for training.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> Because the unit operates under military rules, it has a stricter training regime than civilian operators. It can also operate under more severe weather conditions.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> The bases have <a href="on-call_room" title="wikilink">on-call rooms</a> and a crew on duty at all times. The squadron aims as an average <a href="scrambling_(military)" title="wikilink">scrambling time</a> of 15 minutes; this varies between 10 and 25 minutes depending on the time of day, the layout of the base and preparations.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<p>The 330 Squadron is part of the <a href="National_Air_Ambulance_Service" title="wikilink">National Air Ambulance Service</a>. It carried out about 800 missions per year,<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> or about ten percent of the helicopter ambulance missions. They are used when the ordinary helicopter ambulances (<a href="Eurocopter_EC135" title="wikilink">Eurocopter EC135</a>, <a href="Eurocopter_EC145" title="wikilink">EC145</a> and <a href="AgustaWestland_AW139" title="wikilink">AgustaWestland AW139</a>) are unable to operate due to weather; missions in which a large cabin is needed such as due to the number of patients or an <a href="incubator_(neonatal)" title="wikilink">incubator</a>; and in areas where the Sea Kings are closer and areas where there is no ordinary air ambulance service. Ambulance use must be permitted by the JRCCs.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<p>When not used for SAR missions, the Sea Kings may be used for auxiliary and transport missions within the military, assisting the <a href="Norwegian_Police_Service" title="wikilink">Norwegian Police Service</a>, <a href="aerial_firefighting" title="wikilink">aerial firefighting</a> and anti-pollution.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>

</figure>
<p>The <a href="Royal_Norwegian_Navy_Air_Service" title="wikilink">Royal Norwegian Navy Air Service</a> ordered twelve N-3PBs on 12 March 1940. This was the first-ever order for <a href="Northrop_Corporation" title="wikilink">Northrop Corporation</a>. By the time the first aircraft was finished in December 1940, <a href="German_invasion_of_Norway" title="wikilink">German had invaded Norway</a>. The aircraft were therefore transferred to <a href="Little_Norway" title="wikilink">Little Norway</a> in <a href="Toronto" class="uri" title="wikilink">Toronto</a>, Canada. During late fall the Norwegian <a href="Nygaardsvold&#39;s_Cabinet" title="wikilink">Nygaardsvold's Cabinet</a> agreed with the <a href="Royal_Air_Force" title="wikilink">Royal Air Force</a> that Norway could use the Northrops to operate reconnaissance and escort services around Iceland.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>
<p>The 330 (Norwegian) Squadron was activated on 25 April 1941 and based at <a href="RAF_Reykjavik" title="wikilink">RAF Reykjavik</a>, also known as Corbett Camp, in the vicinity of <a href="Reykjav&lt;U+00ED&gt;k" class="uri" title="wikilink">Reykjav&lt;U+00ED&gt;k</a> on Iceland.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> The squadron originally consisted of 128 men, all Norwegian. These had various backgrounds: 80 were trained at Little Norway; most of the rest were seaman from sunk ships or brought in from <a href="Lofoten" class="uri" title="wikilink">Lofoten</a> during <a href="Operation_Claymore" title="wikilink">Operation Claymore</a>. These lacked military training, forcing the squadron to establish a <a href="recruit_training" title="wikilink">recruit school</a>.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> The base consisted of a dozen <a href="nissen_hut" title="wikilink">nissen huts</a>.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> The facilities were primitive and the soldiers forced to sleep on the muddy ground.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a></p>
<p><img src="Northrop_N3P-B.jpg" title="fig:Northrop N-3PB being used to transport a seriously ill woman to hospital in Reykjavik in Iceland, May 1942" alt="Northrop N-3PB being used to transport a seriously ill woman to hospital in Reykjavik in Iceland, May 1942" /> The squadron was under <a href="RAF_Coastal_Command" title="wikilink">RAF Coastal Command</a> in Reykjav&lt;U+00ED&gt;k.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> The eighteen Northrop N-3PB aircraft arrived by ship on 22 May.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> After final assembly they were operational on 23 June. The squadron was originally set to carry out <a href="Arctic_convoys_of_World_War_II" title="wikilink">Arctic convoy</a> escorts.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> The squadron's A-flight and headquarters were located at Corbett Camp, the B-flight was located at Valhall in <a href="Akureyri" class="uri" title="wikilink">Akureyri</a> and the C-flight at Camp Norse in <a href="B&lt;U+00FA&gt;&lt;U+00F0&gt;areyri" class="uri" title="wikilink">B&lt;U+00FA&gt;&lt;U+00F0&gt;areyri</a>. The latter two were established on 20 June and 14 September, respectively.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a></p>
<p>It was quickly established that the aircraft were poorly suited for their role. Due to the high latitude their compasses did not work properly, often leaving them without proper navigation. Two aircraft were subject to crashes after misnavigation.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> They participated in submarine sweeping and were part of the capture of <em><a href="U-570" class="uri" title="wikilink">U-570</a></em>. From late 1941 the missions changed focus and the squadron instead took up a role as an air ambulance in Iceland.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a></p>

<p>Both Norwegian and British authorities discussed converting the 330 Sqn to use the <a href="Lockheed_Hudson" title="wikilink">Lockheed Hudson</a>, but the fighter role was instead placed on two new Norwegian squadrons, <a href="No._331_Squadron_RAF" title="wikilink">331</a> and <a href="No._332_Squadron_RAF" title="wikilink">332</a>.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> No. 330 was instead issued the Consolidated PBY-5A Catalina in June 1942.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> However, they were unsuitable for B&lt;U+00FA&gt;&lt;U+00F0&gt;areyri and the Northrops were not needed in Reykjav&lt;U+00ED&gt;k, so the squadron ended up with six each of the Catalina and the Northrop.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> An operating challenge was lack of spare parts, but the Norwegians were helped both with parts and training by a near-by <a href="United_States_Air_Force" title="wikilink">United States Air Force</a> squadron.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a></p>
<p>The Catalinas retained the same roles as the Northrops: anti-submarine sweeping, patrol and convoy escort. The aircraft rotated between being based at Reykjav&lt;U+00ED&gt;k and at Akureyri.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> They successfully hit <em><a href="U-592" class="uri" title="wikilink">U-592</a></em> on 30 June and <em><a href="U-580" class="uri" title="wikilink">U-580</a></em> on 25 August 1942.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> In December the Norwegian authorities decided to relocate the 330 Sqn. The Akureyri base was immediately ordered to move its aircraft to Reykjav&lt;U+00ED&gt;k. Operations of the Catalina had commenced in November and of the Northrops in December.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> The C-flight continued to operate out of B&lt;U+00FA&gt;&lt;U+00F0&gt;areyri until 11 June 1943. During its period on Iceland the squadron flew 4379 hours, of which 3524 with the Northrops and 855 with Catalinas.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> Twenty-one soldiers were killed.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="scotland">Scotland</h3>
<p>The A- and B-flights departed Iceland for <a href="RAF_Oban" title="wikilink">RAF Oban</a> in Scotland on 23 January 1943.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> This involved a switch to the Short Sandringham flying boat. These were expensive aircraft which the Norwegian government-in-exile could not afford. The RAF therefore agreed to lend the aircraft to the squadron, while operating costs were still paid for by the Norwegians.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> The squadron was set up with six Mk II and six Mk III,<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> the latter having somewhat longer range.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> There were technical challenges with the <a href="Bristol_Pegasus" title="wikilink">Bristol Pegasus</a> engines, which were underpowered and often stopped mid-air. The situation was often aggravated when the <a href="feathering_(propeller)" title="wikilink">feathering</a> malfunctioned.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a></p>
<p><img src="Ole_Friele_Backer_Sunderland.jpg" title="fig:Short Sunderland of the 330 Sqn" alt="Short Sunderland of the 330 Sqn" /> The squadron became operative on 20 April 1943. Three days later a detachment was sent to <a href="RAF_Scatsta" title="wikilink">RAF Scatsta</a> on <a href="Shetland" class="uri" title="wikilink">Shetland</a>. The role continued as before, with submarine sweeping, patrol and reconnaissance, as well as <a href="meteorological" class="uri" title="wikilink">meteorological</a> surveys. They regularly patrolled the areas between Shetland past the <a href="Faeroe_Islands" title="wikilink">Faeroe Islands</a> to Iceland. Also active in the area was the Norwegian <a href="No._333_Squadron_RAF" title="wikilink">333 Squadron</a> and other RAF squadrons.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a> The Sunderlands would on occasion partake in aerial combat with German fighters. Following the <a href="Invasion_of_Normandy" title="wikilink">Invasion of Normandy</a> in June 1944, German submarines increasingly moved northwards and the 330 Sqn intensified its sweeping.<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> From August the German tactics changed and the 330 Sqn's patrols moved steadily closer to Norway.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a></p>
<p>During the period in Scotland the squadron flew 12,000 hours, carrying out 655 sweeps and patrols, 50 convoy escorts and 22 search and rescue missions. Five submarines were attacked, sinking one and badly damaging another. No ships escorted by the 330 Sqn were sunk. Six Sunderlands were lost during the war, both due to engine failure and due to enemy action. All but one resulted in loss of life.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a></p>
<p>In April 1945 the Mk II and III Sunderlands were replaced with Mk V, which had more reliable <a href="Pratt_&amp;_Whitney_Twin_Wasp" title="wikilink">Pratt &amp; Whitney Twin Wasp</a>.<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a> At the <a href="End_of_World_War_II_in_Europe" title="wikilink">End of World War II in Europe</a> in May 1945, the 330 Sqn had eleven operational Sunderlands. While the fighter squadrons were without work, the amount of work for the 330 and 333 Sqn intensified.<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a> There was a massive need for air transport, both from the UK to Norway and within Norway. Both were transferred to Norway in June, with the 330 Sqn being based at the water aerodrome at Sola Air Station. These were used on a daily coastal route from there to <a href="Bergen_Airport,_Sandviken" title="wikilink">Bergen Airport, Sandviken</a> and Trondheim,<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a> often onwards to <a href="Troms&lt;U+00F8&gt;_Airport,_Skatt&lt;U+00F8&gt;ra" title="wikilink">Troms&lt;U+00F8&gt; Airport, Skatt&lt;U+00F8&gt;ra</a>.<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a> Both squadrons were soon operating more as <a href="airline" title="wikilink">airlines</a> than as military units.<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a></p>
<p>Command of the squad was given to the newly formed Royal Norwegian Air Force in 21 November 1945, when RAF withdrew from Norway. The 330 Sqn was officially deactivated on 15 December 1945. The aircraft were still owned by the RAF, but were not returned until early 1946.

Half the crew were recruited from other F-84G squadrons, the rest were freshly trained. The first aircraft was acquired on 22 August and by November all had been taken into use. After completing its tactical and bombing training at <a href="Lista_Air_Station" title="wikilink">Lista Air Station</a> in March 1954, the squadron was declared operative.<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a></p>
<p>The squadron had between 22 and 27 airframes while operating the Thunderjets. It was originally set to provide <a href="interception" class="uri" title="wikilink">interception</a>, but from 1 November 1954 it was remissioned to become and operating training unit. All F-84G check-outs were carried out in the 330 Sqn, and the training pilots received twice the flight hours as their colleagues in other squadrons.<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a> Between the training courses the squadron practised bombing at <a href="Sola_Air_Station" title="wikilink">Sola Air Station</a> and participated in exercises. The 330 Sqn moved to Rygge Air Station on 28 August 1956. Following the retirement of the F-84G and the introduction of the <a href="North_American_F-86F_Sabre" title="wikilink">North American F-86F Sabre</a>, the 330 Sqn was deactivated on 5 July 1958.<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="albatross">Albatross</h3>
<p><img src="20071108-LGTT-HU16B-190.jpg" title="fig:After ending service in Norway the Albatrosses were transferred to the Hellenic Air Force, here depicting an ex-Norwegian heritage aircraft" alt="After ending service in Norway the Albatrosses were transferred to the Hellenic Air Force, here depicting an ex-Norwegian heritage aircraft" /> The 333 Sqn had continued to operate the Catalinas through the 1950s, although they by the end of the decade were all but modern. The Norwegian authorities agreed to receive eighteen <a href="Grumman_HU-16_Albatross" title="wikilink">Grumman HU-16B-ASW Albatrosses</a> through the Marshall Plan. These <a href="flying_boat" title="wikilink">flying boats</a> were intended for maritime surveillance and transport to <a href="Svalbard" class="uri" title="wikilink">Svalbard</a>,<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a> as well as submarine sweeping.<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a> 330 and 333 Sqn would receive nine airframes each. Combined they would provide 8,100 flight-hours annual, up from 2,400 with the Catalinas. Training was carried out by the <a href="United_States_Coast_Guard" title="wikilink">United States Coast Guard</a> and <a href="United_States_Air_Force" title="wikilink">Air Force</a>.<a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a></p>
<p>The 300 Sqn's first Albatross landed in February 1962 and the unit was activated at Sola Air Station on 1 March. Delivery of the final aircraft took place in late 1963. The 330 Sqn was designated the operational training unit and all check-outs took place at Sola for both squadrons. From late 1962 a detachment was established at Bardufoss Air Station with one aircraft and one crew.<a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a> The 330 Sqn was declared operative from 15 July 1963. The detachment was a strain on the unit's moral and its commanded asked his subordinates to withdraw it and replace it with a mobilized unit. The resources used to support the detachment made the 330 Sqn almost unable to provide sweeping operations.<a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a></p>
<p>The Albatrosses improved the sweeping capacity and introduced news technology such as <a href="sonar" class="uri" title="wikilink">sonar</a>, <a href="radar" class="uri" title="wikilink">radar</a> and <a href="magnetic_anomaly_detector" title="wikilink">magnetic anomaly detector</a>. Norway did not have capacity to sweep its waters and instead focused on the surveillance. This allowed both British and United States forces to carry out such tasks.<a href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a> Despite the leap in technology, the Albatrosses were soon declared obsolete. <a href="Allied_Forces_Northern_Europe" title="wikilink">Allied Forces Northern Europe</a> determined that they needed full anti-submarine capabilities and opted to replace the flying boats with the <a href="Lockheed_P-3_Orion" title="wikilink">Lockheed P-3 Orion</a>.<a href="#fn67" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a> Five Orions were capable of the same job as eighteen Albatrosses, and the number of squadrons was cut to one. The 330 Sqn was therefore deactivated on 1 October 1968.<a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="sea-king">Sea King</h3>
<p><img src="NoRAF_Westland_Sea_King_at_Flesland.jpg" title="fig:Sea King at Bergen Airport, Flesland" alt="Sea King at Bergen Airport, Flesland" /> Search and rescue was at the time only a secondary role for various air force units, such as the Albatross, <a href="Bell_UH-1_Iroquois_variants" title="wikilink">Bell UH-1B</a> and <a href="Bell_47" title="wikilink">Bell 47</a>. Norway lacked the dedicated SAR service that Denmark had. This became evident in 1966, when the Norwegian ferry <a href="MF_Skagerrak" title="wikilink"><em>Skagerrak</em></a> sank off the Danish coast in September 1966. Everyone on board was saved, but it was questioned whether this would have been the case if it had been in Norwegian waters.<a href="#fn69" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref69"><sup>69</sup></a> The task was given to the Ministry of Justice, who as a temporary solution from 1968 to 1973 signed an agreement with <a href="Helikopter_Service" title="wikilink">Helikopter Service</a> to operate two <a href="Sikorsky_S-61" title="wikilink">Sikorsky S-61</a> out of Sola and Bod&lt;U+00F8&gt;.<a href="#fn70" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a></p>
<p>Both a private operation with civilian aircraft, a military operation and a joint civilian and military operation were considered. A single operator built with a fast roll-out would give the lowest investments.<a href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a> The Air Force was interested in operating this service to replace its own rescue service, to gain political goodwill and to add to the anti-submarine capability. The latter was rejected by the politicians. The Westland Sea King was chosen over the S-61 due to a better <a href="offset_agreement" title="wikilink">offset agreement</a>. <a href="Parliament_of_Norway" title="wikilink">Parliament</a> approved the purchase of ten helicopters in 1970,<a href="#fn72" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref72"><sup>72</sup></a> to be stationed at four bases, Sola, &lt;U+00D8&gt;rland, Bod&lt;U+00F8&gt; and Banak. This would allow any location along the coast to be reached within 90 minutes.<a href="#fn73" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref73"><sup>73</sup></a> The <a href="Oslofjord" class="uri" title="wikilink">Oslofjord</a> and <a href="Skagerrak" class="uri" title="wikilink">Skagerrak</a> was covered by Bell UH-1s of the <a href="No._720_Squadron_RNoAF" title="wikilink">720 Squadron</a> at Rygge.<a href="#fn74" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref74"><sup>74</sup></a></p>
<p><img src="Norwegian_Air_Force_SAR_Westland_Sea_King_Mk43B_Bidini-1.jpg" title="fig:Sea King at &lt;U+00D8&gt;rland Main Air Station" alt="Sea King at &lt;U+00D8&gt;rland Main Air Station" /> The 330 Sqn was assigned the SAR task and was headquartered at Bod&lt;U+00F8&gt; Main Air Station, with a <a href="wing_(military_aviation_unit)" title="wikilink">wing</a> at each location. The A-wing was at Bod&lt;U+00F8&gt;, the B-wing at Banak, the C-wing at &lt;U+00D8&gt;rland and the D-wing at Sola. Of ten aircraft, two were stationed at each base and two were at any given time in for overhaul. The wings were named detachments from 1980. The squadron was officially reactivated on 25 April 1973.<a href="#fn75" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref75"><sup>75</sup></a> The wings at Sola and Bod&lt;U+00F8&gt; were operative 1 May and the other two on 1 August.<a href="#fn76" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref76"><sup>76</sup></a> The first major was on 7 April 1974, when the Banak wing saved 13 lives off the trawler <em>Longvabakk</em> in <a href="Oksfjorden" class="uri" title="wikilink">Oksfjorden</a>.<a href="#fn77" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref77"><sup>77</sup></a></p>
<p>Especially among the first officers the SAR service was not what they had foreseen when joining the air force and many applied to the <a href="Norwegian_Air_Force_Academy" title="wikilink">Air Force Academy</a>. This caused new first officers to be ordered to the 300 Sqn, which reinforced the problems, resulting in high <a href="turnover_(employment)" title="wikilink">turnover</a>.<a href="#fn78" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref78"><sup>78</sup></a> The Sea Kings were designed to be maritime helicopters, but were increasingly used for terrestrial SAR missions, and on occasion <a href="aerial_firefighting" title="wikilink">aerial firefighting</a>.<a href="#fn79" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref79"><sup>79</sup></a> Throughout the 1970s the number of air ambulance missions increased dramatically, hitting 242 in 1977.<a href="#fn80" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref80"><sup>80</sup></a></p>
<p><img src="Seakingbodo.JPG" title="fig:Sea King and ambulance during a mission near Bod&lt;U+00F8&gt;" alt="Sea King and ambulance during a mission near Bod&lt;U+00F8&gt;" /> On 30 April 1977 one helicopter disappeared off the coast of Sola. A Replacement helicopter was delivered in January 1978. Three helicopters participated in the most extensive operation following the sinking of <a href="Alexander_L._Kielland_(platform)" title="wikilink"><em>Alexander L. Kielland</em></a> on 27 March 1980. for On 22 April 1982 another helicopter crashed, this time without fatalities, when hitting a power line in <a href="Sirdal" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sirdal</a>.<a href="#fn81" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref81"><sup>81</sup></a> This reoccurred on 10 November 1986 near <a href="Bod&lt;U+00F8&gt;" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bod&lt;U+00F8&gt;</a>, this time with one fatality. Another helicopter crashed at <a href="Tyinvann" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tyinvann</a> in 1988, without fatalities and with the aircraft being repaired. During the late 1980s the helicopters were often grounded due to lack of spare parts, which on 6 July 1988 hindered the unit form participating in aiding the sinking <em><a href="Piper_Alpha" title="wikilink">Piper Alpha</a></em>.<a href="#fn82" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref82"><sup>82</sup></a></p>
<p>The <a href="National_Air_Ambulance_Service" title="wikilink">National Air Ambulance Service</a> was inaugurated in 1988 and the 330 Sqn became part of this. This involved the establishment of eight smaller helicopter ambulances&lt;U+2014&gt;later increased to twelve&lt;U+2014&gt;which could relieve the Sea Kings. Meanwhile the air ambulance role of the Sea Kings were increased with the inclusions of an <a href="anesthesiologist" class="uri" title="wikilink">anesthesiologist</a> on board. This would also aid in SAR missions, where the rescued could be severely injured. The task of providing the anesthesiologist was placed with the <a href="county_municipality_(Norway)" title="wikilink">county municipality</a>.<a href="#fn83" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref83"><sup>83</sup></a></p>
<p><img src="Norwegian_Air_Force_SAR_Westland_Sea_King_Mk43B_Pichugin-1.jpg" title="fig:Sea King during flight" alt="Sea King during flight" /> The accident in 1988 reduced the fleet to eight. This spurred the Ministry of Justice to <a href="wet_lease" title="wikilink">wet lease</a> the services of commercial companies, Helikopter Service and <a href="M&lt;U+00F8&gt;refly" class="uri" title="wikilink">M&lt;U+00F8&gt;refly</a>, variously operating S-61 and <a href="Eurocopter_AS332_Super_Puma" title="wikilink">Eurocopter AS332 Super Puma</a>. These were placed at <a href="&lt;U+00C5&gt;lesund_Airport,_Vigra" title="wikilink">&lt;U+00C5&gt;lesund Airport, Vigra</a> from 1 November 1988 to 31 January 1989, at <a href="Sandefjord_Airport,_Torp" title="wikilink">Sandefjord Airport, Torp</a> from 1 February 1989 to 31 December 1990, and from 1 January to 31 July 1991 at Sola.<a href="#fn84" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref84"><sup>84</sup></a></p>
<p>The Sea Kings had two accidents in 1990 and 1991, respectively, after which the helicopters needed to be renovated. A new Mk 43B was delivered in August 1992, followed by the renovated aircraft from the 1990 crash. The main difference was new <a href="avionics" class="uri" title="wikilink">avionics</a>. The squadron then, one by one, upgraded the avionics on the entire fleet, a job completed in 1996.<a href="#fn85" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref85"><sup>85</sup></a> The role of the SAR service was evaluated in 1992 and it ended up with Parliament approving the purchase of two more helicopters, bringing the total to twelve. These were delivered in 1995.<a href="#fn86" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref86"><sup>86</sup></a></p>
<p>With the additional helicopters, the 330 Sqn could open a new base, at <a href="&lt;U+00C5&gt;lesund_Airport,_Vigra" title="wikilink">&lt;U+00C5&gt;lesund Airport, Vigra</a>. The goal was to increase the coverage in <a href="M&lt;U+00F8&gt;re_og_Romsdal" title="wikilink">M&lt;U+00F8&gt;re og Romsdal</a> and <a href="Sogn_og_Fjordane" title="wikilink">Sogn og Fjordane</a>, situated midway between &lt;U+00D8&gt;rland and Sola. By 1998 the government instead determined that the extra helicopters should be based in <a href="Eastern_Norway" title="wikilink">Eastern Norway</a> and moved the base to Rygge Air Station. The new base became operational on 22 March 1999.<a href="#fn87" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref87"><sup>87</sup></a> This relieved the 720 Sqn for their SAR task, for which they neither had suitable aircraft nor the necessary preparedness.<a href="#fn88" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref88"><sup>88</sup></a></p>
<p>From 2002 the anesthesiologist became the responsibility of the respective <a href="health_trust" title="wikilink">health trust</a>. From 2004 the funding was changed and the 330 Sqn is paid for through the Ministry of Justice and the Police. From the start the service had a reaction time, from alarm to airborne, of 60 minutes. Sola was the first base to receive an <a href="on-call_room" title="wikilink">on-call room</a>, allowing the response time to sink to 15 minutes. This proved successful and was introduced at Banak in 2006, Bod&lt;U+00F8&gt; in 2007, and &lt;U+00D8&gt;rland and Rygge in 2008. A sixth base was opened at <a href="Flor&lt;U+00F8&gt;_Airport" title="wikilink">Flor&lt;U+00F8&gt; Airport</a> in 2009.<a href="#fn89" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref89"><sup>89</sup></a> The 330 Squadron was featured in an eight-episode television documentary series of the same name, broadcast by the <a href="Norwegian_Broadcasting_Corporation" title="wikilink">Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation</a> in 2009.<a href="#fn90" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref90"><sup>90</sup></a></p>

<p><img src="Royal_Navy_Merlin_Helicopter_MOD_45155806.jpg" title="fig:AgustaWestland AW101 of the Royal Navy" alt="AgustaWestland AW101 of the Royal Navy" /> The replacement of the Sea Kings was first discussed in a <em><a href="Norwegian_Official_Report" title="wikilink">Norwegian Official Report</a></em> in 1997.<a href="#fn91" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref91"><sup>91</sup></a> In competition with the <a href="AgustaWestland_AW101" title="wikilink">AgustaWestland AW101</a>, the <a href="Eurocopter_AS532_Cougar" title="wikilink">Eurocopter AS532 Cougar</a> and the <a href="Sikorsky_S-92" title="wikilink">Sikorsky S-92</a>, Norway ordered fourteen <a href="NHIndustries_NH90" title="wikilink">NHIndustries NH90</a> helicopters in 2001 to meet the nees of the <a href="Royal_Norwegian_Navy" title="wikilink">Royal Norwegian Navy</a>. <a href="Option_(aircraft_purchasing)" title="wikilink">Options</a> would be places for a future ten SAR helicopters and fifteen troop transporters. By operating only one class of helicopters, the Air Force hoped to cut costs.<a href="#fn92" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref92"><sup>92</sup></a></p>
<p>The Ministry of Justice canceled the options in 2007 and instead initiated a new procurement process. This resulted in a project organization being established, Norwegian All Weather Search and Rescue Helicopter (NAWSARH). The procurement was in cooperation with Icelandic authorities.<a href="#fn93" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref93"><sup>93</sup></a> The project prequalified four models, NH90, AW101, AS532 and S-92. On 8 November 2013 the project announced that it had selected AgustaWestland as the provider. The contract is for sixteen units with an option for a further six. The first helicopter is scheduled for delivery in 2017 and the last Sea King is planned to be retired by 2020.<a href="#fn94" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref94"><sup>94</sup></a></p>
