<p>The <strong>Gay Nigger Association of America</strong> (often referred to as the <strong>GNAA</strong>) is an anti-<a href="blogging" class="uri" title="wikilink">blogging</a> <a href="Internet_trolling" title="wikilink">Internet trolling</a> organization that aims to disrupt the Internet. They take their name from the 1992 Danish movie <em><a href="Gayniggers_from_Outer_Space" title="wikilink">Gayniggers from Outer Space</a></em>, and do not promote racism or homophobia. They have trolled several prominent websites and Internet commentators, including members of blogging culture, <a href="Slashdot" class="uri" title="wikilink">Slashdot</a>, <a href="Wikipedia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Wikipedia</a>, and <a href="CNN" class="uri" title="wikilink">CNN</a>. They have also released software products and leaked information about operating systems. In addition, they maintain a wiki-based site dedicated to Internet commentary in a style parodying Slashdot posts and offer a <a href="Apache_Subversion" title="wikilink">Subversion</a>-based software repository containing various GNAA coding projects.</p>
<p>Members of the GNAA also founded <a href="Goatse_Security" title="wikilink">Goatse Security</a>, a <a href="Ethical_Hacking" title="wikilink">white hat</a> information security group. Members of Goatse Security released information in June 2010 about a vulnerability located on <a href="AT&amp;T" class="uri" title="wikilink">AT&amp;T</a>'s website that notably affected the privacy of people who pre-ordered the <a href="iPad" class="uri" title="wikilink">iPad</a>. After the information was released, the then-president of the GNAA, <a href="weev" class="uri" title="wikilink">weev</a>, and GNAA member &quot;JacksonBrown&quot; were arrested.</p>
<h2 id="origins-and-purpose">Origins and purpose</h2>
<p>The group claims to have been founded in 2002.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> Little is known about the group's structure. New media researcher <a href="Andrew_Lih" title="wikilink">Andrew Lih</a> has claimed that it is unclear whether there was initially a clearly defined group of GNAA members, or if founding members of the GNAA were online troublemakers united under the name in order to disrupt websites.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> However, an article on <a href="Boing_Boing" title="wikilink">Boing Boing</a> notes that the group is often perceived to be a very unified tightly-knit organization.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> The group's name has been controversial. According to Lih it causes &quot;immediate alarm in anyone with a semblance of good taste,&quot; and an article in <em><a href="The_Scotsman" title="wikilink">The Scotsman</a></em> characterized it as &quot;spectacularly offensive.&quot; However, the group claims that it promotes neither racism nor homophobia. The name &quot;Gay Nigger Association of America&quot; is often perceived as <a href="racism" title="wikilink">racist</a> and offensive, mainly because of the word &quot;<a href="Nigger_(word)" title="wikilink">nigger</a>.&quot; GNAA members deny allegations of actual racism, implying that these statements are made only to elicit angry responses and to subvert or otherwise challenge long-standing social <a href="Norm_(sociology)" title="wikilink">norms</a>, and note that the name of the organization came from the 1992 Danish satirical <a href="blaxploitation" class="uri" title="wikilink">blaxploitation</a> film <em>Gayniggers from Outer Space</em>.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>The group's aim is to sow disruption on the Internet. They are particularly antagonistic towards blogs,<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> but have also aimed to disrupt online communities such as Wikipedia. On Wikipedia the group has adhered to every rule in order to use the site's system against itself.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> Though they have disrupted online communities, the group does not organize <a href="denial_of_service" title="wikilink">denial of service</a> attacks.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p>Several members of the GNAA with expertise in white hat<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> security research began releasing information about security vulnerabilities under the name &quot;Goatse Security.&quot; They chose a new name to publish their work under because they were worried that their work would not get noticed if published by the &quot;Gay Nigger Association of America.&quot;<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="trolling">Trolling</h2>
<p>Members of the GNAA have engaged in a variety of types of trolling. One tactic is flooding weblogs with a massive amount of repeated words and phrases, sometimes referred to as &quot;crapflooding.&quot;<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a><a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> They have also produced shock sites and used links to redirect Internet users to the sites.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> One such site, &quot;Last Measure,&quot; contained malware that opened up pop-up windows containing shocking pictures.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> On Wikipedia, members of the group created pages with a controversial and offensive names, in order to shock community members.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<p>They have also participated in <a href="Internet_Relay_Chat" title="wikilink">IRC</a> channel <a href="Internet_Relay_Chat_flood" title="wikilink">disruption</a>. They have used obscure methods to force IRC users to execute commands after visiting websites containing malware.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> They also have used bugs in <a href="Firefox" class="uri" title="wikilink">Firefox</a> to crapflood IRC channels.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> They have also performed <a href="proof_of_concept" title="wikilink">proof of concept</a> demonstrations.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a><a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> These actions have occasionally interrupted the normal operation of popular websites such as Slashdot, even forcing some websites (such as <a href="4chan" class="uri" title="wikilink">4chan</a>) to shut down temporarily.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> As such, targeted communities generally consider GNAA crapfloods to be a serious matter and frequently respond with technological and social anti-trolling measures such as moderation systems to limit future disruption.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>
<p>In <a href="July_2004" title="wikilink">July 2004</a>, two GNAA members submitted leaked <a href="screenshot" title="wikilink">screenshots</a> of the forthcoming <a href="operating_system" title="wikilink">operating system</a> <a href="Mac_OS_X_v10.4" title="wikilink">Mac OS X v10.4</a> to the popular <a href="Apple_Computer" title="wikilink">Apple</a> <a href="Apple_Macintosh" title="wikilink">Macintosh</a> news website <a href="MacRumors" class="uri" title="wikilink">MacRumors</a>, which read &quot;With <a href="Worldwide_Developers_Conference" title="wikilink">WWDC</a> just days away, the first Tiger information and screenshots appears to have been leaked. According to sources, Apple will reportedly provide developers with a Mac OS X 10.4 preview copy at WWDC on Monday. The screenshots provided reportedly come from this upcoming developer preview.&quot;<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> Later, when accusations were raised that the images were fabricated, the GNAA released a press release which claimed that the screenshots were genuine and stated that they had &quot;trolled&quot; the Apple community.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a></p>
<p>In <a href="June_2005" title="wikilink">June 2005</a>, the GNAA claimed to have created a <a href="Mac_OS_X" title="wikilink">Mac OS X</a> Tiger release for <a href="Intel_x86" title="wikilink">Intel x86</a> processors which caught media attention from various sources.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a><a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a><a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> The next day, the supposed leak and was mentioned on the <a href="G4_(television)" title="wikilink">G4</a> show <em><a href="Attack_of_the_Show!" title="wikilink">Attack of the Show</a></em>.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> The DVD image released via <a href="BitTorrent_(protocol)" title="wikilink">BitTorrent</a> merely booted an image of <a href="Goatse" title="wikilink">hello.jpg</a><a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> instead of the leaked operating system as many were led to believe.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> and the remaining gigabytes of space on the DVD were filled with a repetition of the text &quot;GNAAGNAA...&quot;</p>
<p>On February 3, 2007, the GNAA successfully convinced CNN reporter <a href="Paula_Zahn" title="wikilink">Paula Zahn</a> that &quot;one in three Americans&quot; believe the <a href="September_11,_2001" title="wikilink">September 11, 2001</a> terror attacks were carried out by Israeli agents.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> CNN subsequently ran a story, erroneously reporting this, including screenshots of the GNAA-owned website &quot;jewsdidwtc.com.&quot; The story involved a round-table discussion regarding antisemitism and an interview with the father of a Jewish 9/11 victim.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> The GNAA-owned website included claims that &quot;over 4,000&quot; Jews were absent from work at the World Trade Center on 9/11.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="goatse-security">Goatse Security</h2>
<p><img src="Goatse_Security_Logo.png" title="fig:Goatse Security logo" alt="Goatse Security logo" />  In June 2010, Goatse Security attracted mainstream media attention for their disclosure of 114,000 <a href="email_address" title="wikilink">email addresses</a><a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> registered to Apple <a href="iPad" class="uri" title="wikilink">iPad</a> devices for early adopters of Apple's 3G iPad service.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a><a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> The data was aggregated from <a href="AT&amp;T" class="uri" title="wikilink">AT&amp;T</a>'s own servers by feeding a publicly available script with <a href="HTTP" class="uri" title="wikilink">HTTP</a> requests containing randomly generated <a href="ICC-ID" title="wikilink">ICC-IDs</a>, which would then return the associated email address. The <a href="FBI" class="uri" title="wikilink">FBI</a> soon investigated the incident. This investigation led to the arrest of then-GNAA President,<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> Andrew '<a href="weev" class="uri" title="wikilink">weev</a>' Auernheimer, on unrelated <a href="Drug_possession" title="wikilink">drug charges</a> resulting from an FBI search of his house.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a><a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> Auernheimer and fellow GNAA member Daniel Spitler (also known as &quot;JacksonBrown&quot;) were also mentioned in connection with the hack. A spokesman for Goatse Security expressed outrage over Auernheimer's arrest, stating: </p>
