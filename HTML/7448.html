<p><strong>Systemin</strong> is a <a href="plant_peptide_hormone" title="wikilink">plant peptide hormone</a> involved in the wound response in the <a href="Solanaceae" class="uri" title="wikilink">Solanaceae</a> plant family, it was the first <a href="plant_hormone" title="wikilink">plant hormone</a> that was proven to be a <a href="peptide" class="uri" title="wikilink">peptide</a>. It was discovered in tomato leaves in 1991, since then other peptides, with similar functions have been identified in tomato and outside of the Solanaceae. <a href="Hydroxyproline" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hydroxyproline</a>-rich <a href="glycoprotein" title="wikilink">glycopeptides</a> were found in <a href="Nicotiana" title="wikilink">tobacco</a> in 2001 and AtPEPs were found in <em><a href="Arabidopsis_thaliana" title="wikilink">Arabidopsis thaliana</a></em> in 2006. Their precursors are found both in the <a href="cytoplasm" class="uri" title="wikilink">cytoplasm</a> and <a href="plant_cell_wall" title="wikilink">cell walls</a> of <a href="plant_cell" title="wikilink">plant cells</a>, upon insect damage, the precursors are processed to produce one or more mature peptides. The <a href="Receptor_(biochemistry)" title="wikilink">receptor</a> for systemin was first thought to be the same as the <a href="brassinolide" class="uri" title="wikilink">brassinolide</a> receptor but this is now uncertain. The <a href="signal_transduction" title="wikilink">signal transduction</a> processes that occur after the peptides bind are similar to the <a href="cytokine" class="uri" title="wikilink">cytokine</a>-mediated <a href="inflammation" title="wikilink">inflammatory immune response</a> in animals. Early experiments showed that systemin travelled around the plant after insects had damaged the plant, activating <a href="systemic_acquired_resistance" title="wikilink">systemic acquired resistance</a>, now it is thought that it increases the production of <a href="jasmonic_acid" title="wikilink">jasmonic acid</a> causing the same result. The main function of systemins and is to coordinate defensive responses against <a href="insect" class="uri" title="wikilink">insect</a> <a href="herbivory" title="wikilink">herbivores</a> but they also affect <a href="Plant_development#Plant_development" title="wikilink">plant development</a>. Systemin induces the production of <a href="protease_inhibitor_(biology)" title="wikilink">protease inhibitors</a> which protect against insect herbivores, other peptides activate <a href="defensin" title="wikilink">defensins</a> and modify root growth. They have also been shown to affect plants' responses to salt stress and UV radiation. AtPEPs have been shown to affect resistance against <a href="oomycete" title="wikilink">oomycetes</a> and may allow <em>A. thaliana</em> to distinguish between different pathogens. In <em><a href="Nicotiana_attenuata" title="wikilink">Nicotiana attenuata</a></em>, some of the peptides have stopped being involved in defensive roles and instead affect <a href="Flower#Morphology" title="wikilink">flower morphology</a>.</p>

<p><img src="Systemin_structures.png" title="fig:Structures and predicted structures of systemins, HypSys and AtPeps" alt="Structures and predicted structures of systemins, HypSys and AtPeps" /> In 1991, an 18 amino acid <a href="polypeptide" class="uri" title="wikilink">polypeptide</a> was isolated from tomato leaves, that induced the production of <a href="protease_inhibitor" title="wikilink">protease inhibitor</a> proteins (PIs) in response to wounding. Experiments using synthetic <a href="isotopic_labeling#Radioisotopic_labeling" title="wikilink">radio-labelled</a> forms of the polypeptide demonstrated that it was able to travel systemically through the plant and induce PI production in unwounded leaves. Because of the systemic nature of the wounding signal, it was named systemin, it was the first polypeptide found to function as a hormone in plants.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> <a href="mRNA" class="uri" title="wikilink">mRNA</a> encoding for systemin is found in all tissues of the plant except the roots.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> Later studies identified <a href="Homology_(biology)" title="wikilink">homologs</a> of tomato systemin in other members of the <a href="Solanaceae" class="uri" title="wikilink">Solanaceae</a> including <a href="potato" class="uri" title="wikilink">potato</a>, <a href="black_nightshade" title="wikilink">black nightshade</a> and <a href="bell_pepper" title="wikilink">bell pepper</a>.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> Systemins have only been identified in the <a href="Solaneae" class="uri" title="wikilink">Solaneae</a> subtribe of the Solanaceae, but other members of the family, such as <a href="Nicotiana" title="wikilink">tobacco</a>, also respond to wounding by systemically producing protease inhibitors.</p>

<p>In 2001, biologically active <a href="hydroxyproline" class="uri" title="wikilink">hydroxyproline</a>-rich <a href="glycoprotein" title="wikilink">glycopeptides</a> were isolated from tobacco which activated the production of protease inhibitors in a similar way to systemin in tomatoes.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> Although they are structurally unrelated to systemins, their similar function resulted in them being named hydroxyproline-rich systemins (HypSys). Following the initial discovery other HypSys peptides were found in tomato, <em><a href="Petunia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Petunia</a></em> and <a href="black_nightshade" title="wikilink">black nightshade</a>.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a><a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a><a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> In 2007, HypSys were found outside the Solanaceae, in sweet potato (<em><a href="Ipomoea_batatas" title="wikilink">Ipomoea batatas</a></em>)<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> and sequence analysis identified HypSys analogs in poplar (<em><a href="Populus_trichocarpa" title="wikilink">Populus trichocarpa</a></em>) and coffee (<em><a href="Coffea_canephora" title="wikilink">Coffea canephora</a></em>).<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> Systemins are highly conserved between species, whereas HypSys are more divergent but all contain a conserved <a href="proline" class="uri" title="wikilink">proline</a> or <a href="hydroxyproline" class="uri" title="wikilink">hydroxyproline</a>-rich central domain.</p>
<p>In 2006, AtPEP1, a 23 amino acid polypeptide was isolated from <em><a href="Arabidopsis_thaliana" title="wikilink">Arabidopsis thaliana</a></em>, which was found to activate components of the <a href="innate_immune_system" title="wikilink">innate immune response</a>.

<h2 id="localisation-and-precursors">Localisation and precursors</h2>
<p>Systemin and AtPEP1 are found in the cell <a href="cytosol" class="uri" title="wikilink">cytosol</a>. The <a href="Protein_precursor" title="wikilink">precursor</a> to tomato systemin is <a href="transcription_(genetics)" title="wikilink">transcribed</a> as a 200 amino acid polypeptide.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> It does not contain a putative <a href="protein_targeting" title="wikilink">signal sequence</a> suggesting that it is synthesised on free <a href="ribosome" title="wikilink">ribosomes</a> in the cytosol.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> The precursor to AtPEP1 is a 92 amino acid polypeptide and also lacks a signal sequence.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> In tomato, <a href="mRNA" class="uri" title="wikilink">mRNA</a> encoding the precursor for systemin is present at very low levels in unwounded leaves but accumulates upon wounding, particularly in the cells surrounding the sieve elements of the <a href="phloem" class="uri" title="wikilink">phloem</a> in vascular bundles of mid veins. The precursor accumulates exclusively in the phloem <a href="parenchyma" class="uri" title="wikilink">parenchyma</a> cells of leaves in tomato after wounding. The precursor to potato systemin is also localised in a similar manner suggesting it is under the same cell-type-specific regulation in both species.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<p>HypSys are localised in the <a href="plant_cell_wall" title="wikilink">cell wall</a>. The precursor for tobacco HypSys is transcribed as a 165 amino acid polypeptide which has no structural homology to the precursor for systemin in tomato.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> The structural properties of HypSys, containing hydroxyproline and being glycosylated, indicate that they are synthesised through the <a href="Secretory_pathway" title="wikilink">secretory system</a>.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> The precursor to HypSys in tomato is a 146 amino acid polypeptide, exclusively synthesised within the vascular bundles of leaves and <a href="petiole" title="wikilink">petioles</a> associated with parenchyma cells of phloem bundles. Unlike systemin, it is primarily associated with the cell wall. The precursors to HypSys appear to represent a distinct subfamily of hydroxyproline-rich proteins found in cell walls. Upon wounding it is thought that a protease from the cytosol, the cell wall matrix, or the pathogen, processes the precursor producing active HypSys peptides.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="processing-of-precursors">Processing of precursors</h3>

<p>Exceedingly small amounts of tomato systemin are active, <a href="femto-" class="uri" title="wikilink">femto-</a><a href="Molar_concentration" title="wikilink">molar</a> concentrations of the peptide are sufficient to elicit a response at the whole plant level, making it one of the most potent gene activators identified.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a><a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> A <a href="Receptor_(biochemistry)" title="wikilink">receptor</a> for tomato systemin was identified as a 160K<a href="Dalton" title="wikilink">Da</a> <a href="leucine-rich_repeat" title="wikilink">leucine-rich repeat</a> receptor like <a href="kinase" class="uri" title="wikilink">kinase</a> (LRR-RLK), SR160. After being isolated it was found that was very similar in structure to BRI1 from <em>A. thaliana</em>, the receptor that <a href="brassinolide" title="wikilink">brassinolides</a> bind to on the cell membrane. This was the first receptor which was found to be able to bind both a <a href="steroid" class="uri" title="wikilink">steroid</a> and a peptide <a href="ligand" class="uri" title="wikilink">ligand</a> and also to be involved in both defensive and developmental responses.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> Recent studies have found that the initial conclusion that BRI1 is the receptor for tomato systemin may be incorrect. In <em>cu3</em> mutants of tomato, a <a href="null_allele" title="wikilink">null allele</a> with a <a href="stop_codon" title="wikilink">stop codon</a> present in the extracellular LRR domain of BRI1 prevents the receptor from being localised correctly and it also lacks the kinase domain, required for signalling.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> These mutants are insensitive to brassinolide yet still respond to tomato systemin by producing protease inhibitors and causing an alkalisation response. This led Holton <em>et al.</em> to suggest that there is another mechanism by which systemin is perceived.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> Further investigation showed that binding of systemin to BRI1 does not cause the receptor to become phosphorylated, as when brassinolides bind, suggesting that it does not transduce a signal. When BRI1 is <a href="gene_silencing" title="wikilink">silenced</a> in tomato, the plants have a similar phenotype to <em>cu3</em> mutants yet are still able to respond normally to systemin, strengthening the view that BRI1 is not the systemin receptor.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1994, tomato systemin was found to bind to a 50KDa protein in the cell membrane of tomato. The protein has a structure similar to proteases of the Kex2p-like <a href="prohormone_convertase" title="wikilink">prohormone convertases</a>. This led Schaller and Ryan to suggest that it is not a receptor, but instead is involved in the processing of ProSys into the active form, or the degradation of Sys. Synthetic forms of tomato systemin, with substituted amino acids at the predicted <a href="dibasic" class="uri" title="wikilink">dibasic</a> cleavage site, remained stable in cell cultures for longer than the native form.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> Later studies have noted that the enzymes responsible for processing ProSys remain unidentified.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> No further research has been reported on the 50KDa protein to date, and the gene has not been identified.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a></p>
<p>No receptors for HypSys have so far been reported, but it is thought that they are perceived on the cell membrane by a LRR-RLK.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a></p>
<p>The receptor for AtPep1 has been identified as a 170KDa LRR-RLK and has been named AtPEPR1. AtPep1 is active at 0.1 <a href="nano-" title="wikilink">nano-molar</a> (nM) concentrations and the receptor saturates at 1nM. An analysis of the structure of the AtPEPR1 receptor has shown that it is a member of the LRR XI subfamily of LRR-RLKs in <em>A. thaliana</em> which includes the receptor for another peptide hormone <a href="CLAVATA3" class="uri" title="wikilink">CLAVATA3</a>. Transforming tobacco cell cultures with <em>AtPEPR1</em> allowed them to respond to AtPep1 in an alkalisation assay, whereas normal tobacco did not show such a response.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> BRI1-associated receptor kinase 1 (BAK1) is an LRR-RLK found in <em>A. thaliana</em>, which has been proposed to function as an <a href="adaptor_protein" title="wikilink">adaptor protein</a> that is required for the proper functioning of other RLKs. <a href="Two-hybrid_screening" title="wikilink">Yeast two-hybrid assays</a> have shown that AtPEPR1 and its closest analog, AtPEPR2, interact with BAK1.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a></p>

<p>Although the receptors for systemins and HypSys remain poorly understood, we have a better understanding of the <a href="signal_transduction" title="wikilink">signal transduction</a> that occurs once the peptide had bound to its receptor. <a href="Jasmonic_acid" title="wikilink">Jasmonic acid</a> is an essential, albeit late component, in the systemin and wound-signalling pathways. In tomato, the signal is transduced from the receptor by <a href="mitogen-activated_protein_kinase" title="wikilink">mitogen-activated protein kinases</a> (MAPKs).<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> Cosilencing of two MAPKs, MPK1 and MPK2, in tomato compromised their defence response against insect larvae compared to <a href="wild_type" title="wikilink">wild type</a> plants. Cosilencing these genes also decreased production of jasmonic acid and of jasmonic acid-dependent defence genes. Applying <a href="methyl_jasmonate" title="wikilink">methyl jasmonate</a> to cosilenced plants rescued them, indicating that jasmonates are the signal responsible for causing changes in gene expression.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> The alkalisation of the apoplast is a downstream effect of signalling processing by MAPKs. Applying <a href="fusicoccin" class="uri" title="wikilink">fusicoccin</a>, which activates the <a href="V-ATPase" title="wikilink">H<sup>+</sup> ATPase</a> inhibited by systemin, along with systemin still activates MAPKs, even though the pH of the apoplast does not change.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a></p>
<p>Within minutes of systemin perception, the <a href="cytosol" title="wikilink">cytosolic</a> <a href="calcium_in_biology" title="wikilink">Ca<sup>2+</sup></a> concentration increases, and <a href="linolenic_acid" title="wikilink">linolenic acid</a> is released from cell membranes after a <a href="phospholipase" class="uri" title="wikilink">phospholipase</a> has been activated. Linolenic acid is then converted to jasmonic acid via the <a href="octadecanoid_pathway" title="wikilink">octadecanoid pathway</a> and jasmonic acid activates defensive genes.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> Production of methyl jasmonate is induced by systemins and also upregulates systemin precursor genes creating a feedback loop, amplifying the defensive signal. Methyl jasmonate is volatile and can therefore activate <a href="systemic_acquired_resistance" title="wikilink">systemic acquired resistance</a> in neighbouring plants, preparing their defences for attack. These signalling events are analogous to the <a href="cytokine" class="uri" title="wikilink">cytokine</a>-mediated <a href="inflammation" title="wikilink">inflammatory immune response</a> in animals. When the inflammatory response is activated in animals, MAPKs are activated which in turn activate phospholipases. Lipids in the membrane are converted to <a href="arachidonic_acid" title="wikilink">arachidonic acid</a> and then to <a href="prostaglandins" class="uri" title="wikilink">prostaglandins</a>, which are analogs of jasmonic acid.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> Both pathways can be inhibited by <a href="suramin" class="uri" title="wikilink">suramin</a>.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a></p>
<p>Early experiments with <a href="isotopic_labeling#Radioisotopic_labeling" title="wikilink">radiolabelled</a> systemin in tomato demonstrated that it is transported through the phloem sap in tomato plants and was therefore thought to be the systemic signal that activated systemic acquired resistance.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a> This view was challenged by grafting experiments which showed that mutants deficient in jasmonic acid biosynthesis and perception were unable to activate systemic acquired resistance.

<p>Tomato plants over-expressing systemin also accumulated HypSys but did not if the systemin precursor was silenced, indicating that in tomato, HypSys is controlled by systemin. Each of the three HypSys peptides in tomato is able to activate the synthesis and accumulation of protease inhibitors.<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a> When HypSys is silenced the production of protease inhibitors induced by wounding is halved compared to wild type plants indicating that both systemin and HypSys are required for a strong defence response against herbivores in tomato.<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a></p>
<p>When applied through cut <a href="petiole" title="wikilink">petioles</a> in <a href="petunia" class="uri" title="wikilink">petunia</a>, HypSys did not induce the production of protease inhibitors, but instead increased expression of <a href="defensin" class="uri" title="wikilink">defensin</a>, a gene which produces a protein that inserts into microbial membranes, forming a pore.<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a> Defensin expression is also induced by AtPEP1.<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a></p>
<p>Tomato plants over-expressing systemin produced more <a href="volatile_organic_compound" title="wikilink">volatile organic compounds</a> (VOCs) when wounded than normal plants and <a href="parasitoid_wasp" title="wikilink">parasitoid wasps</a> find them more attractive, predating more insects. This demonstrates that systemin upregulates the expression of genes involved in the production of VOCs. Such a response is crucial if antinutritional defences are to be effective, since without predators, developing insects would consume more plant material while completing their development.<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a> It is likely that VOC production is upregulated through the <a href="oxylipin" class="uri" title="wikilink">oxylipin</a> pathway that synthesises jasmonic acid and other volatile <a href="aldehyde" title="wikilink">aldehydes</a> and <a href="alcohol" title="wikilink">alcohols</a> that function in wound healing.<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a></p>

<p>Silencing systemin did not affect the ability of black nightshade to resist <a href="herbivory" class="uri" title="wikilink">herbivory</a> and, when competing against normal plants, silenced plants produced more above-ground biomass and berries. Upon herbivory, systemin was down-regulated in black nightshade in contrast to the other peptides which are up-regulated after herbivory.<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a> By contrast HypSys were up-regulated and activated the synthesis of protease inhibitors.<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a> The down-regulation of systemin was associated with increased root mass but did not decrease shoot mass, demonstrating that systemin can cause developmental changes as a result of herbivory, allowing the plant to tolerate, rather than directly resist attack. Tomato roots were also affected by tomato systemin, with root growth increasing at high tomato systemin concentrations. By allocating more resources to the roots, plants under attack are thought to store carbon and then use it to re-grow when the attack ends.<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a> Overexpressing <em>AtPEP1</em> also increased root and shoot biomass in <em>A. thaliana</em>.<a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="abiotic-stress-resistance">Abiotic stress resistance</h3>
<p>Overexpression of systemin and HypSys has been found to improve plants' resistance to abiotic stresses including salt stress and UV radiation.<a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a> When systemin was over-expressed in tomato, transgenic plants had lower <a href="stomata" title="wikilink">stomatal</a> conductance than normal plants. When grown in salt solutions, transgenic plants had higher stomatal conductances, lower leaf concentrations of <a href="abscisic_acid" title="wikilink">abscisic acid</a> and <a href="proline" class="uri" title="wikilink">proline</a> and a higher biomass. These findings suggest that the over-expression of systemin either allowed the plants to adapt to salt stress more efficiently or that they perceived a less stressful environment.<a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a> Similarly, wounded tomato plants were less susceptible to salt stress than unwounded plants. This may be because wounding decreases the growth of the plant and therefore slows the uptake of toxic ions into the roots.<a href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a> An analysis of salt-induced changes in gene expression found that the differences measured between the transgenic and normal plants could not be accounted for by changes in conventional salt stress-induced pathways. Instead Orsini <em>et al.</em> proposed that jasmonic acid may be responsible by activating defence responses which include the plant minimising water loss and diverting pathways away from producing <a href="compatible_solute" title="wikilink">compatible solutes</a> towards defensive compounds.<a href="#fn67" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a></p>
<p>Plants grown under <a href="UVB" class="uri" title="wikilink">UVB</a> light are more resistant to insect herbivory compared with plants grown under filters that exclude the radiation. When tomato plants are exposed to a pulse of UVB radiation and then weakly wounded, PIs accumulate throughout the plant. By themselves, neither the radiation nor weak wounding is sufficient to induce systemic PI accumulation. Tomato cell cultures respond similarly, with systemin and UVB acting together to activate MAPKs. Short pulses of UVB also cause alkalisation of the culturing medium.<a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="development">Development</h3>
<p>In <em><a href="Nicotiana_attenuata" title="wikilink">Nicotiana attenuata</a></em> HypSys is known to not be involved in defence against insect herbivores. Silencing and over-expression of HypSys does not affect the feeding performance of larvae compared to normal plants.<a href="#fn69" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref69"><sup>69</sup></a> Berger silenced HypSys and found that it caused changes in <a href="Flower#Morphology" title="wikilink">flower morphology</a> which reduced the efficiency of <a href="self-pollination" class="uri" title="wikilink">self-pollination</a>. The flowers had <a href="pistil" title="wikilink">pistils</a> that protruded beyond their <a href="anther" title="wikilink">anthers</a>, a similar phenotype to CORONATINE-INSENSITIVE1-silenced plants which lack a jasmonate receptor. Measurement of jasmonate levels in the flowers revealed that they were lower than in normal plants. The authors suggested that HypSys peptides in <em>N. attenuata</em> have diversified from their function as defence related peptides to being involved in controlling flower morphology. The signalling processes remain similar however, being mediated through jasmonates.<a href="#fn70" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a></p>
<p>Systemin also increases root growth in <em><a href="Solanum_pimpinellifolium" title="wikilink">Solanum pimpinellifolium</a></em> suggesting that it may also play some role in <a href="Plant_development#Plant_development" title="wikilink">plant development</a> .<a href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a></p>
