It is named after the <a href="House_of_Bruce" title="wikilink">House of Bruce</a> who formerly owned the land on which it is built. Believed to lie on the site of an earlier building, about which little is known, the current house is one of the oldest surviving English <a href="brick" class="uri" title="wikilink">brick</a> houses. It was remodelled in the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries.</p>

<p>The name <em>Bruce Castle</em> is derived from the <a href="House_of_Bruce" title="wikilink">House of Bruce</a>, who had historically owned a third of the <a href="manorialism" title="wikilink">manor</a> of Tottenham. However, there was no castle in the area, and it is unlikely that the family lived nearby.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> Upon his accession to <a href="King_of_Scots" title="wikilink">the Scottish throne</a>, <a href="Robert_I_of_Scotland" title="wikilink">Robert I of Scotland</a> forfeited his lands in England, including the Bruce holdings in Tottenham,<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> ending the connection between the Bruce family and the area.

<p>The principal facade of the Grade I mansion has been substantially remodelled over time. The house is constructed of red brick with <a href="ashlar" class="uri" title="wikilink">ashlar</a> <a href="Quoin_(architecture)" title="wikilink">quoining</a> and the principal facade, terminated by symmetrical matching bays, has tall paned windows.

<p>Henry Hare (1635&lt;U+2013&gt;1708) settled at the Lordship House, renaming it Bruce Castle in honour of the area's historic connection with the <a href="House_of_Bruce" title="wikilink">House of Bruce</a>.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> Hare was a noted historian and author of the first history of Tottenham. He grew up at the Hare family house at Totteridge, and it is not known when he moved to Tottenham. At the time of the birth of his first child, Hugh, in 1668, the family were still living in Totteridge, while by the time of the death of his first wife Constantia, in 1680, the family were living in Bruce Castle.

<li id="fn2">As with most other English maps of the period, the map is aligned south-north (i.e. &quot;upside down&quot; when compared to modern maps).

The large field opposite the house (marked &quot;Lease&quot;) is the northeast corner of the water-meadow which became <a href="Broadwater_Farm" title="wikilink">Broadwater Farm</a>. The fields to the east of Church Lane are the present Bruce Castle Park, while those to the west surrounding the church now form part of <a href="Tottenham#Sites_or_buildings_of_historical_interest" title="wikilink">Tottenham Cemetery</a>.<br />
