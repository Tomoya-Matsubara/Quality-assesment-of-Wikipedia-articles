<p><strong>John</strong> (24 December 1166 &lt;U+2013&gt; 18/19 October 1216), also known as <strong>John Lackland</strong> (<a href="Anglo-Norman_language" title="wikilink">Norman French</a>: <em>Johan sanz Terre</em>),<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> was <a href="List_of_English_monarchs" title="wikilink">King of England</a> from 6 April 1199 until his death in 1216. Following the <a href="battle_of_Bouvines" title="wikilink">battle of Bouvines</a>, John lost the <a href="duchy_of_Normandy" title="wikilink">duchy of Normandy</a> to King <a href="Philip_II_of_France" title="wikilink">Philip II of France</a>, which resulted in the collapse of most of the <a href="Angevin_Empire" title="wikilink">Angevin Empire</a> and contributed to the subsequent growth in power of the <a href="Capetian_dynasty" title="wikilink">Capetian dynasty</a> during the 13th century. The <a href="First_Barons&#39;_War" title="wikilink">baronial revolt</a> at the end of John's reign led to the sealing of the <em><a href="Magna_Carta" title="wikilink">Magna Carta</a></em>, a document sometimes considered to be an early step in the evolution of the <a href="constitution_of_the_United_Kingdom" title="wikilink">constitution of the United Kingdom</a>.</p>
<p>John, the youngest of five sons of King <a href="Henry_II_of_England" title="wikilink">Henry II of England</a> and <a href="Eleanor_of_Aquitaine" title="wikilink">Eleanor of Aquitaine</a>, was at first not expected to inherit significant lands. Following the failed rebellion of his elder brothers between 1173 and 1174, however, John became Henry's favourite child. He was appointed the <a href="Lord_of_Ireland" title="wikilink">Lord of Ireland</a> in 1177 and given lands in England and on the continent. John's elder brothers <a href="William_IX,_Count_of_Poitiers" title="wikilink">William</a>, <a href="Henry_the_Young_King" title="wikilink">Henry</a> and <a href="Geoffrey_II,_Duke_of_Brittany" title="wikilink">Geoffrey</a> died young; by the time <a href="Richard_I_of_England" title="wikilink">Richard I</a> became king in 1189, John was a potential heir to the throne. John unsuccessfully attempted a rebellion against Richard's royal administrators whilst his brother was participating in the <a href="Third_Crusade" title="wikilink">Third Crusade</a>. Despite this, after Richard died in 1199, John was proclaimed King of England, and came to an agreement with Philip II of France to recognise John's possession of the continental Angevin lands at the peace <a href="treaty_of_Le_Goulet" title="wikilink">treaty of Le Goulet</a> in 1200.</p>
<p>When war with France broke out again in 1202, John achieved early victories, but shortages of military resources and his treatment of <a href="Normans" title="wikilink">Norman</a>, <a href="Breton_people" title="wikilink">Breton</a> and <a href="Anjou" class="uri" title="wikilink">Anjou</a> nobles resulted in the collapse of his empire in northern France in 1204. John spent much of the next decade attempting to regain these lands, raising huge revenues, reforming his armed forces and rebuilding continental alliances. John's judicial reforms had a lasting impact on the English common law system, as well as providing an additional source of revenue. An argument with <a href="Pope_Innocent_III" title="wikilink">Pope Innocent III</a> led to John's <a href="excommunication" class="uri" title="wikilink">excommunication</a> in 1209, a dispute finally settled by the king in 1213. John's attempt to defeat Philip in 1214 failed due to the French victory over John's allies at the <a href="battle_of_Bouvines" title="wikilink">battle of Bouvines</a>. When he returned to England, John faced a rebellion by many of his barons, who were unhappy with his fiscal policies and his treatment of many of England's most powerful nobles. Although both John and the barons agreed to the <em>Magna Carta</em> peace treaty in 1215, neither side complied with its conditions. <a href="First_Barons&#39;_War" title="wikilink">Civil war</a> broke out shortly afterwards, with the barons aided by <a href="Louis_VIII_of_France" title="wikilink">Louis of France</a>. It soon descended into a stalemate. John died of <a href="dysentery" class="uri" title="wikilink">dysentery</a> contracted whilst on campaign in eastern England during late 1216; supporters of his son <a href="Henry_III_of_England" title="wikilink">Henry III</a> went on to achieve victory over Louis and the rebel barons the following year.</p>
<p>Contemporary chroniclers were mostly critical of John's performance as king, and his reign has since been the subject of significant debate and periodic revision by historians from the 16th century onwards. Historian <a href="Jim_Bradbury" title="wikilink">Jim Bradbury</a> has summarised the contemporary historical opinion of John's positive qualities, observing that John is today usually considered a &quot;hard-working administrator, an able man, an able general&quot;.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> Nonetheless, modern historians agree that he also had many faults as king, including what historian Ralph Turner describes as &quot;distasteful, even dangerous personality traits&quot;, such as pettiness, spitefulness and cruelty.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> These negative qualities provided extensive material for fiction writers in the <a href="Victorian_literature" title="wikilink">Victorian era</a>, and John remains a recurring character within Western popular culture, primarily as a villain in films and stories depicting the <a href="Robin_Hood" title="wikilink">Robin Hood</a> legends.</p>

<p>John was born to <a href="Henry_II_of_England" title="wikilink">Henry II of England</a> and <a href="Eleanor_of_Aquitaine" title="wikilink">Eleanor of Aquitaine</a> on 24 December 1166.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> Henry had inherited significant territories along the Atlantic seaboard&lt;U+2014&gt;<a href="Anjou" class="uri" title="wikilink">Anjou</a>, <a href="Normandy" class="uri" title="wikilink">Normandy</a> and <a href="England" class="uri" title="wikilink">England</a>&lt;U+2014&gt;and expanded his empire by conquering <a href="Brittany" class="uri" title="wikilink">Brittany</a>.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> Henry married the powerful Eleanor of Aquitaine, who reigned over the <a href="Duchy_of_Aquitaine" title="wikilink">Duchy of Aquitaine</a> and had a tenuous claim to <a href="History_of_Toulouse#12th_century" title="wikilink">Toulouse</a> and <a href="Auvergne_(province)" title="wikilink">Auvergne</a> in southern France, in addition to being the former wife of <a href="Louis_VII_of_France" title="wikilink">Louis VII of France</a>.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> The result was the <a href="Angevin_Empire" title="wikilink">Angevin Empire</a>, named after Henry's paternal title as Count of Anjou and, more specifically, its seat in <a href="Angers" class="uri" title="wikilink">Angers</a>.{{#tag:ref|The term <a href="Angevin_Empire" title="wikilink">Angevin Empire</a> originates with Victorian historian <a href="Kate_Norgate" title="wikilink">Kate Norgate</a>.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a>|group=&quot;nb&quot;}} The Empire, however, was inherently fragile: although all the lands owed allegiance to Henry, the disparate parts each had their own histories, traditions and governance structures.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> As one moved south through Anjou and Aquitaine, the extent of Henry's power in the provinces diminished considerably, scarcely resembling the modern concept of an empire at all. Some of the traditional ties between parts of the empire such as Normandy and England were slowly dissolving over time.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> It was unclear what would happen to the empire on Henry's death. Although the custom of <a href="primogeniture" class="uri" title="wikilink">primogeniture</a>, under which an eldest son would inherit all his father's lands, was slowly becoming more widespread across Europe, it was less popular amongst the Norman kings of England.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> Most believed that Henry would divide the empire, giving each son a substantial portion, and hoping that his children would continue to work together as allies after his death.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> To complicate matters, much of the Angevin empire was held by Henry only as a vassal of the King of France of the rival line of the <a href="House_of_Capet" title="wikilink">House of Capet</a>. Henry had often allied himself with the <a href="Holy_Roman_Emperor" title="wikilink">Holy Roman Emperor</a> against France, making the feudal relationship even more challenging.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<p>Shortly after his birth, John was passed from Eleanor into the care of a <a href="wet_nurse" title="wikilink">wet nurse</a>, a traditional practice for medieval noble families.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> Eleanor then left for <a href="Poitiers" class="uri" title="wikilink">Poitiers</a>, the capital of Aquitaine, and sent John and his sister <a href="Joan_of_England,_Queen_of_Sicily" title="wikilink">Joan</a> north to <a href="Fontevrault_Abbey" title="wikilink">Fontevrault Abbey</a>.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> This may have been done with the aim of steering her youngest son, with no obvious inheritance, towards a future ecclesiastical career.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> Eleanor spent the next few years conspiring against her husband Henry and neither parent played a part in John's very early life.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> John was probably, like his brothers, assigned a <em>magister</em> whilst he was at Fontevrault, a teacher charged with his early education and with managing the servants of his immediate household; John was later taught by Ranulph Glanville, a leading English administrator.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> John spent some time as a member of the household of his eldest living brother <a href="Henry_the_Young_King" title="wikilink">Henry the Young King</a>, where he probably received instruction in hunting and military skills.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
<p>John grew up to be around 5 ft 5 in (1.68 m) tall, relatively short, with a &quot;powerful, barrel-chested body&quot; and dark red hair; he looked to contemporaries like an inhabitant of <a href="Poitou" class="uri" title="wikilink">Poitou</a>.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> John enjoyed reading and, unusually for the period, built up a travelling library of books.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> He enjoyed gambling, in particular at <a href="backgammon" class="uri" title="wikilink">backgammon</a>, and was an enthusiastic hunter, even by medieval standards.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> He liked music, although not songs.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> John would become a &quot;connoisseur of jewels&quot;, building up a large collection, and became famous for his opulent clothes and also, according to French chroniclers, for his fondness for bad wine.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> As John grew up, he became known for sometimes being &quot;genial, witty, generous and hospitable&quot;; at other moments, he could be jealous, over-sensitive and prone to fits of rage, &quot;biting and gnawing his fingers&quot; in anger.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a>{{#tag:ref|<a href="Henry_II_of_England" title="wikilink">Henry II</a> also bit and gnawed his fingers; extreme rage is considered by many historians to be a trait of the Angevin kings.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a>|group=&quot;nb&quot;}}</p>

<p><img src="Eleonora_Jindra2.jpg" title="fig:John&#39;s parents, Henry II and Eleanor, holding court" alt="John&#39;s parents, Henry II and Eleanor, holding court" /> During John's early years, Henry attempted to resolve the question of his succession. Henry the Young King had been crowned King of England in 1170, but was not given any formal powers by his father; he was also promised Normandy and Anjou as part of his future inheritance. <a href="Richard_I_of_England" title="wikilink">Richard</a> was to be appointed the Count of Poitou with control of Aquitaine, whilst <a href="Geoffrey_II,_Duke_of_Brittany" title="wikilink">Geoffrey</a> was to become the Duke of Brittany.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> At this time it seemed unlikely that John would ever inherit substantial lands, and he was jokingly nicknamed &quot;Lackland&quot; by his father.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a></p>
<p>Henry II wanted to secure the southern borders of Aquitaine and decided to betroth his youngest son to Alais, the daughter and heiress of <a href="Humbert_III_of_Savoy" title="wikilink">Humbert III of Savoy</a>.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> As part of this agreement John was promised the future inheritance of <a href="Savoy" class="uri" title="wikilink">Savoy</a>, <a href="Piedmont" title="wikilink">Piemonte</a>, <a href="Maurienne" class="uri" title="wikilink">Maurienne</a>, and the other possessions of Count Humbert.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> For his part in the potential marriage alliance, Henry II transferred the castles of <a href="Ch&lt;U+00E2&gt;teau_de_Chinon" title="wikilink">Chinon</a>, <a href="Loudun" class="uri" title="wikilink">Loudun</a> and <a href="Mirebeau" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mirebeau</a> into John's name; as John was only five years old his father would continue to control them for practical purposes.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> Henry the Young King was unimpressed by this; although he had yet to be granted control of any castles in his new kingdom, these were effectively his future property and had been given away without consultation.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> Alais made the trip over the Alps and joined Henry II's court, but she died before marrying John, which left the prince once again without an inheritance.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1173 John's elder brothers, backed by Eleanor, rose in revolt against Henry in the short-lived <a href="Revolt_of_1173&lt;U+2013&gt;1174" title="wikilink">rebellion of 1173 to 1174</a>. Growing irritated with his subordinate position to Henry II and increasingly worried that John might be given additional lands and castles at his expense,<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> Henry the Young King travelled to <a href="Paris" class="uri" title="wikilink">Paris</a> and allied himself with <a href="Louis_VII_of_France" title="wikilink">Louis VII</a>.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> Eleanor, irritated by her husband's persistent interference in Aquitaine, encouraged Richard and Geoffrey to join their brother Henry in Paris.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> Henry II triumphed over the coalition of his sons, but was generous to them in the peace settlement agreed at <a href="Montlouis-sur-Loire" title="wikilink">Montlouis</a>.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> Henry the Young King was allowed to travel widely in Europe with his own household of knights, Richard was given Aquitaine back, and Geoffrey was allowed to return to Brittany; only Eleanor was imprisoned for her role in the revolt.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a></p>
<p>John had spent the conflict travelling alongside his father, and was given widespread possessions across the Angevin empire as part of the Montlouis settlement; from then onwards, most observers regarded John as Henry II's favourite child, although he was the furthest removed in terms of the royal succession.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> Henry II began to find more lands for John, mostly at various nobles' expense. In 1175 he appropriated the estates of the late <a href="Reginald_de_Dunstanville,_1st_Earl_of_Cornwall" title="wikilink">Earl of Cornwall</a> and gave them to John.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> The following year, Henry disinherited the sisters of <a href="Isabel,_Countess_of_Gloucester" title="wikilink">Isabelle of Gloucester</a>, contrary to legal custom, and betrothed John to the now extremely wealthy Isabelle.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> In 1177, at the Council of Oxford, Henry dismissed <a href="William_FitzAldelm" title="wikilink">William FitzAldelm</a> as the <a href="Lordship_of_Ireland" title="wikilink">Lord of Ireland</a> and replaced him with the ten-year-old John.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a></p>

<p>In 1185 John made his <a href="John&#39;s_first_expedition_to_Ireland" title="wikilink">first visit to Ireland</a>, accompanied by 300 knights and a team of administrators.<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a> Henry had tried to have John officially proclaimed King of Ireland, but Pope <a href="Lucius_III" title="wikilink">Lucius III</a> would not agree.<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a> John's first period of rule in Ireland was not a success.

<p>The problems amongst John's wider family continued to grow.

<p>When John's elder brother Richard became king in September 1189, he had already declared his intention of joining the <a href="Third_Crusade" title="wikilink">Third Crusade</a>.<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a> Richard set about raising the huge sums of money required for this expedition through the sale of lands, titles and appointments, and attempted to ensure that he would not face a revolt while away from his empire.<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a> John was made <a href="List_of_Counts_of_Mortain" title="wikilink">Count of Mortain</a>, was married to the wealthy <a href="Isabel,_Countess_of_Gloucester" title="wikilink">Isabel of Gloucester</a>, and was given valuable lands in Lancaster and the counties of <a href="Cornwall" class="uri" title="wikilink">Cornwall</a>, <a href="Derby" class="uri" title="wikilink">Derby</a>, <a href="Devon" class="uri" title="wikilink">Devon</a>, <a href="Dorset" class="uri" title="wikilink">Dorset</a>, <a href="Nottingham" class="uri" title="wikilink">Nottingham</a> and <a href="Somerset" class="uri" title="wikilink">Somerset</a>, all with the aim of buying his loyalty to Richard whilst the king was on crusade.<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a> Richard retained royal control of key castles in these counties, thereby preventing John from accumulating too much military and political power, and, for the time being, the king named the four-year-old Arthur of Brittany as the heir to the throne.<a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a> In return, John promised not to visit England for the next three years, thereby in theory giving Richard adequate time to conduct a successful crusade and return from the <a href="Levant" class="uri" title="wikilink">Levant</a> without fear of John seizing power.<a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a> Richard left political authority in England &lt;U+2013&gt; the post of justiciar &lt;U+2013&gt; jointly in the hands of Bishop <a href="Hugh_de_Puiset" title="wikilink">Hugh de Puiset</a> and <a href="William_de_Mandeville,_3rd_Earl_of_Essex" title="wikilink">William Mandeville</a>, and made <a href="William_Longchamp" title="wikilink">William Longchamp</a>, the <a href="Bishop_of_Ely" title="wikilink">Bishop of Ely</a>, his chancellor.<a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a> Mandeville immediately died, and Longchamp took over as joint justiciar with Puiset, which would prove to be a less than satisfactory partnership.<a href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a> Eleanor, the queen mother, convinced Richard to allow John into England in his absence.<a href="#fn67" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a></p>

<p>John inherited a sophisticated system of administration in England, with a range of royal agents answering to the Royal Household: the <a href="Chancery_(medieval_office)#In_England" title="wikilink">Chancery</a> kept written records and communications; the Treasury and the <a href="Exchequer" class="uri" title="wikilink">Exchequer</a> dealt with income and expenditure respectively; and various judges were deployed to deliver justice around the kingdom.<a href="#fn159" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref159"><sup>159</sup></a> Thanks to the efforts of men like <a href="Hubert_Walter" title="wikilink">Hubert Walter</a>, this trend towards improved record keeping continued into his reign.<a href="#fn160" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref160"><sup>160</sup></a> Like previous kings, John managed a <a href="wikt:peripatetic" title="wikilink">peripatetic</a> court that travelled around the kingdom, dealing with both local and national matters as he went.<a href="#fn161" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref161"><sup>161</sup></a> John was very active in the administration of England and was involved in every aspect of government.<a href="#fn162" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref162"><sup>162</sup></a> In part he was following in the tradition of <a href="Henry_I_of_England" title="wikilink">Henry I</a> and Henry II, but by the 13th century the volume of administrative work had greatly increased, which put much more pressure on a king who wished to rule in this style.<a href="#fn163" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref163"><sup>163</sup></a> John was in England for much longer periods than his predecessors, which made his rule more personal than that of previous kings, particularly in previously ignored areas such as the north.<a href="#fn164" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref164"><sup>164</sup></a></p>

<p>One of John's principal challenges was acquiring the large sums of money needed for his proposed campaigns to reclaim Normandy.<a href="#fn174" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref174"><sup>174</sup></a> The Angevin kings had three main sources of income available to them, namely revenue from their personal lands, or <em><a href="demesne" class="uri" title="wikilink">demesne</a></em>; money raised through their rights as a feudal lord; and revenue from taxation. Revenue from the royal demesne was inflexible and had been diminishing slowly since the <a href="Norman_conquest_of_England" title="wikilink">Norman conquest</a>. Matters were not helped by Richard's sale of many royal properties in 1189, and taxation played a much smaller role in royal income than in later centuries. English kings had widespread feudal rights which could be used to generate income, including the <a href="scutage" class="uri" title="wikilink">scutage</a> system, in which feudal military service was avoided by a cash payment to the king. He derived income from fines, court fees and the sale of <a href="charter" title="wikilink">charters</a> and other privileges.<a href="#fn175" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref175"><sup>175</sup></a> John intensified his efforts to maximise all possible sources of income, to the extent that he has been described as &quot;avaricious, miserly, extortionate and moneyminded&quot;.<a href="#fn176" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref176"><sup>176</sup></a> John also used revenue generation as a way of exerting political control over the barons: debts owed to the crown by the king's favoured supporters might be forgiven; collection of those owed by enemies was more stringently enforced.</p>

One group was the <em>familiares regis</em>, John's immediate friends and knights who travelled around the country with him. They also played an important role in organising and leading military campaigns.<a href="#fn194" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref194"><sup>194</sup></a> Another section of royal followers were the <em><a href="curia_regis" title="wikilink">curia regis</a></em>; these <em>curiales</em> were the senior officials and agents of the king and were essential to his day-to-day rule.<a href="#fn195" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref195"><sup>195</sup></a> Being a member of these inner circles brought huge advantages, as it was easier to gain favours from the king, file lawsuits, marry a wealthy heiress or have one's debts remitted.<a href="#fn196" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref196"><sup>196</sup></a> By the time of Henry II, these posts were increasingly being filled by &quot;new men&quot; from outside the normal ranks of the barons.

<p>In 1214 John began his final campaign to reclaim Normandy from Philip. John was optimistic, as he had successfully built up alliances with the Emperor Otto, Renaud of Boulogne and Count Ferdinand of Flanders; he was enjoying papal favour; and he had successfully built up substantial funds to pay for the deployment of his experienced army.<a href="#fn318" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref318"><sup>318</sup></a> Nonetheless, when John left for Poitou in February 1214, many barons refused to provide military service; mercenary knights had to fill the gaps.<a href="#fn319" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref319"><sup>319</sup></a> John's plan was to split Philip's forces by pushing north-east from Poitou towards Paris, whilst Otto, Renaud and Ferdinand, supported by <a href="William_Longesp&lt;U+00E9&gt;e,_3rd_Earl_of_Salisbury" title="wikilink">William Longesp&lt;U+00E9&gt;e</a>, marched south-west from Flanders.<a href="#fn320" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref320"><sup>320</sup></a></p>
<p>The first part of the campaign went well, with John outmanoeuvring the forces under the command of Prince <a href="Louis_VIII_of_France" title="wikilink">Louis</a> and retaking the county of Anjou by the end of June.<a href="#fn321" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref321"><sup>321</sup></a> John besieged the castle of <a href="Roche-au-Moine" class="uri" title="wikilink">Roche-au-Moine</a>, a key stronghold, forcing Louis to give battle against John's larger army.<a href="#fn322" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref322"><sup>322</sup></a> The local Angevin nobles refused to advance with the king; left at something of a disadvantage, John retreated back to <a href="La_Rochelle" title="wikilink">La Rochelle</a>.<a href="#fn323" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref323"><sup>323</sup></a> Shortly afterwards, Philip won the hard-fought <a href="battle_of_Bouvines" title="wikilink">battle of Bouvines</a> in the east against Otto and John's other allies, bringing an end to John's hopes of retaking Normandy.<a href="#fn324" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref324"><sup>324</sup></a> A peace agreement was signed in which John returned Anjou to Philip and paid the French king compensation; the truce was intended to last for six years.<a href="#fn325" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref325"><sup>325</sup></a> John arrived back in England in October.<a href="#fn326" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref326"><sup>326</sup></a></p>

<p>John's campaign started well. In November John retook Rochester Castle from rebel baron <a href="William_d&#39;Aubigny_(rebel)" title="wikilink">William d'Aubigny</a> in a sophisticated assault.

<p><img src="Foxe&#39;s_Book_of_Martyrs_title_page.jpg" title="fig:John Foxe&#39;s Book of Martyrs, officially titled Acts and Monuments, which took a positive view of John&#39;s reign" alt="John Foxe&#39;s Book of Martyrs, officially titled Acts and Monuments, which took a positive view of John&#39;s reign" /> By the Victorian period in the 19th century historians were more inclined to draw on the judgements of the chroniclers and to focus on John's moral personality. <a href="Kate_Norgate" title="wikilink">Kate Norgate</a>, for example, argued that John's downfall had been due not to his failure in war or strategy, but due to his &quot;almost superhuman wickedness&quot;, whilst James Ramsay blamed John's family background and his cruel personality for his downfall.<a href="#fn397" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref397"><sup>397</sup></a> Historians in the &quot;<a href="Whig_history" title="wikilink">Whiggish</a>&quot; tradition, focusing on documents such as the <a href="Domesday_Book" title="wikilink">Domesday Book</a> and <em><a href="Magna_Carta" title="wikilink">Magna Carta</a></em>, trace a progressive and <a href="Universalism" title="wikilink">universalist</a> course of political and economic development in England over the medieval period.<a href="#fn398" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref398"><sup>398</sup></a> These historians were often inclined to see John's reign, and his signing of <em>Magna Carta</em> in particular, as a positive step in the constitutional development of England, despite the flaws of the king himself.<a href="#fn399" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref399"><sup>399</sup></a> <a href="Winston_Churchill" title="wikilink">Winston Churchill</a>, for example, argued that &quot;[w]hen the long tally is added, it will be seen that the British nation and the English-speaking world owe far more to the vices of John than to the labours of virtuous sovereigns&quot;.<a href="#fn400" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref400"><sup>400</sup></a></p>
<p>In the 1940s, new interpretations of John's reign began to emerge, based on research into the record evidence of his reign, such as <a href="pipe_roll" title="wikilink">pipe rolls</a>, charters, court documents and similar primary records. Notably, an essay by <a href="Vivian_Hunter_Galbraith" title="wikilink">Vivian Galbraith</a> in 1945 proposed a &quot;new approach&quot; to understanding the ruler.<a href="#fn401" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref401"><sup>401</sup></a> The use of recorded evidence was combined with an increased scepticism about two of the most colourful chroniclers of John's reign, Roger of Wendover and Matthew Paris.<a href="#fn402" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref402"><sup>402</sup></a> In many cases the detail provided by these chroniclers, both writing after John's death, was challenged by modern historians.<a href="#fn403" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref403"><sup>403</sup></a> Interpretations of <em>Magna Carta</em> and the role of the rebel barons in 1215 have been significantly revised: although the charter's symbolic, constitutional value for later generations is unquestionable, in the context of John's reign most historians now consider it a failed peace agreement between &quot;partisan&quot; factions.<a href="#fn404" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref404"><sup>404</sup></a> There has been increasing debate about the nature of John's Irish policies. Specialists in Irish medieval history, such as Sean Duffy, have challenged the conventional narrative established by <a href="W._L._Warren" title="wikilink">Lewis Warren</a>, suggesting that Ireland was less stable by 1216 than was previously supposed.<a href="#fn405" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref405"><sup>405</sup></a></p>
<p>Most historians today, including John's recent biographers Ralph Turner and Lewis Warren, argue that John was an unsuccessful monarch, but note that his failings were exaggerated by 12th- and 13th-century chroniclers.<a href="#fn406" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref406"><sup>406</sup></a> <a href="Jim_Bradbury" title="wikilink">Jim Bradbury</a> notes the consensus of contemporary historians that John was a &quot;hard-working administrator, an able man, an able general&quot;, albeit, as Turner suggests, with &quot;distasteful, even dangerous personality traits&quot;, including pettiness, spitefulness and cruelty.<a href="#fn407" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref407"><sup>407</sup></a> <a href="John_Gillingham" title="wikilink">John Gillingham</a>, author of a major biography of Richard I, follows this line too, although he considers John a less effective general than do Turner or Warren; Bradbury takes a moderate line, but suggests that in recent years modern historians have been overly lenient towards John's numerous faults.<a href="#fn408" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref408"><sup>408</sup></a> Popular historian <a href="Frank_McLynn" title="wikilink">Frank McLynn</a> maintains a counter-revisionist perspective on John, arguing that the king's modern reputation amongst historians is &quot;bizarre&quot;, and that as a monarch John &quot;fails almost all those [tests] that can be legitimately set&quot;.<a href="#fn409" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref409"><sup>409</sup></a></p>

<p><img src="FirstFolioKingJohn.jpg" title="fig:Shakespeare&#39;s play The Life and Death of King John" alt="Shakespeare&#39;s play The Life and Death of King John" /> Popular representations of John first began to emerge during the Tudor period, mirroring the revisionist histories of the time.<a href="#fn410" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref410"><sup>410</sup></a> The anonymous play <em><a href="The_Troublesome_Reign_of_King_John" title="wikilink">The Troublesome Reign of King John</a></em> portrayed the king as a &quot;proto-Protestant martyr&quot;, similar to that shown in <a href="John_Bale" title="wikilink">John Bale</a>'s morality play <em><a href="John_Bale#Kynge_Johan" title="wikilink">Kynge Johan</a></em>, in which John attempts to save England from the &quot;evil agents of the Roman Church&quot;.<a href="#fn411" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref411"><sup>411</sup></a> By contrast, Shakespeare's <em><a href="The_Life_and_Death_of_King_John" title="wikilink">King John</a></em>, a relatively anti-Catholic play that draws on <em>The Troublesome Reign</em> for its source material, offers a more &quot;balanced, dual view of a complex monarch as both a proto-Protestant victim of Rome's machinations and as a weak, selfishly motivated ruler&quot;.<a href="#fn412" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref412"><sup>412</sup></a> <a href="Anthony_Munday" title="wikilink">Anthony Munday</a>'s play <em><a href="The_Downfall_and_The_Death_of_Robert_Earl_of_Huntington" title="wikilink">The Downfall and The Death of Robert Earl of Huntington</a></em> portrays many of John's negative traits, but adopts a positive interpretation of the king's stand against the Roman Catholic Church, in line with the contemporary views of the Tudor monarchs.<a href="#fn413" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref413"><sup>413</sup></a> By the middle of the 17th century, plays such as <a href="Robert_Davenport" title="wikilink">Robert Davenport</a>'s <em><a href="King_John_and_Matilda" title="wikilink">King John and Matilda</a></em>, although based largely on the earlier Elizabethan works, were transferring the role of Protestant champion to the barons and focusing more on the tyrannical aspects of John's behaviour.<a href="#fn414" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref414"><sup>414</sup></a></p>
<p>Nineteenth-century fictional depictions of John were heavily influenced by Sir <a href="Walter_Scott" title="wikilink">Walter Scott</a>'s historical romance, <em><a href="Ivanhoe" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ivanhoe</a></em>, which presented &quot;an almost totally unfavourable picture&quot; of the king; the work drew on Victorian histories of the period and on Shakespeare's play.<a href="#fn415" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref415"><sup>415</sup></a> Scott's work influenced the late 19th-century children's writer <a href="Howard_Pyle" title="wikilink">Howard Pyle</a>'s book <em><a href="The_Merry_Adventures_of_Robin_Hood" title="wikilink">The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood</a></em>, which in turn established John as the principal villain within the traditional <a href="Robin_Hood" title="wikilink">Robin Hood</a> narrative.<a href="#fn416" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref416"><sup>416</sup></a> During the 20th century, John was normally depicted in fictional books and films alongside Robin Hood. <a href="Sam_De_Grasse" title="wikilink">Sam De Grasse</a>'s role as John in the black-and-white <a href="Robin_Hood_(1922_film)" title="wikilink">1922 film version</a> shows John committing numerous atrocities and acts of torture.<a href="#fn417" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref417"><sup>417</sup></a> <a href="Claude_Rains" title="wikilink">Claude Rains</a> played John in the <a href="The_Adventures_of_Robin_Hood_(film)" title="wikilink">1938 colour version</a> alongside <a href="Errol_Flynn" title="wikilink">Errol Flynn</a>, starting a trend for films to depict John as an &quot;effeminate ... arrogant and cowardly stay-at-home&quot;.<a href="#fn418" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref418"><sup>418</sup></a> The character of John acts either to highlight the virtues of King Richard, or contrasts with the <a href="Sheriff_of_Nottingham" title="wikilink">Sheriff of Nottingham</a>, who is usually the &quot;swashbuckling villain&quot; opposing Robin.<a href="#fn419" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref419"><sup>419</sup></a> An extreme version of this trend can be seen in the <a href="Robin_Hood_(1973_film)" title="wikilink">Disney cartoon version</a>, for example, which depicts John, voiced by <a href="Peter_Ustinov" title="wikilink">Peter Ustinov</a>, as a &quot;cowardly, thumbsucking lion&quot;.<a href="#fn420" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref420"><sup>420</sup></a> Popular works that depict John beyond the Robin Hood legends, such as <a href="James_Goldman" title="wikilink">James Goldman</a>'s play and later film, <em><a href="The_Lion_in_Winter" title="wikilink">The Lion in Winter</a></em>, set in 1183, commonly present him as an &quot;effete weakling&quot;, in this instance contrasted with the more masculine <a href="Henry_II_of_England" title="wikilink">Henry II</a>.<a href="#fn421" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref421"><sup>421</sup></a></p>
