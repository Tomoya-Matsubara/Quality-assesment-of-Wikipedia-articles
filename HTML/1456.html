<p>In his <em><a href="Dream_Pool_Essays" title="wikilink">Dream Pool Essays</a></em> (; <em>Mengxi Bitan</em>) of 1088, Shen was the first to describe the magnetic needle <a href="compass" class="uri" title="wikilink">compass</a>, which would be used for navigation (first described in Europe by <a href="Alexander_Neckam" title="wikilink">Alexander Neckam</a> in 1187).<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a><a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> Shen discovered the concept of <a href="true_north" title="wikilink">true north</a> in terms of <a href="magnetic_declination" title="wikilink">magnetic declination</a> towards the <a href="North_magnetic_pole" title="wikilink">north pole</a>,<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> with experimentation of suspended magnetic needles and &quot;the improved <a href="Meridian_(astronomy)" title="wikilink">meridian</a> determined by Shen's [astronomical] measurement of the distance between the <a href="polestar" class="uri" title="wikilink">polestar</a> and true north&quot;.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> This was the decisive step in human history to make compasses more useful for navigation, and may have been a concept unknown in Europe <a href="Voyages_of_Christopher_Columbus" title="wikilink">for another four hundred years</a> (evidence of German sundials made circa 1450 show markings similar to Chinese geomancer compasses in regards to declination).<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a><a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p>Alongside his colleague <a href="Wei_Pu" title="wikilink">Wei Pu</a>, Shen planned to map the orbital paths of the Moon and the planets in an intensive five-year project involving daily observations, yet this was thwarted by political opponents at court.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> To aid his work in astronomy, Shen Kuo made improved designs of the <a href="armillary_sphere" title="wikilink">armillary sphere</a>, <a href="gnomon" class="uri" title="wikilink">gnomon</a>, sighting tube, and invented a new type of inflow <a href="water_clock" title="wikilink">water clock</a>. Shen Kuo devised a <a href="geological" class="uri" title="wikilink">geological</a> hypothesis for land formation (<a href="geomorphology" class="uri" title="wikilink">geomorphology</a>), based upon findings of inland <a href="Marine_(ocean)" title="wikilink">marine</a> <a href="fossil" title="wikilink">fossils</a>, knowledge of <a href="soil_erosion" title="wikilink">soil erosion</a>, and the <a href="deposition_(geology)" title="wikilink">deposition</a> of <a href="silt" class="uri" title="wikilink">silt</a>.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> He also proposed a hypothesis of gradual <a href="climate_change" title="wikilink">climate change</a>, after observing ancient <a href="petrified" class="uri" title="wikilink">petrified</a> <a href="bamboo" title="wikilink">bamboos</a> that were preserved underground in a dry northern habitat that would not support bamboo growth in his time. He was the first literary figure in China to mention the use of the <a href="drydock" class="uri" title="wikilink">drydock</a> to repair boats suspended out of water, and also wrote of the effectiveness of the relatively new invention of the canal <a href="pound_lock" title="wikilink">pound lock</a>. Although <a href="Ibn_al-Haytham" title="wikilink">Ibn al-Haytham</a> (965&lt;U+2013&gt;1039) was the first to describe <a href="camera_obscura" title="wikilink">camera obscura</a>, Shen was the first in China to do so, several decades later.

His description of an ancient crossbow mechanism which he himself unearthed proved to be a <a href="Jacob&#39;s_staff" title="wikilink">Jacob's staff</a>, a <a href="surveying" class="uri" title="wikilink">surveying</a> tool which wasn't known in Europe until described by <a href="Levi_ben_Gerson" title="wikilink">Levi ben Gerson</a> in 1321.</p>
<p>Shen Kuo wrote several other books besides the <em>Dream Pool Essays</em>, yet much of the writing in his other books has not survived. Some of Shen's poetry was preserved in posthumous written works. Although much of his focus was on technical and scientific issues, he had an interest in <a href="divination" class="uri" title="wikilink">divination</a> and the supernatural, the latter including his vivid description of <a href="unidentified_flying_objects" title="wikilink">unidentified flying objects</a> from eyewitness testimony. He also wrote commentary on ancient <a href="Taoism" title="wikilink">Daoist</a> and <a href="Confucianism" title="wikilink">Confucian</a> texts.</p>

<p>Shen Kuo was born in Qiantang (modern-day <a href="Hangzhou" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hangzhou</a>) in the year 1031. His father Shen Zhou (; 978&lt;U+2013&gt;1052) was a somewhat lower-class <a href="Gentry_(China)" title="wikilink">gentry</a> figure serving in official posts on the provincial level; his mother was from a family of equal status in <a href="Suzhou" class="uri" title="wikilink">Suzhou</a>, with her maiden name being <a href="Xu" class="uri" title="wikilink">Xu</a> ().<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> Shen Kuo received his initial childhood education from his mother, which was a common practice in China during this period.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> She was very educated herself, teaching Kuo and his brother Pi () the military doctrines of her own elder brother Xu Tang (; 975&lt;U+2013&gt;1016).<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> Since Shen was unable to boast of a prominent familial clan history like many of his elite peers born in the north, he was forced to rely on his wit and stern determination to achieve in his studies to enter the challenging and sophisticated life of an <a href="Scholar-bureaucrat" title="wikilink">exam-drafted state bureaucrat</a>.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>

<p>Shen Zhou died in the late winter of 1051 (or early 1052), when his son Shen Kuo was 21 years old. Shen Kuo grieved for his father, and following <a href="Confucianism" title="wikilink">Confucian</a> ethics, remained inactive in a state of mourning for three years until 1054 (or early 1055).<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> As of 1054, Shen began serving in minor local governmental posts. However, his natural abilities to plan, organize, and design were proven early in life; one example is his design and supervision of the hydraulic drainage of an <a href="Levee" title="wikilink">embankment</a> system, <a href="land_reclamation" title="wikilink">which converted</a> some one hundred thousand <a href="acre" title="wikilink">acres</a> (400 km&lt;U+00B2&gt;) of <a href="swamp" title="wikilink">swampland</a> into prime <a href="farmland_(farming)" title="wikilink">farmland</a>.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> Shen Kuo noted that the success of the <a href="silt" class="uri" title="wikilink">silt</a> <a href="fertilization" class="uri" title="wikilink">fertilization</a> method relied upon the effective operation of <a href="sluice" class="uri" title="wikilink">sluice</a> gates of irrigation <a href="canal" title="wikilink">canals</a>.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a></p>

<p>In his career as a <a href="Scholar-bureaucrats" title="wikilink">scholar-official</a> for the central government, Shen Kuo was also an ambassador to the <a href="Western_Xia" title="wikilink">Western Xia</a> Dynasty and <a href="Liao_Dynasty" title="wikilink">Liao Dynasty</a>,<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> a military commander, a director of hydraulic works, and the leading chancellor of the <a href="Hanlin_Academy" title="wikilink">Hanlin Academy</a>.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> By 1072, Shen was appointed as the head official of the Bureau of Astronomy.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> With his leadership position in the bureau, Shen was responsible for projects in improving calendrical science,<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> and proposed many reforms to the <a href="Chinese_calendar" title="wikilink">Chinese calendar</a> alongside the work of his colleague <a href="Wei_Pu" title="wikilink">Wei Pu</a>.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> With his impressive skills and aptitude for matters of economy and finance, Shen was appointed as the Finance Commissioner at the central court.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a></p>
<p>As written by Li Zhiyi, a man married to Hu Wenrou (granddaughter of Hu Su, a famous minister of the Song Dynasty), Shen Kuo was Li's mentor while Shen served as an official.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> According to Li's epitaph for his wife, Shen would sometimes relay questions via Li to Hu when he needed clarification for his mathematical work, as Hu Wenrou was esteemed by Shen as a remarkable female mathematician.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> Shen lamented: &quot;if only she were a man, Wenrou would be my friend.&quot;<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a></p>
<p>While employed by the central government, Shen Kuo was also sent out with others to inspect the granary system of the empire, investigating problems of illegal collections, negligence, ineffective disaster relief, and inadequate water-conservancy projects.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> While Shen was appointed as the regional inspector of Zhejiang in 1073, the Emperor requested that Shen pay a visit to the famous poet <a href="Su_Shi" title="wikilink">Su Shi</a> (1037&lt;U+2013&gt;1101), then an administrator in Hangzhou.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> Shen took advantage of this meeting to copy some of Su's poetry, which he presented to the Emperor indicating that it expressed &quot;abusive and hateful&quot; speech against the Song court; these poems were later politicized by Li Ding and Shu Dan in order to level a court case against Su.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> With his demonstrations of loyalty and ability, Shen Kuo was awarded the honorary title of a State Foundation <a href="Viscount" class="uri" title="wikilink">Viscount</a> by <a href="Emperor_Shenzong_of_Song" title="wikilink">Emperor Shenzong of Song</a> (r. 1067&lt;U+2013&gt;1085), who placed a great amount of trust in Shen Kuo.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> He was even made 'companion to the heir apparent' (&lt;U+592A&gt;&lt;U+5B50&gt;&lt;U+4E2D&gt;&lt;U+5141&gt;; 'Taizi zhongyun').<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a></p>

<h3 id="dream-pool-essays">Dream Pool Essays</h3>

<p>Shen Kuo's <em>Dream Pool Essays</em> consists of some 507 separate essays exploring a wide range of subjects.<a href="#fn270" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref270"><sup>270</sup></a> It was Shen's ultimate attempt to comprehend and describe a multitude of various aspects of nature, science, and reality, and all the practical and profound curiosities found in the world. The literal translation of the title, <em>Dream Brook Brush Talks</em>, refers to his Dream Brook estate, where he spent the last years of his life. About the title, he is quoted as saying: &quot;Because I had only my writing brush and ink slab to converse with, I call it Brush Talks.&quot;</p>
<p>The book was originally 30 chapters long, yet an unknown Chinese author's edition of 1166 edited and reorganized the work into 26 chapters.<a href="#fn271" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref271"><sup>271</sup></a></p>

In 1075, Shen Kuo wrote the <em>Xining Fengyuan Li</em> (; <em>The Oblatory Epoch astronomical system of the Splendid Peace reign period</em>), which was lost, but listed in a 7th chapter of a Song Dynasty bibliography.<a href="#fn272" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref272"><sup>272</sup></a> This was the official report of Shen Kuo on his reforms of the Chinese calendar, which were only partially adopted by the Song court's official calendar system.<a href="#fn273" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref273"><sup>273</sup></a> Shen Kuo wrote a <a href="pharmaceutical" class="uri" title="wikilink">pharmaceutical</a> treatise known as the <em>Liang Fang</em> (; <em>Good medicinal formulas</em>), compiled sometime during his years of retirement from governmental service.<a href="#fn274" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref274"><sup>274</sup></a> Around the year 1126 it was combined into a written work of the famous <a href="Su_Shi" title="wikilink">Su Shi</a> (1037&lt;U+2013&gt;1101), who was ironically a political opponent to Shen Kuo's faction of Reformers and New Policies supporters at court,<a href="#fn275" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref275"><sup>275</sup></a> yet it was known that Shen Kuo and Su Shi were nonetheless friends and associates.<a href="#fn276" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref276"><sup>276</sup></a> Shen wrote the <em>Mengqi Wanghuai Lu</em> (; <em>Record of longings forgotten at Dream Brook</em>), which was also compiled during Shen's retirement. This book was a treatise in the working since his youth on rural life and ethnographic accounts of living conditions in the isolated mountain regions of China.<a href="#fn277" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref277"><sup>277</sup></a> Only quotations of it survive in the <em>Shuo Fu</em> () collection, which mostly describe the agricultural implements and tools used by rural people in high mountain regions. Shen Kuo also wrote the <em>Changxing Ji</em> (; <em>Collected Literary Works of [the Viscount of] Changxing</em>). However, this book was without much doubt a posthumous collection, including various poems, prose, and administrative documents written by Shen.<a href="#fn278" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref278"><sup>278</sup></a> By the 15th century (during the <a href="Ming_Dynasty" title="wikilink">Ming Dynasty</a>), this book was reprinted, yet only the 19th chapter remained.<a href="#fn279" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref279"><sup>279</sup></a> This chapter was reprinted in 1718, yet poorly edited.<a href="#fn280" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref280"><sup>280</sup></a> Finally, in the 1950s the author Hu Daojing supplemented this small yet valuable work with additions of other scattered poems written by Shen, in the former's <em>Collection of Shen Kua's Extant Poetry</em> (Shanghai: Shang-hai Shu-tian, 1958).<a href="#fn281" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref281"><sup>281</sup></a> In the tradition of the popular Song era literary category of 'travel record literature' ('youji wenxue'),<a href="#fn282" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref282"><sup>282</sup></a> Shen Kuo also wrote the <em>Register of What Not to Forget</em>, a <a href="travel_literature" title="wikilink">traveler's guide</a> to what type of <a href="carriage" class="uri" title="wikilink">carriage</a> is suitable for a journey, the proper foods one should bring, the special clothing one should bring, and many other items.<a href="#fn283" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref283"><sup>283</sup></a></p>
<p>In his <em>Sequel to Numerous Things Revealed</em>, the Song author Cheng Dachang (1123&lt;U+2013&gt;1195) noted that stanzas prepared by Shen Kuo for military victory celebrations were later written down and published by Shen.<a href="#fn284" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref284"><sup>284</sup></a> This includes a short poem &quot;Song of Triumph&quot; by Shen Kuo, who uses the musical instrument <em><a href="huqin" title="wikilink">mawei huqin</a></em> ('horse-tail barbarian stringed instrument' or 'horse-tail fiddle'<a href="#fn285" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref285"><sup>285</sup></a>) of the northwestern <a href="Inner_Asia" title="wikilink">Inner Asian</a> nomads as a metaphor for prisoners-of-war led by Song troops:</p>

<h3 id="praise-critique-and-criticism">Praise, critique, and criticism</h3>
<p>In the <em>Routledge Curzon Encyclopedia of Confucianism</em>, Xinzhong Yao states that Shen Kuo's legacy was tainted by his eager involvement in Wang Anshi's New Policies reforms, his actions criticized in <a href="Twenty-Four_Histories" title="wikilink">the later traditional histories</a>.<a href="#fn288" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref288"><sup>288</sup></a> However, Shen's reputation as a polymath has been well-regarded. The <a href="English_people" title="wikilink">British</a> sinologist, historian, and biochemist Joseph Needham (1900&lt;U+2013&gt;1995) stated that Shen Kuo was &quot;one of the greatest scientific minds in Chinese history.&quot;<a href="#fn289" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref289"><sup>289</sup></a> The <a href="French_people" title="wikilink">French</a> sinologist Jacques Gernet is of the opinion that Shen possessed an &quot;amazingly modern mind.&quot;<a href="#fn290" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref290"><sup>290</sup></a> Yao states of Shen's thorough recording of natural sciences in his <em>Dream Pool Essays</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We must regard Shen Kuo's collection as an indispensable primary source attesting to the unmatched level of attainment achieved by Chinese science prior to the twelfth century.<a href="#fn291" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref291"><sup>291</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, Toby E. Huff writes that Shen Kuo's &quot;scattered set&quot; of writings lacks clear-cut organization and &quot;theoretical acuteness,&quot; that is, <a href="scientific_theory" title="wikilink">scientific theory</a>.<a href="#fn292" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref292"><sup>292</sup></a> Nathan Sivin wrote that Shen's originality stands &quot;cheek by jowl with trivial didacticism, court anecdotes, and ephemeral curiosities&quot; that provide little insight.<a href="#fn293" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref293"><sup>293</sup></a> Donald Holzman writes that Shen &quot;has nowhere organized his observations into anything like a general theory.&quot;<a href="#fn294" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref294"><sup>294</sup></a> Huff writes that this was a systemic problem of early Chinese science, which lacked systematic treatment that could be found in European works such as the <em>Concordance and Discordant Canons</em> by the lawyer <a href="Gratian_(jurist)" title="wikilink">Gratian</a> of <a href="Bologna" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bologna</a> (fl. 12th century).<a href="#fn295" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref295"><sup>295</sup></a> In regards to an overarching concept of <a href="science" class="uri" title="wikilink">science</a> which could branch together all the various sciences studied by the Chinese, Sivin asserts that the writings of Shen Kuo &quot;do not indicate that he achieved, or even sought, an integrated framework for his diverse knowledge; the one common thread is the varied responsibilities of his career as a high civil servant.&quot;<a href="#fn296" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref296"><sup>296</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="burial-and-posthumous-honors">Burial and posthumous honors</h3>
