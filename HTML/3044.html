<p><strong><a href="Ian_Johnson_(cricketer)" title="wikilink">Ian Johnson</a></strong> was a member of <a href="Donald_Bradman" title="wikilink">Donald Bradman</a>'s famous <a href="Australian_cricket_team_in_England_in_1948" title="wikilink">Australian cricket team tour of England in 1948</a>, which went undefeated in their 34 matches. This unprecedented feat by a touring side earned them the sobriquet <em>The Invincibles</em>.</p>
<h2 id="early-matches">Early matches</h2>
<p>Australia traditionally fielded its first-choice team in the tour opener, which was customarily against <a href="Worcestershire_County_Cricket_Club" title="wikilink">Worcestershire</a>.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> Johnson had been a regular member of the Australian Test team since the <a href="Second_World_War" title="wikilink">Second World War</a>, so he was a natural selection.</p>
<p>Johnson took 3/52 from 23 overs, the most of any bowler, cleaning up the lower order as Australia removed the hosts for 233.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> When Australia batted, Johnson came in at No. 10 and made an unbeaten 12 as Australia declared at 8/462. The hosts were bowled out for 212 to complete victory by an innings and 17 runs. Johnson took the last three wickets to end with 3/75 from 13.3 overs, although he was the most uneconomical bowler among those who sent down more than three overs.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>Johnson played a key part in the next match against <a href="Leicestershire_County_Cricket_Club" title="wikilink">Leicestershire</a>. He made six at No. 8 as Australia made 448. Johnson came on with the hosts at 3/74 and took two quick wickets in the space of five runs, beginning a collapse that led to Leicestershire being all out for 130. He ended with 2/50 from 23 overs. Australia enforced the <a href="follow_on" title="wikilink">follow on</a>, and Johnson broke through their top and middle order. The hosts reached 0/45 before Johnson took the first five wickets to fall to reduce them to 5/88. They then progressed to 5/113 before Johnson took two more wickets in the space of four balls. Johnson ended with 7/42 from 21 overs, his best first-class innings figures, as Leicestershire were out for 147, handing Australia victory by an innings and 171 runs.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a><a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>The Australians then proceeded to play <a href="Yorkshire_County_Cricket_Club" title="wikilink">Yorkshire</a>, on a damp pitch that suited slower bowling.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a><a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a><a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> Johnson was rested as Australia came closest to losing for the whole tour. Australia were 6/31 chasing 60 for victory before scraping home by four wickets.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a><a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a><a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<p>Johnson then returned in the next match against <a href="Surrey_County_Cricket_Club" title="wikilink">Surrey</a> at <a href="The_Oval" title="wikilink">The Oval</a> in <a href="London" class="uri" title="wikilink">London</a>, where Australia won the toss and batted first.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a><a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> Batting at No. 6, Johnson came in at 4/444 and put on 99 runs with vice-captain and fellow <a href="South_Melbourne_Cricket_Club" title="wikilink">South Melbournian</a> <a href="Lindsay_Hassett" title="wikilink">Lindsay Hassett</a>, before falling for 46. Australia were eventually bowled out for 632. Johnson then took five wickets in helping to cut down Surrey's first innings. The hosts reached 2/40 before Johnson took three middle order wickets to reduce them to 6/66. He then took the final two wickets to end with 5/53 from 18.2 overs. Surrey were bowled out for 141 and forced to follow on and Johnson took 3/40 in the second innings as they made 195 to cede victory to Australia by an innings. He had removed captain <a href="Errol_Holmes" title="wikilink">Errol Holmes</a> and <a href="Stuart_Surridge" title="wikilink">Stuart Surridge</a> in both matches.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<p>Johnson was rested for the next match against <a href="Cambridge_University_Cricket_Club" title="wikilink">Cambridge University</a>,<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a><a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> which Australia won by an innings.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> In the following match against <a href="Essex_County_Cricket_Club" title="wikilink">Essex</a>,<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> Johnson returned as Australia won the toss and batted first and went on to score a world-record 721 runs in one day. He came in at 6/664 and was unable to join in the high scoring, making only nine as the lower order folded quickly with none of the four bowlers making double figures.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a><a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> Australia then proceeded to victory by an innings and 451 runs, their biggest winning margin for the tour.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a><a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> Johnson was not required to bowl in the first innings as the pacemen dismissed the hosts for 83 in 36.5 overs. In the second innings, Johnson was given an opportunity and he took the four of the first six wickets to fall, reducing Essex to 6/46. The home side then added 131 for the next wicket before Johnson removed their captain and top-scorer <a href="Tom_Pearce" title="wikilink">Tom Pearce</a> for 71, before taking another wicket as Essex were out for 187. Johnson finished with 6/37 from 21 overs.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a></p>
<p>Johnson was then rested for the next match against <a href="Oxford_University_Cricket_Club" title="wikilink">Oxford University</a>, which resulted in another innings victory.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a><a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a><a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="mcc-match-and-lead-in-to-the-tests">MCC match and lead in to the Tests</h2>
<p>The next match was against the <a href="Marylebone_Cricket_Club" title="wikilink">Marylebone Cricket Club</a> at <a href="Lord&#39;s" class="uri" title="wikilink">Lord's</a>. The MCC fielded seven players who would represent England in the Tests,<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a><a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a><a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a><a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a><a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a><a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> and were basically a full strength Test team, as were Australia, who fielded their first-choice team. Having been a regular member of the Test team in recent times,<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> and having taken 29 wickets at 12.03 in his four games on tour,<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> Johnson and his spin bowling partner was <a href="Colin_McCool" title="wikilink">Colin McCool</a>, a <a href="leg_spin" title="wikilink">leg spinner</a>, as in the match against Worcestershire. Barring one change in the bowling department, the same team lined up for Australia in the First Test, with the top six batsmen in the same position.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a><a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> It was a chance to gain a psychological advantage. Australia won the toss and batted and Johnson came in at No. 7 at 5/343 to join former South Melbourne and Victorian team-mate and fellow <a href="Royal_Australian_Air_Force" title="wikilink">Royal Australian Air Force</a> fighter pilot <a href="Keith_Miller" title="wikilink">Keith Miller</a>.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a><a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> The pair put on 165 before Miller fell, quickly followed by Johnson at 8/512, trapped <a href="leg_before_wicket" title="wikilink">leg before wicket</a> by off spinner <a href="Jim_Laker" title="wikilink">Jim Laker</a> for 80,<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> but not before lifting Laker three times into the crowd for six.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> Bradman's men went on to amass 552. Johnson was the least successful and uneconomical Australian bowler in the first innings, taking 0/43 from 12 overs as the hosts made 189. Bradman enforced the follow on and Johnson had more success on the second attempt. The hosts had reached 3/128 when Johnson caused a middle-order collapse. He had <a href="New_Zealand_cricket_team" title="wikilink">New Zealand</a> Test batsman <a href="Martin_Donnelly" title="wikilink">Martin Donnelly</a> stumped by <a href="Don_Tallon" title="wikilink">Don Tallon</a>, before trapping leading English Test batsman <a href="Len_Hutton" title="wikilink">Len Hutton</a> five runs later. He then removed <a href="Ken_Cranston" title="wikilink">Ken Cranston</a> to leave the MCC at 6/159. Johnson ended with 3/37 as Australia bowled out the home side for 205 to win by an innings, also catching <a href="Denis_Compton" title="wikilink">Denis Compton</a> from the pace bowling of <a href="Ray_Lindwall" title="wikilink">Ray Lindwall</a>.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a><a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a></p>
<p>The MCC match was followed by Australia's first non-victory of the tour against <a href="Lancashire_County_Cricket_Club" title="wikilink">Lancashire</a>.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a><a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> Johnson had little to do. He was promoted to No. 4 and made only five in the first innings after the first day was washed out. He then took 0/16 from eight overs and neither batted nor bowled in the second innings as the match ended in a draw.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a><a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a><a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a></p>
<p>In the following match against <a href="Nottinghamshire_County_Cricket_Club" title="wikilink">Nottinghamshire</a>, Johnson took 1/26 and made a duck in the first innings. He then took 3/78 in the second innings as the match was drawn.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a><a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a><a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a> In the following match against <a href="Hampshire_County_Cricket_Club" title="wikilink">Hampshire</a>, Australia had another scare.<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a> On a drying pitch, Johnson took 2/35 as Australia removed the hosts for 195. He then made two as Australia were dismissed for 117, the first time they had conceded a first innings lead in the tour, with Barnes making 20.<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a><a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a> He then took 0/13 in four overs as Hassett's opening bowlers took all the wickets as Hampshire were then bowled out for 103 to leave Australia a target of 182 in 175 minutes. Johnson was then promoted to No. 3 and came to the crease immediately when <a href="Sid_Barnes" title="wikilink">Sid Barnes</a> fell before Australia had scored. Johnson hit out, striking three <a href="six_(cricket)" title="wikilink">sixes</a> and seven fours, making 74 in the stand of 105 with <a href="Bill_Brown_(cricketer)" title="wikilink">Bill Brown</a>. He fell for 74 but Hassett came in and steered Australia to an eight-wicket win<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a><a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a><a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a><a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a> The final match before the First Test was against <a href="Sussex_County_Cricket_Club" title="wikilink">Sussex</a>. Johnson was not required to bowl or bat in the first innings. The pacemen shot out the hosts for 86 in 46.4 overs and Australia then declared at 5/549. Johnson then took 0/37 in 11 overs as Sussex were out for 138 to seal another innings victory.<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a><a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a><a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="first-test">First Test</h2>

<p>Johnson was selected in the team for the First Test at <a href="Trent_Bridge" title="wikilink">Trent Bridge</a>, although his four matches since the MCC match had yielded only six wickets at 34.16.<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a> McCool, the other spinner in the MCC and Worcestershire matches, had only played in one match since the MCC game, and he was wicketless.<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a> He was the only change from those two matches as <a href="Bill_Johnston_(cricketer)" title="wikilink">Bill Johnston</a>, who bowled left arm pace and orthodox spin was included at the last minute in the hope of exploiting a wet wicket.<a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a> Johnston had taken match figures of 10/40 and 11/117 against Yorkshire and Hampshire respectively, both on wet wickets.<a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a><a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a></p>
<p>English captain <a href="Norman_Yardley" title="wikilink">Norman Yardley</a> won the toss and elected to bat.<a href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a> Pundits predicted that the pitch would be ideal for batting apart from some assistance to fast bowlers in the first hour.<a href="#fn67" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a> Australia's fast bowlers reduced England to 8/74 before finishing them off for 165. Johnson was only given five overs for 0/19 as the pacemen efficiently cut down the English batsmen in 79 overs.<a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a></p>
<p>During the innings, <a href="Bill_Edrich" title="wikilink">Bill Edrich</a> was on four when he edged <a href="Ray_Lindwall" title="wikilink">Ray Lindwall</a> to Johnson at first slip. Johnson got both hands to the ball above his head, but dropped it. However it was not costly, as Edrich was later out for 18.<a href="#fn69" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref69"><sup>69</sup></a><a href="#fn70" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a><a href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a></p>
<p>On the third day, Australia had reached 5/305 when Johnson came to the bat. He made 21 with three fours, including an edge over the slips cordon, before being bowled by <a href="Jim_Laker" title="wikilink">Jim Laker</a>. Johnson hit the ball onto his foot and it rolled back into his stumps.<a href="#fn72" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref72"><sup>72</sup></a> This left Australia at 6/338 but the lower order continued to score and pushed the total to 509, giving the tourists a 344-run lead.<a href="#fn73" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref73"><sup>73</sup></a></p>
<p>Late in the day, after scoring 13 from 43 minutes, Edrich was caught behind attempting a cut from Johnson. He did not read the <a href="arm_ball" title="wikilink">arm ball</a> that went straight on and the ball took the outside edge, leaving England 2/39.<a href="#fn74" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref74"><sup>74</sup></a><a href="#fn75" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref75"><sup>75</sup></a><a href="#fn76" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref76"><sup>76</sup></a> <a href="Denis_Compton" title="wikilink">Denis Compton</a> came in and he ran down the pitch before the ball was bowled and had to quickly block the ball on the run. He then survived a confident <a href="leg_before_wicket" title="wikilink">leg before wicket</a> appeal from Johnson when he was eight. Compton appeared resigned to his fate ready to walk, but umpire Chester declined the appeal.<a href="#fn77" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref77"><sup>77</sup></a> England closed the day at 2/121.<a href="#fn78" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref78"><sup>78</sup></a></p>
<p>On the fourth day the light was again poor, but England did not appeal against the light. Yardley wanted to bat now in poor visibility so that he could erase the deficit and build a lead, so that if a shower came later and turned the pitch into a <a href="sticky_wicket" title="wikilink">sticky wicket</a>, Australia would have to chase a target on an erratic surface.<a href="#fn79" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref79"><sup>79</sup></a> Bradman thought that rain might come so he utilised Toshack and Johnson to bowl defensively with <a href="leg_theory" title="wikilink">leg theory</a> so that England would not have a lead should a sticky wicket arise.<a href="#fn80" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref80"><sup>80</sup></a></p>
<p>Soon after reaching his century, Compton edged to the slips from the bowling of Miller, but was dropped by Johnson.<a href="#fn81" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref81"><sup>81</sup></a> Compton went on to make 184 and England were eventually out for 441 on the final day. Johnson had sent down 42 overs for a return of 1/66. He had the best economy rate of 1.57 runs per over, ahead of Toshack's 1.81, with both having been used by Bradman This left Australia a target of 98, which they reached with eight wickets in hand.<a href="#fn82" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref82"><sup>82</sup></a><a href="#fn83" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref83"><sup>83</sup></a><a href="#fn84" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref84"><sup>84</sup></a></p>
<p>Between Tests, Johnson played the match against <a href="Northamptonshire_County_Cricket_Club" title="wikilink">Northamptonshire</a>, which started the day after the Test. He took three wickets in the middle-order and ended with 3/13 from 13 overs, the most economical of the Australians in the first innings as the hosts were out for 119. He made only four in the bat and took 1/46 in the second innings as Australia cruised to victory by an innings.<a href="#fn85" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref85"><sup>85</sup></a><a href="#fn86" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref86"><sup>86</sup></a><a href="#fn87" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref87"><sup>87</sup></a> After playing in seven consecutive matches, comprising 21 days of cricket between May 22 and June 18,<a href="#fn88" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref88"><sup>88</sup></a><a href="#fn89" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref89"><sup>89</sup></a> Johnson was rested for the second match between Tests, against <a href="Yorkshire_County_Cricket_Club" title="wikilink">Yorkshire</a>, which was drawn.<a href="#fn90" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref90"><sup>90</sup></a><a href="#fn91" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref91"><sup>91</sup></a><a href="#fn92" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref92"><sup>92</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="second-test">Second Test</h2>

<p>Australia opted to field an unchanged lineup for the Second Test at <a href="Lord&#39;s" class="uri" title="wikilink">Lord's</a>.<a href="#fn93" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref93"><sup>93</sup></a><a href="#fn94" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref94"><sup>94</sup></a> Johnson came to the crease at 5/216, and he struggled to score, making only four of the 30 runs added during his stay at the crease before falling at 7/246.<a href="#fn95" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref95"><sup>95</sup></a><a href="#fn96" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref96"><sup>96</sup></a> However, Australia's lower order wagged and they eventually reached 350 on the second morning.<a href="#fn97" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref97"><sup>97</sup></a></p>
<p>After lunch, Hutton played outside a Johnson <a href="off_break" title="wikilink">off break</a> on the front foot and was bowled for 20 to leave England at 32/2.<a href="#fn98" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref98"><sup>98</sup></a><a href="#fn99" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref99"><sup>99</sup></a> Johnson took the last two wickets for fall on the second day, having <a href="Alec_Coxon" title="wikilink">Alec Coxon</a> caught and bowled for 19 and then having <a href="Jim_Laker" title="wikilink">Jim Laker</a> caught behind for 28 after the pair had put on 41. England were out early in the second morning for 215. Johnson ended with 3/72, having sent down 35 overs, the most by any Australian.<a href="#fn100" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref100"><sup>100</sup></a></p>
<p>The weather was fine as Australia started their second innings just after noon.<a href="#fn101" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref101"><sup>101</sup></a> From the second ball of the innings, bowled by Bedser, Barnes got off the mark to avoid his <a href="pair_(cricket)" title="wikilink">pair</a>.<a href="#fn102" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref102"><sup>102</sup></a> Coxon took the new ball at the other end and Barnes and Morris saw it off without loss. Barnes survived a missed stumping opportunity from Laker when he was 18; he came down the pitch and the ball bounced out of the footmarks, which Evans fumbled.<a href="#fn103" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref103"><sup>103</sup></a><a href="#fn104" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref104"><sup>104</sup></a></p>
<p>On the fourth day, Johnson came in at 6/445, with Australia already leading by 580. He made nine before his partner <a href="Ray_Lindwall" title="wikilink">Ray Lindwall</a> was stumped, which prompted Bradman to declare at 7/460, leaving England a victory target of 596, which would require a world record run chase.<a href="#fn105" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref105"><sup>105</sup></a><a href="#fn106" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref106"><sup>106</sup></a></p>
<p>Further showers breathed extra life into the pitch, forcing a rain break immediately after England started their runchase.<a href="#fn107" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref107"><sup>107</sup></a> When the players returned, Lindwall and Johnston extracted steep bounce with the new ball, troubling the English batsmen.<a href="#fn108" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref108"><sup>108</sup></a></p>
<p>Hutton and Washbrook took the score to 42, England's highest opening partnership of the series before Hutton edged Lindwall to Johnson in the slips and was out for 13.<a href="#fn109" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref109"><sup>109</sup></a><a href="#fn110" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref110"><sup>110</sup></a> Soon after, <a href="Bill_Edrich" title="wikilink">Bill Edrich</a> edged to Johnson low down in the slips and England were 2/52.<a href="#fn111" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref111"><sup>111</sup></a><a href="#fn112" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref112"><sup>112</sup></a> Johnson had little else to do as the pacemen steadily made inroads on a seaming pitch.

Hassett declared without further addition to the score after Johnson fell.<a href="#fn120" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref120"><sup>120</sup></a> Johnson then played a leading role with the ball, taking his only ten-wicket match haul for the tour.<a href="#fn121" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref121"><sup>121</sup></a> After the openers had put on 74, Johnson removed both in quick succession to leave the hosts at 2/79.

<h2 id="third-test">Third Test</h2>

<p>The teams reassembled at Old Trafford for the Third Test. Australia dropped <a href="Bill_Brown_(cricketer)" title="wikilink">Bill Brown</a>, their reserve opener who had batted out of position in the middle order and scored 73 runs at 24.33 in three innings.<a href="#fn127" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref127"><sup>127</sup></a><a href="#fn128" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref128"><sup>128</sup></a> Brown was replaced by the all rounder <a href="Sam_Loxton" title="wikilink">Sam Loxton</a>.<a href="#fn129" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref129"><sup>129</sup></a> Brown's omission was to unexpectedly alter Johnson's playing role.</p>
<p>Yardley won the toss and elected to bat, and consolidated their innings after falling to 2/28.<a href="#fn130" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref130"><sup>130</sup></a> When Johnson was bowling after the pacemen had taken the ball, <a href="Jack_Crapp" title="wikilink">Jack Crapp</a> hit three driven boundaries from Johnson in quick succession, which prompted Bradman to take the new ball at 2/96. England then lost three quick wickets to be 5/119.<a href="#fn131" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref131"><sup>131</sup></a><a href="#fn132" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref132"><sup>132</sup></a> Soon after, Yardley lofted <a href="Ernie_Toshack" title="wikilink">Ernie Toshack</a> into the on-side into the hands of Johnson to fall for 22 with the score at 6/141.<a href="#fn133" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref133"><sup>133</sup></a><a href="#fn134" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref134"><sup>134</sup></a></p>
<p>On the second morning, English tailender <a href="Dick_Pollard" title="wikilink">Dick Pollard</a> came to the crease and pulled a ball from Johnson into the ribs of Barnes, who was standing at short leg. Barnes stood closer than most in that position in support of the spinner, almost on the edge of the cut strip and was unable to evade the ball.<a href="#fn135" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref135"><sup>135</sup></a> Barnes &quot;dropped like a fallen tree&quot;,<a href="#fn136" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref136"><sup>136</sup></a> and had to be carried from the ground by four policemen and taken to hospital for an examination.<a href="#fn137" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref137"><sup>137</sup></a> England eventually reached 363, with Johnson sending down 38 overs without success and conceding 77 runs.<a href="#fn138" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref138"><sup>138</sup></a></p>
<p>England came out for the their second innings and Johnson bowled only seven overs on the third afternoon as England closed at 3/174 from 69 overs, with Bradman relying on his seamers.<a href="#fn139" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref139"><sup>139</sup></a> Late in the day, Washbrook was dropped in the slips cordon by Johnson from the bowling of Toshack when he was on 80,<a href="#fn140" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref140"><sup>140</sup></a><a href="#fn141" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref141"><sup>141</sup></a> and he reached dstumps unbeaten on 85.<a href="#fn142" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref142"><sup>142</sup></a> Johnson's miss only cost five runs, as the fourth day was washed out and England declared without further batting as rain delayed the start on the final day.<a href="#fn143" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref143"><sup>143</sup></a> Johnson ended with 0/16 from seven overs.<a href="#fn144" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref144"><sup>144</sup></a></p>
<p>Play began after the tea break, with Australia needing score 317 in the last session or England needing to take ten wickets. The pitch played very slowly with the excess moisture. With Australia not looking to chase the runs, Yardley often had seven men in close catching positions.<a href="#fn145" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref145"><sup>145</sup></a> In the first half hour, Australia showed little attacking intent and had scored only six runs. <a href="Jack_Young_(cricketer)" title="wikilink">Jack Young</a> replaced Pollard and Johnson immediately swept him for four, before edging the next ball to Crapp to fall for six to leave Australia 1/10.<a href="#fn146" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref146"><sup>146</sup></a><a href="#fn147" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref147"><sup>147</sup></a> Australia then batted for another two hours without further loss to reach 1/92 from 61 overs when the match was finally put out of its misery by a series of periodic rain interruptions.<a href="#fn148" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref148"><sup>148</sup></a> Johnson had an unhappy game, scoring seven runs in two innings, dropping a catch and taking match figures of 0/93.<a href="#fn149" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref149"><sup>149</sup></a><a href="#fn150" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref150"><sup>150</sup></a></p>
<p>After the Test, Johnson was rested for the victory over <a href="Middlesex_County_Cricket_Club" title="wikilink">Middlesex</a> by ten wickets in Australia's only county match between Tests.<a href="#fn151" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref151"><sup>151</sup></a><a href="#fn152" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref152"><sup>152</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="fourth-test">Fourth Test</h2>

<p>The teams then headed to Headingley for the Fourth Test with Barnes still unfit. Australia made two changes for the Test.<a href="#fn153" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref153"><sup>153</sup></a><a href="#fn154" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref154"><sup>154</sup></a> Harvey came in for Barnes,<a href="#fn155" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref155"><sup>155</sup></a> while Saggers replaced Tallon, who had a finger injury, behind the stumps. Brown was not recalled to open with Morris; instead, Hassett was promoted to open with Morris, while the teenaged Harvey came into the middle-order. Thus Australia jettisoned the experiment of opening the batting with Johnson, who had managed one and six in the previous match.<a href="#fn156" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref156"><sup>156</sup></a><a href="#fn157" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref157"><sup>157</sup></a></p>
<p>England won the toss and elected to bat on an ideal batting pitch,<a href="#fn158" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref158"><sup>158</sup></a><a href="#fn159" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref159"><sup>159</sup></a> that was seen as being unhelpful to <a href="fast_bowling" title="wikilink">fast bowling</a>.<a href="#fn160" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref160"><sup>160</sup></a> England brought up 150 without loss, 30 minutes before tea, and continued unhindered by two brief interruptions due to rain. Up to this point, the Australian bowling had been loose and inaccurate.<a href="#fn161" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref161"><sup>161</sup></a> Bradman brought on Johnson, who had delivered only three overs to this point, the rest of the proceedings having been through fast bowlers.<a href="#fn162" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref162"><sup>162</sup></a> Seeking to stem the flow of runs, Bradman set a defensive ring field for Johnson, with no slip. While Johnson bowled two consecutive maidens, but Washbrook was scoring freely at the other end, so Bradman then called for the new ball and brought back the fast bowlers.<a href="#fn163" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref163"><sup>163</sup></a> Johnson was still wicketless as England closed the day at 2/268.<a href="#fn164" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref164"><sup>164</sup></a> <a href="Jack_Fingleton" title="wikilink">Jack Fingleton</a> said that Australia's day went &quot;progressively downhill&quot; and was its worst day of bowling since the <a href="Second_World_War" title="wikilink">Second World War</a>, citing the proliferation of full tosses.<a href="#fn165" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref165"><sup>165</sup></a> The next morning, England progressed strongly. Nightwatchman hit three consecutive fours from Toshack, prompting Bradman to replaced him with Johnson. Bedser surveyed Johnson's wares for one over before Johnson into the leg side in the next over three times, yielding a <a href="six_(cricket)" title="wikilink">six</a> and two fours. Johnson was then removed from the attack. When he came back, Edrich hit him for another six to reach 96. However, Johnson soon had his revenge. England reached 2/423 when Bedser was out caught and bowled by Johnson, patting the ball back when he could have hit it decisively. This ended a 155-run third-wicket partnership. Edrich then attempted to pull Johnson to the on side but only hit it in the air to Morris,<a href="#fn166" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref166"><sup>166</sup></a> who completed the catch. This came only three runs after Bedser's dismissal and left the score at 4/426.<a href="#fn167" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref167"><sup>167</sup></a> Johnson's two wickets precipitated a collapse and England were all out for 496.<a href="#fn168" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref168"><sup>168</sup></a> He ended with 2/89 from 33 overs, but he was the most uneconomical of the frontline bowlers except for Toshack, who broke down with a knee injury.<a href="#fn169" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref169"><sup>169</sup></a></p>
<p>Johnson came in at 5/294 in Australia's innings when Harvey departed for 112, but he made only 10 before falling at 6/329. Lindwall replaced him and made 77 as Australia's tail pushed the score to 458 on the fourth morning, reducing the deficit to 38.<a href="#fn170" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref170"><sup>170</sup></a> In the second innings, Johnson continued to be punished, with both Washbrook and Hutton lofting him for sixes in quick succession, and Bradman pulled him out of the attack.<a href="#fn171" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref171"><sup>171</sup></a> When Johnson returned, Hutton hit him in the air again, but this time the batsman was by Bradman on the run for 57, leaving England at 2/129.<a href="#fn172" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref172"><sup>172</sup></a><a href="#fn173" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref173"><sup>173</sup></a> Edrich and Compton came in and were pinned down, but after 45 minutes, Compton charged Johnson and heaved him to the leg side for a boundary.<a href="#fn174" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref174"><sup>174</sup></a> Bradman promptly took the new ball as England reached 2/209 at tea. After the break, Johnson continued to be targeted by England. Edrich hit three consecutive fours before lofting a fourth into the crowd for six.<a href="#fn175" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref175"><sup>175</sup></a> England reached 2/232 before collapsing to be 8/362 at the end of the day, but Johnson was unable to take any more wickets.<a href="#fn176" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref176"><sup>176</sup></a></p>
<p>England batted on for five minutes on the final morning, adding three runs in two overs before Yardley <a href="Declaration_and_forfeiture" title="wikilink">declared</a> at 8/365.<a href="#fn177" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref177"><sup>177</sup></a><a href="#fn178" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref178"><sup>178</sup></a> Johnson had taken 1/85 from 21 overs and was the most uneconomical of the bowlers. He conceded 4.04 runs per over while the others averaged 3.26.<a href="#fn179" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref179"><sup>179</sup></a> Batting into the final day allowed Yardley to ask the groundsman to use a heavy roller, which would help to break up the wicket and make the surface more likely to spin.<a href="#fn180" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref180"><sup>180</sup></a></p>
<p>This left Australia to chase 404 runs for victory. At the time, this would have been the highest ever fourth innings score to result in a Test victory for the batting side. Australia had only 345 minutes to reach the target, but they reached it with 15 minutes to spare and seven wickets in hand to seal the series 3–0.<a href="#fn181" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref181"><sup>181</sup></a><a href="#fn182" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref182"><sup>182</sup></a><a href="#fn183" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref183"><sup>183</sup></a></p>
<p>After bowling 54 overs in the Fourth Test,<a href="#fn184" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref184"><sup>184</sup></a> Johnson was rested as Australia defeated <a href="Derbyshire_County_Cricket_Club" title="wikilink">Derbyshire</a> by an innings in a match that started the day after the Fourth Test.<a href="#fn185" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref185"><sup>185</sup></a><a href="#fn186" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref186"><sup>186</sup></a><a href="#fn187" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref187"><sup>187</sup></a><a href="#fn188" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref188"><sup>188</sup></a> He then returned and bowled the most overs against <a href="Glamorgan_County_Cricket_Club" title="wikilink">Glamorgan</a>, which was a rain-affected draw that did not reach the second innings.<a href="#fn189" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref189"><sup>189</sup></a> Johnson sent down 28.4 overs in taking 3/58 as the hosts were bowled out for 197 and Australia reached 3/215 when the weather ended the match.<a href="#fn190" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref190"><sup>190</sup></a><a href="#fn191" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref191"><sup>191</sup></a><a href="#fn192" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref192"><sup>192</sup></a></p>
<p>Johnson was the most economical Australian in the first innings against <a href="Warwickshire_County_Cricket_Club" title="wikilink">Warwickshire</a>. He took 3/29 from 22.3 overs as the hosts fell for 138. He then made an unbeaten 13 at No. 9 as Australia struggled to 254 in reply. He was then given a solitary maiden over in the second innings before Australia won by nine wickets.<a href="#fn193" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref193"><sup>193</sup></a><a href="#fn194" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref194"><sup>194</sup></a><a href="#fn195" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref195"><sup>195</sup></a> Australia then faced and drew with Lancashire for the second time on the tour. Johnson came to crease at 6/202 after Australia had suffered a middle-order collapse of 3/8. He then made 48 as the Australian lower order wagged to end with 321. Johnson was given a light bowling load in the first innings, sending down only five overs, but he removed three of the last four wickets to end with 3/5 as the hosts fell for 130. He did not bat in the second innings and took 1/30 as the home side managed to hang on with seven wickets down in their second innings.<a href="#fn196" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref196"><sup>196</sup></a><a href="#fn197" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref197"><sup>197</sup></a><a href="#fn198" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref198"><sup>198</sup></a> In the non-first-class match against <a href="Durham_County_Cricket_Club" title="wikilink">Durham</a>, a rain-affected draw that did not reach the second innings, Johnson came in at 7/212 and made 44 to help Australia recover to 282 and then took 1/2 from three overs as the hosts reached 5/73 when rain washed out the match after the first day.<a href="#fn199" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref199"><sup>199</sup></a><a href="#fn200" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref200"><sup>200</sup></a><a href="#fn201" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref201"><sup>201</sup></a></p>

Johnson was not asked to bowl as the first four bowlers used cut down the hosts' first innings for 51 in just 23 overs. It was a similar tale in the second innings, with the pacemen doing the early damage. Johnson bowled briefly, sending down 4.5 overs and removing the last two batsmen to end with 2/15 as the hosts fell for 124 in 32.5 overs. Australia had won the match by an innings in two days.<a href="#fn213" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref213"><sup>213</sup></a><a href="#fn214" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref214"><sup>214</sup></a> In the next match against the Gentlemen of England,<a href="#fn215" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref215"><sup>215</sup></a> Johnson did not bat as Australia eventually declared at 5/610 against a team that featured eight Test players.

<p>Australia's biggest challenge in the post-Test tour matches was against the Leveson-Gower's XI. During the last tour in 1938, this team was effectively a full-strength England outfit, but this time Bradman insisted that only a limited number of Test players be allowed to play. Bradman then fielded a full-strength team,<a href="#fn228" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref228"><sup>228</sup></a> with the only difference from the Fifth Test team being Johnson coming for Ring.

<p>The tour ended with two non-first-class matches against <a href="Scotland_national_cricket_team" title="wikilink">Scotland</a>. Johnson made a duck in Australia's 236 in the first match. He then bowled a total of 17 overs and took 3/26 as Australia won by an innings. In the second match, Johnson took 3/26 from 20.2 overs as Scotland made 178. He was then promoted to No. 5 and came in at 3/96 and hit 95 as Australia reached 6/407 declared. In the second innings, Johnson was unable to add a wicket in his final opportunity for the tour, taking 0/6 from three overs. However, when it became obvious that Australia was in an unassailable position, Bradman allowed wicket-keeper <a href="Don_Tallon" title="wikilink">Don Tallon</a> to bowl, and he took 2/15.
