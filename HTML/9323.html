<p>Otto Hunziker spent many early years in <a href="Goldbach,_Zurich" title="wikilink"> Goldbach</a>, part of K&lt;U+00FC&gt;snacht. He graduated from a Swiss agricultural college at age 19. He might have been influenced by Dr. Niklaus Gerber who studied at the University of Zurich and worked for 2 years at the Swiss-American Milk Co. in Little Falls, NY, USA. Dr. Gerber developed the Gerber method for analyzing fat content in milk. This was one focal area for O. F. Hunziker. In 1893 Otto Frederick Hunziker <a href="Emigration" title="wikilink"> emigrated</a> to the <a href="United_States" title="wikilink">United States</a>.</p>

To improve his English and commercial skills, he studied at <a href="Bryant_%26_Stratton_College" title="wikilink"> Bryant and Stratton</a> Business College, Providence, RI in 1896. He returned to Switzerland briefly in 1898 before returning to receive a B.S.

<h2 id="professorship-at-purdue">Professorship at Purdue</h2>
<p>In 1905, Mr. Hunziker accepted a position at <a href="Purdue_University" title="wikilink">Purdue University</a> in West Lafayette, Indiana as head of Purdue's <a href="http://www.ces.purdue.edu/dairy">Dairy</a> Department.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> Dairy departments were relatively new at American colleges. The first dairy school in the U.S. was created at the University of Wisconsin in 1890. Professor Hunziker led Purdue's dairy department through significant growth.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a><a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a></p>
<p>In the summer of 1906, O. F. Hunziker was among 18 teachers and investigators meeting at the University of Illinois, Urbana, to found what was then known as National Association of Dairy Instructors and Investigators. (The following year, this association changed its name to &quot;Official Dairy Instructors' Association&quot; and, in 1916, changed its name to American Dairy Science Association&quot;.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a>) From 1910 to 1926, Otto Hunziker chaired the Committee on Official Methods of Testing Milk and Cream for Butterfat of the <a href="American_Dairy_Science_Association" title="wikilink">American Dairy Science Association</a> (ADSA). In 1911, this committee met in Washington DC with the <a href="United_States_Department_of_Agriculture" title="wikilink"> U.S. Bureau of Dairying</a>, the <a href="American_National_Standards_Institute" title="wikilink"> U.S. Bureau of Standards</a> and manufacturers of glassware.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> Standard specifications for <a href="Babcock_test" title="wikilink"> Babcock glassware</a> were published as a result of this meeting. Professor Hunziker actively pursued numerous improvements to the testing methodology. It is difficult to overstate the importance that these specifications and efforts had on improving the quality and safety of dairy products. Otto Hunziker was the third president of <a href="American_Dairy_Science_Association" title="wikilink"> ADSA</a> from 1910 through 1911. During Professor Hunziker's presidency, ADSA also created a national score card for scoring dairies, standardized dairy judging contests, secured scholarships for student contests, improved national milk standards, developed ties with breed associations, and provided fora for industry discussions on dairy instruction and extension services.</p>

F. Hunziker oversaw planning and construction of Smith Hall, the building which thereafter housed Purdue's dairy manufacturing group, <a href="Cooperative_extension_service" title="wikilink"> extension service</a>, and creamery. While at Purdue, he published over 50 bulletins, leaflets, and scientific treatises addressing dairy farm and plant problems.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> In 1917, O.

<p><a href="image:OF_Hunziker.jpg" title="wikilink">left|thumb|O. F. HunzikerProfessor</a> Hunziker wrote dairy articles and textbooks used throughout the world, developed dairy curricula, advocated for dairy laws, and developed standard testing methodology. In particular, Dr. Hunziker authored <em>The Butter Industry, Prepared for Factory, School and Laboratory</em>, a well-known text in the industry that enjoyed at least three editions (1920, 1927, 1940).<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> A book that Dr. Hunziker originally self-published in 1914, <em>Condensed milk and milk powder: prepared for the use of milk condenseries, dairy students and pure food departments</em>, was republished in a seventh edition in October 2007 by Cartwright Press. According to one book review: &quot;The popularity of this book may be judged by the fact that this is the fourth edition, the three previous editions having long since been exhausted. The book is the most important contribution on the condensed milk and milk powder industry. It should be in the library of the teacher, the student or factory man interested in any phase of the condensed milk and milk powder industry.&quot;<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> In the 1920's, O.F.

<li id="fn23"> From the abstract: &quot;During the organizational year of the American Dairy Science Association (ADSA), Otto F. Hunziker led the dairy program at Purdue University. A charter member of ADSA and its third president, Dr. Hunziker's brilliant career as a scientist, teacher and author is recognized throughout the world. At Purdue he provided leadership in developing educational programs to better educate dairymen. His research programs established the accuracy of glassware and provided standard methods for the Babcock fat test of milk and cream. He planned Smith Hall, which was built in 1913 to provide facilities for teaching, research and extension work.&quot;<a href="#fnref23" class="footnote-back">↩</a></li>
<li id="fn24">The 1906 Purdue yearbook (the Debris Vol 18) lists: &quot;Otto Fred Hunziker, Instructor in Dairying; B.S.A., Cornell University, 1900; M.S.A., 1901; Sigma Xi&quot;. The only other &quot;dairying&quot; faculty listed is one Hubert Everett Van Norman who is listed as &quot;Resigned&quot;. The 1907 Debris indicates Otto Fred Hunziker was promoted to Associate Professor; the only other &quot;dairying&quot; faculty is one John deMoss Jarvis, Assistant in Dairying. The following year, Otto Fred Hunziker is listed as a full professor. In 1910, Otto's position is listed as Professor of Dairy Husbandry and as a member of the Official Dairy Instructors' Association (ODIA). John deMoss Jarvis remains the only other dairy faculty, but became an instructor in 1909. In the 1911-14 yearbooks, Otto Fred Hunziker is listed as President of the ODIA as well as member of the Indiana Academy of Science, Indiana State Dairy Association, and Indiana Jersey Cattle Club. The 1911 Debris also lists two dairy instructors and one assistant. In the new &quot;Experiment Station&quot; section, O. F. Hunziker is listed &quot;Chief of Dairy Husbandry&quot;. The 1914 Debris lists Alpha Zeta and the Purdue Dairy Club for the first time; apart from Professor Hunziker, two associates and an assistant are listed as faculty members of the dairy club.<a href="#fnref24" class="footnote-back">↩</a></li>

<li id="fn33">: &quot;The contributions of Otto F. Hunziker, Purdue University, to the Association extended far beyond his early 2-yr presidency, 1910 and 1911. For many years he was the dedicated member of the Journal Management Committee, nurturing the newly founded journal as if it were his very own. As an administrator, author, and researcher, his presence at a meeting assured its success. There was authority in his deliberate, well-chosen words. He represented the dairy manufacturers of America five times at the world's dairy congresses - London, 1928; Copenhagen, 1931; Berlin, 1937; Stockholm, 1949; den Hague, 1953 - a record that stood for many years. For his sustained enthusiasm for the American Dairy Science Association at home or abroad, he might well have been named 'Mr. ADSA'. He too, was listed among the 'Ten Master Minds of Dairying'.&quot;<a href="#fnref33" class="footnote-back">↩</a></li>
