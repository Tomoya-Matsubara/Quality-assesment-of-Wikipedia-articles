<p><strong>Rugby union</strong>, often simply referred to as <strong>rugby</strong>, is a <a href="Contact_sport#Full-contact" title="wikilink">full contact</a> team sport which originated in England in the early 19th century.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> One of the <a href="Comparison_of_rugby_league_and_rugby_union" title="wikilink">two codes</a> of <a href="rugby_football" title="wikilink">rugby football</a>, it is based on running with the ball in hand. It is played with an oval-shaped <a href="rugby_ball" title="wikilink">ball</a> on a field up to  long and  wide with H-shaped goal posts on each goal line.</p>
<p><a href="William_Webb_Ellis" title="wikilink">William Webb Ellis</a> is often credited with the invention of running with the ball in hand in 1823 at <a href="Rugby_School" title="wikilink">Rugby School</a> when he allegedly caught the ball while playing football and ran towards the opposition goal. However, the evidence for the story is doubtful. In 1845, the first football laws were written by Rugby School pupils; other significant events in the early development of rugby include the <a href="Blackheath_F.C." title="wikilink">Blackheath Club</a>'s decision to leave <a href="the_Football_Association" title="wikilink">the Football Association</a> in 1863 and the split between rugby union and <a href="rugby_league" title="wikilink">rugby league</a> in 1895. Historically an amateur sport, in 1995 the <a href="International_Rugby_Board" title="wikilink">International Rugby Board</a> (IRB) removed restrictions on payments to players, making the game openly professional at the highest level for the first time.</p>
<p>The IRB has been the governing body for rugby union since its formation in 1886. The spread of rugby union grew from the <a href="Home_Nations" title="wikilink">Home Nations</a> of Great Britain and Ireland, and was absorbed by many of the countries associated with the British Empire. Early exponents of the sport included Australia, New Zealand and South Africa. Countries that have adopted rugby union as their <a href="de_facto" title="wikilink">de facto</a> national sport include Fiji, Georgia, New Zealand, Samoa, Tonga and Wales. Rugby union is played in over 100 countries across six continents and as of November 2010 118 unions were members of the IRB.</p>
<p>The <a href="Rugby_World_Cup" title="wikilink">Rugby World Cup</a>, first held in 1987, takes place every four years, with the winner of the tournament receiving the <a href="Webb_Ellis_Cup" title="wikilink">Webb Ellis Cup</a>. The <a href="Six_Nations_Championship" title="wikilink">Six Nations Championship</a> in Europe and the <a href="Tri_Nations_(rugby_union)" title="wikilink">Tri Nations</a> in the Southern Hemisphere are major international competitions held annually. Major domestic competitions include the <a href="Top_14" title="wikilink">Top 14</a> in France, the <a href="English_Premiership_(rugby_union)" title="wikilink">English Premiership</a> in England, the <a href="Currie_Cup" title="wikilink">Currie Cup</a> in South Africa, and the <a href="ITM_Cup" title="wikilink">ITM Cup</a> in New Zealand. Other transnational competitions include the <a href="Celtic_League_(rugby_union)" title="wikilink">Celtic League</a>, originally involving Irish, Scottish and Welsh teams and now Italian teams as well; <a href="Super_Rugby" title="wikilink">Super Rugby</a> (previously Super 12 and Super 14), involving South African, Australian and New Zealand teams; and the <a href="Heineken_Cup" title="wikilink">Heineken Cup</a>, involving the top European teams from their respective domestic competitions.</p>

<p>The <a href="1870-71_Home_Nations_rugby_union_matches" title="wikilink">first rugby football international</a> took place on 27 March 1871, played between England and Scotland.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> By 1881 both Ireland and Wales had representative teams, and in 1883 the first international competition, the <a href="Six_Nations_Championship" title="wikilink">Home Nations Championship</a> had begun. 1883 also saw the first <a href="rugby_sevens" title="wikilink">rugby sevens</a> tournament at <a href="Melrose,_Scotland" title="wikilink">Melrose</a>, the <a href="Melrose_Sevens" title="wikilink">Melrose Sevens</a>,<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> which is still held annually.

All three teams brought new styles of play, fitness levels and tactics,<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> and were far more successful than critics had expected.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> The New Zealand 1905 touring team performed a <a href="Ka_Mate" title="wikilink">haka</a> before each match, leading Welsh Rugby Union administrator <a href="Tom_Williams_(Welsh_rugby_player)" title="wikilink">Tom Williams</a> to suggest that Wales player <a href="Teddy_Morgan" title="wikilink">Teddy Morgan</a> lead the crowd in singing the Welsh National Anthem, <em><a href="Hen_Wlad_Fy_Nhadau" title="wikilink">Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau</a></em>, as a response.

<p>Rugby union was included as an event in the Olympic Games four times during the early 1900s. In 1973 the first officially sanctioned international sevens tournament took place at Murrayfield, as part of the <a href="Scottish_Rugby_Union" title="wikilink">Scottish Rugby Union</a> centenary celebrations.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> In 1987 the first Rugby World Cup was held in New Zealand and Australia, and the inaugural winners were New Zealand. The first World Cup Sevens tournament was held at Murrayfield in 1993. Rugby Sevens was introduced into the <a href="Commonwealth_Rugby_Sevens_Championships" title="wikilink">Commonwealth Games</a> in 1998 and is due to be added to the Olympic Games by 2016.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a></p>
<p>Rugby union was an amateur sport until the IRB declared the game 'open' in 1995, removing restrictions on payments to players.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a><a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> However, the pre-1995 period of rugby union was marked by frequent accusations of &quot;<a href="shamateurism" class="uri" title="wikilink">shamateurism</a>&quot;,<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> including an investigation in Britain by a House of Commons Select committee.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> Following the introduction of professionalism trans-national club competitions were started, with the <a href="Heineken_Cup" title="wikilink">Heineken Cup</a> in the Northern Hemisphere and <a href="Super_Rugby" title="wikilink">Super Rugby</a> in the Southern Hemisphere.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a><a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> The <a href="Tri_Nations_(rugby_union)" title="wikilink">Tri-nations</a>, an annual international tournament involving South Africa, New Zealand and Australia, kicked off in 1996.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="teams-and-team-structures">Teams and team structures</h2>

<p><img src="Rugby_formation.svg" title="fig:A normal rugby union team formation illustrating each of the positions and their respective numbers." alt="A normal rugby union team formation illustrating each of the positions and their respective numbers." /> Each team starts the match with 15 players on the field.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> Players in a team are divided into eight <a href="Rugby_union_positions#Forwards" title="wikilink">forwards</a> (two more than in <a href="rugby_league" title="wikilink">rugby league</a>) and seven <a href="Rugby_union_positions#Backs" title="wikilink">backs</a>.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="forwards">Forwards</h3>
<p>The main responsibilities of the forward players are to gain and retain possession of the ball.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> Players in these positions are generally bigger and stronger and take part in the scrum and lineout.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> The forwards are often collectively referred to as the 'pack', especially when in the scrum formation.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a></p>
<p><strong>Front row</strong><br />
The front row consists of three players, two props; the loosehead prop and the tighthead prop, and the hooker. The role of the two props are to support the hooker during scrums, to provide support for the jumpers during lineouts and to provide strength and power in rucks and mauls.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> The third position in the front row is the hooker.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> The hooker is a key position in attacking and defensive play and is responsible for winning the ball in the scrum.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> Hookers normally throw the ball in at lineouts.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a></p>
<p><strong>Second row</strong><br />
The second row consists of two locks or lock forwards. Locks are usually the tallest players in the team, and specialise as lineout jumpers.<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> The main role of the lock in lineouts is to make a standing jump, often supported by the other forwards, to either collect the thrown ball or ensure the ball comes down on their side. Locks also have an important role in the scrum, binding directly behind the three front row players and providing forward drive.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a> <img src="Chabal_Rugby_Racing_vs_Stade_Toulousain_311009.jpg" title="fig:S&lt;U+00E9&gt;bastien Chabal (far left) in number eight position before entering the scrum|alt=Facing right a group of seven men, in blue and white hooped jersesy, bind together and crouch to form a scrum, the eighth player stands behind them observing the off-picture opposition." alt="S&lt;U+00E9&gt;bastien Chabal (far left) in number eight position before entering the scrum|alt=Facing right a group of seven men, in blue and white hooped jersesy, bind together and crouch to form a scrum, the eighth player stands behind them observing the off-picture opposition." /> <strong>Back row</strong><br />
The back row, not to be confused with &lt;U+2018&gt;Backs&lt;U+2019&gt;, is the third and final row of the forward positions, they are often referred to as the loose forwards.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a> The three positions in the back row are made up of two flankers and the number 8. The two flanker positions, called the blindside flanker and openside flanker, are the final row in the scrum. Their main role is to win posession through 'turn overs'.<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a> The number 8 packs down between the two flankers at the back of the scrum. His role in the scrum is to control the ball after it has been heeled back from the front of the pack and the position provides a link between the forwards and backs during attacking phases.<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="backs">Backs</h3>
<p>The role of the backs is to create and convert point-scoring opportunities, they are generally smaller but faster and more agile than the forwards.<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a> Another distinction between the two positions is that the backs are expected to have superior kicking skills, especially in the positions of fly-half and full-back.<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a></p>
<p><strong>Half-backs</strong><br />
The half-backs consist of two positions, the scrum-half/half-back and the fly-half/First Five-Eighth. The fly-half is crucial to a team's game plan, orchestrating the teams performance.<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a> They are usually the first to receive the ball from the scrum-half following a breakdown, lineout or scrum and need to be decisive with what actions to take and be effective at communicating with the outside backs.<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a> Many fly-halfs are also their team's goal kickers. The scrum-half is the link between the forwards and the backs.<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a> They receive the ball from the lineout and remove the ball from the back of the scrum, usually passing it to the fly-half.<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a> They also feed the scrum and sometimes have to act as a fourth loose forward.<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a></p>
<p><strong>Three quarters</strong><br />
There are four three quarter positions, the inside centre/Second Five-Eighth, outside centre and left and right wings. Like the fly-half they generally possess a good kicking game and are good at reading the play and directing the attack. The centres will attempt to tackle attacking players whilst in attack their should employ speed and strength to breach opposition defences.<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a> The wings are generally positioned on the outside of the backline. Their primary function is to finish off moves and score tries. Wings are usually the fastest players in the team and are either elusive runners, or more commonly in the modern era, big, strong and able to break tackles.<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a></p>
<p><strong>Fullbacks</strong><br />
The fullback normally positions himself several metres behind the back line. He fields any opposition kicks and is often the last line of defence should an opponent break through the back line.<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a> Two of the most important attributes of a good fullback are dependable catching skills and a good kicking game.<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a></p>

<h3 id="scoring">Scoring</h3>
<p>Rugby union is played between two teams &lt;U+2013&gt; the one which scores more points wins the game. Points can be scored in several ways: a <a href="try" class="uri" title="wikilink">try</a>, scored by grounding the ball in the in-goal area (between the goal line and the dead ball line), is worth 5 points and a subsequent conversion kick scores 2 points; a successful penalty kick or a <a href="drop_goal" title="wikilink">drop goal</a> each score 3 points.<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a> The values of each of these scoring methods have been changed over the years.<a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="the-playing-field">The playing field</h3>
<p>The field of play on a rugby pitch is as near as possible to a maximum of 144m long by 70m wide.<a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a> In actual gameplay there should be a maximum of 100m between the two trylines, with anywhere between 10 and 22m behind each try line to serve as the dead ball area.<a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a> There are several lines crossing it, notably the half way line, the &quot;twenty two&quot;, which is 22m from the goal line.<a href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a></p>
<p>Rugby goalposts are H-shaped, and consist of two poles, 5.6m apart, connected by a horizontal crossbar 3m above the ground.<a href="#fn67" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a> The original pitch dimensions were in <a href="imperial_units" title="wikilink">imperial units</a>, but have since been converted to the <a href="metric_system" title="wikilink">metric system</a>.<a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a><a href="#fn69" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref69"><sup>69</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="match-structure">Match structure</h3>
<p>At the beginning of the game, the captains and the referee toss a coin to decide which team will kick off first. Play then starts with a drop kick, with the players chasing the ball into the opposition's territory, and the other side trying to retrieve the ball and advance it. If the player with the ball is tackled, frequently a <a href="Playing_rugby_union#Ruck" title="wikilink">ruck</a> will result.<a href="#fn70" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a></p>
<p>Games are divided into 40-minute halves, with a break in the middle.<a href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a> The sides exchange ends of the field after the half-time break.<a href="#fn72" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref72"><sup>72</sup></a> Stoppages for injury or to allow the referee to take disciplinary action, do not count as part of the playing time, so that the elapsed time is usually longer than 80 minutes.<a href="#fn73" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref73"><sup>73</sup></a> The referee is responsible for keeping time, even when&lt;U+2014&gt;as in many professional tournaments&lt;U+2014&gt;he is assisted by an official time-keeper.<a href="#fn74" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref74"><sup>74</sup></a> If time expires while the ball is in play, the game continues until the ball is 'dead', and only then will the referee blow the whistle to signal half-time or full-time; but if the referee awards a penalty or free-kick, the game continues.<a href="#fn75" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref75"><sup>75</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="passing-and-kicking">Passing and kicking</h3>
<p>Forward passing (throwing the ball ahead to another player) is not allowed; the ball can be passed laterally or backwards.<a href="#fn76" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref76"><sup>76</sup></a> The ball tends to be moved forward in three ways &lt;U+2014&gt; by kicking, by a player running with it or within a scrum or <a href="Playing_rugby_union#Maul" title="wikilink">maul</a>. Only the player with the ball may be tackled or rucked. When a ball is knocked forward by a player with his/her arms, a &quot;knock-on&quot; is committed, and play is restarted with a scrum.<a href="#fn77" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref77"><sup>77</sup></a></p>
<p>Any player may kick the ball forward in an attempt to gain territory. When a player anywhere in the playing area kicks indirectly into <a href="Touch_(rugby)" title="wikilink">touch</a> so that the ball bounces in the field of play the throw-in is taken where the ball went into touch.<a href="#fn78" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref78"><sup>78</sup></a> If the player kicks directly into touch (i.e. without bouncing in-field first) from within their own 22 metre line the lineout is taken by the opposition where the ball went into touch, but if the ball is kicked into touch directly by a player outside the 22 metre line the lineout is taken level to where the kick was taken.<a href="#fn79" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref79"><sup>79</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="breakdowns">Breakdowns</h3>
<p><img src="Tackle.JPG" title="fig:A rugby tackle: tackles must be below the neck with the aim of impeding or grounding the player with the ball|alt=A child running away from camera in green and black hooped rugby jersey is in the process of being tackled around the hips and legs by an opponent." alt="A rugby tackle: tackles must be below the neck with the aim of impeding or grounding the player with the ball|alt=A child running away from camera in green and black hooped rugby jersey is in the process of being tackled around the hips and legs by an opponent." /> The aim of the defending side is to stop the player with the ball, either by bringing them to ground (a tackle, which is frequently followed by a ruck), or by contesting for possession with the ball-carrier on their feet (a maul). Such a circumstance is called a breakdown and each is governed by a specific law.</p>

<p>The earliest countries to adopt rugby union were <a href="Rugby_union_in_England" title="wikilink">England</a>, the country of inception, followed by the other three Home Nations, <a href="Rugby_union_in_Scotland" title="wikilink">Scotland</a>, <a href="Rugby_union_in_Ireland" title="wikilink">Ireland</a> and <a href="Rugby_union_in_Wales" title="wikilink">Wales</a>.

<p>The game of rugby union has spawned several variants of the full-contact, 15-a-side code. The two more common differences applied to the variants of the sport lie in either fewer players or reduced player contact. Of the variants, the oldest is <a href="Rugby_sevens" title="wikilink">Rugby sevens</a> (7's, or VIIs), a fast-paced variant which originated in <a href="Melrose,_Scotland" title="wikilink">Melrose</a>, Scotland in 1883. In rugby sevens, there are only seven players per side, and each half is normally seven minutes. Major tournaments include the <a href="Hong_Kong_Sevens" title="wikilink">Hong Kong Sevens</a> and <a href="Dubai_Sevens" title="wikilink">Dubai Sevens</a>, both held in areas not normally associated with the highest levels of the 15-a-side game. A more recent variant of the sport is <a href="Rugby_tens" title="wikilink">Rugby tens</a> (10's or Xs), a Malaysian variant with ten players per side.<a href="#fn230" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref230"><sup>230</sup></a></p>
<p>Due to the physical nature of playing rugby, several variants have been created to introduce the sport to children with a reduced level of physical contact.<a href="#fn231" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref231"><sup>231</sup></a> Of these versions, <a href="Touch_rugby" title="wikilink">Touch rugby</a>, in which &quot;tackles&quot; are made by simply touching the ball carrier with two hands, is popular as a mixed sex version of the sport played by both children and adults.<a href="#fn232" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref232"><sup>232</sup></a><a href="#fn233" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref233"><sup>233</sup></a> <a href="Tag_Rugby" title="wikilink">Tag Rugby</a>, is a version in which the participants wear a belt with two hook-and-loop fastener tags, the removal of either counting as a 'tackle'. Tag Rugby also varies in the fact that kicking the ball is not allowed.<a href="#fn234" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref234"><sup>234</sup></a> <a href="Mini_rugby" title="wikilink">Mini rugby</a> is another variant of rugby union aimed at fostering the sport in children.<a href="#fn235" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref235"><sup>235</sup></a><a href="#fn236" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref236"><sup>236</sup></a> It is played with only nine players and on a smaller pitch.<a href="#fn237" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref237"><sup>237</sup></a> Similar to Tag Rugby, <a href="American_Flag_Rugby" title="wikilink">American Flag Rugby</a>, (AFR), is a mixed gender, non-contact imitation of rugby union designed for American children entering grades K-9.<a href="#fn238" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref238"><sup>238</sup></a> Both American Flag Rugby and Mini Rugby differ to Tag Rugby in that they introduce more advanced elements of rugby union as the participants age.<a href="#fn239" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref239"><sup>239</sup></a></p>
<p>Other less formal variants include <a href="beach_rugby" title="wikilink">beach rugby</a> and <a href="snow_rugby" title="wikilink">snow rugby</a>.<a href="#fn240" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref240"><sup>240</sup></a><a href="#fn241" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref241"><sup>241</sup></a></p>

<h2 id="statistics-and-records">Statistics and records</h2>

<p>According to a 2011 report by the Centre for the International Business of Sport at <a href="Coventry_University" title="wikilink">Coventry University</a>, there are now over five million people playing rugby union or one of its variants organised by the IRB.<a href="#fn255" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref255"><sup>255</sup></a> This is an increase of 19 percent since the previous report in 2007.<a href="#fn256" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref256"><sup>256</sup></a> The report also claimed that since 2007 participation has grown by 33 percent in Africa, 22 percent in South America and 18 percent in Asia and North America.<a href="#fn257" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref257"><sup>257</sup></a></p>

Popular writers who have used rugby union within their books are numerous. Thomas Hughes 1857 novel <a href="Tom_Brown&#39;s_Schooldays" title="wikilink">Tom Brown's Schooldays</a>, set in Rugby School, includes a recount of a rugby football match, which was then portrayed in the 1940s film of the same name. James Joyce mentions Irish team <a href="Bective_Rangers" title="wikilink">Bective Rangers</a> in several of his works, including Ulysses (1922) and Finnegans Wake (1939), while his 1916 semi-autobiographical work <em><a href="A_Portrait_of_the_Artist_as_a_Young_Man" title="wikilink">A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man</a></em> holds accounts of Ireland international <a href="James_Magee" title="wikilink">James Magee</a>.<a href="#fn269" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref269"><sup>269</sup></a> Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, in his 1924 Sherlock Holmes tale <em><a href="The_Adventure_of_the_Sussex_Vampire" title="wikilink">The Adventure of the Sussex Vampire</a></em>, mentions that Dr Watson played rugby for Blackheath.<a href="#fn270" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref270"><sup>270</sup></a></p>
<p>Rugby union was the subject of early sketches representing the sport, but was also explored by notable artists, especially by early 20th century French painters. French Post-Impressionist <a href="Henri_Rousseau" title="wikilink">Henri Rousseau</a>'s 1908 work <em>Joueurs de football</em> shows two pairs of rugby players competing.<a href="#fn271" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref271"><sup>271</sup></a> Other French artists to have represented the sport in their works include <a href="Albert_Gleizes" title="wikilink">Albert Gleizes</a>' <em>Les Joueurs de football</em> (1912), <a href="Robert_Delaunay" title="wikilink">Robert Delaunay</a>'s <em>Football.

<p>In television and film rugby union has been used as the backdrop to several productions. Ealing Studios' 1949 comedy <em><a href="A_Run_for_Your_Money" title="wikilink">A Run for Your Money</a></em> and the 1979 television film from BBC Wales <em><a href="Grand_Slam_(1978_film)" title="wikilink">Grand Slam</a></em> both centre on the fans attending a match rather than the sport itself.<a href="#fn274" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref274"><sup>274</sup></a> Films that explore the sport in more detail include independent production <em><a href="Old_Scores" title="wikilink">Old Scores</a></em> (1991) and <em><a href="Forever_Strong" title="wikilink">Forever Strong</a></em> (2008). <em><a href="Invictus_(film)" title="wikilink">Invictus</a></em> (2009), based on <a href="John_Carlin" title="wikilink">John Carlin</a>'s book <em>Playing the Enemy</em>, explores the events of the <a href="1995_Rugby_World_Cup" title="wikilink">1995 Rugby World Cup</a> and Nelson Mandela's attempt to use the sport to connect South Africa's people post-apartheid.<a href="#fn275" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref275"><sup>275</sup></a><a href="#fn276" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref276"><sup>276</sup></a></p>
<p>Many countries have erected statues depicting rugby union or rugby players.
