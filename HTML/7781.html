<p><strong><em>Final Fantasy VIII</em></strong> is a <a href="console_role-playing_game" title="wikilink">console role-playing game</a> created by <a href="Square_Co." title="wikilink">Square Co.</a> for the <a href="Sony_Computer_Entertainment" title="wikilink">Sony</a> <a href="PlayStation" class="uri" title="wikilink">PlayStation</a> and <a href="Microsoft_Windows" title="wikilink">Microsoft Windows</a>-based <a href="personal_computer" title="wikilink">PCs</a>. It is the eighth installment of the main <em><a href="Final_Fantasy" title="wikilink">Final Fantasy</a></em> series, the second to be released for the PlayStation, and the second to be <a href="porting" title="wikilink">ported</a> to Windows. Thirteen weeks after its release in <a href="1999_in_video_gaming" title="wikilink">1999</a>, <em>Final Fantasy VIII</em> had earned more than <a href="United_States_dollar" title="wikilink">US$</a>50 million in sales,<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a><a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> making it the fastest selling <em>Final Fantasy</em> title. <em>Final Fantasy VIII</em> has sold 7.86 million units worldwide as of May, 2006, making it the third best-selling title of the series, behind <em><a href="Final_Fantasy_X" title="wikilink">Final Fantasy X</a></em> and <em><a href="Final_Fantasy_VII" title="wikilink">Final Fantasy VII</a></em>.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> Additionally, <em>Final Fantasy VIII</em> was voted the 22nd-best game of all time by readers of the Japanese magazine <em><a href="Famitsu" class="uri" title="wikilink">Famitsu</a></em>.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p><em>Final Fantasy VIII</em> departed from many traditional standards of the series. It is the first game in the series to consistently use realistically proportioned characters, to feature a <a href="vocal_music" title="wikilink">vocal piece</a> as its <a href="theme_music" title="wikilink">theme song</a>, and to deviate from the series' traditional means of increasing a character's power.</p>
<h2 id="gameplay">Gameplay</h2>
<p><img src="Ff8_field_map_screenshot.png" title="fig:An example of navigation on the field map" alt="An example of navigation on the field map" width="200" /> Like <em>Final Fantasy VII</em>, <em>Final Fantasy VIII</em> consists of three main modes of play: the world map, the field map, and the battle screen. The world map is a <a href="3D_computer_graphics" title="wikilink">3D</a> display in which the player may navigate freely across a small-scale rendering of the game world. Characters travel across the field map in a variety of ways, including by foot, by car, by <a href="Chocobo" class="uri" title="wikilink">Chocobo</a>, and by <a href="List_of_airships_in_the_Final_Fantasy_series#Final_Fantasy_VIII" title="wikilink">airship</a>. The field map consists of controllable 3D characters overlaid on one or more <a href="2D_computer_graphics" title="wikilink">2D</a> <a href="pre-rendered" class="uri" title="wikilink">pre-rendered</a> backgrounds, which represent environmental locations such as towns or forests. The battle screen is a 3D model of a location such as a street or room, where turn-based fights between playable characters and <a href="Central_processing_unit" title="wikilink">CPU</a>-controlled enemies take place. The interface is menu-driven, as in previous titles, but with the typical weapon and armor systems removed and new features present, such as the Junction system and a collectible card-based <a href="minigame" class="uri" title="wikilink">minigame</a> called &quot;<a href="Triple_Triad" title="wikilink">Triple Triad</a>&quot;.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="junction-system">Junction system</h3>
<p>This new system revolves around summonable monsters, called &quot;<a href="Magic_in_the_Final_Fantasy_series#Summon_magic" title="wikilink">Guardian Forces</a>&quot; (GFs). A character must have a GF assigned to them (&quot;junctioned&quot;) before he or she can use several standard <em>Final Fantasy</em> battle command abilities, such as &quot;Magic&quot;, &quot;GF&quot; (summoning), and &quot;Item&quot;. Only &quot;Attack&quot; can be performed without a GF. While previous <em>Final Fantasy</em> titles used a limited pool of Magic Points (MP) that were consumed by each spell to restrict unlimited magic use, in <em>Final Fantasy VIII</em>, spells are &quot;drawn&quot; from enemies and special Draw Points distributed throughout the game's environments. Additionally, certain GF abilities allow players to &quot;refine&quot; magical spells from items. Spells are then stocked on characters as quantified inventory (restricted to 100 at a time) and are consumed one at a time when used. GFs allow characters to &quot;junction&quot; these spells to their own <a href="Attribute_(role-playing_games)" title="wikilink">statistics</a> — such as &quot;Strength&quot; and &quot;Vitality&quot; — for various bonuses.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p>The flexibility of this system makes it possible to build a powerful party early in the game. This alternative use of GFs was a significant departure for the <em>Final Fantasy</em> series, as summoned creatures were previously used almost exclusively to deliver a single devastating attack during battles. Furthermore, the system replaced the equipable weapons, armor, and accessories of previous games with an unequipable, specialized weapon for each character. A limited number of upgrades can be performed on each character's weapon throughout the game, increasing its power and altering its appearance.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="limit-breaks">Limit Breaks</h3>
<p>As in <em>Final Fantasy VII</em>, each character has unique special attacks called &quot;<a href="Limit_Break#Limit_Breaks_in_Final_Fantasy_VIII" title="wikilink">Limit Breaks</a>&quot; (&quot;Special Arts&quot; in the original Japanese version). Whereas Limit Breaks in <em>Final Fantasy VII</em> are triggered by accumulating a set amount of damage, in <em>Final Fantasy VIII</em> they are randomly available every turn when the character's health (Hit Points, or HP) is below 32% of its current maximum (84% in <a href="Seifer_Almasy" title="wikilink">Seifer Almasy</a>'s case). This system is similar to the <a href="Limit_Break#Limit_Breaks_in_Final_Fantasy_VI" title="wikilink">Desperation Attacks</a> from <em><a href="Final_Fantasy_VI" title="wikilink">Final Fantasy VI</a></em>, which are triggered on rare occasions when a character is near death. The magic spell <em>Aura</em> increases the probability of Limit Breaks appearing, regardless of a character's remaining Hit Points.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p>Another change is that most of the main characters' special techniques feature interactive elements, ranging from a <a href="slot_machine" title="wikilink">slot machine</a> design to <a href="fighting_game" title="wikilink">fighting game</a>-style button inputs. These elements, which are dependent on the character and the nature of the Limit Break, can be used to increase the potency of the attack.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="experience-levels">Experience levels</h3>
<p><img src="Ff8_battle_screenshot_xma1(edited).png" title="fig:The Guardian Force Shiva being summoned in a battle with an early boss" alt="The Guardian Force Shiva being summoned in a battle with an early boss" width="200" /> As in most role-playing games and most <em>Final Fantasy</em> games, <a href="experience_point" title="wikilink">experience points</a> are awarded following successful battles. When a character accumulates 1000 experience points, he or she gains a &quot;level&quot;, which increases that character's base statistics. Unlike previous <em>Final Fantasy</em> games, however, randomly encountered enemies have no set level — their levels increase alongside those of the playable characters. Higher-level enemies are capable of inflicting and withstanding significantly more damage, and may have additional special attacks. Statistic increases from &quot;leveling up&quot; are minuscule compared with those that are available through the Junction system.</p>
<p>In addition to gaining levels, Guardian Forces earn Ability Points (AP) after battles, which is allocated to special abilities that Guardian Forces can learn. When a GF has learned an ability, that ability becomes available for any character — and, in some cases, the entire character party — to use. Through learned abilities, GFs can receive attack enhancements in battle, refine magical spells from items, provide bonuses to characters when leveling up, and add battle commands.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a><a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="plot">Plot</h2>
<h3 id="setting">Setting</h3>

<p><img src="FFviii_world_map_1.png" title="fig:Map of Final Fantasy VIII&#39;s world" alt="Map of Final Fantasy VIII&#39;s world" width="200" /> The majority of <em>Final Fantasy VIII</em> is set on a large, unnamed world with one moon. The planet comprises five major landmasses, with the largest (<a href="List_of_Final_Fantasy_VIII_locations#Eastern_continent" title="wikilink">Esthar</a>) covering most of the eastern and northeastern portions of the map. The second largest continent (<a href="List_of_Final_Fantasy_VIII_locations#Western_continent" title="wikilink">Galbadia</a>) lies to the west, and contains many of the game's locations. Positioned roughly in the middle of the world map lies the smallest continent (<a href="List_of_Final_Fantasy_VIII_locations#Balamb_Island" title="wikilink">Balamb</a>), the large island on which the game begins. The remaining two landmasses are smaller and mostly desolate, riddled with rough, rocky terrain caused by the impact of a Lunar Cry.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a><a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> The southernmost landmass is long and thin, while the other, a short distance north, is an <a href="archipelago" class="uri" title="wikilink">archipelago</a> of broken sections of land that have drifted apart. Islands and marine structures flesh out the rest of the game world, and a smattering of off-world locations round out the game's playable areas.</p>
<p>As part of a theme desired by director <a href="Yoshinori_Kitase" title="wikilink">Yoshinori Kitase</a> to give the game a foreign atmosphere, various designs were given to its locations using the style of internationally familiar places, while also maintaining a <a href="fantasy" class="uri" title="wikilink">fantasy</a> atmosphere. Inspiration ranged from <a href="Ancient_Egypt" title="wikilink">ancient Egyptian</a> and <a href="Ancient_Greek" title="wikilink">Greek</a> architecture, to the city of <a href="Paris" class="uri" title="wikilink">Paris</a>, <a href="France" class="uri" title="wikilink">France</a>, to an idealized futuristic <a href="European" class="uri" title="wikilink">European</a> society.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>

<p><img src="GunbladeopeningFFVIII.jpg" title="fig:Squall&#39;s gunblade, as seen in the game&#39;s opening credits" alt="Squall&#39;s gunblade, as seen in the game&#39;s opening credits" width="150" /> During the game's pre-production, character designer <a href="Tetsuya_Nomura" title="wikilink">Tetsuya Nomura</a> suggested that the game be given a &quot;school days&quot; feel. As scenario writer <a href="Kazushige_Nojima" title="wikilink">Kazushige Nojima</a> already had a story in mind in which the main characters were the same age, the ideas meshed, taking form as the <a href="Garden_(Final_Fantasy_VIII)" title="wikilink">Garden</a> military academies. Nojima planned that the two playable parties featured in the game (Squall's present day group and Laguna Loire's group from the past) would be highly contrasted with one another. This idea was conveyed through the age and experience of Laguna's group, versus the youth and inexperience of Squall's group.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
<p>In keeping with the game's theme of a foreign atmosphere, the objective of the character designs was that they have predominantly European appearances. The first <em>Final Fantasy VIII</em> character that was designed according to this theme was Squall. Desiring to add a unique angle to Squall's appearance, to emphasise his role as the central character, Nomura gave him a <a href="List_of_weapons_in_the_Final_Fantasy_series#Gunblade" title="wikilink">gunblade</a> scar across his brow and the bridge of his nose. As there was not yet a detailed history conceived for the character, Nomura left the explanation for Squall's scar to Nojima. Squall himself was given a gunblade, a fictional <a href="revolver" class="uri" title="wikilink">revolver</a>–<a href="sword" class="uri" title="wikilink">sword</a> hybrid that functions primarily as a sword, with an added damaging vibration feature activated by use of its gun mechanism,<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> and his design was completed by a feather motif along the collar of his jacket, included by Nomura for the purpose of challenging the game's <a href="Full_motion_video" title="wikilink">FMV</a> designers to take full advantage of the game's graphics engine.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
<p><img src="Tetsuya_Nomura--Edea_Kramer.jpg" title="fig:Tetsuya Nomura&#39;s design of &quot;the Witch&quot;, Edea" alt="Tetsuya Nomura&#39;s design of &quot;the Witch&quot;, Edea" width="200" /> Nomura ended up altering each character's appearance before s/he reached the final design stage, which required sacrificing his original intentions. For instance, he had originally wanted Seifer Almasy to be involved in a love triangle with Rinoa and Squall. As another example, Quistis was to originally be designed with a skirt, but in the end was given a long skirt worn over pants. With Rinoa wearing a mini-skirt over shorts, this led to a conflict with the intended notion that one of the main female characters would wear a skirt. A compromise was made in this regard with Selphie's design: she was originally intended to be wearing overalls, but Nomura decided that her outfit should be something of a combination of the two. Finally, when designing Rinoa, Nomura decided to avoid the temptation of FMV technology by making her &quot;cute&quot; and full of personality, instead of &quot;too beautiful&quot;.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a></p>
<p>With <em>Final Fantasy VIII</em> came the inclusion of three designs Nomura had previously drawn, but had not yet used in a <em>Final Fantasy</em> game. These included the designs of Edea, <a href="List_of_Final_Fantasy_VIII_characters#Fujin" title="wikilink">Fujin</a> and <a href="List_of_Final_Fantasy_VIII_characters#Raijin" title="wikilink">Raijin</a>. The latter two had originally been designed for use in <em>Final Fantasy VII</em>, but with the inclusion of that games <a href="Turks_(Final_Fantasy_VII)" title="wikilink">Turks</a> characters, it was felt that Fujin and Raijin were unnecessary. Edea had been a design that Nomura created prior to even <em>Final Fantasy VII</em>'s development, based on the style of <a href="Yoshitaka_Amano" title="wikilink">Yoshitaka Amano</a>.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>
<p>In addition to designing all of the game's characters, Tetsuya Nomura designed all of its Guardian Forces. Aware that there was a type of &quot;training&quot; involved with their role in the game, Nomura decided to give them all features that distanced them from human beings and gave them more the appearance of mystical creatures, even in the rare cases of the game's humanoid GFs.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> {{-}}</p>
<h3 id="story">Story</h3>
<p><img src="SeifervsSquall.jpg" title="fig:Seifer knocks Squall to the ground with a Fire spell during an early duel" alt="Seifer knocks Squall to the ground with a Fire spell during an early duel" width="200" /> The story of <em>Final Fantasy VIII</em> opens as protagonist Squall Leonhart duels with his rival, Seifer Almasy, in a training session outside the military academy known as &quot;<a href="Garden_(Final_Fantasy_VIII)" title="wikilink">Garden</a>&quot;. During the bout, the two cadets scar one another's faces and are returned to Garden for treatment.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> Meanwhile, the <a href="List_of_Final_Fantasy_VIII_locations#Western_continent" title="wikilink">Galbadian</a> regime, led by <a href="List_of_Final_Fantasy_VIII_characters#Vinzer_Deling" title="wikilink">Vinzer Deling</a>, invades the <a href="List_of_Final_Fantasy_VIII_locations#Western_continent" title="wikilink">Dollet Dukedom</a>, forcing Dollet to hire the <a href="Garden_(Final_Fantasy_VIII)#Balamb_Garden" title="wikilink">Balamb Garden</a> branch of SeeD &lt;U+2014&gt; Garden's elite mercenary force &lt;U+2014&gt; for aid. SeeD uses the mission as a field examination for its graduation-eligible cadets,<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> and with the help of his instructor, Quistis Trepe, Squall passes its prerequisite. While SeeD prepares for the assault, Squall is assigned to an attack squad with Zell Dincht and Seifer. In Dollet, Seifer abandons his team halfway through the mission, forcing Selphie Tilmitt to accompany Squall and Zell for the duration. After the player completes the mission, SeeD halts the Galbadian advance, and Squall, Zell and Selphie graduate to SeeD status while Seifer is disciplined for acting independently.</p>
<p>Shortly after graduating, Squall meets a young woman named &quot;Rinoa Heartilly&quot;, whose attitude and approach to life are apparently the opposite of his own. Assigned to help her Galbadian-resistance on his first mission, along with Zell and Selphie, Squall learns that a <a href="Magic_(paranormal)" title="wikilink">sorceress</a> named &quot;Edea&quot; is the mastermind behind Galbadia's hostilities. Edea soon kills Deling, turning Galbadia into an imperial dictatorship.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> Under orders from both <a href="Garden_(Final_Fantasy_VIII)#Galbadia_Garden" title="wikilink">Galbadia</a> and Balamb's Gardens, Squall and his comrades — now joined by Quistis and sharpshooter Irvine Kinneas — attempt to assassinate the sorceress. Despite a nearly flawless execution of the plan &lt;U+2014&gt; arranged by Galbadia's own <a href="List_of_Final_Fantasy_VIII_characters#General_Caraway" title="wikilink">General Caraway</a>, Rinoa's father &lt;U+2014&gt; the party is defeated and imprisoned. Moreover, Squall's party learns that Seifer has now left Garden and become Edea's second-in-command.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a></p>
<p><img src="FF8War2.jpg" title="fig:Students from Balamb Garden battle Galbadian soldiers" alt="Students from Balamb Garden battle Galbadian soldiers" width="200" /> After escaping prison, the team splits into two units, both of which are controlled by the player in seperate scenerios. Squall's group stops an internal conflict at Balamb Garden incited by <a href="List_of_Final_Fantasy_VIII_characters#NORG" title="wikilink">NORG</a>, SeeD's financial supporter, while Selphie's squad fails to prevent a Galbadian missile attack on Balamb and <a href="Garden_(Final_Fantasy_VIII)#Trabia_Garden" title="wikilink">Trabia Gardens</a>. The missile launch forces Squall to turn Balamb Garden into a mobile fortress to avoid the attack, leaving the facility temporarily uncontrollable until it collides with the docks at <a href="List_of_Final_Fantasy_VIII_locations#Other" title="wikilink">Fisherman's Horizon</a> in the middle of the ocean. While Squall negotiates with the mayor of the town, Galbadia invades in search of a girl named &quot;<a href="List_of_Final_Fantasy_VIII_characters#Ellone" title="wikilink">Ellone</a>&quot;, who had been staying at the Garden until recently.</p>
<p>Throughout the game, Ellone sends Squall and his allies into a series of flashbacks set seventeen years in the past. The scenes center on a man named &quot;Laguna&quot; and his two friends, Kiros and Ward. During the flashbacks, Laguna transitions from Galbadian soldier to the self-appointed defender of a small country village, and then to the president of <a href="List_of_Final_Fantasy_VIII_locations#Eastern_continent" title="wikilink">Esthar</a>, the game's technological superpower.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Squall deals with personal conflicts fueled by the game's ongoing developments.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> Among these are Balamb Garden's <a href="List_of_Final_Fantasy_VIII_characters#Cid_Kramer" title="wikilink">Headmaster Cid</a> appointing him as SeeD's new leader,<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> and his increasing love for Rinoa. Squall particularly struggles with the latter, as he had previously shut out all feelings of affection due to a fear of becoming vulnerable.</p>
<p>As Edea and Seifer continue sweeping the world in search of Ellone, matters are complicated further during an investigation of Trabia Garden's ruins. Squall and his comrades learn that — with the exception of Rinoa — they were raised along with Seifer and Ellone in an <a href="orphanage" class="uri" title="wikilink">orphanage</a> run by Edea, and later developed amnesia due to their use of Guardian Forces. Furthermore, it is revealed that Edea is Cid's wife, and together the two had founded Garden and SeeD to defeat evil sorceresses.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a></p>
<p>Later in the game, the full forces of Balamb Garden and the Galbadian army (using the now-mobilized Galbadia Garden), led by Squall and Seifer respectively, engage in conflict. After Balamb defeats Galbadia, the player learns that Edea is merely an unwilling tool for a greater sorceress known as &quot;<a href="List_of_Final_Fantasy_VIII_characters#Ultimecia" title="wikilink">Ultimecia</a>&quot;, who resides in the future and wishes to achieve Time Compression. This spell would grant her dominion over all time and space, and it is for this reason she has sought Ellone.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a><a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a></p>
<p><img src="SnRembracescene.JPG" title="fig:Squall and Rinoa embrace after he frees her from confinement in Esthar" alt="Squall and Rinoa embrace after he frees her from confinement in Esthar" width="200" /> A conclusive battle with Edea forces Ultimecia to transfer her powers to Rinoa, allowing Edea to survive but leaving Rinoa frozen in a deep coma. Squall becomes obsessed with waking her and seeks the help of <a href="List_of_Final_Fantasy_VIII_characters#Dr._Odine" title="wikilink">Dr. Odine</a>, a renowned scientist living in Esthar. However, while Rinoa is being treated on Esthar's space station, Ultimecia uses her to free <a href="List_of_Final_Fantasy_VIII_characters#Adel" title="wikilink">Adel</a>, an imprisoned sorceress responsible for the war of seventeen years past. Ultimecia then orders Seifer to activate Esthar's <a href="List_of_Final_Fantasy_VIII_locations#Eastern_continent" title="wikilink">Lunatic Pandora</a> facility, inciting a rain of monsters from the moon in a phenomenon called the &quot;Lunar Cry&quot;. This brings Adel's containment device from space to the planet's surface, while simultaneously leaving Esthar swarming with monsters.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a></p>
<p>Ultimecia — preparing to possess Adel — abandons Rinoa in the void of outer space. Squall dives after her, but the two are stranded until they encounter a derelict spaceship. After using it to return to the planet's surface, they are approached by delegates from Esthar, who lock Rinoa away in fear of her sorceress abilities.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> Squall and his companions rescue Rinoa and finally meet Laguna, revealed to be Ellone's adopted father. Together with Dr. Odine, a plan is devised to let Ultimecia use Ellone to compress time, as it would allow Squall's group to confront Ultimecia in her own era. As Time Compression begins, Squall is forced to duel Seifer once again and kill Adel when she attempts to assimilate Rinoa. With their friendship serving as their bond to reality, Squall and his friends immunize themselves to the effects of Time Compression, travel to Ultimecia's era and defeat her.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a></p>
<p>As Ultimecia is defeated, the universe begins returning to normal, and Squall is nearly lost in the flow of time as he witnesses the origins of the game's entire story. When a dying Ultimecia travels back in time to pass her powers to Edea thirteen years in Squall's past, he informs Edea of the concepts of Garden and SeeD that she will create. Afterward, he is warped away into the timestream and is unable to find his own way back to the present until he is rescued by Rinoa. At the end of the game, SeeD holds a banquet to celebrate their victory, and Squall is shown kissing Rinoa.</p>

<p>Developed from 1997 to early 1999, <em>Final Fantasy VIII</em>'s production began around the time of <em>Final Fantasy VII</em>'s <a href="English_language" title="wikilink">English</a> translation.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> As with much of <em>Final Fantasy VII</em>'s production, series creator <a href="Hironobu_Sakaguchi" title="wikilink">Hironobu Sakaguchi</a> served only as producer, working primarily on the development of <em><a href="Final_Fantasy:_The_Spirits_Within" title="wikilink">Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within</a></em> and leaving direction of <em>Final Fantasy VIII</em> to Yoshinori Kitase.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a></p>
<p>From the beginning, Kitase knew he wanted a thematic combination of fantasy and realism. To this end, he aimed to include a cast of characters who appeared to be ordinary people. Character designer Tetsuya Nomura and art director <a href="Yusuke_Naora" title="wikilink">Yusuke Naora</a> strove to achieve this impression through the inclusion of realistically proportioned characters — a departure from the chibi designs used in all past installments. Additionally, Naora attempted to enhance the realism of the world through predominantly bright lighting effects with shadows distributed as appropriate. Other measures taken included implementing rental cars for travel in-game,<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> and the use of <a href="motion_capture" title="wikilink">motion capture</a> technology to give the game's characters lifelike movements in the game's FMV sequences.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a></p>
<p>Scenario writer Kazushige Nojima has expressed that the dynamic of players' relationships with the protagonist is important to him. Both <em>Final Fantasy VII</em> and <em>Final Fantasy VIII</em> feature reserved, quiet protagonists in the form of <a href="Cloud_Strife" title="wikilink">Cloud Strife</a> and Squall. With <em>Final Fantasy VIII</em>, however, Nojima worked to give players actual insight into what the character was thinking — a direct contrast with his handling of <em>Final Fantasy VII</em>'s script, which encouraged the player to speculate.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> This approach to <em>Final Fantasy VIII</em> is reflected by the frequent use of dialogue that takes place solely within Squall's mind, allowing the player to read his thoughts and understand what he is thinking or feeling even when he keeps those thoughts to himself.</p>
<p>In 2000, a <a href="personal_computer" title="wikilink">PC</a> version of <em>Final Fantasy VIII</em> was <a href="porting" title="wikilink">ported</a> to <a href="Microsoft_Windows" title="wikilink">Windows</a>. This rerelease featured smoother graphics, enhanced audio, and the inclusion of <em><a href="Chocobo_World" title="wikilink">Chocobo World</a></em>, a <a href="minigame" class="uri" title="wikilink">minigame</a> starring Boko, a Chocobo featured in one of <em>Final Fantasy VIII</em>'s <a href="Quest_(gaming)#Side-quest" title="wikilink">side-quests</a>. For most North American and European players, the PC version of the game was the only means of playing <em>Chocobo World</em>, as the game was originally designed to be played via the <a href="PocketStation" class="uri" title="wikilink">PocketStation</a>, a handheld console never released outside Japan.</p>
<h2 id="audio">Audio</h2>

<p>Regular series composer <a href="Nobuo_Uematsu" title="wikilink">Nobuo Uematsu</a> wrote and directed <a href="Final_Fantasy_VIII:_Original_Soundtrack" title="wikilink">the soundtrack for <em>Final Fantasy VIII</em></a>, which was released on four <a href="Compact_Disc" title="wikilink">Compact Discs</a> by <a href="DigiCube" class="uri" title="wikilink">DigiCube</a> in Japan, and by <a href="Square_Electronic_Arts" title="wikilink">Square EA</a> in North America. Additionally, a special <a href="orchestra" title="wikilink">orchestral</a> <a href="arrangement" class="uri" title="wikilink">arrangement</a> of selected tracks from the game &lt;U+2014&gt; performed by <a href="Shiro_Hamaguchi" title="wikilink">Shiro Hamaguchi</a> &lt;U+2014&gt; was released under the title <em><a href="FITHOS_LUSEC_WECOS_VINOSEC:_Final_Fantasy_VIII" title="wikilink">FITHOS LUSEC WECOS VINOSEC</a></em>.</p>
<p>The score is best known for two songs: &quot;<a href="Liberi_Fatali" title="wikilink">Liberi Fatali</a>&quot;, a <a href="Latin" class="uri" title="wikilink">Latin</a> <a href="choir" title="wikilink">choral</a> piece that is played during the introduction to the game, and &quot;<a href="Eyes_On_Me" title="wikilink">Eyes On Me</a>&quot;, a <a href="popular_music" title="wikilink">pop song</a> serving as the game's theme, performed by <a href="China" title="wikilink">Chinese</a> singer <a href="Faye_Wong" title="wikilink">Faye Wong</a>. The latter song was released as a <a href="CD_single" title="wikilink">CD single</a> in Japan and sold over 400,000 copies,<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> placing it as the best-selling <a href="video_game_music" title="wikilink">video game music</a> disc ever released in that country until the release of &quot;Hikari&quot; by <a href="Utada_Hikaru" title="wikilink">Utada Hikaru</a> for <em><a href="Kingdom_Hearts" title="wikilink">Kingdom Hearts</a></em>. &quot;Liberi Fatali&quot; and &quot;Fithos Lusec Wecos Vinosec&quot;, another choral piece, were played during the <a href="2004_Summer_Olympics" title="wikilink">2004 Summer Olympics</a> in <a href="Athens" class="uri" title="wikilink">Athens</a> during the women's synchronized swimming event. {{-}}</p>

<p>Within two days of its North American release on <a href="September_9" title="wikilink">September 9</a>, <a href="1999_in_video_gaming" title="wikilink">1999</a>, <em>Final Fantasy VIII</em> became the top-selling video game in the United States, a position it held for more than three weeks.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> Aside from grossing a total of more than $50 million within the first 13 weeks to follow,<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a><a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> in Japan, it sold roughly 2.5 million units within the first four days of release,<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> and during 2006 was voted by readers of Japanese magazine <em>Famitsu</em> as the twenty-second best game of all time.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a></p>
<p>Reviews of <em>Final Fantasy VIII</em>'s gameplay have been mixed. Multimedia news website <a href="IGN" class="uri" title="wikilink">IGN</a> felt that it was the weakest aspect of the game, citing its Guardian Force attack sequences as &quot;incredibly cinematic&quot; but tedious,<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a> sentiments echoed by <em><a href="Electronic_Gaming_Monthly" title="wikilink">Electronic Gaming Monthly</a></em>.<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> They also regarded the battle system as intensely complicated, yet refreshingly innovative and something that &quot;RPG fanatics love to obssess over&quot;.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a> <em><a href="Official_PlayStation_Magazine" title="wikilink">Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine</a></em> claims that the game's Junction system is a major flaw due to repetitive stocking of spells,<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a> while the <a href="United_Kingdom" title="wikilink">UK</a>-based <a href="Video_game_magazine" title="wikilink">magazine</a> <em><a href="Edge_(magazine)" title="wikilink">Edge</a></em> comments that the battle system consists of a &quot;bewildering&quot; number of intricate options and techniques that &quot;most gamers will... relish&quot;.<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a> <a href="GameSpot" class="uri" title="wikilink">GameSpot</a> praised the game's battle system, commenting that the &quot;possibilities for customization [with the Junction system] are immense&quot;.<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a></p>
<p>Critics have compared the other aspects of the game to previous <em>Final Fantasy</em> installments, as well. Gaming Age cited the storyline and graphics as two major improvements over <em>Final Fantasy VII</em>, while considering the music &quot;hardly a step up...&quot;.<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a> Though questioning the game's lack of voice overs for its characters, Game Revolution praised its storyline and ending.<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a> For their part, <em>Edge</em> labeled <em>Final Fantasy VIII</em> &quot;... a far more accomplished game than <em>FFVII</em>&quot;. On the other hand, the magazine also felt that the game's length left its story unable to &quot;offer consistently strong dialogue and sub-plots&quot;. Additionally, it found some of the story's plot twists &quot;not... suitably manipulated and prepared&quot;, leaving it &quot;hard not to greet such... moments with anything but indifference&quot;. Overall, <em>Edge</em> considered <em>Final Fantasy VIII</em> to be &quot;yet another outstanding edition of SquareSoft's far-from-final fantasies&quot;, summarizing it as &quot;Aesthetically astonishing, rarely less than compelling, and near peerless in scope and execution...&quot;.<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a> <em>Electronic Gaming Monthly</em> offered similar comments, stating that the game's character development &quot;is the best of any RPG's...&quot; and that &quot;<em>Final Fantasy VIII</em> is the pinnacle of its genre&quot;.<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a></p>
