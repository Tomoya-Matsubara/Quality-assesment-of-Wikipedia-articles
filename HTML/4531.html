<p><strong>Charles Milles Manson</strong> (born November 12, 1934) is an American criminal who led what became known as the Manson Family, a quasi-<a href="commune" class="uri" title="wikilink">commune</a> that arose in California in the late 1960s.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a><a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a><a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> He was found guilty of <a href="conspiracy_(crime)" title="wikilink">conspiracy</a> to commit the <a href="Sharon_Tate" title="wikilink">Tate</a>/<a href="Leno_and_Rosemary_LaBianca" title="wikilink">LaBianca</a> murders carried out by members of the group at his instruction. He was convicted of the murders through the joint-responsibility rule, which makes each member of a conspiracy guilty of crimes his fellow conspirators commit in furtherance of the conspiracy's object.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a><a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>Manson is associated with &quot;<a href="Helter_Skelter_(Manson_scenario)" title="wikilink">Helter Skelter</a>,&quot; a term he took from the song &quot;<a href="Helter_Skelter_(song)" title="wikilink">Helter Skelter</a>,&quot; written and recorded by <a href="The_Beatles" title="wikilink">The Beatles</a>. Manson misconstrued the lyrics to be about an <a href="apocalypse" title="wikilink">apocalyptic</a> <a href="race_war" title="wikilink">race war</a> he believed the murders were intended to precipitate. From the beginning of his notoriety, this connection with rock music linked him with a <a href="pop_culture" title="wikilink">pop culture</a> in which he ultimately became an emblem of insanity, violence and the <a href="macabre" class="uri" title="wikilink">macabre</a>. The term was later used by Manson prosecutor <a href="Vincent_Bugliosi" title="wikilink">Vincent Bugliosi</a> as the title of <a href="Helter_Skelter_(book)" title="wikilink">a book</a> he wrote about the Manson murders.</p>
<p>At the time the Family began to form, Manson was an unemployed <a href="ex-convict" class="uri" title="wikilink">ex-convict</a>, who had spent half of his life in correctional institutions for a variety of offenses. Before the murders, he was a singer-songwriter on the fringe of the Los Angeles music industry, chiefly through a chance association with <a href="Dennis_Wilson" title="wikilink">Dennis Wilson</a>, founding member and drummer of <a href="The_Beach_Boys" title="wikilink">The Beach Boys</a>. After Manson was charged with the crimes he was later convicted of, recordings of songs written and performed by him were released commercially. Artists, including <a href="Guns_N&#39;_Roses" title="wikilink">Guns N' Roses</a> and <a href="Marilyn_Manson" title="wikilink">Marilyn Manson</a>, have <a href="cover_version" title="wikilink">covered</a> his songs.</p>
<p>Manson's <a href="Capital_punishment" title="wikilink">death sentence</a> was automatically <a href="Commutation_of_sentence" title="wikilink">commuted</a> to <a href="life_imprisonment" title="wikilink">life imprisonment</a> when a 1972 decision by the <a href="Supreme_Court_of_California" title="wikilink">Supreme Court of California</a> temporarily eliminated the state's death penalty.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> California's eventual reinstatement of <a href="capital_punishment" title="wikilink">capital punishment</a> did not affect Manson, who is currently incarcerated at <a href="Corcoran_State_Prison" title="wikilink">Corcoran State Prison</a>.</p>
<h2 id="early-life">Early life</h2>
<h3 id="childhood">Childhood</h3>
<p>Born to an unmarried 16-year-old named Kathleen Maddox, in <a href="Cincinnati" class="uri" title="wikilink">Cincinnati</a> General Hospital, <a href="Ohio" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ohio</a>, Manson was first dubbed &quot;no name Maddox.&quot;<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a><a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a><a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> Within weeks, he was <em>Charles Milles</em> Maddox.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a><a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a><a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> For a period after his birth, his mother was married to a laborer named William Manson,<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> whose last name the boy was given. The boy's biological father appears to have been a &quot;Colonel Scott,&quot; against whom Kathleen Maddox filed a <a href="Legitimacy_(law)" title="wikilink">bastardy</a> suit that resulted in an <a href="stipulated_judgment" title="wikilink">agreed judgment</a> in 1937.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> Possibly, the boy never really knew him.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a><a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
<p>Several statements in Manson's 1951 case file from the seven months he would later spend at the <a href="National_Training_School_for_Boys" title="wikilink">National Training School for Boys</a> in Washington, D.C., allude to the possibility that &quot;Colonel Scott&quot; was African American.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> These include the first two sentences of his family background section, which read: &quot;Father: unknown. He is alleged to have been a <a href="colored" class="uri" title="wikilink">colored</a> cook by the name of Scott, with whom the boy's mother had been <a href="promiscuous" class="uri" title="wikilink">promiscuous</a> at the time of pregnancy.&quot;<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> When asked about these official records by attorney Vincent Bugliosi in 1971, Manson emphatically denied that his biological father had African American ancestry.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a></p>
<p>In the quasi-autobiography, <em><a href="Manson_in_His_Own_Words" title="wikilink">Manson in His Own Words</a></em>, Colonel Scott is said to have been &quot;a young <a href="drugstore_cowboy" title="wikilink">drugstore cowboy</a> ... a <a href="transient_laborer" title="wikilink">transient laborer</a> working on a nearby dam project.&quot; It is not clear what &quot;nearby&quot; means. The description is in a paragraph that indicates Kathleen Maddox gave birth to Manson &quot;while living in <a href="Cincinnati" class="uri" title="wikilink">Cincinnati</a>,&quot; after she had run away from her own home, in <a href="Ashland,_Kentucky" title="wikilink">Ashland, Kentucky</a>.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>
<p>Manson's mother was allegedly a <a href="alcoholic" title="wikilink">heavy drinker</a>.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> According to a family member, she once sold her son for a pitcher of beer to a childless waitress, from whom his uncle retrieved him some days later.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> When Manson's mother and her brother were sentenced to five years' imprisonment for robbing a <a href="Charleston,_West_Virginia" title="wikilink">Charleston, West Virginia</a>, service station in 1939, Manson was placed in the home of an aunt and uncle in <a href="McMechen,_West_Virginia" title="wikilink">McMechen, West Virginia</a>. Upon her 1942 <a href="parole" class="uri" title="wikilink">parole</a>, Kathleen retrieved her son and lived with him in run-down hotel rooms.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> Manson himself later characterized her physical embrace of him on the day she returned from prison as his sole happy childhood memory.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1947, Kathleen Maddox tried to have her son placed in a <a href="Foster_care" title="wikilink">foster home</a> but failed because no such home was available.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> The court placed Manson in <a href="Gibault_School_for_Boys" title="wikilink">Gibault School for Boys</a>, in <a href="Terre_Haute,_Indiana" title="wikilink">Terre Haute, Indiana</a>. After 10 months, he fled from there to his mother, who rejected him.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="first-offenses">First offenses</h3>
<p>By committing burglary of a <a href="grocery_store" title="wikilink">grocery store</a>, Manson obtained cash that enabled him to rent a room.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> A string of burglaries of other stores, including one from which he stole a bicycle, ended when he was caught in the act. He was sent to an <a href="Indianapolis" class="uri" title="wikilink">Indianapolis</a> juvenile center. His escape after one day led to his recapture and his placement in <a href="Girls_and_Boys_Town" title="wikilink">Boys Town</a>. Four days after his arrival there, he escaped with another boy. The pair committed two <a href="armed_robbery" title="wikilink">armed robberies</a> on their way to the home of the other boy's uncle.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a></p>
<p>Caught during the second of two subsequent break-ins of grocery stores, Manson was sent, at age 13, to the <a href="Plainfield_Juvenile_Correctional_Facility" title="wikilink">Indiana Boys School</a>, where, he would later claim, he was <a href="sexual_abuse" title="wikilink">brutalized sexually</a> and otherwise.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> After many failed attempts, he escaped with two other boys in 1951.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a></p>
<p>In <a href="Utah" class="uri" title="wikilink">Utah</a>, the three were caught driving to California in cars they had stolen. They had burglarized several <a href="gas_station" title="wikilink">gas stations</a> along the way. For the <a href="federal_crime" title="wikilink">federal crime</a> of taking a stolen car across a state line, Manson was sent to Washington, D.C.'s <a href="National_Training_School_for_Boys" title="wikilink">National Training School for Boys</a>. Despite four years of schooling and an <a href="Intelligence_quotient" title="wikilink">I.Q.</a> of 109 (later tested at 121),<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> he was <a href="illiterate" class="uri" title="wikilink">illiterate</a>. A <a href="caseworker_(social_work)" title="wikilink">caseworker</a> deemed him aggressively <a href="Antisocial_personality_disorder" title="wikilink">antisocial</a>.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="first-imprisonment">First imprisonment</h3>
<p>In October 1951, on a psychiatrist's recommendation, Manson was transferred to <a href="Natural_Bridge_Honor_Camp" title="wikilink">Natural Bridge Honor Camp</a>, a minimum security institution. Less than a month before a scheduled February 1952 <a href="parole" class="uri" title="wikilink">parole</a> hearing, he &quot;took a razor blade and held it against another boy's throat while he <a href="sodomy" title="wikilink">sodomized</a> him.&quot;<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a><a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> He was transferred to the Federal Reformatory, <a href="Petersburg,_Virginia" title="wikilink">Petersburg, Virginia</a>, where he was considered &quot;dangerous.&quot;<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> In September 1952, a number of other serious disciplinary offenses resulted in his transfer to the <a href="Chillicothe_Correctional_Institution" title="wikilink">Federal Reformatory</a> at <a href="Chillicothe,_Ohio" title="wikilink">Chillicothe</a>, Ohio, a more secure institution.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> About a month after the transfer, he became almost a model resident. Good work habits and a rise in his educational level from the lower fourth to the upper seventh grade won him a May 1954 parole.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a></p>
<p>After temporarily honoring a parole condition that he live with his aunt and uncle in <a href="West_Virginia" title="wikilink">West Virginia</a>, Manson moved in with his mother in that same state. In January 1955, he married a hospital waitress named <a href="Rosalie_Jean_Willis" title="wikilink">Rosalie Jean Willis</a>, with whom, by his own account, he found genuine, if short-lived, marital happiness.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> He supported their marriage via small-time jobs and <a href="motor_vehicle_theft" title="wikilink">auto theft</a>.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a></p>
<p>Around October, about three months after he and his pregnant wife arrived in Los Angeles in a car he had stolen in Ohio, Manson was again charged with a federal crime for taking the vehicle interstate. After a psychiatric evaluation, he was given five years' <a href="probation" class="uri" title="wikilink">probation</a>. His subsequent failure to appear at a Los Angeles hearing on an identical charge filed in Florida resulted in his March 1956 arrest in <a href="Indianapolis" class="uri" title="wikilink">Indianapolis</a>. His probation was revoked; he was sentenced to three years' imprisonment at <a href="Federal_Correctional_Institution,_Terminal_Island" title="wikilink">Terminal Island</a>, San Pedro, California.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a></p>
<p>While Manson was in prison, Rosalie gave birth to their son, Charles Manson, Jr. During his first year at Terminal Island, Manson received visits from Rosalie and his mother, who were now living together in Los Angeles. In March 1957, when the visits from his wife ceased, his mother informed him Rosalie was living with another man. Less than two weeks before a scheduled parole hearing, Manson tried to escape by stealing a car. He was subsequently given five years <a href="probation" class="uri" title="wikilink">probation</a>, and his parole was denied.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="second-imprisonment">Second imprisonment</h3>
<p>Manson received five years' parole in September 1958, the same year in which Rosalie received a decree of divorce. By November, he was <a href="pimp" title="wikilink">pimping</a> a 16-year-old girl and was receiving additional support from a girl with wealthy parents. In September 1959, he pleaded guilty to a charge of attempting to cash a forged <a href="U.S._Treasury" title="wikilink">U.S. Treasury</a> check. He received a 10-year <a href="suspended_sentence" title="wikilink">suspended sentence</a> and probation after a young woman with an arrest record for prostitution made a &quot;tearful plea&quot; before the court that she and Manson were &quot;deeply in love... and would marry if Charlie were freed.&quot;<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> Before the year's end, the woman did marry Manson, possibly so testimony against him <a href="Spousal_testimonial_privilege" title="wikilink">would not be required</a> of her.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a></p>
<p>The woman's name was Leona; as a prostitute, she had used the name Candy Stevens. After Manson took her and another woman from California to <a href="New_Mexico" title="wikilink">New Mexico</a> for purposes of prostitution, he was held and questioned for violation of the <a href="Mann_Act" title="wikilink">Mann Act</a>. Though he was released, he evidently suspected, rightly, that the investigation had not ended. When he disappeared, in violation of his probation, a <a href="bench_warrant" title="wikilink">bench warrant</a> was issued; an April 1960 indictment for violation of the Mann Act followed.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> Arrested in <a href="Laredo,_Texas" title="wikilink">Laredo, Texas</a>, in June, when one of the women was arrested for prostitution, Manson was returned to Los Angeles. For violation of his probation on the check-cashing charge, he was ordered to serve his 10-year sentence.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a></p>
<p>In July 1961, after a year spent unsuccessfully appealing the revocation of his probation, Manson was transferred from the Los Angeles County Jail to the United States Penitentiary at <a href="McNeil_Island" title="wikilink">McNeil Island</a>. Although the Mann Act charge had been dropped, the attempt to cash the Treasury check was still a federal offense. His September 1961 annual review noted he had a &quot;tremendous drive to call attention to himself,&quot; an observation echoed in September 1964.<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> In 1963, Leona was granted a divorce, in the pursuit of which she alleged that she and Manson had had a son, Charles Luther.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a></p>
<p>In June 1966, Manson was sent, for the second time in his life, to <a href="Federal_Correctional_Institution,_Terminal_Island" title="wikilink">Terminal Island</a>, in preparation for early release. By March 21, 1967, his release day, he had spent more than half of his 32 years in prisons and other institutions.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a> Telling the authorities that prison had become his home, he requested permission to stay,<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a> a fact touched on in a 1981 television interview with <a href="Tom_Snyder" title="wikilink">Tom Snyder</a>.<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="manson-family">Manson Family</h2>
<p>On his release day, Manson received permission to move to San Francisco, where, with the help of a prison acquaintance, he moved into an apartment in <a href="Berkeley,_California" title="wikilink">Berkeley</a>. In prison, bank robber <a href="Alvin_Karpis" title="wikilink">Alvin Karpis</a> had taught him to play <a href="steel_guitar" title="wikilink">steel guitar</a>.<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a><a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a><a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a> Now, living mostly by <a href="panhandling" class="uri" title="wikilink">panhandling</a>, he soon got to know <a href="Mary_Brunner" title="wikilink">Mary Brunner</a>, a 23-year-old graduate of the <a href="University_of_Wisconsin&lt;U+2013&gt;Madison" title="wikilink">University of Wisconsin&lt;U+2013&gt;Madison</a>. Brunner was working as an assistant librarian at <a href="UC_Berkeley" title="wikilink">UC Berkeley</a>, and Manson moved in with her. According to a secondhand account, he overcame her resistance to his bringing other women in to live with them. Before long, they were sharing Brunner's residence with 18 other women.<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a></p>
<p>Manson established himself as a <a href="guru" class="uri" title="wikilink">guru</a> in San Francisco's <a href="Haight-Ashbury" class="uri" title="wikilink">Haight-Ashbury</a>, which, during 1967's &quot;<a href="Summer_of_Love" title="wikilink">Summer of Love</a>,&quot; was emerging as the signature <a href="hippie" class="uri" title="wikilink">hippie</a> locale. Expounding a philosophy that included some of the <a href="Scientology" class="uri" title="wikilink">Scientology</a> he had studied in prison,<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a> he soon had his first group of young followers, most of them female.<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a> Upon a staff evaluation of Manson when he entered prison in July 1961 at the U.S. penitentiary in <a href="McNeil_Island" title="wikilink">McNeil Island</a>, <a href="Washington_(U.S._state)" title="wikilink">Washington</a>, Manson entered &quot;Scientologist&quot; as his religion.<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a></p>
<p>Before the summer ended, Manson and eight or nine of his enthusiasts piled into an old school bus they had re-wrought in hippie style, with colored rugs and pillows in place of the many seats they had removed. They roamed as far north as <a href="Washington_(U.S._state)" title="wikilink">Washington state</a>, then southward through Los Angeles, <a href="Mexico" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mexico</a>, and the southwest. Returning to the Los Angeles area, they lived in <a href="Topanga,_California" title="wikilink">Topanga Canyon</a>, <a href="Malibu,_California" title="wikilink">Malibu</a>, and <a href="Venice,_California" title="wikilink">Venice</a>&lt;U+2014&gt;western parts of the city and county.<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a></p>
<p>In an alternative account, Manson acquired Family members during some months of travels that were undertaken, in part, in a <a href="Volkswagen" class="uri" title="wikilink">Volkswagen</a> van. He was apparently accompanied by Brunner. It was November when the school bus set out from San Francisco with the enlarged group.<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="involvement-with-wilson-melcher-et-al.">Involvement with Wilson, Melcher, et al.</h3>
<p>The events that would culminate in the murders were set in motion in late spring 1968, when, by some accounts, <a href="Dennis_Wilson" title="wikilink">Dennis Wilson</a>, of <a href="The_Beach_Boys" title="wikilink">The Beach Boys</a>, picked up two hitchhiking Manson women and brought them to his <a href="Pacific_Palisades" title="wikilink">Pacific Palisades</a> house for a few hours. Returning home in the early hours of the following morning from a night recording session, Wilson was greeted in the driveway of his own residence by Manson, who emerged from the house. Uncomfortable, Wilson asked the stranger whether he intended to hurt him. Assuring him he had no such intent, Manson began kissing Wilson's feet.<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a><a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a></p>
<p>Inside the house, Wilson discovered 12 strangers, mostly women.<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a><a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a> Over the next few months, as their number doubled, the Family members who had made themselves part of Wilson's <a href="Sunset_Boulevard" title="wikilink">Sunset Boulevard</a> household cost him approximately $100,000. This included a large medical bill for treatment of their <a href="gonorrhea" class="uri" title="wikilink">gonorrhea</a> and $21,000 for the accidental destruction of his uninsured car, which they borrowed.<a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a> Wilson would sing and talk with Manson, whose women were treated as servants to them both.<a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a></p>
<p>Wilson paid for studio time to record songs written and performed by Manson, and he introduced Manson to acquaintances of his with roles in the entertainment business. These included <a href="Gregg_Jakobson" title="wikilink">Gregg Jakobson</a>, <a href="Terry_Melcher" title="wikilink">Terry Melcher</a>, and Rudi Altobelli (the last of whom owned a house he would soon rent to actress <a href="Sharon_Tate" title="wikilink">Sharon Tate</a> and her husband, director <a href="Roman_Polanski" title="wikilink">Roman Polanski</a>).<a href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a> Jakobson, who was impressed by &quot;the whole Charlie Manson package&quot; of artist/lifestylist/philosopher, also paid to record Manson material.<a href="#fn67" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a><a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a></p>
<p>In <em>Manson in His Own Words</em>, the account is that Manson first met Wilson at a friend's San Francisco house where Manson had gone to obtain <a href="cannabis_(drug)" title="wikilink">marijuana</a>. The Beach Boy supposedly gave Manson his Sunset Boulevard address and invited him to stop by when he would be in Los Angeles.<a href="#fn69" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref69"><sup>69</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="spahn-ranch">Spahn Ranch</h3>
<p>Manson established a base for the group at <a href="Spahn_Ranch" title="wikilink">Spahn's Movie Ranch</a> not far from Topanga Canyon in August 1968 after Wilson's manager told the Family to move out of Wilson's home.<a href="#fn70" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a><a href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a> The entire Family then relocated to the ranch.<a href="#fn72" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref72"><sup>72</sup></a></p>
<p>The ranch had been a television and movie set for <a href="Western_(genre)" title="wikilink">Western</a> productions. However, by the late 1960s, the buildings had deteriorated and the ranch was earning money primarily by selling horseback rides.</p>
<p>Family members did helpful work around the grounds. Also, Manson ordered the Family's women, including <a href="Lynette_Fromme" title="wikilink">Lynette &quot;Squeaky&quot; Fromme</a>, to occasionally have sex with the nearly blind, 80-year-old owner, <a href="George_Spahn" title="wikilink">George Spahn</a>. The women also acted as seeing-eye guides for Spahn. In exchange, Spahn allowed Manson and his group to live at the ranch for free.<a href="#fn73" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref73"><sup>73</sup></a><a href="#fn74" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref74"><sup>74</sup></a> Squeaky acquired her nickname because she often squeaked when Spahn pinched her thigh.<a href="#fn75" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref75"><sup>75</sup></a><a href="#fn76" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref76"><sup>76</sup></a></p>
<p><a href="Charles_&quot;Tex&quot;_Watson" title="wikilink">Charles Watson</a> soon joined the group at Spahn's ranch. Watson, a small-town <a href="Texas" title="wikilink">Texan</a> who had quit college and moved to California,<a href="#fn77" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref77"><sup>77</sup></a> met Manson at Dennis Wilson's house.

<p>In the first days of November 1968, Manson established the Family at alternative headquarters in <a href="Death_Valley" title="wikilink">Death Valley</a>'s environs, where they occupied two unused or little-used ranches, Myers and Barker.<a href="#fn80" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref80"><sup>80</sup></a><a href="#fn81" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref81"><sup>81</sup></a> The former, to which the group had initially headed, was owned by the grandmother of a new woman in the Family. The latter was owned by an elderly, local woman to whom Manson presented himself and a male Family member as musicians in need of a place congenial to their work. When the woman agreed to let them stay there if they'd fix up things, Manson honored her with one of the <a href="Beach_Boys" title="wikilink">Beach Boys</a>' <a href="gold_record" title="wikilink">gold records</a>,<a href="#fn82" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref82"><sup>82</sup></a> several of which he had been given by <a href="Dennis_Wilson" title="wikilink">Dennis Wilson</a>.<a href="#fn83" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref83"><sup>83</sup></a></p>
<p>While back at Spahn Ranch, no later than December, Manson and Watson visited a Topanga Canyon acquaintance who played them the <a href="The_Beatles" title="wikilink">Beatles'</a> <a href="The_Beatles_(album)" title="wikilink"><em>White Album</em></a>, then recently released.<a href="#fn84" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref84"><sup>84</sup></a><a href="#fn85" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref85"><sup>85</sup></a><a href="#fn86" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref86"><sup>86</sup></a> Despite having been 29 years old and imprisoned when the Beatles first came to America in 1964, Manson was obsessed with the group.<ref></p>

<p>For some time, Manson had been saying that racial tension between blacks and whites was growing and that blacks would soon rise up in rebellion in America's cities.<a href="#fn90" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref90"><sup>90</sup></a><a href="#fn91" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref91"><sup>91</sup></a> He had emphasized <a href="Martin_Luther_King,_Jr." title="wikilink">Martin Luther King, Jr.</a>'s assassination, which had taken place on April 4, 1968.<a href="#fn92" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref92"><sup>92</sup></a> On a bitterly cold New Year's Eve at Myers Ranch, the Family members, gathered outside around a large fire, listened as Manson explained that the social turmoil he had been predicting had also been predicted by the Beatles.<a href="#fn93" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref93"><sup>93</sup></a> The <em>White Album</em> songs, he declared, told it all, although in code. In fact, he maintained (or would soon maintain), the album was directed at the Family itself, an elect group that was being instructed to preserve the worthy from the impending disaster.<a href="#fn94" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref94"><sup>94</sup></a><a href="#fn95" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref95"><sup>95</sup></a></p>
<p>In early January 1969, the Family escaped the desert's cold and positioned itself to monitor L.A.'s supposed tension by moving to a canary-yellow home in <a href="Canoga_Park" title="wikilink">Canoga Park</a>, not far from the Spahn Ranch.<a href="#fn96" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref96"><sup>96</sup></a><a href="#fn97" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref97"><sup>97</sup></a><a href="#fn98" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref98"><sup>98</sup></a> Because this locale would allow the group to remain &quot;submerged beneath the awareness of the outside world,&quot;<a href="#fn99" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref99"><sup>99</sup></a><a href="#fn100" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref100"><sup>100</sup></a> Manson called it the <a href="Yellow_Submarine_(song)" title="wikilink">Yellow Submarine</a>, another Beatles reference. There, Family members prepared for the impending apocalypse,<a href="#fn101" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref101"><sup>101</sup></a><a href="#fn102" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref102"><sup>102</sup></a> which, around the campfire, Manson had termed &quot;Helter Skelter,&quot; after the <a href="Helter_Skelter_(song)" title="wikilink">song</a> of that name.</p>
<p>By February, Manson's vision was complete. The Family would create an album whose songs, as subtle as those of the Beatles, would trigger the predicted chaos. Ghastly murders of whites by blacks would be met with retaliation, and a split between racist and non-racist whites would yield whites' self-annihilation. Blacks' triumph, as it were, would merely precede their being ruled by the Family, which would ride out the conflict in &quot;the bottomless pit&quot;&lt;U+2014&gt;a secret city beneath Death Valley.<a href="#fn103" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref103"><sup>103</sup></a> At the Canoga Park house, while Family members worked on vehicles and pored over maps to prepare for their desert escape, they also worked on songs for their world-changing album. When they were told <a href="Terry_Melcher" title="wikilink">Terry Melcher</a> was to come to the house to hear the material, the women prepared a meal and cleaned the place; but Melcher never arrived.<a href="#fn104" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref104"><sup>104</sup></a><a href="#fn105" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref105"><sup>105</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="encounter-with-tate">Encounter with Tate</h3>
<p>On March 23, 1969,<a href="#fn106" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref106"><sup>106</sup></a> Manson entered, uninvited, upon <a href="10050_Cielo_Drive" title="wikilink">10050 Cielo Drive</a>, which he had known as Melcher's residence.<a href="#fn107" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref107"><sup>107</sup></a> This was Rudi Altobelli's property, where Melcher was no longer the tenant. As of that February,<a href="#fn108" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref108"><sup>108</sup></a> the tenants were <a href="Sharon_Tate" title="wikilink">Sharon Tate</a> and <a href="Roman_Polanski" title="wikilink">Roman Polanski</a>.</p>
<p>Manson was met by Shahrokh Hatami, a photographer and Tate's friend. Hatami was there to photograph Tate in advance of her departure for Rome the next day. Having seen Manson through a window as Manson approached the main house, Hatami had gone onto the front porch to ask him what he wanted.<a href="#fn109" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref109"><sup>109</sup></a></p>
<p>When Manson told Hatami he was looking for someone whose name Hatami did not recognize, Hatami informed him the place was the Polanski residence. Hatami advised him to try &quot;the back alley,&quot; by which he meant the path to the guest house, beyond the main house.<a href="#fn110" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref110"><sup>110</sup></a> Concerned over the stranger on the property, Hatami was now down on the front walk, to confront Manson. Appearing behind Hatami, in the house's front door, Tate asked him who was calling. Hatami said a man was looking for someone. Hatami and Tate maintained their positions while Manson, without a word, went back to the guest house, returned a minute or two later, and left.<a href="#fn111" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref111"><sup>111</sup></a></p>
<p>That evening, Manson returned to the property and again went back to the guest house. Presuming to enter the enclosed porch, he spoke with Rudi Altobelli, who was just coming out of the shower. Although Manson asked for Melcher, Altobelli felt Manson had come looking for him.<a href="#fn112" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref112"><sup>112</sup></a> This is consistent with prosecutor <a href="Vincent_Bugliosi" title="wikilink">Vincent Bugliosi</a>'s later discovery that Manson had apparently been to the place on earlier occasions after Melcher's departure from it.<a href="#fn113" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref113"><sup>113</sup></a></p>
<p>Speaking through the inner screen door, Altobelli told Manson that Melcher had moved to <a href="Malibu,_California" title="wikilink">Malibu</a>. He lied that he did not know Melcher's new address. In response to a question from Manson, Altobelli said he himself was in the entertainment business, although, having met Manson the previous year, at Dennis Wilson's home, he was sure Manson already knew that. At Wilson's, Altobelli had complimented Manson lukewarmly on some of his musical recordings that Wilson had been playing.<a href="#fn114" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref114"><sup>114</sup></a></p>
<p>When Altobelli informed Manson he was going out of the country the next day, Manson said he'd like to speak with him upon his return; Altobelli lied that he would be gone for more than a year. In response to a direct question from Altobelli, Manson explained that he had been directed to the guest house by the persons in the main house; Altobelli expressed the wish that Manson not disturb his tenants.<a href="#fn115" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref115"><sup>115</sup></a></p>
<p>Manson left. As Altobelli flew with Tate to Rome the next day, Tate asked him whether &quot;that creepy-looking guy&quot; had gone back to the guest house the day before.<a href="#fn116" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref116"><sup>116</sup></a></p>

<h3 id="crowe-shooting">Crowe shooting</h3>
<p>On May 18, 1969, Terry Melcher visited Spahn Ranch to hear Manson and the women sing. Melcher arranged a subsequent visit, not long thereafter, on which he brought a friend who possessed a mobile recording unit; but he himself did not record the group.<a href="#fn117" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref117"><sup>117</sup></a><a href="#fn118" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref118"><sup>118</sup></a></p>
<p>By June, Manson was telling the Family they might have to show blacks how to start &quot;Helter Skelter&quot;.<a href="#fn119" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref119"><sup>119</sup></a><a href="#fn120" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref120"><sup>120</sup></a><a href="#fn121" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref121"><sup>121</sup></a> When Manson tasked Watson with obtaining money supposedly intended to help the Family prepare for the conflict, Watson defrauded a black <a href="drug_dealer" title="wikilink">drug dealer</a> named Bernard &quot;Lotsapoppa&quot; Crowe. Crowe responded with a threat to wipe out everyone at Spahn Ranch. Manson countered on July 1, 1969, by shooting Crowe at his <a href="Hollywood,_Los_Angeles,_California" title="wikilink">Hollywood</a> apartment.<a href="#fn122" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref122"><sup>122</sup></a><a href="#fn123" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref123"><sup>123</sup></a><a href="#fn124" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref124"><sup>124</sup></a><a href="#fn125" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref125"><sup>125</sup></a></p>
<p>Manson's mistaken belief that he had killed Crowe was seemingly confirmed by a news report of the discovery of the dumped body of a <a href="Black_Panther_Party" title="wikilink">Black Panther</a> in Los Angeles. Although Crowe was not a member of the Black Panthers, Manson, concluding he had been, expected retaliation from the group. He turned Spahn Ranch into a defensive camp, with night patrols of armed guards.<a href="#fn126" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref126"><sup>126</sup></a><a href="#fn127" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref127"><sup>127</sup></a> &quot;If we'd needed any more proof that Helter Skelter was coming down very soon, this was it,&quot; Tex Watson would later write, &quot;[B]lackie was trying to get at the chosen ones.&quot;<a href="#fn128" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref128"><sup>128</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="hinman-murder">Hinman murder</h3>
<p>On July 25, 1969, Manson sent sometime Family member <a href="Bobby_Beausoleil" title="wikilink">Bobby Beausoleil</a> along with <a href="Mary_Brunner" title="wikilink">Mary Brunner</a> and <a href="Susan_Atkins" title="wikilink">Susan Atkins</a> to the house of acquaintance Gary Hinman, to persuade him to turn over money Manson thought Hinman had inherited.<a href="#fn129" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref129"><sup>129</sup></a><a href="#fn130" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref130"><sup>130</sup></a><a href="#fn131" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref131"><sup>131</sup></a> The three held the uncooperative Hinman hostage for two days, during which Manson showed up with a sword to slash his ear. After that, Beausoleil stabbed Hinman to death, ostensibly on Manson&lt;U+2019&gt;s instruction. Before leaving the Topanga Canyon residence, Beausoleil, or one of the women, used Hinman&lt;U+2019&gt;s blood to write &quot;Political piggy&quot; on the wall and to draw a panther paw, a Black Panther symbol.<a href="#fn132" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref132"><sup>132</sup></a><a href="#fn133" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref133"><sup>133</sup></a></p>
<p>In magazine interviews of 1981 and 1998&lt;U+2013&gt;99,<a href="#fn134" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref134"><sup>134</sup></a><a href="#fn135" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref135"><sup>135</sup></a> Beausoleil would say he went to Hinman&lt;U+2019&gt;s to recover money paid to Hinman for drugs that had supposedly been bad; he added that Brunner and Atkins, unaware of his intent, went along idly, merely to visit Hinman. On the other hand, Atkins, in her 1977 autobiography, wrote that Manson directly told Beausoleil, Brunner, and her to go to Hinman&lt;U+2019&gt;s and get the supposed inheritance&lt;U+2014&gt;$21,000. She said Manson had told her privately, two days earlier, that, if she wanted to &quot;do something important,&quot; she could kill Hinman and get his money.<a href="#fn136" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref136"><sup>136</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="tate-murders">Tate murders</h3>
<p>Beausoleil was arrested on August 6, 1969, after he had been caught driving Hinman's car. Police found the murder weapon in the tire well.<a href="#fn137" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref137"><sup>137</sup></a> Two days later, Manson told Family members at Spahn Ranch, &quot;Now is the time for Helter Skelter.&quot;<a href="#fn138" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref138"><sup>138</sup></a><a href="#fn139" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref139"><sup>139</sup></a><a href="#fn140" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref140"><sup>140</sup></a></p>
<p>On the night of August 8, Manson directed Watson to take Atkins, <a href="Linda_Kasabian" title="wikilink">Linda Kasabian</a>, and <a href="Patricia_Krenwinkel" title="wikilink">Patricia Krenwinkel</a> to &quot;that house where Melcher used to live&quot; and &quot;totally destroy everyone in [it], as gruesome as you can.&quot;<a href="#fn141" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref141"><sup>141</sup></a><a href="#fn142" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref142"><sup>142</sup></a> He told the women to do as Watson would instruct them.<a href="#fn143" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref143"><sup>143</sup></a> Krenwinkel was one of the early Family members, one of the hitchhikers who had allegedly been picked up by Dennis Wilson.<a href="#fn144" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref144"><sup>144</sup></a> The current occupants of the house, all of whom were strangers to the Manson followers, were movie actress <a href="Sharon_Tate" title="wikilink">Sharon Tate</a>, wife of famed director <a href="Roman_Polanski" title="wikilink">Roman Polanski</a> and eight and a half months <a href="pregnant" class="uri" title="wikilink">pregnant</a>; her friend and former lover <a href="Jay_Sebring" title="wikilink">Jay Sebring</a>, a noted hairstylist; Polanski's friend and aspiring screenwriter <a href="Wojciech_Frykowski" title="wikilink">Wojciech Frykowski</a>, and Frykowski&lt;U+2019&gt;s lover <a href="Abigail_Folger" title="wikilink">Abigail Folger</a>, heiress to the <a href="Folgers_Coffee" title="wikilink">Folger coffee fortune</a>.<a href="#fn145" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref145"><sup>145</sup></a> Tate's husband, Polanski, was in London working on a film project; Tate had been visiting with him and had returned to the United States only three weeks earlier. </p>
<p>When the murder team arrived at the entrance to the <a href="10050_Cielo_Drive" title="wikilink">Cielo Drive</a> property, Watson, who had been to the house on at least one other occasion, climbed a telephone pole near the gate and cut the phone line.<a href="#fn146" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref146"><sup>146</sup></a> It was now around midnight and into August 9, 1969. Backing their car down to the bottom of the hill that led up to the place, the group parked there and walked back up to the house. Thinking the gate might be electrified or rigged with an alarm,<a href="#fn147" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref147"><sup>147</sup></a> they climbed a brushy embankment at its right and dropped onto the grounds. Just then, headlights came their way from farther within the angled property. Watson ordered the women to lie in the bushes. He then stepped out and ordered the approaching driver, 18-year-old student and hi-fi enthusiast <a href="Steven_Parent" title="wikilink">Steven Parent</a>, to halt. As Watson leveled a 22-caliber revolver at Parent, the frightened youth begged Watson not to hurt him, claiming that he wouldn't say anything. Watson first slashed at Parent with a knife, giving him a defensive slash wound on the palm of his hand (severing tendons and tearing the boy's watch off his wrist), then shot him four times in the chest and abdomen. Watson then ordered the women to help push the car further up the driveway<a href="#fn148" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref148"><sup>148</sup></a><a href="#fn149" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref149"><sup>149</sup></a> After traversing the front lawn and having Kasabian search for an open window of the main house, Watson cut the screen of a window. Watson told Kasabian to keep watch down by the gate; she walked over to Steven Parent's Rambler and waited.<a href="#fn150" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref150"><sup>150</sup></a><a href="#fn151" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref151"><sup>151</sup></a><a href="#fn152" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref152"><sup>152</sup></a> He then removed the screen, entered through the window, and let Atkins and Krenwinkel in through the front door.<a href="#fn153" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref153"><sup>153</sup></a></p>
<p>As Watson whispered to Atkins, Frykowski awoke on the living-room couch; Watson kicked him in the head.<a href="#fn154" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref154"><sup>154</sup></a> When Frykowski asked him who he was and what he was doing there, Watson replied, &quot;I&lt;U+2019&gt;m <a href="the_devil" title="wikilink">the devil</a>, and I&lt;U+2019&gt;m here to do the devil&lt;U+2019&gt;s business.&quot;<a href="#fn155" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref155"><sup>155</sup></a><a href="#fn156" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref156"><sup>156</sup></a></p>
<p>On Watson&lt;U+2019&gt;s direction, Atkins found the house's three other occupants and, with Krenwinkel's help,<a href="#fn157" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref157"><sup>157</sup></a> brought them to the living room. Watson began to tie Tate and Sebring together by their necks with rope he'd brought and slung up over a beam. Sebring's protest &lt;U+2014&gt; his second &lt;U+2014&gt; of rough treatment of the pregnant Tate prompted Watson to shoot him. Folger was taken momentarily back to her bedroom for her purse, out of which she gave the intruders $70. After that, Watson stabbed the groaning Sebring seven times.<a href="#fn158" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref158"><sup>158</sup></a><a href="#fn159" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref159"><sup>159</sup></a></p>
<p>Frykowski's hands had been bound with a towel. Freeing himself, Frykowski began struggling with Atkins, who stabbed at his legs with the knife with which she had been guarding him.<a href="#fn160" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref160"><sup>160</sup></a> As he fought his way toward and out the front door, onto the porch, Watson joined in against him. Watson struck him over the head with the gun multiple times, stabbed him repeatedly, and shot him twice.<a href="#fn161" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref161"><sup>161</sup></a> Watson broke the gun's right grip in the process.</p>
<p>Around this time, Kasabian was drawn up from the driveway by &quot;horrifying sounds.&quot; She arrived outside the door. In a vain effort to halt the massacre, she told Atkins falsely that someone was coming.<a href="#fn162" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref162"><sup>162</sup></a><a href="#fn163" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref163"><sup>163</sup></a></p>
<p>Inside the house, Folger had escaped from Krenwinkel and fled out a bedroom door to the pool area.<a href="#fn164" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref164"><sup>164</sup></a> Folger was pursued to the front lawn by Krenwinkel, who stabbedand finally, tackledher. She was dispatched by Watson; her two assailants had stabbed her 28 times.<a href="#fn165" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref165"><sup>165</sup></a><a href="#fn166" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref166"><sup>166</sup></a> As Frykowski struggled across the lawn, Watson murdered him with a final flurry of stabbing. Frykowski was stabbed a total of 51 times.<a href="#fn167" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref167"><sup>167</sup></a><a href="#fn168" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref168"><sup>168</sup></a></p>
<p>Back in the house, Tate pleaded to be allowed to live long enough to have her baby, and even offered herself as a hostage in an attempt to save the life of her unborn child; her killers would have none of it, as either Atkins, Watson, or both killed Tate, who was stabbed 16 times.<a href="#fn169" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref169"><sup>169</sup></a> Watson later wrote that Tate cried, &quot;Mother... mother...&quot; as she was being killed.<a href="#fn170" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref170"><sup>170</sup></a></p>
<p>Earlier, as the four Family members had headed out from Spahn Ranch, Manson had told the women to &quot;leave a sign... something witchy&quot;.<a href="#fn171" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref171"><sup>171</sup></a> Using the towel that had bound Frykowski&lt;U+2019&gt;s hands, Atkins wrote &quot;pig&quot; on the house&lt;U+2019&gt;s front door, in Tate's blood. En route home, the killers changed out of bloody clothes, which were ditched in the hills, along with their weapons.<a href="#fn172" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref172"><sup>172</sup></a><a href="#fn173" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref173"><sup>173</sup></a></p>
<p>In initial confessions to cellmates of hers at <a href="Sybil_Brand_Institute" title="wikilink">Sybil Brand Institute</a>, Atkins would say she killed Tate.<a href="#fn174" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref174"><sup>174</sup></a> In later statements to her attorney, to prosecutor <a href="Vincent_Bugliosi" title="wikilink">Vincent Bugliosi</a>, and before a <a href="grand_jury" title="wikilink">grand jury</a>, Atkins indicated Tate had been stabbed by Tex Watson.<a href="#fn175" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref175"><sup>175</sup></a> In his 1978 autobiography, Watson said that he stabbed Tate and that Atkins never touched her.<a href="#fn176" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref176"><sup>176</sup></a> Since he was aware that the prosecutor, Bugliosi, and the jury that had tried the other Tate-LaBianca defendants were convinced Atkins had stabbed Tate, he falsely testified that he did not stab her.<a href="#fn177" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref177"><sup>177</sup></a></p>

This was the home of supermarket executive <a href="Leno_LaBianca" title="wikilink">Leno LaBianca</a> and his wife, <a href="Rosemary_LaBianca" title="wikilink">Rosemary</a>, a dress shop co-owner.<a href="#fn182" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref182"><sup>182</sup></a> Located in the <a href="Los_Feliz" title="wikilink">Los Feliz</a> section of Los Angeles, it was next door to a house at which Manson and Family members had attended a party the previous year.<a href="#fn183" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref183"><sup>183</sup></a></p>
<p>According to Atkins and Kasabian, Manson disappeared up the driveway and returned to say he had tied up the house's occupants; then he sent Watson up with Krenwinkel and Van Houten.<a href="#fn184" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref184"><sup>184</sup></a> In his autobiography, on the other hand, Watson stated that, having gone up alone, Manson returned to take him up to the house with him. After Manson pointed out a sleeping man through a window, the two of them entered through the unlocked back door.<a href="#fn185" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref185"><sup>185</sup></a> Watson added that, at trial, he &quot;went along with&quot; the women's account, which he figured made him &quot;look that much less responsible.&quot;<a href="#fn186" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref186"><sup>186</sup></a></p>
<p>As Watson tells it, Manson roused the sleeping <a href="Leno_LaBianca" title="wikilink">Leno LaBianca</a> from the couch at gunpoint and had Watson bind his hands with a leather thong. After <a href="Rosemary_LaBianca" title="wikilink">Rosemary LaBianca</a> was brought briefly into the living room from the bedroom, Watson followed Manson&lt;U+2019&gt;s instructions to cover the couple&lt;U+2019&gt;s heads with pillowcases. He bound these in place with lamp cords. Manson left, sending Krenwinkel and <a href="Leslie_Van_Houten" title="wikilink">Leslie Van Houten</a> into the house with instructions that the couple be killed.<a href="#fn187" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref187"><sup>187</sup></a><a href="#fn188" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref188"><sup>188</sup></a></p>
<p>Before leaving Spahn Ranch, Watson had complained to Manson of the inadequacy of the previous night's weapons.<a href="#fn189" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref189"><sup>189</sup></a> Now, sending the women from the kitchen to the bedroom, to which Rosemary LaBianca had been returned, he went to the living room and began stabbing Leno LaBianca with a chrome-plated <a href="bayonet" class="uri" title="wikilink">bayonet</a>. The first thrust went into the man's throat.<a href="#fn190" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref190"><sup>190</sup></a></p>
<p>Sounds of a scuffle in the bedroom drew Watson there to discover Mrs. LaBianca keeping the women at bay by swinging the lamp tied to her neck. After subduing her with several stabs of the bayonet, he returned to the living room and resumed attacking Leno, whom he stabbed a total of 12 times with the bayonet. When he had finished, Watson carved &quot;WAR&quot; on the man's exposed abdomen. He stated this in his autobiography.<a href="#fn191" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref191"><sup>191</sup></a> In an unclear portion of her eventual <a href="grand_jury" title="wikilink">grand jury</a> testimony, Atkins, who did not enter the LaBianca house, possibly said she believed Krenwinkel had carved the word.<a href="#fn192" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref192"><sup>192</sup></a><a href="#fn193" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref193"><sup>193</sup></a> In a <a href="ghostwriter" title="wikilink">ghost-written</a> newspaper account based on a statement she had made earlier to her attorney,<a href="#fn194" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref194"><sup>194</sup></a> she said Watson carved it.<a href="#fn195" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref195"><sup>195</sup></a></p>
<p>Returning to the bedroom, Watson found Krenwinkel stabbing Rosemary LaBianca with a knife from the LaBianca kitchen. Heeding Manson&lt;U+2019&gt;s instruction to make sure each of the women played a part, Watson told Van Houten to stab Mrs. LaBianca too.<a href="#fn196" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref196"><sup>196</sup></a> She did, stabbing her approximately 16 times in the back and the exposed buttocks.<a href="#fn197" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref197"><sup>197</sup></a> At trial, Van Houten would claim, uncertainly,<a href="#fn198" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref198"><sup>198</sup></a> that Rosemary LaBianca was dead when she stabbed her. Evidence showed that many of Mrs. LaBianca's 41 stab wounds had, in fact, been inflicted post-mortem.<a href="#fn199" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref199"><sup>199</sup></a></p>
<p>While Watson cleaned off the bayonet and showered, Krenwinkel wrote &quot;Rise&quot; and &quot;Death to pigs&quot; on the walls and &quot;Healter [sic] Skelter&quot; on the refrigerator door, all in LaBianca blood. She gave Leno LaBianca 14 puncture wounds with an ivory-handled, two-tined carving fork, which she left jutting out of his stomach. She also planted a steak knife in his throat.<a href="#fn200" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref200"><sup>200</sup></a><a href="#fn201" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref201"><sup>201</sup></a></p>
<p>Hoping for a double crime, Manson had gone on to direct Kasabian to drive to the <a href="Venice,_Los_Angeles,_California" title="wikilink">Venice</a> home of an actor acquaintance of hers, another &quot;piggy.&quot; Depositing the second trio of Family members at the man's apartment building, he drove back to Spahn Ranch, leaving them and the LaBianca killers to hitchhike home.<a href="#fn202" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref202"><sup>202</sup></a> Kasabian thwarted this murder by deliberately knocking on the wrong apartment door and waking a stranger. As the group abandoned the murder plan and left, <a href="Susan_Atkins" title="wikilink">Susan Atkins</a> defecated in the stairwell.<a href="#fn203" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref203"><sup>203</sup></a></p>

<p>The Tate murders had become news on August 9, 1969. The Polanskis&lt;U+2019&gt; housekeeper, Winifred Chapman, had arrived for work that morning and discovered the murder scene.<a href="#fn204" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref204"><sup>204</sup></a> On August 10, detectives of the <a href="Los_Angeles_County_Sheriff&#39;s_Department" title="wikilink">Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department</a>, which had jurisdiction in the Hinman case, informed <a href="Los_Angeles_Police_Department" title="wikilink">Los Angeles Police Department</a> (LAPD) detectives assigned to the Tate case of the bloody writing at the Hinman house. Thinking the Tate murders a consequence of a drug transaction, the Tate team ignored this and the crimes' other similarities.<a href="#fn205" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref205"><sup>205</sup></a><a href="#fn206" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref206"><sup>206</sup></a> The Tate <a href="autopsy" title="wikilink">autopsies</a> were under way and the LaBianca bodies were yet to be discovered.</p>
<p>Steven Parent, the shooting victim in the Tate driveway, was determined to have been an acquaintance of William Garretson, who lived in the guest house. Garretson was a young man hired by Rudi Altobelli to take care of the property while Altobelli himself was away.<a href="#fn207" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref207"><sup>207</sup></a> As the killers arrived, Parent had been leaving Cielo Drive, after a visit to Garretson.<a href="#fn208" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref208"><sup>208</sup></a></p>
<p>Held briefly as a Tate <a href="suspect" class="uri" title="wikilink">suspect</a>, Garretson told police he had neither seen nor heard anything on the murder night. He was released on August 11, 1969, after undergoing a <a href="polygraph" class="uri" title="wikilink">polygraph</a> examination that indicated he had not been involved in the crimes.<a href="#fn209" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref209"><sup>209</sup></a> Interviewed decades later, he stated he had, in fact, witnessed a portion of the murders, as the examination suggested. (See &quot;<a href="Charles_Manson#Later_events" title="wikilink">Later events</a>&quot;, below.)<a href="#fn210" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref210"><sup>210</sup></a></p>
<p>The LaBianca crime scene was discovered at about 10:30 p.m. on August 10, approximately 19 hours after the murders were committed. Fifteen-year-old Frank Struthers&lt;U+2014&gt;Rosemary's son from a prior marriage and Leno's stepson&lt;U+2014&gt;returned from a camping trip and was disturbed by the exterior condition of the home. He called his older sister and her boyfriend. The boyfriend, Joe Dorgan, accompanied the younger Struthers into the home and discovered Leno's body. Rosemary's body was found by investigating police officers.<a href="#fn211" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref211"><sup>211</sup></a></p>
<p>On August 12, 1969, the LAPD told the press it had ruled out any connection between the Tate and LaBianca homicides.<a href="#fn212" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref212"><sup>212</sup></a> On August 16, the sheriff&lt;U+2019&gt;s office raided Spahn Ranch and arrested Manson and 25 others, as &quot;suspects in a major auto theft ring&quot; that had been stealing <a href="Volkswagen_Beetle" title="wikilink">Volkswagens</a> and converting them into <a href="Dune_buggy" title="wikilink">dune buggies</a>. Weapons were seized, but because the warrant had been misdated the group was released a few days later.<a href="#fn213" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref213"><sup>213</sup></a></p>
<p>The LaBianca detectives were generally younger than the Tate team. In a report at the end of August, when virtually all leads had gone nowhere, they noted a possible connection between the bloody writings at the LaBianca house and &quot;the singing group the Beatles&lt;U+2019&gt; most recent album.&quot;<a href="#fn214" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref214"><sup>214</sup></a></p>
<h4 id="breakthrough">Breakthrough</h4>
<p>Still working separately from the Tate team, the LaBianca team checked with the sheriff&lt;U+2019&gt;s office in mid-October, about possible similar crimes. They learned of the Hinman case. They also learned that the Hinman detectives had spoken with Beausoleil&lt;U+2019&gt;s girlfriend, Kitty Lutesinger. She had been arrested a few days earlier with members of &quot;the Manson Family.&quot;<a href="#fn215" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref215"><sup>215</sup></a></p>
<p>The arrests had taken place at the desert ranches, to which the Family had moved and whence, unknown to authorities, its members had been searching Death Valley for a hole in the ground&lt;U+2014&gt;access to the Bottomless Pit.<a href="#fn216" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref216"><sup>216</sup></a><a href="#fn217" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref217"><sup>217</sup></a><a href="#fn218" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref218"><sup>218</sup></a> A joint force of <a href="US_National_Park_Rangers" title="wikilink">National Park rangers</a> and officers from the <a href="California_Highway_Patrol" title="wikilink">California Highway Patrol</a> and the <a href="Inyo_County,_California" title="wikilink">Inyo County</a> Sheriff&lt;U+2019&gt;s Office&lt;U+2014&gt;federal, state, and county personnel&lt;U+2014&gt;had raided both the Myers and Barker ranches after following clues unwittingly left when Family members burned an <a href="engineering_vehicle" title="wikilink">earthmover</a> owned by <a href="Death_Valley_National_Park" title="wikilink">Death Valley National Monument</a>.<a href="#fn219" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref219"><sup>219</sup></a><a href="#fn220" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref220"><sup>220</sup></a><a href="#fn221" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref221"><sup>221</sup></a> The raiders had found stolen dune buggies and other vehicles and had arrested two dozen people, including Manson. A Highway Patrol officer found Manson hiding in a cabinet beneath Barker's bathroom sink.<a href="#fn222" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref222"><sup>222</sup></a></p>
<p>A month after they too, had spoken with Lutesinger, the LaBianca detectives made contact with members of a motorcycle gang she'd told them Manson had tried to enlist as his bodyguards while the Family was at Spahn Ranch.<a href="#fn223" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref223"><sup>223</sup></a> While the gang members were providing information that suggested a link between Manson and the murders,<a href="#fn224" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref224"><sup>224</sup></a> a dormitory mate of <a href="Susan_Atkins" title="wikilink">Susan Atkins</a> succeeded in informing LAPD of the Family&lt;U+2019&gt;s involvement in the crimes.<a href="#fn225" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref225"><sup>225</sup></a> One of those arrested at Barker, Atkins had been booked for the Hinman murder after she&lt;U+2019&gt;d confirmed to the sheriff&lt;U+2019&gt;s detectives that she&lt;U+2019&gt;d been involved in it, as Lutesinger had said.<a href="#fn226" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref226"><sup>226</sup></a><a href="#fn227" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref227"><sup>227</sup></a> Transferred to <a href="Sybil_Brand_Institute" title="wikilink">Sybil Brand Institute</a>, a detention center in Los Angeles, she had begun talking to bunkmates Ronnie Howard and Virginia Graham, to whom she gave accounts of the events in which she had been involved.<a href="#fn228" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref228"><sup>228</sup></a></p>
<h4 id="apprehension">Apprehension</h4>
<p>On December 1, 1969, acting on the information from these sources, LAPD announced warrants for the arrest of Watson, Krenwinkel, and Kasabian in the Tate case; the suspects' involvement in the LaBianca murders was noted. Manson and Atkins, already in custody, were not mentioned; the connection between the LaBianca case and Van Houten, who was also among those arrested near Death Valley, had not yet been recognized.<a href="#fn229" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref229"><sup>229</sup></a></p>
<p>Watson and Krenwinkel, too, were already under arrest, authorities in <a href="McKinney,_Texas" title="wikilink">McKinney</a>, Texas, and <a href="Mobile,_Alabama" title="wikilink">Mobile</a>, Alabama, having picked them up on notice from LAPD.<a href="#fn230" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref230"><sup>230</sup></a> Informed that there was a warrant out for her arrest, Kasabian voluntarily surrendered to authorities in <a href="Concord,_New_Hampshire" title="wikilink">Concord, New Hampshire</a>, on December 2.<a href="#fn231" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref231"><sup>231</sup></a></p>
<p>Before long, physical evidence such as Krenwinkel's and Watson's <a href="fingerprint" title="wikilink">fingerprints</a>, which had been collected by LAPD at Cielo Drive,<a href="#fn232" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref232"><sup>232</sup></a> was augmented by evidence recovered by the public. On September 1, 1969, the distinctive .22-caliber Hi Standard &quot;Buntline Special&quot; revolver Watson used on <a href="Steven_Parent" title="wikilink">Parent</a>, <a href="Jay_Sebring" title="wikilink">Sebring</a>, and <a href="Wojciech_Frykowski" title="wikilink">Frykowski</a> had been found and given to the police by Steven Weiss, a 10-year-old who lived near the Tate residence.<a href="#fn233" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref233"><sup>233</sup></a> In mid-December, when the <em><a href="Los_Angeles_Times" title="wikilink">Los Angeles Times</a></em> published a crime account based on information Susan Atkins had given her attorney,<a href="#fn234" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref234"><sup>234</sup></a> Weiss' father made several phone calls which finally prompted LAPD to locate the gun in its evidence file and connect it with the murders via ballistics tests.<a href="#fn235" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref235"><sup>235</sup></a> Acting on that same newspaper account, a local <a href="American_Broadcasting_Company" title="wikilink">ABC</a> television crew quickly located and recovered the bloody clothing discarded by the Tate killers.<a href="#fn236" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref236"><sup>236</sup></a> The knives discarded en route from the Tate residence were never recovered, despite a search by some of the same crewmen and, months later still, by LAPD.<a href="#fn237" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref237"><sup>237</sup></a> A knife found behind the cushion of a chair in the Tate living room was apparently that of Susan Atkins, who lost her knife in the course of the attack.<a href="#fn238" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref238"><sup>238</sup></a><a href="#fn239" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref239"><sup>239</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="trial">Trial</h3>
<p>The trial began June 15, 1970.<a href="#fn240" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref240"><sup>240</sup></a> The prosecution's main witness was Kasabian, who, along with Manson, Atkins, and Krenwinkel, had been charged with seven counts of murder and one of <a href="Conspiracy_(crime)" title="wikilink">conspiracy</a>.<a href="#fn241" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref241"><sup>241</sup></a> Not having participated in the killings, she was granted <a href="prosecutorial_immunity" title="wikilink">immunity</a> in exchange for testimony that detailed the nights of the crimes.<a href="#fn242" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref242"><sup>242</sup></a> Originally, a deal had been made with Atkins in which the prosecution agreed not to seek the death penalty against her in exchange for her grand jury testimony on which the <a href="indictments" class="uri" title="wikilink">indictments</a> were secured; once Atkins repudiated that testimony, the deal was withdrawn.<a href="#fn243" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref243"><sup>243</sup></a> Because Van Houten had only participated in the LaBianca killings, she was charged with two counts of murder and one of conspiracy.</p>
<p>Originally, Judge William Keene had reluctantly granted Manson permission to <a href="pro_se" title="wikilink">act as his own attorney</a>. Because of Manson's conduct, including violations of a <a href="gag_order" title="wikilink">gag order</a> and submission of &quot;outlandish&quot; and &quot;nonsensical&quot; <a href="motion_(legal)" title="wikilink">pretrial motions</a>, the permission was withdrawn before the trial's start.<a href="#fn244" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref244"><sup>244</sup></a> Manson filed an affidavit of prejudice against Keene, who was replaced by Judge <a href="Charles_H._Older" title="wikilink">Charles H.

He issued a statement that he was &quot;considered inadequate and incompetent to speak or defend [him]self&quot; &lt;U+2014&gt; and had &quot;X'd [him]self from [the establishment's] world.&quot;<a href="#fn246" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref246"><sup>246</sup></a><a href="#fn247" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref247"><sup>247</sup></a> Over the following weekend, the female defendants duplicated the mark on their own foreheads, as did most Family members within another day or so.<a href="#fn248" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref248"><sup>248</sup></a> (Manson's X was eventually replaced by a <a href="swastika" class="uri" title="wikilink">swastika</a>.

<h4 id="ongoing-disruptions">Ongoing disruptions</h4>
<p>During the trial, Family members loitered near the entrances and corridors of the courthouse. To keep them out of the courtroom itself, the prosecution <a href="subpoena" title="wikilink">subpoenaed</a> them as prospective witnesses, who would not be able to enter while others were testifying.<a href="#fn255" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref255"><sup>255</sup></a> When the group established itself in vigil on the sidewalk, each of the &quot;hard-core&quot; members wore a sheathed hunting knife that, being in plain view, was carried legally. Each of them was also identifiable by the X on his or her forehead.<a href="#fn256" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref256"><sup>256</sup></a></p>
<p>Some Family members attempted to dissuade witnesses from testifying. Prosecution witnesses <a href="Paul_Watkins_(Manson_Family)" title="wikilink">Paul Watkins</a> and Juan Flynn were both threatened;<a href="#fn257" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref257"><sup>257</sup></a> Watkins was badly burned in a suspicious fire in his van.<a href="#fn258" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref258"><sup>258</sup></a> Former Family member Barbara Hoyt, who had overheard <a href="Susan_Atkins" title="wikilink">Susan Atkins</a> describing the Tate murders to Family member Ruth Ann Moorehouse, agreed to accompany the latter to Hawaii. There, Moorehouse allegedly gave her a hamburger spiked with several doses of <a href="LSD" class="uri" title="wikilink">LSD</a>. Found sprawled on a <a href="Honolulu,_Hawaii" title="wikilink">Honolulu</a> curb in a drugged semi-stupor, Hoyt was taken to the hospital, where she did her best to identify herself as a witness in the Tate-LaBianca murder trial. Before the incident, Hoyt had been a reluctant witness; after the attempt to silence her, her reticence disappeared.<a href="#fn259" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref259"><sup>259</sup></a></p>
<p>On August 4, despite precautions taken by the court, Manson flashed the jury a <em>Los Angeles Times</em> front page whose headline was &quot;Manson Guilty, Nixon Declares.&quot; This was a reference to a statement made the previous day when U.S. President <a href="Richard_Nixon" title="wikilink">Richard Nixon</a> had decried what he saw as the media's glamorization of Manson. <a href="Voir_dire" title="wikilink">Voir dired</a> by Judge <a href="Charles_Older" title="wikilink">Older</a>, the jurors contended that the headline had not influenced them.

<p>On October 5, Manson was denied the court's permission to question a prosecution witness whom the defense attorneys had declined to <a href="cross-examination" title="wikilink">cross-examine</a>. Leaping over the defense table, Manson attempted to attack the judge. Wrestled to the ground by bailiffs, he was removed from the courtroom with the female defendants, who had subsequently risen and begun chanting in <a href="Latin" class="uri" title="wikilink">Latin</a>.<a href="#fn261" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref261"><sup>261</sup></a> Thereafter, Older allegedly began wearing a revolver under his robes.<a href="#fn262" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref262"><sup>262</sup></a></p>

<p>On November 16, the prosecution rested its case. Three days later, after arguing standard dismissal motions, the defense stunned the court by resting as well, without calling a single witness. Shouting their disapproval, Atkins, Krenwinkel, and Van Houten demanded their right to testify.<a href="#fn263" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref263"><sup>263</sup></a></p>
<p>In chambers, the women's lawyers told the judge their clients wanted to testify that they had planned and committed the crimes and that Manson had not been involved.<a href="#fn264" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref264"><sup>264</sup></a> By resting their case, the defense lawyers had tried to stop this; Van Houten's attorney, <a href="Ronald_Hughes" title="wikilink">Ronald Hughes</a>, vehemently stated that he would not &quot;push a client out the window.&quot; In the prosecutor's view, it was Manson who was advising the women to testify in this way as a means of saving himself.<a href="#fn265" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref265"><sup>265</sup></a> Speaking about the trial in a 1987 documentary, Krenwinkel said, &quot;The entire proceedings were scripted &lt;U+2014&gt; by Charlie.&quot;<a href="#fn266" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref266"><sup>266</sup></a></p>
<p>The next day, Manson testified. Lest he violate the <a href="Supreme_Court_of_California" title="wikilink">California Supreme Court</a>'s decision in <em>People v. Aranda</em> by making statements implicating his co-defendants, the jury was removed from the courtroom.<a href="#fn267" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref267"><sup>267</sup></a> Speaking for more than an hour, Manson said, among other things, that &quot;the music is telling the youth to rise up against the establishment.&quot; He said, &quot;Why blame it on me? I didn&lt;U+2019&gt;t write the music.&quot; &quot;To be honest with you,&quot; Manson also stated, &quot;I don&lt;U+2019&gt;t recall ever saying 'Get a knife and a change of clothes and go do what Tex says.' &quot;<a href="#fn268" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref268"><sup>268</sup></a></p>
<p>As the body of the trial concluded and with the closing arguments impending, attorney Ronald Hughes disappeared during a weekend trip.<a href="#fn269" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref269"><sup>269</sup></a> When Maxwell Keith was appointed to represent Van Houten in Hughes' absence, a delay of more than two weeks was required to permit Keith to familiarize himself with the voluminous trial transcripts.<a href="#fn270" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref270"><sup>270</sup></a> No sooner had the trial resumed, just before Christmas, than disruptions of the prosecution's closing argument by the defendants led Older to ban the four defendants from the courtroom for the remainder of the <a href="bifurcation_(law)" title="wikilink">guilt phase</a>. Older said it had become obvious the defendants were acting in collusion with each other and were simply putting on a performance.<a href="#fn271" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref271"><sup>271</sup></a></p>
<h4 id="conviction-and-penalty-phase">Conviction and penalty phase</h4>
<p>On January 25, 1971, guilty verdicts were returned against the four defendants on each of the 27 separate counts against them.<a href="#fn272" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref272"><sup>272</sup></a> Not far into the trial's <a href="bifurcation_(law)" title="wikilink">penalty phase</a>, the jurors saw, at last, the defense that Manson&lt;U+2014&gt;in the prosecution's view&lt;U+2014&gt;had planned to present.<a href="#fn273" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref273"><sup>273</sup></a> Atkins, Krenwinkel, and Van Houten testified the murders had been conceived as &quot;copycat&quot; versions of the Hinman murder, for which Atkins now took credit. The killings, they said, were intended to draw suspicion away from Bobby Beausoleil, by resembling the crime for which he had been jailed. This plan had supposedly been the work of, and carried out under the guidance of, not Manson, but someone allegedly in love with Beausoleil&lt;U+2014&gt;<a href="Linda_Kasabian" title="wikilink">Linda Kasabian</a>.<a href="#fn274" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref274"><sup>274</sup></a> Among the narrative's weak points was the inability of Atkins to explain why, as she was maintaining, she had written &quot;political piggy&quot; at the Hinman house in the first place.<a href="#fn275" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref275"><sup>275</sup></a></p>
<p>Midway through the penalty phase, Manson shaved his head and trimmed his beard to a fork; he told the press, &quot;I am the Devil, and the Devil always has a bald head.&quot;<a href="#fn276" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref276"><sup>276</sup></a> In what the prosecution regarded as belated recognition on their part that imitation of Manson only proved his domination, the female defendants refrained from shaving their heads until the jurors retired to weigh the state's request for the <a href="capital_punishment" title="wikilink">death penalty</a>.<a href="#fn277" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref277"><sup>277</sup></a></p>
<p>The effort to exonerate Manson via the &quot;copycat&quot; scenario failed. On March 29, 1971, the jury returned verdicts of death against all four defendants on all counts.<a href="#fn278" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref278"><sup>278</sup></a> On April 19, 1971, Judge Older sentenced the four to death.<a href="#fn279" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref279"><sup>279</sup></a></p>

The trial commenced in August 1971; by October, he, too, had been found guilty on seven counts of murder and one of conspiracy. Unlike the others, Watson had presented a psychiatric defense; prosecutor Vincent Bugliosi made short work of Watson's insanity claims. Like his co-conspirators, Watson was sentenced to death.<a href="#fn288" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref288"><sup>288</sup></a></p>
<p>In February 1972, the death sentences of all five parties were automatically reduced to life in prison by <em><a href="California_v._Anderson" title="wikilink">California v. Anderson</a></em>, 493 P.2d 880, 6 Cal. 3d 628 (<a href="Supreme_Court_of_California" title="wikilink">Cal.</a> 1972), in which the California Supreme Court abolished the death penalty in that state.<a href="#fn289" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref289"><sup>289</sup></a> After his return to prison, Manson's rhetoric and hippie speeches were not accepted. Though he eventually found temporary acceptance from the <a href="Aryan_Brotherhood" title="wikilink">Aryan Brotherhood</a>, his role was submissive to a sexually aggressive member of the group, at <a href="San_Quentin_State_Prison" title="wikilink">San Quentin</a>.<a href="#fn290" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref290"><sup>290</sup></a></p>
<p>In a 1971 trial that took place after his Tate/LaBianca convictions, Manson was found guilty of the murders of Gary Hinman and <a href="Donald_&quot;Shorty&quot;_Shea" title="wikilink">Donald &quot;Shorty&quot; Shea</a> and was given a <a href="Life_imprisonment" title="wikilink">life sentence</a>. Shea was a Spahn Ranch stuntman and horse wrangler who had been killed approximately 10 days after the August 16, 1969, sheriff's raid on the ranch. Manson, who suspected that Shea helped set up the raid, had apparently believed Shea was trying to get Spahn to run the Family off the ranch. Manson may have considered it a &quot;sin&quot; that the white Shea had married a black woman; and there was the possibility that Shea knew about the Tate/LaBianca killings.<a href="#fn291" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref291"><sup>291</sup></a><a href="#fn292" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref292"><sup>292</sup></a> In separate trials, Family members Bruce Davis and Steve &quot;Clem&quot; Grogan were also found guilty of Shea's murder.<a href="#fn293" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref293"><sup>293</sup></a><a href="#fn294" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref294"><sup>294</sup></a></p>
<p>Before the conclusion of Manson's Tate/LaBianca trial, a reporter for the <em>Los Angeles Times</em> tracked down Manson's mother, remarried and living in the <a href="Pacific_Northwest" title="wikilink">Pacific Northwest</a>.

<p>On September 5, 1975, the Family rocketed back to national attention when <a href="Lynette_Fromme" title="wikilink">Squeaky Fromme</a> attempted to assassinate US President <a href="Gerald_Ford" title="wikilink">Gerald Ford</a>.<a href="#fn296" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref296"><sup>296</sup></a> The attempt took place in <a href="Sacramento,_California" title="wikilink">Sacramento</a>, to which she and Manson follower <a href="Sandra_Good" title="wikilink">Sandra Good</a> had moved to be near Manson while he was incarcerated at <a href="Folsom_State_Prison" title="wikilink">Folsom State Prison</a>. A subsequent search of the apartment shared by Fromme, Good, and a Family recruit turned up evidence that, coupled with later actions on the part of Good, resulted in Good's conviction for conspiring to send threatening communications through the United States mail and transmitting death threats by way of interstate commerce. (The threats that were involved were against corporate executives and US government officials and had to do with supposed environmental dereliction on their part.)<a href="#fn297" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref297"><sup>297</sup></a> Fromme was sentenced to 15 years to life, becoming the first person sentenced under <a href="United_States_Code" title="wikilink">United States Code</a> Title 18, chapter 84 (1965),<a href="#fn298" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref298"><sup>298</sup></a> which made it a Federal crime to attempt to assassinate the President of the United States.</p>
<p>In 1977, authorities learned the precise location of the remains of Shorty Shea and that, contrary to Family claims, Shea had not been dismembered and buried in several places. Contacting the prosecutor in his case, Steve Grogan told him Shea&lt;U+2019&gt;s corpse had been buried in one piece; he drew a map that pinpointed the location of the body, which was recovered. Of those convicted of Manson-ordered murders, Grogan would become, in 1985, the first&lt;U+2014&gt;and, , the only&lt;U+2014&gt;to be paroled.<a href="#fn299" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref299"><sup>299</sup></a></p>
<p>In the 1980s, Manson gave three notable interviews.

The other prisoner, Jan Holmstrom, explained that Manson had objected to his <a href="Hare_Krishna" title="wikilink">Hare Krishna</a> chants and had verbally threatened him. Despite suffering second- and third-degree burns over 20 percent of his body, Manson recovered from his injuries.<a href="#fn303" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref303"><sup>303</sup></a></p>
