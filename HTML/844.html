<p><strong>&quot;Trapped in the Closet&quot;</strong>, the twelfth episode of the <a href="List_of_South_Park_episodes#Season_9:_2005" title="wikilink">ninth season</a> of the <a href="Comedy_Central" title="wikilink">Comedy Central</a> series <em><a href="South_Park" title="wikilink">South Park</a></em>, originally aired on <a href="November_16" title="wikilink">November 16</a>, <a href="2005" class="uri" title="wikilink">2005</a>. The plot of the episode centers on the <em>South Park</em> character <a href="Stan_Marsh" title="wikilink">Stan Marsh</a>, as he joins <a href="Scientology" class="uri" title="wikilink">Scientology</a> in an attempt to find something &quot;fun and free&quot;. After the discovery of his surprisingly high &quot;<a href="thetan" class="uri" title="wikilink">thetan</a> levels&quot;, he is recognized as the reincarnation of the founder of the church, <a href="L._Ron_Hubbard" title="wikilink">L. Ron Hubbard</a>.</p>
<p>Though the episode was originally scheduled for rebroadcast in March 2006, the episode &quot;<a href="Chef&#39;s_Chocolate_Salty_Balls" title="wikilink">Chef's Chocolate Salty Balls</a>&quot; was shown instead. Comedy Central representatives stated this change was made as a tribute to Isaac Hayes, however <em>South Park</em> creators <a href="Trey_Parker" title="wikilink">Trey Parker</a> and <a href="Matt_Stone" title="wikilink">Matt Stone</a> thought otherwise. Stone and Parker issued a satirical statement saying they were &quot;servants of the dark lord <a href="Xenu" class="uri" title="wikilink">Xenu</a>&quot;. <a href="Isaac_Hayes" title="wikilink">Isaac Hayes</a>, the voice of <a href="Chef_(South_Park)" title="wikilink">Chef</a>, quit the show shortly before the start of the tenth season. The reason for his departure, as reported by <a href="Matt_Stone" title="wikilink">Matt Stone</a>, was due to his faith in Scientology and this episode, which &lt;U+2014&gt; despite initially supporting the show's satirical take on several talk shows &lt;U+2014&gt; he claimed to feel was very offensive.</p>
<p>&quot;Trapped in the Closet&quot; was nominated for an <a href="Emmy_Award" title="wikilink">Emmy Award</a> in July 2006, but the <em><a href="The_Simpsons" title="wikilink">The Simpsons</a></em> episode &quot;<a href="The_Seemingly_Never-Ending_Story" title="wikilink">The Seemingly Never-Ending Story</a>&quot; eventually received the award in the <a href="Primetime_Emmy_Award_for_Outstanding_Animated_Program_(For_Programming_less_than_One_Hour)" title="wikilink">Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Animated Program (For Programming less than One Hour)</a> category. The episode was featured among <a href="Comedy_Central" title="wikilink">Comedy Central</a>'s list of &quot;10 South Parks That Changed The World&quot;, spoofed by <a href="Conan_O&#39;Brien" title="wikilink">Conan O'Brien</a> in the opening segment of the <a href="58th_Primetime_Emmy_Awards" title="wikilink">58th Primetime Emmy Awards</a>, and mentioned in the Scientology critique film, <em><a href="The_Bridge_(Scientology_film)" title="wikilink">The Bridge</a></em>.</p>
<h2 id="plot">Plot</h2>
<p>Stan takes a &quot;<a href="Oxford_Capacity_Analysis" title="wikilink">personality test</a>&quot; that is being offered by Scientologists on the street. After answering a long <a href="questionnaire" class="uri" title="wikilink">questionnaire</a>, Stan is informed that he is a perfect candidate for Scientology — they offer to help him out for $240. Back at home, Stan asks his parents for money to help with his depression and his father suggests he use the money he had been saving for a new bike.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> After he pays, Stan is taken into an <a href="Auditing_(Scientology)" title="wikilink">auditing</a> room and an attendant reads his &quot;<a href="thetan" class="uri" title="wikilink">thetan</a> levels&quot; using an &quot;<a href="E-meter" class="uri" title="wikilink">E-meter</a>&quot;, Michelle is shocked by the high reading, and Stan's results are faxed to the Scientology headquarters in <a href="Los_Angeles,_California" title="wikilink">Los Angeles</a>. There, the president of Scientology determines that, because his reading is so high, Stan must be a reincarnation of <a href="L._Ron_Hubbard" title="wikilink">L. Ron Hubbard</a>, Scientology's founder and <a href="prophet" class="uri" title="wikilink">prophet</a>.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>Back in South Park, a large group of Scientologists, including <a href="John_Travolta" title="wikilink">John Travolta</a>, have gathered outside to celebrate Stan's &quot;second coming&quot;. The President of Scientology arrives in a helicopter and talks with Stan's parents. Stan's parents oppose his being in the group, but the president informs <a href="Randy_and_Sharon_Marsh" title="wikilink">Randy and Sharon Marsh</a> that, &quot;We're not asking him to <em>join</em> us; we're asking him to <em>lead</em> us.&quot; Randy sends his son Stan, confused and exhausted, to his room where he finds Tom Cruise waiting for him. Cruise, thinking Stan is genuinely Hubbard's reincarnation, asks him whether he enjoyed his acting. When Stan tells Cruise that his acting is not as good as others, Tom locks himself in Stan's bedroom closet, believing he is a failure in the eyes of the &quot;prophet&quot;. He refuses to come out, despite Randy, <a href="Nicole_Kidman" title="wikilink">Nicole Kidman</a>, John Travolta and <a href="R._Kelly" title="wikilink">R. Kelly</a>'s attempts to persuade him to come out of the closet, with R. Kelly's repeated narrative similar to his <a href="Rap_opera" title="wikilink">hip-hop opera</a> piece <a href="Trapped_in_the_Closet" title="wikilink">Trapped in the Closet</a>.</p>
<p>Downstairs, the Scientology president tries to convince Stan's parents to let their son join them. They want to reveal the great secret of life behind their church to Stan. Randy asks his son if he would like to know this information and Stan responds with a &quot;sure&quot;. The president tells him a condensed version of the story of <a href="Xenu" class="uri" title="wikilink">Xenu</a>, based directly on the actual Scientology <a href="Operating_Thetan" title="wikilink">OT</a> III document,<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> and accompanied by an onscreen caption reading, &quot;this is what Scientologists actually believe&quot;. After explaining these beliefs, he tells Stan to continue writing where &quot;L. Ron&quot; left off. On the official Comedy Central Web site for the <em>South Park</em> episode, it is asserted that this section of &quot;Trapped in the Closet&quot; was not exaggerated: &quot;Nothing about what you see here is exaggerated in the slightest. Seriously.&quot;<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>Stan begins writing and, when Kyle, Cartman, and Kenny come over to invite him to the movie theater, he doesn't have time for them. Kyle is concerned about the cult that Stan has joined, but Stan assures him that Scientology is based on fact. If they can't accept that he has found meaning then they are no longer friends. Stan shows his writings to the Scientology president, who approves of most of his work, but, when Stan says, &quot;to really be a church, [they] can't charge money to help,&quot; the president reveals to Stan that the church is a money-making scam.</p>
<p><img src="Sp_912.jpg" title="fig:Stan is presented to the Scientologists" alt="Stan is presented to the Scientologists" width="200" /> Outside the house, the president introduces Stan to his followers, to whom he will read his new <a href="doctrine" class="uri" title="wikilink">doctrine</a>. However, instead of presenting it to them, Stan reveals that he is actually not the reincarnation of L. Ron Hubbard, and that: &quot;Scientology is just a big fat global scam.&quot; His followers grow angry, and threaten to sue him. Tom Cruise leaves Stan's closet and appear, threatening to sue him. Stan dares them to do so, and the episode ends with the credits listing only &quot;John Smith&quot; and &quot;Jane Smith&quot;, a reference to Tom Cruise and the Church of Scientology's reputations for litigiousness.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a><a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a><a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>

<p><em>South Park</em> had previously <a href="parody" title="wikilink">parodied</a> Scientology in a spoof at the 2000 <a href="MTV_Movie_Awards" title="wikilink">MTV Movie Awards</a>.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a><a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> The MTV short was entitled: &quot;The Gauntlet,&quot; and it included &quot;John Travolta and the Church of Scientology&quot; arriving in a spaceship to defeat <a href="Russell_Crowe" title="wikilink">Russell Crowe</a> (as a <a href="Gladiator_(film)" title="wikilink">Gladiator</a>) and attempt to recruit the boys into Scientology. Travolta, along with his fellow Scientologists, was depicted as a Psychlo, as he appeared in the film <em><a href="Battlefield_Earth_(film)" title="wikilink">Battlefield Earth</a></em>.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> They had also made fun of Scientology in an earlier episode, entitled <em><a href="Super_Best_Friends" title="wikilink">Super Best Friends</a></em>, in which <a href="David_Blaine" title="wikilink">David Blaine</a> formed his own <a href="cult" class="uri" title="wikilink">cult</a>, called &quot;Blaintology&quot;.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> Parker and Stone have admitted that this is meant to be a reference to Scientology.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<p>Trey Parker asserts that Isaac Hayes' beliefs had previously kept the show's creators from writing a full-episode which parodies Scientology. However, the decision to ultimately produce a <em>South Park</em> episode satirizing Scientology was partially inspired by the friendship the show's creators have with <a href="Penn_Jillette" title="wikilink">Penn Jillette</a>. Jillette was originally planning to do an episode of <em><a href="Penn_&amp;_Teller:_Bullshit!" title="wikilink">Bullshit!</a></em> based on Scientology, but <a href="Showtime" class="uri" title="wikilink">Showtime</a> prohibited him from doing so to avoid the possibility of legal action from the Church of Scientology. Trey Parker stated: </p>

<h3 id="isaac-hayes-departure">Isaac Hayes' departure</h3>
<p>On <a href="March_13" title="wikilink">March 13</a>, <a href="2006" class="uri" title="wikilink">2006</a>, Hayes announced that he was quitting the show because of the series' treatment of religion, though he didn't specifically mention Scientology in his statement.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> In an interview on <a href="CNN" class="uri" title="wikilink">CNN</a>'s <em><a href="Showbiz_Tonight" title="wikilink">Showbiz Tonight</a></em>, he added he didn't see the episode itself, but was told about it.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> He reportedly said to Parker and Stone, &quot;Guys, you have it all wrong. We're not like that. I know that's your thing, but get your information correct, because somebody might believe that shit, you know? But I understand what they're doing. I told them to take a couple of Scientology courses, and understand what we do. [Laughs].&quot;<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
<p>Responding to Hayes' departure, Stone stated &quot;This is 100 percent having to do with his faith of Scientology... He has no problem &lt;U+2014&gt; and he's cashed plenty of checks &lt;U+2014&gt; with our show making fun of Christians  He wants a different standard for religions other than his own, and, to me, that is where intolerance and bigotry begin.&quot;<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> However, recent reports say that Hayes was in no condition to stay, because of a stroke he suffered in January.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> According to a Fox News article, Hayes' agent Christina Kimball, herself a devout Scientologist, was the source of the statements that Hayes quit South Park.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a></p>
<p>There were many conflicting stories as to the exact nature of Hayes' departure. Additional reasons given by Hayes ten months after the departure include &quot;They didn't pay me enough,&quot; and: &quot;They weren't that nice.&quot;<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> In a 2007 interview with <em>Rolling Stone</em>, Stone stated, &quot;There are reports that Isaac had a stroke and Scientology quit the show for him, and I believe it...It was a brutal, up-close, personal thing with Isaac. If you look at the timeline, something doesn't add up.&quot;<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a></p>
<p>Due to the absence of Hayes, Chef was voiced in &quot;<a href="The_Return_of_Chef" title="wikilink">The Return of Chef</a>&quot; using pre-recorded snippets of dialog culled from previous episodes, and was written out of the series by the episode's ending.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a></p>

<p><a href="University_of_Delaware" title="wikilink">University of Delaware</a> <a href="philosophy" class="uri" title="wikilink">philosophy</a> professor <a href="Richard_Hanley" title="wikilink">Richard Hanley</a> analyzed the mythology of Scientology as it relates to the episode &quot;Trapped in the Closet,&quot; in his 2007 book: <em><a href="South_Park_and_Philosophy:_Bigger,_Longer,_and_More_Penetrating" title="wikilink">South Park and Philosophy: Bigger, Longer, and More Penetrating</a></em>.<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a><a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a> Hanley called the <a href="Xenu" title="wikilink">Xenu story</a>, as presented in the episode, &quot;utterly ridiculous&quot;. He compared Scientology's mythology to Christianity's <a href="Virgin_Birth" title="wikilink">Virgin Birth</a> and the <a href="transubstantiation" class="uri" title="wikilink">transubstantiation</a>, stating, &quot;Let's be honest, these beliefs are just as ridiculous as those of Scientology.&quot;<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a><a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a> Hanley went on to delve into a philosophical analysis of the &quot;evidential weight&quot; of popularity and tradition in determining the &quot;robustness&quot; of beliefs.<a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a></p>
<p><a href="Southwest_Minnesota_State_University" title="wikilink">Southwest Minnesota State University</a> philosophy professor Robert Arp also analyzed the philosophical and cultural aspects of the episode, in his book: <em><a href="South_Park_and_Philosophy:_You_Know,_I_Learned_Something_Today" title="wikilink">South Park and Philosophy: You Know, I Learned Something Today</a></em>.<a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a> Arp analyzed <a href="Comedy_Central" title="wikilink">Comedy Central</a>'s reaction to the episode itself, in a section of his book entitled &quot;2005-2006: Comedy Central Caves&quot;.<a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a> Arp mentions <em>South Park's</em> usage of the onscreen caption&lt;U+2014&gt;&quot;This is what Scientologists actually believe.&quot;&lt;U+2014&gt;in the episode, noting that the same device was used in the episode &quot;<a href="All_About_Mormons" title="wikilink">All About Mormons</a>&quot;. In referencing this similar use of the onscreen caption device, Arp seemed to point to an inconsistency in the behavior of Comedy Central relative to the episode. He explained, &quot;By a long shot, this show was more kind to Scientology than was &quot;All About the Mormons&quot; to Mormonism.&quot;<a href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a> He noted Comedy Central had suggested it would not rebroadcast the episode for the second time, though it later announced on <a href="July_12" title="wikilink">July 12</a>, <a href="2006" class="uri" title="wikilink">2006</a> that it would.<a href="#fn67" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a></p>

<p>Robert Arp cited the series' winning a <a href="Peabody_Award" title="wikilink">Peabody Award</a> due to its willingness to criticize intolerance in April 2006 as a: &quot;special concern for criticizing and countering intolerance,&quot; and the notion that: &quot;the Church of Scientology suffers from the widely held perceptions that it seeks to silence former members and others who criticize its beliefs and practices,&quot; as the motivation behind the episode.<a href="#fn69" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref69"><sup>69</sup></a></p>

Even political blogger Andrew Sullivan encouraged a boycott of the movie, based on claims that Cruise allegedly forced Comedy Central to censor a South Park episode about scientologists. &quot;Make sure you don't go see Paramount's 'Mission: Impossible III,' Cruise's upcoming movie,&quot; Sullivan blogged. &quot;I know you weren't going to see it anyway. But now any money you spend on this movie is a blow against freedom of speech. Boycott it. Tell your friends to boycott it.&quot;<a href="#fnref37" class="footnote-back">↩</a></li>

&quot;Trapped in the Closet&quot; was nominated for an Emmy in July. The network showed its appreciation by running a full-page ad in Variety with the &quot;South Park&quot; boys saying, &quot;C'mon, Jews! Show them who really runs Hollywood.&quot; The episode has been rerun many times since.<a href="#fnref51" class="footnote-back">↩</a></li>
