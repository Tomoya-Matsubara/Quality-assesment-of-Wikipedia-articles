<p><strong>Flat Holm</strong> (<a href="Welsh_language" title="wikilink">Welsh</a>: <em>Ynys Echni</em>) is a limestone <a href="island" class="uri" title="wikilink">island</a> lying in the <a href="Bristol_Channel" title="wikilink">Bristol Channel</a> approximately  from <a href="Lavernock_Point" title="wikilink">Lavernock Point</a> in <a href="Glamorgan" class="uri" title="wikilink">Glamorgan</a>. It includes the most southerly point of <a href="Wales" class="uri" title="wikilink">Wales</a>.</p>
<p>The island has a long history of occupation, dating at least from <a href="Anglo-Saxon" class="uri" title="wikilink">Anglo-Saxon</a> and <a href="Viking" class="uri" title="wikilink">Viking</a> periods. Religious uses include visits by disciples of <a href="Saint_Cadoc" title="wikilink">Saint Cadoc</a> in the 6th century, and in 1835 it was the site of the foundation of the Bristol Channel Mission, which later became the <a href="Mission_to_Seafarers" title="wikilink">Mission to Seafarers</a>. A <a href="sanatorium" class="uri" title="wikilink">sanatorium</a> for <a href="cholera" class="uri" title="wikilink">cholera</a> patients was built in 1896 as the isolation hospital for the port of <a href="Cardiff" class="uri" title="wikilink">Cardiff</a>. <a href="Guglielmo_Marconi" title="wikilink">Guglielmo Marconi</a> transmitted the first <a href="wireless" class="uri" title="wikilink">wireless</a> signals over open sea from Flat Holm to <a href="Lavernock" class="uri" title="wikilink">Lavernock</a>. Because of frequent shipwrecks a <a href="lighthouse" class="uri" title="wikilink">lighthouse</a> was built on the island, which was replaced by a <a href="Trinity_House" title="wikilink">Trinity House</a> lighthouse in 1737. Because of its strategic position on the approaches to <a href="Bristol" class="uri" title="wikilink">Bristol</a> and Cardiff a series of gun emplacements, known as Flat Holm Battery, were built in the 1860s as part of a <a href="Palmerston_Forts,_Bristol_Channel" title="wikilink">line of defences</a>, known as <a href="Palmerston_Forts" title="wikilink">Palmerston Forts</a>. On the outbreak of <a href="World_War_II" title="wikilink">World War II</a>, the island was rearmed.</p>
<p>It is now managed by <a href="Cardiff_Council" title="wikilink">Cardiff Council's</a> Flat Holm Project Team and designated as a <a href="Local_Nature_Reserve" title="wikilink">Local Nature Reserve</a>, <a href="Site_of_Special_Scientific_Interest" title="wikilink">Site of Special Scientific Interest</a> and a <a href="Special_Protection_Area" title="wikilink">Special Protection Area</a>, because of the maritime grassland and rare plants such as <a href="Limonium_binervosum" title="wikilink">Rock Sea-Lavender</a> (<em>Limonium binervosum</em>) and <a href="Wild_Leek" title="wikilink">Wild Leek</a> (<em>Allium ampeloprasum</em>). The island also has significant breeding colonies of <a href="Lesser_Black-backed_Gull" title="wikilink">Lesser Black-backed Gull</a> (<em>Larus fuscus</em>), <a href="Herring_Gull" title="wikilink">Herring Gull</a> (<em>Larus argentatus</em>) and <a href="Great_Black-backed_Gull" title="wikilink">Great Black-backed Gull</a> (<em>Larus marinus</em>). It is also home to <a href="Slow_worm" title="wikilink">Slow worms</a> (<em>Anguis fragilis</em>) with larger than usual blue markings.</p>
<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<p>The first traces of human habitation of the island are from the late <a href="Bronze_Age" title="wikilink">Bronze Age</a>, 900 to 700 BC, known as the <a href="Ewart_Park_Phase" title="wikilink">Ewart Park Phase</a>. A <a href="bronze" class="uri" title="wikilink">bronze</a> axe head was discovered on the island in 1988, between the island's modern lone farmhouse and West Beach, at .<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> In the <a href="Sub-Roman_Britain" title="wikilink">sub-Roman</a> period of the 6th century AD, it became a retreat for <a href="Gildas" title="wikilink">Saint Gildas</a>, who lived on the island as a hermit.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> His friend, <a href="Cadoc" title="wikilink">Saint Cadoc</a> lived at the same time on nearby <a href="Barry_Island" title="wikilink">Barry Island</a>, and the two sometimes met up for prayers.

<p>In June 1815, a Dr. Thomas Turner visited Flat Holm in a small boat and was stranded for a week due to high winds. He discovered two <a href="Christian" class="uri" title="wikilink">Christian</a> graves located close together in a field  northeast of the island's present farmhouse; one grave had been opened and contained a male skeleton inside.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> The open grave's headstone was made of <a href="Purbeck_Marble" title="wikilink">purbeck marble</a> and engraved with a <a href="Celtic_cross" title="wikilink">Celtic cross</a>, but had since broken in two.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> A second disturbed grave marked with headstone was found to the southeast and contained a coffin constructed with iron bolts.

<p><a href="Anglo-Saxons" class="uri" title="wikilink">Anglo-Saxons</a> called the island <em>Bradanreolice</em>. <em>Reolice</em> derives from an Irish word meaning churchyard or graveyard, alluding to the belief that the island had some type of religious meaning to people at the time.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> However, the island's current name of &quot;Holm&quot; comes from the <a href="Old_Norse" title="wikilink">Old Norse</a> meaning &quot;island in an estuary&quot;.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> Records indicate that a <a href="Viking" class="uri" title="wikilink">Viking</a> fleet from the south of <a href="Brittany" class="uri" title="wikilink">Brittany</a> led by two earls, Other and Hroald, took refuge on the island following their defeat by the <a href="Saxons" class="uri" title="wikilink">Saxons</a> at <a href="Watchet" class="uri" title="wikilink">Watchet</a>.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a><a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<p>The <a href="Anglo-Saxon_Chronicle" title="wikilink">Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</a> records that in 1067, <a href="Gytha_Thorkelsd&lt;U+00F3&gt;ttir" title="wikilink">Gytha Thorkelsd&lt;U+00F3&gt;ttir</a>, mother of <a href="Harold_Godwinson" title="wikilink">Harold II</a>, the last Anglo-Saxon king of England, stayed on the island before travelling to <a href="St._Omer" title="wikilink">St. Omer</a> in France after the <a href="Norman_Conquest" title="wikilink">Norman invasion of Britain</a>.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> After the invasion, Lord <a href="Robert_Fitzhamon" title="wikilink">Robert Fitzhamon</a>, a cousin of <a href="William_the_Conquerer" title="wikilink">William the Conquerer</a>, formed the <a href="Glamorgan" title="wikilink">Shire of Glamorgan</a> in Wales proper, with <a href="Cardiff_Castle" title="wikilink">Cardiff Castle</a> at the centre of his new domain.

<p>A survey by archaeologist Howard Thomas in 1979 unearthed a number of medieval <a href="potsherds" class="uri" title="wikilink">potsherds</a> in the vicinity of the farmhouse and found evidence of continuous occupation of the island including <a href="midden" title="wikilink">middens</a> containing numerous animal bones along with oyster and <a href="Cockle_(bivalve)" title="wikilink">cockle</a> shells.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> Fragments of green glazed jugs and flagons from the late 12th to 13th century and shards of pottery from the 14th century were also found on the island. The presence of Pennant <a href="sandstone" class="uri" title="wikilink">sandstone</a> roofing tiles and a fragment of a 14th-century glazed ridge tile indicate the existence of a substantial medieval building, possibly a chapel, demolished when the present farmhouse was constructed. Property records from 1542 show that King <a href="Henry_VIII" title="wikilink">Henry VIII</a> granted a lease to farm the island to a gentleman by the name of Edmund Tournor. His family remained on Flat Holm until the end of the 17th century when the lease passed to Joseph Robins.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
<p>During the 18th century, the island's location made it an ideal base for <a href="smuggling" class="uri" title="wikilink">smuggling</a>. An old mine shaft on the north side of the island connects with a series of natural tunnels, and a concealed exit to the sea.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> Although Flat Holm was in full view of both the Welsh and English coasts, <a href="customs" class="uri" title="wikilink">customs</a> authorities were powerless to act as they had no boat to take them to the island. According to tradition, a small cave in the east cliff at Flat Holm was used for the storage of contraband, mainly tea and brandy.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>

The mission would later become the <a href="Mission_to_Seafarers" title="wikilink">Mission to Seafarers</a>, which provides ministerial services to sailors in over 300 ports.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> A service is held annually to bless the island.</p>
<p>On <a href="May_13" title="wikilink">May 13</a>, <a href="1897" class="uri" title="wikilink">1897</a>, a 22-year-old Italian inventor named <a href="Guglielmo_Marconi" title="wikilink">Guglielmo Marconi</a>, assisted by a <a href="Cardiff" class="uri" title="wikilink">Cardiff</a> Post Office engineer named George Kemp, transmitted the first <a href="wireless" class="uri" title="wikilink">wireless</a> signals over open sea from Flat Holm to <a href="Lavernock" title="wikilink">Lavernock Point</a> near <a href="Penarth" class="uri" title="wikilink">Penarth</a>, <a href="Wales" class="uri" title="wikilink">Wales</a>.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> Having failed to interest the <a href="Italy" title="wikilink">Italian</a> government in his project, Marconi brought his <a href="telegraphy" class="uri" title="wikilink">telegraphy</a> system to Britain.

<h2 id="shipwrecks">Shipwrecks</h2>
<p>The treacherous conditions for ships around the island also led to several shipwrecks.

<p>The Flat Holm project aims to develop the island as a showcase of sustainable technologies. The original power supply consisted of several diesel generators at different properties which were not connected to each other. In 2006, underground cables were installed to form a &lt;U+2018&gt;mini-grid&lt;U+2019&gt; between the farmhouse, workshops and the fog horn keeper's cottage. This was powered with a (13.5 kW) inverter/charger system located at the farmhouse with the farmhouse diesel generator as back-up.</p>
<p>In 2007 the system was extended to include a battery bank charged by two <a href="photovoltaic" class="uri" title="wikilink">photovoltaic</a> <a href="Photovoltaic_module" title="wikilink">solar arrays</a>, and by a 6 kW <a href="wind_turbine" title="wikilink">wind turbine</a> sited at the high point of the island where a redundant telecommunications tower was located.<a href="#fn95" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref95"><sup>95</sup></a></p>
