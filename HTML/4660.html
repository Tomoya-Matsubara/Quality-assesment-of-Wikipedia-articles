<p><strong>Robert II</strong> (early 1316 &lt;U+2013&gt; 19 April 1390) became King of Scots in 1371 as the first monarch of the <a href="House_of_Stewart" title="wikilink">House of Stewart</a>. He was the son of <a href="Walter_Stewart,_6th_High_Steward_of_Scotland" title="wikilink">Walter Stewart</a>, hereditary <a href="High_Steward_of_Scotland" title="wikilink">High Steward of Scotland</a> and of <a href="Marjorie_Bruce" title="wikilink">Marjorie Bruce</a>, daughter of <a href="Robert_I_of_Scotland" title="wikilink">Robert I</a> and of his first wife <a href="Isabella_of_Mar" title="wikilink">Isabella of Mar</a>.</p>
<p><a href="Edward_Bruce" title="wikilink">Edward Bruce</a>, Robert I's brother, was named heir ahead of Marjorie but he died without issue on 3 December 1318 in a battle near <a href="Dundalk" class="uri" title="wikilink">Dundalk</a> in Ireland. Marjory by this time had died in a riding accident probably in 1317. Parliament decreed that her infant son, Robert Stewart, was to be heir presumptive but this lapsed on 5 March 1324 on the birth of a son, <a href="David_II_of_Scotland" title="wikilink">David</a>, to King Robert. Robert Stewart inherited the title of <a href="High_Steward_of_Scotland" title="wikilink">High Steward of Scotland</a> on his father's death on 9 April 1326, and a Parliament held in July 1326 confirmed the young Steward as heir should Prince David die without a successor. In 1329 the king died and the six year-old David succeeded to the throne with Sir <a href="Thomas_Randolph,_1st_Earl_of_Moray" title="wikilink">Thomas Randolph, Earl of Moray</a> appointed Guardian of Scotland.</p>
<p><a href="Edward_Balliol" title="wikilink">Edward Balliol</a>, son of King <a href="John_Balliol" title="wikilink">John Balliol</a>, assisted by the English and Scottish nobles disinherited by Robert I, invaded Scotland inflicting heavy defeats on the Bruce party on 11 August 1332 at <a href="Battle_of_Dupplin_Moor" title="wikilink">Dupplin Moor</a> and then again at <a href="Battle_of_Halidon_Hill" title="wikilink">Halidon Hill</a> on 10 July 1333. Robert fought at Halidon, where his uncle and former guardian, Sir James Stewart, was killed. Following this battle, Robert's lands in the west were given by Balliol to his supporter <a href="David_III_Strathbogie" title="wikilink">David Strathbogie</a>, the titular <a href="Earl_of_Atholl" title="wikilink">Earl of Atholl</a>. Robert took refuge in the fortress of <a href="Dumbarton_Castle" title="wikilink">Dumbarton Castle</a> in the <a href="River_Clyde" title="wikilink">Clyde</a> estuary to join his uncle, King David. In May 1334 David escaped to France leaving Robert and <a href="John_Randolph,_3rd_Earl_of_Moray" title="wikilink">John Randolph</a>, Earl of Moray as joint Guardians of the kingdom. Robert succeeded in regaining his lands but following Randolph's capture by the English in July 1335, his possessions were once again targeted by the forces of Balliol and King <a href="Edward_III_of_England" title="wikilink">Edward of England</a>. This may have persuaded Robert to submit to Balliol and the English king and may explain his removal as Guardian by September 1335. The Guardianship transferred to <a href="Sir_Andrew_Murray" title="wikilink">Sir Andrew Murray</a> of Bothwell but following his death in 1338 Robert was re-appointed and retained the office until King David returned from France in June 1341. Robert accompanied David into battle at <a href="Battle_of_Neville&#39;s_Cross" title="wikilink">Neville's Cross</a> on 17 October 1346 but he and <a href="Patrick_V,_Earl_of_March" title="wikilink">Patrick Dunbar, Earl of March</a> escaped or fled the field and David was taken prisoner. In October 1357, the king was ransomed for 100,000 merks to be paid in installments over ten years.</p>
<p>Robert married <a href="Elizabeth_Mure" title="wikilink">Elizabeth Mure</a> c.1348, legitimising his four sons and five daughters. His subsequent marriage to <a href="Euphemia_de_Ross" title="wikilink">Euphemia de Ross</a> in 1355 produced two sons and two surviving daughters and provided the basis of a future dispute regarding the line of succession. Robert joined a rebellion against David in 1363, but submitted to him following a threat to his right of succession. In 1364 David presented a proposal to Parliament that would cancel the remaining ransom debt if it was agreed that a <a href="Plantagenet" class="uri" title="wikilink">Plantagenet</a> heir would inherit the Scottish throne should he die without issue. This was rejected and Robert succeeded to the throne at the age of 55 following David's unexpected death in 1371. England still controlled large sectors in the <a href="Lothians" class="uri" title="wikilink">Lothians</a> and in the <a href="border_country" title="wikilink">border country</a> so King Robert allowed his southern earls to engage in actions in the English zones to regain their territories, halted trade with England and renewed treaties with France. By 1384 the Scots had re-taken most of the occupied lands, but following the commencement of Anglo-French peace talks, Robert was reluctant to commit Scotland to all-out war and obtained Scotland's inclusion in the peace treaty. Robert's peace strategy was a factor in the virtual coup in 1384 when he lost control of the country, first to his eldest son, <a href="Robert_III_of_Scotland" title="wikilink">John</a>, <a href="Earl_of_Carrick" title="wikilink">Earl of Carrick</a>, afterwards King Robert III, and then from 1388 to John's younger brother, <a href="Robert_Stewart,_1st_Duke_of_Albany" title="wikilink">Robert</a>, <a href="Earl_of_Fife" title="wikilink">Earl of Fife</a>, afterwards the first <a href="Duke_of_Albany" title="wikilink">Duke of Albany</a>. Robert II died in <a href="Dundonald_Castle" title="wikilink">Dundonald Castle</a> in 1390 and was buried at <a href="Scone_Abbey" title="wikilink">Scone Abbey</a>.</p>

<p>With the king now imprisoned in England and Randolph dead, the Guardianship once again fell to Robert.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> In 1347 he took the important step of ensuring the <a href="legitimation" class="uri" title="wikilink">legitimation</a> of his four sons, <a href="Robert_III_of_Scotland" title="wikilink">John, Earl of Carrick</a> (the future King Robert III), <a href="Walter_Stewart,_Lord_of_Fife" title="wikilink">Walter, Lord of Fife</a> (d. 1362), <a href="Robert_Stewart,_1st_Duke_of_Albany" title="wikilink">Robert</a> (the future <a href="Duke_of_Albany" title="wikilink">Duke of Albany</a>) and <a href="Alexander_Stewart,_Earl_of_Buchan" title="wikilink">Alexander</a>, Lord of Badenoch (and future <a href="Earl_of_Buchan" title="wikilink">Earl of Buchan</a>), and six daughters by petitioning <a href="Pope_Clement_VI" title="wikilink">Pope Clement VI</a> to allow a <a href="canon_law" title="wikilink">canon law</a> marriage to Elizabeth Mure.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a></p>
<p>Even though an English prisoner, David retained influence in Scotland and Robert had his Guardianship removed by parliament and given jointly to the earls of Mar and Ross and the lord of Douglas&lt;U+2014&gt;this did not last and Robert was once again appointed Guardian by the Parliament of February 1352.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> The paroled David II attended this parliament to present to Robert and the members of the <a href="Three_Estates" title="wikilink">Three Estates</a> the terms for his release. These contained no ransom demand, but required the Scots to name the English prince <a href="John_of_Gaunt" title="wikilink">John of Gaunt</a> as heir presumptive. The Council rejected these terms, with Robert naturally opposed to the proposal threatening as it did his right of succession.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> The king had no option but to return to captivity in England. The English chronicler Henry Knighton recorded:<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a></p>
<blockquote>
<div style= "font-size:90%;">
<p><span style="color:#eee;"></span> ... the Scots refused to have their King unless he entirely renounced the influence of the English, and similarly refused to submit themselves to them. And they warned him that they would neither ransom him nor allow him to be ransomed unless he pardoned them for all their acts and injuries that they had done, and all the offences that they had committed during the time of captivity, and he should give them security for that, or otherwise they threatened to choose another king to rule them.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>By 1354 ongoing negotiations for the king's release reached the stage where a proposal of a straight ransom payment of 90,000 merks to be repaid over nine years, guaranteed by the provision of 20 high-ranking hostages, was agreed&lt;U+2014&gt;this understanding was destroyed by Robert when he bound the Scots to a French action against the English in 1355.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> The capture of Berwick together with the presence of the French on English soil jolted Edward III into moving against the Scots&lt;U+2014&gt;in January 1356 Edward led his forces into the south-east of Scotland and burned <a href="Edinburgh" class="uri" title="wikilink">Edinburgh</a> and <a href="Haddington,_East_Lothian" title="wikilink">Haddington</a> and much of the <a href="Lothians" class="uri" title="wikilink">Lothians</a> in a campaign that became known as the 'Burnt Candlemas'.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> After Edward's victory over France in September, the Scots resumed negotiations for David's release ending in October 1357 with the <a href="Treaty_of_Berwick_(1357)" title="wikilink">Treaty of Berwick</a>.

<h2 id="historiography">Historiography</h2>
<p>The reign of Robert II has undergone a re-appraisal since the works of historians <a href="Gordon_Donaldson" title="wikilink">Gordon Donaldson</a> (1967) and Ranald Nicholson (1974). Donaldson admits to a paucity of knowledge (at the time that he was writing) regarding Robert's reign and accepts that the early chroniclers writing near to his reign found little to criticise.<a href="#fn86" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref86"><sup>86</sup></a> Robert's career before and after he succeeded to the throne is described by Donaldson as &quot;to say the least, undistinguished, and his reign did nothing to add lustre to it.&quot; <a href="#fn87" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref87"><sup>87</sup></a> Donaldson goes further and debates the legality of the canon law marriage of Robert and Elizabeth Mure following the papal dispensation but acknowledges that the acts of succession in 1371 and 1372 although sealing the matter in the eyes of Parliament did not end the generational feud of the descendants of Elizabeth Mure and of those of Euphemia Ross.<a href="#fn88" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref88"><sup>88</sup></a> Robert's earlier participation in combat at the battles of Halidon and Neville's Cross, according to Donaldson, had made him wary of sanctioning military expeditions against the English and that any such actions by his barons were concealed from him.<a href="#fn89" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref89"><sup>89</sup></a> Similarly, Nicholson described Robert's reign as deficient and that his lack of the skills of governance led to internal strife. Nicholson asserts that the Earl of Douglas was bought off following his armed demonstration just before Robert's coronation and associates this with the doubt surrounding the legitimacy of Robert's sons with Elizabeth Mure.<a href="#fn90" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref90"><sup>90</sup></a></p>
<p>In contrast, the historians Stephen Boardman (2007), Alexander Grant (1984 &amp; 1992) and Michael Lynch (1992) give a more even-handed appraisal of Robert II's life.<a href="#fn91" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref91"><sup>91</sup></a> Modern historians show a kingdom that had become wealthier and more stable particularly during the first decade of his rule.<a href="#fn92" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref92"><sup>92</sup></a> Boardman explains that Robert II was subjected to negative propaganda while he was High Steward&lt;U+2014&gt;David II's followers denigrated his conduct during his lieutenancies and described them as &quot;tyranny&quot;&lt;U+2014&gt;and again later as king when the supporters of his son John, Earl of Carrick said that Robert was a king lacking drive and accomplishments, weighed down by age and unfit to govern.<a href="#fn93" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref93"><sup>93</sup></a><a href="#fn94" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref94"><sup>94</sup></a> Robert II's association with Gaelic Scotland also drew criticism. He grew up in his ancestral lands in the west and was completely at ease with the Gaelic language and culture and possessed a potent relationship with the Gaelic lords in the <a href="Hebrides" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hebrides</a>, upper <a href="Perthshire" class="uri" title="wikilink">Perthshire</a> and <a href="Argyll" class="uri" title="wikilink">Argyll</a>. Throughout his reign, Robert spent long periods in his Gaelic heartlands and complaints at the time in <a href="Scottish_Lowlands" title="wikilink">Lowland Scotland</a> seem to have been influenced by the view that the king was too much involved in Gaelic concerns.<a href="#fn95" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref95"><sup>95</sup></a> Boardman also asserts that much of the negative views held of Robert II find their origins in the writings of the French chronicler <a href="Jean_Froissart" title="wikilink">Jean Froissart</a> who recorded that '[the king] had red bleared eyes, of the colour of sandalwood, which clearly showed that he was no valiant man, but one who would remain at home than march to the field'.<a href="#fn96" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref96"><sup>96</sup></a> Contrary to Froissart's view, the early Scottish chroniclers&lt;U+2014&gt;<a href="Andrew_of_Wyntoun" title="wikilink">Andrew of Wyntoun</a> and <a href="Walter_Bower" title="wikilink">Walter Bower</a> (who both utilised a source that was nearly contemporary with Robert II)â€”and later 15th and 16th century Scottish chroniclers and poets showed 'Robert II as a Scottish patriotic hero, a defender of the integrity of the Scottish kingdom, and as the direct heir to Robert I'.<a href="#fn97" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref97"><sup>97</sup></a></p>
<p>Grant (1992) acknowledges that Robert II's reign in terms of foreign and domestic policy was &quot;not so unsuccessful&quot;.<a href="#fn98" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref98"><sup>98</sup></a> As far as William, Earl of Douglas's reaction was concerned when he staged an armed demonstration before Robert's coronation, Grant does not hold to the view that Douglas was in some way demonstrating against Robert's legitimate right to the throne but more an assertion that royal patronage should not continue as in the time of David II. Grant also advocates that the demonstration was aimed at father and son Robert and Thomas Erskine who held the castles of Edinburgh, Stirling and Dumbarton from Robert's predecessor.<a href="#fn99" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref99"><sup>99</sup></a> Grant seriously called into question the dependability of Froissart's writings as an effective source for Robert II's reign.<a href="#fn100" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref100"><sup>100</sup></a> Influential magnate coalitions headed by Carrick, having undermined the king's position, manipulated the Council of November 1384 to effectively oust Robert II from any real power.<a href="#fn101" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref101"><sup>101</sup></a> Grant gives little weight to the asserted senility of Robert and suggests that the deposition of Carrick in 1388 and then the resolution to join the Anglo-French truce of 1389 were both at the instigation of Robert II.<a href="#fn102" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref102"><sup>102</sup></a> Yet power was not handed back to Robert II but to Carrick's younger brother, Robert, earl of Fife which once again saw the king at the disposition of one of his sons.<a href="#fn103" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref103"><sup>103</sup></a> Despite this, the now unknown source whom both Wyntoun and Bower relied on made the point that Fife deferred to his father on affairs of state emphasising the difference in styles in the guardianships of his two sons.<a href="#fn104" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref104"><sup>104</sup></a></p>
<p>Michael Lynch points out that Robert II's reign from 1371 until the lieutenancy of Carrick in 1384 had been one exemplified by continued prosperity and stability and which Abbot Bower described as a period of &quot;tranquility, prosperity and peace&quot;.<a href="#fn105" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref105"><sup>105</sup></a> Lynch suggests that the troubles of the 1450s between <a href="James_II_of_Scotland" title="wikilink">James II</a> and the Douglases which have been interpreted by some historians as the legacy of Robert II's policy of encouraging powerful lordships was in fact a continuation of David II's build up of local lords in the Marches and <a href="Galloway" class="uri" title="wikilink">Galloway</a>â€”Robert was satisfied with government to leave alone the Douglas and the Stewart earls in their fiefdoms.<a href="#fn106" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref106"><sup>106</sup></a> The weakening of government if anything, Lynch suggests, came not before the 1384 coup but after it despite the fact that the coup had at its root Robert II's favouring of his third son, <a href="Alexander_Stewart,_Earl_of_Buchan" title="wikilink">Alexander Stewart, Earl of Buchan</a> (known as the Wolf of Badenoch).<a href="#fn107" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref107"><sup>107</sup></a></p>
