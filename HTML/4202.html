<h2 id="susan-lawrence-dana">Susan Lawrence Dana</h2>
<p>In 1902, Susan Lawrence Dana (1862-1946) was an independent woman and heiress to a substantial fortune, including <a href="silver" class="uri" title="wikilink">silver</a> mines in the <a href="Rocky_Mountains" title="wikilink">Rocky Mountains</a>. Widowed in 1900, Dana enjoyed complete control over her household and fortune. Eager to express her personality and to become the leading hostess in Springfield, Dana decided to completely remodel her family's <a href="Italianate" class="uri" title="wikilink">Italianate</a> mansion located in the state capital's fashionable &quot;Society Hill&quot; neighborhood.</p>
<p>Susan Lawrence Dana's search for an architect to match her aspirations ended when she was introduced to <a href="Frank_Lloyd_Wright" title="wikilink">Frank Lloyd Wright</a>, the rising leader of a new movement in architecture.</p>
<h2 id="frank-lloyd-wright">Frank Lloyd Wright</h2>
<p>In 1893, Frank Lloyd Wright (1867-1959) left the office of his mentor, <a href="Louis_Sullivan" title="wikilink">Louis Sullivan</a>, and began to practice as an independent architect. Fully agreeing with Sullivan's doctrine of &quot;organic architecture&quot;, Wright expanded it into a full-fledged system of congruence between the interior of a building and its surroundings, which came to be called the &quot;<a href="Prairie_Style" title="wikilink">Prairie Style</a>&quot;.</p>
<p>Susan Lawrence Dana's 1902 commission to Wright to plan the &quot;remodeling&quot; of the Lawrence's <a href="Victorian_architecture" title="wikilink">Victorian</a> mansion was the largest commission that Wright had enjoyed up to that time. The egotistical architect, who recognized a kindred spirit in Mrs. Dana, expanded the boundaries of his commission to design and build what was, in effect, an entirely new house.</p>
<h2 id="dana-house">Dana House</h2>
<p><img src="Dana_Elevation.jpg" title="fig:South and East exterior elevations" alt="South and East exterior elevations" width="300" /> This house was a showcase for Wright's Prairie Style and reflected Susan Lawrence Dana's flamboyant personality, and their mutual love of Japanese prints and drawings. The house was designed for display and entertainment. An arched doorway admitted guests into a series of expanding spaces, the vestibule and reception hall.</p>
<p>The concept of &quot;expanding space&quot; was repeated throughout the house, with <a href="window" title="wikilink">windows</a> placed so as to continually draw the resident or guest into an awareness of the outside. Wright designed more than 250 art-glass windows, doors, and light panels for the house, most of which survive. Much of the art glass, and the mural by <a href="George_Mann_Niedecken" title="wikilink">George Mann Niedecken</a> surmounting the dining room interior, centered on a <a href="sumac" class="uri" title="wikilink">sumac</a> motif.</p>
<p>A substantial west wing leads visitors through an interior <a href="Torii" class="uri" title="wikilink">Torii</a> gate into two of the largest rooms in the house. The ground-level <a href="library" class="uri" title="wikilink">library</a> contains special easels designed by Wright for Dana to display her collection of Japanese prints, part of the more than 100 pieces of Wright-designed <a href="white_oak" title="wikilink">white oak</a> furniture in the house.</p>
<p>Susan Lawrence Dana lived in the Dana-Thomas House for approximately 24 years, from 1904 until about 1928. At first a successful hostess and leader of Springfield's social scene, she later became increasingly reclusive and turned her attention to <a href="spiritualism" class="uri" title="wikilink">spiritualism</a> and the <a href="occult" class="uri" title="wikilink">occult</a>. Suffering from increasing financial constraints in her later years, she closed the main house about 1928 and moved to a small cottage on the grounds. As Dana struggled with age-related <a href="dementia" class="uri" title="wikilink">dementia</a> in the 1940s, her home and its contents were sold.</p>
<h2 id="dana-thomas-house-today">Dana-Thomas House today</h2>
<p>Charles C. Thomas, a successful medical publisher, was the second owner and custodian of the Dana-Thomas House in 1944-1981. He and his wife are credited with maintaining the house's original furnishings and design, and with selling the home and its furnishings as a unit to the state of Illinois in 1981 for significantly less than could have been earned had the household been broken up.</p>
<p>The <a href="Illinois_Historic_Preservation_Agency" title="wikilink">Illinois Historic Preservation Agency</a> took control of the mansion in 1985 and led a restoration effort that has refitted the house to its 1906 appearance. It is believed to contain one of the most intact Frank Lloyd Wright architectural interiors in the United States.</p>
