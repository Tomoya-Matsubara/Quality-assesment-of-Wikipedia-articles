<p><img src="Macromaraschino.jpg" title="fig:A close-up of a Maraschino cherry" alt="A close-up of a Maraschino cherry" /> A <strong>maraschino cherry</strong> is a preserved, sweetened <a href="cherry" class="uri" title="wikilink">cherry</a>, typically made from light-colored sweet cherries such as the <a href="Royal_Ann_cherry" title="wikilink">Royal Ann</a>, <a href="Rainier_cherry" title="wikilink">Rainier</a>, or Gold varieties. The cherries are first preserved in a <a href="brine" class="uri" title="wikilink">brine</a> solution (usually <a href="sulfur_dioxide" title="wikilink">sulfur dioxide</a>) or <a href="ethanol" title="wikilink">alcohol</a>, then soaked in a <a href="Suspension_(chemistry)" title="wikilink">suspension</a> of <a href="food_coloring" title="wikilink">food coloring</a>, <a href="sugar" class="uri" title="wikilink">sugar</a> <a href="syrup" class="uri" title="wikilink">syrup</a>, artificial and natural flavors, and other components. Maraschino cherries <a href="Food_coloring" title="wikilink">dyed</a> <a href="red" class="uri" title="wikilink">red</a> are typically <a href="almond" class="uri" title="wikilink">almond</a>-flavored, while cherries dyed <a href="green" class="uri" title="wikilink">green</a> are usually <a href="peppermint" class="uri" title="wikilink">peppermint</a>-flavored.</p>
<p>Further steps along this process make glace and crystallized cherries; after soaking, the cherries are drained and then soaked in <a href="glucose" class="uri" title="wikilink">glucose</a> and air-dried, producing glace cherries; a further stage involves another soaking in glucose which coats them with sugar, creating crystallized cherries.</p>
<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<p>The name <em>maraschino</em> refers to the <a href="marasca_cherry" title="wikilink">marasca cherry</a> and the <a href="maraschino" class="uri" title="wikilink">maraschino</a> <a href="liqueur" class="uri" title="wikilink">liqueur</a> made from it, in which maraschino cherries were originally preserved. They were, at first, produced for and consumed as a delicacy by royalty and the wealthy. Today they are a common dessert and drink garnish. <a href="Carmine" class="uri" title="wikilink">Carmine</a>, the coloring agent commonly used as a food dye, is derived from the <a href="Cochineal" class="uri" title="wikilink">Cochineal</a> insect leading to the common myth that beetles are used in the production process.</p>
<h3 id="in-the-u.s.">In the U.S.</h3>

<p>The cherries were first introduced in the <a href="United_States" title="wikilink">United States</a> in the late <a href="19th_century" title="wikilink">19th century</a>, where they were served in fine <a href="restaurant" title="wikilink">restaurants</a>. By the turn of the century, American producers were experimenting with flavors such as the almond extract used today and substituting <a href="Queen_Anne_cherry" title="wikilink">Queen Anne cherries</a> for marasca cherries. In 1912, the U.S. <a href="Food_and_Drug_Administration" title="wikilink">Food and Drug Administration</a> legally defined &quot;maraschino cherries&quot; as marasca cherries preserved in maraschino under the <a href="Food_and_Drugs_Act_of_1906" title="wikilink">Food and Drugs Act of 1906</a>; the artificially colored and sweetened Queen Ann variety had to be called &quot;Imitation Maraschino Cherries&quot; instead.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>During <a href="Prohibition_in_the_United_States" title="wikilink">Prohibition in the United States</a> as of 1920, the decreasingly popular alcoholic variety was illegal as well. <a href="Ernest_H._Wiegand" title="wikilink">Ernest H. Wiegand</a>, a professor of <a href="horticulture" class="uri" title="wikilink">horticulture</a> at <a href="Oregon_State_University" title="wikilink">Oregon State University</a>, developed the modern method of manufacturing maraschino cherries using a brine solution rather than alcohol. Thus, most modern maraschino cherries have only a historical connection with the liqueur maraschino. It was not until after <a href="Repeal_of_Prohibition" title="wikilink">Prohibition was repealed</a> in 1933 that the FDA revisited its policy towards canned cherries in <a href="1939" class="uri" title="wikilink">1939</a>. Since <a href="1940" class="uri" title="wikilink">1940</a>, &quot;maraschino cherries&quot; have been defined as &quot;cherries which have been dyed red, impregnated with sugar and packed in a sugar si rup flavored with oil of bitter almonds or a similar flavor&quot; [sic].<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>Myth: Prohibition is what pushed Wiegand to find a better way to make maraschinos, because manufacturers couldn't use alcohol to preserve the cherries anymore.</p>
<p>Fact: According to Bob Cain, who worked with Wiegand at OSU, Prohibition didn't have anything to do with Wiegand's research: His focus was on how to make a better brining process for cherries, one that wouldn't turn them soft. At the time Wiegand began his research, people were already using all kinds of ways to preserve maraschino cherries other than alcohol, long before Prohibition went into effect. What Wiegand did, Payne says, was take a process that people had their own recipes for -- &quot;and who knows what they were putting in there&quot; (frequently not alcohol) -- and turned it into a science, something replicable.</p>
<p>At the time Wiegand began his research, sodium metabisulfite already was being used to preserve maraschino cherries. Some accounts indicate that this preservation method was being used long before Prohibition even went into effect.</p>
<p>Some manufacturers used maraschino or imitation liqueurs to flavor the cherries, but newspaper stories from the early part of the century suggest that a lot of manufacturers had stopped using alcohol altogether before Prohibition started.</p>
<p>Maraschino cherries are an important ingredient in many <a href="cocktail" title="wikilink">cocktails</a>. As a garnish, they often decorate baked <a href="ham" class="uri" title="wikilink">ham</a>, <a href="cakes" title="wikilink">cake</a>, <a href="pastry" class="uri" title="wikilink">pastry</a>, <a href="parfait" title="wikilink">parfaits</a>, <a href="milkshake" title="wikilink">milkshakes</a>, <a href="ice_cream_sundae" title="wikilink">ice cream sundaes</a>, and <a href="ice_cream_soda" title="wikilink">ice cream sodas</a>. They can also be found as an accompaniment to <a href="paan#Varieties" title="wikilink">sweet paan</a>.</p>
