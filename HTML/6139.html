<p><strong>Donald Allan Figueroa</strong> is an <a href="Filipino_American" title="wikilink">Filipino American</a> comic artist (<a href="penciller" class="uri" title="wikilink">penciller</a>). He is best known for his work on many different <a href="Transformers_(toy_line)" title="wikilink">Transformers</a> designs, for both the defunct <a href="Dreamwave_Productions" title="wikilink">Dreamwave Productions</a> and with <a href="IDW_Publishing" title="wikilink">IDW Publishing</a>.</p>
<p>Figueroa has been a long-time fan of Transformers, going so far as to write and illustrate his own comic (<em>Macromasters</em>) and even built built working models of his own characters. Soon after Dreamwave acquired the Transformers license to produce comics, Figueroa was tapped by Dreamwave as a penciller.</p>

<p>One of Figueroa's projects was to illustrate Dreamwave's first <em><a href="Transformers:_The_War_Within" title="wikilink">Transformers: The War Within</a></em> miniseries. In the series, Figueroa was tasked to design new alternate modes for the Generation 1 Transformers, based on the fact that the series is set long before their arrival on Earth. For the sake of realism, Figueroa was asked to design his alternate modes so that they could actually transform. He did this so skillfully that fans clamored for <em>War Within</em>-based toys, which ultimately happened in the <a href="Transformers:_Titanium" title="wikilink">Transformers: Titanium</a> line of <a href="die-cast" class="uri" title="wikilink">die-cast</a> toys.</p>
<p>Figueroa was later brought on to pencil the &quot;Worlds Collide&quot; <a href="story_arc" title="wikilink">story arc</a> on the <em><a href="Transformers:_Armada" title="wikilink">Transformers: Armada</a></em> comic book series, which featured some notable G1 <a href="Decepticon" title="wikilink">Decepticons</a>. He eventually became fully entrenched in the Generation 1 universe when he was named as the penciller for the ongoing Generation 1 comic. He also contributed heavily to their <em>More Than Meets the Eye</em> 8-issue volume of character profiles.</p>
