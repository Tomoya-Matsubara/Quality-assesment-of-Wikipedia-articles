<p><strong>Yanni</strong> (later John) <strong>Alexis Mardas</strong> (born May 5, 1942, <a href="Athens,_Greece" title="wikilink">Athens, Greece</a>) is better known as <strong>Magic Alex</strong>, the name given him by <a href="The_Beatles" title="wikilink">The Beatles</a> when he knew the group between 1965 and 1969, is a self-styled <a href="electronics" class="uri" title="wikilink">electronics</a> wizard and one-time head of The Beatles' <a href="Apple_Corps#Apple_Electronics" title="wikilink">Apple Electronics</a>.</p>
<p>Mardas arrived in England in 1965, exhibiting his <em>Kinetic Light Sculptures</em> at the <a href="Indica_Gallery" title="wikilink">Indica Gallery</a>. Mardas impressed <a href="John_Lennon" title="wikilink">John Lennon</a> with his <em>Nothing Box</em>; a small plastic box with randomly blinking lights, and boasted that he could build a 72-track <a href="magnetic_tape" title="wikilink">tape</a> machine, so was given the job of designing the new <a href="Apple_Studio" title="wikilink">Apple Studio</a> in <a href="Savile_Row" title="wikilink">Savile Row</a>. Mardas failed to live up to his promises of new inventions, which also included electric paint, wallpaper loudspeakers, a flying saucer, and a &quot;sonic force field&quot;. Mardas was involved in the hasty departure of Lennon and <a href="George_Harrison" title="wikilink">George Harrison</a> from the <a href="Maharishi_Mahesh_Yogi" title="wikilink">Maharishi Mahesh Yogi</a>'s ashram in India, and Lennon's divorce of his first wife, <a href="Cynthia_Lennon" title="wikilink">Cynthia Lennon</a>.</p>
<p>In the 1970s, the anti-terrorism industry offered bullet-proof vehicles, bugging devices and security hardware, and Mardas set up various companies offering these products to royalty and VIPs. <a href="Hussein_of_Jordan" title="wikilink">King Hussein of Jordan</a> bought a fleet of cars that Mardas had customised, but the cars proved to be more life-threatening than ordinary vehicles, as bullets easily pierced the supposed armour-plating, and the glass splintered. In 1987, Mardas was a managing director of Alcom Ltd, which specialised in Electronic Communications and Security Systems. He now lives in Greece.</p>

<p>The 21-year-old Yanni Alexis Mardas first arrived in England on a student visa in 1965, befriending <a href="John_Dunbar" title="wikilink">John Dunbar</a> of the Indica Gallery in London, and later moving in with him in a flat on Bentinck Street, which was where Mardas first met Lennon. Shortening his name to Yanni Mardas, he found employment as a television repairman.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> Dunbar later introduced Mardas to <a href="Brian_Jones" title="wikilink">Brian Jones</a>,<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> after Mardas exhibited his <em>Kinetic Light Sculptures</em> at the Indica Gallery.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> Dunbar worked with Mardas on the &lt;U+201C&gt;psychedelic light box&lt;U+201D&gt; for <a href="The_Rolling_Stones" title="wikilink">The Rolling Stones</a>' three-week tour of Europe in 1967,<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> although they were not impressed with the results.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> Dunbar later said: &quot;He was quite cunning in the way he pitched his thing.

<p>Jones introduced Mardas to Lennon, and it was at this point that Mardas impressed Lennon with his <em>Nothing Box</em>; a small plastic box with randomly blinking lights that Lennon would stare at for hours while under the influence of LSD.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> Lennon later introduced the renamed John Alexis Mardas as his &quot;new guru&quot;, calling him &quot;Magic Alex&quot;.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> Mardas told Lennon about his ideas for futuristic electronic devices he was &quot;working on&quot;, such as a telephone that responded to its owner's voice and could identify who was calling,<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> a force field that would surround The Beatles' homes, an X-ray camera, paint that would make anything invisible, car paint that would change colour by flicking a switch, and wallpaper speakers,<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> which would actually be a part of the wallpaper.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> Mardas later asked for the <a href="V-12" class="uri" title="wikilink">V-12</a> engines from Lennon's <a href="Rolls-Royce_Limited" title="wikilink">Rolls-Royce</a> and Harrison's <a href="Ferrari" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ferrari</a> Berlinetta car, so he could build a <a href="Flying_saucer" title="wikilink">Flying saucer</a>.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> The Beatles set up a company for Mardas called Fiftyshapes Ltd., in September 1967,<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> and Mardas later became one of the first employees of the newly formed <a href="Apple_Corps" title="wikilink">Apple Corps</a>, earning &lt;U+00A3&gt;40 a week and receiving 10% of any profits made from his inventions.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a><a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> <img src="Mardas_In_Apple_Electronics.JPG" title="fig:Mardas in the Apple Electronics laboratory with some of the equipment he used" alt="Mardas in the Apple Electronics laboratory with some of the equipment he used" width="250" /> The Beatles often called Mardas the &quot;Greek wizard&quot;,<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> and <a href="Paul_McCartney" title="wikilink">Paul McCartney</a> remembered being interested in his ideas: &lt;U+201C&gt;Well, if you [Mardas] could do that, we&lt;U+2019&gt;d like one.&quot; It was always, 'We&lt;U+2019&gt;d like one'.&lt;U+201D&gt;<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> Mardas' ideas were not confined to the realms of electronic wizardry, but included songwriting involvement, with a Lennon-Mardas composition, &quot;<a href="What&#39;s_the_New_Mary_Jane" title="wikilink">What's the New Mary Jane</a>&quot;, originally meant for inclusion on <em><a href="The_Beatles_(album)" title="wikilink">The White Album</a></em>.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a></p>
<p>Mardas was given his own laboratory called Apple Electronics, at 34 Boston Place, Westminster, London, and was helped to obtain a British work <a href="Visa_(document)" title="wikilink">visa</a>. On The Beatles <em>Anthology</em> DVD, Mardas is shown wearing a white laboratory assistant's coat in Apple Electronics (with loud oscillating noises in the background) saying, &quot;Hello, I&lt;U+2019&gt;m Alexis, from Apple Electronics. I would like to say &lt;U+2018&gt;Hello&lt;U+2019&gt; to all my brothers around the world, and to all the girls around the world, and to all the electronic people around the world. That is Apple Electronics.&quot; Mardas then turns and points back to a collection of two portable 2-track recorders in wooden boxes, a 2-track studio recording machine, voltage meters, a hi-fi amplifier, an oscilloscope and a TV screen showing pulsating psychedelic balloon shapes.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> A mysterious fire at the laboratory prevented Mardas from presenting his inventions, but he later said: &quot;I&lt;U+2019&gt;m a rock gardener, and now I&lt;U+2019&gt;m doing electronics. Maybe next year, I make films or poems. I have no formal training in any of these, but this is irrelevant.&quot;<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a></p>

<p>The Beatles had tried in 1964 to buy the  Trinity Island, off the coast of the Greek island of Euboea (resembling a guitar in shape) but the owners were not interested in a sale.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> Lennon was still interested in The Beatles buying or leasing an island to live on together, and discussed it with the other Beatles on 19 July 1967.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> Mardas' father was a major in the Greek secret police, and Mardas explained that through him The Beatles would have access to Greek government connections, which would speed the acquisition of an island,<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> as many islands did have the right certificates of ownership and were subject to government restrictions.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> On 22 July 1967, Harrison and his wife, <a href="Pattie_Boyd" title="wikilink">Pattie Boyd</a>, <a href="Ringo_Starr" title="wikilink">Ringo Starr</a> and <a href="Neil_Aspinall" title="wikilink">Neil Aspinall</a> flew to Athens, where they stayed in Mardas' parents' house overnight until Lennon, his wife and son, McCartney and <a href="Jane_Asher" title="wikilink">Jane Asher</a>, <a href="Pattie_Boyd" title="wikilink">Pattie Boyd</a>'s 16-year-old sister, Paula, <a href="Mal_Evans" title="wikilink">Mal Evans</a> and <a href="Alistair_Taylor" title="wikilink">Alistair Taylor</a> set off for Athens.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a></p>
<p>Their chartered yacht, the MV <em>Arvi</em>, was detained in Crete because of bad weather, so the party had to wait in Athens for three days.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> Taylor complained that on a trip to a small hill village, &quot;We came round a corner of the peaceful road only to find hundreds of photographers clicking away at us&quot;, which Mardas had organised.

<p>Alcohol was not allowed in the Maharishi's <a href="ashram" class="uri" title="wikilink">ashram</a>, but Mardas smuggled some in from Dehra Dun,<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a> and later reported to Lennon and Harrison that the Maharishi had had sex with a young American student,<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> and had made a sexual advance toward <a href="Mia_Farrow" title="wikilink">Mia Farrow</a>.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a> This was not fully supported in Farrow's autobiography, <em>What Falls Away</em> (1997) writing that she may have misinterpreted the supposed sexual advance.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a> Mardas continued to insist the Maharishi was not what he said he was; even making Harrison unsure.

Mardas set up various companies offering these products to royalty and VIPs, using the former King of Greece as his principal salesman.<a href="#fn84" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref84"><sup>84</sup></a> Ex-King <a href="Constantine_II_of_Greece" title="wikilink">Constantine II of Greece</a> (then exiled in Britain) provided contacts to a half a dozen royal families for Mardas, and had close contact with the deposed <a href="Mohammad_Reza_Pahlavi" title="wikilink">Shah of Iran</a>, who had moved to Mexico. The Shah was one of the first customers for the customised bullet-proof cars that Mardas was offering, and was believed to have financially assisted Mardas&lt;U+2019&gt; companies.<a href="#fn85" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref85"><sup>85</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1974, Mardas held an expensive party for the then Spanish heir, <a href="Juan_Carlos_I_of_Spain" title="wikilink">Prince Juan Carlos</a>, which secured Mardas a contract. After the assassination of <a href="Luis_Carrero_Blanco" title="wikilink">Admiral Carrero Blanco</a> the Spanish royal family thought it should acquire more bullet-proof cars, although one car was shipped to England, where it was parked in <a href="Chobham" class="uri" title="wikilink">Chobham</a> for almost a year as nobody knew how to do the work needed to upgrade it. The second contract (worth over &lt;U+00A3&gt;1/2 million) allowed Mardas to set up new security companies: Alcom Devices Ltd, and Night Vision Systems Ltd (under the collective name of &quot;Project Alcom&quot;) in St Albans Mews off <a href="Edgware_Road,_London" title="wikilink">Edgware Road, London</a>. They were founded to provide a sophisticated communications system for Juan Carlos, so he could be in constant contact with his security services.<a href="#fn86" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref86"><sup>86</sup></a> <img src="450SELI_0411.jpg" title="fig:North American-spec Mercedes-Benz 1978 450SEL 6.9" alt="North American-spec Mercedes-Benz 1978 450SEL 6.9" width="250" /> <a href="Qaboos_of_Oman" title="wikilink">The Sultan of Oman</a> ordered six <a href="Mercedes-Benz_450SEL_6.9" title="wikilink">Mercedes 450</a> limousines in 1977, but quickly discovered that they were not as safe as he had been led to believe. His ex-<a href="Special_Air_Service" title="wikilink">SAS</a> bodyguards tested one of the cars in the desert in July 1977, by firing at them, but a bullet hit an emergency air cylinder, which led to the petrol tank blowing up, burning the whole car.<a href="#fn87" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref87"><sup>87</sup></a> The remaining cars were immediately sent back, with a demand to refund the money spent.<a href="#fn88" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref88"><sup>88</sup></a> King Hussein of Jordan had a fleet of cars that Mardas customised, but carried out a safety test on them with live ammunition in November 1977. One eyewitness reported that the cars could be more life-threatening than ordinary vehicles, as bullets easily pierced the armour-plating, and the thick armoured glass broke into jagged splinters when broken. Hussein ordered that the cars be reverted to their previous state.<a href="#fn89" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref89"><sup>89</sup></a> These failures convinced Mardas and Constantine to look at the growing European market for anti-terrorist protection, setting up a factory in London to produce &lt;U+201C&gt;bullet-proof&lt;U+201D&gt; cars in 1978. This was financed by an investment of over &lt;U+00A3&gt;1 million through anonymous Monaco and Swiss bank accounts, which were believed to be controlled by the Shah.<a href="#fn90" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref90"><sup>90</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1987, Mardas was a managing director of Alcom Ltd, at Abbey House, 299A Edgware Road, London. The company specialised in Electronic Communications and Security Systems, but never dealt directly with the public; preferring to work with Government Authorities. Mardas employed Arthur Johnson (known as Johnny Johnson), a former <a href="Ministry_of_Defence_(United_Kingdom)" title="wikilink">M.O.D.</a> official.<a href="#fn91" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref91"><sup>91</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="later-years">Later years</h2>
<p>Mardas put 15 items from his collection of Lennon memorabilia up for sale on 5 May 2004, at <a href="Christie&#39;s" class="uri" title="wikilink">Christie's</a> in South Kensington, London. Among the sale was Lennon&lt;U+2019&gt;s leather collar,<a href="#fn92" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref92"><sup>92</sup></a> worn during 1967 and 1968 (at the launch party for the <em><a href="Sgt._Pepper&#39;s_Lonely_Hearts_Club_Band" title="wikilink">Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band</a></em> LP, and on the cover of Lennon and Ono&lt;U+2019&gt;s <em><a href="Unfinished_Music_No.1:_Two_Virgins" title="wikilink">Unfinished Music No.1: Two Virgins</a></em>) as well as a custom Vox Kensington guitar,<a href="#fn93" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref93"><sup>93</sup></a> a coloured felt pen drawing, called &quot;Strong&quot;, and a pen and ink drawing by Lennon, entitled &lt;U+201C&gt;Happy Fish&lt;U+201D&gt;.<a href="#fn94" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref94"><sup>94</sup></a> Mardas said he planned to donate the money to a charity in Greece.<a href="#fn95" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref95"><sup>95</sup></a></p>
<p><a href="The_Independent" title="wikilink">The Independent</a> newspaper apologised on 21 August 2006, writing that on 14 June 2006, the paper had wrongly reported Mardas' involvement with Apple Electronics Ltd. They corrected the earlier piece by writing that Mardas had not been a company employee, but a director and shareholder of Apple Electronics, and was not sacked, but resigned his directorship in May 1971, while still retaining his shareholding, until giving it to Apple Corps some years later. The paper accepted that Mardas &lt;U+201C&gt;did not claim to have invented electric paint, a flying saucer or a recording studio with a &lt;U+2018&gt;sonic force field&lt;U+2019&gt; or cause his employers to waste money on such ideas. We apologise to Mr. Mardas for these errors.&quot;<a href="#fn96" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref96"><sup>96</sup></a> In 2008, Mardas won the right to sue the New York Times about an online article which said he was a <a href="charlatan" class="uri" title="wikilink">charlatan</a>. In a story about the Maharishi, Allan Kozinn had written: &quot;Alexis Mardas, a supposed inventor and charlatan who had become a Beatles&lt;U+2019&gt; insider&quot;. <a href="#fn97" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref97"><sup>97</sup></a> Mardas is now living in Greece.<a href="#fn98" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref98"><sup>98</sup></a></p>
