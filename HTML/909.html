<p><strong>Cleveland Street</strong> in <a href="central_London" title="wikilink">central London</a> runs north to south from <a href="Euston_Road" title="wikilink">Euston Road</a> (<a href="A501_road" title="wikilink">A501</a>) to the junction of Mortimer Street and Goodge Street. It lies within <a href="Fitzrovia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Fitzrovia</a>, in the <a href="W_postcode_area" title="wikilink">W1</a> post code area. Cleveland Street also runs along part of the border between <a href="Bloomsbury_(ward)" title="wikilink">Bloomsbury (ward)</a> which is located in <a href="London_Borough_of_Camden" title="wikilink">London Borough of Camden</a>, and <a href="West_End_(ward)" title="wikilink">West End (ward)</a> and <a href="Marylebone" class="uri" title="wikilink">Marylebone</a> High Street (ward) in the <a href="City_of_Westminster" title="wikilink">City of Westminster</a>.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>

<p>Cleveland Street marks the border between the <a href="City_of_Westminster" title="wikilink">City of Westminster</a> to its west and the <a href="London_Borough_of_Camden" title="wikilink">London Borough of Camden</a> to the east. This border is ancient, largely following the old divide between the western parish of <a href="Saint_Marylebone" title="wikilink">Saint Marylebone</a> and the parish of <a href="St_Pancras,_London" title="wikilink">Saint Pancras</a> to the east and can be traced back as far as 1792.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> The street was also a boundary between large estates, such as the <a href="Bedford_Estate" title="wikilink">Bedford Estate</a> and the Berners Estate.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> Maps show that the southern end of modern Cleveland Street, beyond Riding House Street, was known as Upper Newman Street and then Norfolk Street. The northern section was once known as Upper Cleveland Street and Buckingham Place.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>The name comes from the <a href="Charles_FitzRoy,_2nd_Duke_of_Cleveland" title="wikilink">Charles FitzRoy, 2nd Duke of Cleveland</a> whose estate was connected in the 19th century with the Southampton (Wriothesley) property <a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> via <a href="Henry_Fitzroy,_1st_Duke_of_Grafton" title="wikilink">Henry Fitzroy, 1st Duke of Grafton</a>. The Southampton property later became the Bedford Estate. Cleveland Street is renowned for several historical events and buildings, the most notable recent one being the <a href="BT_Tower" title="wikilink">BT Tower</a>.</p>
<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<p>The <a href="Cleveland_Street_Scandal" title="wikilink">Cleveland Street Scandal</a> happened in 1889 at 19 Cleveland Street (now demolished) which at the time housed a male <a href="brothel" class="uri" title="wikilink">brothel</a> in which teenage telegraph boys served as prostitutes.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> The scandal allegedly involved <a href="Prince_Albert_Victor,_Duke_of_Clarence_and_Avondale" title="wikilink">Prince Albert Victor, Duke of Clarence and Avondale</a>, heir to the throne of England.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> A show inspired by the <a href="Cleveland_Street_scandal" title="wikilink">Cleveland Street scandal</a> and titled Cleveland Street The Musical - with book and lyrics by <a href="Glenn_Chandler" title="wikilink">Glenn Chandler</a> - is scheduled to run in London between April and May 2011.</p>
<p>In his book <a href="Jack_the_Ripper:_The_Final_Solution" title="wikilink">Jack the Ripper: The Final Solution</a>, <a href="Stephen_Knight_(author)" title="wikilink">Stephen Knight</a> mentions Cleveland Street in conjunction with two houses in the street. According to Knight's theory, the royal family was connected with the <a href="Jack_The_Ripper" title="wikilink">Jack The Ripper</a> murders from 1888, via the same <a href="Prince_Albert_Victor" title="wikilink">Prince Albert Victor</a> who he claims met his later wife, Catholic prostitute Annie Elizabeth Crook, at the studio of the painter <a href="Walter_Sickert" title="wikilink">Walter Sickert</a> at 15 Cleveland Street. After their secret wedding, Annie Elizabeth Crook was allegedly settled in an apartment at 6 Cleveland Street.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> The conspiracy theory behind the murders described in Knight's book has been loosely adapted into <a href="From_Hell" title="wikilink">From Hell</a> (1999), a <a href="graphic_novel" title="wikilink">graphic novel</a> by Alan Moore from which a <a href="From_Hell_(film)" title="wikilink">movie</a> with the same title was adapted in 2001. Several scenes in the movie take place in Cleveland Street, although they were not shot on location.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="notable-buildings">Notable Buildings</h2>
<p>The <a href="Grade_II_listed" title="wikilink">Grade II listed</a> buildings are numbers:<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>

</ul>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="BT_Tower" title="wikilink">BT Tower</a> complex. The tower was London tallest building when it was completed in 1960 and it remains a major <a href="List_of_structures_in_London" title="wikilink">London landmark</a>, being currently the <a href="List_of_tallest_buildings_and_structures_in_London" title="wikilink">8th tallest building</a> in London at 177 metres plus a 12 metre antenna.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The frontage building of the former <a href="Cleveland_Street_workhouse" title="wikilink">Cleveland Street workhouse</a> later Middlesex Hospital annexe and outpatient department on the eastern side of the street at 44 <a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> c.1776. Over the years from 1778 until 2005 the building operated as a workhouse then a workhouse infirmary and more recently as a hospital. UCLH NHS Foundation Trust in 2010 proposed the building's demolition in a planning application (and conservation area consent) submitted to <a href="Camden_London_Borough_Council" title="wikilink">Camden London Borough Council</a> to replace it with a large building mixing private accommodation with commercial space.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a><a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> However adjoining <a href="Westminster_City_Council" title="wikilink">Westminster City Council</a> objected on three grounds on 2 December 2010.<ref>Westminster City Council, <a href="http://idoxpa.westminster.gov.uk/online-applications/files/F03FD32DD1F541CEE9C8C07B8F6125D7/pdf/10_07581_OBS--1988770.pdf"><em>Decision document</em></a></li>
</ul>
<p>1. The City Council considers that the existing building is a heritage asset which makes a positive contribution to the character and appearance of the area. The proposed development would not preserve or enhance this character and appearance. The City Council considers that retention and refurbishment of all or a substantial part of the existing building should be pursued.<br />
</br> 2. The proposals provide insufficient on-street car parking facilities for the development, particularly for the private housing market which would generate significant car parking demand. This would increase the pressure for car parking on surrounding streets to the detriment of highway safety and convenience.<br />
</br> 3. The submitted Daylight, Sunlight and Shadow study shows that the proposed development would result in unacceptable losses of daylight for some of the residential properties on Cleveland Street which face the application site. This would be materially harmful to the local residential environment and lead to an unacceptable reduction in the quality of residential amenity. Retrieved 2011-07-26</ref> The <a href="Cleveland_Street_Workhouse" title="wikilink">Cleveland Street Workhouse</a><a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> is of particular importance in light of the fact that <a href="Charles_Dickens" title="wikilink">Charles Dickens</a> is known to have lived nearby in what is now 22 Cleveland Street. Dickens lived there as a young child between 1815&lt;U+2013&gt;1816 and then again as a teenager between 1828-1831. His residence in the street has led to the suggestion that the nearby workhouse was probably the inspiration for <a href="Oliver_Twist" title="wikilink">Oliver Twist</a>.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
<p>Cleveland Street hosted the <a href="Middlesex_Hospital" title="wikilink">Middlesex Hospital</a>, closed in 2005 and since demolished. The hospital occupied an entire block on the western side of the southern section of the street. The future of this site is currently uncertain, despite its sale by nationalised Icelandic <a href="Kaupthing_Bank" title="wikilink">Kaupthing Bank</a> to <a href="Aviva_Investors" title="wikilink">Aviva Investors</a> and Exemplar Properties.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
<p>Cleveland Street was described as an area of special architectural and historic interest when it was designated a <a href="Conservation_Area_(United_Kingdom)" title="wikilink">Conservation Area</a> on 20 November 1990.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> Anomalously on its Camden side Cleveland Street is part of two conservation areas: the <a href="Fitzroy_Square" title="wikilink">Fitzroy Square</a> conservation area,<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> and the <a href="Charlotte_Street" title="wikilink">Charlotte Street</a> conservation area.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> This double designation is rare and possibly unique.</p>
