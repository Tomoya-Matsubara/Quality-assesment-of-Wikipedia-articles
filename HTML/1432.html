<p><strong><em>The Kinks Are the Village Green Preservation Society</em></strong> is the sixth album by the <a href="England" title="wikilink">English</a> <a href="Rock_music" title="wikilink">rock</a> band <a href="The_Kinks" title="wikilink">The Kinks</a> released on <a href="22_November" title="wikilink">22 November</a> <a href="1968" class="uri" title="wikilink">1968</a>.</p>
<h2 id="production">Production</h2>
<p>Songwriter and band leader <a href="Ray_Davies" title="wikilink">Ray Davies</a> crafted the <a href="concept_album" title="wikilink">concept album</a> as a gentle homage to English <a href="Hamlet_(place)" title="wikilink">hamlet</a> life and, by extension, to the innocence and idealisation of past times and people.</p>



<p>The album theme was inspired by a track recorded by the band in November 1966, &quot;Village Green&quot;, which was inspired by the Kinks' performances in rustic <a href="Devon,_England" title="wikilink">Devon, England</a> in late 1966 (Davies has also stated that <a href="Dylan_Thomas" title="wikilink">Dylan Thomas</a>'s <em><a href="Under_Milk_Wood" title="wikilink">Under Milk Wood</a></em> was an indirect inspiration for the concept). This song neatly sums up the album's broad theme: &quot;I miss the <a href="village_green" title="wikilink">village green</a>, and all the simple people...&quot; In addition to nostalgia, the album's songs touch on a wide range of emotions and experiences, from lost friends (&quot;Do You Remember Walter&quot;), memories (&quot;People Take Pictures of Each Other&quot;, &quot;Picture Book&quot;), bucolic escape (&quot;Animal Farm&quot;), social marginalization (&quot;Johnny Thunder&quot;, &quot;Wicked Annabella&quot;), public embarrassment (&quot;All of My Friends Were There&quot;), childlike fantasy (&quot;Phenomenal Cat&quot;), straying from home (&quot;Starstruck&quot;) and stoical acceptance of life (&quot;Big Sky&quot;, &quot;Sitting By the Riverside&quot;). Davies did not compose many of the songs to fit the predetermined theme of the album, rather their commonality developed naturally from his nostalgic songwriting interests at the time. The title track, one of the last written and recorded (in August 1968), effectively unifies the songs through an appeal to preserve a litany of sentimental objects, experiences, and fictional characters from progress and modern indifference: &quot;God save little shops, china cups, and virginity&quot;. This last lyric inspired the slogan, &quot;God save the Kinks&quot; which was used in the US promotion for the album, and was associated with the band through the 1970s.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>Session keyboardist <a href="Nicky_Hopkins" title="wikilink">Nicky Hopkins</a> contributed significantly to the album. With the exception of true orchestral backing on the early &quot;Village Green&quot; track, the string and woodwind backings on such tracks as &quot;Animal Farm&quot;, &quot;Days&quot;, &quot;Starstruck&quot; and &quot;Phenomenal Cat&quot; were simulated by the <a href="Mellotron" class="uri" title="wikilink">Mellotron</a>, played by both Hopkins and Ray Davies.</p>
<h2 id="reception">Reception</h2>
<p>The record sold poorly upon its initial release and was ignored by pop music audiences. A contributing factor was that none of the album's songs proved viable as a single (&quot;<a href="Days_(The_Kinks_song)" title="wikilink">Days</a>&quot;, a modest UK hit for the band in the summer of 1968, was originally intended for inclusion in the album but was released independently after the failed single &quot;<a href="Wonderboy_(The_Kinks_song)" title="wikilink">Wonderboy</a>&quot;). The album was also stylistically out of step with the music trends of the day and its failure was indicative of the Kinks' commercial decline during this period.</p>
<p>However, the record soon achieved a cult status as one of the band's best and most loved albums. Davies' timing with the album's nostalgic concept proved to be just out of step in the cultural turmoil of 1968, but it soon gained a much greater mainstream appeal. In 2003, the album was ranked number 255 on <em><a href="Rolling_Stone" title="wikilink">Rolling Stone</a></em> magazine's list of <a href="The_500_Greatest_Albums_of_All_Time" title="wikilink">the 500 greatest albums of all time</a>.</p>
<h2 id="follow-up">Follow-up</h2>
<p>From its inception, Davies seems to have considered the album for stage presentation and its general theme served to inspire the Kinks' more ambitious, but less popular, two-part theatrical work &quot;Preservation&quot; in 1972&lt;U+2013&gt;1974. A 2004 three-disc reissue package of the album includes a history of the evolution of the record and a wealth of alternate mixes, bonus tracks and rare material. The album was also the subject of a 2003 book by Andy Miller.</p>

<p>This 12-song version was Ray's initial intended release for the European market. It was released in France, Sweden and Norway in October 1968; it was also released in New Zealand (December 1968) and Italy (January 1969).<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> Ray and Pye had it withdrawn before it was manufactured for UK release and the re-sequenced 15-song version was released there (22 November 1968) and in the United States (January 1969). Apart from sequencing, this early version differs by the absence of &quot;Last of the Steam-Powered Trains&quot;, &quot;Big Sky&quot;, &quot;Sitting by the Riverside&quot;, &quot;Animal Farm&quot; and &quot;All of My Friends Were There&quot;, and the inclusion of &quot;Mr. Songbird&quot; and &quot;Days&quot; (the latter a #12 UK hit single released in June 1968). The stereo mixes of &quot;Do You Remember Walter&quot; and &quot;People Take Pictures Of Each Other&quot; were slightly different from the mono mixes.</p>

<p>In parallel with the 12-song European version, Ray and Reprise Records (the band's U.S. label) initially intended to release an 11-song album for the American market called <em>Four More Respected Gentlemen</em>. The unreleased album was even given a Reprise serial number (RS 6309). However, Reprise at some point decided that the 15-track UK &quot;Village Green&quot; album was suitable for the US market and cancelled plans for this album.

<h2 id="song-and-album-notes">Song and album notes</h2>
<p>In late summer of 1968, the Kinks had hoped to release the album as a two-record set with 20 tracks, but Pye Records rejected this plan. A twelve-track version of the album was released in September 1968 throughout certain European markets; these are now valuable collector's items. Production of this version was quickly halted at Ray Davies's insistence and the final revamped fifteen-track version was released in the UK in November 1968.</p>
<p>U.S. record label Reprise had intended to release many of album's tracks on a separate Kinks album titled <em><a href="Four_More_Respected_Gentlemen" title="wikilink">Four More Respected Gentlemen</a></em> sometime in mid-1968 to fulfil a contractual album obligation. This was in the final stages of pre-production when Reprise dropped all plans to issue it, based on the strength of the forthcoming <em>Village Green</em> album.</p>
<p>&quot;Starstruck&quot; was released as a single in Europe and the United States, and charted in The Netherlands, peaking at #13. This is the only appearance of any track from the album on the hit parade in any country.</p>
<p>A promotional film shot for &quot;Starstruck&quot; in late 1968 is the last surviving footage of the original 1960's Kinks lineup, before Pete Quaife's March 1969 resignation from the band.</p>
<p>The photography used for the album art was shot in August 1968 on Parliament Hill, a part of <a href="Hampstead_Heath" title="wikilink">Hampstead Heath</a>, North London.</p>
<p>Out of print on vinyl for years (it has been consistently available on US Reprise CD since 1990), today the album is reported to be the best-selling non-compilation album in the Kinks' catalogue. Ray Davies has recently referred to it as the <em>&quot;most successful flop of all time&quot;</em>.</p>
<p>&quot;Picture Book&quot;, not one of the singles from the album, became popular after it was used in a 2004 television commercial for <a href="Hewlett-Packard" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hewlett-Packard</a> digital imaging products.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>

<p>The eponymous opening track appears in the film <em><a href="Hot_Fuzz" title="wikilink">Hot Fuzz</a></em> and its soundtrack album. &quot;Village Green&quot; is also featured in the film, but not on the album.</p>
<p>A cover of &quot;The Village Green Preservation Society&quot; by folk singer <a href="Kate_Rusby" title="wikilink">Kate Rusby</a> is used as the theme song for the BBC sitcom <em><a href="Jam_&amp;_Jerusalem" title="wikilink">Jam &amp; Jerusalem</a></em>.</p>
<p>The American punk band <a href="Green_Day" title="wikilink">Green Day</a> &quot;borrowed&quot; the main riff from &quot;Picture Book&quot; for their song &quot;Warning&quot;; the riff has been also used in variations by <a href="Big_&amp;_Rich" title="wikilink">Big &amp; Rich</a> on &quot;Love Train&quot; and by <a href="Steriogram" class="uri" title="wikilink">Steriogram</a> on &quot;<a href="Walkie_Talkie_Man" title="wikilink">Walkie Talkie Man</a>&quot;.</p>
