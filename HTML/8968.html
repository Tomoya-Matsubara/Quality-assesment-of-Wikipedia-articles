<p>In 2010, Sufi Imam Rauf received national attention for his plans to build <a href="Park51" class="uri" title="wikilink">Park51</a>, an Islamic Community Center, two blocks from <a href="World_Trade_Center_site" title="wikilink">Ground Zero</a> in <a href="Lower_Manhattan" title="wikilink">Lower Manhattan</a>.</p>
<h2 id="early-life">Early life</h2>
<p>Rauf was born in <a href="Kuwait" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kuwait</a>. His father, Egyptian Imam and Sunni scholar Muhammad Abdul Rauf (1917&lt;U+2013&gt;2004), moved with the younger Rauf to New York City in the 1960s. The elder Rauf assisted with efforts to create the multimillion dollar <a href="Islamic_Cultural_Center_of_New_York" title="wikilink">Islamic Cultural Center of New York</a>, the first building designed as a mosque in New York City, which took 25 years to complete and opened in 1991.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> His father, Abdul Rauf, was actively involved in the <a href="African-American_Civil_Rights_Movement_(1955&lt;U+2013&gt;1968)" title="wikilink">American Civil Rights Movement</a> with <a href="Malcolm_X" title="wikilink">Malcolm X</a>.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<p>Rauf studied physics at <a href="Columbia_University" title="wikilink">Columbia University</a>, where he earned his Bachelor's Degree in nuclear engineering in 1969,<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a><a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> before earning a master's degree in <a href="plasma_physics" title="wikilink">plasma physics</a> at <a href="Stevens_Institute" title="wikilink">Stevens Institute</a> in <a href="Hoboken,_New_Jersey" title="wikilink">Hoboken, New Jersey</a>.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="career">Career</h2>
<p>After his studies, Rauf focused on his religious aspirations, and became a popular leader of a New York City mosque.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> He also held jobs in teaching, as a salesman and in real estate.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<p>Rauf has written three books on Islam and its place in contemporary <a href="Western_culture" title="wikilink">Western</a> society, including <em>What's Right with Islam</em>, which was later printed in paperback with the changed title <em>What's Right with Islam is What's Right with America</em>.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> Rauf served as imam of Masjid al-Farah at 245 West Broadway in New York City's <a href="Tribeca" class="uri" title="wikilink">Tribeca</a> district between the years 1983 and 2009.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
<p>Rauf worked to build bridges between American society, the American Muslim community and the wider Muslim world. In 1997, he founded the American Society for Muslim Advancement (originally named the American Sufi Muslim Association<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a>), a civil society organization aimed at promoting positive engagement between American society and American Muslims. The organization is now headed by his wife.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> He is a member of the <em>Council of 100 Leaders (C-100) on West-Islamic World Dialogue</em> at the <a href="World_Economic_Forum" title="wikilink">World Economic Forum (WEF)</a><a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a><a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> and has received both the Alliance for International Conflict Prevention and Resolution&lt;U+2019&gt;s<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> annual Alliance Peacebuilder Award and The Interfaith Center of New York&lt;U+2019&gt;s annual James Parks Morton Interfaith Award (2006).<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a><a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> He was a major speaker at the 2009 <a href="Parliament_of_the_World&#39;s_Religions" title="wikilink">Parliament of the World's Religions</a> in <a href="Melbourne,_Australia" title="wikilink">Melbourne, Australia</a>.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a></p>
<p>In 2003, Rauf founded the <a href="Cordoba_Initiative" title="wikilink">Cordoba Initiative</a>, another registered nonprofit organization with offices in both New York and <a href="Kuala_Lumpur" title="wikilink">Kuala Lumpur</a>, <a href="Malaysia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Malaysia</a>. As CEO of Cordoba Initiative, Rauf coordinates projects that emphasize the bonds that connect the Muslim world and the West.</p>
<p>Rauf is a friend of the <a href="Nur_Ashki_Jerrahi_Sufi_Order" title="wikilink">Nur Ashki Jerrahi Sufi Order</a>, and in 1983 was appointed prayer leader at their New York City mosque, Masjid al-Farah.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> In 1997 he founded the American Sufi Muslim Society (ASMA),<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> which has since been renamed the <a href="http://www.asmasociety.org/">American Society for Muslim Advancement</a>.</p>
<p>British author Karen Armstrong said in the introduction to Rauf's book:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Imam Feisal Abdul Rauf ... is a bridge figure because he has deep roots in both worlds. He was educated in Egypt, England, Malaysia and the United States, and his mosque in New York City is only a few blocks away from the World Trade Center. After September 11, people often asked me, &quot;Where are the moderate Muslims? Why are they not speaking out?&quot; In Imam Rauf, we have a Muslim who can speak to Western people in a way they understand.&quot;<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="Fareed_Zakaria" title="wikilink">Fareed Zakaria</a> praised Rauf for speaking of &quot;the need for Muslims to live peacefully with all other religions&quot;, for emphasizing the commonalities among all faiths, for advocating equal rights for women and opposing laws that in any way punish non-Muslims.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a></p>
<p>Walter Isaacson, head of <a href="The_Aspen_Institute" title="wikilink">The Aspen Institute</a>, says Rauf &quot;has participated at the Aspen Institute in Muslim-Christian-Jewish working groups looking at ways to promote greater religious tolerance. He has consistently denounced radical Islam and terrorism, and promoted a moderate and tolerant Islam.&quot;<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a></p>

<h3 id="post-911-comments">Post-9/11 comments</h3>
<p>Following the <a href="September_11_attacks" title="wikilink">September 11 attacks</a>, Rauf conducted training and speeches for the <a href="F.B.I." class="uri" title="wikilink">F.B.I.</a> and <a href="U.S._State_Department" title="wikilink">U.S. State Department</a>.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a></p>

Rauch said that the message was mixed, however, because when then asked if the U.S. deserved the attacks, Rauf answered, &quot;I wouldn't say that the United States deserved what happened. But the United States' policies were an accessory to the crime that happened.&quot;<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a><a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a><a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a><a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> When the interviewer asked Rauf how he considered the U.S. to be an accessory, he replied, &quot;because we have been accessory to a lot of innocent lives dying in the world.

<p>Although this <a href="CIA-Osama_bin_Laden_controversy" title="wikilink">CIA-Osama bin Laden controversy</a> has been brought up by many others, <a href="Rudy_Giuliani" title="wikilink">Rudy Giuliani</a>, <a href="Peter_T._King" title="wikilink">Peter T.

<p>At <em><a href="National_Review" title="wikilink">National Review</a></em>, Dan Foster wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When you say that the United States was &quot;an accessory to the crime&quot; of 9/11, as he did, it tends to blunt my ability to pick up the subtleties of what comes after. That interview was equivocal at every turn, and when moral equivalences are trotted out re: 9/11, the tie goes to &quot;you're either with us, or with the terrorists.&quot; In other words, we are perfectly entitled to suspect that the &quot;accessories to the crime&quot; bit represents the investment, while the &quot;condemning terrorism&quot; bit is merely the hedge.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The editors of the magazine wrote &quot;While he cannot quite bring himself to blame the terrorists for being terrorists, he finds it easy to blame the United States for being a victim of terrorism.&quot;<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a></p>
<p>In 2004, he said the U.S. and the West must acknowledge the harm they have done to Muslims before terrorism can end. Speaking at his New York mosque, Rauf said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Islamic method of waging war is not to kill innocent civilians. But it was Christians in World War II who bombed civilians in Dresden and Hiroshima, neither of which were military targets.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He also said that there could be little progress in Western-Islamic relations until the U.S. acknowledged backing Middle East dictators, and the U.S. President gave an &quot;American Culpa&quot; speech to the Muslim world, because there are &quot;an endless supply of angry young Muslim rebels prepared to die for their cause and there [is] no sign of the attacks ending unless there [is] a fundamental change in the world&quot;.<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="views-on-hamas">Views on Hamas</h3>
<p>During an interview on New York <a href="WABC_(AM)" title="wikilink">WABC</a> radio in June 2010, Rauf declined to say whether he agreed with the <a href="U.S._State_Department" title="wikilink">U.S. State Department</a>'s designation of Hamas as a <a href="terrorist_organization" title="wikilink">terrorist organization</a>. Responding to the question, Rauf said, &quot;Look, I'm not a politician. The issue of terrorism is a very complex question... I am a peace builder. I will not allow anybody to put me in a position where I am seen by any party in the world as an adversary or as an enemy.&quot;<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a> Sarah Palin and Lazio criticized his refusal to agree with the assessment of the United States that Hamas is a terrorist organization, and former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani alleged that Rauf had supported radical causes that sympathized with Islamic terrorism.<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a><a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a><a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a><a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a><a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a></p>
<p>New York's Mayor Bloomberg was asked to comment on whether Rauf is a man of peace, given his background &quot;where he's supposedly supported Hamas, [and] blamed the U.S. for 9/11 attacks&quot;.<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a> Bloomberg responded:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My job is not to vet clergy in this city.... Everybody has a right to their opinions. You don't have to worship there.... this country is not built around ... only those ... clergy people that we agree with. It's built around freedom.

<p>However, when interviewed on CNN September 8, 2010, Rauf had this to say about Hamas:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I condemn everyone and anyone who commits acts of terrorism, and Hamas has committed acts of terrorism.<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>A presence so close to the World Trade Center, &quot;where a piece of the wreckage fell&quot;, said Imam Feisal Abdul Rauf, the cleric leading the project, &quot;sends the opposite statement to what happened on 9/11. We want to push back against the extremists...The location is not designated a mosque, but rather an overflow prayer space for another mosque, Al Farah at 245 West Broadway in TriBeCa, where Imam Feisal is the spiritual leader.&quot;</p>

Mr. El-Gamal agreed. &lt;U+201C&gt;What happened that day,&lt;U+201D&gt; he said, &lt;U+201C&gt;was not Islam.&lt;U+201D&gt;</p>

Imam Feisal Abdul Rauf will be the spiritual leader of the Cordoba House which will be the interfaith and religious component of the center and will reside within Park51.&lt;U+201D&gt;<br />
About Park51: Park51 is a nonsectarian community, cultural and interfaith spiritual center along with a Muslim prayer area and a monument to honor all those we lost on 9/11.</p>

<p>Plans for the project include a mosque which would accommodate 1,000&lt;U+2013&gt;2,000 Muslims in prayer. Rauf won support from the local <a href="Community_Boards_of_New_York_City" title="wikilink">Community Board</a>, and received both support and opposition from some 9/11 families, politicians, organizations, academics, and others. The initiative was supported by some Muslim American leaders and organizations, including <a href="Council_on_American-Islamic_Relations" title="wikilink">CAIR</a>, and criticized by some other Muslims such as Sufi <a href="Mysticism" title="wikilink">mystic</a> <a href="Stephen_Schwartz_(journalist)" title="wikilink">Stephen Suleyman Schwartz</a>, director of the Center for Islamic Pluralism in Washington.<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a> Supporters of the project point out that two mosques already have firm roots in <a href="Lower_Manhattan" title="wikilink">Lower Manhattan</a> and that one of them was founded in 1970, pre-dating the World Trade Center.<a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a></p>

<p>On January 14, 2011, Park51 developer Sharif el-Gamal surprised Rauf by unilaterally announcing that Rauf would no longer speak for or raise money for Park51, replacing him with Imam Abdallah Adhami. The split was attributed to a number of differences in vision for the project -- Rauf had wanted a larger interfaith center named Cordoba House, but el-Gamal had changed the name to Park51, wanted it to primarily serve Muslims, and wanted it to have a local rather than global scope. The removal of Rauf from this leadership role raised concerns that the project would be unable to raise the necessary funds to build the planned center. <a href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a> On January 29, Rauf announced that he would move the Cordoba House to a different site if one were offered to him and if the new site was &quot;on par, or even better&quot; than the current Park51 site.

Stack</a>, who criticized Rauf as a &quot;slumlord&quot;, announced court actions to have a custodial receiver take over management of these properties,<a href="#fn69" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref69"><sup>69</sup></a> and the creation of a Quality of Life Task Force to identify 15 apartment buildings in need of renovations, including Rauf's.<a href="#fn70" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a> A September 15, 2010 hearing revealed that following a September 7 inspection that determined imminent hazards, police began monitoring two of Rauf's buildings, due to inoperable fire alarms and sprinklers, and failure on Rauf's part to hire a private fire patrol. Judge Thomas Olivieri gave Rauf's lawyers until September 23 to produce plans and evidence of efforts to address these violations, lest Rauf face loss of control over the buildings. Some Union City residents questioned why the timing of these actions against Rauf's properties did not become an issue in New York City and national media, and why the long-standing problems faced by these properties were not addressed until the larger controversy over Park51 came to light, particularly given that Stack became mayor in 2000.<a href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a> On November 9, Judge Olivieri placed the Central Avenue property into temporary custodial receivership, with $7,000 in rent payments held in <a href="escrow" class="uri" title="wikilink">escrow</a> from Rauf's attorney set aside to pay for the repairs.<a href="#fn72" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref72"><sup>72</sup></a><a href="#fn73" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref73"><sup>73</sup></a></p>
<p>According to 2010 reports by the <em><a href="Bergen_Record" title="wikilink">Bergen Record</a></em>, Rauf met with U.S. Senator <a href="Robert_Menendez" title="wikilink">Robert Menendez</a> around 1991 when Menendez was Mayor of Union City, to request state funds to renovate three of his properties. As a result, Rauf received $80,000 in city funds, $384,000 from the Union City Community Development Agency, $1.3 million in construction loans from Hudson County's Affordable Housing Trust Fund, and $630,900 from the state. Rauf was also sued for fraud in 2008 by his one-time business partner, James Cockinos, over a $250,000 mortgage that Cockinos gave Rauf for his Central Avenue property, ownership of which Rauf then transferred to Sage Developments for a second $650,000 mortgage. Rauf and his wife, Daisy Khan, made payments to Cockinos for 11 years, but ceased after a fire damaged the property. The two parties settled out of court. <em>The Record</em> also reported that records beginning thirty years previous indicated that Rauf owned an apartment in North Bergen and in <a href="Palisades_Park,_New_Jersey" title="wikilink">Palisades Park</a>. Though records indicate Rauf owns a home on 78th Street in North Bergen, a neighbor indicated that Khan is there more often than the frequently traveling Rauf, and it is unclear if he still owns the Palisades Park property.<a href="#fn74" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref74"><sup>74</sup></a></p>

<p>Rauf's first wife was an American woman who converted to Islam. Rauf later married a Malaysian woman. Rauf has two children with each of his first two wives.
