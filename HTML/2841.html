<h2 id="plot">Plot</h2>
<p>A <a href="badger" class="uri" title="wikilink">badger</a> takes up residence in <a href="Santa&#39;s_Little_Helper" title="wikilink">Santa's Little Helper's</a> doghouse. After several failed attempts to lure it out (including Homer crawling into the kennel, thinking it is Milhouse but gets attacked by the badger), <a href="Homer_Simpson" title="wikilink">Homer</a> calls animal control. When he is unable to get through, <a href="Marge_Simpson" title="wikilink">Marge</a> explains that the phone company has introduced a new area code to <a href="Springfield_(The_Simpsons)" title="wikilink">Springfield</a>. Half of the town now has a 636 area code, the other has 939. At a town meeting to explain the change, Homer rallies an angry mob to protest the change, noting that the upper class side of town got to keep their area code while the poorer half were forced to switch. Homer proposes that the town split into two halves, and the mob agrees.</p>
<p>Homer is declared mayor of New Springfield and tensions immediately arise between the two towns. Olde Springfield businesses begin discriminating against customers from New Springfield, and condescending to them on the nightly news. <a href="Bart_Simpson" title="wikilink">Bart</a> and Homer shut off power to Olde Springfield and cut off their water supply in retaliation. When the lack of water reveals gold in the river bed, making the town even richer, an enraged Homer has a wall built between the two towns. However, a lack of supplies and sanitation drives away all of the New Springfield residents, who stream over the wall, leaving the Simpsons alone.</p>
<p>Bitter, Homer attempts to sabotage a concert in Olde Springfield by <a href="The_Who" title="wikilink">The Who</a>. He and Bart sneak into The Who's hotel room and convince them to play New Springfield instead. When Olde Springfield realizes that their concert has been stolen, they follow the sound of the music to the wall, where The Who are playing for an audience of The Simpsons. A riot begins to break out as the two sides of town begin hurling flaming garbage at each other. The members of The Who hear about the area code problem and suggest that the townspeople get <a href="speed_dial" title="wikilink">speed dial</a> to resolve their differences. <a href="Roger_Daltrey" title="wikilink">Roger Daltrey</a>'s scream from &quot;<a href="Won&#39;t_Get_Fooled_Again" title="wikilink">Won't Get Fooled Again</a>&quot; crumbles the wall, and the citizens of Springfield reunite and dance to the music. Meanwhile the badger leads an animal invasion of the town to &quot;get 'em while they're dancing&quot;.</p>

The episode was pitched by <a href="John_Frink" title="wikilink">John Frink</a> and <a href="Don_Payne_(writer)" title="wikilink">Don Payne</a>. The episode was inspired Don Payne's mother's neighborhood where one side would spread rumors of the other side. <a href="Larry_Doyle_(writer)" title="wikilink">Larry Doyle</a> then pitched that the sides split apart to be started by different area code.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> During production the staff did not want one side to be slobs (e.g. Homer, Barney, Moe) and the other snobs (e.g. Mr. Burns, Smithers, Skinner), but this ended happening in the final product.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> The writers later opened a website about What <a href="badgers" class="uri" title="wikilink">badgers</a> eat.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>

The animated versions of the band members included Daltrey in his trademark tight t-shirt and long curls, even though Daltrey cut the curls in the mid 1980's as they wanted to use the image The Who they are best known for. The Who recorded their lines in <a href="England" class="uri" title="wikilink">England</a>, but still weighed in on script details. During the production the staff decided to animate <a href="Keith_Moon" title="wikilink">Keith Moon</a> instead of the current drummer in honor of him since he died in 1978.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>

It takes a simple premise and turns in a good number of strong comedic bits. Hey, and a mention of &lt;U+201C&gt;golden showers&lt;U+201D&gt; keeps the Season 12 perverted sexual practices streak going!&quot; although he criticized the animation of The Who other than Daltrey, saying that &quot;That&lt;U+2019&gt;s particularly odd in the case of Pete, as he&lt;U+2019&gt;d gone awfully bald and gray by 2000.&quot;<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> Jennifer Malkowski of the DVD Verdict said the Greatest Moment was a tie between &quot;Sacred bond&quot; and &quot;Who huddle.&quot;<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> Nancy Basile of <a href="About.com" class="uri" title="wikilink">About.com</a> gave the episode a 5 writing &quot;Finally!
