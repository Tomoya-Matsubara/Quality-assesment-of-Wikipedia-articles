<p>SR 369 is maintained by the <a href="Ohio_Department_of_Transportation" title="wikilink">Ohio Department of Transportation</a> (ODOT). As a part of its duties in maintaining this highway, ODOT tracks the volume of traffic using it by a metric called the <a href="average_annual_daily_traffic" title="wikilink">average annual daily traffic</a> (AADT). This measurement determines the amount of traffic utilizing a particular stretch of the roadway on a typical day of the year. A 2008 AADT report shows that the busiest stretch of SR 369 is the portion in the vicinity of the SR 4 interchange, at the Lower Valley Pike transition, where typically 2,900 passenger vehicles and 220 commercial vehicles use the highway on a daily basis.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> The AADT along the portion of SR 369 between SR 4 and US 40 was determined to be 1,580 passenger vehicles and 120 commercial vehicles.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> SR 369 is not included within the <a href="National_Highway_System_(United_States)" title="wikilink">National Highway System</a> (NHS).
