The <em>retiarius</em> fought lightly armoured, wearing an arm guard (<em><a href="lorica_manica" title="wikilink">manica</a></em>) and a shoulder guard (<em>galerus</em> or <em>spongia</em>). Typically, his clothing consisted only of a loincloth (<em>subligaculum</em>) held in place by a wide belt (<em>balteus</em>), or of a short <a href="tunic" class="uri" title="wikilink">tunic</a> with light padding. He wore no head protection or footwear.</p>
<p>The <em>retiarius</em> was routinely pitted against a heavily armed and armoured <em><a href="secutor" class="uri" title="wikilink">secutor</a></em>. The net-fighter made up for his lack of protective gear by using his speed and agility to avoid his opponent's attacks and wait for the opportunity to strike. He first tried to throw his net over his rival. If this succeeded, he attacked with his trident while his adversary was entangled. Another tactic was to ensnare his enemy's weapon in the net and pull it out of his grasp, leaving the opponent defenceless. Should the net miss or the <em>secutor</em> grab hold of it, the <em>retiarius</em> likely discarded the weapon, although he might try to collect it back for a second cast. Usually, the <em>retiarius</em> had to rely on his trident and dagger to finish the fight. The trident, as tall as a human being, permitted the gladiator to jab quickly and keep his distance. It was a strong weapon, capable of inflicting piercing wounds on an unprotected skull or limb. The dagger was the <em>retiarius</em>'s final backup should the trident be lost. It was reserved for when close combat or a straight wrestling match had to settle the bout. In some battles, a single <em>retiarius</em> faced two <em>secutores</em> simultaneously. For these situations, the lightly armoured gladiator was placed on a raised platform and given a supply of stones with which to repel his pursuers.</p>
<p><em>Retiarii</em> first appeared in the arena during the 1st century <a href="CE" class="uri" title="wikilink">CE</a> and had become standard attractions by the 2nd or 3rd century. The gladiator's lack of armour and his reliance on evasive tactics made the <em>retiarius</em> the lowliest (and most effeminate) of an already stigmatised class. Passages from the works of <a href="Juvenal" class="uri" title="wikilink">Juvenal</a>, <a href="Seneca_the_Younger" title="wikilink">Seneca</a>, and <a href="Suetonius" class="uri" title="wikilink">Suetonius</a> suggest that those <em>retiarii</em> who fought in tunics may have constituted an even more demeaned subtype (<em>retiarii tunicati</em>) who were viewed not as legitimate fighters but as arena clowns. Nevertheless, Roman artwork, graffiti, and grave markers include examples of specific net-men who apparently had reputations as skilled combatants and lovers.</p>

However, because of the stark differences in arms and armour between the two types, the pairing pushed such practices to new extremes. Roman art and literature make no mention of <em>retiarii</em> until the early Imperial period; for example, the type is absent from the copious gladiator-themed reliefs dating to the 1st century <a href="CE" class="uri" title="wikilink">CE</a> found at <a href="Chieti" class="uri" title="wikilink">Chieti</a> and <a href="Pompeii" class="uri" title="wikilink">Pompeii</a>.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> Nevertheless, graffiti and artifacts from Pompeii attest to the class's existence by this time.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> Fights between <em>retiarii</em> and <em>secutores</em> likely became popular as early as the middle of the 1st century CE, and the net-fighter became one of the standard gladiator categories by the 2nd or 3rd century AD and remained a staple attraction until the end of the gladiatorial games.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> In addition to the <a href="conflict_(narrative)" title="wikilink">man-versus-nature</a> symbolism inherent in such bouts,<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> the <em>retiarius</em> was water to the <em>secutor</em>'s fire, one constantly moving and escaping, the other determinedly inescapable.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> The lightly armoured <em>retiarius</em> was the effeminate man to the <em>secutor</em>'s heavily armoured man.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> Another gladiator type, the <em><a href="laquearius" class="uri" title="wikilink">laquearius</a></em> (&quot;noose-man&quot;) was similar to the <em>retiarius</em> but fought with a <a href="lasso" class="uri" title="wikilink">lasso</a> in place of a net.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>

<p>There is evidence that those net-men wearing tunics, known as <em>retiarii tunicati</em>, formed a special sub-class, one even more demeaned than their loincloth-wearing colleagues.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> The Roman satirist <a href="Juvenal" class="uri" title="wikilink">Juvenal</a> wrote that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So even the lanista's establishment is better ordered than yours, for he separates the vile from the decent, and sequesters even from their fellow-<em>retiarii</em> the wearers of the ill-famed tunic; in the training-school, and even in gaol, such creatures herd apart&lt;U+2026&gt;.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a></p>

<p>The passage suggests that tunic-wearing <em>retiarii</em> were trained for a different role, &quot;in servitude, under strict discipline and even possibly under some restraints&quot;.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> Certain effeminate men mentioned by <a href="Seneca_the_Younger" title="wikilink">Seneca the Younger</a> in his <em><a href="Quaestiones_naturales" title="wikilink">Quaestiones naturales</a></em> were trained as gladiators and may correspond to Juvenal's tunic-wearing <em>retiarii</em>.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> <a href="Suetonius" class="uri" title="wikilink">Suetonius</a> reports this anecdote: &quot;Once a band of five <em>retiarii</em> in tunics, matched against the same number of <em>secutores</em>, yielded without a struggle; but when their death was ordered, one of them caught up his trident and slew all the victors.&quot; The reaction of Emperor <a href="Caligula" class="uri" title="wikilink">Caligula</a> showed the disgust with which he viewed the gladiators' actions: &quot;Caligula bewailed this in a public proclamation as a most cruel murder, and expressed his horror of those who had had the heart to witness it.&quot;<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a><a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> The fate of the <em>retiarii</em> is not revealed.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> This was not likely a standard competition, as real gladiators did not surrender so easily.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> Rather, such tunic-wearing net-men may have served as comic relief in the gladiatorial programming.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a></p>
<p>Juvenal's second satire, wherein he deplores the immorality he perceived in Roman society, introduces a member of the <a href="Gracchi" title="wikilink">Gracchus family</a> who is described as a homosexual married (in female persona) to a horn player.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> Gracchus later appears in the arena:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Greater still the portent when Gracchus, clad in a tunic, played the gladiator, and fled, trident in hand, across the arena&lt;U+2014&gt;Gracchus, a man of nobler birth than the Capitolini, or the Marcelli, or the descendants of Catulus or Paulus, or the Fabii: nobler than all the spectators in the podium; not excepting him who gave the show at which that net was flung.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Gracchus appears once again in Juvenal's eighth satire as the worst example of the noble Romans who have disgraced themselves by appearing in public spectacles and popular entertainments:<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>To crown all this [scandal], what is left but the amphitheatre? And this disgrace of the city you have as well&lt;U+2014&gt;Gracchus not fighting as equipped as a Mirmillo, with buckler or falchion (for he condemns&lt;U+2014&gt;yes, condemns and hates such equipment). Nor does he conceal his face beneath a helmet. See! he wields a trident. When he has cast without effect the nets suspended from his poised right hand, he boldly lifts his uncovered face to the spectators, and, easily to be recognized, flees across the whole arena. We can not mistake the tunic, since the ribbon of gold reaches from his neck, and flutters in the breeze from his high-peaked cap. Therefore, the disgrace, which the Secutor had to submit to, in being forced to fight with Gracchus, was worse than any wound.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a></p>

When the tide turns against him, he dons a tunic and a womanish wig (<em>spira</em>),<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> apparently part of the same costume, and thus enjoys a reprieve. The change of clothing seems to turn a serious fight into a comical one and shames his opponent. It is unusual to see a gladiator depicted this way in a satire, as such fighters usually take the role of men who are &quot;brawny, brutal, sexually successful with women of both high and low degree, but especially the latter, ill-educated if not uneducated, and none too bright intellectually&quot;.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> The <em>retiarius tunicatus</em> in the satire is the opposite: &quot;a mock gladiatorial figure, of equivocal sex, regularly dressed in costume of some sort, possibly usually as a woman, and matched against a <em>secutor</em> or <em>murmillo</em> in a mock gladiatorial exhibition&quot;.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a></p>

His trident lies at the foot of his secutor adversary, and his net is missing." /> The <em>retiarius</em> is the most readily identifiable gladiator type, due to his signature equipment: arm guard (<em><a href="lorica_manica" title="wikilink">manica</a></em>), shoulder guard (<em>galerus</em>), <a href="net_(device)" title="wikilink">net</a> (<em>rete</em>), <a href="trident" class="uri" title="wikilink">trident</a> (<em>fuscina</em> or <em>tridens</em>), and <a href="dagger" class="uri" title="wikilink">dagger</a> (<em><a href="pugio" class="uri" title="wikilink">pugio</a></em>).<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> (Technically, the <em>retiarius</em> was not a &quot;gladiator&quot; at all, since he did not fight with the sword&lt;U+2014&gt;<em><a href="gladius" class="uri" title="wikilink">gladius</a></em>&lt;U+2014&gt;after which such fighters took their name).<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a> His weapons and armour could be decorated.

<p>Although the net (<em>rete</em>) was this gladiator's signature weapon, few depictions of the device survive.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a> Combat with throwing nets may have occurred on ancient battlefields,<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a> but modern experiments and comparisons with modern fishing nets offer the only clues as to how the gladiatorial net was constructed. Such data indicate that the <em>rete</em> was circular, with a wide mesh about 3 metres (9.5 ft) in diameter and lead weights along the edges.<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a> A rope ran around the perimeter of the mesh, with the ends tied to the gladiator's wrist.<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a> Because it was thrown, the net was sometimes called an <em>iaculum</em>.<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a></p>
<p>The <em>retiarius</em> complemented his net with an iron or bronze trident (<em>fuscina</em>, <em>fascina</em> or, rarely, <em>tridens</em>)<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a> that stood about as high as a human being.<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a> A skull found in a gladiator graveyard in <a href="Ephesus" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ephesus</a>, Turkey, shows puncture holes consistent with a trident strike.

<p>The <em>retiarius</em> wore minimal armour; unlike other gladiator types, he wore no helmet, greaves, or shield. He wore a <em><a href="Lorica_manica" title="wikilink">manica</a></em> on his left arm, where other gladiators wore it on the right;<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a> this allowed him to more fluidly make a right-handed cast of his net.<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a> Attached to the top of this was a long bronze or leather guard over the upper left arm and shoulder, known as a <em>galerus</em> or <em>spongia</em>.<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a><a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a> This guard extended 12 to 13 centimetres (4.7 to 5.1 in) beyond the shoulder blade and flared outward, allowing free movement of the gladiator's head.

Coupled with the heavy weight of his arms and armour&lt;U+2014&gt;the gear of a <em>murmillo</em>, of which the <em>secutor</em> was a variant, weighed 15 to 18 kilograms (33.1 to 39.7 lb)<a href="#fn85" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref85"><sup>85</sup></a>&lt;U+2014&gt;this gladiator was in greater danger of exhausting himself in a long fight.<a href="#fn86" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref86"><sup>86</sup></a> One of the <em>retiarius</em>'s tactics was to jab at the <em>secutor</em>'s shield (the heaviest bit of his equipment), forcing him to block and wear himself out.<a href="#fn87" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref87"><sup>87</sup></a><a href="#fn88" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref88"><sup>88</sup></a></p>
<p>In skilled hands, the net was a useful weapon. The <em>retiarius</em>'s primary objective with it was to capture his opponent.<a href="#fn89" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref89"><sup>89</sup></a> A ewer found at <a href="Rheinzabern" class="uri" title="wikilink">Rheinzabern</a> demonstrates the throwing technique: the <em>retiarius</em> held the net folded up in his right hand and cast it underhanded. He held his trident and dagger in his left hand, careful to keep the trident's prongs pointed downward to avoid snagging it in the mesh.<a href="#fn90" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref90"><sup>90</sup></a> If the toss missed, the <em>retiarius</em> used the drawrope tied to his wrist to bring the net back in hand.<a href="#fn91" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref91"><sup>91</sup></a><a href="#fn92" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref92"><sup>92</sup></a> On a successful cast, the gladiator tightened the drawcord around the net's perimeter and tried to unbalance or topple his rival.<a href="#fn93" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref93"><sup>93</sup></a> A successful cast of the net could win the battle for the <em>retiarius</em> straightaway.<a href="#fn94" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref94"><sup>94</sup></a> This was not certain, however, as a mosaic at the <a href="National_Archaeological_Museum_of_Spain" title="wikilink">National Archaeological Museum</a> in Madrid shows: in the first panel, the <em>retiarius</em> Kalendio has caught his opponent, a <em>secutor</em> named Astyanax, in his net. In the later image, however, Kalendio lies on the ground, wounded, and raises his dagger to surrender. The inscription above Kalendio shows the sign for &quot;null&quot;, implying that the match organisers ordered him killed.<a href="#fn95" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref95"><sup>95</sup></a></p>
<p>The net could ensnare the <em>secutor</em>'s weapon to disarm him<a href="#fn96" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref96"><sup>96</sup></a> and snag away his shield to put him at a significant disadvantage.<a href="#fn97" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref97"><sup>97</sup></a> Other <em>retiarius</em> tricks were to whip the net at his opponent's eyes to blind him and at his legs to trip him.<a href="#fn98" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref98"><sup>98</sup></a><a href="#fn99" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref99"><sup>99</sup></a> The helmet of the <em>secutor</em> was smooth and round to avoid snagging the net.<a href="#fn100" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref100"><sup>100</sup></a> In most cases, the <em>secutor</em> knew to expect the net-man's tactics and tried to intercept and hold on to the weapon,<a href="#fn101" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref101"><sup>101</sup></a> possibly unsteadying his enemy by yanking on the net. In such danger, the <em>retiarius</em> could sever the drawstring from his wrist with his dagger.<a href="#fn102" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref102"><sup>102</sup></a> The <em>secutor</em> stood by a lost net and left little chance to recover it.<a href="#fn103" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref103"><sup>103</sup></a><a href="#fn104" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref104"><sup>104</sup></a> Speculation surrounds the frequency with which the <em>retiarius</em> used his net. Extant imagery rarely shows gladiators of the type with a net, yet the class is named for the device, and Juvenal uses the net to quickly identify a <em>retiarius</em> in his satires. The discrepancy may simply be a case of <a href="artistic_licence" title="wikilink">artistic licence</a>; other types of gladiator are often shown without their weapons but can be assumed to be holding them due to their stance, and a net is a particularly difficult weapon to depict. The lack of nets in <em>retiarius</em> images may show gladiators who have already lost the weapon in the fight. Another possibility is that some <em>retiarii</em> simply did not use nets.<a href="#fn105" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref105"><sup>105</sup></a></p>
<p><img src="Retiarius_Scissor_show_fight_02.jpg" title="fig:In this mock gladiatorial fight at Carnuntum, Austria, the secutor (left) is wearing a conical arm guard used to snag away the net of the retiarius (right)." alt="In this mock gladiatorial fight at Carnuntum, Austria, the secutor (left) is wearing a conical arm guard used to snag away the net of the retiarius (right)." /> In most bouts, the <em>retiarius</em> probably had to resort to fighting with just his trident and dagger,<a href="#fn106" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref106"><sup>106</sup></a> placing him at a disadvantage.<a href="#fn107" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref107"><sup>107</sup></a> The trident was his primary weapon in such situations,<a href="#fn108" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref108"><sup>108</sup></a> and its length allowed the <em>retiarius</em> to keep his opponent at bay.<a href="#fn109" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref109"><sup>109</sup></a> He held the weapon two-handed, left nearer the prongs, so that he could parry his enemy's strikes with its shaft and strike with both ends. Wielded two-handed, the weapon could land powerful blows.<a href="#fn110" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref110"><sup>110</sup></a><a href="#fn111" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref111"><sup>111</sup></a> Images show <em>retiarii</em> stabbing downward at the <em>secutor</em>'s unshielded legs or stabbing down at the helmet in an attempt to poke through an eyehole. The trident itself was too weak to pierce the metal,<a href="#fn112" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref112"><sup>112</sup></a> although a skull found at Ephesus, Turkey, dating to AD 200 to 300 shows that a trident strike to the head could be fatal on a bareheaded opponent.<a href="#fn113" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref113"><sup>113</sup></a> The <em>secutor</em>'s helmet was rounded and free of protrusions to avoid snaring the net or being caught in the trident's prongs, but attacks on it forced the <em>secutor</em> to duck or hide behind his shield. This reduced his field of vision and gave the <em>retiarius</em> an advantage with his speed.<a href="#fn114" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref114"><sup>114</sup></a> Should the <em>secutor</em> strike with his sword, the <em>retiarius</em> parried with the trident prongs and attempted to disarm him.<a href="#fn115" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref115"><sup>115</sup></a> Likewise, the more heavily armoured gladiator tried to block the trident with his shield and force the net-man to lose it.<a href="#fn116" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref116"><sup>116</sup></a> Images from the Eastern Roman Empire show <em>secutores</em> wearing a tubular arm-guard in lieu of a shield. The guard fits over the left hand and ends in a hooked, knife-like blade that was probably intended to parry the net and trident or to snag and pull away the net. <em>Secutores</em> who succeeded in this probably dropped the hook weapon and fought with just a sword.<a href="#fn117" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref117"><sup>117</sup></a><a href="#fn118" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref118"><sup>118</sup></a></p>
<p>The <em>retiarius</em> held the dagger in his left hand.<a href="#fn119" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref119"><sup>119</sup></a> The gladiator could use the dagger to cut his net free if it got snagged on his trident.<a href="#fn120" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref120"><sup>120</sup></a> He might fight with the trident in one hand and the dagger in the other, but this negated the advantage of distance afforded by the longer weapon when wielded by itself.<a href="#fn121" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref121"><sup>121</sup></a> The dagger also served as a backup should the <em>retiarius</em> lose both net and trident.<a href="#fn122" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref122"><sup>122</sup></a> He attacked with the dagger when he had the element of surprise and could attempt to wrestle the <em>secutor</em> to the ground.<a href="#fn123" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref123"><sup>123</sup></a> Fights could devolve into straight wrestling matches in such situations, perhaps with daggers.<a href="#fn124" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref124"><sup>124</sup></a> Should the <em>retiarius</em> win and be ordered to kill his rival, he used his knife to stab him or cut his throat.<a href="#fn125" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref125"><sup>125</sup></a> Evidence shows that <em>retiarii</em> could be quite successful combatants; a tombstone from Gaul reads, &quot;[For] the <em>retiarius</em>, L. Pompeius, winner of nine crowns, born in Vienna, twenty-five years of age. His wife put this up with her own money for her wonderful spouse.&quot;<a href="#fn126" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref126"><sup>126</sup></a> Nevertheless, the gladiators themselves were prone to boast: A graffito at Pompeii shows the <em>retiarius</em> Antigonus, who claims a ridiculous 2,112 victories, facing a challenger called Superbus, who has won but a single fight.<a href="#fn127" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref127"><sup>127</sup></a></p>
<p>In some contests, a <em>retiarius</em> faced two <em>secutores</em> at the same time. He stood on a bridge or raised platform with stairs and had a pile of fist-sized stones to lob at his adversaries and keep them at bay. The <em>secutores</em> tried to scale the structure and get at him. The platform (called a <em>pons</em>, &quot;bridge&quot;) may have been constructed over water.<a href="#fn128" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref128"><sup>128</sup></a> Such scenarios were one of the rare situations where gladiators were not paired one on one.<a href="#fn129" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref129"><sup>129</sup></a></p>
