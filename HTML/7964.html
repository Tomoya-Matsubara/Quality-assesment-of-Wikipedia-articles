<p>The <strong>EMC AB6</strong> was a type of <a href="diesel_locomotive" title="wikilink">diesel locomotive</a> built exclusively for the <a href="Chicago,_Rock_Island_and_Pacific_Railroad" title="wikilink">Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad</a> (the &quot;Rock Island Line&quot;) by <a href="General_Motors_Corporation" title="wikilink">General Motors</a>' <a href="Electro-Motive_Diesel" title="wikilink">Electro-Motive Corporation</a> and delivered in June 1940. Two examples were built, numbered #750 and #751. They were built for the <em><a href="Rocky_Mountain_Rocket" title="wikilink">Rocky Mountain Rocket</a></em> <a href="passenger_train" title="wikilink">passenger train</a>, which travelled as a unified train from <a href="Chicago,_Illinois" title="wikilink">Chicago, Illinois</a>, to <a href="Limon,_Colorado" title="wikilink">Limon, Colorado</a>, but then divided; with one segment going to <a href="Colorado_Springs,_Colorado" title="wikilink">Colorado Springs, Colorado</a>, and the other to <a href="Denver,_Colorado" title="wikilink">Denver, Colorado</a>. The Rock Island desired a locomotive that could look like an integrated part of the train during the Chicago-Limon portion of the route, but could then be operated independently to take three cars to Colorado Springs. A regular, cab-equipped A-unit could have been purchased, but that would have ruined the streamlined look of the train, so the RI had EMC build a flat-fronted locomotive based on an <a href="EMD_E-unit" title="wikilink">E-series</a> <a href="EMC_E6" title="wikilink">E6B</a> (<a href="B_unit" title="wikilink">B unit</a>) but with an operating cab, headlight, <a href="pilot_(locomotive)" title="wikilink">pilot</a>, and other features to enable it to operate as an independent locomotive.</p>
<p>Since the small three- and four-car trains the units would have to haul independently were very light, the AB6 pair were built with only one 1,000 hp EMC 567 <a href="V12_engine" title="wikilink">V12 engine</a>, and a baggage compartment where the second engine would have been. Later, with increasing trainloads, the baggage compartment was replaced with a second engine.</p>
<p>In 1965, the units had their <a href="Steam_generator_(railroad)" title="wikilink">steam generators</a> replaced with <a href="head-end_power" title="wikilink">head-end power</a> and were reassigned to <a href="Push-pull_train" title="wikilink">push-pull</a> suburban service in the Chicago area. In this form, they lasted until the mid-1970s.</p>
