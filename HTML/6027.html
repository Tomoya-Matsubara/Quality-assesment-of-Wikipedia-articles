<h2 id="band-history">Band History</h2>
<p>Double Dragon were formed in late 2004 when Screwface 13 guitarist Matthew 'Roady' Johnston left the band to create a new project that focused more on melody than the down-tuned stylings of 90's <a href="nu_metal" title="wikilink">nu metal</a>.

<p>After touring nationally around the country and selling out their first CD launch, the band was set too continue writing and recording, when in 2005 singer Lee Gardiner was seriously injured in a domestic house fire, suffering third degree burns to both thighs and hands. During his rehabilitation period, Double Dragon had begun writing heavier, more aggressive songs, some of which are based around Lee's injuries and the impact it had on the band as a whole. Double Dragon were then signed by Adelaide based record label Truth Inc Records and went on to record their national debut, Scars Of Fire, produced by Ian Miller, in which it received critical acclaim throughout <a href="Australia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Australia</a>.</p>
