<p><strong>Green Day</strong> is an <a href="United_States" title="wikilink">American</a> <a href="Rock_music" title="wikilink">rock</a> band consisting of three core members: <a href="Billie_Joe_Armstrong" title="wikilink">Billie Joe Armstrong</a> (guitar, lead vocals), <a href="Mike_Dirnt" title="wikilink">Mike Dirnt</a> (bass) and <a href="Tr&lt;U+00E9&gt;_Cool" title="wikilink">Tr&lt;U+00E9&gt; Cool</a> (drums).

<p>Green Day was originally part of the <a href="punk_rock" title="wikilink">punk rock</a> scene at <a href="924_Gilman_Street" title="wikilink">924 Gilman Street</a> in <a href="Berkeley,_California" title="wikilink">Berkeley, California</a>. Their early releases for <a href="independent_label" title="wikilink">independent label</a> <a href="Lookout!_Records" title="wikilink">Lookout! Records</a> earned them a grassroots fanbase, some of whom felt alienated when the band signed to a major label. Nevertheless, their major label debut <em><a href="Dookie" class="uri" title="wikilink">Dookie</a></em> became a breakout success in 1994 and eventually sold 20 million copies worldwide. As a result, Green Day was widely credited, along with fellow <a href="California_punk" title="wikilink">California punk</a> bands <a href="The_Offspring" title="wikilink">The Offspring</a> and <a href="Rancid_(band)" title="wikilink">Rancid</a>, with reviving mainstream interest in and popularizing punk rock in the United States.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a><a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> Green Day's immediate follow-up albums didn't achieve the massive success of <em>Dookie</em>, but they were still successful.

<p>In 1986, childhood friends <a href="Billie_Joe_Armstrong" title="wikilink">Billie Joe Armstrong</a> and <a href="Mike_Dirnt" title="wikilink">Mike Dirnt</a> (both 14 years old) formed the two person band Sweet Children. The first Sweet Children show took place on <a href="October_17" title="wikilink">October 17</a>, <a href="1989" class="uri" title="wikilink">1989</a>, at Rod's Hickory Pit in <a href="Vallejo,_California" title="wikilink">Vallejo, California</a> where Armstrong's mother was working. In late 1989, Armstrong, Dirnt and John Kiffmeyer (aka <a href="Al_Sobrante" title="wikilink">Al Sobrante</a>) formed Green Day, taking the name as a reference to smoking <a href="marijuana" class="uri" title="wikilink">marijuana</a> all day. Green Day performed their first show in the courtyard of <a href="Contra_Costa_College" title="wikilink">Contra Costa College</a>, a junior college in <a href="San_Pablo,_California" title="wikilink">San Pablo, California</a> that Sobrante attended.</p>
<p><a href="Larry_Livermore" title="wikilink">Larry Livermore</a>, who played guitar for <a href="The_Lookouts" title="wikilink">The Lookouts</a> and ran the <a href="Berkeley,_California" title="wikilink">Berkeley, California</a> <a href="Independent_record_label" title="wikilink">independent label</a> <a href="Lookout!_Records" title="wikilink">Lookout! Records</a>, offered the band a record deal after hearing them play. The band, he said, played the show like &quot;<a href="The_Beatles" title="wikilink">The Beatles</a> at <a href="Shea_Stadium" title="wikilink">Shea Stadium</a>&quot;<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a><a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> In late <a href="1989" class="uri" title="wikilink">1989</a> they released their first <a href="Extended_play" title="wikilink">EP</a>, <em><a href="1,000_Hours" title="wikilink">1,000 Hours</a></em>, and quickly followed it up with their first <a href="Album" title="wikilink">LP</a>, <em><a href="39/Smooth" class="uri" title="wikilink">39/Smooth</a></em> in early <a href="1990" class="uri" title="wikilink">1990</a>. <img src="Lookoutgd.jpg" title="fig:Early Green Day, before Tr&lt;U+00E9&gt; Cool became a member of the band." alt="Early Green Day, before Tr&lt;U+00E9&gt; Cool became a member of the band." width="200" /> Green Day printed a fictional letter purporting to be from <a href="I.R.S._Records" title="wikilink">I.R.S. Records</a> that claimed the label had made an attempt to sign them. In a mock reply to the fictional letter, the band made it clear that they were loyal to Lookout! Records, saying that I.R.S. was a cheesy and washed-up label.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> They recorded two more EPs later that year: <em><a href="Slappy" class="uri" title="wikilink">Slappy</a></em> and <em><a href="Sweet_Children_(EP)" title="wikilink">Sweet Children</a></em>, the latter of which included some older songs for the <a href="Minneapolis,_Minnesota" title="wikilink">Minneapolis, Minnesota</a> indie label Skene! Records. In 1991, Lookout! Records released <em><a href="1,039/Smoothed_Out_Slappy_Hours" title="wikilink">1,039/Smoothed Out Slappy Hours</a></em>, a compilation of the <em><a href="39/Smooth" class="uri" title="wikilink">39/Smooth</a></em>, <em><a href="Slappy" class="uri" title="wikilink">Slappy</a></em>, and <em><a href="1,000_Hours" title="wikilink">1,000 Hours</a></em> EPs. In late 1990, shortly after the band's first nationwide tour, Sobrante moved to <a href="Arcata,_California" title="wikilink">Arcata, California</a> to attend college. Lookouts drummer <a href="Tr&lt;U+00E9&gt;_Cool" title="wikilink">Tr&lt;U+00E9&gt; Cool</a> began filling in as a temporary replacement, and when it became clear that Sobrante did not plan on committing to the band full time, Tr&lt;U+00E9&gt; Cool's position as Green Day's drummer became permanent.</p>
<p>In January 1991, Green Day wrote and recorded their second album, and first to feature Tr&lt;U+00E9&gt; Cool on drums, <em><a href="Kerplunk!" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kerplunk!</a></em>, it was released on Lookout! Records in 1992. The album included the track &quot;<a href="Welcome_to_Paradise" title="wikilink">Welcome to Paradise</a>&quot;, which was re-recorded for Green Day's major-label debut, <em><a href="Dookie" class="uri" title="wikilink">Dookie</a></em>. The first track off of <em>Kerplunk</em>, &quot;<a href="2000_Light_Years_Away" title="wikilink">2000 Light Years Away</a>&quot;, was also remixed with <a href="Reprise_Records" title="wikilink">Reprise Records</a> and was released on the <em><a href="Jerky_Boys" title="wikilink">Jerky Boys</a></em> movie soundtrack. The band went on tour for most of 1992 and 1993, and played a stretch of shows overseas in <a href="Europe" class="uri" title="wikilink">Europe</a>. They headlined a gig at the Hollywood Palamino club in <a href="1992" class="uri" title="wikilink">1992</a> with <a href="Jughead&#39;s_Revenge" title="wikilink">Jughead's Revenge</a> and <a href="Strung_Out" title="wikilink">Strung Out</a>, a show that would become legendary among the band's following. <em>Kerplunk</em> sold about 50,000 copies in the U.S.,<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> which was considered quite a large amount for the independent punk scene in 1992. It eventually sold over 2 million albums worldwide.</p>
<h3 id="mainstream-success-19941996">Mainstream success (1994–1996)</h3>






<p><em>Kerplunk!'s</em> underground success led to a wave of interest coming from major record labels, and eventually they left Lookout! on friendly terms and signed with <a href="Reprise_Records" title="wikilink">Reprise Records</a> after attracting the attention of producer <a href="Rob_Cavallo" title="wikilink">Rob Cavallo</a>. Signing to Reprise caused many punk rock fans to regard Green Day as <a href="Selling_out" title="wikilink">sellouts</a>.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> Reflecting on the period, Armstrong told <em><a href="Spin_magazine" title="wikilink">SPIN</a></em> magazine in 1999, &quot;I couldn't go back to the punk scene, whether we were the biggest success in the world or the biggest failure ... The only thing I could do was get on my bike and go forward.&quot;<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> They then went to work on recording their major label debut, <em>Dookie</em>.</p>
<p>Released in February of 1994, and recorded in a mere 3 weeks, <em>Dookie</em> became a commercial sensation, helped by extensive <a href="MTV" class="uri" title="wikilink">MTV</a> airplay for the videos &quot;<a href="Longview_(song)" title="wikilink">Longview</a>&quot;, &quot;<a href="Basket_Case_(song)" title="wikilink">Basket Case</a>&quot;, and &quot;<a href="When_I_Come_Around" title="wikilink">When I Come Around</a>&quot;, all of which sat in the #1 position on the <a href="Modern_Rock_Tracks" title="wikilink">Modern Rock Tracks</a> charts. That year, Green Day embarked on a nationwide tour with <a href="queercore" class="uri" title="wikilink">queercore</a> band <a href="Pansy_Division" title="wikilink">Pansy Division</a> as their opening act. The band also joined the lineups of both the <a href="Lollapalooza" class="uri" title="wikilink">Lollapalooza</a> festival and <a href="Woodstock_1994" title="wikilink">Woodstock 1994</a>, where they started an infamous mud fight. During the concert, a security guard mistook bassist <a href="Mike_Dirnt" title="wikilink">Mike Dirnt</a> for a stage-invading fan and punched out some of his teeth. Viewed by millions via <a href="pay-per-view" class="uri" title="wikilink">pay-per-view</a> television, the Woodstock 1994 performance further aided Green Day's growing publicity and recognition,<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> and helped push their album to eventual <a href="RIAA_certification" title="wikilink">diamond status</a>. In 1995, <em>Dookie</em> won the <a href="Grammy_Award" title="wikilink">Grammy Award</a> for <a href="Best_Alternative_Music_Album" title="wikilink">Best Alternative Album</a> and the band was nominated for 9 MTV Video Music Awards including Video of the Year.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> <img src="Gtmtsya.jpg" title="fig:The full fold-out artwork to Insomniac, entitled God told Me To Skin You Alive." alt="The full fold-out artwork to Insomniac, entitled God told Me To Skin You Alive." width="400" /> In 1995, a new single for the <em><a href="Angus_(film)" title="wikilink">Angus</a></em> soundtrack was released, titled &quot;<a href="J.A.R." class="uri" title="wikilink">J.A.R.</a>&quot;. The single went straight to #1 on the Billboard <a href="Modern_Rock_Tracks" title="wikilink">Modern Rock Tracks</a> chart. The song was followed by their new album, <em><a href="Insomniac_(album)" title="wikilink">Insomniac</a></em>, which was released in the fall of 1995. <em>Insomniac</em> was a much darker response by the band, compared to the poppy, more melodic <em>Dookie</em>.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> <em>Insomniac</em> opened to a warm critical reception, earning 4 out of 5 stars from <a href="Rolling_Stone_Magazine" title="wikilink">Rolling Stone Magazine</a>, raving &quot;In punk, the good stuff actually unfolds and gains meaning as you listen without sacrificing any of its electric, haywire immediacy. And Green Day are as good as this stuff gets.&quot;<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a><em>Insomniac</em> used a piece of art by <a href="Winston_Smith_(artist)" title="wikilink">Winston Smith</a> entitled <a href="God_told_Me_To_Skin_You_Alive" title="wikilink">God told Me To Skin You Alive</a> for its album cover. Smith said to drummer Tr&lt;U+00E9&gt; Cool that if he ever needed album artwork, that he should call him. Singles released from <em>Insomniac</em> were &quot;<a href="Geek_Stink_Breath" title="wikilink">Geek Stink Breath</a>&quot;, the radio-favorite double single &quot;<a href="Brain_Stew/Jaded" title="wikilink">Brain Stew/Jaded</a>&quot;, &quot;<a href="Walking_Contradiction" title="wikilink">Walking Contradiction</a>&quot;, and &quot;<a href="Stuck_With_Me" title="wikilink">Stuck With Me</a>&quot;. One track, &quot;86,&quot; was a reference to the Gilman Street club refusing them entry after the release of <em>Dookie</em>, claiming that they had &quot;gone too commercial.&quot; Though the album didn't approach the success of <em>Dookie</em>, it still sold seven million copies<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> in the United States. <em>Insomniac</em> won the band award nominations for Favorite Artist, Favorite Hard Rock Artist, and Favorite Alternative Artist at the 1996 <a href="American_Music_Awards" title="wikilink">American Music Awards</a>, and the video for &quot;Walking Contradiction&quot; got the band a Grammy nomination for Best Video, Short Form, in addition to a Best Special Effects nomination at the MTV Video Music Awards.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> After that, the band abruptly cancelled a European tour, claiming exhaustion.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="nimrod.-and-warning-19972003"><em>Nimrod.</em> and <em>Warning</em> (1997–2003)</h3>








<p>After taking a break in 1996, Green Day began work on a new album in 1997. From the outset, both the band and Cavallo agreeed that the album had to be different from their previous records.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> The result was <em><a href="Nimrod_(album)" title="wikilink">nimrod.</a></em>, an experimental deviation from the band's standard pop-punk brand of music. The new album was released in October 1997. It provided a variety of music, with everything from upbeat pop-punk, laid-back surfer rock, and peppy, silly ska, to an acoustic ballad. <em>nimrod.</em> entered the charts at number 10, thanks to the surprise hit &quot;<a href="Good_Riddance_(Time_of_Your_Life)" title="wikilink">Good Riddance (Time of Your Life)</a>&quot;, an acoustic ballad that singer Billie Joe almost did not place on the album for fear of it being &quot;too girly.&quot; The success of &quot;Good Riddance (Time of Your Life)&quot; won the band an MTV Video Award for Best Alternative Video for the song's video, which depicted people undergoing major changes in their lives while Billie Joe Armstrong strummed his acoustic guitar.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> Other singles released from <em>nimrod.</em> were <a href="Nice_Guys_Finish_Last" title="wikilink">Nice Guys Finish Last</a>, <a href="Hitchin&#39;_a_Ride" title="wikilink">Hitchin' a Ride</a> and <a href="Redundant_(single)" title="wikilink">Redundant</a>. <em>Nimrod.</em> also featured one of the band's live staples, &quot;<a href="King_for_a_Day" title="wikilink">King for a Day</a>&quot;, which, when played live, is accompanied by Billie Joe wearing a crown and/or cape. After the release of <em>nimrod.</em>, Green Day took a two-year break, deciding to step back from the spotlight and spend some time with their new families.</p>
<p>In 2000, Green Day released <em><a href="Warning:" class="uri" title="wikilink">Warning:</a></em>, a step further in the style that they had hinted at with <em>nimrod</em>. Changes in their personal lives were reflected in the more mature and straightforward approach they took to their music, replacing nearly adolescent mantras of masturbation with more introspective statements. Critics' reviews of the album were fairly positive, although the album was greeted with mixed reviews within their fan base, who had grown accustomed to their 1990s pop punk sound. Though it produced the hit &quot;<a href="Minority_(song)" title="wikilink">Minority</a>&quot; and a smaller hit with &quot;<a href="Warning_(Green_Day_song)" title="wikilink">Warning</a>&quot;, some observers were coming to the conclusion that the band was losing relevance, and a decline in popularity followed. While all of Green Day's past albums had reached a status of at least double platinum, <em>Warning:</em> was only certified gold. Although the band felt this was some of their strongest work to date, the decline of sales fueled questions regarding the band's future.</p>
<p>At the 2001 California Music Awards, Green Day won all eight awards that they were nominated for. They won the awards for Outstanding Album (<em>Warning:</em>), Outstanding Punk Rock/Ska Album (<em>Warning:</em>), Outstanding Group, Outstanding Male Vocalist, Outstanding Bassist, Outstanding Drummer, Outstanding Songwriter and Outstanding Artist.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a></p>
<p>The release of a Greatest Hits compilation, <em><a href="International_Superhits!" title="wikilink">International Superhits!</a></em>, and the token complementary assemblage of B-sides, <em><a href="Shenanigans" class="uri" title="wikilink">Shenanigans</a></em>, only fueled the theory that Green Day's career was on the rocks. <em>International Superhits</em> and its companion collection of music videos, titled <em><a href="International_Supervideos!" title="wikilink">International Supervideos!</a></em> sold reasonably well, going platinum in the <a href="U.S" class="uri" title="wikilink">U.S</a>. <em>Shenanigans</em> sported the band's b-sides, including &quot;Espionage&quot; which was featured in <em><a href="Austin_Powers:_The_Spy_Who_Shagged_Me" title="wikilink">Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me</a></em> and was nominated for a Grammy for <a href="Grammy_Award_for_Best_Rock_Instrumental_Performance" title="wikilink">Best Rock Instrumental Performance</a>. &quot;<a href="Ha_Ha_You&#39;re_Dead" title="wikilink">Ha Ha You're Dead</a>&quot;, recorded specifically for the <em>Shenanigans</em>, is seen as the highlight of the album.</p>
<p>In 2002, Green Day co-headlined the <a href="Pop_Disaster_Tour" title="wikilink">Pop Disaster Tour</a> with <a href="blink-182" class="uri" title="wikilink">blink-182</a> helped to resurrect some of the band's popularity, and earned the group many positive concert reviews. The band decided to take some more time off after the Pop Disaster Tour closed, to spend time with their families.</p>
<h3 id="american-idiot-and-renewed-popularity-2004present"><em>American Idiot</em> and renewed popularity (2004–present)</h3>



<p>In the summer of 2003 the band went into a studio to write and record new material for a new album, tentatively titled <em><a href="Cigarettes_and_Valentines" title="wikilink">Cigarettes and Valentines</a></em>.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> After completing 20 tracks, the <a href="Master_recording" title="wikilink">master tapes</a> were stolen from the studio. The band, understandably upset, chose not to try to re-create the stolen album (Armstrong feared that it would take their fan base &quot;back to about 50&quot;), but instead started over with a vow to be even better than before. In addition, they underwent serious &quot;band therapy,&quot; engaging in several long talks to work out the members' differences after accusations from Dirnt and Cool that Armstrong was &quot;the band's Nazi&quot;<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> and a show-off bent on taking the limelight from the other band members.</p>
<p>The resulting 2004 album, <em><a href="American_Idiot_(album)" title="wikilink">American Idiot</a></em>, debuted at #1 on the <a href="Billboard_magazine" title="wikilink">Billboard</a> charts, the band's first ever album to reach #1, backed by the success of the album's first single, &quot;American Idiot.&quot; The album was billed as a &quot;punk <a href="rock_opera" title="wikilink">rock opera</a>&quot; which follows the journey of the fictitious &quot;<a href="Jesus_Of_Suburbia" title="wikilink">Jesus Of Suburbia</a>&quot;.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> Also the album marked a significant growth in the band as musicians. <em>American Idiot</em> won the 2005 <a href="Grammy_Award" title="wikilink">Grammy</a> for &quot;Best Rock Album&quot; and the band swept the 2005 MTV music awards, winning a total of seven of the eight awards they were nominated for, including the coveted Viewer's Choice Award.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> <img src="Greenday_americanidiot.png" title="fig:Green Day&#39;s American Idiot album cover." alt="Green Day&#39;s American Idiot album cover." width="200" /> <em>American Idiot</em> also marked a major change of the band's image. Before, they dyed their hair wacky colors like pink, or green, and were getting into <a href="Woodstock_&#39;94" title="wikilink">mud fights with the audience</a>. <em>American Idiot</em> saw the band dying their hair more bland colors, such as black or white, and wearing eyeliner and makeup to concerts. Another change was the band's wardrobe. Instead of wearing t-shirts, the band constantly wore black and red clothes after the release of <em>American Idiot</em>, leading many to accuse Green Day of stealing <a href="The_Icarus_Line" title="wikilink">The Icarus Line</a>'s &quot;anti&quot;-fashion statement by wearing black clothes with red ties, or vice-versa, while others think the band is following up with the colors of <em>American Idiot's</em> cover. <img src="HaseAufCenterstage.jpg" title="fig:Green Day live in Germany during the American Idiot tour" alt="Green Day live in Germany during the American Idiot tour" width="378" /> Through 2005, the band toured, promoting the album with about 150 dates — their longest tour in their career — visiting Japan, Australia, South America and England, where they drew a crowd of 130,000 people over a span of two days - one of the largest crowds ever drawn for a rock concert. While touring for <em>American Idiot</em>, they filmed and recorded the two concerts at the <a href="Milton_Keynes" title="wikilink">Milton Keynes</a> <a href="National_Bowl" title="wikilink">National Bowl</a> in England, which was voted 'The Best Show On Earth' in a <a href="Kerrang!" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kerrang!</a> Magazine Poll. These recordings were released as a live CD and DVD called <em><a href="Bullet_in_a_Bible" title="wikilink">Bullet in a Bible</a></em> on <a href="November_15" title="wikilink">November 15</a>, <a href="2005" class="uri" title="wikilink">2005</a>. This CD/DVD featured hits from <em>American Idiot</em> as well as older songs from <em>Dookie</em> and <em>nimrod.</em>, among others. The DVD featured behind-the-scenes footage of the band, and showed how the band prepared to put on the show. The final shows of their 2005 world tour were in <a href="Sydney" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sydney</a>, <a href="Australia" class="uri" title="wikilink">Australia</a>, and <a href="Melbourne" class="uri" title="wikilink">Melbourne</a>, Australia, on December 14 and 17 respectively. On <a href="January_10" title="wikilink">January 10</a>, <a href="2006" class="uri" title="wikilink">2006</a> the band was awarded with a <a href="People&#39;s_Choice_Award" title="wikilink">People's Choice Award</a> for favorite group.</p>
<p>On <a href="August_1" title="wikilink">August 1</a>, <a href="2005_in_music" title="wikilink">2005</a>, it was announced that Green Day had rescinded the master rights to their pre-<em>Dookie</em> material from Lookout! Records, citing <a href="breach_of_contract" title="wikilink">breach of contract</a> regarding unpaid royalties that had been ongoing for some time, and with other Lookout! bands as well. The pre-<em>Dookie</em> material is set to be reissued by their label, Reprise, on <a href="January_9" title="wikilink">January 9</a>, <a href="2007" class="uri" title="wikilink">2007</a>.&lt;ref name=&quot;Billboard&gt;http://www.greendayauthority.com/index.php?subaction=showfull&amp;id=1166180174&amp;archive=&amp;start_from=&amp;ucat=&amp;</ref></p>
<p>In 2006 Green Day won the <a href="Grammy_Award_for_Record_of_the_Year" title="wikilink">Grammy Award for Record of the Year</a> for &quot;<a href="Boulevard_of_Broken_Dreams" title="wikilink">Boulevard of Broken Dreams</a>&quot;<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> which spent 16 weeks at the number one position of Billboard's <em>Modern Rock Tracks</em>, a record it shares along with <a href="Red_Hot_Chili_Peppers" title="wikilink">Red Hot Chili Peppers</a>' <a href="Scar_Tissue" title="wikilink">Scar Tissue</a> and <a href="Staind" class="uri" title="wikilink">Staind</a>'s &quot;It's Been Awhile&quot;.

Both the music videos &quot;Wake Me Up When September Ends&quot;, &quot;Boulevard Of Broken Dreams&quot; retired showing on <a href="TRL" class="uri" title="wikilink">TRL</a> after being on the top ten for 50 days each.</p>
<p>In September 2006, Green Day teamed up with <a href="U2" class="uri" title="wikilink">U2</a> and producer <a href="Rick_Rubin" title="wikilink">Rick Rubin</a> to record a cover of the song &quot;<a href="The_Saints_Are_Coming" title="wikilink">The Saints Are Coming</a>&quot; with an accompanying video, originally recorded by <a href="The_Skids" title="wikilink">The Skids</a>. The song is to benefit Music Rising, an organization to help raise money for musicians' instruments lost during <a href="Hurricane_Katrina" title="wikilink">Hurricane Katrina</a>, and to bring awareness on the eve of the one year anniversary of the disaster.</p>
<h4 id="future-plans">Future plans</h4>
<p>The video of <em>Jesus of Suburbia</em> is stated to be a prequel to their upcoming film, <em><a href="American_Idiot_(film)" title="wikilink">American Idiot: The Motion Picture</a></em>. In an interview with <em><a href="Billboard_magazine" title="wikilink">Billboard</a></em> magazine, Billie Joe Armstrong revealed that the group are still considering turning their punk rock opera into a film, in much the same spirit as the Beatles' <em><a href="Yellow_Submarine_(film)" title="wikilink">Yellow Submarine</a></em>, <a href="Pink_Floyd" title="wikilink">Pink Floyd</a>'s <em><a href="The_Wall_(film)" title="wikilink">The Wall</a></em> and <a href="the_Who" title="wikilink">the Who</a>'s <em><a href="Tommy_(film)" title="wikilink">Tommy</a></em> and <em><a href="Quadrophenia_(film)" title="wikilink">Quadrophenia</a></em>. The band has stated they have no intentions to act in the movie, although they may make an appearance. <a href="Lou_Taylor_Pucci" title="wikilink">Lou Taylor Pucci</a> and <a href="Kelli_Garner" title="wikilink">Kelli Garner</a> from the &quot;Jesus of Suburbia&quot; music video could make an appearance if the motion picture does go into production. Frontman Billie Joe Armstrong has said &quot;It's definitely unfolding. Every single week there's more ideas about doing a film for American Idiot, and it's definitely going to happen.&quot;<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> However, the movie has recently been pushed to the back burner, while the band works on their latest album.</p>
<p>The band's official website stated on September 2 that the band was back from their &quot;summer vacation&quot; and was back in the studio working on new material. A recent edition of <em><a href="NME" class="uri" title="wikilink">NME</a></em> has an interview with Green Day discussing future plans. The band said they have three albums' worth of material, all different types of music. The first is another <em>American Idiot</em>-style album, the second experimental type music (such as <a href="The_Clash" title="wikilink">The Clash</a>'s <em><a href="Sandinista!" class="uri" title="wikilink">Sandinista!</a></em>), and the third, hard and fast punk music, much like their <em>Insomniac</em> album. Recently, in an interview with <em><a href="Kerrang!" class="uri" title="wikilink">Kerrang!</a></em>, Billie Joe Armstrong revealed that it will be a &quot;fair estimate&quot; that the new album will be released in 2008.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="musical-style-and-influences">Musical style and influences</h2>
<p><img src="Werehappyfamily.jpg" title="fig:We&#39;re A Happy Family, the Ramones tribute album on which Green Day contributed a cover to &quot;Outsider&quot;." alt="We&#39;re A Happy Family, the Ramones tribute album on which Green Day contributed a cover to &quot;Outsider&quot;." width="170" /> Green Day's sound is often compared to first wave punk rock bands such as the <a href="Ramones" class="uri" title="wikilink">Ramones</a>, <a href="The_Clash" title="wikilink">The Clash</a>, and the <a href="Buzzcocks" class="uri" title="wikilink">Buzzcocks</a>.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a><a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> The majority of their song catalog is composed of distorted guitar, fast, manic drums, and low, heavy bass. Most of their songs are fast-paced and under the average song length of four minutes (4:00). Billie Joe Armstrong has however said his biggest influences are seminal <a href="alternative_rock" title="wikilink">alternative rock</a> bands <a href="H&lt;U+00FC&gt;sker_D&lt;U+00FC&gt;" title="wikilink">H&lt;U+00FC&gt;sker D&lt;U+00FC&gt;</a> and <a href="The_Replacements" title="wikilink">The Replacements</a>, and that their influence is particularly noted in the band's chord changes in songs.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> In fact, Green Day has covered H&lt;U+00FC&gt;sker D&lt;U+00FC&gt;'s &quot;Don't Want to Know If You Are Lonely&quot; as a b-side for the song &quot;Warning&quot;, and the character &quot;Mr. Whirly&quot; in the song &quot;Misery&quot; is a reference to the Replacements song of the same name.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> Armstrong's lyrics describe alienation, (&quot;<a href="Jesus_of_Suburbia" title="wikilink">Jesus of Suburbia</a>&quot;, &quot;Boulevard of Broken Dreams&quot;, &quot;<a href="Reject_(song)" title="wikilink">Reject</a>&quot;), hysteria (&quot;<a href="Basket_Case" title="wikilink">Basket Case</a>&quot;, &quot;<a href="Panic_Song" title="wikilink">Panic Song</a>&quot;), girls (&quot;<a href="She_(Green_Day)" title="wikilink">She</a>&quot;, &quot;80&quot;), the effects of doing drugs (&quot;<a href="Geek_Stink_Breath" title="wikilink">Geek Stink Breath</a>&quot;, &quot;<a href="Green_Day_(song)" title="wikilink">Green Day</a>&quot;) ; The Ramones had similar lyrical themes, like hysteria (&quot;Anxiety&quot;, &quot;Psycho Therapy&quot;), alienation (&quot;Outsider&quot;, &quot;Something To Believe In&quot;), girls (&quot;I Wanna Be Your Boyfriend&quot;, &quot;<a href="Sheena_Is_a_Punk_Rocker" title="wikilink">Sheena Is a Punk Rocker</a>&quot;), and drugs (&quot;Now I Wanna Sniff Some Glue&quot;, &quot;<a href="Chinese_Rocks" title="wikilink">Chinese Rocks</a>&quot;). Green Day covered their song Outsider on the tribute album <em><a href="We&#39;re_a_Happy_Family" title="wikilink">We're a Happy Family</a></em> and they have also covered the Ramones' &quot;Blitzkrieg Bop.&quot; Green Day's style also closely resembles that of other bands based around the <a href="924_Gilman_Street" title="wikilink">924 Gilman Street</a> scene in the late 1980s and early 1990s, such as <a href="Crimpshrine" class="uri" title="wikilink">Crimpshrine</a>, <a href="Screeching_Weasel" title="wikilink">Screeching Weasel</a>, and <a href="The_Mr._T_Experience" title="wikilink">The Mr. T Experience</a>.</p>
<h2 id="criticism-and-controversy">Criticism and controversy</h2>
<p>Beginning with the release of <em><a href="Dookie" class="uri" title="wikilink">Dookie</a>,</em> and the subsequent explosion of <a href="MTV" class="uri" title="wikilink">MTV</a> Airplay it received, Green Day has received considerable criticism from those who prefer to see the punk genre as a social movement independent of corporate sponsorship. With the release of <em><a href="American_Idiot_(album)" title="wikilink">American Idiot</a></em> and the subsequent draw of many new fans, much of this criticism has been revived.</p>
<p>Green Day were banned from 924 Gilman Street for a time, because they left <a href="Lookout!_Records" title="wikilink">Lookout! Records</a> to sign with major label <a href="Reprise_Records" title="wikilink">Reprise</a>.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> However, in recent years the ban has been lifted, as Green Day performed a surprise show at the venue in 2003.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a></p>
<p>One of the more contentious issues is genre labeling. In reaction to both the style of music and the background of the band, some fans and musicians have taken heavy objection to the usage of the term &quot;punk&quot; when applied to Green Day. This is evidenced by the following comments issued by <a href="John_Lydon" title="wikilink">John Lydon</a>, former front man of both the 70s punk band the <a href="Sex_Pistols" title="wikilink">Sex Pistols</a> and 80s <a href="post-punk" class="uri" title="wikilink">post-punk</a> act, <a href="Public_Image_Ltd." title="wikilink">Public Image Ltd.</a>. <a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Don't try and tell me Green Day are punk. They're not, they're plonk and they're bandwagoning on something they didn't come up with themselves. I think they are phony.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;So there we are fending off all that and it pisses me off that years later a wank outfit like Green Day hop in and nick all that and attach it to themselves. They didn't earn their wings to do that and if they were true punk they wouldn't look anything like they do.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="Steve_Diggle" title="wikilink">Steve Diggle</a> of the <a href="Buzzcocks" class="uri" title="wikilink">Buzzcocks</a> commented on the band after meeting them:<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;I didn't have a clue who they were. And they're not punks.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="Brandon_Flowers" title="wikilink">Brandon Flowers</a> of <a href="The_Killers" title="wikilink">The Killers</a> has recently gone on record claiming that Green Day's politically driven concept album <em><a href="American_Idiot_(album)" title="wikilink">American Idiot</a></em> displays &quot;calculated Anti-Americanism.&quot; He explained that he has problems with the album content itself and also the fact that the band's recent live DVD, <em><a href="Bullet_in_a_Bible" title="wikilink">Bullet in a Bible</a></em>, was filmed overseas. The taping of the concert, featured on <em>Bullet in a Bible</em>, shows thousands of <a href="Europeans" class="uri" title="wikilink">Europeans</a> singing along to &quot;American Idiot.&quot; Stating that he felt Green Day's DVD is a bit of a stunt, he said, &quot;I just thought it was really cheap. To go to a place like <a href="England" class="uri" title="wikilink">England</a> or <a href="Germany" class="uri" title="wikilink">Germany</a> and sing that song - those kids aren't taking it the same way that he meant it. And he [Billie Joe Armstrong] knew it.&quot;<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a></p>
<p>Paul McPike, a grocery store clerk, recently filed a copyright infringement lawsuit against Green Day claiming that he wrote the song &quot;American Idiot&quot; almost 15 years ago. He alleges that he performed the song at a high school and a recording of the song made it into the hands of Green Day. McPike is currently seeking a share of the album's profits. U.S. Magistrate Judge John Cooney attempted to dismiss the case in early November 2006, but it is expected that McPike will file an amended lawsuit, with additional evidence (at the first hearing, his only evidence was a copy of the &quot;American Idiot&quot; CD. <a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a>: This is not the first time McPike has filed a lawsuit against a band, as he also claimed <a href="blink-182" class="uri" title="wikilink">blink-182</a> stole his song &quot;<a href="Feeling_This" title="wikilink">Feeling This</a>&quot;. This case was again dismissed.</p>
<p>More recently, <a href="Oasis_(band)" title="wikilink">Oasis</a> guitarist <a href="Noel_Gallagher" title="wikilink">Noel Gallagher</a> has criticized the song &quot;Boulevard Of Broken Dreams&quot; for ripping off his own song &quot;<a href="Wonderwall_(song)" title="wikilink">Wonderwall</a>&quot;. Gallagher stated, &quot;If you listen, you'll find it is exactly the same arrangement as Wonderwall. They should have the decency to wait until I am dead (before stealing my songs). I, at least, pay the people I steal from that courtesy. They consider themselves to be - and I quote - 'a kick-ass rock 'n' roll band'. They could not be less kick-ass if they tried.&quot; <a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a></p>
